[0:00] in him doing these things so you see he
[0:02] was properly uh Vindicated there could
[0:05] be no
[0:07] mistake the little woman at the well
[0:09] didn't didn't make any mistake she said
[0:12] uh sir we know when Messiah cometh He
[0:15] he'll do these things but who are you
[0:16] she he said I'm he and a man that could
[0:20] do a thing like that would surely tell
[0:22] the
[0:24] truth the truth of God was with him and
[0:27] they were commissioned if the prophet
[0:29] raised and and done the said something
[0:31] and what he said come to pass he was
[0:34] identified as a prophet and she had
[0:36] recognized him as a prophet and asked
[0:39] who he was and he told her then that
[0:42] settled it she ran into the City and
[0:43] said come see a man who told me the
[0:45] things there was no mistake about it
[0:48] Philip had no mistake although when uh
[0:51] uh Nathaniel rather when Philip had
[0:53] tried to tell him what had taken place
[0:55] when he met
[0:56] Simon but uh when Nathaniel came he was
[1:01] a little in doubt but when he seen Jesus
[1:04] and Jesus said to him behold an
[1:06] Israelite whom there's no God he said
[1:08] Rabbi when did you know me he said
[1:10] before philli called you I saw
[1:14] you there there was no possible way of a
[1:18] mistake he said Rabbi you are the Son of
[1:22] God you're the king of Israel Jesus said
[1:25] because I've told you that you believe
[1:27] you can see greater than that now his
[1:30] sinless nature expressed God's word see
[1:34] he was the word so God expressed himself
[1:37] but that sinless nature may I stop here
[1:40] just a second I don't want to keep you
[1:43] too long
[1:44] but it just seems so good to me to talk
[1:47] to
[1:48] people notice see his sinless nature
[1:53] expressed what he was he W then if his
[1:57] sinless
[1:58] nature
[2:03] it shows that our nature is evil and
[2:06] it's no matter how much we try to patch
[2:08] it up or how much we try to indument it

[32:41] prophet that is the way God Reveals His
[32:45] Secrets he first tells it to a man and
[32:48] man tells it to the body of
[32:51] Christ amen and We Know by the grace of
[32:56] God is the final
[32:58] age brother vam said in the message
[33:02] Paradox
[33:04] 1961 he said the Gentile message started
[33:07] by a visitation of the pillar of
[33:12] fire and it ends the same
[33:16] way we know by the grace of
[33:19] God that when Paul was on his road to
[33:23] EMAs
[33:25] Damascus theill
[33:29] he didn't know who the pill of fire
[33:31] was fell from his
[33:34] horse Hallelujah and he asked a
[33:38] question who art
[33:40] thou and Jesus said in
[33:43] response I am
[33:47] Jesus why do you persecute
[33:50] me Hallelujah so Jesus was now in the
[33:55] pill ofier
[33:58] identify himself with the body of
[34:01] Christ Hallelujah so when Paul was uh
[34:06] persecuting the
[34:08] church he was persecuting
[34:12] Jesus why Jesus said unto
[34:15] Paul it's hard to kick against the
[34:19] [Music]
[34:25] prick amen
[34:28] amen amen amen so when the word was
[34:32] opened and we believe that that the
[34:36] seals were open and brother Adam tells
[34:39] us that the Bible would come become a
[34:41] new
[34:43] book
[34:44] Hallelujah the words never
[34:47] change but the revelation of the
[34:51] word
[34:53] enhanced Hallelujah the Bible comes
[34:56] becomes a new
[34:58] book what does that
[35:01] mean now it'll never become a new
[35:05] book a person who's not born
[35:08] again if you don't have the Holy
[35:11] Ghost the Bible will always read the
[35:14] same way it's always been read to
[35:19] you in the same manner that you have
[35:23] always heard
[35:25] it Spirit F
[35:28] person not only hear the word but they
[35:32] cast the
[35:34] Revelation the
[35:36] word this is where Jesus says my sheep
[35:42] Hearth my
[35:44] voice right it is a spirit of
[35:47] quickening that God quickens that word
[35:50] to
[35:53] those who are
[35:55] his is that right
[35:57] coming from the message identified
[35:59] Christ of all the
[36:03] ages paragraph
[36:05] 42 here the prophet of God says and
[36:08] until you come in behind that Badge of
[36:13] skin until you get out of your old
[36:20] skin your
[36:22] cre and come into the presence of
[36:25] God word becomes a living reality to
[36:32] you then you are awakened to the kind of
[36:37] Glory the Bible becomes a new
[36:42] book then Jesus Christ is the same
[36:46] yesterday
[36:47] today Hallelujah you're living in his
[36:52] presence shoe bread that only provided
[36:56] the day for
[36:58] believers
[37:02] only prood holy
[37:05] nation peculiar people giving spiritual
[37:10] sacrifices to
[37:12] God you must come in I'm going read that
[37:18] again but you must come
[37:22] in to beh to behind the Bell
[37:27] to see the unveiled
[37:30] God and God is
[37:33] unveiled that's his word made
[37:37] manifest hallelujah hallelujah there are
[37:39] many people that that has the
[37:43] ability of of of casting out
[37:48] Devils
[37:50] preaching they have faith Hallelujah
[37:54] they can preach they can
[37:57] sing Hallelujah give their ties give
[38:00] their
[38:01] offerings and yet not be born
[38:08] again way and yet not be
[38:11] sealed with the Holy
[38:14] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah why is it
[38:18] important we look around the message and
[38:22] we see all kinds of things
[38:25] happening
[38:27] those who claim to be the
[38:30] message the message does not identify
[38:35] them as the
[38:37] Christ as the anointed
[38:39] ones the word is supposed to identify
[38:44] us amen as true believers of
[38:48] Christ because you are
[38:50] anointed doesn't mean that you're
[38:52] jumping all the time running up and down
[38:55] the AIS
[38:57] or any kind of thing like that the
[39:00] maturity of anointing need to be filled
[39:04] with
[39:07] God word abiding in you and abing in his
[39:11] word that's what anointing
[39:14] means when Jesus stood behind the
[39:17] P Hallelujah as brother Bram said he was
[39:21] fully
[39:23] anointed when he read the scripture in
[39:26] Isaiah
[39:28] this scripture
[39:31] is in your
[39:34] ears he didn't scream it out Hallelujah
[39:38] but he spoke
[39:40] itall every word he
[39:43] spoke fully
[39:45] anointed Hallelujah with the power of
[39:50] God see God made us in His
[39:53] image he made us in his lik
[39:57] man is made in the image and likeness of
[40:02] God and the opening of the word brought
[40:06] back the order of man hallu but it'll
[40:10] never become
[40:13] effective until you truly believe
[40:17] it but how you going to believe
[40:20] it without the believer on the
[40:25] inside
[40:27] right like I heard my brother say the
[40:29] other
[40:30] day the greatest and the strongest of
[40:33] all
[40:34] demons is the demon of
[40:38] unbelief hallelujah hallelujah amen and
[40:41] it's so
[40:42] simple as simple as faith
[40:45] is believe is we must learn how to
[40:49] recognize the
[40:51] two unbelief
[40:54] struggles it struggles
[40:57] faith never
[40:59] struggles Faith stands
[41:02] still Hallelujah is that right faith is
[41:06] a
[41:07] revelation it's not a hope
[41:10] Soul a no
[41:12] soul hallah and we must come to that
[41:17] place if the word of God said we are
[41:21] virtuous must believe we are
[41:24] virtuous Hallelujah we cannot
[41:28] afford in these last days to allow
[41:34] Satan to make
[41:38] us doubl
[41:43] minded hallelujah hallelujah there is an
[41:47] order and I'm just you know we preached
[41:49] uh the last time on a little bit of
[41:53] it Christ is the head of the church
[41:57] the man is the head of the
[41:59] woman and God is the head of
[42:02] Christ Hallelujah it may even seem like
[42:05] you working with a
[42:07] trinity it's a trinity in
[42:10] position it's a Oneness in God
[42:14] Hallelujah the same God is in
[42:17] Christ and Christ is in his
[42:19] people hallelujah he in that day you
[42:23] know that I am in the father father and
[42:26] I
[42:28] in hallelujah hallelujah First
[42:31] Corinthians
[42:41] 113 but I wouldn't I would have you know
[42:46] that the head of every man is
[42:50] Christ and the head of the
[42:53] woman is the
[42:55] man and the head of Christ is
[42:59] God hallelujah hallelujah
[43:02] anytime this order is
[43:05] broken it will bring
[43:08] chaos is that right remember when
[43:13] Samuel told Saul to wait till he would
[43:16] comes
[43:18] back and Saul took it upon
[43:21] himself to move out of his
[43:25] office
[43:26] King not a
[43:28] priest when he moved out of his
[43:32] office and began to do
[43:35] sacrifice Hallelujah it brought
[43:39] chaos hallelujah hallelujah and
[43:42] eventually that little move of
[43:46] Saul he him
[43:49] himself and his son
[43:52] Jonathan and a whole Army of people
[43:56] killed by one man's
[43:59] mistake think about it it's a Rippling
[44:04] effect when you move out of your
[44:08] position Hallelujah it it just doesn't
[44:11] stop
[44:13] there is that the truth if the man is
[44:16] not the man of the
[44:20] house if the woman is not the woman of
[44:22] the
[44:25] house Hallelujah and if the children
[44:27] don't reverence mother and
[44:32] father hallelu you see the law wasn't
[44:36] given really to imprison anyone it was
[44:41] given so that we can see how faulty we
[44:46] are so that we can see the
[44:49] error were born in we were all born
[44:54] perverted we were born born out of the
[44:58] perfect order of
[45:01] God we were not to be born by
[45:06] sex to bring Birth by the spoken
[45:11] word and and that in order for heaven to
[45:15] be our
[45:17] home that order had to be
[45:22] restored hallelujah hallelujah the
[45:24] natural Adam could not restore
[45:29] it another
[45:31] ad a one that God describe as the
[45:34] beginning of his
[45:36] creation
[45:39] hallu when Mary carrying
[45:44] Jesus that God being
[45:48] created was the beginning of God's
[45:52] creation that God would suffer a woman
[45:56] that God will suffer a
[45:59] woman to byass a
[46:02] man to bring forth the Christ
[46:06] child the woman who
[46:10] beged God used her
[46:13] Temple use her
[46:16] wound to produce
[46:19] himself he didn't use her blood he
[46:23] didn't he didn't use Joseph
[46:26] blood Jesus was the blood of
[46:29] godallah Hallelujah he was the beginning
[46:32] of
[46:34] his things are being said in
[46:38] order Hallelujah and one of these old
[46:42] days everything will line
[46:44] up the blood of Jesus Christ line up the
[46:54] world when we get back in
[46:59] order Paul says this model will put on
[47:10] immortality Hallelujah we must get back
[47:13] in
[47:14] order hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[47:17] Christ
[47:19] died not just to save you from your
[47:23] sins hallelujah hallelujah but he came
[47:27] that he would give you the
[47:29] life or the
[47:31] token Hallelujah Adam
[47:35] lost that light that Adam
[47:38] forfeited it had to be brought back
[47:43] to and only Jesus Christ could do
[47:47] it thank God for
[47:50] Jesus I don't know about you I don't
[47:54] understand anybody who's afraid of the
[47:57] Holy
[47:59] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is
[48:02] God hallelujah it is the thing that
[48:05] every man is
[48:08] missing when you receive the Holy Ghost
[48:10] on the
[48:13] inside I'm not talking about your
[48:16] flesh not talking about your spirit I'm
[48:19] talk about your
[48:21] soul when the Holy Ghost goes into the
[48:24] holy
[48:26] changes you hallelujah hallelujah it
[48:30] changes you from a
[48:32] sinner Hallelujah y'all hear me Chang
[48:36] you from aous
[48:39] sinner daugh of
[48:42] God born of God Bor by his
[48:46] Spirit his
[48:49] blood that's why Jesus
[48:52] came everything back in all
[48:57] hallu hallelujah hallelujah see God
[49:00] chose
[49:01] men to maintain
[49:04] order is that right he told Adam in the
[49:08] beginning he said I want you to subdue
[49:12] everything but what was there to
[49:17] sedu but there was one subtle
[49:20] Beast that need to
[49:24] be
[49:26] Beast that needed to be
[49:28] controlled Hallelujah I don't know
[49:31] exactly where Adam
[49:33] was when the serpent talked to
[49:36] e
[49:38] somehow Hallelujah he thought it was
[49:41] good
[49:42] enough to talk to the
[49:45] serpent Hallelujah but that's where the
[49:48] order was
[49:51] broken cuz Man was created
[49:54] first being the
[49:57] woman Hallelujah and because she was
[50:01] deceived she was
[50:03] seduced and she broke the whole order of
[50:08] Creation The Animals didn't
[50:11] sin because of their
[50:15] unbelief anal must flowers Must Die
[50:20] vations Must Die everything that has
[50:24] life analistic
[50:26] life life Must Die Hallelujah but
[50:32] there's a
[50:33] Jesus there is a quickening SP Spirit
[50:36] there is a
[50:38] second came to restore
[50:41] everything hallelujah hallelujah there's
[50:43] a
[50:44] land will never grow old
[50:47] [Music]
[50:49] hallu will never fade
[50:52] away be a stormy sky
[50:56] and right now we're
[50:58] moving back into our
[51:02] position that is why the
[51:08] creation the manifestations of the sons
[51:10] of
[51:12] God even the
[51:15] creation know that is everything is out
[51:18] of
[51:21] order hallelujah hallelujah now Earth
[51:25] was under the order of
[51:27] man the
[51:29] atmosphere was under the order of man
[51:32] the Garden of Eden was under the order
[51:35] of man Adam Adam was the first to
[51:38] receive this
[51:41] Authority Adam as a man was an amateur
[51:45] God who was given rulership over the
[51:48] Earth Hallelujah Adam was
[51:53] responsible mistakes
[51:56] Hallelujah and if you see in the Book of
[52:00] Genesis when God created heaven and
[52:03] earth hallelujah hallelujah somehow it
[52:06] fit right into
[52:11] theallu because when man broke the
[52:15] Covenant Even
[52:24] Heaven
[52:27] amen hallelujah hallelujah you say
[52:30] that's not
[52:32] true well is not the Earth in
[52:36] heaven and because of
[52:39] sin it was thrown out of
[52:42] position hallelujah hallelujah we call
[52:45] it the
[52:47] flood
[52:48] did because of his
[52:52] sin right to do it hallelujah hallelujah
[52:56] and his
[52:57] strength or his authority speaking of
[53:00] Satan has grown so
[53:04] much called The
[53:06] God Satan become the
[53:14] god is that right can you
[53:17] imagine SC on the
[53:21] mountain when when when when Lucifer was
[53:24] tempting God
[53:26] Jesus Christ and told him I give you
[53:30] everything on the highest Pinnacle of
[53:32] the
[53:35] church is this is the
[53:39] creature talking to the
[53:43] Creator if you humble
[53:47] yourself Hallelujah if you bow before me
[53:51] this is
[53:51] sat talking to the Creator I will give
[53:56] you
[53:58] everything hallelujah hallelujah but
[54:00] Jesus Christ being the
[54:03] word he understood who he
[54:07] was hallelujah hallelujah and he thought
[54:10] things were out of
[54:12] order he was the
[54:15] token he was the one that was going to
[54:17] bring
[54:19] everything everything
[54:22] in he brings everything so in
[54:26] order Lucifer and all of his
[54:29] demons into the Lake of
[54:32] Fire Hall he not only rule for
[54:37] time rules for
[54:41] et about it there'll never be another
[54:46] serpent that can harm
[54:50] you hallelujah hallelujah this is the
[54:54] reason
[54:56] when when when mankind
[54:59] fell God came to
[55:03] Adam and say where are you
[55:08] Adam because Adam was in a place he had
[55:12] never been
[55:15] before he had always been in the
[55:18] presence of the
[55:19] Lord and never knew what it felt like
[55:21] being out of
[55:24] it all he could say unto that
[55:27] voice is that I am
[55:31] naked I'm without your
[55:34] presence hallelujah hallelujah something
[55:37] has happened here there's a breach going
[55:41] on I don't feel you the way I used
[55:45] to come on somebody he knew he was
[55:49] naked and then Jesus or Christ or
[55:54] God said unto
[55:57] Adam he didn't say
[55:59] what if it had just been a
[56:02] beast he would have said what he said
[56:06] who told
[56:09] you showing that the
[56:12] serpent was a man in the image of a
[56:16] man is that right but read your Bible
[56:20] The Book of
[56:23] Revelation devil
[56:25] is a man Antichrist is a
[56:34] manake
[56:36] amen the nature of God is
[56:39] eternal and I'm coming to it it is of
[56:44] heaven or can I say it like this it is
[56:47] beyond
[56:50] heaven heaven was
[56:53] created and he was before
[56:58] then self existing

[57:31] nothing we don't even know what nothing
[57:36] is but we do know that God said if there
[57:41] be another

[1:07:37] crowd that Judas of
[1:07:41] affected because he betrayed
[1:07:44] Christ he brought the
[1:07:47] Sanhedrin all of the Jewish
[1:07:49] people into
[1:07:52] death think about
[1:07:55] it had not Judas betrayed
[1:07:59] Christ they would have never known who
[1:08:01] Jesus
[1:08:02] was he was a common unless he would have
[1:08:05] just revealed himself to
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:12] him and Judas cast out Devils laid hands
[1:08:17] on the
[1:08:18] sick
[1:08:20] preer full of death
[1:08:24] hallelujah hallelujah and wherever he
[1:08:27] would he you know he brought
[1:08:30] death dying to this
[1:08:33] day because of the Jewish chose
[1:08:37] choosing because of the Jews
[1:08:41] choosing to reject Jesus
[1:08:44] Christ even when they know he was
[1:08:49] life amen hello yes true that's how it
[1:08:54] is with the
[1:08:55] message people come to the
[1:08:58] message and then all they see they say
[1:09:01] well there's no life they think life is
[1:09:06] shouting speaking in tongues all that's
[1:09:10] good but life is the character of
[1:09:13] Christ hallelujah hallelujah you may not
[1:09:16] never dance in your life you may never
[1:09:19] jum in your life or even speak in Tong
[1:09:23] but if the character of
[1:09:26] Christ you will reflect
[1:09:28] it people will know who you
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:33] are they will respect
[1:09:35] you for those who are not possessed with
[1:09:39] Devils now what is death
[1:09:42] anyway as def
[1:09:44] find it is it is a separation from
[1:09:48] God which was caused by
[1:09:52] sin and you know for years years for
[1:09:54] years we thought sin was
[1:09:57] drinking and smoking and gambling and
[1:10:02] prostitution we had to have a prophet
[1:10:04] tell
[1:10:06] us that's not
[1:10:09] sin attributes
[1:10:11] of sin is
[1:10:15] unbelief hallelujah hallelujah and if
[1:10:18] you can't believe that you going to get
[1:10:20] the Holy Ghost if you don't have
[1:10:22] it that that sin is blocking
[1:10:26] you what are you going to do with the
[1:10:29] scripture whoever let him come let him
[1:10:34] take up the wers of Life
[1:10:38] fre and you can't be whosoever
[1:10:42] will Hallelujah the problem is it's not
[1:10:47] the word you're not willing to
[1:10:51] die Hallelujah say it like this if there
[1:10:55] is no death there is no
[1:10:59] Resurrection
[1:11:00] amen even the
[1:11:03] seed that's planted in the
[1:11:05] ground has to die and rise in order to
[1:11:09] live
[1:11:10] again hallelujah hallelujah and you and
[1:11:13] I are
[1:11:14] trees and we are
[1:11:17] seeds that must die and
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:22] root don't care about your
[1:11:26] attitude matter of fact God wants that
[1:11:28] to
[1:11:32] die listen Isaiah says your sins have
[1:11:36] separated you and
[1:11:39] God that's Isaiah
[1:11:42] 592 this spiritual death is is is a
[1:11:46] alter
[1:11:47] alternatively as the death of the
[1:11:52] Soul the soul that sinth shall surely
[1:11:56] die Hallelujah listen Ezekiel you have
[1:12:00] to turn there it's 18
[1:12:04] and4 behold the souls are
[1:12:07] mine as the soul of the father so also
[1:12:11] the soul of the son is
[1:12:16] mine the soul that
[1:12:18] sinth it shall
[1:12:20] die and that word sinth
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:25] e means to continue to
[1:12:28] disbelieve as long as you continue to
[1:12:32] disel hallah I'm going tell you your
[1:12:35] problem the problem around this message
[1:12:38] is that there too many people that does
[1:12:41] not have the Holy
[1:12:43] Ghost in their
[1:12:45] souls we to we see too many
[1:12:48] personali I'm not interested in
[1:12:51] personal only one personal
[1:12:54] interested
[1:12:57] in hallelujah hallelujah bringing forth
[1:13:00] of his
[1:13:02] kind because when the early Christian
[1:13:05] brought forth
[1:13:06] Christ they were not called by their
[1:13:10] names they were called
[1:13:13] Christians because they brought forth
[1:13:15] the Life of
[1:13:17] Christ hallelujah hallelujah to know God
[1:13:20] is
[1:13:21] life and to know not God is
[1:13:24] death hallelujah hallelujah many
[1:13:27] Believers are still
[1:13:29] dead their
[1:13:31] soul that that's why many many struggle
[1:13:35] with
[1:13:38] prayer many struggle with
[1:13:41] fasting many struggle with uh attitudes
[1:13:44] of
[1:13:46] hatred strife
[1:13:48] and all of these attributes that I just
[1:13:52] named are attributes of the spirit and
[1:13:56] soul and it must
[1:14:00] die and it's up to every individual I'm
[1:14:03] trying to if we going to have a
[1:14:04] Revival we've got to all die
[1:14:08] first I can't die for you you can't die
[1:14:11] for
[1:14:12] me but the only thing I know
[1:14:15] is Jesus was led by
[1:14:19] God to
[1:14:22] Calvary
[1:14:25] if you want to die get on your knees
[1:14:29] somewhere and the Holy Ghost will take
[1:14:31] you to
[1:14:34] Calvary because he said take up your
[1:14:38] cross if there is no
[1:14:41] crucifixion no life
[1:14:46] am hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:14:49] crucifixion of Jesus Christ was horrify
[1:14:54] Hallelujah is that
[1:14:56] right oh my many Believers are still
[1:15:00] dead in their
[1:15:01] souls they are like a Peter who believ
[1:15:04] but has never died and R to
[1:15:10] himself producing death as a
[1:15:15] Christian he went for the man's
[1:15:22] head def by
[1:15:29] fighting hallelujah hallelujah fighting
[1:15:32] By The
[1:15:34] Sword and if you fight by the
[1:15:37] sword Die By The
[1:15:39] Sword so many
[1:15:44] preachers dead in
[1:15:46] theit know how to do
[1:15:50] F fight by the
[1:15:52] sword by
[1:15:56] the we supposed to be
[1:15:59] sheep Lambs
[1:16:02] God hallelujah you've never seen a lamb
[1:16:04] carrying a
[1:16:07] sword he lays his life
[1:16:10] down he suffers himself to be
[1:16:14] defrauded he don't care how people
[1:16:16] treats
[1:16:18] him as long as he knows he's in the will
[1:16:20] of
[1:16:22] God did I just make that
[1:16:25] up Jesus went to
[1:16:28] Calvary as a sacrificial
[1:16:32] lamb you are a sacrificial
[1:16:35] lamb somebody sped on
[1:16:38] you supposed to keep your
[1:16:40] M they you supposed to keep your
[1:16:46] mou not feeling it you're not seeing
[1:16:49] what I'm saying because you're still
[1:16:51] living I dead man he won't even
[1:17:00] grunt you're not
[1:17:03] dead do you think those early
[1:17:05] Christians when they were going to throw
[1:17:07] them in the Lion's
[1:17:09] dead you think they were
[1:17:12] F the B the word tells us or history
[1:17:15] tells us they
[1:17:17] ran to meet the Lions why because they
[1:17:21] had an anointing
[1:17:24] Hall is that right even in the hour of
[1:17:29] persecution Jesus tells us they will
[1:17:33] deliver you up into the
[1:17:35] counsel Hallelujah but he said don't
[1:17:41] even but don't think about what you
[1:17:45] should
[1:17:46] say that
[1:17:48] hour I will speak for you Hallelujah but
[1:17:52] in order for him to speak for you
[1:17:55] Hallelujah he must be in you is that
[1:17:59] right I think it was
[1:18:01] poly they were to burn
[1:18:04] him and and the spirit of God said
[1:18:08] poly don't worry I'm with
[1:18:11] you you hear what I'm saying Jesus the
[1:18:14] same
[1:18:16] yesterday day and
[1:18:18] forever when they tried to put uh when
[1:18:20] they put John in that b
[1:18:26] oil didn't fear the
[1:18:29] oil the
[1:18:31] flame fear the fear the fire he knew who
[1:18:35] his creator
[1:18:37] was most of all God already told
[1:18:42] John not going to die until you see the
[1:18:45] coming
[1:18:48] of and you and I must
[1:18:50] realize there are those with the same
[1:18:57] Covenant you translate
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] it amen
[1:19:05] hallu what is life we want to
[1:19:09] live life is the greatest
[1:19:12] treasure that man can
[1:19:15] have yeah let me tell yall something
[1:19:17] brother didn't have his own
[1:19:19] Revelation the Revelation in which he
[1:19:21] had was delivered to him by
[1:19:24] God it doesn't matter what Scofield says
[1:19:28] or great uh
[1:19:31] theologians were
[1:19:33] theologians the word comes to the
[1:19:35] prophet and you can't believe a little
[1:19:37] bit of it a lot of it but you got to
[1:19:41] believe the whole
[1:19:42] thing whether you understand it or not
[1:19:45] he doesn't
[1:19:50] ask amen am amen and now we've got to
[1:19:56] find what life
[1:19:58] is and he said my word is
[1:20:01] life that's the life that you should
[1:20:04] have the word living in
[1:20:07] you now watch I see this in my early
[1:20:11] conversion when I was just a boy I seen
[1:20:15] that and I knew that I needed an
[1:20:18] absolute so I read the word of God and I
[1:20:23] seen that this word was
[1:20:25] Christ and I wanted that for my
[1:20:29] absolute you heard what brother say I
[1:20:32] wanted Christ as my
[1:20:36] absolute why because there are so many
[1:20:38] people who could Out quote me when it
[1:20:39] comes to
[1:20:41] this
[1:20:44] abolute took him so I took him at his
[1:20:48] word and I heard him say in
[1:20:51] there in
[1:20:53] me word abide in you you ask what you
[1:20:58] will will be given unto
[1:21:01] you what a promise that's your absolute
[1:21:05] if you abide in him word abide
[1:21:09] in whatever you
[1:21:11] will the problem is he is not
[1:21:15] abiding abiding means he's
[1:21:19] staying he doesn't move in and out of
[1:21:21] you
[1:21:23] for good you are in him for
[1:21:27] good behind the
[1:21:32] curtain living the
[1:21:36] life hallelujah hallelujah now where are
[1:21:40] we today
[1:21:41] Brethren where are we if you abide in
[1:21:46] me you then you can ask what you
[1:21:50] will done for you now that that Christ
[1:21:54] own
[1:21:55] word what the word has to abide in you
[1:22:01] if you abide in me in Christ and my word
[1:22:06] in you then how do we get into
[1:22:09] Christ by baptism of the Holy
[1:22:12] Spirit then that's one
[1:22:15] part but then if you abide in
[1:22:18] me and then my word abide in you you
[1:22:23] just got the Holy
[1:22:27] Ghost be your
[1:22:29] head it must be the leading of your
[1:22:32] whole your your whole
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:38] being that's why the Bible says lean not
[1:22:41] to your own understanding but
[1:22:44] acknowledge the Lord the word in all
[1:22:47] your ways he
[1:22:51] will
[1:22:54] you love the
[1:22:55] Lord if you abide in me and then my word
[1:22:59] abide in then you can ask what you will
[1:23:03] but you have to have both Christ and
[1:23:06] word and you really can't have one
[1:23:08] without the other that's right because
[1:23:12] it's the self same
[1:23:14] thing hallelujah hallelujah is that
[1:23:17] right because when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:23:19] in you what does he do that Stony heart
[1:23:24] a heart of Flesh and God writes his word
[1:23:28] into
[1:23:29] you you become the written word The
[1:23:33] Living Word Hallelujah that's what Paul
[1:23:36] said we are living
[1:23:41] inist Hallelujah glory to God now the
[1:23:44] true birth of God in your soul is a
[1:23:49] mess I'm so tired of these
[1:23:53] Methodist
[1:23:57] experiences everyone that I
[1:24:00] know I have seen uh with this Methodist
[1:24:06] experience can't even love their
[1:24:12] brothers but they in the
[1:24:15] message the Catholic spirit is in here
[1:24:19] too they figure they can do pentant
[1:24:24] they got the Holy
[1:24:27] Ghost of course the Baptist is in here
[1:24:30] too he don't care how he
[1:24:33] lives he in the message and the blood
[1:24:36] saves
[1:24:38] him all them denominations has
[1:24:41] influenced this
[1:24:43] message because people do not want to
[1:24:46] die to the
[1:24:48] themselves Hallelujah they brought the
[1:24:50] Pentecostal uh into this
[1:24:55] thing oh my when I was in the Apostolic
[1:24:59] Church you talking about shouting and
[1:25:03] dancing speaking in
[1:25:05] Tong I used to run up and down the
[1:25:10] AIS turn the corner with a
[1:25:19] spin but I found out I needed more
[1:25:26] that was good for the
[1:25:29] season but I needed more
[1:25:32] word I I needed
[1:25:36] identification not not that I'm an
[1:25:38] Apostolic
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:41] orti I need
[1:25:44] identification who I was and where I
[1:25:46] came from I need to know who my parents
[1:25:50] were that that that thirsting
[1:25:53] thing Hallelujah I used to read in and
[1:25:56] everything before I came to this
[1:25:59] message because I was looking for
[1:26:02] more
[1:26:04] Hallelujah but I
[1:26:06] heard one
[1:26:10] message and I'll tell you what it
[1:26:11] changed my
[1:26:14] life it was more than just the
[1:26:17] words it was anoint the anointing of the
[1:26:21] word and the
[1:26:24] character the character people can say
[1:26:27] anything they want
[1:26:29] about but he had an extending exing
[1:26:32] character outstanding excuse me an
[1:26:35] outstanding
[1:26:38] character and it was not his
[1:26:41] own it was a character of
[1:26:44] Christ amen amen I don't know how true
[1:26:47] this
[1:26:49] is but a brother who used to fellowship
[1:26:52] with brother Bram and go hunting with
[1:26:57] him me and others a
[1:27:00] story told me and others a story of
[1:27:03] brother
[1:27:06] BR they said that brother Bram they were
[1:27:11] camping and they were
[1:27:14] cooking and this brother got so angry
[1:27:17] with brother
[1:27:18] bradam he he threw the hot grease in his
[1:27:21] face
[1:27:24] brother brandham never
[1:27:27] burned he just wiped his
[1:27:29] face and told the brother he he should
[1:27:32] never do that
[1:27:34] again of course God granted the man
[1:27:38] repentance usually that's a death
[1:27:42] sentence but you see it was a friend of
[1:27:45] brother brand you understand me was an
[1:27:48] enemy so whatever he felt God scared him
[1:27:54] is that
[1:27:56] possible come on I thought everybody
[1:27:58] would say Amen well I I I know something
[1:28:01] greater than
[1:28:03] that I know three Hebrew boys that are
[1:28:06] walk in the
[1:28:16] fire HJ Hallelujah they saw a fourth man
[1:28:20] in the fire you I'm saying we got to
[1:28:24] believe the
[1:28:27] impossible because with the blood of
[1:28:29] Christ we are not limited to this
[1:28:35] Dimension we're
[1:28:37] astronauts we break the sound
[1:28:40] barrier
[1:28:42] not see taste smell
[1:28:46] here hallelujah amen our our six sense
[1:28:50] is faith

[1:32:47] lie and if there's a spirit in you that
[1:32:50] denies that this to be the
[1:32:52] truth then it's not the Holy
[1:32:55] Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the
[1:32:59] word hallelujah hallelujah that's as
[1:33:02] solid as I know how to place
[1:33:05] it it takes death to produce

[1:34:05] make you got it you got to do it
[1:34:10] hallelujah hallelujah you know we too
[1:34:14] busy to
[1:34:18] pray and in the book of Acts
[1:34:24] we
[1:34:25] saw in the book of Acts the power of the
[1:34:30] church was through
[1:34:33] prayer and I heard I think I was Brother
[1:34:35] Rich or
[1:34:37] someone we were talking and they said
[1:34:40] Satan is a a
[1:34:43] warrior and and every good skill
[1:34:50] Warrior
[1:34:52] will
[1:34:54] attack the enemy
[1:34:56] strongholds the most powerful
[1:35:00] weapons concentrate to take
[1:35:06] out and that's exactly what the devil
[1:35:10] did he took out
[1:35:14] prayer hallelujah hallelujah and he took
[1:35:17] out the
[1:35:18] word cuz you can't understand the word
[1:35:21] without
[1:35:22] pray that prayer anointing is what
[1:35:25] anoints that
[1:35:27] word Hall is that right God showing
[1:35:31] himself in
[1:35:33] Simplicity hiding
[1:35:35] himself in dep hallelu to show himself
[1:35:40] again in the
[1:35:42] Resurrection come on folks we're now
[1:35:46] seeing
[1:35:47] it some of those trees out there during
[1:35:50] the winter time look like they were
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:56] dead hallelujah hallelujah but the life
[1:35:59] of the tree is in the
[1:36:02] rock hallelujah hallelujah I I love it
[1:36:06] when the scripture says that Jesus was
[1:36:09] the root of
[1:36:12] David he was the life of
[1:36:15] David Hallelujah he's the root of every
[1:36:19] Christian the life that's in you
[1:36:22] without that
[1:36:24] life there is no
[1:36:26] Resurrection but you must go through
[1:36:29] your spring
[1:36:30] season must go through your fall
[1:36:33] season go through your summer season and
[1:36:37] you must go through your death
[1:36:39] season I believe right now this is the
[1:36:43] season of
[1:36:45] death is that right look at the world
[1:36:48] this is the this is the spirit of destru
[1:36:53] World Angel is
[1:36:55] everywhere but the death angel is only
[1:36:58] given to
[1:37:01] us for us to
[1:37:04] overcome
[1:37:05] amen no
[1:37:08] death no
[1:37:12] Resurrection
[1:37:15] Hallelujah and this is the latter part
[1:37:18] this is the next
[1:37:20] part because I'm going to tell you
[1:37:21] something no matter how religious you
[1:37:25] are you don't have the spirit of
[1:37:28] forgiveness you're lost was that
[1:37:32] amen
[1:37:34] amen yes sir I think we were talking
[1:37:36] about this which inspired
[1:37:39] me because a lot of time we
[1:37:41] think that we have a right to not
[1:37:46] forgive well let me ask you
[1:37:48] something is your crucifixion greater
[1:37:51] than than
[1:37:54] Christ you can't go through half the
[1:37:57] stuff not even a little portion of the
[1:37:59] stuff he went
[1:38:01] through and with all that
[1:38:05] beating and with all that suffering he
[1:38:08] had to go
[1:38:10] through he's up on the
[1:38:12] cross and he said father forgive
[1:38:16] them for they know not what they
[1:38:19] do and brother bam said
[1:38:22] that's the way we ought to handle every
[1:38:24] brother and every
[1:38:26] sister to believe that they don't know
[1:38:28] what they're
[1:38:29] doing it doesn't excuse
[1:38:32] sin but it makes it easier for you
[1:38:36] you're the one that keeps a pure and
[1:38:38] clean
[1:38:40] heart am right your cross is greater
[1:38:44] than
[1:38:49] Christ I had somebody say the other day
[1:38:53] we were out of
[1:38:55] town and they said I can't stand some of
[1:38:58] those
[1:39:02] people and I told him you are a
[1:39:09] murderer you hate your
[1:39:11] brother you hate your sister Jesus says
[1:39:15] you a
[1:39:16] murderer and no murderers were
[1:39:20] waai you got to die you got to rock to
[1:39:23] that oh they did me
[1:39:27] wrong it's
[1:39:29] laughable it's
[1:39:32] laughable think that we can put our
[1:39:34] suffering on the level of Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ we got a right to hold a
[1:39:41] grudge or we' got a right to not
[1:39:45] forgive me ask you a
[1:39:47] question how many times you've sinned
[1:39:50] today
[1:39:52] I'm talking my character building right
[1:39:55] now your cross is greater than
[1:39:59] Christ forgiveness is that
[1:40:03] right amen his disciples said
[1:40:07] Lord how how often should we forgive
[1:40:12] our seven
[1:40:15] times and Jesus
[1:40:18] says
[1:40:19] seven and Jesus said 7 time
[1:40:25] 70 he said No
[1:40:30] Limit No
[1:40:32] Limit you better put yourself in
[1:40:35] that cuz if you had a limit and I had a
[1:40:37] limit we be out by
[1:40:44] nowen thank you
[1:40:48] Lord one thing I know about this
[1:40:51] you got to love
[1:40:53] everybody you might not love their
[1:40:56] character you you might not love the
[1:40:58] things they do but you got to love
[1:41:01] them and love has a certain
[1:41:11] Behavior you say what are you talking
[1:41:14] about love let
[1:41:17] Judas walk up to
[1:41:19] him
[1:41:22] and Jesus called him
[1:41:24] what
[1:41:27] friend let him
[1:41:30] kiss on the neck or whatever they
[1:41:34] do Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:41:38] saying the victory was in
[1:41:42] Jesus because he can't tell you to love
[1:41:44] your enemy if he didn't love
[1:41:47] his but he had first love his enemy
[1:41:52] that's what's wrong with the
[1:41:53] message it ain't the message it's the
[1:41:56] people that haven't been truly born
[1:41:59] again there is no way that you can have
[1:42:02] the Holy Ghost in your
[1:42:04] soul
[1:42:06] somebody no sir no you're not dead
[1:42:11] yet Matthew 18 I'm sorry I got to take
[1:42:14] this time it's I'm almost done Matthew
[1:42:18] 18 we're going to start with the 27
[1:42:36] ver I was telling somebody I says what's
[1:42:39] the
[1:42:41] difference the difference between some
[1:42:45] sins is because some sins are done
[1:42:49] publicly some sins are done in
[1:42:53] secret but are they not all sins in the
[1:42:56] eyes of
[1:43:02] God then the Lord of that servant was
[1:43:05] moved with
[1:43:10] compassion and forgave him his
[1:43:13] debt but the same servant think about it
[1:43:17] you have been forgiven of
[1:43:19] everything the same servant went
[1:43:22] out found one of his fellow
[1:43:27] servants 100 p and he laid hands on
[1:43:32] him and took him by the throat saying
[1:43:36] pay pay me that thou
[1:43:40] owest first of all that guy needed
[1:43:45] character and his fellow
[1:43:48] servant fell down at his feet
[1:43:51] and besought him saying have patience
[1:43:54] with me and I will pay thee
[1:43:59] all and he would not but went and cast
[1:44:03] him into prison until he should pay the
[1:44:08] debt so when the fellow servants saw
[1:44:11] that was
[1:44:12] done were very
[1:44:15] sorry came and told unto their lord all
[1:44:19] that was done
[1:44:24] then his
[1:44:25] Lord after that he had called him
[1:44:29] said oh th Wicked
[1:44:32] servant I forgave thee all that
[1:44:35] death because thou did desired
[1:44:41] me not thou also have compassion on the
[1:44:44] fellow
[1:44:46] servant even as I pity on
[1:44:49] thee
[1:44:51] and his Lord was
[1:44:53] wroth and delivered him to the
[1:44:56] tormentors till he would he should pay
[1:44:59] all that was due unto
[1:45:02] him so likewise shall my heavenly father
[1:45:06] do also unto
[1:45:07] you if ye from your
[1:45:10] heart forgive not everyone his
[1:45:14] brother their
[1:45:17] trespasses and and and and people of God
[1:45:20] I don't want to come journey and I'm
[1:45:23] telling you this because that is a
[1:45:26] issue among the message
[1:45:34] mess I was telling somebody the other
[1:45:37] day even when I've had to take people
[1:45:40] from under the
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:45] blood it was because I loved
[1:45:49] them it was not for
[1:45:52] revenge or to make an example out of
[1:45:57] them because I know if I do not do
[1:46:01] that with a good
[1:46:03] conscience God would judge
[1:46:06] me as a evil
[1:46:11] Steward and some people deserve that
[1:46:14] because when sin gets out of
[1:46:17] hand and you can't bring a person back
[1:46:21] under the
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:23] blood it takes God to break the break
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:30] leg you love the Lord Luke
[1:46:34] 23
[1:46:40] 33-35 I'm almost done with this por this
[1:46:43] is not the end I haven't got to a lot of
[1:46:46] things I want to get
[1:46:49] to
[1:46:52] but I know we've got to kill all the
[1:46:56] fruits of the
[1:46:59] flesh we got to
[1:47:02] die and when they would come to the
[1:47:05] place 33rd
[1:47:08] verse and when they had come to the
[1:47:11] place which is called Calvary They
[1:47:14] Crucified him and the male factors one
[1:47:17] on the right hand and the on the
[1:47:21] left then said Jesus father forgive them
[1:47:26] for they know not what they
[1:47:28] do and they parted their his reignment
[1:47:32] and cast
[1:47:33] lots and the people stood
[1:47:37] beholding and the rulers also with them
[1:47:41] derived
[1:47:43] him he saved others let him save
[1:47:48] himself if he be Christ
[1:47:50] the chosen one he could have saved
[1:47:54] himself hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:47:57] what the scripture tells us I have that
[1:47:59] but I'm just going to close with
[1:48:08] this favor is
[1:48:13] deceitful and beauty is
[1:48:15] vain I'll never forget
[1:48:18] that because people can love
[1:48:22] you and they can have favor with
[1:48:25] you but if you make one
[1:48:29] mistake all that they once
[1:48:32] loved
[1:48:36] disappears especially
[1:48:39] pastors preachers especially people of
[1:48:44] offic
[1:48:46] Hallelujah but one thing I know about
[1:48:49] God
[1:48:50] he never changes his
[1:48:53] attitude toward Those whom he
[1:48:58] L Lord I think by the grace of
[1:49:04] God because of my attitude toward the
[1:49:08] word and I've always wanted to do right
[1:49:11] before
[1:49:13] God I've lost many
[1:49:16] friends but I'd rather know that I'm in
[1:49:18] the will of God
[1:49:22] than to know that I'm in the will of
[1:49:26] men and I think this in order to die to
[1:49:30] yourself you've got to come to a
[1:49:33] place where you care less about what
[1:49:36] people
[1:49:39] think you have to be done led by the
[1:49:42] holy
[1:49:44] spirit amen to do what's
[1:49:48] necessary and and and and I'm I'm saying
[1:49:51] that
[1:49:51] because in our own
[1:49:54] minds we we we we we want to do things a
[1:49:59] certain
[1:50:02] way but the Bible says lean not to your
[1:50:07] own acknowledge the Lord in all your
[1:50:12] ways and he shall direct
[1:50:15] your you love the
[1:50:19] Lord no
[1:50:21] cross no
[1:50:26] crown and that's the order of
[1:50:29] life every seed will bring forth of
[1:50:32] it I'm going going to close so I can go
[1:50:35] on but people of God we are at a place
[1:50:38] right
[1:50:40] now that we must all examine
[1:50:44] ourselves to see whether we be in the
[1:50:47] faith I will never stand
[1:50:51] with
[1:50:52] anyone that won't stand with the
[1:50:56] word
[1:51:02] amen I've
[1:51:04] learned you don't trust
[1:51:07] flesh
[1:51:09] trh don't put your arm in you don't put
[1:51:12] your trust in the arm of
[1:51:15] Flesh you don't trust
[1:51:18] this Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to
[1:51:20] see the
[1:51:23] character and and and and the truth of
[1:51:25] the matter is we forget the enemy you
[1:51:28] know we forget Satan we forget Satan and
[1:51:33] he's the cause of every
[1:51:37] division amen is that the
[1:51:41] truth that's
[1:51:43] it and in
[1:51:45] closing I want to I want to
[1:51:48] emphasize
[1:51:50] you must die you must Rock in order to
[1:51:54] live
[1:51:55] again and all of this come through
[1:51:59] prayer brother Bram says it is a
[1:52:03] mess he said whatever you do in
[1:52:07] desperation he said don't you
[1:52:10] stop don't stop seeking
[1:52:14] God don't settle for these
[1:52:18] Sensations
[1:52:21] I know people in
[1:52:23] denomination who has a gift of
[1:52:27] discernment but they don't know nothing
[1:52:28] about
[1:52:30] this and brother BR told us a man could
[1:52:34] be
[1:52:36] gifted I had a brother in my church in
[1:52:42] L I saw him and that same man split my
[1:52:48] church and and now he doesn't even
[1:52:50] believe the
[1:52:52] message but he was gifted he could
[1:52:56] preach that don't mean
[1:52:58] nothing watch the
[1:53:01] character character means
[1:53:04] everything it is the life of a true
[1:53:07] Christian hallelujah hallelujah you love
[1:53:10] the Lord and you got to watch your
[1:53:13] character that you are producing Christ
[1:53:16] no matter where you go you want people
[1:53:19] to
