[4:14] the service here tonight give us our our
[4:17] eyes to see and ears to hear Lord
[4:21] granted in the name of Jesus Christ give
[4:24] us also a heart to receive and Lord we
[4:27] bless your name in Jesus Christ Christ's
[4:30] name we pray amen you may be
[4:33] seated amen I I found a book today and I
[4:37] was working with uh the 50th uh the
[4:41] Jubilee uh we were having dinner uh
[4:44] brother Keith and I with brother RI and
[4:46] he was mentioning that last night and
[4:49] somehow it kind of stuck with me and uh
[4:52] you know um I I I found a nice book and
[4:56] I have to share that later but then I I
[4:59] went to the bonds and noas over
[5:01] University today trying to find that
[5:03] book I looked everywhere in places I
[5:05] thought would be the book and um in
[5:08] places that perhaps it would not have
[5:09] been but you know uh sometimes they
[5:12] stick things where uh it shouldn't be
[5:14] but nevertheless it was a new book and I
[5:17] figured you know maybe uh you know I was
[5:19] looking in the sports section
[5:21] and everywhere even on the new books
[5:24] table and you know because um all I
[5:27] needed to see was the Queen of England
[5:30] because basically they're celebrating uh
[5:33] a 50th year
[5:35] anniversary and uh uh as a queen I
[5:38] believe it is um but nevertheless amen
[5:41] they're celebrating and her name is
[5:43] Elizabeth so I I there were some things
[5:45] I kind of wanted to look up under that
[5:47] and did get a chance to do it but in the
[5:49] book that I did receive or did
[5:52] buy uh it's it's basically talking about
[5:56] 1963 and the change of America
[6:00] and you know it it uh it it says amen
[6:06] like on the third or fourth page of the
[6:08] book celebrating the first modern
[6:14] president and of course uh President
[6:17] John Kennedy was the youngest president
[6:21] ever
[6:22] elected during that
[6:24] time and you might wonder why I'm
[6:27] bringing this up because they're now
[6:30] celebrating this 50th year of of uh this
[6:35] uh president and
[6:38] his wife and in the book they've got uh
[6:43] several things going on they talk about
[6:47] during this time it was the new frontier
[6:51] in space and we realize that because
[6:54] brother brandham talk about the Sputnik
[6:56] and and all of them running to the moon
[6:58] and all of that stuff stuff but we
[7:02] understand by the grace of God brother
[7:03] Brandon brought the spiritual
[7:04] application out of that and showed amen
[7:08] that we were now entering in what you
[7:11] call the space age or the bride age amen
[7:16] because we know that the eagle is not a
[7:19] Earthbound bird so so many things were
[7:23] happening in that time uh the Cold War
[7:26] and Peace and y'all remember the cubic
[7:28] crisis well some of y'all don't but I do
[7:31] amen and you know how uh things went on
[7:36] how things became glamorous in the
[7:40] 1963 women really excelled in Beauty uh
[7:44] because of cosmetics and all of this
[7:47] other kind of stuff The Cutting of the
[7:49] hair and whatever more they did uh do to
[7:52] themselves amen and we understand even
[7:55] in that uh uh time the that uh
[8:00] our president uh Kennedy was uh
[8:04] assassinated now a lot of these things
[8:06] you probably wondering why I'm bringing
[8:07] to the
[8:08] Forefront um it's because these things
[8:12] happened to America because we rejected
[8:17] the gospel brother Brandon preached a
[8:19] message uh Jubilee and he also preached
[8:22] another message return to Jubilee and he
[8:26] was there in Louisiana when he preached
[8:29] this message message and he talked about
[8:31] the Holy Ghost falling in such a
[8:33] powerful way down in
[8:35] Louisiana and and he's now
[8:38] rebuking the same church that the Holy
[8:42] Ghost once had leadership over and he
[8:45] was telling them how they had left uh
[8:48] their first love and now they have
[8:50] become
[8:52] worldly and uh you know but he he goes
[8:56] on to say uh how that they what they
[9:00] used to be you know and when we see uh
[9:05] the world moving one way we find out
[9:08] that the church began to move too
[9:11] because in the 60s the Industrial Age
[9:15] and and the roads and and everything
[9:17] began to uh really multiply and the
[9:20] people began to multiply and the reason
[9:24] why is because God had already staged
[9:27] this thing and and though the Baby
[9:29] Boomers look like it would have been a
[9:31] problem they began to multiply multiply
[9:34] and multiply amen because amen and with
[9:38] the riches amen now we see uh those who
[9:41] were once poor moving into the middle
[9:44] class amen and you got to understand
[9:48] that a country is judged by the church
[9:53] right however the church is
[9:55] behaving it is what what it is the thing
[9:58] that brings God's
[10:01] judgment y'all hear what I'm saying and
[10:04] uh you know I learned that I think
[10:05] brother Keith and I were talking and he
[10:07] brought something like that up and I I
[10:09] had never seen it before someone who I
[10:10] was talking with and I thought that is
[10:13] so true you know because I realize amen
[10:17] God only cares about his
[10:21] own his own's
[10:23] behavor is that all right now I want you
[10:26] to understand this Sodom and gomor
[10:29] always
[10:31] existed and God never judged them but
[10:35] when lot went down and his crew is that
[10:38] right and conformed to that lifestyle
[10:41] then God was upset
[10:44] amen that's the way it goes if the
[10:47] church would have held their grounds in
[10:50] the 60s America as we know it would not
[10:53] be the way it is
[10:55] now but because we got worldly now God
[10:58] is upset
[11:00] amen come on somebody he's upset amen
[11:04] with America let's put it the way God is
[11:06] upset with the world because the Bible
[11:09] said that if the salt had lost had if
[11:12] the salt loses savior what good is it if
[11:15] if the Christian lose their strength and
[11:18] their power what good is it
[11:21] amen the thing that I love the Bible
[11:24] says I am the Lord and I change not that
[11:27] means what he did yesterday he'll do
[11:29] again today y'all hear what I'm saying
[11:32] see we you know you say well I believe
[11:35] that that that uh uh this city uh is
[11:38] blessed because we're
[11:41] here and as long as this little
[11:43] Fellowship holds the standard of
[11:46] Holiness the Judgment of God cannot fall
[11:50] on this
[11:53] city it is only when we began to
[11:57] compromise and began to get become
[11:59] worldly God then takes judgment where
[12:04] first on the church because the Bible
[12:06] said that judgment begins at the house
[12:09] of God and then where will the Sinner
[12:12] and the ungodly
[12:14] appear see God Amen looks at us because
[12:18] you got to realize amen the serpent was
[12:21] already always in the garden right he
[12:24] was as evil as he ever was but he never
[12:27] was judged until he contaminated Adam
[12:30] and Eve then judgment came is that right
[12:34] see so you got to understand we are the
[12:40] preservers Hallelujah he changes
[12:43] not Israel was a prosperous Nation right
[12:47] God couldn't curse Israel because amen
[12:50] she was prosperous she was blessed but
[12:53] when balam came and said that listen you
[12:55] and Moab are the same and Israel
[12:58] believed that and then began to move
[13:00] into that channel then God judged Israel
[13:05] with
[13:06] Moab
[13:08] amen see what I'm saying so look the
[13:12] Bible tells us according to Isaiah 45:22
[13:16] look unto me and be ye shaved all the
[13:19] ends of the Earth for I am God and there
[13:23] is none
[13:25] else hello there's none else remember of
[13:29] the for former things of old now if we
[13:31] can look at the former things of old we
[13:34] can see how God is when it comes to his
[13:38] people yes
[13:40] sir as long as we hold our ground hey
[13:43] come on somebody it's like that even in
[13:45] our own families it's like that on your
[13:48] job if you work diligently on your job
[13:51] and hold a Christian standard don't you
[13:53] know your job will be blessed amen
[13:55] because God is going to bless
[13:57] you amen so in order to bless you he's
[14:00] got to bless your job
[14:03] amen
[14:05] amen so wherever you don't believe that
[14:08] that's true that is so true Egypt never
[14:12] was as blessed as they were when Joseph
[14:14] came
[14:15] through Hallelujah Joseph Egypt blessed
[14:19] the whole of Joseph I mean God blessed
[14:22] the whole of Egypt because of Joseph
[14:26] amen and a lot of time God the don't
[14:29] want you placees because wherever you go
[14:31] it becomes
[14:34] blessed so he gives you a hard
[14:37] time Hallelujah ain't God good to us
[14:41] listen I want you to understand because
[14:43] you got to understand we are now looking
[14:45] at the 50th year of this
[14:49] message hello this is a Year of Jubilee
[14:53] all the fighters practically are dead
[14:57] amen come on somebody all of the
[15:00] fighters are practically dead all of
[15:02] those who caused camps in this message
[15:05] those who broke up Brotherhood and
[15:07] change things for their own benefit are
[15:11] dead we don't have to worry about this
[15:14] Doctrine and that Doctrine and this
[15:16] Doctrine now amen we're getting ready to
[15:18] see the waters overflow amen y'all hear
[15:22] what I'm saying sir the prophet of God
[15:24] tells us amen that those little
[15:25] ducklings they wanted to Fellowship but
[15:27] they couldn't Fellowship because of the
[15:29] the wall of the fence he said but when
[15:31] it came a flood oh it lifted them up and
[15:35] they got together amen so now that the
[15:37] enemy now that the fighters are dead
[15:40] it's about time to cross the Jordan amen
[15:43] but understand the Jordan can't be
[15:45] crossable until the flood waters are
[15:48] ready flood waters represent people
[15:51] that's right until the squeeze come on
[15:54] somebody it has to be crossed over at a
[15:57] time when the blood waters are great
[16:01] amen good
[16:04] amen oh it won't be easy see that's what
[16:08] it is a lot of times people think it's
[16:10] going to be easy but I tell you what we
[16:11] got Joshua leading us hallelujah we've
[16:15] got Joshua leading us and he's got the
[16:17] instruction so do we
[16:21] amen is that okay I want you to
[16:25] understand what the Jubilee is about
[16:27] some of us we've heard this a minute
[16:29] times but you know I want you to
[16:32] understand what why Kennedy had to be
[16:34] first of all let me go back up Kennedy
[16:36] had to be voted
[16:38] president he had to be because he was a
[16:42] Catholic and the Catholic church has to
[16:45] rule America right so God had to use a
[16:49] man like brother bam said they used to
[16:51] sneak through the back door but once
[16:54] Kennedy became president they started
[16:55] coming through the front door now guess
[16:58] what
[16:59] America in 50 years has now become a
[17:02] Catholic Nation that's right
[17:05] amen hello and brother bman 50 years ago
[17:09] said Jezebel was the one that was
[17:12] ruling huh not Miss Kennedy the woman
[17:16] that was greater than Miss Kennedy which
[17:18] was the Catholic church right he said
[17:21] basically that all President Kennedy was
[17:23] was a pond or a puppet in her
[17:26] hands and all of the presidents
[17:29] afterwards
[17:33] amen whenever uh H the Sabbath or the
[17:37] year Jubilee was so
[17:40] important it was precious and if if I we
[17:45] we have seen in history what happened to
[17:48] Israel and I think uh I forgot what
[17:50] brother brought this out which was so
[17:52] true Israel failed to keep the Sabbath
[17:57] of God for 4 90 years that's how corrupt
[18:00] they had
[18:04] become 490 years of
[18:07] neglect that's
[18:09] 70
[18:11] sabbaths and because they fail to keep
[18:14] God's Sabbath God said I'm going to
[18:17] judge you and I'm going to let Babylon
[18:20] take you into judgment and you're going
[18:22] the land will rest for 70 years the same
[18:27] Sabbath you didn't give I'm I'm going to
[18:29] take it from you
[18:31] amen amen huh and that's what God did to
[18:35] Israel and that's what God will do to us
[18:38] amen whenever we fail to enter into the
[18:41] Sabbath amen there is a
[18:45] judgment now let me explain to you
[18:48] because this message is our
[18:50] Sabbath hello it is the entrance into
[18:55] our rest and that's what Paul according
[18:58] to Hebrews say labor to enter it that's
[19:01] what I can't get over you can't go by by
[19:04] bypass Paul's word he said labor to
[19:08] enter into your rest
[19:14] amen hallelujah your Jubilee come on
[19:17] somebody because we have come seven
[19:19] Church ages oh come on somebody and
[19:23] realized by the grace of God when God
[19:26] came and the Holy Ghost returned which
[19:28] was the token life it was for you and I
[19:31] to enter into it failure to enter into
[19:36] it will cause judgment yes sir amen is
[19:40] that right remember when they
[19:43] were when the Year of Jubilee sounded
[19:47] that mean you can go free you drop your
[19:50] hole you drop your rake wherever you
[19:52] were I mean that me you can go free but
[19:55] now in you if you're in the wall City
[19:56] you can't hear it right right so what
[20:00] happened was God before he sounded the
[20:04] Jubilee trumpet he made sure that those
[20:07] who were in The W those who were not
[20:09] elected were in the wall City they had
[20:12] already rejected the message of their
[20:14] age but when the seals were broken they
[20:17] couldn't hear it's time for you to go
[20:21] free now watch this
[20:25] because even in the time when uh
[20:29] uh in in in 1963 when when the word was
[20:36] opened we've got to realize that this
[20:38] was a now a new
[20:40] generation the old generation perished
[20:43] in the
[20:44] wilderness yes they did but now this
[20:48] thing repeats
[20:51] itself right because we find out Israel
[20:54] and Israel is a sure
[20:56] example right Joshua never pointed the
[21:00] people to himself he always pointed them
[21:03] to God and God made sure Joshua know
[21:07] knew he was in control that God was in
[21:10] control and Joshua was just a servant of
[21:13] the Lord that's right Amen brother
[21:17] bandam tells us that this Jubilee
[21:19] trumpet can only be heard by
[21:23] children because it is the children who
[21:26] hears the voice of return amen come on
[21:30] somebody if you're a servant you don't
[21:33] even understand it but if you a son or
[21:37] daughter that means you can go free
[21:40] because you're the one with the
[21:42] inheritance oh my Lord you're the one
[21:45] that has the inheritance whether it be
[21:49] housing or land or children or what
[21:52] because in 50 years often time you got
[21:55] in trouble sometime financially and you
[21:58] had to become the borrower instead of
[22:01] the lender and there were times amen
[22:04] that you you had to lot off of pro part
[22:07] of your property or something just to
[22:08] pay somebody else off but when that Year
[22:11] of Jubilee came that meant everything
[22:14] was released amen now if you had become
[22:18] a slave because of of something your
[22:22] parent had done or whatever the case may
[22:23] be amen uh you had a right to go free
[22:27] amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying but
[22:29] if you loved your master y'all know the
[22:32] story if you loved your Taskmaster and
[22:35] didn't want to go free hello if you love
[22:39] the demon that have you enslaved and you
[22:42] don't want to go
[22:44] free come on somebody then what God will
[22:47] do was bore your ear and that means that
[22:51] trumpet will never be sounded for you
[22:54] again and you'll go straight to wherever
[22:57] you going with that
[23:00] demon enslaving
[23:03] you because you made a choice of not
[23:07] going
[23:10] free it's 50 years
[23:14] now this is the Jubilee year of the
[23:18] message we have heard and we have seen
[23:21] our inheritance we know we're Sons but
[23:26] it's still up to you amen your desire to
[23:29] go free
[23:32] amen come on
[23:35] somebody right you see God ain't
[23:37] dwelling in a group of CH a crowd God
[23:40] doesn't dwell in a crowd God dwells in a
[23:43] humble heart you as an
[23:46] individual you must hear this sound you
[23:49] must know you can go free why what good
[23:53] is this message to us if it's not going
[23:56] to declare our Liberty amen Jesus
[23:59] declared I've come to set the captive
[24:01] [Music]
[24:05] free I was thinking
[24:08] how those who were under the prophets
[24:12] Ministry they saw the son of man but
[24:15] they missed the coming of
[24:18] Christ and that's why so many people are
[24:21] stumbling you know I was telling
[24:23] somebody today cuz you know all those
[24:26] rumors and stuff going about the dates
[24:27] and all that I say what who care I don't
[24:31] need to investigate any of that I don't
[24:33] care about
[24:37] dates whether it was here there or
[24:39] Yonder I don't care I know where it is
[24:43] now I could care less if he if he if he
[24:47] hunted on a on a day that that the law
[24:49] said listen didn't Jesus disciples eat
[24:52] cor that's right am didn't they go in
[24:54] somebody else's
[24:56] field who's who who's who's ahead of all
[25:00] of these laws
[25:01] Hallelujah God is God is not bound by

[25:26] ever to me is Blas blemy and you know
[25:29] what brother brandom said to reject the
[25:31] message of your day is blasphemy against
[25:33] the Holy Ghost he said to come into the
[25:36] knowledge of Truth and rejected is
[25:42] blasphemy help us
[25:45] Lord listen and think about it on that
[25:48] seventh day which is the Sabbath rest
[25:52] don't you know or that seventh year they
[25:54] were not supposed to plant the land was
[25:57] supposed to rest
[25:59] right I love that why because man had no
[26:04] no no no uh put it this way but it
[26:08] didn't stop the seeds from growing
[26:12] amen the seeds grew up
[26:15] itself because they were already planted
[26:18] amen so what are you saying I'm saying
[26:21] that Sabbath year takes Man Hands away
[26:25] from
[26:25] labor but it puts it all in the hands of
[26:29] God woo come on somebody you see and
[26:32] that's what this message has done to us
[26:34] is taking our hands off of it and it's
[26:37] now plac it in the hands of God and you
[26:40] and I don't have to worry about the seed
[26:43] because the seed will be planted and God
[26:45] has already planted and on the Sabbath
[26:48] God will cause it the water to be
[26:50] increased and everything God
[26:53] Amen and the Bible tells us amen that
[26:57] that that uh on that Sabbath year that
[26:59] that year of rest when the when they
[27:01] didn't the farmers didn't have to plant
[27:03] or they didn't have to prune nothing he
[27:05] said that Harvest or that that that
[27:08] those seeds that would grow of itself
[27:11] was for
[27:12] everybody if you were poor it if you was
[27:15] rich come on somebody amen if you was a
[27:18] stranger if you was a cattle if you was
[27:21] a beast if you was a servant you can go
[27:24] and you can Feast off the field ain't
[27:27] that what the bride for come on somebody
[27:30] the bride amen is God increase
[27:36] amen now I don't understand it but I
[27:39] look at these things and I find out that
[27:42] the people of God have such a strong um
[27:45] how can I say it they have a problem I
[27:48] was telling somebody I said you know
[27:50] what I said so many people have seen
[27:52] brother brandham and they failed to see
[27:54] Elijah now I want you to understand the
[27:56] spirit of Elijah was God God himself the
[27:59] spirit of Elijah is the Holy Ghost
[28:02] himself amen they said well the spirit
[28:04] of Elijah came five times it's still the
[28:06] Holy Ghost yes sir amen it ain't no you
[28:10] get to heaven ain't going to be no
[28:11] Spirit of Elijah it's going to be the
[28:13] Holy Ghost Amen in in that spir or in
[28:16] that Ministry he called Elijah
[28:20] amen the only difference between the
[28:22] spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Moses
[28:24] is the name that God call him and what
[28:26] the ministry is to do it's still the
[28:28] Holy
[28:34] Ghost Moses going to have to have the
[28:37] Holy Ghost and Elijah will too Moses
[28:39] will do the ministry of Moses and Elijah
[28:42] would do the ministry of Elijah but
[28:43] it'll still be the same God Amen in
[28:46] different offices that's
[28:49] all you know people want to make it so
[28:52] difficult it ain't nothing difficult
[28:53] about it amen call it the son of man or
[28:57] the the Son of God or the Holy Ghost is
[28:59] still God it's him ain't one two or
[29:02] three same God working in a different
[29:06] dispensation that's
[29:11] it but that's what happened that's why
[29:14] when the man William Brandon would say
[29:16] something humanistic or something that a
[29:19] human would do or do something and they
[29:20] said well Elijah made a mistake Elijah
[29:23] didn't make a mistake Elijah was God
[29:26] when God spoke through the man it never
[29:28] was a mistake
[29:29] amen but brother brandom still was a man
[29:33] right many times he said I'm waiting on
[29:35] him him who Elijah yes
[29:39] sir God how
[29:42] you I don't understand that why people
[29:45] get so confused I said the problem is
[29:48] they kept seeing Elijah I mean uh
[29:51] brother brandham and not not seeing the
[29:53] spirit behind him that was the
[29:54] difference between Joshua and Caleb
[29:56] Joshua and Caleb could see Moses yet
[29:59] they could see God behind Moses that's
[30:03] right that's why they didn't get
[30:05] confused all this man no they knew it
[30:08] was God behind the
[30:09] [Music]
[30:10] veil they saw Moses when he got upset
[30:14] but they knew that was
[30:15] Moses
[30:19] amen come on somebody didn't that
[30:21] brother BR tried to tell us he said when
[30:23] Elijah said Lord send down the fire he
[30:25] said that was a man's spirit
[30:29] but God being that it was God's Prophet
[30:30] God honored it when God got Elijah got
[30:34] mad at those uh those children called
[30:36] saying go up you Baldhead go up you
[30:38] Baldhead and he said that bear came to
[30:40] eat him up he said that that was that
[30:42] was a man getting
[30:45] upset that's why when his disciples in
[30:47] the New Testament said Lord call S down
[30:49] the fire Jesus said you don't know what
[30:51] Spirit you
[30:54] are see and that's what people don't
[30:57] understand I said all they got to do is
[30:59] get the Holy
[31:00] Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you ain't
[31:02] going to have a problem with this
[31:04] message that's right you'll know it's
[31:06] the right you'll know and understand
[31:07] it's right you're not going to struggle
[31:09] with
[31:11] it just like I tell people I said they
[31:13] still lying on Jesus they still saying
[31:16] Amen in the Jewish Community somebody
[31:18] came by and stole his
[31:21] body what you going to believe the word
[31:24] or or some
[31:26] lie you know you look at these things
[31:29] I'm just saying now because I want you
[31:31] to understand the only way and come on
[31:33] people let's deal with
[31:36] reality we're not where we should
[31:40] be but you know what has happened this
[31:44] message got cooled off they got lazy
[31:48] things got
[31:49] easy right the persecutions practically
[31:53] stopped there was a time am me oh I you
[31:56] follow a prophet you know you were
[31:58] persecuted you were really ridicule but
[32:00] now we blending
[32:04] in come on somebody and I'm going get to
[32:07] something in just a moment listen it
[32:09] took a mighty Russian win then it's
[32:12] going to take a mighty Russian win now
[32:14] amen the same holy ghost that fell on
[32:17] the zusu street oh you think they got it
[32:19] easy do you really think they got it
[32:22] easily no sir no sir brother bham said
[32:27] this like this he said um he said the
[32:29] persecution always gives strength to the
[32:30] church he said we've had it too easy we
[32:34] get slothful we get to a place where we
[32:36] don't want to move on because everything
[32:39] just handed to us it takes sorrows and
[32:42] tears and sweat and prayer and Faith
[32:46] amen and promise to move forward in the
[32:49] power of the Holy Ghost I'm going to say
[32:51] it
[32:54] again it takes sorrows and te tears and
[32:59] sweat and prayer and faith and promise
[33:03] to move forward in the power of the Holy
[33:06] Ghost the Zeal and power that they had
[33:09] in those days has long time vanished
[33:12] from our
[33:13] assemblies I'm afraid if the windows
[33:16] would be shut out tonight CU he talked
[33:19] about it he talked about it in a a
[33:21] paragraph above he said in the olden
[33:23] days he said he T people would come in
[33:26] and shoot into the windows of the
[33:28] services and the bullets would bounce
[33:30] off the people wouldn't even hurt them
[33:32] he said but I'm so afraid now oh he said
[33:34] listen he said listen he said I'm afraid
[33:37] if the windows would be shut out tonight
[33:39] people run everywhere and never come
[33:41] back
[33:42] again and he's telling the truth they'll
[33:45] run and not come back again and even in
[33:48] the organization I came out of they had
[33:50] the same kind of experience of a husband
[33:54] getting mad with his wife come to church
[33:56] and while they worshiping he's shooting
[33:59] and they find bullets at the end of the
[34:00] service on the floor nobody was pierced
[34:03] or hurt because they were so under the
[34:05] anointing of God hallelujah and I'm
[34:08] telling you that makes me jealous to
[34:11] know that even under that inspiration
[34:14] they had the power of God and Satan
[34:17] couldn't
[34:18] penetrate that's the real Holy
[34:25] Ghost that's what we got to have here
[34:28] this little service that we be having
[34:30] and everybody complacent with it is not
[34:32] good enough for me I want to see God the
[34:35] pillar of fire moving this place heal
[34:37] and deliver every soul in here but it
[34:40] can't be done by the pastor one or two
[34:42] it's got to be
[34:43] Unity we've got to all desire the same
[34:46] thing that's how the Holy Ghost came on
[34:49] the day of pity because 120 people got
[34:51] together there's not 120 people in
[34:55] here and if they could do it we can do
[34:58] it amen but we going to have to all chip
[35:01] in on this thing you know join together
[35:03] as a body and just seek God with all our
[35:05] with our whole face Desiring God to come
[35:09] in this place like he's never done it
[35:11] before is that right God did not send
[35:14] this place this this uh he did not send
[35:18] me here amen just just to minister to
[35:21] people who going to be missed or lost or
[35:24] or or left
[35:25] behind amen
[35:30] this is our Jubilee this is our time our
[35:33] fear that if we wait to next year it
[35:36] might be closed am there's not another
[35:40] church age after us
[35:43] amen after the first Jubilee amen 1906
[35:48] to 1956 what
[35:50] happened God came along is that right a
[35:54] new message was
[35:55] beginning America rejected rejected her
[35:58] Jubilee judgment came down the woes of
[36:01] of Tri of of of uh Revelation fell by
[36:05] Rock and Roll by War all the Wes come
[36:09] right
[36:10] down plague the people cancer
[36:14] tuberculosis all these things fell
[36:16] because America amen rejected the gospel
[36:19] and the church that started on theu
[36:21] Street had now
[36:23] organized and had become worldly and God
[36:27] judged the world because of the church
[36:33] amen and now we come to it again look at
[36:37] the message we in bad
[36:39] shape as a whole come on all over the
[36:42] world we got churches up there in
[36:43] Minnesota that won't even fellowship
[36:45] with each other because of some
[36:47] silliness come on somebody it's true I
[36:51] mean not just there in everywhere you go
[36:54] it's the same nonsense and we look at
[36:57] denomination as if they're the ones that
[36:59] that had problems we got problems the
[37:02] same Devils that was in Egypt and
[37:04] followed us out here and we're doing the
[37:06] same thing it's going to take somebody
[37:09] somewhere to raise up a standard cuz the
[37:12] Bible said when the enemy comes in like
[37:14] a flood amen God will lift up a standard
[37:17] there got to be somebody amen that's
[37:19] going to lift up a standard and tell
[37:21] them listen you've been
[37:22] wrong it's time to get up out of here
[37:26] but if you're in a wall City if you in a
[37:28] city or you that's why I don't want
[37:29] nobody to think I'm so great because
[37:31] there are so many people who believe
[37:33] that they're in this message that if
[37:35] they leave certain churches because of
[37:37] the pastor's way of Ministry they can't
[37:39] be saved or won't make a Rapture
[37:42] nonsense that's what denomination
[37:45] teaches
[37:47] amen and in this message that's exactly
[37:50] where it is because of the way people
[37:52] preaches and you know because of their
[37:54] deliverances people have now raised up
[37:57] uh uh uh Dayan and
[38:03] corus it won't be
[38:06] here my point is people of God there's
[38:09] no way that we can sit still with our
[38:12] souls hanging in the
[38:17] balance Jubilee year was a serious year
[38:20] you either stayed with your slave master
[38:22] or you got free now the the trumpet is
[38:24] blowing tonight what you going to do
[38:26] about it every one of us got some demons
[38:28] to be loosed and freed from hallelujah
[38:31] hallelujah come on somebody I don't care
[38:34] if it's just a small demon
[38:37] amen that's right amen it's got to
[38:41] go leave everything behind drop it you
[38:44] say I don't know how to I don't know how
[38:46] to get free listen I'm holding this book
[38:49] this book ain't holding me I'm holding
[38:51] it
[38:53] amen in reality a demon ain't holding
[38:56] you you hold holding it
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] come on somebody cuz he ain't nothing
[39:01] but a squat on your land and you letting
[39:04] him stay there you got to enforcer who
[39:07] is the Holy
[39:09] Ghost oh come on somebody is that right
[39:13] oh you see what brother was where's that
[39:15] in the word first of all you can go to
[39:17] Joel God said all that the the years
[39:21] that the pomor the cankerworm the Locust
[39:23] and the caterpillars eaten away from you
[39:25] bride tree I shall rest
[39:28] that means I shall
[39:30] restore amen and restore means to bring
[39:34] back to its original state of being God
[39:37] said I shall restore amen that's a law
[39:41] of God Amen he promise he restore it
[39:45] that's what he's trying to do now
[39:46] through the message of the hour restore
[39:49] us back to our original state amen but
[39:52] Lon let me tell you something that it
[39:53] doesn't make any difference I I I I
[39:56] heard the prophet of God said like this
[39:58] without the holy ghost in a church
[40:00] you're just a Blasphemous
[40:02] name you claim to be something that
[40:05] you're
[40:08] not huh yeah go listen go go go listen
[40:13] to uh uh the bride tree and hear some of
[40:15] the things he say on that restoration of
[40:17] the Bride tree it'll blow your mind amen
[40:21] because he realized you got you and I we
[40:23] can't just leave stay here in this
[40:25] position right you say oh brother why
[40:28] listen he goes on to say he said God's
[40:31] laws everything is set upon God's
[40:35] laws is that right everything is set
[40:38] upon God's law he said listen he said it
[40:41] doesn't matter what death caus during
[40:43] the winter the law of God said when the
[40:46] Sun and the Earth come into Unity again
[40:49] or
[40:50] alignment God will cause those things
[40:53] that were dead to come back to life amen
[40:57] and he said at that Springtime he said
[40:59] that's that's that seed juvilee it was
[41:02] in prison it was dead it was held by
[41:05] death Hallelujah but when the Sun s o in
[41:09] strikes it it's got to come God will
[41:13] restore and that's the problem he said
[41:15] he said as long as we are away from him
[41:18] we we're in the winter time we're in the
[41:20] fall time as long as we're away from him
[41:23] that seed will lay there dead it might
[41:26] break open it might spew out he said but
[41:28] if you come back to God you return back
[41:31] to God like the Earth returns back to
[41:34] the sun amen and that son causes
[41:37] everything that was dead to come back to
[41:39] life
[41:42] amen so the problem is not with the Sun
[41:46] the problem is with the Earth coming
[41:49] back in
[41:50] alignment coming back around and getting
[41:53] closer the closer you get to him the
[41:55] harder you get
[41:58] Hallelujah that's a
[42:01] law he said what what he said restore
[42:04] what the winter
[42:06] kills when the Earth get back in that
[42:08] position right see what I'm saying and I
[42:12] wrote down here the sun shall rise on
[42:13] thee that sleep and I love that because
[42:17] if if if the son if if that's not true
[42:22] uh in nature the law of nature proves
[42:25] the
[42:26] resurrection you see what I'm saying the
[42:28] laws of nature proves the resurrection
[42:32] and God set that law that we might be it
[42:34] might be visibly seen because you and I
[42:37] we can look through a seed all day and
[42:39] never find the
[42:41] life right a dog can't tell me how I
[42:44] feel unless he's born a
[42:47] man and you can't understand what a Son
[42:49] of God is until you born a Son of
[42:54] God right so those law are out there for
[42:58] us but this is our Jubilee and what did
[43:01] the prophet of God say when he left off
[43:03] the scene lay in the presence of the son
[43:07] so that you can be what ripened amen
[43:10] took it right back to the S so n and the
[43:13] Su in because that's the only place you
[43:15] can get right right in the word of God
[43:18] right in hearing he said that's why he
[43:20] said when you see that they approach and
[43:22] come together the more don't slack off
[43:25] like a lot of people they follow way and
[43:27] don't even know it a lot of people don't
[43:30] even know what year we in this is a
[43:33] serious year do you really think amen
[43:36] that this is coincident that the very
[43:38] day and time and and month the seals
[43:42] being open fell on the same time day and
[43:45] month the
[43:47] same 50 years
[43:51] later but now the house of God means
[43:53] what the house of God is going to be
[43:56] judged amen you'll be judged if you
[43:59] don't go free if you don't get a
[44:01] desperation yes sir amen and I'll be
[44:04] honest with you if I heard a jubilee
[44:07] sound and I was a slave do you think I
[44:10] won't even consult the
[44:15] master oh it's gone amen and you think
[44:19] I'm going to walk oh I'm on my way home
[44:21] no sir I'm a
[44:24] run and that's what God saying we ought
[44:26] to be excited about our
[44:29] inheritance what is our inheritance
[44:34] everything it's everything the devil
[44:37] know he's your
[44:38] slave the devil knows he's under you am
[44:41] we must learn he's under
[44:45] us it take consecration folks like I
[44:48] said Blood Sweat and
[44:49] Tears it does that's right it's going to
[44:53] take some serious serious getting down
[44:55] to prayer
[44:57] hallelujah amen he said listen that is
[45:01] him the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit the
[45:02] spirit of God that comes in power and
[45:05] Resurrection to prove that Jesus Christ
[45:07] is not dead but he's alive and ready to
[45:10] return for his
[45:14] church he said in this day they still
[45:16] saying who is this whenever we've ever
[45:19] had a service it's been a long time
[45:21] we've had such a service where the Holy
[45:23] Ghost is in in in complete control and
[45:25] people shouting and dancing and running
[45:27] and and and you
[45:28] know you say that ain't all it but
[45:31] that's a part of it and it's good when
[45:33] it
[45:34] comes when God just comes in and just
[45:36] you know when I was up in New Jersey my
[45:38] wife would tell you it came through the
[45:40] church in waves so don't tell me it
[45:42] doesn't exist and don't tell me it's all
[45:44] over but there's a people up there in
[45:46] New York know they can't survive without
[45:48] prayer hello they're not like here in
[45:51] Demon where things see so laxy Daisy
[45:54] they have to stay in the anointing and
[45:56] presence of God us to be saved in New
[45:58] York Hallelujah so they call on God and
[46:02] they get results but that doesn't stop
[46:04] us from calling on
[46:08] God one of the worst things you can do
[46:10] is wait till your gas tank get empty to
[46:12] try to fill it
[46:16] up it's empty it's on empty and you
[46:18] praying oh Lord help me no uhh
[46:21] especially when you got money to fill it
[46:23] up you don't wait till it get empty on E
[46:26] I've done it before and I'm like oh Lord
[46:28] help me but that's not a good time to
[46:31] get it filled it's when you see a half
[46:34] tank or whatever and you got a station
[46:36] that's convenient get it
[46:39] done am I making sense you don't want oh
[46:42] Lord feel me now I'm on empty you should
[46:45] never as a Christian allow yourself to
[46:47] become empty
[46:53] amen that's what he said this spirit is
[46:56] coming and instead even in this little
[46:58] church we don't have enough fellowship
[46:59] with one another everybody got their own
[47:01] little clicks and that's wrong people
[47:03] I'm telling you it's wrong you and I
[47:05] when God put us all here to be perfected
[47:08] there are things amen about you that you
[47:10] that uh I might not like and things
[47:12] about me that you might not like but God
[47:14] said you you Fellowship amen that's what
[47:16] it's all about it is to cut and and to
[47:19] break off and to get off those don't
[47:21] like things out because you and I got to
[47:23] love each other and we going to be
[47:24] spending eternity with each other anyhow
[47:27] hello somebody we don't do enough of it
[47:32] here come on we try to have little GI
[47:35] togethers and everybody got their
[47:36] personal issues and going this way and
[47:38] going that way and don't even know that
[47:40] those little personal those little
[47:41] fellowships are ordained by
[47:43] God come together the more don't mean
[47:46] that you got to have church all the time
[47:48] come together the more to Fellowship to
[47:51] learn of each
[47:52] other come on somebody God took 12 hard
[47:56] heads put them all together and say
[47:58] you're my disciples learn how to deal
[48:00] with
[48:02] it and they didn't always get alone
[48:05] hello and they were always different
[48:07] ones in competition even at the Holy
[48:10] Ghost they still had problems Lord amen
[48:14] but that's who God
[48:19] chose hello
[48:22] Unity
[48:24] Unity is more than just sitting together
[48:26] in church say we going to the same
[48:28] assembly we're family and we're more
[48:31] blood related with each other than we
[48:33] are with our natural fam at least that's
[48:35] the way it's supposed to be Ezekiel 23
[48:39] please and I'm not I'm going cut on this
[48:41] CU I'll finish this off
[48:44] later I'm talking about Jubilee how and
[48:47] I'm going to tell you something people
[48:48] you know what it is it's the lack of the
[48:50] Holy
[48:51] Ghost that's the problem here and the
[48:53] problem everywhere is the lack of the
[48:55] Holy Ghost cuz when the Holy Ghost the
[48:58] Holy Ghost there ain't no way the Holy
[49:00] Ghost ain't going
[49:01] to put it this way cause you to love and
[49:05] to feel compassion for your brothers and
[49:07] sisters they ain't going to it ain't
[49:08] going to happen and all of us are
[49:12] guilty all of us are
[49:18] guilty Ezekiel
[49:24] 23 Perfection comes by by
[49:28] trials you don't even know you love me
[49:30] until I get on your
[49:32] nerve that's
[49:34] true it's the truth I mean you got you
[49:37] know how I'm going to know that if we
[49:38] don't you know we don't Fellowship you
[49:40] know it's those little things that you
[49:42] God put there so that you can come to
[49:45] understand that there's still something
[49:46] in US Satan can work with we got to get
[49:49] rid of all of
[49:51] that we really do we got to get rid of
[49:54] all of that that don't protect you
[49:57] the Holy Ghost is your
[49:59] protection it ain't what you do or how
[50:01] you it's the Holy Ghost brother said I
[50:03] sin all the time he said he said I'll
[50:05] never be perfect he said but I'm
[50:07] trusting in the perfect
[50:10] one he said what it is and that that's
[50:13] in in in rest uh I forgot I think that's
[50:15] uh the same one but he talks about he
[50:17] says listen in in in uh listen to the
[50:21] rest okay uh I'm getting mixed up in my
[50:23] message because I listen to several but
[50:26] he talks about it people he talks about
[50:28] it he said but when you make confess and
[50:32] make he said when you make a mistake and
[50:33] make it right he said that's what God
[50:35] looks
[50:39] at Ezekiel 23 and4 and we're going to
[50:42] close on this okay we're not going to be
[50:44] long tonight but my point is people
[50:47] what's going to happen this is your
[50:49] Jubilee 50 years this is

[51:11] bride has been born the the stars in the
[51:15] heavens declared us so it ain't that if
[51:19] we on Earth we are on earth amen the
[51:22] bride is

[51:43] his head I can't stand you I mean
[51:45] something on that effect and it must

[51:51] say that was the
[51:54] Christ that was the Christ in it
[51:58] Hallelujah having patience and
[52:00] longsuffering is not easy but it's it's
[52:02] ordained for us to do it Ezekiel 23 and4
[52:06] you love the Lord amen we all people
[52:09] there's it's so much growth it's so much
[52:12] listen that God you know why I'm I'm
[52:14] preaching like this because we don't
[52:16] understand how Satan works on me there
[52:18] times he said well they a you don't see
[52:20] no growth ain't nothing happen you
[52:21] wasting your time and I know better I
[52:24] know it's the devil because you know I
[52:26] just like the Lord say then you know if
[52:28] you can't see no growth you it's like
[52:30] looking at a tree like I said can you
[52:32] see a tree
[52:35] growing that's my answer to the
[52:38] devil you see because a tree grow right
[52:41] in your face and you don't see it
[52:44] amen right and you're growing you may
[52:47] not see it but you're growing oh it's
[52:50] true it's true it's true amen God in the
[52:53] inside is changing you little by little
[52:55] by little know he's changing
[53:00] me I've seen the difference I've Marvel
[53:03] at the
[53:05] difference cuz I know I couldn't do it I
[53:09] know I couldn't do it Ezekiel 23 and4
[53:12] you love the Lord
[53:17] amen I'm going read the first verse the
[53:19] word of the Lord came again unto me
[53:21] saying son a man there were two women
[53:24] the daughters of one mother and they
[53:26] committed whoredom in Egypt they
[53:29] committed whoredom in their youth they
[53:32] were their breast pressed and they were
[53:35] they bruised the teeths of their
[53:37] virginity and I know that sound rough
[53:40] and the names of them were aholah the
[53:42] Elder and holah her sister and they were
[53:44] mine and they were bear Sons and
[53:47] Daughters thus where their name Samaria
[53:49] is aola and Jerusalem
[53:52] aah and what it was amen these sisters
[53:56] it was the northern kingdom and the
[53:58] southern Kingdom of
[54:00] Israel and what they had done is what
[54:03] they what the what we've done I put it
[54:05] this way it's no
[54:07] difference I mean we might call
[54:09] ourselves Jerusalem but look what the
[54:11] Gentile church has done she's done the
[54:13] same thing Israel has and what happened
[54:16] was a whole uh uh Samaria amen what she
[54:20] did she uh uh uh uh basically went out
[54:23] of whing with all of the soldiers and
[54:25] everything else
[54:27] and then you know what what was so bad
[54:30] you think that Jerusalem would have been
[54:31] able to look at Samaria and say listen
[54:33] we're not going to do that but it
[54:35] represented Judah and she not only did
[54:37] that but she United with them she made
[54:38] an ally with them she became amen what
[54:41] you say the World Council of
[54:44] churches and she flirted and did all of
[54:47] these things and listen God judged
[54:50] them hello God judged them and my point
[54:55] is you and I can't flirt with the
[54:59] world not even flirt but say God ain't
[55:03] taking no
[55:04] flirters we can't flirt with the world
[55:09] now how many of us flirt at times oh so
[55:12] we need to God God to deliver us this is
[55:14] our year Jubilee take away the flirting
[55:17] of spirit
[55:22] Lord they were really harshly judged why
[55:25] because God God is a jealous
[55:28] God he'll never have a god before him I
[55:32] don't care what it is God will not have
[55:36] another God before him and whether you
[55:38] out there committing some H horrible sin
[55:42] or not it doesn't matter because
[55:44] idolatry can come in a small package
[55:50] amen huh Rachel HD her daddy's idols
[55:58] huh where in a
[56:01] place you see what I'm saying and it's
[56:03] show by the grace of God that it is so
[56:05] easy to even idolize yourself he said I
[56:09] don't do that yes we do when God command
[56:12] us and car ask us to do things and we
[56:16] don't feel like it then you become your
[56:20] God because you have your will have
[56:23] superseded the will of God you yourself
[56:26] have become the idol oh come on somebody
[56:30] it's true
[56:32] anyhow and what is it now you and I got
[56:35] something to fight we've got to fight
[56:38] what we call the message
[56:42] spirit that old lukewarm and didn't that
[56:45] that brother brought it he brought it
[56:47] lukewarmness is not in a good place to
[56:49] be you and a being lukewarm you put God
[56:52] in a place where he gets sick and want
[56:54] to throw you up
[56:57] spew you
[56:58] out right he said I would you be cold
[57:01] cold ain't a good place
[57:03] either cuz if you cold you going to miss
[57:05] the
[57:06] Rapture amen you might not be spew out
[57:09] but listen if you cold you going to miss
[57:12] the Rapture but the good thing about
[57:14] cold at least you know you're not hot
[57:16] amen that's true you know your situation
[57:19] you know where you're stand but when
[57:21] you're hot come on somebody and you and
[57:24] I must become Z is for God you can't do
[57:28] it without the Holy
[57:30] Ghost not the full kind of zous uh that
[57:33] God
[57:36] wants am I making
[57:38] sense this is our time you say well
[57:42] brother books I I want Deliverance
[57:45] really do we really want Deliverance do
[57:47] we really want God to help us well let
[57:49] me tell you something brother B said if
[57:51] you don't get desperate it'll pass right
[57:53] through you and you won't know it
[57:55] something God is
[57:57] sending he said well brother I don't
[57:58] know how to get desperate you know how
[58:00] to pray amen we know how to
[58:04] pray and prayer is Lord make if you want
[58:07] God you want to be
[58:09] desperate Lord Make Me desperate you
[58:11] better know what you're
[58:13] praying but if that's the only way you
[58:15] can get desperate pray it because
[58:17] desperation is the only thing that's
[58:19] going to get us out of here am I making
[58:22] sense now my point is this amen when we
[58:25] see how God comes along and he tears up
[58:29] Israel he judges them and Titus and you
[58:32] know all of these things that we see
[58:34] happened to Jerusalem was only because
[58:36] of their re their rebellion and their
[58:39] rejection of the prophets and the
[58:41] prophets and the prophets the word was
[58:44] constantly coming to her warning her and
[58:46] warning her like here and they
[58:49] constantly rejected they constantly
[58:50] didn't take the prophet
[58:52] seriously and so when judgment came it
[58:55] shouldn't have taken them by surprise
[58:57] cuz the prophet said the Judgment was
[59:05] coming am I making
[59:07] sense see I I I just oh I could tell you
[59:10] like this and I I I know I'm not
[59:12] speaking only for
[59:14] myself I can't stand
[59:17] lukewarmness I can't stand it when I
[59:19] can't even be free in my own assembly
[59:22] because I feel the the downpour Lord
[59:27] am I I'm the one one about I know I'm
[59:29] not you feel that downpour when you
[59:31] trying to go up but you feel a downpour
[59:34] because everybody's not everybody's not
[59:36] on one Accord we're not we're not
[59:38] pulling for the for God with the same uh
[59:46] intensity but God is real and he's
[59:49] serious and we and you and I must
[59:52] understand the only way we're going to
[59:54] get we've got a turn we got to get
[59:57] before God in our own little closets
[59:59] wherever you pray and you better say God
[1:00:02] help me return I don't want to be sealed
[1:00:05] in my ear I don't want to con and it's
[1:00:08] true I mean you know you it's everywhere
[1:00:10] you go you preach a message I remember
[1:00:13] years ago when the Holy Ghost was really
[1:00:14] moving you preach a message you didn't
[1:00:16] have to worry about coming people coming
[1:00:17] to the altar praying wherever they be it
[1:00:20] happened now you can preach a a
[1:00:23] convicted message a a a uh the hell and
[1:00:27] brimstone and people don't move they
[1:00:30] don't something's
[1:00:33] wrong you know why because people have
[1:00:36] gotten so laxy Daisy they really are
[1:00:39] comfortable they have become
[1:00:41] lukewarm even in this
[1:00:45] assembly this is time to take our
[1:00:48] inheritance I believe
[1:00:50] that listen what he said did you notice
[1:00:53] have you read he says if a man bought
[1:00:56] property inside of a wall City then he
[1:00:58] had one year to redeem that back if he
[1:01:00] sold it and if he did not redeem that
[1:01:03] back that property if it was inside of a
[1:01:05] wall had to stay in there it could not
[1:01:08] go free in the Jubilee it was bound to
[1:01:11] stay there they were over the over the
[1:01:13] wall they never heard the Jubilee the
[1:01:15] trumpet sounding they sounded a trumpet
[1:01:17] and could not go free and I'm afraid
[1:01:20] that one of the the things that we have
[1:01:22] had in the beginning how that old time
[1:01:24] of preachers against organized in
[1:01:26] ourselves together we turned around and
[1:01:28] done the very thing back that our
[1:01:31] fathers fought so hard to come out of
[1:01:34] it's true people can't even get in the
[1:01:36] spirit without people feeling
[1:01:41] uncomfortable and we've got to change
[1:01:44] and the only way that that can change is
[1:01:46] that God come down and changes but you
[1:01:48] got to have a willing heart all of
[1:01:51] us all of us amen and the wall I'm
[1:01:56] afraid that too many of us today too
[1:01:58] many of our Pentecostal people have got
[1:02:00] walled into some denomination some
[1:02:03] organization somewhere and we'll never
[1:02:05] hear the sound of the Jubilee and never
[1:02:06] come again uh back to the inheritance
[1:02:09] now he talk about organization but what
[1:02:11] about our habits that got us walled
[1:02:15] in that we can't even hear the gospel
[1:02:17] enough to repeat repent rather you know
[1:02:20] instead we we get an attitude or
[1:02:22] something ain't nobody picking God
[1:02:24] trying to save us amen
[1:02:26] God trying to save us but if you harden
[1:02:30] your heart to it it it would do us no
[1:02:32] good it does the preacher no good if you
[1:02:34] don't have ears to
[1:02:35] hear that that that's what's coming
[1:02:38] forth is not the man brother Brooks but
[1:02:40] uh the the spirit of God anointing him
[1:02:43] to say what he needs to
[1:02:45] say he said look what he said instead of
[1:02:48] having Fellowship one with another is
[1:02:50] divided us and separated us in several
[1:02:53] different organizations of people and in
[1:02:55] doing so it has broke out up broke up
[1:02:58] our inheritance so maybe we're not
[1:03:00] divided in the organization but we're
[1:03:02] divided among
[1:03:03] ourselves into
[1:03:08] groups
[1:03:10] huh hello somebody if we ever get walled
[1:03:13] into a place where we can't accept the
[1:03:15] word and the Holy Spirit and have to
[1:03:17] take Creeds and so forth to a church
[1:03:19] instead of the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:21] the Jubilee will never mean nothing to
[1:03:23] that person
[1:03:26] H and he said that's how it is in the
[1:03:27] organization he said they've been bored
[1:03:29] in their ear my mama was a Baptist my
[1:03:31] daddy was a Baptist he said what it is
[1:03:34] he said that he said that that uh that
[1:03:37] uh uh that that slave mentality
[1:03:40] continues from generation to
[1:03:45] generation you love the
[1:03:51] Lord you said well why you preaching so
[1:03:53] hard because it shook me
[1:03:56] I realize that we you know sometime we
[1:03:58] procrastinate us we we say we're not but
[1:04:00] we are we're not desperate enough you
[1:04:03] know we we let me put it this way I'm
[1:04:06] talking about myself now because I
[1:04:09] realize that there's more God that that
[1:04:12] that that we need there's got to be a
[1:04:14] greater
[1:04:15] refilling than what we're
[1:04:19] getting we have a good prayer
[1:04:22] life we need more until our Our Lives
[1:04:26] can be identical to
[1:04:30] this y'all hear what I'm saying why
[1:04:32] because even the prophet of God said
[1:04:34] we'll be so much like him we'll pull him
[1:04:35] from heaven now I don't know about you
[1:04:37] but I'm not there yet and all I know is
[1:04:41] he said that's what gets us prayer sweat
[1:04:46] tears promise you got a promise you need
[1:04:49] to cry sweat and whatever more until you
[1:04:53] get it amen you don't have to say amen I
[1:04:57] say Amen because I know who's talking
[1:04:59] and let me say it like this people of
[1:05:01] God it doesn't
[1:05:03] matter what we say in our
[1:05:07] mouths if it's not
[1:05:11] there continue confessing it but you
[1:05:14] don't stop confessing it
[1:05:18] ever y'all hear what I'm saying because
[1:05:21] the Pama worm comes along listen it's
[1:05:23] true I don't even know we I know we have
[1:05:26] testimonies but how often do we get them
[1:05:29] up
[1:05:32] here written out something God got to be
[1:05:36] doing
[1:05:39] something and we fail to see that this
[1:05:42] is the operation of the church it
[1:05:43] edifies because somebody may need that
[1:05:46] now I'm going on the road now because I
[1:05:49] want you to understand it is later than
[1:05:52] what you and I think
[1:05:57] and the Perfection that God wants to see
[1:05:59] in us maybe y'all can see it but I'm not
[1:06:02] seeing it not what I
[1:06:05] see not with my
[1:06:09] eyes and I know the husband must first
[1:06:12] first be partaker of the food that's
[1:06:15] okay but I won't stay where I'm at I can
[1:06:19] promise you
[1:06:20] that because I know I'm not a
[1:06:22] servant I'm a son
[1:06:26] and I've got an
[1:06:30] inheritance if you don't see I'mma tell
[1:06:32] you
[1:06:34] something I don't who was I talking to
[1:06:36] I'm going to close
[1:06:38] now y'all think church service is
[1:06:43] long well in hell you don't get out of
[1:06:50] service y'all hear what I'm saying in
[1:06:52] hell you don't there is no time
[1:06:57] clock you can't get
[1:07:02] impatient it would do no good
[1:07:05] anyhow y'all hear what I'm saying and we
[1:07:07] look at church time or or this time and
[1:07:11] we think it's a lot of it's not a lot of
[1:07:13] time that early church how can we
[1:07:15] compare to them Paul preached all
[1:07:19] night how can we compare how can we
[1:07:22] compare TOA Street people oh that
[1:07:26] Pentecost they had more than what
[1:07:27] message people got we might have a word
[1:07:31] you don't have to say amen I know it's
[1:07:32] true it's evident brother B say compare
[1:07:35] yourself to what they had and see
[1:07:37] whether this church measure up to
[1:07:43] it tell me anybody here can say you can
[1:07:45] measure yourself up to that and stand
[1:07:48] with those
[1:07:49] people who cared nothing about prayer
[1:07:52] and how long they were there didn't care
[1:07:54] about
[1:07:58] position didn't care about what they was
[1:08:00] going to wear came to church with
[1:08:03] whatever they had whether they were
[1:08:05] hungry it didn't make no
[1:08:08] difference brother B was just saying on
[1:08:11] that tape how one sister lost her baby
[1:08:13] and didn't have enough money to even put
[1:08:14] it in a coffin so the brothers cut up
[1:08:16] some wood and built a coffin and to bury
[1:08:19] the baby you think that turned her
[1:08:21] against God
[1:08:27] and we supposed to be
[1:08:29] greater a double portion y'all got it
[1:08:32] who got it you got that double
[1:08:35] portion come on I mean manifest I'm I
[1:08:38] ain't talking about on the way we know
[1:08:40] it's on the way I'm talking about do
[1:08:42] y'all know what I'm trying to say people
[1:08:44] that's our
[1:08:45] inheritance not tomorrow today
[1:08:49] am I know I I sound like I'm fussing I
[1:08:52] don't mean to sound that way I'm serious
[1:08:55] though in everything I'm saying because
[1:08:58] I feel really inspired by God to say it
[1:09:01] now you can believe it's God and you
[1:09:02] don't have to but my point is you will
[1:09:05] be judged by what's being
[1:09:09] said and God got us here because there
[1:09:12] is this time now I I tell you what if
[1:09:16] time is the way it really is and God
[1:09:19] counts
[1:09:21] generations and here in this magazine
[1:09:24] that I didn't bring it talks about
[1:09:26] here's
[1:09:27] a a president that is a modern president
[1:09:32] bringing in all of these modern things
[1:09:34] and brought in the area of
[1:09:37] Leo he was the inspiration him and his
[1:09:40] wife brother say she cut her hair and
[1:09:42] all the women in America fashioned
[1:09:44] herself like and she was of the Catholic
[1:09:47] Church come on somebody now we have seen
[1:09:50] what they've done in 50 years that means
[1:09:52] it's harvest
[1:09:55] it's
[1:09:56] harvest we are now at a harvest so if we
[1:09:59] are at a harvest there are Reapers
[1:10:04] somewhere and there's a period like
[1:10:07] brother R said just like God Amen marked
[1:10:11] Israel and says
[1:10:12] listen hold it up the 11th hour I'm done
[1:10:16] almost and the 11th Hour has been long
[1:10:19] time
[1:10:20] ago God stopped the Four Winds but he
[1:10:23] get you know down in Revelation those
[1:10:24] Four Winds winds were let loose
[1:10:27] there but hold it up till I seal I'm
[1:10:31] talking about the
[1:10:32] servants and that was Israel the 144,000
[1:10:36] hadn't been sealed
[1:10:39] yet but it was stop for them God slips
[1:10:43] in a bride
[1:10:44] age that's you and I and what are we
[1:10:47] doing with our time
[1:10:59] looks all of
[1:11:02] us need
[1:11:09] more and all of
[1:11:12] us because I'm going tell you
[1:11:14] something I want to have that Atmos
[1:11:17] steere no matter where I
[1:11:19] go I've experienced it every now and
[1:11:22] then sometime things happen with bump
[1:11:25] bumps up into that love
[1:11:28] atmosphere but that's not supposed to be
[1:11:30] every every other
[1:11:32] time it's supposed to be the same kind
[1:11:35] of atmosphere that William Brandon
[1:11:37] brought in the room when he was coming
[1:11:38] in it wasn't some time it was all the
[1:11:42] time he kept himself behind the
[1:11:47] veil and I believe with all my heart
[1:11:49] that's what the bride is supposed to be
[1:11:52] there was where she
[1:11:54] budded behind the ve that's where her it
[1:11:58] wasn't in and out in and out it was de
[1:12:01] and that's where the fruit was made
[1:12:03] manifest right and brother brandham said
[1:12:05] it like this and then Clos
[1:12:07] it and no matter what we
[1:12:10] say I say it like this he said God even
[1:12:14] though Abraham had been chosen and
[1:12:16] elected of God God could not fully bless
[1:12:20] Abraham until he had separated himself
[1:12:24] from l
[1:12:28] and I'm going tell you
[1:12:30] something until we fully separate
[1:12:32] ourselves from
[1:12:35] lot God can't fully bless
[1:12:39] us and lot
[1:12:43] represents
[1:12:45] lukewarmness
[1:12:48] worldliness pitching our tent towards
[1:12:52] Sodom those kind of things that God is
[1:12:55] trying to get us to
[1:12:57] see now we may
[1:13:14] stand you know I watch things and I'm
[1:13:17] sure God does
[1:13:21] too positive things have always received
[1:13:24] an amen
[1:13:27] negative
[1:13:28] things we hardly ever say Amen when we
[1:13:31] know it's
[1:13:36] true and if the amen is in you whether
[1:13:40] it be positive or negative it's going to
[1:13:42] amen his
[1:13:45] word and it's amazing how when it's
[1:13:48] positive is God when it's negative is
[1:13:52] that God of brother Brooks
[1:13:57] surely God won't be telling us these
[1:14:01] things perhaps that's the way Israel
[1:14:03] thought
[1:14:08] too he wouldn't be talking like this
[1:14:11] perhaps that's the way Israel thought
[1:14:16] too and their thoughts were heard in
[1:14:21] heaven and God judges every one of our
[1:14:24] thoughts
[1:14:26] whether you receive him or reject
[1:14:31] him if I spoke the untruth tonight then
[1:14:34] I'm a liar and God will deal with
[1:14:37] me but if I spoke the truth and you
[1:14:40] don't receive it then God will judge
[1:14:43] you because that don't make no
[1:14:45] difference what we think we are God is
[1:14:47] the spokesman he knows the depths of our
[1:14:51] hearts he knows what's in there
[1:15:04] let us
[1:15:06] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[1:15:10] you and we thank you for your grace and

[1:18:51] Seal's book he said as long as you got
[1:18:53] this even when the man is perfect you
[1:18:56] capable of making
[1:18:59] mistakes that's what I'm speaking of not
[1:19:02] the outer shell the inner shell grows up
[1:19:05] into a perfect statue of Christ the
[1:19:08] outer shell is your
