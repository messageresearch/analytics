[59:20] Let's uh open our Bibles in the The Book
[59:24] of Genesis want to
[59:28] chapter
[59:30] 28 we read the verse
[59:34] 15 then after that we go to the book of
[59:39] Isaiah Genesis
[59:43] 28:15 the Bible says and behold I am
[59:47] with thee and I will keep thee in all
[59:49] places where thou goest and will bring
[59:52] thee again into this land for I will not
[59:56] leave thee until I have done that which
[59:59] I have spoken to thee
[1:00:11] of so in other words uh uh that in the
[1:00:14] middle of this
[1:00:16] verse you know we can say that the Lord
[1:00:18] says that he will not rest until he has
[1:00:22] done that which he has spoken
[1:00:28] amen it's a great promise that we
[1:00:30] have that we can lean on let's go to
[1:00:34] Isaiah chapter
[1:00:36] 49 we'll read the verse 13 to verse uh
[1:00:46] 18 Isaiah 49
[1:00:49] verse 13 to 18
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:59] the Bible says Sing oh heavens and be
[1:01:03] joyful o Earth and Break Forth into
[1:01:06] singing oh Mountains for the Lord has
[1:01:09] comforted his people and he will have
[1:01:12] mercy upon his
[1:01:22] afflicted but Zion said the Lord has
[1:01:25] forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten
[1:01:32] me this is my favorite part of the verse
[1:01:35] of the
[1:01:37] chapter the Bible says can a woman this
[1:01:39] is now the Lord talking it says can a
[1:01:43] woman forget a sucking child that she
[1:01:46] should not have compassion on the son of
[1:01:49] her womb yeah they may forget yet will I
[1:01:54] not forget the amen
[1:02:03] verse 16 says behold I have gra I have
[1:02:07] Graven thee upon the palms of my hands
[1:02:10] th walls are continually before
[1:02:17] me thy children shall make haste th
[1:02:21] destroyers and th and and they that made
[1:02:25] the waste shall go forth of
[1:02:33] thee lift up thine eyes round about and
[1:02:37] behold all this gather themselves
[1:02:40] together and come to thee as I leave
[1:02:43] sayth the Lord thou shallal surely close
[1:02:46] thee with them with them all as with an
[1:02:49] ornament and bind them on thee as a
[1:02:53] bride death is you
[1:03:07] in other words like in in our Christian
[1:03:09] Life as we
[1:03:11] leave you know God didn't promise us
[1:03:14] only the a bed of
[1:03:18] EAS you know it's it's like Peter who
[1:03:21] asked Jesus he said Lord we have
[1:03:23] forsaken our life we have left our
[1:03:25] husband and our
[1:03:30] wife what are you going to give us the
[1:03:33] Lord said that I will give you a hund
[1:03:36] fold of
[1:03:38] everything but on top of that I will
[1:03:40] also give you
[1:03:43] tribulation they are very
[1:03:46] important amen uh we may be
[1:03:49] seated uh this morning uh I do have a
[1:03:52] message that uh I would try by the grace
[1:03:55] of God to bring to
[1:03:58] you that I entitled he will not rest
[1:04:01] until he's done the full proc of
[1:04:11] redemption we started with the subject
[1:04:13] of redemption last time that we
[1:04:18] preached that the Redemption by Blood
[1:04:21] and by
[1:04:23] power so last time we show how you know
[1:04:26] Redemption had to has has to
[1:04:30] be you know we focus more on the
[1:04:34] lamb you know uh to explain how Jesus
[1:04:37] was the Lamb of
[1:04:41] God but this morning we will go uh a
[1:04:45] little bit
[1:04:47] deeper you know try to show trying to
[1:04:50] show that all the work that started in
[1:04:54] the Garden of Eden
[1:04:57] was not complete until Jesus Christ died
[1:05:00] on the
[1:05:02] cross and this message this morning is
[1:05:04] for you if you believe this quote that
[1:05:06] I'm about to
[1:05:09] read the prophet says in the message
[1:05:12] possessing the Gate of the enemy after
[1:05:18] trial paragraph
[1:05:21] 77 and
[1:05:23] remember if you never was in God's
[1:05:27] thoughts you'll never be with
[1:05:30] God how many knows that he was a
[1:05:35] redeemer well then anything redeemed has
[1:05:39] to come back where has to come back to
[1:05:42] where he fell
[1:05:49] from so if he come if he come to redeem
[1:05:54] us how could could
[1:05:56] we was one time didn't have to be
[1:06:03] redeemed and we were all born in
[1:06:07] sin shaped in
[1:06:09] iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:06:14] lies it shows that the real Christian is
[1:06:17] an attribute of God's
[1:06:22] thinking before there was a world
[1:06:26] or a star or
[1:06:28] air or anything
[1:06:31] else the prophet say it's
[1:06:34] Eternal and he come to redeem us
[1:06:37] back it's God's
[1:06:40] thought spoken to a world a
[1:06:43] word made
[1:06:46] manifest brought back to his
[1:06:49] thought so the prophet said that Jesus
[1:06:51] or God is coming to redeem us before
[1:06:54] even the was a
[1:06:58] star in that position that you belong
[1:07:01] that you first
[1:07:03] had and the word redeem if we go in the
[1:07:09] Greek the the the meaning of the the
[1:07:11] word redeem or to
[1:07:15] redeem uh it's in the Greek I think it's
[1:07:18] um EXA something like that I know the
[1:07:23] pronunciation it's spelled e x a g o r a
[1:07:29] z o x r g o r r z o but it says that
[1:07:34] it's buying a slave from from the
[1:07:39] market and when we go back to the
[1:07:41] history we go back to that time where we
[1:07:44] had
[1:07:47] slaves we see that if a man did
[1:07:49] something wrong to his
[1:07:52] master his master will punish him or
[1:07:55] will put him into
[1:07:58] death or the master will have to sell
[1:08:03] him or otherwise that person will be
[1:08:08] killed you know that that that makes us
[1:08:10] think about you know about
[1:08:12] us you know as Jesus as the Bible says
[1:08:15] that the the you know every every soul
[1:08:18] that sin shall
[1:08:22] die meaning that if you did something
[1:08:25] wrong or you SE the sentence is is a
[1:08:27] death
[1:08:30] sentence and G and God made it that
[1:08:34] way so that nobody else can redeem us
[1:08:37] but
[1:08:39] him you know Jesus oh God gave us that
[1:08:42] sentence of
[1:08:44] death so that nobody else will be able
[1:08:47] to buy someone from his death sentence
[1:08:56] and and and and and and then at that
[1:08:58] time so if a man is bought from you know
[1:09:01] from
[1:09:03] saly he couldn't go back to the he
[1:09:06] couldn't go back to the market again
[1:09:09] anymore because it was
[1:09:11] sealed and that's the same thing with us
[1:09:14] Christian once being
[1:09:17] redeemed once being redeemed you can
[1:09:19] never go back to the
[1:09:23] devil or that sentence will have no
[1:09:26] Authority on
[1:09:27] you you are
[1:09:30] seal and the prophet says Satan
[1:09:33] was well Satan will be taken from the
[1:09:37] earth just exactly like Satan was taken
[1:09:40] from
[1:09:42] you Satan cannot bother or he can tempt
[1:09:49] us but he cannot get a born again
[1:09:53] Christian
[1:09:57] for God from the foundation of the
[1:10:00] world for
[1:10:02] him and sent Jesus to redeem
[1:10:07] him and the blood speaks for
[1:10:10] him how can he seen when he can't be
[1:10:17] seen you know how can the person who has
[1:10:20] been
[1:10:21] redeemed can sin when that sin cannot be
[1:10:25] is seen by
[1:10:28] God you know he don't the only thing he
[1:10:31] hears is your
[1:10:33] voice he sees your
[1:10:37] representation that is
[1:10:38] true but the thing is that we have
[1:10:43] people who have been in sin for so
[1:10:46] long they being forgiven by
[1:10:50] God you know they think like they're
[1:10:52] still they're still you know that seems
[1:10:55] see is is still on
[1:10:58] them you know it's like the the the
[1:11:00] story that the prophet G gave one
[1:11:03] time it says that there were there was a
[1:11:08] cber a
[1:11:10] bird who was tied by by by his
[1:11:14] master so he was in that position for so
[1:11:17] long for many days for many
[1:11:20] months you know he tried to flee but
[1:11:23] that couldn't work
[1:11:26] you know he tried to free himself but he
[1:11:28] felt like that couldn't work you know it
[1:11:30] was
[1:11:33] still but one day someone a kind man
[1:11:36] passed
[1:11:38] by you know he freed that bird from that
[1:11:43] prison but that bird couldn't
[1:11:47] fly because even though the bird was
[1:11:51] free you know he still had in his
[1:11:54] thought he still had in his mind that he
[1:11:56] was still TI he was still in
[1:12:00] prison and that is the condition of of
[1:12:03] many Christians this
[1:12:05] morning you know though forgiven by
[1:12:09] Christ you know though Jesus went on
[1:12:11] Calvary and he died for
[1:12:13] us you know we still have that thought
[1:12:16] in us we still our mind is still in
[1:12:21] prison you know our mind is still
[1:12:23] because the devil why the devil
[1:12:25] does is that he will make you do
[1:12:28] something he will make you
[1:12:31] sin then he will come now fighing
[1:12:34] you you know to make you remind you know
[1:12:37] he will start reminding you of the other
[1:12:39] thing that you
[1:12:40] did you know it will make you think that
[1:12:43] what you did is Unforgiven you can't be
[1:12:48] forgiven you know he will make you think
[1:12:50] as if what you did is a death sentence
[1:12:56] but somehow it's
[1:12:58] true you know that sin will be a death
[1:13:02] sentence if you don't confess it you
[1:13:06] know that sin will be a death
[1:13:09] sentence or that sin will not be
[1:13:13] forgiven you know if you don't confess
[1:13:15] it if you don't go to
[1:13:17] Calvary you know that sin will still be
[1:13:20] in
[1:13:21] you when God will look at you God will
[1:13:23] be able to see that sin
[1:13:27] if it's not
[1:13:28] forgiven but once that sin has been
[1:13:32] confessed you know once you come to
[1:13:34] Calvary and then you tell God everything
[1:13:36] about the
[1:13:39] sin and that sin has been
[1:13:42] forgiven that sin is
[1:13:45] lost you know that sin is gone forever
[1:13:49] you know that sin cannot be found in
[1:13:51] God's
[1:13:52] book you know but though the devil can
[1:13:55] come to you you know it's like brother
[1:13:57] Brooks when he preached uh the uh I
[1:13:59] think uh before before he gone before he
[1:14:02] gone when he preached last
[1:14:04] time he said that somebody asked the
[1:14:07] prophet he said that brother Bram when
[1:14:11] does God forgive our
[1:14:14] sin you know if the prophet says that
[1:14:17] God forgives
[1:14:18] you the very same
[1:14:22] moment that you confess your sin
[1:14:25] so there is no
[1:14:27] delay there is no no God will forgive me
[1:14:30] after two
[1:14:31] days or I have to let this gun you know
[1:14:34] I have to wait a little bit and then God
[1:14:36] will
[1:14:38] forgive no it says that the very same
[1:14:41] second you know just when you done
[1:14:46] confessing you know your sin has been
[1:14:48] forgiven you if we can go a little bit
[1:14:51] farther just the very same the very same
[1:14:55] time that you try to open your
[1:14:58] mouth because God answer us even the
[1:15:01] thing that we don't say even the thing
[1:15:02] we we just
[1:15:06] think you know that just the very same
[1:15:09] moment that you open your
[1:15:11] mouth God sees the intention that you
[1:15:15] have it will show up it will
[1:15:18] come ready to you know he'll be waiting
[1:15:20] for you to to get done confess
[1:15:25] and when you done confessing your
[1:15:27] sin you know he will forgive you you
[1:15:31] know Jesus comes to redeem
[1:15:33] you because you were saved before the
[1:15:36] beginning of the
[1:15:38] world you know as we read you know you
[1:15:41] were in God's
[1:15:43] thought you know before the before he
[1:15:46] even created the
[1:15:47] world you know you had a certain
[1:15:51] position you know before even a star was
[1:15:54] created
[1:15:56] you know God saw you in a certain
[1:15:59] position but when Adam and Eve when they
[1:16:03] sin the human race lost their
[1:16:08] position you know the human race you
[1:16:10] know lost the position that God saw go
[1:16:13] that God for you know that you had in
[1:16:18] God though from that time now from that
[1:16:22] time you know from that time when the SC
[1:16:26] the work of
[1:16:28] redemption was now in progress God God
[1:16:31] was working the work of
[1:16:37] redemption we see that he came in the
[1:16:40] garden you know looking for Adam and Eve
[1:16:44] you know that's something great with God
[1:16:46] you know Adam and Eve
[1:16:48] seen and they hid them themselves from
[1:16:52] God in other words you know the word say
[1:16:55] God we don't want you
[1:16:57] anymore but as the Bible says that God
[1:17:00] so loved the
[1:17:02] world God came
[1:17:04] down looking for Adam and
[1:17:08] Eve looking for the people who
[1:17:12] seen even though they didn't want to see
[1:17:15] God even though they were running away
[1:17:18] from
[1:17:19] God but God couldn't
[1:17:22] rest until Adam and Eve was redem
[1:17:27] that's the same thing with that the same
[1:17:28] thing this morning you know you seen you
[1:17:32] did something wrong and and you feel
[1:17:34] yourself you know guilty about the thing
[1:17:36] that you
[1:17:37] did and and you running away from
[1:17:41] God the prophet says that a man a sinner
[1:17:45] you know a sinner always run runs away
[1:17:47] from
[1:17:49] God you know that's that's his nature is
[1:17:52] to run away from God but you know but we
[1:17:55] have a God who love us so
[1:17:58] much that even though we try to run
[1:18:01] away you know he will come you know he
[1:18:05] will make his way
[1:18:07] through he will come until it reaches
[1:18:10] you you know that's why that's why the
[1:18:12] message this morning is that God will
[1:18:15] not
[1:18:16] rest until until you are at his
[1:18:20] side you know God will not rest until
[1:18:23] you are saved
[1:18:25] so he will try to do everything that he
[1:18:28] can you know he will try to talk to you
[1:18:31] he will speak to your heart you know he
[1:18:34] will send people telling you you know
[1:18:36] you will see
[1:18:37] dreams you might see Visions you know he
[1:18:41] will do
[1:18:42] everything to get you back to him to get
[1:18:46] you where where he saw
[1:18:49] you to get you where where you
[1:18:52] belong you know it's like the go son
[1:18:56] you know when he left his parents'
[1:18:59] house that was his own
[1:19:01] decision you know he took his money and
[1:19:03] then he's
[1:19:04] gone but though he was gone you know God
[1:19:09] was still working with his
[1:19:12] heart you know it was an experience that
[1:19:14] he was supposed to
[1:19:18] have to show him the grace that he had
[1:19:21] when he was in his father's
[1:19:23] house you know sometimes we go as
[1:19:27] straight you know just God just want to
[1:19:29] show how God just want to show
[1:19:34] us the grace that we have in
[1:19:37] him you know sometimes when we
[1:19:40] sin sometimes when we fall
[1:19:43] short you know it's just God trying to
[1:19:46] tell
[1:19:47] us you know his love for
[1:19:50] us you know how can you see the love of
[1:19:53] God
[1:19:55] if you never
[1:19:56] seen you know how can you receive the
[1:19:58] blood of Christ if you never
[1:20:02] seen how can Calvary have have a meaning
[1:20:05] for you if you never
[1:20:09] SE because God didn't die for holy
[1:20:14] people God didn't die for people God
[1:20:17] didn't die for people with no
[1:20:21] sin but God died for the people
[1:20:25] who sin you know God died for the
[1:20:30] people who had a death
[1:20:32] sentence you know espe especially us
[1:20:36] Gentiles you know if we go back to the
[1:20:38] Old
[1:20:39] Testament we were not even allowed to go
[1:20:42] into the
[1:20:45] temple you know we couldn't get into the
[1:20:50] temple but God saw
[1:20:52] us and he had mercy on on
[1:20:56] us you know he died for us he redeemed
[1:21:00] us and not only that he called us his
[1:21:04] bride and then we are the king and
[1:21:07] priest of
[1:21:09] God King and priest is the two highest
[1:21:12] you know position that you can
[1:21:16] have but the sad thing is
[1:21:18] that we forget who we
[1:21:21] are you know we forget Who We Are
[1:21:25] and if you forget if you don't know who
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:28] are you will never have a power you will
[1:21:31] never have the
[1:21:33] authority you know listen because if we
[1:21:36] take an example of the policeman
[1:21:40] or the cop doesn't have the power to
[1:21:43] stop a
[1:21:45] car you imagine a car driving 100 miles
[1:21:50] per hour
[1:21:54] a
[1:21:55] cop you know sometime you know skinny as
[1:21:58] I
[1:22:00] am you know standing there and then you
[1:22:02] know you think that that cup will have
[1:22:04] the power to stop that
[1:22:10] car if the cop only goes by his
[1:22:15] power he will never stop the
[1:22:18] car but the cop needs to know who he
[1:22:23] is and use his
[1:22:26] authority to stop that
[1:22:28] car and that's why the prophet said that
[1:22:32] us as as
[1:22:34] Christian we don't need
[1:22:36] power it says because Jesus fought Jesus
[1:22:40] fought and he won all our
[1:22:44] battles we don't need to fight
[1:22:47] anymore that's why we don't need the
[1:22:50] power but we just need the authority
[1:22:54] the devil has been won
[1:22:57] already you know but we just need the
[1:23:01] authority to remind him of who we are to
[1:23:06] remind him of the work that was done in
[1:23:09] Calvary to remind him or to
[1:23:14] claim the victory that God gave
[1:23:17] us you know do you see that the perfect
[1:23:20] lamb had to
[1:23:22] die so that we dis Ed
[1:23:25] sinner we may find
[1:23:28] life you know because the perfect lamb
[1:23:31] the law required a perfect lamb a lamb
[1:23:34] with no
[1:23:38] blemish so that us this figured
[1:23:42] sinner you know who was condemned to
[1:23:45] die you know we might find
[1:23:49] life amen the prophet
[1:23:52] says um I said
[1:23:54] uh he went into the belly of of a whale
[1:23:58] for a
[1:24:02] man he went down in a fiery furnace to
[1:24:05] get some of his children
[1:24:10] out and then he will come down into this
[1:24:16] gallery or in other words he will come
[1:24:18] down into this
[1:24:21] church you know there the officer
[1:24:25] unbuckling his
[1:24:27] gun and laying it on the
[1:24:31] floor and putting his arms around me
[1:24:34] like
[1:24:37] that and God
[1:24:40] miraculously come down so here the
[1:24:43] prophet if we go back um in this
[1:24:47] message the prophet is talking about the
[1:24:52] uh about the general I forgot his
[1:24:56] name who was a judge he was also a
[1:24:59] soldier but he was a
[1:25:02] judge you know when they went down into
[1:25:05] I think a basement where in the G in the
[1:25:08] G Gallery of
[1:25:12] Guns you know that Brother start to talk
[1:25:14] with the prophet was speaking with the
[1:25:18] prophet he said brother brandham do you
[1:25:20] know
[1:25:21] what I grew up in the church
[1:25:25] it says that my my my parents you know
[1:25:27] brought show me the church you know
[1:25:30] since I was
[1:25:34] born it says that I never missed a
[1:25:37] service you know I always was there on
[1:25:40] time you know I was singing at church
[1:25:44] you know I still play the the instrument
[1:25:46] of
[1:25:46] church you know I have this postor
[1:25:50] church but they said brother brandham to
[1:25:52] be honest with you
[1:25:55] even though I go to
[1:25:58] church I still feel that there there's
[1:26:00] something empty inside of
[1:26:03] me you know I don't know God as I as I
[1:26:06] am supposed
[1:26:09] to then he asked the prophet he says
[1:26:11] that can God save
[1:26:13] me you know that's why the prophet was
[1:26:16] saying you know his answer the prophet
[1:26:18] answered
[1:26:20] was you know God can do whatever he
[1:26:23] whatever it takes to save
[1:26:26] you you know God went down in the belly
[1:26:29] of the well to say to be with
[1:26:33] Jonas you know God went down to the
[1:26:36] Lions you know to the Lions to save to
[1:26:38] save uh
[1:26:42] Daniel you know God went down to the to
[1:26:45] the fiery furnace to save the three
[1:26:47] Hebrews
[1:26:49] children and God will come down in this
[1:26:53] place
[1:26:55] to save you you know it only takes one
[1:27:01] thing it's Faith you know if you believe
[1:27:04] in God you know God will come down to
[1:27:08] take to save
[1:27:09] you you know when we think about the the
[1:27:14] Redemption you know we think about
[1:27:17] Redemption we see that uh uh uh when
[1:27:20] when God tell Moses you know to take the
[1:27:23] children of is is out of out of
[1:27:29] Egypt and and and Moses when we know
[1:27:32] that when they went when they came to
[1:27:34] the
[1:27:36] desert they spent 40 years in the
[1:27:40] desert you know sometimes Moses you know
[1:27:42] was probably wondering or you know this
[1:27:45] is me saying you know some some of them
[1:27:47] people was wondering why do we have to
[1:27:50] spend 40 years here
[1:27:57] because if we go by the map there were
[1:27:58] there was a shorter way where they could
[1:28:00] have you know went and spend for like a
[1:28:04] week and then get to the promised
[1:28:10] lande but God made them turn around in
[1:28:13] the desert for 40
[1:28:16] years you know we think that you know it
[1:28:18] was a
[1:28:20] curse you know yes for others it was a
[1:28:22] curse they could didn't make it they
[1:28:27] died but God was working something was
[1:28:30] working out
[1:28:32] something because they say God knew that
[1:28:34] in the other side of the of the
[1:28:37] sea you know there was a
[1:28:40] girl who had to grow
[1:28:43] up and that took 40
[1:28:46] years for the children of Israel to
[1:28:49] cross
[1:28:50] over and arriving there you know found
[1:28:56] Rahab who RAB God prepared you know God
[1:28:59] you know when they were in the desert it
[1:29:01] was not
[1:29:03] easy you know marching on the sand and
[1:29:06] you know turning turning
[1:29:10] around you know but all of that was to
[1:29:13] prepare a a wife or a
[1:29:17] bride all of that was to work was to
[1:29:19] work Redemption for someone who was
[1:29:21] waiting there
[1:29:25] and we see that when they got there
[1:29:27] Rahab was redeemed you
[1:29:31] know Salomon you know married
[1:29:36] Rahab and then they gave a son
[1:29:41] boas Boaz in his
[1:29:43] turn you know
[1:29:45] Ruth who was
[1:29:48] somewhere you know God had to stck the
[1:29:51] land with famine
[1:29:55] you know to let someone leave that
[1:29:58] land to go to the land of
[1:30:02] Moab and God even went farther than
[1:30:06] that three people had to
[1:30:10] die you know God killed the two children
[1:30:12] of of
[1:30:15] Naomi and her husband you know all of
[1:30:19] that to save one
[1:30:21] person you know with that I want to say
[1:30:23] that God would do everything that he
[1:30:28] can to save you if you only believe you
[1:30:33] know if you can only have
[1:30:35] faith you know God will save you you
[1:30:38] know Jesus started the work of
[1:30:40] redemption in the Garden of
[1:30:42] Eden and he worked that work through the
[1:30:47] ages but that work was not
[1:30:51] complete until he died on the cross
[1:30:55] and the work of the
[1:30:56] Cross will not be
[1:30:59] completed until you accept him as a
[1:31:03] sa you know it's it's like a master who
[1:31:05] goes and he buys a slave pays for a
[1:31:11] slave you know the price has been
[1:31:15] paid but as long as it doesn't claim the
[1:31:18] slave as
[1:31:21] his or otherwise as long as the say the
[1:31:26] slave you know doesn't accept the price
[1:31:29] that has been
[1:31:31] paid you know that price means
[1:31:35] nothing you know Jesus Paid the price
[1:31:37] for our
[1:31:39] sins Jesus Paid the price for our
[1:31:43] Redemption you know the law required
[1:31:47] blood he shed his blood for us you know
[1:31:51] he the lamb he died for us he took up
[1:31:55] place he became a sinner so that we we
[1:31:58] be
[1:31:59] saved so the price is already
[1:32:02] paid but now it's only
[1:32:04] you you know you have to accept that
[1:32:07] price that was
[1:32:09] paid you know you have to come to Christ
[1:32:12] and say Lord Here I Am
[1:32:15] Lord Lord Here I Am Lord you know I I
[1:32:19] have tried it's like Peter who said Lord
[1:32:21] you know where do you want me to go
[1:32:25] there is nowhere else that I can go
[1:32:28] because it's in you that I find life you
[1:32:31] know the proc has already been paid you
[1:32:34] know what you have to do is to lay in
[1:32:36] the presence of the
[1:32:38] son you know like
[1:32:40] Ruth you know she had to go she had to
[1:32:43] lay in the presence you know in the
[1:32:45] presence of
[1:32:47] Boaz you know as as nature even nature
[1:32:51] teaches
[1:32:52] us that a seed
[1:32:55] before a seed
[1:32:57] grows that seed has to be has to lay in
[1:32:59] the presence of the
[1:33:01] sun and the sun will make that sea
[1:33:06] grow and that's the same thing with us
[1:33:09] we have the seed of God inside of us you
[1:33:13] know we have the seed of God inside of
[1:33:15] us and for that seed to be
[1:33:20] manifested we have to lay in the
[1:33:22] presence of the son
[1:33:24] we have to lay a
[1:33:26] Calvary we have to lay in the presence
[1:33:28] of Jesus
[1:33:30] Christ and he will work that seed
[1:33:33] out so sometimes you
[1:33:36] worry you said that but look at my sin
[1:33:39] look at what I have
[1:33:41] done you know it's so great you know
[1:33:44] it's it's so many I I can't I can't you
[1:33:47] know I'm ashamed on
[1:33:49] myself you know I did something that I
[1:33:51] don't even want to show up when people
[1:33:53] are there
[1:33:55] because they always remind me of what I
[1:33:57] did you know I shouldn't do this and I'm
[1:34:01] cursed and I can't be
[1:34:04] forgiven God doesn't even listen to my
[1:34:07] prayer you know the prophet
[1:34:10] says rest that that is Ruth Nomi talking
[1:34:14] to
[1:34:17] Ruth it says rest
[1:34:20] Ruth because the man will have no rest
[1:34:25] until he's done the full price of
[1:34:29] redemption amen the prophet said that
[1:34:31] right there is where I
[1:34:34] stand amen he will not
[1:34:37] rest until he's done the full price of
[1:34:41] redemption to redeem
[1:34:44] you everything that you ever
[1:34:47] lost everything that you
[1:34:50] was you know God will not rest
[1:34:53] until he sees
[1:34:55] you at the
[1:34:57] side so you have to stop
[1:35:01] worrying you know you have to stop
[1:35:03] thinking that what you have done is
[1:35:05] Unforgiven but you can't be
[1:35:09] forgiven you know you have to stop
[1:35:11] thinking that your sin is is powerful
[1:35:14] than God's
[1:35:17] blood know God if we go let's go to uh
[1:35:20] Isaiah chapter 1
[1:35:23] uh I think it's this
[1:35:25] one verse 16 to
[1:35:34] 17 ver verse 16 to verse 18
[1:35:38] sorry verse
[1:35:40] 19 the Bible
[1:35:42] says wash you and make you clean put
[1:35:47] away the evil of your doings from before
[1:35:51] mine eyes cease to do evil
[1:36:01] learn to do
[1:36:03] well seek
[1:36:06] judgment relieve the
[1:36:08] oppressed judge the
[1:36:11] fatherless plead for the
[1:36:13] Widow now Verse 18 it says that now come
[1:36:17] come
[1:36:18] now and let us reason together sayth the
[1:36:23] Lord
[1:36:24] though your sins be as
[1:36:28] carlet they shall be as white as
[1:36:32] snow though they be red like
[1:36:36] Crimson they shall be as
[1:36:39] wool if you be willing and
[1:36:43] obedient you shall eat the good of the
[1:36:48] land if you be willing and obedient
[1:36:53] the only thing that
[1:36:55] takes it's your will if you be willing
[1:36:59] and
[1:37:01] obedient you know you can come and
[1:37:03] reason together with
[1:37:05] Christ you know the prophet used this
[1:37:09] scripture to preach about to preach
[1:37:11] about our conference the message
[1:37:14] conference it says that every time
[1:37:17] something was wrong in the
[1:37:19] earth you know God had to have
[1:37:22] conference with his people
[1:37:25] God had to had a conference with with
[1:37:27] his
[1:37:28] people you know when Adam and Eve they
[1:37:31] seen you know God had to have a
[1:37:33] conference with them and what is a
[1:37:36] conference you know a conference is when
[1:37:39] we look you know we're trying to find a
[1:37:41] solution for
[1:37:44] something you know we see that when
[1:37:46] there is wars in the
[1:37:48] world or this nation and that Nation
[1:37:50] doesn't you know they they can't get
[1:37:52] together
[1:37:55] you know they call for a
[1:37:57] conference you know there's a climate
[1:37:59] change they call for a
[1:38:02] conference and that conference you know
[1:38:04] is to find a solution how to stop that
[1:38:09] thing you know and and though you know
[1:38:12] with us human you know they will try to
[1:38:15] each of us you know each country will
[1:38:18] try to to show how benefit is it is to
[1:38:21] to keep doing the same thing
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] but at the end of the day they will come
[1:38:30] to one you know one
[1:38:33] conclusion and that's the same thing
[1:38:35] that God is saying here in Isaiah
[1:38:36] chapter 1 verse Verse
[1:38:44] 18 you know God is saying come you know
[1:38:47] he's calling you to a conference you
[1:38:51] know I always say that if for example
[1:38:53] let's say that the president of the
[1:38:54] United
[1:38:57] States you know he calls us for a
[1:39:00] conference you know we'll be
[1:39:02] happy even though we we don't like the
[1:39:06] person but it will do us something you
[1:39:08] know to to feel like the president has
[1:39:10] called me for a
[1:39:13] conf and then we'll go tell the people
[1:39:16] about
[1:39:17] that we'll start thinking about that
[1:39:20] conference
[1:39:23] let's say if the conference is like next
[1:39:27] week you know we'll start thinking about
[1:39:30] that conference
[1:39:32] today you know you will try to you know
[1:39:35] to see what which clothes uh will I put
[1:39:40] on or how am I going to get there you
[1:39:44] know you will try to get yourself
[1:39:46] ready but the sad thing is that the Lord
[1:39:50] of
[1:39:51] lords you know the all Mighty
[1:39:54] God he's calling us for a
[1:39:58] conference but the sad thing is that
[1:40:00] it's not everybody who answers to that
[1:40:04] call you know why we love the thing that
[1:40:07] we
[1:40:08] do you know we love the sin or the
[1:40:11] situation that we're
[1:40:14] in that when God calls us for a
[1:40:17] conference you know we think that you
[1:40:19] know it'll take us a lot to for to
[1:40:22] forsake whatever we're
[1:40:27] doing to have a life
[1:40:30] change you know to become a
[1:40:33] Christian you know you will say that
[1:40:35] people will mock at
[1:40:36] us you know people will say that hey
[1:40:39] this man has changed and it's not you
[1:40:41] know it's not up to date
[1:40:46] anymore but let let me tell you that
[1:40:50] everybody in the Bible
[1:40:54] or even
[1:40:55] now who serve
[1:40:57] Christ you know they always have to go
[1:41:00] through
[1:41:02] persecution you know they have to bear
[1:41:04] they have to to have their own
[1:41:08] cross because otherwise you won't be
[1:41:10] worthy to follow
[1:41:13] Christ you know God will do
[1:41:16] everything to save you he took a
[1:41:19] Christian family to back sleep
[1:41:23] to save to save one
[1:41:27] person to save Ruth you know it maybe
[1:41:30] maybe you find yourself in a backl you
[1:41:32] know you find yourself in a position
[1:41:34] that you think that you
[1:41:37] backl you know it's not too late to come
[1:41:40] back to
[1:41:41] Christ you know he still has his arm
[1:41:43] wide
[1:41:45] open waiting for you it's like that
[1:41:49] prodigal
[1:41:50] son when he made up his mind to go back
[1:41:52] to his parents
[1:41:54] house you know the thing amazing is that
[1:41:57] his father saw him from
[1:42:01] afar and he was standing at the gate
[1:42:04] waiting for the waiting for his
[1:42:07] son you know his son was in his way back
[1:42:10] to his
[1:42:12] father you know he was thinking about
[1:42:14] the word you know trying to uh uh fix
[1:42:17] the word how he would convince his
[1:42:19] father to get him back
[1:42:25] but what he didn't know was that his
[1:42:28] father was waiting for
[1:42:30] him and that's the same thing with us
[1:42:34] you know you might think that hey I have
[1:42:35] to make a beautiful
[1:42:37] prayer you to be saved I have to be
[1:42:41] clean or I have to be in a certain place
[1:42:43] or in a certain
[1:42:47] position to receive the Holy Spirit you
[1:42:50] know the prophet says that that doesn't
[1:42:51] work
[1:42:53] even himself the prophet you know they
[1:42:56] say they told him brother BR for you to
[1:42:58] be saved or to receive the Holy
[1:43:01] Spirit you know this is how you have to
[1:43:04] phrase your your
[1:43:09] prayer you know you have to go to God
[1:43:11] and say dear
[1:43:13] Lord and use all the big word that you
[1:43:17] know it says that that will never
[1:43:20] work because there is no sincere it in
[1:43:24] it but a sincere
[1:43:27] heart tells God everything how it
[1:43:32] is you're talking to him and you telling
[1:43:35] him how you
[1:43:37] feel you know if there's something that
[1:43:40] you still
[1:43:41] love that you can't get rid
[1:43:44] of Lord you know that I love this
[1:43:47] thing Lord you know that this body
[1:43:50] always want to look at this you know I
[1:43:52] still have that desire to go back to
[1:43:58] it but I don't want to be like
[1:44:00] that I need your
[1:44:02] forgiveness then he will forgive you
[1:44:06] because it takes
[1:44:08] sincerity amen and and then we see that
[1:44:10] he took the children of Israel 40 years
[1:44:13] as we
[1:44:15] say so that one girl be
[1:44:19] saved you know he and then it would take
[1:44:22] everything
[1:44:27] to get you back to
[1:44:29] him you know Jesus we see
[1:44:32] Jesus in the weakest time of his
[1:44:36] life you know there at the
[1:44:38] cross when someone came to
[1:44:42] him he wanted to mock at
[1:44:45] Jesus then he put a board on top of his
[1:44:50] head saying that this is the King of the
[1:44:54] Jews you know that was a mockery for
[1:44:57] him but what he didn't know is that that
[1:45:01] same
[1:45:03] word that he put on top of Jesus
[1:45:07] head was able to save
[1:45:10] someone at that very same
[1:45:13] time you know we look at that that that
[1:45:17] at the
[1:45:18] cross you know if we go if we we we go
[1:45:22] uh through the process of
[1:45:25] repentance and we try to judge that
[1:45:27] Thief at the
[1:45:30] cross you know none of us will say that
[1:45:32] that if at the cross follow the
[1:45:34] procedure of
[1:45:40] repentance because we never seen in the
[1:45:42] Bible where that of the Cross
[1:45:47] prayed regretting his sin saying Lord
[1:45:49] forgive oh Lord I have done evil
[1:45:57] that if at the cross we never
[1:46:00] seen him praying for a whole
[1:46:03] hour for his
[1:46:06] repentance but what what God looked
[1:46:08] beyond
[1:46:10] that God saw their
[1:46:13] heart God saw the sincerity that was in
[1:46:16] his
[1:46:17] heart and therefore God knew his
[1:46:21] desire Jesus told
[1:46:23] him that you but this
[1:46:26] night you be with me and it was the
[1:46:29] first
[1:46:31] one you know to go to go tell the all
[1:46:34] the apost all the the
[1:46:39] prophets that there's a man coming after
[1:46:42] me who is going to free
[1:46:45] you you know that man who did not have
[1:46:48] who did not do uh he didn't do a long
[1:46:51] prayer
[1:46:55] but he just say one
[1:46:58] word when you will be in that
[1:47:02] Kingdom remember
[1:47:04] me that was a sincere
[1:47:08] prayer that was a sincere
[1:47:11] request that he did or he made Lord when
[1:47:15] you will
[1:47:17] be remember me so it doesn't matter how
[1:47:21] well your prayer is
[1:47:25] you know it doesn't matter how you try
[1:47:26] to phrase
[1:47:28] things or you try to make it
[1:47:31] beautiful so that The Neighbor Next to
[1:47:33] You may not understand everything that
[1:47:35] you're
[1:47:38] saying or it doesn't matter how big how
[1:47:41] many big words you use when you
[1:47:44] pray what it
[1:47:46] matters it's a
[1:47:49] sincerity a sincere
[1:47:51] heart that can say Lord remember me the
[1:47:56] sincere heart that can say Lord when you
[1:48:00] will answer to the prayer of my
[1:48:03] neighbor Lord Remember Me Lord think
[1:48:07] about
[1:48:08] me and when your prayer is
[1:48:11] sincere you know
[1:48:14] God he will save you the prophet says
[1:48:17] that God never separated the bride from
[1:48:19] the groom
[1:48:23] he says but
[1:48:25] remember he went there with you in
[1:48:30] him see God had never separated the
[1:48:34] bride from the
[1:48:37] groom so when God looked down upon the
[1:48:41] body of
[1:48:45] Christ he saw both male and
[1:48:50] female it was all redeemed in that one
[1:48:56] body they are one same word the same
[1:49:01] word spoke of the
[1:49:04] groom that same word speaks of the
[1:49:07] Bride you know it's it's like in
[1:49:11] Genesis I think Genesis chapter 3 or
[1:49:15] 4 when God called Adam and and and
[1:49:21] Eve you know God called them at the same
[1:49:24] the same
[1:49:26] name he say Adam I'm trying to find the
[1:49:41] verse
[1:49:43] yeah I can't find it it's somewhere
[1:49:47] here I can't find it but the prophet
[1:49:50] says well how can a bride how well how
[1:49:55] can the Bride
[1:49:57] come and fail to manifest everything
[1:50:01] that was promised of
[1:50:05] him and the groom
[1:50:07] come and he wouldn't be the
[1:50:11] bride but when he did
[1:50:15] everything even to proving it by raising
[1:50:18] himself up up from the dead
[1:50:23] then the prophet says that the bride
[1:50:24] have to do the same
[1:50:28] thing the bride have to be exactly what
[1:50:31] the word said she would be in this last
[1:50:39] days the prophet said the prophet asked
[1:50:41] a question said don't she have to return
[1:50:44] through Malachi
[1:50:48] 4 don't she have to be manifested like
[1:50:51] it was in the days of
[1:50:55] Sodom don't the world have to be just
[1:50:59] exactly like it
[1:51:04] is it's not this uh it's not these
[1:51:07] things a perfect identification of the
[1:51:10] word of God made known to
[1:51:15] us so in other words if the world
[1:51:20] condition has to be as God said it was
[1:51:22] in Sodom and
[1:51:27] gomorra you know if the Judgment has to
[1:51:29] stke the
[1:51:32] Earth you know if that word is
[1:51:35] true the prophet says that that that
[1:51:37] means that the bride and God and the
[1:51:39] bride and the
[1:51:42] groom or it is it's also true as the
[1:51:46] bride and the groom are
[1:51:50] one so now let's let's
[1:51:53] what the Lord required for
[1:51:58] Redemption you know we see that before a
[1:52:00] man could redeem his Lost
[1:52:05] Property the Bible says that that man
[1:52:07] had to be the nearest
[1:52:11] Kinsman and we see that Jesus you know
[1:52:14] Jesus was made himself our
[1:52:19] nearest because when we came to the
[1:52:22] world
[1:52:24] the devil was our our nearest
[1:52:28] Kinsman because we looked more like him
[1:52:31] than we did we look like like
[1:52:36] Christ because we were a
[1:52:38] sinner you know we did some wrong
[1:52:42] stuff and Jesus he was
[1:52:45] holy so no way we did look like
[1:52:50] Christ so the devil was our nearest
[1:52:53] kinsman
[1:52:57] redeemer but when the question was
[1:53:01] asked if the if it was able to redeem
[1:53:06] us it didn't have what it takes to
[1:53:08] redeem
[1:53:10] us because it takes
[1:53:13] someone who can become a
[1:53:17] sinner who can take your
[1:53:19] place to redeem you so was no way that
[1:53:23] the devil can could become a sinner
[1:53:28] again or there was no way that the devil
[1:53:31] could make himself another
[1:53:36] devil there is no way that the devil or
[1:53:39] Lucifer can can share can shed his blood
[1:53:42] for
[1:53:46] you so God you know God
[1:53:50] came you know he made himself a man he
[1:53:54] became a sinner you know he took our
[1:53:57] sins upon
[1:53:59] him you know he became our nearest
[1:54:01] Kinsman redeem our nearest
[1:54:04] Kinsmen so that he can be able to redeem
[1:54:08] us so therefore when the Devil comes and
[1:54:11] try to remind you about the thing that
[1:54:12] you
[1:54:15] did you know you also have to remind him
[1:54:19] he said that but the question was asked
[1:54:21] to you
[1:54:24] if you were able to redeem
[1:54:26] me but you were
[1:54:28] quiet you didn't say a
[1:54:31] word so therefore you have no you have
[1:54:33] no authority to come remind me about
[1:54:35] what I
[1:54:37] did you know as long as my sins are
[1:54:41] forgiven you know they're gone
[1:54:44] forever
[1:54:46] amen the devil the prophet says that the
[1:54:50] so the next morning
[1:54:53] the next
[1:54:55] morning then he had to make a public
[1:55:00] testimony he went down and met this man
[1:55:03] at the
[1:55:05] gate before the
[1:55:08] elders and he had to be in a public
[1:55:12] place and he looked him in the face and
[1:55:17] can you redeem
[1:55:19] her now if he had to first uh now if he
[1:55:23] had to uh now if he had to redeem
[1:55:29] her he had to redeem first
[1:55:33] Naomi in order to get
[1:55:36] Ruth and Christ had to redeem the
[1:55:41] Jewish the the Jewish church first in
[1:55:44] order to get the Gentile
[1:55:48] bride she come in with Naomi
[1:55:52] as an alien from another
[1:55:55] country a
[1:55:57] MOAB
[1:55:59] heathens that's what we
[1:56:02] were the
[1:56:03] Gentiles
[1:56:05] ethen and remember he had to get
[1:56:10] Naomi and when he got
[1:56:12] Naomi he got all that she
[1:56:17] had remember when Christ
[1:56:20] come he never spoke of the Gentile
[1:56:25] church he was going to his
[1:56:30] own he came to his
[1:56:32] own his own received him
[1:56:36] not he was always to the lost sheep of
[1:56:47] Israel and as you
[1:56:49] go preach the gospel
[1:56:52] then that's when he told the the
[1:56:55] disciples he said that heal the
[1:56:58] sick ra the Dead cast out Devils freely
[1:57:03] as you give give freely as you you
[1:57:08] receive send them two by
[1:57:12] two and he had to redeem that
[1:57:16] church and when he redeemed that church
[1:57:19] he got the Gentile bride amen
[1:57:23] that was the bargain in
[1:57:27] it he got the bride when he redeemed the
[1:57:32] church you know we see that when Jesus
[1:57:35] came you know the Bible clearly says
[1:57:38] that came for his own for the
[1:57:41] je you know even when that lady came to
[1:57:45] him you know praying asking God to heal
[1:57:49] her you know Jesus told him that we can
[1:57:51] never give the bread you know of the
[1:57:54] children to the
[1:57:57] dogs you know when he sent the disciple
[1:58:00] when he sent them at the first time to
[1:58:02] go
[1:58:04] preach he sent them to the
[1:58:06] Jews you know God had to redeem them
[1:58:10] first before he get to
[1:58:13] you you know that's why the Bible says
[1:58:16] Paul
[1:58:17] says that God had to cut that branch
[1:58:20] that first Branch the original branch
[1:58:25] to take another
[1:58:27] Branch who was from another
[1:58:30] nature to plug that Branch into the
[1:58:33] original
[1:58:37] tree that branch that was planted that
[1:58:39] is us the
[1:58:44] Gentiles God created a space for
[1:58:48] us for us to be saved for us to to re to
[1:58:53] rec to know him as
[1:58:56] Christ and that space that he
[1:58:59] created or that door that he
[1:59:02] opened it's not forever it will not last
[1:59:06] forever there's a specific time for that
[1:59:10] door and that door is closing right now
[1:59:15] because God has to turn back to the to
[1:59:17] the
[1:59:19] Jews you know God has to turn back to
[1:59:21] his
[1:59:23] brother you know it's like Joseph you
[1:59:26] know there at the the kingdom the palace
[1:59:29] where there
[1:59:31] was you know when he was about to turn
[1:59:33] down to to turn uh uh to his to his
[1:59:38] brother you know he sent his children
[1:59:40] and his wife to the
[1:59:45] bedroom and that is the thing that is
[1:59:47] about to
[1:59:48] happen you know God is closing the door
[1:59:51] to the G
[1:59:54] God is about to turn his back to
[1:59:58] us and when that that when God turns
[2:00:01] himself when God turn his back to
[2:00:06] us there will be no
[2:00:09] salvation when God turns his back to us
[2:00:13] to
[2:00:14] us you know you can cry as as hard as
[2:00:18] you
[2:00:19] can or you can cry as loud as you
[2:00:25] can you will never be saved because
[2:00:28] there will be no
[2:00:30] mercy there will be judgment for the
[2:00:32] rest of the
[2:00:33] world so now while this door is still
[2:00:38] open why don't you press into
[2:00:42] it you know why that door is still
[2:00:46] open you know there is still a little
[2:00:48] space you know in that door
[2:00:52] why don't you go through
[2:00:54] it you know why don't you come to that
[2:00:57] door you know why don't you join the
[2:01:00] others you know there is a joy on the
[2:01:03] other side of the
[2:01:06] river a
[2:01:08] joy on the other side of of the
[2:01:11] river that can never be compared to this
[2:01:14] one you know it's like a brother who
[2:01:16] asked the prophet he says the brother BR
[2:01:19] are we still going to to to hun
[2:01:24] squir the prophet said that I don't
[2:01:26] think when we'll be on the other side
[2:01:27] we'll be we'll still have that desire to
[2:01:31] hunt it says compare yourself when you
[2:01:35] was when you were in your mother's
[2:01:40] womb you had pleasure being
[2:01:43] there you were satisfied being there in
[2:01:46] that little world that you
[2:01:49] had you thought that that was the best
[2:01:51] place for you to
[2:01:53] be but once you came
[2:01:56] out I'm pretty sure that none of us will
[2:01:59] will prefer to go back to to to his
[2:02:02] mother to his mother's
[2:02:05] wom and that is the same thing with god
[2:02:08] with with with
[2:02:10] Heaven you know that is the same thing
[2:02:13] with the other side of the
[2:02:16] veil you know it's so beautiful that
[2:02:18] that that that beauty can never be
[2:02:20] compared to this beauty that we see
[2:02:24] here you know he can never he cannot be
[2:02:27] compared how we're living today
[2:02:32] today so why don't you make your way to
[2:02:36] it you know Jesus says that you know I
[2:02:39] have water free
[2:02:41] water you know there is a fountain that
[2:02:43] that has been opened in the House of
[2:02:49] David who wanted
[2:02:52] and that Fountain has no price you have
[2:02:54] nothing to
[2:02:57] pay you know God says come buy from me
[2:03:00] with no money and not paying
[2:03:05] anything you know God wants to save you
[2:03:07] more than what you
[2:03:10] want you know God wants to see you at
[2:03:13] his
[2:03:15] side so why don't you answer to that
[2:03:19] call why don't you answer to the call of
[2:03:23] God the Bible says in Revelation uh
[2:03:26] chapter 3 verse uh verse
[2:03:33] 23 or
[2:03:36] verse3 Revelation 3:
[2:03:41] 20 the Bible says behold I stand at the
[2:03:44] door and
[2:03:47] knock if any hear my
[2:03:50] voice and open the door I will come to
[2:03:55] him and will St with him and he with
[2:04:02] me Jesus is standing at the
[2:04:05] door the prophet says that Jesus
[2:04:07] knocking at the
[2:04:09] door you know he says that he can
[2:04:11] represent your brother talking to
[2:04:16] you or a message that you hear at
[2:04:20] church or a preacher you're preaching
[2:04:22] something that really touch your
[2:04:26] heart you know every time that you feel
[2:04:28] that
[2:04:30] call it's Jesus knocking at that
[2:04:34] door and that
[2:04:37] knock or him knocking at the
[2:04:40] door it's not
[2:04:44] forever because if you have a
[2:04:47] visitor who's trying to ring or knock at
[2:04:49] the door
[2:04:52] he has a certain level of
[2:04:55] patience you know when he knocks and he
[2:04:57] see that people are not in the in the
[2:05:00] house he will leave you know he might
[2:05:04] leave you a message saying that hey I
[2:05:06] was here but you
[2:05:08] weren't or you can just go and walk away
[2:05:12] you know that's the same thing with
[2:05:14] Jesus you know the patience of
[2:05:16] Jesus you know has a level has a has a
[2:05:20] time you know and and and when Jesus is
[2:05:23] knocking at the
[2:05:24] door you know you have to run and open
[2:05:28] that
[2:05:29] door before it's too
[2:05:31] late now Jesus is knocking at the
[2:05:34] door you know if you heard this message
[2:05:37] this morning and and and you felt in
[2:05:39] your heart that this is God calling me
[2:05:41] to to
[2:05:45] repent you know if you heard this
[2:05:47] message this morning and you felt like
[2:05:49] this is God's calling

[2:05:58] feeling like
[2:06:01] this or Lord why am I feeling this
[2:06:04] burden you know you calling
[2:06:09] me it's because he wants to save
[2:06:12] you and Jesus wants to save you more
[2:06:16] than what more than what you
[2:06:18] want and as we read Jesus is knocking at
[2:06:20] the door
[2:06:24] you know he didn't rest until Ruth was
[2:06:29] redeemed he didn't
[2:06:31] rest until RAB was
[2:06:34] saved and he will not
[2:06:37] rest you are
[2:06:39] saved so God will pursue
[2:06:42] you God will do
[2:06:45] everything you know every work that it
[2:06:48] takes for him to save you but don't step
[2:06:53] on what God is saying what the work of
