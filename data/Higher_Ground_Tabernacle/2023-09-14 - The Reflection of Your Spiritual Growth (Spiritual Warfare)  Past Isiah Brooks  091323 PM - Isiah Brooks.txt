that somehow bringing in such a way that is one of us will leave out here blessed because we come to church the holy spirit will move within us bring us uh to a conviction if necessary come to be Sanctified amen before we come to that perfect perfect place in Christ so Jude 1. we're going to read from the 20th to the 23rd verse and it reads easy but ye be loved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost S [Music] free keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and some have compassion making a difference and others say with fear pull them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh this will be reading from the third verse to the seventh verse amen third verse reads for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty to God to the pulling down of strongholds is casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bring it to captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled news do you look on things after the outward appearance If any man trusts himself uh trust to himself that he is Christ let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are we Christopher hallelujah amen let us pray Our Father God we thank you for your grace thank you for the lovely day Lord God that you have given unto us father you have kept us from all hurt harm you have kept us full and Anointed with the Holy Ghost and we so thank you for a lovely day father bless the service tonight grant us Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message the reflection of your spiritual growth and the reason why I am bringing it out because every man every woman is who claimed to be Christians should always take inventory of their spiritual growth so much show that when the Lord comes it's always good to be ready uh just going to give you a little illustration when I was a boy we used to catch the city bus downtown and we knew uh the time that the bus would come to that particular stop and there are other people who are waiting God is on a schedule right and when God time is to translate he's not going to send someone by your house to say you got five minutes before I come it is against the word Bible said behold I come quickly and every man is he tells us about the ranches son and she was waiting in the door he was being criticized she was waiting in the foreign [Music] you reflect the light of God we reflect the light of God I have in my notes take God at his words and the Bride of Jesus Christ is ordained and take God at his word I can recall a couple of incidents one is when Peter was on the sea and Jesus came Walking On The Water Peter said Lord did not reason with himself in his heart Hallelujah and he did not hesitate and when he began to walk on the water never thought about the impossibility he just thought about the possibility Hallelujah is that right in other words he did and she asked Hallelujah [Music] she she could have said a lot of things but the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] Hallelujah because in this day they have made science is that right science just didn't happen it was a very tall like ever he gave her the scientific way of reproducing with God had already given them away was by the spoken words because in that day it was a seduce doctor who seduced Eve and by one word he added one word now I'm gonna say things so that you will understand where I'm going for companies you and I have come through a lot of Trials and and you know in so doing we have come through a lot of doctrines we have heard a lot of things but I want to say tonight in order to see the full effects you must dump out the junk everything that doesn't coincide with the message Hallelujah why because if you don't because Satan will keep from making making a Rapture we've come not only to justify but the message Hallelujah not only to sanctify fill us with the Holy Ghost and in order for God you must do something Hallelujah he said that is not a victory it is apparent Victory if God puts you through a hole push you through the pipes there is no victory in there you must do something is that right he said the word of God according to Matthew 25 um Revelations has made herself ready Hallelujah building up your Most Holy Faith when it comes to building up your most holy things I believe Jude had Peter in Mind of a perfect man it's your Most Holy Faith that is the divine nature of God Hallelujah is that right and then did it talk in well talking about this he tells us not to forget our Brethren Republic Hallelujah because someone not as strong as we are some we have to have compassion the difference all right and then some of them yeah Hallelujah because they have allowed themselves to be given over to enticing spirits [Music] there is no reasoning Hallelujah now think about it if Moses I mean excuse me Noah annoying had reasoned with himself thought that he would um better buildings he had to do it according to the patterns no it was familiar with the Woody white no good but God told him and without foreign [Music] [Music] we all go through a lot of things but we sometimes forget that the weapons of our Warfare are not carnalism we fight the Devils Hallelujah and when evil thought listen every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God the Bible said bring it into captivity to The Obedience of Christ and sometimes you gotta wrestle with it [Music] bring it down you and I are here I thought about this the other day Jesus Christ has never asked us to do anything Hallelujah you've never seen Jesus amen saying to Judas I hate you hate you hey no he understood who Jesus Judas was when he chose Judas was the devil but Jesus loved his enemies is that right you said well that was Jesus said Hey brother he said you couldn't tell Hallelujah [Music] that's right see what we must understand saying that we are Christians does it make us a Christian you got to be born again and really when you're born again do everything you know I love her you don't know you're not obedient to the world Hallelujah your testimony is alive you say I love you Lord and John said if you don't even love your brother you're a lion and you you hate your brother you see him once you don't love him Hallelujah the word of God I'm trying to tell us that it is an enticing experience that will make you call yourself uh that would make you say a lover brother listen what brother Randall said in there are 45. he says now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first [Music] um these other things will be added he goes to say I am positive sure this morning man listen closely if men and women could only get the position of where their souls will be perfect in the sight of God be one of the most powerful churches see that's something we must do I'm going to defend yielding is he all um yes sir Hallelujah in this message he talks about a little lad it also means trying to put the coat on the ladies in the wrong direction Hallelujah right so what it is I said well the child in his mind trying to help you but God don't need your help [Music] it is Hallelujah I tell you what I've seen so many Christian Liars no such a thing is a deceitful hard thing a demonstrations he said and your body wasn't made to life for person in the day you're made up you to do that so I want you to understand you have been enticed Hallelujah Hallelujah only the pure in hearts Hallelujah that's what people don't know Hallelujah God knows your heart to be double-minded ways not agreeing with your hair the heart the mind that's in your heart is not agreeing with the mind that's in your head amen it's like healing in your mind [Music] foreign [Music] Hallelujah some of these cops weren't in here I was just having a message together but I thought Lord I need some quotes Hallelujah he said I say today any people that really wants to find God they won't let no Church dictate to them things that they can't live if you've got the nature of God in you you go to Holiness y'all hear what I'm saying so I don't have to preach on how to dress holy come on the Holy Ghost will lead you into Holy Spirit oh yes I've used this testimony before remember when I first God gave me the Holy Ghost go down to town Hallelujah I went down there with my short song You Know ready to go swimming in the house he waited till I got to the tickets and I looked down [Laughter] and I realized I was naked new and I ran all the way home swim in that day so what I'm trying to say you don't have to tell you when you're naked he will show you your naked Hallelujah the Holy Ghost goes for holiness you go the right thing you'll go to the right thing you stand for the right thing you do the right thing you would think the right thing you live the right things do you like Chris if you're a Christian when I read that he said if you're a Christian Hallelujah you love the anointing this is so embarrassing and all I could think about it is that you are men and away from blasphemy when you see somebody shouting praising God and that's embarrassing to you somebody Hallelujah and I said to them I do not apologize but listen when I was a boy I got whooped beaten puppy proper Hallelujah and right now amen to know men cannot cry they are in prison a seducing Spirit how in the world you can't when God records your tears according to the scripture keeps your tears in a bottle Hallelujah and I don't know when the Holy Ghost comes on me I could care less how you feel sorry how many times I've gotten on my knees to pray come here for Australia my trials have been so hard to cry and I can't cry so my heart goes out at all everybody who stopped up you know what I'm saying you need some water soften you up hey it is what it is hallelujah he said you live the right thing I had to read this one again and if you're a Christian if you're a devil like the things of the devil yeah [Music] where are you at today you claiming to be up here listening to them matter if you have to stand alone [Music] and women I've got to stand alone I'm never alone it is not this is not I don't look for approval Hallelujah the only person I look for approval foreign foreign [Music] Hallelujah you love the Lord listen Equity coming from the same dances he looks on the heart where on the inside God you look at the uh your life speaks as loud as your confessions and that's what happens even among the message people want some great Pope the zombies well the pope y'all know who he is right he's the head of the enticing yeah that's all I'm saying we know we've been taught stand what we're working with oh we don't mess with denominations no brother because I don't believe that she says hallelujah they were in the church when Israel was the church Hallelujah those same Spirits like Balaam was in the church I mean you you yes yes you must understand there's there's two types yeah yeah two you do even in the church age books if the Bride of Jesus Christ come to the place where she deserved between the two Spirits Hallelujah she will become what is because stop listening to what man say and get back to the world but when your confessions say one thing that's because you've got an intellectual Faith it's not a Faith from your heart that shows that outside here the knowledge of God the same scientific things would prove that that wasn't the right wasn't the right prove it you see what I'm saying now you say well I'm just steady reading down so amen just bear with me amen paragraph 52. he said give me a preacher Christians give me a housewife give me a farmer a factory worker the the the factor that will put God first in everything [Music] all the devils Hallelujah understand me anything that comes to your mind it was an enticing experience and that Spirit comes to kill you you understand me let me put it this way Kane's daddy was a murderer and he seduced Eve Hallelujah is that right and what happened was a murderer every son of the Devils because the Devil is a murderer every son of the Devils because Satan is the father of lies and has come to express his being Amen to express his characteristics it's a Holy Spirit [Laughter] Hallelujah see Satan is an enticing Spirit Hallelujah he has the ability to kill you with by one word now being manifested through his children you call the devil's children cursed with children Jews there are two Spirits within the framework of the church and Abel is the simple farmer yeah Hallelujah [Music] yes sir Esau looked like he was the right one is that right yeah he did all the good chores he did all the church he could do to help the church nothing about the Holy ghosts [Music] [Music] [Music] they got it prepared [Music] [Music] amen amen you say oh no brother and I cannot be deceived I beg your pardon I beg your pardon the things that I just called out you are all ready to see because abroad is in His image and when I say deceive if you are willfully knowing you're doing wrong and you got demons whoo that's what brother Brown said it's a script rmd Hallelujah is that right is it right think about how how Ahab the King was deceived Spirits when those 400 preachers came down and deceived Ahab Hallelujah there was one man that knew differently yeah something was wrong let me say it like this we should know this message [Music] especially when he's exalting himself when a preacher gets up here and he wants to rule you evil you know this is the devil [Music] right we call it the Deeds of the Nicolaitans Hallelujah brother random said that the Deeds of the Nickelodeon and balamism is the same Basics the worship Jesus Christ [Music] yes and when Michael said go on up there Jehovah you know a lot of time people know they're wrong but they feel like it's good you know popularity if everybody else is going with it I might as well go with it let me tell you something the majority always been wrong it was a majority of the people that crucified Jesus majority has always been wrong what in the world's going on you know what I'm gonna tell you something and I used to before God called me to Pastor I want to join my pillow I worked as an evangelist and and during that time of learning I found out that among the message there's such a system politics it is why and it's everywhere it's about to it's about it's a body system it's your own system if you're in my body I'll give you a good offering As Long as You Preach what I want praise [Music] you wouldn't you wouldn't believe some of the stuff I've gone through this message what people do to me that's what matters [Music] amen Hallelujah let me tell you something listen when God hates something there is no place of redemption for an example Jacob I love Jacob Jimmy Esau I hate and Esau had no place for Redemption is that could be done hallelujah what people don't understand when God says certain things are an Abomination you understand me and when people willfully that is abomination with God you think it's going to go on God said it's enough he always give us space to repentance [Music] this is where we are he said if you love me Hallelujah [Music] but when you love him Hallelujah is that all right so why there's no life in religion Hallelujah you can have all the religion in the world brother Brandon talks about how the Hindu religion is beautiful religions you know Buddhism Christianity is the only thing that gives you life hallelujah amen and listen people of God he talks about false teeth he said that's how position [Music] and I'm like oh my goodness man I think you I'm thinking to myself man you're a dude with the ball head don't mind me yeah when my time comes if it should come he sees I'm trying to hold on to that little piece I got but one day but it's okay it's okay you know it's okay you know what I mean right brother right it's just for an appearance anyhow all right listen I'm trying to tell us something here because if we're not careful we'll fall into this starchy mode and I'm going to ask you a question if Jesus was standing here what would your thought what would your thoughts be would you be sitting in your chair like you are now let me tell you something early church even in the Pentecostal Church in the 70s but things have gotten so cold [Music] that's nonsense love that kind of worship s [Music] don't let this I don't care yes hallelujah amen glory to God don't you Hallelujah paragraph 89. if I wanted to be in the Methodist Church I'd go to one Hallelujah some of those churches are more fired up than the message sometimes this is some flowers Hallelujah is that all right it's all right Hallelujah so just because we [Music] [Laughter] possible Hallelujah don't believe those enticing Spirits a real spirit of God a real word of God is the truth of God will produce God in your life his face you say what are you saying brother Brooks there's a lot of in this innocence know nothing about Godly give yourself [Music] they have no idea but yet they call themselves Christians and they said oh we're in the message so you've never sinned in the first place that that quote is for Holy Ghost Field peace in other words you reading somebody else's letter yep that's true amen amen you know a lot of people you know and what they when they use that quote Spirit comes along you think that they can do whatever they want to hello the blood of Jesus Christ that justifies you can Sanctified don't blame God your blood is here for you to be here [Applause] Hallelujah amen let me move on among a lot of people we find where emotions they become tattling and all kinds of ungodly things that sulfuric acid in the church men and women this is pretty so many different yet among one another and try to push off safe this is not right this is not right and that's not right if you chase it down nine times out of the ten it's the very person making the stir that's not right right amen God hates Discord among Brethren did y'all hear that word he didn't say dislike it hates it foreign be holy son love God images stand by him and as long as you know your life is uh dividing up with the Bible with purity of heart difficulty of thoughts trying your best to up build you can have all the things and everybody will believe it right so that's it this is um I make mistakes because of what he's done for us repentance you can't say I'm sorry and then don't repent from it Hallelujah I'm going on but this enticing Spirit paragraph 81. what is done today oh my God to make more church members to make better church members um [Music] you're dividing it [Music] we don't do it come on somebody [Music] and all of a sudden that baby that was how can you say it that was actually on her nerves has now become a a big bundle of love um [Music] [Music] yeah ah I can't help it I just get excited oh streets look what he says and these are not my words now if this quote is wrong and all the rest of them are too I know it permitted the men to have social parties with one another it is out into the basement where they would play games they were praying for the holy ghosts permitted we come together that'll never take the place women that way they go out and dress today um I gotta finish this these Spirits are now circulating among the messages the dresses are getting tighter the heels are getting higher [Music] I'm the man on the wall s and if it worked for him yes sir yes sir yes sir oh the blood of Jesus of Jesus is out protected from Satan I'm gonna tell you something if you don't receive this amount s Hallelujah you had to get baptized and if you had repairs [Music] thank God massage [Music] yeah you got to teach them this and teach them that nowhere you might think I'm being hard I'm not everybody it ain't all in our emotions and that life must change you must change into His Image [Music] himself in an enticing Spirit way director let me use this for an example that enticing Spirit came into the message yeah I don't know how it is you know back in Africa but I don't know where's the Holy Ghost oh we don't need the gifts no more oh no no no don't take the holy ghost from me because it's a gift y'all understand me because we don't need this let me say something to you in this message y'all remember the scripture lost one of her coins she knew her husband was coming back and she called to her neighbors help me sweep and clean the house and the prophet God said it like this how many coins have you lost and you know the Lord so when she gathered those neighbors together that God will restore my long suffering oh my God something here it's one of the coins go listen to the message massage listen paragraph 31 I'm Gonna Let You Go you know we could sing too much we could shout too much and we could sing at the wrong time at the wrong time never out of order when we're praying [Music] without doubt it soon our petition will be granted not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere for Your Great Name to be honored today so that the under the sound of our voice [Music] you see everybody that comes to this church claim to be a message believer but everybody is not and I'm not saying this so that you can go figure out who isn't it [Music] must be the reflection this message nobody else is doing it you must be the reflection Hallelujah and I hope by the grace of God I gave you more grace show us what he hates and so you don't understand [Music] right y'all better hear what I'm saying cause you cannot love God then hate your brothers the Bible says love one another he is in the Life having Fellowship one with one with another Blood of Jesus Christ cleans you from all unrighteousness there was a lot I wanted to say but I'll say this by the grace of God not to make you feel you gotta believe God foreign what do you think your problem is nothing oh yeah if God said he has Sanctified you that's what he meant for somebody that's how easy it goes let go and let God oh Lord I don't know how to get let go away my physical man is doing
