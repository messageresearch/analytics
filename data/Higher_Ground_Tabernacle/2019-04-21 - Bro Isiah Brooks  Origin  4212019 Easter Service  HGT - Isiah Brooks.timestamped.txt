[17:51] [Music]
[18:15] [Music]
[18:47] I think say like David already got the

[20:38] thank God for the blood amen
[20:41] [Music]
[20:48] ah love him because he loved me and
[21:11] [Music]
[21:14] cheese my
[21:21] ah
[21:23] [Music]
[21:32] [Music]
[21:36] ah
[21:45] because he first loved me
[21:53] [Music]
[22:01] [Music]
[22:04] Oh
[22:09] we
[22:12] ah
[22:17] [Music]
[22:20] ah
[22:23] [Music]
[22:39] and my
[22:46] yeah
[22:48] Oh glory to God as we stand we didn't
[23:12] come here to see each other neither did
[23:16] we come here to judge one another we
[23:19] came Amen to worship God often time we
[23:23] come to church and we look around and we
[23:25] see things that we may not like but the
[23:29] truth of the matter is it's not about
[23:31] you looking around it's about Christ
[23:34] because if we all would stand in the
[23:37] presence of God we all would be guilty
[23:40] without the grace of God without the
[23:45] blood of Jesus Christ where would we be
[23:47] and I don't know about you but I know
[23:52] every day is Resurrection day especially
[23:56] for me because I get up and when I get
[24:01] up in the morning that's my resurrection
[24:04] in this life but there is coming another
[24:09] resurrection by dying at night and
[24:14] waking up in the morning it's just a
[24:15] shadow and type of that great day that
[24:18] we're getting ready to experience
[24:21] we appreciate the Lord Jesus and I'm
[24:25] gonna ask you to turn with me to
[24:27] revelations the third chapter I say
[24:33] these things because I'm so glad that my
[24:36] salvation is not hindered upon people
[24:39] who whether they like me or not
[24:42] but one thing I do know is that God
[24:45] requires us to love everybody even on
[24:49] enemies and that is not just something
[24:53] that you say with your mouth it is a
[24:56] true expression I was telling somebody
[24:59] just yesterday
[25:02] I said even the dog knows when you fake
[25:08] they have enough discernment to know
[25:10] when somebody likes them or not
[25:13] so does cats so we being in the image
[25:19] and likeness of God we know as we turn
[25:24] to revelations to the third chapter
[25:27] these two scriptures may seeing as far
[25:31] from each other as the left and the
[25:33] right but by God's grace I trust he give
[25:36] us the grace to minister the thought of
[25:39] God this morning revelations the third
[25:42] chapter beginning at the 18th verse many
[25:46] of us are aware of this particular
[25:48] scripture I counseled thee to buy of me
[25:55] gold tried in the fire that thou may it
[26:00] be rich and white raiment that thou may
[26:04] it be clothed and that the shame of that
[26:07] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[26:10] eyes with eyesalve that thou may it see
[26:16] as many as i love i rebuke let's go back
[26:24] up to the 17th verses where i really
[26:28] wanted to read forgive me because
[26:31] they'll say it i am rich and increased
[26:35] with Goods and have need of nothing and
[26:39] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[26:42] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[26:49] now jump to the 19th verse as many as i
[26:53] love i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[26:56] therefore and repent john the first
[27:03] chapter st. john the first chapter
[27:13] I think we may have it just a little bit
[27:18] too chilly in here please when you when
[27:24] you're too cold you can't worship like
[27:26] it would normally would worship when the
[27:28] temperature is just right John 1
[27:31] beginning at the first verse in the
[27:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[27:39] with God and the Word was God the same
[27:43] was in the beginning with God all things
[27:46] were made by him and without him was not
[27:50] anything made that was made in him was
[27:54] life and the life was the light of men
[27:59] and the light shine it in darkness and
[28:03] the darkness comprehended it not
[28:09] heavenly father we come before you lord
[28:13] jesus as humbly as we know how we come
[28:19] to celebrate that great day in history
[28:24] where the resurrection of our Lord
[28:28] changed time changed calendars and
[28:33] changed many hearts we pray Lord God
[28:39] that you would bless this morning in a
[28:40] special way give us grace to minister
[28:44] your thoughts in Jesus Christ's name we
[28:46] pray amen
[28:48] you may be seated
[28:56] it has so many things running through my
[28:59] mind in the time of working on this
[29:06] message I have been probably have too
[29:08] many notes and I try my best not to use
[29:10] them all because we might be here to the
[29:13] next service but by God's grace I
[29:17] I thought about Easter and I thought
[29:20] about the resurrection and I thought
[29:21] about what it was all about and you and
[29:26] I you and I know that by God's grace
[29:28] that Easter was to hell memorial the
[29:36] world called it Easter we call it the
[29:38] resurrection sunday is our day of
[29:43] worship before Sunday Saturday was the
[29:48] Jewish day of rest call it the Sabbath
[29:53] now we know that the true Sabbath is the
[29:56] Holy Spirit in your soul that's where we
[30:03] come to a place of rest even Paul say
[30:07] labor to enter into his rest
[30:11] so entering into the rest of God doesn't
[30:15] come so easy ly as some people think to
[30:21] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[30:23] personal Savior it's just the beginning
[30:25] of your journey as as a baby being born
[30:29] must grow and mature my thought on this
[30:35] morning would just be sent around one
[30:38] word origin where did we originate from
[30:47] how did we get here
[30:49] and where are we going because we
[30:53] realized that everything has a beginning
[30:55] and an ending except God God is Elohim
[31:00] he is the self existing one often time
[31:05] people in this world don't
[31:07] nowhere to go because they don't know
[31:09] where they came from
[31:11] science has manipulated and control the
[31:16] minds of the people for hundreds of
[31:19] years now maybe longer some of us or
[31:23] some people believe that we originated
[31:26] from some pali water tadpole some NGO
[31:32] bought back as far as a rock well in one
[31:37] way there right but the rock is not a
[31:40] natural rock is a spiritual rock you and
[31:45] i are living in the worst age ever and
[31:48] this age is actually called satan's eden
[31:53] but my god and your God is a God of
[31:56] contrasts the only way that God could
[31:59] show that he's light he had to allow
[32:01] darkness to come the only way that God
[32:07] could show that he was successful and
[32:09] that he's mighty he had to bring failure
[32:13] it's God's teaching rule if I would say
[32:16] this world is but you and I must
[32:21] understand that we who have eternal life
[32:27] always did have it because eternal life
[32:33] is something that has no beginning and
[32:37] in order to have eternal life you have
[32:40] had to be in the mind of God before
[32:45] creation and how day we are living in a
[32:51] time of ancestry everybody want to know
[32:56] where they started and the simple answer
[33:01] is in the book of Genesis oh we can take
[33:07] you all the way back to Adam and Eve
[33:09] they men where God created man and
[33:13] before the old before Adam and Eve was
[33:18] created we can take you back
[33:21] what we call the logos and the Bible
[33:24] said in the beginning was the word and
[33:26] the Word was with God and the Word was
[33:27] God
[33:29] the same was in the beginning III all
[33:33] that one statement the same was in the
[33:35] beginning that same was in the beginning
[33:40] not just working with Christ but working
[33:43] with you with working with me the same
[33:46] it has to be the same and the thought
[33:51] Bible tells us that all things were made
[33:52] by him and without him was not anything
[33:58] made that was made this thing is a great
[34:05] mystery and I'm coming to something in
[34:08] just a bit I believe Jarret said or
[34:19] something this morning in my office I
[34:20] don't even know whether he realized what
[34:22] he was saying to me but it's like God is
[34:25] a come he's come a come back he's coming
[34:30] back he's bringing himself back into the
[34:34] place where he first thought of himself
[34:39] what he thought about himself one thing
[34:44] I know about him is that in his
[34:48] existence he thought about you and me
[34:55] but he had to read he had to bring a
[34:58] plan on the scene and you and I we
[35:01] celebrate Easter we celebrate the
[35:03] restoration resurrection of Jesus Christ
[35:05] and we have no idea sometimes what is
[35:08] all about all we see sometime as a man
[35:13] on the cross and crying out Father
[35:15] forgive them for they know not that what
[35:17] they do but that was it was greater than
[35:20] what the eyes could behold at that time
[35:25] this plan that God had for Christ was
[35:31] planned before the
[35:34] foundation of the world and this plan of
[35:40] redemption was no mistake God saw the
[35:45] fall of man you know when Adam and Eve
[35:48] fell God didn't say oh my what happened
[35:52] no but Lucifer amen was designed to be
[35:56] the enemy of the of God God knew he
[35:59] would be you know must understand that
[36:07] we have been forced to live in this
[36:11] civilization of what they call
[36:13] civilization and America is supposed to
[36:18] be a supreme I guess on the top of the
[36:20] line civilization what a joke because in
[36:29] this civilization this one that we're
[36:31] living in is just an illusion
[36:36] it looks real but it's not real
[36:41] everything is fake we're living in an
[36:46] age of fake news fake people fake
[36:50] Christians fake something that that
[36:55] looks real when it's not only because
[37:00] people don't know where they come from
[37:04] but when you can understand where you
[37:06] come from
[37:07] you can understand where you're going we
[37:14] realize a man that we're living amen in
[37:16] a time when when the church world and
[37:19] I'm jumping here for a moment just to
[37:20] get where I need to go we're living in a
[37:22] church world where the Bible says are
[37:24] calling the revelations they increase
[37:27] with good look at the massive buildings
[37:30] look at the massive people look at the
[37:33] clothing design of this and all that
[37:38] it's an appearance of being godly but
[37:45] it's fake
[37:47] because after Sunday they transform back
[37:49] into what they really are but the
[37:55] original life is eternal
[38:00] the original night cannot change it
[38:04] remains the same no matter what
[38:08] conditions may change the original life
[38:11] the original life
[38:12] the original life remains the same for
[38:20] an example the Robin that God created
[38:25] from the beginning he's still the Robin
[38:30] he still for thousands of years builds
[38:35] his house the same way he built it he
[38:40] hasn't modernized it he's not he doesn't
[38:44] have a split-level or a mansion still
[38:49] simple because he's not the fallen
[38:53] creature but there's something about man
[38:58] even in his fallen states he projects
[39:02] the image of his creator because he is
[39:09] but he's searching steel you know I
[39:12] looked and they had this Android and
[39:16] this Endor was a girl and they were
[39:18] talking with her and you know and they
[39:19] were saying you know scientists has made
[39:21] this Android look so real and so human
[39:25] it's amazing how they deny God but they
[39:28] want them be a creator like he is
[39:32] science a menace has come to a place
[39:34] where they're so close but they'll never
[39:41] be able to put their hands on life
[39:44] because life doesn't come by science
[39:47] life doesn't come by education you could
[39:50] be the dumbest man in the world and be
[39:52] the smartest man in the world
[39:54] because you choose Christ now I
[39:59] to say this by God's grace amen this
[40:02] this thing that when I'm working with
[40:04] the origin you and I have fallen with
[40:08] fallen creatures from where we come from
[40:12] and because of sin amen
[40:15] it barricaded the way back home even
[40:20] though men heard the call of God they
[40:23] could never return home did y'all know
[40:25] that thousands of years men would die
[40:29] and they will be locked up in the prison
[40:31] called paradise and paradise was nice
[40:35] but paradise wasn't home y'all know what
[40:38] I'm saying it's like going to a hotel on
[40:41] a vacation you enjoyed it but that hotel
[40:44] is not home and you and I know there's
[40:47] no place like home yet God put something
[40:51] in us to thirst for him something amen
[40:57] amen that animals don't have but one
[41:03] thing about it goddess is is it's
[41:05] beautiful in its in its ways I always
[41:10] tell somebody I said one thing about
[41:11] those little animals there in India and
[41:13] y'all have heard the story when an
[41:15] earthquake was getting ready to come
[41:16] they moved away from the walls but
[41:20] because of our intelligence we like Oh
[41:22] get me a telescope and let me see what's
[41:25] going on out here and it usually causes
[41:31] our death we call that curiosity and
[41:34] foolishness but you and I must realize
[41:39] amen that in this origin something is
[41:42] taking place right now and you and I
[41:48] must understand they meant that this
[41:50] life that Jesus I'm jumping all over the
[41:53] place but nevertheless I want you to
[41:54] understand that if there's an origin
[41:57] there's a return there's a return
[42:00] because eternal life is a circle oh it's
[42:05] like this it has no beginning nor ending
[42:08] it never stops and because we are part
[42:12] of
[42:12] eternal we have a journey and this
[42:15] journey
[42:16] Amen drop this down for a while in what
[42:19] we call time but when we die we get back
[42:24] into the loop we get arrived back in the
[42:28] place we fell from this is what calorie
[42:31] was all about Calvary was the
[42:34] restoration it came to restore he meant
[42:40] the Fallen creation of God it wasn't to
[42:49] put on a show or anything that people's
[42:51] hello you know it was it was it was the
[42:55] greatest and yet the saddest thing I
[42:57] ever God don't need your pity God needs
[43:02] repentance because amen it was because
[43:07] of our sins Jesus had to die yeah it was
[43:14] God's plan he was a lamb before the
[43:17] foundation of the world we're living in
[43:21] an intellectual age where people think
[43:23] they're so smart that they can outsmart
[43:26] God hallelujah
[43:29] they dabbling all into science thinking
[43:32] that they can you know jump through a
[43:34] wormhole into eternal life they're
[43:39] looking for a new world because they
[43:41] know this one is coming it's falling
[43:43] apart but yet there's another people
[43:47] that's looking for a new world but then
[43:50] it does world is really not new it's
[43:52] just we haven't been there in a long
[43:55] time we are living in a day of scoffers
[44:01] we're living in the day of non-believers
[44:03] we're living in the days of with the
[44:06] ballot bra but where the Word of God
[44:08] says amen we're living in a day of
[44:10] knowing we're living in the day of Sodom
[44:12] we're living in the day of intellectual
[44:14] Giants man's achievements in
[44:17] personalities or impersonation scuse me
[44:21] and you and I must understand that if
[44:23] we're not careful
[44:26] we can become ourselves an impersonation
[44:31] of Christianity hello because the person
[44:37] in Christianity is not a religion it's
[44:41] not a cult it's not a large it's not a
[44:45] group of people and then branded Baptist
[44:48] Methodist Presbyterian message that's
[44:50] not Christianity Christianity is when
[44:54] you have been born again when Christ is
[44:58] living only inside of you
[45:00] that's what Christianity is Christianity
[45:06] is not having the ability to see a
[45:08] prophet and to know what a property is
[45:10] that's not Christianity Christianity is
[45:16] when you have met Jesus Christ for
[45:18] yourself as somebody help me here until
[45:25] a man meets Jesus Christ he is insane
[45:33] because a man insanity is described as
[45:37] doing the same thing over and over and
[45:41] over again and expecting a different
[45:43] result
[45:45] i'ma go around in this circle and one of
[45:48] these old days amen ah I'll be set free
[45:51] not as long as you go in that circle
[45:57] when you and I when we understand Amen
[46:01] that our minds our thinking our thoughts
[46:04] that have been put on us because we are
[46:07] fallen individuals hmm I'm trying to
[46:12] hurry but it's not working you and I
[46:16] must understand that we are living in an
[46:18] age of perversion y'all heard me
[46:21] you know so many people they get quiet
[46:24] when you start using the word perversion
[46:26] because some people don't think they are
[46:27] but they are every last one of us that
[46:30] were born into this world were born
[46:31] perverted because we were not born
[46:34] according to the original plan of God
[46:37] somebody help me
[46:39] you know was to be born a meant by the
[46:42] spoken word hallelujah but we came by
[46:46] way of a woman is that right David
[46:49] described he said in sin did my mother
[46:52] conceive me and I was shapen in iniquity
[46:55] that means when I knew to do good I was
[46:58] going to do wrong anyway that's the kind
[47:01] of a person you and I came oh look at
[47:04] that cute angel that little baby cutie
[47:06] cutie and that little baby Amen is
[47:08] working you cry when it ain't hungry
[47:14] right cries when it's not wet sometime
[47:19] and just want you to hold it hallelujah
[47:24] oh you must understand that baby knows
[47:27] how to lie without you teaching it but
[47:33] because it was born with the fallen
[47:35] nature you don't have to teach it these
[47:38] evil things it is what it is hallelujah
[47:44] and as it was born to lie there is
[47:49] another flip there's another side of the
[47:52] court
[47:53] there must be a people that is born not
[47:55] to lie Oh somebody help me here the only
[48:06] thing that's true and faithful in this
[48:07] age is the word hmm it is the only thing
[48:12] that will not fail you the Bible said
[48:15] the grass withers and the flowers fade
[48:16] away but the word of the Lord shall
[48:18] stand I know this is the long I'm trying
[48:21] to get there in all of this God let a
[48:27] word to his disciples let not your heart
[48:31] be troubled
[48:33] you see God want to bring peace to the
[48:36] heart he wants to bring confidence to
[48:40] you and me you and I so that we can
[48:44] understand he meant that what he did on
[48:48] Calvary is enough
[48:52] it's not the grace of God plus it's not
[48:56] the blood of Jesus plus hallelujah
[49:00] no man can add a cubit to a statue
[49:05] hallelujah but in order to go back to
[49:10] where you come from you must have a
[49:12] revelation and jesus said upon this rock
[49:17] I'll build my church and the gates of
[49:19] Hell shall not prevail you're never and
[49:24] I'm gonna be preaching a little bit on
[49:25] the rapture this morning you'll never
[49:27] understand the rapture or even believe
[49:29] that you are are you worthy to take a
[49:31] rapture if you don't know where you come
[49:33] from you understand me when you
[49:40] understand amen where you come from then
[49:43] you understand there's a ship there's
[49:44] something waiting on me to take me back
[49:47] to where I came from there is not one
[49:50] Christian that can truly be satisfied
[49:53] living here no matter how wealthy God
[49:58] makes you or how prosperous and how much
[50:01] you achieve in a true Christian he's
[50:04] longing for heaven he's longing to
[50:08] return to that kind of a being that he
[50:11] failed from his role when I get to
[50:15] heaven I'm oh tall I'm gonna tell Eve
[50:17] well I had why she did better they don't
[50:19] need no more you can't blame e it's you
[50:25] now you have to make the choice is that
[50:30] right please Adam and Eve didn't have an
[50:34] example before them but you and I we
[50:38] have an example of what disobedience can
[50:41] make calls on you but it can that the
[50:47] tragedies of being disobedient the
[50:51] horror that comes with disobedience as I
[50:55] said in an earlier message you had two
[50:57] trees in that garden and in that garden
[51:00] you had the Tree of Life there's only
[51:02] one Tree of Life and then you had
[51:04] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[51:05] evil that was an impersonator of life
[51:10] hello
[51:12] that tree was an impersonator of life
[51:14] because he said oh you shall not surely
[51:16] die if you eat up this tree you're gonna
[51:20] live but God said if you eat of this
[51:22] tree you should die see them say you
[51:26] have a choice on whether you will take
[51:29] the tree of life over the tree of
[51:32] knowledge of good and evil I'm coming
[51:36] because I'm working with this origin
[51:37] here did you know that when God gives
[51:41] you the Holy Ghost he gives you his
[51:44] person that's God in you so the person
[51:49] said well I got the Holy Ghost and
[51:50] you're not living holy something's wrong
[51:56] we're gonna have battles because of this
[51:59] but the inward man knows right from
[52:05] wrong you know what people don't
[52:09] understand they say well let me ask you
[52:11] a question when Jesus was praying and he
[52:15] said father I was at this cup pass from
[52:18] me who he was he was praying to his
[52:21] father that's what he said
[52:24] who else could he have prayed to it was
[52:27] his father who was ill him who was the
[52:31] Holy Spirit Jesus Christ was the son of
[52:34] God by the natural man but in him dwelt
[52:38] the father
[52:40] hello him yah hear me the Bible said he
[52:44] had the fullness of Godhead bodily in
[52:46] him so when he prayed guess what the
[52:52] Bible said when you and I don't know how
[52:54] to pray the Holy Spirit will make
[52:57] intercessions for you who is the Holy
[53:00] Spirit he is the father hello so not
[53:05] only does the Holy Spirit comes down and
[53:07] he prays through you but he answers his
[53:11] prayers
[53:12] Oh somebody help me hallelujah
[53:16] so you must understand that if the Holy
[53:18] if you are praying in the spirit that's
[53:21] God praying that right Redemption by
[53:26] judgment he said he don't only make
[53:28] prayers but he answers prayers he is the
[53:31] one who answers his own prayer so if you
[53:36] prayed in the Holy Spirit why do you
[53:39] doubt that God will answer your prayer
[53:44] God prays it through you so that he
[53:47] can't answer it because he's the only
[53:49] one that can pray perfectly is that
[53:54] right I got it
[53:56] you've got it and because of Calvary we
[54:00] all have it listen Jesus didn't come
[54:04] just to save of the world about said he
[54:07] came into the world to save the world
[54:08] but he know he knew that all the world
[54:11] would not be saved he knew people would
[54:15] not accept Christianity and in this in
[54:18] this age America is almost complete
[54:21] apostasy he said neither pray I for
[54:26] these alone but for them also which
[54:28] shall believe on me through their word
[54:30] that they may all be one now if he
[54:35] prayed that how can i how can anything
[54:38] stop it
[54:41] when he pray they all I was a part of
[54:45] the thing and all may be one as thou
[54:49] father art in me I envy that they may
[54:52] also be one in us that the world may
[54:55] believe that thou has sent me and the
[55:00] glory which thou gave with me I have
[55:02] given them that they be one even as we
[55:06] are one
[55:07] hmm so that knocks out the scientific
[55:10] way thought on oneness when the Baptist
[55:14] the method is a Presbyterian the
[55:16] Catholic the message and whoever they
[55:18] all think oh we could be one because he
[55:20] prayed that we be one now that's not the
[55:23] one that God was talking about the Bible
[55:26] said
[55:26] by one spirit are we baptized into one
[55:28] body that's the oneness of God help me
[55:33] somebody
[55:33] it is given to you and I and I'm gonna
[55:36] go ahead and preach down it is given to
[55:38] you and I to know the mysteries hello
[55:44] mysteries that are unveiled to you is
[55:47] given to you by God by grace not because
[55:51] you are knit but because God chose to
[55:54] give it to you you can't buy it
[55:57] you came flat Oh God is that Alright you
[56:00] can fast fifty days if it was possible
[56:04] it says Lord I won't I'm fasting that
[56:08] that that I'll sing I'll be able to sing
[56:10] you know and I have a have a voice that
[56:12] I could really shake the world
[56:14] everything God's will you Engel fasting
[56:17] today's and all it is you die more than
[56:18] likely because if it's not the will of
[56:21] God to have you seen you will not
[56:26] because the gifts of God and the gifts
[56:29] and calling of God is well thought
[56:31] without repentance God called you before
[56:33] you ever thought about repenting ah
[56:36] because you and I was in the mind of God
[56:39] Oh help me Jesus I'm trying to get to
[56:44] something here so you and I must
[56:46] understand that when when Adam and he's
[56:49] sin I'm jumping and the Adam could not
[56:53] say Eve and Eve could not save Adam it
[56:57] took God to do it think about it the
[57:01] very tree they refused to eat of had to
[57:05] come to their rescue and that's how it
[57:08] is Jesus must come to our rescue the one
[57:13] who saved the world the one who died for
[57:15] us
[57:16] amen came to save us hallelujah
[57:20] in spite of our rebellion in that while
[57:25] we were yet sinners Christ died for us
[57:34] Satan had is trapped because death kept
[57:38] us in the grave nobody at that time
[57:43] wanted to go to the grave nobody knew
[57:47] what it was all about Jove even wrote
[57:51] and says I've seen it I've seen flowers
[57:54] come back I've seen trees come back I've
[57:56] seen everything come back but man where
[57:58] is he what is this thing about man lord
[58:02] I don't understand this thing and y'all
[58:04] know the word but the word came amen and
[58:08] it did what it showed Joe there was a
[58:12] day coming because of a day before Joe
[58:18] where were you when the sons of God
[58:21] shouted for joy when the sons of God
[58:26] even saw the lamb slain when the sons of
[58:29] God saw the lamp take the book where
[58:32] were you why because this same lamb that
[58:38] we're now talking about Jesus Christ the
[58:40] one who died and rose again he was a
[58:43] Lamb of God John said he was the Lamb of
[58:46] God but you got to understand this lamp
[58:49] this was no mistake this was no no
[58:52] coincident God planned it this way
[58:55] before the foundation of the world you
[58:58] can't appreciate love until you realize
[59:01] how bad you are you understand me
[59:05] Adam consent and Eve I love you hello
[59:08] honey I love you you're the apple of my
[59:10] eye
[59:11] but when II committed adultery which he
[59:15] failed to the serpent now was his love
[59:18] proving see God is love but it was the
[59:22] fog it was the fall of man God used it
[59:28] to show how you and me how much he loved
[59:31] us oh it's the truth
[59:34] Israel he loved God he he and God loves
[59:38] Israel but when Israel back slid on God
[59:41] when Israel stopped serving God you know
[59:44] what God said
[59:45] I'll never forget you I have read you on
[59:49] the palms of my hand you're mine and you
[59:51] will ever be mine is that right
[59:54] hallelujah and though we may be
[59:56] scattered everywhere Gentiles Jude we're
[59:59] everywhere in the book of Malachi the
[1:00:02] Word of God came says I will make my
[1:00:04] jewels up
[1:00:06] you see I'm saying if God made you a
[1:00:09] ruby if God made you a diamond if God
[1:00:12] made your sapphire
[1:00:13] whatever you are you might be covered
[1:00:18] with dirt but you steal the jewels of
[1:00:21] God it is okay even Paul seeing the
[1:00:27] conditions of man you know we're living
[1:00:29] in the worst days you don't as I said
[1:00:32] earlier this age is considered Satan's
[1:00:34] Eden for men who may not understand
[1:00:37] Satan even is the age in which Satan has
[1:00:40] become God is that right
[1:00:43] look on your TV sets a man is everywhere
[1:00:46] where death is being glorified monsters
[1:00:50] zombies whatever a man is being
[1:00:52] glorified and you've never seen anything
[1:00:54] really about Jesus anymore and then when
[1:00:57] you do look at something that has Jesus
[1:00:59] on it it's just an imitation it's just a
[1:01:03] fake hello it's the truth ha real
[1:01:09] original life is hard to find the
[1:01:13] original seed of God is hard to find but
[1:01:17] there there we have a hope that's beyond
[1:01:23] the grave and we have live set six
[1:01:27] thousands of years amen we have seen men
[1:01:29] rise and fall men rise and fall kingdoms
[1:01:32] rise and fall and I don't know why
[1:01:34] people think that America is going to be
[1:01:36] great again we're already fallen hello
[1:01:43] we were the last nation everybody else
[1:01:46] has fallen England fell is that right
[1:01:51] Russia fell where did they fall when God
[1:01:55] brought the revival to them and they
[1:01:57] rejected it where did America
[1:02:00] when God brought the revival to her and
[1:02:02] she rejected it that right in the 50s
[1:02:06] and then when God was pouring out his
[1:02:08] spirit eyes of the blind being open dead
[1:02:10] raised amen
[1:02:12] people in wheelchairs at you know being
[1:02:15] healed God even went to the White House
[1:02:19] and healed a senator
[1:02:21] put it right in their face and Senator
[1:02:25] Upshaw had been what in a wheelchair for
[1:02:28] about 60 years God healed him it's the
[1:02:32] White House and around and around that
[1:02:34] gift but they didn't America should have
[1:02:38] rallied around the noting of God if they
[1:02:41] had we would have been a millennium by
[1:02:43] now but we chose our rock and roll we
[1:02:47] chose our parties we chose everything
[1:02:50] that was against the original nature of
[1:02:53] God woo and we're going to pay for it
[1:02:57] people think it's just all America I'm
[1:02:59] telling you folks you better wake up and
[1:03:01] smell the coffee it's not just America
[1:03:04] that's wicked it's the whole world but
[1:03:08] we haven't hope it's been written all
[1:03:14] along in the book when things get bad
[1:03:18] God knows how to make a way of escape is
[1:03:20] that right the Bible said with all of
[1:03:23] the temptation God has already made a
[1:03:26] way of escape is that right
[1:03:31] oh come on somebody you look at this
[1:03:34] thing and you said well brothers what
[1:03:35] are you saying Paul wrote about he said
[1:03:38] but brother I would not you be ignorant
[1:03:40] brethren concerning them that asleep we
[1:03:43] die because of sin we go to sleep
[1:03:45] brother but before then you know all of
[1:03:49] those who die in Christ they just go to
[1:03:51] sleep for long rest those of those who
[1:03:54] are tired and want to rest one of those
[1:03:55] days you're gonna arrest me well if the
[1:03:57] Lord tarry but you and I must realize
[1:04:01] because of this message because of our
[1:04:02] understanding of Malachi 4 God sent us a
[1:04:06] word of comfort to know that those of us
[1:04:10] who die we die unto the
[1:04:12] and when we leave this place there's
[1:04:15] another place
[1:04:16] Paul said Amen in the Word of God he
[1:04:19] said if this earthly Tabernacle be
[1:04:22] dissolved I have one waiting for me
[1:04:25] hoping I'd die like Joel said though the
[1:04:28] skinned ones eat up my flesh yet in my
[1:04:31] flesh I will see God because on that day
[1:04:34] this coming a day like I read a
[1:04:37] scripture says yeah Friday is here but
[1:04:40] sunday is coming hallelujah and you and
[1:04:45] I must realize it meant that though we
[1:04:47] suffer in this life we gonna reign one
[1:04:51] day thank like that song say this world
[1:04:56] is not my home I'm just a passing
[1:04:59] through hallelujah for if we believe
[1:05:03] that Jesus Christ died and rose again
[1:05:05] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:05:09] will God bring with him oh but they're
[1:05:13] dead no sir they're just in another
[1:05:16] dimension hallelujah
[1:05:18] they're living better now than they were
[1:05:21] here huh because they have a different
[1:05:25] body hallelujah come on somebody now the
[1:05:30] Bible says and tells us a man that there
[1:05:33] are those who escaped death did you know
[1:05:34] that I mean the first man that we know a
[1:05:38] record that escaped death was anak
[1:05:41] that's what Christ came for that's why
[1:05:44] Jesus came that he might undo death he
[1:05:48] would conquer death he would take away
[1:05:50] the effects of death
[1:05:51] I hope my English ain't too bad for you
[1:05:55] this morning but I get excited I'm sorry
[1:06:00] and you and I must realize hey man that
[1:06:03] the effects of death strikes everybody
[1:06:07] that's born in this dimension
[1:06:10] did you know that oh I keep saying Lord
[1:06:14] restore me so I can jog some more but
[1:06:18] you see when you get older your joints
[1:06:20] don't work as good as they used to
[1:06:22] Oh y'all young people y'all don't even
[1:06:24] know what I'm talking about y'all
[1:06:26] can jump up and get down and I have to
[1:06:28] creep up sometime but then I think the
[1:06:30] Lord I made it it's a different thing
[1:06:33] because on the inside of you you still
[1:06:36] young you still vibrant you feel the
[1:06:39] same way you always felt on the inside
[1:06:41] but this Tabernacle here because of CN
[1:06:44] is drying up the grass wither and the
[1:06:47] flowers fade away hallelujah
[1:06:50] is that right but Paul said I have a
[1:06:53] hope you're gonna sleep you're gonna die
[1:06:55] at the Lord tarry you goin to the grave
[1:06:57] hallelujah but you're not there when you
[1:07:01] die you go with him a lot of people
[1:07:04] don't want to believe life after death
[1:07:06] but I know it's true there was a time I
[1:07:09] was really really sick in my marriage
[1:07:11] when we were young and you know and I I
[1:07:13] something happened and I had an
[1:07:15] out-of-body experience you don't have to
[1:07:16] believe it but I did and I was able to
[1:07:19] look and I was able to see through where
[1:07:21] my wife was I saw her come in the room
[1:07:22] and everything else and she didn't know
[1:07:24] what was going on but my spirit or
[1:07:27] whatever was above looking and I was
[1:07:30] look out what brought me back down but
[1:07:32] it did nevertheless I have experienced
[1:07:37] it myself I didn't go to heaven I was
[1:07:39] just there you get sick enough
[1:07:44] something's gonna happen but
[1:07:48] nevertheless let's move on I know it's
[1:07:49] real even if if I had never had the
[1:07:51] experience I know it's real we're living
[1:07:56] in a time what we call the end time
[1:07:58] y'all know that the Bible said as it was
[1:08:00] in the days of Noah as it was in the
[1:08:02] days of Sodom on Sodom that's when the
[1:08:04] son of man shall come right and the son
[1:08:06] of man is a prophet with a word so you
[1:08:09] and I must understand we're living in
[1:08:10] that day because the message has come
[1:08:13] right and Paul said the Lord himself
[1:08:17] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:08:19] with the voice of an archangel and with
[1:08:22] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:08:24] shall rise first hallelujah
[1:08:28] and we know when God opened up those
[1:08:30] seals amen all three were done in that
[1:08:33] time it is a progression now
[1:08:40] for revelation 10-7 came with a message
[1:08:43] and that message
[1:08:44] a man was behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:08:48] hey that's why we know that the rapture
[1:08:52] is soon here Wow
[1:08:53] because it's already in making people
[1:08:56] that oh I'll be change in the moment of
[1:08:59] a twinkle of an eye but let me say it
[1:09:01] like this the change must be all now you
[1:09:04] must be changing like like the Word of
[1:09:07] God says from glory to glory to glory
[1:09:15] hallelujah it is okay let me just move
[1:09:21] on because I my time is going out but
[1:09:25] let's just go there was a man called
[1:09:27] Lazarus is that right and Lazarus was a
[1:09:32] friend of Jesus I read this little book
[1:09:36] they claim it's a little got history in
[1:09:39] it it was called the Prince of the house
[1:09:41] of David and it talks about the death of
[1:09:44] Lazarus and they said that Lazarus when
[1:09:48] he was so dead the stench was unbearable
[1:09:50] and said that when they marry him roll
[1:09:55] the stone away the stench feel the air
[1:09:57] so much so to some passed out God did it
[1:10:02] if that was so he wanted all of the
[1:10:05] spectators to know Lazarus is not only
[1:10:08] dead but he was rotting and so we
[1:10:12] realized by God's grace that here was
[1:10:14] Jesus and everybody saying oh oh kidding
[1:10:17] this thing be I know this man opened the
[1:10:19] eyes of the bride I know he he healed
[1:10:21] the sick I know he did a lot of things
[1:10:23] but this man has been dead for days see
[1:10:27] Jesus didn't do that to play he wasn't
[1:10:30] there y'all people come see what I can
[1:10:32] do it wasn't him doing it hallelujah it
[1:10:36] was God in him y'all believe that
[1:10:40] because when his sister's my lambs and
[1:10:42] sisters came to their Lord
[1:10:44] know that Lazarus is sick come quickly
[1:10:45] he couldn't move on the moon news came
[1:10:49] back to him again Lord don't you know
[1:10:51] lavell is getting worse
[1:10:52] like he's gonna die Jesus couldn't move
[1:10:56] because he was a man but he was a God
[1:10:59] man and he was the son of man not a but
[1:11:04] V somebody help me here but he had to
[1:11:09] wait on the anointing he had to wait on
[1:11:12] the spirit he said except my father and
[1:11:15] my father don't show me I don't do
[1:11:16] nothing I'm not doing nothing I'm not
[1:11:18] moving I can do nothing except the
[1:11:21] father show me is that right
[1:11:24] but then after laughs that had been dead
[1:11:26] for days then God says now it's your
[1:11:28] time hallelujah
[1:11:32] now that was pre crucifixion before
[1:11:37] Calvary hallelujah and here was Jesus
[1:11:43] and then he told he goes right to the to
[1:11:45] Mary Martha takes him right to the to
[1:11:48] the two he tells him you go roll away
[1:11:50] the stone that's what God is telling you
[1:11:53] this morning you roll the way to stone
[1:11:56] because you and your heart and your mind
[1:11:59] is thinking it's impossible but I want
[1:12:02] you to know Mary Martha I am the
[1:12:04] resurrection I am the life hallelujah
[1:12:08] if there is going to be anything that's
[1:12:10] going to happen it's coming by me that's
[1:12:13] why it's so important to have Jesus on
[1:12:16] the scene
[1:12:17] you can't do nothing it ain't your
[1:12:20] prayers that answer that that that that
[1:12:22] data make things happen
[1:12:25] it's a God in you praying hallelujah and
[1:12:31] what happens I still today don't know
[1:12:34] how Barry and Martha rolled away that
[1:12:37] stone that was a huge stone I've been to
[1:12:42] Israel it was a huge stone heavy stone
[1:12:45] it took more than one Centurion to roll
[1:12:48] it but somehow they managed it and the
[1:12:53] Bible don't say how they did it but they
[1:12:54] were all the way here let me tell you
[1:12:56] something faith sometimes come easy and
[1:12:58] sometimes faith you got to push
[1:13:00] something out of the way and I think
[1:13:02] that's what we call unbelief lord help
[1:13:05] my unbelief
[1:13:06] yo let me tell y'all something most of
[1:13:09] us believe that God can heal most of us
[1:13:12] believe that God Amen could open the
[1:13:14] eyes of the blind some of us will even
[1:13:16] believe that God can raise the dead but
[1:13:20] you know what we're having unbelief in
[1:13:24] transformation that God can really
[1:13:29] change me into that we're having a hard
[1:13:34] time believing that the same Holy Spirit
[1:13:36] that created you that ordained you one
[1:13:40] out of a million to be born in this
[1:13:42] earthly dimension can change your
[1:13:46] character into his that's our problem
[1:13:50] because we have been Amen the way we've
[1:13:53] been for so long and God said I can give
[1:13:55] you knowledge I can give you tumors I
[1:13:57] can give you patience I can give you
[1:13:59] brotherly kindness and I can produce
[1:14:01] divine loving you but we struggle he's
[1:14:06] the same creator with all hallelujah God
[1:14:10] did this God did this but what about you
[1:14:12] what about the change in you because
[1:14:16] understand that when God called Lazarus
[1:14:19] from the dead he was dead his nose was
[1:14:21] something magan's was everywhere stitch
[1:14:24] fill the air and God transformed I don't
[1:14:28] know where the magaz went that's where
[1:14:30] they came from
[1:14:31] hallelujah all I know is when Lazarus
[1:14:35] came forth a man is shook the world of
[1:14:39] that day and he came out hopping more
[1:14:43] than likely because his feet was bound
[1:14:44] and he said loosed the man and let him
[1:14:48] go see that's the thing
[1:14:50] you are bound by religion grave clothes
[1:14:56] and you need the same voice to loose you
[1:15:00] in this message is the only thing that
[1:15:02] can loose you hallelujah then that voice
[1:15:08] was a scream you know the Bible said
[1:15:10] that his voice wouldn't even be heard in
[1:15:12] the streets but that day when Jesus went
[1:15:15] to last to me says Lazarus come forth
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:20] the prophet god said if he had said if
[1:15:22] he hadn't specified the name Amen
[1:15:25] everybody would have got up I believe it
[1:15:29] hallelujah you and I must understand I
[1:15:32] love this because it's a Shirley type of
[1:15:33] the resurrection because the next time
[1:15:35] you see Lazar he's sitting at the table
[1:15:37] eating and dining with Jesus Enoch the
[1:15:42] Bible said was translated he wasn't
[1:15:46] found he was able to walk with God and
[1:15:49] believe God so much that one day he
[1:15:51] changed from auto-tuned immortality and
[1:15:56] still today nobody don't have a record
[1:15:59] of where Enoch is I know he's at because
[1:16:04] there was a greater relative
[1:16:05] resurrection that did come see that what
[1:16:07] I'm trying to say if you could see what
[1:16:09] Calvary did rob you so oh you think
[1:16:11] Kaveri is just for your just heal oh god
[1:16:13] I thank you for healing me no oh lord I
[1:16:15] just thank you for making me feel good
[1:16:17] in god I'm so glad I got joy it's more
[1:16:19] than that it's a restoration is God
[1:16:23] taking his fallen creation and bringing
[1:16:26] it back to him hallelujah
[1:16:31] so oh oh the devil thought he steal
[1:16:34] God's jewels but God says I'm a greater
[1:16:37] thief
[1:16:37] I'll come like like a thief in the night
[1:16:40] and I'm gonna take my Jews away from you
[1:16:45] hallelujah is that right so you and I
[1:16:49] must understand that Enoch was
[1:16:50] translated nobody enthuse well I don't
[1:16:53] believe that
[1:16:53] Enoch built the pyramid you don't have
[1:16:55] to because God has revealed to us that
[1:16:57] only a supernatural element could have
[1:17:00] built that because even man can't do it
[1:17:04] today
[1:17:04] I've been to Egypt and I've seen those
[1:17:07] used stone some bigger than this longer
[1:17:10] than this room huge I kill taller than I
[1:17:13] am
[1:17:14] it'll take more than a crane it'll take
[1:17:17] more than ten thousand men with ropes
[1:17:20] and how they gonna get it up so high
[1:17:23] because they had technology that we did
[1:17:27] not and still don't have why are we
[1:17:30] trying to reach the moon they they were
[1:17:32] trying to reach heaven
[1:17:34] is that right their technology was so
[1:17:37] advanced God said let me go down and
[1:17:39] confuse him
[1:17:40] because if I don't confuse them their
[1:17:43] build their way up to heaven so they had
[1:17:46] a dimensional machine or whatever they
[1:17:48] had but God had to stop him because he
[1:17:53] knew man was intelligent he made him in
[1:17:56] His image and his likeness and when you
[1:17:58] get men on one Accord he can accomplish
[1:18:00] anything he wants to accomplish
[1:18:03] hallelujah now we had also Elijah who
[1:18:08] was translated who's raptured or take
[1:18:11] away on a fiery chariot however you want
[1:18:13] to say it but he left his heart and went
[1:18:15] to another dimension guess what he's
[1:18:19] still living 400 years later hover 800
[1:18:23] have it was here he was talking to Jesus
[1:18:26] on Mount Transfiguration oh I'm so glad
[1:18:32] that these mysteries have been unfolded
[1:18:35] to us the greatest mystery that God has
[1:18:38] given me is my origin where I came from
[1:18:42] hallelujah oh come on somebody ha come
[1:18:46] on you said what do you mean that's why
[1:18:47] Jesus could say in the word my sheep
[1:18:50] hears my voice and a stranger they will
[1:18:54] not follow huh he was their side
[1:18:57] disciples themselves here they were Amen
[1:19:00] Pharisees Sadducees whatever they were
[1:19:03] remember when Jesus they come follow me
[1:19:05] they drop everything
[1:19:07] Peter fisherman quit his job and follow
[1:19:10] Jesus y'all give him why because he was
[1:19:13] God's sheep and then Jesus comes alone
[1:19:16] after he gathers them together and he
[1:19:18] tells them I knew you and you were with
[1:19:22] me before the foundation of the world
[1:19:25] somebody help me here
[1:19:27] so you said oh brother once I listen I
[1:19:29] can't help to be but what I am just like
[1:19:32] you cannot have to be but what you are
[1:19:36] if you are son and daughter of God you
[1:19:38] also be so happy if you're thirsty for
[1:19:41] more God you ought to be so happy don't
[1:19:44] be ashamed to be a Christian be
[1:19:46] to be a Christian be glad be joyous it
[1:19:50] is the world who's in bad shape not you
[1:20:05] when we get to a place where we don't
[1:20:08] understand
[1:20:09] this is harvest y'all understand what
[1:20:12] harvest is that's when the combine comes
[1:20:16] together comes and gather up all the
[1:20:18] wheat or whatever the harvest is it
[1:20:20] bundles it or it puts it in a place
[1:20:23] where it can be used and that's what God
[1:20:25] is getting that's what God is doing
[1:20:27] right now
[1:20:27] all right a man from the message
[1:20:31] Revelation he said you will recall that
[1:20:32] I mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:20:34] message that the book this book we are
[1:20:39] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:20:41] Jesus himself in the church and his
[1:20:45] works in the future ages then I
[1:20:48] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:20:50] to give us revelation or we will fail to
[1:20:53] get it you understand me
[1:20:55] that's why the bout said he will appear
[1:20:58] to those who are looking if you're not
[1:21:02] looking for us coming you won't see it
[1:21:05] if you don't love his appearance Amen
[1:21:08] that happened in 1963 you won't go you
[1:21:12] gotta love it I know
[1:21:16] am I crazy I must bring this out I'm not
[1:21:22] even done where I want to be in this
[1:21:25] life magazine and now y'all heard my
[1:21:26] testimony y'all remember this book
[1:21:28] some of y'all to know it Life magazine
[1:21:32] maybe some of you never seen it before
[1:21:34] but in this book when God began to move
[1:21:38] in America for the last time when
[1:21:42] America had rejected God in 1956 1957
[1:21:46] she turned her back on God Christianity
[1:21:49] began to fall respect for God began to
[1:21:53] decline why because God had been
[1:21:56] rejected and so therefore he ba was
[1:21:59] written in this magazine in May 17 God
[1:22:05] did a great thing
[1:22:06] seven angels descended from heaven and
[1:22:11] this it made it made a cloud now you
[1:22:16] might not know think aha
[1:22:19] ring cloud C 1963 what was happening God
[1:22:24] was revealing the seven seals that's how
[1:22:28] far we are in time 1963 what year is it
[1:22:33] now
[1:22:35] in 1948 Israel became a nation and God
[1:22:40] said Amen that that generation will not
[1:22:44] pass until they see the coming of the
[1:22:46] Lord I'm trying to tell you how late he
[1:22:51] is because God don't deal with the Jews
[1:22:54] and the Gentiles at the same time but in
[1:22:58] this rain cloud I remember Amen as a
[1:23:00] young boy I don't know what grade I was
[1:23:02] in round 63 64
[1:23:05] I was outside playing football with some
[1:23:07] of the guys and a white man came into my
[1:23:10] in my neighborhood and and and he had
[1:23:14] this book in his hand I'd never seen the
[1:23:17] book before but I remember it was a Life
[1:23:19] magazine and he opened the book to all
[1:23:22] three of us and he says can you see
[1:23:26] Jesus he said the Lord is soon to come
[1:23:29] now this may be a little heavy for you
[1:23:32] but it's true and he showed me this
[1:23:36] cloud and he turned it and when he
[1:23:40] turned it I was able to see the face of
[1:23:42] the Lord as a boy didn't know nothing
[1:23:46] about this message didn't know nothing
[1:23:47] about God send Elijah and all that
[1:23:49] didn't know that and I began to thank
[1:23:52] God I something I don't know what I did
[1:23:54] I said but I can see it I can see it the
[1:23:56] other two guys couldn't that white man
[1:23:59] had on a white suit and a black tie I'll
[1:24:03] never forget it he closed the book when
[1:24:06] I said I could see it he told me he said
[1:24:08] the Lord is soon to come the Lord is
[1:24:11] soon to come that's what he said he
[1:24:12] didn't say nothing he didn't say rapture
[1:24:14] he said the Lord is soon to come that I
[1:24:16] could recall and he closed the book and
[1:24:18] he left like I said it's branded my mind
[1:24:23] because in a black neighborhood in that
[1:24:25] day
[1:24:25] only the milkman the insurance man or
[1:24:29] something important man who was known by
[1:24:32] the neighborhood if they were white they
[1:24:33] were the only ones allowed y'all
[1:24:40] understand me so it he didn't look like
[1:24:43] he was afraid or anything he closed the
[1:24:45] book and I didn't see this this book
[1:24:47] again until I came into the message now
[1:24:51] because of technology men have been able
[1:24:56] to do things with this picture that at
[1:25:02] that time we weren't able to see so what
[1:25:08] they did they were able to magnify and
[1:25:11] this is what you get
[1:25:15] now you say what brother look that's
[1:25:17] that's something as you you believe in
[1:25:19] that I do with all my heart what was it
[1:25:22] it was the appearing God's appearing
[1:25:26] hello to the world that the world was
[1:25:30] soon to end that his coming was imminent
[1:25:36] and it was closer then than ever before
[1:25:39] when those seven seals were loosed
[1:25:42] because no man was worthy only Christ
[1:25:45] could and the Prophet God said he didn't
[1:25:49] see it and understand himself he said
[1:25:51] but when the angel told him to turn it
[1:25:52] right he saw it can you see it now this
[1:25:57] this the Bible says a man he would have
[1:25:59] on a wig a white wig that's the white
[1:26:02] wig this is the wig of judgment and in
[1:26:07] this white wig the Bible said he will
[1:26:09] come down and he put one left on the
[1:26:11] seat and one on right foot on the earth
[1:26:14] and one on the seat and he would declare
[1:26:17] that time would be no more that means
[1:26:20] time has run out for me the world is
[1:26:24] getting ready for total destruction but
[1:26:31] God mercy and grace was still there he
[1:26:34] still sent a message said whosoever will
[1:26:37] let him come
[1:26:40] he brought us an interest into the
[1:26:43] design nature of God that we will be
[1:26:45] preaching this and let me tell you
[1:26:47] something because we preached this we
[1:26:49] are scold we'll look down upon
[1:26:52] hallelujah but the Bible said he's never
[1:26:54] left himself without a witness Enoch was
[1:26:59] one man and it had to be millions in the
[1:27:01] world but he was the only one that was
[1:27:03] raptured Noah was one of eight eight
[1:27:09] Souls and nobody wanted to him believe
[1:27:13] his message but it did stop the flood
[1:27:16] hallelujah and as you've heard me say
[1:27:19] Amen everybody and noise day became a
[1:27:22] believer as they descended into hell
[1:27:26] hello and Jesus is that right that was
[1:27:30] the first seat Enoch was translated he
[1:27:33] went up no escape the judgment of God by
[1:27:37] going over hm
[1:27:43] Moses escape the judgment of God they're
[1:27:45] coming out she's not enough to come out
[1:27:48] of Egypt you got to make preparation for
[1:27:52] heaven huh oh lord have mercy I'm I
[1:27:55] don't never knows but my point is we are
[1:27:59] going back to being what we used to be
[1:28:03] hallelujah because of sin we we left we
[1:28:07] left we didn't we came here without our
[1:28:10] theophany you know what the theophany is
[1:28:13] as a word body a body that knows
[1:28:17] everything is that right and Jesus told
[1:28:20] his disciples you know all things and I
[1:28:23] used to scratch my head I said how do
[1:28:24] they know all things because he was
[1:28:27] working with the word he worked with
[1:28:29] their origin he was working where they
[1:28:32] came from he understood them he knew
[1:28:34] them you say what do you mean even
[1:28:37] though they were on earth their
[1:28:39] theophanies were in heaven is that right
[1:28:42] Jesus the house the son of man can be
[1:28:44] standing right here talking to you and
[1:28:46] yet he's in heaven how can brother Isaac
[1:28:49] be sitting right here
[1:28:51] and God said but he's in
[1:28:52] seven how can you be sitting right here
[1:28:55] but yet in hell is that right the Bible
[1:28:57] said we are now setting in heavenly
[1:29:00] places in Christ Jesus ooh
[1:29:05] when you hear the call of God as I said
[1:29:08] that Trump came down and that Trump
[1:29:10] means what the gathering of the people
[1:29:12] that right Trump also means war and all
[1:29:16] those things but it was the feast of the
[1:29:18] trumpet was blown and when they blew
[1:29:21] those trumpets it was gathering the
[1:29:22] people to a feast the voice the shout of
[1:29:28] a trumpet amen it brings us to what the
[1:29:30] feast the changing of the body and the
[1:29:34] only way that you can get to this feast
[1:29:35] you must have a change of the body is
[1:29:38] that right well then we call it the
[1:29:41] Lord's Supper we caught in the web we
[1:29:43] actually call it the wedding supper
[1:29:46] hey everybody are you looking forward to
[1:29:48] that if you got eternal life you were in
[1:29:56] God before there ever was a world did
[1:30:00] you know that Jeremiah I knew you that's
[1:30:05] when he said to Jeremiah I called you I
[1:30:07] made you a prophet before you even form
[1:30:11] into your mother's womb I was you were
[1:30:13] there oh come on somebody
[1:30:16] he said a brother would what what do you
[1:30:18] say I asked you a question if God would
[1:30:21] have called to take a rapture this
[1:30:23] morning can you truly say you would have
[1:30:25] made it yeah we know it's going to
[1:30:31] happen around a time like this somewhere
[1:30:35] in the spring because spring is a day a
[1:30:37] season of resurrection
[1:30:39] and when we have people and then they
[1:30:42] come to a place and then they said what
[1:30:44] brothers what are you saying let me tell
[1:30:45] you something
[1:30:46] you know how Enoch got to heaven flying
[1:30:49] on the wings of grace it wasn't his
[1:30:52] works that got him there it was the
[1:30:55] mercy and grace of God but if you don't
[1:30:59] believe in the mercy the grace of God Oh
[1:31:01] Lord I'm such a sinner I don't know what
[1:31:02] I'm gonna do oh my god I didn't do right
[1:31:04] oh yes confessional sense but he's
[1:31:07] faithful and just to forgive you of your
[1:31:09] sins and to cleanse you from all your
[1:31:12] unrighteousness you never bathe in
[1:31:15] regret when that Catholics you don't
[1:31:20] have to do penton's hallelujah
[1:31:22] oh come on somebody he's the Alpha and
[1:31:25] Omega and I'm saying let me say it this
[1:31:27] way and I know I've gone a long ways you
[1:31:28] just got one service Oh your mom's going
[1:31:30] to give me a little bit more me few more
[1:31:31] minutes here's the Alpha and excuse me
[1:31:36] he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the
[1:31:40] beginning and the end he's the first and
[1:31:42] the last whatever he did yesterday is
[1:31:45] what he's doing today I know that was
[1:31:47] bad you know he must realize by God's
[1:31:52] grace that when God does something he
[1:31:54] can't change his way of doing it if
[1:31:57] there's another way of doing it it takes
[1:31:59] away from his perfection hmm let me get
[1:32:07] back to Christ I'm gonna finish it off
[1:32:09] there's no way I can preach at all but
[1:32:12] the Bible said one day the voice of God
[1:32:14] every person that's dead will hear his
[1:32:17] voice
[1:32:18] that means the sinners and the saint but
[1:32:21] there is a voice that's that only those
[1:32:23] who would take a resurrection now can
[1:32:25] hear it did you know that everybody can
[1:32:28] hear it
[1:32:29] the world can't hear it but there are
[1:32:31] designated people a special class of
[1:32:35] people that can hear the voice of the
[1:32:37] age hallelujah everybody didn't follow
[1:32:40] Luther everybody didn't follow Wesley
[1:32:42] everybody didn't go Pentecostal only
[1:32:44] those who are predestinated to do it
[1:32:47] everybody can follow Malachi 4 huh it's
[1:32:51] only those who predestinated to do it
[1:32:54] and if your producer needed to do is
[1:32:57] follow it with all of your hearts
[1:33:01] hallelujah because this whole body this
[1:33:03] whole model will put on immortality
[1:33:06] hallelujah how you know cuz I see the
[1:33:09] change come in I can see God moving me
[1:33:13] from glory to glory
[1:33:15] brother Brooks do you make mistakes yeah
[1:33:17] I do and as long as I'm in this flesh
[1:33:20] I'm gonna make mistakes huh
[1:33:21] but in this soul of mine the Bible said
[1:33:25] if you have a willing mind God to do
[1:33:28] good God counted right hallelujah in one
[1:33:33] of these old days that Capstone's Jesus
[1:33:37] is that right the Bible said he is the
[1:33:40] cornerstone but Israel rejected the
[1:33:43] cornerstone but Peter on the day of
[1:33:46] Pentecost said but God has taken that
[1:33:48] same cornerstone and made it a headstone
[1:33:51] hallelujah he is the Alpha the corner
[1:33:55] and he's the head the Omega is that
[1:33:59] right and the bow said he is faithful
[1:34:01] and true y'all look love the Lord he
[1:34:06] said but he listened there's only one
[1:34:07] God and the father of all who is above
[1:34:09] all and through all and in you are is
[1:34:12] that right but you and I must understand
[1:34:14] a man that God is doing such a great
[1:34:17] thing with us because he bind every
[1:34:23] devil for us he said I bind the devil no
[1:34:27] he bound the devil and because the devil
[1:34:30] is bound you can bind him is that right
[1:34:34] the Bible said he led captivity captive
[1:34:35] and gave gifts unto me so you got to
[1:34:39] understand you say what presents uh oh
[1:34:40] you know what's going on let me tell you
[1:34:43] all something when God did this work
[1:34:45] through a little Kentucky and nobody
[1:34:48] wanted to hear him they rejected him
[1:34:52] many people may wonder what that picture
[1:34:54] is you know he said that's brother
[1:34:55] Branham and when I see that picture I
[1:34:57] don't see brother family I see the light
[1:34:58] above his head the light above his head
[1:35:01] it was the first supernatural sign a
[1:35:03] picture that this America had ever
[1:35:05] caught on camera he talked about it
[1:35:08] hello that's the same pillar fire that
[1:35:12] led the children of Israel hallelujah oh
[1:35:16] come on somebody ain't no worshipping of
[1:35:18] a man over here but the Christ Jesus
[1:35:21] that he produced no man I don't care all
[1:35:25] robbers Billy Graham and all of the
[1:35:27] great ministers of this hour could not
[1:35:29] come
[1:35:30] paired themselves to what God did
[1:35:32] through this man he was a humble man he
[1:35:36] never boasts himself he never produced
[1:35:38] man did that people did that and that
[1:35:41] was the working of the devil is that
[1:35:43] right to block the way it's true it's
[1:35:54] true how can we put him in a position
[1:35:57] that he didn't want to be in but we did
[1:36:00] it I said we but let me move on it was
[1:36:03] Jesus he came to declare he could do
[1:36:06] nothing oh he didn't he never healed a
[1:36:08] person he never raised the dead it was
[1:36:11] Christ in him showing us he was the wave
[1:36:15] she that there was more to come we can't
[1:36:18] just look at the man it's you now it's
[1:36:21] your day the move is on the bride you
[1:36:25] the ones who God wants to use to raise
[1:36:27] the dead you the one that God wills to
[1:36:29] use to open the eyes of the bride you're
[1:36:31] the one that God wants to use it bring
[1:36:34] good tidings to tell his people amen
[1:36:38] there's a rapture on we can't preach
[1:36:44] Moses message Joshua is on the scene but
[1:36:49] we can't forget what Moses preached
[1:36:50] because God said to Joshua don't you
[1:36:53] forget what Moses taught you you
[1:36:55] understand me but you and I we are in
[1:36:57] another fall of this message and until
[1:37:00] you come to recognize who you are yes
[1:37:02] lord I you know too many of us are we
[1:37:04] too grounded I'm gonna move done I had
[1:37:06] to cut it short because I want you to
[1:37:08] understand I ain't done I'm gonna keep
[1:37:10] preaching on this until you get it my
[1:37:12] thing is this you and I must understand
[1:37:14] that we are in after what we call the
[1:37:16] rapture age the whole world can't see
[1:37:19] that they can't see it
[1:37:21] but you little group of people he said
[1:37:24] fear not little flock it is the father's
[1:37:28] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:37:29] and you and I are here amen because God
[1:37:33] sent a messenger for running himself
[1:37:35] like he did John the Baptist for running
[1:37:38] Jesus Christ is that right and now we in
[1:37:41] a position that we know that to be
[1:37:43] and we realized amen now that we can see
[1:37:46] the world Laodicea rich increase with
[1:37:49] good blind and make it and don't know it
[1:37:52] is that right that's how they are they
[1:37:55] really think they're gonna go sweeping
[1:37:57] through the city and they don't
[1:37:58] understand they're moving through the
[1:38:01] council of churches there's ru 90 time
[1:38:03] that y'all know that God is uniting all
[1:38:05] his people by supernatural verses right
[1:38:09] and he's uniting the world council of
[1:38:11] churches by organizations and
[1:38:12] denominationalism because that is the
[1:38:15] mark of the beast and people don't want
[1:38:18] to believe it
[1:38:19] but it's so and the sad part about it is
[1:38:22] when if they're not out of those systems
[1:38:25] before the rapture take place they will
[1:38:29] have received the mark because you can
[1:38:33] only receive the mark of God which is
[1:38:34] the Holy Spirit or the mark of the beast
[1:38:37] hello you understand me so I want you to
[1:38:40] understand you know church can save you
[1:38:43] no group of people can save you only
[1:38:46] Jesus Christ himself you love the Lord
[1:38:50] we conjugate as believe us as a body and
[1:38:57] every one of us differ in something but
[1:39:02] everything's one thing that we supposed
[1:39:03] to be agreeing on and that is having the
[1:39:05] Holy Ghost you love the Lord oh it was
[1:39:14] so much I want to bring let me just
[1:39:18] close with this because I've gone long
[1:39:20] enough Ephesians 1 says blessed be the
[1:39:24] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:26] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:39:29] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[1:39:33] according as he have chosen us in him
[1:39:36] before the foundation of the world that
[1:39:38] we should be holy and without blame
[1:39:40] before him in love having predestinated
[1:39:43] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:39:46] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:39:49] good pleasure of his will and everybody
[1:39:51] all I am adopted let me tell you
[1:39:53] something until your body is completely
[1:39:55] changed
[1:39:56] until you have a glorified body on you
[1:40:00] understand me it is that the rapture it
[1:40:02] is at the translation when you and I
[1:40:05] receive our completion then we'll preach
[1:40:10] for thirty to forty days
[1:40:14] what closing when Jesus raised from the
[1:40:18] dead when he when he died is that right
[1:40:20] y'all heard the shout you hear the
[1:40:22] message he is the message he is the
[1:40:24] message and when he said Father forgive
[1:40:27] them for they know not what they do when
[1:40:29] he said that guess what
[1:40:31] something happened and when he died
[1:40:34] something happened
[1:40:35] those that were in the grave heard his
[1:40:38] voice read the scripture the Bible said
[1:40:41] there was a great earthquake and you and
[1:40:43] I know we're looking for the great
[1:40:45] earthquake because around that time is
[1:40:47] when the resurrection takes place hmm
[1:40:51] when everything is chaotic that's when
[1:40:54] people won't even miss you
[1:40:56] they don't think you've been consumed
[1:41:01] hallelujah and don't you know even
[1:41:03] scientists says California is almost
[1:41:05] ready to go Oh y'all think I'm crazy
[1:41:09] maybe but I know that is true California
[1:41:14] will sink you said oh but what all those
[1:41:16] people my son is out there my brother's
[1:41:21] out there my cousin's out there but you
[1:41:23] know what God never destroyed the
[1:41:26] righteous with the wicked if he's
[1:41:28] righteous gotta get him out of there but
[1:41:33] if he's not it ain't my business somehow
[1:41:35] he'll it's the truth is the truth don't
[1:41:39] you realize they meant God Tosa alot
[1:41:43] Abraham says listen the angel said -
[1:41:45] until they we could get loud out there
[1:41:47] you we can't destroy the city see so let
[1:41:54] me go back to the am jumping but anyway
[1:41:56] when he Jesus descended into hell did
[1:41:59] y'all know that did you know that Jesus
[1:42:01] descended into hell the Bob said he went
[1:42:03] into the lower regions he went into that
[1:42:04] region to do it to preach to the souls
[1:42:06] that were in prison those souls who
[1:42:09] rejected him
[1:42:10] when he was in Noah's day discipline
[1:42:12] Jesus wasn't there yes he was
[1:42:14] that wasn't Noah preaching that was God
[1:42:17] in nor and when they rejected nor they
[1:42:20] rejected Jesus because all nor did was
[1:42:23] preach the word and then that was the
[1:42:27] first incident and then the second
[1:42:29] Exodus amen was when when Moses preached
[1:42:33] right now understand there is that Jesus
[1:42:36] had an exodus to what was he doing
[1:42:38] calling him out of the organized
[1:42:40] religion Jesus looked like a look call
[1:42:44] or what we define the cult hello
[1:42:48] y'all got quiet but he did here was this
[1:42:51] man amen with 12 disciples and all of
[1:42:57] them then left their jobs and left their
[1:42:59] homes and left everything and everything
[1:43:01] else following Jesus and Jesus said
[1:43:05] foxes have holes and birds have nests
[1:43:07] but the Son of man has no place to lay
[1:43:10] his head but I'm following you Jesus no
[1:43:16] matter what it takes
[1:43:17] stripped me from everything I'm
[1:43:20] following Jesus not a man not
[1:43:25] organization not even religion I'm
[1:43:27] following Jesus and when Jesus died the
[1:43:33] Bible said he went into the region of
[1:43:35] the loss and he preached through the
[1:43:36] souls in prison and you know what no
[1:43:37] doubt he more than likely said why did
[1:43:39] not you believe Noah Noah was my seed my
[1:43:44] man of righteousness and you fail to
[1:43:46] believe him did he say repent no there
[1:43:51] was no altar call he left those souls
[1:43:54] screaming in hell but when he left there
[1:43:58] the Bible said he went to paradise there
[1:44:03] in paradise you had Abraham and Sarah
[1:44:08] guess what you even had a thief on the
[1:44:10] cross they were all there in paradise
[1:44:15] hallelujah and I can see Jesus that they
[1:44:18] began to market coming up now they're
[1:44:20] coming up because now you got to realize
[1:44:21] that when Jesus rose
[1:44:23] he went to heaven amen he carried a band
[1:44:26] with him he cared all those who had died
[1:44:28] under that Old Covenant with him Oh
[1:44:31] lift up your gates ye everlasting doors
[1:44:35] and be lifted up and let the King of
[1:44:37] glory come in that angels at the gate
[1:44:39] says who is this King of glory
[1:44:42] I love that I wish they replay that for
[1:44:44] me when I get there
[1:44:46] he said the Lord mighty in battle what
[1:44:50] it was a battle he whooped the devil he
[1:44:55] defeated death hell and the grave
[1:44:56] hallelujah he went to hell for you took
[1:45:00] the keys out of the route of Satan's and
[1:45:02] shut the door back on him rose up and
[1:45:06] when he rolled everybody that died in
[1:45:09] God rose with him yeah read your Bible
[1:45:13] it says that even those who weren't
[1:45:15] believer Saucer oh that look like
[1:45:18] Abraham then look like Sarah
[1:45:20] hallelujah why because the dead in
[1:45:23] Cairo's appeared to many hello people
[1:45:30] saw them and still didn't believe if
[1:45:36] they were to believe Pentecost would
[1:45:38] have been more than 120 people but you
[1:45:42] know what that's the way it is now
[1:45:43] people can see miracles people can see
[1:45:46] signs and wonders and they still don't
[1:45:48] believe but anyway that was the
[1:45:52] resurrection see Jesus had to rise first
[1:45:55] in order for them to rise that right he
[1:45:57] rose he went amen and so you and I must
[1:46:00] understand that Jesus bridged the gap
[1:46:04] between time and eternity he made a way
[1:46:08] for us to get back home had not had been
[1:46:11] for Calvary we would have never been
[1:46:14] able to go back to where we came from
[1:46:15] and now the life of God is in us pulling
[1:46:20] us like a magnet back to himself you
[1:46:24] love the Lord I'm a minister on this for
[1:46:28] a little while but I cut it short today
[1:46:30] I didn't get where I really wanted to be
[1:46:32] but I'm gonna tell you something you got
[1:46:34] to know who you are I know I just didn't
[1:46:37] coming to this world to go to hell and
[1:46:39] God didn't make me a Christian and send
[1:46:41] me to hell he could have left me out
[1:46:43] there in the club if he wanted to but
[1:46:45] one thing I ask God for in 1977 I said
[1:46:50] to God and you know I saw something that
[1:46:52] was supernatural and I said to the Lord
[1:46:54] I says Lord whatever you do don't let me
[1:46:57] miss the rapture I brought that back to
[1:47:00] his attention just the other day I says
[1:47:01] Lord whatever you do don't let me miss
[1:47:03] the rapture and I know God is going to
[1:47:05] keep his promises
[1:47:06] he brought me that's when I had my eyes
[1:47:09] were open to this because I saw so much
[1:47:12] failure I saw so much you're not that
[1:47:15] done I'm not saying that that's saying
[1:47:17] I'm not saying that we don't have
[1:47:18] problems and we don't fail sometimes but
[1:47:21] I just saw too much I was a god I was a
[1:47:26] bro I was a brother that believe in the
[1:47:27] supernatural of God I've seen it in my
[1:47:30] mom and one of the things that I never
[1:47:34] liked it's when people would say well
[1:47:36] God don't mean that or that's not for
[1:47:39] our day when Hebrew says Jesus Christ is
[1:47:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:47:43] he's a God that changed not and so you
[1:47:46] and I must understand you all of one you
[1:47:49] are either of the seed of God or you're
[1:47:52] not the soil only so to sees there's
[1:47:56] only two scenes the seed of God and the
[1:47:57] seed of the wicked one you have to
[1:48:00] determine who you are and I say it like
[1:48:03] this
[1:48:03] I am heaven bound and understand heaven
[1:48:06] ain't ain't my the resting place for me
[1:48:08] its resting place but it's not the final
[1:48:11] because after three and a half years
[1:48:13] we're coming back down here Oh God
[1:48:16] they'll be able to do a new heaven and a
[1:48:18] new earth come on somebody guess what
[1:48:21] y'all think I can shout now but y'all
[1:48:22] wait till they throw him in the lake of
[1:48:24] fire ha ha
[1:48:25] when they throw that Devon y'all might
[1:48:27] look up this the devil let's go no you
[1:48:29] gonna hear my voice you will hear me all
[1:48:33] that brother Brooks over there
[1:48:36] oh yeah you and I can't even imagine
[1:48:39] what its gonna be like when there is no
[1:48:43] trouble
[1:48:45] you know the Bible said in heaven to see
[1:48:47] it's like glass to see a glass you know
[1:48:52] why because the earth won't be wobbly no
[1:48:55] more you know why the why we have waves
[1:48:59] because the earth wobbles because of
[1:49:02] what the fall it staggers like a trumpet
[1:49:07] but in that day when everything is at
[1:49:09] peace the sea will be so crystal clear
[1:49:14] to be so calm it'll look like you can
[1:49:16] walk on it and guess what you can if you
[1:49:18] want to
[1:49:19] [Laughter]

[1:57:49] said but it must be done in the name of
[1:57:51] the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ did they
[1:57:56] get baptized and they did why because

[1:58:03] it all all that was in God he poured it
[1:58:06] into Christ all that it was in Christ he
[1:58:08] put it into his bride his bride is not a
