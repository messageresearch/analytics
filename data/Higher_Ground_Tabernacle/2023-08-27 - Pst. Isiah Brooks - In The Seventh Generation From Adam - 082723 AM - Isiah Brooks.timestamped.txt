[30:22] we're so thankful for God's grace
[30:27] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[30:29] to the word of the Lord
[30:33] we're going to be coming from two
[30:35] passages of scripture
[30:38] the first will be a Hebrews the 11 5.
[30:44] and the second one will be from Saint
[30:47] John
[30:49] 5.29 uh
[30:54] uh last Sunday or the Sunday that we
[30:57] were here last
[30:59] we were working with the end of the
[31:02] Harvest
[31:03] and I trust by the grace of God that
[31:06] we'll be able to uh
[31:09] end this session up
[31:14] um
[31:15] today we're going to uh
[31:18] uh work on uh the subject
[31:23] the Seventh Generation from Adam
[31:29] the vision of Enoch
[31:33] all I could say is
[31:35] the gospel is so beautiful to me
[31:40] all I could say is the word of God is so
[31:45] wonderful to me
[31:48] uh it's it's just
[31:50] um amazing
[31:53] how God being so great
[31:58] it could form himself into a word
[32:03] that his creation might understand him
[32:08] it truly is a beautiful situation
[32:14] Hebrews 11 and 5.
[32:18] by faith Enoch was translated
[32:22] that he should not see death
[32:25] amen and was not found because God
[32:28] translated him
[32:30] for before his translation
[32:33] he had this testimony that he pleased
[32:37] God foreign
[32:41] [Music]
[32:52] remember brother Branham
[32:54] said Enoch type the bride the Enoch and
[32:58] enote
[33:01] John 5. I don't know jeans
[33:05] 25-29 River 7th century
[33:12] Hallelujah
[33:15] and it reads
[33:18] verily verily I say unto you
[33:21] the hour is come and now is
[33:26] Hallelujah when the dead shall hear the
[33:30] voice of the son of God
[33:33] and they that here shall live amenities
[33:38] [Music]
[33:46] for as the father hath life in himself
[33:49] so hath he given to the son to have life
[33:53] in himself
[34:00] and have given him authority to execute
[34:04] judgment also because he is the son of
[34:09] man
[34:14] Marvel not at this
[34:17] for the hour is come
[34:20] in the which all that are in the graves
[34:24] shall hear his voice
[34:32] and shall come forth they that are done
[34:36] they that have done good
[34:38] unto the resurrection of life
[34:41] and they that have done evil
[34:44] unto the resurrection of damnation is
[34:55] you love the Lord
[34:58] before we go any further
[35:01] I want to bring attention to every year
[35:07] even as you were born
[35:12] we will all die
[35:15] [Music]
[35:17] except the Bro except the Rapture takes
[35:19] place I'm wondering
[35:22] in other words There Is No Escape
[35:27] we will all have to face the Lord Jesus
[35:32] Christ
[35:36] whether we be right
[35:39] or whether we be wrong
[35:42] amen let us pray you know Heavenly
[35:46] Father Celeste we come before you Lord
[35:48] Jesus
[35:49] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[35:53] for your mercy we pray this morning that
[35:58] your perfect will be done
[36:00] every spirit in this place that is not
[36:04] like you Lord give your servant
[36:07] pre-course
[36:09] give us Grace to move completely out of
[36:13] your way out of your voice this morning
[36:17] speak to your people Lord that they may
[36:20] hear you not in their heads
[36:23] but in their hearts Lord we thank you
[36:27] this morning
[36:28] for being who you are foreign
[36:44] thank you for this morning
[36:47] thank you for the victory that you've
[36:49] given to us
[36:50] and we praise you Lord Jesus
[36:53] for being who you are foreign
[37:06] as as I was studying
[37:10] I was just looking at so many things
[37:15] you and I know as we started this
[37:18] message
[37:20] with the coming of Elijah
[37:24] we dealt with the ministry of William
[37:27] Branham
[37:29] that he was the Elijah of our day
[37:34] in his ministry you know
[37:38] the acceptable
[37:40] year of the Lord
[37:43] as well as the Revenge you will see the
[37:46] Revenge of the Lord
[37:49] and the reason being is
[37:52] Jesus Christ's ears
[37:57] so he had to bring both portions along
[38:02] the portion of acceptability
[38:07] he called it our Jubilee
[38:48] Hallelujah and he brought the day of
[38:51] Moses
[38:54] god used him in such a mighty way
[38:57] that he was he was able to touch the
[39:01] scripture
[39:03] from Genesis all the way to Revelation
[39:07] it was not the man is
[39:10] it was God in the man
[39:12] and what was God doing
[39:15] he was proving to
[39:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[39:22] and forever and he does not change
[39:27] his word is the same
[39:30] now we find out
[39:33] that Enoch was the seventh from Adam it
[39:37] is
[39:42] been a son of Adam you see uh
[39:46] the eighth Generations
[39:49] [Music]
[40:00] there were things going on even though
[40:03] the scripture doesn't say much
[40:07] but one of the things we
[40:09] [Music]
[40:10] think things is that the vision of Enoch
[40:15] into Noah's vision of the world
[40:18] destruction
[40:21] and the wise versions
[40:25] amen we saw by the grace of God
[40:31] you would have never known
[40:59] [Music]
[41:29] was able to build this pyramid
[41:33] [Music]
[41:45] [Music]
[41:49] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[41:52] [Music]
[41:55] he rejected by his own
[42:00] and all that refuse Enoch is
[42:07] in the same place
[42:24] [Music]
[42:33] amen and in that Walking with God you'll
[42:36] find that there's not much
[42:42] sure don't Hallelujah
[42:44] but listen Enoch was doing more than
[42:48] just walking with God
[42:50] he's walk with God
[43:00] Amen what was required for his day to
[43:06] escape the oncoming judgment
[43:10] and the Bible tells us
[43:14] hallelujah was translated
[43:17] he moved from one dimension
[43:21] Hallelujah
[43:23] because he had a testimony
[43:27] [Music]
[43:31] in order to be translated
[43:41] you cannot live
[43:44] under they are inspiration of Noah
[43:50] under that
[43:56] day
[44:00] [Music]
[44:04] glory to God
[44:06] whether you understand that or not
[44:08] there's no Escape
[44:12] you must face God
[44:14] face God and we are right at the end of
[44:24] which was the foundation
[44:34] it was what the early church was built
[44:37] upon this is
[44:39] built upon the faith
[44:49] [Music]
[45:06] we understand that Enoch had a blood
[45:09] sacrifice
[45:11] see that was what made Enoch perfect
[45:15] this is
[45:18] in his works
[45:22] in the blood sacrifice
[45:35] of perfection
[45:38] that's exactly right
[45:42] Hallelujah
[45:48] [Music]
[45:50] okay
[45:58] because he is a God
[46:03] Hallelujah the Bible said be perfect
[46:07] Hallelujah as your father which is in
[46:10] heaven is perfect
[46:14] are you going to be perfect without the
[46:17] hairstyles
[46:19] how are you going to be perfect
[46:32] Hallelujah is that right
[46:36] God is real
[46:38] and you and I must understand
[46:40] I'm going to preach this morning I don't
[46:43] care
[46:45] yeah
[46:49] like a different church this morning
[46:52] but we had a good time Wednesday yeah
[46:56] and we want to have a good time this
[46:58] morning
[46:59] you must understand
[47:01] in the days of Enoch it was just as evil
[47:06] as this day is
[47:09] Hallelujah
[47:16] [Music]
[47:34] Hallelujah
[47:49] here's the prophet that God says in
[47:52] paragraph 51. he said I can see him go
[47:56] up to the region of the Lost
[48:01] knocks on the door
[48:04] he's available they began screaming and
[48:07] wailing
[48:10] Souls that repented knots
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] you're going to die someday whether you
[48:30] young or old but you better make ready
[48:34] everybody
[48:42] yes sir they began to scream and wailing
[48:47] no souls that repented not
[48:52] [Music]
[49:08] [Music]
[49:31] if you missed
[49:36] your conscience
[49:38] [Music]
[49:41] preaching this message
[49:47] [Music]
[49:52] it works
[49:56] this is not a picnic this is not a
[49:59] religious cult
[50:01] this is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[50:04] being formed and shaped in the image of
[50:07] Jesus Christ
[50:11] you can have all your worldly pleasures
[50:14] Hallelujah
[50:21] I
[50:28] absolutely that Enoch had a spirit a
[50:30] spiritual revelation
[50:32] foreign
[50:53] [Music]
[51:07] [Music]
[51:08] but they didn't want to believe that
[51:11] it was a time like this day a time
[51:16] of idol I don't listen to it idolatry
[51:20] did you do that tree Hallelujah but that
[51:23] Enoch had a revelation
[51:26] oh who I am I am
[51:30] here that was pretty
[51:33] Korean words
[51:36] this is not a new testament doctrine
[51:40] that was always
