jerusalem jerusalem or jerusalem jerusalem we are marching over to jerusalem oh we are marching over [Music] old jerusalem jerusalem we are marching over to jerusalem we are marching over to jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem jerusalem amen thank god for his grace and his mercy amen god is good to us amen just prior to the service i got news one of my close friends passed away due to coveted you know even though he's we know that he'll be in a greater place just the fact that i'll not see him on this side again is rather saddening and it's amazing because one of these old days uh we'll see him in jerusalem we thank god for our precious brother stephen francis and we my condolences to the family there in south africa and i trust that and i know the lord will bring him through the good part is that his wife is recovering and i know it's very difficult for them because i've never seen two live human doves as it were with them they really loved each other but anyway we thank god for the youth this morning and we had planned to minister but you know our brother enoch came through he is with brother chad lamb and he goes to the church and there and then we have our brother wesley godfrey who i've known uh even when his within his mother's womb if you want to say it like that i remember we prayed another pray that god will bless her with children and of course he was the first we thank god for him by god's grace and we appreciate him coming and we're going to invite our brother enoch to come up and he can introduce himself he's got some roots that will tie in with some of us today and so i just want him to have his way um he first told me no and then god touched him amen you know because i feel like this man has come through a lot of things he's been in the message for a long while and he can tell you some things that will encourage you so we're trusting that uh the lord i want him to be free don't be nervous i will be able to tell it no i'm just kidding i shouldn't say that you know everybody can smile it doesn't cost a penny and we thank god come brother have you have the all weight [Music] now it's on yep i can hear myself um i appreciate that having the opportunity to talk to the bride of christ and um just wanted to you know brother um asked me yesterday to uh uh maybe to share my testimony a little bit and initially i'm actually a very shy person so it's not something that you know i uh that comes naturally to me but i had the opportunity to speak to a some youth um with my my dad's church um you know i'm back in boston um and just uh it was definitely a burden for me to just share my heart and just to know what kind of things that y'all go through you know i've gone to you know middle school high school college i understand the pressures of all those things i understand what it takes to live a christian life in in this generation uh appreciate all of you um just uh your stance here coming on a saturday and just um you know i just pray something it said that be a benefit to all of you all right so let's just pray and just let the lord have his way heavenly father um when i look through this these these young men here this group here god it just reminds me so much of uh of myself god and god i'm such a un worthy vessel to to bring just uh something here but god i know that you put something in my heart god and i pray that be i'll be able to just just uh let let go and have and have and let you have your way god and may it be a benefit um they they have a great ministry here surely that um the pastor had something great of value god but i you know just uh what he's uh just uh the news maybe that he had today maybe it's a good thing that he can just uh take time just to deal with the sad news that has occurred to one of his friends god but i pray that you be with us from the beginning to the end god i pray that you may just anoint the word that we're about to preach and just uh and to just testify about our testimony a little bit we pray all this in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] well let's just start with a uh a scripture and in romans romans 8. and 14 for as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have now received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption where we cry abba father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if we're children then we're heirs of god and joining with christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which has been revealed in us amen you may have your seed amen you know um as i you know talk to any any group of especially young people i always put myself in their shoes and because it's still pretty easy for me to do and and try to remember what kind of challenges and what kind of um things are dealt with as somebody who is growing up in the message you know my dad was um is a minister but was a pastor and just watching what uh what kind of things make young people successful what kind of things make them um be really the kind of christians that they need to be and the these are they're very simple keys and and i i believe that no doubt um your pastors have uh your pastor has covered that and and and just uh i just want to bring it in my own anger and my own my own story you know um and and i just uh want to start with uh a lot of these quotes will be coming from a message why are my people so tossed about and the first one here is um uh as the prophet will say the christian the the christian rest in that hope upon the stormy seas there's sure uh storms rise and all kinds of trouble but we're anchored that's all i'm not here uh it never it never sinks it never sinks i notice i've noticed many times in my life to be uh i've noticed many christians in my life to be up and down and i wondered about it and i and without preaching such a text out here in other churches where i go i want i thought it best to deliver this to the people in the time like why are people so tossed about you find them people who have that seem to be very religious seem to have a deep desire and a daily search and hunt and seek god but never come to a settlement of any kind to here to where they could ever be rested or anchored in christ now this is a question that the prophet is asking himself and he's watching um uh different different uh uh christians that they have a desire to live a christian life i believe most young people have a desire to live a christian life most of them you know you want to live a christian life but you find yourself always like struggling between two different opinions because yeah you come to church and the pastor is preaching one direction right he's telling he's telling you um uh how how to obtain the things of god he's telling you how to uh be live a christian life and then you go to school and then you have this this influences it's it's like living a different world sunday on sunday you're feeling like you know this today was my day on monday you know i know most of you have some probably summer vacation you're gonna miss that but um i i'll tell you i'll tell you like go i remember going back to you know after a good summer going to different camps and things of that nature um and then having uh having to go back to public school and it was this uh this fight between the influences of the the right influences and the wrong influences and the thing that i wish i would have grasped earlier is that if you want to live a christian life if you want to um you know live a li a a life that is worthy of the gospel you have to be you have to you can't be as the bible says uh having two different opinions you can there's no way to uh live a christian life and fear what people think there's there's you it's uh it's it's a a waste of time to live a christian try to live a christian life and not let your friends know that you're a christian it's a waste of time to try to you know have all your all your church friends oh they know that you know you you read the bible you come to church every day but none of your uh worldly friend order friends or classmates know that you're a christian that's those are two different uh that's a hypocrisy if i go to your school and i asked uh about or your workplace or your uh college or whatever and i asked them uh this young man this uh or this sister or this individual uh you know uh are they christian if they they give me a look like they don't know that's that's a bad sign that that's that's a really a waste of a cr uh it's it's a waste of a your uh christian walk it's a waste of your you're not actually living the christian life it's not because remember uh when the uh when chris when christian andy first started people were willing to die for it people were not ashamed of the gospel and i find so many individuals that are ashamed of the gospel because the gospel has a reproach you know uh you see the sisters dressed and right and and they're automatically the first thing is the peer pressure of everybody already knows you're different and young people just want to be the same as everybody but that aspect of that it's a natural um tendency to want to to go where your peers are going but if you feel in your heart that there's this aspect of wanting to please people that you know once you graduate from college once you graduate from high school you probably not never see these people again if you have that aspect that you still want to kind of show that hey you know um uh you know like i try to please them in any way when it comes and it makes you compromise you already know that there's something wrong with your christian experience already know that you're not there yet you're in your way there maybe you're reading your bible maybe you're really um uh maybe you're really sincere and as as we read the quote here about um uh you have a deep desire you're not you're not a bad kid you know a bad uh young man or a bad young uh sister no it's just that it's a fight and it's hard to die in this generation it that's what it is it's a it's uh it's a lack of depth to self and you find many people who have you it's a pride because because to be a christian that means that means they'll you know as you would know like uh there'll be jokes that are around and there's a choice do you partake in that or do you choose to live uh to actually be alone that's what it is i remember i remember being in high school and um and my family moved a lot so i was in three different high schools like you know four years three different high schools so that's you know very interesting but and i would uh you know the uh i i gave my life to christ and and i was you know i i would go i would go to you know the first uh week of class and they would they will they would look at they look at me and be like oh well he's probably into sports they just guessed that he sp they thought that i was one of them so you know everybody would try to to make new friends and things of that nature and eventually i couldn't go to the parties that they were going to i couldn't you know joke about the things they were joking about so i just kept quiet many times i couldn't do all these kind of things and and it just brought a separation and many times the word brings us separation and we try to bring a unity with things that we shouldn't unify with there's a reason the the the messages is is is is cutting it's because god does not want you to make alliances with with uh canaanites for the lack of bad word he doesn't want you to you know your job is not to be the most popular kid in school your job is not to be uh to be liked you're you're you know if you're if you want to be like you're still living for yourself you're still living for your own pleasures your own um you know uh you're you're still living for yourself you haven't actually done the first thing by dying to uh uh dying to yourself so not coming to a a deep relationship with christ is usually it's actually our fault you know it's our fault because it's available i'm just coming here to get a quote here um i told my dad a few minutes ago or uh maybe a hour ago that i was i was um gonna you know maybe share a little bit of my testimony and i asked for this particular quote and he was just laughing because he was like he's uh he's gonna be ministering as well and um maybe in a few weeks here and he just happened to be also using this quote as well so he just had it so it kind of encouraged me a little bit and the the this quota um is from questions and answers um the first first one that preached in 19 1964 um and the pro the prophet is answering a question from one of his probably a young lady here as he he will he would say um and let's just read it here brother bro um let's see where to start brother brown um i can't okay let me just uh spend the right the rest of the time here you um you can't uh surrender to jesus they they don't i don't i um i don't know man or woman i i can't tell what which it is god knows you can't surrender to jesus why why what's the matter if you are a woman don't you have a a uh don't you sacrifice to your husband to be a wife surren uh surrender all you are a little a little lady when you're married virtuous fought all your life to uh to be virtuous but one day you find a man that you love you've where he is you are he is completely the the uh the thing is that you the things that you fought for all your life uh to keep clean to keep um clear to keep a virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to one man isn't that right you put yourself completely in uh in his uh his hands you are all that you stood for uh indicency and moral and everything that now you uh you are you turn over uh because you sir uh you surround yourself to that man can't you do the same to uh to jesus christ just surrender yourself that way all that you are all your mind your thoughts certainly i don't think you are possessed of the evil spiri evil spirit i think that the i think that uh evil spirit anoints you with them thoughts uh try to make you think you cannot surrender yourself to god and uh this quote is uh just uh a little illustration as a a woman asking uh brother branham why can i not fully surrender and and the question uh the answer to it the prophet turns it around and say why he basically brings the responsibility to the individual and he says why can't you surrender why can't you um you know live a uh completely trust in god and the iss in the in the issue uh with this uh uh young uh young woman or uh individual here is that she has he's been anointed with evil spirits to make her think that she cannot surrender and that is actually what the devil does to all of us the reason you know like if there is a part of uh one's life that they can't surrender it's because the devil has convinced you that you cannot surrender it that's what it is the devil has convinced you it would be too hard to uh to surrender this the the the devil will tell you it's too hard to surrender entertainment that's what he will tell you be like well what else are you gonna do you know and i think one of those things uh entertainment is a plague in our generation you know i don't even think people can think right anymore without you know take your phone for five minutes i think people start shaking a little bit you know and and it's like how can and it hit me how can you live a christian life and not never have dedicate time to prayer because the issue is you know instagram is always you know you always hear that that alert telling you that there's something uh uh you know some of the somebody post something or whatever you know and it's just like with uh you can't you can't do that i i i was actually uh i thought it was funny um uh just speak uh that subject came up with uh some of us uh fellowshipping and and we find that in this generation we have so many influences so many things you know uh that the plague our time we have no time for dedicated prayer we have no time to deal with with issues we have no time to look at ourselves and say you know our time the prophet talked about you know meditation sitting down and thinking about what i need what i need to go to the next level in my life what do i need like and it's it's such a freeing time god can tell you what you should be doing god can tell you what career you should be pursuing god can tell you every every young man i've seen that takes time just to uh to worship him to read this scripture to to read the message to to really dedicate themselves i find that god blesses everything they do everything you know career-wise people you know they just uh they just take a career and just try to do something and you're not gifted in that that avenue god could have told you that and make you you know spend less tuition money if you just listen to him you know like and and not having that personal really the the most beautiful thing to have is a personal relationship with christ that's the most beautiful thing like you know that that time to to uh to be in prayer god answering your your uh your questions reading the scriptures and listen to the message and then you go to church and and the pastor is preaching exactly what you've been reading you know the and it's because you know there's individuals that um have taken basically you get what you put in you get you know like if you if you give ten percent you're only getting ten percent of what god has for you amen you know if you if you if you give fifty percent you're getting fifty percent if you get a hundred percent god will even give you more than that that's the secret that is a secret and and just you know i just want to encourage you never ever be ashamed of christ never be ashamed of living a christian life and that's and that's one of the things that deborah is going to try to do he's going to try to traumatize you with with rejection that's what he's going to try to he's it's uh and that's actually uh one of the things uh the title of this uh little uh uh talk right here um dealing with trauma there is a trauma in rejection there's a trauma in going to places and always being rejected there's a trauma with you never being uh you know because of your stance some people are avoiding you because of your stance your family avoiding you even if even your media family sometimes there's a trauma to that but if you can't you know withstand that you're not his if you cannot uh it's it's a choice you have to i want everybody to really look at their hearts today and just say am i willing to withstand rejection every day that's our christian life like we're rejected for you know our work rejected for just not going to uh you know uh any of the christmas uh parties and things of that nature it just doesn't stop you're just always gonna be rejected and but i'd rather be rejected and have experience with christ then then everybody except me and it's you know and everybody think you know i am whatever popular cool whatever the words that now people use uh it's not it's not worth it it's not worth sitting in your seats and having a a a a a a a life here that seems right and then going to one's home or one's place of work or one's uh or any friend group and and accept things that they're they'll be saying accept and live a mediocre life it's not that that it's like the biggest waste of time you know the most dangerous position to be in is to be close to the word and not be a part of the word you know that's you you find yourself in a jewish position because you're so close to the world you know um other you know uh other people that have never heard the message maybe in the day of judgment they'll have something to say you know i never heard you know but any person that has heard and walks away because and the reason people walk away is because they never took this time to to really take inventory if they're if they're willing to pay the price of of what of what the message is asking them to do that's why people walk away the for years they just a church they're clapping they're they seem to be as a good christian as anybody there at home you know on their computers on on whatever the it's a it's a double standard you know when you have a um when you have a uh issue in in whatever aspect if you're dealing with uh uh if you're dealing with things like uh i'll just say if you're dealing with things like lust and things of that nature it has to be dealt with you know you have you you have uh you got uh you probably have great parents that can talk you can talk to them about if you have a dad in your life you gotta talk to them about that kind of stuff god already sees it um god i'm just i'm just i've gone to enough youth camps talked to enough young people to know what i'm talking about okay so you have to deal with it that's a trump that's a trauma so you're going to church and and and every time you know the the gospel is being preached and you know that it's right and you know and you want to surrender but you know that you have this in your life and that trauma of sin and unconvinced sin or just besetting sin is affecting your walk to to to live a life a life that is worthy of the gospel and now it's in your subconscious you you know that uh i i you can't walk to his throne boldly you can't fully surrender why can't the young people can't fully surrender it's because uh the the guilts that they're they're facing they know the the they know every time the uh how holy this this standard is and they know they're not living up to that you just have to be honest what you need is to be honest and talk to uh talk to your pastor talk to uh i i know you uh this uh associate ministers here and and things about nature and and talk to god about it seriously just say this is where i struggle with god you know and maybe it's not that maybe it's entertainment and i think entertainment is i'm going to use the word trauma for entertainment because entertainment makes people neuro neurotics it's you're so you can't even young people can't even sit down for five minutes for a service young people like that's why you know uh that that's why i would say that's why people struggle because the entertainment runs you know 100 miles per hour the things of a god you know are slow they take time it takes time to pray it takes time to just relax your not your mind so god can speak to you many many times people ask why is god not speaking to me he's actually speaking to you but you can't just hear because you know whatever sport sport is going on and there's always something that you know basketball season is over football is coming the dev already knows he gets you whatever baseball whatever it is and you're always and it's these are not even bad things right like uh there's nothing wrong wrong with with uh with with sports the the issue is the time it's the time we a lot to it is adultery like it's it's you can't live a christian life and give god five minutes and give lebron james like you know for four hours of your time that's it like that's that's that's what it is you know and and that's a decision you have to also make how much time am i am i spending on entertainment how much time am i spending on sports how much time am i am i spending doing things that not profitable and and just have that uh that clear clear channel with with the lord um let's just uh i don't know how much time i have here so i'll just uh you know maybe move it along a little bit here but uh once again going to a message called um why are my people so tossed about and and um this i've learned in experience that is people of um in uh uh sargon god and this i have learned to be in experience is is that people of intel uh intelligence now now uh speaking this there's two types of christians that seems that seems strange but i would not say two uh different types i would say two phases will be uh will be better to use not two different types two different phases the same christianity but two different phases of it one of them they have intel uh intelligence or a mental conception of what god has said in his word and and of jesus christ by the way of knowledge and the other is by ex experiential exp uh experiential experience that god has given that the man in his heart so there's two different phases of it like and i believe most of you have probably experienced the first phase which is the the mental conception uh you know the knowledge of the message the knowledge of the bible and that's what most people have they really have a a knowledge of the bible but what they lack is experience of it and that's why once you get the experience you can't walk away once you get an experience i've i experienced you cannot walk away from my experience and but the problem is why do people don't get experience is because they don't spend enough time for that experience to drop from their head into their hearts that's why it's it's a lot it's a it's a it's a lack of time of surrendering you know i remember a story where the prophet would talk to uh was uh talking about a woman a pink a believer her name a forgotten name but uh she was struggling with um with alcohol and she was at the institutions i've given her up and and um you know and she would go from church to church just trying to get rid of this this habit in a lot in their life um and and it took so she finally comes up to uh the prophet and the prophet asks her to pray about this this situation so she prays maybe for five minutes and she comes back to the prophet says i believe something has changed and the prophet goes like nothing has changed in you go back and pray and and and the prophet and the woman uh prays prays for more time and comes back the prophet and and and he he tells he he tells her again go back and pray what you know and then she goes until she breaks through she takes she took time to really not to not uh something hap something hap it's an experience where what you've always known becomes a reality to you what you've always have heard becomes a reality and now you are doing things um automatically and many times faith is actually as the prophet would say it's unconscious what your real you is your uncon it's your subconscious and that's well that's why many times many people believe in this the conscious level you know they think they believe but what but the way you know that you believe is when things get hard and you see what is in you then that's that's that's the real you like that in the real you is not your your your conception of your sincerity your the real you is not you know what you oh i heard this in in church i i really believe that's not the real you the real you is when the devil comes and challenges that and there's something there that that tells you that i i i can't do that i can't go there with you i can't there's there's something that that that triggers you just to to uh that that is a real the real you when you have a when somebody says something bad about you what what rises up is it your old self or is it a new life that actually abides now um same message the one is intel uh intelligence or um the the intellectual is hungering he he is feasting on god but his feast does not hold the other seems to have victory all the time there's nothing that bothers them they're solid they're anchored as they can be no trials no storm brother uh brothers bothers them at all but they seem to have something about them that some p us that some who are christians try to live for god um admire that type of christian and i've uh i i've often wondered lord what is it that makes people um has um lord what is it that these people has that others pray so much and yet feel to have uh yet seem to fail to get it um and and that's and that's a question one uh that that um you know obviously uh dealing with right now what makes uh some christians really achieve that solid place in their life where they're unshakable nothing seemed to happen there's no you know one of the most hurtful places you can be is actually church that's actually it and it's it's meant to be that way because it's meant to test you everything if if you still have complexes oh church you bring them out because somebody is you will say something do something that really will challenge you really will hurt you and and that's that's and that's why god wants us to still come to church because it's a place where it challenges what we we think we believe many times um and say uh same message i've met people who stand in church and rejoice and will seem to get out of the the church uh maybe on monday or tuesday um and just uh unbelieving uh or uh living on behalf be having or becoming to christian and the man or the woman would will make it uh will be would would turn again and shake your hand and say i don't mean to do those things i feel sorry for them you you see people accept divine healing oh yes it is is the word oh i believe it lord i believe it and the goal right for a few days and the first storm that strikes god uh and and um they're back they they go again you know this it's true and people can't help it it's something so what is it about what causes these things to happen you know and any if you if you watch your life your life will tell you the fruits of your life will tell you what you are when a storm happens what is your how do you cope with it many times what the devil wants you to do is to use you know back open mechanisms you know such as entertainment such as you know instead of spending that time with uh with the lord and and dealing with him amen same message now you truly have two different faculties you have one of them that is in your head by your brain and you have another one that is in your heart which is called the soul and the soul now they are so much now they are so much in disagreement many times when the heart seems to say something the soul wanders at it is it's it's uh it that at it if it's right but when it comes into the soul the the head seems to be uh the head seems to step back and that's where we want to be all these all these uh uh concepts we've been hearing for genera uh for for years now we want that to drop into the soul we want it to not be something that is in in just in our mental faculties we want it to be something that is something that is real amen i wrote a couple of uh notes as well here just uh wanted to deal with a few things before we just turned the service over um you know and one i just wanted to do deal for uh some some different uh traumas that could uh that that do happen to a believer you know one of them being the the trauma of not um the the the trauma of seemingly on prayer unanswered prayers you know it's it's a it's an odd subject but i believe it's true because many people the truth is we can be offended even at god um let's take the the story of john the baptist he finds himself offended at god why because he did everything what the that the lord want him to do but he still finds himself in a situation where he is he's caged up you know um jesus is doing what he uh you know he uh has a uh jesus is doing what uh john has always said he would do but it seems like jesus is not coming there and taking john from that situation and that actually causes a complex when you see when you see uh uh you know you have something in your heart that you're bringing up to the lord and he it seems like he doesn't answer it right away you know i mean the the things of god sometimes um many times take time you know and and and i i remember being um being in school and i actually um one of one of my biggest prayers was was uh uh you know just praying for god to give me academic success um i was i came to this country kind of uh later in um well not too late like uh seven years old um i found myself you know all the kids there uh in school seemed to get things much faster than i could um and then years later i found out i was i was dyslexic so basically um i had a hard time decoding um words and and which made english and comprehension uh not not not great and i would i would be constantly praying god just help me in my in my studies and you know i after a few i would call them f pluses you know uh i just got frustrated with all all these things i got a plus it was f plus but it's a plus uh and and and it was just like god why why did you put me in this situation why why am i i found myself isolated not doing well in school uh not having friends in school trying to live a christian life that's all i had and i'm like what's what's wrong with with you know i go to church in the these i see all these promises that the lord promised and then i go to uh to uh uh to school and and nothing seems to be working right and it took it took uh i think a complex buildup um because of that and in in and what i found was this when when it's not god's time it's just not gonna work out you know when it's not god's time it's it you know if if god um you know god was waiting for moses to come of age if the uh the people of israel will have uh prayed and fast or whatever it did not matter because the prophecy said 400 years that's right so many times we pray for maybe we pray for revival maybe we pray for uh our friends and loved ones or whatever but it's not god's time yet but what i would say is that even if the prayer is not being answered immediately it doesn't mean god is not answering i i tell you i only say this to the glory of god you know at 16 years old or 17 years old um my teachers were under the impressions i was reading i wasn't i was memorizing words just like each word was a each word it was a um a different character like a symbol you just think of about that way um and i had no ability to just to be if it was a new word there was no way for me to break it down because you know i didn't have the uh all the the rules of um uh uh you know of just breaking down a a word down i just i couldn't do it it just that's dyslexia you just just can't do it and and god super uh supernaturally uh brought um you know one day my my my my mom was was uh was reading the article and they were just describing the condition i had you know like basically uh dyslexics you know we tend to do great in science math and and things of that nature but you know and some people you actually think that uh we're you know i guess a gifted in some areas but this is a uh by when it comes to reading like i'll give you example like einstein was dyslexic it's well-known um but um um and but he couldn't it took my while to actually read but he could do all the math in the world right and physics so but god brought me to uh uh you know uh uh brought this article to my mom and and we discovered that we're just i'm dyslexic and uh i'm going to a uh uh you know to a another psychologist and mind you all off of my life i've gone through so many so many psycho because uh psychologists and neurologists to see what's what was wrong so this is another individual that and i was tired of it because they they make you play with little puzzles to check check your intelligence and it's like okay this is a triangle could you match it up with a triangle i'm like yeah thank you like i'm fine so uh so i was i was thinking it was one of these things again so um i i go there and for and for the first time they actually got what was wrong with me and they're they were showing me you know uh really decipher discerning what was going on and and it was such a relief to know what was what was going on and and eventually i got placed into the school where they basically taught me uh junior year uh basically in the summer i learned how to read for lack of that word um see uh then i went uh finished junior year um then went to uh as a senior and then i went to college um and you know uh i actually did pretty good in college it was it was very strange i i never wrote an essay until i got in college you know my first like a good essay you know because of the essays that i would write there would be more corrections than what i wrote in high school but for some reason you know god gave me so much favor that i actually became you know pretty pretty good and i'm just saying this for the glory of god um and and nowadays you know he he placed me in a career that really works for me uh uh i just you know work in i.t and i work with uh i work with a bunch of ophthalmologists or uh eye doctors and i basically train them for like a word uh which is very different but you know like and you know it's you know i train them in different clinical applications um and you know just kind of own that department i'm just saying that for the glory of god because when it's god's time god was listening to all his prayers i remember my my mom you know god given her scriptures you know i will take care of you i will take care of your son i'll i'll take care of all this gun uh this situation and those and that trial you know uh taught taught me to be dependent on christ and many times god gives you a burden something that is constantly bothering you and that actually turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to you because now i don't rely on my intelligence i don't rely on uh figuring things that figure things out it made me to rely on unjust on revelation it made me rely on the on god it made me know that if god if if god brings a problem he he already has a solution to it and and when he opens it nobody can close it and when he opens it it's like what what you know you know all my siblings they you know they were uh they they did amazing in school like uh and now that we look back let's just say the first is the last shall be first let's just say that way because of god god's provision and i only say that's the glory of god um i i prefer not even saying that testimony because sometimes i'm embarrassed about it but um just you know like but i know but my point is irregardless of what you're dealing with god will bring you out of it you know and many times the toughest things that you go through are actually the best things that you're going through you you might you might you never liked the trial i i hated every minute of it but now i'm i i'm so grateful that he he took me aside and just said you know focus because because i didn't have anything else the only thing i did was focus on the word for the lack of that word and he did that for a purpose you know um and and and and that's that's a trauma a trauma where you think that your prayer is not being answered you think that your your work all the good things that you're doing are not being answered that is a lie of the devil the things that everything you know that you every sacrifice that you've done you've done god will will reward you for it you know i it just that's a um experience that that you know i will never forget ever you know uh you know we're i believe uh a country you know will be facing even tougher times um just look at what has happened to this this country where we if we thought it was solid before there's no confidence in anything there's no confidence in your abilities there's no confidence in going to school because you know many of you were going to school and then uh i i know many people were graduating around where corona was hitting all the jobs disappeared in two seconds you know the only thing you have is christ and when when when you rely on him for your finances you know god god will bless you coming coming to church is such a privilege if you want to be successful never take a job they'll take you out of church never that's a trap of the devil where if you like i i've seen my my dad being a pastor for years we always noticed individuals that just you know pay the tithe and never you know with any um and and took every precaution to be on church whenever the door is open because that's what the prophet said whenever the door is open that's when it's your responsibility to be in church you know uh i've youth meetings uh um in my in my uh in my church in bcf i you know like i'm a little older so sometimes i'm just like you know running out of all these kids but i'm like well the doors is open i should be there you know um so perhaps uh perhaps i'm just there to to be a influence on the young people about wherever god has me um that's where i want to be um that's that's uh well i guess i guess that's those are the kind of things i i want to share today um just just want to share my heart here and and uh just just to summarize and if you didn't get because i feel like i uh repeated myself a couple of times it's just basically being honest with oneself you know one of the things i i did that i feel like was such a benefit was i wrote down a couple of um items or things in my life that i felt that god god needed to help me with you know maybe a top ten list of um uh of things that i i needed to to be dealt with and and really bring that up to and i brought up that to the lord and say god your word says this but i don't see it lining up with my life your word says you know you know forgive one another but i have uh you know uh things i have not forgive people for you know your word says this but i i see that i can be better here and it's not your it's not your responsibility to clean yourself up it's not your responsibility to um make yourself live a christian life because remember a sheep bears wool your your responsibility is to just constantly to uh to eat the the food that god prepares for you every day read your bible pray every day deal and and just keep asking god god i see that i'm not i'm not there yet yet with this this portion of my life and god will answer those kind of things and just be sincere about it you know you know we're we're the time where you know as the prophet would would say when he was going to his third pool the prophet uh and the god told the prophet you must be more sincere if he needed to be more sincere i don't even know where he needed to be more sincere but apparently he needed to be more sincere if you want to go to your next level in christ because there's different levels in christ you have to be more sincere you have to be honest with god you have to be honest with each other you know uh as the scripture says you know confess your faults to one another like you have to be honest with where you're at and you have to be honest on where you need to be so as i feel like i shared my heart and i don't want to take any more of your your time and appreciate you just allowing me to say what i need to say here let's just uh bow our heads in the word of prayer heavenly father i'm so appreciative that even now there's still young people that want to hear the things of god i'm so appreciative that you just allow me to share my heart with them [Music] knowing that these things are so simple it's not nothing deep god nothing profound but the imp the if they would take these principles and just apply it to their lives and be serious with you god they will never falter they will never fall they will never be of course we all make mistakes and we all get outlined sometimes but they'll be solid believers they'll be the the church of they're not just the church of tomorrow but the church of today and god i just pray god that you come down and just uh help them god in their challenges because it's i i've always heard a minister say that you know this is the most polluted time many times they struggle with things but it's not even their fault god it's the time and season they find themselves in it's the environment that's so sick god it's the lack of regard to your word that this called the see a generation god makes it difficult but you give us a standard you give us a word that can make them overcomers in this life that can make them victorious that can make them live a life that is worthy of the gospel it can still be done i've seen it been done i've seen many young people live lives that are very impressive why is just because they just took the time to open up your word to read the word the message from themselves to read the bible from themselves to pray for themselves god not wait for their parents not wait for their uh even their ministry which can be is very helpful but having a personal relationship with christ is even more important god i just want you to do and a work in their lives a greater work many of them have already surrendered many of them have already gave their lives to you and but there's still more land to conquer there's still more of you to gain and god i pray that we will achieve that i pray for everybody here even myself that i can walk in higher rams in christ them not stop my uh my experience by holding to this world whether it be just you know work working too much or not focusing on whatever it is god i pray that you just bless us god with clear mind minds with clear a clear vision and just a greater dedication to your to your principles god we pray all this in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] wow i had not planned to say anything but um i truly enjoyed what our brother had to say one of the things i do want to say because with all that it was said if you don't know how to pray because prayer is very important and sometimes i know that when we pray we just say little words to the lord and we actually thank that prayer one of the things that brother enoch said was that he prayed and often times when you pray you expect immediate results and sometimes you think that because it doesn't happen as fast as you think it ought to god did not hear your prayer it kind of reminded me of saul you know when samuel told him that i'll be back just wait till i get back i'm coming and because of his impatience he began to listen to what the people around him were saying and that's what we do but instead of people we listen to devils that brings lies to us and tell us that god is not going to come back and he's not going to do this that any other but i thought about the things that he said which was which is i trust that you caught it his prayers were answered but not in the time that he expected it to be and he talked about his mother receiving word and how many times we receive word from the word somebody's preaching somebody's talking and and we hear it we receive it but it doesn't come the way we want it to come in the time that we want it to come you know my mother died not seeing me saved but she prayed for me and she believed for me and before she died she told me junior you're going to be saved god's going to save you with her natural eyes she didn't see it but by faith she claimed my salvation and even though she was gone the word of god like the prophet god said if god doesn't answer here he answered there but he answered the prayer you understand me now all of the things that we have in our lives that we have been praying for don't give up on god because god don't give up on you and uh you know it's amazing because i was looking up on some things on prayer in prayer is when you begin to worship god a lot of times we we want to ask god you know for substance give me give me give me give me but a lot of times you don't get nothing because of your protocol because of your approach to god they that come to god must first believe that he is god and that he is rewarded of them that diligently seek him you know it's like the prophet god said when you're going before the judge you don't say what's up they'll throw you right out of the of the courtroom there's a protocol there's an approach that you must approach your king he's your king he's your god so you if you've ever seen movies they they tell you how to approach a king you you approach a king with praise you give him honor you know you you just laid on thick well that's if that's in the natural what about in the spiritual you and i must learn how to worship god don't get to him like he's like an errand boy talk to him praise him glorify him let him know that the changes in you have been made because of him give honor we're honors do and then when it comes to supplication that's when you begin to get into the things that you need you know i mean you when you get into supplication you know when that anointing changes because you know a lot of times when you're glorifying god you may not feel them at that moment then all of a sudden the atmosphere changes now you're moving somewhere brother branham said prayer is not that you that god comes down to you he says prayers when you go to god and in your spirit you change it's the the dimension changes the atmosphere changes because you're leaving from the earthly cares y'all know how it is i'm saying these things because if you listen to our brother enoch he gave you a lot uh and he told you testimonies and he told you things that hindered him you know he said dialect how do you pronounce that word dyslexia i've heard that word before and i've heard people who very intelligent but they struggle with a certain area you know and reading and stuff i know a doctor who's a reader you she struggled struggle struggled and yet then years later because they thought well something wrong with they thought she was dumb something's wrong with her but i don't know in her essence she was saying things backwards you know we see t h e y and she see why e however that goes i don't know but the point is once they found that the problem she was able to go forward and that's how it is in our lives a lot of times we think other people are the problems but most of the time it's because we're not praying right the problem is in your prayer life you can't be sincere if your prayer prayer life has gone wrong right i'm just going to i'm not going to take no longer a long time because we've got other services and stuff but this is what brother branham said in in the message the supernatural he said prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of god and you're moving to then in the deepest of sincerity first it's a worship o jehovah how i love you you see it then after worship of prayer then you come with sincere heart asking see if you abide in me and my word abiding you you can ask whatsoever you will let me read this one and imma close because i don't want to take away from what he said and i appreciate everything you did say brother i understood i saw and i could see where god was trying to take us especially young people i'm not in school and i'm so glad i'm not young like you are i don't i wouldn't want to deal with what you have to deal with your your pressure and your temptations and things that you go through is far far greater than what we what i ever had to go through um even as a man of age as i am i have my struggles in this life and i would never want my to go back and never so we do understand your struggles but then there's a greater god satan is the god of this evil where age satan is but god in satan eater is still greater than god satan in his own eden see down north all things he says now see what we we what what prayer does prayer is not exactly prayer is not exactly bringing god down to to man it's bringing man up to god as for you prayer you lose uh you lose sight of these earthly things you say you you sway out into somewhere else beyond and on and on and on and on and on until you come into his presence and then a faith that you have laid it out before god see you know and he goes on to say now think about it god heard the prayer of a man and it was elijah and elijah said it's not going to rain until i call for it you see because god listens to the mortal prayer right he says now if i say this with all my truth and reverence he says with truth and reverence he said there is not another force on earth there is nothing on earth no matter what it is what kind of gift it is there's nothing in the world that would come ahead of prayer prayer is what does the work so if you're in a dilemma if you're in a place where you feel like you your back up is against the wall that's when prayer comes in and like i said prayer ain't just saying give me give me give me prayer is worship you start off in worship then you enter into uh uh the supplication and supplication is when you have humbled yourself so much so till the spirit of god can take control of you and take you from the earthly realm into the heavenly realm you stop worrying about all of the natural things you don't see those things anymore all you see is that you're in the presence of god in some way i feel like our brother enoch with all of the he testified or told me some things of how you know he was bullied and stuff like that in school because of the stand he took and how often time he wanted to quit or give up but god scott wouldn't let him do it and no matter even so you no matter how backslidden you become if you are truly of god god will bring you back you know why because somebody greater than death than the devil prayed for you and that was jesus christ himself so be encouraged uh by the words that's been spoken be encouraged i had planned to do this later but i thought if i don't connect this with what he said you might go out here and pray but if you don't pray correctly if you don't pray you know you don't think it matters it does because when that woman you know uh said thou son of david well he was not son of david to her right but when she said lord he turned and that's how god is you must approach him in the right way to get the right results you you can you hear that so understand this man has gone through what a lot of you are perhaps going through and he's sharing with you that he made it god brought him through it all of it even when he felt so alone and rejected and i know nobody likes rejection everybody wants to be accepted everybody and it's just the way god is he god wants to be accepted he's not going to make you accept him but all of us like to be part of something but sometimes god places it in place to allow us to experience what rejection is so we can understand him better you love the lord thank you brother enoch for everything you shared with us we appreciate it this is just the beginning of a great weekend and so we thank god for his grace brother tori you have anything to say but there was an altar amen and now with the experience of years of looking on down i can see that even though god didn't answer right away that all those prayers i laid on the altar through my trials and my teenagers god has constantly answered them one by one amen amen you love the lord amen where's the song leader amen we thank god for giovanni i i just uh appreciate him god bless you brother thank you for your service and thank you amen i believe we all have been blessed by the word i know i have so let us stand so we can um get into prayer let's see there is none like you [Music] [Music] [Music] is no one else can't touch my heart like you do [Music] i can search for [Music] there
