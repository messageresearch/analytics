[36:39] I pray oh Lord that you stretch forth to
[36:41] hand and be his healer
[36:45] will come back to you with testimonies
[36:47] of thanksgiving.
[36:51] Lord, look at each and every raise hand
[36:53] this morning.
[36:55] Could be a personal need or need
[36:57] representing somebody else.
[37:01] Pray Lord that you attend to each and
[37:03] every need according to the faith.
[37:08] Lord, who else could we go to but unto
[37:10] you, oh God?
[37:14] Who can heal us but you alone? Oh God,
[37:17] who can provide our needs but you, oh
[37:19] Jesus,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, we come and ask you this morning
[37:23] saying, Lord, come and have full
[37:24] preeminence in this place.
[37:29] We have submitted ourselves to you
[37:32] and we not expecting to hear from a man,
[37:34] but we're expecting to hear from you.
[37:36] God.
[37:40] I pray oh Lord that you speak through
[37:41] the speaker
[37:44] and hear through the hearer
[37:46] so that in the end of it all
[37:49] we'll be able to say our heart our
[37:50] hearts did burn within us
[37:54] as he was speaking to us and we have
[37:58] received our heart's desire
[38:01] and the mighty uncontested name of Jesus
[38:04] Christ.
[38:07] We pray believing and say amen.
[38:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Happy to be in
[38:12] the house of the Lord.
[38:16] Good to see each and everyone was able
[38:17] to press through the cold
[38:22] to come into the house of the Lord.
[38:25] I believe that there's a special
[38:27] blessing that's waiting for you.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have believed a a
[38:35] message that has benefits
[38:39] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says he has daily loaded
[38:41] us with benefits.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have to step up and claim
[38:48] those benefits because they are yours.
[38:53] Um whilst we are studying let us open
[38:54] our Bibles to the book of Luke in
[38:56] chapter one
[39:00] starting from verse 26.
[39:11] The Bible says,
[39:14] &gt;&gt; "And in the sixth month, the angel
[39:16] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[39:19] Galilee named Nazareth,
[39:27] &gt;&gt; to a virgin espouseed to a man whose
[39:29] name was Joseph of the house of David,
[39:31] and the virgin's name was Mary.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And the angel came in unto her and said,
[39:41] "Hail, thou art highly favored.
[39:49] The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[39:52] among women."
[39:54] Verse 29 reads, "And when she saw him,
[39:58] she was troubled at his saying and
[40:00] cussed in her mind what manner of
[40:02] salutation this shall be.
[40:13] For thou has found favor with God.
[40:19] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[40:21] womb,
[40:24] &gt;&gt; and bring forth a son, and shall call
[40:28] his name Jesus,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; he shall be great, and shall be called
[40:34] the son of the highest. And the Lord God
[40:36] shall give unto him the throne of his
[40:37] father David.
[40:40] Verse
[40:45] 34. And then said to Mary unto the
[40:47] angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know
[40:50] not a man?
[41:00] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[41:03] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[41:06] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[41:08] shall be called the son of God.
[41:21] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she
[41:24] has also conceived a son in her old age,
[41:26] and this is the sixth month with her,
[41:28] who was called Baron.
[41:42] For with God nothing shall be
[41:43] impossible.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "Behold, the handmade of
[41:50] the Lord, be it unto me according to thy
[41:53] word." And the angel departed from her.
[42:02] Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the
[42:03] reading of his word.
[42:06] We may take our seats. Amen.
[42:08] This uh this morning I want to speak um
[42:13] on a subject I don't intend to be too
[42:15] long.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on so be it.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; So be it.
[42:26] In the Bible where we read,
[42:30] &gt;&gt; God sent the angel Gabriel
[42:35] &gt;&gt; to Mary with news,
[42:39] &gt;&gt; with an announcement.
[42:42] The prophet of God says, "Every time you
[42:43] see Gabriel on the earth,
[42:48] it means that there is a major
[42:49] announcement that's about to be made."
[42:55] Amen. And he came with news that was
[42:57] absurd.
[43:02] Something that had never ever happened
[43:03] before.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And this was a fulfillment of the
[43:09] prophecy of Isaiah
[43:14] that a virgin shall conceive.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God tells us
[43:21] &gt;&gt; that Mary was walking prior in that
[43:25] week.
[43:28] She was walking from the synagogue
[43:31] meditating upon that prophecy.
[43:37] And she was thinking, "How is this
[43:39] possible
[43:43] that a virgin, someone who has not known
[43:45] a man will conceive?
[43:50] Little did she know
[43:53] that God was conditioning her
[43:58] &gt;&gt; to receive the promise.
[44:01] God was conditioning her
[44:04] for her to be a candidate of that
[44:06] prophecy.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it does not
[44:11] matter how much something seems
[44:12] impossible,
[44:16] you have to believe it anyways
[44:19] because it is not up to you to make it
[44:21] come to passons.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; But it is God's word, the promise itself
[44:27] that will condition you to be able to
[44:29] receive it.
[44:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when
[44:36] she heard this,
[44:38] she said, "I know it has never happened
[44:40] before,
[44:43] and I don't know how it's going to
[44:45] happen,
[44:47] but nevertheless,
[44:49] according to your word,
[44:51] let it be unto me.
[44:55] Hallelujah." In other words, she said,
[44:58] "Amen."
[45:00] Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amens, so be it.
[45:03] Amen is usually a response
[45:08] &gt;&gt; that someone gives after an utterance
[45:11] has been made
[45:15] and you are saying to that utterance
[45:19] as that utterance has mentioned
[45:23] let it be unto me. So when you are
[45:26] seated there and you are saying amen,
[45:30] it is not a word that you are just
[45:32] repeating.
[45:34] But if you are believing it within your
[45:36] heart,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; then you are saying Lord whatever you
[45:40] have said about the word
[45:43] let it be unto me
[45:46] as you have said it. I don't care how
[45:50] it's going to come.
[45:52] I'm not worried about how impossible the
[45:54] circumstance look like.
[45:58] All I know is it is going to happen
[46:01] because your word has said so.
[46:04] You remember Abraham and Sarah,
[46:07] they were given a promise that you were
[46:10] going to receive a child.
[46:13] Sarah had two things working against
[46:15] her.
[46:18] when she was barren.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Baron people don't have kids.
[46:24] She was old
[46:27] and old people don't have kids.
[46:31] So it was a double impossibility to
[46:33] herossibility.
[46:36] But because the word came from God,
[46:41] Abraham believed it.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham believed it and he said,
[46:48] "I know it is going to happen.
[46:51] How? I don't know.
[46:54] When I don't know, but I am going to
[46:57] believe it."
[46:59] And look, the promise that was given to
[47:01] Abraham and Sarah
[47:04] is the one that rejuvenated them.
[47:08] We know through the reading of the
[47:10] message
[47:12] that they were made young again.
[47:16] That's why the king of Egypt was lusting
[47:18] after Sarah.
[47:24] Why? Because she had become young again.
[47:27] What made her young again?
[47:30] It is the promise of God.
[47:33] It was conditioning her
[47:36] preparing them so they could receive
[47:39] that promise of God.
[47:42] They did not go to some hospital for
[47:44] some rejuvenation, for some
[47:50] it was the word of God that did it.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So if God gives
[47:55] you a promise,
[47:57] if the word of God tells you something,
[48:01] if you cannot do it
[48:04] and you don't have the capability,
[48:07] do not worry about that
[48:09] because it is not up to you to make it
[48:11] happen to you.
[48:15] It is the word of God. If the word of
[48:18] God said you shall be raptured,
[48:21] don't worry about how that's going to
[48:23] happen.
[48:25] But the word itself
[48:28] has enough power
[48:30] to transform this body
[48:33] to get out of this place.
[48:36] I'm just resting on that word
[48:39] because I know it has never ever failed.
[48:42] So whenever you hear the word of God,
[48:45] your response should be
[48:48] amen. Amen. Your response should be
[48:52] let it be unto me
[48:54] according to thy word. Hallelujah.
[48:57] Hallelujah.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And for you to be able to receive that
[49:00] word,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; you need faith.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Because faith is the only thing that
[49:07] does not disbelieve the word of God.
[49:13] And without faith, it is impossible to
[49:15] please God.
[49:20] But when you have that faith,
[49:23] you know, the Bible says, "If you have
[49:26] faith such as a grain of a mustard seed,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; and if you shall say to this mountain,
[49:35] &gt;&gt; be thou moved and be cast into the sea,
[49:40] that mountain has to go."
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You should not start
[49:45] worrying about how is how is how are you
[49:48] going to get the bulldozers to come and
[49:49] break down that mountain.
[49:54] The word of God has enough power to take
[49:56] it down.
[49:59] Hallelujah. Because it is the word of
[50:00] God. If we look at Hebrews chapter 11
[50:03] and verse one,
[50:07] if you can pull up the slides, please.
[50:10] The Bible says, "Now faith is the
[50:12] substance of things hoped for.
[50:18] The evidence of things not seen."
[50:23] I went to the Amplified Bible
[50:26] and this is what it says.
[50:29] Now faith is the assurance,
[50:33] the confirmation,
[50:37] the title deed.
[50:40] of things we hope for.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Being the proof
[50:47] &gt;&gt; of things we do not see
[50:50] &gt;&gt; and the conviction of their reh reality.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Faith is an
[50:58] assurance.
[51:01] It is a title deed.
[51:04] It is not an I think so.
[51:08] But it is an I know so
[51:11] because you are not looking at the
[51:13] impossibility of things.
[51:17] You are looking at the word of God.
[51:21] You are looking at God himself.
[51:24] Remember the Bible says now faith
[51:28] comes by hearing
[51:32] and by hearing the word of God.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So you hear that word
[51:40] and the word that you are hearing
[51:43] is what is going to become the faith.
[51:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When you hear
[51:50] the word of God,
[51:53] it is going to come into you
[51:56] and remember in the soul
[51:58] there can only either be faith or doubt.
[52:04] So hearing the faith,
[52:08] hearing the word
[52:10] is going to convert that word into being
[52:13] faith in your soul.
[52:17] And that faith is God.
[52:20] Because your soul can only be God or
[52:22] Satan.
[52:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why faith
[52:27] is immovable.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; So Mary believed
[52:35] the word that she heard
[52:38] because she had faith
[52:41] knowing that whatever God said,
[52:44] it is going to come to pass
[52:47] in believers. Without this, the prophet
[52:48] of God said,
[52:51] &gt;&gt; "She didn't wait till she felt life."
[52:59] If you can go to the next slide, please.
[53:03] She didn't wait till she felt life.
[53:08] She started right then testifying
[53:13] &gt;&gt; that she was going to have a baby.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As soon as God's word sinks
[53:19] in your heart,
[53:22] get up and give a testimony.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Do not wait for anything.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next slide.
[53:36] When God takes the Holy Spirit
[53:39] and brings that word to you
[53:43] &gt;&gt; and makes it alive to you,
[53:47] That's a reality. That's your faith.
[53:53] Stand up and claim it.
[53:57] You don't have to feel nothing.
[54:01] You don't have to see nothing.
[54:05] You have to believe something.
[54:08] I'm not amening myself.
[54:11] But it means so be it.
[54:15] Hallelujah.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God also said,
[54:19] &gt;&gt; "As soon as Mary said, let it be unto me
[54:23] according to thy word," that's when
[54:26] conception took place.
[54:30] Wasn't going by what she was feeling.
[54:34] She wasn't going she wasn't waiting for
[54:36] a pregnancy test,
[54:42] &gt;&gt; but she knew that the word of God
[54:46] had already brought that conception
[54:50] and immediately
[54:52] she ran to her cousin Elizabeth
[54:55] and she was already testifying,
[54:59] I shall have a baby.
[55:01] I shall name him Jesus.
[55:04] Elizabeth had been once she had that
[55:06] conception.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Elizabeth wasn't testifying. Elizabeth,
[55:12] the Bible say she hid for five months.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And she only started coming out after
[55:18] the sixth month.
[55:22] But Mary was not like that.
[55:25] She says, "All I need is a word.
[55:28] I don't need to see the baby bump.
[55:33] I don't need to start craving for things
[55:35] that I don't usually don't crave for.
[55:41] But I know God's word.
[55:44] It is enough for me.
[55:46] Hallelujah. Brother, sister, you don't
[55:48] need anything else today.
[55:52] All you need is the word of God.
[55:55] Once you hear it
[55:57] in your ears of faith, your response
[56:01] should be
[56:03] amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And once you say amen,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; that word will start working on you.
[56:10] It will in fact it will start
[56:13] conditioning you
[56:15] to receive the promise of God.
[56:18] Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In Ephesians 5 27,
[56:23] it says that he might present himself,
[56:27] a glorious church,
[56:29] not having spot or wrinkle
[56:33] or any such thing,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; but that it should be holy and without
[56:37] blemish.
[56:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am in the
[56:41] church of God this morning.
[56:44] I do not know how that is going to
[56:45] happen
[56:47] because no human is perfect.
[56:50] But I know the word says I am going to
[56:52] be uh I'm going to be glorious
[56:56] &gt;&gt; with no spot,
[56:58] &gt;&gt; no wrinkle and without any blemish.
[57:02] All I have to say is amen,
[57:05] I believe it is going to happen to you.
[57:08] As soon as I say amen,
[57:10] that exact word
[57:13] is going to start working on me.
[57:16] That's why you should always listen to
[57:18] the Bible.
[57:20] Read your Bible. Listen to the word.
[57:24] Amen. When the prophet was asked, "What
[57:25] shall I do to for me to uh what what
[57:28] should I do for me to make into the
[57:29] rapture?"
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Read your Bible and pray every
[57:34] day."
[57:36] Why? Because that word has enough power
[57:41] to change you.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so once you start eating
[57:46] it, remember they say you become what
[57:49] you eat.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Mary was carrying the word
[57:56] but we have the privilege of not just
[57:58] carrying it.
[58:00] We are supposed to become the word
[58:02] itself.
[58:05] And the more you feast on that word,
[58:09] you start working on you. You start
[58:10] growing
[58:12] and you start looking at your reflection
[58:14] of yourself.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because you
[58:19] become what you eat.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So brother, sister, whenever
[58:24] you hear the word of God,
[58:28] your response should be yes and no.
[58:31] Because that word is responsible to
[58:34] transform you
[58:38] and to make you to be able to receive
[58:40] the promise of God.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Don't wait or listen to Satan
[58:48] because Satan works on your five senses.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I've been healed,"
[58:56] &gt;&gt; but you still you still feel pain.
[59:01] If you listen to your if you listen to
[59:03] your uh senses of feeling
[59:09] you are going to get that healing to go
[59:15] because you are doubting.
[59:17] The word does not say where where there
[59:19] is doubt.
[59:22] Remember the theme of the prophet's uh
[59:24] ministry was
[59:27] only believe
[59:28] all things are possible.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Believing
[59:34] &gt;&gt; when you start believing
[59:36] you are creating an atmosphere around
[59:38] you at you are creating an atmosphere in
[59:43] your life atmosphere that can allow God
[59:46] to work in your life.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't wait.
[59:53] Don't wait for you to see the evidence.
[59:58] You just start believing.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; In I'm the resurrection and the life.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says soon as you hear
[1:00:07] the word of God
[1:00:10] that says you can be set free,
[1:00:13] he says believe it.
[1:00:16] Rejoice with it.
[1:00:18] Look at this. It says God will show the
[1:00:21] evidence after you have accepted it.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; But first you accept it.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; For you to receive your salvation.
[1:00:36] Accept it first
[1:00:38] and you will see the evidence later on.
[1:00:41] If you want the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:44] believe that you already have it
[1:00:47] and you will see God touching your life.
[1:00:50] You will see God changing your life.
[1:00:54] What you just have to do is first accept
[1:00:56] it.
[1:00:59] Christ died for sinners.
[1:01:02] I believe it. I accept it.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And I start rejoicing.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; God works righteousness by it.
[1:01:15] Amen. I believe he was striped for my
[1:01:18] healing.
[1:01:21] I believe it. I accept it.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; God's working healings in me.
[1:01:30] Just as soon as I believe it,
[1:01:33] he can't help me till I believe it.
[1:01:38] I've got to believe and confess it first
[1:01:43] and then look at this and then God's
[1:01:46] under obligation.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Obligation means you don't have an
[1:01:51] option.
[1:01:54] Obligation means you have to do it.
[1:02:00] You believe it
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; and then you confess it.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; God has no other choice
[1:02:08] but to make it happen
[1:02:11] because that's his word.
[1:02:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he has never
[1:02:16] ever failed.
[1:02:18] There's only one thing that binds God.
[1:02:23] God is bound by his word.
[1:02:26] Hallelujah. If you come
[1:02:29] and you cry, you cry all night.
[1:02:34] Amen. And you are praying for something.
[1:02:38] God has a choice
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; to either give it to you or not
[1:02:45] because remember he's sovereign.
[1:02:48] He does whatever he wants whenever he
[1:02:50] wants.
[1:02:53] So when you come, you can kneel here 48
[1:02:56] hours
[1:02:58] and cry all your tears out. Nothing
[1:03:01] wrong with it.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; But God will either do it whenever he
[1:03:05] wants to.
[1:03:11] So don't depend or rely on your tears
[1:03:16] because he can still either do it or
[1:03:17] not.
[1:03:20] But if you hold him to his word,
[1:03:25] and say Lord but you say this
[1:03:29] he has no other choice
[1:03:32] because he is bound by his word.
[1:03:35] Hallelujah. So that's why you have to
[1:03:37] confess it
[1:03:39] and believe it. Once you believe it then
[1:03:43] he is obligated to give it to you.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you want the
[1:03:49] Holy Ghost,
[1:03:51] the Bible says, "Repent and be baptized.
[1:03:55] You shall be filled with the Holy
[1:03:56] Ghost."
[1:03:58] If you do what the Bible is telling you,
[1:04:02] God has no option.
[1:04:04] He has to give it to you.
[1:04:06] Because that's what his word says.
[1:04:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His word says,
[1:04:11] "By his stripes,
[1:04:13] I was healed." So you stand there and
[1:04:16] you say, "Lord,
[1:04:17] I know you already healed me 2,000 years
[1:04:19] ago.
[1:04:21] Just give me enough grace to come and
[1:04:23] catch it
[1:04:25] because he has already done it for you.
[1:04:29] He's not going to start healing you
[1:04:30] today
[1:04:32] because he has already finished it.
[1:04:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So accept it
[1:04:38] first
[1:04:39] and then you will see the evidence
[1:04:41] later."
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And when you hear his word,
[1:04:48] say, Lord,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; let it be unto me
[1:04:52] according to your word. Just like Mary
[1:04:54] of old,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to carry the word.
[1:05:00] I want to become the word
[1:05:03] and that word who start working in you.
[1:05:07] And do not wait for don't don't wait for
[1:05:10] you to see anything first.
[1:05:14] Just believe because she heard from an
[1:05:17] angel.
[1:05:18] And an angel does not speak his own
[1:05:20] words.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; An angel does not speak his own words.
[1:05:27] An angel, he is just a messenger.
[1:05:31] He says what is just sent by God.
[1:05:35] So when you hear from an angel,
[1:05:38] you can say, "I have heard from God."
[1:05:41] When an angel visits you, you can say,
[1:05:44] "I've been visited by God."
[1:05:47] So when you are listening to the
[1:05:48] message,
[1:05:50] you are hearing from God.
[1:05:53] And when you believe the message of the
[1:05:55] hour for your day,
[1:05:59] it will start working on you.
[1:06:02] Amen. Amen. Don't wait for you to see
[1:06:04] the results.
[1:06:07] Just believe it. and God will start
[1:06:10] working in your life.
[1:06:12] God gave the children of Israel a
[1:06:14] promise.
[1:06:16] He says, "I am going to deliver you."
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And uh the prophet of God says, "And
[1:06:23] when the children of Israel was led out
[1:06:25] of Egypt,
[1:06:28] God promised to take care of them as
[1:06:30] they journeyed through the wilderness."
[1:06:38] God said he will take care of them.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And he did do it.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; No matter where the path led,
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; any enemy,
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; God in God's path, it gave way.
[1:06:54] Why? Because he had given a word
[1:06:58] going to keep them.
[1:07:00] So there was no Pharaoh's army.
[1:07:04] There's no enemy
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; that could stand in their way
[1:07:10] because they under a commission from
[1:07:11] God.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God says, I can
[1:07:16] see them come up to the Red Sea.
[1:07:19] He says, God had his map drawn out
[1:07:24] where he was going to take them.
[1:07:29] They will move right up to the Red Sea.
[1:07:32] no way at all to cross it.
[1:07:36] You know the story when they were
[1:07:38] leaving out of Egypt. They did not know
[1:07:40] where they were going. They were just
[1:07:43] following the pillar of fire
[1:07:46] by night and the cloud by day.
[1:07:51] And when they got to the Red Sea,
[1:07:54] they have the Red Sea in front of them
[1:07:57] and they have the Pharaoh's army coming
[1:07:59] from behind.
[1:08:01] They did not even know how they were
[1:08:03] going to get across.
[1:08:06] But because Moses,
[1:08:08] he knew the God he had met
[1:08:11] in the burning place
[1:08:14] and he showed him that he could never
[1:08:16] fail.
[1:08:18] That's where we we have the saying
[1:08:20] between standing between a rock and a
[1:08:22] hard place.
[1:08:29] I don't know if that translates, but
[1:08:32] that's where the statement came from.
[1:08:35] They're standing between a rock and a
[1:08:36] hard place.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; They have mountains out by the way.
[1:08:43] They have a Red Sea in front of them
[1:08:46] and Pharaoh's army pursuing after them.
[1:08:50] He says he was Pharaoh's army, the
[1:08:53] mountains on one side,
[1:08:56] Pharaoh's army here and the Red Sea in
[1:08:58] front of him.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Moses lifted up his hands.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Psalm 72 said, "God looked down.
[1:09:08] He seen the that path laying through the
[1:09:12] bottom of the sea.
[1:09:17] There was his children right there
[1:09:21] needing the promise
[1:09:24] taking God at his word.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel did not know
[1:09:28] where they were going.
[1:09:31] Cuz all they could see was just the Red
[1:09:33] Sea.
[1:09:35] But God in his providence,
[1:09:38] he already knew under the Red Sea
[1:09:42] there was a path that was laying there.
[1:09:45] and he drove them with a pillar of fire
[1:09:50] and the crowd and he brought them to the
[1:09:52] Red Sea.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; They did not know of the path
[1:09:57] but he knew of the path
[1:10:00] that was laying right at the bottom.
[1:10:03] That's why you need to take God at his
[1:10:04] word.
[1:10:06] You don't know what's in front of you.
[1:10:09] You don't know how it's going to happen,
[1:10:12] but he knows exactly why he's bringing
[1:10:14] you to that red sea.
[1:10:17] He has a path that is predestinated and
[1:10:19] ordained for you.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Corinthians, it says, "There is
[1:10:25] no temptation
[1:10:28] that is uncommon to man,
[1:10:31] for in every temptation,
[1:10:33] there is an open door.
[1:10:36] You might not see the door.
[1:10:39] But the God who has allowed that
[1:10:41] temptation to come your way,
[1:10:45] he sees the door.
[1:10:48] Just take him at his word
[1:10:50] and he will open and show you the door.
[1:10:54] He brought the children of Israel to the
[1:10:56] Red Sea
[1:10:58] and he brought them right to the path
[1:11:00] that he had there for them
[1:11:04] and he was they were taking God at his
[1:11:06] word
[1:11:08] blindly following
[1:11:10] but Moses knew that God was going to
[1:11:12] make a way
[1:11:15] himself. Moses didn't even know about
[1:11:17] the path.
[1:11:21] But God knew that if you take God at his
[1:11:24] word,
[1:11:26] he's going to bring you to that path
[1:11:29] under the Red Sea.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I like this. It says God looked down
[1:11:33] through that pit of fire
[1:11:37] and with angered eyes.
[1:11:44] And when he did, the sea got scared
[1:11:50] and moved back like that
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; and it showed up the path that was
[1:11:55] laying under
[1:11:58] Israel walked through on dry ground.
[1:12:02] That's why you need to take that's why
[1:12:04] you need to take God at his word.
[1:12:07] Hallelujah. When he looked through that
[1:12:10] pillar of fire,
[1:12:12] that sea got scared
[1:12:15] and it had to run away and separate.
[1:12:19] Chemistry tells me
[1:12:22] that you can never have water in one
[1:12:24] body
[1:12:27] and it separate to go different
[1:12:28] pathways.
[1:12:30] But God is the one who created the
[1:12:32] water.
[1:12:34] And when the water saw the angry eyes of
[1:12:36] God,
[1:12:38] It had to open up
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; a way for the children of Israel to come
[1:12:43] across.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; your problem,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; if God looks as if
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; with angry eyes,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; that problem
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; has no option
[1:12:59] than to run away.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; If you have a sickness,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; if God looks at it,
[1:13:08] angry eyes that sickness got to go.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word and say by his
[1:13:15] stripes I am healed.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And when you look at it,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; it is going to go. You can say I have an
[1:13:23] addiction,
[1:13:25] something I've been struggling with for
[1:13:26] years.
[1:13:28] It does not matter what it is.
[1:13:31] When God looks at it with his eyes,
[1:13:35] when he looks at it with his angry eyes,
[1:13:39] amen,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; it got to go.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's what his word say.
[1:13:46] Take God at his word
[1:13:48] and he will open a way for you.
[1:13:51] You might not see it, but he knows why
[1:13:55] he is bringing you where you are.
[1:13:58] That's why the song says we will
[1:14:01] understand it better by and by
[1:14:08] the children of Israel had crossed
[1:14:11] and they started rejoicing.
[1:14:14] Miriam composed new songs.
[1:14:18] But just previously they were scared.
[1:14:21] But when they saw what God had done,
[1:14:24] they started jumping for joy
[1:14:27] and they sang new songs of praise.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; They take God at his word. They took him
[1:14:35] at his word and says, "Amen.
[1:14:38] Let it be unto us. As you have said, you
[1:14:42] said we will be delivered."
[1:14:45] So I know we will be delivered.
[1:14:47] So take each and every promise that you
[1:14:49] want
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; and take God at his word. You will open
[1:14:54] that way for you and of the three Hebrew
[1:14:56] boys.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were about to be thrown
[1:15:01] into fire.
[1:15:04] Look at this. When God when God opened
[1:15:07] the Red Sea,
[1:15:09] he did not send an angel.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He did not send a wormwood.
[1:15:16] to say you are the to say you are you
[1:15:18] are the angel of uh you're the angel of
[1:15:20] floods
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; go scare the red sea
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; no he went himself
[1:15:30] he says I'mma look at it myself
[1:15:32] because my children are involved
[1:15:37] when it is you that is involved
[1:15:40] God takes personal responsibility
[1:15:44] hallelujah because that is his people.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave your fate at
[1:15:49] someone's else's hand.
[1:15:53] Look at the three three Hebrew boys.
[1:15:57] When they were right there in the
[1:15:58] furnace,
[1:15:59] the prophet of God says, "There was a
[1:16:02] conference in heaven.
[1:16:04] Hallelujah." The angel started talking
[1:16:06] and say, "Lord,
[1:16:08] send me. Let me go." He says, "No, you
[1:16:11] are not going."
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Wormwood. The angel of flood came.
[1:16:16] and say, "Lord, you know what I did in
[1:16:17] the days of Noah?
[1:16:20] I'll go and flood up
[1:16:24] that furnace
[1:16:26] and that and they won't be burned."
[1:16:29] But God says, "No, no, no, no, no.
[1:16:30] That's not your job. My children are
[1:16:33] involved.
[1:16:35] They just took a stand for me.
[1:16:38] I need to go by myself."
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So when
[1:16:43] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; when they were going to that furry
[1:16:47] furnace,
[1:16:50] I do not know what chemical reaction
[1:16:52] happened there.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; All I know is God is the greatest
[1:16:57] chemist there.
[1:17:00] And he separated the heat from the fire
[1:17:05] just for the three Hebrew boys. Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And the chains that were binding them
[1:17:13] That fire burnt it away.
[1:17:17] And the men who were behind them,
[1:17:20] pushing them in the flames
[1:17:23] are the ones that got burnt.
[1:17:26] Hallelujah. They did a retent back to
[1:17:29] send
[1:17:33] the fire that the enemy had put.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; The same fire that burned the enemy.
[1:17:40] The same Red Sea that opened for the
[1:17:42] children of Israel
[1:17:46] is the same Red Sea that covered and
[1:17:48] drowned Pharaoh's army.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when you take God at his
[1:17:54] word, he is coming personally.
[1:17:58] If he did it for the children of Israel,
[1:18:01] I know he can do it for me. If he did it
[1:18:04] for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[1:18:07] I know he can do it for me.
[1:18:10] Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Because when you take God at his word,
[1:18:15] that word is going to start working in
[1:18:16] your favor.
[1:18:19] What the enemy meant for evil,
[1:18:22] God has turned it around for my good,
[1:18:26] start believing it anyways.
[1:18:29] It's going to work later.
[1:18:32] I've already received. So today, if you
[1:18:35] have a heart desire,
[1:18:37] just claim it and believe it.
[1:18:40] and say and say I know it's already
[1:18:42] happened
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; and walk away and go
[1:18:47] walk away and go
[1:18:50] and and you can sleep
[1:18:53] don't have sleepless nights
[1:18:59] and you can say I know I know it's
[1:19:01] coming later
[1:19:03] all I just had to do was believe
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah if you are praying for a
[1:19:07] particular
[1:19:10] you've been fasting for a particular
[1:19:12] thing,
[1:19:15] believe God at his word
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; is going to follow later.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; We know of John Ryan.
[1:19:24] You know, we love to read the Old
[1:19:26] Testament
[1:19:28] to see what God has done,
[1:19:30] what he did for the for the children of
[1:19:32] Israel,
[1:19:34] for the three Hebrew boys,
[1:19:36] what he did for Daniel. And coming into
[1:19:39] the Old New Testament, what he did for
[1:19:40] Paul,
[1:19:42] releasing them from prison,
[1:19:46] but we don't serve a historical God.
[1:19:51] We serve a God that has history.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need to also know that God is
[1:19:58] something is doing something in my day
[1:20:03] cuz what is it going to help me if if if
[1:20:06] only if he only operated 2,000 years ago
[1:20:08] and he ended up.
[1:20:12] I need a God that is real.
[1:20:16] A God that can step out of the pages of
[1:20:18] the Bible.
[1:20:20] Remember that little boy who said, "I
[1:20:21] need a God that's got a skin on it.
[1:20:27] I need a God that I can touch,
[1:20:31] that I can feel,
[1:20:33] and I can see he's working day to day."
[1:20:38] Amen. Hallelujah. In our days, there is
[1:20:39] a man was called John Ryan.
[1:20:42] John Ryan. John Ryan went into the uh he
[1:20:44] went into the prayer line
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; and he was a blind man
[1:20:50] and the prophet prayed for him
[1:20:53] and he told him that you shall see
[1:20:56] and he went. So John Ryan he probably
[1:20:59] didn't know too many things about about
[1:21:01] faith and believing
[1:21:04] and he went excited.
[1:21:07] He says the prophet prayed and he told
[1:21:09] me I am going to see.
[1:21:11] Remember thus says the Lord does not
[1:21:13] fail.
[1:21:15] And he went.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Day one he's still blind.
[1:21:21] Day two he's still blind. Days keep on
[1:21:25] going. He's still blind. He's wondering
[1:21:28] but I've been prayed for.
[1:21:31] Then he goes back to the prophet
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; and he says, "But I'm still blind and
[1:21:38] the prophet of God tell him just keep on
[1:21:41] believing."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hold on to that.
[1:21:46] And when the prophet told him that and
[1:21:49] when he grasped that revelation
[1:21:52] that I'm taking God at his word,
[1:21:55] my eyes might not open right now,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; but I know it's going to happen.
[1:22:00] And he started going around and now he
[1:22:03] started telling everyone that he saw
[1:22:06] he's saying I can see
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; extra extra I can see extra extra.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; He was selling newspapers
[1:22:15] wherever he was he's selling newspapers
[1:22:16] extra extra I can see.
[1:22:19] He started confessing it
[1:22:22] before he saw the evidence of it.
[1:22:26] He said so let it be unto me.
[1:22:29] according to thy word.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; My eyes might not open this exact
[1:22:33] moment,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; but I know one day, one day they are
[1:22:37] going to open.
[1:22:38] He's selling newspapers
[1:22:41] extra, extra I can see
[1:22:45] and people word got around town
[1:22:49] and they started mocking him.
[1:22:52] So he used to be just blind,
[1:22:55] but now he's blind and crazy.
[1:23:00] We all know he is blind. He cannot see.
[1:23:02] But why is he saying I can see?
[1:23:05] That did not stop him. The more they
[1:23:08] criticized,
[1:23:09] the more he went extra extra I can see.
[1:23:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then one day he
[1:23:15] decided to visit the barber shop
[1:23:21] and he sat in that barberhop chair and
[1:23:24] the barber the barber started shaving
[1:23:26] him.
[1:23:29] And he put him that he put that apron
[1:23:30] around him
[1:23:33] and he's shaving him and he's just
[1:23:36] testifying.
[1:23:38] I can see I can see and just when half
[1:23:41] of his head was shaved,
[1:23:45] his eyes opened.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because he was
[1:23:49] believing
[1:23:51] he did not wait for the Baba to remove
[1:23:53] the airrop.
[1:23:56] He got up out of the out of the barber
[1:23:58] chair
[1:23:59] and he stormed out running
[1:24:03] and he kept on saying, "I can see. I can
[1:24:05] see."
[1:24:07] That prophecy had been made manifest.
[1:24:10] Why? Because he took God at his word
[1:24:14] and God made it happen in his life
[1:24:17] and he went around with that apron
[1:24:18] flying around saying, "I can see. I can
[1:24:20] see."
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is to show us that
[1:24:24] when you believe first
[1:24:27] those results will follow.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Look into the word. The word of God will
[1:24:35] show you exactly who you are.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's called the mirror
[1:24:40] of the word.
[1:24:42] At one point in time, there was a man
[1:24:44] who was given a spoken word book
[1:24:49] and he started reading it
[1:24:52] and he came back to the person who gave
[1:24:53] him and he said,
[1:24:57] "This book that you just gave me,
[1:24:59] he told me that I'm a buzzer
[1:25:09] and he was not happy.
[1:25:12] He was mad at that book.
[1:25:15] He says, "That book called me I'm a
[1:25:17] buzzer."
[1:25:20] That friend was surprised.
[1:25:24] He said, "Oh, really?
[1:25:27] That same book you're talking about.
[1:25:30] Jesus told me that I am I'm an eagle."
[1:25:34] They were looking at the same thing,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; but they sold different things.
[1:25:40] So the word does not change who you are.
[1:25:44] It only shows you who you are and what
[1:25:45] you are supposed to become.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says it's showing you
[1:25:50] that you are an eagle but you a buzzard
[1:25:52] but it's showing me that I am an eagle.
[1:25:57] Hallelujah. And we know eagles fly high
[1:26:02] above all doubts
[1:26:05] above all things of the earth.
[1:26:08] It is the highest flying bird there is.
[1:26:13] And when it's hunting, it goes all the
[1:26:15] way up
[1:26:18] and look straight all the way down to
[1:26:19] what he wants to get.
[1:26:24] When an eagle is fighting,
[1:26:27] it does not fight on the earth.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; It takes its prey into the air,
[1:26:35] brings it to its territory.
[1:26:39] That's why when you are fighting the
[1:26:40] devil,
[1:26:42] don't fight the devil in his territory.
[1:26:46] Bring the fight back to the word.
[1:26:50] Take him. Take take that fight back into
[1:26:53] the height of the word.
[1:26:57] Because in your territory, that's where
[1:26:58] you have victory.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see an eagle, it will take
[1:27:03] a snake all the way up.
[1:27:08] and it will drop it
[1:27:10] and it will drop it right onto a rock
[1:27:13] and it will take it back up again.
[1:27:17] Drop it back onto the rock
[1:27:19] and by the time it's taken it up and
[1:27:21] down a few times.
[1:27:25] dizzy and discombobulated
[1:27:29] and you don't know what to do and then
[1:27:31] it's just an easy kill.
[1:27:36] Hallelujah. You take the enemy,
[1:27:40] bring him into the word,
[1:27:42] fight him in the word,
[1:27:45] fight with the word of God.
[1:27:49] Jesus did the same thing.
[1:27:52] Satan tried to fight him.
[1:27:55] All the power that Jesus had,
[1:27:58] he just used the word. He just said, "It
[1:28:01] is written,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; man shall not leave vibrator alone.
[1:28:06] It is written,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,
[1:28:10] and he overcame.
[1:28:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we know we
[1:28:14] have the rock of ages.
[1:28:17] So take the enemy and drop him onto that
[1:28:19] rock.
[1:28:22] That rock defeated him before the
[1:28:23] foundation of the world.
[1:28:26] He fell down like a cloth.
[1:28:30] And on the resurrection day,
[1:28:32] that rock of ages overcame him, too.
[1:28:36] You take your enemy,
[1:28:38] hit him onto that rock of revelation,
[1:28:42] hit him onto that rock of ages,
[1:28:45] and he will be powerless before you.
[1:28:48] Amen. So take the fight.
[1:28:51] bring it into your territory
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and you will know you will win.
[1:29:00] If you want an angel to visit your home,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; you need to stay in the word.
[1:29:09] That's what Zechariah and Elizabeth did.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to go to that quote.
[1:29:16] The prophet of God says the angel
[1:29:19] the angel came to them
[1:29:23] because they were keeping the statutes
[1:29:24] of God in their house.
[1:29:28] I'll just get to it.
[1:29:33] And that angel came to a home that was a
[1:29:36] respected home.
[1:29:40] If you want angels to visit your home,
[1:29:44] be like Zachariah.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Him and Sarah Elizabeth.
[1:29:53] Elizabeth was living upright before the
[1:29:55] Lord,
[1:29:59] keeping all the statutes and all the
[1:30:01] commandments of the Lord,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; living in perfect obedience to the word
[1:30:07] in the light that they have.
[1:30:12] So in your home, if you want angels to
[1:30:15] visit your home,
[1:30:18] live upright before the Lord,
[1:30:22] keep all the statutes and his
[1:30:24] commandments.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You got to apply the token in your home.
[1:30:32] You father, you got to say we don't do
[1:30:33] this in this house.
[1:30:37] Bring a revival in your home.
[1:30:41] Stop watching all those dirty things.
[1:30:45] Angels are not going to appear in such a
[1:30:46] house.
[1:30:49] It is your responsibility
[1:30:51] responsibility
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; what comes in and out of your home
[1:30:56] because you are the gatekeeper.
[1:31:00] It is your responsibility
[1:31:03] to get into those gadgets,
[1:31:08] all those things that are being washed
[1:31:09] and not washed
[1:31:13] because angels will not come in your
[1:31:15] home.
[1:31:17] It is your responsibility
[1:31:19] to make sure that people talk right in
[1:31:22] your house,
[1:31:25] speak the right language.
[1:31:29] Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God also says the
[1:31:32] Holy Spirit is a meek
[1:31:37] day where there are fights and
[1:31:38] arguments.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; If you are constantly having fights and
[1:31:45] arguments,
[1:31:47] that's not a conducive environment for
[1:31:49] the angel of the Lord.
[1:31:53] But it's things that happen every day.
[1:31:55] If it happens, you got to make amends.
[1:32:00] So the Holy Spirit can live in your
[1:32:02] house
[1:32:03] so you can have angelic visitation.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are candidates of angelic
[1:32:11] visitation.
[1:32:14] It did not end in the Old Testament.
[1:32:19] It is supposed to be happening today.
[1:32:22] We are supposed to see it.
[1:32:25] You are not just supposed to wait to
[1:32:27] come to church to feel the presence of
[1:32:28] the Lord.
[1:32:32] You are supposed to feel the presence of
[1:32:34] your of the Lord in your house.
[1:32:38] Amen. When people come to your house,
[1:32:42] they should feel a heavy burden leaving
[1:32:44] them
[1:32:46] because they are coming in a place where
[1:32:48] angels stay.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I remember some time ago
[1:32:55] We used to fight a lot with my siblings
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and my mom would say, "Hold on.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Stop fighting.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Get out of this house. Finish your
[1:33:09] argument.
[1:33:11] Then when you are done with your
[1:33:12] argument,
[1:33:14] then come back in the house because I
[1:33:16] don't want evil spirits in my house.
[1:33:20] I want a good atmosphere in this house
[1:33:22] atmosphere." So there's a lot of people
[1:33:23] who come here with burdens
[1:33:26] and you are just trying to add to it.
[1:33:31] But then when you are arguing,
[1:33:33] you are not going to stop your argument
[1:33:35] to go outside just to finish arguing and
[1:33:36] come back.
[1:33:40] The argument is just going to end right
[1:33:41] there.
[1:33:45] If you are fighting, you're not going to
[1:33:47] be like, "Hold on. Let's go outside.
[1:33:51] Let's finish this and come back in.
[1:33:53] But but then the argument is already
[1:33:55] done.
[1:33:57] But you need to keep your house
[1:34:02] for the angel of the Lord.
[1:34:06] The angel of the Lord encampeth around
[1:34:07] those that fear him.
[1:34:10] So if he is encamping around you
[1:34:13] and you scare him away,
[1:34:17] you are scaring away your protection.
[1:34:21] You are scaring him away. But you are
[1:34:22] supposed to keep him around you
[1:34:28] so that wherever you are,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; he is with you.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; How many believe in angelic visitation?
[1:34:38] Amen. I'll end with this one one more.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The prophet of God is talking
[1:34:47] about two ladies.
[1:34:49] who came into the prayer line
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; and they got prayed for.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; It's a lengthy reading but I'll go
[1:34:56] straight through. I'll just long
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; and um
[1:35:03] he says see I have no way.
[1:35:07] He say that when I'm speaking it's not
[1:35:10] me under inspiration.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; It's not me but it's him.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire that we've seen in
[1:35:16] the picture.
[1:35:19] That pillar of fire you see here
[1:35:21] is not just a fire but it's God. That's
[1:35:25] why he said it is him. That pillar of
[1:35:28] fire that you have seen in the picture.
[1:35:30] He says that woman was told with this
[1:35:32] stomach trouble.
[1:35:37] The woman was told with the stomach
[1:35:39] trouble, thus says the Lord, you are
[1:35:41] going to be well. Go eat.
[1:35:46] Thus says the Lord does not fail.
[1:35:49] Amen. And she had come and she had in
[1:35:52] her stomach.
[1:35:54] And in the prayer line, the prophet of
[1:35:55] God tell her, "Thus says the Lord, you
[1:35:58] are going to be well.
[1:36:00] Go eat."
[1:36:02] And a woman come behind her.
[1:36:06] Had a lump on her throat,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; or you could call it a goiter.
[1:36:25] Amen. So the first woman had ousters in
[1:36:26] her stomach
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and the woman who came behind her had a
[1:36:31] goer in her a lump in her stomach
[1:36:38] and told her just the same.
[1:36:41] She was going to be healed.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; So this one with our was told that says
[1:36:45] the Lord you're going to be healed. Go
[1:36:46] eat.
[1:36:49] the one behind with a lump of throat in
[1:36:51] her
[1:36:53] was also told the same thing. You were
[1:36:55] going to be healed.
[1:36:57] The woman when she left the platform,
[1:37:01] she felt for her lump.
[1:37:05] It was still there.
[1:37:07] It didn't fall just right off.
[1:37:11] But she went off the platform rejoicing.
[1:37:16] She said, "If God could inspire that
[1:37:18] person to tell me what was in my life,
[1:37:25] I'll be destined to disbelieve that what
[1:37:27] he said wouldn't come to pass."
[1:37:33] That's right. So, she she felt it.
[1:37:38] She didn't see the evidence of it,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; but she said, "If that man
[1:37:44] see things in my life,
[1:37:47] my lamp might be still here,
[1:37:51] but I know he's going to be gone."
[1:37:54] Amen. And the woman went home.
[1:37:57] The first one at the houses,
[1:38:00] she tried to eat and every time she
[1:38:02] would eat, it would just burn her up.
[1:38:07] She couldn't do it. Weeks passed.
[1:38:12] Six weeks or more.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; She was still believing.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; She kept on she both of them kept on
[1:38:19] holding thus says the Lord.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother, sister, when you
[1:38:25] hear thus says the Lord,
[1:38:29] it is going to happen.
[1:38:31] If thus says the Lord saying you are
[1:38:32] going to be set free,
[1:38:35] I don't care how long it's going to
[1:38:36] take.
[1:38:38] I know I'm going to be set free.
[1:38:40] If thus says the Lord says I'm going to
[1:38:42] get the Holy Ghost,
[1:38:44] I don't know how long it's going to
[1:38:45] take. I know it is coming.
[1:38:49] If you are barren and thus says the Lord
[1:38:51] says you are going to have a baby
[1:38:54] and one day you will hold that baby in
[1:38:55] your arms.
[1:38:58] It may take 25 years for like for Sarah
[1:39:02] or 14 years for Rachel,
[1:39:05] but it is coming. Anyways,
[1:39:08] thus says the Lord. These two women kept
[1:39:11] on believing.
[1:39:13] Six weeks passed.
[1:39:15] They kept on believing. Amen. And one
[1:39:18] morning,
[1:39:20] the one who had als
[1:39:24] went to school
[1:39:28] and she got hungry.
[1:39:31] So before her kids went to school,
[1:39:34] she used to make she used to make food
[1:39:35] for them, breakfast.
[1:39:39] Then this day they left a lot of
[1:39:40] leftovers and they went.
[1:39:45] She kept on believing.
[1:39:47] It says, "And she picked up a little
[1:39:49] piece of toast
[1:39:52] and eat it. It didn't come back
[1:39:56] cuz every time she tried to eat
[1:39:57] something, it would be."
[1:40:01] But she thought, "That's strange." A
[1:40:05] real funny feeling came over her.
[1:40:10] So, she tried the toast. The toast
[1:40:13] didn't come out. And then she's like,
[1:40:14] "Let me eat some oats.
[1:40:17] Let me eat some oats."
[1:40:20] It didn't come out. And she drank a cup
[1:40:22] of coffee.
[1:40:26] It stayed down too. Why? She had been
[1:40:29] healed
[1:40:30] because she kept on believing.
[1:40:34] Thus says the Lord will never fail.
[1:40:37] And she was told in that prayer line,
[1:40:40] she said, "Be it unto me
[1:40:42] according to whatever the prophet has
[1:40:44] said." Because when the prophet is
[1:40:46] speaking,
[1:40:48] that's God speaking through him. So she
[1:40:50] said, "Lord, you told me I'm going to be
[1:40:52] healed.
[1:40:53] So I know I'm going to be healed. I
[1:40:55] don't know when."
[1:40:57] Six weeks later,
[1:40:59] she ate all the kids leftovers
[1:41:02] and she was completely healed.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and it stayed
[1:41:08] and why she just felt so good.
[1:41:12] She said, "I believe I'll run down and
[1:41:14] tell my neighbor."
[1:41:16] And remember the woman who was behind
[1:41:18] her who had the goiter in a in a
[1:41:22] she was her neighbor
[1:41:25] and once she got her stomach healed,
[1:41:29] she said, "I'mma run and tell my
[1:41:30] neighbor the good news
[1:41:34] just like what Mary did.
[1:41:37] is when Mary received the good news,
[1:41:40] she ran to Elizabeth.
[1:41:42] And when she got to Elizabeth, Elizabeth
[1:41:44] also had good news and they started
[1:41:46] rejoicing.
[1:41:48] And the prophet God says, "I believe
[1:41:49] I'll run down and tell my neighbor."
[1:41:51] That's what she said.
[1:41:53] And down the street, she went with a
[1:41:54] little shaw on her down there.
[1:41:59] the little woman about in her 30s.
[1:42:03] And she ran down to tell the other woman
[1:42:07] and said, "Oh, sister." She started
[1:42:10] telling her, she started telling her
[1:42:12] testimony
[1:42:14] that my ulcers are gone. My stomach
[1:42:18] trouble is gone.
[1:42:20] The food that I just ate stayed in my
[1:42:21] stomach,
[1:42:23] she says, "I'll go tell her what
[1:42:25] happened."
[1:42:26] And when she knocked at the door, she
[1:42:29] heard somebody screaming in the house.
[1:42:32] That woman where the goita was uh was
[1:42:34] was screaming
[1:42:38] and she opened the door to see what was
[1:42:40] going on
[1:42:41] and run in. And there was a woman
[1:42:44] standing before her screaming at the top
[1:42:46] of her voice.
[1:42:50] The lamp had just left her throat.
[1:42:56] In another in another sermon, the
[1:42:57] prophet of God says when she walked in,
[1:42:59] the woman who had been healed her
[1:43:03] when she walked into the woman
[1:43:05] screaming,
[1:43:08] she was busy straightening up her sheets
[1:43:10] like this.
[1:43:13] She was looking for the goiter
[1:43:16] cuz she was in bed. She was in bed. She
[1:43:20] felt for it.
[1:43:22] it is gone. She looked around. She
[1:43:26] couldn't see it. She started opening up
[1:43:29] the beding
[1:43:32] around for the goer.
[1:43:34] That lump in her neck was gone.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah. Six weeks later, thus says
[1:43:41] the Lord had happened. Amen.
[1:43:43] And they followed me over to a meeting
[1:43:45] in Chicago
[1:43:47] and stood and testified and said, "What
[1:43:49] happened, Brother Brandham?
[1:43:52] He says, "Why?" I say, "Do you not know
[1:43:54] that sometimes when you pray?"
[1:43:59] The angels of God can get to you at that
[1:44:01] time,
[1:44:04] Daniel prayed one time to 21 days
[1:44:11] before the angel could could get to him.
[1:44:14] But when God had spoke anything,
[1:44:19] it has to come to pass.
[1:44:22] That's why you need to believe the word
[1:44:23] of God.
[1:44:25] When the word of God comes into your
[1:44:27] ears
[1:44:28] with ears of faith, you said, "Let it be
[1:44:30] unto me
[1:44:32] according to thy word." Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] Hallelujah. Says, "What was it?" The
[1:44:37] angel of God knowed those people.
[1:44:41] The angel of God knowed what God had
[1:44:43] pronounced.
[1:44:46] The angels know your name.
[1:44:50] The angels know your address.
[1:44:54] They know where you live. And he says,
[1:44:56] "And he was going through that
[1:44:58] neighborhood right then,
[1:45:02] hunting them, hunting them woman up,
[1:45:06] performing what he said would come to
[1:45:08] pass.
[1:45:10] Hallelujah.
[1:45:12] Six weeks after that, says the Lord,
[1:45:15] an angel came in the neighborhood
[1:45:18] and started going door to door.
[1:45:22] Every promise that God had given,
[1:45:25] it had to come to pass.
[1:45:28] All the children of God who had believed
[1:45:29] the word of God,
[1:45:32] things start happening,
[1:45:35] they received their healing at the same
[1:45:37] time.
[1:45:39] Brother, sister, believe the word of
[1:45:40] God.
[1:45:42] He knows your address.
[1:45:45] He knows where you live.
[1:45:48] He knows where you work at.
[1:45:51] He knows where you go to school at.
[1:45:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Just keep on believing the word of God.
[1:45:59] The angels are on their way.
[1:46:03] So when you see something good happening
[1:46:05] to your neighbor,
[1:46:07] you might as well start rejoicing.
[1:46:10] See your neighbor being healed.
[1:46:13] Start rejoicing.
[1:46:16] When you see your neighbor being
[1:46:17] blessed,
[1:46:19] start rejoicing.
[1:46:22] Don't be jealousy over your brother
[1:46:25] cuz you are going to be distracted
[1:46:28] when something happens to your neighbor.
[1:46:33] jumping for joy.
[1:46:35] What does it mean?
[1:46:37] The angel is in the neighborhood.
[1:46:40] You are the next stop.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Your promise being delivered is the next
[1:46:47] stop
[1:46:49] because you are a child of God who
[1:46:52] believe the word of God
[1:46:55] who took him at his word.
[1:46:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I can tell
[1:46:59] you this morning that angels are in the
[1:47:01] building this morning.
[1:47:04] They are delivering your heart's desire.
[1:47:08] They are answering your prayer.
[1:47:11] They know where you're seated.
[1:47:14] They know your name.
[1:47:16] They know where you live.
[1:47:18] They know exactly what you prayed for.
[1:47:22] They are not going to give you someone
[1:47:23] else's blessing.
[1:47:26] give you what is yours.
[1:47:30] No one can take what is yours.
[1:47:32] What is yours?
[1:47:35] No one can take your blessing from you.
[1:47:38] Just believe the word of God and say
[1:47:41] Lord let it be unto me
[1:47:44] according to your word. If you said I
[1:47:47] will be healed,
[1:47:49] angels are bringing that healing to your
[1:47:50] doorstep.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you say, "I've been
[1:47:54] delivered."
[1:47:56] Angels are bringing deliverance to your
[1:47:58] doorstep.
[1:48:00] If you see your neighbor getting a car,
[1:48:03] start rejoicing
[1:48:05] because you are also about to be blessed
[1:48:07] with a car.
[1:48:09] Your neighbor gets blessed by God and
[1:48:11] buys a house,
[1:48:14] start rejoicing
[1:48:16] and say, "Lord, where is mine?
[1:48:19] I'm not jealous for them,
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; but I'm waiting for what you have for
[1:48:23] me. Why? The angel is in the
[1:48:25] neighborhood.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; The angels are in this place this
[1:48:31] morning.
[1:48:32] It is up to you to receive your heart's
[1:48:34] desire.
[1:48:36] It will be a foolish thing
[1:48:39] for you to leave in this place. And you
[1:48:42] don't receive your heart's desire.
[1:48:45] God has a promise. Wherever two or three
[1:48:48] are gathered in my name, he said I will
[1:48:51] be there. So I can say for sure this
[1:48:55] afternoon,
[1:48:57] God is in this place. And there are
[1:48:59] angels filling up each and every aisle.
[1:49:03] Just reach out
[1:49:05] and touch the Lord as he passes by. Say,
[1:49:08] "Pass me not a gentle savior.
[1:49:11] Say, I've waited too long.
[1:49:14] I have prayed for too long.
[1:49:16] It is time for angels to bring me my
[1:49:20] blessing.
[1:49:22] I have prayed for too long.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; It is time for angels
[1:49:27] to bring my deliverance.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You've been fighting a battle.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You don't fight a battle by yourself.
[1:49:34] Remember Elijah,
[1:49:36] there were angels filled up in the in
[1:49:38] the valley.
[1:49:40] You don't fight your own battles. He
[1:49:42] fights for you.
[1:49:44] The angels are on their way. So brother,
[1:49:47] sister this afternoon, you can start
[1:49:50] rejoicing. Let us all stand
[1:49:54] and give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:49:58] Somebody say, say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:50:01] Somebody say, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I
[1:50:04] have received my house desire."
[1:50:07] Turn around to your neighbor
[1:50:10] and say, "It is my turn." Tell your
[1:50:13] other neighbor it is my turn. And also
[1:50:17] tell them again it is your turn because
[1:50:21] the angel is in the neighborhood.
[1:50:24] Hallelujah.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Let us give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:50:30] Oh glory.
[1:50:33] Thank you Jesus.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; As we are all just getting into prayer,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; let's just sing this song and say thank
[1:50:40] you.
[1:50:42] Amen.
[1:50:43] You're not saying, "Lord, please do it
[1:50:45] for me."
[1:50:48] But you're saying, "Lord, thank you for
[1:50:50] already doing it
[1:50:52] because I have to accept it." Once I've
[1:50:55] accepted it, there's only one thing left
[1:50:59] for it to happen.
[1:51:02] And once the angels are on the doorstep,
[1:51:05] I know it's already done.
[1:51:08] So this afternoon,
[1:51:10] I want each and every one of us
[1:51:13] give God thanks.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Give God thanks for what you've been
[1:51:18] praying for.
[1:51:20] If you've been seeking the Holy Ghost,
[1:51:24] say thank you, Lord, for the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:27] Whatever you've been praying for,
[1:51:29] say thank you, Lord. I have accepted it.
[1:51:34] There's only one thing left
[1:51:36] for God to be obligated
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; to do what he said he will do in his
[1:51:41] word.
[1:51:43] Just give him thanks.
[1:51:46] Let us sing this song before we get into
[1:51:47] prayer.
[1:51:50] Thank you
[1:51:52] Lord.
[1:51:56] Oh, thank

[1:56:08] saying Lord I have accepted it.

[1:56:44] Thank you Lord
[1:56:46] for speaking to us this afternoon. Oh
[1:56:48] God,

[1:57:03] we need to say amen.
[1:57:07] We need to say let it be according unto
[1:57:10] us, according to your word, oh God.
[1:57:14] Lord, I ask you this morning, oh God,
[1:57:18] look at each and every raised hand. Oh
[1:57:20] God, look at each and every petition
[1:57:25] that your children have.
[1:57:28] They know only you can grant their
[1:57:30] hearts desires. Oh God, I stand this
[1:57:33] morning interceding for your people. Oh
[1:57:37] God, saying, Lord, I hear your people's
[1:57:40] prayers. Oh God, you said if my people
[1:57:44] who are called by my name, if they
[1:57:47] humble themselves and pray, Lord, you
[1:57:50] said you would hear from heaven. Lord, I
[1:57:53] know you are obligated to hear our
[1:57:56] hearts cry. Oh God,
[1:57:58] this morning we are not crying to anyone
[1:58:01] else, but we are crying to you because
[1:58:06] we know you are the author and the
[1:58:07] finisher of our faith. Whatever our
[1:58:10] faith has started believing on, you are
[1:58:13] the one who bring it in our hands. You
[1:58:16] are the one who bring it may be made
[1:58:18] manifest in our lives. Oh God,
[1:58:21] give us enough grace to know that you
[1:58:25] have already given us that faith and to
[1:58:28] know that you are more than able. Lord,
[1:58:31] your word tells us you are more than
[1:58:32] able to do what you said you will do. So
[1:58:35] we are standing on that word that never
[1:58:38] fails saying Lord do what you said you
[1:58:42] will do. Oh God
[1:58:45] you have never failed before and you are
[1:58:48] not going to start failing today. Lord I
[1:58:52] pray that you dispatch
[1:58:54] your host of angels oh God to come to
[1:58:58] each and every one of us's home and
[1:59:00] deliver our heart's desires. If you did
[1:59:04] it before, you can do it again. You are
[1:59:07] not a god of history.
[1:59:10] You didn't die. But Lord, we know you
[1:59:12] are still able and you are still
[1:59:15] working. You are the same yesterday,
[1:59:18] today, and forever. Oh God, and we are

[1:59:29] God. Don't pass our homes. Don't pass
[1:59:33] our loved ones. Don't pass our children.
[1:59:36] Oh God, may you visit each and every one
[1:59:39] of us in this place. Oh God, if there is
[1:59:43] someone, oh God, maybe believing for a
[1:59:46] lost loved one, I pray, oh God, that you
[1:59:50] stretch forth your hand and deliver
[1:59:53] them. Save them. Oh God, I know that's
[1:59:57] what you do best, oh God. Lord, your
[2:00:00] word tells us that you are more than
[2:00:04] willing to give us the Holy Ghost more
[2:00:06] than we wanted. Lord, I pray, oh God,
[2:00:11] make us stand in that way so we can
[2:00:14] receive that promise of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:17] Lord, there could be someone Lord who
[2:00:20] saying, "I know I've received the Holy
[2:00:21] Ghost before, but it need another
[2:00:23] refilling. I need another touch because
[2:00:27] we know you can fill us with the Holy
[2:00:29] Ghost each and every day of our lives.
[2:00:33] Lord, someone might be saying like David
[2:00:34] of old, I miss those cool waters of
[2:00:38] Bethlehem. Somebody is saying, Lord, I
[2:00:41] miss your touch of the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[2:00:45] oh father, I pray that you fill each and
[2:00:48] every soul. fill each and every heart's
[2:00:51] desire because you can do it, oh God.
[2:00:55] Oh, hear your people's prayers, oh God.
[2:00:59] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, we magnify your
[2:01:03] name.
[2:01:06] Thank you, Lord.

[2:01:13] feeling well including our pastor oh God
[2:01:18] and this anointing I pray oh Lord that

[2:01:24] visit his house in Anken

[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I felt a strong feeling in me when
[2:06:47] brother Sam came up.
[2:06:54] to give a testimony. So I told my
[2:06:55] husband,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; tell somebody.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; And then when um brother Sam read this
[2:07:03] um
[2:07:05] that he had over there
[2:07:10] and the quote said,
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; as soon as God word sink in your heart,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; get up and give a testimony.
[2:07:23] And I felt like God was speaking to me.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Um so this testimony is just to um tell
[2:07:35] somebody that whatsoever you desire just
[2:07:39] really have faith cuz God is able. He's
[2:07:42] able.

[2:07:52] leave anything now.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; So I got married in last August.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. And doing in September,
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I found out that I was pregnant
[2:08:11] and then a few week passed.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; I was talking to one of my coworker
[2:08:22] She was also pregnant,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; but she was saying that she was going to
[2:08:27] have an abortion.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And then um few weeks passed again.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; I had a miscarriage.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; It was one of the toughest moment of my
[2:08:46] life.
[2:08:49] I'm like, God, you know, other people,
[2:08:52] they're trying to have abortion. Why is
[2:08:54] this, you know, happening to me?
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Even though we didn't plan to have a
[2:09:01] baby, but it still broke my heart.
[2:09:07] Um, so time passed, months passed,
[2:09:14] my husband and I start praying for a
[2:09:16] baby.
[2:09:18] And then there was a service where
[2:09:20] brother Lee was preaching.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; The the anointing was very strong.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Um I saw my husband, he was playing
[2:09:31] instrument here. He came there and
[2:09:32] started praying with me.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; And I kept believing that God is going
[2:09:38] to give me another baby.
[2:09:43] And the crazy thing is like I wasn't
[2:09:45] even pregnant yet,
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; but people started telling my husband
[2:09:51] congratulation
[2:09:54] like is it started asking me is your
[2:09:56] wife pregnant?
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I was just shocked you know I was like
[2:10:02] okay.
[2:10:04] Um and then um a a week passed
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; uh we had uh services with brother Chosi
[2:10:15] in March last year
[2:10:19] and he kept preaching and like he gave
[2:10:21] me like his preaching gave me so much
[2:10:24] faith,
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; so much faith.
[2:10:30] And then Monday pass
[2:10:34] I took a pregnancy test.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; It was negative.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Tuesday passed.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Negative.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Negative.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Wednesday passed.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Negative.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Negative.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; And then Thursday came by.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; I took another test.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't take a test. I went to
[2:10:55] the hospital because I was feeling kind
[2:10:57] of weird.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; My hCG level was high.
[2:11:06] Yeah. Where was I?
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And I told my sister
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; and I was like, "Yeah, definitely God
[2:11:15] gave me a child. I conceived
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and then the devil started fighting me
[2:11:24] again.
[2:11:28] The same symptoms that I was feeling
[2:11:30] when I was I had the first miscarriage
[2:11:37] started coming back.
[2:11:39] But I kept saying in my heart
[2:11:42] that the battle is the Lord.
[2:11:47] And then a few weeks passed again.
[2:11:51] My apartment was almost on fire.
[2:11:56] The devil kept fighting me again
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; and I just I just call on the name of
[2:12:02] the Lord Jesus
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; and that fire was completely gone.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; And then when I was 34 weeks pregnant
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; throughout my pregnancy my blood
[2:12:19] pressure was fine.
[2:12:25] And then um when I was 34 weeks pregnant
[2:12:28] um I had a high blood pressure
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; and the doctor told me that you have to
[2:12:37] stay here and we have to monitor you
[2:12:39] throughout the whole uh the whole week.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Um I stayed the whole week in faith.
[2:12:50] Brother Brooks was praying. Sister Ruby
[2:12:52] was calling me every time to check up on
[2:12:54] me.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And then u brother Chosi had to come
[2:13:03] back again. He came back in Lington,
[2:13:05] Kentucky to preach.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; I usually don't have um the attitude to
[2:13:13] kind of listen to different preachers,
[2:13:18] but I don't anymore.
[2:13:21] that day at the hospital just I was
[2:13:23] listening to him preach again.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; I had like it gave me so much faith
[2:13:31] again
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; just to keep believing
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; throughout that service.
[2:13:40] I saw my sister in the back.
[2:13:45] anointing got her
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; and in my heart I just said that my
[2:13:49] sister's praying for me
[2:13:53] and then when we talked the following
[2:13:55] day she said yes I was praying for you.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Um I just want to thank God
[2:14:03] that the baby came out safe.
[2:14:09] encourage anybody just have faith.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; I I will probably not doubt God anymore.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; This uh experience has gave me so much
[2:14:22] faith to keep on having faith.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Despite what I go through,
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; all I just wanted to say just have
[2:14:31] faith.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord for testimony.
[2:14:40] Going to sing a song while we dis
[2:14:41] dismiss the goodness of God. I love you,
