[26:50] amen amen
[26:52] you may be seated
[26:59] if you want to know what part one was
[27:01] about
[27:04] those of you who can uh understand
[27:08] english
[27:09] i pray that you would listen
[27:12] to
[27:13] part one
[27:15] i think it's still on youtube
[27:19] um but by god's grace
[27:21] we come at a a a great time
[27:25] you know we often say
[27:28] this is a terrible time
[27:30] but in reality it's a wonderful time
[27:45] but if we would take god and his word
[27:49] that word in itself
[27:52] will build a wall of fire
[27:55] about us
[27:57] it will keep the enemy from penetrating
[27:59] our souls or our spirits
[28:04] and therefore it would give us a more
[28:06] prosperous life
[28:09] hallelujah we come at a time
[28:12] [Music]
[28:13] we understand that the seals have been
[28:15] opened
[28:17] god is not looking
[28:20] god is not looking jude
[28:22] uh for a formal church
[28:25] you need this for man he's not looking
[28:27] for systematic worship
[28:31] but god is looking for life
[28:34] and the bible tells us
[28:36] when i see the blood
[28:38] i will pass over you
[28:41] well the blood is not a literal blood
[28:44] but it is the life of god
[28:47] and brother branham calls that blood
[28:52] hallelujah it is a part of god
[28:55] that has been rotated
[28:57] off of god
[28:59] and has been weakened into your soul
[29:02] that's what god will pass over
[29:06] he'll not
[29:07] play play christians judy for papa
[29:25] like they got the holy ghost
[29:27] hallelujah he's only going to pass
[29:32] over those who's bearing god this is the
[29:34] life of christ
[29:37] the holy spirit
[29:39] hallelujah
[29:40] that is nothing but the truth
[29:44] understand me
[29:46] because i know some of y'all don't know
[29:47] me
[29:48] you don't understand me
[29:51] i don't take sides
[30:07] let me say it like this i just wanted to
[30:09] come to you i am about seeing
[30:13] what brother branham preached scripture
[30:16] live in this church
[30:18] i'm not about traditions just
[30:22] i'm not about what you feel about it
[30:26] only about
[30:28] what the word of god says
[30:30] it's supposed to be in this day
[30:34] y'all understand me
[30:36] so we can get this clear i don't know
[30:39] what what brother branham
[30:42] has spoken of this day
[30:44] i believe it with all my heart
[30:48] i'm looking for a supernatural church
[30:52] i'm looking for a church that is in his
[30:54] image
[30:58] no matter what it takes
[31:00] hallelujah i told the lord
[31:04] a few months ago
[31:06] i said god
[31:07] drew the house need cleaning la mison
[31:10] absolutely
[31:12] i don't know who
[31:14] and i don't know what
[31:30] y'all understand
[31:43] just like god is
[31:44] yours and we've got to become more
[31:47] serious about this message
[31:51] now those things were not in my notes
[31:55] but the work will be done
[31:58] luther the book is open you leave it to
[32:02] there and we see the future
[32:05] he's giving us a glimpse of the future
[32:09] brother you saw the preview of the bride
[32:15] [Music]
[32:43] hallelujah is that right and the bible
[32:46] says
[32:48] where the
[32:49] the bible says
[32:51] he whom the son is set free
[32:54] is free indeed illegally understanding
[32:57] so is we satan has no right satan
[33:02] keep you in bondage
[33:04] if you want to go free
[33:06] god said he's already made a way
[33:11] [Music]
[33:24] [Music]
[33:36] if you want to be
[33:51] no matter what he
[33:53] planned against you people
[33:55] don't worry what god says
[33:57] no
[33:58] weapon
[34:00] against you
[34:02] shall prosper
[34:04] how many of us believe that this morning
[34:06] i believe that with all of my heart
[34:09] nothing
[34:11] can stop the believers
[34:13] this day
[34:14] the book is open you leave
[34:20] [Music]
[34:30] he said i will
[34:32] give you
[34:56] [Music]
[35:32] the resurrected lord jesus is here
[35:35] he is here in his power
[35:39] he is here in the redemption power
[35:56] no matter
[36:10] are you gonna argue with him
[36:12] are you going to argue with the prophet
[36:14] of god
[36:15] he said he's here
[36:17] to see amen you understand me
[36:20] nobody's fault but your own
[36:23] if the power of god is not with you
[36:26] nobody's but your own
[36:31] and more than likely the problem is
[36:34] selfishness the problem
[36:36] of selfishness the
[36:40] [Music]
[36:47] no matter how so i want you to
[36:49] understand there is no excuse
[36:52] you can't get the holy ghost being me
[36:58] you can't get it
[37:00] you can't get the holy ghost being
[37:01] selfish without this voice
[37:03] you can't even
[37:05] you can't get the holy ghost
[37:21] we we we're not here to judge our
[37:23] neighbors
[37:26] and that judge is the word
[37:29] hallelujah and as long as we stay in the
[37:32] words
[37:33] it's not us judging it's the word
[37:48] [Music]
[38:03] discovered gold
[38:06] and he had a pet dog
[38:09] on on
[38:10] and that dog kept him safe
[38:15] all his life that dog was faithful
[38:23] and
[38:24] when the man discovered gold
[38:27] he figured he didn't need that dog no
[38:29] more
[38:43] of the holy ghost
[39:11] because the dog knew that there was a
[39:14] thief on the outside
[39:20] [Music]
[39:23] but the dog kept barking
[39:26] that's where it is with the holy ghost
[39:29] he ain't going to shut up
[39:31] until you read him from your life
[39:36] so the man got angry with the dogs
[39:43] [Music]
[39:51] that voice will continue to warn you
[39:58] [Music]
[40:04] if you don't love the holy ghost
[40:06] don't warn you anymore
[40:22] and so did the man die was he
[40:25] more because the thief came in
[40:28] killed him and
[40:30] took his gold yep
[40:32] no
[40:34] hallelujah you love the lord
[40:38] don't be dismayed
[40:40] i'm not preaching this message
[40:45] i'm preaching this message
[40:50] i'm exposing satan
[40:52] i don't know what your lives are
[40:55] but if there's any way that god can
[40:57] speak you to you this morning
[41:00] that he will
[41:02] trusting that he would grant us the
[41:04] spirit of repentance
[41:08] i don't care who's sitting next to you
[41:12] nobody can put you into heaven
[41:16] don't be ashamed
[41:18] if the holy
[41:27] hallelujah
[41:30] yes
[41:32] so amazing
[41:34] now for you coming to our text
[41:38] god said moses is dead
[41:43] but he's not talking about the message
[41:44] moses preached
[41:58] he said god will have an invincible army
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:29] and he also says
[42:31] you and i need a refilling every day
[42:38] because i have a great meal today
[42:41] maybe i'll eat a little bit of steak and
[42:43] all that kind of stuff
[42:46] but tomorrow i'm going to need to eat
[42:47] again
[42:50] and that's what how he taught his his
[42:53] disciples to pray
[42:55] is this
[43:23] out of the mouth of god
[43:28] [Music]
[43:38] something for today
