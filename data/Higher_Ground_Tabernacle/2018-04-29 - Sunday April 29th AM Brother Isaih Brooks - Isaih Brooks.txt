Oh victory today is mine aah yes Shana got behind oh let's sing it once again now we gonna sing that song one more time but I really want you to believe it you sing it like you don't believe it you sing it like oh when I wrote this morning I didn't have moved out Oh oh oh oh oh Jesus today the Holy Ghost yes it is oh the Holy Ghost yes hi oh the holy go give him another crap offering hallelujah you know the devil don't get cast out with lukewarmness you got to put some fire to it hmm let him know you mean what you say hallelujah he said I don't have that right now but Abraham seek all those things that be not as though they were hallelujah I believe when God sent Israel out to battle amen and they put all the musical instruments in front I don't believe they were singing near my god too deep amen exactly these were victory songs and when we come to church we must come with victory on our minds I don't always feel like it but when I get here I know I have I'm coming before the king and I realized tonight or this morning that he's worthy of my praise there's a lot of things I want to say to the church this morning but I think I'll say them perhaps after service we are living in the last days and however you treat God because he sees these things he sees our reasoning he sees why we do what we do there's no hiding place outside of him I find out that in the last days that we people are growing cold and they don't even see it they don't see the love of God drifting away from their hearts they approach God like religion instead of a savior as I said I said there are many people who are know him as a savior but they don't know him as a friend the Bible said God called Abraham his friend when a friend sticks closer than a brother we are in a time that you've got to battle you've got to fight one of the things that Satan is doing to this little fellowship it's basically causing discolor ship there aren't many of you who really fellowship with one another and it's a selfish thing because everybody needs somebody and when people will try to make connections with you and try to get with you you ought to try your best to get with them because people don't ask for company if they don't need it we think about I put it this way Jesus going to always keep this appointment no matter how late we are we have a tendency to my family and others come in the house of God late and expect the spirit god to move maybe we don't have the number one song leader or song leaders maybe we don't have the great instruments players but I believe with all my heart the Lord never said that we had to use instruments but he did say we had to use our voices and the Bible said make a joyful noise unto the Lord you didn't say you had the same beautifully see that's the way the world got it it's so beautiful that it's just almost enticing sometimes when you hear people sing but that's not what God get glory God gets glory if a man don't even know how to make a tune in a in a can or a bucket but it's what's coming from the heart it touches him and I feel like if we're going to be a part of this church we need to be a part of the church in every way some of y'all know why I'm not here like I said before when I'm not here it's not like I'm on a picnic or a vacation I'm always doing the work for the Lord anyhow as we stand I have a few things I need to say afterwards something I need to say but don't want to say but I will say it don't worry I'm not quitting but its issues I believe with all my heart that God has brought this church together for work but Satan knows it too and he's doing everything he can to stop it and you and I must be aware that not one of us are exempt from the attacks of Satan you and I must know that God has a plan for us and it's not just to be a church member in a assembly as this but is to be a part of the body of Christ anyway less turn as we stand to Luke seven twelve through Luke 7 will begin reading at the 12th verse now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came and touched the buyer and they that bare him stood still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead set up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother there came of fear on all and they glorified God saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that God had visited his people in this room of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region round about father let's pray we thank you Lord for your grace a diversity Lord we are in a situation here that we need your help in your guidance Lord a preacher can only do what he can do but father God you goes beyond the preacher you're the only one that can regulate the heart you're the only one that can transform you're the only one that could change us into what we ought to be father we realize that the enemy in this age is rampant the death angel is moving in such a fast because he realized that his time is almost over in this particular age I pray father God that you will help the people of God to realize their spiritual condition those of us who need an awakening those of us who need revival Lord we count upon you there's no other one we could turn to but you and Father you said if my people they which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek thy face you would turn from your weak and turn from our wicked ways you said Lord that you will come and heal the land father we need the land he'll help us here now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I trust by God's grace that the message in which I'll bring this morning would be a blessing to you personally I believe that when God sent a prophet to bring us a message the this message was the message of the resurrection but the Branham did the last sign of the resurrection when he even turned his back to the audience and began to call out people by name and their condition now when he did that you know of course the Bible tells us that will not get a greater sign in this generation outside of the sign of the Resurrection and this resurrection was to bring a revival when hiya when people saw the move of God in the days of William Branham it was supposed to be raised the dead not just naturally because he did that too but it was supposed to take those who were spiritually dead and bring them back to life you see my Jesus never preached the funeral service and in this message that should never be preached a funeral service we ought to be preaching to the living we find out when this miraculous thing took place it didn't just stay local but it started a fire and this fire Amen was rumored throughout all Judea and all the region round about there's a man in the city and he's not only healing but he's also raising the dead it is so amazing because even in this time John who was the one who introduced the Messiah and said some of his disciples to Jesus and they inquired of him and they said unto him we've been sent by John and John wants to know are you the one see you got to realize there are people in this message now that are literally turning because they're asking are you the one or should we look for another but the identification of the Resurrection had already been given Jesus didn't say let him know I'm the one but he said amen when the men will come unto Him when he said now I want to tell you something you're going to see something just watch the ministry it's not a man that's doing this thing but watch the Ministry of this man and jesus answered and said unto them go your way and tell John what things you have seen in her how did the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached understand what I'm saying here if Jesus is on the scene even in this fellowship hallelujah what's supposed to be happening hmm what's supposed to be happening the blind is supposed to be seeing the lame is supposed to walk the lepers are to be cleansed the deaf ears are to be opened hallelujah and the gospel is to be preached hallelujah because Hebrews 13 and 8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not and this bride Amen is supposed to be Amen the reflection of the resurrection resurrection supposed to be in US around us hallelujah is that right Matthew 28 he is the resurrection the Bible tells us and we know all of the stories and things we've heard of Jesus and I don't know where your Jesus is alive and not been mine is I don't know whether you've experienced the resurrection but I have and in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre I experienced something and I don't want to say it's a in that I had to counsel and let me tell you something I saw message believers act works worst then unregenerate at sinners hey it grieved me because there was no love there was no godly virtue there at all it scared me to think that people who have been in this message for so many years can behave in such a way that it made me so it literally scared me and I said to myself then who in this message really have the true Holy Ghost because I tried to correct them with the word and I was ignored and I'm still frustrated about it I was ignored I could disrespect it you name it I can go down the list as if I wasn't even there and yet these are believers it grieves me because let me tell you something saints of God it doesn't matter how much you know about what brother Branham said if you don't have what he said you must have your worship is in vain and sometimes Minoo I think about this thing I said because you gotta understand brother branham said now you've got to get the token you got to get the holy ghost hallelujah these virtues that we talked about the statue of a perfect man and that's what I said I said I said then you know I said I've never said this atmosphere I said I believe brother Browns message I believe that we ought to be exemplifying the statue of Christ right now hush for a moment in English that God be merciful that people have no discernment of the Holy Ghost and just like I told them the Holy Ghost is not here don't you know I can feel it when I come here I know when the Holy Ghost is not present I know there's sin somewhere in the camp and God is going to get you if you don't repent God will slow walk you and behold there was a great seat there should be more here but they're not and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descendant of heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and it sat upon it and his confident was like lightning and his raiment white as snow for fear of him that keepeth did shake and became as dead men and the angel said unto the woman fear not he for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He is risen ha I like that statement he is not here and that's the problem amen we we're not this is not to be a tomb we're meant to sit up here like dead bodies hallelujah but when the resurrection is in a person Amen it is the true life of car God didn't come to start another religion the probably God they wanted him to be a part of what they call the latter rain movement he said it wasn't up god and he said it would fall and it did ha because God is looking for individuals that's gonna literally give their lives to him and be walking resurrection talking resurrection living resurrections come see waylaid that's what the prophet came to do to revive the Christian to let them know after 2,000 years he's still the same he's still living hallelujah and we serve a God that's risen hallelujah amen we talk about the coming of the Lord and somehow we allowed ourselves become lazy we we seemed you know I'm in the message and you know I dress or I look like the message so I'm in the message that don't know that has nothing to do with it it's not touch not taste not hand or not hallelujah is what's in your heart hallelujah come on somebody just like I told my wife today I said I have a belief that there are those of us who purpose to come late to church why now those of us who know you can't come on time I understand that and maybe some time you need to talk to me about it so I can understand that but nevertheless we realize they meant that those things greed a mouth where am i off the word it grieves the Holy Spirit don't we care we're not battling against one another we're grieving the Holy Spirit when we don't do it right now I I'm gonna let God preach but the Bible said I would not you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep she saw not even as others which have no hope but if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him you said brother but you shouldn't say those things but let me tell you something when we go to our jobs we are on time because we know that if we don't go on time we're going to be fired this is a job this is an occupation you work for Christ you work for his kingdom for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that ye which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep I'm coming to where I'm going for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of a stark angel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord how great the same it will be if any of us miss the rapture what a shame and it won't be nobody's fault but your own hallelujah where can you find the Word of God being talked about when we have fellowship do we talk about Jesus do we talk about each other what somebody else is doing or what not they are you know but that ain't what the Bible says the Bible said comfort one another with these things that means we ought to constantly talk about the coming of the Lord let us see the condition of the world let us see the condition of the church him and y'all will understand he Zika said only those whose heart and cry after the abomination that is being done in the city will be sealed if you don't have a burden for lost souls our burden for this church other than criticism Amen you need prayer and we're we liking wouldn't it be wonderful if if we had more help around here John 11:17 you know we we must understand amen jesus is alive and well hallelujah I'm not crying out like this to be mean no sir I care for people I care for Souls I know at this hour where the pressure is placing on everybody and don't tell me you're not having a strain don't tell me you're not struggling everybody is struggling right now but in order for us to make it as a body we must pull together we must find things to do what's wrong with our phone call what's wrong with the visit hallelujah and we need to do better we say lord help us and then when God try to help you bring things to your mind you still don't do what he asked you to do help us Lord really oh hey what about Lazarus look at Lazarus and Lazarus also types out the church that was not only just a friend of Jesus that Lazarus stayed in the tomb for four days what's going to happen when Jesus you call on him and he don't answer he won't answer you because he's just keeping quiet to see what you're gonna do about it he could have called us in to messengers he Mary and Martha don't even worry about it I got it all under control but he did he was silent he said no message to Mary and Martha nothing and when God don't send a message to you in the time of your crisis what is your attitude hallelujah God a little situation die I come down to a place where it seems impossible because he wants you to know that with Christ all things are possible and he let Lazarus be there man for four days rotten and stinking according to history when they rolled back the stone they said the sticks feel the air and some people literally fainted but the truth of the matter is it doesn't matter amen how much the skin worms heat up your flesh like job says yet in my flesh shall see God you see I want you to understand this message is not supposed to be something in your head it's supposed to be in your heart and when it's in your heart you live it witness in your heart you sensitive to your brothers your scissors amen to one another and Bethany was lying to the Rouge about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother but jesus never showed up he knew where they lived but he never showed up and you say I trust God with all my heart and as soon as things don't go your way you let unbelief overtake you help us Lord God is a God that would test you is that right the gospel has been time tested there is not a servant of the Lord in the Bible that has never been tested by God no one has been exempt he said what do you mean brother Brooks do you take Joseph who was supposed to be the perfect one God tested him if you were Joseph how would you have felt when you knew that all your brothers and sisters don't like you you may even feel like that in the church where's my friend where are my friends rather where are those who would come for me and I try to talk to him sometime and then you know what they do they push me aside like I'm dirty or high you know but maybe God has chosen you to be a Joseph maybe you really are spiritual and the devil don't like you to be spiritual so he's doing everything he can do to make you carnal so God would be God then what when Joseph thought things were going well with his brother the next thing they did was throw him in the ditch how would you have felt when you in your prayer life God had revealed to you that you was going to rule some day and now you're thinking oh my god I'm in a ditch and my brothers hate me some of y'all could say man y'all's mouths are so glued but the truth of the matter is true what you're gonna do are you gonna be a just a normal Christian are you gonna be somebody Amen that that's really loving the Lord what happened I've seen people change not for the good for the worst then okay oh it's so true I love God and you and I you know I said oh god what's happening what's happening what's happening everywhere I go I see women with how his shoes and women would makeup and women with this and that and the other and I think to myself my god what is happening to the people now I'm not talking about women that need it because they got a lot of blemish problems that's not I'm talking about people who don't need it and they still put it on you think see that and how you're gonna get the Holy Ghost wearing that it's true holiness and yet dresses are so tight you just wonder how they got in them when yours when your clothes are so tight that it's just form and everything God look at that it's being naked so yo you're dressing like that is in vain Martha amen is that Alright but I know you said oh brother Brookes daddy hurting yes good it's just a little weird just a little garment just a little thing amen hat it can kill just a little thing it is the little foxes that spoil the vine huh people God didn't send us a prophet that so we can make mockery of his word absolutely not sir I'm weak I just want you to understand you know you're not fighting for the Brutes I don't have a message other than what has been given to me remember I share with the brothers the other day Jeremiah 4 and 30 amen you go there and you see God don't like these things well brother but you make it along no if you truly got it you'll live it Martha said unto them I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live hallelujah and whosoever liveth and believeth that means you gotta continue to believe in me shall never die he said believe it out this hallelujah Oh glory to God that man who was bad never knew him but when he woke up hallelujah and maybe you'd that way and then you like a dead corpse hallelujah being carried to the funeral to the graveside but all you need is one touch one touch from Jesus one touch that's all you need one word hallelujah we've got to keep focused and that's the point we've allowed Satan to to mess with our glasses and put us in a way that we we can't see God like we ought to but David was a wise man like I said the other day I said you know David was so close to God it meant that his songs became the word that his prayer became the word hallelujah search me O God y'all wanna revival search me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting there's gotta be your everyday prat search me O God not once a week search me O God Lord maybe I did something maybe I said something maybe I was in a place I shouldn't have been but father show me go down into the heart show me my wicked ways because the Bible said in manner is always right in his own eyes and let me tell you something whenever you take your thoughts or what you assume to be right over the Word of God you are in trouble when you reason the word away that's why I love Hebrews 13 and 8 he says he's the same yesterday today and forever that means what he didn't like yesterday he don't like it today and he ain't going to never like it focus that means to concentrate such a line on this thing hallelujah we need to learn Amen Lord you you're coming brother I said pray always he said every time you get a chance to pray pray Wow because we're living in such a dangerous hour hallelujah and you and I must realize him in that's where Satan is defeating us we don't pray like we hope to how are you going to keep focus without praying you forget that Jane says you look in the mirror and you forget you walk away you're looking at mirror I'm the bride I'm this I'm that and you walk away and you forget what kind of man you ought to be hallelujah there are things in men that happens in this message should never ever be spoken of it shouldn't be anybody in in a true message Church you know doing fornication and adultery and all those lust lasciviousness all those things shouldn't he be named among us yet we see that people doing it anyway and calling themselves believers and sometimes we're so fearful we'll see people doing wrong and won't even talk to him about it won't even bring a witness won't even bring it to the church and the whole time the church is dying because people have sin in their lives like a can and you wonder why your prayer life is not working let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering but he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching what's going to happen when the squeeze come on and and we can't even assemble our selves like this ain't got no piano ain't got no organ don't play the tambourine because they're gonna hear you and they're gonna find you hmm but you and I must understand that this thing has been love-motivated he was well I need the grace and the mercy God with the grace and the mercy of God is this message hallelujah God is trying to tell you what to do to be pardoned love for the better says move the mighty God not did it not hatred love God so loved the world the unlovable I was one of them till he come down and made himself flesh here on earth and dwelt among men to spit upon and miss people treated and be laughed at and made fun of and to redeem us back but if even said I came ha let take this you know people calling me holy rolling I'm tired of being this dis net me other you know and and you know I'm just as you know I might as well be like one of them now he didn't do it he sanctified himself that you and I might be sanctified Here I am stay here I stand Lord Jesus I come I come wash all my sins away take my malice take my differences away from me let me love you Lord with the pure of fervent love that all these little old things will pass away like the shocking of the day right oh brother sister if I hurt you or offended you I want you to forgive me but don't you never go back and think that I haven't told you the truth because it comes from the Word of God and you can feel finally fix your ears in such a way till you be sealed by the Antichrist see you can you can allow yourself to be stubborn you can come to a place and you don't want to hear it no more and you know what that is that's a sealing hopefully it's not any of us in here like that maybe but I'm so tired of that brother preaching on this and any other you know I hardly ever preach these kinds of messages I'm always trying to

and workups and things all right it's true I'm witnessing I'm like oh my god because you can jump in shock I don't mean no harm I love all of that but don't think that's getting you into heaven by getting you there it's gonna be a lived life not by your power his power Hey glory to God he said come back to a place to all your enemies you love with them and come shake their hands not because you all it to duty but because something in your heart says so something will make you love the bitterest enemy you've got if that isn't in your heart tonight regardless of what emotions you've had you spill outside of Christ outside of God lost alienated from God without mercy that's right won't you come and receive him on the basis of divine love shall we pray see what we fail to see is that the devil to give you religion he'll give you the emotions he'll give you everything you need amen to look like the real genuine pedigree but God's looking at the heart he's looking to see what's taken in your heart can you love your enemy can you love the most biggest person around hallelujah Oh somebody help me here because you've got to be able to love your enemy we have a problem loving our brothers and sisters how are we going to love our enemy help us Jesus oh my heart believes when I know that the people in this world and seeing this great city here amen let me he said lost engine but let me say at the moment where I think of different ones up and down they're leaning his shoulders his head over on a man's shoulder and crying said why didn't I sell my message to the red-hot Pentecostals and he went away making a mistake trying to Pat the people around and God don't let me make it see help me dear God to stand there in the valley stand with the sword in the hand granite Lord and preach the unsearchable riches of the Lord Jesus Christ telling men and women their sins are before thee unless they confess it and died to self and become born again there are alien from you God this lovely big Pentecost a full gospel group of being and women how are how all they have have received the knowledge of truth God let them walk in the truth now let them live and weed and preach and do the things that the scripture is telling them to do father I pray that if there be any here tonight outside of thee that doesn't know thee that's just been just worked up but never have been really born again they know that they haven't may they be man and woman enough tonight to accept D and come and say Lord I'll stay right here into my heart mellows down that I can be a loving friend to my enemy and I can do these things that Christ did when he was here on the earth God let them stay until the Spirit of Christ comes in and ministers and ministers and all til there's a breaking of time going down to the Father's heart wheel and in a breaking being broken up and molded over until there be one great big roll rolling love of God sweeping across the nation to an old-fashioned revival calling back to the children back to God again granite Lord see what we you know the problem God he's crying out these things because he was able to see he wasn't preaching to the world he was preaching amen to the Christians that's what he was doing he was preaching to the Christians I trust that's what I'm doing this morning baba says according to Hebrews 10 but call to remembers the former days in which after you were illuminated you and do the great fight of affliction many of us we went through things when we first got saved you know we were so in love with God you know the criticism of the world it just would bounce off of us what we could care less of what people said and you know we were just so in love with him we we were praying praying without even asked to pray you know we just wanted to talk to him you know while we were yet made a gauged stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly while you become companions of them that were so used but he had compassion of me and my bonds right and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourself that you have in heaven a better and then enduring substance Paul said not listen he said even you gave me some of your Goods even some you gave me you helped me why he didn't have much yourself but you knew Amen that you had a better place in heaven he cast not away therefore your confidence which was great which had great recompense of reward but you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God he might receive the promise see for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and we're not tearing now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not a bill who draw back unto perdition hallelujah we are not a being draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul hallelujah Paul said listen brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mouth no it's not easy it has never will be easy jesus said have you gonna follow me take up your cross and follow me it is a rocket way it is a hard way but it's a great way I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ I don't want nobody doesn't know me as nothing but a Christian y'all hear me make me over again Lord but til the Lord the other day I said God I said I feel like a failure it just seems like everywhere you go or just things are not turning out right you think you over one storm and here comes another you think certain people have been delivered and then they drop back on you god help us I can't save you you got to save yourself you got a call on God you've got to meet God in that place message how I overcome here sanctify us Lord fill us anew with the Holy Spirit may the Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts and supremely that will walk forgetting the things that are in the past the muck and the mire that we once lived in will press toward the mark of our heart calling where our lights can so shine and sweetness and humility till every passerby can say there's a Christian lives lives there on that hill that person that woman that man is a real consecrated flower of God they're so sweet and so kind always and sweet and understanding granted father let us be salty that the earth might thirst granite that's easy wasn't saying that's the whole purpose about being salty you know you know the olden days that's the way they preserve their meat they mainly salted it you know like your beef jerky and stuff you know I heard that even this morning I'm like don't you understand God wants us to be salty so if somebody wouldn't lick off of us they'd get thirsty for the same thing we are that's what God likes you saw all brother Brooks are you being too hard I'm not being hard enough I really believe that people of God something's happening to us spiritually and y'all not fighting it is a dangerous time you know people say well see that's that's the danger you know when we preach all the Lord is justified you as though you've never said in the first place people get legs laxmi they get last no matter what I did God done justified me so I'm gonna be alright that's not it was it James said if you have faith I want to see your works hallelujah and you got to put a balance to that thing Ron Paul said you don't need it but James said you do in the eyes of me and you need it in the eyes of God you don't but you and I must realize by the grace of God I don't want nobody to know me outside of being a Christian I heard a man kind of mark God well you know Jesus walked on the water he said I'd better be careful because I'm gonna get in trouble I said mm-hmm yeah you're gonna get in trouble now if you don't get in trouble with God you're gonna get in trouble with me because you say another thing right see why because you and I are here to stand as witnesses oh and I'm going to talk to this fellow you know I've asked God to give me the perfect time I'm gonna talk to him to let him know that's my god and he did walked on water what you believe it or not he did if he didn't he did it just how can he heal me the many times he healed me delivered me how he delivered me that was mind over matter that was God over matter and you and I must realize him and we've got a stand he meant for Christ somebody said well I you know I I don't know I I you know I might be foolish virgin you are foolish person if you gonna think like that in the world ain't no way in the world I'm gonna give the devil no glory in that I ain't gonna ever say no I'm not no foolish virgin first of all I don't want to miss the rapture and I do not want to go through the white throne judgment I'd let the devil take that from me God didn't call me to this message to make me foolish is this okay I'm almost done God is good but God is also a consuming fire what I'm trying to say do y'all understand what I'm trying to get to I'm trying to say if we're going to experience the resurrection of Jesus Christ in our life we must lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us we've got to get focused amen that we have been called to make a rapture and we have it it ain't just oh when I get to the rapture but the rapture suppose be seen in you every day the resurrection people supposed to see Christ in you if not by word by deed you know we didn't just this brothers there's no one of us exempt you don't have to be a preacher to have the signs following you these signs shall follow them all despises all the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering do we despise that because that's what he's been doing he has really been low suffering he has been giving good he's good to us not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance what is he saying God's been good to you but he also wants you to repent the goodness of God should lead you to repentance not God spanking you but God you've been so good to me I want to live for you lord but after thy hardness and impotent heart treasure risk up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God is that what we're going to do just let the devil make us heart hardened seeing that God has been so good to us millions and billions of people a man is going to hell never heard this message before and God has given you the opportunity to hear it and there still ain't good enough for you who were rendered to every man according to his deed to them who by patient continued in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality and eternal life how many of us are that way but unto them that are continuous and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the Jews first and also of the Gentiles but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the Gentile but there is no respecter person with God I'm a closed day my thing is I trust that something has been said now I believe with all my heart God gave me this message like all said I hope I didn't offend anyone but I did tell you the truth my thoughts is you know if if if our lives are not right if we've been slacking slow for with God you got to acknowledge it I can't I don't know all I know is that God means what he says and he says what do you mean and you and I need to examine ourselves to see whether we'd be in the faith if we're not overcome us is because you chooses not to be because God has given us the power to overcome he's given us the word to overcome overcome means you got to fight when we come don't mean it's coming are you easy it means you have to fight and if you want to overcome you got to fight yourself you got to deny yourself that God may reign hmm none of us got it easy I know I talked to the sisters and let me tell you something I know it's difficult for y'all I know y'all have a hard time oh yeah we're right into Satan's Eden with it whether the demons of lust and everything else it's raining even when you don't look at somebody they coming after you those Devils are out there and I feel sorry for the brethren really those serpent chicks out there half naked and everything else I do but do you think God equipped us in adequately God did not equipped us in adequately matter of fact Paul boast on to me said I'm more than a conqueror is that right and the Bible says greater he that is in us than he that is in the world I believe that I know that to be true in closing this morning on this portion I want to exhort you and try to encourage you that the only way you understand what I'm trying to say if you don't understand go to God in prayer I'm gonna read a couple of scriptures here now close that session a few things that I must do I think I want to read Galatians here Galatians 262 lessons the sixth chapter beginning at the first verse brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted you don't know what that means it means you know you don't go to restore somebody with the thought see you reap what you sow you're supposed to go with compassion with love and understanding bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ that means if you don't have the burden or the struggle that that individual have you bear with you pray with them until they overcome because see you yourselves can be overtaken with and by the same spirit if you don't approach it carefully that is the only way that this church should grow we must well you know you say well that's their business but I think that's exactly what Cain said to God and my brother's keeper bear with me my 4:30 just baptized a few people you know I I just believe that when a person come to Christ and say Lord I really want to be a servant you know the outward appearance was changed too that's when they know some people don't know but I can remember when I had a lot long hair yeah I mean it's hard to believe that now but I did it and you know coming to Christ was very wonderful to me but I had already made a covenant that I was never going to cut my hair well I shortly after I got saved I realized that my hair was too long so I did get it trimmed one of those old godly sisters come and say brother when you gonna get your hair cut I thought to myself I just gotta cut she said no no no no no you need to get a little you know cut a little more so I went I got a cut again that's more money I come to church I'm thinking all praise the Lord somebody else have a brother when you gonna get your hair cut I went to the barber I cut it all off then one of my friends saw me in the street my worldly friends say what does it happen to you I've never seen you look so ugly you see what the devil was trying to do make me desire to get my hair back but I never did take it back to that lake by God's grace cuz I knew it was the will of the Lord amen so here here I'm saying to you folks if God say he beautify the meek with salvation that's exactly what it says Jeremiah 430 i'ma read and when thou art spoiled or what without Duke though thou clothe thyself with chrism and those I decade the with ornaments of gold and so thou ringeth our faith with painting see because well he'll paint your face and about what it is you're not supposed to do that sisters in vain without making ourselves fair it's vanity he didn't say you weren't fair it did eat and say it wasn't gonna make you pretty but brother Bell said a woman don't make herself up to meet God they make themselves up to meet man that lover will despise thee they will seek their life so you end up with getting something that you don't want or need I thought I'd throw that out at just because I see that stuff slipping and coming in in such a way that I will not be guilty it's not one person I can make not do that but you will know it's wrong another situation I've got I'm gonna let you go and after I've done this Matthew 18 please how many y'all love the Lord I believe that I believe you do I do - are you perfect no I'm headed that way and I'm perfect in him but I want to see perfection in every way Matthew 18 beginning at the fifteenth verse moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the amount of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if the if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for afford them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst and you know there saying this I want you to understand you know brother Branham said that's the reason why so many churches are failing is because we don't follow this prescription you go to the denominational Church you go to message church everybody look at this scripture like it's the meanest thing that can be done and here the whole thing behind this is to make sure a person's soul is saved to make sure by God's grace amen that winners out of the pastor's hands when it's out of the church hands you then place that individual in the hands of God and that's what we do you said well brother was who are you speaking of you haven't seen my daughter grace here for a while I love my daughter she she's really upset with me because I had to approach her again yesterday and she called me mean things and why don't you do this to other people and let me say it like this if you all see other people doing something wrong and you do not approach them about it God will hold you responsible but that's why I read Galatians 6 and 1 you teach your brother overtaken in a fault you go to them tried to win them back right and you're going meekness you're going love when you don't do that you're breaking the word ain't about your feelings oh well I'm afraid for them that ain't what the Bible said the Bible said go to this and that's the issue that we're having among believers we're so afraid that we're gonna lose a friend at the end of the day that person is going to thank you for helping them now I talked to my daughter and I mean I'm talking to any and everybody in here fornication adultery anything of that manner that's just not right I'm not telling you what all she's doing I'm not going into detail but my point is this I'm trying to save her I love my daughter but she's not hearing others have gone to her her my wife and I have gone to her she's not hearing and she doing things that are not right so I told her yesterday as of today I'm giving her 30 days to repent get back with God and if she doesn't hear the church then we will excommunicate her until she repents that's the Bible you understand and so you understand this has been going on for years correction has been tried over and over again I believe the coming of the Lord is at hand and just like I told her I'd rather God I rather I'd rather deal with her and whoever else then to have to deal with God not just her people of God something's going on in here among us I don't know what it is but God will reveal it because whatever you're doing the dark God is going to bring it to the light and if we're gonna be a real acts 2:38 Church he said what brother Brooks you've been I've done no yes I make right I confess my sin hello you're not supposed to cover like that that's like covering for a can you know he stole those garment but I ain't gonna tell nobody you die where they can that's all I'm saying people God we can't allow this wicked stuff I don't care what it is it's about repentance and that's when you come to know who is of God and who is not these are also tragical things I'm not expecting nothing tragical to happen I'm expecting God to deal with her heart you understand me I'm expecting God to do whatever is necessary to save my daughter she's overtaken and all is well you don't love me no I'm doing it because I do love you don't have a place for revenge in my heart I don't have that comic evenness in me that I want to strike somebody down because they offended me no sir my heart no God knows my heart and I am seeking to get her saved and whoever else there's things I got on my list that I got to do and by God's grace I'm gonna do everything he's telling me to do hmm y'all must understand if I'm just standing alone I stand alone and and my point is I'm not saying what I'm saying to get anybody's approval I'm saying what I'm saying because you're the church and you need to know you understand we can't have it and we won't God in this place you make a choice we won't God I've not come this far to be lost or to be left behind and I heard brother Brennan said many of Christians all go to miss the rapture because of their families I'm sorry I'm not one of them no way I'm not one of them you love the Lord not trying to take away your joy I'm just saying I need your prayers if any of you have her phone number call her maybe you can encourage her maybe she'll know she's got friends because that's one of the reasons why she stopped coming cause there was no offense nobody want to be her friend she comes and nobody make friends nobody is interested so what happens she goes out in the world and do what she does everybody needs somebody and if you can't find friendship among your so-called believers now some people made up they don't need that they don't need friends they they like to be alone but most people are not that way I don't like being alone I love fellowship you love God people we got ministries among each other let's not fail God by not reaching out to one another when you see somebody got a frown and not a smile you love the Lord can we stand and pray before this missile father God we come before you and we thank you for your maids and Grace we pray father God that you will be merciful to us and to my daughter I pray that you would grant her repentance Satan has his anointing owner at this present time but I know log on in the depths of her heart she knows the truth and that I love him I pray father God that you break those yokes before that time come so we won't have to go that measure grant her repentance open her eyes that she may see my concerns for her soul help us now in your name Lord Jesus Christ we pray that your perfect will be done as we are dismissed father let us not give ear to gossip but may we all pray and seek your face and what to do in this matter if we could only look at her as if as though it was ourselves then our compassion for her would overflow we need one another law and if the church doesn't stand in the gap and what good is it help us now bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen just keep on praying for the Lord is not we dismiss just keep on free hear your cries for the Lord has promised and his word is true he'll answer you just keep on free all the Lord is not just keep on free he'll hear your cry for the Lord has harmed and it worries true the people fear against healing to you at the midnight hour who the Lord is not at the midnight hour hear your cry for the Lord Hedgehog and His Word is true does people forget healing to you just keep hoping yes all the Lord is and I just keep on bringing hear your cry for the Lord has time and the word is true don't keep on praying into the chamber be free ho father you've heard her cry she want to be completely changed Lord inside and out long she won't move your Holy Spirit
