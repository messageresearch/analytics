[18:18] everybody here and then by God's grace
[18:21] brother I'm sure you know my name right
[18:25] it's been a long while me man you you
[18:29] all may be seated for the cliff told us

[18:36] word or
[18:37] just tell us who you are your
[18:39] testimonial
[18:45] [Music]
[18:52] it's good to be in house Lord tonight
[18:55] hi I'm one of them that needed the grace
[18:59] of God when brother Branham said that
[19:02] the word is our defense I got to have a
[19:04] defense because I make mistakes daily I
[19:08] need the grace of God I I'm one of them
[19:12] that was raised up in a message church
[19:15] sitting on a message pew we all preached
[19:17] about cutting our teeth on the message
[19:19] pew that was me but I found out that
[19:23] being raised up in a message doesn't do
[19:25] me any good it's when that restitch
[19:26] message is raised up in you and that
[19:28] word of God comes and it begins to
[19:30] change you that's when it does something
[19:33] I was 29 years old I had quit the church
[19:39] and decided I didn't want anything to do
[19:41] with it I was gonna marry a good woman
[19:45] but didn't know anything about the
[19:47] message so she wouldn't bother me with
[19:49] it
[19:49] so that's what I did got married sit at
[19:54] home on Sundays watch cars go around in
[19:58] a circle watch men cook a little
[20:00] football around on Sundays while the
[20:03] saints of God were glorifying God at
[20:05] church I was sitting at home but one day
[20:07] my wife come home and she said who's
[20:10] brother brown and I said I don't know no
[20:14] brother Brown she said yeah you know
[20:17] that picture that your mom and dad's got
[20:18] on the wall and I said oh you mean
[20:22] brother branham and she said yeah that's
[20:23] what they said brother branham she said
[20:25] your mom said to tell me about brother
[20:27] Branham and so I talked her for a little
[20:31] bit and brother Wayne Lawson you may
[20:33] know him he came and talked to her took
[20:37] her through Daniel Malachi all the way
[20:40] through the scriptures she accepted the
[20:42] message so now I'm sitting there with
[20:44] I'm sitting there with the my worst
[20:46] nightmare was the wife going to church
[20:49] and begging me to go I resisted for a
[20:52] few years and one day I was I was buying
[20:56] houses and fixing them and selling them
[20:57] I knocked on the door of a house there
[21:01] was a preacher that lived there I was
[21:03] gonna try to buy the house
[21:05] it was a message preacher lived there
[21:07] led me to the Lord at his coffee table
[21:09] after all them years that I thought that
[21:13] God had forgot about me because I had
[21:14] forgot about him but he was still
[21:16] waiting he was still waiting for that
[21:17] one day he was still waiting for that
[21:19] one preacher and he was still waiting
[21:21] for my heart to be tenderized at a
[21:23] coffee table that's my testimony and
[21:25] sure God bless you surely appreciate the
[21:41] Lord Jesus daily John be a man we
[21:58] appreciate brother I think God for His
[22:02] grace and His mercy amen I didn't know
[22:06] which way he was gonna go I thought well
[22:08] now if you preach well praise the Lord
[22:10] [Laughter]
[22:12] but we thank God for His grace in His
[22:15] mercy
[22:16] amen you love the Lord thank you sir
[22:19] thank you that's Stan that just shows
[22:24] you you can't hide from God God got your
[22:29] number and he knows where you live amen
[22:31] amen
[22:33] so we appreciate the Lord and the song
[22:37] service brother Keith hadn't done it in
[22:40] a while but he did a good job the Lord
[22:44] really blessed and you know we
[22:46] appreciate our brother Samuel as well
[22:50] you know come out during this time of
[22:53] schooling it still comes to play so you
[22:56] know I appreciate that and all of you
[22:58] will come out on Wednesday nights a real
[23:01] blessing as we turn to 2nd John the
[23:05] first chapter 2nd John the first chapter
[23:12] I have been just bathing in the grace of
[23:16] God and we appreciate the Lord Jesus our
[23:21] brother when he first got up here he
[23:22] talked about the grace of God and you
[23:27] and I must know that you won't make it
[23:29] without the grace of God it is the grace
[23:32] of God that has brought us thus far and
[23:35] I truly thank God it'll be a second John
[23:39] please second John there's only one
[23:45] chapter of this we'll begin reading at
[23:49] the first verse of this second John the
[23:54] elder unto the elect lady and her
[23:57] children whom I love in the truth and
[24:02] not I only but also are they that have
[24:05] known the truth for the truth sake which
[24:10] dwelleth in US and shall be with us
[24:13] forever grace be with you mercy and
[24:18] peace from God the Father and from the
[24:21] Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father
[24:25] in truth and love
[24:28] love that Hebrews 10 please
[24:39] surely God is you know that the devil
[24:46] must really feel stupid at times with
[24:54] all of his efforts he may cause us to
[24:59] stumble he may cause us to fall even
[25:02] sometime crawl but he can never stop us
[25:05] all right he must feel pretty stupid and
[25:11] you know what wait till he discover that
[25:15] those who thought he was sitting to hell
[25:18] they're not there and they will never be
[25:23] there it's so amazing I marvel at him
[25:31] because for some reason he has in his
[25:34] mind that he can still outsmart God and
[25:40] that's what gets me Hebrews 10 we're
[25:44] gonna read the 38th 39th verse now the
[25:48] just shall live by faith but if any man
[25:54] draw back my soul shall not have my soul
[25:57] shall have no pleasure in him but we are
[26:02] not a bill who draw back in unto
[26:04] perdition but of them that believe to
[26:09] the saving of the soul let's pray father
[26:14] God we come before you we thank you for
[26:17] your amazing grace we thank you for
[26:20] being so good to us forgive us and
[26:24] cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness
[26:26] Lord I pray Lord this morning or this
[26:29] evening Lord God that you would break
[26:31] the yolks of the enemy open up Lord the
[26:34] revelation of your dear son Jesus Christ
[26:37] to us and father we'll be careful to
[26:40] give you the praise glory and honor in
[26:42] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[26:46] be seated
[26:50] sometimes the Holy Spirit give me word
[26:55] to speak and sometimes I'm struggling
[26:59] with what the subject would be because
[27:03] to me it just seems like I have so many
[27:07] thoughts coming through my mind
[27:09] and just when you need God the most is
[27:16] when he comes through
[27:17] I would like to entitle this message the
[27:24] revelation that is only given to the
[27:29] elect lady the revelation that is only
[27:33] given to the elect lady I think God for
[27:40] our brother Vincent we had such a
[27:42] wonderful fellowship on Sunday the word
[27:46] was extraordinarily good which is always
[27:48] good you know it makes me no different
[27:51] if a man preach and he stutters while
[27:53] he's doing it I'm enjoying it
[27:55] as long as it is the word and I would
[27:59] like to sub topic topic this message the
[28:04] faith of Jesus Christ when we look at
[28:08] this elect lady we understand by the
[28:12] message that this lady is a special lady
[28:16] this is a lady that God has already
[28:19] ordained to be bride and as John is
[28:24] writing you see by God's grace that
[28:26] she's given a lot of mercy and a lot of
[28:29] grace and most of all God wants her to
[28:32] have peace you can't have peace in God
[28:37] until you realize and recognize who you
[28:40] are in God and understand the sacrifice
[28:44] that have already been made in God's
[28:48] plan he's not writing the script as he
[28:52] goes but you and I must understand that
[28:55] this script has been written and was
[28:58] written before the foundation of the
[29:01] world God put this message or this
[29:04] word in stone he put it in the heavens
[29:07] he put it in the book what we call the
[29:10] Bible and now God has placed a fourth
[29:14] book and that is in the heart of the
[29:17] believer where God said that he will no
[29:20] longer just write it on tables of stone
[29:23] but he would write it in the fleshly
[29:26] hearts of men so you and I must
[29:29] understand that this thing that that God
[29:33] has started can never be overturned and
[29:36] the scripture says that no matter what
[29:40] it looks like all things work together
[29:43] for the good of them that love the Lord
[29:46] and those who are called according to
[29:49] the purpose of God what is faith faith
[29:53] is when you believe that is not your
[29:59] beliefs gives me that is not is not
[30:00] based upon proof it's something that you
[30:04] know that you know that you know that
[30:07] exist or that is there or that will
[30:10] happen even though you don't have any
[30:13] proof you know you say well what do you
[30:17] mean brother Brooks and believing God
[30:20] brother Branham said do you know what
[30:23] how did God make the earth this earth
[30:27] that you're sitting on this morning
[30:30] people don't want to believe in faith
[30:33] how did God make the earth he spoke it
[30:37] amen you see he spake and the world
[30:41] can't come into existence and this world
[30:44] this morning is the spoken word of God
[30:47] and he believed his own word here it is
[30:52] watch it and if God and you and you and
[30:56] offspring of him God is in you he will
[31:00] believe his own word though it can't be
[31:04] seen felt taste or anything you believe
[31:08] it see what I mean
[31:09] for God in you will believe his own word
[31:13] is that right then you don't look at
[31:17] things you see you look at things that
[31:19] God said that's why Abraham was able to
[31:24] call those things that be not as though
[31:26] they were now you and I cannot
[31:29] scientifically explain how we're going
[31:32] to make a rapture most of us can look
[31:34] within ourselves and see the thoughts
[31:37] and see the failures but if God has
[31:40] ordained you to make a rapture or a
[31:43] translation or catching away there is no
[31:47] way you can miss it you hallelujah is
[31:53] not by power is not by might but by my
[31:58] word said the Lord and you and I must
[32:00] realize that you if you and I have been
[32:05] chosen before the foundation of the
[32:08] world to be the elected lady of this
[32:11] hour
[32:12] there is no power out of hell that can
[32:16] make it a make God I'll know it because
[32:20] God never made a mistake when he chose
[32:24] you is that Alright faith is important
[32:28] the Bible said without faith is
[32:31] impossible to please God
[32:33] is that right the Prophet God tells us
[32:36] that faith is a revelation I love this
[32:40] because you cannot become you can't be
[32:43] bribed if you don't even believe that
[32:45] you are you must believe that God has
[32:48] chosen you to be bribed being bribed can
[32:51] never be guesswork it must be solid it
[32:57] must be something that has been revealed
[32:59] to you is that right come on somebody
[33:03] this message is ordained to reveal to
[33:07] the bride of Jesus Christ who she is
[33:10] is that right Mary who was a virgin did
[33:14] not know who she was but an angel came
[33:17] down and told Mary you are scriptural
[33:20] you are the very bride that God chose to
[33:24] bring forth his son hallelujah ha at the
[33:29] experience with the angel Mary knew who
[33:32] she was
[33:33] is that right it took away all fear and
[33:36] Mary didn't see no signs there was no
[33:40] wonders but the preacher the angel
[33:44] preached if I could say like that gave
[33:46] Mary the word of the call there's a
[33:50] salutation from God and from that day on
[33:53] Mary knew though she didn't feel it she
[33:57] didn't see it
[33:58] she didn't smell it she didn't taste it
[34:01] but she understood by revelation that
[34:06] she was a bride of the Virgin chosen to
[34:10] bring forth the Christ child is that
[34:13] right and the angel gave her Scripture
[34:15] and told her listen you won't even have
[34:18] the ability to name him his name will be
[34:23] called Jesus is that right
[34:27] so you said what do you mean brother
[34:28] Brooks even when God chose you most some
[34:32] of us were sinners some of us were
[34:34] church members Baptist Memphis
[34:36] presbyterian whatever you were but when
[34:39] you came to this message the angel
[34:41] change your name from church to bride
[34:46] see but faith is important to have it
[34:51] you see what I'm saying because faith is
[34:54] something that only God can give you you
[34:57] can muster it you can't fake it
[35:00] faith is something it is a revelation
[35:03] that God puts in your heart you see it
[35:06] even though you can't explain it you got
[35:09] it even though no one can see it it's
[35:12] yours because you have it and God gave
[35:15] it to you is that right it's like when
[35:18] God you say to Bob says by faith Abel
[35:21] see it was God who helped Abel it wasn't
[35:26] able intellect it wasn't because he was
[35:29] he was Adams son it was because God by
[35:33] election chose able to give him the
[35:36] revelation is that right now he gave
[35:39] kena an education
[35:42] he told Abel I mean Cain if you do what
[35:44] Abel says if you do what Abel did I'll
[35:47] grant you you know you know we I give
[35:50] you what he got he has but God knows
[35:53] those who are elected can only receive
[35:57] the revelation for there our Cain
[36:03] couldn't receive it because it wasn't
[36:05] give it to him to receive it oh yes it's
[36:08] the truth
[36:09] when God has elected you you can't stop
[36:13] seeing him if you tried hallelujah is
[36:17] that right you can be a blind man and
[36:20] see him right Amen just like it was Amen
[36:27] when Jesus came on the scene that old
[36:29] blind prophet came around he says oh I'm
[36:32] gonna see him what it was faith
[36:36] something that was revealed to him and
[36:39] though his natural eyes could not see he
[36:41] could see with the spiritual eye is that
[36:44] right and when Jesus and Mary came into
[36:47] the temple all of a sudden he saw him
[36:51] right that's what faith does it can make
[36:55] you see things that others cannot see
[36:58] hallelujah and when you can see those
[37:01] things that other people can't see it
[37:03] makes you act upon it now you can't see
[37:08] still when you see God moving no it's
[37:12] the truth the Bible said by faith Enoch
[37:16] think about it I love Enoch because the
[37:19] Bible said he was translated he pleased
[37:22] God listen you got to understand that
[37:25] Enoch lived in at a in time like this
[37:28] day wicked man
[37:32] hallelujah all kinds of perversion was
[37:36] going on in the time of Enoch and by
[37:38] faith because he was elected by God to
[37:43] see that revelation and God took that
[37:47] man and built a pyramid that even
[37:52] scientists today don't even know how it
[37:54] was built
[37:55] but I'm gonna tell you how it was built
[37:57] cuz God had the blueprint hallelujah
[38:00] just like God had the blueprint for nose
[38:02] day is that right and God gave Enoch the
[38:06] blueprint he fallen through with it and
[38:08] right now still today they say
[38:11] Christians are dumb people but we're the
[38:14] most intelligent people in the world
[38:16] because we least know that there is a
[38:19] God and we know his name hallelujah but
[38:24] you can take a man with a doctor's a
[38:26] degree of divinity or whatever and he
[38:29] still don't know God is one hallelujah
[38:33] amen but Enoch heard the voice of God
[38:36] and he walked with God and y'all heard
[38:38] me say this many times
[38:39] amen Enoch Amen you know you know she
[38:42] scripted the scriptures is silent you
[38:45] know but you got to understand those
[38:47] people lived for for hundreds of years
[38:49] and it was by word of mouth and Enoch
[38:52] had to have had a sacrifice you say
[38:57] brother what do you mean because the
[38:59] Bible said without the shedding of blood
[39:01] there is no remission of sin and in
[39:05] order for able to be rich to be remitted
[39:08] God had to there had to be a lamb
[39:11] before before Adam and Eve a man could
[39:14] be forgiven of covered there had to be a
[39:16] lamb and before Enoch could walk with
[39:19] God there had to be blood because blood
[39:23] is the only thing that covers your sin
[39:25] it is the only thing that justifies you
[39:28] before God hallelujah
[39:31] but either also had to have faith in the
[39:34] sacrifice hallelujah we didn't know job
[39:38] he men offered up sacrifice the way he
[39:43] did what he did because brother Branham
[39:45] tells us he often have sacrificed for
[39:48] his children hallelujah what was it that
[39:52] revelation if I can say like that is
[39:55] generational is that right it is an
[39:59] inheritance that God gives you and I you
[40:03] and me because of who we are
[40:05] Oh help me Lord oh god help me
[40:10] you said what do you mean William
[40:12] Brennan
[40:13] whose father was a drunk whose mother
[40:15] was a half Indian hallelujah but he was
[40:20] elected chosen before the foundation of
[40:25] the world and he received the revelation
[40:29] of who Jesus Christ was in an age of
[40:33] intellectualism and all he had was a
[40:36] seventh grade education hallelujah y'all
[40:39] better human to hell
[40:40] see because in election don't care where
[40:43] you were born who was your mother who's
[40:46] your father
[40:47] in this in this dimension somebody help
[40:51] me
[40:51] because God knows them that are here
[40:54] he'd know where you came from and he
[40:56] knows where you're going hallelujah and
[40:59] guess what he says my sheep hear is my
[41:04] voice is that right the bow said by
[41:07] faith Abel by faith Enoch by faith Noah
[41:12] found grace in the eyes of the Lord
[41:16] hallelujah you think Noah was looking
[41:19] forward no grace was looking for him
[41:22] hallelujah you wouldn't look what is
[41:25] that right brother
[41:26] grace was looking for you and God had a
[41:29] time for my brother's deliverance his
[41:34] salvation hallelujah he didn't know he
[41:36] had a gene seed in there but God knew he
[41:39] had one hallelujah but he couldn't come
[41:42] until he picked up his wife it was all
[41:46] about her brother God had to do you that
[41:51] way in order to see what I'm saying
[41:53] who can who knows the mind of God who
[41:56] knows the mind of God mm-hmm he
[42:02] outsmarts the devil with his own his own
[42:04] tricks right he thought oh I let this
[42:07] brother go out there backslide and
[42:08] everything else I'll fix him and here
[42:12] God unite she'd was seen and the dev I
[42:15] had no idea hallelujah
[42:17] is that right
[42:18] that's the way God works at hallelujah
[42:21] oh come on somebody see it's it's that
[42:26] elected elated that received the
[42:28] revelation of who she is for her day I'm
[42:31] not talking intellectually I'm talking
[42:34] about the heart because that's the Bible
[42:37] it's not to be written upon the head
[42:40] it's the heart hallelujah
[42:44] you understand me that's where the Bible
[42:46] is it's in the heart somebody help me
[42:50] here Matthew 16 says when Jesus came
[42:54] into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[42:56] asked his disciples saying who do men
[42:59] say that I the Son of Man am the whole
[43:03] whole of Israel are those who follow
[43:06] jesus knew he was a prophet even the
[43:08] Sadducees and the Pharisees knew he was
[43:11] a prophet but the problem was they
[43:13] didn't know who the Prophet was he
[43:16] wasn't just a regular prophet and that's
[43:19] what he wanted his disciples to see his
[43:22] elected lady come did he not
[43:24] he said John follow me Peter follow me
[43:27] he called them by man he brought them in
[43:29] to him
[43:30] but back directly pointing and bringing
[43:34] them is that drawing him that's how God
[43:37] did us he baptized all of the churches
[43:41] and the religious people and he found
[43:43] you and me hallelujah and he did not
[43:48] call them because they were already
[43:49] perfect hallelujah hey man Jesus look
[43:53] like he was a gangster
[43:55] nothing yeah that being sacrilegious to
[43:58] think about it he went and got the mess
[44:01] of the mess the thugs of the religious
[44:04] people tax collectors you know I'm
[44:08] saying fishermans y'all know how sailors
[44:12] are Peter what cursing wasn't some
[44:16] foreign thing from Peter Casillas are
[44:19] known to cars somebody help me here so
[44:24] he was a man with bad language bad
[44:26] temper and everything else all of them
[44:28] had something going on Holly
[44:32] and you know that's who God chose think
[44:35] about it put it in your day he was Jesus
[44:38] walking with a group of nobodies and you
[44:42] know they probably thought Luke hadn't
[44:44] lost his mind you mean to tell me you a
[44:46] physician and you go follow that man
[44:50] educated hallelujah
[44:53] think about it I'm trying to bring it to
[44:55] our day because every one of us I know
[44:58] you even myself when I when God saved me
[45:01] people thought I was out of my mind
[45:03] and you know what they were right I'm
[45:06] still crazy about Jesus hallelujah so
[45:10] you and I here goes as listen but jesus
[45:14] said I want you to know you you and
[45:17] that's the way it is now God wants you
[45:20] to know who he is
[45:21] once that revelation breaks to you oh my
[45:24] god is nothing can take it away is that
[45:30] right brother Branham said there many
[45:32] times he exhausted exhausted exhausted
[45:35] you know the mercies of God he said but
[45:39] it's grace I could never exhaust it will
[45:42] never hurt her but there are many times
[45:44] I tried the mercy but Grace has always
[45:47] been with me
[45:49] grace will always be with the Elector
[45:52] lady because she is lady elected grace
[45:55] hallelujah don't understand me grace is
[45:58] unmerited love and every one of us can
[46:01] say amen to that that God has loved us
[46:04] even when we were fallen even when we
[46:07] come short is that right even when we
[46:10] lie
[46:12] come on O God has been there and he said
[46:18] but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter
[46:21] said thou art the Christ the Son of the
[46:24] Living God and jesus answered and said
[46:27] to him blessed art thou simon barjona
[46:29] for flesh and blood have not revealed it
[46:32] unto thee but my father which is in
[46:34] heaven he understand me he took it from
[46:37] at the natural level and brought it into
[46:40] a spiritual level right because he said
[46:43] listen when he says my
[46:45] father has revealed it unto you he's
[46:47] basically saying there's a greater me
[46:51] hallelujah
[46:52] there's a part of me that is spiritual
[46:54] that gave you this revelation without
[46:57] giving you a handbook or some book to
[47:01] read you understand me you can read the
[47:03] message all you want to but if your
[47:06] father which is the Holy Ghost don't
[47:08] quicken it to you you will never see it
[47:12] there is somebody y'all better help me
[47:15] now because I feel like shouting I can
[47:17] shot the next 20-30 minutes now you know
[47:19] but we must understand having the
[47:22] revelation of Jesus Christ within you
[47:25] produces something that is supernatural
[47:29] that right that's why he said these
[47:32] signs shall follow them that believe see
[47:35] it brings a surrender and all and and
[47:39] obedience with joy you mean tell me I
[47:44] got to do this no you don't have to do
[47:47] it but I feel good when I'm obeying God
[47:50] somebody help me I feel bad when I don't
[47:53] obey it but when I know that I'm in the
[47:56] will of God and I'm feeling and I know
[47:58] that he's directing me in a certain way
[48:00] it puts a joy in my soul is that right
[48:04] and you and I must understand and all I
[48:08] believe all of us say but that ain't
[48:10] what we're working with we're working
[48:12] with making a rapture hmm see what I'm
[48:16] saying
[48:17] hey brother battle has made it clear
[48:18] everybody under this message will not
[48:20] make a rapture whoo it's obedience it's
[48:27] God who has selected you to make a
[48:30] rapture and if you have been selected to
[48:34] make this rapture you will be obedient
[48:38] y'all hear me oh come on let me break it
[48:42] down brother branham said the foolish
[48:43] virgins and the wise version five
[48:46] wise five foolish and they were cut from
[48:49] the same material there ain't enough of
[48:51] one material we cut from and that is
[48:53] this message Oh somebody found me a
[48:57] little bit
[48:58] see because Allah
[48:59] people don't understand anything because
[49:02] we know you know the message all I love
[49:05] knowing you're here won't help you it's
[49:07] knowing it here is that right oh I'm
[49:10] coming by the grace of God because you
[49:13] got to understand that's what Jim was
[49:15] saying my brethren counted joy when you
[49:18] fall into divers temptations knowing
[49:22] this that the trying of your faith
[49:24] worketh patience the trying of your
[49:27] revelation of who you are and who he is
[49:30] worketh patience is that right brother
[49:34] Brendan said when when the Lord took my
[49:36] wife and took my my son my daughter and
[49:40] took my daddy and took my mama he said
[49:43] my brother's flower was still a fresh
[49:45] only on his grave when all of these
[49:47] things were taking place and he said at
[49:49] that moment the devil came in says why
[49:51] are you following him see you don't
[49:53] preach healing and you don't did this
[49:56] and that the other hey but what about
[49:57] you huh you didn't did you know you
[50:01] don't gave him all your life but he
[50:04] don't care and he says you know what he
[50:05] sounded good he was right with his
[50:09] accusations hallelujah but something he
[50:12] said when all of the reasoning broke he
[50:17] said there was something steered there
[50:20] that's what I'm saying
[50:22] when the devil is tried to talk you out
[50:24] of this word and talk you out of Jesus
[50:26] amen something hose you hallelujah and
[50:30] that's what that his friend says bill ah
[50:34] how did you make it up you know uh I
[50:39] forgot how he said it now but anyway he
[50:41] said I didn't keep it it kept me that's
[50:44] the point this message keeps you oh
[50:50] that's that that's a lot brother when
[50:53] you see you can't go nowhere that God
[50:55] got you stuck like a magnet honey
[50:57] Oh God is that all right he said listen
[51:03] but let patience have a perfect word
[51:06] that you may be perfect and entire
[51:08] wanting nothing right I was talking with
[51:12] a brother the other day
[51:13] I say these virtues that God trying to
[51:15] develop and make us grow up into you see
[51:18] so many people in the message ain't even
[51:19] studing about the virtues you don't mean
[51:22] they said well we don't need those you
[51:24] need those in order to make a rapture
[51:27] because God is only coming back for his
[51:30] character nothing more nothing less he
[51:33] don't care nothing about whose family he
[51:35] was born into he wants you in his family
[51:38] and these virtue after your faith not to
[51:41] strip all of these and guess what
[51:43] they're going to be tempered they're
[51:44] going to be chained up challenged
[51:47] challenged they will be challenged but
[51:51] you're gonna do all God I didn't get it
[51:53] today maybe tomorrow no sir I am right I
[51:56] am the elect lady it's not by power it's
[52:01] not by mind but it's by his spirit said
[52:03] the Lord and God who started the good
[52:06] work in me shall complete it that must
[52:09] be your attitude it has to be it can't
[52:13] be war with me I'm lost
[52:14] no sir if you truly given your heart to
[52:17] the Lord
[52:17] you cannot be lost you may not be
[52:21] considered bright but you cannot be lost
[52:24] and go to hell if you really gave your
[52:26] heart to the Lord because Jesus said he
[52:29] was the man confessed with his mouth
[52:31] believe in his heart that Jesus Christ
[52:33] is Savior that becomes your salvation
[52:35] and you have passed from death unto life
[52:37] you cannot cut that scripture out
[52:43] hallelujah God amen world is perfect
[52:46] hallelujah and God will bring to pass
[52:49] everything he said that's why I believe
[52:53] I am right I may not be living it now
[52:57] but before he comes I'll be right
[53:01] hallelujah he'll make everything right
[53:06] but it's no time to be double-minded
[53:09] will I make it up will I not make it
[53:12] here's I'm brought in my bride am I not
[53:15] bride
[53:15] mi Christian what man in his right man
[53:18] mine will submit to the thought that
[53:21] he's going to hell the only
[53:26] where you can go to hell as a Christian
[53:28] is that you believe that God's blood it
[53:32] ain't good enough
[53:34] hallelujah oh oh but there's still power
[53:37] in the blood
[53:38] somebody help here here and still power
[53:40] in the blood
[53:42] call it a god and it washes away all my
[53:45] sins is that right the Bible said he the
[53:50] blood shed was done once and for all
[53:53] that means when God shed it it was what
[53:56] yo now yo before your now in your
[54:00] present your future God took care of it
[54:03] by the blood who and it's still power in
[54:07] the blood ain't no use of being
[54:10] double-minded because of your double
[54:11] minded james says you will get nothing
[54:13] from God hallelujah let's let's have had
[54:18] that one mine hallelujah let's have the
[54:21] faith of Jesus Christ come on somebody
[54:23] think about it
[54:25] description you know what the faith of
[54:26] Jesus Christ is is that was delivered
[54:30] unto the same the faith the virtues the
[54:34] character hallelujah the Lambs nature is
[54:37] that right the prophet of God said Jesus
[54:40] Christ conquered Calvary with that lamb
[54:43] nature of sweetness and meekness
[54:47] hallelujah you and I you are all ER when
[54:50] you fuss you out of order when you argue
[54:53] you are the order when you scream and
[54:56] holler that's what the devil wants us to
[54:59] do hallelujah because it takes you out
[55:03] of the leaves nature and when that lives
[55:06] nature is out of you God pulls back
[55:10] hallelujah because the dog can only
[55:12] fellowship with the lamb hallelujah and
[55:15] so you and I must understand he meant
[55:18] that that nature in order for us to grow
[55:20] you got to be like Jesus when they
[55:25] railed him and mocked him and calling
[55:28] him and whatever they did he kept his
[55:30] mouth shut don't open your mouth never
[55:36] say say this don't say it the devil say
[55:39] do this don't do
[55:40] good walk away keep it shut because God
[55:46] is working on his building and that
[55:49] building is you think about it he they
[55:56] whipped him all night long for you and I
[55:59] for you and me is that right they
[56:01] whipped him and he didn't say a mumbling
[56:04] word he could have cost him all I had to
[56:08] do was move his finger like the Prophet
[56:10] said ten thousand eight it was about him
[56:13] but it was written of him not to open
[56:16] his mouth like a dumb sheep he allowed
[56:20] himself to be sheared by because the
[56:23] nature of God was in him and God
[56:26] believed his word and God obeys his word
[56:29] and no matter what God's Word must be
[56:33] obeyed it must become living Paul said
[56:36] with living epistles written in read of
[56:38] all men this message must be lived has
[56:43] to be lived and God has chosen you and
[56:46] me to live it so let's just die die to
[56:52] ourselves you gotta say god help me Lord
[56:56] yeah you say Lord whaat even Jesus when
[57:01] he got to a place where he seemed like
[57:02] he couldn't go any further he said Lord
[57:05] why his doubt forsaken me is that right
[57:09] because see brother branham said like
[57:11] this he said Jesus went the Calvary as a
[57:13] man he didn't go as God he went as a man
[57:17] because of you and me hallelujah he
[57:21] bared our suffering he bared our
[57:23] friction when they slapped him he
[57:25] slapped us when they cursed him they
[57:28] cursed us what are you saying if his
[57:31] nature is in you you can endure it you
[57:36] understand me it's proof it is proven
[57:39] already tested it won the victory it
[57:43] killed him he rose from the dead
[57:46] hallelujah he took that blood and he
[57:50] will
[57:50] I ended up in to help him come home and
[57:52] what did the angel say when he went to
[57:56] the gates when he says Oh gates be
[58:01] lifted up because the king of glory he
[58:07] whooped the devil he went the hella me
[58:11] whip the devil for you and me and he
[58:14] carried the purchaser prize that blood
[58:17] back up then says here it is this is the
[58:20] power in which I won the battle but was
[58:26] it it was the life of God Satan didn't
[58:28] understand it he wasn't just a man but
[58:31] the Bible said in him brought the
[58:33] fullness of the Godhead bodily in Christ
[58:36] Oh God dwelt the fullness of the Godhead
[58:40] in him is that right
[58:44] then brother branham comes along said
[58:46] all that was in God he poured it into
[58:48] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[58:51] it into his church his bride that means
[58:54] a very life of Christ supposed to be on
[58:56] display hallelujah Paul had it so much
[59:03] so when the sons of Skiba tried to mimic
[59:06] Christianity hallelujah what happened to
[59:09] them they were filled with Devils but
[59:11] they said Paul I know Peter I know but
[59:15] who are you see but when you got the
[59:19] life of God in you amen even the devil
[59:21] know you know you by name and if the
[59:24] devil know you by name Jesus know you by
[59:26] name it's just okay here coming from the
[59:33] message scape here to come hither he
[59:35] says all but brother God always have
[59:39] indicates himself by being in the camp
[59:41] with supernatural signs and wonders God
[59:45] always make himself known
[59:46] he's supernatural and he cannot be
[59:50] anything or work anyway but through
[59:53] supernatural do you see it oh how I just
[59:57] love it
[59:58] now he said show me a miracle here's the
[1:00:01] first one in my life
[1:00:04] me that's how I know God lives he
[1:00:09] changed me and I know if he changed me
[1:00:14] he can change somebody else but this is
[1:00:17] a miracle I'm a walking talking miracle
[1:00:21] and so are you if you don't have no
[1:00:23] other testimony that one will always
[1:00:26] work
[1:00:27] hey man why because it was Christ who
[1:00:31] changed you you couldn't have changed
[1:00:33] yourself
[1:00:34] no man can add one cubit to his statue
[1:00:36] hmm hallelujah God electing you chose
[1:00:41] choosing you to receive this revelation
[1:00:45] of this hour look what he went through
[1:00:47] to get it to you hmm he hid it in a
[1:00:51] seventh grade seventh grade educated
[1:00:54] prophet Kentuckian prophet hallelujah he
[1:00:58] didn't have the Boston accent or the New
[1:01:00] York accent he had the Kentucky accent
[1:01:04] hallelujah and you know God hid that in
[1:01:08] simplicity ha because he came into an
[1:01:11] intellectual age God hid it in a dumb
[1:01:15] man I hope you don't mind me saying that
[1:01:18] but the problem the truth of the matter
[1:01:20] was God took that man and outshine every
[1:01:25] preacher of his day nobody could touch
[1:01:28] him why because he had God failed on the
[1:01:31] inside but it wasn't just him God
[1:01:34] brought that same anointing back to the
[1:01:37] bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah that's
[1:01:41] right as God was mainly the Prophet God
[1:01:43] was to be veiled in his bride Oh
[1:01:47] somebody help me here whew you know the
[1:01:54] Lord he said I want you to notice from
[1:01:58] Cain lineage was religious and he was
[1:02:00] just as religious as Abel was he was
[1:02:03] just as sincere as Abel was he was just
[1:02:05] as fundamental as Abel was but there
[1:02:08] went but here where the difference was
[1:02:11] he didn't have the revelation see that's
[1:02:15] been it all alone Jesus cry
[1:02:17] I said in Matthew 16 when he came down
[1:02:21] from the Mount of Transfiguration I
[1:02:23] believe it was and he said who does man
[1:02:25] say I the Son of Man a.m.
[1:02:30] hallelujah that is the revelation not in
[1:02:35] a 2000 year ago Jesus for the Jesus of
[1:02:39] today he's just in a different body but
[1:02:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:45] forever he cannot change that's what I
[1:02:49] love about God hallelujah he's
[1:02:52] identified by his word whatever he said
[1:02:55] yesterday he means it today and it will
[1:02:59] always be the same hallelujah
[1:03:02] and if they got the Holy Ghost yesterday
[1:03:05] you can that meet you in the air today
[1:03:06] and how you know you got the Holy Ghost
[1:03:08] cuz in a bring a change hmm come on
[1:03:13] somebody is like turning on the light
[1:03:14] switch the Bob is there you can't see
[1:03:17] nothing but the BA but turn that light
[1:03:20] on then you see the supernatural
[1:03:22] hallelujah and that's how God is
[1:03:24] hallelujah once the light is turned on
[1:03:27] in you it would draw people will be able
[1:03:30] to see it you don't have to wear it they
[1:03:33] will see it not like something wrong
[1:03:35] with wearing it hallelujah but it is God
[1:03:38] who you want people to see hallelujah
[1:03:45] it's okay
[1:03:47] but here where the difference was he
[1:03:51] didn't have the revelation that's been
[1:03:54] it all alone Jesus Christ said in
[1:03:55] Matthew 16 when he came down from the
[1:03:58] mountain of Transfiguration I believe it
[1:04:00] was he said what who do men say I am the
[1:04:03] son of man he's it all said thou art the
[1:04:05] Prophet once a year so and so he said
[1:04:07] but who do you say I am Peter said thou
[1:04:10] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:04:12] do you know what Peter was saying
[1:04:15] because you know the Jews understood
[1:04:17] that when the Messiah would come it
[1:04:18] would be God Himself is that I say I
[1:04:21] said it his name will be called Emmanuel
[1:04:24] which means God with us the government
[1:04:27] will be upon his shoulders so P
[1:04:31] understood when he called him and said
[1:04:33] thou are the christ cut Peter no the
[1:04:36] Jews can only believe in one God
[1:04:38] hallelujah and if he called him the
[1:04:42] Christ which is the Anointed One he was
[1:04:44] calling him God in flesh that right now
[1:04:50] listen I'm going on I'm almost done in a
[1:04:52] little bit I didn't plan to be long but
[1:04:54] I want you to understand by God's grace
[1:04:56] that if we are elected my point is this
[1:04:59] I don't criticize but I'm learning how
[1:05:04] to feel sorry when people don't see if I
[1:05:07] see is because God ordained it to be so
[1:05:09] is God's mercy and God's grace but when
[1:05:13] other people can't see it they can't see
[1:05:16] you can't snap a blind man and say why
[1:05:18] can't you see right she is God who gives
[1:05:23] that sight you and I can't give it
[1:05:25] hallelujah you understand me those other
[1:05:28] disciples did not have the revelation
[1:05:30] Peter had at that time but God
[1:05:32] eventually gave it to her why because
[1:05:35] jesus said it is given to you to know
[1:05:39] the mystery so I don't worry about the
[1:05:41] revelations I need to make a rapture
[1:05:44] because it was given to me and that my
[1:05:47] his appointed time for me
[1:05:49] it's gonna flood in my soul you might
[1:05:52] get it before me but you ain't going
[1:05:54] nowhere without me ah because I'm gonna
[1:05:58] get it just like you it was ordained by
[1:06:00] God not by power not by might but by my
[1:06:04] spirit hmm whew greater than Solomon
[1:06:13] he's now they had two ways of knowing
[1:06:16] whether a man was right first they had a
[1:06:18] law they're the Ten Commandments but if
[1:06:22] a prophet prophesied a dreamer dreamer
[1:06:24] dream they had another way of finding it
[1:06:27] you know we know that was the year my
[1:06:29] theory no matter how good it sound they
[1:06:32] had a way of supernatural God always
[1:06:36] vindicate himself
[1:06:37] don't forget this see God vindicates
[1:06:41] himself by supernatural and that's been
[1:06:44] throughout
[1:06:45] all the ages hello when brother Brad was
[1:06:49] going through the seven churches how did
[1:06:51] he know who was who and what was what
[1:06:54] because the true believers always had
[1:06:57] supernatural following even in the dark
[1:07:01] ages
[1:07:02] that little bloodline he followed the
[1:07:08] bloodline because wherever the blood is
[1:07:11] there is supernatural things going on
[1:07:14] that's why these message people you know
[1:07:16] they come around in the town that don't
[1:07:18] want to kill you they want to make you
[1:07:19] starchy they want to make you an
[1:07:21] intellectual group that's death with a
[1:07:24] capital D is that right Bob because
[1:07:30] wherever God is is that right the
[1:07:33] Prophet God's wherever Jesus is there is
[1:07:35] a lot of noise but they say Shh oh no
[1:07:41] sure
[1:07:42] make your noise you might as well start
[1:07:45] it up here because over there it's gonna
[1:07:50] be full volume
[1:07:52] yeah the hard that's right brother full
[1:07:55] volume upon this rock I build my church
[1:07:59] what was it the revelation of who Jesus
[1:08:01] Christ is it wasn't Peter and it wasn't
[1:08:04] just Jesus it was a revelation of who he
[1:08:06] was hallelujah and that same thing is
[1:08:11] today it wasn't about William Branham it
[1:08:14] was who he was housing is the revelation
[1:08:17] of the prophet of who he was not the man
[1:08:21] but was in the man hey somebody if you
[1:08:26] miss that you miss Jesus he's the same
[1:08:29] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[1:08:33] when they closed him out of the church
[1:08:35] where did the word go right to
[1:08:38] revelations the third chapter I stand at
[1:08:41] the door and knock he said but they
[1:08:44] wouldn't open up to me those
[1:08:46] organizations and denominations refused
[1:08:49] me but they didn't understand that the
[1:08:52] me wasn't the man it was Jesus
[1:08:56] hiding himself in simplicity that's why
[1:09:02] when God comes in you and people
[1:09:05] mistreat you in a unit mistreating is
[1:09:07] God they're mistreating you love the
[1:09:13] Lord
[1:09:13] now he's hidden in his bride hallelujah
[1:09:16] and guess what
[1:09:17] just like the age didn't see Jesus they
[1:09:20] didn't see William read him they won't
[1:09:22] see you either only those who are
[1:09:24] elected to see Christ and you will see
[1:09:26] it he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:31] forever you can be right there or they
[1:09:34] say oh he's a nice brother
[1:09:35] he's a nice sister I think he's a little
[1:09:38] fanatical but he's all right I guess
[1:09:42] don't even know that's Jesus manifesting
[1:09:46] himself and don't ever be ashamed to be
[1:09:49] a Christian
[1:09:50] don't you ever drop your hair because
[1:09:52] you're in this message I don't care what
[1:09:54] they say about William Branham I don't
[1:09:56] care how they get high you know what
[1:09:59] they say about his name they did the
[1:10:01] same to Jesus they said Jesus is a devil
[1:10:04] he was born in fornication halle-loo
[1:10:08] he's the son of BL about you know what
[1:10:12] I'm saying it was bad to blind the
[1:10:15] unbeliever and everything that has been
[1:10:19] done in the way of this prophet has been
[1:10:22] said and done to blind the unbeliever
[1:10:25] but we don't look at flesh and blood'
[1:10:28] hallelujah we can see when nobody else
[1:10:30] can see Oh somebody help me here oh he
[1:10:40] said listen this is where I want to hear
[1:10:42] it the devil because the devil you know
[1:10:44] because you know we're not producing
[1:10:46] maybe we're not don't you understand
[1:10:47] even in a field of corn all corn do not
[1:10:50] ripen at the same time some ripen fast
[1:10:55] some ripen slow summers like mid or
[1:10:57] whatever but the point is it's still
[1:10:59] corn and if it stay there long enough
[1:11:04] it's going to ripen
[1:11:05] under normal conditions y'all know what
[1:11:07] I'm saying
[1:11:08] so you look at this thing so what do you
[1:11:10] mean brother I'm trying to tell the
[1:11:12] elect later I got it oh if God just
[1:11:14] helped me to Sunday I've got Wu but
[1:11:15] anyway if the Lord would just you know
[1:11:18] let us see that this is harvest time
[1:11:22] harvest that means you got to ripen you
[1:11:26] don't have an option
[1:11:27] but brother branham told her how to
[1:11:29] ripen lay in the presence of the Sun
[1:11:32] hallelujah lay before those tapes lay
[1:11:35] before that book lay before your Bible
[1:11:37] let God be tall the greening you're out
[1:11:39] of you don't don't get upset with God
[1:11:42] working on you if the Potter wanna beat
[1:11:44] you and make you over give let him do it
[1:11:48] whatever he do for me I'll be satisfied
[1:11:56] whatever he do for me I'll be satisfied
[1:11:58] that's my prayer I don't have to like
[1:12:01] what he's doing but I'm glad he's doing
[1:12:03] it oh oh Lord I love this I love this
[1:12:13] some time ago I made it making an altar
[1:12:17] call for the round said I love John 5:24
[1:12:20] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:12:23] him that sent me has eternal life and
[1:12:24] shall not come into the judgment but had
[1:12:27] passed from death unto life he that
[1:12:30] believeth now listen
[1:12:31] no that's pretty deep I need y'all to
[1:12:37] listen no that's pretty deep but when
[1:12:39] you believe no man can call Jesus of
[1:12:43] Christ only by the Holy Spirit and when
[1:12:47] you have the Holy Spirit then you have
[1:12:51] believed on the eternal life and have
[1:12:53] eternal life right he that heareth my
[1:12:57] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:13:00] has eternal life and shall not come into
[1:13:04] the judgment but has passed from death
[1:13:06] unto life
[1:13:08] preparation making ready so what are you
[1:13:12] saying when a man or woman really
[1:13:15] believe in their heart and accepted the
[1:13:17] Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior if
[1:13:19] they die today they're saying
[1:13:22] whoo that may not be all message but its
[1:13:25] word hallelujah it is to true you say
[1:13:30] prove it to me
[1:13:31] the thief on the cross nobody likes
[1:13:33] going there hallelujah
[1:13:35] but what did he do but believe and have
[1:13:38] faith that Jesus was the Lamb huh that's
[1:13:45] all Abraham he was the lamb was revealed
[1:13:48] to him it was revealed it's the sharing
[1:13:53] of blood it's for the remission of sin
[1:13:57] and this lamb has taken your place and
[1:13:59] because the lamb tooks Abel's praise the
[1:14:03] Bible said his voice still lived and
[1:14:06] cried out from the grave see a lot of
[1:14:12] time we want to put people in here
[1:14:13] because we don't understand it I'm gonna
[1:14:15] tell you something you can be totally
[1:14:16] insane and have the Holy Ghost and make
[1:14:20] heaven oh come on somebody let me ask
[1:14:24] you a question
[1:14:25] election is more powerful than that hmm
[1:14:29] election would cover every problem y'all
[1:14:32] hear me you said what do you mean
[1:14:34] Solomon died a backslider with Solomon
[1:14:37] be there saw mister real man died in war
[1:14:44] was he saved oh they knew your God yo I
[1:14:50] tell you what this is what I love about
[1:14:51] it God really have a little favor owed
[1:14:53] to you
[1:14:54] he favors you did you know he favors the
[1:14:57] elect lady come Peter denied him three
[1:15:01] times
[1:15:01] Judas one time and Peter was given the
[1:15:06] key look at all the mess David did and
[1:15:14] yet God loved him still
[1:15:19] we're not giving a license to sin but
[1:15:22] whatever we do whenever we do it the
[1:15:25] blood prevails God cleanses us from all
[1:15:29] unrighteousness I can see him I have
[1:15:33] faith because God is the only way I'll
[1:15:35] make it a rapture is that I believe in
[1:15:38] what he did for me was enough hallelujah
[1:15:43] is that right what Jesus did for me is
[1:15:46] enough not what I do is what he did and
[1:15:51] how I know he favored me because he
[1:15:54] opened my eyes to this message he said
[1:15:58] blessed is the man that's the book of
[1:16:00] Revelation blessed is the man I'm
[1:16:04] blessed

[1:16:21] have battles in between a and B but at
[1:16:24] the end of B you eternal the devil won't
[1:16:28] like that he that's what about that many
[1:16:32] other flick scenes of the righteous but
[1:16:34] God delivers them out of them all the
[1:16:37] devil can he hates you brother cuz that
[1:16:39] word cannot come back boy and when
[1:16:41] you've gone through inflictions you

[1:16:45] me out of this I can't remain because I
[1:16:49] am a righteous man
[1:16:55] what does a righteous man a man that
[1:16:56] does right all the time no he knows what
[1:16:59] being right is but he has the ability to
[1:17:02] repent when he's wrong somebody help me
[1:17:06] here
[1:17:07] is that Alright you and I must realize
[1:17:10] by God's grace because what God has done
[1:17:13] for us the Bible says no weapon jaw even
[1:17:16] as a sword way down the road he's that
[1:17:19] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:17:21] prosper none and you got to realize
[1:17:27] you've made a lot of mistakes and the
[1:17:30] devil got you on record but his record
[1:17:33] don't even account hallelujah when his
[1:17:36] under the blood of Jesus ain't nothing
[1:17:39] being held against you but you can
[1:17:42] remember it but God cannot
[1:17:45] hallelujah yeah the stable of say you

[1:18:00] grace I'll tell you what it it changed
[1:18:03] me it did something you know I've heard
[1:18:06] that message many time but this is the
[1:18:07] season you know because we're pressing
[1:18:09] folks we're in the air it just seemed
[1:18:12] like a season where we're making a lot
[1:18:13] of mistakes
[1:18:14] well maybe I'm the only one but
[1:18:16] nevertheless it is so much pressure it's
[1:18:19] so much everything out there seem like
[1:18:21] you falling and making mistakes every
[1:18:23] day your God forgive me Lord I didn't
[1:18:24] mean to think like that love forgive me
[1:18:26] oh I didn't mean to say it that way it's
[1:18:28] constant hallelujah but you doing that
[1:18:32] only because you're covered by the blood
[1:18:34] if you wasn't covered by the blood you
[1:18:37] wouldn't care about it
[1:18:38] but because you're covered by the blood
[1:18:40] you stream out Lord deliver me help me
[1:18:44] Jesus Oh glory to God give me a few more
[1:18:49] minutes hallelujah so I'm sixteen nine
[1:18:54] through eleven says therefore my heart
[1:18:55] is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh
[1:18:59] also shall rest in hope for thou will
[1:19:03] not leave my soul in Hell neither
[1:19:04] without suffer thine Holy One to see
[1:19:07] corruption
[1:19:08] thou will show me the path of life and
[1:19:11] in the presence of full and he see me in
[1:19:14] thy presence is fullness of joy at the
[1:19:16] right hand there are pleasures
[1:19:17] forevermore Jesus did you know he had to
[1:19:22] believe that he believed this so much
[1:19:25] he said if you destroy destroy this
[1:19:27] temple in three days and I raise it up
[1:19:30] they thought he was talking about
[1:19:32] Solomon's Temple he was talking about
[1:19:33] his body MA because this scripture says
[1:19:37] he ain't gonna remain there ah neither
[1:19:42] will I let his flesh see corruption come
[1:19:44] on and neither will I leave it's all in
[1:19:47] hell he descended well in hell for who
[1:19:50] you he knew he was gone there did you
[1:19:53] know he would go he knew he was going to
[1:19:55] hell when Jesus
[1:19:57] he knew he was going to hell because the
[1:20:00] scripture said he was going but he also
[1:20:02] knew that he went go stay there
[1:20:05] [Laughter]
[1:20:07] he knew he was going down that for who
[1:20:10] you and me he went to hell for you and
[1:20:14] me that's why we can't not go to hell
[1:20:17] because he's already went there for us
[1:20:20] hallelujah he is our lamb he is our
[1:20:23] refugee a refuge he is our leader
[1:20:28] oh that's why it's so good to receive
[1:20:31] the Holy Ghost because when you receive
[1:20:33] the Holy Ghost it does God accept in you
[1:20:36] and when you accept you you are accepted
[1:20:39] it doesn't matter what anybody said oh
[1:20:42] you ain't smart enough to go to heaven
[1:20:44] you ain't holy enough to go to heaven
[1:20:46] you ain't righteous enough to go to
[1:20:48] heaven it doesn't matter what you say
[1:20:50] I'm accepted hello it's like being
[1:20:56] accepted in Harvard or Yale somebody
[1:20:58] might think that they're better than you
[1:21:00] they deserve to get there but it doesn't
[1:21:03] matter the boy has already met they
[1:21:07] don't sit my level level of acceptance
[1:21:09] and ain't nothing you can do about it
[1:21:11] right that's how it is with God I hope
[1:21:16] I'm not hanging to like acting out of I
[1:21:19] can't help it I'm really full of joy why
[1:21:22] because the devil is defeated me
[1:21:28] defeated you love the Lord
[1:21:31] you see even Peter began to preach it it
[1:21:35] showed in acts 2 I'm gonna read it to 30
[1:21:38] 26 to 36 about how God would not leave
[1:21:41] his soul in hell
[1:21:42] is that right and how God would raise
[1:21:44] him up and and that therefore being by
[1:21:47] the right hand of God how God will just
[1:21:49] you know he was sent down the Holy Ghost
[1:21:53] by Jesus Christ and then Peter began to
[1:21:57] say therefore let all Israel know
[1:21:59] assuredly that God has made that same
[1:22:01] Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord
[1:22:04] and Christ
[1:22:05] think about it folks brother Branham was
[1:22:08] preaching this for a long time until he
[1:22:11] was out there
[1:22:11] I think he was hunting and he saw those
[1:22:14] three rainbows all three of them coming
[1:22:18] together he said they were moving like
[1:22:20] they were living he said they were live
[1:22:22] because it was God and he said Jehovah
[1:22:27] of the Old Testament it's Jesus
[1:22:36] you gotta know this thing and if you are
[1:22:41] Dane you will see it it doesn't come by
[1:22:44] studying it comes by believing have
[1:22:48] faith is that right
[1:22:51] the Lord of God I'm gonna stop but you
[1:22:53] know what I want you to realize by God's
[1:22:55] grace when this vision according to
[1:22:59] Rebecca was given he said Habakkuk says
[1:23:02] now this vision is for the appointed
[1:23:05] time it's coming but when it comes it
[1:23:09] won't carry let him that read run if
[1:23:14] there be a time you and I should be
[1:23:15] running more toward God this is that
[1:23:18] high if there's a time when we should be
[1:23:21] praying as much as we could possibly
[1:23:23] pray this is the time right
[1:23:27] oh listen because he said it ain't gonna
[1:23:31] wait on you it's not waiting on you it's
[1:23:36] coming and it will not wait if anything
[1:23:40] you and I need to be pressing and saying
[1:23:42] God have mercy strip me kill me whatever
[1:23:45] it takes to make a rapture for these
[1:23:47] Christ to be seen in us and what I'm
[1:23:49] saying is that don't mean that God is
[1:23:52] gonna fill you up and then have you
[1:23:53] raising the dead yeah yeah I don't want
[1:23:59] you to think that God is building you
[1:24:01] into that kind of a Superman God is
[1:24:03] building you into a character right and
[1:24:09] people say oh when I make the wraps I
[1:24:11] got this from my brother and I love this
[1:24:13] he said listen the rapture is not just
[1:24:15] for your escaping Oh Lord sin the
[1:24:18] rapture because I'm tired of suffering
[1:24:20] oh the rapture says be
[1:24:25] the cake is ready it's done right now
[1:24:32] hear them saying and when you get done
[1:24:34] God is ready to move is that right is
[1:24:38] that right he said listen I can't even
[1:24:40] move to the righteous is out of Sodom
[1:24:44] I'm a signifier it's prophesy it is
[1:24:48] known but I can't work until he out of
[1:24:50] there and God cannot have a wedding
[1:24:55] supper until the bride has made herself
[1:24:57] ready when you and I become ready don't
[1:25:01] worry about it he's gonna have to help
[1:25:03] us you know what I'm saying you see you
[1:25:04] said what I mean
[1:25:05] because God said he were gonna cut this
[1:25:06] time sure that means he's gonna turn the
[1:25:09] heat up a little bit to help you to get
[1:25:10] done he gonna turn the heat up right
[1:25:16] it's time to but just you we're moving
[1:25:19] too slow you know because we've been
[1:25:20] slugging for a long time it's all it's
[1:25:23] time for slugging to stop so god don't
[1:25:25] turn the heat and where the pressure
[1:25:27] gonna come from the same pressure same
[1:25:30] place that came it's gonna come from the
[1:25:34] political realm and the religious realm
[1:25:37] because what they were setting the stage
[1:25:40] up for the crucifixion and that's where
[1:25:43] our pressure will be coming from
[1:25:44] political realm and religious realm and
[1:25:48] so I'm going to tell you this everything
[1:25:51] they said about Jesus wasn't true so
[1:25:53] they're going to be lies toll on you
[1:25:57] just like they were told on him mmm
[1:26:01] they're gonna be people that gonna make
[1:26:03] a case oh lord help me Jesus you got to
[1:26:07] realize they meant that God has it all
[1:26:09] under control
[1:26:09] and guess what they gonna understand
[1:26:12] they're stoning you and you smiling like
[1:26:15] Stephen y'all understand me that's bride
[1:26:20] material that's elected that's chosen
[1:26:23] I love Stephen because Stephen makes me
[1:26:26] see what I am to become the character I
[1:26:34] am to become I can see Jesus but now I
[1:26:37] see Jesus
[1:26:39] and his name was Steven I love it that's
[1:26:50] you the revelation of the hour you are
[1:26:54] God in you you you and I must exemplify
[1:27:00] Jesus Christ if we want this message to
[1:27:04] materialize and to become real in us we
[1:27:07] must have faith in it and believe it no
[1:27:09] matter what it looks like Abraham you
[1:27:12] saw old man you back then got twice
[1:27:14] pumped over you know to me but Abraham
[1:27:16] said nevertheless God said so and at
[1:27:20] that appointed time Sarah looked at
[1:27:22] Abraham who you looking good over there
[1:27:24] was happening changes began to make yeah
[1:27:30] I heard brother barely say something
[1:27:31] almost exactly what I just said I'm not
[1:27:33] being blasphemous all or whatever he see
[1:27:36] God looking like oh yeah all of a sudden
[1:27:40] you know this beautiful woman she's
[1:27:41] transformed and that was an example like
[1:27:45] I try to tell people they don't agree
[1:27:46] with me I said well when God sounded out
[1:27:49] those seven thunders in that blast if I
[1:27:52] said in Revelations there was a blast
[1:27:54] there was one thunder you know and when
[1:27:56] that happened but the venom was
[1:27:57] translated people said oh no yes he was
[1:28:01] he said I was caught up now his flesh
[1:28:04] wasn't up there but something he
[1:28:07] connected with that took him there
[1:28:10] because the Bob said no flesh and blood
[1:28:12] shall enter in he comes back down God
[1:28:17] brought him back where he was he took a
[1:28:19] trip like Paul come back down to the
[1:28:22] earth and brought us these seven seals
[1:28:25] and in these messages he said would give
[1:28:29] us raptor in-phase what is Raptor in
[1:28:32] faith other than Raptor in grace it is
[1:28:36] the grace of God that gives you the
[1:28:38] faith to believe the word for your day
[1:28:42] who Jesus is and most of all who you are
[1:28:47] in relation to him there's all to Jesus
[1:28:51] we don't care
[1:28:52] you we're gonna stone you cuz you being
[1:28:55] a man make it yourself car but what they
[1:28:59] didn't understand it was God making
[1:29:02] himself a man and that's what he's doing
[1:29:05] now God making himself a man or woman
[1:29:09] however you want to put it
[1:29:10] call her bride but she takes his
[1:29:13] character she takes his strength she
[1:29:15] takes his nature and she becomes him
[1:29:19] only by the grace of God only by
[1:29:25] election right you love the Lord
