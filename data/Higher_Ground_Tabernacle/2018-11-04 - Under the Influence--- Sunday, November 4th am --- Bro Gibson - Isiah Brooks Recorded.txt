and we don't want to prolong the service but I don't think it's just meat for me to introduce myself a little bit only have a seat in Jesus Christ name Amen praise the Lord so like I say my name is Betty Gibson I've known brother Brooks and his family for quite a long time back in South Carolina amen and we did a lot of good things together a man had seen the move of the Holy Spirit how God can man and just changed so many people lives we've got saved by law we're just moving in a mighty way you no longer be blessed brother Brooks the law brought him from him and his family and I know y'all know me I know brother Henry Simmons he used to passed at that time back in back in Mullins and then Lord blessed him and now I'm the pastor Donny is brother Nathanael Simon s brother Hindus brother and we've been in under ministry since that time and in Lourdes bless this is my first time this far away from home ministry in the word of the Lord but I have been other places administering the word of the Lord in Jesus Christ's name Ryan Mullins Columbia and North Carolina different places the Lord has allowed me to go and minister this word so I just think the Lord Jesus for allowing us to be here this morning we flew out our South Carolina came in went to North Carolina flew on Dow and got into Chicago plane got late and had to run to try to catch the next plane well glad I missed that plane they gave me another plane that I coming all the way in the back when nothing was a silo of another plan I had plenty of room it wasn't much people in that plane and so I can put them a bag on the seat and everything they have plenty of rooms with the plane with just a bunny so I thank the Lord for that we got here safe and we've been there but since Thursday I made a few little brothers I made brother Keith and honestly the other brother was yeah brother Troy so I met them a few days ago and I met this precious brother right here and we fellowship together yesterday at the restaurant so like I said I thank the law for being here I pray God that I can be a blessing to you through the word of the lord I pray something can be said that'll be a blessing to you that cause you to go on further in Christ that's what it's all about we're here for one purpose that's to worship the Lord Jesus Christ and to give him all the glory to give him all the praise you're not looking for glory we were looking for pray you want him to be exalted want him to get the glorying it to pray come when he's glorified he does things for his people the more praise we stand up the more blessing God sends down that's what we want we want the blessings of the Lord we just thank God again it may this time you can stand it may have to read the word of the Lord and going to the word and man I'm not one of those new time preachers but I just find it more convenient to use a little tablet to look at the word and things like that in Jesus Christ's name so I hope this is all right amen telling me to the book of Galatians let's start Galatians 5 and 1 it says stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ had made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised the debtor to do the whole law Christ has become a no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love you did run well who did Hindi you thee shall not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump I'm read the next verse I have confidence in the Lord in you through the Lord he should be none otherwise minded he that troubled you shall bear his judgment whoever he'd be led by here's what a prayer wishes can't have any father a bridge a holy word no intellectual blessing subhanAllah God for your glory law only you know until people have neither we just empty vessels Lord looking to be filled by your spirit that your word and no voice can be heard Lord in this day we commit ourselves to be whatever sins a transgression sign if there's any way anything would hinder your presence Lord o anointing grass that you're moving out there when we plead the blood of the Covenant the blood of your son the Lord Jesus we ask for your mercy we thank you to stay father we give you the glory honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen for the reading of that script you want to take a top y'all may be seated we will take a topic under the influence under the influence and fluid is a very powerful thing we we ant we use it and don't even know we're using it people come under our influence and they are influenced by us and they begin to do things or even say thing because they're influenced by what's going on around them so be careful of our influence we want to make sure that our influence is coming from the Holy Ghost we want to be influenced by God's Spirit we don't want a contrary influence and here I want to just show you something not me but Holy Ghost it fluids is great it man I think I was looking at it the most greatest influence that's on the earth is by the Sun and the moon the Sun has a grid influence on the earth and also the moon I was looking at how the Sun and the moon affects the water we know that water in the Bible represents people that's right in the book of Revelation so the Sun is affecting the water and the moon is affecting the water causing their tire to go in and out and we know that in the natural and the spiritual realm God represents the Sun and the church represents the moon and it says and leading up in science say that the moon has the most greatest effect on the tides this effect cannot be seen but it just felt it caused the water to go in and on and this is so accurate they can list the tides for years to come off of the cell off of this and fluid can you see that influence no but it's working it's affecting the water we as a church we are affecting the world we have an influence on the world we can't see the end of room bye-bye we how we live we are infecting somebody around we have an influence see nine fluids must be by the Holy gold we don't want to get under the raw influence so many people are caught up under different people influence because of its status in life we look at sports leaders and famous people of the world they have such an influence we find that young people old people middle-aged people are affect are affected by that influence they didn't want to be just like those people what is causing that it's an influence are they really doing anything no they're just living a life doing a lifestyle but it's affecting millions of people cause and young people that want to be like them older people want to be y'all remember the slogan to be like Mike everybody want to be like Mike they still want to be like my why hasn't floors are still out there not playing them on basketball living a different life but having fluency put out there to affecting millions of people all over the world he's a billionaire because all and people are still buying his products number 23 he was nothing in the world he was still want to be like Mike I want to be like Jesus I want to be more like Jesus Christ man I want my fluence if I'm gonna get on anybody's influence I want my fluids to come from the Holy Ghost I want to be on the heads of rügen once I get on the his influence I'm not gonna be able to live the kind of life he wants me to live but first I got to come on his influence see you got to come under the influence I think the Lord the Lord cut off my just a little bit we find out here Paul was talking about a persuasion our persuasion is an influence somebody is trying to persuade you to do something I mean they're trying to influence you to do something you'd rather be for good or wrong we found out here that these people these Judaizers amen they couldn't accept what the Lord Jesus did it still was stuck on the molders law can accept what God was doing doing something new in the same time we living in the day people can't accept what God is doing in our day they can't accept the revelation of the word that God has brought so they still tied down when the denominational systems just like there was and this day he'll do the dive the fall to Paul all over the place he preaching the word trying to get people to turn back to the law you don't hear that the same spirit is working today trying to get people to turn back from the word that God has wrought where and I would they think about that that influence is out there is their influence out there in these last days it's causing people to turn back isn't in flew away they're coming from sometimes they come from the very people that were once up of God's Word sozin influence and here these Judah died that I heard the Word of God fallen Paul around trying to get these people to turn back to the law or to come under the ministry of the law and garden turn and do something different garden came and Moses had his day is that's right Moses had his day under the law he had his day now more this day is gone now god has brought grace and truth to Jesus Christ you don't have to keep the law no more to be saved or I got to have faith to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved man hey have you got a living faith and your feet will called you to everything the words they do the words of be baptized in name of the Lord Jesus Christ your faith believe that you say Amen whatever it is C so that what it is people are on the influence are being influenced for work force we should let me read that to you by the grace of God I where persuasion me I persuade I mean I have and exert influence and effect they have and exert influence our effect that's what persuade me it's trying to persuade you here in the book and in Galatians these Judaizers that would have called we're trying to persuade influence these people that just heard the word that Paul was preaching to come back under the law politics persuasion that is not of God it's not of God that car what would God call you into something and want you to go back that's not God see there's that spirit is out there there's that influence out there trying to get people to go back it's not of God it's not yet this persuasion is not of God see this influence it's not of God and not of God God and centum God and say it your garden vindicate what is truth how many I believe garden vindicate what is truth God has already vindicated waters God's vindicated that mean God can't turn away from it it's been vindicated by God by God's Spirit God and put a seal honor that it's true with us say at the Lord now nobody can come and say it's not true go got too many believers to testify that what I have done it is truth and then I one of those believe it was I there to see it no but I believe what God has said no more what wasn't there to see that he wasn't there to see what God did but we heard about it and guess what we believed it we accepted it and now I'm because of that influence we are here today remember to b'seder the brother said he said when he was trying to make him a god he's all the influence I had upon the people to bring in the Christ now you're trying to make me a Anti Christ see then fluence that he had his influence still affecting us today that ministry that God has sent in the last day is still got the same effect that it had back then the same effect see but people in the last day the enemy has come in with another influence trying to persuade you that what God has done any right it's a false prophet it is not Fiat the Lord or he all he's mistake load this mistake that mistake or this mistake that mistake my god read your Bible Paul me mistakes every man if he made a living of Earth made but stay not trying to justify and I'm trying to show it influenced see watching influence you want nobody influenced you to leave God will burn influence you leave the word so watch your influence you influence a very important you want to make sure that your influence is of God under the Holy Ghost see it meant that moon God put the moon in place to affect the earth we need the tides fisherman's depend upon that money they depend on that time where they go didn't catch fish for liberty man they need to tide him and God put that day that influence a man that's moving that water saying that then the fluid of the church in his hour that's moving the waters then fluence is moving the water the waters are being moved because of Church the bride and his I was is affecting the waters it meant people are coming to the Lord people are being saved people lives are being changed why because they'll be influenced that you have did you go out there and do anything that people gonna say oh you did this no it's just a simple life you can live a man a sermon bread you can preach him one I said you can live a man a sermon bed you can preach him one live a sermon how you gonna live it by the Holy Ghost the suasion persuade the capacity to have an effect on the character development our behavior of someone something are the effect itself so you're you're fluent have effect on somebody's character it has an effect on somebody's behavior it has an effect on how that person is going to live your influence so what kind of influence are you putting out there then we get action cell you got on is your Holy Ghost and flu they're calling you to live for the word then when someone sees you they know that you are Christian you know how to pack a Bible round whichever way the people to see your Christian it meant it'll see you are Christian by the way that you lived it recognized that there's something different about you you act like the world you don't look like the world I mean you look like a Christian how a Christian supposed to look and it's their time and hard to find people that really Christian because the world in fruit of the world has crept inside the church then flew little word I want to look worldly you want to dress worldly the worldly style and they're really fast and fluid of the church or the world has crept inside the church and some people trying to dress and look holy you're trying to dress and look more like the world see to watch the influence very important in God are looking down and seeing what is influencing you see young young women are influence in man in the last generation our honor what but it I saw your mom being affluent but someone to do evil things watch influenced by the influence you to do anything around young ladies keep you saying becoming an influence also called peer pressure there's another form of influence that attacks young people that makes them do things that are contrary to the world you know to the word you don't have to come under that kinda influence you're not the yield to it's gonna be there but you don't have to yield to it the pressure to be like the world is upon all of us when our job is the influence or try to be like the rest of the workers they're going to drink they're going to the bar whatever come on go with us no I can't go I'm a Christian I can't I can't go or you look like a square you look like you and a part of the fun that's all right at the way though I want you to be separated you're separated people different from the world I but God was trying to be still in the Israel he's I separated you from the nation you're separated people amen then you can invert it influence that a call to people in the world to see how you live and costing becoming to be a Christian that what God separates us you separate us to show a difference that we can have an influence and those people that don't know God that we can win them to Christ that weren't there don't be afraid to be alone something most best time with God is wearing you alone when you're separated a man nobody around nothing you know what fellowship but sometime God get you to a place by yourself a man that you can talk with God he doesn't a lot dinner with Abraham he did it with John Paul he did it with so many others in the Bible you read how God would separate them get them a law that he can talk with him all the prophets been alone maybe true prophets from fame from God it wasn't popular it wasn't popular there were men that was separated because they had a word from God that the people didn't agree with it was so unpopular for they did what they preached was so unpopular it meant that people cannot accept it they did the way the GAR brought in our day it's so unpopular to preacher that to say the denominational systems are I'm in the world of full of denominations they say come out of that denominational system and come to the word is I'm popular Meza but guess what it's the word of the Lord you come out so in influence so it is a powerful thing I got some examples I want to look at by the grace of God to show you in the word what really struck me is one let's go to the book of first kings remember influence come from status in position your status in your position is your influence that what preachers have to be very careful of the influence man my church member had to be very careful of that influence because you can be serving man and not serving God see be careful your influence we're all exerting influence but when a preacher is in the pulpit or whatever especially the exalted preacher his influences out there and sometimes people get so caught up under the fruit of that man they begin to serve the man and not serve God we see that happen even inside the ministry that God has sent in these last days that would have happened to a lot of people Longy could have served that man if thought they were gonna be saved you don't hear that lanza could have served that man if I was gonna be saved when that man left off to see what happened to them it went away but I'm turning around see could that influence it he want to know to treat him like that no he didn't know they don't do me like that you're gonna cause God to take me over the earth before my time don't do me like that but because of its influence these thought blonde is served as man they were gonna be saved long as I served my pastor I'm gonna be saved lana do whatever my pastor say do well I'm gonna be saved don't think like that long as you do what God works they do you're gonna be saved why don't you keep the word you'll be saved not because you serving the man that because you you thank God whatever them things you do God tells to do them thing though those pliat I give you offering come to share all that stuff was good but launch it if you're doing the please that man God ain't gonna accept it you've got to do it because you love God if you love God then you good good good know what you're gonna come to church you're gonna do because you love the Lord well are you trying to please that man you go running the trouble girl he will offend you he will make you mad you gonna say something you don't like you're gonna get mad with him that day and you might stay away from church about a few days because he made your man so he gonna be careful that the word the word shouldn't offend you the word should help let's go through I'm King so I'm working with David here we're going to ensure David had a powerful influence he was a king of Israel and everybody tried to please David God brought David up from a little child and brought him up through the ranks and God made deer but a great man with a great man and Israel God set him up he was king of all Israel but yet David had thoughts inside him he had fault as a man we all got him we can dress the pie and look at me so perfect but behind that veneer behind that is a number of a bunch of folks a bunch of folks only God can get him out of us a bunch of fault see and David had them see they're good of our first Kings eleven David had all these thoughts inside him and remember to hire you up there the more the devil trying to knock you down the more closing you we get to God the more the devil's trying to embarrass us get do things wrong get us to mess up that's how you got Moses Moses got messed up because the devil always gotten them people make them people complain give me some water I want this and I want that the devil just kept on working on multum look at Henry one day cannot you rebels this have made God is that right y'all show him to speak to the rock he got anger and he smote the rock then people call him or not to go into the Promised Land well the begging babe oh gosh our here you know mo you're not going over why because he lied an enemy to get in good in people the higher you get in God or closer you get to God the more the enemy gonna attack you the more you coming at you he's gonna try to get you to mess up see and yeah he got the Moses Moses the Bible carmoza Mohican man on all the earth but yet the devil caught in Moses and we're gonna angry the people got to the Bible said he spoke ill advised me with his lips and anybody said he speak ill-advised sleep he got angry and said things you shouldn't say and did things he shouldn't do the devil see how you go up there to them here David a king in Israel God I'm using to do so many great things and the devil is after David amen first Kings 11 even the devil after David amen China is destroyed David but we know who what God did for David and things like that but um David this has made some bad decisions see here of Samuel Kings second Samuel forgive me write these scriptures down you don't know what amen second Kings 11 and they came to pass after the year was expired that time when Kings go forth to battle the David sent Joab and his servants with him in all Israel and destroyed the children of Ammon and rabba besieged and besieged Rabbah but David Terry Stewart Jerusalem beginning past and even tired leave a rolls muffins bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the moon was very beautiful to look upon and they were sending the quad after the woman and one said is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eli and the wife of Uriah Hittite if they were sending messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he laid with her but she was purified from her and cleanness and she returned unto her house and the woman conceived and sinnin told David and said I am with child all right David should not have done that I know a lot of people said when David was King and he was ruler and he can do with them people as he want to for God and look at it like that God rebuke to david garvik said you were taking the sward or the children and Ammon and kill Uriah see and taking rise wife to be thy wife this war shall never depart from thy house is he was so much of a good King by the God punishing why did that linger over David's life God said God said David was fit for the God and everything except one thing in the matter concerning you ride ahead time the only thing God held against David that seemed would never wiped away it was a plague on his house because of what he did he did Ron he used his influence to take another man's wife knowing that he's using the food taking another man's wife but he uses them fluid to get other people to cover his influence let's look at it he he says Joey Bob now Joab should have knew better Joab was y'all know joy and David with kinfolks y'all know that right there was Joab Joab was a man a lot of time we move we wanted we want to please the flesh oh come on curls man you don't mean you all right man come on cuz do this for me all right no I can't do that I'm a Christian I can't do that many way here so David done took this man wise down got a pregnant now this happened over space of time it didn't happen all in one day it takes a little powerful woman know she pregnant think about least two or three months for she was CEO I know something it meant so she become pregnant and now David gets the new the now he is under state of panic he wants to cover his sins deader than confessing and I'm making it right he wants to cover it see when you do wrong don't try to cover confess and make it right don't cover your sins you cover your sin the Bible that you won't prosper David here is caught then he meant to get caught no he thought he got away but God had it so that the woman got pregnant now he needs a way out deny uses his influence to get everybody around him the cover form to try to lie how many oh I've done that before usually influence it gets people to cover for your life you did a little run and your influence caused those around you to cover for you don't do it don't do it tell the truth no matter how it hurts tell the truth no use your influence to come up nothing especially if you done wrong David Hare did just that and what surprised me was about the story here is how Joab is when did everything they would say do it were just as guilty as David he called that man to be killed sit down man - the hardest battle just to kill them so that he won't find out that the child is not mine it blown to David see this influency that's why you can't come under the influence of no man you're to be under the influence of the Holy Ghost because when the under the fluid of the Holy Spirit you will do what's right you under that influence you can't tell a lie under the influence of the Holy Ghost you might try but the holy book and Vic you make that thing right the Prophet did it he lied tell him I'm not in the house just you tell his wife that's why I said well I stepped outside this influence tell you the wife the life on Hina now tell I'm not the old tax collector cause I ain't your prayer go make that thing right then I hear your prayer see so you can't lie under the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit under than fool you true London and full of the Holy Ghost it will convict you of your wrong if you allow it to it convicted you and you wrap your law it to a lot of time our conscience gets so sad about it that the countries said with a hot iron it gets so sales sometimes we can't even feel the conviction of the Holy Ghost we allow that conviction not even have no effect on us but the Holy Ghost is there amen to convict that we can get it right so David right here got it all these men working for him they were under his influence your honor David influence so that's why they did what they did under his influence until God can set you free from that you're always been under somebody influence your been someone in funda God break the chain God have to break the chain offer your life and offer you to be free from a bad influence I know could God break the chains off of my life one day I was under somebody's influence no matter what this person did I would I thought I was serving God but I was trying I was covering for that man and one day God broke the chain I saw the chains broke I saw the chains fall off if not be there the flu infected me like that no more see I saw the chains fall off I was under this manson fluid the cause of his ministry i was under his influence i willing to do anything for him cover for him live from whatever but when god broke those chains it was a different thing now I was under influence of God's Spirit I thought it was under I was under amazing fluency and so easy to do that like if you read I'm David's influence do it all this wrong you think it counted at one time condemn them you think it counted at any time affected them think about joy I was doing carding the man to be killed drop country involving out in their bed while he was pleasing David he thought he was alright they have a service even got into it trying to get you writer come and eat for the King got a mess of food for you come on to the house and eat didn't knew what David did all up under that influency nobody had enough guts to stand up and say you wrong to God sent Nathan the Prophet thank God for Nathan the Prophet even someone in afraid to say that's a at the Lord amen so I need a friend to tell it to somebody there's under the influence of the Holy Ghost see the difference a lot of people down the devil some fluid angels in that round they're trying to cover for them but now God send somebody is under his influence they're not afraid to say you're wrong you're tooken you rise wife and you've done the things you did nine thus warning can never depart from your house and all these bad things are happening you because of what you did somebody had enough the unction of the Holy Ghost to say you wrong how are you afraid to tell your friend that they're wrong you saw under the influence you can't be a real friend tomb to tell them when they're wrong that you what you're doing is wrong a real friend will tell you when you're wrong a real friend now the Bible said is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother that's the Lord Jesus Christ he'll tell you when you're wrong he can just be your friend and that you go around keep on doing thing no he's a good friend here tell you when you're wrong see Joab sort of rebuked David some has seven so to rebuke David somebody said says something but because of under his influence they can sell word it wouldn't did exactly what he's wanted them to do under hissing flora God sent Nathan a prophet a man with us say at the law to get David's crate and what it takes to take somebody with enough boldness not to be afraid to say what God want to say you can just get somebody there's not afraid he can use amen so David they were under his influence see I hope y'all saw that by the grace of God under his influence to do evil instead of good thought it was serving the Lord but all the time it was serving David that's hard in it to come to church all your life thank you doing good and the whole time you were just serving that man the seven to Lord Jesus Christ in me honors I remember the story the probably talked about the woman she was a Sunday school teaching all this good stuff and I think she had cancer something she was dying and she realized she was going to hell and she's they call that preach inside here call him call him I just you just feed my man I'm going to hell you deceived my man but was too late see I deceive a man why he would not tell her the truth under that he went through a lot of people to learn that same kind of info and go to church do it whatever you want to do this kind of church whatever you're going to do just come to church the law love you everything my dad that's a line preacher if you don't picture your sin of the line please do everything in all right everything is not alright you got sin they need to be confessed and need to be under the blood you can get your soul right in all hallelujah hallelujah with God well I'm gonna say all of it ain't good all the time somebody needs to have another spirit to tell you when you're wrong like Nathan did to David he wasn't afraid God sent him he wasn't afraid to tell her David you was wrong what you did was wrong lobby was them with David it was right there but David it was wrong but God said it was wrong Amen praise Lord Amen let's look at another scripture here y'all forgive me amen praise the Lord let's go to the book of Acts I'm just gonna get into this right here I want to dwell too long on the wrong thing amen acts the second chapter notice is influenced right here now if you're under the influence or something yes they're kind of cool someone come on right here this a week this will be trying to get to back to what Pentecost getting back the Penta car when they flew that the Holy Ghost is so thick Amen everybody can do number get in the spirit see there instead of flew that God trying to get us back to see dr. fluent of man but the fluid of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord look at this right here look at the two and it's tied to second verse and suddenly came a sound from heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven or I was read on a Schiphol overseas amen the Peter say right here the 14 verse but Peter standing up with the eleven little voice and said unto them humility did and argue the drug do some beat us know know you and hear my word and Harbhajan my wherever these are not drunken as she supposed since about the figured I was add a note on in the fluid of a prophecy the other fluid of the Word of God a man that in the last days as a kind of bath day of God I bought my friend all friends drunk with wine they drunk with the spirit heel in the drunkest family the same things they man but if something that's being influenced by the Holy Ghost a man with a man a drunk with wine him you ever seen a drunk man you fool he drunk with wine y'all drunk woman anything come on their mouth okay what they say it is drunk inside did his drug its tagging all around and the most i'ma try to preach to you you know Ravana that demon power given didn't know the Bible better than some preachers holiday run into a drunk person that start courting the Bible have y'all have had that experience before he drunk buddy under the spoon of another spirit if even there was drunk but not would wine there was drunk with another spirit God they were under the influence that wasn't under the influence nothing the flu of the what the Holy Ghost they're calling the speaking town their prophesy in the same thing that were kind of patty but under the influence see I don't want to be on an influence under alcohol and we as Christians we should not be drinking alcohol no we don't I know the Bible say use a little wife but I stomach sick and I often infirmities I understand that too but you do it like that we even raised to do it like that we've been raised to drink it to get drunk if we going drink we're gonna get tore up that's right really get tore up we either give a little bit of our stomachs ache no we're gonna get T up with it man you're drunk but we don't drink like that we are drunk but not with wine we drunk without with the spirit of the what the Living God that's what we drunk with that's whose influence we are under see they were under that influence it made them drunk and staggered look somebody like they were drunk Peter said no these many drunk no the under the influence of the Holy Ghost see now what God is trying to bring us to under the influence of the Holy Ghost men and women boys and girls God wants you on the his influence he want you to be under peer pressure from your peers in school young children under more pressure than ever you don't you to know more thing that we ever knew you know more than we ever knew his children in North Way before we got a chance to know they know at all see so influenced to do the things that a young people are doing it it is it's very hard for young children teenagers children scooter influence of that peer pressure so high they take the grace of God for them not to fall under it and you we as parents we have the mix show that they are under our influence oh lord have mercy we've got to make sure they're in our food that when they go wherever they go the food that we put on them it's with them I'm a not her dad that influenza we got our Christian influence the read their Bibles the pray the hair Bible study that's an influence you put up on your child and when they go all different places that influences with them so you got to instill it in your child what if it isn't still inside them video games and high-pass and phone that's all they can see instead I'm doing something for the Lord there's always some other thing you're looking at so that's that influence see and the more they're looking at that and more that influences upon them so now you're going to put them on under another influence but let's see another atmosphere see so your influence upon your child was so important to go do everything we do anyway REME gotta tell them they go looking see what mom and dad to do and nine times out of ten they're gonna do that anyway but remember we are fighting against other influences also it's out there that's going to cause them you do things that it shouldn't do so that way our influence got to be more stronger than the influence it got to be more powerful and it is powerful Isis the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost are fooled away powerful in the world influence they making brick chains they man it can destroy yokes a man it can do all of that Long's we get under that influence here to do it see it or do it a break every chain it'll break every you get a brick every devil female Army gun under his influence so under the under the influence of the Holy Ghost these men was staggering I did was drunk they thought they were drunk the Peter began to prophesy and tell them these men are not drunk as you think but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel well it should kind of past said God in the last days that I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh that's right your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall dream dreams your undersea vision upon my center ham I know they'll pour my spirit nishan brother God promised that and guess what that's still going on ain't that prophecy enough filled it man it's two going on a man so deep you meeting them with drunk I will wine natural wine not what alcohol spirit yes we want to get drunk but get drunk in the spirit a man praise the Lord look em another scribble just Book of Psalms the book of armed judges amen praise the Lord he when you come from under the influence of the Holy Spirit bad things beginning to happen and you come under his influence because another influence got ahold of you and nine times out of ten it's the devil we know it's the devil it's his influence he isn't fluence is out there too want to grab a hold of our lives we don't want that to happen so we got to stay under God's influence Samson had learned that lesson the hard way Samson was a man of London influence of God according to do great things while he was under that influence took a jaw bone and slew a thousand four listings it may didn't do much you know with the revelation of it is in like the television perpetrates am sending you some giant man with giant muscles no he looks so skinny on these little skinny kids that white he's trying to figure out way in the world is this great power coming from they was trying to figure it out to see you know mystery to see a man with a bunch of muscle what his power coming from where you got a little skinny fella ain't got no muscles way in the world just coming from see they wanted to figure it out they would do anything to figure it out see and this young man are under the influence of God's Spirit and the food of the Holy Ghost he was able to do great things God was using them the Bible says so the Bible said the Spirit of God beginning to move him at times amen the Spirit of God began to move this young man influenced him it began a grew great thing but he got caught up amen what a woman caught up by David Icke caught up with a woman Solomon did got caught up with a woman lord have mercy a man of judges 16 ya know behind wearing the patient's about the risk I'll be coming to a close but if just want to arm bring this right here by the grace of God because so important there's a to be living in all the influence will go up against Russia's influence they're trying to turn people away from the word of the Lord in this last that we're living in the influence is great it's out there it was attacking the people amen so he got to be aware of the influence a man you want to be make sure your influences of God I hold the Holy Ghost we say but never take you away from the word it leads you to the word the Bible said the Spirit of Truth when he has come he shall lead you and guide you into what all truth see destined fluence at the holy gold it comes to lead you and guide you into all truth so it will never take you away from the word of the Lord once God has vindicated it now prove that it's right then the Holy Ghost will never come and tell you that is wrong see definitely you can get under the foods of the Holy Ghost you want to be supporters persuasions are out there come even got to pop ass ways you could persuade you you the same Bible but Swede you that what you got is a lie see a power up a Sweden and the fluid is powerful the God wants you to come under his influence so Samuel let's look at this right here Amen praise the Lord look at 16 and 5 yep y'all know the story by the grace of God I want you to see this man that under the fluid of God Holy Spirit he allow a woman to take him under that influence he allowed a woman he didn't know he lost it until he went out there and tried to he bottles he burnt then he shook himself and that power that he used to feel he didn't feel it no more that pile he used to feel I got to do with this shake himself and he could feel a power flowing through him when he did at that time he didn't feel it something that happened he came out in the fluids of this woman and she she never did care about them all she wanted was the money judges 16 and 5 and the laws of the ballistic came up to her and sending her and ties him and see in where his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him and that we may buy him to affect him and we will give give me every one of us 1,100 pieces of silver so it wasn't a send him some great muscle man had him in something different because he had been looking ordinary fella because you can figure out where power was coming from didn't know what the Spirit of the Lord Jesus said you shall receive power after that what the Holy Ghost is come upon you how to do I live right do right talk right hello talk right God I got a tow to your tongue you don't do little bad talking them on or evil speaking calling the body no name I know no cursing coming out your mouth y'all gonna control your tongue sir you can't curse hello got so mad to call you a child a name you big he'd you still I tell you to sit down shut up and the Holy Ghost watch your tongue see they influenced once you get angry anything can happen you know when you're angry you're close to insanity that's right very close to anything will happen once you're under that spirit come under that anointing of the anger anger demon that way who lord have mercy you got to pray the guard keep you when you get to that point your child done got you upset and you begin to see derogatory things tomb and then stuff like that you said Hank I heard them you had to fix them way down the road the names we might call our child when we angry with them it affects the character and it does something to the inside the Bible says in the book of James that the tongue is a if it's full of deadly poison poison might don't work right away but when you steam your book scream long enough it's going to kill you see poison it will affect you so be careful amen so Samson a man they want to flick it on the final where the great strength lies it against Delilah you go and try to say that he loved her but Delilah only wanted the money amen in our 7th verse and Sam's I'm getting to play with her she should have never played around with her that's a good wall of me you know we got to be careful man we got to pray Delilah is after the Jezebel spirit is laughs there's after it is for my dinner they're being influenced but you were spared the cost and they want to trap us these we got to really pray amen did the devil wanted Samson or anything to devil want to get me and you to the devil out there trying to get us to they gonna be very careful what agree that I mean I was Steve before the Lord and pray man it made my brother he had a cross inside his car if you're a woman you look at the cross am I gonna eat that cross in front of me - without he wondering will I got to look at the cross you might on the cross because I know what's gonna take place if you fool around with the devil Samson didn't realize it but he was in trouble fool around with Delilah playing games with her telling us this telling that - one day she worked with him so much that he broke down the bottle see he told her all his heart everything that was wrong what was going why he had this Greece strength now I love you to think the strength was us here the screen was not his here his strength was keeping the word the word say don't cut your hair I'm a I heard that it wasn't this here there was a screen it was him keeping the Word of God not to cut us here and when he cut us here when Delilah called his hair to be cut that's when he lost his scream for women who cut you here don't ha no don't don't don't don't do it even priests don't do it amen amen so when he did that he didn't know what had taken place but they're known and that left him Oh Lord hammered I do not want that anointing to leave me I don't know how y'all feel about this thing but Lord don't teach your Holy Spirit away from me that what David said they would say take not thy Holy Spirit away from me he said restored to me the joy of my salvation see don't take your Holy Spirit away once the Spirit of God leaves like any other man you're like a man that don't have God once God's Spirit leave you you're like any other man you want to have the strength to stand against the devil once God spirit leaves you you like any other man there any other person that why you love him when you make sure that we stay under their northing under the influence of the Holy Ghost Samson lost it and the sad thing about this that he didn't even know he did and tell you Lila said the felicitous be upon thee Samson he rolls up and about he shook himself I didn't feel nothing didn't feel the power flowing didn't feel the power the power how many ever been under the power of the Holy Spirit even you felt it before so you know what it's like he knew what it was like so when he shook him seven didn't feel it he knew he was in trouble the devil plucked his eyes I made him a servant made him grind to me the whole thing - why because he lost influence of the Holy Ghost he came and then fluent of a woman David did the same thing came in the fluid of a woman Bathsheba looking out the window at the wrong place at the wrong time she brought in the battlefield he around the house Amen the woman out there washing and stuff he looks out there come under and flula woman form and he card over there and did what he did Samson and in the fluid of Delilah because of her beauty and now he lost s-- that influence the Holy Ghost left him here under food young influence of men they gonna beat him they're gonna punish it they're gonna talk to him why he did so much things to them God had him doing it see he he lost it his influence he came from under the influence of the Holy Ghost that power that moved him that power to Carson and be able to beat the Philistine that power that the caused him to live how you live he lost that power and the enemy took advantage of it and costing their be asleep you know the devil he put our eyes our two got our natural eyes our spiritual eyes you're blinded you can't see the word no more that what do you do when you come under the anointing come from under the Holy Ghost you're blind your eyes your spiritual eyes that you can't see the word you'll be blind it's best to be natural blind and spiritual blind because when the spiritual and the natural blind you still can see spiritually but when you're spiritually blind that's when truly in bad shape so I really be natural blind and spiritual blind when you're spiritually blind you in bad shape amen so Samson he lost its influence he lost it because of a woman Lord keep us in his last days keep us father in the name of Jesus Christ keep us we need to be kept look at now just go to the book of Acts X the ninth chapter Paul was one of those fella that served the church he served a church long he was serving the church you see was all right doing good everything he going wherever to whatever chief priests endtime at that were he went where the chief priests sent him to do no Paul did he was under the influence you thought Long's he did what they told him to do he was all right that's the case of a lot of people today I didn't do what the preachers they do yeah all right no because you gotta do what the words they do your preacher could be wrong I'm saying nothing about your pastor he understand in general your preacher gonna be wrong I mean I know that probably made a lot of mistakes and the God I have a few people to correct him he said he said five I'm five five hundred dollars whatever that 777 thousand thank God somebody gives somebody enough unction just saying you said seven seven hundred so you think somebody wasn't afraid to correct and not only think many other things if you look back and listen and read you see quoting scriptures wrong all that stuff from I see somebody got to have the Holy Ghost just say when you're wrong somebody got to have some kind of influence to be able to correct error somebody the Holy Ghost Ward Nord somebody's you can wreak error you always does somebody gonna come garden if there be a child he'll use a child if it was a donkey you use a donkey man somebody gonna regard later somebody do correct the error a man who ever got to use he used by the grace

chains off a paul baba says on his eyes had had been scales the scale fall off his eyes now you can see clearly what he's doing he thought one time he was doing good by persecuting the very people of God but the guard came and broke the chains you can see now he not only the floors of the church he's under fluent of the Holy Spirit he's doing the evidence but he said to Mike I'm a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm a prisoner Bible or I'm a prisoner he's I'm a lama love prisoner I love him so much that I do whatever he tells me to do see that kind of prison we need to be love prisoners he

under different influence now Amen the floors are the church and I'm persecuting God's people but now the whole egos got him on the right track now he's uplifting the church he's building the church he's the one that set the church in order because he came under that influence on what the Holy Ghost see Oh hallelujah thank God somebody get under that influence somebody's the God can use somebody amen y'all got a little more time I read too much scriptures by the grace of God oh by I'm beating you down with this right here but we trying to get a nut meat so much of a point but let you see that as a difference between being under the influence of God and being under influence of mine are being under influence of the world there's a big difference say we will make sure that you are didn't influence of the Holy Ghost the brother gave Harmon no when I mind in the flu that the Holy Ghost because you're doing what the words say that's how you know you doing what the words say Amen praise
