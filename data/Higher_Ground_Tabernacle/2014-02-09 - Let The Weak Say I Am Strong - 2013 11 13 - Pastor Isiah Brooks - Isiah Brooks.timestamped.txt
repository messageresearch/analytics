[3:07] to give a little lesson let the weak say
[3:10] I'm strong
[3:12] amen we realize by the grace of God
[3:15] we're living in a trying time and Satan
[3:18] in his uh shrewd
[3:22] way uh is attacking everybody one way or
[3:25] another don't ever feel like you by
[3:28] yourself you never
[3:30] alone amen so we just want to encourage
[3:33] you tonight and give you a few
[3:36] scriptures we talked last night or at
[3:39] Bible study we're talking about the
[3:41] mercies and the grace of
[3:43] God and we find out amen L Lamentations
[3:47] 3:23 talks about that how that they are
[3:50] new Every Morning Hallelujah uh because
[3:53] God is
[3:54] faithful so understand by the grace of
[3:57] God there's something that God wants us
[4:00] to do and that is to lean completely
[4:03] upon himall if you would turn with me
[4:06] right now to Second
[4:08] Corinthians the 12th chapter and the nth
[4:10] verse 2 Corinthians 12th chapter the 9th
[4:13] verse and we're going to work with
[4:15] because living is not for the weak
[4:18] living is for the strong remember amen
[4:21] it was the weak weaker vessel that got
[4:24] us in this trouble no
[4:26] offense but God designed her for that
[4:29] amen amen but listen by the grace of God
[4:32] he would have never been able to break
[4:34] Adam had he not come by way of Eve amen
[4:38] amen because Adam was the word amen so
[4:41] God had to design someone or uh like Eve
[4:45] for this to happen so understand by the
[4:48] grace of God our strength even as Eve's
[4:51] strength laid within adamen our strength
[4:54] lays with lies within the the the true
[4:56] Adam who is Jesus Christ himself amen 2
[5:00] Corinthians
[5:02] 12:9 let's read that by the grace of
[5:07] God you love the
[5:10] Lord
[5:12] amen 2 Corinthians 12 chapter and verse
[5:17] n by the grace of God Amen it reads and
[5:21] he said unto
[5:23] me my grace is sufficient for thee my
[5:27] strength is made perfect
[5:30] in
[5:31] weakness so even at times when you feel
[5:35] weak or at your weakest
[5:38] Point understand it's only really your
[5:41] feelings because your strength is in God
[5:44] Amen and not within yourself amen that
[5:47] is when God can really show who he is
[5:51] yes sir at a time when you feel like you
[5:54] weak and you can't go any further come
[5:56] on somebody when it feel when you feel
[5:59] like like you have exhausted all of your
[6:01] strength and all of your energy towards
[6:04] something uh that it seems like um it's
[6:07] uh it's not even conquerable if there's
[6:10] a word amen that you can't even conquer
[6:12] it amen that is when God steps in is
[6:15] that right thank you Lord amen and and
[6:17] God always want you to see that he
[6:19] always wants you to recognize that he is
[6:22] in control I just heard the prophet of
[6:25] God say the other day he said amen no
[6:27] matter how it looks like all all these
[6:30] things are out of time he said
[6:32] everything according to God's clock is
[6:34] on time amen amen thank you Lord amen
[6:37] amen 1 Corinthians 15:4 to3 we want you
[6:41] to understand that we were born with
[6:43] weak
[6:44] bodies hello we were born with weak
[6:49] bodies I'm going say that again we were
[6:52] born with weak bodies that's why the
[6:55] scripture says that the the the the
[6:58] spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
[7:00] right your body is weak you cannot
[7:03] depend on it your body as I've said many
[7:06] times will faint on you y
[7:09] amen amen they said many times in in in
[7:12] in the jungle they said you know when a
[7:14] lion come you know uh he really don't
[7:17] have to kill a
[7:18] man he scared his flesh Falls before the
[7:23] lion can get there he faints is that
[7:26] right amen so we realize amen you can't
[7:29] depend on this flesh it will fail you
[7:32] when you need it the most true amen so
[7:36] we find out amen First Corinthians the
[7:38] 15th chapter and it uh and the 43rd
[7:41] verse it says it is sown in dishonor it
[7:46] is raised in glory so your body is
[7:49] really sown in dishonor but by the grace
[7:53] of God it will be raised in glory amenu
[7:57] right amen it is sown in weakness it is
[8:01] raised in power so we really got
[8:04] something to look forward to amen like I
[8:06] said on the other day amen God is not
[8:09] judging you according to your flesh
[8:11] because your body is condemned sin is in
[8:13] the flesh amen but God is dwelling God
[8:16] judges you by the spirit that dwells
[8:19] within that flesh is that all right amen
[8:22] so the word of God said be strong and of
[8:24] a good courage fear not nor be uh afraid
[8:29] right
[8:31] amen of them amen really because we
[8:34] realize amen that most of our fear is
[8:37] just in our
[8:39] minds hallelujah amen the fear that we
[8:44] we we go through on a daily basis you
[8:46] know I I've been really um praying for
[8:49] those uh Filipinos you know we've got
[8:51] brothers and sisters over there I
[8:53] haven't heard what what's going on over
[8:55] there uh other than what I've seen on on
[8:58] the news but but I've been crying and
[9:01] praying and crying and praying you know
[9:03] why because that's us folks yes amen I I
[9:07] can't imagine uh uh uh what it would be
[9:10] like to be in a circumstances like that
[9:12] I just can't understand uh the
[9:15] pain despair especially for those who
[9:18] don't have God you know we've got
[9:21] Believers over there message Believers
[9:23] amen who may have been called into all
[9:25] of that I don't know you know but my my
[9:28] my my my thought every day has been to
[9:31] really pray for them pray for them I was
[9:33] talking with a young man in a restaurant
[9:36] today I just brought it up and you could
[9:37] tell he didn't even want to hear about
[9:39] it he just cut me short but you think
[9:42] that people Hearts would go out because
[9:45] listen our day coming amen amen our day
[9:50] is coming so you know I I just my heart
[9:53] has been going out because if you know
[9:56] but it gave me uh how can I how can I
[9:58] say it us a feeling
[10:01] of oh
[10:04] appreciation that I can appreciate God
[10:07] this moment amen yeah I almost feel good
[10:10] feel guilty eating and drinking and all
[10:12] of that knowing those people are so
[10:14] suffering over there but at the same
[10:17] time I'm grateful to
[10:19] God that we're not experiencing that as
[10:22] of right now
[10:24] amen you
[10:26] know but I look at these things and you
[10:29] know some people you know they lost
[10:31] their families and you know and we think
[10:34] we've got tests what about the
[10:38] Believers who perhaps have lost loved
[10:40] ones wives children maybe the whole
[10:44] family except one person may still be
[10:46] alive this one woman I saw amen she lost
[10:49] her husband and all four of her
[10:51] children found swept away and dead in a
[10:55] pile now is that a test or not
[10:59] amen it's one of those things that you
[11:01] can kind of relate with in the sense you
[11:03] think well this is something job must
[11:05] have gone through amen but job was a man
[11:08] that was able to keep his Integrity he
[11:10] didn't he didn't feel like his soul was
[11:13] going to be lost or something but he
[11:15] just wanted a reason he wanted to
[11:17] understand why and let me tell you
[11:19] something there are things that are
[11:20] happening in our lives to when you know
[11:23] we'll never come to understand amen
[11:25] until we on the other side
[11:27] am amen you understand that amen but
[11:30] we're sown this body is weak and
[11:33] sometime we identify ourselves with this
[11:35] body and Paul is tried to tell us this
[11:38] is not you amen this body is not you
[11:42] it's already judged it is dying right
[11:45] now yes you know it's dying it's worms
[11:49] and everything is in this dust body but
[11:51] but Paul said the real you is the inner
[11:53] man see the inner man is what God wants
[11:56] to be strong amen hello amen because
[11:59] this body ain't gonna stop aging I don't
[12:01] care how much Holy Ghost you got in you
[12:03] until God change and brings a Rapture
[12:06] amen that's true Hallelujah right amen
[12:09] think about it this body has already
[12:12] been condemned it's weak it's going to
[12:14] fall aart on you amen but you Faith your
[12:19] faith still must
[12:21] hold Hallelujah is that all right amen
[12:24] your faith must still hold amen turn
[12:28] with me again now
[12:29] Amen to uh uh uh Hebrews 11 we read that
[12:35] I think already yes go with me to Romans
[12:38] 4:20
[12:40] please is that all right amen I want to
[12:42] just encourage you because people we
[12:45] don't know what's coming up the road
[12:48] amen we have no idea but it's this this
[12:51] thing is not given to the weak amen
[12:54] you've got to be strong when this thing
[12:56] comes strong where in Christ amen
[12:59] knowing you know it it's things are
[13:00] going to happen circumstances are going
[13:03] to occur amen but God is expecting us to
[13:06] have faith faith in him knowing that I
[13:10] know this is a hard scripture to to take
[13:12] sometime but it's true anyhow all things
[13:15] work together for the good of them that
[13:17] love God Amen those who are called
[13:20] according to his purpose amen we may not
[13:23] understand with people of God he didn't
[13:25] ask us to understand he said have faith
[13:27] amen he said believe it hallelujah amen
[13:31] it's true
[13:32] anyhow amen Romans 4:20 I love this the
[13:38] scripture
[13:39] uh is that all right amen talking about
[13:43] uh Abraham he said he staggered not at
[13:46] the promise of God through unbelief but
[13:50] was strong in faith giving glory to God
[13:54] Amen and you know for the first time
[13:56] when I was reading that today that that
[13:58] scripture stagger you know what
[13:59] staggering is you're not keeping a
[14:01] straight line right today I believe and
[14:03] tomorrow I don't oh Lord right you're
[14:07] not keeping a straight line you're not
[14:09] steady in your belief and when you find
[14:11] yourself wobbling like that you know not
[14:14] knowing you know where you are when it
[14:16] comes to God you're staggering but
[14:18] that's not Abraham Abraham staggered
[14:22] not he kept his eye focused on God and
[14:26] he believed God and he called those
[14:28] things that be not as though they were
[14:31] oh it doesn't make it easy but you've
[14:34] got to recognize the devil must do his
[14:36] job amen he's here to accuse you he's
[14:40] here to point his finger at you amen
[14:42] he's here and he does a excellent
[14:45] job amen but the the same time he can't
[14:50] come and trouble you until God gives him
[14:52] permission amen so if God has given you
[14:55] permiss him permission to trouble you
[14:57] that means God has faith in you
[15:00] amen Lord somebody say hey that felt
[15:05] good to me God has faith in you and
[15:08] listen so I think brother Isaac was
[15:10] praying Lord we might stumble we might
[15:12] fall and God knows
[15:14] that the Bible said a just man falls
[15:17] seven times in a day and he gets back up
[15:19] amen he's still just cu the Bible call
[15:21] him
[15:23] just right he's still just cuz the Bible
[15:26] called him just right now the sinner not
[15:29] a backslider not not a a hypocrite he's
[15:32] just he's just cuz he gets up amen
[15:36] hallelujah he gets up and that's what's
[15:39] so so important oh oh oh I saw something
[15:43] here amen when I was studying we going
[15:45] to we're going to get there in just a
[15:46] minute minute ago minute amen because I
[15:49] want you to understand the power of your
[15:52] mind for an example brother Bon went
[15:55] into this little girl or young lady's
[15:57] room to and she needed healing
[15:59] and uh he showed her what real Faith
[16:02] could
[16:03] do and he stared at that that light and
[16:07] it began to move backwards and forward
[16:09] backwards she said but brother she he
[16:11] knew she he
[16:13] thought he was working Mind of a man or
[16:15] some kind of Witchcraft or something he
[16:17] said but you know this is Faith amen you
[16:20] know and he I think she asked did Jesus
[16:22] do that he says no I did
[16:25] it now I want you to know there are
[16:28] people out in the world who don't even
[16:30] know Jesus amen and they can have enough
[16:33] Faith to move
[16:35] objects amen amen hello faith is a law
[16:40] faith is a law come on somebody and
[16:44] every one of us have a Measure of Faith
[16:46] anyhow amen because if the world was
[16:49] created by faith everything in the world
[16:52] moved by faith amen Faith created it yes
[16:56] so everything a fish got to have faith
[16:59] he may not know that's what it is but it
[17:01] is what it is amen because everything
[17:04] moves by that law of
[17:07] Faith now listen the word of God said he
[17:10] staggered not because you know what uh
[17:13] um and I think I I I love brother Mar
[17:15] Marcus he was just telling me the other
[17:17] day about being grounded I like that you
[17:19] know I mean I can't hardly wait I
[17:21] thought about it uh just the other day
[17:22] or yesterday or today whenever it was I
[17:24] thought would I catch a flu if I go out
[17:26] there and just step on the ground a
[17:27] little while for
[17:30] you know you know I believe it I believe
[17:33] science is good and evil amen we weren't
[17:37] meant to wear
[17:40] shoes no when we get to heaven and when
[17:43] the New Jerusalem all is all over the
[17:45] Bible brother said he saw all of them
[17:48] and they were barefooted Amen in other
[17:51] words amen the shoes protect us but it
[17:54] ALS must harm us
[17:56] too amen right if oh come on somebody it
[18:00] keeps us from being
[18:02] grounded there's got to be something
[18:04] amen that that that our feet must feed
[18:07] from oh come on somebody the Bible
[18:10] liking us like a tree you uproot that
[18:13] tree place it in mere air where it can't
[18:16] be in the ground what's going to happen
[18:18] to it is going to eventually
[18:20] die huh the tree needs the ground so do
[18:25] you and I amen
[18:30] oh you're going to get sick and that's
[18:32] why we do get sick because we don't go
[18:34] baref foot
[18:36] enough oh help us Lord listen but I said
[18:40] all of
[18:42] that to say by the grace of God that we
[18:46] are living in a time that we must
[18:48] understand the power of the seed that's
[18:51] in
[18:53] you when I read that scripture where it
[18:56] says amen what it says uh in 1 Peter 1:3
[19:00] it says what it uh 1 Peter 1:13 I'm
[19:03] sorry wherefore girdle up the loin of
[19:07] your
[19:08] mind and you know what those lowings uh
[19:12] it means amen it it it is the place
[19:16] where the Hebrews thought the generative
[19:20] power
[19:22] resides and I thought oh my God God is
[19:25] saying
[19:26] [Music]
[19:27] release amen that that that that there
[19:30] the power of the seed release it because
[19:33] in your mind if you girle if you girle
[19:35] up the loins of your mind you recognize
[19:39] you are of the seed of God and what's in
[19:42] you is dynamite it's power is strength
[19:47] and no room for fear amen amen right the
[19:51] loins of your mind GLE it up it says be
[19:56] sober oh come on somebody amen be sober
[20:00] in the Lord I mean you know you you
[20:01] think clearly you there's no fear you're
[20:04] not drunk right you recognize who you
[20:08] are most of all you recognize who he is
[20:13] amen
[20:15] Oh my he said according to 2 Corinthians
[20:19] 13:5 examine yourself whether you be in
[20:22] the faith prove your own selves know ye
[20:26] not your own selves how that Jesus
[20:29] Christ is in you except you be reprobate
[20:33] oh Lord know that he's in you no come on
[20:38] somebody examine yourself don't you know
[20:41] he's in there amen and if he's in there
[20:44] he is the faith you need amen amen I'm
[20:48] going say that again he is the faith you
[20:55] need girl it up amen huh Amen in that
[21:01] old Jewish tradition they get their long
[21:04] robes and skirts and everything and wrap
[21:06] that thing and tie in such a way and
[21:08] then put a belt around it to keep it in
[21:10] place and see that's what God is saying
[21:13] amen G it up make sure you keep it in
[21:16] place the word amen you're the seed of
[21:19] God Amen you're the gene of God come
[21:21] onlj amen and all you need to continue
[21:24] you've got to constantly remind yourself
[21:27] of who you are amen because it is the
[21:29] devil's job to take that from you
[21:33] amen and when he can take that from you
[21:36] he got you staggering like a drunk
[21:39] man no matter how small you are your
[21:43] power is
[21:45] unlimited
[21:47] amen is that right amen the power is
[21:50] unlimited cuz you got God in you amen
[21:54] don't you know if God gave you power and
[21:56] he's omnipotent your power is unlimited
[21:59] cuz your power is of God yes sir
[22:01] hallelujah it's Unlimited in you and I
[22:04] what happens is our minds are not
[22:07] girdled and so we limit God and this way
[22:11] the devil does it he makes it personal
[22:14] he said do you really think God is going
[22:16] to do this for you do you really think
[22:19] he loves you this much and and don't you
[22:23] think amen that what you asking God is
[22:25] just on a maybe a carnal side
[22:29] you know it's like like we read last
[22:31] night do you really think amen this
[22:33] little rat can eat all the Grainery in
[22:35] Egypt that he's got to eat it sparingly
[22:38] you know and that's what's happening to
[22:40] the Christians we have allowed ourselves
[22:43] Amen to become weak because we are weak
[22:46] in our minds we're not feeding it we're
[22:49] not exercising it we're not allowing God
[22:52] to wash it amen to cleanse it amen to to
[22:56] bring us to a place where we can truly
[22:58] recognize who we are you must shed your
[23:03] flesh amen hallelujah you must shed
[23:07] yourself your identity away from your
[23:10] flesh amen amen okay let me put it this
[23:14] way brother brandham talked about that
[23:16] preacher who said I'm not going to serve
[23:18] the Lord anymore he went to drinking and
[23:20] everything and God made him sick and put
[23:22] him to
[23:24] sleep but why didn't his sinning why
[23:27] didn't his drinking sent him to
[23:31] hell cuz he was a son and God said I'll
[23:34] never lose one brother Brandon said that
[23:37] was God chastening his own son for being
[23:40] disobedient oh you better better know

[26:53] Grandpa ain't feeling good would you
[26:54] pray for me guarantee you you get
[26:56] results straight up gu results why they
[26:59] don't have no unbelief they don't know
[27:01] not to believe yes sir that's true right
[27:04] amen it works I'm telling you something
[27:05] that I know
[27:07] work amen so you know that's what that's
[27:10] what the word of God said even if you
[27:12] could come unto God as as a
[27:14] child he said for such is the kingdom
[27:17] why they don't know nothing but Faith
[27:18] they don't they believe whatever you
[27:20] tell them they can do they'll do it
[27:25] amen amen I mean you think about you
[27:28] think about the opposition a lot of us
[27:30] we look at this uh the the scripture and
[27:32] we fail to see you know the opposition
[27:35] Moses had now he was a
[27:38] fugitive he was a
[27:40] fugitive first of all God had to kill
[27:43] his pride amen God had to kill
[27:46] everything about Moses because he left
[27:49] Egypt as a prince and he comes back as a
[27:52] vagabond that what he looked like he was
[27:55] a Shepherd he wasn't wearing fancy
[27:57] clothes Egyptian clothes more than
[27:59] likely sheep skin or something like that
[28:02] something Zapora had been fixed up for
[28:04] him he he goes into that place and he's
[28:07] got to face all his so-called friends
[28:11] and his used to be loved ones with an
[28:14] insane supposedly
[28:17] message God said let my people go now
[28:21] you know they couldn't help but think he
[28:24] was
[28:25] crazy but he had to do it he had to do
[28:29] it and God so designed that man till he
[28:33] was so fully obedient to God God never
[28:38] told him I'm going to take you to AB b c
[28:40] and d God just told him I'm taking you
[28:43] there and you going to they be delivered
[28:45] he never told him how long it was going
[28:47] to take what all he had Moses prayed
[28:51] much amen he prayed much to for God to
[28:56] unveil to him what was the Next
[28:59] Step amen think about it think about how
[29:03] Moses felt amen when Janice and jamb
[29:06] amen uh serpents uh came out of you know
[29:09] the rage he looked just like a magician
[29:12] magician he look like a
[29:15] magician but he knew he wasn't a
[29:17] magician amen hallelujah come on
[29:19] somebody that's what the same thing that
[29:22] took place in our day that's why so many
[29:24] people couldn't see William brand or the
[29:26] prophet of God because he looked like a
[29:28] magician amen he had witches and
[29:31] warlocks doing the same thing he did
[29:33] amen under the ospice of of
[29:39] Christianity Under the Umbrella of
[29:41] Christianity he he was competing and he
[29:44] couldn't tell them I'm the original and
[29:46] they're the
[29:50] fake he tried to tell them but they
[29:52] didn't see it they didn't hear it they
[29:53] didn't believe it but it was Faith
[29:56] listen folks
[30:00] we going to see Jesus Christ amen but
[30:03] I'mma tell you something Hallelujah when
[30:05] you really sit down and think about what
[30:07] the prophet of God had to go through in
[30:10] his day to get this message go listen to
[30:13] uh on the wings of a snow white dove he
[30:17] basically tell you how batter the the
[30:19] dove was how it was
[30:22] wounded but it it made it home the
[30:26] message made it home amen amen and you
[30:29] and I must understand amen it took a lot
[30:32] look brother R was 56 years when we died
[30:35] he looked like he's 70 something years
[30:39] old he was an age looking
[30:42] manen a lot of stress y'all understand
[30:45] what I'm saying you've got to know that
[30:48] you know that you know that you met God
[30:50] Amen to go against the tides that he had
[30:53] to go to amen I'm not glorifying the man
[30:55] but I'm showing you what his faith
[30:57] brought through amen cuz they couldn't
[31:00] even see what he was talking about but
[31:03] we read last night in in the the message
[31:06] they'll be awakened they going to see
[31:08] that this message is right he talks
[31:11] about how it they'll be awakened But the
[31:13] saddest thing is he said it'll be too
[31:14] late when they come to say well you know
[31:17] what that man was right he said at that
[31:19] time it's too
[31:22] late oh my goodness let me tell y'all
[31:25] something you know we look at things and
[31:26] you I'm going to tell you something
[31:27] something so you can understand Joseph
[31:29] against Piper's wife that took
[31:36] something and don't you even think am
[31:38] man that this woman was
[31:40] ugly she probably was one of the best
[31:43] looking women there was in
[31:44] Egypt

[31:50] strength for that man to
[31:53] run so don't tell me you don't have
[31:56] strength to run he did it for you
[31:58] amen you can run if you really want to
[32:01] Hallelujah come on somebody you don't
[32:03] have to fall to all the whms of the
[32:05] enemy but he recognized his God he
[32:08] honored his God he he kept his integrity
[32:11] and he ran no matter what the
[32:14] cost amen amen and look what it cost him
[32:20] by being
[32:21] honest look what it cost him and I'm
[32:24] going to tell you something believe you
[32:25] me I know Christians where they' lost
[32:28] their jobs because they kept their
[32:30] integrity they wouldn't lie for the boss
[32:32] man they wouldn't cover for the boss
[32:35] man hey come on somebody but whenever
[32:38] you stand for God God got a great
[32:40] blessing on the upside come on he's got
[32:43] something special for you that's why he
[32:45] put you there to be tested amen but he's
[32:48] got a real blessing for you amen you
[32:52] might have to suffer a little more like
[32:53] Joseph did but guarantee you when you're
[32:55] at the end of the road
[32:58] you'll be looking down at everybody else
[33:00] and they'll be bowing to
[33:03] you how many of us amen I'm I'm just
[33:06] letting you know about Nero's chopping
[33:10] block we were talking about how the
[33:13] prophet of God was saying you know in
[33:15] that old those old days uh how people
[33:19] would get mad with their wives and
[33:20] husbands or whatever and they shoot in
[33:22] the window and stuff now that happened
[33:24] in one of the organizations that I was
[33:26] in where they actually the husband got
[33:30] so mad cuz his wife was constantly going
[33:32] to church he went to the church and
[33:34] fired in the window the people kept
[33:37] worshiping God and the bullets just
[33:40] dropped to the
[33:43] floor they felt the bullets
[33:46] like and they just fell to the floor
[33:49] needless to say he was
[33:52] converted but my point is amen if a man
[33:56] come up here
[33:57] here with a gun Oh Glory right remember
[34:00] how it was in South America y'all
[34:01] remember that testimony this is a true
[34:03] testimony in The Message Church how a
[34:05] gunsman came into South a church in
[34:07] South America and said everybody that
[34:10] that that uh I'm GNA kill every
[34:12] Christian in here say if you if you want
[34:14] to if you want to die if you you stay if
[34:18] you you know in other words all those
[34:23] Pretenders they left
[34:28] and when all the pretenders left the man
[34:30] put down his gun and said now we can
[34:32] have
[34:35] church Hallelujah that is a true
[34:39] [Applause]
[34:41] story you see because God put you to the
[34:43] test oh if I was a Christ oh hey what do
[34:46] you go after you've shown your
[34:48] colors what do you do I mean this is a
[34:51] message
[34:55] church so my point is amen now God is
[34:58] bringing us to a
[35:00] place here's the question here's what he
[35:03] says fear not little flock brother B
[35:07] said whenever he says it's fear he said
[35:08] there's danger up the road somewhere
[35:11] fear not little flock you know I I think
[35:14] about Paul you know and Paul was such a
[35:17] a warrior for the Lord he he not only
[35:19] went to neero chopping block but you
[35:21] know what how many of us would have
[35:23] gotten on a ship and God done told you
[35:26] it's going to sink you're going to run
[35:28] into a storm that's going to tear the
[35:31] boat up and the only way that you'll be
[35:33] able to
[35:34] survive is that you stay in the
[35:38] boat how many would have got on there
[35:41] y'all hear what I'm saying but God told
[35:44] Paul what was going to take place but he
[35:46] said fear not amen fear not I'll save
[35:49] every last one of you but you got to
[35:51] take the ride
[35:54] amen that's real Faith folks that's real
[35:57] faith fath and that's what God has want
[36:00] us to have we got it we got it like the
[36:02] prophet God said you the worst thing you
[36:04] could do is have it and don't know what
[36:06] to do with it or don't believe you got
[36:08] it oh Lord see because that's what the
[36:10] devil does he spend a lot of time making
[36:12] you believe you don't have it oh Lord my
[36:14] question is then what are you
[36:17] feeding why do you come to church what
[36:20] is that you're feeding amen you can't
[36:23] feed a dead man you can't feed a dead
[36:26] baby what are you feeding
[36:30] them something is
[36:33] living something is living in order for
[36:36] you to feed you said well how do you
[36:39] know well you can't enjoy food if you're
[36:42] dead
[36:45] amen and if you enjoying the word of God
[36:47] that means something in you is enjoying
[36:49] it amen the devil don't enjoy it the
[36:52] devil trembles at
[36:54] it so there's something in you that's
[36:57] living thank you Lord but you got to
[36:59] feed it got to feed it and recognize
[37:01] that is God am and that same God is able
[37:04] to create a world and cause you to live
[37:07] on it amen amen that's why Paul said
[37:10] we're more than
[37:13] conquerors Romans 8:37 says nay in all
[37:17] things we are more than conquerors
[37:20] through him that love us more than
[37:25] conquerors is that right amen let me
[37:27] read you a little quote coming from the
[37:29] principles of Divine Healing he said
[37:32] you're not saved by feelings why the
[37:35] devil can beat you around every stump in
[37:38] the country saying it's by your feelings
[37:41] I'm not saved because I feel like I'm
[37:43] saved I'm saved because God word says
[37:47] I'm saved is that right now that's the
[37:50] same way how we say well first all we
[37:53] get he we get prayed for when you get
[37:56] prayed for healing you heal right right
[37:58] amen it ain't do you feel
[38:02] better yo cuz now you're basing your
[38:04] healing on feelings what if you didn't
[38:06] feel better well it's coming Hallelujah
[38:10] no it's here amen if you prayed it's
[38:12] already here amen praise God Amen
[38:16] Hallelujah right God just corrected me
[38:19] praise the Lord see but when we look at
[38:21] this you and I must understand it is an
[38:24] insult to to to look at God's word and
[38:26] says well you know once I start feeling
[38:28] better I'm
[38:30] Healed that's why a lot of people go to
[38:32] their graves right now because they
[38:33] don't never feel better and they fail to
[38:36] see they already he they God God you got
[38:39] to confess the thing bring it out of
[38:41] your mouth amen amen bring it out of
[38:43] your mouth because if if you can bring
[38:46] it out of your mouth that means it's in
[38:47] your heart and then God can work on it
[38:50] come on somebody bring it out of your
[38:52] mouth I don't care how I feel I don't
[38:54] care it doesn't matter amen if God said
[38:58] I'm Healed I'm Healed right John Ryan

[39:13] to the level to open his eyes amen God

[39:18] all he had to do is constantly say extra
[39:20] extra read all about it I'm heal I wish
[39:23] I had been there brother I wish I had
[39:25] been there when his eyes open in that
[39:27] B's shair and he ran down the
[39:31] street what a Revival what a
[39:34] Revival amen but that's it sometimes
[39:38] your your your feelings hinder your
[39:41] faith and you got to let your faith
[39:43] override your feelings to the point that
[39:46] God can work with it
[39:50] amen you don't have to be afraid of the
[39:52] devil on nothing the word of listen what
[39:55] he goes on he says just a moment the
[39:57] word of God will defeat the Devil any
[40:00] place anywhere anytime on any condition
[40:05] the word amen not not your feeling the
[40:07] word that's right Hallelujah right the
[40:10] Bible said Tim lepers were prayed

[40:27] see they were healed amen but only one
[40:29] came back and said thank you but they

[42:02] get sick that's the only place he can
[42:03] touch you amen hallelujah when Jesus was
[42:06] on Earth the father was with him God was
[42:09] in Christ reconciling the world to
[42:10] himself we believe that all the fine
[42:13] qualities was of the father was in him
[42:16] but when he met Satan look what he did
[42:18] he brought it in your reach and yours
[42:20] and yours and all of you he never used
[42:23] his gift he only used the word
[42:28] so everybody can use it well I ain't got
[42:30] the gift of healing you got the gift of
[42:31] the word amen amen hallelujah I don't
[42:35] have the gift of this I don't have the
[42:36] gift of that but you got The Giver of
[42:38] the gifts who is Jesus Christ himself
[42:43] amen oh ain't that good amen praise God
[42:48] while he come to break listen oh he know
[42:50] he has somebody there besides Eve then

[43:28] that that that we live by every word
[43:31] that's why he gave it to us now you know
[43:33] what I love about this because the the
[43:36] the shortcut to this thing is you get

[43:40] with the Holy Ghost you got all of the
[43:42] word amen amen oh come on somebody you

[43:59] devil upon the written word of God he
[44:02] has God himself manifested in the flesh
[44:04] had power without limit but he never
[44:07] used them what did he do he defeated
[44:09] Satan on the same thing that Satan
[44:11] defeated Eve on amen he pulled the wool
[44:14] over him that time when he whitewashed
[44:17] the word of God to Eve and she believed
[44:19] it but when he come to try to whitewash
[44:21] it with Jesus he failed yes sir he
[44:24] failed because he stayed with the
[44:26] father's word and sayth it is written
[44:29] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[44:31] him only shall thou serve and and and
[44:34] what did he do Satan said he left him

[46:02] a privilege has been given to the Church
[46:04] of the Living God when you fall to your
[46:06] knees in prayer even the Devils tremble
[46:10] to the weakest of them think of it I
[46:12] seen a poor woman here some time ago so
[46:16] completely yielded to the Holy Ghost and
[46:18] he goes on and talking about if you
[46:19] yield to the Holy Ghost and then he
[46:21] talks about that one experience he had
[46:23] when he was young how that that one
[46:25] woman was so possessed by the devil
[46:27] he said she was fully possessed so much
[46:30] the devil talked out of her remember he
[46:32] went to grab her he said she almost
[46:33] snatched him and said he ran and she was
[46:36] crawling on her back like a snake now
[46:40] that's real possession and some of y'all
[46:42] haven't seen that I've seen some real
[46:44] demonic possessed people I'm telling you
[46:46] I've never seen them crawl on their back
[46:48] but I've heard from a precious brother
[46:50] how they even levitated see I'm talking
[46:52] about message people that we've
[46:54] seen and testify
[46:57] Witnesses right but I've seen them make
[47:00] noise and sound like Hogs and pigs and
[47:03] eyes be red as fire and I've seen that
[47:05] and all your hair stand up on you see
[47:08] but you see even then I was a young
[47:10] Christian was I scared I
[47:13] was I ain't G to lie to you I was
[47:16] praying God whatever that is don't let
[47:18] it get on me but God brought me through
[47:21] I didn't know much about what brother
[47:22] bandam said how you had the heart close
[47:24] your eyes I mean I'm watching this thing
[47:26] with one I like oh Lord Jesus I was
[47:30] scared I was scared I mean that that's
[47:34] changed now but back in the day when I
[47:36] was young and I didn't understand it
[47:38] amen yeah yeah it scared
[47:41] me but you know what sometimes I said
[47:44] I've said many times I said
[47:46] Lord Christians need to see that so
[47:50] they'll know devils are real there are
[47:53] so many people that just don't think
[47:56] Satan is real real in that Dimension and
[47:58] he is real in that Dimension he really
[48:03] is amen you love the
[48:05] Lord amen so the law of God is in his
[48:08] heart talks about that in Psalms 37:31
[48:11] and none of his steps shall slide that's
[48:15] when the law word of the Lord is in your
[48:17] heart now that's why it's so important
[48:19] to get the Holy Ghost amen get God in
[48:22] there at whatever cost because the Bible
[48:26] said for what he thinketh in his heart
[48:28] so is he so as you think in your heart
[48:31] that's what you are amen right come on
[48:34] somebody I'm not talking about the devil
[48:36] temped you the devil going to come to
[48:37] your mind and all of that and all of
[48:39] that but when you got something in there
[48:41] that you got to do that you know it's
[48:43] evil you know something is
[48:46] wrong amen y'all got quiet on me amen he
[48:49] said The only person that's supposed to
[48:51] be in that heart right now Jesus Christ
[48:53] and I want you to know he don't have
[48:54] roommates amen thank you Lord he don't
[48:58] have roommates folks amen amen because
[49:00] you and not supposed to die right and
[49:02] that room supposed to be only for him
[49:04] swept clean garnish and purified for God
[49:07] Alone is that right at that day you'll
[49:10] know I'm in the father ye in me and I in
[49:14] you and everyone as us will say I'm in
[49:17] God but then if that be the case that
[49:20] means he's in you that that's what he
[49:22] just said right he said at that day you
[49:25] know I am in the father ye in me and I
[49:27] in you so if we're in him he's in us
[49:31] hallelujah right that's that's the only
[49:33] way it works amen you can't be in him
[49:36] and he's not in
[49:38] you see so if he's and that's that's the
[49:41] whole thing I was telling the church
[49:43] last night in Bible study I said our
[49:45] problem is we've been educated too much
[49:48] see that's what they did to the
[49:50] denomination they educate they use the
[49:52] very word of God to educate them and
[49:56] instead of getting into a rebirth see
[49:59] and the saddest part about the whole
[50:01] thing is that education that we've got
[50:04] we got so many deep
[50:07] Revelations but that same kind of
[50:09] education the way it's been excuse me
[50:11] brought has also killed our
[50:14] faith it brought it brings us to a place
[50:17] where our faith is not up to par amen
[50:21] see we got it so much up here but the
[50:23] experiences of it is not there see you
[50:26] see what I'm saying and it's only when
[50:28] it's here I believe God I know God I you
[50:32] know and it's and it's and it's all
[50:34] right I I put it to this put it like
[50:36] this you know you take a child amen that
[50:39] has been given
[50:41] everything I mean they GNA be proud
[50:43] heady High minded you name it but you
[50:46] take that little child and they're not
[50:47] going to appreciate the
[50:49] inheritance but you take an adopted
[50:51] child or some child that you've adopted
[50:53] and you put them into that environment
[50:55] and as they mature they're going to
[50:56] really really see where they came from
[51:00] and where they are now and they will
[51:01] really appreciate now I'm talking about
[51:03] a good character child I ain't talking
[51:04] about you know what I'm saying and
[51:06] that's what God is expecting us to see
[51:08] amen now Israel wasted their
[51:11] inheritance they did they threw it away
[51:14] and God chooses a bride for himself and
[51:17] he brings you through all of this mck
[51:19] and Mary he brings you up like a lily
[51:22] like he would bring a Lily and then he
[51:24] comes and he gives you all of this is
[51:27] he's expecting us to appreciate
[51:31] it and act upon what he's given to us
[51:37] amen St John 14:20 at that day you
[51:40] should know I'm in the father ye me and
[51:42] I in you St John 15:4 said abide in me
[51:46] and I in you and as the branch cannot
[51:48] bear fruit of itself except it bide in
[51:50] the vine no more can ye except you abide
[51:54] in the vine in me is that right so
[51:57] abiding in him is what makes you live
[52:00] what makes you bring forth fruit amen

[1:02:18] before us Paul spoke this our heavenly
[1:02:21] father over there in the book of the
[1:02:23] Hebrews that we should lay aside every
[1:02:25] weight in the 12th chapter that he spoke
[1:02:27] that after he already showed by example
[1:02:30] back there those who did go on those who
[1:02:33] did go on those who lukewarmly followed
