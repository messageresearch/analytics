revelation hallelujah oh i've got the revelation [Music] here's how i got that [Music] hallelujah praise your name god is good to us thank the lord well we got a few people excited this morning amen we thank god for his grace in his mercy surely god is good to us oh wow as we stand i'm going to ask that you turn with us to the book of revelation for those of you who have was with us on wednesday we preached on a view of the uh a greater dimension so by god's grace we want to do a like a part two of that palagas de june of london and we want to minister on john come up here so i ask that you turn with us to revelations the fourth chapter beginning at the first verse we read the first two verses of that chapter glad to see everybody here seeing that yesterday was the first day of spring premiere was hoping to see more people out just on well i see the weather don't bring them out either so so uh let's start beginning at the first verse after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter. it is that's revelations four that was one we're going to read the second verse now and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne right on and we're going to read philippians 2. philippians philippians 2. you love the lord was it medicine here philippians the second chapter beginning at the fifth verse philippians let this mind be in you which was in i mean which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god existing from the jews let us pray father god we come before you belgium father we pray this morning that you speak through this vessel of clay we we say that if there be anything we have done today and desire jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated as well we know by god's grace did you that god spoke to john paul and the prophet god said that john represented the bride of jesus christ of christ we left off on wednesday and we were working with the way that we think uh le mercedes under when i thought on the scripture according to revelations four concept in order for god to show him those things that were to come hereafter and when in reading this only [Music] we talked about the mechanism is another dimension it is a substance substance we cannot see you couldn't just compromise that in hallelujah now romans 12 and 2. uh oh man i do it the bible says and be not conformed to this world conformity transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove i think of what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god agreeable hallelujah hallelujah showing that the mind in itself renewed which is in heaven is perfect and we have never come in to understand what that perfection is in the era of loose luther they had a portion of the word but not enough to bring them to perfection in the era of wesley i lay out the the wesley which was sanctification they had a portion of the word but it could never bring them to perfection the pentecostal age which was the baptism of the holy ghost they had enough of the word uh you could never bring them to perfection and how did we try to perfect ourselves it fail and we failed just like the jews did by way of law fluency everything they could do but the ability to perfect yourself it's not with you it's in a perfect world god is the only one who can perfect you keep it perfect your name but this is why a lot of christians are miserable and you become a miserable christian and as long as you work under that yeah you will always be miserable hallelujah you'll that's right because men interpret the word even though the messengers got their portion right there soon man has always wanted to control other men hallelujah and in this sense this is what lucifer did lucifer wanted a higher position than [Music] is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is liberty hallelujah hallelujah be not conformed to this world there's never conformity when jesus the church had confirmed themselves legally taken for me right after babylon hallelujah they had the traditions of babylon that was greater than the other and then he said that's the way the gentiles think hey like somebody help much longer than somebody else you feel like you have an authority over them who was greater than them all the thing is we must elevate our thoughts is standing [Applause] we're not hallelujah we have made great men of the messages and what have we done i'm going to tell you you may not agree with what i'm saying but i know what i'm saying you got to understand the different components i'm trying to set us free enough you just said because we think let me let me say something the bible said be transformed there's a difference between transforming yeah in defense and transforming it me hallelujah hallelujah you can conform to anything stupid for me but it doesn't mean your heart is in it don't curse what i'm saying you can put all the laws in front of a man the man who can transform they wear the same uniform important and if you're not on this diet you none of yours well who is here the bible says the lord knoweth them that are here no man this is why the thunders had the right is that right see god wants us in his line of thinking for an example common example when god told saul conjured yes i want you to kill a gag and all of them this is where y'all hear what i'm saying don't tell mike's apology so when he what are you doing brother brooks i'm trying to get you into a heavenly atmosphere she said it was some neat hallelujah this message came to do one thing so recession that is to make you know who you are and the only way that the message can ever do this for you is disobeyed uh samuel hallelujah he didn't realize he was literally disobeying god what did he do now when you take your own thoughts don't you point the apocalypse and exalted above the world you're taking a higher position in position that is the inspiration of lucifer you understand what i'm saying so what did god say that's good to saul uh so you he literally took the kingdom why brother branham because brother brother was a prophet he was designed to catch the thoughts of god or design and deliver them to the people the upon the capital [Music] what the methodist thought it's called when the pentecostal told them another day what you have now won't work basically that's what brother brian told us that's his subscription he said the pentecostal message cannot work for this age we'll sit down hello hello and if it doesn't work we need to find out what's going to work they want to wake [Music] the bible says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts uh so you can understand it's a book of company everybody with me this morning you're gonna miss something you won't make a rapture i'm telling you myself you'll never find yourself working even though you found you know the scripture the bible said there was no man found worthy of everything because we were thinking bring us back to the proper way [Music] to the god of eden before before that like i don't have the mind of god i feel that possibility i knew he was a god i don't know adam knew i don't want to be at least and they will begin to control he we see you you have to understand whatever component if the bible says let this mind because she should have been somebody must let it be it can't do all this when god said let there be light like there was light that's what they call it somebody must let it is condemned you know we believe many of us believe in a trinitarian way like the holy ghost got less power than god okay uh but you gotta understand the holy ghost is god the vocal point sentence hallelujah somebody help me y'all understand what i'm trying to say until you recognize what you have you can't defeat them hallelujah hallelujah listen you know how you defeat the devil by inspiration holy ghost inspiration amen just to show you jesus he was saul amen who was elected by the people he was king of israel hallelujah but when goliath came saul was afraid and he tried to put his mind he like said he met him save right his way of thinking david you need to protect yourself hallelujah but david was the under the inspiration of god he knew he didn't he couldn't protect himself but he knew the protector and when and and when saul wanted to run he has anointed [Music] do i walk through the valley in the shadow of death memphis is your master i will feel no evil why because thou art with me david understood that god was with him as long as you stay in the inspiration you see what happens is between jacob and esau look like the right one hallelujah who the right one is but you got to love everybody i'm coming to everybody [Music] and the only person that can give you a gopro jesus christ himself hallelujah see coming up higher monty doesn't mean i've got to learn all of this message upon the two to the message of the [Music] you out here for some kind of mischievous thing but david looked at him definitely that's all they're not a cause israel is being defeated israel circumstances politicians [Music] that's one thing i loved about brother branham his ministry came to [Music] is hallelujah the more education you get the farther away you go hey please we want you till one hallelujah now we may have some educated people but there are so many education dedicated ones the junkies think that their intellect listen i want you to understand that the book of accompaniment god reveals himself in simplicity what in the world are you talking about the first thing you must come to understand hallelujah what your purpose is here on objective and let me say it like that's because your purpose is in this world it's to prove see the moment that your and so what god did in this last day is could you have faith in israel he came to bring family to its position [Music] [Music] see god didn't come to bring this message and make it a religion a prominent message jesus could love faith hallelujah now i'm preaching a little different but it's true oh yes it's mama's religion that is religion so oh my god right you must be born again you are first but you'll never get the holy ghost thinking you're going to present righteousness to god but you know apologetics y'all understand me you're going to go before the throne of god holy the angels in heaven says holy holy holy never seen the crying holy they're covered they're dirty [Music] yes i'm accepting your mercy i want you to justify me [Music] god don't care about your denominations jesus who your pastor is he's on food i'm on the pastor so-and-so what difference does that mean it's a pastel you don't even know where the pastor's so-and-so right now is men of authority you got to understand you're looking at your failures it's what gideon did regarding and god had to correct gideon i'm going to read that judge 6 12. you love the lord and move listen but it ain't the way god was looking at him we have those earthly mentalities a lot of us are in the place that we are in this book because of the way we were raised they right because if you tell a child you know complexes complex because revelation but he saw that woman with the purple nails thank god god keeps the record he knows what the problem is and declare something to be true brother said lord how can you put up with this this kind of way you need to wipe her off the face of the earth your thoughts are not my thoughts on my point your thoughts are not mine the punching is something god don't look at conditions god look at seed conditions and we declare it's not seen and he looked at that woman that's it i gotta sit him he told brother ben let me show you something less questions you think you hired by the same blood it just survived by the same grace hallelujah like they say the pot can't call the cattle black electric uh the part can't call them playing that you understand when they both black they both black they can't know it's not too small you see what i'm saying you you can't judge sinners are sinners they perpetually preacher you could be a religious sinner yep but you said it religion and all sinners need to be saved and the only way they can be saved [Music] when jesus is in the room the car my my my favorites all those big heavy satellites and she had all whatever clothes she had on was that everything hanging out in the back it do it on friday and i did just what y'all some of y'all doing laughing but it wasn't a laughing situation my way of thinking wasn't correct he's on hallelujah see we must that's how we're going to win so come seconds to give you another illustration before i get to gideon but he jesus never cared about one word the jews would have looked at her as though she was dirt when you talk to a homeless person that's because you're discouraged you talk to somebody amanda uh um brother adam come for up on them begin to witness to the lady come on timonia like i said it changed your atmosphere and when jesus began to talk to the miracles like there's [Music] you know and he asked her hey you had and the one that you got is not your own solutions you shall in no wise enter in or not because the pharisees was all about law basically foreign else there's some division i'm going to say wrong if jesus can stoop weakness to jesus but i'm gonna wash um [Music] did gideon know that that's because no no no he did not know because he had a low self-esteem uh did not see god moving he assumed that god wasn't with him either so you let me see but let me tell you unity perfectly god promised you man will i forsake you exactly what he means exactly this befall on us did not the lord bring us from egypt did not god bring us out of the nomination whatever the lord has forsaken us unto the hands of the millionaires [Music] is the thing that confuses them life is shouting and dancing you can get at least making noise i'm sorry you can get a tin can in order to make noise [Music] i never had an intimate relationship what they do am i making sense this morning so what what happened we're allowing ourselves [Music] god that's where david uh is saying all of his songs hallelujah to the glory of god you understand me people came to know the invisible gods so he didn't have a denominational teaching so let me say this and let's go this comes your experiences with god this experience is the greater teacher say is elevate yourself i know i'm going along because i left some of y'all not coming back this evening anyway so i'm going to tell you what brothers had to do we must think like king's sons hallelujah you remember the slave story about the young man who was the son of a king get it on found out and though he was away from home he knew he was the son of a king hallelujah and though we are away from home it doesn't matter what everybody else is is now if the bible and this is what gets me it's there are so many people who who don't read their bibles you know the message a new book because god did something to your mind he elevated your way of thinking so when you look at the scripture you're not talking about god yesterday you're not talking about or reading about god tomorrow you're reading about god today that's why hebrews 13 jesus christ but when you read the book you're not reading a historical book you're reading a book that is now and leaving again tells you what your potentials are we still have denominational thoughts ruling uh amen amen it's a long one so hold hold on i'm verily i say unto you he shall say to this mountain be moved depressive plucked up and cast into the sea and don't is you shall have it not me but one you shall have what the power has given to the church he said what power has been given to the church that now you can express it by mental conception conception but if it becomes a real revelation of god see until your thoughts become his thoughts jesus christ direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's removing your moral being oh my god what kind of people should we be john the person if the very holy [Music] expressing itself kind of a church we would be yeah what kind of a people would get this morning this it says brown on the tabernacle but i'm going to say higher ground tabernacles higher ground tabernacle was so filled with the presence of god when you didn't even use your own mind but just be so led by the spirit and they that are sons of god is circus are led by the spirit of god you suck on you probably spiritually then when the human element is out saul and the spirit of god fueled that vacancy where you're empty where you empty yourself that's the key [Music] amen amen then we'll be then we'll be when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the lord jesus our resurrection will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts [Music] they call it glitch the crystal the holy spirit consent this week mankind's away from themselves that they don't see themselves tickets of whiteboard they have they don't have no in you know but just but but to serve god selfie or jew and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit in the spirit holy spirit love in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of christ in the love of christ in the human heart bring in the past are completely the thought of their mind they love imagination now i don't know about you as in but i can't quit until i see that just ask us i'm not waiting on a group effort for the group every man forms yeah ma'am that's gonna be a company let me let me close with this thought is your vape uh this portion of excesses is it possible all god needs one man or one woman the task may look difficult the task may look hard moses when he was told by god i'm sending you down the pharaoh egypt for thousands and this was you know but god promoted him in egypt even though he stuttered well i backed that up brother branham says the poorer made him stutter [Laughter] yeah yeah what he said two strong-willed people two strong-willed people oh the jump that's your fault god put them together they're they're dirty on fall drill is that me on something y'all know what that's like they're probably both saying at night to themselves lord how you let me marry her uh she said lord how you let me marry him at the same time god was modern character y'all hear what i'm saying that's why i said it's never it's never like where did it appear to be is never always the truth and he didn't want to go but then his mind was changed yeah if i go go to pharaoh and moisture they're gonna kill realized he was more than a what they call those uh uh not a refugee um anyway he realized he was more than just a a man a man being haunted because the same man who didn't want to die for israel in the beginning when god said to him move out the way let's get started kill them [Music] [Applause] [Music] i still wonder what they do every time i hear that it really makes me feel really small this afternoon 11. just keep on praying for the lord is nigh just keep on praying hear your cries oh the lord has fought that and his word is true just keep on praying keep on praying yes sir and his word is true let's keep on praying he'll [Music] and his word is true at the midnight hour yes sir for the lord is nigh at the midnight i will whoa he'll hear your cry and his word is true just keep on praying answer you just keep on believing for the lord is nigh [Music] just keep on believing hear your cry oh the lord [Music] amen he has to answer he dwell upon him hallelujah do you realize that's good he said this for a word heaven and earth will pass away from how do you feel like you're going to get up come
