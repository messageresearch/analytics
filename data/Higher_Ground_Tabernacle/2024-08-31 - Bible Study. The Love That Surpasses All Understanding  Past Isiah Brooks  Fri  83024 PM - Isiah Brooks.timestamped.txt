[6:10] us
[6:12] our that's what Christians
[6:21] areel
[6:26] connect I am are
[6:37] now we know by the grace of God we have
[6:39] the Holy Ghost but you got to understand
[6:43] in order for God to have a complete flow
[6:46] through you you got to unstop the vows
[6:50] you know because a lot of vows have been
[6:52] sto stopped up and clogged up in
[6:54] whatever the case may be but those
[6:56] things can be cleared out and clear
[7:28] e e
[8:04] and that life must be exemplified
[8:06] through us we can't be like them we have
[8:10] to be better than they are there's an
[8:12] echo somewhere
[8:29] GL
[8:59] start
[9:36] orever of the season and if we are trees
[9:40] the Holy Ghost in US is telling us the
[9:43] sign of the Time of the Season I mean we
[9:46] don't have to look at the the television
[9:48] set or anything else the broadcast
[9:50] systems whatever they doing we don't
[9:53] have to look at that to determine the
[9:56] season if something in US tells us that
[10:00] and and let me say it like this it told
[10:02] Enoch yes sir it told Enoch amen what
[10:06] time it was and the Bible said Enoch
[10:08] walk with God hallelujah see so I'm I'm
[10:11] telling you that this message has is is
[10:14] in a place is telling us the season and
[10:17] the time or the season that we're living
[10:20] in is rapturing time it's time to mature
[10:24] and it's time to love one another in
[10:27] spite of all of our differences
[10:29] amen because remember God put the
[10:32] differences there yes
[10:34] sir every one of us are made different
[10:38] in some way or another even though we be
[10:40] human beings amen right and each one of
[10:43] us can testify that we receive the holy
[10:46] ghost in a different manner amen that's
[10:48] right but you got it amen you see what
[10:51] I'm saying so anyway so we must be
[10:54] connected and something told him within
[10:57] him there is a city and he started
[10:59] looking for it and said I'm a pilgrim a
[11:02] stranger and I'm looking for a city
[11:04] whose Builder and maker is God he know
[11:08] the city was somewhere and that's what
[11:11] brother said where where Abraham stopped
[11:14] he said the city was right above him
[11:17] amen ain't that amazing in the spiritual
[11:20] realm in another dimension the city was
[11:23] there so we must understand by the grace
[11:25] of God that that that what you're
[11:28] feeling that that you're getting amen is
[11:31] not in your mind it's the spirit of God
[11:34] telling you it's about that time
[11:38] amen endeavoring that means you got to
[11:41] work for it you got to work hard huj you
[11:43] know it doesn't just come easy right you
[11:46] know and and you know and I know how
[11:49] arts and problems and everything comes
[11:52] and everything but the Bible said don't
[11:54] let no Bitter
[11:56] Root abide in you ameny try to keep
[11:59] yourself as clean as you possibly can
[12:02] and when I say that it doesn't matter
[12:04] how much you hurt the pain in itself is
[12:07] a part of the
[12:09] process you can't grow without pain amen
[12:13] right and and it's pain sometime you can
[12:15] you feel like you can't bear it highly
[12:17] bear it but it's what God has placed on
[12:20] you and I think about the cross and how
[12:24] Jesus you know set his face like a flint
[12:28] he knew the season he knew the time when
[12:30] they tried to kill him at an early stage
[12:32] he wouldn't allow it to happen because
[12:34] he knew what was prophesied of him and
[12:36] the things that he was supposed to go
[12:38] through in order to achieve uh his
[12:41] purpose in life in this world so we see
[12:45] these things but we must understand that
[12:48] we're one unit amen one unit can I say
[12:52] it like that one body baptized into that
[12:56] one body by one spirit amen and you'll
[13:00] never see this my hand slapping my
[13:04] face if this hand starts slapping my
[13:07] face you know I need some
[13:09] medication it's not a normal thing your
[13:13] body works together left hand right hand
[13:17] and the right hand never scorns the left
[13:19] hand amen right and the left hand never
[13:22] scorns the right hand amen they all work
[13:25] together and this is what we must learn
[13:27] how to do by the holy
[13:29] Spirit can I say it like this the Holy
[13:32] Ghost in you in me will lead you and
[13:35] guide you into what all truth all truth
[13:38] doesn't mean just
[13:40] knowledge it it it brings you into the
[13:43] Life of Christ this is what it's all
[13:46] about it's not the great depths of the
[13:49] mystery it's coming to know that in this
[13:52] day that same Jesus is living in you
[13:56] Hallelujah performing The Works that he
[13:58] wants to be perform amen and as you
[14:00] heard me say on Wednesday you might be
[14:03] the boy with just a few Fish and Loaves
[14:06] that's all you was ordained to do you
[14:08] might be the woman that God told to put
[14:10] two pennies in the in the plate you were
[14:13] born and raised and God protected you
[14:16] until you put the two pennies in the
[14:18] plate then you never heard no more about
[14:20] her am you understand me it ain't that
[14:22] you got to be raising the dead and
[14:24] casting out Devils everybody's not
[14:26] gifted for that but every body has a
[14:30] purpose and whatever that purpose it
[14:32] could be just just as humble as all get
[14:35] out like brother Bram had neighbors who
[14:38] was kind to him amen and he said they'll
[14:41] be there amen that's right see so you
[14:44] you you know they may not even come to
[14:46] the knowledge of the message but because
[14:49] they were good to
[14:50] you they'll be there Hallelujah and we
[14:53] don't we don't have to figure that out
[14:56] that's God's business amen that's right
[14:58] see but when the people see life in
[15:02] you and and and everybody wants to live
[15:05] everybody wants to smile believe you me
[15:08] everybody loves to be happy amen it is a
[15:11] thing right and when people see you as a
[15:14] happy Christian cuz a lot of Christians
[15:17] are Christians but they're not happy
[15:19] amen that's but when they see happy
[15:22] Christian it
[15:24] draws people to you amen right they
[15:28] can't they want to find out what this
[15:30] light is and like like I said even on
[15:32] that plane when that lady said I see a
[15:34] light you know she saw a light on me
[15:37] which I wasn't aware of it but somehow
[15:40] God opened her eyes to see and that's
[15:43] how it is and I know witches devils and
[15:46] all see light and they know who you are
[15:50] by the light you shine or
[15:52] reflect right listen the Bible says this
[15:56] second uh excuse me Colossians I'm back
[15:59] to my my point here Colossians
[16:28] sometime charity is is taken into a
[16:31] position where people say it's just
[16:33] being good to somebody amen just being
[16:35] good to somebody but love is more than
[16:38] just being good to somebody amen right
[16:41] it kind of like water things down the
[16:44] the the the the direct word of that word
[16:47] charity is love which is divine love
[16:52] right so Paul is telling you know the
[16:55] Ephesians you've got to Endeavor you got
[16:58] to worked to keep it because you got to
[17:01] understand you got the devil on every
[17:03] side anybody know what I'm talking about
[17:05] right I had battles today anybody was ex
[17:08] was exempt anybody no no no you going to
[17:11] have battles every day but it's your job
[17:15] to keep the devil off yes amen you must
[17:18] pray you must allow God to uh uh keep a
[17:22] wall of fire about you amen right
[17:25] because we realize what what makes the
[17:27] Holy Ghost kind of move away from us
[17:30] when we make an error and don't correct
[17:32] it Amen brother BR said the holy spirit
[17:35] will move off like on another Branch
[17:38] until you make it right then he'll move
[17:40] right in amen see he'll never leave you
[17:43] you'll never be out of his
[17:45] sight he can't it's impossible but he
[17:49] will step aside until you get right with
[17:52] him amen right he did it to the prophet
[17:55] you're a hypocrite make it right
[17:58] then you go pray that's the way it
[18:02] works any questions any comments okay go
[18:06] ahead
[18:07] brother um if I may say so I believe
[18:11] that you know thinking about Love U it's
[18:16] it's almost like how let's just take the
[18:19] city there's a there's a substation of
[18:23] Powerhouse that provides the power to
[18:26] this city and if one point in the city
[18:31] if there's a breakdown it stops the
[18:34] power that's wonderful and God is the
[18:37] PowerHouse of his people yes and if
[18:41] there's a breakdown within his people it
[18:44] everyone suffers that's true that's true
[18:46] and also I believe that's very closely
[18:49] connected with Fellowship because love
[18:53] and fellowship is like a Dynamo yes sir
[18:55] the more love the more Fellowship
[18:57] absolutely Fellowship
[18:59] and it goes and it goes and it goes and
[19:01] grows and grows and grows like a
[19:03] snowball absolutely rolling down a hill
[19:06] and Gathering more and more snow that's
[19:08] true and I believe that we we have a lot
[19:11] of
[19:14] breakdowns because that's true brother
[19:16] you're being right it's only right put
[19:18] myself in that also but but I really do
[19:21] believe the love and the and the
[19:25] fellowship just perpetuates itself The
[19:28] More Love the more Fellowship more
[19:29] Fellowship the more love that's true and
[19:32] I think that's what we have to focus on
[19:36] I think that's a good point it's a real
[19:38] good
[19:39] point anyway did everybody hear what he
[19:42] said it is so true and I think I love
[19:44] that analysis brother because it's
[19:46] absolutely the truth and that's why the
[19:49] Bible said contend for the faith you
[19:51] have to fight for it and and the faith
[19:54] is one faith not your faith my faith and
[19:56] somebody else's Faith the faith is God
[19:59] is love amen yeah and we must learn how
[20:03] to like he said I I believe that to be
[20:05] true the more love the more Fellowship
[20:07] the more Fellowship the more love and
[20:08] the thing about it that's why Satan put
[20:10] these things in our minds and our
[20:12] Spirits oh this one is this this one is
[20:14] that this one is this and when we don't
[20:16] fight against that if we accept his
[20:18] gospel how do you know it's the devil
[20:21] when it's always negative amen if it's
[20:25] negative more than likely it's the devil
[20:28] amen
[20:30] and and we must learn how to fight
[20:32] negative thoughts and put it behind us
[20:35] or if you feel like something is going
[20:38] wrong you got to start talking or
[20:40] praying somehow you keep Satan off you
[20:43] so that you can be free y'all know what
[20:45] I'm saying there's nothing like being
[20:47] free you're free in your thoughts you're
[20:49] free in your life right and I agree with
[20:52] that brother that's true and I believe
[20:53] with all my heart that the more we pray
[20:56] because I don't
[20:57] think personally I I I I I think prayer
[21:01] is where cuz you know have you ever felt
[21:03] when you pray and you've had a good
[21:05] prayer feel like you love everybody amen
[21:09] you just feel like there's a love
[21:10] there's something just just pulsating
[21:13] through you and the reason why we we're
[21:15] not seeing because people are not
[21:16] praying amen but the people that pray
[21:21] they have a connection with God that
[21:23] makes them have connection with the
[21:25] people but those who don't pray the
[21:28] connection is
[21:29] broken and this is why we're
[21:32] suffering from with
[21:34] Fellowship suffering with loving one
[21:37] another you know it's there but we have
[21:40] to learn how to stir the Kool-Aid up
[21:42] like I said right let the peace of God
[21:45] rule in your heart to which also ye are
[21:49] called in one body and be ye thankful
[21:53] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[21:56] richly in all what wisdom
[21:59] teaching and admonishing one another in
[22:01] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[22:03] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[22:06] Lord listen and whatsoever ye do in word
[22:10] or deed if you can't do it in word or
[22:12] deed in the name of Jesus Christ is not
[22:15] of God
[22:18] Amen giving thanks to God and the father
[22:22] by him right so what are we doing we are
[22:26] coming to a place where what God wants
[22:29] us to
[22:30] fight to keep Satan out amen keep him
[22:35] out of your mind keep him out of your
[22:37] spirit right most of all keep him away
[22:40] from your flesh yes sir because what
[22:43] we're here to do we're here to show the
[22:47] light of God right now here brother
[22:50] brandom speaks and I'm I'm come like I
[22:52] said I wasted not wasted but I got up
[22:54] behind time but you you guys don't mind
[22:57] listen
[22:58] I'm going to read this John 17:3 says
[23:01] this is life eternal that they might
[23:04] Know Thee the only true God and Jesus
[23:09] Christ whom thou has sent amen listen to
[23:12] what that what he's saying here this is
[23:16] life eternal that they might what Know
[23:20] Thee amen eternal life is knowing God
[23:23] Amen the true God and knowing Jesus
[23:27] Christ whom thou sent amen that's what
[23:30] eternal life is it's like I I think I
[23:33] know him no it's knowing him and he he
[23:37] and and and and him knowing you amen
[23:39] right now here Jesus is saying I do
[23:43] nothing in myself but what I see the
[23:45] father doing and God was in Christ
[23:48] reconciling the world to himself God had
[23:51] confined himself to one body do y
[23:55] confined himself to one body that was
[23:58] was his son through the death of his son
[24:01] brought God to the entire church
[24:04] Universal through the sanctifying power
[24:06] of the Holy Ghost through the blood of
[24:09] Christ cleanses mortal man and make them
[24:12] not in themselves but by the grace of
[24:15] God through his grace makes them subject
[24:18] to the holy spirit that he talks and
[24:22] walks and preaches and acts through his
[24:24] church his Vine or his branches that
[24:28] connected in him that's you understand
[24:32] me and so Paul is trying to tell us how
[24:34] to continue to be connected it ain't
[24:38] about just you it's about a body amen
[24:43] that's how we keep connected not with
[24:46] just me it's about a
[24:48] body right and and you got to understand
[24:51] God put you in this body or in this
[24:53] little Fellowship amen and we are to
[24:55] stay connected in God by staying
[24:58] connected Ed with each other am and it
[25:00] go back to what brother brother Rich
[25:02] says more Fellowship more love he said
[25:07] it's not me that doeth the works it's my
[25:10] father that dwelleth in me he that doeth
[25:13] the work I do nothing myself but what he
[25:17] tells me to do or show me to do show me
[25:20] to do so Jesus must have no other way to
[25:24] make the scriptures right then Jesus had
[25:27] to see visions of what the father's will
[25:30] was to do then he went and done it if
[25:34] you read the and read the preceding text
[25:37] of that you find that it's true for he
[25:40] could not have passed great multitudes
[25:43] of lame blind Hal and wilter and went to
[25:46] one man laying on a pallet and healed
[25:49] him for he knew he had been in the
[25:51] condition he had been in that condition
[25:53] for many years now we find out then that
[25:56] he was just walked at the father guided
[25:59] and directed him now the lesson to us is
[26:04] this everything that we
[26:09] do in the spiritual aspect is supposed
[26:12] to be by God led by God Amen not your
[26:16] feelings led by God Amen right and so
[26:21] when you're led by God is because you
[26:23] have stayed connected with God and being
[26:27] connected with God you know what God
[26:29] wants you to do right like God said call
[26:32] that sister call that
[26:35] brother right you don't even know why
[26:37] but you know you need to amen and we
[26:41] those little voice don't you understand
[26:42] me when you're faithful unto little God
[26:44] will give you much amen if you just do
[26:47] those little things then you find out
[26:49] your ministry becomes
[26:51] greater one way or
[26:54] another it becomes greater
[26:58] now how many of y'all pray for your
[27:00] pastors Hallelujah good for
[27:04] you because I'm sure God tells you to
[27:06] pray for me that he tells me to pray for
[27:08] you amen that's how the chain
[27:11] works that's how the connection works
[27:15] and we must Endeavor because I'm going
[27:17] tell you something it is Satan's job to
[27:21] steal kill and destroy it is Satan job
[27:26] to come into a house and divided because
[27:29] he knows that if a house is divided it
[27:32] cannot stand and when I'm talking about
[27:35] A House Divided I'm not talking about
[27:36] your personal house but it can be your
[27:38] personal house I'm talking about the
[27:39] Church of God Amen my question is where
[27:43] are the
[27:45] people even tonight amen it's because
[27:49] the breakage the power breakage right
[27:53] all right I'm going just go back to the
[27:55] Ephesians here
[27:58] Ephesians 3
[28:07] 19-21 you could never love a person too
[28:10] much not with the love of God that's
[28:13] right can I say that
[28:16] again you can never love a person too
[28:19] much with the love of God because his
[28:22] love is past understanding
[28:25] amen and when you feel like you got it
[28:27] all under control or you understand
[28:29] exactly what it's all about no you don't
[28:33] amen love breaks barriers you know that
[28:37] we've been taught that in the scripture
[28:39] when you when we had the the the the U
[28:43] Samaritan and and and and and the Jew
[28:45] how they they crossed
[28:48] over you know when the when the when the
[28:50] rabbis and the priests saw the man
[28:52] beaten and
[28:53] lamed they cross they cross over they
[28:56] didn't want to get defiled they didn't
[28:57] want to be defiled defil and here was a
[28:59] Samaritan who was considered
[29:01] defiled comes and he helps the man amen
[29:05] that's right paid his hotel bill and his
[29:07] you know doctor bill and everything else
[29:10] you understand me now God puts that in
[29:13] there because being religious doesn't
[29:15] bring you into a connection with God
[29:17] that's right being connected with God is
[29:20] knowing how to hear from God and obey
[29:22] his
[29:23] command and sometime God will tell you
[29:26] to do things that seem to be stupid Amen
[29:28] to your reasoning but at that time it's
[29:31] the right thing to
[29:33] do right Ephesians 9 excuse me 31 19- 21
[29:39] and to know the love of Christ which
[29:41] passes knowledge that he might be filled
[29:44] with the fullness of God now unto him
[29:48] that is able to do exceedingly
[29:50] abundantly above all that we ask or
[29:53] think according to the power that
[29:56] worketh where in US
[29:59] us you see this is what and and this is
[30:01] where the devil gets us all the time
[30:04] here God trying to bring us to
[30:05] Perfection right well how you going to
[30:08] be how God going to bring you to
[30:10] Perfection if you still limiting him
[30:12] with these Natural Things amen you you
[30:15] limiting God here how you expect to get
[30:18] there amen the scripture says he's he's
[30:21] he he he'll do now to him that is able
[30:24] to do exceedingly abundantly above
[30:28] am beyond your comprehension that's
[30:31] right and that's why brother said don't
[30:32] don't pray for the little things pray
[30:34] for big things am we act like God can't
[30:37] do big things it's like when God heals
[30:41] somebody from the cancer like it's such
[30:43] a great miracle that ain't even a drop
[30:46] in the bucket that's right yet we act
[30:50] like this is something
[30:51] fantastic it's
[30:53] not only in this Dimension we make it
[30:56] like that because somehow our unbelief
[30:58] become belief amen that's right but God
[31:02] wants us to have faith in his word if he
[31:06] says it that's the only thing that's
[31:07] going to make us mature you can't doubt
[31:10] God's word and think you're going to
[31:13] mature no you mature with faith
[31:16] believing God's word standing on his
[31:19] word no matter what amen right and when
[31:23] you stand on God's word guess what
[31:25] you're going to be do what's going to
[31:26] happen to you you're going to be
[31:27] challenged
[31:28] that's
[31:32] right whether it be sick sickness social
[31:36] whatever the case may be you're going to
[31:38] be challenged and
[31:41] sometimes sometimes the battles are so
[31:43] great is almost like a spirit of
[31:45] confusion comes into your mind
[31:47] amen yeah I don't know what I'm
[31:52] doing I'm speaking about myself I mean
[31:55] it does it brings you into a confus
[31:58] usion we're not the only one when the
[32:00] power when the pressure came on Moses he
[32:02] got
[32:03] confused he start crying out like
[32:05] everybody else you know God had to shake
[32:09] him a little bit wake up you know and
[32:11] put him right back in the in in in in
[32:13] the grid where where you're supposed to
[32:15] be and you and I must understand we
[32:17] cannot I don't know how to say it what I
[32:21] do know is that the more you encourage
[32:23] some somebody the more encouraged they
[32:26] become amen
[32:28] thank you Lord when you when you speak
[32:30] positive to somebody the more positive
[32:33] they
[32:34] become but you start speaking negative
[32:37] that atmosphere comes because you're
[32:39] creators amen that's right yes sir amen
[32:42] and you create your own atmosphere oh
[32:45] Lord why is it like this cuz you create
[32:47] it you you bringing the storm clouds
[32:50] amen I I've been I'm a witness of that
[32:53] the more I say I'm tired the more tired
[32:56] I become that's right good
[32:59] word and we must learn how to speak
[33:02] against those things even though it's
[33:04] real don't get me wrong it's real being
[33:06] tired but you got to speak against it
[33:09] amen because when you don't you become
[33:12] more tired
[33:15] am oh I'm so confused
[33:20] don't you got to speak positive what I'm
[33:23] trying I'm trying to learn I'm trying to
[33:24] tell you
[33:25] something it can you find in the
[33:27] scripture anywhere any place where Jesus
[33:31] spoke
[33:32] negative about
[33:34] himself or any condition he found
[33:37] himself
[33:39] in not just Jesus I say Paul Paul said
[33:43] I've been in every every kind of
[33:46] situation and I learn how to be obeyed I
[33:50] learned how to be exalted I learn how to
[33:54] give thanks amen so it is a learning
[33:57] process
[33:58] process but we must allow God to teach
[34:01] us cuz we are headed for Perfection amen
[34:05] not of this but the inner man amen and
[34:08] this is what we must concentrate on that
[34:11] inner man becoming Perfection per
[34:13] perfect how you know it's going to
[34:15] happen it's going to happen amen and
[34:18] it's not going to be according to your
[34:19] knowledge that's right cuz what he's
[34:21] working with supersedes anything your
[34:24] mind can comprehend amen because if we
[34:27] pressed on our minds we'll still be woe
[34:29] with me I'm such a
[34:32] sinner right when God has Justified us
[34:35] Sanctified us freed us from all these
[34:38] things and like I said on Wednesday it's
[34:40] not the blood plus it's the blood
[34:44] amen any questions
[34:48] comments for those who were didn't hear
[34:51] Brother Rich say that and I think it was
[34:53] a powerful thing he talks about the
[34:55] power that we all are tied into into the
[34:58] city there's a there's a unit that that
[35:01] really take push the power out and every
[35:04] time there's a break in connection it
[35:06] literally stops the flow of everything
[35:09] and and it's so true I mean it's it's
[35:11] just true it's like okay when your
[35:14] telephone line goes
[35:16] out lightning strikes that what they
[35:18] call it that big thing on the pole
[35:22] anyway Transformer and then everything
[35:25] goes out
[35:27] because that power is transformed it it
[35:30] shift out and when you hit that
[35:32] everything's go out amen and that's how
[35:35] it is in the church when people don't
[35:37] understand onebody weed that's what Paul
[35:39] was trying to tell them that's why Paul
[35:41] said you a little leav leav is the whole
[35:43] lump you can't allow certain things to
[35:45] creep into the church and when people
[35:48] know things are in the church and they
[35:49] don't do nothing about that then that
[35:51] affects the church
[35:53] amen it has Will and always will right
[35:58] now to him that is able to do what
[36:00] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[36:02] ask or think according to the power that
[36:05] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[36:09] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[36:12] ages World Without End amen amen now now
[36:18] here I
[36:19] go what is wrong with our praise I was
[36:22] talking to a young man today I says I've
[36:25] heard people say well everybody can
[36:27] worship Him no that's not true that's
[36:29] not scriptural everybody can't worship
[36:32] God Amen the Bible say let everything
[36:35] that have breath praise the Lord
[36:37] everybody can Praise Him and there's a
[36:40] difference between praise and worship
[36:42] worship is your life amen and if you're
[36:46] not living right you're not worshiping I
[36:49] don't care how much you praise him your
[36:51] worship is not
[36:54] accepted you got to worship Him in
[36:57] spirit and in what truth and that life
[37:01] is what he's trying to tell us and and
[37:03] listen we we we we are
[37:06] tested uh with each other most of the
[37:09] time most of the time this is where your
[37:11] battle is your about the Bible says the
[37:14] enemy is of your own household well you
[37:17] know nothing affects us like
[37:19] church and people in the church amen and
[37:23] we forget that sometime people are Moody
[37:25] sometime people are going through things
[37:26] sometime you know we all go through
[37:28] things but now we must understand your
[37:32] love must cover it amen the Bible said
[37:36] love covers a multitude of sin amen and
[37:40] our love must learn how to overshadow
[37:45] and and brother randam taught us like
[37:46] that oh they didn't mean it that way you
[37:48] know that's the enemy you must always
[37:51] push back the Flesh and see the enemy
[37:54] not the person that's right
[37:58] come on Ephesians
[38:01] 4
[38:14] 1-8 I
[38:16] remember a brother I hadn't spoke with
[38:19] him in a long time brother Shelly but he
[38:22] was uh telling me about things that were
[38:25] going on in his church and this was
[38:26] years and years ago
[38:28] and they would come up to brother shy
[38:30] brother sh is it
[38:32] [Music]
[38:36] true is it
[38:39] true see that ain't the person you go to
[38:42] brother sh ain't the one that did wrong
[38:44] the person who you know but people who
[38:46] hear things instead of going to the
[38:47] source they go all around amen that's
[38:52] confusion that's right and Satan is the
[38:55] author of confusion
[38:57] Ephesians 4 i f if somebody want to know
[38:59] something about me the best best way to
[39:01] do it is just come straight to me I'm
[39:03] going to either tell you the truth or
[39:05] tell you a
[39:09] lie and if I tell you a lie God gonna
[39:12] make me tell you the truth that's just
[39:14] the way it is Ephesians 4
[39:19] 1-8 no I've got it all messed up here
[39:22] I'm sorry the 11th verse
[39:25] please how did I do oh is my eyes my
[39:28] eyes
[39:31] 1-8 I
[39:33] therefore I saw that one and that eye is
[39:36] 11 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[39:41] beseech you that you what walk worthy of
[39:44] the vocation wherewith ye are called now
[39:48] that's a whole mouthful amen your
[39:51] vocation you have been called unto
[39:53] Holiness you have been called unto
[39:55] righteousness you have been called and
[39:57] the sanctification and it says walk
[40:00] worthy of that
[40:02] amen walk worthy right because here Paul
[40:06] says I what the prisoner of the Lord
[40:10] besee You Lord in other words I'm a
[40:13] prison I I want to be a prisoner amen I
[40:16] want to be so tied up and Tangled Up In
[40:18] God Amen to nothing makes me look right
[40:22] or
[40:22] left you understand me I want to be that
[40:26] to say I'm completely there no yet no no
[40:28] no not yet I'm getting there but my
[40:31] point is I'm I know I'm moving forward
[40:33] and not
[40:35] backwards
[40:37] right with all loneliness and meekness
[40:41] with longsuffering for be one another in
[40:46] love right should I repeat that one with
[40:50] all lonliness and meekness not Pride not
[40:53] Pride not Pride arrogance and all that
[40:56] that ain't gonna work with longsuffering
[40:58] and many of us need that for each other
[41:02] I can use a lot more of that myself long
[41:05] suffering forbearing one another in love
[41:10] and you know what that is cuz a lot of
[41:11] time we want people to change when we
[41:13] want them to change no they change when
[41:17] God changes them amen he that begun the
[41:20] good work in you is faithful to complete
[41:23] it endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[41:26] spirit in what the bond of Peace you
[41:29] don't go up into somebody with the wrong
[41:31] protocol with your
[41:33] fingertip I don't hope nobody's in here
[41:35] like that but my point is I mean you go
[41:38] in meekness you go in love you go you
[41:40] know that's that's listen you know and I
[41:45] know when you're talking to somebody and
[41:47] they raise their voice your voice is
[41:50] going to raise
[41:52] too if you're not
[41:54] careful there you're going to elevate
[41:56] your voice
[41:58] like they elevate theirs and sometime
[42:00] people don't even know they elevating
[42:01] their voice that's right and sometime
[42:03] you say why you saying it that way or
[42:05] lowered it look down you know me because
[42:07] sometime people don't I I've know that
[42:10] to be true but there are times when you
[42:12] don't catch it so when they raise their
[42:14] voice you raise their yours and then say
[42:16] why did you say it like they don't even
[42:18] see that they have been but it's a
[42:21] spirit amen that's right it's a spirit
[42:23] people trying to cause confusion between
[42:26] one 2 or three amen y'all know what I'm
[42:29] saying but love would check it bring it
[42:33] back to its right perspective that's
[42:35] right like wait a minute now that's
[42:37] that's not going in the right way and
[42:40] you hear what I'm saying what do you
[42:42] call that fighting for what is
[42:45] truth that's
[42:47] endeavoring that's dying to yourself and
[42:50] putting yourself out in in the Forefront
[42:53] to be trampled upon to make it come back
[42:57] to his proper place that's
[43:00] right endeavoring to keep the unity of
[43:02] the spirit in the bond of peace and once
[43:04] you make a mistake you come back and
[43:05] make it right that's that's where the
[43:08] devil don't like it he don't like it
[43:09] when you come and make it
[43:12] right there's one body one Spirit even
[43:15] as you are called into one hope of your
[43:18] calling what is Paul saying lumping us
[43:20] all
[43:21] together could be a thousand people in
[43:24] here that's born of God and every one of
[43:26] us we are a part of one another we may
[43:28] be separate in our bodies but in our
[43:30] spirit our Holy Ghost we're supposed to
[43:32] be the same am and if you got the Holy
[43:35] Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost and the
[43:37] Holy Ghost is the word what is it going
[43:38] to do bring that Unity cuz God hate
[43:42] division amen that's your word right one
[43:46] Lord One Faith one baptism one God and
[43:49] the father of us all who is above all
[43:52] and through all and in you all right but
[43:56] unto everyone of us is given Grace
[44:01] according to the measure of the gift of
[44:03] Christ what he saying some people
[44:06] receives more grace than others that's
[44:12] right it is a gift of
[44:16] God wherefore he
[44:20] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[44:23] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[44:26] men and we know what that's all about
[44:29] when God gave the fivefold ministry and
[44:31] all of the five-fold ministry is what to
[44:33] perfect the
[44:35] Saints One Pastor can't do it you need
[44:39] other preachers coming in amen giving
[44:42] giving what God has given to them to you
[44:45] right it takes five fingers to hold the
[44:47] thing fivefold Ministry to hold it right
[44:52] wherefore he says when he ascended up on
[44:55] high he led captivity captive and gave
[44:57] gifts unto men amen now Ephesians
[45:01] 41116 Ephesians 4:1
[45:08] 11:16 now his love is past finding out
[45:11] now we we must understand we can never
[45:14] put a cap on love that's right well I'm
[45:17] sorry you done cross that line too many
[45:20] times you better watch that kind of a
[45:22] thing cuz how many lines we done cross

[45:28] guilty sometimes I don't want to go no
[45:30] further with
[45:31] people don't look at me like I'm crazy
[45:34] I'm just being
[45:36] honest I'm talking in my flesh sometime
[45:38] you don't feel like it and the Holy
[45:40] Ghost says uh-uh you got to keep going
[45:44] that's right if you want to be perfected
[45:46] you got to go you can't run from this I
[45:48] didn't run from Calvary and you can't
[45:51] run from your cross amen amen amen can't
[45:55] do it you got to face it
[45:58] right and he gave some Apostles some
[46:01] prophets some evangelists some some
[46:05] pastors and teachers for what the
[46:07] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[46:09] the ministry for the edifying of the
[46:12] body of Christ till we come all come
[46:15] into the unity of the faith and of the
[46:17] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[46:20] perfect man now y'all understand we said
[46:23] the unity of faith it doesn't mean
[46:24] Baptist message Presbyterian all that no

[46:28] the word the revelation of this day the
[46:31] Holy Ghost is the unity of the faith

[46:36] is until we all get the Holy Ghost when
[46:40] we come into the unity of the
[46:44] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[46:46] God Amen because one thing about the
[46:49] Holy Ghost when you got the holy ghost

[46:56] perf man unto the measures of the
[46:59] stature of the fullness of Christ and we

[47:08] into these places and you know what you
[47:10] can't do it without the storm and the
[47:13] rain amen all of us got to go through it

[47:19] honest with you I don't want to skip
[47:22] grades I want to go through every grade
[47:24] every test every trial I must through I

[48:03] to finish it but we're going to keep on
[48:05] until we finish it that we henceforth be
[48:07] no more children 14th verse tossed to
[48:10] and fro carried about with every wind of
[48:13] Doctrine by the Slate of men and the
[48:15] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[48:18] wait deceive to deceive but speaking the
[48:21] truth in love may grow up into him in
[48:25] All Things speaking the truth in love
[48:28] may grow up into all things which is the
[48:30] head even Christ amen so we see that
[48:34] growing up in him is a
[48:36] process it's what we must do and we must
[48:40] contend we must fight right there's no
[48:43] way you're going to just sweep through
[48:45] this it's no way it ain't you know and I
[48:47] think about it sometimes and and I'm
[48:50] trying to finish uh because of the time
[48:54] and I try I try I think about this time
[48:57] things like that and I'm I'm just in my
[48:59] mind I'm thinking I'm sitting in the
[49:01] house the storm is Raging lightning is
[49:05] flashy and those trees can't even
[49:11] move they can't run for shelter amen
[49:15] they're planted
[49:17] there and if the lightning decide to
[49:19] strike in that area that tree can't even
[49:22] Dodge the lightning
[49:24] amen you understand me God has planted
[49:27] it there and and that's the way I want
[49:29] to be so planted in God to whatever
[49:32] storm comes I'm standing amen and if he
[49:36] decide to prune something off let him do
[49:38] it Hallelujah let him do
[49:42] it because I just want God to finish it
[49:46] I want to be able to produce the fruit
[49:48] and the life that he wants me to produce
[49:50] I can't do it on my own neither can you
[49:53] yes sir but when you fight with what you
[49:56] have you said well wait a minute brother
[49:58] listen I'm going to tell you about a old
[49:59] man by the name of Abraham they were
[50:03] farmers they didn't have no no no no no
[50:06] no swords and everything they had H
[50:10] Farmers
[50:12] equipment maybe some hoes and you know
[50:14] rakes and whatever they had they did not
[50:17] have what the Army the other the army
[50:19] they were going to fight had they didn't
[50:21] have no shield and Buckler and all of
[50:23] the uniforms they just had simple
[50:26] instrument
[50:27] amen and they whooped the enemy and
[50:30] recaptured lot amen and God is saying
[50:34] use what you
[50:35] have you may not I don't have it you
[50:38] know there's some people that could Out
[50:39] quote me there's some people can reme
[50:42] memorize this word better than I can but
[50:44] all I can do is use what you know what
[50:47] what God gave me that's what I use I'm
[50:50] not the deepest preacher in the message
[50:51] but that ain't it
[50:53] either you could have all of that and
[50:55] have not charity I'm trying to get the
[50:57] thing the main thing amen is what I'm
[50:59] after and that's what you need to focus
[51:01] on the main
[51:04] thing you don't have to be educated to
[51:06] get it cuz Peter and them got it amen
[51:11] you know so all I'm trying to tell you
[51:12] is Ephesians is a powerful book there's
[51:15] so many things and I'm just jumping
[51:16] something from one place to another but
[51:18] I'm trying to give you some of the
[51:20] things that means a lot to me to give to
[51:22] you because you are fighting right now
[51:25] there ain't no way you can be in this
[51:26] message and not fight amen you in a
[51:29] Warfare don't you forget that every day
[51:33] but you got to come out of this thing
[51:35] every day feeling like you're a
[51:37] conqueror you don't go to bed feeling
[51:39] like you're a failure and you've lost it
[51:41] all you go to bed feeling like you're a
[51:43] conqueror and my point is if you feel
[51:45] like you're not a conqueror you get on
[51:47] your knees until you feel like the
[51:49] Conqueror amen cuz Christ going to wash
[51:51] you away wash wash wash you and cleanse
[51:54] you of everything you've ever done
[51:55] during the day time Satan can put it on
[51:58] you but God can take it off amen so you
[52:01] got to remember that go to bed as a
[52:04] conqueror as a
[52:06] Victor so that you can rise up as a
[52:09] Victor any
[52:16] questions thank you sister let's stand
[52:19] let's
[52:24] stand so we'll start with Ephesians 4
