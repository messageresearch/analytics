[4:32] the flesh for the flesh lusteth against
[4:35] the spirit and the spirit against the
[4:37] Flesh and these are contrary the one to
[4:40] the other so that you cannot do the
[4:42] things that you would but if you be led
[4:45] of the spirit you are not under the law
[4:49] and Romans
[4:52] 8:14 for as many as are led by the

[5:00] bondage again to fear oh I love that
[5:04] scripture amen so many uh preachers and
[5:08] and and denominations even in the

[5:25] we came out of a state of fear and and
[5:28] doubt amen and and worry but now we've
[5:31] been free amen you have received the

[7:14] be seated
[7:16] tonight
[7:19] amen thank you
[7:23] amen I want to read to you a
[7:25] quote this is from Satan's Eden
[7:30] tonight we're speaking about we want to
[7:32] we want to kind of build on where we
[7:34] went this morning and and and and the
[7:37] things that we were uh seeing in the
[7:39] word of God and we we want to want to
[7:41] kind of expand on that a little bit if
[7:44] the Lord Wills but my subject tonight
[7:46] would be the headship of the
[7:49] word and um let me read this quote here
[7:52] in Satan's Eden brother Bram says now
[7:54] notice the Holy Spirit God's holy word
[7:57] had a man and a woman naked and didn't
[8:00] know it that was in Eden right how
[8:03] beautiful life of the word the seed the
[8:07] word God said there is a tree in the
[8:09] midst of the garden the woman and in the
[8:11] midst of the garden is this tree don't
[8:12] even touch it for the day you eat
[8:14] thereof that day you die they were
[8:16] wholly veiled from it they didn't know
[8:18] nothing about it darent to touch it they
[8:21] were wholly veiled they were safe in
[8:25] God's Pavilion they were alive they had
[8:28] no death around them Hallelujah they had
[8:32] perfect love for the other perfect life
[8:40] together they had perfect love perfect
[8:44] understanding of the love of God they
[8:47] had God's word and kept it and they were
[8:51] alive and safe in God's Eden with no
[8:54] death at all around them then Satan got
[8:57] Eve to listen to his Gospel of theology
[8:59] the gospel of knowledge higher schooling
[9:02] higher ethics better civilization higher
[9:04] education and so forth and he got her to
[9:08] stop and listen to him a minute to his
[9:12] reasonings which we are commanded to
[9:14] cast down amen and when he got her to
[9:17] listen to it now look he here the church
[9:20] is so and so it's been established for
[9:21] so long we one of the oldest churches in
[9:24] the country the mayor of the city goes I
[9:26] don't care what it is see if it's
[9:28] against God's word be against it that's
[9:30] your enemy amen anything that's against
[9:34] the word is your enemy amen
[9:38] amen anything that's for the word is
[9:41] your brother he's part of you amen
[9:43] notice she pulled off the holy Veil to
[9:47] see what the sex really was compare that
[9:50] what lust would really do she pulled the
[9:52] veil from off her eyes and the holy
[9:54] thing that God had put over her eyes she
[9:57] wanted knowledge to know what it was all
[9:59] about so she pulled the veil off to see
[10:02] what it was all about she listened to
[10:04] the devil and noticed what a place it
[10:06] put her in and they have done the same
[10:08] thing in each age thereafter always
[10:11] taking the intellectual side and has now
[10:14] built a kingdom of Satan knowledge his
[10:17] seed that he SED has took the world to
[10:20] be an Eden of
[10:22] death
[10:24] amen so tonight we want to speak to you
[10:27] about the headship of the word amen and
[10:30] you know this morning uh as as we were
[10:34] uh speaking about the children of the
[10:36] kingdom and how we enter into that
[10:38] Kingdom and the blessings of the Kingdom
[10:41] those those uh those benefits and the
[10:45] the blessings that we obtain as children
[10:48] of God only come as we put ourselves
[10:52] under the headship of the word of God
[10:55] Amen and that's what we want to speak
[10:57] about uh just for a few minutes here
[10:59] tonight the scripture tells us in Romans
[11:02] here that we read in Romans chapter 8
[11:04] that as many as are led by the spirit of
[11:06] God they are the sons or The Offspring
[11:09] amen of God Amen they are the ones that
[11:12] is proof that they came from God Amen
[11:15] the leadership of the holy spirit in
[11:17] their life is the Hallmark of a true Son
[11:21] of God amen amen and we know that the
[11:24] spirit will never lead outside of the
[11:26] true word amen amen
[11:30] now one who claims to be a child and
[11:33] refuses the leadership of the Holy
[11:36] Spirit which came to remind us of the
[11:39] word to teach us the word amen they
[11:42] don't they can quickly be identified
[11:44] that they aren't what they claim to be
[11:46] amen amen is that right amen and so we
[11:49] recognize that this is the mark the
[11:53] leadership of the Holy Spirit under the
[11:55] headship of the word amen now we know
[12:00] that we all make mistakes from time to
[12:03] time amen and we're in a learning
[12:05] process and you know sometimes we fall
[12:07] and you know the little babies when
[12:08] they're learning to walk you don't you
[12:10] know when they they run and fall you
[12:12] don't tell them now don't you ever try
[12:14] and walk again right we just get them up
[12:16] and keep moving and they grow out of
[12:18] that and pretty soon they're on to
[12:20] something else amen and they fall
[12:22] figuratively and that and we encourage
[12:25] him amen God does the same thing with us
[12:27] Lord we're in a learning process
[12:30] but we're giving the holy ghost first
[12:32] place amen we're under the preeminence
[12:36] of the word of
[12:38] God so Jesus spoke of the promised
[12:42] coming of the holy spirit amen and he
[12:45] spoke of it in terms of the comforter
[12:48] and one that would teach you and lead
[12:50] you into all truth amen and since this
[12:54] is the very life spirit of God that we
[12:56] are talking about he is the Spirit of
[12:59] Truth and he cannot lead you into
[13:02] anything but the
[13:04] truth now many claim to be led of the
[13:07] spirit when really all they're doing is
[13:09] enjoying the anointing yes amen they're
[13:13] enjoying the rain but the Bible teaches
[13:16] us about that yeah even the tears enjoy
[13:19] the rain amen amen so the seed doesn't
[13:23] it doesn't matter what kind of seed you
[13:25] are any kind of seed can enjoy the
[13:27] blessings and the anointing of
[13:30] but what we're talking about is being
[13:31] led by the spirit to do the word and to
[13:35] submit to the headship of the word amen
[13:38] now this is not an easy thing for for
[13:41] the flesh amen and this is something
[13:44] that uh you know if people didn't
[13:47] struggle with it we wouldn't have so
[13:49] many problems that we have in the church
[13:51] amen uh people being able to submit
[13:54] themselves to the word amen the problem
[13:56] is they say you know the pastor brings
[13:59] the word of God it brings correction and
[14:01] it's the word amen and they say well
[14:03] it's the pastor he just doesn't like me
[14:05] or he's got it in for me or you know
[14:07] it's this they they point to the vessel
[14:09] instead of recognizing that it's the
[14:12] word they need to submit to amen
[14:15] amen amen
[14:18] am so this is a great source of rest
[14:22] however for those haveed the Holy Ghost
[14:25] amen because you know amen that the
[14:29] spirit of truth will lead you into all
[14:32] truth and you know that as long as you
[14:35] stay under the headship of the word
[14:37] you're protected amen amen you stay
[14:40] under the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[14:42] he will lead you exactly where you need
[14:45] to be amen amen so you know people that
[14:49] get pulled by every wind of Doctrine
[14:51] it's because they're afraid and they
[14:53] don't have that tie yeah if you know God
[14:57] like we spoke of this morning morning if
[14:59] you've met him in that personal
[15:02] revelation it it's the enemy can't come
[15:05] and pull you this way or that wayen amen
[15:07] because you've got a personal anchor you
[15:11] know him amen amen hallelujah amen you
[15:15] know we see it you know I live in Tucson
[15:18] Arizona and Tucson is one of the one of
[15:21] the most religious places you'll find
[15:23] you'll find every kind of thing out
[15:25] there you know I don't know how many
[15:27] message churches we have out there you
[15:30] know some of them are churches and some
[15:31] of them aren't churches some of them are
[15:33] lodges some of them are tape churches
[15:36] and you just find all kinds of things
[15:38] out there and you know many times we we
[15:41] see that someone who gets pulled off or
[15:45] or a a particular doctr Doctrine will
[15:48] arise up something that's not of the
[15:50] word of God and it will pull people
[15:52] because they don't have that Foundation
[15:55] because they don't know Christ
[15:57] personally amen they in the
[16:00] messag amen well my qu you know we
[16:03] shouldn't ask people how long have you
[16:04] been in the
[16:06] message we should ask them how long has
[16:08] the message been in you right and you
[16:12] know uh like you know brother Danny you
[16:14] asked me the other night how long have
[16:16] you been in this way you know and I
[16:17] should have just answered you well you
[16:19] know I've been in the message since I
[16:21] was 6 years old but the message has been
[16:24] in me since I was 20 when I received the
[16:27] Holy Ghost amen amen that that's when
[16:29] the life that was in the message came in
[16:32] me amen the problem is we've got too
[16:34] many message Baptists yeah amen that say
[16:38] oh you you you believe God sent a
[16:40] prophet that's the evidence of the Holy
[16:42] Ghost wrong answer am amen that's
[16:45] Baptist theology brought over to the
[16:47] message that's right there's got to be a
[16:49] birth amen amen amen
[16:54] amen so that having that
[16:59] Spirit of
[17:01] Truth it he leads us and he guides us
[17:04] amen and it's a great source of rest for
[17:07] us but the the the key is that we must
[17:09] allow him or give him permission to have
[17:12] the preeminence amen amen and and I
[17:14] don't care how long you've been in this
[17:17] or it's been in you amen how long you've
[17:20] uh been on this Christian walk there's
[17:23] going to be challenges and things that
[17:24] come up where you have to it's a
[17:26] challenge for you to surrender to God's
[17:28] will amen amen I know that I still I go
[17:32] through those amen and brother Brooks I
[17:34] know you do too amen God uh allows test
[17:37] to come our way and we must give the
[17:40] Holy Spirit the preeminence and allow
[17:43] him to have that leadership so this this
[17:46] doesn't happen all at once it doesn't
[17:48] happen automatically it's something that
[17:51] we grow into amen it's part of our walk
[17:56] a surrender a daily surrender because
[17:58] the trials you're going through now are
[18:00] not the trials you went through last
[18:01] year or the year before that you've
[18:04] grown amen you've come up you've you've
[18:07] the the trials that you went through 10
[18:09] years ago are now Child's Play for you
[18:12] you look back well i' take some of those
[18:13] trials now you know but now look at what
[18:16] I've got to deal with here amen but God
[18:18] allows those things because you're in a
[18:21] walk of
[18:22] perfection
[18:23] amen so every hour we have to hand over
[18:27] control the Keys amen and we have to
[18:31] fight the flesh from taking control and
[18:34] allow the word to have headship in our
[18:38] lives
[18:40] amen
[18:42] now just for a few minutes here I want
[18:45] to kind of background this uh about the
[18:49] the Holy Spirit uh because every age has
[18:53] had access to this leadership of the Son
[18:57] of God right the son of God is the
[18:59] pillar of fire in the midst of the
[19:00] churches amen and in in Revelation
[19:04] chapter 1 you can see the the the the
[19:06] Son of God in the midst of all the
[19:09] churches so he was in the midst of the
[19:11] churches throughout all the ages even in
[19:13] the darkest of Ages God has always had a
[19:16] witness amen he's always had a witness
[19:19] of his power and
[19:21] Grace but uh at the beginning of this
[19:25] leodan age there was a great move of God
[19:28] known as the uh the Pentecostal Revival
[19:32] zusa Street you know there was uh there
[19:34] was the Welsh Revival and other revivals
[19:36] that have that came along as God ushered
[19:40] in uh the the this last Church age that
[19:44] we are a part of amen and God uh during
[19:48] this revival uh He restored the gifts of
[19:52] the Holy Spirit and the baptism by fire
[19:55] is that right amazing Miracles
[19:57] testimonies Sovereign move of God uh and
[20:01] then this would spark great healing
[20:03] campaigns right uh it you know amazing
[20:07] uh things where God you know uh i' I've
[20:11] read most of the books on the isua
[20:13] street revivals and the different
[20:15] revivals and it it was just a sovereign
[20:17] move of God God was burning Revival
[20:20] fires all across the nation amen and
[20:24] great outpourings and great moves of the
[20:27] holy spirit that that that flowed into
[20:30] great healing campaigns in the 40s and
[20:32] the 50s you know uh all all the the the
[20:35] men that came before and after brother
[20:37] bram's own Ministry his own Ministry
[20:39] sparking those healing campaigns and all
[20:42] the things that God was doing uh in in
[20:45] in worldwide and Nationwide uh revivals
[20:49] and and healing campaigns and eventually
[20:53] it spread all over the world and brother
[20:56] sister that was a mighty move of God
[20:58] yeah there's no there's no denying it
[21:01] mean it it was a mighty move of God Amen
[21:04] but even in all that Display of Power
[21:09] and the signs that God was
[21:11] doing uh there was a greater work that
[21:14] he was interested in a greater work
[21:20] amen remember when he came on Earth in
[21:25] humility it was small numbers and he
[21:28] came to do a mighty work amen amen he he
[21:32] came in a humble way but it was a small
[21:36] it you know brother Bram talks about he
[21:37] says I don't know if there was a hundred
[21:39] people that knew he was on the earth at
[21:40] the time right it was a humble work
[21:43] humility not known by
[21:45] many and so we see even all in this
[21:49] great work that God was doing there was
[21:51] something that he really wanted there
[21:54] was a greater work for him to perform
[21:57] amen because there was a church a bride
[22:00] that he wanted to come out of that amen
[22:04] that he wanted to manifest fully through
[22:07] amen amen so you see because what he's
[22:12] doing is he's restoring that communion
[22:15] back with man again amen he's restoring
[22:18] us back to where Adam fell from and even
[22:22] with all the Miracles and all the things
[22:25] that happened in the Pentecostal Revival
[22:28] we see where it ended up it ended up in
[22:31] organization organization organization
[22:33] organization
[22:35] amen and so what God was really
[22:39] interested in was restoring the word so
[22:42] that he could call a people out of that
[22:45] amen he could bring up people to know
[22:49] him as he really is amen now this is
[22:54] this is important because this fits into
[22:56] our subject of the headship of the word
[22:59] because it's only in this age that we
[23:01] have actually had the full restored word
[23:04] amen amen you see those is part of the
[23:08] Pentecostal Revival and I believe that
[23:10] they were they were God's people no
[23:12] doubt sealed in I mean that was where
[23:15] that was where God was moving during
[23:17] that time amen but then as part of that
[23:22] as an outflow of that God then began to
[23:26] restore the word yes amen amen and he is
[23:30] his word so his word describes who he is
[23:35] his word is his character yeah amen it's
[23:40] him and I'll just use an example you
[23:42] know of something simple like uh uh uh
[23:46] cutting hair you know so so that's part
[23:49] of God's word that that that the the
[23:51] women are supposed are not supposed to
[23:53] cut their hair right that's that's
[23:54] simple we all know that but you see
[23:58] those those that had were many that were
[24:00] part of that Pentecostal movement not
[24:03] all but many that were part of that they
[24:06] couldn't abide that word amen they
[24:09] couldn't take that word amen right so
[24:12] what were they in love
[24:14] with what was their focus on they they
[24:17] wanted the anointing they wanted the
[24:20] power but they weren't interested in the
[24:23] word amen amen now we're we want the
[24:27] word be because we realize that's him
[24:30] amen so in that in that simple example
[24:33] God is expressing his heart he's saying
[24:36] what he
[24:38] likes amen he's saying that he likes the
[24:42] sisters to not cut their hair he likes
[24:45] for them to act and be a certain way
[24:48] right that's his preference amen that's
[24:51] what he likes and and so he brings that
[24:55] precious word brother Isaiah Amen to
[24:57] those that are around the movement yes
[25:01] and they trample it yes they say no we
[25:04] don't want that they call it an unclean
[25:07] thing amen they say oh that's law that's
[25:09] bondage we don't want that and what are
[25:12] they doing they're rejecting
[25:15] him amen amen this is why this is why
[25:20] the restored word is so important yes
[25:24] and you know you can go down item by
[25:26] item things that were rece restored yes
[25:29] amen amen and you can see no we don't
[25:33] want
[25:34] that they'll call it legalism they'll
[25:36] call it whatever amen but what it comes
[25:40] down to is they're rejecting the
[25:42] headship yes amen that's why that's why
[25:45] the hair cutting one is such a great
[25:47] example amen because because a woman uh
[25:51] her hair is her glory amen and and and
[25:54] her glory is her headship amen amen
[25:57] that's right and now you've got a false
[26:00] Church enjoying the anointing of the
[26:03] Holy Spirit enjoying the anointing the
[26:05] outflowing the blessings but they don't
[26:08] want the headship that's right they
[26:10] don't want to submit to the leadership
[26:12] of the word amen amen amen yes
[26:16] Lord but you see his
[26:19] children they act very differently Hall
[26:22] they say oh I didn't know that right I'm
[26:26] sorry Lord amen
[26:28] they they are like those in uh in
[26:31] Revelation 3 where in leoda he says be
[26:35] zealous and
[26:36] repent amen when the word of Correction
[26:39] comes they say I'm sorry Lord amen I
[26:42] didn't know amen but but now Lord oh oh
[26:46] God I'm sorry and I I want to be right
[26:48] and I want to
[26:50] repent the truth is I I really you know
[26:53] uh my pastor says this all the time and
[26:56] I like this he says I don't care what I
[26:58] have to
[26:59] believe amen I just want to be I want to
[27:03] believe the truth amen I don't care what
[27:06] in other words I don't care what I have
[27:08] to do or give up yeah right I I don't
[27:11] care what I how I have to mold myself
[27:14] yeah but I want to be lined up to him
[27:18] amen I want what he
[27:21] wants amen and that's what his children
[27:23] want amen his children want to truly
[27:26] know him yes amen amen you see it's the
[27:31] Mighty God beginning to unveil himself
[27:35] amen that's what he is doing through his
[27:37] word restoring the word he's unveiling
[27:42] himself amen he's saying you know I've
[27:46] never I I I haven't expressed this in
[27:49] past ages this has been lost but I
[27:51] really like the sisters to wear not cut
[27:54] their hair amen he's unveiling himself
[27:57] he's making himself vulnerable amen he's
[28:00] actually giving us his thoughts his word
[28:05] amen amen he wants us brother sister to
[28:08] fully experience his
[28:11] character to use us his body on Earth to
[28:14] manifest that character in Satan's Eden
[28:17] amen amen and the beautiful thing is
[28:20] he's given us an eagle anointing amen
[28:23] amen amen an eagle of prophetic
[28:26] anointing to receive that that restored
[28:28] word amen 1 John
[28:30] 2:27 tells us the anointing which you
[28:33] have received of him abideth in you amen
[28:37] and you need not that any man teach you
[28:39] but as the same anointing teaches you of
[28:42] all things and is truth and is no lie
[28:46] and even as it hath taught you you shall
[28:49] abide in him amen amen so this anointing
[28:54] that we're under the eagle anointing
[28:56] teaches us amen amen it teaches us and
[29:00] it lines up perfectly it has to with the
[29:03] word amen now that's not to say that we
[29:06] don't need teachers we don't that's not
[29:08] to say we don't need the five-fold
[29:10] ministry amen but God uses those vessels
[29:13] and he uses those offices and he uses
[29:16] other ways to teach us by his anointing
[29:19] amen but our teaching is not of man amen
[29:23] when your teach when your pastor stands
[29:25] up and teaches you out of the word of
[29:27] God you can receive it as information
[29:30] but you're truly not taught until the
[29:32] Holy Ghost comes down and you receive it
[29:36] through the anointing amen and then he
[29:38] teaches it to you
[29:41] amen amen you see that's the problem
[29:44] with Baptist me uh message
[29:47] believers they take it in the intellect
[29:50] yeah amen
[29:52] amen amen but this fully restored word
[29:56] is not a dead letter it's a living word
[30:00] amen it's a living God Amen with an
[30:03] anointing on it amen hallelujah the
[30:06] living person of Jesus Christ
[30:10] Amen brother sister if we don't have the
[30:13] shout of the king in the camp what have
[30:15] we got amen we've got a dead Moab
[30:18] religion am amen amen he said that Moab
[30:22] was so close they had all the same
[30:26] rituals and and and worship ship they
[30:28] had everything that Israel had they even
[30:31] look better amen you know they didn't
[30:35] have some of the rof raff that was
[30:37] hanging around
[30:38] Israel amen they were a better class a
[30:42] Believer amen but they were lacking
[30:45] something amen they were lacking the
[30:47] shout of the king in the camp amen
[30:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[30:53] amen we got to have the the life evident
[30:58] in our lives
[30:59] amen so this person of the word is who
[31:04] we're submitting to you're not
[31:06] submitting to your pastor amen you're
[31:09] submitting to the word amen amen yes so
[31:13] many people have trouble with headship
[31:15] in this hour they they have trouble
[31:17] submitting themselves they have trouble
[31:19] coming under the headship of the word
[31:21] they don't want to be subject to a a
[31:23] pastor or anybody they don't want to be
[31:25] subject to a body they don't want to be
[31:27] uh you know they don't want to have to
[31:29] give an account or an answer amen amen
[31:32] but they don't realize that they're what
[31:35] they're actually rejecting is the
[31:37] headship of the word amen not a brother
[31:40] or a sister amen amen they're not
[31:42] rejecting the if I in other words if I
[31:46] uh if I was am a child and I'm
[31:50] disrespecting my parents right I'm not
[31:53] just disrespecting them I'm
[31:57] disrespecting God's word amen because
[31:59] God's word tells me as a child respect
[32:03] your parents obey your parents am right
[32:07] that's God's word so if I'm going to be
[32:09] under the headship of the word I'm going
[32:11] to be subject to my parents amen amen
[32:15] same thing amen for a Believer we've got
[32:18] to be subject to the word amen amen
[32:23] amen so the mark of the holy spirit is
[32:27] is the token given to us amen God has
[32:32] come down accepted the sacrifice of
[32:35] Christ that we laid on the altar of our
[32:37] heart amen filled our temple with his
[32:41] presence amen this is why we can lay a
[32:44] hold of any Scripture and possess it
[32:47] amen because we're under the headship
[32:51] amen so so now when we have the two
[32:55] necessary pieces in place
[32:58] in in our life now we're and we're in a
[33:02] time where the seals on the book of
[33:05] redemption have been opened
[33:08] amen amen and and the book has been
[33:12] placed back in man's hands again amen so
[33:15] all those loose ends that were lost
[33:18] through the
[33:19] ages of of doctrines and things that
[33:23] were in the word all those loose ends
[33:25] have been tied up amen and now the full
[33:29] word is restored back to us again but
[33:32] brother and sister if you remember in
[33:33] the Old Testament this morning we were
[33:35] using the example of Joshua and there
[33:37] was a generation that rejected the word
[33:41] amen they wouldn't come under the
[33:43] subjection of the word or the headship
[33:46] of the word instead they said no they
[33:49] came up to the land and they said no we
[33:51] can't do
[33:52] it we can't do it and they God cut them
[33:56] off yes they said wow you know man when
[34:00] I I remember I used to look at that and
[34:01] think wow that was that was awful harsh
[34:03] I mean they were just afraid right I
[34:06] would be afraid too I don't know that I
[34:08] would want to go fight a bunch of Giants
[34:10] and you know go into a land like that
[34:12] and it's kind of kind of scary I I get
[34:14] you know they were afraid but brother
[34:15] sister they're Are Spiritual type yes
[34:18] the word
[34:20] said the word said that the land was
[34:24] there amen amen I love that amen yeah
[34:27] the word said they could
[34:31] overcome and take the
[34:33] land and they refused the headship of
[34:37] that word amen amen instead they looked
[34:42] so you see it doesn't matter what the
[34:44] reason is it doesn't matter if you're
[34:46] trying to be rebellious or not but when
[34:48] you come out under from under the
[34:49] headship of the word even if it's
[34:51] because you're afraid even you know
[34:53] whatever the reason is even if you think
[34:55] you're trying to do God a service by
[34:57] doing it yeah whatever the reason you
[35:01] don't come out from under the headship
[35:03] of the word you got to stay right with
[35:05] it amen so they they didn't stay with it
[35:09] and so God brought them and said well
[35:11] you know that's it I'll raise up a new
[35:13] generation now when that new generation
[35:16] came up they weren't
[35:18] circumcised amen amen remember Joshua
[35:21] had to go back and circumcised that
[35:23] second generation to roll away the
[35:26] reproach of Egypt amen and so all the
[35:30] unbelief brother sister the same thing
[35:32] is happening in our day yeah or has
[35:35] happened amen right because all the all
[35:38] these sins throughout the church ages
[35:41] where they slowly but surely got from
[35:44] out from under the headship of the word
[35:46] amen amen they were started out real
[35:48] good under Paul amen the the church age
[35:50] start the first church age they started
[35:52] out strong but they slowly organized and
[35:56] you can read about it in the church
[35:57] Church age book right all the things
[35:59] that slowly crept in and you know the
[36:01] doctrine of the nicians became the Deeds
[36:03] of the nicians and what happened sin was
[36:06] heaped up against the church leans
[36:10] against the title as it were right
[36:12] things that that were held against the
[36:14] body things that were held against the
[36:16] church and So what had to happen is God
[36:19] had to come we had to have a Joshua come
[36:21] amen amen and and cut away circumcise
[36:25] and remove those leans
[36:28] that were against the book amen he had
[36:30] to cut away the unbelief roll away the
[36:34] reproach of the previous ages amen he
[36:38] had to go back age by age and correct
[36:41] the error and show exactly where they
[36:43] got off amen amen so the Holy Spirit has
[36:49] roiled away the unbelief of seven anges
[36:52] that have been heaped up thank you Lord
[36:54] what an age we live in amen what an
[36:58] age my
[37:00] goodness you see that title deed was
[37:02] purchased by Calvary but now there have
[37:05] been 2,000 years of leans against it of
[37:09] unbelief amen that title had to be
[37:12] cleared before we could receive it
[37:15] before it could rightfully belong to us
[37:18] again
[37:20] amen so what that means though is that
[37:24] brother sister we have the full word
[37:27] back again you know I was reading the
[37:29] other day in in the I believe it was in
[37:32] the church age book brother brandham was
[37:33] saying he said you know I don't think uh
[37:36] and I'm going to paraphrase it because I
[37:38] don't have the quote with me but he says
[37:39] you know I I I think that we we don't
[37:43] respect or realize what we have with the
[37:46] full word in our midst again is the way
[37:49] he said it the word in our midst you see
[37:52] the full word we haven't had the full
[37:55] word since the very beginning amen amen
[37:59] we've got the full word because he said
[38:01] this he said you can't pray and receive
[38:07] uh of God without knowing the will of
[38:09] God is that right you pray for your
[38:11] healing because and you have faith for
[38:14] it because you know it's God's will to
[38:15] heal right you can pray for someone to
[38:18] be saved because you know it's God's
[38:20] will to save the lost right but brother
[38:23] sister you can't pray for something you
[38:25] know when he said uh uh say this
[38:27] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[38:29] into the sea and if you don't doubt in
[38:30] your heart it shall be done but you
[38:32] can't pray that prayer of faith unless
[38:35] you know it's God's will to move the
[38:37] mountain amen right well how do you know
[38:40] what God's will is by his word amen so
[38:44] now only now in this last age do we have
[38:49] the full counsel of God Amen think about
[38:54] it no other age even though Paul was
[38:57] saying we which are alive and remain
[38:59] shall not hinder those he was thinking
[39:02] that the Rapture was going to be in his
[39:03] age right but now through throughout
[39:06] every age you look back through every
[39:08] age only in this age is it is it
[39:10] unveiling and revealing to the church
[39:13] that they won't taste death why because
[39:15] the full word has been restored and they
[39:18] realize what they have they realize what
[39:21] has been purchased at Calvary amen
[39:25] amen so
[39:27] uh so but we're we're yielding to the
[39:30] leadership of this alive revealed open
[39:35] word amen you know I feel sorry for
[39:37] people that still got a closed book amen
[39:39] but God has opened the book he is amen
[39:42] he's opened it in this hour
[39:44] amen and we're receiving correction
[39:47] because none of us line up to it that's
[39:50] right amen none of us is is all right
[39:53] amen amen that's why we're in this walk
[39:56] so that we can line up with the word of
[39:59] God Amen and he's revealing his
[40:01] character to us in ways not previously
[40:04] seen by other
[40:06] ages my you see we didn't know all his
[40:10] preferences amen like we were talking
[40:12] the other night Esther Esther doesn't
[40:14] know what the king likes until the
[40:16] Chamberlain tells her amen we we know
[40:20] what God likes because it's been
[40:22] revealed to us amen through his word
[40:25] amen this is out of of the message
[40:27] Christ is the mystery of God
[40:31] revealed as the head was took from the
[40:33] grave so must the body follow him back
[40:37] to Eden did you catch that now he was
[40:40] the head as the head Christ was taken
[40:44] from the grave so must the body that's
[40:47] us amen amen we're his body the fullness
[40:50] of him that filth all and all amen so
[40:53] must the body follow him back to Eden
[40:56] yes amen
[40:57] where where the head of the family the
[41:00] man the bridegroom the bride being the
[41:03] body of the bridegroom must follow the
[41:06] bride because that's the
[41:09] head and the head is
[41:11] revealed amen the head's been revealed
[41:14] amen and come back with eternal life and
[41:17] the body must follow
[41:20] that because it's husband and wife again
[41:24] amen as long as you're pregnated with
[41:26] the same word which is his body you've
[41:29] took his body become in him when you
[41:32] took the word not the Creed the
[41:35] word oh my wouldn't that make for a text
[41:38] this
[41:39] afternoon wouldn't that be wonderful see
[41:42] just think of it therefore the body he
[41:45] says don't fail this the body therefore
[41:48] cannot recognize any other headship but
[41:51] the word amen amen amen she can't
[41:56] recognize has any other headship but the
[41:58] word the body is subject to the Head
[42:02] amen the problem is is that people uh
[42:05] have this idea of a a a multi-headed
[42:10] body right or or their the head right or
[42:14] they've got they've got they've got it
[42:16] all mixed up but the body everything is
[42:19] fitly joined together in this body
[42:22] Christ's body is perfect amen and his
[42:25] head he is the head he's going to lead
[42:27] the body amen you know today uh people
[42:30] have a misunderstood understanding of
[42:33] the the family unit amen Satan has come
[42:36] in and and totally Twisted things around
[42:38] and and he's made men the uh the the the
[42:42] the door M and he's lifted up women to
[42:44] be the head of the family and they're
[42:47] the ones that wear the pants so to speak
[42:49] right figuratively and literally right
[42:52] and and Satan has done that for a
[42:55] reason because it tears down and it
[42:58] tears apart the the picture that God has
[43:02] placed before us of the head and the
[43:05] body Christ as the head amen head of the
[43:09] church
[43:11] amen the woman is not in charge the
[43:14] man's in charge that's the Covenant amen
[43:17] that God set
[43:18] up he says don't fail this the body
[43:22] therefore cannot recognize any other
[43:24] headship but the word amen the head is
[43:27] connected with the body the head is the
[43:29] word and it's the same word one headship
[43:33] therefore denominations holy fathers
[43:36] everything else is dead D there's one
[43:39] headship that's Christ the body only
[43:43] recognizes one thing and that's the word
[43:46] now a moment ago I was talking about how
[43:49] you know we submit ourselves uh you know
[43:53] we we respect the headship that God has
[43:55] placed when you you know when our pastor
[43:58] brings something he brings correction we
[44:01] submit ourselves to that headship but
[44:03] notice I didn't say that we're
[44:05] submitting to the
[44:07] man right we're submitting to the word
[44:10] amen we're submitting to the office
[44:13] which is God working through the
[44:15] man amen
[44:17] amen may maybe I'm supposed to be be
[44:20] laboring this I don't know but I feel
[44:22] led to amen because so many people don't
[44:26] understand that yeah they think oh you
[44:29] know and they're looking at the man well
[44:30] the man makes mistakes the man is a man
[44:33] amen but there's an office there yes
[44:36] amen and God Honors that office amen and
[44:39] God will will equip that man to perform
[44:42] that office amen and he will use that
[44:45] office to speak to you amen now just
[44:48] because you know look God speaks to me
[44:52] amen he speaks to you I hope he speaks
[44:54] to you amen God speaks to me
[44:57] but there are times brother sister when
[45:00] God uses the office of the pastor to
[45:03] speak to me amen and it's not that he
[45:06] couldn't speak to me
[45:09] directly right it's not that God
[45:12] couldn't come down and say yep you know
[45:14] do this or whatever but that's the
[45:17] reason he put the office there am is
[45:20] everybody understand that and I have to
[45:23] accept that I have to submit myself and
[45:25] say you know what uh this is not the
[45:28] case but maybe I just don't even like my
[45:31] pastor you know maybe I maybe I I maybe
[45:34] I don't even like to be around him but I
[45:36] have to recognize that God uses that
[45:40] office to speak to me amen I'm glad I
[45:43] like my
[45:44] pastor amen but you understand it's not
[45:48] the man it's God it's the it's the word
[45:51] it's the
[45:52] office amen so many people can't deal
[45:55] with headship in this day amen it's a
[45:58] rebellious age but they're actually
[46:00] rebelling against the word of God all
[46:03] right 1 John
[46:05] 5:9 the Bible says if we receive the
[46:08] witness of men the witness of God is
[46:12] greater for this is the witness of God
[46:15] which he had testified of his son he
[46:17] that believeth on the Son of God hath
[46:19] the witness in
[46:22] himself he that believeth not God hath
[46:26] made him a liar because he believeth not
[46:28] the record that God gave of his son and
[46:30] this is the record that God ha given us
[46:33] to eternal life and his life is in his
[46:35] son he that hath the son hath
[46:38] life and he that hath not the son hath
[46:41] not life and these things have I written
[46:43] unto you that you believe on the name of
[46:45] the son of God that you may know that
[46:47] you have eternal life and excuse me and
[46:50] that you may believe on the name of the
[46:52] son of God you see he says that he that
[46:55] believeth on the son of God he has a
[46:58] witness in
[46:59] himself that this is the truth he says
[47:02] this is the witness of God which he
[47:04] testified of his son Amen in John
[47:07] chapter 146 and
[47:10] 20 John Chapter 14 verse
[47:13] 16 he says I will pray the father and he
[47:17] shall give you another comforter that he
[47:19] may abide with you forever amen even the
[47:22] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[47:24] receive because it seeth him not need
[47:26] neither knoweth him but you know him
[47:29] amen as we said this morning you can't
[47:31] see it amen you can't touch it feel
[47:34] it but you know it by the
[47:38] spirit he says for he dwelleth with you
[47:41] and shall be in you I will not leave you
[47:43] comfortless I come to you yet a little
[47:46] while the world seeth me no more but you
[47:48] shall see me because I live you shall
[47:49] live also amen and at that day shall
[47:54] know that I am in the father you and me
[47:56] and I am you and brother Bram said that
[47:58] day is this day
[48:01] amen this day amen amen so I would say
[48:05] this day you know that I'm in the father
[48:07] you in me and I in you why because the
[48:11] full word has been restored amen we
[48:14] can't know him if we if we had the wrong
[48:17] conception of him amen throughout the
[48:19] ages people thought he was three and
[48:21] they argued whether it was three or one
[48:23] or or or two or or who what he was how
[48:27] do we baptize is it this way or that way
[48:29] right but now we know him amen we know
[48:33] his truth amen I am in the father you in
[48:36] me and I in you and then 1 John Chapter
[48:40] 2 uh verse 4 he that saith I know him
[48:45] and keepeth not his Commandments is a
[48:47] liar you see so you say well I know him
[48:50] he's in me and yet you're not subject to
[48:53] the to the word you're a liar amen
[48:57] you've got to be subject to the word now
[48:59] again that's not to say you won't make
[49:01] mistakes we're not talking about that
[49:04] we're talking about being under headship
[49:08] amen he says he he that saith I know him
[49:11] and keep not his Commandments is a liar
[49:13] and the truth is not in him but who so
[49:17] keepeth his word in him verily is the
[49:20] love of God
[49:23] perfected hereby we know that we are in
[49:26] in him you see that's how you know
[49:30] because through the Holy Spirit you come
[49:31] under subjection to the word amen amen
[49:36] so we uh you know we begin to experience
[49:40] the fruits of this in our own lives and
[49:43] we begin to recognize because we see the
[49:45] fruits in our own lives we begin to
[49:47] recognize other people who don't have it
[49:50] amen they say they've got something but
[49:53] it doesn't line up with what the word is
[49:56] saying yeah amen amen and and the more
[50:00] that we're under that anointing and the
[50:02] more that we're under that word
[50:04] anointing the more the gray areas become
[50:07] black and white that's why brother
[50:10] sister when you're away from church amen
[50:13] things that were once black and white
[50:15] suddenly become gray amen even even
[50:19] tonight you're going to walk out the
[50:20] door yes amen and you're going to go to
[50:23] your homes amen and things are going to
[50:25] be not quite as clear as they are in
[50:27] here tonight is that right you've
[50:30] experienced that right you're under the
[50:32] preaching and the anointing of the word
[50:33] and man everything just seems so Crystal
[50:36] Clear and and it's just oh it's so good
[50:38] and you can see you can see plainly amen
[50:42] amen and then you you know the next day
[50:43] you're at work and that trial comes and
[50:45] man I don't know well I think that's
[50:49] it's great yeah amen amen is that true
[50:53] amen so that's why we need that
[50:57] anointing amen that's why we need that
[50:59] word we need to feed on it amen because
[51:03] it makes the gray black and white
[51:05] again
[51:07] amen and you know as we go on in our
[51:10] walk uh things that were once maybe gray
[51:14] become black and white amen and we we
[51:16] put down tists as we go along and we put
[51:19] down stakes and we come up higher maybe
[51:22] once where we were inclined to be swayed
[51:24] one way or another now we're able to
[51:26] discern the spirit that's behind that
[51:29] amen because you see the fruit of it
[51:31] down the
[51:32] road and our walk becomes more based on
[51:36] faith and less on carnal thinking amen
[51:39] amen this is Brother bram's uh a quote
[51:42] here from a time of decision I hope this
[51:45] is okay tonight
[51:47] amen
[51:49] amen he says I wonder why that Rebecca
[51:52] came before any of the other girls did
[51:54] you know that Rebecca and Isaac were
[51:56] blood relations they were cousins and as
[51:59] the Bride of Jesus Christ is blood
[52:01] relation to him a blood brought bride a
[52:05] blood bought bride say that 10 times
[52:08] fast no wonder she was led by the spirit
[52:12] there was a connection coming together
[52:14] there was a union coming together that's
[52:17] the reason I think that today the born
[52:19] again again the Holy Ghost filled people
[52:22] that's us amen is connected with God and
[52:26] they are led by the spirit of God Amen
[52:29] you see it's a connection amen he says
[52:32] that's why they act so peculiar to the
[52:34] people they've made their decisions
[52:36] they're going on out regardless if the
[52:38] rest of them don't go out they're going
[52:40] anyhow amen that's why you can't be
[52:43] swayed because you got a connection amen
[52:45] amen that's why those old those old
[52:47] friends of yours don't tempt you anymore
[52:49] because you got a connection amen amen
[52:52] that's why those old things that have
[52:54] fallen away they can't pull on you
[52:56] anymore because there's a connection
[52:58] there now there are just new Temptations
[53:01] you have to face amen amen but you will
[53:04] still remain Victorious because you've
[53:06] got a
[53:08] connection
[53:10] amen and that's why we act so peculiar
[53:12] to the world amen amen Christ is a
[53:16] mystery of God revealed brother Brown
[53:18] says he is the principal theme of The
[53:20] Bible he was in the prophets he was in
[53:23] the Psalms he was in the history of the
[53:26] Bible
[53:27] and the Bible is a prophetic book it's a
[53:29] historical book it's a book of love it's
[53:30] a book of songs it's a book of life and
[53:33] in there you find Christ and he was in
[53:36] the prophets he was in the Psalms he was
[53:38] in the history and he also in the Bible
[53:41] is the things that is to come amen he's
[53:45] all all at all so he was before until
[53:49] after what does that make him then the
[53:51] same yesterday today and forever and
[53:55] listen he says if you in reject
[53:56] something in there that doesn't make him
[53:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:02] where do you go you got an awful picture
[54:06] for he was the history he is the prophet
[54:08] he is the Psalms he is everything and if
[54:11] you can't make him everything the same
[54:14] where's your picture look like do you
[54:15] see it he is the thing amen he was the
[54:19] prophets he was in them he was in the
[54:21] Psalms in the history in the things to
[54:22] come the same yesterday today and
[54:24] forever now listen to this
[54:27] he says then if he is that then he
[54:31] should be the Principal theme of our
[54:34] talking
[54:35] yes amen amen the principal theme of our
[54:39] talking you know uh I get Disturbed when
[54:44] people that claim to follow this message
[54:47] put more emphasis on following Brother
[54:49] brandom than they do on Jesus Christ
[54:52] because this message is Jesus Christ
[54:54] amen amen
[54:56] amen he now we we don't want to take
[54:59] anything away from brother brandham and
[55:00] what God did Mighty Prophet amen a
[55:03] mighty vessel but brother sister he came
[55:05] to introduce me to
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:09] someone amen he came to he came to bring
[55:12] a restored word so that I could know
[55:16] Jesus Christ as he is amen I honor the
[55:20] man I honor the prophet I thank God for
[55:23] him the sacrifice and the things that he
[55:24] went through but but brother sister it
[55:27] says in Malachi I send you
[55:32] yeah amen do you ever read that that way
[55:34] brother I send you Elijah the prophet
[55:39] amen he came because we
[55:43] needed to know God as he really
[55:47] is amen oh
[55:50] my thank you Lord I get stirred when I
[55:53] think about that brother amen so many
[55:55] people they put they they put the the if
[55:58] they put it all in brother brandham yeah
[56:00] amen and there's nothing for anybody
[56:01] else to do because it's all brother Bram
[56:03] well he's the only one that could pray
[56:04] for the sick he's the only one that
[56:05] could do this we can't do anything until
[56:07] he comes
[56:10] back but the Bible says I send you he he
[56:14] he was sent to
[56:16] us hallelujah the emphasis wasn't on
[56:20] eleazer Amen oh my amen elazar was sent
[56:25] now now it gets complicated cuz he's
[56:27] part of the Bride too amen he's a son
[56:30] amen amen so he's part of that am but in
[56:34] his office he's eler amen amen bringing
[56:37] us to
[56:38] Isaac we're introduced to
[56:42] someone restored word amen so this is
[56:45] what he says he says and he was faithful
[56:48] that's what I appreciate about him
[56:49] always pointed to Christ never pointed
[56:52] to himself amen he says this he says
[56:54] then if he is that then he should be the
[56:58] Principal theme of our talking our
[57:01] thinking our singing amen our walks
[57:05] hallelujah amen he should be the
[57:08] Principal theme of our life amen he's
[57:11] the principal theme of The Bible and the
[57:13] Bible is in us then he should be the
[57:15] Principal theme of everything that we do
[57:18] say or think should be Christ amen but
[57:23] the beautiful thing is it's the true
[57:25] Christ not a false Jesus amen not a god
[57:29] of of a man's imagination so many people
[57:32] that are claiming oh yeah we serve Jesus
[57:34] oh yeah we love Jesus but they're not
[57:38] coming under the headship of the word
[57:40] when they actually receive part of him
[57:42] which is his word they say no we don't
[57:44] want that you're
[57:46] rejecting God take another Jesus amen a
[57:51] god of your imagination amen amen 1 John
[57:54] chapter 4
[57:56] uh 1 John chapter 4 verse what time did
[57:59] we start oh
[58:02] my I'm not very good with
[58:06] math 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not
[58:10] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[58:12] they are of God Amen we try the spirits
[58:16] we
[58:17] don't we've got to separate the man from
[58:20] the spirit amen because many false
[58:24] prophets are gone out into the world
[58:26] hereby you know the spirit of God every
[58:28] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[58:30] is come in the flesh amen is of God and
[58:35] every spirit that confesses not that
[58:36] Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God
[58:39] and this is that Spirit of antichrist
[58:41] where of you heard it would come and
[58:43] even now already is in the world you are
[58:46] of God little children and have overcome
[58:49] them because greater is he that is in
[58:52] you than he that is in the world oh my
[58:57] they are of the world therefore speak
[58:59] they of the world and the world Hearth
[59:01] them but we are of God he that knoweth
[59:05] God heareth
[59:07] [Music]
[59:09] us why those that hear God know or those
[59:14] that that knoweth God heareth us amen
[59:17] he's saying because we're giving you the
[59:19] true
[59:20] word and if you know God and you've got
[59:23] that connection you know the person of
[59:25] the word
[59:26] amen he that is not of God heareth not
[59:29] us hereby we know or hereby know we the
[59:34] spirit of truth and the spirit of air
[59:38] amen now listen listen to this this is
[59:40] um this is out of uh the the revelation
[59:43] of Jesus Christ brother BR says now
[59:46] remember this Christ in the true church
[59:48] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[59:51] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[59:53] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[59:55] into the church and defile it making it
[59:57] lukewarm formal and Powerless amen amen
[1:00:02] and I don't know what the B the Baptist
[1:00:05] message believers do with
[1:00:07] that amen you can't have a lukewarm
[1:00:11] formal religion amen
[1:00:14] amen even if you put a message label on
[1:00:16] it yes amen just saying its message
[1:00:19] doesn't make it not formal not lukewarm
[1:00:22] and not powerless amen amen amen
[1:00:27] I know some people don't like that but
[1:00:29] it's true anyway amen it exposes Satan
[1:00:32] revealing his
[1:00:34] works and his works are the attempted
[1:00:37] destruction of God's people and the
[1:00:39] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:00:43] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[1:00:46] Fire he's
[1:00:48] persistent he probably preaching
[1:00:51] preaching unbelief as he goes down into
[1:00:53] the Lake of Fire
[1:00:57] he fights that he cannot stand it see
[1:01:00] that's his
[1:01:01] nature he knows listen to this he knows
[1:01:06] that if the people get the true
[1:01:09] revelation of the true
[1:01:11] church and what she is and what she
[1:01:16] stands for and that she can do the
[1:01:19] Greater Works amen she will be an
[1:01:22] invincible
[1:01:24] Army oh
[1:01:26] Hallelujah if she can get that true
[1:01:30] revelation of the true
[1:01:33] church what she is what she stands for
[1:01:36] and that she now can do the Greater
[1:01:39] Works you see that's what the opening of
[1:01:41] the seals did for us that's what the res
[1:01:45] restoration of the book of redemption
[1:01:47] did for us amen she is the true church
[1:01:52] amen he says she will be an invincible
[1:01:55] Army if she gets that Revelation listen
[1:01:56] to this now if they get a true
[1:01:59] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[1:02:03] framework of the
[1:02:06] church amen within the framework of the
[1:02:10] Christian church he says now those two
[1:02:13] Spirits that's he's not talking about
[1:02:15] within the framework of the true church
[1:02:17] but the Christian Church the two Spirits
[1:02:21] at work who is it it's Cain and Abel
[1:02:25] it's Esau and Jacob it's Judas and Jesus
[1:02:29] amen it's the two Spirits at work inside
[1:02:32] the framework of the church amen and by
[1:02:35] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:02:39] Antichrist Spirit hallelujah oh my by
[1:02:44] God's spirit so this is this is our
[1:02:46] calling amen we are called to discern
[1:02:49] and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen
[1:02:54] now the Antichrist it's an anointing
[1:02:56] that can get on anyone right it it's it
[1:02:59] can come from all different it can come
[1:03:01] from the sweetest person you'll
[1:03:04] know amen that's right God's spirit
[1:03:07] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:03:10] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:03:13] her
[1:03:15] amen he will be as definitely thed today
[1:03:18] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:03:20] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:03:22] desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we
[1:03:26] love it with true Revelation in our
[1:03:28] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:03:31] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:03:34] amen amen so how does this happen it
[1:03:39] comes by putting yourself under the
[1:03:41] headship of the word amen amen amen how
[1:03:45] do you how do you withstand it he he
[1:03:49] gave the example of Christ withstanding
[1:03:51] the effort of Satan in the desert he did
[1:03:54] it with the word amen right Satan came
[1:03:58] under he came to him with bi with a
[1:04:01] Bible under his arm right and he tried
[1:04:04] to quote him the
[1:04:07] word is that right amen you know that
[1:04:11] that Satan when he rebelled he rebelled
[1:04:13] in
[1:04:14] church he was the lead worshipper amen
[1:04:18] that's what brother brandom's talking
[1:04:19] about it's within the framework of the
[1:04:21] church amen amen you know Satan of
[1:04:25] course of course he's out there roaring
[1:04:27] as a you know out there as a roaring
[1:04:29] lion with the Hell's Angels but he's
[1:04:31] also sitting next to you on the
[1:04:34] Pew amen and so we have to put ourselves
[1:04:40] under the headship of the word that's
[1:04:43] the protection and we're instructed to
[1:04:45] try the spirits if the spirit is
[1:04:48] speaking through your friend or a family
[1:04:50] member it doesn't matter you must
[1:04:52] discern the spirit that's speaking
[1:04:55] example that we would use is Peter
[1:04:58] here's one of God Christ's closest men
[1:05:02] he's the one that's going to get the
[1:05:03] keys in fact he's the one that got the
[1:05:05] Revelation that and he got the Keys of
[1:05:07] the Kingdom right and he's the one that
[1:05:10] begins to speak to Jesus and says no no
[1:05:12] no Lord you can't go do that yeah Jesus
[1:05:16] discerns the spirit yeah right he turns
[1:05:19] to Peter and he says get thee behind me
[1:05:22] Satan
[1:05:23] amen amen amen man if your pastor told
[1:05:27] that you might I'm going to go find
[1:05:29] another P Pastor bless God I won't go in
[1:05:31] that church again right but he was
[1:05:36] Discerning the
[1:05:37] spirit is that right and man he wasn't
[1:05:41] he didn't treat it with kid gloves
[1:05:42] either no he Satan get thee behind me
[1:05:46] now Peter to his credit he accepted the
[1:05:49] correction he oh you know I didn't
[1:05:51] realize that was that was the spirit of
[1:05:53] antichrist anointing Peter
[1:05:56] amen and Peter had to come under the
[1:05:59] headship of the
[1:06:00] word but we deal not with flesh and
[1:06:03] blood but with principalities and Powers
[1:06:05] with Spirits
[1:06:07] amen so we're instructed to try the
[1:06:11] spirits and if the spirit is saying that
[1:06:15] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:06:17] and forever in every way except for the
[1:06:20] physical body that's the spirit of God
[1:06:23] Amen but the spirit of antichrist says
[1:06:26] something different amen it makes a
[1:06:29] caveat it makes an exception well
[1:06:33] except amen amen amen Jesus Christ is
[1:06:37] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:40] you and and and he's still a Healer he's
[1:06:43] still the Mighty God well except for
[1:06:45] your case because it's you know because
[1:06:46] of this and this and
[1:06:49] this what spirit is
[1:06:52] that amen what spirit is that try that
[1:06:56] spirit
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:01] amen so you have to look at the spirit
[1:07:04] and see is it trying to give you a false
[1:07:07] gospel is it trying to point you to a
[1:07:10] historic Christ is it saying well you
[1:07:13] know we we used to have those types of
[1:07:16] things happen in the church but no
[1:07:18] longer because it was only for that past
[1:07:21] day or when uh the prophet was on the
[1:07:23] scene or that's the way it used to be
[1:07:26] we had Revival in our church that way
[1:07:28] one you know 50 years ago but no longer
[1:07:31] it's a different age
[1:07:33] now he's still the same yes amen amen
[1:07:37] he's still the same Amen brother and
[1:07:39] sister this is a uniting time this is
[1:07:42] not a historical reading
[1:07:44] time amen it's not enough to have a
[1:07:48] historic concept of a historical God
[1:07:51] you've got to unite with a present Jesus
[1:07:54] amen we're uniting with him because he
[1:07:58] is here now amen and he's here and he's
[1:08:01] the same as he's always been but now we
[1:08:04] know him because the word's been
[1:08:06] restored amen now we can Unite with him
[1:08:12] amen amen let me read you this uh little
[1:08:15] quote here from the voice of God in the
[1:08:16] last days brother Abraham says he says
[1:08:19] then did you notice after Adam listened
[1:08:21] to another Voice besides God's voice he
[1:08:25] his own wife he listened to his own wife
[1:08:29] who was giving him an
[1:08:31] antichrist gospel
[1:08:34] amen and the church is listening to the
[1:08:37] voice of her
[1:08:39] organization injecting into them Creeds
[1:08:42] instead of the word letting them live
[1:08:45] any way they want to as long as they go
[1:08:47] to church and be a member of a certain
[1:08:50] church that's all that matters the
[1:08:53] closest connection that that believer
[1:08:55] has has on Earth to them is the church
[1:08:57] but the real believer the closest
[1:09:00] connection is the Holy Spirit and is
[1:09:03] God's
[1:09:05] word amen this is from the message a
[1:09:09] prisoner God is looking for prisoners
[1:09:12] he's always done it you might search it
[1:09:16] through the Scripture A a man has to be
[1:09:19] a prisoner to
[1:09:21] Christ against
[1:09:23] anything therefore you cannot be
[1:09:26] connected with anything but Christ
[1:09:29] hallelujah amen even your father your
[1:09:32] mother your brother your sister your
[1:09:35] husband your wife anybody you're only
[1:09:38] connected with
[1:09:40] Christ and him only then God can use you
[1:09:45] until then he
[1:09:47] can't going out sometimes it speaks
[1:09:50] rough to people see I'm trying to get
[1:09:51] you to cut loose you've got to have a
[1:09:54] starting place like someone calls out
[1:09:56] the women bobbing their hair and wearing
[1:09:57] these clothes and hold and maintain
[1:10:00] their Christian profession and say
[1:10:02] that's a little
[1:10:03] thing you see they say oh that's a
[1:10:06] little thing that doesn't matter really
[1:10:08] then why did God write it in his
[1:10:10] word amen God will God is expressing a
[1:10:14] desire and you're saying n well no big
[1:10:16] deal what God
[1:10:18] wants amen that's what they're
[1:10:21] saying he says well you've got to start
[1:10:24] somewhere so begin there with your ABCs
[1:10:26] what is ABC always believe Christ amen
[1:10:29] in other words come under the headship
[1:10:30] of the word amen cut loose the worldy
[1:10:33] looks anyhow and become a prisoner to
[1:10:35] Christ and then just keep on Cut Loose
[1:10:37] of everything till the last final cut is
[1:10:39] cut loose and then you're a prisoner
[1:10:41] then you become in his grip and he's got
[1:10:44] you in his grip amen amen we're going to
[1:10:48] quickly wrap this up here this afternoon
[1:10:50] uh Revelation book of
[1:10:52] symbols but Abraham says like the great
[1:10:54] water lily that the little tiny seed
[1:10:57] borne way down in the bottom of a myy
[1:10:59] Mucky dirty frog scummy Pond and it
[1:11:01] winds its way up to the darkness through
[1:11:03] all the mud and scum and becomes the
[1:11:05] finest thing you could ever look at the
[1:11:06] face of with Radiance like
[1:11:09] sunshine so is the Church of the Living
[1:11:11] God that's been born down in the mud of
[1:11:14] fanaticism and chaos but she's wound up
[1:11:17] through the grime and she's on top of
[1:11:19] the thing just waiting for her wings of
[1:11:21] flight many will run to and fro and the
[1:11:24] people that know their God shall do
[1:11:26] exploits in that day God's Revelations
[1:11:29] to his church set still Little Flock

[1:11:35] are Amen in other words he's telling the
[1:11:38] eve of this day stay under the word stay

[1:11:49] worry God is waiting and trying and
[1:11:51] pressing to get it the mystery of God
[1:11:53] revealed to his church that's what's
[1:11:55] holding back the coming of Christ now in
[1:11:57] the great Millennium is this
[1:11:58] Supernatural power that lays dormant in
[1:12:01] the church oh
[1:12:04] my praise the
[1:12:07] Lord okay trying to wrap this up but I

[1:12:16] right this is what is the Holy Ghost now
[1:12:20] now the spirit of God has worked under
[1:12:22] justification under Luther
[1:12:23] sanctification under Wesley the baptism
[1:12:26] of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and
[1:12:29] here it is in the last day performing
[1:12:32] and doing the very same thing that it
[1:12:34] did when it was in Christ what is it the
[1:12:37] church and Christ has become one you see
[1:12:41] we came up through those other ages
[1:12:44] those Restorations but now brother
[1:12:46] sister it's a uniting Time amen amen the
[1:12:51] church and Christ become one he says as
[1:12:52] soon as they connect together that Last
[1:12:56] Link they'll go through the sky shouting
[1:13:00] hallelujah amen you see that's what
[1:13:02] we're doing in this hour amen up will
[1:13:05] come Wesley up will come Luther all the
[1:13:07] rest of them back in those days they're
[1:13:09] waiting on us amen amen we which are
[1:13:12] alive and remain shall not hinder
[1:13:14] prevent those which have gone before in
[1:13:16] the grave they're waiting on us to come
[1:13:18] to our position amen they're waiting on
[1:13:21] this bride this body of Christ to be
[1:13:23] fully formed in this house
[1:13:26] amen and we will not prevent them every
[1:13:29] other age has hindered the
[1:13:32] resurrection every other age has
[1:13:35] prevented it because they haven't had
[1:13:38] full complete obedience to the word they
[1:13:41] haven't come under the headship of the
[1:13:43] full word because the word wasn't
[1:13:45] restored to them amen God allowed it and
[1:13:49] winked at their ignorance amen but now
[1:13:51] with the restored word they had to come
[1:13:53] under subjection to the world that was
[1:13:55] revealed in that day amen and we have
[1:13:58] the full word in our day amen he says up
[1:14:01] will come Wesley up will come Luther all
[1:14:02] the rest of them the first that will be
[1:14:05] last and the last will be first and
[1:14:06] there come the resurrection we're at the
[1:14:08] end time listen that's what the Holy
[1:14:11] Ghost does the Holy Ghost by
[1:14:13] justification just a light shadow of it
[1:14:16] the Holy Ghost by sanctification a
[1:14:18] little deeper of shadow of it the Holy
[1:14:21] Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper
[1:14:23] Shadow he's talking about the baptism at
[1:14:25] isua street right the outpouring but he
[1:14:28] says listen to this he says now the Holy
[1:14:32] Ghost by the restoration of its very
[1:14:35] person being in
[1:14:38] here forming signs and wonders like he
[1:14:41] did at the beginning woo Glory going to
[1:14:44] call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might
[1:14:46] as well get started now amen amen that's
[1:14:50] when we what happens when we fully
[1:14:52] submit to the headship amen amen amen
[1:14:55] it's the very person of God Amen the
[1:14:59] very word restored the holy spirit in
[1:15:01] the person of God now here uniting with
[1:15:06] us so what happens when we fully submit
[1:15:09] to that it's the opposite of what
[1:15:11] happened to Eve amen amen hallelujah she
[1:15:15] didn't have the victory because she
[1:15:17] stepped out from behind the
[1:15:19] word but we have the victory when we
[1:15:21] stay under the word amen amen uh a a a
[1:15:25] lady or a sister as long as she stays
[1:15:27] under the headship of her husband she's
[1:15:30] good right she's doing what God has
[1:15:32] called her to do and brother sister it's
[1:15:35] the same with the church staying under
[1:15:37] the headship of the word amen

[1:15:47] said in Eden they were safe in God's
[1:15:49] Pavilion what is that Pavilion safe in
[1:15:52] the word shielded in the word of God
[1:15:56] under the headship of Christ amen full
[1:15:59] Satan couldn't get to them and he can't
[1:16:02] get to you in the Holy Ghost either amen
[1:16:05] but he says notice she pulled the veil
[1:16:07] off but there's a bride in this last day
[1:16:11] amen that won't pull that Veil off until
[1:16:13] it's time for her to be you know joined
[1:16:16] together with her bridegroom amen but
