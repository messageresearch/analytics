[56:59] where you sit before his feet
[57:01] and then you worship him
[57:04] the point where the ceiling begins to

[57:52] and you've
[58:05] and you're standing in this

[58:08] apostle john that one time
[58:11] he was standing there on the isle of
[58:13] patmos
[58:15] he put there in prison by the governor
[58:18] of the land
[58:34] i revealed
[58:48] i've become
[59:30] give me that mountain
[59:32] gave me the results of that revelation
[59:36] amen we've come to fulfill it amen
[59:39] i mean hey man let's just open our
[59:40] bibles
[59:43] first thessalonians
[59:55] my notes are a mess complete mess this
[59:58] morning
[1:00:10] finally we just came up here with what
[1:00:11] we
[1:00:12] had so many people
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:17] just trusting in the lord
[1:00:21] knowing that he always has a message for
[1:00:23] his son
[1:00:26] amen and it's not for the minister to
[1:00:28] come up here and try to impress the
[1:00:31] people
[1:00:35] it's not the minister's job to
[1:00:38] try to make the people think that he
[1:00:40] knows more about the bible than anybody
[1:00:42] else
[1:00:46] i this morning i'm in the same position
[1:00:52] i came into this
[1:00:53] place in obedience
[1:01:06] amen when he comes into this place he's
[1:01:08] coming to be the same yesterday today
[1:01:10] and forever
[1:01:14] and i with you i'm looking for the
[1:01:16] fulfillment of scriptures
[1:01:20] scriptures have been laid up amongst all
[1:01:22] the
[1:01:26] i have come down to this day the
[1:01:28] scriptures that must still be fulfilled
[1:01:34] amen and we have received revelation
[1:01:36] that those scriptures must be fulfilled
[1:01:38] in us
[1:01:44] and underneath this message of the last
[1:01:46] day angel
[1:01:50] the angel
[1:02:01] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:02:43] a responsibility
[1:02:49] to stand up and to come underneath the
[1:02:51] fulfillment of those scriptures
[1:02:56] now several weeks ago or a few months
[1:02:58] ago
[1:03:01] i preached a message called
[1:03:03] i was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:03:06] vision
[1:03:11] and as i was studying i just couldn't
[1:03:13] get away from that that message the
[1:03:16] notes i had before me
[1:03:21] and so not to re-preach the same message
[1:03:24] over again
[1:03:27] but to continue on with that thought
[1:03:32] as we know there is a bride in this last
[1:03:34] day
[1:03:37] and i i with you is
[1:03:39] come underneath that revelation
[1:04:07] with signs and wonders that have not
[1:04:10] taken place in 2 000 years
[1:04:16] where a sign of the messiah has been
[1:04:18] revealed
[1:04:21] not that that messenger was the messiah
[1:04:36] and when we saw we saw that that that
[1:04:39] message go forward
[1:04:43] as we listen to those tapes
[1:04:47] there is something about that that
[1:04:49] seems familiar
[1:04:55] that the same lord and savior that we
[1:04:57] have loved and adored and worshipped
[1:05:03] was revealing himself against
[1:05:18] that seems so familiar
[1:05:31] i'm not talking about the flesh of
[1:05:32] brother branham now don't get confused
[1:05:47] just like when jesus christ himself
[1:05:49] walked the earth so what comes just
[1:05:52] remember bringing our treasures from
[1:05:54] heaven amen
[1:05:55] feelings and signs and wonders
[1:05:58] like in the days of abraham bringing out
[1:06:00] the treasures of heaven
[1:06:16] let's read from first thessalonians
[1:06:18] chapter four
[1:06:21] verse 17.
[1:06:24] i will start with the 16th verse
[1:06:27] for the lord himself
[1:06:30] shall the sin from heaven with a shout
[1:06:33] with the voice of an archangel and with
[1:06:35] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:06:38] shall rise first
[1:06:43] you saw that compared to
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] but saint paul continues
[1:07:12] as he's setting the the last days in
[1:07:14] order here
[1:07:16] explaining to the people of his age and
[1:07:18] the people of all ages
[1:07:21] how the coming of the lord will be
[1:07:25] he
[1:07:26] says
[1:07:28] then
[1:07:30] we which are alive and remain
[1:07:35] shall be caught up together
[1:07:38] with them in the clouds
[1:07:52] there's going to be someone who's going
[1:07:53] to be alive
[1:08:18] it's you lord jesus that has the
[1:08:20] preeminence in our lives
[1:08:24] and we surrender our lives to you this
[1:08:26] morning
[1:08:27] lord you are the one that we adore
[1:08:30] you're the only one lord that we
[1:08:32] recognize
[1:08:34] and it's unto you father we dedicate our
[1:08:36] every moment of our every breath or
[1:08:38] every life
[1:08:44] lord we just dedicate this day this
[1:08:46] morning to you
[1:08:48] have thine own way amongst your brides
[1:08:55] amen amen amen you can be seated
[1:09:08] i know that
[1:09:10] we are all the same
[1:09:13] you know there's not really a difference
[1:09:15] amongst us
[1:09:18] we all here have come into this age
[1:09:22] none of us really knowing what to do
[1:09:26] as god in his own
[1:09:29] self
[1:09:32] had the choice of where to place us in
[1:09:34] time
[1:09:38] as our names were written in the lamb's
[1:09:39] book of life before the foundation of
[1:09:41] the world
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:45] as we preached before we came into this
[1:09:48] age to express the life of jesus christ
[1:09:54] for as our names were written upon that
[1:09:56] book of the lamb
[1:10:00] that book was not the the book of our
[1:10:03] life
[1:10:06] or the book of of of what we would live
[1:10:12] but our names were assigned upon the
[1:10:14] lamb's book
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:22] that we would express the life of the
[1:10:24] lamb on the earth
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:43] of the lamb of god upon this earth
[1:10:48] that when people see you walking down
[1:10:51] the street
[1:10:53] when they see you at school or at your
[1:10:55] job
[1:11:08] that there's something about your life
[1:11:09] that seems familiar to them
[1:11:14] because your name has been so entwined
[1:11:17] with the life of the lamb of god
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:21] but as they get to know you they begin
[1:11:24] to realize i know who
[1:11:38] or your own earthly power
[1:11:41] but the power of the almighty god has
[1:11:43] transformed you
[1:11:46] into the image of the heavenly father
[1:11:50] and we did not come into this earth
[1:12:06] and
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:15] and i ordained you to be the bride of
[1:13:17] christ
[1:13:20] is that what he told the prophet
[1:13:23] jeremiah or isaiah
[1:13:26] before you were formed in the mother's
[1:13:28] womb
[1:13:30] i
[1:13:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:50] that because he wrote our names upon
[1:13:52] that book
[1:13:54] he ordained us
[1:13:56] to be their bride
[1:14:24] but it takes a bride
[1:14:53] but we are the creation of elohim
[1:15:00] amen amen the creation of elohim
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] the god who existed
[1:15:22] we
[1:15:36] above
[1:15:50] the invisible
[1:16:04] is
[1:16:18] said that there was a title deed to that
[1:16:21] to that to that what they they lost
[1:16:27] whatever it is that they lost
[1:16:31] there is a deed to that ownership of
[1:16:33] what they lost
[1:16:38] they lost their sonship
[1:16:43] they lost their position in the heavens
[1:16:58] as they began to
[1:17:00] wander through the land
[1:17:03] lost their inheritance
[1:17:08] that deed went back to the one that gave
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:25] and you know when you buy a house here
[1:17:27] in the united states
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:55] the english were very particular about
[1:17:57] how they described their deeds
[1:18:02] they don't want to leave any doubt about
[1:18:04] it
[1:18:06] you gotta describe exactly how many
[1:18:08] inches of land you have
[1:18:13] what the boundaries of it are
[1:18:16] and so here in the united states we took
[1:18:18] up that old english system
[1:18:24] we took the land from the indians
[1:18:28] through various methods
[1:18:31] through treaties
[1:18:35] through
[1:18:36] war
[1:18:38] through cheating
[1:18:42] in various ways
[1:18:45] to get this country
[1:18:47] get this land
[1:18:49] sit there and as soon as the government
[1:18:51] of the united states
[1:18:56] we now have this land
[1:18:59] however it is that they obtained it
[1:19:03] that they begin to write our
[1:19:07] we deeds a house you know
[1:19:09] uh one of our first houses we bought
[1:19:14] we never got to see the deed
[1:19:18] the deed is on file at the county
[1:19:20] courthouse
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:49] as someone who wants to buy that
[1:19:51] property
[1:19:54] they don't have the full amount of money
[1:19:57] to buy that property
[1:20:01] so they put a down payment on it
[1:20:07] and the bank owns the rest
[1:20:12] and the abstract describes
[1:20:16] how much of it that you own
[1:20:20] and how much of it the bank owns
[1:20:24] and then if someone else says they have
[1:20:26] a right to put a lien upon that property
[1:20:44] yes
[1:20:57] and that and that abstract will describe
[1:20:59] every lien that's ever been on that
[1:21:01] property
[1:21:05] every mortgage that's ever been on that
[1:21:07] property
[1:21:11] if there's any mortgage or lien that has
[1:21:13] not been paid off
[1:21:18] then no one can ever really say i
[1:21:20] actually own this property
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] because the ownership of that deed is
[1:21:27] split
[1:21:31] there's a doubt there of who actually
[1:21:33] owns that property
[1:21:38] i'd like to invite you over to my house
[1:21:46] well the bank actually owns part of it
[1:21:51] but they don't say i'd like to invite
[1:21:52] you over to the bank's house
[1:22:05] hey man you know i think about how many
[1:22:07] doubts have been in
[1:22:36] i'd like to invite you to my church the
[1:22:38] mess of this church
[1:22:42] but still when he goes through the books
[1:22:43] of acts there are still some doubts that
[1:22:45] were made
[1:22:48] of whether the methodist church could
[1:22:50] ever be the book of acts church
[1:22:56] or like the baptist church i'd like to
[1:22:58] invite you to the baptist church
[1:23:02] but when i opened in my bible and i
[1:23:03] start reading to the book of acts
[1:23:18] but there is a doubt of who actually
[1:23:20] owns the church
[1:23:23] because they have a down payment on the
[1:23:25] word
[1:23:28] they'll receive though
[1:23:30] they receive the part of the word that
[1:23:32] says uh that you speak with your mouth
[1:23:38] if you testify that you believe with
[1:23:40] your mouth
[1:23:43] that you are a christian
[1:23:46] or when you baptize you are a christian
[1:23:50] or when you're when the elders lay hands
[1:23:52] upon you that confer the holy spirit
[1:23:54] upon you
[1:23:58] or when you partake of the holy
[1:23:59] eucharist
[1:24:02] that you receive the holy ghost of all
[1:24:07] and all these different doctrines of
[1:24:09] men's throughout the ages
[1:24:12] that they have a word that they that
[1:24:14] they that they live by
[1:24:19] but then our denomination comes and says
[1:24:21] no but we major on this word over here
[1:24:25] and not that word over there
[1:24:28] and where is the abstract title what is
[1:24:30] the abstract describing in this last day
[1:24:36] where is the deed to the gospel
[1:24:40] where is that deed that gives you a
[1:24:42] right to go and say i own this land
[1:24:47] where is that gospel it says that the
[1:24:49] book of acts is ours
[1:24:53] every promise in the book is mine
[1:25:10] this over here
[1:25:23] you listen to those messages
[1:25:27] it begins to impart a faith to you
[1:25:32] to come and take the whole world
[1:25:38] because that is what the bride will be
[1:25:39] in the last days
[1:25:43] someone that is in love with the entire
[1:25:45] world
[1:25:48] every scripture they say that one's mine
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:03] someone was saying their day about
[1:26:04] they're talking about a church
[1:26:21] so the pastor oh the pastor
[1:26:24] took the photo and put it out in the
[1:26:26] vestibule
[1:26:29] and then a different group of people in
[1:26:31] the church were upset
[1:26:47] and i have no idols upon this hurt
[1:26:52] but i will tell you this
[1:26:56] that if god has done something in our
[1:26:58] day
[1:27:01] i'm gonna love it
[1:27:15] and i think he i think the rich young
[1:27:17] ruler there is far less worthy to be in
[1:27:19] the sanctuary
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] but i tell you but if our lord has come
[1:27:28] down in our day i don't see
[1:27:37] yeah i think it's it's good for us
[1:27:41] to love anything that the holy spirit
[1:27:43] has done they made
[1:27:57] it's the fact that god has done
[1:27:59] something in our age
[1:28:02] something that caused us to stand up
[1:28:06] and not be baptized
[1:28:08] not to be lutherans
[1:28:11] not to be pentecostals
[1:28:15] but to be that bride of christ it was
[1:28:17] prophesied to be here
[1:28:20] in the last days when we see the israel
[1:28:24] gathering themselves back into their
[1:28:25] homelands
[1:28:36] as the jews were scattered to all the
[1:28:39] world just like it said would happen
[1:28:45] but then all of a sudden in the 1940s
[1:28:50] something began to happen
[1:28:53] and jews from all over the world began
[1:28:55] hopping on airplanes
[1:28:58] and airplanes from all the from africa
[1:29:02] from europe
[1:29:03] from all the corners of the earth
[1:29:06] they began color game upon this little
[1:29:08] chunk of land in the middle east
[1:29:14] what is happening
[1:29:17] the jews are getting ready in the
[1:29:19] natural
[1:29:22] nature
[1:29:23] in the natural to receive christ
[1:29:27] now the holy spirit will come to them
[1:29:31] but the holy spirit will not come to
[1:29:33] them
[1:29:36] until
[1:29:45] so in 1948 the jews stood up there hello
[1:30:13] the birth of a new state to be called
[1:30:15] israel
[1:30:20] and that the old
[1:30:21] star six star
[1:30:24] flag of david
[1:30:29] will be flying once again
[1:30:46] and every war
[1:31:01] but yet they've been gathering in there
[1:31:03] by their own natural strengths
[1:31:07] god is leading them they don't know why
[1:31:10] they don't know how
[1:31:13] like the animals going into the ark you
[1:31:15] know his ark
[1:31:18] they are leaving their countries behind
[1:31:20] and coming into israel
[1:31:24] they say but brother it's 2021
[1:31:43] we have a promise here
[1:31:46] that those that are alive and remain
[1:31:52] there is going to be someone who is
[1:31:53] going to be alive and remain at the
[1:31:55] coming of the lord
[1:32:01] there's another scripture i want to call
[1:32:03] your attention to yeah you know
[1:32:06] revelations
[1:32:13] i think all of us believe
[1:32:18] that
[1:32:19] before israel
[1:32:22] before the holy spirit comes back to
[1:32:24] israel
[1:32:36] tribulation will strike the world
[1:32:40] moses and elijah will appear again in
[1:32:43] israel
[1:32:46] they'll preach by the power of the holy
[1:32:48] ghost for three and a half years
[1:33:03] saith the lord
[1:33:08] amen but before that happens
[1:33:12] there has to be a rapture of the bride
[1:33:14] of christ
[1:33:18] it has been revealed to us that we are
[1:33:20] that people
[1:33:29] and just as much as those jews got on
[1:33:32] those airplanes
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:53] just like the jews will receive the
[1:33:55] message of moses and elijah
[1:34:01] so is there elijah for the gentiles
[1:34:07] the gentile church in the last days
[1:34:11] receives her elijah
[1:34:14] and by the message of that elijah
[1:34:50] have sent my angel to testify unto you
[1:34:53] these things in the churches
[1:34:58] i am the root in the offspring of david
[1:35:02] and the bright morning star
[1:35:05] he is the saint
[1:35:08] jesus christ is the same throughout all
[1:35:10] the ages
[1:35:12] he has not changed one bit
[1:35:15] and he has sent his angel amongst the
[1:35:17] churches
[1:35:19] to testify that jesus christ is the same
[1:35:23] and we have received that angel's
[1:35:25] message
[1:35:37] and the spirit and the bride stand up
[1:35:40] and begin speaking
[1:35:45] now verse 17 it starts off with and the
[1:35:48] spirit and the bride say come
[1:35:51] on
[1:35:53] now that could not take place
[1:35:57] unless there is an invisible union of
[1:35:59] the bride in christ
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] by the power of this revealed word
[1:36:08] the spirit of god stands up upon the
[1:36:10] earth
[1:36:13] and the bride of christ stands up upon
[1:36:15] the earth
[1:36:17] and they unite together
[1:36:21] and they begin to speak in one accord
[1:36:26] now in the in the beginning of the book
[1:36:28] of revelation
[1:36:31] we see christ alone
[1:36:34] speaking about his deity
[1:36:50] but after that deity was expressed
[1:36:54] and after it was revealed that jesus and
[1:36:56] christ and god were one
[1:37:00] that they were one and they're united
[1:37:06] that's what was happened to the
[1:37:08] the the the
[1:37:09] revelation of baptism in this last day
[1:37:16] not that there was three gods
[1:37:18] yet one
[1:37:19] not that we are to be baptized in the
[1:37:21] name of the father
[1:37:22] in the name of the son
[1:37:24] and the name of the holy ghost
[1:37:26] but through the revelation that there is
[1:37:28] only one name
[1:37:31] and that is the name of the lord jesus
[1:37:33] christ
[1:37:36] jesus christ the father was revealed to
[1:37:38] the world
[1:37:41] have i been with you so long
[1:37:59] these 2 000 years and
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:14] who
[1:38:32] and even if you ever if you ever get to
[1:38:35] know a a catholic theologian
[1:38:41] to dive down with them and break down
[1:38:43] the the trinity doctrine with them
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:49] and get down to the very foundation of
[1:38:52] the trinitarian doctrine according to a
[1:38:54] catholic theologian
[1:39:25] that it was not the name of the father
[1:39:28] and the name of the son
[1:39:31] and the name of the holy ghost
[1:39:33] but as acts 2 38 said
[1:39:38] in the name of the father the son and
[1:39:40] the holy ghost
[1:39:43] that is one name amen
[1:39:46] and when they in obedience to that
[1:39:48] commandment
[1:39:50] the disciples went out baptizing in the
[1:39:52] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:39:58] and for 300 years the disciples kept
[1:40:01] going on and on and on baptizing in the
[1:40:04] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:19] that they said let's all gather together
[1:40:23] and bring all the best ideas that men
[1:40:26] can come up with
[1:40:31] 314 years after the birth of christ
[1:40:49] some doctrines that satan had brought
[1:40:51] into the church
[1:40:54] afraid those doctrines would take over
[1:40:57] and out of fear they had to lock down
[1:40:59] upon a men's doctrine
[1:41:14] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:41:25] whoever will let them take of the water
[1:41:27] of life
[1:41:34] you remember
[1:41:37] like i said a few
[1:41:39] months ago i preached a message called i
[1:41:41] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:41:42] vision
[1:41:49] you remember he preached that message to
[1:41:50] king agrippa
[1:41:56] king or saint paul been thrown into
[1:41:58] prison for preaching the gospel
[1:42:03] the romans didn't know what to do with
[1:42:05] them
[1:42:07] so they sent him from one man to another
[1:42:09] man
[1:42:11] one prison to another
[1:42:27] heard so much about the jews religion
[1:42:32] that he halfway believed in jehovah
[1:42:34] himself
[1:42:39] and when he heard the the supernatural
[1:42:41] ministry of saint paul
[1:42:47] and he just he just he wanted to hear
[1:42:49] what paul had to say
[1:42:53] and so he brought paul into the king's
[1:42:56] courts
[1:43:01] to so that paul could
[1:43:03] tell him the message
[1:43:07] as paul began to share
[1:43:09] his his testimony
[1:43:14] he said ok agrippa
[1:43:16] i was i was
[1:43:19] one of the the elders of the jews
[1:43:21] religion
[1:43:30] and as i went from land to land i heard
[1:43:33] about the
[1:43:35] the followers of jesus
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:51] but i was on my way to damascus one day
[1:43:57] and a light came down from heaven
[1:44:02] does anybody ever here believe that that
[1:44:04] light actually came
[1:44:16] when things are going one way to turn
[1:44:18] something around and go the other way
[1:44:24] yes
[1:44:27] so here's saint paul on the way to
[1:44:28] damascus
[1:44:32] as he's telling his testimony here to
[1:44:34] king agrippa
[1:44:38] they said i was on my donkey
[1:44:41] and this light came down
[1:44:45] and i heard a voice
[1:45:14] he is told go to this city
[1:45:18] and go to this certain man's house
[1:45:22] and have him pray for you
[1:45:26] that you will receive sight
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:42] what
[1:45:55] as he
[1:45:56] was praying one day
[1:46:00] the lord came down to him
[1:46:09] has been sweating
[1:46:10] blind he's in this city
[1:46:14] i want you to go and lay hands on him
[1:46:16] and pray for him
[1:46:18] he will receive you
[1:46:23] and the man said but
[1:46:52] and as paul was giving his testimony to
[1:46:54] king agrippa
[1:46:58] he said oh king agrippa
[1:47:01] i have not been disobedient to that
[1:47:03] heavenly vision that was shown to me
[1:47:07] i have gone and i have preached this
[1:47:09] message to every this nation under
[1:47:11] heaven
[1:47:17] responded
[1:47:19] he says you almost convinced me to be a
[1:47:21] christian
[1:47:25] and paul says i wish you were just like
[1:47:28] i was except for these chains that are
[1:47:29] around my wrists
[1:47:34] you know there's
[1:47:48] a man by the name of william branham
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:52] i was going to chicago i live in chicago
[1:47:55] and yeah ministerial association
[1:48:00] they wanted to quiz them about these
[1:48:02] doctrines
[1:48:05] but the serpents see
[1:48:08] about baptism in the name of jesus
[1:48:09] christ
[1:48:12] as he uh they are getting the meeting
[1:48:15] ready
[1:48:22] i haven't read this for a while so
[1:48:23] forgive me if i get a detail here
[1:48:29] where's carl williams
[1:48:31] got together came to brother brandon
[1:48:33] says we got the room all ready
[1:48:38] all things are ready for you to go up
[1:48:39] there
[1:48:42] brother brian i'm new how about i'm
[1:48:44] savvy
[1:48:54] i don't know what brother carl said to
[1:48:55] brother brandon but
[1:48:56] the conversation went kind of like this
[1:49:08] and brother branham said well you're not
[1:49:11] gonna get the room that you think you
[1:49:13] are
[1:49:17] you you reserve this green room but
[1:49:20] you're actually gonna get this brown
[1:49:21] room
[1:49:32] he says you're not going to have that
[1:49:34] room you're going to have this other
[1:49:35] room over here
[1:49:37] and brother graham says furthermore
[1:49:59] sure enough they had to switch rooms
[1:50:01] last minute
[1:50:03] everybody came in there and they said
[1:50:05] all set exactly how brother bram
[1:50:07] described
[1:50:20] and you're here to question me about the
[1:50:22] doctrines that i'm preaching
[1:50:25] and if anybody wants to come up here and
[1:50:27] talk to me on come get your bible stand
[1:50:29] here right next to me
[1:50:37] yo they laid a trap for him here in iowa
[1:50:42] up in waterloo
[1:50:45] i think it was there that he preached i
[1:50:47] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:50:48] vision
[1:50:53] as soon as he
[1:50:54] had all the ministers of that area
[1:50:59] came for the minister's breakfast
[1:51:04] he got up there and he says i take for
[1:51:06] my texts this morning
[1:51:09] i was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:51:12] vision
[1:51:15] men began to scoot their chairs back
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:43] now the same thing happened in brother
[1:51:46] ministry paul's ministry
[1:51:47] that happened branham's
[1:51:53] a ministry was given to him
[1:51:56] and he was not disobedient to that
[1:51:58] heavenly vision
[1:52:01] but just as much remember how brother
[1:52:03] bran preached about how they were being
[1:52:04] in ephesians
[1:52:09] he talked about how that ephesian church
[1:52:13] how they latched on to the ministry of
[1:52:16] saint paul come on you said
[1:52:19] they latched on to the ministry of saint
[1:52:21] paul
[1:52:25] and through it they began to bear the
[1:52:27] fruits
[1:52:30] and of all the letters that saint paul
[1:52:32] wrote to the different churches
[1:52:37] there's something about that of that
[1:52:38] letter to the ephesians
[1:52:41] they just seem to rise up higher and
[1:52:44] higher and higher than many others
[1:52:48] because they receive the messenger of
[1:52:50] their age
[1:52:53] amen amen
[1:52:55] and brother branham said
[1:53:24] and be obedient to the vision that was
[1:53:26] revealed
[1:53:29] christ will stand up and be united to
[1:53:31] christ
[1:53:39] amen she'll be an esther
[1:53:42] she'll be a ruth
[1:53:44] she'll be a rebecca
[1:53:47] hey man you remember how astr
[1:53:51] she
[1:53:53] went in to
[1:53:54] for the king
[1:53:58] and but she had to sit there for a year
[1:54:03] to be purified
[1:54:06] she had six months of the bitter spices
[1:54:10] in six months of the sweet spices
[1:54:17] and as she
[1:54:18] spent a year underneath those anointings
[1:54:37] and finally when it came to the day that
[1:54:39] they were present to be presented for
[1:54:41] for the king
[1:54:44] they had spent six months under the
[1:54:46] suite hello
[1:55:27] some of them still had their own ideas
[1:55:29] in their minds
[1:55:56] same thing with ruth
[1:56:00] she
[1:56:01] went before
[1:56:02] her sister-in-law or her mother-in-law
[1:56:04] in naomi
[1:56:07] and naomi gave a message sure
[1:56:12] and and set and naomi told ruth
[1:56:17] this is how you need to present yourself
[1:56:19] before boaz
[1:56:23] says look boaz has laid himself down at
[1:56:25] the threshing forward tonight
[1:56:38] anyway he lays himself down there at the
[1:56:40] field
[1:57:49] and she said spread your skirt over me
[1:57:55] she needed redemption
[1:57:57] amen
[1:57:58] he became her redeemer
[1:58:01] he became her bridegroom
[1:58:03] there's something about
[1:58:05] you know i remember when i first started
[1:58:06] preaching
[1:58:09] i had some questions about some
[1:58:11] scriptures
[1:58:14] and i
[1:58:15] went to the internet
[1:58:19] and i typed in this one scripture and i
[1:58:22] thought i'd see what other some other
[1:58:24] denominations believed about it
[1:58:30] and as soon as i did that i felt the
[1:58:32] rebuke of the holy spirit
[1:58:38] and he said don't you ever do that
[1:58:41] if you have a question about the
[1:58:43] scriptures
[1:58:44] he said come to me
[1:59:01] amen amen
[1:59:03] amen trust in the lord yes don't go to
[1:59:05] the fields of the other man
[1:59:09] remember the bride of christ is looking
[1:59:10] to her
[1:59:28] how
[1:59:41] and so eliezer as he was going
[1:59:45] he put jehovah to the task
[1:59:50] he said
[1:59:52] i want you to make this thing plain
[1:59:54] because i'm not going to make a mistake
[2:00:07] let that be the woman that is to be the
[2:00:09] bride for isaac
[2:00:22] gave her instructions of what to do
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:49] she said i will go
[2:01:48] he didn't come
[2:02:02] like the angel did to abraham
[2:02:06] and just like the angel said how why did
[2:02:09] sarah laugh
[2:02:12] brother abraham turn us back to the
[2:02:14] audience
[2:02:16] i would say
[2:02:29] you're not praying for yourself
[2:02:45] mrs jorgensen
[2:02:46] in louisville
[2:02:48] and you'll find out she has been
[2:02:49] completely and totally healed
[2:02:55] now i don't know about you
[2:02:58] but that got my attention
[2:03:08] that there had to be a spirit behind
[2:03:10] that man
[2:03:12] and he was
[2:03:23] amen and as brother branham was
[2:03:26] pondering
[2:03:50] the bride from the first stage on the
[2:03:52] day of pentecost
[2:03:57] and he saw a woman walking
[2:04:01] he said she wasn't marching
[2:04:04] he said she was walking gracefully
[2:04:14] and she was a pure bride for the lord
[2:04:16] jesus christ
[2:04:21] then the voice said i'll show you the
[2:04:23] bride of every age
[2:04:28] it's the
[2:04:30] each age had the doctrines of men began
[2:04:32] to infiltrate the church
[2:04:36] as they
[2:04:49] then he saw the last age
[2:05:00] he said she was naked from the waist up
[2:05:03] uh
[2:05:14] she had this gray covering covering the
[2:05:17] front of her
[2:05:46] i don't know if he would go and if he
[2:05:47] went to a modern church he'd say that's
[2:05:49] exactly what i saw
[2:05:55] what brother braham saw in seed form
[2:06:00] has now been
[2:06:13] twisting and shaking
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:37] he said all the efforts all the
[2:06:39] preaching all that we have done
[2:06:55] and this is the pride that we're
[2:06:56] presenting to christ
[2:06:59] but then all of a sudden he began
[2:07:01] hearing this
[2:07:02] soft singing in the distance
[2:07:07] and he's beginning to hear
[2:07:09] the the last day bright brian
[2:07:14] another bride was marching forth
[2:07:18] and he said the bride will come into
[2:07:20] preview again
[2:07:24] and
[2:07:39] with the righteousness of saints
[2:07:44] with her hair long down to her waist
[2:07:49] marching to the tune of onward christian
[2:07:51] soldiers
[2:08:04] i did not come here to be disobedient to
[2:08:06] that heavenly vision
[2:08:09] but i came here to be that last day
[2:08:11] bride
[2:08:13] march
[2:08:16] not to some dirty rock and roll song
[2:08:20] wickedness or anything like that
[2:08:24] a while back we went to a church that we
[2:08:26] grew up in
[2:08:29] this church when i was a teenager we
[2:08:31] used to go to it
[2:08:34] very large
[2:08:37] i liked it because they had a large band
[2:08:39] lost their instruments
[2:08:42] they had harps
[2:08:43] for music they had trombones
[2:08:46] they had a lot of brass instruments
[2:08:48] and it's like a full i just i just
[2:08:50] enjoyed the worship services there
[2:08:54] it was bright and well lit the the the
[2:08:57] the sanctuary was
[2:09:01] they had red carpets
[2:09:06] it was just they just really kind of put
[2:09:08] on a nice worship service there
[2:09:12] they had an older man
[2:09:15] that had grew up in the pentecostal
[2:09:18] movement way back
[2:09:20] now he was an old man
[2:09:23] and he had come marching up the aisle
[2:09:25] dancing in the spirit
[2:09:29] you know all the young folks who kind of
[2:09:31] just kind of stare at him
[2:09:35] you know but he had had an experience
[2:09:37] way back decades back
[2:09:40] and had lost
[2:09:44] a few old old saints that would speak
[2:09:46] with tongues
[2:09:50] you know as time went on those things
[2:09:52] quit happening
[2:09:56] we went back there about 10 15 years
[2:09:58] later
[2:10:11] i had a dance team up there dancing
[2:10:15] they had strobe lights going all over
[2:10:17] the place
[2:10:20] they had a fog machine the fog would
[2:10:22] drift across the platform
[2:10:26] platformer all the instruments were gone
[2:10:30] and they were dancing up there to some
[2:10:32] rock and roll song don't say that music
[2:10:34] rock and roll
[2:10:36] i'm like the vision is coming to pass
[2:10:43] every church now has to have their
[2:10:46] contemporary service
[2:10:48] and their traditional services
[2:10:51] the people that are like the one and the
[2:10:53] people like the others
[2:11:07] that has heard a
[2:11:08] message and as many are forgetting this
[2:11:12] message as ages and ages go on years and
[2:11:14] years go on
[2:11:19] there is going to be a small remnant
[2:11:21] um
[2:11:37] and there has to be a bride that has not
[2:11:39] been disobedient to that heavenly vision
[2:11:45] amen if god has done anything in your
[2:11:47] age
[2:11:50] you got to
[2:12:02] and make sure you're living your life
[2:12:04] according to the vision
[2:12:08] amen
[2:12:15] the abstract has been searched back
[2:12:44] we've discovered every price has been
[2:12:46] paid
[2:12:58] to lay the foolish things of man behind
[2:13:29] spirit will do his spirit will do
[2:13:34] because we are the esther we are the
[2:13:35] ruth we are the rebels
[2:13:38] from the rebecca and we have come to be
[2:13:40] obedient
[2:13:56] i jesus have sent my angel to testify
[2:13:58] unto you these things in the churches
[2:14:10] i am the root the offspring of david and
[2:14:13] the bright morning star
[2:14:17] and the spirit and the bride are saying
[2:14:20] come on
[2:14:22] why because they've been united together
[2:14:31] amen as long as there's a joshua and a
[2:14:34] caleb in the bible
[2:14:38] the bride will become fulfill their type
[2:14:41] their dedication to the inheritance
[2:14:48] of the inheritance
[2:15:02] this world is getting more and more
[2:15:06] wicked it seems like every decade is a
[2:15:09] surprise that's
[2:15:12] so much more worse than the decade
[2:15:13] before
[2:15:17] and now we're marching into these 2020s
[2:15:33] and as the birth pains are getting
[2:15:34] closer and closer

[2:15:53] ever seen before

[2:16:02] hold
[2:16:05] what birth pains will become
[2:16:09] everybody that has laid their hopes in
[2:16:12] civilization
