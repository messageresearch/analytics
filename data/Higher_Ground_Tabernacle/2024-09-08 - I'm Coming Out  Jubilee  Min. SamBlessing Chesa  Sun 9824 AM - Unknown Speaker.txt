to everyone was able to make it amen amen the pastor is uh he'll be preaching in Iowa City this morning so let us remember them in prayer amen amen amen uh while we standing come some de let us open our Bibles to the Book of Leviticus in chapter 25 25 verse 8 the Bible reads and thou sh number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 49 years then sht thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month uh in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family in the year of this Jubilee you shall return turn every man unto his possession that's verse verse 13 let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before your throne of grace and mercy thanking you and appreciating you for the opportunity you've given us to come into your house father we know that any educated men can read from the Bible but it only takes you father to Quicken those words from the pages of the Bible to make them living realities in our lives this is our prayer and heart desire father this morning may you speak through the speaker and may you hear through the hearer oh god father there is someone who has a need there's someone who has an unspoken request but father you can see that all and your word says you supply all our [Music] needs according to your reaches and Glory father we ask you to come and have full preeminence we yield ourselves and say may you the great speaker minister to us this morning in your son Jesus Christ might name we pray believe and the church shall say amen amen we can all take our seats amen so the scriptures that we read the Bible is talking about the law that God gave to the children of Israel amen amen it says after every seven years after every seven sabbaths they shall be a special year so that will be after 49 years so every seventh year was a was a Sabbath year and after seven of those seven years in the 49th year which is getting into the 50th God says it shall be a Year of Jubilee amen amen and it says and then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make this trumpet to sound throughout all the land so the day of atonement was a day that was set aside and the high priest would get into the holy of holies and sprinkle Blood on the gold instruments in the inner Hol and that was an atonement for the whole children of Israel whatever sins they had committed the high priest was atoning for them whatever wrong they would have done the high priest was atoning for them and we know this was a type of Christ Our Savior who was the high priest who came at the end of it all to tie up each and everything that had happened in the in the Old Testament to be the final high priest amen amen so we see here that the Year of Jubilee or the trumpet of Jubilee was sounded on the day of atonement and at that's when everything was forgiven so the trumpet of Jubilee was sounded on the day of forgiv and in verse 13 we saw the Bible says in the Year of Jubilee you shall return every man his possession so we realized when the children of Israel left Egypt and they crossed off into their Promised Land Joshua portioned each and every one of them their possession their god-given rights this is your land this is your possession but during the course of the years over the course of time people got into Debs and they got themselves into trouble and they lost their land they lost their god-given [Music] possessions amen but God Made A Way Back am and some of those people because of the crimes they would have committed they would be made slaves them and their family to go and work to repay their debts but although they were under law God gave them Grace he said despite you losing your possession you going to work as a slave every Year of Jubilee when that trumpet sounds that trumpet means you can go free amen amen it doesn't matter how many years you've been toiling as a slave as soon as you hear that sound of Jubilee you can leave whatever you were doing and you can go free and whoever had your possession you can walk back onto your land and kick them off and says this is my god-given possession I don't care what happened for for me to lose but the title did say it's mine I'm taking it back hallelujah amen during the course of your Christian Life you might have lost your joy you might have lost your peace but I'm telling you this morning Christ the high priest sounded the trumpet of Jubilee it does not matter the devil had stolen your joy go back to the devil say give me back my joy give me back my peace give me back my inheritance because this is my god-given blessing inheritance amen amen it doesn't matter what you have lost simply because it's yours you have each and every God given right to go claim it and what gives you the right if you are a son of Abraham remember we Are Spiritual Israel so long you are saved you are a son of Abraham and each and every promise that God gave to Our Father Abraham applies to you and me amen amen so you have each and every right to go possess the gates of the enemy God gave Abraham a promise thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy so I'm telling you this morning you are Abraham seed so you can go and walk and possess the gates of the enemy that inheritance is yours we were born with amnesia when we came on this Earth You didn't know who you were we just thought you were born here to leave grow up and die we thank God for the that came to open our eyes and tell us where we came from that before the foundation of the world you were on the back part of God's mind you were in eternity so it does not matter what you go through you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you can say I know where I came from and I know where I'm going back to don't let Satan lie to you Satan had a beginning and he's going to have an end Satan was created but when he was created you were already there you can tell him when you were created I was already there so I'm senior than you are [Music] you cannot tell me nothing amen amen and we were born with a purpose remember in Jeremiah God told Jeremiah before you were formed in your mother's wom I knew thee so before he was conceived God already knew him where was he was on the back part of God's mind he was just waiting for that manifestation so because God already knew you he had a purpose for you when you are born you go back to God and say Lord what's my purpose because he's the one who knows it your purpose is to be a Son of God to be a daughter of God to reflect what your father is because remember we are attributes of God amen amen we thank God for the message of if it was not for Mali 4 we wouldn't have known that Christ came to set us free that we cannot be held back by our habits no more amen Amen in Jubilee I forgot to give my title my title is I'm coming out if I'm to give a subtitle to it is Jubilee just turn around to your neighbor and say I'm coming out now turn to your other neighbor and tell them I'm coming out amen amen the prophet of God says now today many hundred years have passed but the same God that sent the jubilees in them days the same God who sends Jubilee today all the people that had been captured and was in captivity they come an acceptable year [Music] and when the trumpet sounded then all the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay the price they could absolutely Go free they could drop their ho if they were hoing or whatever instrument they were working with set free and go whilst they were in the fields working as soon as they hear that trumpet throw it away I've heard my freedom I don't have to pay the price because Christ paid the ultimate price on that day of Calvary so whatever debt you owed whatever sin debt you ow he paid for it all you don't have to suffer no more you don't have to live under your privileges anymore because he came to set you free hallelujah hallelujah I believe those children of Israel they were waiting for that day night before the Year of Jubilee night before the day of atonement they wouldn't go to sleep on their mind they had the possession that their fathers had left them say it's been a long while since I've been to my land it's been a while since I've seen my property and I believe they wouldn't fall asleep and they would wait out for the Sun for the sun to rise up the Horizon as soon as the sun rose up this was it I'm no longer bound amen amen we go to the next slide please it says now if somehow or or if the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there come a year called The Jubilee Year and that was uh every seven years they had a rest or a Sabbath and in this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a Freeborn and a true blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free of char if he was a freeorn true blooded Israelites only if you are predestinated Son of God can you walk up and claim back everything he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance hallelujah hallelujah brother sister it does not matter who's holding your possession you say Satan you are holding my joy you are holding my peace but it's time for you to come back to me free I don't have to work for it you can say fear you have to go away I don't have to work for it anxiety you can go away you got to go you can say sin you have to go I don't got to pay for it because Jesus Christ already pay for it he paid the ultimate sacrifice amen amen every year once a year the high priest would go in the day of atonement atoning for the sins of the children of Israel so every sins you had committed from the beginning of the year until that time they were all wiped away actually in the Old Testament your sins were not wiped away they were just covered up by the blood of Bo and it was just for them to feel like they had been forgiven but they were actually not forgiven those sins were still there because the life of an animal is lower than the life of a man a man cannot the life of an animal cannot save a man so it was just to appease their conscience each and every year but this was a type of Christ amen amen God says time is come to an end for this Shadow and the reality had to come into huj God poured himself into the body of Jesus Christ it had to to take someone higher than men to save you and me only the life of a per of only a higher life can atone for your sins that's why Jesus when he came he died and he gave up his life and when he shed that blood he was the ultimate SA he was a spotless sinless Lamb of God that came to wipe away all of your sins this time around he was just not covering them up he was wiping them clean he says you are Justified as if you have not done it there is no evidence or I I heard someone say Jesus is the most corrupt lawyer lawyer they say because he gets rid of all the evidence when Satan comes to say he did that there is no evidence because you've never ever done it in the first place amen that's what he done for us so he was the high priest that was touched by the failing of our infirmity whatever you are going through he says I know there is nothing that he doesn't know so when you kneel down and go to God In Prayer know exactly what you were going he knows exactly what you were feeling it wouldn't be fair for him to be God him above us and not know what you were going through he cannot be touched by your feelings because he has no idea how it is to suffer then he decided to come down to become a man so he could feel each and everything that human can ever feel he he got sick he got hungry amen amen he felt rejected all the feelings you can ever go through he went through each and all of them Hallelujah huj but he overcame them amen amen Jesus was a 100% man and a 100% God he was not 5050 so he was me enough to go through all that you he went through God enough to overcome each and every one of us hallelujah so when you kneel down to pray you say Lord I know you know how it feels be where I'm at right now if it where you how would you feel sick please deliver me he knows what you are going through so he will come down because he said If my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he said I will hear from Heaven hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad I don't serve it dumb and deaf God the Bible says all other gods The Works of men Wen God does not speak back to you so glad our Mighty Savior Jesus Christ when we pray before I kneel down to pray he has already answered before I get up from there I know he is my God and he hears me and when he hears he acts on it many times we think that a no is not an answer we're only waiting for a yes but no is an answer too and he knows what's best for you you say Lord I want this but he's like nah if I give him or her that thing he's going to stop serving me it's only years later when you turn around you going to look and say oh I thank God he didn't give me that because if he gave me that I probably wouldn't be here so you got to thank God for the doors he opened thank God for the doors he has opened thank him for the doors he's closed too amen amen you can look back and say if I had married that other person I would be having Joy right now say thank you Lord because you know what's best for me amen amen go to Luke chapter 4 verse 17 Luke you can follow along it says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised Hallelujah they say he walked up into the synagogue and the priest handed him the scroll he skipped all the other scriptures and he went to the one that was talking about him amen am when he started reading this he was reading his mission he was giving his mission statement many companies they have what they call a mission statement uh uh statement which is a summary DEC which is a summary of all that they do and they put it in one line as a mission statement and when you read that you know what the company is there for what they do when Jesus Christ was given the scripture he was letting them know what his mission was onto the Earth for to heal the brokenhearted Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised but uh ver 19 vers 18 to set at Liberty to them that are bruised uh put uh um uh thank you verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasten on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah he says everything that I was reading it is about to happen this day this scripture is fulfilled and we' seen the previous one he says his mission was to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and we see what the prophet of God says here it says now Jesus was prophesied by Isaiah to preach the acceptable year and says that's what we want to deal on tonight now the acceptable year was this that during in the time between so many years the acceptable year is the year called in the old writings the Year of Jubilee so when Christ here in verse 19 he was preaching says I have been sent to preach to you the Year of Jubilee hallelujah hallelujah all the jubilees that they had had in the past he says I'm coming to preach the final one and once he preaches the final Jubilee everything is done with amen amen so when he was on that cross and he was saying it is finished he was sounding the Jubilee for you and me before he went he was in the garden of gsan and he was thinking about the cross he was about to bear and he said Lord if it was my will I would not but nevertheless let your will be done he accepted that burden of the Cross do you know why he accepted it because he saw you he saw me he saw that you needed salvation he show that you needed healing and he says if I don't go what's going to happen to you if I don't go what's going to happen to your sins I don't go what's going to happen to the chains that are binding you and he says the father nevertheless let your will be done and he bore that cross for you he was stripped for your healing he had that chastisement for you he died for your sins and your iniquities he became your sin so you can become his righteousness hallelujah amen for the first time God left him that's why I said father why thou forsaken me because God Is So holy and so righteous he cannot carry sin so for Jesus to carry your sin God had to leave him it says father why has Thou forsaken me so Jesus knows how it feels to be rejected you are feeling rejected said Lord you know how it feels please come to my rescue and he went to that cross as a man not as God he carried your sin as a man and he carried for each and every one of us so you don't have to bear that cross no more because he carried it for you you don't have to be sick no more because he was sick for you you don't have to die no more cuz he died for you amen amen and when he was on that cross Heaven rejected him God left him and the Earth that he had come to die for the Earth rejected him so Heaven rejected him and Earth rejected him and he was hanging Between Heaven and Earth amen amen and while he was on that cross Brother s he had you on his mind he had me on his mind hallelujah hallelujah so nothing can stand before you there no condemnation that can take you down Christ had me on his mind and when he was hanging on the he cried it is finished that was the Jubilee trumpet he sounded that Jubilee and say your trials are finished sins are finished your sickness is finished why because he was the high priest that last Jubilee trumpet so brother sister it doesn't matter how long you been bound I got to go you got to tell your cap I'm coming out it doesn't matter how long I've been in bondage I'm coming out it doesn't matter how long that habit was holding me look the devil in the face and say My Savior cried it is finished now I'm coming out no chains can hold me back no sin can hold me back because the high priest sounded that trumpet of Hallelujah Hallelujah and when Christ speaks everything has to happen he says all power in Earth all power that is in heaven was given to me hallelujah hallelujah amen amen he came as a high priest sound the trumpet of Jubilee when he was walking on the shores of Galilee demons were trembling saying what kind of a man is this those seven demons that were in Mary Magdalene they wondering what is going on what kind of a man is this oh but they didn't know he was on a man he was a man on a mission set the captives free break all the chains and set the people free he walked up to Legion who had a thousand demons and those demons as soon as they saw him it says why have you come to torment us recognized that Jesus was God walking on two feet that was God that poured himself into a man and as as soon as they saw Jesus coming they had a prayer request please let us leave him give us permission so we can go into those thank you and Jesus being God he granted this demon prayer request I got a question for you this morning if God can give a demon's prayer request what about you bought by his blood the one he died for amen amen if God can give a demon here a request what about you he will give it to you you are his son you are his daughter when you kneel down to pray he will listen to you you are higher than angels angels are servants are protecting you so you are worth much more to God than an angel so when you go go to God In Prayer the Bible says PA say now we approach the throne of God when you approach God you approach him with confidence knowing that he is your father he will grant your heart's desires he say if you shall ask anything in my name I will give it to you so this morning I'm here to tell you whatever desire you have take it to God In Prayer he will give it to you because he is a God that keeps his word hallelujah hallelujah if he gave those Legion of demons that their heart desire I know he's going to do it for me because he came to die for me he came to save me the Bible says by his St I was not I'm going to be healed but I was healed all I have to do Isa take it and say Lord the healing you gave me 2,000 years ago walking into it the Forgiveness you gave me 2,000 years ago I'm walking into it I'm taking it because it's mine those chains that are binding me right I get loose because you broke them 2,000 years ago hallelujah hallelujah after they took him off the cross they took him to the tomb it was a borrowed tomb they didn't know what was going on asked myself why would they borrow a tomb because it was someone else's tomb the person who owned it they were planning that when they die they would go in there but not KN what they were doing bored a tomb for Jesus borrowing means you are taking so you take it back when you bury someone in the tomb you seal it up we know Graves and tombs only work once once it's sealed you don't even go back there but these people not knowing what they were doing they were not even believing it they went to Joseph of AR and they borrowed the to saying we are putting Jesus in there they didn't know that that was a prophecy in itself a tomb for a man because he was not going to stay in there tomb was going to go back to his original they put him in that tomb they sealed it up I don't care how much seal they put in there because it was a prophecy he had to come out all the Old Testament was talking about the resurrection of chist it says I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that word had enough power open that tomb and resurrect Christ out of it hallelujah hallelujah so the word of God has enough power take whatever situation you are in the word of God is a word of Prophecy prophecy never fails propy never lies when they put him in that borrow Tom he knew he was coming out said you are going to destroy this Temple rebuild it in three days hallelujah they put him in a borrow tomb they sealed up and they put a soldier to guard it they say yeah this man's been talking about resurrecting so many times so we know his disciples are going to come and and seal it and steal his body and claim that he resurrected and they put a soldier there brother sister there is no soldier that can stop the Prophecies of God Hallelujah no man that can stop the Prophecies of God once it is speak spoken it has to happen Isaiah said when the prophecy when the word of God Is Spoken it does not go back to him void but it only goes back to him after he has accomplished spoken it for so the prophecy said Jesus Christ had to resurrect and they put him in that tomb but whilst his body laid there to rest he had a mission to accomplish hallelujah hallelujah that mission was for you and me when he said it is finished he was talking about the job here on Earth make one more stop amen amen because remember Satan had the keys hell and the grave Jesus had to make a stop he says the job on Earth is done but I got one more place to be and he says the prophet God says I can hear him Jesus went to hell he was not sent to hell he went himself he had a mission to be accomplished and he went there and he opened the door says I can hear him say Satan come here he is the boss now he reaches over that that key of death and Hell of his side H it on his own Hallelujah he opened those doors of Hell went over to Satan grabbed those keys of death hell and the grave and he took them back he was original he says I want to serve notice to you I want to serve notice to you you've been a bluff long enough this is Jesus speaking to Satan I'm I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross and the full debt is paid brother sister your debt is paid he paid it on the cross of Calvary he says you have no right no you are stripped Jesus stri Satan of all his stripped him of all his rights he stripped him of the keys of death hell and the grave he says give me those keys he turned around and he gives him a good healthy kick and slams the door together and say stay in there the boss from now on Hallelujah went and he overcame Satan for you and me and he say Satan you are nothing but a bluff so whatever you are saying is a lie Satan has no ability to tell the truth whatever he says the opposite is true and he has no more power because Jesus stripped him off he took those keys of death and Hell Satan cannot kill you Satan cannot send you to hell because he does not have that power no does not have that Authority no in the hands of God hallelujah hallelujah brother sister don't live under your privileges Satan was sted and after he took those Keys the prophet God says he slams the door together stay right there I'm BOS from now on after he was done with hell before three days were up after two nights into the third day he came back to his body on Sunday early morning there was an earthquake hallelujah hallelujah they could not hold Jesus no more the Earth could not hold Jesus no hallelujah hallelujah cuz he had overcome Satan he overcome death you over hell and the grave you overcame your sin you overcame your trial overcame your habits the Earth could not hold him no more there was an earthquake because he had to resurrect and he rose on that s rose up Victorious you and me could have Victory Satan for you and me hallelujah hallelujah so you can go to Satan and you say you are my father my savior overcame you hallelujah hallelujah he says I'm the boss from now on and that Sunday morning the soldier who was on the tomb he heard an earthquake he says I can't stand this no more and he ran away and he say I don't know what's going on in there something is happening and that seal that was sealing that grave broke off and he rose Victorious for you and me to be victorious hallelujah hallelujah so whatever is holding you go to the devil and say you can't hold me back no more why I'm coming out because the high priest sounded the Jubilee year has sounded that Jubilee trumpet amen the prophet of God says as soon as you hear the word of God that says you can't be set free believe it Rejoice with it will show the evidence you have accepted it hallelujah hallelujah says but first accept it I like that part God will show you the evidence after you have accepted it so accept your freedom first believe by faith is already done and evidence will follow later if you are not feeling well you say I am healed even if the symptoms are still there the evidence will follow later hallelujah hallelujah if you are trying to overcome and you are still fighting that Spirit am an overcomer the evidence will follow later you accept it accept hallelujah hallelujah if you are trying to buy a house and you don't have enough money for it you accepted and you say I already have that house evidence of that house follow later if you are in debt you say Lord I accept it accept you paid my debt you my debt it's not only the sin debt even the money debt too so he paid for it thank you for paying my debt myb I accept it AC and the evidence will follow later after you have accepted it look at Mary Mary was told something that was impossible Gabriel told her you're going to have a baby without knowing any man she said how can it be never been had off that's never happened before but because she knew it was an angel from God she accepted it she said so be it according to your word that was her accepting it the conception happened and the baby followed later the baby followed later after she accepted it same thing happened with our faith the Father Abraham it took 25 years for the evidence to follow but he had already accepted it it doesn't matter how long it will take for that promise to come into so long I've accepted it so long God spoke it I know the evidence is following he say you first you accept it he says I believe it I accept it accept I start rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah God works righteousness I believe he was stripped from my healing I accepted God works healing for me just as soon as I believe he can't help me till I believe I've got to believe and confess it first and when you believe it and you confess it then God is under all obligation to his word when you believe what he says God has no choice than to do what his word says amen amen remember he's not a man that he should lie neither is he a son of man that he should repent he says I've got to believe and confess it first God is under obligation to his word he will

serve him and we are going to the fiery furnace anyways they didn't have an assurance of a voice that they heard but they had the Blessed assurance that were standing on the word of God and those men started pushing them and walking them toward the I don't know how they did it but they made it hot seven times and they opened that fiery furnace and they pushed them in I don't know how it happened

relying on something that happened way back Yonder and it gets wiggle tails in it gets worms in it and it gets stale it says what about today this is the day why do you want to be satisfied by experiences that happened 15 years ago your experiences are old it does not invalidate what God did is true God did it but what is a historical God going to do for me I need a God that can work for me I need a God who can work for me hallelujah hallelujah oh my French is getting better Hallelujah I don't want to leave on those past experiences says today is the day tell Satan today is the day I might have gotten my last victory two years ago but I'm not satisfied with what happened what happened two years ago evidence can do it again he did it before he can do it today Hallelujah so I'm not settling for past experiences want those experiences Stepping Stones to be a bridge into a new experience into a new victory amen amen hallelujah hallelujah I want that peace oh I hear someone says peace that makes no sense because it's peace that passes all understanding so when it passes understanding it doesn't make no sense I want that that makes no sense doesn't matter whatever battles I'm going through because my savior blow that Jubilee trumpet back I'm getting my peace back hallelujah hallelujah it says now that's the good news that's the gospel the gospel is Christ died in the Sinn [Music] place and Christ taken that Sinners that sick man's Place Christ taken the worried man's Place Christ take the maniac's place Christ took every place morning Christ took your place you can take his place he became your sin so you can become his right he became Victorious so you can be Victorious and he freed us from every Affliction and every sin that the devil putting us in prison Christ come to Pardon us freely everything goes free there's this story of a Johnny crawl story about Johnny Crow Johny Crow it was this um crow that was tied up and it kept on going in circles because it was bound and for so long it couldn't go nowhere cuz it was tied down to this PA and Johnny Crow had no Freedom at all joh but then one day a good man came and he cut that card that was tying Johnny C to that poow but Johnny Crow kept on hoping around johow he still thought that he was still chained but he didn't realize that the good man had already come and set him free hallelujah

holding me back poverty cannot hold me back fear cannot hold me back because he has Set Me Free Satan is just only by a bluff he's a liar amen amen he is a liar whatever Satan says that's a lie he might tell you you are not a son of God you tell him I am a Son of God Amen and he can come through to through people too and they tell you what you are not amen amen but you say I'm not that I Am What God Says I Am remember the thief on the cross people knew him as a thief his whole life he was a thief he never ever went to church but when God saw him he says this is my son Hallelujah so I don't care what people may call you I'm only calling myself what God says about me people might call you what they what you did to them remember when um Benjamin was born his mother called him benon Ben means son of pain the mother said you caused me a lot of pain I'm calling you benon but then when the father came Jacob came and he says no he is not a son of pain his name is not benoni his name is Benjamin so he changed his name from son of pain to the son of my right hand right hand means son of authority so people might call you what you have made them go through but that doesn't matter I don't care what you I don't care what you call me what you say about me what matters is what God says about me Hallelujah Mary Magdalene was called a prostitute magdal but when Jesus saw her he saw he saw his daughter amen am she heard that Jubilee trumpet sound and she said I'm not a prostitute I'm a daughter of God and she came to that realization and she stepped out when God does that for you you got to step out of it amen amen and the Bible says if the son has made you free he shall make you free indeed not partially free but fully free amen hallelujah hallelujah Christ came to set the captiv free you don't have to be bound by habits not a Halfway Christian Life God doesn't want you to be that way he wants you to be free God anointed Christ to preach Freedom open the prison do amen so when God sets you free here Paul says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free and not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage don't be entangled with the Yoke of bondage don't be bound back again when Jesus sets you free he that the son has set free is free indeed amen amen how many are thankful this morning for that trumpet of Jubilee to show you that you are not bound that the POS that you lost you can walk back to where the chain that used to bind you are not binding you no more I thank God for the message of the hour that came to blow that Jubilee in this last day to set us free from denominational spirit and he put us to be called the bride of Christ amen here the prophet says he says now I'm just your brother by grace of God when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes a voice of God to you he says maybe I offended you by saying that forgive me but felt that might have been resented a little bit he says but I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration I felt bad about it the first [Music] time repeated it says now I can say nothing in myself you show me I say you believe it and Watch What Happens hallelujah hallelujah he says I am God's voice to you the prophet wasn't giving us his own thoughts but he was giving us what God gave him he was just a mouthpiece say I am God's voice to you if I take this mic away from Brother Isaac you can't hear him but you were hearing the microphone right but the microphone wasn't speaking the microphone we can turn it on and leave it here for for two years put it here and turn up all the volumes you will hear nothing from this microphone the microphone doesn't have a voice of its own it only says what the person has spoken into it it's just a mouthpiece when the prophet God says I'm just a mouthpiece he doesn't speak his own thoughts speaking what God says that's why he says I'm God's voice you see the quote we read he tried to to not say it but just the inspiration just came back stronger amen amen so we know the message of the hour that we believe did not come by a man it came from Heaven this message that we believe did not come from Jeffersonville Jefferson it came from the Throne of almighty God hallelujah hallelujah that's why this message it has enough power to transform you look at yourself where would you be without this [Music] message you wouldn't be here you have no idea where you would be thank God for the message of the hour that came to blow the Jubilee trumpet amen amen it is not the message of William BR it's the message of Jesus Christ that has come to show you that you are a son of God to show you that you have been set free you don't have to be held back by the denominational dogas he who the son has set free he is free indeed there's this one sister who came to brother Bram and she had a dream and the dream goes like this and she said brother Bram there's um they were in a cage and a couple of Believers and they were trying to come out of this cage but they could not and brother Bram came on the scene and she said brother Bram Deliver Us from this he said this is a house of hell and say you've been misunderstood and you misunderstood these people said these are fine people and I looked over there and like a great big seller or big walls down beneath a great big cave and great iron bars eight or 10 in thick and people out of their mind Twisted arms and legs beating their head like that and she was crying saying deliver the people brother Bram help us we are in trouble so the sister was in a dream this particular setting there were people that had um Twisted arms and legs and everyone was in prison they couldn't go free and this sister saw brother Bram and say brother deliver these people help us we are in trouble amen amen and I looked around and I said I wish I could and go on looking around and uh my little bitty body and them great big iron bars and those poor people in there and you couldn't get to them them iron bars were sitting so close together and I looked they were beating their head like they were out of their mind the prophet himself he looked at himself he said in my own capacity I cannot free these people and these people were in prison they wanted to be saved they wanted to be delivered and he says I seen some lights flickering around in there and I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with a light of rainbow around him and he was looking right straight to me and said deliver those people and he went away the man himself he could not deliver the people but then because he was a mouthpiece of God God gave him a message he gave him an assignment go deliver these people and I thought how could I deliver them I Haven got strength enough in my arms to break those bars he didn't have strength in his body to do it amen so I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and popping rolling and bar started falling down and people started running and screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voices and were all delivered why because the man came with a message from God house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so brother sister this message came to Deliver Us and Revelation says that the bride has a Ministry what that Ministry to prophesy again prophesying again is say prophesy something that's already been prophesied a ministry here when you are bound you can stand there and say House of hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and those bars have to fall and you have to be delivered you can say sickness give way to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and it has to give way you can say trial give way to the name of Jesus Christ and it has to give way why because that's the message from the a message from Jesus Christ that blow Jubilee hallelujah hallelujah you got to turn around to the devil and say devil I'm coming
