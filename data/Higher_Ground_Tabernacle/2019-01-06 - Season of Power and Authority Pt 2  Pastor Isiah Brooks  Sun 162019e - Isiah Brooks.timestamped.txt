[28:27] 3rd chapter we began reading at the 11th
[28:29] first surely God is embedded to us then
[28:44] we've been to ourselves amen some reason
[28:54] I've got the wrong place first for some
[28:58] reason I'm skipping Peter yeah seeing
[29:05] then beginning at the 11 first that all
[29:08] these things shall be dissolved what
[29:11] manner person ar e to be in all holy
[29:14] conversation and godliness looking for
[29:19] and hasting unto the coming of the day
[29:22] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[29:25] shall be dissolved and the elements
[29:28] shall melt with fervent heat
[29:30] nevertheless we according to his promise
[29:36] look for a new heaven and a new earth
[29:39] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[29:42] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[29:44] for such things be diligent that ye may
[29:48] be found of him in peace and without
[29:51] spot and blameless an account that the
[29:55] long-suffering of our Lord is salvation
[29:57] even as our brother Paul also according
[30:00] to the wisdom given unto him have
[30:04] written on to you hallelujah
[30:10] that's just start there by God's grace
[30:15] father God we thank you we thank you for
[30:19] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[30:22] for being so good to us
[30:24] you have been better to us than we have
[30:27] been to ourselves we pray Lord God this
[30:30] evening that you break and destroy the
[30:32] yokes of the enemy bless those who have
[30:35] come out Lord is just a few of
[30:37] tonight but God we all have one thing in
[30:40] common and that is we come to see you
[30:42] let your perfect will be done here
[30:45] tonight Lord feed your people give us
[30:49] grace to move completely out of your way
[30:52] and we'll be careful to give you the
[30:54] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[30:57] name we pray amen
[31:00] you may be seated we're not going to be
[31:03] long tonight but as we started this
[31:06] morning on that message Amen season of
[31:09] power and authority and I believe that
[31:12] with all of my heart
[31:14] of course we realized by God's grace it
[31:16] is not by power nor by might but by
[31:19] God's Spirit it's not him who will it
[31:23] nor he that run it but God that shows
[31:26] mercy and one of the things that we must
[31:29] come to know is that we must come to see
[31:33] who we really are in the story by God's
[31:37] grace we told this morning when it came
[31:39] to Sampson at some point in time I
[31:42] believe Sampson lost his identity and in
[31:46] that process in which he lost his
[31:48] identity he began to flirt around with
[31:51] the world and he was caught by Delilah
[31:54] Delilah is was a something that no doubt
[31:59] look appealing to the eye
[32:00] and of course you know Satan hides and
[32:03] beauty amen and surely enough
[32:07] Delilah seduced Samson in telling in in
[32:13] him telling her all of his secrets and
[32:17] as we said we you may not look at it as
[32:20] being a secret of God but it's by this
[32:23] message we understand the divine nature
[32:26] of God no other Church preaches it no
[32:30] else
[32:30] nowhere else outside of this message and
[32:33] this was a message given to us through
[32:36] our prophet that we may be partakers of
[32:39] God's divine nature it is our secret the
[32:43] world doesn't know anything about it
[32:45] they think if you jump in you shout you
[32:47] got it they think if you speak in
[32:49] tongues you got it
[32:50] the
[32:50] if you run up and down now you got it
[32:53] they think that if you do these things
[32:56] amen you have the Holy Spirit but God by
[33:00] God's grace has given us amen
[33:03] our entrance our understanding amen of
[33:06] what God requires of us is that Alright
[33:11] now we spoke this morning that we talked
[33:14] about identity an identity is very
[33:17] important right now because a lot of
[33:19] people want to identify themselves with
[33:21] a message Church God amen is not
[33:25] identified with a group of people not in
[33:29] this day God is identified with
[33:32] individuals is that Alright
[33:34] even because our identity is important
[33:37] our dinner identity is not Methodist it
[33:41] is not Baptist it is not Presbyterian it
[33:44] is not Pentecostal it is not message
[33:47] Howard entity is Christ identification
[33:52] is very important as I said it is being
[33:56] the same as one described in other words
[33:59] amen
[34:00] my description of you must fit in words
[34:07] what I see with my eyes or perceive with
[34:12] my intellect it cannot go beyond that
[34:17] for an example if you are a horse and I
[34:21] described a dog well the dog description
[34:25] will not fit him in the horse
[34:29] description because if they both have
[34:32] four legs they both have two eyes
[34:34] they have loves but there are
[34:36] differences in so much so that however I
[34:40] describe whatever I describe your eyes
[34:43] and your intellect will be able to
[34:46] determine which is the horse and which
[34:48] is the dog amen and that's what this
[34:51] Christian that's why to identification
[34:54] and description is so important the word
[34:58] described things amen the Word of God
[35:01] describe Amen Malik
[35:04] for that he would turn the hearts of the
[35:06] children to the father's and the
[35:08] father's to the children and he the
[35:11] Bible tells us Amen that he will come in
[35:14] a day when when the earth will be
[35:17] destroyed by fire he has finished his
[35:20] ministry is that right Amen so we know
[35:22] by God's description of Malachi 4 and
[35:26] revelation 10 7 that William Brennan fit
[35:29] that description and his identification
[35:32] was Christ he was to come in amen and
[35:38] and introduced this wicked generation
[35:41] again to Christ because remember in
[35:45] Revelations to third chapter Amen we
[35:48] find that Laodicea had put Jesus out of
[35:51] the church so the church world didn't
[35:54] know Christ he wasn't in there he they
[35:58] saw a system they saw something that man
[36:00] had put together and called it Christ
[36:03] but it wasn't Christ they what they had
[36:06] excuse me but by way of the internet
[36:10] what they had they had what they call
[36:12] Baptists they had what they called
[36:15] Methodists they had what they call
[36:17] Pentecostal and in our day we've got
[36:20] what we call message but understand
[36:23] message doesn't necessarily describes
[36:26] Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is a
[36:30] spirit he is God there's that right how
[36:35] do you know you have the accurate
[36:37] description in you of Jesus Christ
[36:41] Hebrews says and then according to
[36:44] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same
[36:48] yesterday today and forever see that's
[36:52] how that was God's description even when
[36:55] it came to the Prophet he didn't have
[36:57] his own thing he used the scripture to
[36:59] describe who he was and what was living
[37:03] on the inside of him right and he goes
[37:06] on to say that Jesus Christ would do the
[37:08] same thing he did yesterday today he's a
[37:13] God that changes not if he healed
[37:16] yesterday
[37:17] he-here someday if he delivered
[37:19] yesterday he delivers today amen
[37:23] so we realized by God's grace Amen your
[37:28] identification in your description must
[37:32] be compatible it must work together is
[37:41] that right
[37:42] if I had a dog that meow
[37:45] that was something would be wrong with
[37:47] that because dog barks in cat meow right
[37:51] so you and I understand if we say we are
[37:55] the bride of Jesus Christ and we're
[37:58] giving forth a different sound then the
[38:02] word is sounding remember right
[38:06] uncertain sound and we give us different
[38:08] sound then the word is sounding then it
[38:12] shows that something is wrong with the
[38:15] description and the identification
[38:17] cannot be matched up is that right you
[38:22] heard me use this illustration before
[38:24] even in our younger days in elementary
[38:28] we taught we were taught what was the
[38:30] same and you would always have these
[38:33] little cars two would be blue and one
[38:36] would be red but they would have the
[38:38] same everything except for the color and
[38:40] you had to draw a line to the one that
[38:46] was the same like if this is on the left
[38:49] side it would be Allah if it was blue
[38:51] and then you had a red and a yellow and
[38:55] another blue you had to draw the lines
[38:57] to the cars that was exactly the same
[39:00] that's important amen because it had the
[39:04] same color the same descriptions
[39:06] everything about it had to be saying it
[39:09] couldn't it is not the same if one is
[39:12] ran in one is blue it is not the same is
[39:15] what if one is yellow and one is red it
[39:18] has to be the same in every aspect
[39:22] so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ
[39:25] hallelujah and God knew that the only
[39:29] way that he could bring it
[39:31] and produce this is that he had to put
[39:34] the very same life in the bride of Jesus
[39:37] Christ it was also in the bride I'm
[39:40] excuse me you see them SEP there's also
[39:42] in Jesus Christ he could not make the
[39:45] same thing by putting a different kind
[39:47] of life in it right so his life was
[39:51] supernatural that's why the Bible says
[39:53] Amen if that same spirit that was in
[39:57] Christ Jesus if it be in you as it
[40:01] quicken his body it will also quicken
[40:04] your mortal body meaning it meant that
[40:07] the same life will produce the same life
[40:10] if it's in you right hallelujah so
[40:15] descriptions is very important because
[40:19] it would tell or depict what's what's
[40:23] been spoken or what's been written of
[40:27] the particular thing that you're trying
[40:29] to convey or make people see for an
[40:34] example little red little haha barista
[40:40] said red robbing hood right remember a
[40:44] little girl the little girl Red Robin
[40:46] Hood the little Riding Hood Red Riding
[40:50] Hood I thought her name was Robin okay
[40:54] [Laughter]
[40:56] amen
[40:58] so we must realize by God's grace her
[41:01] hood was red it wasn't blue
[41:05] it wasn't yellow it wasn't green Robin
[41:08] had on a red hood so you must realize by
[41:14] God's grace Amen so it described her and
[41:19] you know we had a picture of her even to
[41:21] this day I can see this little girl with
[41:24] the red hood on her head a man and she
[41:28] um you know the whole story but it
[41:31] described her right so you say one of
[41:36] the things of poetry when it comes to
[41:38] writing compositions or whatever the
[41:40] case may be you you always had to be
[41:42] what they call these
[41:44] Krypton and your words had to flow to
[41:47] connect with something to produce a
[41:49] picture right so that's how the Bible is
[41:52] the Bible is that way it leads flows and
[41:55] it produces a picture is that right now
[41:58] you must understand that and you've
[42:00] heard me say this before in Isaiah
[42:02] pinkies up when the Bible says Amen that
[42:07] he he treads the winepress alone
[42:10] right and I said gave that description
[42:13] of this lamb this person that would come
[42:17] and be crucified about said we looked
[42:19] upon him as though it was ourselves we
[42:22] we despised him you know and and and so
[42:26] in that description it produces Christ
[42:29] in other words if Christ had never
[42:33] suffered Calvary he would not have been
[42:37] the right one you understand me
[42:41] they wanted to kill him by throwing him
[42:44] over a cliff right and he passed through
[42:48] the crowd is that right they wanted he
[42:51] all Satan wanted him to die by jumping
[42:54] off the pinnacle but you see if he had
[42:58] done so he will have not been the Jesus
[43:02] Christ
[43:03] that was written in the prophecies
[43:06] hallelujah
[43:07] he a man had to be a lamb acquainted
[43:12] with grief you see them saying he had to
[43:15] be one that God was building and working
[43:18] and meant to literally be able to be
[43:21] touched by the feelings of our
[43:23] infirmities he couldn't take a shortcut
[43:26] he had to go to Calvary he had to suffer
[43:30] in order to be the Lamb of God is that
[43:33] right oh I think it was brother Keith
[43:37] and I were just talking the other day
[43:38] about how that when Abraham took Isaac
[43:42] up on the mountain I don't know that
[43:45] meant that little boy who however old he
[43:47] was he loved his dad and he trusted his
[43:49] daddy and you know he had to be faithful
[43:52] he meant to God to realize him and his
[43:55] dad was
[43:55] ready to kill him I don't know nobody I
[43:59] [Laughter]
[44:01] don't know anyone that I know of a men
[44:05] that will lay down a daddy or no daddy
[44:08] he had to be under conviction and
[44:11] anointed by God to live there with his
[44:16] daddy having his arm drawn back with the
[44:20] knife but what God was doing he was
[44:23] literally painting a picture of the
[44:28] Christ that was to come
[44:29] you see I'm saying now you I'm getting
[44:33] to something because every shadow in
[44:36] this Bible must depict you every shadow
[44:42] in the Bible must speak of you in a
[44:49] reality form in a shadow form we are the
[44:51] reality of the shadow like Jesus was a
[44:55] reality of the shadow right we are the
[44:59] reality of the shadow so in other words
[45:03] our identification is found in the
[45:07] scripture by way of the shadows there we
[45:13] ought to know how to perform and then we
[45:16] ought to know how to live because
[45:19] however they lived here in the Old
[45:22] Testament was a shadow of what we
[45:25] supposed to live and be in the New
[45:27] Testament is that right identity is
[45:32] important if you cannot identify with
[45:35] Rahab something's wrong
[45:37] you'll never get the victory hallelujah
[45:41] you must see yourself as a ill-fame
[45:44] woman trapped behind walls hallelujah
[45:50] and you need the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:52] to escape hallelujah
[45:57] if you cannot see yourself as a Ruth who
[46:02] was a adulterer hallelujah yes she was a
[46:07] priestess in her
[46:09] listen poor to God Hitman's she was in
[46:12] fame she was an outcast from the economy
[46:15] of God God told Israel not to have
[46:18] anything to do with Ruth
[46:19] no more Vitus hallelujah but the grace
[46:24] of God found her hallelujah seek out a
[46:27] whole yo hear what I'm saying it wasn't
[46:30] something that just happened everything
[46:33] was planned by God y'all heard me this
[46:36] morning it's for his own pleasure
[46:41] God knew which one was going to stay and
[46:44] God knew which one was going to leave
[46:47] hallelujah
[46:48] and that's why I try to tell people we
[46:51] have a type in the shadows here is Oprah
[46:54] on one in and God on the other Ruth on
[46:57] the other is that right we see Oprah out
[47:00] there making millions and billions y'all
[47:03] hear what I'm saying but yet God has
[47:06] what we call a Ruth on the scene your
[47:10] God would be is that right that's what
[47:12] we tell them the Israel today Israel
[47:15] your God is my god
[47:16] your people is my people wherever you
[47:19] lay I'll a hallelujah we have the same
[47:23] promise is that right and we're going to
[47:27] marry boy ass because Boyz II Men is
[47:31] redeeming Israel and a Gentile at the
[47:35] same time see what I'm saying but we
[47:39] were sold out to the old fashioned way
[47:43] they'll forgive me for that watch we
[47:46] were sold out to the old fashioned way
[47:49] our identity is in this word and we
[47:56] don't want to deviate from it we love
[47:59] the fact that God sent us a prophet
[48:01] because we understand what a prophet is
[48:04] he is the revealer of God's Word or the
[48:09] instrument in which God uses to reveal
[48:12] the word and what he's doing you say
[48:16] what God always used prophets he told
[48:20] Noah go bill or knock at the
[48:22] same time you tell the world is going to
[48:25] rain right if they had all only listened
[48:28] to Noah they would have escaped the
[48:30] horrible thing now right now scientists
[48:32] are still trying to figure how high the
[48:34] Arctic's became frozen so quickly and we
[48:38] know the answer we know the answer in
[48:40] the days of Noah a man then explosion
[48:44] took it and threw it outside out of his
[48:48] orbit and it tilted hallelujah and even
[48:53] to this day is staggering like a
[48:55] drunkard huh
[48:57] see we know the answer they say millions
[49:00] of years ago and tens of thousands of
[49:02] years ago it's just been over a little
[49:04] over 6,000 hallelujah but scientists is
[49:09] where it was where men go wrong they
[49:12] trust more in science than they do the
[49:15] Word of God let me hurry up with this
[49:17] okay now it's important I keep drifting
[49:20] a little bit but God knows where I'm
[49:22] going with this
[49:23] the property God says in God's hiding
[49:26] himself in simplicity he there's a
[49:28] church is Christ's body it's an
[49:32] individual among other individuals that
[49:35] is born in the kingdom of God get come
[49:39] from the inside out it's automatically
[49:43] lived in other words I don't have to beg
[49:48] you to live right I don't have to force
[49:51] you to live right I don't have to
[49:55] threaten you to live right if you're
[49:58] born into the kingdom of God you
[50:02] understand me
[50:03] like I was sharing with the church their
[50:05] two kingdoms
[50:06] there's the Kingdom of Heaven and the
[50:08] kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is
[50:10] different from the kingdom of heaven
[50:12] there'll be some saved out of the
[50:14] kingdom of heaven but all is saved in
[50:17] the kingdom of God right because the
[50:21] kingdom of God is within you is the Holy
[50:24] Ghost it's his joy peace and
[50:26] righteousness in the Holy Ghost right
[50:29] but the kingdom of heaven is people from
[50:32] distant nomination that denomination who
[50:34] basically large in this great
[50:36] tree right everybody out there is
[50:40] feeling the blessings of Calvary we're
[50:44] living by the blessings of Calvary the
[50:46] sinners are living by the blessings of
[50:49] Calvary everything is living by the
[50:52] blessings of Calvary but everybody won't
[50:55] receive the blessings of Calvary
[50:57] hallelujah is that Alright that comes
[51:00] from the inside out it's automatically
[51:03] lived you don't ask a sheep to bear wool
[51:06] or manufacture wall I mean the sheep
[51:09] don't have to manufacture wool they say
[51:13] now my master want me to have some world
[51:15] this year I've got to get busy no the
[51:19] only thing he has to do is just remain a
[51:21] sheep that's right the wool will
[51:24] automaticaly he will bear it because
[51:27] he's a seat and we're not asked to
[51:30] manufacture fruit we're supposed to
[51:34] produce fruit see see bear fruit see we
[51:40] supposed to bear fruit and as long as
[51:42] you are a fruit tree of God with God's
[51:45] Word God's Word will vindicate itself in
[51:49] a bear fruit as long as the world is in
[51:52] there jesus said if you abide in me and
[51:55] my words abide in you that's what you
[51:58] will and it shall be done see you don't
[52:00] manufacture it you you work yourself not
[52:04] up to it it's just actually there and it
[52:07] goes on and on amen
[52:13] right we're living in the age of
[52:15] identity hallelujah like I was saying
[52:19] with somebody out the other day and I
[52:20] don't I'm not sure if it was brother
[52:21] rich or not but my point is amen you
[52:25] don't win it when it comes to identity
[52:27] it is who you are and this is the age of
[52:31] identity everybody wants to be
[52:34] identified they want they want I can
[52:38] credit for doing whatever they do
[52:41] Alleluia
[52:42] you know and y'all know Hardy is it so
[52:45] personal now iPhone and iPad and you
[52:48] know hi something everybody wants
[52:50] something
[52:50] right is what I do and what I've done
[52:52] I've achieved yes it's mine
[52:55] Cooper wait we don't understand but
[52:57] we're living actually in the time like
[52:59] Estonia where God is not
[53:02] hardly ever spoken of and in this world
[53:06] if he here spoken of is in mockery
[53:09] hallelujah
[53:11] but everybody's talking about their
[53:13] achievements and they fail to see God's
[53:16] achievement right it's the truth like I
[53:20] said the men who built built the fake
[53:22] arm get more credit than the men who
[53:23] built the real one he goes down in
[53:28] history when the rich the men who did
[53:31] the real arm don't even they don't talk
[53:33] about him don't want to hear about him
[53:35] don't want his name mentioned hallelujah
[53:39] but God has a different way of
[53:40] identifying himself ah God
[53:43] is identified in his people when Satan
[53:47] thinks he's got God will this is when
[53:50] God raises up a standard hallelujah
[53:52] because the devil really thinks he can
[53:54] defeat God but God can never be defeated
[53:58] this is the year of power this is the
[54:01] year of strength
[54:02] this is the hour amen I believe even the
[54:05] bride will become more and more and more
[54:07] and more in tune to who she is and when
[54:10] it finally strike hallelujah she'll be
[54:13] stronger than Samson ever thought about
[54:15] it why she is Sevenfold hello she is
[54:22] seventh Oh powerful than the original
[54:27] Church I'm gonna say it again she is
[54:31] seven for more powerful than the
[54:35] original Church because she carries all
[54:39] of him each church had a portion of God
[54:43] but she has it all she comes to the
[54:47] false patch of Christ it is because of
[54:50] her God brings the rapture hallelujah as
[54:56] soon as she meets perfection God brings
[55:00] the rapture is that right
[55:03] where
[55:03] that fruit comes to its maturity God
[55:06] said quickly thrust in the sickle
[55:09] hallelujah let's gather it now so it
[55:12] won't spoil hallelujah amen think about
[55:16] it people of God right now you may not
[55:19] be right but endure but God is grooming
[55:22] you you're laying in the presence of the
[55:24] Sun and the Sun is getting rid of all of
[55:27] the green stuff in you why love these
[55:30] old days it won't be long but the man of
[55:34] the harvest woo he's gonna bring it he's
[55:40] going to gather us hallelujah and listen
[55:43] we're all most there when I was looking
[55:51] I was looking at this thing and I
[55:55] thought God brought to my mind he
[55:58] brought to me how that in this last day
[56:04] we you know it was some people think
[56:08] before I get to that age but let me say
[56:11] this when God began to identify and
[56:18] scripturally speak of people for example
[56:20] when God said a virgin shall conceive
[56:23] well it could not have been someone who
[56:26] had been with a mate of any kind it had
[56:30] to be a person here who never knew a man
[56:33] it had to be a virgin then brother
[56:35] Branham said that in that day Mary
[56:37] wasn't the only virgin there were other
[56:38] virgins but you see it had to be the
[56:41] right one and had to be the one that was
[56:44] in the mind of God before the foundation
[56:46] of the world in other words you you you
[56:49] know it just couldn't have been another
[56:51] Isaac I'm sure you're not the only Isaac
[56:53] named Isaac but it had to be the real
[56:55] Isaac that God had in this mind you know
[56:58] it had to be that like that you know
[57:00] you're I'm sure they're more Richardson
[57:02] and I'm sure they're more kissing you
[57:05] know all of us have names that other
[57:06] people have names but that has the same
[57:09] name but it could not have been that's
[57:11] more than one Isaiah Brooks believe it
[57:13] or not it is
[57:14] I've looked it up but there's only one
[57:17] Isaiah Brooks that I know of that was in
[57:20] the mind of God it was God's choosing it
[57:23] was God election and I had to fit the
[57:26] description I had to be one that was
[57:28] hearing the word I would jump right to
[57:30] it
[57:31] right because when the light strikes to
[57:33] see amen it causes a reaction that you
[57:37] and I cannot even control that's how it
[57:42] was with Mary when the last night angel
[57:45] came to Mary says listen you that one
[57:50] God showed me the other Mary that is
[57:53] supposed to bring forth Jesus hallelujah
[57:56] and you know I know how you're gonna
[57:59] respond but I'm going to talk to you
[58:00] anyhow
[58:01] yeah mary says well you know how is this
[58:04] thing gonna be you know I've seen that I
[58:06] don't know a man that means you could
[58:08] have said well we know you haven't made
[58:09] a man that's why you qualified for this
[58:12] position but not only that God saw you
[58:15] in his mind before the foundation the
[58:18] world and you the only one that can't
[58:19] produce him whoo God chose you as an
[58:24] incubator y'all hear what I'm saying
[58:27] that's what I'm saying about us tonight
[58:29] God has already described you
[58:34] he's already identified you when the
[58:38] word came to you that became your
[58:40] identification when oh when the word
[58:45] came to you and chose you that was God's
[58:48] saying you are identified and you are
[58:51] now in the description of what I call
[58:54] bride hallelujah and so in order for me
[58:58] to make this happen I must feel you with
[59:01] my Holy Spirit hallelujah
[59:05] it's not that power is not by light is
[59:08] by Holy Spirit I have chosen you you
[59:11] didn't choose me and he that begun the
[59:14] good work in you is faithful to complete
[59:16] don't you worry
[59:18] you're gonna go through your seasons
[59:20] you're gonna have your valleys but I
[59:24] love were there for you yea though I
[59:27] walk through the
[59:28] the shadow death I'll fear no evil for
[59:30] thou see that's your food
[59:33] that's your meat and I know that the
[59:36] word that I placed in you feeds off of
[59:39] this I have produced the life in you
[59:44] that can only be satisfied by this so I
[59:48] know I'm not gonna work at it there's no
[59:50] place or worrying me only confident that
[59:54] what I put in you will produce and
[59:59] become the very manifestation of my
[1:00:04] purpose for you being born Oh somebody
[1:00:09] oughta shout now so you see it ain't no
[1:00:12] chance thank God it's not rolling dice
[1:00:14] but God is telling the people I chose
[1:00:17] you you are bride
[1:00:20] believe me I say you are bride just like
[1:00:23] Mary she couldn't comprehend how this
[1:00:26] virgin was called a conceived and the
[1:00:27] prophecy the angel said believe me this
[1:00:33] thing that I'm telling you about is of
[1:00:34] the Holy Ghost and he will overshadow
[1:00:37] you and he will produce this child
[1:00:39] hallelujah
[1:00:40] so you must understand it's the Holy
[1:00:42] Ghost that will produce Christ in you
[1:00:45] hey man see so you and I must realize by
[1:00:50] God's grace we're living in a time now
[1:00:53] remember the world is going to burn I
[1:00:55] read that scripture the world is going
[1:00:58] to burn is that right hallelujah
[1:01:03] but you know the Bible tells us also
[1:01:06] that God will keep and protect us he
[1:01:09] protected nor in his day is that right
[1:01:11] amen he protected those ones in Moses
[1:01:15] day that second Exodus we're in the
[1:01:17] third Exodus where the world will be
[1:01:20] destroyed by fire it's a promise now you
[1:01:24] think God would promise a fire baptism
[1:01:27] for the world and we'll give you one
[1:01:28] when he promised it he promised you a
[1:01:32] fire baptism why because he know you
[1:01:35] cannot get rid of the demons on your own
[1:01:38] it takes fire they're super
[1:01:42] Metro Devils it takes fire to get rid of
[1:01:45] the demons hallelujah amen you feel
[1:01:50] better than a little bit brother I know
[1:01:51] you're struggling over there but God got
[1:01:52] God gonna touch you amen so you realized
[1:01:55] by God's grace that God a man has
[1:01:57] everything under control right amen you
[1:02:02] and I were supposed to be in the clubs
[1:02:04] of the rock in a resting place not a
[1:02:07] place of struggling in a resting place
[1:02:09] having confidence that he this that
[1:02:12] sherry was going to perform it he will
[1:02:14] perform it hallelujah it's okay yeah
[1:02:23] when I was studying this I got a hurry
[1:02:25] God God spoke to me about the Passover
[1:02:27] and I thought Passover and I'm talking
[1:02:29] about
[1:02:29] season of power but you see as long as
[1:02:32] the Jews was under the control of
[1:02:36] Pharaoh they couldn't do what they want
[1:02:39] to do they couldn't even worship God
[1:02:41] remember Moses asked Pharaoh says let me
[1:02:44] let me take him and let us go worshiping
[1:02:46] and Pharaoh wanted Moses to leave
[1:02:48] something behind but Moses no no no when
[1:02:50] I leave I'm not leaving one roof behind
[1:02:52] and so we find out that here they were
[1:02:55] in bondage they were enslaved by
[1:02:57] themselves and really amen if you look
[1:02:59] at Egypt Egypt was also not only a type
[1:03:01] of bondage but it was like a type of
[1:03:03] hell because they were whipped they were
[1:03:05] beaten they were driven you know they
[1:03:07] were starved everything that you can
[1:03:09] imagine with that would take place in
[1:03:11] hell was happening in Egypt according to
[1:03:14] the children of Israel
[1:03:16] so remember amen when the past overcame
[1:03:19] amen it was the slaying of a lamb and
[1:03:22] putting the bra our blood on the
[1:03:24] doorpost and of the lentil and this land
[1:03:27] was called the Paschal Lamb is that
[1:03:29] right amen and you must you must
[1:03:32] understand that it is a measure how can
[1:03:35] I say it
[1:03:36] this Paschal Lamb was basically working
[1:03:39] with with Egypt and in in excusing that
[1:03:42] Egypt Easter amen it was it was also
[1:03:45] dealing with a resurrection so when you
[1:03:47] and I are talking about a Paschal Lamb
[1:03:50] is also it talks about a festivity it
[1:03:53] was something that they celebrated
[1:03:56] now while they were going through it it
[1:03:57] wasn't so great it wasn't so grand
[1:04:00] you know God is gonna send us a
[1:04:02] deliverer and understand that's what I
[1:04:05] want people to understand if you don't
[1:04:06] cry out God won't hear you
[1:04:09] not that God can read your thoughts God
[1:04:12] wants you to cry out is that right
[1:04:15] because the Bible said that God said and
[1:04:18] unto Moses I have heard the cry of the
[1:04:23] people hallelujah
[1:04:26] they wanted deliverance and until you
[1:04:29] want to live you you if your desperation
[1:04:32] don't make you cry to get free you're
[1:04:35] not desperate enough hello y'all hear me
[1:04:39] you got a cry you gotta be desperate to
[1:04:43] be delivered if you're not desperate
[1:04:45] guarding gonna hear you
[1:04:46] it is the desperate cry of his children
[1:04:49] that makes him here I have heard their
[1:04:53] cry and I have come down to deliver Oh
[1:04:58] hallelujah so you and I must understand
[1:05:02] Amen when the blood would place on the
[1:05:04] doorpost a little what did the children
[1:05:06] of Israel do Moses didn't declare didn't
[1:05:10] have them to do nothing but to slay a
[1:05:12] lamb and put their blood on the doorpost
[1:05:15] a little that was in they was just as
[1:05:18] evil as they ever lost but that blood
[1:05:22] covered them that blood protected them
[1:05:25] you think they think you because you
[1:05:27] saved your flesh you're saying you gotta
[1:05:32] kill it you can't trust a soul boy you
[1:05:38] better kill it
[1:05:42] it could be sanctified today and sinful
[1:05:45] tomorrow so we realized by God's grace
[1:05:53] amen all that that's why I said this
[1:05:55] morning at the end of the day when you
[1:05:58] get ready to cross over you will not
[1:06:00] have a list of all the great things
[1:06:02] you've ever done for God absolutely not
[1:06:06] the only thing you're gonna have is Lord
[1:06:08] you gave me the
[1:06:10] here's my token Lord let me cross over
[1:06:13] that's it well is that not true the
[1:06:18] Bible said everyone that came is his
[1:06:20] Lord have we not done these mighty works
[1:06:23] in your name he said you are evil thing
[1:06:26] get away from me I don't even know you
[1:06:29] because if you realize if any Christian
[1:06:31] any Christian no there is no good thing
[1:06:34] in your flesh everything that is done
[1:06:37] good is of God and God gets all the
[1:06:41] glory what I'm gonna say Lord you know
[1:06:45] in that concert I sang so good your Holy
[1:06:47] Spirit came that's not a preacher
[1:06:53] weather of the case that's nonsense
[1:06:57] hallelujah those elders 24 elders knew
[1:06:59] better right when y'all words were that
[1:07:01] they threw down their cups and fell on
[1:07:04] the flo instantaneously because they
[1:07:06] knew it was the grace of God that God
[1:07:08] I'm there
[1:07:09] what nothing they did just was blessed
[1:07:12] because they were there you know God God
[1:07:17] is here God rewards you for allowing him
[1:07:20] to use your body and yet he's the one
[1:07:22] that gave it to you
[1:07:23] now that's a win-win there mmm ooh
[1:07:30] Passover y'all understand what I'm
[1:07:32] saying because what we're doing is it we
[1:07:35] really we call it Passover but you and I
[1:07:37] are experiencing
[1:07:39] that's why don't understand why people
[1:07:40] be so sad and everything when God has
[1:07:43] delivered you and guess what all you can
[1:07:46] see is the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:07:47] protects you that in itself eat'em that
[1:07:50] make a real Christian jump for joy jump
[1:07:54] for joy when you realize that the only
[1:07:56] reason why you're not dead right now is
[1:07:58] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] protecting the raft of God away from you
[1:08:03] what I see the Blood I pass over you and
[1:08:06] then the devil tell you you ain't got
[1:08:08] nothing I may not have wealth riches and
[1:08:11] untold but I got the blood hey in the
[1:08:17] man in his right mind know you right now
[1:08:20] every one of us need should have been
[1:08:22] dead where
[1:08:23] long ago oh I'm a Christian how many
[1:08:26] mistakes you've made since you've been a
[1:08:27] Christian and yet God spared your life
[1:08:31] you must see something and surely ain't
[1:08:34] you you think because you might you
[1:08:36] might think you may be good-looking God
[1:08:38] don't save you cuz you're good-looking
[1:08:40] what was that what was that what was
[1:08:43] that which that was that Martin was it
[1:08:45] Martin I can't remember the one that was
[1:08:47] really not so good-looking
[1:08:49] out of all the seven and the people even
[1:08:52] really cute I think it was Martin Luther
[1:08:55] whichever not look whatever one it was
[1:08:58] they were right in the papers how ugly
[1:09:00] he was and can't understand why people
[1:09:03] come to see it and this this guy came in
[1:09:06] and he says you know you know the papers
[1:09:09] right we can't understand why people
[1:09:10] come to see you he said the truth of the
[1:09:12] matter is they don't come to see me they
[1:09:14] come to see Christ hallelujah they're
[1:09:17] not looking I don't get how ugly I might
[1:09:19] be it ain't that
[1:09:20] this what they looking at they looking
[1:09:22] at what's inside what's coming out of

[1:09:30] their life you become the most beautiful
[1:09:33] thing they ever seen is this okay
[1:09:38] let me hurry up let me hurry up now
[1:09:41] listen psalms of psalms psalm 16 7 says
[1:09:44] I will bless the Lord who have given me
[1:09:46] counsel my rains also instruct me in the
[1:09:51] night season and I told you amen their
[1:09:54] season sometimes when you can't see
[1:09:56] there's something that God connects you
[1:09:59] to he knows how to pool your range you
[1:10:01] know what I'm saying you know what the
[1:10:02] rain is when you got that Bridal thing
[1:10:04] in your mouth and and the god that's
[1:10:06] riding the horse he pulls it which way -
[1:10:08] left right left right right that's how
[1:10:12] God's Word he instruct me and then he
[1:10:14] give me some time I he may not speak to
[1:10:17] me brother he may not even say a word
[1:10:19] but he knows how to turn on me he knows
[1:10:21] how to pull me left or right he knows
[1:10:24] how to direct me even in the night
[1:10:26] season huh Oh what is it
[1:10:31] how did Samson know that there were two
[1:10:35] pillows
[1:10:37] he couldn't see he was blind he told
[1:10:42] that little lad direct me to those two
[1:10:44] pillows Oh what was it it was God in the
[1:10:50] night season direct in him so he could
[1:10:54] be the right position to gain his
[1:10:56] victory range the controlling or
[1:11:01] directing power right the government he
[1:11:05] was the government he had the government
[1:11:06] on the shoulder he's the one that's
[1:11:07] directing us and going in the right way
[1:11:10] and sometimes you might think you're
[1:11:11] going the wrong way when you're going
[1:11:13] the right way is that right
[1:11:15] amen look like Abraham and lot look like
[1:11:18] lot chose the better lane
[1:11:20] ha ha oh but that's not true it was
[1:11:24] Abraham his land was not so nice but
[1:11:26] that's where God met him those seasons
[1:11:33] will come listen then you're 2 and 21 I
[1:11:35] love the way he says it he changes the
[1:11:38] times and the seasons he removeth kings
[1:11:40] and setteth up kings he giveth the
[1:11:43] wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to
[1:11:45] them that know that no understanding and
[1:11:49] you know when God gave me that scripture
[1:11:51] he brought me to our Russia President
[1:11:54] Putin and president trunk now I'm just
[1:11:57] going to say what he said to me you
[1:12:00] don't have to accept it but even because
[1:12:02] a man is ordained of God doesn't mean
[1:12:04] he's a Christian or he saved hello
[1:12:08] that's the truth Pharoah was directed by
[1:12:11] God is that right is that right never
[1:12:13] kanessa was directed by God he even made
[1:12:16] a statement your God is God but it
[1:12:20] doesn't mean he was saved right so you
[1:12:23] and I must understand when God places
[1:12:25] people at servants that's all they are
[1:12:27] servants right Amen so I looked at Putin
[1:12:33] which I didn't know what the meaning of
[1:12:35] Putin was until I looked it up then I
[1:12:37] was really surprised it means to force
[1:12:40] or drive some course of action and they
[1:12:44] use this to put an army to flight
[1:12:49] in other words he is one that forces and
[1:12:55] pushes for an action think about what
[1:13:01] I'm saying think about what what we're
[1:13:04] going through right now that's why God
[1:13:05] put him there that's why God called him
[1:13:09] all right he's gonna put it he's gonna
[1:13:11] make it he's going to make the
[1:13:13] prophecies of God come to pass is that
[1:13:17] right cuz that's what the Bible said God
[1:13:19] put in the hearts of all of teen Kings
[1:13:22] to give their authority over to the
[1:13:25] Beast God did it and God has placed in
[1:13:30] this man even if he is not the one that
[1:13:32] pushed the button he's pushing it he's
[1:13:36] making it happen right oh come on
[1:13:39] somebody and you know you said what do
[1:13:42] you mean even when Obama was in office
[1:13:44] and they passed that law y'all know what
[1:13:46] I'm saying well same-sex could marry and
[1:13:49] I like you know even Putin say America
[1:13:51] ought to be ashamed of themselves they
[1:13:53] know better than that a man who we say
[1:13:59] is a heathen but he was put there to
[1:14:06] bring us to our knees and the whole time
[1:14:10] he got into our our mess and messed it
[1:14:12] up more so and trunk means to devise
[1:14:17] deceitfully or dishonestly to excel to
[1:14:24] surpass and out do hello it doesn't mean
[1:14:30] just the truck bumper but papa
[1:14:32] but it's like in when you doing car
[1:14:34] Trump up you got a hand you got
[1:14:38] something I don't know nothing about
[1:14:38] cars so I don't know what I'm talking
[1:14:40] about when it comes to that how to play
[1:14:42] it but the way I read it is like when
[1:14:44] you when you you're playing this trump
[1:14:46] game you already got something going in
[1:14:48] your hand deceitfully and you carry on
[1:14:51] like you got more than what you got
[1:14:52] until somebody expose what they don't
[1:14:54] have and then you show them what they
[1:14:56] what you've got see so you got to
[1:14:59] understand these names are not just
[1:15:01] there just to be there
[1:15:03] I it's like when when when when Israel
[1:15:08] was in Babylon they had to honor the
[1:15:12] Babylonian king God said if you don't
[1:15:15] honor the Babylonian king I'm gonna kill
[1:15:17] you
[1:15:17] imma let them kill you you know and
[1:15:20] because I'm speaking the way I'm
[1:15:23] speaking it's not because I dishonor
[1:15:25] Trump or dishonor Putin truth is what it
[1:15:27] is I'm honoring what I see God doing
[1:15:31] through the land you hear what I'm
[1:15:33] saying
[1:15:34] I want a rapture and I know that certain
[1:15:37] conditions must be met
[1:15:40] globally before we enter into our
[1:15:43] rapture I said this morning amen even
[1:15:47] though this is Satan's Eden brother
[1:15:50] Branham also calls this the rapture age
[1:15:53] the age of the rapture that means this
[1:15:57] age cannot close without the rapture
[1:16:00] taking place and here we are here we are
[1:16:05] like God was using Noah to build an ark
[1:16:09] here's God building an ark he's building
[1:16:13] a people he's building a tabernacle
[1:16:15] because that's all they are cloth the
[1:16:18] ark was just another form of a
[1:16:20] tabernacle where animals and people
[1:16:23] would live this is a tabernacle where
[1:16:26] God will live and God is building this
[1:16:29] tabernacle to do what escape the fire
[1:16:35] mmm
[1:16:37] the move is on the bride is that Alright
[1:16:42] said anyone's gonna be long and I'm
[1:16:44] almost done what we must do is we need
[1:16:48] to start facing the prophecies we must
[1:16:51] take everything that brother Branham
[1:16:52] said that you and I are to be and we
[1:16:58] must allow the Holy Spirit to apply it
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:06] we must allow the Holy Spirit to apply
[1:17:10] it now you take for an example because I
[1:17:14] don't want you to take the human element
[1:17:16] out of this and that's where people get
[1:17:18] rid of funny they don't know that Jesus
[1:17:20] Christ was a man yet he was God and you
[1:17:23] look at Peter and you fail to see that
[1:17:25] Peter was a man Peter denied Jesus three
[1:17:28] times even when God told him he was
[1:17:30] going to deny me he didn't believe he
[1:17:32] would but their prophecies couldn't be
[1:17:34] broken Jesus had already spoken it
[1:17:37] you're going to deny me three times and
[1:17:39] before the crow right so it had to
[1:17:42] be but it never took away who he was or
[1:17:46] his identity because Jesus had already
[1:17:48] previously told them that you were with
[1:17:50] me before the foundation of the world he
[1:17:52] had already told them that you may not
[1:17:56] know me but I know you cuz you were with
[1:17:58] me right and so he told them that so
[1:18:02] they had an identity so now he's telling
[1:18:04] all of us the same thing we were with
[1:18:07] you you were with me I was with you he
[1:18:10] even praised in Saint John 17 Father
[1:18:12] make them one even as we are one he
[1:18:15] talks about he says Lord the glory that
[1:18:17] I had with you before the foundation of
[1:18:19] the world Lord I give this glory to them
[1:18:23] but is it he's trying to get you to see
[1:18:27] your identity yes we are men we are
[1:18:31] human we are flesh amen but at the same
[1:18:34] time we are God I didn't say gods I say
[1:18:39] God because we are the housing of the
[1:18:42] Living God hallelujah we are the very
[1:18:47] housing of the Living God is that right
[1:18:54] so you've got to realize that when
[1:18:56] Israel was moving in those tents that
[1:18:58] was God intense that was God in you that
[1:19:02] was God in me God intense but at a at a
[1:19:06] time period change the season changed
[1:19:09] they no longer went around in tents why
[1:19:11] because David said Lord it ain't right
[1:19:14] that everybody's building all of these
[1:19:16] fine houses
[1:19:17] got a nice one and you don't have one
[1:19:19] and then God comes along and says can
[1:19:22] any any household mean heaven is my
[1:19:26] throne and earth this is my footstool
[1:19:29] but I have provided myself a body
[1:19:34] hallelujah amen so now the tents were
[1:19:38] done away with why because in shadow and
[1:19:41] time there was gonna come a New
[1:19:43] Jerusalem and read a little quote and I
[1:19:56] let you go now if the churches will
[1:20:00] forget their Creed's
[1:20:01] and forget their dogmas and just take
[1:20:05] the Bible and plead the promise then it
[1:20:08] would come affect it to them but see
[1:20:12] Jesus said you with your traditions make
[1:20:15] the Word of God and not effective to you
[1:20:17] well that's the same thing today with
[1:20:20] spiritual Eve see spiritual bride of
[1:20:23] today so call the church she takes the
[1:20:26] Word of God and she won't accept it and
[1:20:29] she accept Dogma instead therefore the
[1:20:33] word is not affected to her see because
[1:20:36] she tries to inject her Creed with the
[1:20:39] word and it won't work now now what we
[1:20:43] need today see that's the problem if
[1:20:45] you're gonna inject your Creed you're
[1:20:47] gonna check your Dogma it is not gonna
[1:20:49] work
[1:20:50] Alleluia is that right oh my the
[1:20:56] spiritual bride that was born on the day
[1:20:58] of Pentecost of Christ before he could
[1:21:01] get to her what happened she fell at
[1:21:03] wrong what is it she added to the word
[1:21:06] the God said with his stripes you'll
[1:21:08] heal you heal amen if God said you
[1:21:11] brought your bride
[1:21:12] ain't no use an end to it if God said
[1:21:15] you saved by grace you're saved by grace
[1:21:16] not grace plus grace right now but in
[1:21:23] the day there is no but listen but now
[1:21:27] but in the day there is to come a super
[1:21:30] royal
[1:21:31] seed of Abraham that's exactly what I'll
[1:21:34] be it'll be
[1:21:35] would be a royal bride to the Royal to
[1:21:40] the Royal promise son as I spoke last
[1:21:43] night I won't be it won't be a natural
[1:21:46] seed
[1:21:46] it'll be spiritual seed there's to be a
[1:21:50] spiritual bride raised up which will be
[1:21:53] the royal seed of the ROI of faith of
[1:21:55] Abraham's we're all your son she is to
[1:21:58] come on the scene in the last days and
[1:22:00] time and place is a promise that's given
[1:22:04] to her time and place is a promise
[1:22:09] that's given to her right
[1:22:11] according to Malachi 4 a scripture there
[1:22:14] is to rise a message that will shake the
[1:22:17] hearts of the people right back to the
[1:22:19] opposite Onex fathers again there is to
[1:22:22] rise on the scene in the power of elijah
[1:22:24] that arrives on the scene a willingness
[1:22:27] men that have come out and will have a
[1:22:29] message that a run right straight back
[1:22:31] to the word again
[1:22:33] that's the hour we're living in
[1:22:38] hallelujah he goes on to say the
[1:22:42] resurrection is sure in another message
[1:22:45] it's a gamma t and we have the earnest
[1:22:49] of it now as the holy spirit comes in
[1:22:52] and identify us as God redeemed person
[1:22:56] see he did say God redeemed persons he
[1:23:01] said God redeemed person amen
[1:23:05] and when you received the Holy Ghost you
[1:23:09] seal to the journey it's over that is
[1:23:13] your token that you hold hallelujah and
[1:23:17] so I'm just going to close there he said
[1:23:22] that shows your fear has been paid you

[1:24:12] we be if it wasn't for the cleansing
[1:24:14] power how many of y'all have overcome by
[1:24:17] your own might none of us we have
[1:24:20] overcome because of the blood of Jesus
[1:24:23] Christ and when you hear me say blood
[1:24:24] I'm talking about the life of Christ
[1:24:26] which means the Holy Ghost that is the
[1:24:29] spiritual blood of Christ that cleanses
[1:24:31] us from all our unrighteousness and you

[1:24:38] about Trump even about our Putin there
[1:24:43] it's right yeah I wouldn't never thought

[1:25:11] that you ain't nothing I'm nothing right
[1:25:14] and I just thank God that God didn't
[1:25:17] choose me and it was more things I could

[1:25:25] understand it has to be pushed America
[1:25:28] has to be pushed we've got to be pushed

[1:25:33] boss for a long time now God is pushing

[1:26:01] light and darkness has been separated
[1:26:04] boo let us stand we are eating off of
[1:26:16] the tree of what life the world eats off
[1:26:20] of the tree of good and evil hallelujah

[1:26:46] thank you Father for your amazing grace
[1:26:49] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:26:53] you think about how Paul used the
[1:26:56] political realm to get to Rome God told
[1:26:59] him he had to go to Rome Paul what was
[1:27:03] the man that uh said you almost
[1:27:05] convinced me to be a Christian what was
[1:27:07] he saying I can't think right now
[1:27:08] amen and Paul refused to be free he says
[1:27:15] no I want to go and they say they
[1:27:19] thought he was crazy
[1:27:20] he said I'm saying but God had those
[1:27:23] people in position and Paul knew he was
[1:27:25] going to Nero's chocolate chopping block
[1:27:27] he knew he wasn't going to escape but
[1:27:30] God told him but you got to go witness
[1:27:31] to him you see what I'm saying
[1:27:33] God set these people up set everything
[1:27:36] up and I read the scripture he sets up
[1:27:38] kings and brings them down amen
[1:27:41] just like he everything is gonna flow
[1:27:44] into his plan is that right
[1:27:46] but now the movies on the bride if God
[1:27:49] warned it for the Brenham to do what
[1:27:52] some people say he was gonna do he would
[1:27:54] have left him here
[1:27:55] but the power of what was in him is now
[1:27:59] in us we bring the rapture own folks
[1:28:06] is that right let me say it like brother
[1:28:08] branham say that I'm gonna let you go he
[1:28:11] said the voice of the Resurrection is in
