Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is so wonderful where will we be without [Music] him I know it's raining outside but it shouldn't be raining insidey when it comes to the African songs I don't know them but most of you all do and when anybody is singing up here you supposed to join in you say is that scriptural M got her tambourine she started singing and millions of the saints of God dance on the Red Sea show just remember amen that this is uh not entertainment this is worship amen so you're free to worship but I would be disappointed if I was God and all I got was a I don't know I don't even know where your mind was but it wasn't on it wasn't on the singing I tell you what if I understood what they singing I would have given even more but I thank God I do I really do thank God for what you did [Music] give opinion worth is better than nothing am I say those things in love when we recognize the day and time that we're living in it's going to change it's going to change things because the worship opportunity that we have right now will soon be taken from you glad to have our brother Nathan with us brother Nathan is one or's uh friends he was there at the funeral and I am so pleased to see him amen it just shows that overall has something going on of us who love and appreciate him still miss him dearly amen as we stand uh let's uh read from Matthew 24 and then we'll read from Matthew 11 I am going to perhaps say some rough things in the beginning but these things being said but these things being said will it's only to get your attention we're living in the last days I would say the last minute of time anything can happen but my question is are you ready the bride has made herself ready I say that again the bride has made herself ready and I trust by the grace of God that we're spinning that time with God making oursel ready Matthew 24 34-35 verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away hallelujah hallelujah one more scripture here Matthew 11 28 through 30 at reads come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen glad to have some of my family here his one more scripture let's go to Genesis 3:4 how many of y'all believe that Jesus Christ is the same today and forever hallelujah hallelujah and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die my message on this morning one line of Deceit one line of Deceit and that line was spoken by the serpent ye shall not surely die let us pray father God we come before you as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do and all that you will do Lord we know we can't do nothing without you and all glory be to your name Lord Jesus let the service in a special way ears to the hearer Lord that the word may find place in their souls father we pray that you would water the word 100f in bless us now forgive us of all of our sins all of our trespasses all of our thoughts and ideas that have not been aligned to your word Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated well you know I I want to say by the grace of God we welcome everyone once again but I also want to stir up your conscience so that you could realize the day that you're living in some things are so uncertain and we think sometimes we stand in a place of [Music] security but there is only one place of security and that's in Jesus Christ I think about the Titanic and it's amazing how Hollywood won't let it die but I don't believe it's Hollywood Hollywood uh that brings that inspiration I believe God makes it happen just to remind people that anything man made cannot be trusted you can't put your Assurance in these natural things because the natural things are not the real things the real things are the supernatural things some people uh put their trust in people put their trust in businesses put their uh their trust in churches and remember the scripture in in the wisdom of Solomon he found seven churches and none of them were faithful he used the type as women church is Aiken as to a woman some people Church in uh trust in [Music] families but your family will fail you some people trust in friends but your friends will fail you the Bible said put no trust in the arms of Flesh but we'll do that and as I said there's only one place you can put your trust there's only one place of assurance the Bible said the grass will wither the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall stand the Bible tells us that heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away they ask a man one time where would you rather be standing in heaven or the word and the man said the word because heaven and earth away but the word of the Lord shall stand I want to say something to those of us who follow this message the message of the end time the message that God sent us to help us prepare for a Rapture I want to say to you it's later than what you think uh your denomination can't save you your pastor can't save you hallelujah hallelujah y'all getting quiet over the only person that can save you is the Lord Jesus Christ that's not an uncertainty that is a certainty Hallelujah I'm trying not to get excited I'm already excited I'm trying to to keep this together today Jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and I heavy laden and I will give you rest hallelujah hallelujah is that right uh when we think about salvation sometimes we hold on to things that we shouldn't but the only place of security is in the scripture that and and we call it the City of Refuge because we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but the Bible says take my yoke upon you and learn of me that's what people don't want to see they don't want to understand you don't just come to Christ you must learn of him and the only way to learn of him is to learn his word for I am meek and lowly in heart now let me go back to the learn part this has nothing to do with education you can be as ignorant as a rock and you can learn of God because the Bible says that the holy spirit will lead you and guide you into all truth when you learn of God you learn by experience not by somebody telling you it's a one-on-one situation where you literally come to understand God by his leadership Hallelujah is that right remember the woman with the issue of blood Hallelujah she more than likely wasn't educated but one thing for certain she was a true servant of the Lord hallelujah now what told her or who told her if I would just touch the H of His Garment I would be made whole that was a revelation that only God could have given her it wasn't written the Pharisees couldn't have given it to us sades could not have given it to her the only one that could have given her this Revelation was God himself hello somebody let me say it like this God bypassed the humanity of Jesus Hallelujah you say what do you mean because even Jesus turned and said who touched me Hallelujah Hallelujah is that right I look at what what what Jesus asked Peter Jesus asked Peter who do men say I the son of man am and Peter said some say that's the thing you can't go by what some say You must have a revelation of him yourself some say he's Jeremiah you understand or some of the other prophets but Jesus said who do you say I am Hallelujah is that right he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and what did Jesus say Flesh and Blood theology didn't give you this going to greatest school that's here in Jerusalem didn't give that to you Hallelujah My Father which is in heaven he has given this unto you in other words he is basically saying it's the spirit of God the Holy Spirit has revealed this unto you and Upon This Rock hallelujah hallelujah the Gates of Hell shall not prevail see if you can be educated into Jesus you can also be uneducated somebody can take your education Hallelujah huj now what are you saying brother my daddy my natural daddy Hallelujah was a Christian he sang gospel music he was well known his era among the quartex but he was persuaded to become a Muslim you understand me he didn't have a true knowledge of the God he was worshiping he didn't have a revelation of Jesus Christ because once you have a revelation Jesus Christ no matter the winds may blow the waves May Dash but nothing will remove you from that Revelation that your life is built upon which is Jesus Christ himself think about this one line of dece and We Know by the grace of God the serpent didn't preach a great sermon to persuade Eve to do what she did matter of fact he preached the very sermon God gave to ad he just added one word not you shall surely not die y hear what I'm saying that one line of Deceit hased us into this chaos today every hospital because of that one line of dece every graveyard is because of that one line of Deceit exist every fire that destroy families is because of that one line of Deceit every hurricane sh sh every tornado sh every earthquake is because of that one line of dece your physical conditions right now is because of that one line of Deceit Hallelujah the demons that you fight it's because of that one line of Deceit Hallelujah those Dimensions were separated hallelujah hallelujah the demons existed but they had no way of entering in Hallelujah until the word was broken in the time of Adam and Eve they never suffered they never had a need they never had a want Hallelujah because God had those demonic Powers separated you say that brother I don't know what you're saying but the Bible tells us that Lucifer and his Angel was cast out Hallelujah but see they couldn't get into Human family the serent beg the woman follow suit Hallelujah and the breach was brought brought in Hallelujah right y'all know what I'm saying if you cut yourself it brings a breach and if you don't take care of it it will get infected hallelujah hallelujah and that's the way it was Genesis all the way up to Calvary mankind was suffering from infections diseases Hallelujah because of the breach because of one line of Deceit hallelujah hallelujah is that all right the moving of the serpent seed from the beginning to the end Satan from that point on began to build his kingdom Hallelujah is that the truth it got so bad so God had to destroy the Earth by water started all over again Hallelujah is that right even in Sodom God it got so bad God had to destroy it why because Satan was moving fast a God does things in order hallelujah hallelujah and and had Satan won then we wouldn't be here today listen he's people say well I don't believe in the devil you don't have to believe in I can hold up this handkerchief and you say and you can say I don't believe you got a handkerchief in your hand what difference doesn't me me if you don't believe the reality is I have a handkerchief in my hand people say well I don't believe in Jesus CH what different does it make Hallelujah huj he's come he's died he resurrected and he's living today hallelujah hallelujah how do you know he's living brother because he lives in me he's still heals he still delivers he's still raised from the dead Hallelujah he's still God so what difference does it make Satan offered this world to Christ Hallelujah but he he turned it down thank God is that right why because of the breach Satan had control of the Earth the air Prince and the power of the air hallelujah hallelujah and it's still that way and how is he controlling it now television through radio all these technology Hallelujah that uses the airwaves to get to the hearts of the people still ruling hallelujah hallelujah is that right but Jesus said don't you worry my Kingdom's coming hallelujah hallelujah is that right because that's what pil said to him that's what pilot said to Jesus basically he asked the question are you a king and Jesus said thou sayth Hallelujah and he said if this kingdom was mine I would fight for it hallelujah hallelujah is that right but he said for this purpose came out into the world what do you mean to establish my kingdom in this earth not in heaven in this earth Hallelujah don't mean we're not going to heaven it doesn't mean we're not going to heaven but Jesus said let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven because he knew that he was one day inherited all are you listening people we are now living in Satan's Eden but thanks be to God that we have had a Calvary Hallelujah you see everything now is so uncertain we we are on pins and needles we on edge because we don't know what tomorrow will hold for us hallelujah uh and this is not just in America everywhere everything's falling apart hallelujah hallelujah you know we can say this and and and I'll say this myself my heart goes out for those are in in Ukraine and other places where they y I'm getting excited because you got to realize how blessed you are amen bombs are not falling here yet Hallelujah but you can see the Gathering of the darkness there is a war coming Hallelujah and you better believe you the only way you're going to be able to withstand Satan is that you have put on the whole armor of God Jesus Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah cuz if you fight by the sword you're going to die hallelujah hallelujah these others this is this is my subtopic one or the other one or the other which one you going to be or the other see you got to decide what you're going to be who you are you know like I said I was in Colombia Carina and we ministered there at my old church and I preached on the likeness and the image the very thing I preached here except for God dealt with their needs and the people were so blessed and they said this is what we need I can give you great Revelation play with you now we're in the season where the bride makes herself ready how many agree with that yes we're in the season where God where the bride makes herself ready ready for what the translation what people call the Rapture the translation but understand there's two Destin one destiny is heaven and the other Destiny is Hell there's only two seeds one seed is of God and the other seed is of the Hallelujah Hallelujah one or the other the others were in John the Baptist day is that right I'm talking about the devil and his children the others were in Jes day is that right even Jesus when you he saw the the Pharisees he basically said you had a cloak and you had a covering Hallelujah you look religious Pi you're Pious and if I had not come you would have been able to hide you can't hide from the light that's the Bible and the word of God is light you can't hide from the light Hallelujah the light comes to despair Darkness Hallelujah and listen the devil don't care where he hides Hallelujah is that right he can hide in your boss he can hide you know in your school he hides wherever he wants but when the light comes you understand me the Bible said we are the light of the world a city that sits on a hill that can be Hallelujah don't get upset because you can't be like them Hallelujah you ought to Rejoice that God has chosen you to be a light of the world hallelujah hallelujah don't get jealous of them let them have all this world me but give me Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we're at an hour that we must watch and pray Hallelujah you heard me say Satan in his battle battling the bride knew her powers and her strength Hallelujah he know that the word of God and prayer are the two greatest weapons that they have hallelujah hallelujah so he knows if he gets you to stop reading the Bible the message pray Hallelujah and he also know that if he can divide a church they won't be able to move forward because a house body cannot stand you said what do you mean brother R look at our own country we have never been so divided in our lives or our history and what's happening to us we are being conquered Hallelujah not by a political Realm by Satan himself amen they are devils are always they are in great and high positions Hallelujah is that right are they in the government politics religion look at all the preachers amen that that claim to be giving uh Salvation to the people and basically all they're doing is preaching psychology Hallelujah I don't need to know how to live here I find my way in this place I need to prepare for the life to come y'all hear me this this life is going to end every one of us if the Lord carries we are going to go to the Grave Hallelujah and is at that point you need to know whether you one or the other to be honest with you it will be revealed yeah there's nothing more horrifying to be on your death bed to know you missed it many people come down to that point and you know what often time they don't even repent or even have a desire to repent my my sister was a nurse of some sort and she had to take care of this woman who was an she claimed she didn't believe in God but on her deathbed God showed up and she's talking you not even supposed to exist and she start cursing Jesus she went out that way where do you think she went you understand me hallelujah hallelujah perhaps God gave her a space to repent she she cursed the very thing that could save her Hallelujah understand me let me move on this is why it's so important to stay with the line of the word God's word is right and we're going to all all be judged according to the word not according to your organization not according to your denomination Hallelujah not according to your own opinion it will be the word that will judge you in hallelujah hallelujah a trumpet gives an uncertain sound what we need tonight soldiers to pro pro to possess every Divine promise hallelujah hallelujah you know it's time out for your living amen it's time out for your living why don't you live for Christ this is what we call Christians for we call Christians so that we live for Christ hallelujah hallelujah even Paul said the life I live oh I live it unto Christ you understand me it means that you died to your own will you ride it to your own ambition Hallelujah now your ambition is to share this gospel if all you can do is sing for Jesus sing for Jesus if all God give you is a dance for Jesus dance for Jesus has giv you use it one thing about the devil's children they're not ashamed of him they're not ashamed of they get out on the street they they do all that Dirty Dancing whatever more they do Hallelujah they wear everything they want to in kind of and listen you got people who claim to [Music] Christian dancing for the devil doing the devil's work hallah y'all understand me somebody got to stand up Hallelujah somebody has to be a real Christian amen yes you and I we're few in number but it doesn't take a many lights to shine one light can break bre the darkness Hallelujah this is what I'm looking for we claim to be bride like to say in that song then show me some sign is more than talk hallelujah hallelujah you know when you when when when when people want to bet on something um people say put your money where your mouth is yeah you got it you understand me and I'm going say this the TR right now no matter how you put it here in your head it's got to be in your heart it's where the heart believes y understand me and as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Hallelujah no matter how much grace is given to you if you don't have the Revelation that God has given you the grace you to always see yourself as a sinner Hallelujah but if when you're in Christ there is no failure when you're in Christ you're no longer a sinner you can't be a sinner and a s the blood of Jesus Christ washes us from all our sin hallelujah hallelujah it purifies us and we must put on the whole arm of God the will always stop that demon of unbelief because remember I said the strongest demon Satan has in his group is unbelief and everything else follows Hallelujah is that right unbelief can stop a resurrection hallelujah hallelujah what did Jesus tell Mary and Martha did not I say if you believe you will see hallelujah hallelujah and then he says move the stone see he tried their faith if you believe it everybody is watching you there's a crowd of people here and I'm trying your faith you say you believe you move the stone roll away the stone Hallelujah and by their Action Pro that they believe Lord Jesus Hallelujah now the work is up to God hallelujah when you show God you got Faith Hallelujah that's what pleased God and you can't him move the stone that's what I'm telling you this morning I don't care what your situation is hallelujah move that stone of unbel if you move the stone of unbel see the resurrection in your life will change the whole situation hallelujah hallelujah you say oh brother you know what we say Lord the situation is bad it stinks it's rotten how can I get out of this situation you understand me it's been there so long one thing you forget about Jesus he is a door and God Says with every Temptation God already made a way of Escape Hallelujah you just got to find the door and the Jesus Christ Hallelujah God don't care how stinking your your problem is God is able to resurrect it God is able to make your life new hallelujah hallelujah yes sir don't give up on God God won't give up on you thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah see the others they can be identified Hallelujah huj is that all right St John 84447 I'm going to read this because I don't want you to think I'm calling nobody a devil but I'm going let the script say hallelujah we're so busy don't worry it's in the word he called them to the wedding and yet they were so busy some just got Mar kind of stuff and they didn't even realize that in their actions they were rejecting the the the invitation what are you doing in our actions are we rejecting his invitation don't you understand God said to the highways and the byways I I go to the the scum of the Earth make sure my table is full Hallelujah that wasn't just for the Jews only hallelujah hallelujah ye are you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and not in the truth you hear that word he abold not in the truth abide in me and my word abide in you Hallelujah then you can ask what whatsoever you will Hallelujah because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speak of his own for he is a liar and the father of it let me tell you something about a lie if you continue to believe a lie it will become a strong delusion Hallelujah the Bible said because you don't have the love for the truth God strong delusion so so that you believe a lie Hallelujah and be damned by it hallelu so those people that's giv over to a strong delusion don't even know that they have been duped by the devil believe they believe that they have the truth but in order to fall into error you must first deny the truth hallelujah hallelujah 45th verse because I tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinc me of sin this what Jesus and if I say the truth why do you not believe me hallelujah hallelujah this Bible is right and what fault can you find in Jesus yall better hear what I'm saying then he's talking to you then why won't you believe it which of you can search these scriptures say Jesus Christ came short of being the Messiah he did that was WR and he did many things that is not written the Bible said he did so many things that it would take books Hallelujah you understand me so he G gives us a taste of it but every taste is true every bit of it is right I don't listen to say I understand everything would make me a liar but I believe everything I don't know how no's AR floated scientifically I don't know how Lazarus came up from the grave I don't even know how Jonah was swallowed by a way but I believe every bit of it hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how Hallelujah that man of the Old Testament was thrown in the grave of Elijah and the quicking power of Elijah bone brought him back to life I don't know how but I believe every bit of it I don't know how he turned water into wine somebody but I believe every bit of it hallelujah hallelujah yes sir I don't know how he chose Malachi but he did it any I don't know how how he chose me how he chose you I believe Hallelujah hallu yes sir because of Jesus Christ because he turned down the offer that Satan gave him it was a doorway for my life it was a doorway for your life come into Holiness come into sanctification come into justification it was God's way Hallelujah can you imagine if Jesus had taken the offer our entire life would have been different we would have been full of demons without no Deliverance hell would have been on Earth Hallelujah so here I'm going to say I got a quote for that but I'm going to read in the beginning of time when Jesus Christ or God began to make creatures he created angels but Angels were not Sons they were Spirits sarim uh you know cherubim and those angels that that fa now did you know Jesus God knew that that that these Angels were going to fall he needed them in that Fallen State Hallelujah y'all hear me so let me tell you what happened so when you're born in this this this world God permits a demon a fallen angel to come into your spirit you may not believe that but that's the true that's why when that baby lies is the demon that makes when that child steal it's a demon that makes that child you say what do you mean that's why that's why you got to be born again all of us we you know when we come to God we got devils we look at Mary Magdalene because she had seven Legion had a thousand and I wonder how many of us got more than Legion hallelujah hallelujah I'm just trying to tell you everybody born I got the word I got a I got a message every one of us this is the way the prophet says God permits that spirit he permits that Spirit to come on you Hallelujah you understand me if you didn't have that Spirit you would need sanctification hallelujah hallelujah you understand me but these demons that you have or Fallen Spirits must be taken out of you come on somebody and the only one who can do that Jesus Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah how many of times we we do things we don't want to doall and then whose will is that it surely is not your will because you're grieved in your heart about it and you say God I don't want to do that no more but you see you haven't met Jesus the way you need to meet him Hallelujah and the only way you going to get rid of those Spirit you got to shine the light on it you got to take the word let the word wash you clean that's the truth this is that very yes sir amen you know in some devils We inherited really every we God we inherited uh because because of the flesh Hallelujah but it's not that with in the spirit God is more concerned about he's concerned about that Soul because all of us the Bible says were born like the children of Wrath we all were born Sinners but in the soul God has a seed hallelujah oh come on somebody is that true because now remember the sour sold the good seed that was God sowing the seed but there was another man that came after him that was an evil man that was the devil come on somebody and he sold the seed too that's where Eve messed up up to that point the devil had no Avenue into the human race hallel but then he began he sold his seed too so it had to happen it had to happen that's why Jesus said Nicodemus everything You' done all your Works has been human effort Hallelujah you did because you knew how to do it and the law commanded you to do it but I've got a new law you must be born again Hallelujah that seed that I planted in you must be quick Hallelujah so that you can become the one and not the other y hear what I'm saying so that you can become the one and not the other Hallelujah Hallelujah and you ought to be tired of being the other when you got a way out you got a way out Hallelujah come unto me all you that are Laden and I will give you what for your soul that's right and Hebrew says hallelujah is that right we ought to labor to enter into his rest how do you labor how do you get a real Birth by way of prayer people say well I I got the Holy Ghost when I believe that's not the scripture the scripture says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe see because you believe that's good that's justification Hallelujah justification will bring you up that same Holy Ghost will bring you to sanctification hallel but all of us need to fire baptism hallelujah oh my right one or the other choose you this day serve hallelujah hallelujah now you watch them two seeds one fighting the evil trying to destroy the righteous SE and he tried to destroy Abel but God raised up SE to take he thought he had Jesus right there hallelujah hallelujah look down through the age he he every place he come heed that seed let me just stop there so do you think that you're going to live in Satan's Eden Satan is not fight you his whole purpose is to destroy the Royal Sea Hallelujah but the Bible says many are the Affliction of the righteous but God delivered them out of them all hallelu you you you God didn't say put on the whole arm of God because we're going to have a fashion show Hallelujah you put on the whole God because you got to fight people think being a Christian is easy a hard way if you real Christian hard way you walk the hard way you have a great portion of Heaven for you Hallelujah y'all look at me like that was just for the prophet no you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet you get Propet say explain that to me the land that Moses conquered the children of Israel partake of to the land that Joshua conquered Hallelujah they also partake in the land Hallelujah so much so so much so Caleb said give me my mountain Hallelujah I don't know how this going to be I I said to the Lord where however the the the terrain is whatever the terrain is in this world I I trust that you'll give me some land we got a mountain and some Rivers but I'll take whatever you give me y'all hear what I'm saying glory to God you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the truth the devil is always trying to Corner youall cornered understand God is already in the fire the truth they cornered amen the shra m in in the fire he was in the fire Hallelujah when they cored Daniel Hallelujah put him there with the l hallel you know God was there but you see that's the truth what it is we don't look for him you got to look for him he will appear to you he will show you he's never left you he said he promised it but if you don't believe it Satan will toss you to and fro but Jesus Promised I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I I believe that I believe that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah right oh my God and when he slew one or the other he thought he had that and finally he took out the John the Baptist finally cut his head off he thought he had in then but he found out he was over here in Jesus he slew all the babies I'm talking about the devil now I'm talking about the devil why do you think we've got a slaying of the babies this thing just stop the devil is trying to stop the Royal seed Hallelujah he he know God can't have a Rapture unless certain ones are there but just like God delivered all the others everybody is delivered from that system that's supposed to take a [Music] Rapture hallelujah hallelujah y'all looking at me I tell you what I hope you being blessed because you think God the devil just went after John the Baptist Jesus said if they did it in the green you know they going to do it in the dry how many y'all believe y'all Liv in the the prophet God said we going to have a squeeze and it's coming right now they're trying to get rid of the Bible so what you going to do about that not a thing you can do about it because they're going to do it is that true the American Constitution will be changed that's the word of the Lord that's all right the whole system will be changed Christianity will become the enemy to God we've been told Hallelujah there will come become a union of the churches the churches will unify but they don't know that's a trick of the devil hallelujah hallelujah they will be taking the mark of the beast y'all hear what I'm saying it's the truth but the Bride of Jesus Christ knows that her true Refuge is not in the church not in the organization true Refuge is in Jesus Christ Alone is that right the Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong power and the righteous running there in and they are saved Hallelujah you're saved In the Arms of Jesus Hallelujah glory to God now it's it's a crazy thing when you run into the City of Refuge I'm have to when you run into the City of Refuge that means when you go in there you you got to make a confession to the elders that you didn't mean to do wrong but you know if they find out that you made a lie they will put you out and now you are at the hands of your enemy Hallelujah but as long as you be truthful in there as long as you you you you appreciate the safety you can stay there forever Hallelujah and that was just a shout out type in the Old Testament hallelujah hallelujah so when you come to Jesus Christ you better stay there Hallelujah cuz whether you realize it or not you have a enemy waiting on you hallelujah hallelujah have you ever seen backsliders when they go out how the devil beat them to Pieces make them do things they never thought they would do Hallelujah yeah and it's all because they left the place refug and if You' left the place of your Refuge morning you need to come back to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah let me let me move on and Moses he tried to kill Moses he tried he tried every way he could to destroy that seed and when he killed Christ at Calvary but God raised him up again the third day right and then he sent the Holy Ghost back to call Sons and Daughters of God and that same religious seed is persecuting the righteous seed yet today you see they're trying to destroy that righteous branch of God all over sees people are hiding their Christianity so they can live China all those communist countries you can't just be a Christian in the lands of Muslims and you Christian I mean they kill you y understand me I think we're behind time here in America but we're moving right into that same what are you going to do if you don't have enough God in you to resist the devil with love Hallelujah right oh I got my gun I got my gun they come to my house they going well that ain't the way the early church did it I'm just saying well I got a right I thought you fored all your rights when you came I thought you was a lamb Hallelujah I I I wouldn't want to kill nobody let them kill me CU I'm safe see if you're not afraid of death you don't worry about do die is that the truth Peter said I'm going Lord I'm going and God said no no no you can't go you got to turn around you got to be crucified and then when they took Peter and they were going to crucify like Peter said Lord I'm not worthy crucify me upside down Paul Paul when he knew he was going to n understand he understood he couldn't die y say well I don't want no pain you don't want the Rapture either because the Rapture will be a sharp pain when you change from Mortal to immortality you will feel a sharp pain every birth is a pain y'all love the Lord I'm almost done I'm I'm I'm I'm sorry uh I've been so long but let me let me let me get down to where I want to go because that same evil is here hallelujah see now let let me say this if you are Abraham's seed you have the same faith that Abraham let's stop there because that's not because you say you have it that faith is action Hallelujah is an action word Abraham believed God the Bible said he staggered not the promises of God hallelujah hallelujah Abraham knew that God would perform everything he had promised hallelujah hallelujah and the only way you can have Abraham Faith to have the Christ which is the Holy Ghost in you because it is his faith and the Bible said the just shall live by I'm especially in the church it's the Royal Seed of Abraham there are two seeds of Abraham one of them was the natural seed and the other one was Christ The Promise so through Isaac Israel was blessed through Christ he become the father of Nations so the Royal seed much greater than what we be than the natural Seed of Abraham how much greater excuse me so if you are in Christ you have a sued a super of what Abraham was because you come by the Roy you see Christ I'm talking about I'm not talking about a watered down Holy Ghost water down holy ghost that only knows about entertainment I'm talking about the real Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost they had on the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost that fell on theu street and brought a worldwide Revival hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking about the same holy ghost that not only changes a man heart changes way thinking changes way of living changes everything about him Hallelujah till he or she becomes a onean army Hallelujah the very the Holy Ghost where the very omnipotent of God lives in the heart of men hallelujah what are you going to be one or the other I'm hallelujah hallelujah what are you going to be one or the other remember God chose Samuel and and Samuel had to go anoint Saul who was the People's Choice hallelujah hallelujah but Saul was carnal hallah even though God anointed him anointed him with a cruise of oil Hallelujah but David was anointed with a horn of all uh um horn and that that horn that oil is it it uh Hallelujah was poured onto David's head and it ran all the way down the Garment and all the way down to se that means the anointing of God everything of you everything you possess anoint your eyes your mouth your lips your ears everything everything anointed by God hallelujah hallelujah and what did Saul do God disappointed God he disobeyed God when God told him to kill the AM AMC kill the Sheep the goat everything he why the children because if a snake have a snake snake and God knew that all right Hallelujah see the world say he was cruel no no sir and if you let one live it's going come back to bite you is that right you destroy the demon the demon destroys you closing I'm closing because Saul was given a strong delusion knew he L people save the king Save the King give God the choice animals God didn't tell him to do that God through Samuel say kill everything and because of Saul Disobedience he lost his kingship he lost his in the battle Jonathan and others yall understand me because he believed one line one line of dece and this is where the devil is fighting a lot of you all because I believe God's in the prophet I'm in the M no you're not you're not in the message until you get the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is message Hallelujah one or the other that bad nature that you've been born with it has to die and rock in order for God to live Hallelujah you got to be done with the Demons of Hell In order to get the Holy Ghost you understand me one lie I got more but I tell you what one lie if not corrected becomes more lies right and that's the way it always works you tell a lie you don't correct it you got to tell another lie and all of a sudden a demon of delusion is now covering your faith and you think you're right you think you're right how do you think the world is in the condition is is they rejected the truth they reject the truth man and woman ain't number two genders man and woman man and woman y'all looking at me like crazy amen the word right but they rejected the truth this is why they believe the lie more than one gender like I tried to tell y'all people waking up I think thinking they're cats some people think they're dogs Hallelujah I don't understand it but they don't love the truth and y'all say well that can't happen to me oh my I hope not let's stand understand that God is all about truth we must stand on truth I don't care if it hurts us if everybody hates you separates themselves from you you stand on the truth you think about that mega church Jesus had Serv 5000 3,00 and then at the crucifixion there was nobody to be found and that was John who typed the bride he was the only one that didn't run Hallelujah yall understand me the Bride of Jesus Christ will never run from the persecution let's pray our gracious father we thank you for your grace and we thank you for being so good to us Lord we want to be that one not the other Lord We
