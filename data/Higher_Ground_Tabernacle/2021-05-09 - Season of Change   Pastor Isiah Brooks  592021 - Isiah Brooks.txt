my way every day [Music] oh let me go all the while with a song and a smile filled my way every day with love [Music] would like to give a testimony good morning everybody so i just want to come up here and uh tell you guys about my story about what i went through and if you can bear with me i'm not good at speaking from people um so about i say six months ago i'll be dealing with my health i was very sick i had to go to the hospital to get some treatment they found out that i had a tumor on my arm and i need to get it more removed so we started i started taking some treatment at the hospital and hoped hoping that everything would go fine but i took some treatments for i think three months but what happened is that the treatment did not respond to the treatment but i want to thank the lawful brother keith but isaac and sister for my for being there with me through the whole process um i really use brothers keep faith to encourage me to go through this whole thing so the uh the day before the surgery i sat down with uh with the surgeon we talked about how the whole process will look and he can explain to me how it would be difficult to do the procedure without damaging any nerves on my arm but we prayed my whole family prayed with me and we i trust the lord that he will do me a miracle the doctor was saying it's almost impossible to do the procedure without damaging any nerves on my arm and and but we told him that he this would be his first miracle he ever saw so the day came before the surgery i said there was a table getting ready to go to the operation room he came there ready he told me that actually he can do the procedure without touching any nerves he apparently found out that he can do the whole procedure without having to do much damage on my arm so that was the first proof i had um when i was sitting there at the table i just had that kind of feeling of peaceful in my heart because i knew that i wouldn't do i couldn't do anything to change the situation i played i prayed the night before my whole family my sister and brother prayed for me and so i was sitting there just you know having my whole faith in god because i couldn't do anything on that case so i was just you know very happy to see the first proof before i went to the uh if i want to sleep so yeah so we went to the uh i went inside the room he did uh he performed the surgery i think it took about about four for uh four hours to the whole procedure and when he finished here he came to my dad and told him that was a very successful surgery he ever had and apparently everything worked out fine he wasn't what he thought was so so the mri and the ct shows was showing that he couldn't do the surgery but when he went there he couldn't find any of the inconvenient that was there um so i was very blessed to uh to um to um i i say i was very blessed to uh just i'm counting this miracle to just have this miracle in my life to just have this proof i can tell people that god do miracle i don't believe in god of stories and history i know there's a guy that can do miracles in any circumstance this whole story has taught me some very strong lesson changed my character increased my faith in god and i'm just very glad that i actually benefit from this whole situation so i want to praise the lord for my healing and foreign thank you command we thank the lord for hitting our brother and we know we serve a miracle worker god demand let's sing this song what a mighty god we serve amen i will enter his gate with thanksgiving in my heart amen i will enter his

the mix-up i didn't know there had been a change lately has been a lot of changes lately let us go to hebrews 13. from there we'll go to genesis 1. i'm sorry james 1 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever let's go to james 1. glad to have everybody here tonight i do apologize i intended to have communion and i totally it totally slipped my mind to announce it so we will have to do it at another time by god's grace the 17th and 18th verse of james jackson every good and perfect every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of light with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning our final scripture reading coming from genesis the third chapter and then we'll let you be seated now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea have god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye should not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest she die for god does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil connoisseurs and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to be made one wise to make she's desire to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat thank you sir agreeable and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made them say sales aprons let us pray dear heavenly father head and lord of my life we come clothed in humility lord to say lord god there is nothing we can do this morning but through and by your leadership something can be done and we prayed this morning that you would lead us and guide us say those things that your bride need today and this is what we're asking you for lord it's a scrutiny this is a new day a new beginning trusting you you know feed our souls to enlighten us in your word today in jesus christ's name we pray be merciful to us amen amen you may be seated on yesterday i was thinking how happy and how glad i am to be a christian and things that are taking place in the world i'm kind of like peter compiere silver and gold have i not done but i do have something hallelujah and such as i have a give id what we what would we have what we have would we have done faith had not god sent us a prophet a word of insight a word of prophecy of the prophecy a word that will give us vision on where we are in this day you know brother branham said that the true bride of jesus christ she knows her day she is aware of her time god has quickened her life when everybody else seemed to be in an illusion she is walking in reality she knows where she's come from and she knows where she's going she have confidence in her husband she has confidence in her redeemer and she knows that her redeemer is her husband we're living in a time of headship not a man handled gospel but a gospel that is controlled by god himself hallelujah we have become we have gone beyond udila touch not taste now and where the spirit of the lord is hallelujah season of change this season it's a subject this morning things must change hallelujah uh i was listening to the message god's only uh provided place of worship in 1965 and that that tape is so powerful it takes you from a to z hallelujah it lets you know that the way people worship yesterday before today [Applause] their judgment is blind somebody help me here and if you're blind you cannot see should i significa those of us who that we did not come here by chance let me say it again you did not come here about by chance you know one of the things that uh i've experienced in life uh and and that is i i used to go to the movies and uh you know i hated to be late because if you came late especially if it was your first time uh to see this movie and a lot of times people think it's the ending that's the most important thing it's the beginning because if you from the beginning now this is a time of change it's something that that is obvious that is not the same as it was before some changes are good yeah some changes are evil yeah most people don't like change the people have these running positions more especially when it's not beneficial most people love their comfort zones but god has never given you a comfort zone as such there is only only one comfort zone yeah that comfort zone is in christ we know that god cannot change the journey about that you ever had friends that know they change on you it's a hurting thing to see that your friend has changed i've got a friend that will never change me the bible says that he's the same yesterday today so you because god can't make hallelujah so if god chose you is he jewish to be bride there is nothing that can change his it's not about what you think about god listened to brother ben last night ben yeah in iowa city i was tv he made a good point he said there's people who could be blessed there are blessings but he wasn't amen because a lot of times people think material things the jeans materials he knows that you are blessed did not close that material things are blessings materials but in order to be blessed you have to come from god [Music] [Music] hallelujah now had it been us had had the changes being determined been determined by us y'all understand me god gave just for an example and then i'll move on like zombie god gave peter the keys it was afterwards peter denied jesus three times but the thing that i love about god excuse me uh even with your actions the master prophet was like hallelujah the bible even tells us that god does not judge us according to our sins [Music] is so let me go to my subject now there in the book of genesis don't redeem us it's where it starts and god determined within himself he was going to make a man in his own image he'd formulate a norm as a sony manager and likeness i like to say yes and he made adam adam and we understand the story all of the other animals have been created man was the crown of his creations but adam was the only one that was lonely and the reason being there was no help me for adam i don't know but mr bear had mrs bear mr uh lulu madame lulu and and perhaps some cubs some little cubs little bears hallelujah but here was adam he he was given an order and he god told and this is the purpose now i'm bringing you to the purpose of the objective the purpose of adam and eve the objective that don't ever was to bring forth of his kind it did reproduce oh it is up to you for the serpent immediately but you ever did did it ever come to your mind there may have been a reason for that hallelujah hey she have seen things because you know they walked in the cool of the evening god had made them king and queen over a he with the serpent introducing his way up until then god was in complete control god always is in control on plane controller but he gave mankind volunteering he gave mankind a will especially but the animals had no will melisani hallelujah so he made mankind in a way especially make his own chooses our own choices this is why he could not make adam and eve in the way he made the other animals the memphis people needed if you don't believe that listen to serpents each hallelujah even though god put it out there in memphis somebody helped me here but one of the things she did man that satan was so smart tricked her like pretty he deceived her he made a true statement though you do this that's the situation you will become as gods what was it that she did and whatever what was it that he did that made him like god would become jew he chose to do his will y'all hear me he chose to do his will again it was the will of adam and eve that don't ever to produce children the the drill doesn't fall without the instructions of god they were predestinated is it difficult he said god would tell them to have children [Music] of all the animals do this anymore can mate at any time amen can mate at any time [Music] i'm gonna admit it myself [Music] because of the sexual sin across the species six well he began to multiply now god told them to multiply they were multiplying according to their own will meant to know will hit me because in his will he wanted to super exceed the pacific god's will i'm bringing it to you whatever things according to your own will give this a 5 000. trust in the lord confirm lean not on on your own understanding in [Music] the thing that i love about it from that garden of gethsemane don't lose which was a type of the garden of eden hallelujah that is where he says he showed where the problem was it's not my will be done you see what i'm saying the first sin came in the garden and the restoration [Music] [Music] calvary and this is not in my notes but calvary is a very important thing because it was important and i was letting him know that i think it's longitude i always get them mixed up longitude and latitude is the one that goes this way but anyhow there's a sister yeah her name was georgia johnson johnson and she had taken a picture oh it's sunset mountains came down to my denounce that three crosses were cobbed out of that mountain how many of y'all knew that what quantity for me three crosses were carved into the stone into and those pyramid rocks came out of the carvings this is for me and she showed me a picture of calvary and a picture she had taken there sunset mountain sunset and you i could not tell them apart as the east it come leicester to the west west yesterday the day and forever there on calvary it was the blood but there looking behind you look out there the the the the the uh the the picture of brother branham profile that's the word brother brown i'm in the stone this message and because of the blasting of the road yeah there were some cave ends so i had to squeeze myself down into this cage and i'm thinking is that was the table he talked about yeah [Laughter] because when you first come to the message but to me that was a bonus because so many people wanted to go into that cave hallelujah peregrine found out where it was [Music] oh man is that wyoming where the mountains are uh out there west wyoming we are the montana those seven peaks where is that can y'all remember montana montana there was the profile of william brown into the in into the atmosphere no come home folks i'm not preaching there was three witnesses that i've seen yeah hallelujah whether you believe it or not i was on the floor nobody can deter me i believe everything that's been preached so that will that will get you in trouble is that true it's amazing because when you get married they say where are you oh yes i will together jesus help me lord now if god has such a ceremony let me hurry up so the purpose of adam and eve was to replenish the earth objective have you ever thought about it why was kane so upset it had to be more division but i'm going to tell you something what god did there measure when he accepted abel's sacrifice accepted the sacrifice he was identifying abel's sacrifice was revealed it was revealed to kane that he didn't have the right bloodline so he got angry and you said well brothers where you get that from don't you worry about it just think about it and ask the lord about it because even now kane gets very angry when he realizes he doesn't have the bloodline [Music] hallelujah amen it's the same way today as it was yesterday god cannot change it god did not i did if i came yes it is he identified judas again he said the one who sucked with me hallelujah right see so don't tell me god does not identify the serpent pakistan [Music] he's the same yesterday today go ahead and preach because she's reading this no stop it so here it is oh what see the bloodline like we're so important god separated [Music] is and he was the first of all the beast and the only of all the beasts that hybrid by his own will he brought in another creation y'all understand me and this yes you see you say oh oh what nothing with that yes it was oh we said this because you got to understand you had two bloodlines that you had behave bloodline [Music] and then then then kane brought a change and he thought because i killed abel like the devil thought once i killed jesus but they did not know made news of him my god [Applause] and once you understand how how how men work and how we think possibly with our thinking a lot more in the scriptures and when he was here really the rapture could have taken place a little longer bishop i see but what it was it wasn't the season yet oh city poncho think about all of the miracles that william branham uh god used him to to perform [Music] and so we thought he was going to come like our brother said in the 80s [Music] hallelujah for the change that we're looking for the songs i don't know what i'm saying so you say well what do you mean brother what are you saying yes she said when the seers were opened it brought us to a change when jesus christ was identified by john people not follow jesus continue [Music] zebras aren't done ah that's not god god don't need us you don't need a thrill emotion doesn't have a feeling y'all better hear what i'm saying it comes from the soul really in the word of god hallelujah amen isn't that okay so god created adam and eve in the in the image i've got to jump because i want to show you what high breeding two of the beasts did through the world in chaos you know a lot of times people think that those people were you know like caveman in a club of some sort because but these people were highly intelligent coming from the fall they were their brains were working far better than ours they were able uh mathematically whatever the hybriding did it created destruction by way of the intellectuals it was cain's offspring where are you coming from because the bible said is [Music] [Music] [Music] very fair is it like correct hallelujah yeah yeah and guess what if it was cane seeds who started the polygamy polygamy well some people say i'm too soft so i'm not being soft this morning he created adam and eve luckily i don't ever it wasn't two women only one god don't have two brides only ones hallelujah we gotta realize by god's grace he cannot change same thing moved into and even though the bill of divorcement remember the divorce moses gave it to them because of the hardness of their hearts that means their hearts were so hard so that's if you don't do it the right way anyhow hallelujah and so he gave them the bill of divorce so did the evil because they were genetically altering things maybe i'm wrong but as it was in that day that comes to this so is it in this day no new thing under the sun is and you got to understand that it's all because somebody exerted their will over god's will see what i'm saying that he thought he had done the will of god you got to get rid of all of them demons all the demons y'all don't think y'all you know that's the thing we're in the message god gonna let us do anything we want to driven you can't take a page out of this book every word of this book is right that if you die bad if [Music] i don't know if you're tired or you're just not getting it but specifically you're agreeing maybe you're not agreeing but the whole point is man your point i'm trying to get to your will and you can be you can wield or listen or will shut your your ears remember they didn't want to hear the prophet they shot their ears and ran to kill him so you got to understand so what happened here brother and we know these things adam and eve forfeited their rights i don't ever satan that's why his children prosper from prosperity and he did just like jesus said if you bow down to me that justice just give you everything now i want you to see what i'm saying because never in any other age they are acknowledging that satan is the god of this world and what is it is it because of the change acoustic we didn't know the change was coming to us that the world war one i believe in those demons when the lid of hell was taken up [Music] this this great tribulation this is i'm saying this you see that bloodline is important and the woman's seed that's that scripture there you want to see this somebody help me here and that cannot change it'll never vanish if i see you go through eternity [Music] we come to celebrate the victory when that lamb took that book thus you said that you have a lever and those seals were open you could say soybeans [Music] [Music] [Music] and this kingdom it's wyoming let the stones come out kingdom cannot be moved to wyoming [Music] of god [Music] yeah here comes the world like the last round now here come the dummy one last runner nobody's looking yet because that last runners [Music] oh the bloodline that's what people don't understand oh i used to love when they sing that song you can't cross the bloodline yeah sure amen you see the devil didn't understand the bible says happy birthday and i'm almost done cause i'm just jumping i should continue you know he she messed it up but then again you and i became like gods god allowed that to happen like and if god has chosen you see he don't you know dub don't choose a crow or a robin well a dog in columbus guess why in colombo they make a life and he said but when hallelujah what mistakes did you make okay i haven't done this thing so well chosen and i have covered you with the blood and there there's not a stain [Music] is [Music] jesus christ say y'all crazy over there believing in the prophets hallelujah we know who sentences you understand me man only the blood lies sir [Music] the garden hallelujah and cain got upset and destroyed it in the back of god's mind there was coming a resurrection because these men began to call upon the name of the lord law you know the jews you gotta understand the seven church ages they're dead so because they're dead we have a resurrection hallelujah what do you mean that's how we [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah but there's coming another outpouring [Music] he said god you know what to say hallelujah he said speak to those dry bones is he palace is a sick thing brother brandon was speaking to uh you know pentecost hadn't lost the battle come on when we called when we got this message we was like dry bones speak to him listening to the tapes listen to the creature all of a sudden i told somebody the other day i kept trying i said once a woman when she started having babies a different way that's when we get the holy ghost a different way you're signing work in this why because that's not god provided ways and every mama knows the babies cry you know when they cry if they cry they got a different if they wet they got a different cry he's on now the only man knows that when they're hungry they have a different crowd hallelujah when they want to be held they have a different crowd that's all they know how to do is [Music] [Music] you know what that's the thing about it so you see that shows like when you do get the holy ghost is [Music] and i have to say you're a liar god my brother hallelujah i'm not going to disappoint him dude i'm not going to disappoint him i know i i know i tie the words together oh my god how many of y'all have an apartment one of the things i heard brother adam talk about only a tape the other day which really stuck you understand me because if there is any darkness in me she has no malice an envy or strife in her heart hallelujah but just a little bit of leveling a little bit of something can keep you from rising because i want you to realize that this is a this is a changing time follow the message have changed just changing things that would never think people would do that once walking this message is doing it you know yesterday was it yesterday i don't have youtube anymore but i wanted to hear some little gospel music and they had this girl called fantasia or something like that you know she's singing the song lord i know i've been changed the angels in heaven done sign my name i'm like yeah what they don't understand is that there's anger from heaven of god so whatever angel signed her name it wasn't the one that came from god i'm not saying she can't be changed you know i ain't going through the whole thing but she she had on a outfit 11 uh vic more that look made her look like a major rat you don't know what a major a major ad y'all don't know what i mean the ones that do with the batons that walk before the that's naked they naked and they ah okay you know you get the you get the uh i don't know how y'all do it in africa but up here there's naked wow you see it's on you she was naked and i thought is this gospel it was packed y'all understand me see i'm saying all this to say when brother adam saw miss america naked he was right on target i come from the old school was here this morning i started to take him back but he said one thing yesterday and you know what if some people were following they were flocking on that and i thought to myself when when i saw that girl i said oh i just said god forgot i wasn't long just i wasn't long i wasn't standing i was disgusted i was now she's only me i'm trying to win them over to the law she said you know what apostolic is holiness that that i would say to the message that shows that people might be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we did believe in speaking in tongues that's the evidence it looks so much like the message amen and to see this girl like that and people were flocking to it was your song so they had these in this apostolic church they they were they were singing it's the first time i ever seen women come to church with biker pants i don't know what biker pants these are real tight things that you know right here real tight they like underwear so come this way that don't fit [Music] bring your mind back now but the point is the point is the point they were they were moving we're going to walk like jesus and they turn around you know jesus walk jesus walk and them bishops was walking with him it should be shuffled they thought i was a prophet i was so i was so fired up and i turned around now i'm under the holy spirit [Applause] you know you can't be red-blooded man and watch these sisters do that and not feel something um where they were with me they huddled after service they huddled you know when they huddled they talking about you assembly but i didn't care maybe because i said your blood will not be on me you're not going to feel you if you left behind you see you're going to stick to the point worse than anybody else [Music] to try to please god voices i'm telling you hey i know one thing as you're seeing chosen you better make sure that the holy ghost you got is the real one i feel like i just jumped everywhere but i i was trying to show you today and
