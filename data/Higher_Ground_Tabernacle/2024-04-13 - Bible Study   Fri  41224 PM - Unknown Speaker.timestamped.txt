[0:00] we thank you for the reading of your
[0:01] word we pray father God tonight uh for
[0:04] those who are here Lord God that you
[0:06] would bless them we pray that you would
[0:09] open our heart open the scripture to us
[0:11] Lord that we may see um Lord where we
[0:15] stand in this day and see Jeremiah
[0:18] though it be in the Old Testament that a
[0:20] lot of these things that he's referring
[0:22] to uh is a picture or a painting of our
[0:26] day bless us now Lord draw us nearer
[0:30] and and and Lord we pray that you would
[0:32] count us worthy to escape the wrath that
[0:35] is to come in Jesus Christ's name we
[0:38] pray amen you may be seated if you like
[0:42] I'm going tell you by the grace of God
[0:44] we we've come this far by faith uh when
[0:48] we see uh all that uh God is doing and
[0:51] has done uh we see the world falling
[0:54] apart right before us we very
[0:58] uh uh things that that people or
[1:01] churches uh of the world that we call
[1:04] Christian churches uh have uh caused a a
[1:08] mighty shame and and reproach on on the
[1:11] name of Jesus Christ um I I've got uh of
[1:16] course as a subject we know that uh what
[1:19] the meaning of Jeremiah means it means
[1:21] appointed by God or God is
[1:25] high yes and in my in my uh thought
[1:30] tonight I want to kind of like bring a
[1:32] little secondary thought this is the
[1:34] season of the end and you'll understand
[1:37] by this uh what I mean by this in a in a
[1:40] in a little bit through the lesson we
[1:43] know that Israel is now backsliding I
[1:47] mean you know and God is doing
[1:48] everything to woo her back matter of
[1:51] fact he the Bible said God chasen Those
[1:54] whom he love and so even in God
[1:56] chastisement he would raise up uh
[1:59] different Nations to come against Israel
[2:02] uh bringing them to a place that they
[2:05] would repent but instead of repenting we
[2:08] found out that Israel would even get uh
[2:11] more hardened in their heart and in
[2:13] their ways there would be they were a
[2:15] rebellious nation and that's basically
[2:17] what God told Jeremiah that I've got you
[2:20] preaching uh to a rebellious nation and
[2:23] really nobody's going to hear what you
[2:26] have to say because basically they've
[2:28] crossed the line
[2:30] but being a just God God is is always a
[2:33] god of mercy God is a always a god of
[2:37] Grace and uh you know as I hear Brother
[2:40] Rich say often time you know uh God will
[2:44] forgive you of even blasphemy except
[2:47] blasphemy against the Holy Ghost uh how
[2:50] many times you know even ourselves in
[2:53] our day when we weren't even Christians
[2:55] or we made statements that that would
[2:59] have really sent us to hell if we
[3:01] understood what we saying but I'll tell
[3:03] you like this God always protects his
[3:06] own so Israel now is is in a and this is
[3:10] just the beginning of the statement of
[3:12] of the chapter but the thing that I have
[3:15] seen is that in all of the Judgment that
[3:18] God is going to bring on Israel Judah
[3:21] and Jerusalem you can see the grace you
[3:25] can see the
[3:26] compassion you can see how God is always
[3:29] reaching out trying to bring them back
[3:33] and it's amazing because God knows all
[3:35] things but he knows that when a person
[3:38] comes to a certain place let's say it
[3:40] like this the Lord knoweth them that are
[3:43] his and and and and Israel had gotten so
[3:47] bad uh in in their behavior they were
[3:50] actually worse than the uh neighboring
[3:53] countries and the filth and the things
[3:55] that they were doing uh because they had
[3:57] the law they had the word they knew
[4:00] better uh but they Rebel you know what I
[4:03] mean they they rebell against God
[4:06] Nations who didn't know God that's what
[4:09] they did uh but those who when you know
[4:13] the truth and do it is not to to to you
[4:15] it have sin so we know in the 14th verse
[4:20] of the same
[4:22] chapter he says turn oh backsliding
[4:25] children said the Lord for I am what
[4:28] married
[4:30] unto you and I will take you one of a
[4:33] city and two of a family and I will
[4:36] bring you to Zion it almost sound like
[4:39] what God is saying you know in the New
[4:41] Testament when it comes to the Rapture
[4:44] there'll be two in the field one would
[4:45] be taken two on the mountain how you you
[4:48] know how it goes and and and two in the
[4:50] bed and one would be but and you see how
[4:54] God is saying listen I know it's only a
[4:57] few of you left but if I can get you to
[5:00] repent if I can get you to repent I I I
[5:03] will I will I will honor your repentance
[5:05] and I will give unto you pastors
[5:08] according to mine heart which shall feed
[5:11] you with knowledge and understanding so
[5:14] the
[5:15] corruption uh that was in Israel uh
[5:18] wasn't just with the Ley it was with the
[5:21] priesthood as well they were Wicked they
[5:24] were they were they used the people they
[5:27] abused the people they lied to the
[5:29] people people uh even the prophets
[5:31] socalled prophesied lies and all of this
[5:34] was for monetary gain and political gain
[5:38] and here was God trying to snatch his
[5:41] people out of a
[5:44] hole a
[5:46] ditch uh a tunnel in which they have
[5:49] been entrapped in uh but we find out
[5:52] that uh as as as much as Jeremiah
[5:55] preached uh things got even worse and
[6:00] and you know we say well I know we've
[6:02] read the Bible uh and and we've seen
[6:05] glorious stories about uh uh uh uh uh
[6:10] how God um hardened Pharaoh's heart we
[6:13] were just talking about that brother
[6:14] Josh and I but let me tell you something
[6:16] when it comes to a Christian when God
[6:20] continues to warn you when God continues
[6:23] to try to Woo You When God continues try
[6:26] to correct you that's when he sees that
[6:29] you're not going to do and and and now
[6:33] understand what I mean what I'm saying
[6:35] because he'll give you over to a repeate
[6:38] mind now if you seed of God that's not
[6:43] possible but we know that the seed that
[6:46] is not of God will always take things to
[6:50] the extreme but because they say they
[6:52] are the children of God they must be
[6:54] judged by the word just like the
[6:57] children of God you see
[7:00] uh god reigns on the just and the unjust
[7:03] and the word of God comes in the in in
[7:06] in in every hour to separate the wheat
[7:09] from the tear and so I want to encourage
[7:11] you tonight because it doesn't matter if
[7:14] 90% of this assembly go
[7:18] bad that has nothing to do with you you
[7:22] got to know who you
[7:25] are right and and and when God speaks to
[7:29] you
[7:31] you receive it and if it calls for
[7:34] repentance you
[7:36] repent you know whatever it takes to
[7:39] make it identify yourself as a sheep of
[7:42] God and not a goat cuz you know the
[7:46] world is now identifying themselves as
[7:49] goat that's and if there is a goat there
[7:52] must be a sheep
[7:53] somewhere right so Jeremiah it said
[7:57] listen I will give you Pastor according
[8:00] to thine heart that means amen that that
[8:03] that you struggle you're going through a
[8:05] lot of things but you want somebody
[8:08] that's going to preach the word of God
[8:09] to you and they are going to have
[8:12] connection with God because a lot of the
[8:14] preachers or a lot of the pastors when
[8:16] reading Jeremiah you find out that they
[8:19] say they knew God and they didn't know
[8:22] him right they were Liars but God
[8:26] promised amen that if you would repent
[8:29] and really have a desire to serve him he
[8:32] will give you a pastor after his
[8:35] heart and and I trust I'm one of them
[8:39] Jeremiah 4 please we're going to jump a
[8:41] little bit so that's just the essence of
[8:44] things I I'm trying to highlight things
[8:47] because it just continue to go on and on
[8:49] and on but but know by the grace of God
[8:52] that uh God has always said he's never
[8:56] left himself without a witness there's
[8:59] always always a Remnant
[9:01] somewhere that God will will save in the
[9:06] midst of
[9:07] chaos uh yeah because remember even in
[9:10] our day uh uh the moon uh the in in the
[9:15] eclipse went completely black but then
[9:17] there was a little Grace placed in there
[9:21] now it says Jeremiah the fourth chapter
[9:24] third verse and I'm trusting that all of
[9:27] you have been reading but cuz I'm just
[9:30] going to try to highlight the things
[9:31] that that Drew my drew me in my
[9:36] attention for thus said the Lord to the
[9:39] men of Judah and Jerusalem break up your
[9:44] fow
[9:45] ground and soow not among
[9:49] Thorns what he saying you allowed your
[9:53] heart to become
[9:55] hardened and God's seed can't won't
[9:58] penetrate the hardness of the heart the
[10:02] heart must be broken in other words
[10:06] repent am see
[10:09] brokenhearted God God God will will work
[10:13] with that right a contrite spirit that's
[10:16] what God loves but when your heart is
[10:19] hardened and and no man can see it like
[10:22] the preacher when the preacher is
[10:24] preaching he you know he he has a a
[10:27] extra sense that comes in and he can see
[10:30] those who are receiving and those who
[10:32] are not uh but he has to go on because
[10:35] he knows that every message when it goes
[10:38] out it never goes out
[10:41] void now look at what what what what
[10:44] Nehemiah had to do he he went through
[10:47] all of that suffering you know make me
[10:49] feel like a
[10:51] wimp when I see what Nehemiah had to go
[10:55] through this is not even I mean Jeremiah
[10:58] I keep saying I switch him up like that
[11:01] I don't mean I'm glad you know
[11:03] Jeremiah I don't know how many times I
[11:05] said Nehemiah but y'all know I mean
[11:08] Jeremiah and Jeremiah had to go through
[11:10] so much I trust my son my grandson is
[11:13] okay because I did this the last
[11:15] time uh so so when when it comes to uh
[11:20] Jeremiah he went and and and historic
[11:24] historians uh and theologians labor him
[11:28] as the in the weeping
[11:31] prophet because Jeremiah wasn't one who
[11:34] was just bringing judgment he cared this
[11:38] was his people this was his
[11:41] family right so I'm telling you like
[11:45] this because when brother Brandon went
[11:47] off to scene I'm I'm just throwing this
[11:49] in and according to Revelations uh 10
[11:54] the Bible tells us that we must prophesy
[11:57] again like the very m message he
[12:00] preached we must come along and preach
[12:02] the same thing and the Very compassion
[12:06] he had for people we supposed to have
[12:09] that compassion am it's not just we
[12:13] we're better than you and we got more
[12:14] Revelation and all of these things that
[12:17] that put you in in opposition to God
[12:21] because God hates a proud
[12:23] Spirit but he loves that humble and
[12:26] contrite heart this is what NE I I mean
[12:30] Jeremiah uh kept
[12:32] saying he he he was just he knew his
[12:35] mission he didn't even want to do
[12:38] it he tried to get out of
[12:42] it even when God called me he says Lord
[12:45] how can I do this I'm just but a
[12:47] child and God says no no no no don't say
[12:50] that because I'm the one it's not you
[12:54] Jeremiah that's doing the work I'm just
[12:56] using your
[12:57] body right and
[12:59] understand Jeremiah I ordain you I made
[13:04] you to be this I fashion you in your
[13:08] mother's womb amen before you even born
[13:11] I knew you now let me bring it to us if
[13:15] God did Jeremiah that way he had to do
[13:18] his bride the same way every son and
[13:22] daughter of God has been particularly
[13:25] fashioned and made in a special way way
[13:29] Amen to do what a special
[13:32] job this is why we call a special people
[13:36] a special class of people because we
[13:39] said oh wow it looked like the Min the
[13:41] ministry hasn't even started yet when it
[13:44] comes to the bride y'all understand what
[13:46] I mean by that listen Jesus preached
[13:50] three and a half years but the greatest
[13:53] part of his ministry was at the end of
[13:57] it he did miracles he did signs he did
[14:01] wonders but when he showed himself to be
[14:04] the
[14:05] resurrection you understand me that was
[14:07] the highlight of all his
[14:10] ministry and that's where God is
[14:12] bringing us to to show his resurrection
[14:16] through us that be the height of this
[14:20] whole church age for the the the make
[14:24] believer the believer The Sinner all
[14:28] will see that Jesus Christ is alive and
[14:32] he's the same yesterday today and
[14:34] forever and that he's living in human
[14:38] vessels and we are the chosen
[14:41] ones I have been praying and here here
[14:44] I'm going read this fourth verse here I
[14:46] have been praying Lord circumcise
[14:50] me whatever is not supposed to be
[14:53] circumcised me Hallelujah listen what he
[14:58] says circum ize yourself to the Lord and
[15:02] take away the foreskin of your heart ye
[15:06] men of Judah and the inhabitants of
[15:10] Jerusalem lest my Fury come forth like
[15:13] fire and burn that none can quench it
[15:17] because of the evil of your doings what
[15:20] is he saying he's basically saying
[15:23] repent and humble yourself so that God
[15:27] can fill you with the Holy Ghost
[15:30] basically the Wrath is coming there's
[15:32] nothing that can turn it away because
[15:35] mankind is already crossed the line
[15:38] there is no Revival for America she
[15:41] spewed away her day of Grace right so
[15:45] you said what about all the other
[15:47] countries they did that long time ago
[15:50] because before the gospel could actually
[15:52] come to America it had to go from the
[15:55] East to the west and every watch brother
[15:58] say Germany to turned it down I mean he
[16:01] goes through all those countries and
[16:03] show how they turned down the movement
[16:05] of God but the last place to turn it
[16:08] down was us amen now we're at the
[16:14] end
[16:16] yeah we're at the end it doesn't mean I
[16:20] know what brother Brown said he said now
[16:22] that move he said that that sun is left
[16:24] the west coast and it has to go back to
[16:26] the east yes God is picking up those
[16:28] ones that didn't hear and didn't
[16:30] know but as far as America it's
[16:36] finished I'm not talking about bride I'm
[16:40] talking about
[16:41] country right you understand me because
[16:44] our political system has locked him out
[16:47] of the door he's been knocking for so
[16:50] long like he is is with Israel right he
[16:53] didn't understand they looked at
[16:55] Jeremiah and Jeremiah was just to them a
[16:58] false prophet
[16:59] cuz he wasn't preaching what their
[17:01] prophets were
[17:02] preaching here's Jeremiah he was like a
[17:05] doomsday Prophet repent and if you don't
[17:09] repent God is going to destroy you but
[17:11] hold up brother I'm bride you know how
[17:14] people do God ain't going to destroy me
[17:18] cuz I'm bride I'm a Jew I'm circumcised
[17:21] on the Eighth Day y'all know what I mean
[17:24] their religion is the thing that made
[17:26] them
[17:27] blind and because you under this message
[17:30] that don't mean you can live any kind of
[17:32] way God does not change amen and the
[17:37] Bible said whatsoever man sth he shall
[17:40] also reap but thank God for his grace
[17:43] and his
[17:44] Mercy thank God for his grace and his
[17:49] Mercy I don't want to get too carried on
[17:51] I don't want to preach but my point is
[17:53] now is there anybody have a question or
[17:55] something that you might want to say at
[17:56] this point in time
[18:02] okay let's let's move
[18:03] on Jeremiah
[18:05] 4:7 look what it says
[18:08] here now it's amazing how when God comes
[18:12] when things get to a place like it was
[18:14] in the days of Noah Noah being a prophet
[18:17] he warned the people see Jeremiah is not
[18:20] the first of the prophets he me even
[18:23] though they warn him now Noah had 120
[18:27] years to warn him
[18:29] right as far as we could count but my
[18:32] point is this they didn't get any better
[18:36] see it's something about man and when I
[18:38] say that you got to understand what God
[18:41] is doing because everything that was
[18:44] killed in the flood was not of
[18:48] God they weren't the seed of
[18:50] God they were called the sons of God
[18:53] because they were in the image they were
[18:56] Fallen they were serpents and the reason
[18:59] why God was able to save Noah is because
[19:03] of who he was and the Bible said he was
[19:06] righteous because he obeyed God he
[19:09] didn't mix his seed he didn't mix his
[19:11] seed he he stayed with his
[19:14] own right even his children went out and
[19:17] did what they did I heard
[19:21] somebody wondering how did the serpent
[19:23] get over on the other side well through
[19:25] the
[19:26] women they were mixed
[19:30] and that's how it happened but
[19:32] nevertheless amen God did what when he
[19:35] couldn't get them to repent what did he
[19:37] do destroyed
[19:39] it look at America how can you get them
[19:43] to
[19:44] repent there is no repentance
[19:47] here and we're living in an age where
[19:50] everybody think they're riding their own
[19:51] they're riding their own eyes it's not
[19:54] something that new it's it's always been
[19:56] that way
[19:58] and every time it comes to a place where
[20:01] God has to send a
[20:04] destroyer to destroy the wicked off the
[20:07] Earth Jeremiah 4 and 7 here Jeremiah
[20:12] says the lion has come up from his
[20:15] Thicket and the destroyer of the Gentile
[20:20] is on his way I want you to understand
[20:23] the the destroyer of the Gentile is here
[20:27] amen
[20:28] our days is are numbered as the Gentiles
[20:32] amen and the Gentiles are being
[20:37] destroyed and what we don't see is that
[20:40] that that that Destroyer has anointed
[20:43] the political
[20:44] realm and they're passing all kinds of
[20:47] laws to destroy
[20:50] what
[20:52] Mankind and we we we've done listen it's
[20:56] a destruction spirit in the whole earth
[20:58] amen we're destroying the Earth We're
[21:00] destroying the air we're destroying the
[21:02] ocean we're destroying everything even
[21:05] ourselves that is the spirit of
[21:08] destroyer and I'm going to show you
[21:09] something in the scripture here this
[21:11] morning uh tonight because it it just
[21:13] really I'm like Lord is this is
[21:16] us because of their Disobedience did you
[21:19] know God allowed them to be
[21:23] invaded invaded by different nations
[21:27] different people and they came in and
[21:31] started destroying and and taking
[21:34] advantage of All That was supposed to be
[21:37] Israel's do that sound
[21:42] familiar their hearts were full of
[21:44] malice it it it got to the place that
[21:46] were hating each
[21:49] other hello have y'all seen that amen
[21:53] among our own amen you know republ I'm
[21:57] nether One Republic an are Democrat I'm
[21:59] a Christian but the point is we used to
[22:03] somewhat love each other amen we used to
[22:06] at least get alone amen but now
[22:09] everybody hate each other and listen
[22:12] that spirit is being placed on the whole
[22:16] nation amen instead of bringing us into
[22:19] a Unity it's dividing us and a house div
[22:23] divided cannot stand
[22:27] amen but who who's doing it oh the devil
[22:30] yeah but God sent him amen because we
[22:33] rejected the truth gospel and because we
[22:37] reject the truth of the Gospel the only
[22:39] thing left is Judgment amen is that
[22:42] right that's what the Bible said you
[22:44] wait in the balance and you're found
[22:48] wanting yes the handwriting is on the
[22:51] wall and I believe with all my heart
[22:53] we're right at the end of this thing
[22:55] there's a part of me that is rejoicing
[22:57] that's saying even so like John come
[23:00] Lord Jesus but then there's another part
[23:03] of me that just said Lord but what about
[23:05] all these
[23:07] Souls how can we help them I could feel
[23:10] Jeremiah when I read this thing because
[23:13] I I even though I'm nothing like him but
[23:15] I can see the com the passion he had for
[23:19] Israel they hated him but he loved them
[23:23] and he was trying to warn them on of the
[23:26] oncoming storm but they would not listen
[23:30] you know he's not the only Prophet that
[23:32] tried to warn Israel and they kept going
[23:34] on and on and on and all of a sudden a
[23:36] army invade him and they say why Lord
[23:38] why
[23:39] me you know you know they always blame
[23:42] it back on God they put it back on God
[23:44] when God through his
[23:46] preachers amen warning the people listen
[23:50] I know about
[23:53] God I know about God I know when God
[23:55] When when when when you when when when I
[23:57] get to the place where I can't affect
[24:00] you in the preaching or God can't affect
[24:02] you through my preaching you know what
[24:03] he'll do he'll send somebody from out of
[24:05] town and they'll preach the very same
[24:07] thing I
[24:09] preached and he and and God will do that
[24:12] to get your
[24:13] attention what is he trying to get us to
[24:16] do
[24:18] repent there you know people act like
[24:20] act like repenting is a curse word no
[24:23] when you can repent that's a blessing
[24:26] amen it's a it's it's a curse when you
[24:29] can't
[24:32] repent oh my
[24:34] God Jeremiah said listen oh
[24:39] Jerusalem jumping down to the to the 14
[24:42] the 15 14th verse of the fourth chapter
[24:44] oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from
[24:48] wickedness that thou mayest be saved how
[24:51] long shall thou vain thoughts Lodge
[24:55] within thee and ain't that right we the
[24:59] most of the thoughts if we're not
[25:00] careful during the day is
[25:02] vain amen if it's not worshiping God if
[25:06] it's not giving honor to God or or
[25:08] praising God everything else is
[25:10] foolishness amen and and we find out
[25:13] that you know we the the the the the
[25:16] children of God Amen are so into
[25:19] everything else except the program of
[25:23] God
[25:24] Amen and when we try to get people to do
[25:27] for God God they're too busy now that
[25:31] sound just like a
[25:33] scripture when Jesus bid them to the
[25:36] marriage some say I can't go because I
[25:39] just got married some say I'm too busy I
[25:42] got this I I got this i got this i got
[25:45] this God said forget it leave them
[25:49] be go to the highways in the byways amen
[25:53] go to the rejected cuz my table will be
[25:56] full amen amen see and that's what
[25:59] that's what people don't they don't
[26:00] think it could happen to them I'm sorry
[26:03] it's happening now
[26:06] amen God ain't going to continue to beg
[26:09] people he's not going to do
[26:11] it he told Jeremiah I'm you you're the
[26:15] Last
[26:17] Hope don't y'all understand Meen when
[26:20] God sent William brandom to this this
[26:23] age it was the AG's Last
[26:26] Hope and when they turned that message
[26:29] down they thought they were turning him
[26:31] down but see they didn't understand it
[26:34] was Jesus knocking on the door trying to
[26:37] get
[26:38] in look at them
[26:41] now I saw something I guess it was on my
[26:44] thing and it flipped to the YouTube I
[26:45] forgot how I seen it or somebody sent it
[26:47] to me I think somebody yeah a brother
[26:50] sent it to me this was a church and I
[26:54] want to uh I won't call the people name
[26:56] but y'all know them because they just
[26:57] some M just got in big trouble but it
[27:00] was a huge mega church and on the pull
[27:04] pit in their
[27:06] opening they had these girls dressed in
[27:10] these short little uh look like Hawaiian
[27:13] skirt kind of thing where you can
[27:15] jiggle and they were
[27:18] dancing to
[27:20] Beyonce in the
[27:23] church and then the pastor his wife came
[27:26] out doing the Jitterbug you know dce
[27:29] y'all know how they did it in the 20s
[27:31] yeah and the crowd is
[27:35] roaring if that's not apostasy I don't
[27:37] know what it is and I'm telling you they
[27:40] were making every kind of move I guess
[27:42] Beyonce would
[27:43] move but my point is how can that be
[27:47] Jesus and people think that if it's
[27:50] appeal to the young people to get them
[27:52] into a building that's church that's not
[27:56] salvation I brother brandham said it he
[27:59] said I saw them twisting and moving to
[28:02] the bead of rock and roll now people
[28:05] we've I can truly see it
[28:07] now I can see how to the extreme people
[28:11] have
[28:12] gone they've taken dancing that they
[28:14] used to do in the club bringing in the
[28:17] church and because it say Jesus they
[28:19] call it
[28:20] Christian that's not Christian
[28:24] music and those people are not
[28:26] Christians
[28:29] and God said whatever you do don't
[28:31] follow after the ways of the Canaanites
[28:34] amen and these people are modern day
[28:37] Canaanites and when I speak of
[28:39] Canaanites I'm not speaking of color
[28:42] Canaanites is everybody that rejects the
[28:45] word amen that's
[28:51] true look at
[28:53] us it would have best been best that
[28:56] most people in this message would have
[28:57] never come in contact with it because of
[29:00] the way we handle
[29:01] it yall understand me it would have been
[29:05] best if some would have stay Pentecostal
[29:07] a Baptist at least you would have had a
[29:08] better
[29:09] chance y'all understand me my point is
[29:12] you come to the greatest of all messages
[29:16] that's like putting your hand on the Ark
[29:18] of the Covenant y'all understand me you
[29:20] come to the the the the word that comes
[29:23] out of the holies of holies and we
[29:26] trample upon it we laugh at it as if God
[29:30] doesn't mean what he says Jeremiah says
[29:33] he's meaning it you better listen oh we
[29:37] got Grace hallelujah amen but let me
[29:40] tell you something a true Born Again
[29:43] believer all they ever want to do is the
[29:46] right thing amen we all make mistakes
[29:49] that's what the grace is for but Grace
[29:52] is not just for you to just do anything
[29:54] you want to and then come to church like
[29:57] you're holy and right rightous that's
[29:59] what they were doing God said I'm sick
[30:01] of it I'm sick of
[30:04] it I'm sick of it Hallelujah you love
[30:09] the Lord ameny this is a beautiful thing
[30:13] beautiful thing and like I said it got
[30:15] to the place they were hating one
[30:16] another competition among churches you
[30:19] know
[30:20] that's that's what you have to really be
[30:22] careful of even among the message people
[30:25] because somebody else got something that
[30:27] doesn't mean you got to have
[30:29] it I think some sometimes the simpler
[30:31] you are the more safe you are amen yeah
[30:35] yeah we don't have to have it the next
[30:36] thing you'll know you have robe choirs
[30:38] and y'all know what I'm saying it I
[30:40] don't I don't believe that we'll go that
[30:42] far I don't I hope we don't but if we do
[30:46] when I say we I mean the message as a
[30:48] whole this church will never go that way
[30:51] that ain't happening but my point is
[30:55] people think it's okay cuz they don't
[30:58] realize where that come
[30:59] from those a lot of the things we got up
[31:02] in here let me hurry ah Mercy listen
[31:06] Jeremiah
[31:07] 4:15 22nd any comments any
[31:11] thoughts in your reading that you
[31:17] read
[31:18] amen there's so much in here and I I
[31:21] can't get it all out but all I can see
[31:24] is our
[31:25] day the are Church the way way we've
[31:28] done and let's say like like I think the
[31:31] prophet of God would say let's take
[31:33] every
[31:34] denomination including this uh message
[31:38] and and let's say we all are
[31:42] Christians and my my thought is this and
[31:45] if we we right what I'm trying to say is
[31:50] all of Israel had to be judged by the
[31:52] same word whether they were all Israel
[31:55] or not you understand me if you call
[31:58] yourself a
[32:00] Christian you will be judged as a
[32:02] Christian amen regardless to how you up
[32:06] the ladder you are how down you're going
[32:09] to be judged as a
[32:11] Christian yes
[32:28] come
[32:28] to I
[32:31] knowu world I'm say it just come my
[32:37] mind it just come across my mind um
[32:42] would that be the same aspect well yeah
[32:44] yeah because what this was almost like a
[32:46] Midnight
[32:47] Cry for for uh this was almost a
[32:51] Midnight Cry for
[32:53] Israel one of them I mean you
[32:56] know and and and and and and what God
[32:59] was saying now I'm going to destroy you
[33:00] but I'm not going to destroy you totally
[33:03] I think I got a scripture in there that
[33:05] shows that he says I'm going this is the
[33:06] end but not
[33:08] all will perish in this
[33:12] so to jump I'mma jump and I come back to
[33:15] this if you understand what Jeremiah was
[33:18] trying to get them to escape these
[33:21] people have become so business-minded to
[33:24] God wasn't in it and and they had gotten
[33:27] to the a place that they weren't even uh
[33:31] um respecting the Sabbath or the seventh
[33:35] year because every seven years is a a
[33:38] Sabbath of celebration of Sabbath and
[33:40] every seven years that land was supposed
[33:42] to rest and they had gotten so bad
[33:45] because remember now the Sabbath still
[33:47] is the Sabbath and and when I say that I
[33:50] don't mean a day I'm talking about the
[33:51] Holy Spirit and we're not supposed to
[33:54] bring crazy stuff into our lives if if
[33:57] we is supposed to be
[33:59] resting see God don't like it when we're
[34:02] not
[34:03] resting you understand what I'm saying
[34:06] he wants us to rest when we rest in God
[34:09] it pleases him because that's what the
[34:13] natural uh uh Sabbath was all about to
[34:16] get the people to rest you don't have to
[34:18] work on this day don't let me catch you
[34:20] working on this day it's it's it's to
[34:23] rest and and the true rest of God Amen
[34:26] you don't work cuz the work is finished
[34:29] amen right so they didn't respect that
[34:32] and that was a shadow and a type of the
[34:35] thing to come which was Christ and
[34:37] because they didn't respect it they had
[34:39] to they were God allowed
[34:43] Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar to come and
[34:47] he destroyed a lot of them because they
[34:49] were
[34:50] disobedient he killed most of their
[34:52] leaders and their sons and uh they were
[34:58] in Babylon for 70
[35:02] years now think about it Shadrach mishek
[35:06] Abednego was there Daniel was there they
[35:11] were righteous people but they still had
[35:15] to suffer because of the
[35:18] majority they themselves had to go down
[35:21] to Babylon and stay there and most of
[35:24] them died in Babylon because of the
[35:27] majority of the wickedness of the
[35:32] people ain't that crazy not crazy but
[35:36] the point is he's the same yesterday
[35:39] today and
[35:40] forever see we we don't understand you
[35:43] say well why would God do that the same
[35:44] thing he did to aan when aan sinned his
[35:48] whole family
[35:49] died that's why it's
[35:52] important for us because if nobody else
[35:56] is in the family that's living right we
[35:57] got to live right as much as possible
[36:00] just to secure Our
[36:07] House 415- 2 uh for a voice declared
[36:12] from Dan and publish afflictions from
[36:16] Mount Ephraim make you mention to the
[36:20] Nations behold publish again in other
[36:23] words put it in the newspaper let see in
[36:25] the end know and everybody else know
[36:27] about just
[36:28] Jerusalem what Watchers come from a far
[36:31] country and give their voices against
[36:33] the cities of Judah in other words God
[36:35] was saying I'm sending preachers from
[36:37] all over the country to come and try to
[36:39] warn you guys and you still will not
[36:42] listen and that's exactly what I see
[36:46] among preachers come in here and they
[36:48] warn
[36:50] us I mean sometimes they even take it
[36:53] deeper than I can to get to shake the
[36:55] people and guess what you get excited
[36:58] and then after that is
[37:02] done it's
[37:04] true that Pastor that came and I still
[37:07] haven't got that that Pastor that came
[37:10] and
[37:12] preached and and and I wasn't here on
[37:15] Easter I heard he tore it up oh I wish I
[37:19] had been here yes
[37:21] sir but it didn't know people it didn't
[37:25] not even the tithe increase
[37:28] nothing
[37:30] changed I mean some people start coming
[37:32] to church more so maybe that had
[37:34] something to do with it I I don't know
[37:36] but where are they
[37:39] tonight it doesn't last
[37:42] why break up the Fowler
[37:45] ground people don't want to get on their
[37:47] knees and get before God we're too
[37:51] prideful we we we we we we don't want to
[37:54] stay long enough as if God don't see us
[37:58] amen you need to stay listen if it's a
[38:00] matter of life or death and it's coming
[38:02] to that it's going to be that way and I
[38:06] trust by the time God to getting us to
[38:08] pray it ain't too late cuz you don't I
[38:12] hope you don't think that that door is
[38:14] wide open
[38:15] anymore I believe it's it's
[38:17] [Applause]
[38:18] narrowing you got the door wide open
[38:20] when you expect a big crowd to come
[38:23] through but I'm just
[38:26] saying according to the parable only
[38:28] five came
[38:30] through at the end now I'm sure that's
[38:32] just symbolism but y'all know what I'm
[38:35] saying we got to be careful even though
[38:38] we call our s bride and I'm not trying
[38:41] to disturb your peace now understand
[38:43] what I'm saying I believe that those of
[38:45] us who are here have a sincere heart and
[38:48] I believe with all my heart God has has
[38:50] his hand on on us and I'm not trying to
[38:53] scare you into anything but I'm trying
[38:55] to say by the grace of God if it
[38:58] happened in
[38:59] Jeremiah's day and we can see that and
[39:02] we can see the very same thing that
[39:04] Jeremiah is preaching against happening
[39:06] in our day The God Who changes not has
[39:09] to judge the sin the sins of this world
[39:13] like he did
[39:15] Israel right okay let's move on as
[39:19] keeper he says make mention of the
[39:20] Nations behold publish against Jerusalem
[39:23] that Watchman come from a far country
[39:25] and give out their V Vice against
[39:27] against the cities of Judah as a keeper
[39:30] of the field are they against her
[39:32] roundabout because she have been
[39:34] rebellious against me said the Lord
[39:36] listen and and you know and I can't I I
[39:39] have to say it like this with with all
[39:41] of the
[39:43] changes that is happening in the
[39:45] political realm all of the laws that are
[39:48] just everything seem to be against the
[39:51] word everything that's right out
[39:53] rebellious amen Rebels
[39:58] and they mocking
[39:59] God you know now they've gotten so so so
[40:04] into their devil worshiping they they
[40:07] call they worship the devil straight out
[40:10] on TV and everything give honor to to
[40:13] Satan and give you know we're we're
[40:15] we're what they call it um sodomite they
[40:18] bragging on it to this day this this now
[40:23] I saw it with my own
[40:25] eyes people send me clipping of things
[40:27] and I mean it's just like oh my goodness
[40:29] maybe maybe that's what I need to just
[40:32] keep me moving because with that kind of
[40:35] thing God don't like it when men puff
[40:40] themselves up to be something that
[40:42] they're not God has a way of bringing
[40:44] them
[40:46] down listen let's move on as keepers of
[40:49] the field are they against her
[40:51] roundabout because she have been
[40:53] rebellious against me said the Lord thy
[40:56] way and thy doings have procured these
[40:58] things unto thee this is the wickedness
[41:02] because it is bitter because it reaches
[41:05] unto thine my thine heart my Bowers my
[41:09] Bowers listen what God is saying or
[41:12] Jeremiah he says I'm pain at my very
[41:15] heart my heart maketh a noise in me I
[41:18] cannot hold my peace because thou Hast
[41:22] heard oh my soul the sound of the
[41:24] trumpet the alarm of War
[41:28] H God now is at War listen God can come
[41:32] down and wipe everything clean but what
[41:34] does he do he rais up men to fight the
[41:39] battle unconverted men he raised them up
[41:45] to put the the Christian in
[41:47] check if we as Christians would have
[41:50] ever remain United and we would have
[41:53] stayed with the Holy Ghost none of this
[41:55] would be happening
[41:57] but we allowed ourselves to be
[42:01] infiltrated just like
[42:04] Israel with all the Demonic forces of
[42:07] lead deia and now we find ourselves
[42:10] standing
[42:14] crippled oh yeah you said well brother
[42:16] signs and wonders don't you know there
[42:17] are Pentecostal churches right now that
[42:20] has more signs and wonders than we
[42:23] do but that doesn't save you we got the
[42:27] Word of
[42:28] Life but I'm not saying they're not
[42:30] Christian they'll come up somewhere but
[42:32] I hope we all come up in the Rapture
[42:36] amen there's a destruction Spirit on
[42:38] this world not just America on the world
[42:42] and they're joining forces together to
[42:45] make sure it
[42:46] happens my B here he is in pain oh my
[42:49] soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm
[42:52] of War destruction upon destruction is C
[42:55] is cried destruction upon destruction
[42:58] and I'm coming to something in a minute
[43:00] for the whole land is spoiled suddenly
[43:03] we are t h my tent spoiled and my
[43:05] curtains in a moment how long shall I
[43:08] see the standard and hear the sound of
[43:10] trumpet for my people is
[43:14] foolish they have not known me they are
[43:18] sish children and they have known none
[43:21] none understanding they are wise to do
[43:24] evil but to do good they have no no
[43:28] knowledge what is it why is it they have
[43:31] been
[43:34] deceived one of the greatest deception
[43:37] of this age is to believe that God is
[43:39] three and the whole world believes
[43:42] that and it took us a prophet a prophet
[43:45] to tell us what that that's demonic
[43:50] power God is a trinity but not in three
[43:52] persons
[43:55] amen and they don't understand that and
[43:58] you will be you will be persecuted for
[44:00] believing that that God is
[44:03] one you better know your word cuz if you
[44:07] ain't got it in your heart they going to
[44:09] take it whatever knowledge you think you
[44:11] got because I'm going to tell you
[44:12] something this battle that we're getting
[44:14] ready to fight and is fighting is not
[44:17] natural it's spiritual amen we're
[44:20] dealing with Supernatural Chargers
[44:23] demonic power that has been loosed on
[44:26] the Bride of Jesus
[44:27] Christ H you know what they're not going
[44:30] to have any
[44:33] pity they're
[44:34] not and what Hitler did
[44:37] there what they going to do all around
[44:41] the world would look like a picnic
[44:45] compared just so you
[44:48] know the deception of people that's what
[44:52] it is our day this world is so deceived
[44:54] they don't even know God no more they
[44:57] question whether there be a God oh
[45:01] my it amazes me go to Ezekiel please I
[45:05] know I'm jumping a little
[45:08] bit give me a few more minutes Ezekiel
[45:12] 9:5
[45:13] And1 seemed like Ezekiel had the same
[45:16] thing he had to deal with but we find
[45:19] out that Ezekiel catches the vision and
[45:21] this Vision doesn't just stop there in
[45:23] Israel but it this thing contined to
[45:26] repeat itself
[45:29] and Ezekiel amen says in the fifth verse
[45:32] it says and to the others he said in
[45:34] mine hearing go ye after him through the
[45:37] city and smite and let not your eyes
[45:40] spare neither have what
[45:43] pity so you say if you're a foolish
[45:45] virgin you left behind you think there's
[45:47] going to be pity no you're going to
[45:51] suffer whatever horrible death there is
[45:52] laying for you and the Bible said
[45:55] they're look to die and can't die so God
[45:59] having the keys of death Hell In The
[46:00] Grave he's going to let you suffer till
[46:03] you pay your dues in this
[46:07] Dimension before you go to the next
[46:11] one don't you know say you can't die
[46:15] until God gives
[46:18] permission cuz Satan don't even have the
[46:20] keys God's got him he you can't even die
[46:24] to God says okay the devil it's okay
[46:27] God has the key of death hell and the
[46:31] grave he don't have that power so think
[46:35] about it think about it you know I look
[46:38] at and I was reading about Isaiah you
[46:41] know when they told me Isaiah was Sor in
[46:43] half I looked that up and I had no idea
[46:48] you know in my mind I'm looking at the
[46:50] thing that killed Isaiah like a like a
[46:53] guillotine one chop boom but they had
[46:56] these old fashioned saws a man on this
[46:59] end and a man on this end and they were
[47:03] sawing him like a
[47:05] tree can you imagine the Demonic power
[47:08] or thought in these people's mind they
[47:11] could literally saw another human being
[47:13] in
[47:14] half that was
[47:17] then what about
[47:21] now it's not going to be light that's
[47:23] why we got to make it we got to make
[47:26] this trans ation people don't let

[48:01] pastor oh I forgot his name the white
[48:03] brother um Chandler yeah a wonderful
[48:08] brother uh I heard all kinds of great
[48:10] things about him good things and and he
[48:13] he for what I understand he preached a
[48:15] big old beautiful message there in in
[48:17] the Ivory Coast I even listened to
[48:19] portion of it they were really having a
[48:20] good time and then he they said he all
[48:23] he did was Slumber
[48:24] slumbered and then shortly after after
[48:26] that he was
[48:27] gone you know what his last song was he
[48:30] was was singing I'm going up
[48:35] yonder I'm going up yonder I said God
[48:38] you told that man you that man knew he
[48:41] was leaving what I tell you what if you
[48:44] got to die you that's the best way to
[48:46] die in
[48:47] Jesus oh Lord have
[48:50] mercy yes God is so good to us oh man if
[48:54] that doesn't stir those people up I
[48:56] don't know nothing else that word that
[48:58] when when a saintly man of God tells you
[49:01] almost in his own mysterious way that
[49:04] that and he's telling you I'm glad to be
[49:06] with you and I'm I we're in a Rapture
[49:08] and this is the eighth age I believe all
[49:10] of that was the Holy Spirit speaking to
[49:12] those people convincing them and then he
[49:16] dies like he
[49:18] died if I wasn't right I get right
[49:23] amen all right he said SL slay UT old
[49:27] and young both you know I'm tying these
[49:29] two prophets in because they dealing
[49:31] with the same kind of spirit right the
[49:34] same kind of stuff Israel both maid and
[49:37] little children and women right what but
[49:40] come not near any A man among whom is
[49:43] the mark and began at the sanctuary they
[49:46] then they began at the ancient men which
[49:49] were before the house and why why
[49:53] ancient to because they know better but
[49:55] because you say I'm ancient not been in
[49:57] the message all these years don't mean
[49:58] that you living right don't even know
[50:00] don't even believe don't even me is that
[50:02] the word because you ancient don't mean
[50:05] you got the
[50:06] token why would he say start at the
[50:09] ancient start at the old people cuz
[50:12] there's a lot of old people that don't
[50:14] have it amen the only people that he
[50:17] could not slay was those who had the
[50:19] mark amen who had the Holy
[50:22] Ghost now here he says even the young
[50:25] the children and all because God knew
[50:27] knows them that are
[50:29] his thank
[50:31] Lord the Lord is so wonderful right
[50:35] beginning at the sanctuary that's why I
[50:37] try to tell people if the church had
[50:39] never lost its Savor the salt the world
[50:43] would have been
[50:44] preserved but we went
[50:46] worldly we got
[50:49] glamorous we did all the things and We
[50:51] snuck Hollywood into our churches and
[50:54] that's what happened sneak Hollywood in
[50:58] the Holy Ghost leaves that's the way it
[51:01] works and he said unto them defile the
[51:03] house fill the courts with slain go ye
[51:06] forth and they went forth and slew in
[51:09] the city and it came to pass while they
[51:12] were slain them and I was left that I
[51:15] fell upon my face and cried and said oh
[51:18] Lord God would thou destroy all the
[51:21] residue of Israel in the pouring out the
[51:23] fury upon Jerusalem then said unto me
[51:26] then said he unto me the iniquity of the
[51:29] House of Israel and Judah is exceedingly
[51:32] great and the land is full of blood and
[51:36] the City full of perverseness for they
[51:39] say that the Lord have forsaken the
[51:41] earth and the Lord seeth not now yall
[51:44] understand me if that is not the
[51:46] condition of the world right now I don't
[51:48] know what it is
[51:50] amen they think God don't see
[51:53] them and the thing is it's full of blood
[51:56] murders
[51:57] everywhere people killing each other for
[51:59] pleasure amen and they've conditioned us
[52:02] with all those video games to see blood
[52:04] everywhere so it doesn't bother us
[52:08] anymore church people we're not we're
[52:11] not sensitive to the Holy Spirit like we
[52:14] ought to be from the pull pit to the
[52:17] back of the door I'm not preaching on
[52:19] nobody my point is this we all need to
[52:22] be more
[52:24] sincere amen
[52:27] and behold the man clothed with linen
[52:30] which had the inkor by his side reported
[52:33] the matter saying I have done as thou
[52:35] has commanded me in other words he
[52:37] killed everything this wasn't a parable
[52:40] this was
[52:42] reality and one of the times that this
[52:44] happened was
[52:46] 8070 when Titus came in and killed
[52:50] everything that was left in Jerusalem so
[52:53] much so the Bible said the blood came up
[52:55] to the house hores Bridal it was bad and
[53:00] you think that's bad why because they
[53:03] thought if they trusted their Church
[53:05] they could be
[53:06] saved they they they they they just just
[53:09] just saw Jesus they saw the blood
[53:12] sacrifice and they get didn't give the
[53:15] honor nor
[53:16] praise and by they're cursing themselves
[53:18] by saying let his blood be on us and our
[53:21] children and I tell you what the Jews
[53:24] have suffered every since amen
[53:27] they curse
[53:31] themselves see this is the day where men
[53:34] call God good evil and evil good the
[53:37] Judgment of the Lord was upon the Jews
[53:39] for the for their
[53:42] uh de privity adultery their
[53:47] Injustice and you know that's the true
[53:49] people they even in churches you know
[53:52] they they want someone else to you know
[53:55] but you got to balance that thing you
[53:56] can't judge this person one way and then
[53:59] let another one get away no the word is
[54:02] right right the condition of the people
[54:05] had become so terrible that the Lord
[54:08] himself asked Jeremiah to find one man
[54:11] that execute judgment and seek the truth
[54:14] they had become so evil that the Lord
[54:17] could not find not even one the Lord
[54:20] left them defenseless and this is where
[54:22] I'm running right now and then I'm going
[54:24] to let you go the fifth chapter
[54:27] he said run ye to and throw through the
[54:30] city Jeremiah
[54:32] 51-3 of Jerusalem and see now and know
[54:35] and seek in the in the broad Place
[54:38] thereof if you can find a man if there
[54:43] be any that execute judgment that seek
[54:46] the truth and I will pardon it now see s
[54:49] Ruby that's how it was it in Sodom and
[54:52] gomorah it broke down from 50 all the
[54:54] way to 10 but now God is saiding if you
[54:57] can find
[54:58] one that's these people were more evil
[55:02] than Sodom and
[55:04] gomorra he couldn't find
[55:07] one and though they say Lord live the
[55:10] Lord liveth surely they swear
[55:13] falsely oh Lord are not Thine Eyes Upon
[55:16] the truth thou has stricken them but
[55:19] they have not greed thou H has consumed
[55:22] them but they have not refused to
[55:24] receive correction and y'all know it's
[55:26] the truth no matter what kind of
[55:29] national disaster happens here in our
[55:32] country the people will not repent I
[55:36] mean they can even escape from floods
[55:38] and they'll never mention God did it yes
[55:42] brother just many times new orans
[55:45] destroyed they yeah yeah they won't
[55:48] repent and if anybody need to repent is
[55:51] New
[55:52] Orleans that's where they hold that
[55:54] Migra right the ra from hell that's what
[55:58] it
[56:00] is but they have refused to receive
[56:03] correction they have made their faces
[56:05] harder than a rock they have refused to
[56:08] return talk to somebody about Jesus and
[56:11] watch that demon power come up in front
[56:13] of their
[56:13] faces you'll see them they could be
[56:16] smiling all of a sudden you'll see that
[56:20] thing they don't want to hear
[56:23] it this is repeated in history all the
[56:26] nations of the Gentiles have turned
[56:28] their backs on the Living God to me the
[56:31] book of Jeremiah is speaking to the
[56:32] world as he did to
[56:34] Israel right now I I might have to let
[56:38] me let me read this and then I'll let
[56:39] you go I'm sorry Jeremiah
[56:42] 56-18 and I want you to I want you to
[56:44] and um and after I read this I'm not
[56:46] going to read no more I'm going let you
[56:48] carry on F uh through Jeremiah that fth
[56:51] chapter just finish reading all of that
[56:54] and um read Revelations 3 314- 22 those
[56:58] things kind of tie in Ezekiel 9 which I
[57:01] I I just read to you all these things
[57:03] just it it ties all in because we see
[57:07] that God is
[57:10] angry he's
[57:12] angry and he's fed up and we we just
[57:17] don't see
[57:18] it now I'm going tell you like this it
[57:22] thank God that uh uh we had a type in
[57:26] the Bible with with Esther and
[57:31] vasy but
[57:32] vasy in herself thought she couldn't be
[57:36] destroyed she was the queen and she let
[57:39] that pride get in her and so when God
[57:42] was calling like he is now see when the
[57:45] preacher when the preacher is preaching
[57:46] repentance when the preacher is calling
[57:48] for the people to to to submit and lot
[57:51] of time people look at brother Brooks
[57:52] and they look at me they don't even see
[57:55] the god behind this vessel trying to get
[57:58] them to to repent and to change their
[58:01] minds some people say well they'll walk
[58:03] out we don't need that kind of message
[58:05] we're the bride they want a jumping and
[58:07] a shouting and we're Justified and
[58:09] Sanctified and all and I'm wondering at
[58:12] what point in
[58:13] time because how can you be filled with
[58:16] the Holy Ghost and yet not
[58:20] Sanctified now don't get me wrong we
[58:22] make
[58:24] mistakes but listen I'm going to tell
[58:26] you this is my ultimate Revelation my
[58:28] revelation of of of of what the Holy
[58:30] Ghost is the Holy Ghost when a man has a
[58:33] holy ghost in his soul his Earnest
[58:36] desire is to do the perfect will of
[58:41] God that's what I believe the Holy Ghost
[58:43] because if you was a devil you wouldn't
[58:45] even think about it wouldn't cross your
[58:48] mind but when that Earnest desires to do
[58:51] the will of God God will make it happen
[58:55] and some point in time that perfect will
[58:58] will become a perfect manifestation amen
[59:01] I believe
[59:02] that Jeremiah 56-18 wherefore a lion out
[59:06] of the forest shall slay them and a wolf
[59:09] of the evening shall spoil them and a
[59:11] leopard shall watch over their cities
[59:13] and everyone that goeth out hence then
[59:16] shall be torn in pieces because their
[59:19] transgression are many and their
[59:21] backsliding are increased right every
[59:24] year it gets worse and worse I mean he
[59:27] talking about church because first of
[59:30] all the judgment begins first at the
[59:33] house of God
[59:35] Amen Jeremiah 56-18 and how shall I
[59:39] pardon thee for this how shall I pardon
[59:42] thee for this thy children have forsaken
[59:44] me and sworn by them that are no gods
[59:48] and when I fed them to the full they
[59:51] then committed adultery and assembled
[59:54] themselves by the troops in the Harlot
[59:57] houses now you say well what do you mean
[59:59] brother y'all know when it come to
[1:00:01] preacher children and when I say
[1:00:03] preachers children those of us who know
[1:00:06] the message have taught our children the
[1:00:07] message when they
[1:00:09] backslide some I know I know what I'm
[1:00:11] talking about I'm not just talking about
[1:00:13] um dealing with my family I'm talking
[1:00:16] about others the the scope of the whole
[1:00:18] thing seem like the children go way
[1:00:21] out way
[1:00:26] Beyond
[1:00:27] measures they
[1:00:29] do right I I a wonderful
[1:00:33] Pastor I shouldn't say that I won't say
[1:00:35] that because but but my point is most of
[1:00:38] those people in Hollywood a lot of them
[1:00:40] people started out in
[1:00:42] church P daddies or M or grandmothers
[1:00:46] somebody was a preacher somewhere and
[1:00:48] they get up there and they do just like
[1:00:51] this they come to a place where they
[1:00:52] worship everything but the god that
[1:00:54] brought them and Israel is doing the
[1:00:57] same thing you find a lot of Jews who
[1:00:59] are
[1:01:00] atheists worshiping all kinds of
[1:01:04] stuff what was that what was the cap
[1:01:07] what's the capital of uh uh um the one
[1:01:10] place they wouldn't take us in uh in
[1:01:12] Israel Tel Aviv they wouldn't take us to
[1:01:15] Tel Aviv you know why they said it was
[1:01:17] too Wicked and too
[1:01:19] dangerous
[1:01:21] Israel you understand
[1:01:23] me and so I'm just saying
[1:01:26] the Bible is
[1:01:28] right how shall I pardon thee for this
[1:01:32] right and it goes on when I had fed them
[1:01:35] to to the full they then they then
[1:01:39] committed adultery and assembled
[1:01:41] themselves by troops in the Harlot
[1:01:43] houses oh my God they were as fed horses
[1:01:47] in the morning and everyone n after
[1:01:51] their neighbor's wife looking at
[1:01:53] somebody else's wife and wanting to lust
[1:01:55] after them and all that man my goodness
[1:01:57] hey don't think it's out
[1:02:01] there it's among
[1:02:07] am it's terrible and you know the thing
[1:02:10] about is people think the pastor blind
[1:02:12] no I'm not I see
[1:02:15] things and I see movements and
[1:02:18] actions and all I can do is pray for
[1:02:21] them cuz if you ever go to a person and
[1:02:23] say well you know you shouldn't do that
[1:02:24] what you talking about you didn't see me
[1:02:26] do nothing they'll deny it why cuz the
[1:02:28] heart is
[1:02:31] hardened the heart is hardened and there
[1:02:34] were as fed horses in the morning

[1:07:58] this is real and the attack on on
[1:08:02] America and all the other parts of the
[1:08:03] country at least by right now we're not
[1:08:05] having the bombs drop you know why cuz
[1:08:08] the prophet said before one bomb dropped
[1:08:11] and he was working with America will'll
[1:08:13] be gone but guess what the bomb will
[1:08:18] drop the bomb will drop but before that
[1:08:22] bomb drop we'll be gone isn't that
[1:08:24] wonderful the Lord
[1:08:27] listen if I can find one if I can find
[1:08:29] two if I can if I can find if I can find
[1:08:32] three whatever I can find this is what
[1:08:34] he's
[1:08:35] saying that's why brother B said when it
[1:08:37] comes to the Rapture he say only a few
[1:08:39] going to make it cuz everybody caught up
[1:08:42] into a system and ain't nobody really
[1:08:43] seeking
[1:08:45] God they resting on a system one of the
[1:08:47] worst things you can do is rest on your
[1:08:50] church you rest on the word
[1:08:52] am and you y y y you you you've got to
[1:08:56] come to a place amen and I'm y'all pray
[1:08:59] for me and I pray for you I'm going to
[1:09:01] get this what I'm looking
[1:09:03] for I'm determined I don't care if I got
[1:09:06] to fall seven times in a day I'm getting
[1:09:07] straight back up amen because I believe
[1:09:11] with all my heart this is the rapture
[1:09:13] age I believe that our day is so close
[1:09:16] now you can almost taste it I do believe
[1:09:20] that and if I'm out of my mind at least
[1:09:22] if I I'll be ready when he
[1:09:24] come you you know what I'm saying let me
[1:09:26] I don't want to wait till the last
[1:09:27] minute when the squeeze come and they
[1:09:29] start shutting down the churches which
[1:09:31] they
[1:09:33] will I saw there on the YouTube I keep
[1:09:36] saying YouTube but that's maybe what it
[1:09:38] was um because I can't tell sometimes
[1:09:40] people send me stuff where this one man
[1:09:43] a Baptist man mentioned something about
[1:09:46] the vice
[1:09:47] president and and do you know the
[1:09:51] government got on
[1:09:52] him ordered to him
[1:09:56] because of what he said so you know it's
[1:09:59] like okay nothing from nothing leaves
[1:10:06] nothing you order all you want ain't no
[1:10:08] big money
[1:10:10] here ain't nothing to
[1:10:15] steal I'm just saying it's real it's
[1:10:18] real you know my my thing is I know I'm
[1:10:22] bride and I can't stop believing that

[1:10:45] and a few drop off there but the real
[1:10:48] ones they're going to gather around the
