TRANSCRIPT
========================================
studying I thought okay we kind of went through the fifth and we'll be perhaps done in the sixth and um you know I'm thinking oh my uh but I got to study and I don't know how we're going to finish the fifth chapter but we'll try our best uh by the grace of God but um as we stand let us go uh to the fourth chapter of Ephesians the four chapter of Ephesians and we're going to read the 17th through the 24th verse this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that we henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the through the ignorance that is in them them because of blindness of their heart who being past feeling have have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness and with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation the old old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness that ye and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness one more scripture and I let you be seated first pet the fth chapter we'll read the 10th and the 11th verse of First Peter but the god of Grace who have called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthens settles you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen let's pray father God we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you for the Bible study in which we're going to have Lord tonight in your honor I pray that you break the bread we have our notes Lord but we need your inspiration as well for certain to guide us in the correct revelation ation that you would have us to have and understand bless this group tonight bless those who are listening and we'll give you the glory honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated um my subject tonight even though we're going through Ephesians I'd like to just give you a thought the Overcomer must be focused the overcomer must be focused uh we know and I've said it many times since we started Ephesians brother vandom uh uh paralleled it to Joshua and Joshua was taking the children over uh from the Wilderness into the promised land to not only uh put them in a place of fighting because once you get into the Holy Spirit you you have to mature you're going to have to mature there's no way of getting around suffering and conflicts that's part of the journey uh but in so doing we know that the battle has been fought and the Victory have already been won you said well how do you say that brother because God told Joshua I have already given you the land so your Victory our victory tonight has already been given to us but but just like it was in the Book of Joshua you must stay under the leadership of Joshua in order to gain the Victory and you must stay under the leadership of the Holy Ghost in This Day to gain the victory is that right so understand that when you make a mistake uh God doesn't look at that in that sense but when you willfully do something there is a punishment there is a chastisement if you want to say it that way even as it was with Israel when they willfully disobeyed God God spanked them and as I said if it was just one person like aen how it caused many to die because of his erroring ways so staying focus is very important and the reason why I say this because Pentecostal Church as we know it today is not the Pentecost the church that started on theu Street those people were very sincere they were dedicated they saw the power of God move among them in such a way it was a ever everyday scene uh they they did all of the things that those who are pretending to be Pentecostals are doing but they had a life so much so uh their lives were a thunder to the devil and I believe with all of our heart today if we stand in sincerity and I was telling my family I think it was today or yesterday the only way you're going to remain sincere in God's way is to pray amen keeping in contact with God consecrating your life in God is the only way so let me move on as I said but but Pentecost what did they do they fail to remain focused and and whenever you allow Satan to misguide you in your mind then your heart is next if he can conquer you in your mind he has your heart as well and this is why the Bible said that we ought to put on the shield of Faith the helmet of salvation and I'm going to tell you what the helmet of salvation is knowing that you're saved by grace that is the buffler that is the thing that bounces the devil back back off of you no matter what you're going through Hallelujah so we realize amen that when we come through the scripture we realize amen through salvation we know that we're free and I've got a quote here but then we'll get right on into it by the grace of God coming from the message amen um that day of Calvary because what we forget we forget we're on a j Journey we're in a battle everybody want to shout everybody want to dance but nobody want to fight but you've got to fight and God don't want and can't use as the prophet said no coward soldiers that's right now starting at paragraph 80 he says now we say well I appreciate that that's very fine but we've got to accept it accept what he's talking about the grace of God and what Calvary did for you and to accept it is to accept his person Christ in our hearts now I'll say it like this they accepted the blood when they put it on the door Post in the little they had to continually accept that blood in order to cross over Jordan now they accepted it until they did what they became recircumcised and I believe with all of my heart this message is doing something even to me because I realize things now that I've not seen before in my life and that that's when it comes to the sincerity and becoming connected with God on a daily basis I mean really connected I don't mean you know just knocking on his door and somebody says who is it and you say oh it's me I'll see you tomorrow I just was checking in on you no there has to be Fellowship you you want to knock on his door or he knock let him knock on your door but you also want to let him come in right there is no private rooms in our house and so you want God to come in go from every room of your house to search it out to see what might be there that shouldn't be there um right so this is the thing is we are preparing uh and every battle becomes more difficult all right we started off with little battles but now we're having greater battles but the greater battles has been given to you because you become stronger you know you don't you don't fight battles that you used to fight when you was two years old you know what I'm saying you got to come up and fight the bigger battles because they you know you fight the Giants and all the other the other kind of things that are in the land he said then we are free from sin therefore there's no shackles hanging on us at all God just like we had never sinned the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect then there is no more to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of God and this is what must understand if we allow ourselves uh to be disconnected then that feeling of imperfection comes back to us when you look at yourself and you say Lord war is me look look at me you know what you see when you do that that shows that somewhere you've disconnected yourself with God because the Bible said in the presence of the Lord there's joy forever more and whenever we find ourselves disconnected then we see ourselves and not not the god that we're hiding behind amen right is that right being under the blood means that God is our shield and our buckler as the prophet of God said God don't even see us he hear our voice so we we but being disconnected make us see differently we begin to see ourselves in Earthly ways instead of in a Heavenly way all right this is why it's so important it's important because you would be depressed you wouldn't be you wouldn't feel alone now let me tell you this this is part of maturing right this is part of maturing you know it's like okay uh son I'm going to cut the light off but Mama I'm I'm afraid of the dark well you don't say that when you're 12 13 14 15 years old I mean you might say it when you're a little toddler because you don't understand you have the power of that darkness and you know where the light switch is right so when it comes to to our maturing we also become matured in the place where we're not afraid of the dark right what light is afraid of the dark right so we we're not afraid we know where we going if we should die now we know where we're going right God just like we had never sinned the perfect sacrifice was made us made us perfect and you've got to believe that I'm saying that on myself you've got to believe that the sacrifice that you have have has made you perfect now we're going through a journey right we're maturing and God knows exactly how how could I put it this way God knows exactly how old you're going to become before he takes you amen and he knows the time when he finish with you amen right but the Bible says also that we supposed to consider the end of our faith a lot of time we look in the middle of it and we think how can I make it when the Bible said you've already make it made it when you're now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus these things are mature these are for uh the statements I'm making now are for mature Christians right then we're no more to be done see there's nothing else to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of God now there's where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what we was and as long as long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice means nothing to us see see the danger of looking back oh I used to be this I used to be that and oh and and the devil make you think you're the same person when God has changed you and then when you look back you just annulling your whole sacrifice as if Christ has done nothing for you you can't do that you can't allow Satan to make you believe you you the same person is telling God that he's not strong enough or his grace is not sufficient right so now there where we lose our positions we don't watch We're try to look back to where we was right I read that see the sacrifice mean nothing to us oh can't you see it church I would not try try the job I can't neither can you there's no need of trying you lost to begin with and as long as you look to what you've done but don't look to what you've done right as long as you look to what you've done but don't look to what you've done do y'all understand what he saying by your giving yourself to God you've done something you brought a change in your life don't mean I I thought to myself how many real Christians there are in this world small or lot we've got plenty of denominational we got plenty of so-call and confessed Christians but Christians are more than what we call church people right look what the day of Calvary did to you it paid your price it settles the question your sins be as Scarlet they're as white as snow red like Crimson white like wool whose mirror are you looking into right no matter what you've done or what you do you still sinless amen as long as you accept Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven Anything Is Forgiven is emitted and forgotten about we're the only ones that remember God don't remember and then we beat our heads in the wall Satan takes up stuff that you done confess for years ago and bring it back to you and you AC that nasty stuff amen and God is I would say God is scratching his head but he's not but you're actually uh telling God about something that he's actually forgotten amen that's you see now listen the 8 85th verse now the first thing I want to say and and I'm saying all of this because this ought to motivate us to want to die and rot to our own ourselves so that he would be reflected through US amen right because eternal life and I'm going to say this more than once tonight it's not living for you is living for others right you say you're a Christian but you got to realize if you are a Christian you must be like Christ and Christ came to live for who not himself for others he went hungry for others amen many times I'm sure he want wanted him his space but he couldn't have his space cuz his disciples was all around him he was tired he was weary right but you see by the grace of God I think that's all the water but by the grace of God he um he was able Amen to die to himself and there were times when God would give him the space to himself when it was needed but sometimes we do things with that when it's not needed amen I'm guilty I'm guilty now the first thing I want you to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's PR perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things thank you sir thank you and you do good things that's f but when you live for your your life to yourself you hav't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proves it when it comes to the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you you don't live for yourself no more you live for others Jes some someone said how can you stand let everybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were Sons you're Sons you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others that's the church and that that's you say oh I can do that you can let me tell you something it takes the Holy Ghost to do that Christ must be in you amen right it takes the selfishness away Ephesians please Ephesians 5 1 through 3 I'm jumping see you must move you must move I must move we must move away from the works of the flesh Ephesians 5 1 to3 be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also have loved us and have given himself for us and an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior but fornication and all uncleanliness or covetousness let it be not once name upon you among you as becometh Saints so you got to see that when you when you accepted your sacrifice you don't just remain Justified there's something in you that wants to be Sanctified and remember I said in the last lesson true sanctification is when God has taken all the evil desire out of you to do evil I'm waiting on the amen so once that desire to do evil is taken away then God can fill you and seal you with these virtues the cup must be cleansed and understand that many of the times that these desires are taken away by the trials you go through okay Ephesians 51 through 12 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them now what do you mean by that correct them reveal it revealed to the you know you find people in the church they hang with people that's doing bad and they well I'm not doing bad but you are because you hanging with the people that are and you won't expose them you won't correct them because you feel you're going to be rejected and you fail you fail to see that when you do that you going to be rejected but you're going to be rejected by the main one I'd rather be rejected by my friends than Goden yeah let them call me a holy rooll oh you think you great you think you and all you got to do is listen to them and they give you praise you think you better than us did I say or did you say that that's right right don't have fell you see the thing is it's not that you hating anybody you can't hate you got to love everybody but you got to hate their sin you got to hate their actions for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret God have mercy on us because of the world teaches us to talk about the things done in secret they love it gossip whatever you want to call it amen and and and and they train us to do it if we look at stuff that we shouldn't be looking at right so your mind must be kept pure and clean how you going to do that you must have a word here and a word word here to keep your mind clean Satan is going to going to battle your mind and the whole point about it is he's trying to stop your growth in Christ but he cannot amen the true seed of God will God will not allow to be deformed that's right we are here Amen to learn what we should be doing because I have been a Christian since high school days and I'm learning things that I'm not or I'm seeing things I've read the same scriptures but now I'm seeing things that oh my i' I've been negligent on this end and I've been negligent on that end and really you know what it's been all all about my pride not wanting to be rejected by others birds of a feather flock together and that's the truth for Years anyway we won't go there that would have been like a testimony but then I saw at the end of the day how these two people came together agreed and believed the same thing when I couldn't figure it out for years but at the end of the day these same two ministers walked away from the message then I understood birds of a feather flock together right so Ephesians 5:1 19-33 right speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and we must understand and this is how we keep ourselves amen all right when when Satan comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard you must have something as a wall of Defense excuse me and sometimes all you have is yourself and I don't know about you but there have been times I have been going through a storm or getting ready to embrace a storm or whatever the case may be and then all of a sudden a hym or something comes amen a song will come I could hear it amen and you know who's singing it where is it coming from surely the devil is not comforting me amen but you got to realize that your life is in God's hands it's a matter of life and death the thing that gets me is that who's ready and the Bible said the ride maketh herself ready that's right I don't care if I'm exposed by the word I just want the word to change me amen that's all I want I admit my aing WS I admit my faults and I know true that at all of my airing ways I have never been able to deliver myself amen it has always been the word but you see the truth of the matter is I've always been able to Humble by his grace I know where to go I look toward the heal for whence cometh my help and my Help Cometh From The Lord the Lord who is the maker of heaven and Earth so what is my problem the Bible said that the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run in and they are safe what if I appear righteous before you but then my heart is not then my life is in vain but I have to recognize that God did not call me on this Earth to be a message believer am cuz Satan is a message believer amen that's right I have come to live it amen and so have you and the only way you're going to be able is that the God who spoke that word lives in you amen right we've got all things to die out die out die out right staying in harmony with one another keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace let me ask you a question when has the last you witnessed to someone right this is not this message wasn't given to us to keep to us amen go you out into all the world that commission has never changed amen and he didn't say tell the people who you feel like is going to receive receive you he says no to all the world you're going to be rejected you're going to be despised people going to hate you but he said don't be alarmed about that they did it in the green they'll do it in the dry amen but you know what the problem is when we come to a place where we're afraid to tell the Gospel of Jesus Christ we have moved from out of the presence of God because I'm going to tell you even in times of persecution when those disciples and people throughout the fox's book of mar were being and ready to be killed they still confessed Jesus and many of them in their deaths won people to the Lord amen by their confession amen you said well that was there well we supposed to be us amen we supposed to have that Zeal and that stamina too amen but all of that comes with what l o v loving God Ephesians 4 3-7 I know I'm kind of moving around but we we getting ready to I got to move Endeavor endeavoring to keep the unity beginning at the third verse endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace that mean you got to work at it amen it doesn't come easily and how many times things come through this little assimile trying to bust it up break it up and people get so mad they don't even they'll get over it no they won't get over it and the Bible said even if you think a man has an art against you you go to him well I don't want to hurt their feeling well who else's feelings you hurting God want to see obedience that's right and obedience is better than sacrifice amen that's the trth and we do it and the more we do it the more the you know how anyway that the fire the the the the the devil fan the fire and often times because of people not falling in position and doing what they supposed to do it leads to Pastor when by the time he catch wind of the fire the fire is so gross and so big it's a mess amen and they'll look at him and say you put it out no no no if you read the scripture David's Army the one whom they converted Saul's Army into David's Army that's in Chronicles they kept in Step nobody got out of order amen they were one body and let me tell you something that's that's even in the natural you see those Russian soldiers when they marching with those Goose goose steps men they look Fierce and and they they they intimidates you and that's how it is when the army of God gets together on one Accord all hell shakes amen and that's why he keeps us the way it is because he knows if no house A House Divided can't stand and that's what I'm trying to tell the people you people I say it like this those of you who come to Bible studies those who come to prayer those few that comes on you know Wednesday night or whatever the case may be pull together amen y'all understand what I'm saying if nobody else do do it you do it and God don't need a many he said two or three amen and if we could just we will be a army that Satan will not be able to stop but will'll be bond together by what love and when you bond together about love with love there's no space for jealousy in The Strife endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body one spirit even as you are called into one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one family one family amen right now Earthly families they don't all get along together but they stay together but you find out the spiritual families they have the least little thing and everybody want to spit up and go their ways amen can't be God that's right not doing that one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and the father of all who is above all and through all and in you all well I ain't got nothing in common yes you do you got the greatest thing in common if you got it and that is the Holy Ghost you find a person oh well I can't just talk with you because all you're going to talk about is scripture didn't tell him go talk to his daddy that's right well that's what Joseph said to Billy Paul D that's all you talk about the Bible all the time what else I'm going to talk about amen now that's the best thing to do cuz if you don't you're going to end up talking about something else but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure uh of the gift of Christ so therefore what some people gets more grace than other that's right should I be jealous no I'm glad you got it right and and we need to understand that when Jesus is the judge there is no accusers amen remember the woman and he said woman where are your accusers that's right you know why because he knew all of them were guilty of sin amen and now one church member in here has a right to point someone else out because we are all sinners saved by grace if we could see that we can have a fellowship with one another better than what we have now now I'm saying all these things because I'm working with maturity I'm working with people who are ready to mature and recognize that so many things we have handled in our lives like children and now it's time to grow up amen it's time to grow up right now the thing about it is most of us we don't want to be we don't want to be submissive you know everybody got to have their own little you know well people well I'm Alpha I'm an alpha I'm a leader but the leaders got to submit too amen Jared said to Jesus Lord I'm a ruler I know what it is to say to a man do this and do that but Lord amen that's true righten so you got to submit to somebody and the best place to submit is to God and when you submit to God you submit to God's people come on somebody it's the truth submission is the action of or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force and to the will or authority of another person that's why Jesus said Lord not my will but thine be done right Christ the man Jesus Christ the man had an authority that was above his and that was a word and he submitted to the word and because of his submission we are enjoying life as it is now but most people don't understand submission and I'm coming to something in just a moment we think oh you can't tell me that and you know I look at people and I said you know one of the things that I find out you know when you call yourself brother Brooks so many people take advantage of you they don't know how to submit to brother but if I call myself Pastor oh Pastor you know what's the difference amen a name or the office that that people need to learn how to recognize you can't talk to a pastor or your the man that leads you any kind of way like he's just a t but we do it and when we disrespect the man of God you disrespecting God and we don't learn how to submit to the pastor you'll never learn how to submit to God people don't understand what submitting is because we we we don't we fail to see that these two are connected as we all are but we work together not separately you know um Jesus was such friends with his disciples to even Peter thought he could just voice his opinion and felt like it was okay right cuz when Jesus was telling him I'm got to die sometime that's right and Peter rebuked Jesus and says no that ain't going to happen and Jesus immediately saw it was the devil you understand me cuz really when the word is given you don't challenge it by your own thoughts and feelings you say Amen yes Lord right because when they did when he did that he said get thee behind me Satan now he wasn't calling Peter Satan but he looked beyond the man he didn't see he you know he saw the spirit because that Spirit was uh going against the word any spirit that goes against the word is the devil amen see see it is not now understanding submission it is not a sign of weakness because that's what people say he's just weak even if a pastor does it the way God wants him to do it oh he's just weak or a brother or a sister oh he or she is weak it is not a sign of weakness but a demonstration of trust and obedience in the Christian context submission primarily involves submitting to God's Will and Authority as well as humbly relating to others in various roles and relationships as we submit ourselves to God we submit ourselves to are Brothers and Sisters in Christ let me tell you something if the police stop you you better submit am and if you don't he'll make you submit but it's amazing the police don't have no no problem with most people they see that light coming they already praying and they already humbled amen because they know that if he's he's he's the authoritative figure he can bring judgment but if you give a soft answer in a spirit of Wrath it'll shut the devil down it confuses the devil when somebody screams and holler at you and you say now you know you shouldn't have said that in a sweet SP oh come on somebody but if you screaming holler you got it on that's right that's the way it works I've seen it work so many times in my life I'm working with with this now Romans 1210 to18 I know I'm moving fast I told you I ran into some things that really just enlighten me uh because I I'm changing amen and I'm happy to be that way um and I know the changes that are that's happening in me it it has a lot to do with the uh translation that we're getting ready to bark Embark upon you know it's amazing you see people and you know oh I'm trying to you know when a person say I'm trying to get closer to God all you got to do is watch them their actions will tell you what's really happening with them and to resist the word and do just what you want to do it shows you're not trying to get closer to God that's right even in a time of spanking you know what children do they grab and hug that their parents because they don't want that disconnection they know they've done something wrong but they want to be always feel connected that's how it is with those who are really born again and born of God even when God spanks us we want to be a closer walk with him Romans 12 10-18 haven't even got to my full scripture here be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one woo preferring one another that's right woo preferring one another kindly affectionate God help us all we need a l lot more of that be kindly affectionate one toward another with brother kind of no man don't give me no h yeah y'all know how y'all do and the brother just being kindly affectionate and then y'all you don't want it but that's what the word say be kindly you how you going to be affectionate oh affection is feeling is touch amen right and it's so amazing what our touch will do be kindly affectionate one toward another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another so you got to understand that there's a lot of stuff that needs to die and Rod what do we fear and I think many times we afraid of affection because we fear something within us and if that be true that needs to go amen God can't work with you in fear I mean I there have been years ago I you know you try to pull a brother to hug him and you you almost in an arm wrestle have anybody know what I'm talking about yeah you like oh okay then now the next time you come you going to do the same thing see what the devil does he breaks the word that's right when somebody do that to you next time you say you need to R read Romans 1210 see that I'm in the word and you're not not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord am amen right rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continually instant in prayer amen I could remember the first time a brother kissed me woo on the cheek okay it shook me and you know what I did I looked around to see who saw I didn't know how to respond and you know but but when you know a brother is spiritual and for some reason and God made him do that you move on with it now you may never instigate that but you got to receive it amen because he just do you know how difficult for a man to do that or even a sister with a sister now yeah we don't mix it like that but but you know people I've seen people I've seen sisters kiss each other on the JW and I've seen the sister do this but you see that's wrong we need to mature I'm just moving on I ain't going to work with those things but those are little things but it's always the little things that spoil the line because you never know down the road Satan might do something with you and then you realize well that brother loved me amen not SLO in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope hope for people patient and tribulation patience continuing instant in prayer oh my most of us have been knocked out already Distributing to the necessities of Saint given to hospitality right you're looking out of the curtain and make sure that person is someone that you want at the house y'all say y'all don't do it what you do every time you screen your phone to see whether you want to talk with that person or not it's like opening the curtain Cur or looking out the curtain before you answer the door same thing when you don't even know that that person might need your help or need your fellowship or need your friend your friendship bless them which what persecute you oh [Music] no do I get a winner persecute me no I'm gonna get you back uhuh if with that kind of thing that's not God that must die that's M must rot and we have all had some kind of inspiration like that I have had it but I've always learned how to pray through it bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep wait a minute now I'm talking about maturing we're talking about kids that that actually can go back years and say remember when you did that to me we got people who say they're in the message still holding grudges from people years ago and they think they're going to make a Rapture a't that something no you won't I'm here to tell you you won't because the word of God has come to you and when the word come to you light has been given to you if you were ignorant and didn't know but if you got the Holy Ghost there's no way you can't know cuz the Bible said that Holy Spirit will lead you and guide you into all truth always remember this if you can't remember on any other scripture only the pure in heart shall see God Amen keep your hearts pure bless them which persecute you bless and curse not you said well I don't curse them yes you do when you say oh you going to reap what you sold that's right you just cursed him you just cursed her right because if they just sold evil you just said you going to sow evil too that ain't our job to do that God will work with that accordingly right but it's our job to bless him you said well what do you mean Stephen what are you doing Lord hold not these things to their charge what did he do he blessed them because he understood it was the devil doing it if he had cursed that group of people do you know Paul would have been cursed you love the Lord let me move on I know I'm moving not as fast as I thought I would be you can you can give me 10 more minutes 20 minutes Rejoice with them that do Rejoice weep with them that we weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not hard things but condens in to them of lowest State be not wise in your own conceit and that's how it is some people even in this church won't even fellowship with somebody who's got less than they recompense to no man evil what for evil oh you did that you going nah that's immaturity provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all [Music] men you love the Lord let's move on let's move to the 21st chapter I mean 21st verse I think that's the fifth chapter I'm looking at we're talking about submitting yes 21st chapter the 5ifth verse so we'll get through that quickly are you being blessed any questions any questions remember the house of God is the place of judgment the word didn't come to make us feel good it came to cleanse us amen it didn't come to condemn you right because the Bible says there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ that's right but it did come to convict us to pull out those things in our lives that we that is wrong that we may repent and we may make right before God right because in the eyes of God you stand perfect amen that's right but in this life he wants you to prosper even as your soul Prosper so if we can see our soul prospering all of the other things will come with that submission and that's what I find out that that uh a lot of times as I said earlier people just don't know how to submit headstrong and stubborn and all of these things are not of God it they all must die you are a lamb not a goat but you got to be willing right it's all a will whosoever will let him come you got to be willing to die willing to rot willing and I know I know I know it hurts it hurts me sometimes when I see people despitefully using me disrespecting me all of the things that comes with the flesh amen and you know when I judge I said Lord God I'm I got too much life everything about this must die am because once you a dead man nothing anybody else do nothing anybody else would say or anything would move you cuz you're dead amen and that's the way I want to be dead to God to to the to the things my flesh myself that's right so dead that no matter what people do they said brother crazy let him do this he let him do that and the whole time I'm having joy in the Lord because I realized the man I used to be is no more thank God submit yourselves one to another in the what fear of God in that reverence wives submit yourselves unto your hus your own husbands as unto the Lord don't don't don't think I'm going to stop there on the wives but I do want you to know that is the will of God Amen as unto the Lord that means as long as he's telling you the things to do according to the Lord and the word you are to submit to it when he gets into his own little realm of thinking and telling you stuff that ain't supposed to no you don't have to do that everything according to the word amen yeah he can't stop you from going to church he can't stop you from praying he can't stop you from doing nothing cuz God always come first amen right so when he tried to make you serve him above God then he's foolish that's right that won't work you got to serve God then your husband right wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now remember these are talk he's talking to people who are married in the church you're not talking about a Believer and a non-believer that's two different cases here that's right right but remember the Bible says that you can save your unbelieving spouse by the life you live amen that will cause them to repent if there to be if they're savable now if they're savable you won't know that if you don't live it before him the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything y'all know how is sisters I ain't number two in here but still when we took that Veil off we were saying that the Man became our head woo right and people say well I'm the neck I can make the head turn see that ain't scriptural even though they do but my point is this you you've got to learn and and this is not easy because we're living in a Time the anointing is on the women to be the boss that's right to be the one that control you're living in latery this is a woman's age woman this woman that woman that and woman live what you've been liberated from is the word of God you don't want to be liberated from the word you want to be brought to the word stay under the headship of the word but all the Liberals now are free of the word so they can Bob their hair they can wear their paint they can do all these things and feel like they don't have to give an account to nobody and they fail to see one day they're going to give an account that's right and that's to God you understand me don't get quiet I I I I'm going hurry up I'm going hurry up therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wise be to their own husbands in everything their own husbands now no man can come in your house and boss your wife around now not even the pastor and I know some people they make their pastors have more Authority than their husbands that ain't what the scripture says their husband is their husband not the pastor well my pastor I'mma talk now you want to make me mad y'all understand what I'm saying it'll make any man mad or angry if his wife give more honor to the pastor than her own husband that's out of the institution of God her husband you said what he's the husband of the church yeah keep it spiritual yall understand what I'm saying therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything and I'm saying that because I've seen pastors break up marriages I've seen them do it husbands loves your wives and oh I was a woman Pastor well yeah I think you need to do this I think you need your question should be why you thinking that why you want me to do that right cuz sometimes y'all know what it is husband loves your wives even as Christ loves the church and gave himself for it so we have to love that have that connection I I give honors to to my wife today during my time of Affliction she was right on it just there one thing I know about her she she all she knows how to make me feel like a baby you know she's a real mother and a real wife and I really appreciate you know her when she do stuff like that it just I think God allow those things to say okay your eyes is getting a little clothes here you need to reopen you know reopen and evaluate see what you have instead of accounting and looking at and taking things for granted husband loved your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word and I didn't know what I had but I didn't want her to catch it she says oh I'm all right it's somehow faith kicks in with a wife or woman when it comes to sickness in the house they become the Red Cross you know that's right nothing can touch him that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot wrinkle or y'all know what a washing by the water of the word means the husband governs the wife by the word not because I'm the boss by the word he he he sees her he watches her he cleanses her by taking the word and said honey the Bible said not me but this is what the word says and this is how he washes her not by anything else other than the word so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the Lord the church y'all know and and I'm rushing but but I'm coming to an end for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bone for this CA shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be join unto his unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh hello so you know that in all of this I sound like sister Angela didn't but that's where I got it from I caught it as I said it but the point is when a husband and wife marry one this is the art of the church we don't marry the family and husbands need to know that when when you marry a wife mama ain't in the middle amen and and mothers wives you must know that when you marry a husband your daddy is not in the middle am this is not a marriage like they have overseas when you marry one you marry the family that's not scriptural it's not and you're not supposed to be telling all your business to your family the Bible said you leave that you start your own function amen and that's what people find hard when brother Brandon was getting married and marry that old that young couple that was so poor that was one of the questions he asked her now if your husband can't if your husband can't you know provide for you or something happened to his job will you run back to your mama she says no sir I'll stick right with him see that's a real marriage rich or poor better for Words hey when we when take those vows we don't know that better for words is coming we don't know that rich and poor can become that just that you know and but but we make those vows because we know circumstances do change all right can I have five more minutes amen okay I'm almost done this is a great mystery but I speak concerning the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife sees that she renc her husband right and what man is going to go out here and buy himself a suit and wouldn't want to want want to see his wife in something nice amen you know one thing about I'm not don't mean to but she's here cuz I talk about her when she's not here so I'm not talk about it while she's here my wife doesn't require much she's not a big jewelry person she's not a fancy she doesn't love all that fancy stuff I mean you know if somebody give her a nice dress so she she she'll wear it but she all she don't care for all that glitter and gold stuff you understand what I'm saying but I always I I love to see her get something new and many times and she'll tell you the truth I've given her money they do things with and she give it to the children our grandkids need this you know me that's what they do but that's good character right we have no excuse to hate each other when it comes to marriage there are those who hate each other now let me say it like like this you can't govern a person if they hate you but we have no right to hate them back and my point is if we have those things situated in us that's why the word comes to shine that light because you don't want listen I put it this way if I go to hell I want it to be my fault I want it to be nobody else's you understand me well you're going because you didn't forgive that person no no no no what Am I who am I right every time I hear this thing he that without sin Let Him cast the first stone I can't help but to than that in all my Christian walk since I was you know just graduating out of high school I became a Christian and I've made tons of mistakes and I've had many offenses and yet I could truly say that I have no bildings in my heart toward anyone I could not have done that no way God did it and the reason why I say I can stand and say that because when I know that there's bitterness in my heart I go on my knees and pray I pray and when I see the devil you know how the devil does when he want you to accept something he's always forceful and when he's forceful he's bringing that same thought where you know they meant to do it and they did it this way and they didn't care how they did it and and if you don't stop that force from penetrating your mind it's going to drop into your heart that's right and once it drop into your heart your feelings going to turn toward that person just the same as he's feeling toward you you going to feel toward that person right and when you do that now Satan got you in a a cage and you can't get out until you say Lord have mercy on me amen right live for the man who hates you brother random says live for the person who would kill you if they could ameno that's what they don't know they that's what they done to him they killed him right this is coming from the message that day of Calvary paragraph 88 that's what they done to him they killed him he died that he might might save them that eternal life when you that is in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you your sacri you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on toward Calvary I hope this help you to get in a place that that's what the Tabernacle see that's what all people has to got to do is find out what you are and what the purpose Church it isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he lived and that's wonderful right take up your cross amen and follow me people are you just weak to be a Christian you can't be weak that's right if you're a real Christian you one of the strongest people in the world it's either to go do something wrong it's difficult to do right you understand me if until that nature is Chang [Music] changed until that nature is changed you going to battle but he that knoweth to do good and doeth is not to him is sin and so you make fall but you get up don't ever be ashamed of to say I'm sorry because if you can't say I'm sorry and forgive me to your brother or your sister that's the way you are with God Amen that's the way you are with God and however you treat your brother and sister is how you treat God is that the truth that's the word the Bible say however you do it as such as youve done to the least of them you've done it unto me and remember at the Judgment brother Brandon brings it out in that message he says that's he says God will separate the sheep from the goat amen he put the goat on the left and the Sheep on the right and he said to the goat basically you depart for me you know you workers of iniquity you know you you're doomed and he basically says when I was hungry you didn't feed me when I was naked you didn't closee me am when I was sick you didn't visit me that's right see he's he going through all of these things that people know to do and they won't do amen and then he goes over to the sheep and he says when I was hungry you fed me when I was clothed need clothing you you when I was naked you clothed me see he went all of these things and then the Sheep says Lord when did we do all these things see brother brandom said you got to this got this kind this kind of stuff like okay I give him $50 because I know I'm going to reap a hundred no you do this thing so easily you don't even think about it you don't don't even look for returns but Christians want to be Church Christians they don't want to be real Christians and I hope tonight I said something to each and every one of you that would make you go out of here says Lord I want to be a real Christian I want to die to myself I want to ride to myself I want to be like Paul that said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me that's what I want brother said he he wanted to be such a shell all I want to be is a shell that God can use you love the Lord and that's why God put a man and a woman together see before Adam and Eve they walked together in harmony but we have no idea what it was like after the fall but we do see what it is now and we see how Satan has basically destroyed mankind because the the house has fallen apart and it's so difficult now because everybody feel I got a right I got a right I got a right and you know when you come to Jesus you got to forfeit all your rights than you lord your rights become wrong in the eyes of Jesus so you you forfeit all of that let me tell you something God will never and I'm closing on the statement God will never cause you to give up something that he will not give you something greater and you know what God always give you interest always always let's stand have faith in God hold fast your confidence let's end with a word of prayer tonight dear heavenly father we come before you as humbly as we know how we took a lot more time tonight forgive us I wanted to get through this fifth chapter rush through it a little bit but I feel like things were said tonight that will make us see that if we're not careful we'll do the same as the Pentecostals of this age we forgot the true calling and the true calling of this message to is to let our light so shine amongst men and that light is you that light is the gospel we come to win souls and not to discourage them we come to suffer that we might reign with you help us now Jesus to take our eyes off of the all of the world and place our eyes on you and by doing so you said if we seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness that all of these things will be added to us so may the Holy Spirit from this day forward keep us focused make us wise make it real to us that we know that there's no failure in God and there's no fooling you you see us Lord you know the very intent of our hearts uh before we say or do anything and so my God all I desire I believe this is what we desire tonight is to have that Ephesian experience where we can love our brothers and love our enemies do good to those that despitefully use us and hate us Lord this is Christ this is what a real Christian is and this real Christians no matter what we must go through to become that or to reflect that this is what we want we don't want to live to ourselves Lord we want to live our lives for others may we become Bolder with the gospel Bolder with our convictions Bolder with the word that we may shine among men
