world praise the Lord we thank you Roger the musicians and the song leader yeah the director of the song most of all we thank you for entering into worship we're going to be coming from two passages of scriptures if you would stand in order honor of the world first John the fourth chapter we read the fourth verse ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you amen then he that is in the world is amen amen John 12 John chapter 22-21 University and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast yes [Music] the saying came therefore to Philip which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus let us pray our gracious father we come to you as humble as we know how we know we thank you for being so good to us you awoke us this morning and you place this message on our heart and Lord in obedience to your will we will preach this word according to your inspiration bless the service this morning bless the hero of the word not only will we be hearers of the world come Lord bless those that are sick bless those that are Disturbed in the spirit that each and every one of us with a great blessing from you depending upon amen amen you may be seated I'm going to be doing a lot of quoting so I trust that you'll follow me by the grace of God because I want you to know this morning the words in which I preach they're not my words Hallelujah but they are God's words I have a subject this morning a reflection of himself reflection we realized this morning that we are in uh a turning at a turning point brother Branham tried to describe this to us he tried to explain this to us through the messages after the seals were opened amen the music sheet changed like further museums and not backwards in order for us to be a partakers they will not in laodice we're not of the old Pentecostal order brought us to a place hallelujah amen remember the story the Hebrew boys brother Bradham said there was so much like him that when they were in the fire when they saw the Hebrew boys selection of the Son of God hallelujah amen you see when I'm in the fire people to see the reflections I don't want them to see my troubles you love the Lord see we are identified with the he said and in the mirror on this side foreign [Music] it's the word of [Applause] that is a perfect example foreign see we living low up yeah a dime a dozen this is a word the Bible says like I said yesterday you can have this whole world you can have your mansions [Music] coming from the message statues of a perfect man 62. dude says a body has not prepared me um God dwells in the Statue of a man connecting himself perfect worship he said it's perfect Hallelujah being his Tabernacle manifesting how we could stay on that okay you will almost suffocate in here oh my God always reflected himself amen is that right Chevrolet what is it just say Hallelujah like I said I'm just gonna I'm you're gonna you have to know this is the message okay God Drew reflecting himself so if we don't remember those prophets don't say Prophet Hallelujah he wasn't just Daniels it wasn't just Joshua it wasn't Moses it was God in Moses and if you ever do anything for God hallelujah Then There came he said that God reflected himself in those prophets reflecting Christ if they don't Christian Then There came one perfect Perfection of God Among Us and since that time he has reflected himself in his church that's where we have the problems that's right he has reflected himself in his church first we have faith virtue knowledge goodness [Applause] Hallelujah yeah is that right you're right they fall short saying you're not a Christian like this don't work on it you've got to surrender to the Holy Spirit you love the Lord amen because God in this day like God made brother Brown I'm a partner come to make his bride apart hallelujah amen Souls that are in prison now please partnership and this is the restaurant Eternal Spirits because God reflected himself back in that to reflect remember that he becomes a man when he became and he was God was in Christ that she lived in him considering the world to himself I believe in God we accept his profession because we accept his perfection foreign hallelujah amen glory to God Roger our standard is the word of God revealed y'all hear what I'm saying that's what takes us Beyond Pentacles amen the seals have been opened listening now we see the naked words hey man coming from the message ever present Waters from the Rockies Hallelujah now it's paragraph 71. the Republic see we gotta understand this thing is great you come up out of foreign foreign hallelujah hallelujah man communion you know we we love communion everybody shows up at Communion you know that's not true hallelujah amen but really communion is a Catholic word it was ordained or established by the Catholics did he give you that little culture that little piece of bread [Music] it's not communion and it's far far from community look at the prophecies he appeared to Eve told her the Lord said this the Lord said this but he disagreed with God and that's the way false communion does this is when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the words should I read that one again yeah hallelujah amen he appeared to ease as an angel of Light foreign glory to God we need some checking up on ourselves you know he said in another place he said if you don't pray every day and if you don't reach your life Hallelujah and then you think you're gonna get some from God that's a false Community it is he is not just on the pages don't let me say it like this are you becoming since the message can you see the likeness of Jesus Christ in you and if you can see Jesus [Applause] he must be reflected but my question is what are you reflecting think about it what are you reflecting hallelujah amen first John go back to our yes first John 4. I'll take scripture Hallelujah he told me to minister this word I had other thoughts and and we're going to continue your thoughts here I don't know what other preachers nobody tells me to preachers yes I have to give an account for this assembly so if I say anything that's contrary to what you've been taught I just say excuse me Hallelujah but I trust that I'm not saying anything contrary to the word of God hallelujah yeah of God little children foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we cannot even measure ourselves man this is no joke it's a reality you gotta meditate on it you gotta commune with him three Hebrew boys walk right into a Fireballs obey the sons and daughters but he said if you love me whatsoever you asked believing that you shall received that's when you're connected to it that's when you have become a partner partnership those Greeks you see Greg in Saint John 12 20 and 21. they didn't they didn't come to Jesus here here are intellectual service come to Jesus to see some scientific proof from anything Amen to those Jews they say we want to see Jesus people don't come to church or intellectualism they don't come to hear a grand preacher in events [Music] she is easy for us to say it but it must become a reality when Jesus said when you see me the bride must come to that but we'll put it just down brother Brown your man sent this please [Applause] Hallelujah Jesus is not God is not dead brother Brandon is not either but brother Branham is not God y'all understand me amen not in that sense not they are see God wants to see his true Reflections I can see Jesus and Mama she revises hmm oh Hallelujah glory to God second Corinthians 4. in some places the message has become a traditional in some hearts he don't become a tradition God has no power to it Hallelujah Traditions can't save you the tradition Hallelujah under the blood of Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying man because if tradition could save you but because of their tradition they failed to see Jesus and Jesus said except you believe that I am here amen you know we supposed to come to church all of your issues second Corinthians somehow we better stir it back up you've heard me use this analysis before my mom used to make Kool-Aid you know when you when you Stir It Up at first that Kool-Aid is delicious it goes to the bottom if you just poured it out of the picture like that where is the sugars maybe the sugars foreign looking at people all the time they look like they mad all the time they do like where's the smile yeah I think people think they're sinning when they smile oh God help us Jesus second Corinthians 4 3-5 it's a description but I'm gonna bring you something it is here to them that are lost Jesus Christ of Christ the Christ of Christ the Christ who is the image of God who is the image of God can you be like Christ how can you be like God you need the anointing it's not enough we should be the most anointed people in the world you know I'm gonna tell you something what covert did for most of us to know that I was lacking monkey cause I'm gonna tell you something I was scared I was afraid now y'all gonna be honest right you did not give me the spirit of foreign I was almost carrying my life so everywhere I win hallelujah it's the truth I won't go into it deep but there there it is second Corinthians they're going down I'm sorry First Corinthians two second chapter now now we look at the gospel just being preached but it's more than words it's more than word according to the definition Hallelujah and he said my speeches you know no matter how what much a preacher preached a person that can believe foreign Hallelujah should not stand in the wisdom of men oh God huh not in the wisdom of me but in the power of God but I find out that people's message you don't see much God wisdom hallelujah amen and we're doing the same thing people can put the word together if you don't know put your ABCs [Music] if we're gonna be Christians let's be real soon don't play with it we're going to be Christians let's be real soon for we preaching not ourselves Paul says Paul said I'm not preaching we preach we're not preaching you know these Apostles and whoever else we are not preaching ours but Christ Jesus the Lord let me tell you something I'm preaching Christ Jesus Christ and that offends you it's the levels of you are the Antichrist is it anti-christa if the name of Jesus Christ you are antichristo hello let me say it like this everything he did in the name Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you see I'm going to preach the gospels of Jesus Christ amen [Music] and the reason why I follow brother Brandon because brother Branham followed Christo Hallelujah oh I feel like running around here but I gotta preach hallelujah amen he said but we preach not ourselves your servants for Jesus sake to climb that ladder just stay where we are to your faith knowledge is always we've got to come to a place oh the life that's in you see that's the thing we see you you know Christians when you don't do you don't do right we see you see me yes we've got to die and ride to the point that nobody sees us brother man who said it sorry we would see Jesus Hallelujah you love the Lord now according to the scripture we are supposed to be written Epistles [Music] the Bible says that we are ridden Epistles and if tonight you would hunger and thirst to see the Lord Jesus Christ till it would be his entire representation represented Christian should be he representative the life of Jesus Christ he said do you believe that I believe that every Christian should be reflecting The Life of Christ amen he said in Saint John 14 12. believe on me and then we know that that's true that we are his Representatives if we claim that Christ lives in us if Christ lives in us then we should be we then we should do as Christ did we reflected I'm not talking about on a Sunday I'm talking about it on Sundays everybody become actors Hallelujah he said what if I said tonight the life of Shakespeare Shakespeare what if I said Shakespeare lived in me now Shakespeare lived in me oh you said Shakespeare lived in you all right so you would write the poems that Shakespeare wrote um he can't make it any clearer imagine [Music] amen am I the only one that's true I know I'm not sure sometimes the Lord wakes me up at night and tell me things that people are thinking and then tells me don't say nothing I'm no Prophet Supreme Prophet but I am a son of God hallelujah amen because Beethoven Lives in You you're not yourself now you are Beethoven or you Shakespeare Shakespeare now is this right to say there were times brother Brandon wasn't brother Branham he was Jesus Christ better watch that boy foreign because Jesus Christ was standing there in here I'm not talking about the Flesh of the man Hallelujah but Jesus stood there he tried to tell us and he said Christ must be in you what is he talking about Jesus Christ don't be afraid of what the Bible said the whole heavy heaven [Applause] but the problem look I'm trying to get you to see them God in you the hope of glory I'm trying to tell you she said we got to move up the ladder stop being church members recognize who we are let me tell you something that you can't add one cubit to your statues amen like they say he's a way maker [Music] Hallelujah is that right amen Oh my he can change the heart amen glory to God you brother random said it like this and if Christ lives in you there you are she The Life of Christ you live it's just that way if he lives in you but you can't live in there with him we want to live in there with him he said you can't do it when I saw that I said oh God forgive me you can't live in there with him he's got to live
