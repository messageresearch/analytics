good to us glad to have everybody here tonight and we're going to take you to try to take it a little slower than we did amen by the grace of God on Sunday I did not announce this but I intended to um I was thinking about having um communion on this Sunday I don't know who would all be here is there any special thing happening on Sunday that we cannot okay for those who will show up we'll have a second service on Sunday he's on and does themselves and we will have communion for those who would like to have communion foot washing and and and and everything so let us spread the word and maybe we can announce it by the grace of God and for those who can show those who can be uh here we we would love to have you I'm sorry about the grace of God it's been a while since we've had communions we need to make sure we stay within the word you love the Lord [Music] um we'll start at 3 3 30 normal we normally start at three right yeah anyway yes as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to First Corinthians thank God for the musicians yeah there's a lot of things that I want to say I will try my best to not get excited too excited foreign this is how many of y'all believe we're living in the last days I believe that with all of my harsh questions God in his greatness the more I think about my salvation the priest responsible what he's done for me I'm sure things that people want you you go through this throughout the day that God wasn't going to risk savaku Jr it's a Redemption plan with not even the greatest of all angels we know that God came down himself as our Prophet said I didn't use even the secretary he came down himself remember so First Corinthians for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ Philippians 2 or Philippians five through six we also sanctuary and it reads let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God existence let us pray our heavenly father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for how you are leading us thank you for your guidance thank you for your protection even as that song saved for for providing for us you are still the same usually remember a God that never changes Lord we believe there's Hallelujah with all of our hearts we thank you Father God for your accusing for us this last day to manifest Your Glory Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated my I like to entitle this message and you wonder why um working with the word Enoch this name is first of all he was the seventh generation from Adam which places Us in the seventh City Church age and it was during this time that God had a Prophet by the name of Enoch could you imagine and brother Branham tells us that Enoch was a type of the Bride [Music] for those of us who may not know the meaning of Enoch so the name Enoch means dedicated trained for me and discipline a discipline I'm gonna say that again Enoch means dedicated train for me and discipline a discipline and you know and I know brother Branham said the Bride Comes to be tested and we know by God's grace that the one who's testing us is actually God himself in the message God provided place of worship 1965. paragraph 140 the biographer uh brother Branham says it like this let's take a man here that kept all the word of God back in the Old Testament by the name of Enoch he was so quickened by the word of God that he had a testimony that he pleased to there wasn't one thing that God commanded Enoch to do now what he did because y'all understand me let me read this let me read this last portion again there wasn't one thing that God commanded Enoch to do but what he did because Hallelujah so we said well what do you mean brother Brooks if we if that is the shadow city of what we're to be we're to be the real thing the students done what he did they had to be a blood sacrifice the song uh you must realize that the true seed of God Hallelujah [Music] because it is not us that is perfect it is a sacrifice that is perfect Hallelujah this is what made Enoch perfect he had a blood sacrifice it doesn't mean that he didn't make mistakes but for certain death has been only one man that has been perfect and that's Jesus Christ himself he's to remember and when John Amen in the Book of Revelation when he heard the word who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals the Bible said that there were none worthy Hallelujah not even Enoch it was not worthy but he had a worthy sacrifice I'm trying to get some nothing here tonight I want you to be free the devil do not want you to be free it's never been here even though we try to live right for them who knows to do good and do it tonight to them it is the prophet of God says we will make mistakes Hallelujah but you say I've got the Holy Ghost even with the Holy Ghost you make mistakes Hallelujah but we have a perfect lamb we have a perfect sacrifice and because we know who he is and what he is hallelujah we have been set free of the life of God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen all right that's it Hallelujah because of the blood there is remission of sins because the Bible said without the blood there is no remission and the blood we are Justified as though we've never seen in the first place I'm not talking about a mental thing here I'm talking about people who know they've got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah when you receive the Holy Ghost when the Seal of the Holy Ghost is placed in your heart as though you've never seen in the first place because of the blood we have total salvation let me put it this way because of the life of the blood we have total salvation it is the life of the blood somebody [Music] because of this sacrifice according to sacrifice we can be translated he declared he was the and the Bible tells us according to John the first chapter that Jesus Christ he is Hallelujah [Music] and that same God is to remember is alive today by the blood sacrifice you see Enoch had a shadow he had a little lambs we've got the real Hallelujah [Music] [Music] thank you Lord hallelujah because of the Lamb of God or because of this lamb we have a new life Hallelujah did y'all think possible Enoch was born perfect no no he was born of a woman he was born in sin just like Hallelujah it doesn't say when God came to Enoch when and what time God called him Hallelujah now Enoch was by himself I don't know where Noah was what I can say is that Enoch was the only one in the whole world that was translated one man out of the entire world walk with God hallelujah what was it Hallelujah and it had to have been a revelation that was that that wasn't given to Noah Hallelujah no way even though they were in the same we would say the same age is that right because Enoch represents in a way represents the church the foolish virgins and we are coexisting right now Hallelujah but one of these old days because we have a revelation and we have a Revelations because he promised to do so Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah and the Bible says he whom the son I love the scripture and set free it's free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Hallelujah remember I think it's um Romans the first chapter no I'm sorry it's Ephesians the first chapter all the Apostle says that he was called by God you understand me he wasn't called by a bishop he wasn't even called by a uh and because he was called by God that made him free from the political realm from all this politics from the power and authority of Life y'all better hear what I'm saying and the Bride of Jesus Christ she's called by God amen oh Jesus the reason why I'm preaching these messages is to Hallelujah [Music] as Christians I'm preaching these uh messages also to stimulate your faith to recognize we're living in an age and the spirits of this age is literally taking people away you must be aware of the spirit that is influencing you Hallelujah is that right okay see it was evil evil very evil in the days of Enoch it was very evil in the days how can I say it he was predestinated he was elected he was chosen to make a rapture and Noah was not in New England even though Noah was saying he did not have the Revelation that Enoch had no way heard the voice of God walked with God hallelujah that means do you have it foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm talking about I'm talking about the same Holy Ghost about to remember because I want to share something with you Enoch Enoch had the ability to do something that had not yet been done since the fall of Man say where do you get this from I want you to think about it Adam had the mind of God and Enoch had the mind of God by Revelation Enoch knew exactly you know what God wanted what God required and brothers said everything God required him to do the foreign [Music] the Holy Ghost truth only sentence God is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah see we're here because we often preach about Noah but we never hardly ever hear about Enoch news he's in the message doesn't say much about him but if you search the quotes if you search the scriptures to find out he says some good things about it and then we find out that Enoch Amen in the book of Jude began to say things that no other ones could say he began to talk about the destruction he talks about the the church that would have two kinds of Believers he also talk about those who are ordained to be vessels of Dishonor and those who are vessels of Honor Hallelujah and he began to [Music] and anybody couldn't go back [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah he became my nakedness that I might be clothed with his righteousness Hallelujah [Music] [Music] but you see the most important thing is important that you and I must come to understand is a revelation of our Perfection do not perfection and that's that's true right because we realize our Perfection is not by works even though let me see we try our best to live the way he wants us to live you can't even do it because the Bible says our righteousness is as filthy rice see when you come to see it's just sacrifice it's a blood sacrifice that God recognizes when I see the blood pass over you not when I see your works not when I see your Deeds not when I see what church you go to is when I see the blood I will pass over you Hallelujah [Music] when you know you mess up every day Hallelujah [Music] [Music] his holiness [Music] I get stirred I'm sorry [Laughter] his Holiness is my Holiness for I am Holy the prophet God said there is no way without the Holy Ghost that's why the devil don't want people to get the Holy Ghost he don't care if you're sanctified you but when you see that shine [Music] wherever you may be when you get serious with God I was going to try everything [Music] but I'm here to tell you nothing can stop this Hallelujah you've been predestinated you've been ordained together and even brother Branham said God want to give it to you more than you wanted but listen listen the devil don't want you to know you're free so many people you're afraid Hallelujah why are you afraid if God called you and you answered he predestinated you didn't come to God I came to you you didn't choose God amen hallelujah we don't have to fear the devil is that all right how do you say it I said like he says no matter what God will make it happen that's not exactly the way he said it respect at the moment but basically he was saying nothing can hinder the plan of God hallelujah oh Jesus yes we want to be holy we want to be like him that's what our thirst is but think about it he gave you the things Hallelujah yes sir oh my God see the Bible tells us we were we were in him and we we are still in snooze the Bible said as he is God never sees it hallelujah amen amen that's it amen amen what are you talking about you can't be Sanctified it's unsanctified at the same time you can't be holy at the same time y'all understand me what do you think the blood is all about yeah you may have what you might wipe it off Hallelujah he didn't put it where it could be spoiled he put it in a place but what we fail to see Having the Holy Ghost is not just shouting and dancing I've already sent this episode all those things but God gave you the Holy Ghost Jesus to resist the devil's thoughts God gave you the Holy Ghost to resist the devil's thoughts and I'm gonna explain this to you because when Adam and Eve the words of the serpent the serpent became their headship Adam lost his headship is that right and even though God remembers talk to Adam now Adam even though I know that was contrary to the world and everybody after that y'all hear what I'm saying you say well what are you I got scripture for this the Bible said who knew you almost to obey this is and if you hear your members to The Devils that's right Hallelujah foreign for sin shall not have dominion over you 14th verse I'm sorry Romans 6 14. romances for ye are not under the law but on the grace shall we sing because we are not under the law put on the grace God forbids your serves [Music] weather of sin unto death unto righteousness you have a choice even with the Holy ghosts into where you are you have to go out he can't come in he came under the blood he becomes a brother Michael yeah to hear his temptation so let me show you what I'm saying but the battle said it like this he said Moses problem or his weakness was his temper today they got him in the temple police he said but Jesus his weakness was Hunger he like to eat as a man he like to eat so the devil thought he was going to try him with the bread you see the stone turn the stone into bread and the devil waited till he got weak he was hungry in February and then the devil came to tempt him Hallelujah but he was Unbreakable [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] the devil amen [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah see that's what God that's what happened with the early church they got away exactly discrimity from the name of Jesus Hallelujah you got to go back to that name is that right is it right brother Adam said it he told us that he was like he said he was among some witches and he said that the the the medium whatever she was she had these chairs and there were men trying to pull the chairs and this witch challenged him Hallelujah said I heard you got power and that you can bring these things down he said no I don't have no power Hallelujah but my power is in the name of Jesus Christ I'm paraphrasing it he said in the name [Music] let this mind be in you that's cool thank you the blood still prevails Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah see our Perfection and what does God do with preparing us learning by the power and the authority of the Holy ghosts but the only way you can know his thoughts you got to study his words you got to study his word you gotta listen to the tapes you gotta understand God put you in this place [Music] you know what I'm saying so we come into this place and say wait wait wait wait so what is he doing now he's teaching us as we mature y'all remember when your kids [Music] you didn't know what how Daddy thinks but it came through training and some spankings for you to come to understand how your parents think so when the devil would come to you to try to make you do something that you but we do understand Hallelujah everything has been ordained for you and me to bring us to Perfection hallelujah amen you can't have long suffering without suffering long um huh long suffering it's one of the virtues you must in the Statue of a perfect man you got to shuffle along Hallelujah in order to be long suffering living in a day where we got microwaves and we don't even have patience with the microwave action says two minutes and we'll wait to a minute and a half open up the afternoon is it ready no it said two minutes y'all understand me Hallelujah it is what it is I'll tell you what I've had situations running late and I know the way these traffic lights run as you say come on but for some reason those traffic lights to hurry up only when you're late [Music] knowledge the Lord in all your way compound the life in you is supposed to produce the righteousness you say you got the Holy Ghost this is free the life in you produces the fruit oh it's really free right you don't see a tree go shopping the apples are already in the tree one thing the tree learns how to do is our biggest problem is Christians we don't know how to yield the Holy Ghost amen amen is that right Savoy God had to teach brother Branham God said I think it was India and he went to uh he was supposed to go to Africa he went to India and the angel of the Lord told him don't go there and he went anyway had a powerful service yeah but he called amoeba yeah y'all hear what I'm saying God had to teach him do what I said regardless to the pressure don't let peer pressure make you live a different way what the Holy Ghost would have you live you understand me don't let peer pressure when you want to worship God worship God hallelujah don't let the people in the [Music] churches before the Lord we are the glory glory of God hallelujah amen it's just not healing in Miracles but we're the greatest of all the glory minutes [Music] is the very glory of God amen amen hallelujah glory to God give me a five more minutes I'm gonna come to this scripture Ephesians 1 Ephesians because I wanna I wanna and there's no way I can finish but I'll pick it up next because I want you to understand that Enoch didn't work his way to heaven the Bible says by faith he was translated not by works by faith he was translated huh I'm gonna say it again Enoch did not work his himself to Heavenly remember the Bible says faith what what you mean he believed God whatever God said he believed it that's your True Believer he believes he may not understand it but he believes I don't know how I'm gonna make a Rapture but I believe I don't know how to be changed he promised it hallelujah amen he promised it Hallelujah oh I feel like dancing y'all have no idea I don't see everything Paul pauler the first verse Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are Ephesus into the faithful you'll Fidelity in Christ Jesus Christ y'all remember the time Paul had trying to make the other Christians no it's a Christian he called by God hallelujah they didn't like him they didn't trust him in Hallelujah but Paul knew he was called by God you must have that conviction in you I know Hallelujah man regardless to what other people say people can look at you and characterize you but you're not concerned about what they think of you the man in the balcony is Jesus Christ that you're living for nobody else listen the Bible says Grace be to you like us now is he talking to you are you I'm you you I'm you you yeah great great speak to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ so when the devil tries to accuse you go back here say the word says give was given unto me who by the father and for my Lord Jesus Christ I got quotes on it but let me tell you it is a true say right eternal security since insecurity once you don't see the Holy Ghost everything is secure do this security it can't be broken it has to go directly [Laughter] Amen to the place designated I don't know what is the name Hallelujah that's the truth that's what Jesus did for it it ought to make you love him even more know that every time I make a mistake Hallelujah foreign [Music] so therefore I talked to God every day and that's the way it's supposed to be with all of us now here we go blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings blessed me in my business with faith knowledge all spiritual blessings it may not manifest right now but I'm blessed with it yeah it's been given to me it's yours and the devil can't stop it he can't stop it cannot come back boys [Music] and we go back to God it cannot stop amen yes let me tell you young Brothers many of us have uh I say many of us we have our issues there are things that may be holding to you so the devil says you're not going to get free to Diablo I was born free [Music] [Music] [Music] could hold his body sir [Music] [Music] that cannot be broken and This Promise was given to us before the foundation of the world Hallelujah yes I'm almost done accordingly has where was all spiritual Essence in Christ in the Holy Ghost In Christ in Heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Hallelujah you and how we just didn't become Christians we just didn't know it is [Music] but that little bit of God of God it's a whole lot of God y'all hear what I'm saying absolutely absolutely and we constantly looking at our flesh well let me say it like this if you're waiting for your flesh to be converted it'll never happen your flesh cannot be converted your flesh has been condemned and God got it attached to you to train you before for me Hallelujah that's your trainer you is that part of you God uses to train you with it for me Hallelujah but one what but what the devil don't understand and I'm getting ready to close that power of the holy spirit that Christ in US is maturing is beginning to see who he he is and her love and his love it's becoming more and greater for God in God's word we're in a place right now we're trying to drop all of the foolishness Hallelujah is that right right it's kind of like what God Said to job the job had gone through all these things girdle thyself like a man and give me an answer he said where were you he said I demand an answer where was thou oh it's the truth when I laid the foundation of the earth declare dealer if thou has understanding Hallelujah job couldn't answer the questions but God in this last day answer the question I can truly say he was with you when the sons and gods began to shouts [Music] also Hallelujah when I saw that my sin death had been paid I was one of them one of the redeemed Hallelujah that's why Joe says hallelujah though the skin worms yeah hey Hallelujah under the inspiration certain inspiration of perfection that's where we are in this message you are under the inspiration of perfection Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost is the only way you will be perfected I'm not done with this subjects Hallelujah Jesus the devil don't like it because there's a group of people who are now beginning to see exactly who they are it's like the monkey song so now they're not going to be worried about their mistakes you know because God is already declared you're righteous he knows that when we make mistakes he's sickness we're going to make it right he counted as though we've never done it in the first place God is Not hoping that you love him God knows that you love him because he put his love in you you can't love God the way he wants [Music] that's exactly right you can't even have the Faith remember what God wants you to have and let God push the faith in you one thing you must know today [Music] I'm a stranger this is not my home this is hallelujah can I read one more quote while you're standing and I'm Gonna Let You Go I wasn't going to incorporate this because our brother don't have it I was looking for one earlier and then I came across it so I want you to understand the season we're in and things in the Unseen that you need to see and understand control sorry about that brother you love the Lord remember Louisiana God is so good to us it reads you need more time

someday they have a shout out to fight communism and this is what America is working with now it's a school we've finally got communism which will hook up with Catholicism with the Protestant church and the Catholic church together and the inter-denominations who stand out for the truth and get away from the dormant that they got The Showdown will soon come report and brother if if that's not in in there you'll be deceived the world cause it'll look so nice it will say now if communism communism made for the world why let us make another agreement and bring all Christians and Christianity the world back christianized it should be christianized the world back and it looks so good the people will jump into it they'll Confederate the churches and bring and try to make Christianity one unit I mean and the Bible says in Revelation that he'll give his power and everything that he made an image unto the Beast exercise all the power of the Beast yeah sure it is something more wish we had time to hook Revelation into the things you're right here in the end of time and maybe the people couldn't see what he was talking about in 53. but right now Spirit of the world especially in this country
