had signs in the his um one candidate for baptism there were many people who did come really blessed promised to continue at that church so God did do a wonderful testimonies of healings and we thank God for that we'd like to to did you mention brother Keith I didn't okay just remember him hello I say his wife is still in intensive care that I know to have open heart surgery day so but she's she's doing well she's doing well so we praise the Lord amen I I'm going to just go with a different thought today tonight permit I will continue the message I had before tonight is on our urgency Genesis please we just read the first verse there and then we'll take you to Matthew 25 and10 well we know what that we're living in the last days but I want people to be mindful of what's Happening uh we're we're we're we're getting ready uh ourselves to experience some things that only the Holy Ghost will be Genesis 71 and the Lord said unto Noah Come Thou and all thy house into the ark for thee I have seen rightous before me this generation Matthew 251 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut let us pray heavenly father thank you for your grace reading of the word that the word will find Place everyone of our heart We Trust Lord God that we will receive it bring forth 100f we've said and done said and done have not been pleasing in our sight that your grace oh God cover our sin and and and bring it to a place holy spirit will have pre in your name Jesus Christ pray amen amen you may be seated I just uh want to say that I know for myself I have had uh some tremendous uh mind battles especially these last few days totally forgetting what brother Ram said successful meeting fight one thing I know about Warfare there is no way that you could be in a Warfare without receiving Scar and your scars is the evidence that you've been find encourage you tonight keep fting you know we we know we have the victory has been given nobody in this room can defeat Satan without God it is God who deat our i' like to preach a message tonight the indications of Destruction and I want you to remember tonight if I don't say anything else I want to say that the whole entire world is under the inspiration of Destruction they can't help it they can't get away from it prophecy must be fulfilled but remember we have a way of escape the thing that I see is that the world is Bewitched they they act as if they are in a days a days like trapped yeah you you know how a deer in head lights they can't move light hit they stuck there and and they just become pre and that is it seems as if everybody in the world has they're stuck you know they G because they wouldn't receive the truth the Bible said that God gave them over to a strong delusion a lie the world did not see it Hallelujah but the son of man was revealed in our day but they rejected him and because they rejected him rejected the gospel just America whole world is under this false illusion believing that they could make the world better the world cannot get better the scripture says evil sedu us shall wax worse and worse it's not going to get better and we even as Americans it's going to get better it's not going to get better hallelujah hallelujah when I look and I see the condition the world is in it takes me to uh Genesis 6 violence was everywhere women were beautiful it was [Music] overpopulated right and the and can people were the rulers of the country the intellects they they they did a lot of experiments Hallelujah said whatever they imagine in that day now is an indication it's it's a way it's evidence God is showing that judgment about to strike somebody the other day trying to tell them in America at this point in time you need to enjoy enjoy your life because it won't remain this way you're living you don't see the BS falling you are living under a good condition we're not in Pakistan not in Jerusalem we're not in Ukraine UK so we we ought to be grateful the that we have now because our day is coming said our day is coming hallelujah hallelujah we must be prepared oh my because the Bible says every Temptation God makes a way of escape the thing that get me because everybody is looking in such a way they're more concerned about the natural things than they are the spiritual things Hallelujah understand that was the difference between Jacob and Es was concerned a sh more concerned about the spiritual saying tonight we need to be more concerned growth hallelujah hallelujah is that right because that's the way the prophet brought that you going to be take with you the of Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God and let me tell you something storm that's coming every piece of God's character is that right you what do you mean Jesus God in flesh tested he prove he was the lamb y'all hear what I'm saying he had to prove that he was the lamb hallelujah hallelujah spat in his face all night longall they they they they they they called him names a a crown of thorns on his the Bible said he opened not his mouth Hallelujah he never tried to defend himself if we be the Lamb of God behave the same way hallelujah hallelujah we do not fight each other your up chran no longer have any rights understand me this is what we must be pressing into there's nothing wrong failure know fail the Bible says a just man seven times a day amen huh and he gets up see so you going to be tried going be tested is that right said that the of Jesus Christ has come to be tried there's no way out of it now Lord my trials now I'd rather go through my test now because I don't want no trouble at I don't want nothing on my back condem listen even the Bible puts us to the test
