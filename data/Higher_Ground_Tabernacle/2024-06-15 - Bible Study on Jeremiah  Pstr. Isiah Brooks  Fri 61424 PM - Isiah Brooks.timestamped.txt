[0:00] Lord I pray Lord that you would give us
[0:02] Grace give us we love you Lord we thank
[0:06] you in the name of Jesus Christ pray
[0:09] amen amen you love the Lord we thank God
[0:12] for his grace let's stand we we're still
[0:15] working with
[0:16] Jeremiah but I want to start off with uh
[0:20] Jude we're going to start we're going to
[0:22] read a scripture from Jude then we're
[0:24] going to do a little um uh synopsis of
[0:28] what we've already uh
[0:30] uh done uh here in the book of Jeremiah
[0:34] we want to try to wrap it up tonight by
[0:36] the grace of God and and uh so we're
[0:38] going to move maybe a little faster than
[0:41] we normally do uh Jude
[0:44] 1 and it reads from the third verse
[0:48] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[0:50] write unto you of the common salvation
[0:53] it was needful for me to write unto you
[0:56] and to exalt you that you should
[0:58] earnestly contend for the Faith which
[1:01] was once delivered unto the Saints for
[1:03] there's a certain men crept in unawares
[1:07] who was before of ordained to this
[1:10] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:13] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:16] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:20] Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in
[1:23] remembrance though ye once knew this how
[1:26] that the Lord had saved the people out
[1:28] of the land of Egypt afterwards
[1:30] destroyed them that believe not and the
[1:33] angels would kept not their first estate
[1:36] but left their own habitation he have
[1:39] reserved in Everlasting chains Into
[1:41] Darkness until the Judgment of the great
[1:49] day you're going to read Jeremiah
[1:54] 50 we read the third through the 5ifth
[1:57] verse
[2:05] Jeremiah
[2:06] 50 beginning the third verse for out of
[2:10] the North there cometh up a nation
[2:12] against
[2:14] us I see against her which shall make
[2:17] her land desolate and None Shall dwell
[2:20] therein they shall remove they shall
[2:23] depart both man and Beast and in those
[2:27] days in that time said the Lord the
[2:29] children of Israel shall come they and
[2:32] the children of Judah together going and
[2:35] weeping they shall go and seek the Lord
[2:38] their God they shall ask the way of Zion
[2:42] with their faces thitherward saying come
[2:45] and let us join ourselves to the Lord in
[2:48] a Perpetual Covenant that shall not be
[2:52] forgotten let us pray Heavenly Father
[2:55] once again we thank you for your grace
[2:56] and your mercy we thank you for the
[2:58] reading of your word we we thank you for
[3:00] those who are here tonight we pray that
[3:02] you would bless Lord the reading of your
[3:04] word Quicken it to us Lord oh God give
[3:06] us understanding Hallelujah that we may
[3:09] be able to see what your perfect will is
[3:13] bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:15] pray amen you may be
[3:19] seated yeah we uh by the grace of God
[3:22] want to uh thank the Lord for what we've
[3:26] gotten out of book of Jeremiah I know
[3:30] that um we um how can I say it we we
[3:35] know that uh uh it was it's been it's
[3:39] been a real big book it is a book a
[3:42] great book uh but we want want to also
[3:45] we hit we we tried to hit some of the
[3:47] highlights of it so that you would get a
[3:50] better understanding of our day you know
[3:53] to me when I read
[3:56] Jeremiah I think about all of the uh
[4:00] things that are happening here in
[4:02] America and I know by the by God's grace
[4:05] that Jeremiah seemed like he was looking
[4:08] right into our day seeing all the
[4:10] corruption and stuff that is going on
[4:13] among the church and remember now Israel
[4:16] was the Church of God and because of
[4:18] their Disobedience God allowed Babylon
[4:21] to overtake them Babylon is not just a
[4:24] city but it's a spirit and those of us
[4:26] who know a little history about Babylon
[4:29] it's started in Genesis with uh the
[4:31] towel of Babel uh with Nimrod ruling the
[4:35] people and bringing them together to
[4:38] outsmart God and they left whatever
[4:41] Faith they had you know they had Faith
[4:44] because the Bible said Enoch walk with
[4:46] God you know and though they did not
[4:49] have you know uh how can I say it letter
[4:53] a written word they it was like Word of
[4:55] Mouth Word of Mouth God you know and we
[4:58] don't know all that were taught you know
[5:01] but I'm sure Adam and Eve played their
[5:03] part in teaching their children that's
[5:05] what the seed of God do that's what we
[5:07] do so we know by the grace of God that
[5:11] even it it was passed on down and then
[5:16] we find out that somehow men going to be
[5:19] men men can't change we're Beast you
[5:23] know I mean we're animals we we're the
[5:25] worst kind because of the Demonic power
[5:28] that occupies our bodies and our spirit
[5:32] I mean you know very rarely do you find
[5:34] demons in in animals but they do that do
[5:37] occur sometimes too uh because demons
[5:40] can't find people kind of in in like
[5:42] they would like to but my point is is
[5:45] that the habit of man can't change until
[5:49] God gives them a birth and no matter how
[5:52] God blesses
[5:53] you you know if you don't stay with God
[5:57] you you're going to change into
[6:00] what the people of Israel changed into
[6:03] uh they their lives became miserable but
[6:06] they really thought they were having a
[6:08] great time uh Babylon was built like I
[6:11] said by the hunter Nimrod and that's in
[6:13] Genesis 10
[6:15] 9-10 and had it a great power uh under
[6:19] the King
[6:20] Nebuchadnezzar who rebuilt the city to
[6:22] become one of the showpieces of the
[6:25] ancient world and we know that according
[6:27] to Daniel 4:29 and3
[6:30] but God's Prophet saw the city as a
[6:32] symbol of Babylon which was a which was
[6:35] uh embodied with pride and and embod it
[6:39] embodied a great king now so you
[6:42] understand that when you see great Kings
[6:45] it's just not Kings behind the curtain
[6:48] there is a king a spiritual King a
[6:51] demonic King right so so we understand
[6:55] when when in the Book of Revelation when
[6:57] it talks about those demons coming out
[6:59] of the Euphrates look how it's changed
[7:02] not only America but the world and the
[7:05] world don't even know that's what
[7:06] changed them and what these demons did
[7:09] they got into the political rim and they
[7:11] changed the order of the law because law
[7:14] always keeps Satan aey you know keeps
[7:17] him bound but when laws are broken and a
[7:20] nation becomes un uh what's unlaw uh
[7:24] where laws mean nothing then that's when
[7:27] Satan has his free course it's almost
[7:29] like when a a cancer gets into you or a
[7:32] germ gets into you and there's no no
[7:34] Battleground no battles your immune
[7:36] system don't can't fight you see what
[7:38] I'm saying so laws in a way becomes an
[7:41] immune system uh for a nation but the
[7:45] ancient city um like I said at Babylon
[7:48] it was it was uh there it started and
[7:53] and and the thing about it is the
[7:56] mankind had drifted so far from God
[8:00] to the only righteous man you had in the
[8:02] early
[8:03] Babylon uh time of Noah wouldn't call
[8:07] Babylon then but in the time of Noah and
[8:10] all of that uh we know that the same
[8:13] spirits that that that was on uh uh uh
[8:18] um Nimrod was also the same ones that
[8:21] crossed over the flood you see that's
[8:24] that's what people don't understand the
[8:25] spirits crosses over however we turn
[8:28] they turn whatever God turns they turn
[8:32] and and they all are there for to serve
[8:34] a purpose and that purpose is to show
[8:37] good from evil or even from good now we
[8:41] understand that they got into all of the
[8:44] lasciviousness and all of the Abominable
[8:47] things that that man do and when I say
[8:50] that I mean we know what the scripture
[8:53] says men get so bad that they get into
[8:56] beology all kinds of perverted things
[8:58] and those are the things that God hates
[9:00] this thing is not new Solomon said
[9:02] there's no new thing under the sun and
[9:05] the reason why I'm saying all of this is
[9:07] because now Jude writes to us said be
[9:09] careful he doesn't say the same thing
[9:12] that happened to Babylon will happen to
[9:14] you or the same thing that happened to
[9:16] the Jews will happen to you but because
[9:18] what they they they they walked away
[9:21] from the laws of God and they got into
[9:24] the laws of Satan right and that's when
[9:27] they began to do the works and the acts
[9:28] of Satan
[9:30] right I heard the prophet of God say
[9:32] today on on a future home and he was
[9:36] talking about those that are are are
[9:39] predestinated and
[9:41] born to be the children of God they will
[9:45] receive the message amen that's what he
[9:47] said he said they are the ones who goes
[9:50] to the Future home amen they have eyes
[9:53] to see God has ordained them to see that
[9:57] yeah he doesn't say the others are not
[9:58] saved but he said these ones who receive
[10:01] the message they take a
[10:03] Rapture right so when you when you see
[10:07] that God has a plan as I said the other
[10:09] day there's a table prepared and God has
[10:12] that thing laid out you know have you
[10:15] ever had your Army mens and everything
[10:17] else and you you you got a table and you
[10:20] got the Blue Jackets against the you
[10:21] know how that works and and that's how
[10:24] God it's just a little piece of God's
[10:25] mind coming into play when we do that
[10:28] and you already know who's going to win
[10:31] and God knows who's going to win now I'm
[10:34] saying all of this to to bring you to a
[10:36] place cuz I'm going to bring you up to
[10:37] our day but Israel got to a place that
[10:40] they were totally backsliding they they
[10:43] did the very thing God told them not to
[10:44] do and that is to stay away from the
[10:46] Nations the other nations don't get into
[10:48] their habits don't do what they do and
[10:50] Israel came and got did the same thing
[10:53] and really when you get to a place that
[10:55] you have become so carnal you resent God
[10:58] and that's B what what happened to
[11:00] Israel they didn't want the
[11:02] correction you know they want to block
[11:04] out their minds in their minds well God
[11:07] is dead and like some people of our day
[11:09] say God delayeth his coming see it's the
[11:12] same Spirit that's trying to convince
[11:15] you that God's word is not going to come
[11:17] to pass but we understand also all all
[11:20] all all all about around with uh how can
[11:23] I say it when it came to to all the
[11:26] countries that Israel was engaged to
[11:29] God not only judged Israel but God
[11:32] judged the Nations as well and the
[11:34] punishment in which God brought unto
[11:36] Israel was also the punishment that God
[11:39] brought to the Nations that conquered
[11:42] Israel amen see what I'm saying so you
[11:44] say well what do you mean remember when
[11:46] when Nebuchadnezzar was a big man I mean
[11:49] statue over him you know all of that was
[11:52] in Prophecy and everything and at the
[11:54] end God destroys Nebuchadnezzar he used
[11:57] him as a vessel Of Dishonor to destroy
[12:00] the ones who supposed to be of Honor but
[12:02] then God never forgets his people you
[12:05] know what I'm saying so we understand
[12:06] that that's what happened amen and it
[12:09] was all about their pride see you get
[12:12] lifted up you say what no it couldn't
[12:14] have been Pride but what was it when
[12:15] when Cain says am I My Brother's Keeper
[12:19] he got sassy he was prideful that's why
[12:22] the Bible said Pride come just before
[12:24] the
[12:25] fall now though the Lord have pronounced
[12:28] judgment on Israel and brought them into
[12:30] captivity and they were to go into
[12:32] captivity for 70 years and I'm in I'm in
[12:36] Jeremiah now God also prophesied
[12:39] judgment against Babylon for doing so
[12:42] right and and think about this it's see
[12:46] you see people and you think to yourself
[12:48] it's not happening no history repeats
[12:51] itself the very people that God
[12:54] delivered uh out of the out of out of
[12:57] Egypt uh with with the
[13:00] message are some of the same people that
[13:03] went back am right they didn't they
[13:06] didn't they didn't want to continue and
[13:08] you know they begin to almost blaspheme
[13:11] if I want to say it like this because
[13:13] they they they basically cursed not only
[13:16] the prophet but the teachings of the
[13:17] Prophet not knowing that that was not a
[13:20] man that was God in a man see so God
[13:25] promised also that with all of the
[13:27] destruction
[13:29] how can I say it the Bible said God
[13:30] never leaves himself without a
[13:33] witness and even though God bring
[13:36] instruction if you change if you go from
[13:39] Genesis all the way to our day there's
[13:42] always a Remnant y God always save a
[13:48] Remnant and the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[13:50] what we call the
[13:52] remnant right so we ought to be really
[13:55] excited to know that we're living in
[13:57] these last days where Babylon is going
[13:59] to be destroyed is that the word that's
[14:02] the word but now the whole world is
[14:05] under the spirit of Babylon that's right
[14:08] if you read Revelations which I'm coming
[14:10] to it shows that all of the Kings gave
[14:13] their power to the Beast into the
[14:16] and who was she mystery Babylon the
[14:19] great so we're now in the in the very
[14:23] we're being enveloped uh how could I say
[14:26] is that the right word uh in the situ
[14:29] ation where the spirit of Babylon
[14:32] confusion now AR we in confusion
[14:35] here yeah but understand in all of that
[14:38] confusion there was still a
[14:40] king and there's still a
[14:43] king the world don't see the king but
[14:47] just just just as Nimrod was the king
[14:50] we've got a king that we call the
[14:53] pope and y'all know how that's going to
[14:55] work that's Babylon mystery Babylon the
[14:59] great she still lives amen and if God
[15:02] brought judgment on the towel of Babel
[15:05] and then the other he brought judgment
[15:08] on Babylon itself right under
[15:12] Nebuchadnezzar and all of them Canan
[15:14] find basically where where it was but I
[15:16] I know where it was that's why we we
[15:19] look at this situation where was babyon
[15:22] it was right there
[15:24] uh took my thought right there with um
[15:27] Iran and Iraq That's Where It's At amen
[15:31] so we see by God's grace that here God
[15:34] is saying listen I'm bringing all of
[15:35] this thing all this judgment on you but
[15:37] there's still a people I haven't
[15:40] forgotten Hallelujah there's still a
[15:42] people that I am going to bring back to
[15:45] my Covenant right because remember when
[15:48] Israel I think it was Darius that set
[15:50] them free if that correct Darius was the
[15:52] one that
[15:55] conquered uh um Babylon
[15:59] and I I might have the name wrong but I
[16:01] know I'm Cyrus Cyrus was the one that
[16:04] set him free but I think when when you
[16:07] think about um how God raised him up CU
[16:11] Babylon was
[16:13] great it was great there was nobody that
[16:15] could
[16:16] conquer and it was so strong that God
[16:21] had to bring
[16:23] Cyrus right to set him free now when you
[16:28] think about that that and how brother
[16:30] Ram said that Babylon will continue on
[16:33] until Jesus come himself nobody can stop
[16:37] her amen nobody can stop her but Christ
[16:40] himself now we we we say these because
[16:44] the the news of what the Lord had done
[16:46] to Israel was well known now is wasn't
[16:51] Israel wasn't just destroyed but all the
[16:54] neighbors everybody in the world knew
[16:57] that now Israel is done and and most of
[17:00] the countries would say their God is no
[17:02] longer with them where they were right
[17:05] even though they had not heard the
[17:06] prophecy that Jesus talked about when he
[17:10] talks about destroying this the the city
[17:12] in in the time when Titus came through
[17:15] and see it's it's like the the scripture
[17:18] always have a manifold meaning it never
[17:20] stops it just never stops and you know
[17:22] because the reason why because God can't
[17:25] change he can't change and when
[17:27] situations may meet the same position uh
[17:32] that Babylon or all the other cities
[17:35] that's why you see brother you see God
[17:38] sometimes
[17:40] describing a Old Testament event like
[17:43] Sodom and gomorah or in the days of Noah
[17:46] or because people have come back to that
[17:48] same position that they were in during
[17:51] that time of Destruction and see God
[17:54] can't change if he destroyed them he's
[17:56] going to destroy us you understand me
[17:59] right so let's go to Jeremiah 50 and7 to
[18:03] just to know that God is is is is is is
[18:07] getting ready to end this thing and what
[18:10] we don't understand or don't know is
[18:13] that it's already begun I think I know
[18:17] when the seven seal will open or when
[18:19] the angel however people want to say
[18:21] they get stuck on the six and the
[18:22] seventh and I heard what people said
[18:25] well the seven Church ain't age it's not
[18:27] over well brother brandom said it is in
[18:30] the future home he said it was over amen
[18:33] that's right he the seventh seven he
[18:35] went through all of the church ages and
[18:37] then he got to the seventh Church agent
[18:39] he said the seventh Church agent is O
[18:41] we're we're in and it and it's over
[18:43] somehow he said it but but nevertheless
[18:46] my point is people are wrestling with
[18:48] that because they don't know the time is
[18:51] changed we're not in the seventh age we
[18:54] in in a Eternal age amen and and that's
[18:58] what people don't
[19:00] understand if you if you stuck in the
[19:02] seven you won't see what you're going to
[19:03] see in the
[19:05] eth see but in this in this day uh we we
[19:10] must understand that time has
[19:13] changed it's it was when when when how
[19:16] can I say it like this even though it
[19:18] was the ending of time it was the
[19:20] beginning of the fullness of time when
[19:22] the fullness of time has come see and
[19:25] that's what the prophet of God shared
[19:26] with us that when these things happen it
[19:29] doesn't just all of a sudden all happen
[19:31] at one time no it has a time period
[19:34] allotted to
[19:35] it so here in Jeremiah 50:7 all that
[19:40] found them have devoured them and their
[19:43] adversaries said we offend them we
[19:46] offend not because they have sinned
[19:49] against the Lord the habitation of of of
[19:52] Justice even the Lord the hope of their
[19:55] father so when you see the attitude of
[19:58] the people then you can even see the
[20:00] attitude of the people now
[20:04] amen and all of the world they see you
[20:08] know they want to walk on the Jews am I
[20:11] getting this right they want to walk on
[20:12] the Jews they want to step on them
[20:14] because they feel like hey God ain't
[20:16] with them no more God has left them but
[20:19] what they do not see is the the the the
[20:22] time and the scripture that this people
[20:25] are right where God wants them to be
[20:28] amen
[20:29] that's
[20:32] true and everybody no matter where you
[20:34] go hate Jews and don't know
[20:38] why the Same Spirit this is Babylon so
[20:41] this Spirit must be here
[20:43] too the hatred of Jews must be here too
[20:46] because the hatred of Jews was in the
[20:47] days of Jeremiah you understand me it
[20:50] it's it's just always that way and so it
[20:54] is with the
[20:55] Christian right because what was wrong
[20:58] she was
[21:00] Babylon now you know she was she was
[21:03] killed or put put to death but she rose
[21:06] again that's it now she's a mystery but
[21:08] who is
[21:11] she yeah she came back
[21:15] up right and now people think oh the old
[21:18] Rome is gone no that Rome is here and
[21:22] she's worse in the first amen yes sir
[21:25] and if whatever those Spirits were in
[21:27] Jeremiah they here yes they they're here
[21:30] and they're among Christians right now
[21:33] and you always got those prophets like
[21:35] Jeremiah trying to tell the people but
[21:37] listen what brother God said to to
[21:41] Jeremiah I called you and then he brings
[21:44] in predestination he brings an election
[21:47] and he said and and and I'm going tell
[21:49] you these people are not going to
[21:51] listen and that's where we are sir
[21:54] that's exactly right we are at that
[21:57] position you can tell them all you want
[21:58] to the world is coming to an end nobody
[22:01] listens noen because they full of lust
[22:04] full of pleasure full of this and full
[22:06] of that and don't have no Holy Ghost and
[22:08] they do not understand they have been
[22:11] ordained to be
[22:13] this now listen when Jude was speaking
[22:16] he wasn't talking about the world he was
[22:18] telling talking to the church the church
[22:20] will become to a place where they would
[22:23] become lasciviousness and and whatever
[22:25] more with the fornication and with all
[22:28] the other things that that churches are
[22:29] doing man I heard some things I've heard
[22:33] some things that it was just hard for me
[22:34] to believe that people were doing in
[22:39] churches you know and then then my boy
[22:41] sent me something where what was that
[22:43] Tony
[22:46] Evans he's stepping down because he's
[22:49] done I don't know the whole situation
[22:52] but my point is
[22:53] this when you get great leaders and
[22:56] that's that's the thing people don't
[22:58] pray for preachers but let me tell you
[22:59] something Satan love the domino effect
[23:03] if he can hit that key pin it
[23:06] it's and that's I switch from dominoes
[23:09] to bowling but y'all know what I
[23:11] mean but but the point is that's where
[23:14] we are but listen this is why the Bible
[23:17] said you you know don't put your trust
[23:20] in the arm of Flesh always trust God yes
[23:24] sir yes sir so Jeremiah 23 it says how
[23:27] is the hammer of the whole earth cut a
[23:30] sun and broken how is Babylon become a
[23:34] desolation among the Nations I have laid
[23:38] a snare for thee and thou art also taken
[23:41] oh Babylon and thou Hast ha thou was not
[23:45] aware thou art found and also caught
[23:49] because thou have driven striven against
[23:52] the Lord
[23:53] hello what what is the world doing what
[23:56] is is America doing we're striving
[23:59] against
[24:00] him yes we're fighting against him
[24:03] everything the word stands for they're
[24:05] doing just the opposite boldly Doing It
[24:09] With Pride right I heard a little
[24:13] my uh friend gave me a little clipping
[24:16] today this girl on the on the internet
[24:18] she says I know you're going to get mad
[24:20] with me she said but the rainbow belongs
[24:22] to God and pride is
[24:26] evil right so so now they got this thing
[24:30] moving I said well when is pride month
[24:33] month is
[24:35] now so how can you have
[24:38] pride and not be against
[24:41] God it's pride and then you take his
[24:44] Covenant and place it as yours
[24:48] flag no it's it's total outright
[24:51] Blasphemous and
[24:53] rebellious you know rebelling but it
[24:55] doesn't matter God has already said
[24:57] what's going to happen we don't have to
[24:59] say nothing God has already declared
[25:02] it right the Lord have opened his
[25:06] Armory and have brought forth the
[25:08] weapons of his indignation for this is
[25:12] the work of the lord of the host in the
[25:14] land of the
[25:15] Chans and you and I know that what God
[25:19] is doing now is what he intend to do all
[25:23] of these plagues food shortage I don't
[25:26] care who they say doing it but these
[25:28] people are inspired to do what they're
[25:31] doing to bring mankind to their needes
[25:34] so that they can group them together as
[25:37] did nimrod and God's not surprised and
[25:41] God is not
[25:43] surprised right cuz we repeat the same
[25:45] thing over and over again like okay this
[25:49] did you know they did this back there so
[25:52] where we are today I love Jeremiah for
[25:55] what I've come to see and understand the
[25:58] point is that all
[26:01] nations all of Israel was judged and the
[26:04] Nations that persecuted her was judged
[26:08] but then at the end of the road Israel
[26:10] came back and all the other nations
[26:14] died you see what I'm saying so that's
[26:17] what people don't understand God has his
[26:20] hand yes sir on the Christian and the
[26:22] Jews yep yeah yes sir and now we we're
[26:26] getting ready to see something in our
[26:27] nation
[26:29] and but by the grace of God God has
[26:31] already prepared the table before me
[26:35] yeah you anointed my head with oil you
[26:37] know I mean so we don't have to be
[26:39] concerned fear not little flock but
[26:42] these things are going to happen why
[26:43] because that if America church had not
[26:46] failed America would be still
[26:50] strong see God church God judges the
[26:53] church first according to Ezekiel God
[26:56] said go by the house of God go by there
[26:59] where the Ancients are the old people
[27:01] they know the way but look at them none
[27:04] of them have sealed the church members
[27:07] from the old to the young but they don't
[27:10] have the ceiling of the Holy Spirit he
[27:12] said destroy them
[27:14] all and that's what's going to happen in
[27:17] our day we're going to see it we're
[27:19] going to see the destruction of the
[27:21] world as well as the church the bride is
[27:24] the only thing we get out of here safely
[27:28] right right turn to Revelations
[27:37] 148 Revelations
[27:47] 148 and there followed another Angel
[27:51] saying Babylon is Fallen is
[27:55] Fallen the great City
[27:58] because she made all nations drink of
[28:01] the wine and the wrath of her
[28:03] fornication and that's what I was saying
[28:05] earlier All Nations have drunk from her
[28:09] cup and now they all guilty and they all
[28:13] will be
[28:14] judged right because that was the
[28:16] influence of the old Babylon old Babylon
[28:19] influenced the whole world around them
[28:22] y'all know that's the truth it's like oh
[28:25] like
[28:26] USA we have influenced the whole world
[28:29] Amen and the reason why we were able to
[28:32] influence the whole world because we
[28:33] scripturally there in Revelations
[28:36] 13 tied to the
[28:39] Beast right we're part of Babylon and we
[28:43] influen the world now if the first
[28:46] Babylon Babel God destroyed God
[28:50] destroyed the second Babylon and now
[28:52] here come what here we are yes sir
[28:55] Babylon again but it's a
[28:58] but all the keys to being
[29:01] successful is right in the word stay
[29:04] with
[29:07] God stay with God no matter how corrupt
[29:10] people become you've got to stay with
[29:13] God Revelation
[29:22] 18 yes sir
[29:28] yes Daniel 2 yes sir 18 four is
[29:31] Deliverance
[29:33] so Revelation 182
[29:37] through3 and he cried mightily with a
[29:40] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[29:42] Fallen is fallen and has become the
[29:45] habitation of devils right and the whole
[29:48] of every foul spirit and a cage of every
[29:52] unclean and what hateful
[29:56] bird and the prophet of God
[29:58] said I'm
[30:00] paraphrasing what they did to the Jews
[30:03] would seemed like a picnic compare what
[30:06] they're going to do to these these uh
[30:10] foolish virgins
[30:11] yeah may God have
[30:14] mercy cuz that what people say oh I'll
[30:16] be foolish but let me tell you something
[30:18] that ain't going to be
[30:20] easy that when somebody start hitting
[30:23] your flesh and able to uh they say they
[30:26] look for death and can't find it
[30:28] amen people going to want to die kill me
[30:31] Lord no you got to suffer this out to
[30:33] that appointed time it's a horrible
[30:36] thing when you think about it but I'm
[30:38] I'm going say it you know I'm getting
[30:40] getting ready to get
[30:41] to Jeremiah 552 I'm I'm trying to
[30:45] hurry but let's read this uh
[30:48] Revelations uh yeah I just read that and
[30:50] so that's what babyon was if it was that
[30:54] if it's
[30:55] this like this it says uh
[30:58] unclean and hateful bird and for all the
[31:01] nations have drunk of her wine of her
[31:02] wrath Wrath of her fornication and the
[31:05] kings of the Earth have committed what
[31:06] fornication with her and the merchants
[31:08] of the Earth are waxed Rich through the
[31:10] abundance of her Delicacies now let me
[31:12] ask you something I know this to be true
[31:15] they were called a Rome what we call the
[31:18] big farmer and all of these people and
[31:22] they call he called them her his
[31:24] children and then yeah everybody and
[31:27] when they came back
[31:28] America was
[31:31] destroyed don't tell
[31:33] me it ain't right cuz I know it's right
[31:36] and and I'm going tell you something we
[31:38] get news so much later I was over in
[31:40] England I was over in England and and
[31:43] and and I saw the president who was
[31:45] Obama with the Pope don't you know that
[31:49] it almost took a whole year before they
[31:50] put it on our news as if it was
[31:52] happening that day or the day before I
[31:55] saw it with my own eyes America we blind
[31:59] amen news the news media have kept a lot
[32:02] of truth from us amen and we don't even
[32:04] realize like I said I might get in
[32:06] trouble but we don't realize how Wicked
[32:08] our country has become amen but a lot of
[32:11] the people who've had to deal with us
[32:14] know
[32:15] it hard to believe but it's true the
[32:18] Bible say she came up like a lamb but
[32:20] then after while she was a dragon and
[32:22] that's exactly what we have become sir
[32:25] Isaiah please
[32:28] Isaiah
[32:40] 21 Isaiah
[32:44] 216 for thus ha the Lord said unto me go
[32:49] set a Watchman let him declare what he
[32:51] seeth and he saw a chariot a couple of
[32:56] Horsemen a CH Chariot of asses and a
[32:59] chariot of camels and he hearkened
[33:03] diligently with much heed and he cried a
[33:07] lion my Lord I stand continually upon
[33:10] the Watchtower in the daytime and I am
[33:13] set in my w Ward whole nights and behold
[33:18] there come a chariot of men with a
[33:20] couple of horses and he said and
[33:23] answered he said Babylon is Fallen is
[33:26] fallen and all the great images of God
[33:29] he have broken into the ground oh my
[33:33] threshing and the corns of my floor that
[33:36] which I have heard of The Lord of hosts
[33:39] the Lord of Israel have I declared now
[33:43] it let let's let's let's go back to
[33:45] Isaiah
[33:46] 52 I mean sorry Jeremiah
[33:52] 52 God is real there's no new thing
[33:56] under the sun
[33:59] no new thing now zedekiah was was the
[34:03] king whatever he
[34:06] was that that
[34:10] withstood the prophecy
[34:13] of
[34:16] Jeremiah and if you know what happened
[34:18] to
[34:20] him he wasn't just killed readily and
[34:23] I'm going to read it in just a bit but
[34:25] his eyes were plucked out he types out
[34:29] basically lat see thrown in the prison
[34:32] and he died there but you see when it
[34:35] comes to uh uh uh God's word people
[34:39] don't realize that there's a
[34:41] penalty for not
[34:44] obeying and as I've heard uh others say
[34:48] you know God never gave us the law as a
[34:50] punishment he God gave us the law to
[34:53] keep us safe to keep us from getting
[34:56] diseases he wanted us to live long happy
[35:00] you know he told us the things that we
[35:02] we shouldn't do to maintain our
[35:04] marriages our children everything and it
[35:07] was just not just given to us to
[35:09] imprison us but really it became
[35:11] imprisonment to those who didn't want to
[35:13] do it amen and so is it with the word of
[35:15] God now it becomes a burden to the
[35:18] people who don't want to live it right
[35:21] so let's read uh uh starting with uh
[35:24] Jeremiah
[35:25] 52 we'll finish up here by the grace of
[35:28] God believe yeah they don't they don't
[35:32] they don't there's nothing in them to to
[35:34] believe it's de it it just you you
[35:37] listen I think about what it is you got
[35:39] to realize at this point in time you can
[35:42] witness all you want to that's true
[35:44] brother but you can't make a person
[35:47] see and when a person is not thirsty
[35:50] you're can to ask them do you want water
[35:52] and they going to say no thank you it's
[35:55] only the Thirsty person that will take a
[35:57] of your water amen right and we've got
[36:00] so many people that you can witness to I
[36:03] look at several people I brought here
[36:06] but but where are they they were so
[36:09] happy about the message and what I was
[36:11] showing them but they're not here
[36:13] anymore what was that I mean was I
[36:16] broken in heart absolutely but I
[36:18] realized one thing for certain either
[36:20] they'll come around
[36:21] later or they just not I don't know
[36:25] which it is only time will tell
[36:29] zedekiah was one and 20 years old when
[36:33] he began to Reign and he reigned 11
[36:37] years in Jerusalem and his mother's name
[36:39] was H
[36:42] huu the daughter of Jeremiah of
[36:46] libna and he did that which was evil in
[36:49] the sight of the eyes of the Lord
[36:51] according to all that Jobo jerim had
[36:55] done but through the anger of the Lord
[36:59] though the anger of the Lord uh excuse
[37:02] me through the a for through the anger
[37:04] of the Lord it came to pass in J
[37:07] Jerusalem and Judah till he had cast
[37:10] them out from his
[37:12] presence that zedekiah rebelled against
[37:15] the king of Babylon and it came to pass
[37:19] in the ninth year of his reign in the
[37:22] 10th month in the 10th day
[37:25] of uh 10th day day of the month that
[37:30] neucha king of Babylon came he and all
[37:34] his Army against Jerusalem and pitched
[37:36] against it and built Fort forts against
[37:40] against it round about now I'm saying
[37:43] all the reading this because this is
[37:45] exactly what Jeremiah told them was
[37:48] going to happen amen but they didn't
[37:50] believe it they believe all the other
[37:52] false prophets right and what did it do
[37:56] it got them into trouble now we think as
[37:59] Christians we have a hard time but if
[38:02] you was a
[38:04] prophet you had an extra hard time amen
[38:07] right because people persecuted you most
[38:10] of the time they didn't believe you now
[38:13] we we know about lamentation that's
[38:14] Jeremiah weeping for the children of
[38:16] Israel amen God told him it was going to
[38:19] be but still he had a love for his
[38:22] people he couldn't help it he couldn't
[38:25] help it because what was he doing
[38:26] display
[38:28] if you want to say the emotions or the
[38:31] feelings of God Amen that wasn't
[38:33] Jeremiah the man that was God in the man
[38:36] crying out for the
[38:38] people when you hear brother brandham
[38:40] cry and begin to weep sometime that
[38:42] wasn't just the man that was God crying
[38:45] out through that body amen trying to get
[38:48] the people to repent but then listen
[38:50] when he got to the place he knew that
[38:52] the message wasn't going to be received
[38:55] God knew then already told him
[38:56] revelation third chapter they put him
[38:58] out y amen see just like Jeremiah they
[39:02] they locked him in jail and and the
[39:04] point is I'm I'm going to bring here is
[39:06] that what have they done to us nobody
[39:09] knows about Willam bradam you can't go
[39:11] to a bookstore no no they shut him
[39:14] down and and and what they did like
[39:18] Israel let his blood be on us and our
[39:21] children cuz that's exactly what they
[39:23] did that kind of decision was the kind
[39:25] of decision that aan made
[39:28] you know that involved his own family
[39:29] see your decision making doesn't just
[39:32] affect you it affect your loved ones as
[39:35] well amen so look what what we did they
[39:38] they rejected the prophet of this day
[39:41] and look at America now she's
[39:43] overwhelmed with evil because they
[39:46] didn't listen right 1956 57 they had a
[39:51] way out God was going to give them that
[39:52] way out uh but but God indicted them
[39:56] because they wouldn't repent
[39:57] it was it was it was actually finished
[39:59] in now we can see
[40:03] it like Israel no respect for God
[40:08] none they they love to be religious
[40:11] Church they come to church Israel came
[40:13] to church did all of their ritual things
[40:15] but their heart was far from
[40:18] him and in the fourth month of the ninth
[40:21] day of the month the famine was so in
[40:24] the city so that there was no bread for
[40:26] the people people of the land now we
[40:28] know that's natural but look at it now
[40:31] there's no bread for the people in the
[40:34] land the only bread that's live and well
[40:37] is the bread that God laid in in store
[40:40] for us that's
[40:42] it Hallelujah you know what I'm saying
[40:46] Joseph had the had the
[40:48] bread you know he had the the the the
[40:51] the meal whatever see and you look at
[40:53] this thing you say well well that's
[40:54] natural but it's the same thing we have
[40:57] come to a place where the people are
[41:00] spiritually dying because there are no
[41:03] living
[41:04] bread then the city was broken up and
[41:07] all the men of War of War fled and went
[41:11] forth out of the city By Night by the
[41:13] way of the gate between the two walls
[41:16] which was by the King's Garden now the
[41:19] Chans were by the city in other words
[41:21] they had them surrounded there was no
[41:24] way out of it and that's what people
[41:26] don't understand is that Babylon has
[41:30] walls that's why we have to escape out
[41:32] of Babylon we have to we have to go
[41:34] beyond the city that's what Jesus did he
[41:37] had to go beyond be beyond the city
[41:39] walls right but but the army of the
[41:42] Chans pursued after the king and
[41:45] overtook zedekiah at the plain of
[41:47] Jericho and all his army was scattered
[41:50] from him then they took the king and
[41:52] carried him up into the king uh unto the
[41:55] king of Babylon to R Rim in the land of
[41:59] HTH where he gave judgment upon him now
[42:03] zedekiah actually mean God is my
[42:06] righteousness can you believe
[42:08] that this was a so-called
[42:11] Christian God is my righteousness that
[42:14] was his name and the king of Babylon
[42:16] slew the son of zedekiah before his eyes
[42:20] he slew allo all the princes of Judah in
[42:24] Rima then he put out the eyes of of
[42:27] zedekiah the and the king of Babylon
[42:30] about him in Chains bound him in Chains
[42:33] and carried him in uh him to Babylon and
[42:36] put him in prison what till the day of
[42:39] his death now can you
[42:42] imagine the only thing this man could
[42:44] see was his children being killed cuz
[42:49] even though his eyes were plucked out
[42:52] his mind still could
[42:55] see and could see every detail in his
[42:59] mind and now he's not only in darkness
[43:01] but he's in out of Darkness because he's
[43:04] in a prison that's dark dark so he's
[43:07] actually cast out and he died in that
[43:12] place what a penalty to pay now in the
[43:16] fifth month in the 10th day of the month
[43:19] which was in the 19th year of
[43:22] Nea king of Babylon came ne ne
[43:27] Zan King of the god which served the
[43:30] king of Babylon in Jerusalem and burn
[43:33] the house of the Lord and the King's
[43:35] house and all the houses of Jerusalem
[43:38] and all the houses of the Great Men burn
[43:40] he with fire now if you understand this
[43:44] God is basically saying you're lost and
[43:47] everybody that didn't
[43:50] obey my commandment because remember
[43:52] when the king first came they were
[43:54] supposed to leave with him don't fight
[43:57] the
[43:57] king cuz he said you fight you going to
[44:00] die you going to die if you don't follow
[44:03] my order you're going to die and that's
[44:05] always the way they did not want to be
[44:08] impr prisoned those who was left behind
[44:10] some of them for various reasons but
[44:13] what happened is God always come back
[44:16] you know that's how it was in Titus uh
[44:19] when Titus came he came to Jerusalem the
[44:20] first time and he left and they thought
[44:23] that was it but he returned you see what
[44:26] I'm saying so demons return Devils
[44:28] return now we in the crooks or the
[44:31] Pinnacle of this Warfare we're getting
[44:35] ready to see the
[44:36] ultimate amen and the only person that's
[44:39] going to be able to get us out of here
[44:41] is Jesus himself
[44:43] amen right and so all the armies of the
[44:47] charin the 14th verse that were with the
[44:49] CH captains of the Guard break down all
[44:52] the walls of Jerusalem round about the
[44:54] Never Never zah
[44:57] radan the king of the god carried away
[45:00] captives certain of the poor of the
[45:02] people and the residents of the people
[45:04] and the remains in the city and those
[45:06] that fell away that that fell to the
[45:09] king of Babylon and the rest of the
[45:11] multitude and so you say well what do
[45:12] you mean even among this group there was
[45:14] foolish virgins amen yeah amen even
[45:19] among this group was foolish virgins
[45:21] amen but they had to
[45:23] suffer you see those who escaped
[45:28] they were considered wise cuz you had
[45:31] who Daniel Shadrach n
[45:36] Beno but in every situation you got wise
[45:39] and foolish wise and
[45:42] foolish right but neuch San the captain
[45:47] of the god left certain of the poor and
[45:48] of the land for V wine Vine dressers and
[45:52] for husbandman also the pillars of brass
[45:54] that were in the house of the Lord and
[45:56] the B es and the brass seed that was in
[45:59] the house of the Lord the chin break and
[46:01] carried all the brass of them to babyon
[46:05] see and what they did not understand is
[46:07] that what they were doing they were
[46:09] carrying their death with them you don't
[46:12] touch the things of
[46:15] God and you'll find out that in in the
[46:17] in the history the very golden
[46:21] cups that they use to celebrate their
[46:25] party after neuch NE was dead his son
[46:28] was raised up and he was the one where
[46:32] God brought the Judgment that same
[46:34] evening that he threw his
[46:36] party you know how the word
[46:39] NE you
[46:42] know yeah and and and and he was the one
[46:46] see that's what people don't understand
[46:48] sometime when judgment comes it doesn't
[46:50] get the immediate group it gets The
[46:54] Offspring
[46:57] it's the generation after usually that
[46:59] judgment falls upon and that's what a
[47:02] lot of people don't understand sometime
[47:04] they say well see God you know spared me
[47:07] yeah not really because I don't know no
[47:10] man would want to see his children lost
[47:13] or
[47:15] destroyed and that's what we did we
[47:17] cursed America cursed her own
[47:20] children right also the pillars of brass
[47:23] so they took all of these things down
[47:25] into Babylon all all the things of the
[47:27] temple and and things of that nature and
[47:31] uh which
[47:33] was prophesied basically they would do
[47:36] all of this but in in all of this let's
[47:39] go to the 24th verse and the captain of
[47:42] the God took Zariah the chief of priest
[47:46] and Zephaniah the second priest and the
[47:49] three keepers of the door he took also
[47:52] out out the city an unic which had the
[47:55] charge of men men of of of of war and
[47:59] seven men of them that were near the
[48:02] king's person which were found in the
[48:04] city and he and the principal scribe of
[48:08] the host who murdered in other words
[48:10] they took everything that was valuable
[48:13] in Jerusalem down to Babylon and you say
[48:17] well what was that all
[48:20] about it was all
[48:22] about the three wise men
[48:27] because Daniel was there and Daniel
[48:32] taught
[48:33] Babylon many of the mysteries of God I
[48:38] mean when it comes to the Zodiac and all
[48:41] of these things that's how the wise men
[48:45] were able to read it and know that there
[48:47] was coming a king now I'm not saying all
[48:51] of the wise men knew that but these
[48:52] three did and they were following under
[48:55] the school of death
[48:58] you so you said well what do you mean
[49:00] brother Brooks that even then God have
[49:03] mercy on he on whom he will because I
[49:06] believe that those three wise men that
[49:08] did come from Babylon were saved I
[49:11] believe God received their gifts right
[49:14] so when we see all of these things and
[49:17] we say well
[49:19] Lord what's going to
[49:22] happen you can almost
[49:25] see John God giving him the vision of
[49:28] Babylon and who it was and
[49:31] all and John not seeing anybody to save
[49:35] that could save us not now now it's just
[49:39] not bab the old time Babylon or the one
[49:43] in Daniel he is's now you're seeing the
[49:46] whole world has become
[49:49] Babylon and Lord what's going to happen
[49:53] and here John is looking at this thing
[49:55] says Lord but the angel said weep not
[49:59] John Hallelujah we have one who
[50:03] prevailed right Hallelujah so you say
[50:05] well what do you
[50:07] mean how can I say it in the Conquering
[50:11] when Jesus Christ conquered death Hell
[50:15] In The
[50:15] Grave he conquered all the fruits of
[50:19] death Hell In The
[50:20] Grave every bit
[50:23] of lasv lust of the eye lust of the
[50:26] flesh
[50:27] the pride of life was
[50:29] conquered all of that was conquered and
[50:32] it was all conquered for his own the
[50:35] Bible said he came to save his own amen
[50:38] amen and so when you see all of this you
[50:42] got to realize everybody is not his own
[50:46] he's come to save his own that's right
[50:50] and this message is for his own amen
[50:54] that's right that's just the way it goes
[50:57] L and this is where we are today and I I
[51:00] say it like this I do
[51:02] believe that God revealed things to
[51:06] people even though they don't belong
[51:09] here CU this is not a church building
[51:11] thing amen amen this is what God didn't
[51:15] ask Nicodemus what church you go to no
[51:18] he said have you received the Holy Ghost
[51:20] since you believe see that's the that's
[51:23] what joins the body together we are
[51:25] baptized into one one body one by by
[51:28] what the Holy
[51:30] Ghost I believe the teaching of this
[51:33] message and as as as brother Randon
[51:36] brings it out on the future
[51:37] home you need to
[51:40] know the
[51:43] messenger you can't without the
[51:45] messenger you don't get the
[51:48] message and that's God's ordained way
[51:50] yes you can't get on Noah's Ark without
[51:53] Noah you can't get into heaven without
[51:56] Jesus Jesus that's right everybody that
[51:59] that was Paul's group saw the angel he
[52:03] was
[52:04] Paul you see what I'm saying it it
[52:06] doesn't mean that there weren't others
[52:08] saved but it means that there's a select
[52:11] group that was able to identify the
[52:13] voice of their
[52:15] age able to identify the angel of their
[52:18] age and those who believe Jesus Christ
[52:21] says believe on him who God has
[52:25] sent and that's what we do we know God
[52:29] sent the prophet of God yes sir like God
[52:33] sent
[52:34] Jeremiah and all the other prophets but
[52:37] just as they did him they did us the
[52:40] same way and so ending this of Jeremiah
[52:44] Jeremiah is just a a
[52:46] shadow of what's going to happen because
[52:50] God destroyed everything tore Jerusalem
[52:53] down tore Jerusalem up and God is not
[52:56] going to just tear Jerusalem up God
[52:58] going to tear up the whole world there
[53:00] going to be a new Earth a new heaven
[53:04] right and the New Jerusalem is built in
[53:07] heaven it comes
[53:09] down from heaven and and brother bandam
[53:12] said that God is now building the New
[53:15] Jerusalem so when all the burning is all
[53:19] over we won't have to worry about no
[53:21] Liars no thiefs no gamblers we won't
[53:24] have to worry about the children of
[53:25] Darkness we won't have to worry about
[53:27] Temptation we can't even imagine it am
[53:30] but that's the word and I loved Jeremiah
[53:34] even though I kind of breeed through it
[53:35] because it was so so much we would have
[53:38] been here for mons maybe a year but my
[53:40] point is uh I was hoping that the people
[53:43] who knew we were reading Jeremiah would
[53:46] read Jeremiah that was the inspiration
[53:48] to get people to read Jeremiah so now
[53:52] I'm not going to tell you what we're
[53:53] next teaching on I'm just contemplating
[53:55] on some things
[53:56] but by the grace of God I hope that we
[53:59] can it will be between Hebrew and Romans
[54:02] maybe
[54:04] Ephesians so that's where we'll be I
[54:07] think we need to go down I won't have to
[54:09] jump with those books because they're
[54:10] not that long and we could we could do
[54:13] that in a shorter period of time so by
[54:16] the grace of God we thank you for your
[54:18] coming and we're five minutes over but
[54:21] we appreciate it let's have stand and
[54:23] have a word of Prayer
[54:27] father God we thank you for your grace
[54:29] and your mercy we thank you for being so
[54:31] good to us you have been better to us
[54:33] than we've been to ourselves I thank you
[54:36] for the little lesson Lord God tonight
[54:38] to know Lord that it's a parallel it's
[54:40] what what's happening now we see the
[54:43] Judgment of the lord we see the
[54:44] Christian going far backwards Lord I
[54:48] mean your Prophet even said that he saw
[54:50] her marching naked to the tune of rock
[54:52] and roll and God help us Lord God to to
[54:56] stay straight in that straight and
[54:58] narrow way and if we out of line if
[55:00] we're out of the footstep please give us
[55:03] Grace to get back in line help us now in
[55:06] your name Jesus Christ as we see that
[55:08] combine coming we see it we can hear it
[55:11] we know it's there and we know God that
[55:13] it's coming and Lord we pray that you
[55:16] would when you do all your Gathering
[55:18] that we'll be gathered oh God into the
[55:21] to to with the weat Lord and not with
[55:23] the tears help us now in Jesus Christ's
[55:25] name we pray amen
