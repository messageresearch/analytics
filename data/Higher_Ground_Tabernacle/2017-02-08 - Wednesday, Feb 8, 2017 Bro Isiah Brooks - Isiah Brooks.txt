for give me J amen as we stand let us turn to Jeremiah I've been in bed practically all day battling demons I'm G give you my best because I'm giving him his best we thank God for his grace and his mercy and what would we say what can we do without him I love the Lord so going to turn right to the scripture without even looking for it we're going to be coming from Jeremiah the 32nd chapter of Jeremiah read the 36 to the 42nd verse Jeremiah 32 beginning at the 36th verse you love the Lord amen and it reads and now therefore thus sayeth the Lord the god of Israel concerning this city there where of ye say it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by The Sword and by the famines and by the pestilence behold I will gather them out of all countries whether I have driven them in my anger and in my Fury and in great wrath and I will bring them again unto this place and I will cause them to dwell safely and they shall be my people and I will be their God and I will give them one heart one way that they may fear me forever for the good of them and for the childrens after them and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with them that I will not turn away from them to do them them good but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me yay I Will Rejoice over them to do them good and I will plant them in this land ass surely with my whole heart and with my whole soul but thus said the Lord like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people so will I bring them all the good that I have promised them you love the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and all that you've done for us Lord no matter how the enemy is trying to afflict my body I I reject it Lord I stand because you said with your stripes we healed I pray father God that you give us the grace to Minister the word tonight Lord circumcise my heart circumcise my spirit oh God that your word will be declared tonight and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated most of us have heard and we know so many things about Israel and all of the pests and trials that they have gone through we know by God's grace that Israel had several prophets Jeremiah was one of the Major Prophets that Israel had and uh we know that when Jeremiah came on the scene God had already told Jeremiah that the people would not repent and that he would be preaching to a hard-hearted people so no matter how much God would warn them through Jeremiah it had already been established that there was no place for repentance I want to say this by the grace of God Only God can give a man repentance repentance is not something that you feel like you want to do God's grace brings repentance you can feel sorry for what you've done but only God can give you true repentance so we realize that it is Grace is his mercy and it has to be his will to do so because remember in the time that Pharaoh tried to repent and every time he tried to repent God would Harden his heart so it is even your repentance is in the hands of the Lord I am so thankful to be one of them one of those people that God had chosen uh to to to to do his will in these last days there was a time that when Babylon took over Israel uh uh is uh and everything thing we find out that there were people who bought land and they bought land and they sealed the deed up in in Earth and vessels because God had promised them that they were going to come back to the land they were being chastised and they had to uh be chastised for 70 years one of the reasons why God uh chose 70 years he took 10 years for every year seven Sabbath there were seven Sabbath amen or 10 that they did not obey God and of course it it came up to uh to equal out uh 70 years and it's because they chose to work when God wanted them to rest now we find out that by God's grace that uh Israel had gotten so off to mock amen they began to just do all kinds of things uh that they knew that Jehovah God wasn't pleased with they did things that that all of their neighboring uh uh tribes or whatever more uh were doing they adopted Canaanite ways and all kinds of ways they adopted they adopted the the the the neighbors God Moab and all of these things knowing that God would be angry with them they took the God house of God and made it a business we've seen that before when Jesus walked into the Temple of Solomon he found that they had made God House of Prayer a a place of of money changing and he was very rought with that we understand that was his righteous indignation that took charge there and he W began to whip them out of the temple so God is looking for people in this last day that will reflect him we understand by God's grace that it is God's uh doing and we understand that it is his pleasure Think About by think about it that God did something from the beginning of time that mankind didn't even understand what he was getting ready to to do we understand we when it comes to Adam and Eve we saw Adam and Eve fall and we thought well praise God it just plunged Us in sin and had no idea by God's grace that this this act was basically the foundation of what God was getting ready to do in way of redemption we understand by God's grace that God showed that Adam was made after the very image and likeness of God God had given him a promise and that promise was to bring forth of his kind but because the woman defiled herself and then Adam defiled himself with the woman mankind was no longer in the image of God they were now in the image of man who was Adam so we realize by God's grace that this was all God's plan you see God is a god of contrast he's one that you'll know he'll let the darkness come in order to reveal light he'll let sickness come in order to reveal himself as a Healer he'll let confusion come in your life just to uh uh reveal to you how he is the peace of God so we realize by God's grace that everything that we see here is not by chance God didn't say well I'm gon throw a few coins out here and let's see how they land and then it work accordingly but everything that God did is so IND detailed that he was able to set it in the heavens as a record amen we realize amen that God's word can never come back void and God he does all of these things because of his own pleasure because of his own mercy and because of his own Grace understand these things there are things that we didn't understand for a long time time Jesus talked about it and he talked about a SE going to seow seed and in that seed he said there were seeds amen and he said uh this man sold good seed and then after him came a bad man man and sold Bad Seeds all right and I thought to myself just the other day what was the difference in the seed and and I believe it was the Holy Spirit that spoke to my heart and said the content the content see things can look exactly the same but it all depends on what's on the inside of the seed that would determine the difference in the seed right because nowadays they can hybrid a seed and it can look exactly like the genuine seed and to the Natural Eye you wouldn't be able to tell the difference but when it comes to the the the the the seed the only way to determine is whether it's real or whether it's fake is to bury the seed plant it and then whatsoever is in the content whatever that's in the seed would then make itself manifest and I thought that is so wonderful Lord amen because this is why God liken his word as the seed Hallelujah because within the seed of God's word is God himself and if that word is properly treated read it directly right it will bring forth God see it ain't the ground that brings forth God it's the seed that brings forth God and so the Lord showed me that this is why God before the foundation of the world planted a seed within the inside of you amen hallelujah because he understood that one day the light will strike that seed and bring forth the content y'all hear what I'm saying see if the real seed is God it can't help but to bring forth God Amen and we came to find out that in the beginning the spoken word was the original seed and if it was the original seed then it's the Original Seed now Hallelujah now God wanted natural seed and this is why he told Adam to be fruitful and multiply but the ultimate goal of God was to bring forth seeds of his kind hello and these seeds would be word seeds this is the difference between us and the Pentecostals because we are the seed of God and they are liken unto the shark Ephesians 1:9 I just want to say I was thinking also about um h a Grace Grace is so amazing I'm G say that again Grace is so amazing and you and I must realize amen that we are only here because of the grace of God you see what I was elected and chos chosen by God it still was Grace because not one of us could have merited his favor at all it was God who chose us it is God who elected us hello and so when we realize this that's why I think about heaven sometime and I think oh my God I'm so glad that we'll have bodies that we won't ever get tired in because I don't know you know there's got to be some rules there's got to be some laws there's got to be something there that's going to have to tell me when to stop and move forward I don't know but I can't hardly wait till I get into that place where I can worship God long as long as I want to without anybody disturbing me when you think about Grace and I'm talking about if if there be any any any age uh that have gone forth that that should appreciate the grace of God this age because this age is the worst age of all we have come at time of harvest we are in a Time the Bible called Dangerous perilous times we are in a Time amen that Daniel said when he saw in a vision he said he said the things that are getting ready to come upon the face of the Earth he said never ever has it ever been before so we realize amen that we're getting ready or the World At Large is getting ready to encounter HHH the Fier Fierce wrath of God like never before y'all hear what I'm saying the days of Noah just cannot compare to what's coming up the days of of of Sodom and gomorra cannot compare to the days that's coming up so look at the contrast look at the contrast because God took a a boat an ark and he saved Noah with an arc but watch Enoch because he realized that Enoch needed to be saved in a different way Hallelujah Enoch had to ascend into a place where the elements of the world couldn't touch him and so we understand by God's grace that God has likened and fashioned us like Enoch KN Hallelujah we won't stay on this Earth but God as according to H Psalms God 27 God will will will catch us up into a secret place Hallelujah a place of Pavilion a place of safety and and you know it's all that's the only way you'll be able to be saved so let me say it like this you can't go to Heaven unless you came from Heaven that's right hallelujah it's only those who have descended can us sin Hallelujah and you must have been with God in the beginning in order to return back to him can you understand what I'm saying because I want you to understand when God comes in a man God quickens that seed not your flesh not your emotions he quickens the seed and when God quickens the seed in you your work is finished why because it is the life of God that now take control God don't need your help oh Lord help me Lord Ephesians 1 9-14 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself now watch this God hid the mystery of his of of all of his his creation into a earth vessel called Jesus Christ hello and that earn vessel was sealed when Jesus was born the devil was so blind the devil went and tried to kill all the children that were two and a half years under thinking that he could kill Jesus but Jesus wasn't just a child he was a word child created by God himself Hallelujah he could have sent Herod could have sent all the forces that he wanted to Hallelujah after Jesus but he could not die Hallelujah any kind of death oh come on somebody understand what I'm saying God had he hid Jesus even the world in itself had no idea who Jesus Christ was and the more I think about it I said think about Israel that little place called Bethlehem and this great big old world it was like a the head of a needle compared to the mass of people that was on the earth and only a few people knew that he ever came y'all hear what I'm saying so if that be the truth how many people going to know when he leaves heaven what the good pleasure which he have purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are in Earth even in him who's Gathering it God's Gathering it who knows wheat from tear God does Jesus said I my sheep Hearth my voice is that right and the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his Hallelujah my my message subject so you know where I'm going is called content of the seed see because this thing won't be able you can't fake it Hallelujah because you got to realize Amen in order for Christ to live you must die that is the law right it is the law since the fall everything that lives must die in order to live again y'all hear what I'm saying see so it can't be you know how can I say it i' I've seen people uh you know they say well well that that's just my personality God is not interested in your personality God is interested in one thing and that's his person in you we to be dead they could have say Paul he's a mean fell but you see nobody really saw Paul just like nobody saw Jesus y'all hear me they could say whatever they want to say but Jesus said I can't do nothing except the father show me everything he tells me to do that what that's what I do is there anybody here that can lay a charge to me for not doing what he told me to do see he really had had no life of his own that's why when they said to Jesus show us a father he said hold up now he said have you been so long with me Hallelujah that you would ask me that question show me the father he said when you see me you see the father see that show that Jesus really had no identity of himself outside of the word of God is that okay now that's the content of that seed yes when you saw Jesus you saw the unveiling of God y'all hear what I'm saying when you saw Jesus you saw the unveiling of God see and that's what we P oh that's Jesus hold up because if you and I are made are we possessed the same seed we are supposed to be the same brother Brooks ain't supposed to be brother Brooks he's supposed to be the unveiling of God for this day and this hour if anybody going to see Jesus they must see Jesus Through us see is his good pleasure and if you really want God to take full control he will I'm G say that again if you really want God to take full control of your life he will you'll never be able to stand before God and said Lord I offered myself and you didn't take me Hallelujah God took a few fish and loaves of bread God took amen two corns from a lady that's all she had hello God will take everything or anything you give him that he might be glorified and whom we have what obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and that's why God said that we should not murmur and complain and God have mercy on me Hallelujah by God's grace I'm looking and I'm trusting that everything comes out of my mouth will be life but even sometime you let little thing slip and all you can do is say God forgive me Hallelujah see this this is about his will the counseling of his will and who in Earth can tell God how to do it God does what he wants to do with you if God wanted the police to come knock on this door today and say you're locked up what you g to say oh my God what are you doing h Hallelujah that's not what the disciples did Hallelujah they began to worship they began to praise God why because they were in a ram and they knew that God was God and they understood no matter what region the demons came out of they had to pass by The Throne of God in order to get permission hello somebody you and I must understand nothing happens to a child of God by chance everything is ordained and predestinated by God even so the Bible said the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by God how you going to get out of what you're going through Joseph said oh Lord I had a dream and I had no idea was GNA get me in this much trouble Hallelujah but never ever do you see in the scripture that Joseph ever complained about his condition why he somehow knew God was gonna get him out you know what you get this thing in your heart you can't explain it but you know God is in control and he's going to fix it that's what you call Revelation is that okay he's going to work it out to the counsel of his will and let me tell you something God will let you go through a situation for years before he changes it most of the time he lets us stay there because our our attitude Hallelujah when Jesus was getting ready to go into the greatest test of his all time you know what he said father not my will but thine be done and that's exactly what God is looking for surrender once you surrender to God he'll move you on but he finds a clay that's hard to be molded a clay that's going to resist his will he'll keep pressing he'll keep pressing until he gets you to fold into what he wants you to F into hello somebody the content of the seed all we've got to do is look at Jesus and we'll know how to act we'll know how to behave we'll know how to pray we'll know how to treat one another if we look at Jesus because he is what was in the seed or he is what is in your seed listen the Bible says what this is a god coming into us and and is what to that we should be to the praise of his glory what is God glory what is his glory you know what God's glory is when God can see the light of himself reflecting through you that's his glory I'm G say that again when God can it Oh Glory that ain't no glory you just said Glory but glory is when when go cuz anybody can say that s and Saint can jump and say Glory see but God's glory is when people can say like they did those Christians were first called Christians at Antioch why because they look like him they walk like him they talk like him the Miracles that followed them were just like Jesus see that is the glory of God in this age when when you in a dark age as it is can defy Satan's Eden and say God is still greater than you even in your own Eden in whom ye also trusted after ye heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise y'all understand that so here it is we understand the Salvation is a process I was just listening to the prophet of God today he was talking about how his m mother whenever she have a dream is always true and he said she had a dream that he was standing by three stairs of steps preaching he said exactly right he said because I taught the justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and so you look at this thing you say well what do you mean see Paul preached the same thing Hallelujah if that wasn't true why would they say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe Hallelujah something people believe in the Holy Ghost drops on them like that some people there's a process I don't care whichever way it comes as long as it comes Hallelujah and when it does it changes you you don't change it Hallelujah y'all have y'all know what I'm saying it's just like you I know what's what we do sometime God try to put a coat on us and you know how we do it you know trying to put it on the on the child's arm and they just hold still hold still hold still hold still all of a sudden you have to jerk them and say hold still put the to put the jacket on them and that's exactly what happens instead of you allowing God to just put the jacket on you you're trying to help God put the jacket on you Hallelujah and then by doing so you working against his will God gives you the Holy Ghost because he will to give it to you it ain't because you've been so good our righteousness is at filth theise says the Lord oh it's good to try to live right and do right but the ultimate thing the whole matter is God have mercy on whom he will oh that's why I love acts 238 the Bible said if you repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so if you ain't got it if you don't have it and you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what made you get baptized because you knew it was a promise and that promise was I'm gonna give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so you have to hold God to his promise Lord I've been baptized I repented and you can't repent no more than God allow you to help us Jesus but when it comes to the Seal of God you and I must understand I'm going tell you something I wish it was so you know you could just go to the grocery store you say I want some of this and I want some of that and I want some of this and I want some and pick it up and leave right then you know Hallelujah but sometime when you ask for God God to do something he waits he does he just don't drop it in your buggy it's his purpose to give it to you because you ask but sometime God just wait to see whether you really wanted bad enough huh you say that's not true yes it is he told those disciples go to Jerusalem T there till you be endured with power amen hallelujah you can't even get people in here three four hours more or less amen 10 days and God made him wait Hallelujah and all along no doubt they tried to figure him out but you see one thing about the content God cannot lie Hallelujah God cannot lie God cannot fail and he never will fail you listen you think you feel good when the Holy Ghost come down oh I'm telling you I'll be feeling good huh but this just Earnest that's just a little taste Hallelujah brother brandom said it it's almost perverted by the time it gets to you cuz when it comes from Heaven it's pure but as it descends Hallelujah it goes through the goes through the atmosphere and all these little things you hear what I'm saying so he said listen this is just the earnest and if you think that little piece of holy ghost that I gave you is wonderful you wait till you get to heaven hallelujah oh I want to say something let me say it like this because brother brand said the Holy Ghost is a gift Hallelujah understand this and it's a he said it's a temporal gift wo hallelujah what is it it's like the life it's like the blood it's the blood that God places in you to develop you to grow you to mature you and all those things but when you get to heaven you'll have your own oh Lord y'all you will be the Holy Ghost I don't know what else to say you will that's what's in the content of the seed God himself is that right God is using you as a incubator as a housing to produce himself in a mature State I don't know what else to say the content I got the Holy Ghost oh and the h Holy Ghost got me that's what I'm talking about it ain't no use in you having the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost don't have you the Holy Ghost wants you he wants to control you your minds and your thoughts and everything else but you've got to surrender Hallelujah I say that because I realize in this day surrendering is not easy it is flooded with pride this age arrogance and everything else nobody being humble is is weakness and all of this kind of stuff right but God don't care what they doing in the age God know what he puts in you and all he has to do is Quicken it Hallelujah I love the Lord Jesus because you know all of us have different um levels of faith you know you know some may have a little more than the other but it's the same Faith same God come on somebody and the only reason why God would give you more or give someone less is because maybe he's got more for you to do and less for somebody else to do but it doesn't make the man who does more greater than the one that's less Hallelujah my little toes you don't even think nothing about your toes but you miss one of them let one of them get cut off or something Hallelujah sometime you forget they're there until you stump it and they're very important y'all hear what I'm saying without those toes those that body wouldn't be able to be balance itself such a small thing oh yeah nothing about the the the thing in there it doesn't move doesn't do anything but you know get on your nerve grow all the time but you take that fingernail off that finger you go buy you some y'all hear what I'm saying those small things are important that's what Paul was trying to tell us everything is the body is important everything has been quickened to be made hair thank God we just don't have a face full of noses but but everything in the body is important Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying different gifts and everything else but it faith is something that God gives a man and you can hope for Faith all you want to but if God has determined in his in your life that give you a certain portion that's all you getting but it will be enough to make a [Laughter] Rapture that's all I'm talking about Hallelujah I don't know where I fit there in heaven I just want to fit y'all hear what I'm saying it's the content that's why John says oh little children I shouldn't have to write unto you about love is love see he talking about the content of the seed and if that seed has been quickened in you that's love love what my friends love my neighbor no love everybody God didn't give us room to set choose pick and choose the ones who we love love your enemy love those that spitefully use you do good unto them that's the content of the seed hello somebody Philippians 2 13 through 15 say for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmuring and disputing hello I see people doing that surely when people do that is not is not the Holy Spirit that's doing it Hallelujah but God wants me to do this and I remember one of when I I Pastor the church I don't want to say to too much but I Pastor the church and these two little boys would sing together sometime and and when they were sing they were cute regardless to the noise they were making but so happened one of the little boys thought he could out sing the other one and the boy who thought he could out sing the other one was the one that was making most of the noise but when I saw the competition in such a way I stopped it and I basically didn't say both y'all need to stop because y'all can't sing I just gave the them other things to do instruments or so Hallelujah because I knew the talent wasn't singing but because they were musically inclined I felt like something that they could do in the field of music that would benefit the church and it did y'all hear what I'm saying one continued to sing and the other one continue to do other things glory to God it just brought back memories you know when it comes to the content and that's how it is with us it's what's in us that makes us different come on somebody listen if we look at Flesh and Blood right here nobody is better than the other we're guilty we're all Sinners wred amen hallelujah but it is the seed of God in you that makes you different and gives you worth y'all hear what I'm saying it makes you different and it gives you worth because remember now everything that is of no value will be burned see how he loves us he saw it he knew it and he planted his seed in US listen God wouldn't have saved the world if there wasn't nothing there for him to save hello just opposing the story went different and everything on Earth was serpents God wouldn't have wasted his time there wouldn't have been a Calvary that's deep in it I want you to think about it there would not have been a Calvary calary for was for you and me calary was God's redeeming plan and you cannot redeem something that's not yours at the first oh Lord have mercy I I I tell you what I feel really feel like shouting think about it content is what's in the seed that makes us different from everybody else Hallelujah Craig explained it so well he talk about that life coming from the seed all the way up to the Shu and everything else to Tal same life but listen every age that life moved on we can't be shock why because this is seed time shock is already established shock has already been judged this is seed time and if it is seed time that means that's all God looking for somebody help me that's all all he looking for he ain't looking for Shar he's looking for seed and at the end time the Bible said there will become a separation you see well win the separation it is now he said I send my angels to separate the wheat from the tear or the shark and what is this message doing separating the wheat bringing a separation right in the eyes of the people and if that be true it also declare that this is Harvest [Music] Time Harvest Time you know it's amazing because I remember when I was a little boy and they you learning how to read one of the things they would have you go first things you would come in in in front of the book you would have the what they call the table of content and that table of content will list all of the different subjects in that book so that you could break it down so you could have reference if you were looking for something to go find it in a certain area hallelujah hallelujah well in the table the content of this this table we're not looking in the in the in in in the in the uh uh the Old Testament we're not looking amen just just in in in what you call amen the the uh shark age y'all hear Shar age organizational age denominational age you're looking I want to know what the seed is about in this book so you look and you see there in the seed and you say okay let me go read this thing and the thing will tell you everything you need to know about the seed understand this book is called The Book of Life or the last book of life whichever way you want to look at it but you got to realize that the Book of Life in the content will tell you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the almighty God he's the Alpha and the Omega see what I'm saying it's the content you know it's amazing you know it's like a bag of potato chips you know and those things are dangerous but nevertheless certain bags of potato chips is not they're not appealing to you especially if you taste them already and you didn't like them right but if there's a thing about Laz potato chips every time you see that bag it's going to bring memories because you know the content folks y'all hear what I'm saying it's like a it's like a drunk of every time you see a bottle of wine amen something happens oh come on somebody why he knows what wine is all about now he might not know the very flavor the very taste of it but he knows the effect and if you say well what do you mean brother wine will always a good wine will always stimulate you and if you can't read read this Bible and become stimulated somehow something wrong yes sir Hallelujah something's wrong because the content of this Bible is supposed to also bring you Joy amen hello and the Bible said in the in his presence there is fullness of joy so if you reading this thing with the carnal mind you're only going to get carnal precepts or thoughts but if you approach it in the right way and says Lord Quicken the words of God to me then this content will become alive see this is just dead letter here but when the spirit gets inside of this it it it comes alive it becomes a real content of God because Jesus said my word are Spirit y'all hear what I'm saying let me hurry up now we realize listen if we could understand that this the thoughts of God like it says in Psalms 1397 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them how many of y'all believe that y'all hear what I'm saying my point is God in the content of God God Mercy his thoughts are precious concerning you well how you GNA let the devil make you think you're going to hell how you going to make the let the devil make you think you gonna miss the Rapture oh let me hurry up because I'm going too slow here listen Proverbs 8:22 and 32 I'm G speed it up the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old the Lord possessed me why don't you say it instead of say you say it say it with your mouth the Lord possess me confession is good say it again the Lord possessed me I was shut up from Everlasting from the beginning orever the ever the Earth was what do you mean to tell me that I was before the Earth was and then God going to let me just fade away absolutely not Hallelujah brother vam talks about a eagle who had a couple of eggs amen and she misplaced one one and she searched all over for it that's exactly what God did for you that's exactly what God did for me Hallelujah and when we heard that eagle cry it gave us our identity something struck the seed and somehow you came to life you can't come you can't you can't be dead and love this message I'm G say it again you cannot be dead and love this messag amen because this message is Jesus Christ amen and the only way you can love it is because you got an understanding of it y'all hear what I'm saying you have to have an understanding of what this message is my Creator amen am I was created by the God of this message however you want to say it Hallelujah I know God because I have the content of God Amen y'all hear me I know what he's requiring is this day because he didn't leave the book seal remember he told Israel and Jeremiah you GNA come back seal that bottle up and I want you to put it in a place so that when you return you can open it up and you can declare to all who are around the land that's really yours y'all hear what I'm saying and if the world and the devil would have known what Jesus was all about he would have never crucified him y'all hear what I'm saying because in that Earthly vessel was God Almighty wait a minute the Bible says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead body now question is where were you where were you because remember amen the first Adam he had a male and female and the second Adam had to have the same thing oh come on somebody because out of him you came who was the feminine part of Christ that's the way were so what are you saying I was with him just like Eve was with Adam I was with him I was set up when God created me and made me he made I was in him and before he made me in Christ I was in him oh come on somebody don't you understand what I'm trying to say this thing it's so it's so wonderful this thing got to go far forward we can't stay here we can't stay in this little church setting hallelujah oh come on somebody I'm going say it again we cannot remain here and expect a Rapture The Life of Christ must be seen and you and I must sell out amen every individual is responsible for himself or herself but the truth of the matter is the supernatural God must be seen in your life not tomorrow now this is the [Music] day if you was there you got to prove that you was there words won't work for us no more you got to prove you was there amen you have to have some evidence GL you were there Hallelujah brother random said not just a title de Hallelujah he said you got Lord excuse me he said you got to have the [Laughter] abstract Hallelujah don't you understand your title deed is God himself he's the owner he's the owner and you got to have that to prove you was with them oh Lord help me Jesus Hallelujah he said when there was no death I was brought forth when there was no fountain abounding with water before the mountains was settled before the hills was I brought forth he and while as yet he had not made the Earth for the fields nor for the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the earth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave the see his decree that the waters should not pass his com commandment when he appointed The Fountains of the earth when I I then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him oh somebody somebody if y'all don't start saying amen I'm gonna quit this message y'all hear what I'm saying amen I'm fighting Devils up here as it is so y'all gonna help me preach now I'm G shut it down is that nice enough is that right what do parents do when he established the clouds above and when he had strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave the sea his decree that the wat should not pass his Commandments when he appointed the Fountain of the earth then was I by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitation of I'm reading the word I'm not giving you my thoughts right now I'm reading the word and the word deserves amen rejoice in the habitation of the part and my delight were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me oh ye children for blessed are they that what keep my ways amen and you and I must realize that's the key keeping God's way look through the whole content of the Bible and you'll find out that God has always exalted the people to keep his way everybody that kept his way was saved everybody that didn't keep his way was was not saved is that right hallelujah what was the main thing God one of the major thing God said unto brother Brown because you have chosen the harder way which is what my way you have a a huge portion of Heaven that's awaiting you just keeping God's way not the way of the Baptist or Methodist Catholic or whatever but the way of the word hallelujah now Faith is the substance of things hope for and the evidence of Things Not Seen Hallelujah is that all right cuz you and I must realize amen that What God Says listen when Christ came they had no idea what what he was packing but brother Brandon liken him as the Easter seal and when that Easter seal was broken guess what was H what happened that Easter seal which was Christ which was the life of God and then went down into the hell Hallelujah set the captives free in in in the re y'all hear what I'm saying Paradise Hallelujah had not the seal been broken there would not have been a resurrection because within Christ Christ knew what was in the content he said no man take my life he said but I'll lay it down and if I lay it down I'll pick it back up Hallelujah that's the content that's why Paul can say if that Spirit be in you that was also in Christ Jesus that is Quicken him is Mor body it will also Quicken yours I tell you if a man that feels like me can do what I do right now what I'm doing now by God's grace you can do too let's not resist the Holy Spirit we got to do better Hallelujah you love the Lord because we realize by God's grace he said take when and when when when when he when they were instructed to buy the field and and purchase it he says now I want you to take this thing put it in an earth and vessel but he was talking about Jesus Christ right because remember Abraham when he bought the field he wasn't gonna take no he wasn't taking nothing free right remember he said no no no no I'm going to pay for this because if I don't you gonna think that you gave me some kind of Victory see what I'm saying there's always a price to pray pay even when it comes to Christ you said well salvation is free but you still pay you pay with your life you got to give your life up in order to get Christ's life in you let me move on so you and I realize by God's grace that see if the seed is in you you got to recognize and I tell you what you can't have law and Grace at the same time but then God ain't going to put up with disgrace either y'all hear what I'm saying the truth of the matter is I can't tell you whether who you are only you know who you are you can't tell me who I am and I can't tell you who you are only God knows who you are right brother Browner preached to Millions but he didn't know who he who they were until they declared themselves to be Hallelujah when the man came up said I don't care what you do raise the dead or whatever he said I ain't going to believe he said that's all right this word wasn't written to the unbelievers it was written to the Believers Hallelujah see the point is if we're going to believe this message we got to go with all our hearts amen I'm preaching from the pull pit all the way back to the door let's stand thank you Lord Heavenly Father we come before you we thank
