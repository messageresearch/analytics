TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Genesis 17 And1 and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect amen Jude 121 Hallelujah thank you Jesus I feel the presence of the Lord the presence of the Lord is here amen I feel it in the atmosphere amen Jude 1:21 24 excuse me now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy Amen to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen thank God for the one who can present us hallelujah let us pray father God we come before you and we thank you Lord Jesus for your Grace and your mercy Lord we just thank you Father for your presence thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we give you honor we give you glory we give you praise and father we say Lord forgive us of all our sins all our shortcomings Lord God all of the things that we allowed in our mind our spirit that wasn't Lord please in your sight Lord I pray that you wash us clean I pray father that you let your Holy Father father oh God our Father burn every demon away from our soul and our spirit and our body we ask these things in Jesus Christ's Name Lord as we approach you Lord we approach you in that place that only place of worship and that's under the blood of your dear son Jesus Christ we come in Your Name Lord Jesus in your name only in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen we like to entitle this message the inner man now we looking at this and we see God coming uh at a time uh when Abraham is old 99 amen and you're thinking now if you think about it you think about being 99 uh how many more years you got to live but God comes to Abraham and I'm going to tell you something at 999 if if you're not set in your ways you're set in your ways and God comes at a time and tells Abraham walk before me and be thy perfect now you and I know by the grace of God Amen that could not have impossible amen for Abraham on his own ability amen or by his own ability there was no way that Abraham could do this it took us a prophet to tell us and understand what uh uh Perfection is our Perfection never uh did come by our efforts or what we do and and you'll see that by the grace of God that this what we're speaking of Amen surely must come from God and understand this that the only thing that enter into heaven is perfect it is a place of perfection not 99.5 or or 99.9% it is 100% perfect now you and I couldn't do it but God is the one who's doing it for us as I read in Jude now remember Judas is the last book to Revelation Judah is telling you now there is a God and I know who he is who's able to present you faultless before amen so we looking at this thing and We Know by the grace of God that there's only one true Overcomer and that's Jesus and in order to be an overcomer you've got to have the Overcomer on the inside Hallelujah glory to God amen amen going to Ephesians 3:16 please now we're talking about uh God presenting us faultless that excites me it really gets me excited when I think about he is the one who is is the judge the jury the attorney Hallelujah the prosecutor if you want to say but the point is that he finds no fault amen now how do you know that that's what he told us God done already judge this thing and the the the verdict was no fa that means he presenting us faultless amen woo Ephesians 3:16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glor glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that is only way you could ever be strengthened you must have the spirit of God on the inside amen oh come on somebody that Christ what what's the purpose of him your inner man being strengthened that Christ May dwell in Your Heart by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love I did not say that Christ dwell in Your Heart by hope I said by faith faith is a revelation and you know that you know that you know that he's on the inside Hallelujah that you may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread and the length and the depth and the height amen come on somebody can you measure it like that like I heard a psalmist say can you measure the grace of God he said is like Calvary on the cross this way amen there is no ending to it hallelujah amen and so is it with God you can never put a ceiling to him hallelujah hallelujah you can't fiz him in a wall Hallelujah you can't put a bottom to him amen cuz he's in All Above All and in you all he's everywhere and you can never stop it'll take eternity to continue to know about godu oh thank you Lord to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God now This Love Of Christ surpass knowledge that means you can't um figure them out by letter am you've got to have an experience now let me say it like this when the Holy Ghost comes in you realize and recognize I'm not worthy I didn't do nothing to deserve it and here God has chosen me it doesn't stop there it's just a beginning of this love affair cuz that's what it is it is a real love affair between God and his bride Hallelujah now unto him that is able to to do exceed l oh God lord I've had this problem for a long time you know the problem is amen you I all of us got to surrender it all amen hallelujah amen you've got to surrender all you can hold on to nothing everything must be surrendered Hallelujah come on somebody amen amen now unto him that is able to do what exceeding abundantly above all all that we ask or think amen hallu so he's basically saying don't limit God because you think your problem or your river is uncrossable Lord hallelujah or you think a mountain that you cannot climb right don't climb it move it out of the way amen I heard a song Lord you don't have to move my Mountain no I want him to move it amen I don't want to climb it if I can move it Hallelujah amen so we looking at these things and because he in you know he never taught us to CL told us to climb the mountain he told us to move it when it's an obstacle hallelujah amen now Jacob L is something different but let me move on Amen now to him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think the problem is is not that we we we know God can do it but the Bible said you know we have our patience our patience in our patience possess ye our souls waiting on God and waiting for God is that right that has been one of the things that Satan has gotten most Believers on is because of their impatience oh he he didn't do it he did do it the moment you asked him to do it he did it the only thing that that that would stop him from doing it is sin or is not his will but when it's his will he'll let you know when it's not his will he'll let you know come on somebody amen amen so now unto him that is able to end do dece I'm going to read that again abundantly above all that we ask or think according to your power no according to the power that where worketh in us he didn't say work above us he didn't say work around us he said work in us the power that works in US it works in you it is the thing that's building you it is the thing that changed you it is the Eternal thing that could never die it works that same power that saves you amen it's the same power that answer all your prayer amen unto him be glory in the church right by Christ Jesus throughout all ages amen not some ages all ages amen starting from Ephesians all the way to Le seal all the way into the bride age amen God's grace is with us amen and His glory is remains amen he said World Without End I love that World Without End that means I don't stop amen hallelujah is that all right let's let's let's let's move to Romans 8 please Romans 8 now he's going to present you faultless woo come on somebody but you got to let him work on the inner man you got to let him work on the inner man that's right God working on the inner man Hallelujah I'm so glad he's the one that's working amen I'm resting while he's working amen amen glory to God you love the Lord Romans 8 and 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God you know what that mean that means they that those who do not have the Holy Ghost amen right you can't please him cuz you're walking in the flesh amen amen but that next verse says but ye are not now he defines it but you say I got the Holy Ghost yes and I did wrong yes but you're not in the flesh amen that's what the word of God said but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you Hallelujah see you you're not in the flesh and that's what the devil tricks us he makes us think oh I'm In the Flesh no you're not if the Holy Ghost is in you you can't be in the Holy Ghost and In the Flesh at the same time amen if he dwells in you you are not in the flesh you say well what you mean let's go to 81 so you can understand because you're not in the flesh there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen but if the devil can get you constantly condemning yourself when you're not even condemned amen God can't condemn you if there's no sin to see you're under the blood he's not calling you to to ride that condemnation no sir listen the Bible says amen that's what the Old Testament people that's what killed them they couldn't have a good conscience toward God amen amen but he whom the son is set free is free indeed the whole purpose behind the Holy Spirit right now is not to condemn you but to build his character in you you must let him build your character amen you see what brother should not confess your sin yes but understand God Amen the blood of Jesus right there has blocked you already has covered that otherwise God would be angry with youen oh Lord help me you know uh uh that's what the word of God says right amen there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after The Spirit Well brother Brooks how do I know I'm not walking after the flesh but ye are not in the flesh but the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you huh that Holy Ghost in you that Bible said the Bible said if that seed remaineth in you you cannot sin amen we have false folks but we don't have sin come on somebody you got to be either virtuous or unver virtuous you got to be pure and holy before God or Unholy and unpure when the Holy Ghost is there that's all God sees that is your to Bren the death angel will pass over you Hallelujah when the blood of Jesus Christ is placed on the doorpost of your heart that's why the devil don't want you to get the Holy Ghost because he knows once you get it Hallelujah you stepped out of time into eternity Hallelujah come on somebody you what brother BR what were you saying let me read a few scriptures here Revelations 512 saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was sayain to to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen worthy Hallelujah worthy right Revelations 5:9 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof love for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and Nation not that you're going to redeem us you have already redeemed I am redeemed the song say unto God already amen brought back Hallelujah can't be taken back by the devil I'm I've already been purchased by the blood of the Lamb so what are you saying brother I'm saying the work is finished that's what the Bible said before the foundation the work was already finished but we came at the end of this age now we can see it now we can experience amen all that God is doing Hallelujah glory to God is that all right now you say well what do you mean this is what I love about the Lord Jesus Christ God just didn't walk away what did God do he took that same power that raised him from the dead and brought it back to the church amen same power not some lukewarm laid whatever same power amen he took that same power and put it back into the church and guess what it is that's oh oh I'm jumping almost but that's why it's so important to get the Holy Ghost because that is your de declaration that he lives how do you know he lives he lives in me he lives in youj come on somebody if somebody else is in your house and you don't know it something's wrong with you amen amen huh amen is that all right look what he did when God comes alone and what was this all about remember amen when Adam Adam and Eve Sinn they lost it they lost the the title deed they lost that that that that Eternal part that was there on the inside of them had not God slain a lamb before the foundation of the world and slew a lamb there for them they would have been lost am but they lost that Holy covering come on what was that that was God sh kind of Glory that is the only real holy covering amen it was a kind of Glory that they lost Hallelujah and when they lost that the two the CH stood at the gate the East Gate said you can't come back in the way you are you're filthy Earth yes your Earth is filthy your Earth is polluted you can't come back in here because amen the holy spirit is a dove oh come on I'm coming to it now listen when he came Amen in Matthew 2818 he says Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth amen I love that scripture because right after that he said uh then uh then he then gave he P the power amen right to what Sons and Daughters of God Amen but after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive what power amen amen hallelujah power right that power comes in to do what what power God didn't give you let's say this is power amen let's say this is power God didn't give you some power he gave you the power amen what was the power himself amen he couldn't give you nothing less than that it was himself that he gave to you the same power that raised him from the dead is a save power he gave you that's the Holy Ghost if that spirit that was that was in Christ Jesus if it be in you as it Quicken his body it will also Quicken your moral body The Same Spirit that means all power is in you am all power now I can't get you to believe it but you got to believe it you got to receive it people of God that's where it is all power in Heaven and Earth you say oh brother BRS I want to be saved I want to be resurrected I am the resurrection I am and that's what you must say when because it's God in you saying I am the resurrection Hallelujah now listen that inner man that's what he's after he's after that Holy place that place amen that we allow to contaminate is that right amen that's what God came to restore amen the true place of his worship hello it was the true place of his worship that God came back to restore think about it God has been wanting to occupy the hearts of men ever since the fall can you imagine what it looked like to God Amen having the Ark of the Covenant on a on on in a box when he knew where it's supposed to be amen oh my God hallelujah amen God looked for us because he wanted amen His Image to live and to reflect in the hearts and through the hearts of men now here it comes amen 1 Timothy 6:15 it goes on to say which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of king and the Lords of Lords now this scripture came to me while we were fellowshipping uh today with Brother Richard a little bit there and he brought that quote about how the the um when the squeeze come how that this this third pool will be in such an effect amen and and you know it's going to take that because I think the squeeze is going to knock out all the nonsense amen amen you know what I'm saying we're not just a wo The Squeeze is coming we need to thank God why because you how how hard are we trying we're trying so hard y'all know what I'm saying but it takes an an an an emergency it take a a scene of urgency sometime to make us really focus on what we here for and what we come to do amen that was a powerful thing to me and I thought oh Lord that's right he's the only potentate Hallelujah he's the only Authority y'all know what I'm saying touch not my oil and my wine that was God said that and the devil can't touch it amen no matter how he tries he might AFF afflict your body he might he might cause kind of illness frustrations all of those things but he cannot touch the oil and the wine why because the only potentate has said so Jesus Christ the only Power the only Authority amen he's the author and the finisher he knows the beginning and the end and like I said in Bible Study last night he causes us to Triumph huh y'all don't believe that he causes us to Triumph when Abraham was failing him Abraham never failed him he was failing him God told Abraham separate yourself from l in other words don't even bring light with you amen Abraham brought life and didn't look like Abraham was going to get rid of him either so what did God do allow the devil to go in there and frustrate the herdmans amen he caused Abraham to Triumph by separating himself from not and that's when God came in and did what he did with Abraham Hallelujah you don't have to worry God will cause you to Triumph you say God I can't get over this I can't get through this I can't get past this amen but I need your help you better be careful what you ask for Hallelujah because God will cause you to Triumph amen when he favors you not one enemy will triumph over you and he does favor you Hallelujah is that all right amen now let me go on now I'm coming amen because we fail to see what real genuine Holiness is you know we were in the Holiness people church and the apostolics and this and that amen and so we we had an idea or thought we did but it was all law all law you know what they did to us it looked good from the outward side right but the resurrection doesn't start outwardly the Resurrection start inwardly it's in then out not out then in y'all hear what I'm saying amen so we thought it we knew what it really was but amen all it was was law that's why most of the people didn't want to do it amen right oh yes sir they'll sneak with the skirts on on the outside and all under side underneath they got the pants and when they get to school they take the skirts off and wear the pants that's what law would do magnify the sin amen come on somebody amen but when you got the Holy Ghost the nature changes that you don't even think about it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen now genuine Holiness coming from Hebrews chapter 7 in 1957 he said he said there's the real Holiness in the church there's genuine Holiness the Holiness not of you but of Christ I have no Holiness to present to him but I'm trusting in his oh his grace and I have it in my heart I've unmar it nothing I can do to deserve it but by Grace he called me invited me to come and I looked to him and he took the desires away from me amen amen there it is if you let God take the desire away that's what you pray God take the desire because once the desire is taken there is no temptation I make look what he says I make thousands of mistakes each each month in each year certainly I do but when I see I'm wrong I say God I didn't mean to do it am you know my heart I didn't mean to do it I was trapped into that I didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord if I've done wrong to my brother I say brother forgive me I didn't mean to do it that certainly God knows my heart oh there you are there's the blood sacrifice there's the power of the Gospel that only church moving on Hallelujah not because something you've done is something you had nothing to do with amen there's the atonement now see he's telling you something amen that's all God asked us to do keep it right how do you keep it right not that you're not going to make mistakes but you make it right by confession amen if you offend a wrong God you make it right with God if you offend or wrong your brother you make it right with your brother or your sister whoever but listen that's how you keep it right if you think you're going to walk through the day without making a mistake you are sincerely wrong amen but guess what your flesh has not been redeemed yet condemned sin is condemned in the flesh locked in there locked the door has been locked the window's been shut and condemnation has been written on it hallelujah amen falling apart on you right but that's not what I'm working with I'm working with the inner man amen hallelujah is that right he goes says now this mckc he said I want to tell you nothing uh another thing did you ever take uh three corners piece of glass you take a piece of glass that's three corners and lay it in the sun uh just let the sun uh can hit it it'll produce seven perfect colors a three cornered piece of glass will produce a rainbow that's exactly right come on somebody you take a three corner piece of glass you got justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and it produce Jesus amen amen it a produced Jesus hallelujah amen come on James let's go to James so we can understand by the grace of God where we at here God building on us God changing us God working in US amen God wanting to do something Amen to change our lives hallelujah amen and I believe that's the season we're in remember I told you amen the the other uh yesterday uh when he said uh when those 70 turned around from him and Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood brother said God diminish H he didn't use that word and I have to find that quote to make it right but then he goes on to sayen in other words God stopped the Miracles for a while the supernatural so that he could teach them see and look what people say well I ain't no Miracles and stuff happening in your church no but I'm being taught Hallelujah I'm seeing God in a way that I've never seen before by eating his flesh and drinking his blood hallelujah amen that's the miracle I'm looking at right now the trying formation of this old boy you might not see it but it's transforming it's changing from glory to glory hallelujah hallelujah that's where I'm looking at now and see he tested them amen if you want to believe all that other stuff you can go too uh Peter and y'all Peter says not so where else I'm going to go are you going to go no but I know you got the words to eternal life see you got the words to eternal life so where else can I go is that all right James 1 please we're going to read the 13th and the 14th verses says uh let's let's let's go up to the 12th verses 12th verse blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord had promised to them that love him now watch this he said let no man there's a difference between God trying uh allowing Satan to tempt you because really if there's no desire in you remember Jesus said I have no darkness in me that's where we are striving to have no darkness in Us in other words if there's no Darkness there is no pool amen amen see it's only a pull when you've got something in there for Satan to pull on Amen blesses the man that in endure Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man in other words I looked that up that means to be tested in a bad sense see God ain't going to come and test you in a bad sense right he'll let Satan come or Satan will know what's in you by your actions what did he do he walked before the angels of God is that right yeah yeah and God started a a conversation with him amen what are you doing they say oh I've been going to and fro everywhere you he yes but let me ask you something have you considered my servant job now he started the war here is job on Earth having not have no idea of the conversation that's going on up in heaven but one thing job did he kept his Integrity y'all hear what I'm saying he didn't understand but he kept his Integrity he knew that God was holy God was righteous amen and he knew he had done all he knew how to do amen y'all hear what I'm saying come on somebody we look at this thing and here I look at job because you know why the children of Israel didn't even have the character job had job lost everything his children his house his cattle he lost everything and then on top of that he gets sick now you you would you would think he was cursed he wasn't cursed the reason for the trials because he was blessed but you see our trials as we think oh I must be cursed the devil God must don't like me or something that's nonsense he's trying to see so you can see what's on the inside of you amen amen he's favoring you when Satan comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard and you and I supposed to be that hallelujah amen you can't murm and complain that's real serious issues with God Amen have you ever heard it before you on the job and you complaining about the boss he hears about it he said if you don't like the way I managed this place you can go that's exactly what Jesus said that's what God did in the wilderness when they didn't like his management they had to go amen and he said no rehiring either you're not going to get rehire you're finished amen that's how God is you don't like the way he's managing your life give it over to the devil and let's see how he does with it am I it making sense can't have two bosses you got to have one or the other am ain't God good to us you can't say well Lord you know I no no no no no no when you fall that's your fault right because you were drawn away with your own lust and your own entice if you didn't have it in your heart it would have never never happened somewhere you let it get down in there that demon it might not be in your soul but it could be in your spirit that'll cause you to fall too we're working with the Inner Man the Inner Man the real you amen not this house of clay this thing is such a liar it is such a deceiver come on somebody it's part serpent whether you realize it or not and that devil this thing will trick you to do all kinds of things but that ain't who you're supposed to be listening to Growing Up In Christ growing up in Christ 2 Corinthians 10 please growing up that's what God is saying grow up second Corinthians 10 ain't God good to us folks you know I you know why I'm happy cuz I can hear God has giv me ears to hear and the word of God say blesses the man who hear it Hallelujah continually to hear it amen the saying is of this book think about it you're blessed cuz you continue to hear because if you continue to hear it would be a continuation of yourself trying to obey or wanting to obey you couldn't even hear if God didn't give you Grace to hear is that okay 2 Corinthians 10 please beginning at the third verse is this okay for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh now it almost seemed like a contrad contradiction but he didn't say w though we walk after the flesh he said we walk in the flesh because that's the only thing we got to walk in amen if you don't have flesh you're dead you're gone right but your flesh is your house that's the only thing you got to walk in somebody say oh my goodness you know she was worshiping the Lord but she was in the flesh what else she going to be in that's all got I mean we must understand by the grace of God Amen the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds I'm going tell you something you know what has gotten most of us in trouble that little red thing right there amen amen blessings and cursing right there that thing right there get you in trouble all the time oh I hadn't felt the anointing of God in a long time check out the tongue what have you said what have you discussed what have you said about others that you shouldn't say what is it that comes out of your mouth in a way of judgment oh I'm getting to it in just a moment cuz you got a certain kind of nature that can't stand that kind of stuff amen hello has anybody anybody else been guilty besides me I wish I could uh be in a place where I can preach down at you but I can't cuz we on the same level Hallelujah ain't God good to us amen listen uh uh goes on uh starting at the third verse I think I I read that a little bit let me for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds now he says listen this is a mighty thing it ain't an almost amen it's a Almighty amen God working amen pulling these listen there ain't a thing that really that that is Holy that is righteous anything that is pure and clean and you ask God forward he'll give it to you there is no way that God is going to keep anything righteous from you if you hunger and thirst after the righteousness what did he say you shall be filled that's the word but here it is your mind again right we've been preaching on that mind here is your mind again you got to train this thing or let the Holy Ghost Train it yes sir casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Wonder Glory wo and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled Revenge it means to let people know I didn't mean to do it I mean I didn't mean to walk that way I didn't mean to act like that I didn't mean yeah just like you brought it on you take it out amen hallelujah y'all know how that is you know a lot of time people don't like to say I'm sorry they like to show you but you didn't show me with your with your actions you show told me with your mouth huh out of your heart you ought to say I'm sorry now I I I know some people have received that I will too you know what I mean you do me wrong and stuff and you want to bring a gift by the house I'll receive it y'all understand what I'm saying I mean you know because I don't you don't have to get on your knees and say oh would you please forgive me we're brothers and sisters in Christ right like brother bam said when that fell talked to his wife bad that day amen and then she started crying and he said oh she'll get over it walked out the door down the road and mean he started thinking amen my what if she died before I he come back in the house repentant right he finds her behind the door he hugs her and gives her a real kiss and she kisses him back he never said a word but in that action was forgive me honey I love you right he walks out the door H smiling and she comes on the porch smiling like she always doen huh I'm telling you your words is the thing that's condemning you is that all right oh when you're tempted you draw away with your own lust Hallelujah come on Philippians 3 and 3 now I'm working this thing tonight by his grace amen because I want you to see this that this thing that God is doing with us is wonderful while the devil is building his Empire God is building his and I'm so glad Hallelujah that God is building a perfect statue of a man in the garden of Satan's Eden Venus fly traps and all them poison flowers out there amen thank you Lord amen you know that's the truth amen Philippians 3:3 let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory am I in the right place no but that sure sound good but in loneliness of mind let us esteem others better than th oh you know the Holy Ghost is perfect that wasn't even one of my scriptures but it was his that's that was Philippians 2:3 now let's go to three three amen hallelujah amen for we are not the circumcision which worship God for we excuse me I'm sorry we are the circumcision which work worship God in spirit am and rejoicing in Christ Jesus now that is amazing he said you're worshiping we are circumcised which which causes us basically to worship God in spirit and rejoicing in Christ Jesus amen and have no confidence in the flesh amen come on somebody Amen in other words amen I'm looking at him he's my righteousness he's my Holiness he's my savior he's my Lord he's my deliverer he's my everything and I'm nothing amen why should I have confidence in this thing when it let me down all of those years and and if I let it do it now it would but when you don't have confidence in it you don't trust it amen hallelujah amen I was talking brother Keith on the phone and you know this is the truth I said you know sometime we got to be like Joseph right right listen you sitting in the public place and you feel that Spirit looking at you and carrying on like that I said you you can rebuke it all you want because that's what that's what Joseph tried to do but that devil was a stubborn devil that devil wanted Joseph come on somebody and you know what that devil pursued him in spite of his rebuking it what do you do when that happen run it's time to it's if you

you got me under control yeah you wait you wait see you can't trust him you can't trust him amen with with 1 Peter 4 we're going to read uh by the grace of God uh verse 1 and two for as much then as Christ have suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that have suffered In the Flesh have cease from sin y'all know what I mean it's painful sometimes to not do sin y'all know what I'm talking about when you resist the devil your flesh cry out you're killing me and that's exactly what you're [Music] doing right amen that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God that's why we do it because we know it's the will of God to kill that old man y'all think y'all feeling I don't know I know you felt the Holy Ghost many of you have and I tell you what that's a good feeling but think about it that feeling penetrates and make this mu flesh feel good what about when that glorious one come wo my God we can't even imagine it oh we can't even imagine it but I'm looking for mine I tell you what I know it's out there that's right and I'm looking for mine hallelujah amen can can we let me let me go to one more scripture first John please first John because see when you when you got to arm yourself right arm yourself amen uh uh to to deal with this thing is that right amen a that means you got you you at battle with it so you can't go go without your armor you got to have your arm on and you got to believe that you know you waking up every day oh the devil you think the devil going to take a vacation he never does right he'll invade your sleep if he came that's the devil right invade your sleep and then make you feel all condemned or whatever the case may be when you wake up I know what I'm talking about amen so therefore amen you got to arm yourself you got to keep your arm on Amen when you go to bed keep it on Allelujah glory to God Amen you take a good soldier amen when he lay down his best friend is buying sir that's right he come up swinging you better know what you better be careful how you wake him up amen first John amen first John God is so good to us amen amen hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now we can take that scripture and say well I know he came in the flesh amen 2,000 years ago he came in the flesh since then amen he's come in mine am he's com in yours that is to recognize now you said well when you do that what am I saying when you say that Jesus Christ in come has come into your flesh you saying I and the father we're one amen amen and you bore the name of Jesus Christ let me tell you something the devil got something working out there for you amen he got something out there working for you because amen you know if you listen to things or read a few things every night again you'll find out that people who say that that they they they and the Bible would say the Bible said think it that strange to be equal with God but if you come to a place and say don't you know I'm equal with God if you ever say that in the face of so-call believer us so they will crucify you how can you be equal with God I don't know but that's what he said amen it ain't up to me to figure it out the only thing I know is that the Holy Ghost In Me Is the same one he got hallelujah hallelujah that's the only way I know to be equal with him to have him in me Hallelujah that's it not my flesh my flesh is wicked will be until it's changed but the end of man Paul said it's not I that lives but Christ that lives in me that's all I can tell you but the Bible said if you can't recognize that and say that listen what he says amen he said if you say that you are the son of God is that right hello you are a son of God but if you say that Christ is not listen let me let me get back to my scripture here third verse he said uh and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is com in the flesh is not of God so in order to prove that you are of God you got to have the Holy Ghost you got to get it and this is that Spirit of the Antichrist whereof ye have heard that should come even now already is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen Hallelujah now the nature of a lamb he goes on to say this Amen in uh Church in his condition he said but she came back speaking about the dove when when Noah put the dove out the ark and and knocked at the ark door until Noah let her in the Holy Ghost is here the Holy Ghost wants to come in that's the reason today that the Holy Spirit he hasn't gone from you forever is just sitting out there on the limbs of the tree somewhere ready to fly itself back and to come into you and give you love and peace and joy like you used to have sure it is he's ready to do it he wants to do it he's longing to do it but you won't let him let him do it now I'm not talking to you strangers I don't know what your what your pastor I'm talking to the brandom Tabernacle I ain't talking to you people from other churches I'm talking to the brandom Tabernacle that's what the matter around here that's what's make the dub take its flight just let somebody just start a little something around the church and the first thing you say oh is that so oh did you don't mean so right then the Holy Ghost goes fly away it just stands that it can't stand that kind of spirit as long as that lamb nature leaves you leaves you then the Holy Ghost is gone that's right and that's what's the matter today that's the reason the people is in the condition they are is because they let the wrong Spirit come into the heart into their life now that's the reason we got see the Bible said the reason there's so many sick and Afflicted Among Us is because of such things we must be gentle we must be peaceful we must be a lamb so that the dove can abide with us now remember the dove will come he said oh brother Bram don't tell me I'll never receive the Holy Ghost Hallelujah down at the night there's one night oh when he comes in I could just walk on sure that was what what that was him oh I felt so good I felt like I could get every little bird out of the tree and hug it and love it my wickedness Wicked person that ever done anything to me uh uh I felt like I could put my arm around them and hug them the wickedest person I'm Sor that ever done anything to me I felt like I could have put my arm around them and hugg them oh I felt sure that's what that was the Holy go is that all right now I know when God came into my life you know I was afraid to crush a roach and I don't say that's the truth I didn't know how far I could go with it but you know it just that love that overwhelmed you you began to have respect for all of God's nature and creation right now in order to be a Christian like I said it's not your work folks it's not your human effort it ain't what you you look like from the outside is what God you sees you being on the inside right now listen what he says Uh there's a place back back to the isza street meeting again is to return to the Lamb's nature again you can't expect and I want you to hear this you can't expect to be a wolf or any other scavenger and expect the dove of peace to dwell in you and a wolf is a angry and dangerous dog that's M I'm I'm defining a wolf is why untameable y'all know how them temples fly off like wow right scavenger do we know what a scavenger is that kind of a thing that eat all the nasty stuff right pigs catfish chickens right I mean that's scavengers you don't want to look at it like that but it's true that's what they are amen and we don't a lamb a dove don't have that kind of a nature y'all hear what I'm saying amen and expect the dove of peace to dwell in you he won't do it you've got to become a lamb your Nature's got to be changed and you look at at things different and you won't fuss at the preacher when he's preaching he preaches against strict oh oldfashioned Holy Ghost religion and and the way he and way and the way to live just get rid of that wolf spirit or that scavenger spirit and get a lamb's nature and you you're ready to forfeit all the things that you once done all your worldly Privileges and so forth amen that's as true as I'm standing here Christian friends humble yourself don't try to know it all see how much you can forget of what you what you do know is the best thing only know one thing that's Christ turn with me now Matthew 3 I want to finish this if that's okay I just got a little more left I try to push for forward faster but I want you to get the picture of this amen that we need to if we going to if we're going to search our heart and search our minds we must allow the inner man to come in control the tongue amen because I believe by the grace of God God has given us a good group of people here but I guarantee you almost every one of us if not every one of us need to do more better with this we want a Holiness Church we want the Holy Ghost to feel free in here we want that love like this like for whatever reason I felt the presence of God in here in such a nice way here tonight still feel it amen so so thank God for whatever we doing right amen praise the Lord Matthew 3 please if we work together brothers and sisters with the same goal God are coming this this place like like we've never seen before aim to keep the unity of the spirit amen you know whether you're on your job at home or whatever think about the church think about the spirit of God Amen keeping that Unity not bringing a breach amen upon the church amen because of our looseness help us Lord help us help us help us oh Jesus have mercy Lord Matthew 3:16 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open to him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighted upon him now think about it up until this point you never hear about the dove Lighting on a man let's put it this way Lighting on the Earth as it did in the days of Noah right here amen I got it down here and you don't have to turn but this is where and the Bible said he L up in a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased because when no Noah left that let that Dove go out finally that Dove went out and never did return that was a justification right amen even through sanctification but when it came to Jesus and I'm going to read just what brother Ram say so you understand where I'm going from that dub that went out in symbolism comes down from heaven and lights back on the Earth again showing that heaven and Earth Kiss amen showing that God has already pre-planned Hallelujah the D nature once again will live on [Applause] earth put it this way in Earth amen so Genesis 88 says also he sent the dove uh from him and to see it uh if the waters were baded from all the place of the ground uh but the dove found no rest for the soul of her foot and she returned to him in the in the ARK for the waters were on the face of the whole earth and then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in into unto him in the ark I like that I like that he just pulled but my point is this amen so brother said when that happened he said it was bodies everywhere stench and everything now the clo could go out there and eat now he he enjoyed himself but see but this Dove couldn't do that so he had to go back to the cleanest place now think about it the dove amen just didn't flew out fly in the window the Dove came directly to Noah Noah pulled it into the AR see because Noah was the righteous man there wasn't his son wasn't his wife it was Noah amen right so he pulls that dove in listen 10 first and he stayed yet other seven days amen and again he sent forth the dove out of the Ark Hallelujah come on somebody amen and the Dove came into him came into him in the evening and low in her mouth woo and the Dove came where in the evening amen and low in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so Noah knew that the waters were AB baded from off the [Applause] Earth and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him anymore so the dove has has a thing of returning every seven days but this time it didn't amen but at the end of the of the of the of the Jewish Church age yeah if it wasn't you know brother brandom basically say that Jesus was the very seal he broke God broke the seal amen and if they could have only seen what it was amen right it was it was a Breaking of a of a seal at the very end of a church age the last one and here was John in the breach just like brother Brandon was in the breach he caught those two Church ages he was a covenant Angel was brother brandom a covenant Angel he brought a covenant Hallelujah he tied up all the Loose Ends am amen oh come on somebody uh uh uh if you don't want to accept that I say the Covenant Angel was in brother brandom amen but let's move on by the grace of God now now we look at this thing and and and I want you to understand I'm almost at a close here I'm I'm going have to cut something things short but I brought forth most of the things that I want to bring right now my my whole point is this let me read just just a little bit of this so you can see amen that that God is trying to do something to the enemy he's trying to build this enemy and he's trying to get you out of the way look at your flesh as being a scavenger cuz that's just what it is your flesh is a scavenger and God is trying to build a new new nature on the inside of a scavenger come on somebody that's what he is amen coming from the Lamb of the dove he's now the dove is the most meekest bird of all the heavens a lamb is the meekest animal of all the Earth one of them is of the Earth the other's of Heaven the lamb is Earthbound he can't fly and the dove flies in the heaven one of them was Christ represents the other one represents God now you see the lamb he's an innocent substitute he must be clean he must be innocent a substitute now the dove must also be the same nature of the Lamb or they can't dwell together now that's the reason sometimes uh uh uh sometimes um that we get all mixed up is because we got one kind of a nature wanting the dove to dwell dwell on us now when that Dove came down and it lit on the lamb what if the lamb would have snorted like a wolf you know what what uh what happened that dve would would took its flight right now now you hear what I'm saying how many times we've allow we thought we came in here with the right nature the right Spirit on us the Holy Ghost come and want a light on us you feel his presence and you say not now your action say your action says not now right and immediately he flies you can feel him have you ever had that experience I have he's come down on you and because you're afraid of what other going to think you you you just the least know the least little negative thing you sense off he's so timid and he's so sensitive he moves away see that's the Dove and when you refuse him it means your nature is not lamb Hallelujah now the reason sometime we see we get all mixed up is because we got one kind of a nature wanting the dove to dwell on us now when a Dove came down and lit on on the lamb what if that lamb would have snorted like a you know what would have happened that DB would took his flight right now certainly he would he couldn't have stayed on there it must be the same type of Nature and if you want to be a Christian you've got to be a lamb and if you're going to be a lamb you got to get away from from your own thoughts and just let the Holy Spirit do the leading certainly Hallelujah ain't that good oh my you got to let him do the leading people now a dove a dove cannot by no means oh I want you to see it a dove is the only bird that I know of that doesn't have a g he can't digest just anything he has a certain diet and that Dove can't only eat a certain diet if he would go over and eat dinner with the crow or the Buzzard he die he couldn't stand it and that's the way it is with the believer all the god all of bitterness is taken out of you and you don't want no more of the things of the world you don't have to worry about a dove you ain't going to find him eating dead things C he can't his nature is different and when a man comes uh becomes a Christian his nature his Nature's different he made he's made up different and all of the old desires of the world's gone from him he becomes United with the dove of God when this Dove came from heaven the meekest bird of all all of the heavens came to the meekest animal on the earth Heaven and Earth kissed each other Heaven and Earth was United together man and God was reconciled in one body the Lord Jesus Christ certainly it was it was the god of Heaven in a form of a dove the Son of God in the form of a lamb see he repeats it he repeats it because because uh Noah had that have the the the nature of a dove in order for the dove to come right so you know here it comes again Jesus Christ and be uh the the holy spirit being the Dove and here's Jesus Christ the lamb hello that's all you got to do become a lamb submit to God and that is the way that's how you get the Holy Ghost you submit to him you become a lamb do whatever you want to do Lord here I am just unite is that all right so we look at this thing and I'm going to close now because I want you to know by the grace of God that when we come we we're not how could I say it many of us are struggling because we don't recognize the power that's in US Paul said and I'll read that scripture again Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he throws Calvary back in there you can't get away from Calvary I don't care if you get away from Calvary you lost right because without Calvary The Life of Christ could not have come back on the believer right listen now brother B talks about he said he had a blessing he had hidden power not a a rabbit's foot not a charm in his pocket but some in his soul that changed him and made him a different man talking about Paul was no rabbit foot was no charm or something like that it was the Life of Christ that changed him Hallelujah now think about it I want you to really think about this here was a man persecuting the church called Steven to may be murdered on his way to uh Damascus right right he smitten off his hearts or fall however you want to say it God blinds him right send for ananas ananas come prays for him and not only does the scale Falls from Paul's eye but he receives the Holy Ghost now I want now how can this be it just took a genuine faith God dropped in that man Faith now Paul was clean cuz he said he was amen but then God there was no effort it was he became a lamb he humbled himself to this Lord Jesus and God saw the humility and drop the Holy Ghost on him that's all God need to see in you a real humility a real humbleness of heart and mind and the Holy Ghost will come when you get ready to fully res surrender that nature that old nature surrender your rights amen strip yourself from everything you think was right amen and just humble yourself and say God I am ever I'm forever wrong in all my ways in all my thoughts and the only way I could ever be right is in you I'm surrendering everything and if I don't know what everything reveal to me what everything is because I'm re I'm re I'm I'm surrendering everything I'm casting everything away to to gain your Holy Spirit you pray like that you can't and really meaning you can't help but to get it amen amen and all you need that real quickening and God grow God will grow in you for them right he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it that's right God will do it amen he'll do it amen amen I trust you was blessed tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God 356 on the wings of
