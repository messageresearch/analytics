politics politics are polluted there is hardly an honest um among them see see its system its morals is so low it just don't have any that's all see sure his religion is cankered yes sir it's time for The Sixth Seal pretty soon to be opened and when she does oh my it's in the bride has gone forth she has done the queen has done went to take her place she has been married now to the king while this is going on and Israel Remnant is sealed and ready to go and then nature lets go he said oh what a time now we are we know there's earthquakes in diverse places is that right you see the volcanoes erupting everywhere North South E East and West everywhere watch and pray the troubles are coming the birth pains are increasing and and the Bible said Watch and Pray always so that God will count you worthy see it ain't your works it's your praying Hallelujah because you got to realize the time will come when the Gentile door is shut you can pray all you want to and you'll never get anything from Christ hallelujah hallelujah you see all animals know when danger is approaching and if you say you are the a son and daughter of God and you can't recognize the dangerous coming then something's wrong Hallelujah Matthew 26 you love the [Music] Lord Matthew 26441 and he cometh into his disciples and finded them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak so what is he saying when you pray your spirit is willing but your flesh is weak you know and I know the spirit that fights you the most when you get on your knees is sleep amen Hallelujah you're not the first and you're not the last but you've got to fight that Spirit you got to press through sleep in order to get the victory Hallelujah you know why Satan got something up the road for you and it a it is not good Jesus saw them listen let's see what the 45th verse says then he came to his disciples and said unto them are you still sleeping and resting see the time is near the son of man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners get up let's go see my betrayal is near Y what do you mean brother brother you got to understand this son of man this son of man this son of man Hallelujah has already been betrayed you said well what do you mean they know where you live they got your number they know what you believe Hallelujah is that right those 200 million demons that was loosed out of the river [Music] Euphrates brother brother brandham said they were loosed on the bride is that right the whole purpose was to attack the bride this whole political Ram is to attack the bride to kill the Royal seed but he also said they won't be able to do it Hallelujah Hall why because the rapture he will take us away before the great attack Hallelujah but the only thing is the foolish versions will get the lck hallelujah hallelujah it ain't time to be foolish do whatever you can Hallelujah you got to forsake all now you got to forsake all it's later than what we think let's turn to Mark 13 remember the one time he came to them and they were still asleep and he said sleep on that's not good danger was a lurk lurking he told him to sleep on but then when that exact time came that appoint in time you see Jesus knew exactly his his his his his purpose he knew knew when it was time to allow the enemy to capture him is that right cuz remember one time they circled him and they tried to get him then and the Bible said he walked through the crowd is that right they wanted to throw him over the mountain over the hillside Hallelujah and God would not allow them to do it why because it wasn't TI Hallelujah we said even Lord come come come Hallelujah but the time is not exactly now but we are approaching that time Hallelujah this is a time he's going to either say sleep on or get up Hallelujah I don't know about you but he told me to get up Hallelujah this is not a time to sleep hallelujah hallelujah Mark 13 [Music] 28-33 are you there yet now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when her branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves she know the summer is not near so she so ye in like manner when you see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the door go ahead I'm sorry remember even at the door even at the door verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done hallelujah Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not hey if you can't stand on nothing else you stand on that heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away hallelujah hallelujah glory to God if he promis you stand on the promise Hallelujah if he promise you you'll take a Rapture stand on it Hallelujah you don't take a Rapture because of how good you've been Hallelujah you take a Rapture because he applied the blood and the Bible says when I see the blood I will pass over you that is the only reason you take the blood you you make a Rapture the blood justifies you the blood sanctifies you and the blood fills you with his holy ghost that's it I'm Standing on the Promises of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but of that day and that hour no man know know not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son of man but the father take ye he watch and pray for ye know not when that time is hallelujah hallu you love the Lord now I'm going to drop something on you May 17 brother random said May 17th is when no went Hallelujah May 17 is when the cloud came I'm just saying I don't know what God is doing but I I don't believe that's a coincidence you understand me that cannot be a coincidence y'all understand what I'm saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I will never put a day on a day no sir but a significant thing happened Hallelujah in our day in 1963 Hallelujah glory to God even as he said as I went away I'll come again and don't get me wrong I believe in his literal coming oh absolutely but I want you to understand the world didn't see what we saw can't see it Hallelujah and the bride when God opened those seals she understood it's time to make yourself ready hallelujah it's time to make yourself ready because he's appeared and now he's coming Hallelujah is that right yeah I think he's in choosing of a bride I just to the message um might have been Easter see brother B talked about the ranous son the ranous son I mean the six seal excuse me six seal the the Rancher son coming you see he came once as he appeared but the next time he came to take her that was a mystery of the seventh seal he came and he saw her and he promised her I'm coming again this time about a year I'm coming again Hallelujah but this second time when he came Hallelujah he had already prepared the Mansion Hallelujah is that right and he says now I'm coming to get you but during that time there was a persecution went on they mocked her they sced her do you think God has chosen you to be bride Hallelujah come on Higher Ground Tabernacle I believe I'm a barefooted nobody Hallelujah but God chose you and God chose me and I'll stand on his promise Hallelujah they can laugh all they want no we don't have no fancy CL we don't have all that stuff but one we have is a promise from the Rancher son hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is that right oh we know this is the time Hallelujah we know this is the time Hallelujah is that right six seal again 259 my sheep hear my voice when these things are supposed to be taking place in the last days sheep of God recognize that Hallelujah is that right yes sir see they recognize it my sheep know me see strangers they won't follow don't follow them strangers it's got to be a Vindicated sign of the day and they see it now now notice what are you saying we follow the message of William Brandon because we've heard his voice not the man's voice but the voice of God in the man Hallelujah my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow Hallelujah you love the Lord watch and pray this is a time to watch and pray because everything is pointing to the end Hallelujah is that right brother bam said I think it's the third chapter that's when the bride leaves Hallelujah so when the six seal is really open in its fullness we'll be gone than Lord let me read this again now concerning that that day or hour no one knows either the angel neither the angels in Heaven nor the Sun but only the father watch be alert that's the word I want be alert for you don't know when the time is coming you got to be alert you got to watch you got to pray Hallelujah yes sir you look and see how the world has Hallelujah something I saw today we know of the Roman Empire and you know how they control a thousand years and that same spirit is moving today to control the world again y'all hear what I'm saying she's working her her same system going to take your money away put you on that digital stuff y'all better hear what I'm saying it's working right now like a serpent it has slithered through time and many of us have been blind to what they're doing Hallelujah I'm telling you something now but when they did this thing with Co Hallelujah they learned how well they can control you they also developed they knew how to make you fight one another did not if you didn't wear a mask people wanted to fight you if you didn't have your shot people wanted to fight you and now we find out the shot was no good amen amen that's true it kill more people than help them but they learn give a man a dollar he'll humble himself how many of y'all was happy for them what call the C what the packages stimulus stimulus it stimulated you didn't don't you get me wrong it it stimulated me too but they saw what they could do and we fell right into it now they're getting ready to take it further it it's not something to be afraid of Hallelujah because God keeps us he's the one that protects Us Hal oh come on somebody amen if God can step in the fire with the Hebrew boys he can step in our fire Hallelujah now you must remember that God calls individuals and not a nation of genti Hallelujah so you can't say well uh how can I say without being offensive I'll just say it like this God don't call Gentiles by a group he calls us individually because every body come to this church doesn't mean they're bride I hope and trust we are y understand me I'd love to see every one of us over there Hallelujah but only God knows Hallelujah huj listen what the prophet said paragraph 116 coming from the six seal he said Remember the deals with Israel as a nation always is the nation of Israel now remember I'm saying this now when it came to Jacob's trouble when Jacob had to meet Esau the first thing Jacob wanted to do with Esau is make a monetary Covenant Hallelujah make a monetary Covenant and and and of course Esau says it's not necessary Hallelujah but look at them they fighting today hallelujah hallelujah and so with the Jews because they are under that inspiration they're going to make a covenant with Esau Rome but Rome is going to break the Covenant Hallelujah you got to understand because if they're going to move into the digital aspect of it they're not going to need dollars Hallelujah and Wall Street Jews they got all the dollars I might get in trouble but the truth of the matter is you need to know what that was happening now over there in Israel is gathering the real Jews back to their home land Hallelujah it is war and persecution that brought the Jews from under Hitler Stalin and melini and brought them back to Israel Hallelujah it will be the persecution that will bring the Bride of Jesus Christ together Hallelujah and it's persecution right now that's strengthening the Jew it's not designed to weaken them it is designed to strengthen them Hallelujah right I heard Netanyahu say we don't have to depend on America Hallelujah we are going to depend on God hallelujah you see and that's the Christian that's why we're made in the same likeness we're not depending on nobody but Jesus Christ Hallelujah remember what your lord said he said conceal the lies of the family he said I clothe them hallelujah what about The Sparrows I feed them Hallelujah and he said likewise you are my children take no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow is evil of itself Hallelujah we don't have to worry about tomorrow because we've got Jesus Christ today and if you got him today you'll have him tomorrow Hallelujah the Gentiles excuse me as individuals excuse me people taken from the Gentiles and it had to the Gentiles had to make make up all the people of the world so now then there's a Jew there Jews come into that but let me pause for a moment so that you can understand our country can only what do what the scriptures have already said they were going to do the B said all the Gentile Nations will be against Israel Hallelujah and that includes America hallelujah hallelujah but the prophet of God also said one of the worst things we could do could have done was join alliance with the uh uh uh uh Palestinian Iraqis or how he the Muslim let's say it like that that's one of the worst things we could have done hallelujah so what am I saying judgment is right at the door whether you like it or not you love the Lord let me move on just like Arabians and and arish Irish and Indians and what more is all the people of the world make up bouquet bouquet BR see but now when it comes to dealing with the then dealing then with Israel in this last part of the 70th week it deals with them as a nation the Gentiles are finished the hour is soon arriving and maybe yet this this is very nice that God would completely turn from the Gentiles all together exactly he said so they shall tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished the times are over yes sir and then let then let him that is filthy stay filthy let him that is righteous be righteous see that's where we are when God is calling and trying to woo us see he's a just God it's always warning before judgment Hallelujah you love the Lord and yes during the seal when that Sixth Seal when it unfolds in the way that it should when the Bride of Jesus Christ is gone there is no blood on the mercy seat right now we're covered by the blood God that blood protects us from the Judgment of God hallelujah hallelujah see we don't want to wait you miss the Rapture there is no blood to protect you you got to suffer and if I got it right the prophet of God said what Hitler did to the Jews will be like a picnic compared to what the people left behind will suffer now I just paraphrase that there is no more blood on the seat in the sanctuary at all there's no more blood on the on the altar the sacrifice has been removed and there's nothing but smoke and lightning and judgment in there and that's just exactly was poured out here tonight see the lamb has done left his mediatory work the mediatory work has been finished from over on the throne the Safa is we've typed him perfectly the kingsom Redeemer the bloody lamb that come a lamb that has been slain a bloody one been killed K bruised come forth and took the book out of his hand that's the day day that's the days are finished now he is coming to claim what he has redeemed amen that just sends something through me Hallelujah we find out now John said I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and there was a great earthquake in all nature God has been doing great things yes then all nature was interrupted yes thank you brother God has been doing great things like Healing The Sick opening the eyes of the Blind and doing great works but we find out here that nature took a tumble yes all nature look look what nature plays look what taking place excuse me the earthquake the sun went black the moon wouldn't give his light and the Stars Shook and fell and why everything happen see right at the time of the opening of the six seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcing of those martyr seat the martyrs has been finished now you see we're right into the hour now we could be at any time see because the church is just about ready to take his flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here hallelujah just remember the bride is gone she don't have to go through any of it this is a time of tribulation of purification of the church it it's it's put upon her for her to go through it not the bride he takes his sweetheart out of the way yes sir she's done redeemed her it's kind of that his own selection his own choice like any man takes his bride see the earthquake hallelujah what am I trying to get us to see stay alert all you can do is the best you can do and brother Adam said God will do the rest Hallelujah now I'm I'm going skip some of this by the grace of God when we see what God is going to do it ought to make us tremble it's hard times now laws don't protect the Christian anymore but if you're pervert you can get all the laws back in you Hallelujah you think I'm wrong by saying that you can go kill a pervert out there and they put you under the under the prison house but here Israel protecting their Homeland and they want to kill her what kind of stuff is that Hallelujah see the world loveth its own and if you don't see what they doing to the Jews you you're blind cuz they're coming after you next you got to be ready don't get scared because I got to preach what he want me to preach Revelation 2 2223 you know we've been so quiet about things you go to the restaurant and you start talking about the Beast and and the mark of the beast and you somebody walk in you say did you hear that you quiet quiet down why cry loud spare not look what it says in revelation 22 behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adul with her into the Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and you know they're not going to repent because God said he gave her space to repent and she would not and I would kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the RS of the heart you hear what I'm saying he said they'll know I know what's in your heart and I will give un to every one of you according to your Works Hallelujah is that right I want to say people say well how come the Jews is the way they are they can't help that's their anointing i49 2 42 they got Jacob's anointing Hallelujah and that's the reason men act that way because that Spirit that's predicted for that age to be on them they can't do nothing else Hallelujah y'all understand me I'm not going to be too much longer but I want you to understand people don't understand the Jew was a Shyer and he will remain a sha until he get filled with the Holy Ghost he's got that Jacob anointing that's the spirit that is Forever on this you even to this day but because we are Christian we know in spite of their condition they were blinded that we might come in you understand me thank God for his grace thank God for the purpose of God they were blinded for us and we're know better Hallelujah matter of fact the Jews they are considered the sons of God hallelujah as Israel was the son so amen so are their sons Hallelujah yes sir he will do anything y'all know that's how they get wealthy because they do anything to get they love that money and people get jealous of them because they're very skilled at it Hallelujah but God made him that way Hallelujah huj now the the truth of the matter is we can't act like this is the first time they've been persecuted they were persecuted throughout all history Hallelujah but the great this persecution has come upon them because they failed to see their Messiah and When They Crucified him they said let his blood be on us and our children and they have been suffering every sin no matter where they go Hallelujah they they they sought out because of what they said they are still suffering Hallelujah but they're coming a day hallelujah amen even under that six year they come in a day when the Jews were wake up to the Messiah Hallelujah and the Bible says in one day one day they will be filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah see they already Sanctified glory to God and God is going to fill them hallelujah hallelujah yes sir that's why the Bible said there we they will do exploits they run through the troops y'all hear what I'm saying said that scripture refers to the Jew Hallelujah they won't be able to contain them and then when they die it's because God gave them Grace to do it to do what fulfill the scriptures Hallelujah but won't they be surprised when they see see them same Jews come back for the [Music] Millennium Hallelujah that's what he said in the six he said there'll be there at the Millennium so it be a little short quick work up and down Hallelujah is that right now I'm going to uh pair pH a few more I'm going to say a few more let's just think about Egypt and Moses and remember everyone who did not obey Moses the words of Moses they perished because they failed to see it wasn't Moses it was God veiled in Moses God and God told Moses you will become God to pH did it happen it happened Hallelujah but in all exoduses you have a mixed multitude I was thinking about this the other day when I was studying I said don't you know Joshua and Caleb out of millions were the only ones of that generation that received the Holy Ghost is that right now that new generation that was circumcised again they crossed over into Canaan Canan represented the Holy Ghost say Canan was not a represent represented heaven because there's no no fighting and no suffering in heaven but they were in the in the in the land of the Holy Ghost and in the land of the Holy Ghost it was Battle after battle after battle after battle and as long as they kept seeing out of the camp they were victorious over the enemy hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and even when they made mistakes God gave them space to repent and they did repent y'all hear what I'm saying but think about this two out of all those people it makes you wonder how many people who followed William brandom actually had it if you listen to the T you you you read between the line there was a lot of people Church go us there was a lot of people who believe he was a prophet but they had a hard time believing that the Holy Ghost was not speaking in tongu they had a hard time believing that they had to go further than that Hallelujah they had a hard time Hallelujah believing that women weren't supposed to preach you hear what I'm saying but yet they had the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah they has something but the Holy Ghost never denies his word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah never Hallelujah glory to God in that time Pharaoh was killing the babies trying to stop the Royal seed that's what this all about you know hallelujah hallelujah they were trying to stop the Israelites from multiplying and becoming greater in number is that what not what they doing now Hallelujah are you talking about what you talking about brother you got realized this message have been infiltrated Hallelujah it is a known fact that there were Catholic priests who were Pastors in a foreign country then when they all start leaving the message these these priests went back to the Catholic church what do you think they went back with they know everything except the Holy Ghost that's the that's the danger of having an intellectual message Hallelujah there nothing wrong with having an in but we need the power of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah amen I'm not interested I'm not interested in in all the healing those things are great I won't change more than anywhere else give me change hallelujah hallelujah I done seen Miracles I've seen signs I've seen wonders I've seen people speak in tongues and shout and dance but this message came to change us from glory to Glory Hallelujah little by little step by step virtue by virtue into the statue of a perfect man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not time to be Side Track Hallelujah keep your eyes on Jesus because when the Storm come if you look around like Peter you going to S Egypt would plague with all kind of plagues and the world is being plagued with all kinds of plages Hallelujah and all these plagues were announcing they're coming an exodus all these plagues were announcing and pointing to the end of Egypt all these plagues are pointing to the end of this world Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah the fall of Egypt was rise of the church being led by a prophet and the pill of fire or should I say the pill of fire and the prophet however you want to say it the safety zone was given to him to give to the people and that safety zone consisted of the blood put the blood on the doorpost and the L Hallelujah but you see that wasn't all they had to be tried with that was just justification God sent them in the wilderness to be Sanctified Hallelujah is that right and you'll find out in in the wilderness those may have been Sanctified lost their sanctification because of the teachings of Dayan and Kora Hallelujah and that's the truth oh you're the message you're the bride you know you you all right Grace is with you yes Grace is with you but God expect you to respect his word we're not just hearers of the word but we must be doers of the word even if James have said I'm sorry don't mean to go too fast so fast brother I'm just a little excited Millions died in the wilderness Joshua and Caleb made over to the promised the promised land represented as I said was a representative of heaven but it was on the Holy Ghost Hallelujah is that right Deuteronomy 8 1-4 and I guess I close on this scripture here well I have one more Deuteronomy 1-4 and the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father and thou sh remember all the ways which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years years in the wilderness why did he do that to Humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his Commandments or no all these test all these trials are there to prove what's in your heart see whether you going to keep his Commandments and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he may make thee know that man does not live by bread only but but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord do man live he goes on to say that th th th thy rment waxs not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years huh all those blessings and yet they were lost because they failed to keep his word this is our opportunity God always give us space to repent Hallelujah it ain't all over first Peter 4- 4 12 17 I trust you being blessed I you know what I I say I say this thing if the message is delivered in the wrong way it will cause you to become a twofold child of hell if the message is delivered to you in the wrong way it will cause you to be a two-fold child of hell it will cause you to be a hypocrite yall understand me like for example you're Justified as though you've never SE in the first place you can't you know people think that I can almost do whatever I want to I'm Justified I've never seen it I can drink I can smoke I can lie I can do all these things I know the message I believe brother BR you understand me but that's the wrong attitude that shows you don't have the Holy Ghost huh it shows you don't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because when you get the Hol all you want to do is please him Hallelujah it doesn't make you it don't mean you won't make mistakes but all you want to do is please him even if means your life you want to please him Hallelujah first Peter 4 12- 17 belov think think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happen unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceedingly Joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are you yeah oh girl you're like oh holy roller with that that long uh dress you got on and you don't wear your makeup and all that stuff reproach for Christ you ought to be happy about it that God selected you to suffer persecution hallelujah hallelujah oh why me Lord why not you for the spirit of of the glory of God Rest us upon you you hear that let me read that again happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you on their part he he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified what do you think the real Christian is doing seeing what they're doing to Israel it's sparking them up it's really lighting because they know we serve the same God but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as some evildoer or as some B busy body in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf Hallelujah for the time has come that the Judgment must begin at the house of God and if if first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God hallelujah oh it's going to be wonderful things don't miss it don't miss it by the grace of God do all you can do and that and that'll be up to God to take care of the rest of them huh do all you can do you keep praying hallelujah hallelujah cuz you got a battle on your hand absolutely you think this flesh going to let you have a good time this flesh don't like Holiness Hallelujah this flesh love pleasure this flesh loves sin y'all better hear what I'm saying your greatest enemy is you but Paul said I di daily Hallelujah you got to Die daily and you got to pray daily that God would count you worthy to escape all of the trials test and stuff that's coming upon the Earth wake up stay alert Hallelujah CU everything we're looking at it's pointing to the end and before the complete end

because I learned that when God does something good you you have to give him the praise amen um so I'm currently in school for like an Accel accelerated program so like that program like I go at my own pace but then the school has a policy that you cannot drop a class twice if you drop a class twice then um like you you pretty much will be out of the school you cannot register for that class anymore so there was this one class that was very important and I procrastinated and then and then I didn't take it too seriously so that they dropped it the first time because like polic where if you don't submit an assment after C am amount of days they CL they Dr the CL first time I still had one more chance you got class got to get dropped maximum isce the and then we went to the wedding in m and then I got so busy I didn't get the time to submit my assment and they dropped my class again I felt like I already knew that I couldn't register for that class ieda so that really discouraged me
