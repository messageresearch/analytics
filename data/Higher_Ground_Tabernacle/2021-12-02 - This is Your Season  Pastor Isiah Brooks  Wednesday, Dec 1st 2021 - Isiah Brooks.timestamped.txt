[18:10] [Music]
[18:17] oh
[18:30] hallelujah
[18:34] you love the lord
[18:36] i thank god for calvary
[18:38] let's stand on the word
[18:42] our brother brandy verton wrote that
[18:44] song
[18:46] yeah yeah i appreciate
[18:49] the words
[18:52] to that song because it means so much
[19:02] god is so good to us and i trust
[19:04] that the word of the lord will be a
[19:06] blessing to you tonight
[19:09] my subject is
[19:10] this is your season
[19:12] and i know you're probably wondering
[19:14] where i'm going to come from on this but
[19:15] i'm dealing with grace
[19:18] and the expression of christ in you
[19:21] so let us
[19:22] as we stand let us turn to saint john
[19:26] we're going to come from the sixth
[19:27] chapter of saint john
[19:33] the reason why we
[19:35] most of us struggle is because we have a
[19:39] revelation
[19:40] sometimes of what grace is
[19:43] sometimes it's right and sometimes it's
[19:45] wrong but
[19:46] i i understand that a lot of times when
[19:49] it comes to being a christian
[19:51] we come short we come short especially
[19:53] of our joy
[19:54] because we forget what calvary was all
[19:56] about
[19:58] and we must understand that there is
[20:00] nothing that you can do in yourself
[20:03] god didn't need no help to save you
[20:06] he saved you because he wanted to amen
[20:09] and uh you must understand that that uh
[20:12] god so loved the world he went out of
[20:14] his way to save us amen and uh it's not
[20:17] like he's going to save us today and
[20:19] lose us tomorrow
[20:21] but i trust that somehow through the
[20:23] message you'll be a blessed tonight
[20:26] beginning at the 28th verse of the sixth
[20:28] chapter
[20:33] beginning at the 28th verse
[20:36] then say they unto him
[20:38] what shall we do
[20:41] that we might work
[20:42] the works of god
[20:45] and jesus answered and said unto them
[20:49] this is the work of god
[20:51] that you believe on him
[20:54] whom he
[20:56] sent amen and understand that believing
[20:59] is an action word yes
[21:02] because once you hear and you believe
[21:04] you act upon
[21:05] what you believe or heard
[21:09] one more scripture coming from romans
[21:10] the fourth
[21:14] chapter you love the lord amen amen glad
[21:18] to see everybody here today
[21:21] see god doing his
[21:23] whatever he's doing i know he's he's
[21:25] working on me
[21:28] and i'm so glad to be a part of that
[21:30] by god's grace
[21:33] romans the fourth chapter
[21:36] beginning at the first verse
[21:39] what shall we say then that abraham our
[21:42] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[21:45] found
[21:46] for if abraham was justified by works
[21:49] he hath were up to glory
[21:52] but not before god
[21:55] for what saith the scripture abraham
[21:57] believed god and it was counted unto him
[21:59] for righteousness
[22:01] now to him that worketh is the reward
[22:03] not reckoned of grace
[22:06] but of death did y'all hear that yes sir
[22:10] but to him that worketh not but
[22:12] believeth on him that justify at the
[22:14] ungodly his faith is counted for
[22:17] righteousness
[22:19] even as david also described the
[22:21] blessedness of man
[22:23] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[22:26] without what works
[22:28] saying blessed are they whose iniquity
[22:31] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[22:34] blessed is the man
[22:36] to whom the lord will not impute sin
[22:40] love the lord
[22:41] let us pray
[22:42] father god we thank you for your grace
[22:44] we thank you for your mercy
[22:46] we thank you for being so good to us
[22:49] giving us grace
[22:50] today
[22:52] we thank you for your mercy that
[22:53] endureth
[22:54] to all generations
[22:56] and lord we pray tonight that you bless
[22:58] the service in a special way
[23:00] we give you honor
[23:02] and glory in jesus christ's name we pray
[23:05] amen you may be seated
[23:11] this is your season
[23:14] and the reason why i entitled it because
[23:16] the pentecostal age is pretty much over
[23:19] god is calling a people out of that age
[23:22] to bring into what we call the eternal
[23:25] age
[23:26] where the bride of jesus christ dwell
[23:28] amen
[23:30] and you know i think about
[23:33] things
[23:34] the word of god how the word of god is
[23:36] so
[23:37] true and pure of itself
[23:40] uh
[23:41] when we look at the word we come to see
[23:43] that the word is
[23:46] how can i say dimensional if i can say
[23:48] it like that
[23:49] because the word is so eternal eternal
[23:52] that it no matter what age it is spoken
[23:56] it still lives it's active it's like he
[23:59] spoke it today it was
[24:01] at every age it's been that way because
[24:04] the bible says that jesus christ is the
[24:06] same yesterday today and forever
[24:08] he's a god that changes not
[24:11] and you and i must understand that in
[24:13] order to enjoy this salvation you need a
[24:16] true revelation amen of what grace is
[24:19] amen that's true
[24:22] you know i've noticed sometimes that
[24:24] though we live life by our own choices
[24:28] we are kept by god's plan of
[24:32] predestination amen
[24:34] god that's what keeps us safe
[24:36] is what god has set in his mind
[24:40] for you to do
[24:41] now i'm going to tell you like this
[24:43] the works of god is to believe on him
[24:45] that uh that god whom god has sent
[24:48] but there are two kinds of works there's
[24:50] a work that you do and there's a work
[24:52] that god does amen
[24:54] and paul was talking about the faith or
[24:56] the work that comes by the faith in god
[25:00] and that faith is what god thinks of you
[25:03] and james talked about works uh faith
[25:06] without works is dead
[25:08] now he's looking at what people think of
[25:11] you
[25:11] because if you are a christian they
[25:14] expect to see works from you
[25:17] but you see most of the time the works
[25:19] that god does for us
[25:21] we don't even see it
[25:23] amen
[25:24] god is using us in ways that we will
[25:27] never see until we get over there
[25:30] remember the power of the lord when i
[25:31] did i feed you when were you hungry and
[25:34] i fed you when were you naked that i
[25:35] clothed you when were you thirsty i gave
[25:37] you drink these people
[25:40] were doing the work of god
[25:42] didn't even know it
[25:45] because they didn't know at what point
[25:47] in time the work in which they did was
[25:50] that work in which god predestinated
[25:52] them to
[25:54] understand that the work that god gives
[25:56] us is something that will always come
[25:58] out right amen
[26:00] we use the word manipulate but sometimes
[26:03] god will move you in a way to produce
[26:06] what he wants
[26:08] for the purpose of what he he sent you
[26:10] for amen
[26:12] and
[26:13] listen when it comes to that
[26:16] that kind of a work that kind of a faith
[26:18] is not in your hands
[26:20] it's in god's hands
[26:22] and god determines all of that
[26:25] like for example somebody who might want
[26:28] to sing and it says oh i want to sing
[26:30] i've got to sing and they have no
[26:32] singing voice
[26:34] well no matter how they try to sing it
[26:38] is not what god purposed them to do you
[26:41] understand what i'm trying to say
[26:43] everybody have we have a purpose and
[26:46] there's a god purpose
[26:48] and then there's a grace of god and you
[26:50] understand that grace and faith and love
[26:52] all work together
[26:54] you can't have faith without love and
[26:56] you can't have love without faith
[26:58] is that right
[26:59] so you got to understand by god's grace
[27:02] amen there is also a work that god uses
[27:05] with the elect
[27:06] the elect only
[27:09] everybody can't do what the elect does
[27:11] and each each elected individual has a
[27:14] work that god has set forth in his mind
[27:18] for them to do
[27:19] oftentimes they don't even know what
[27:21] that is
[27:22] the work of god for example is that
[27:25] little woman who was in church
[27:28] and she walked up with her little mics
[27:30] those two mics and put it in the
[27:32] offering plan that was the work of god
[27:36] and that work of god is now on the
[27:38] record of heaven amen you hear what i'm
[27:41] saying it was already in the mind of god
[27:44] and then it took us a prophet to tell us
[27:46] that reason why there was she was so
[27:48] inspired to do that because god was
[27:50] granting her eternal life
[27:53] hallelujah now you think about uh uh in
[27:57] the bible when you had anna and simeon
[28:00] and and they're they're in the temple
[28:02] all day now think about this it's been
[28:05] hundreds of years
[28:07] and there was no messiah
[28:09] but somehow in the inspiration in their
[28:12] prayer life they were inspired to remain
[28:15] in the temple amen and pray to jesus
[28:18] come amen hallelujah now they didn't
[28:21] know what they were doing but they had
[28:22] the inspiration and god moved them into
[28:26] that place
[28:28] there were other prophets no doubt
[28:30] other than anna and simeon but they were
[28:32] the elected ones in which god wanted to
[28:35] place in the book
[28:37] so you and i must understand there are
[28:39] things that we are doing
[28:41] we don't even know it is ordained of god
[28:44] amen but it is
[28:46] that's why when we get over there we're
[28:49] going to see what all we did
[28:51] for the kingdom of god
[28:53] oh it's true
[28:56] it's true
[28:59] think about it that's god's thoughts
[29:02] concerning
[29:03] you
[29:04] now of course when when when uh uh ruth
[29:08] and naomi and her husband and all them
[29:11] went down to uh
[29:13] moab they had no idea they were in the
[29:15] will of god
[29:17] because to everybody else they were
[29:18] backslidden
[29:20] hallelujah but god knew exactly what he
[29:24] was doing
[29:25] he knew that the only way that he could
[29:27] get ruth out of there he had to send
[29:30] someone in that's the way you do it
[29:33] especially on the warfare
[29:35] you sit in your spies your spies bring
[29:37] out what you want them to bring and
[29:39] that's exactly what god did
[29:42] you and i must understand that that that
[29:44] when we come to uh works
[29:48] like i said there's a work of god
[29:50] and remember jesus christ even says i
[29:52] come to do the work of god
[29:54] and he never strayed one moment
[29:57] because he didn't have a will of his own
[30:00] per se
[30:01] because he surrendered every thought he
[30:03] had to the word of god amen he never
[30:06] missed a beat he's not like you and i
[30:10] because of our own will
[30:12] we sometimes miss a few beats
[30:16] sometimes we think
[30:17] uh that the works of god is is uh
[30:20] feeding the poor and uh you know giving
[30:23] arms and all kinds of those things that
[30:26] and mind you you got to be careful in
[30:28] even when you do that
[30:30] because if there is just an ounce
[30:33] of
[30:34] self-gratification you've missed it amen
[30:38] because this is not about you and it's
[30:40] not about me
[30:41] it is about him
[30:43] you love the lord
[30:46] now you and i must understand there's a
[30:47] plan a redemption see and in this plan
[30:51] amen is to make uh whatever god has
[30:54] thought about you come to a complete end
[30:58] yeah you can't miss it
[31:00] that's why people
[31:01] they don't understand
[31:03] the word of god is true if a man
[31:05] confessed with his mouth believe in his
[31:08] heart
[31:09] that jesus christ is his savior amen he
[31:12] is saved
[31:13] amen
[31:14] well it doesn't matter where he's at
[31:17] brother was in a baptist church
[31:19] you understand me god began to move him
[31:22] out of there and then he went into the
[31:24] pentecostal realm and then from there
[31:26] into the word but you see once that seed
[31:29] has been quickened
[31:30] once god has gotten your attention
[31:33] you he can never take it back
[31:36] see and god knows those that are been
[31:39] elected to do
[31:40] what he wants them to do
[31:43] so you see
[31:47] when we talk about
[31:49] works
[31:50] human human works remember i read to you
[31:55] the work that god requires of us is to
[31:58] do
[31:59] to believe on him
[32:00] that one that god sent
[32:03] all that believed in moses it's true
[32:05] once they it when they those who
[32:07] continue to believe now
[32:09] you got to continue you can't you can't
[32:11] not believe today and believe tomorrow
[32:13] it's continue
[32:15] whom god has sent and the one he's
[32:17] speaking of here is himself
[32:20] jesus christ says believe on him whom
[32:23] god have sent
[32:25] is that right because salvation can come
[32:28] by no other than the lord jesus christ
[32:32] and understand jesus christ is a more
[32:34] faith he changes his mass
[32:37] so whom god sends is whom we must
[32:40] believe in it doesn't stop there
[32:45] and the thing is as i thought i said you
[32:46] know a lot of times i've been there
[32:49] sometimes we sit still and we think to
[32:50] ourselves oh god if i you know i haven't
[32:53] done nothing for you but who says god
[32:55] wants you to do something
[32:58] amen y'all understand me
[33:00] god had a man 30 years blind
[33:04] a religious man
[33:07] did nothing but beg
[33:10] did arms right
[33:12] but he never knew
[33:14] that when he saw jesus
[33:17] and jesus healed him
[33:19] that that was in the mind of god
[33:22] and that was his purpose
[33:24] amen
[33:25] hallelujah because they asked him who
[33:27] did sin
[33:29] and and jesus said nobody
[33:32] but all of this was done
[33:34] for the glory of god
[33:37] y'all understand me
[33:39] so our works that god has ordained for
[33:41] us to do will never come back to him
[33:45] void amen no matter what you go through
[33:48] it will never come back to him void
[33:52] you will accomplish everything that god
[33:54] has in his mind for you to come
[33:57] accomplish and matter of fact you can't
[33:59] even die until then
[34:06] you love the lord
[34:08] you know most people believe that the
[34:10] works that we are judged for is the way
[34:12] we live our daily lives that is our
[34:15] actions and our thoughts and our speech
[34:18] and other beliefs that works are only
[34:21] uh our conscious effort to speed or
[34:24] spread the gospel and to do good for
[34:26] mankind now all of those things that we
[34:29] just read there is is all about you
[34:33] but god doesn't judge you that way
[34:36] and we didn't know that
[34:38] but the bride of jesus christ has
[34:40] nothing against her
[34:43] you have been so justified
[34:45] amen and the pro listen that's the
[34:47] message that's the word
[34:50] the bride of jesus christ has nothing
[34:52] against her
[34:55] see we talk about dwelling in her his
[34:57] presence but oftentimes we look at the
[34:59] word we look at our works
[35:01] our works versus god's works
[35:04] see what i'm saying but what god has
[35:06] determined for us none of your words can
[35:08] hinder it that's right
[35:10] amen what
[35:12] yes
[35:13] it was god's
[35:14] purpose to give peter the keys
[35:18] and peter denied the lord three times
[35:22] what he did was his own works
[35:25] though they were bad
[35:26] but those bad works could not hinder him
[35:29] from getting the keys because in the
[35:32] mind of god peter was to be the
[35:34] sportsman on the day of pentecost
[35:37] see what i'm trying to say
[35:39] we we we fail to see and we because we
[35:42] take our consciousness you know we judge
[35:44] ourselves in so many ways
[35:47] so many ways that we even doubt whether
[35:49] we save sometime because we're not doing
[35:51] what we feel like god wants us to do
[35:54] remember your feelings can get you in
[35:57] trouble
[35:59] amen
[36:00] hallelujah you've got to be led by the
[36:02] spirit they that are led by the spirit
[36:05] of god they are the sons of god amen
[36:09] hallelujah listen brother banham talks
[36:12] about faith works and work is dead
[36:15] in 1950 he says now look like paul was
[36:18] speaking in romans the fourth chapter
[36:20] justifying abraham by faith
[36:23] and james is justifying him by works but
[36:26] it does not contradict
[36:29] paul was speaking with what god saw in
[36:31] abraham and james was speaking of what
[36:34] man saw in abraham
[36:37] you understand me god you're right paul
[36:40] was speaking of what god saw in abraham
[36:43] and james was speaking uh what man saw
[36:46] in abraham right
[36:48] because what god saw god saw abraham
[36:52] staggered not at the promises of god
[36:55] but if we read the bible in our own way
[36:58] looking at his works we would say he's
[37:00] staggered
[37:03] but whose report will you believe
[37:08] amen so you and i must come to a place
[37:11] amen as we said
[37:13] uh uh
[37:14] god
[37:16] then james speaking
[37:18] was speaking of what man saw
[37:21] in genesis 22 where abraham offered up
[37:24] isaac
[37:25] you see so faith what faith you have
[37:29] that's what god sees and what your what
[37:32] your works is is what your neighbors see
[37:37] see because somebody said oh that cannot
[37:39] be a christian
[37:40] i saw them do this and i saw them knew
[37:43] that
[37:44] who's the judge of it
[37:46] amen
[37:47] who's going to relay any charge to god's
[37:49] elect y'all understand what i'm saying
[37:51] it is god's judgment that determines
[37:54] who's a christian and who's not
[37:56] regardless to whether you work or
[37:58] whether you don't
[38:01] our working amen is
[38:03] there for rewards
[38:05] lay up your treasures in heaven
[38:07] there is your rewards
[38:09] but understand amen whether you do
[38:11] anything or not once you're saved truly
[38:14] saved
[38:15] god has saved you he's he's allowed you
[38:18] to come in
[38:19] there's no way of turning you out
[38:22] thank you lord right
[38:24] now so you'll understand by god's grace
[38:30] ah
[38:32] your faith in itself
[38:34] in god
[38:36] points to your predestination
[38:40] see because the bride of jesus christ
[38:42] will always believe the word amen and if
[38:45] you have a true believer it's it's it is
[38:49] your faith that keeps you going to you
[38:52] reach your destination see and that's
[38:54] what we don't understand we think faith
[38:57] is something else but faith is that
[38:58] determination i've made a lot of
[39:00] mistakes i've made a lot of faults i've
[39:02] had a lot of thoughts i've had a lot of
[39:04] failures but watch this
[39:06] there ain't no turning around
[39:09] because what i know is true and i
[39:12] believe that he that begun the good work
[39:15] in me is faithful to completed i believe
[39:19] it
[39:20] it ain't me i'm not doing the work he's
[39:22] doing the work see it's like this when
[39:25] they took in the old testament that
[39:27] little lamb
[39:28] and and you had to put your hand on that
[39:30] lamb for sacrifice
[39:33] that means you could go away free
[39:36] all you had to do is believe that that
[39:37] lamb was taking on your
[39:40] punishment that's it o lamb of god amen
[39:44] he became our sin that we might become
[39:47] his righteousness amen hallelujah how
[39:50] did abraham receive righteousness which
[39:52] abraham is a type of us abraham received
[39:55] righteousness because he believed god
[39:58] amen and it was imputed unto him for
[40:02] righteousness hallelujah now let's bring
[40:05] it to our day because the same god that
[40:07] was in abraham was in william branham
[40:09] and because we believe him
[40:12] you understand me it wasn't the
[40:14] prophet's word it was god who was in the
[40:16] prophet's word
[40:18] y'all got quiet on that one
[40:20] but it's true anyhow
[40:23] it's true
[40:24] it is the word of god
[40:26] and because of what we're believing
[40:29] listen it is the prophet that hews the
[40:32] people out
[40:33] it is this message that bring the people
[40:35] out of the organization
[40:37] is that right
[40:38] elijah stood there on mount carmel and
[40:41] says amen let's go have a show down here
[40:43] y'all understand me
[40:45] all who worship god stand on my side and
[40:48] all that worship bear stand over that
[40:50] side right
[40:51] what was he doing hewing them out
[40:53] bringing them out separating the
[40:55] believers from the unbelievers
[40:57] and those who followed uh followed
[40:59] elijah eli
[41:01] elijah amen stood with god and those who
[41:05] followed baal stood with denomination
[41:07] and organization
[41:09] so you coming out of the system proves
[41:12] whose side you're on amen
[41:16] hey
[41:17] we sweat
[41:18] and i have to oh lord you know because
[41:23] how can i say it like this
[41:24] i'm gonna throw this at you
[41:27] sometimes god deliver us
[41:29] and we don't even believe it really know
[41:31] it that he did you're supposed to have
[41:33] faith to believe that he
[41:35] right that's right
[41:36] how many times you've gotten healed
[41:40] and the symptoms lingered
[41:43] you understand me
[41:45] and eventually because you believe the
[41:47] symptoms disappear
[41:51] is that right that's how it is with
[41:53] salvation
[41:55] that's how it is with healing you must
[41:57] understand this body is sick
[42:00] it's sick in the natural it's seeking
[42:02] the spirit y'all understand
[42:04] and it takes work i believe i'm perfect
[42:08] and it takes the word of god time
[42:11] to bring that perfection through your
[42:14] body
[42:15] as he would
[42:17] any kind of sickness because sin is a
[42:20] sickness it's spiritual unbelief it's a
[42:23] sickness
[42:25] and faith will move
[42:27] keep moving until everything that you
[42:31] come short in is out of your mind out of
[42:34] your body
[42:36] amen that's the word
[42:38] amen it heals
[42:41] let me say it like this how many of us
[42:43] have been changed
[42:46] and don't even know when it happened
[42:48] amen
[42:50] huh it happens sometimes you've had
[42:53] headaches lord heal my head you're gonna
[42:55] don't even know when the headache
[42:57] disappeared
[42:58] amen
[42:59] but it was the word spoken
[43:02] and understand everything has a time
[43:04] period to it god can do a miracle on you
[43:08] but usually when it comes to healing and
[43:10] this message medicine that we're talking
[43:12] about is the bomb of gilead
[43:14] right it will heal us and right now the
[43:17] word of this hour which is the healing
[43:20] of god it is the perfection of god and
[43:23] it is bringing us to perfection
[43:26] and all we got to do is let it happen
[43:28] amen because you can't do it
[43:31] you can't sanctify yourself
[43:34] huh you couldn't justify yourself so how
[43:37] you're going to sanctify yourself
[43:39] it takes the word of god to sanctify you
[43:42] and in his time
[43:43] right in his time
[43:45] god will sanctify you
[43:48] you love the lord
[43:50] oh yes
[43:54] think about it
[43:59] many times
[44:02] people
[44:03] do a lot of great things
[44:06] and sometimes people do wonderful things
[44:08] especially in the world and folks says
[44:10] oh my goodness he was a saint
[44:13] or she was a saint
[44:16] and you know why they do that because
[44:18] these people through their lives have
[44:20] done such great wonderful works
[44:22] help people
[44:24] and the bible says you can do all of
[44:26] that
[44:28] and have not charity
[44:30] it profits you nothing
[44:32] but understand now god is the judge
[44:36] at the end of the day
[44:38] people who are if i could say won't make
[44:41] it to heaven
[44:42] but come up in the white throne judgment
[44:45] because they have been good to you
[44:48] god is going to grant them eternal life
[44:51] think about that now
[44:53] because those people as well as we are
[44:57] what we are we have been ordained to be
[44:59] bride and they have been ordained to be
[45:01] what they are
[45:03] but god is merciful
[45:05] god is just
[45:07] hallelujah because he said as you've
[45:10] done unto the least of these you've done
[45:13] it unto me
[45:14] so you and i must understand we
[45:16] shouldn't even worry about people
[45:18] oh god i just wonder if they're going to
[45:20] be saved well if it was in god's mind
[45:22] for them to be saved they will be amen
[45:24] and one thing for i
[45:26] one thing i know is that faith is a
[45:28] creation a creator
[45:32] i just saw something the other day and
[45:34] science is now tapping into it because
[45:37] they thought one time that man in the
[45:39] universe was separate from the other
[45:42] right and then god comes along
[45:45] and and through science has proven to uh
[45:49] uh to the scientists that man is
[45:51] connected to everything
[45:53] and no matter how far it goes out into
[45:56] the universe
[45:57] we are affect affecting it you
[46:00] understand me what we do now is
[46:02] affecting that you say oh it can't be
[46:05] well let me say it like this to put it
[46:06] in the word when adam sinned the whole
[46:09] creation fell
[46:11] huh everything failed
[46:14] and so everything we do that's why the
[46:16] bible says be careful about your
[46:17] wordings
[46:19] right don't let them be idle because
[46:21] everything is creative
[46:23] especially when you're observing
[46:25] something i heard brother adam said if
[46:27] you you want the holy ghost of you want
[46:29] perfection he said view your especially
[46:31] when you see when you're sick he said if
[46:33] you can envision yourself healed
[46:36] and then walk into it
[46:38] amen and then the scientists are saying
[46:40] the same thing they call it photons
[46:43] futons
[46:44] and they did an experiment where they
[46:46] actually had this big board and they
[46:48] actually had two slits in it and then
[46:50] they fired the futons and and one when
[46:54] the futons were not being observed
[46:56] it went straight
[46:58] but they noticed that when when the
[47:00] futons were being observed they acted in
[47:03] a different way
[47:05] showing amen that we have an effect on
[47:09] creation
[47:10] bring it down to the message brother
[47:12] branham said you can create your
[47:13] atmosphere
[47:15] you hear what i'm saying you can create
[47:18] it no matter how hey let me you know
[47:20] where they broke it down to
[47:22] prayer how prayer
[47:26] here in des moines can reach somebody
[47:29] in guyana
[47:31] south america
[47:32] it's the creation it's the futons it's
[47:36] the power of god who connects us to the
[47:38] universe
[47:41] we're connected to heaven
[47:43] amen sin broke us up pretty much but the
[47:46] holy ghost unites us
[47:48] hallelujah that's why the bible says
[47:50] we're now sitting in heavenly places in
[47:52] christ jesus amen
[47:55] what are you going to do
[47:58] with all of this power and authority
[48:00] that god has given to us
[48:02] so much so he said you're so connected
[48:05] to nature that if you say to a mountain
[48:08] be moved that mountain has to hear in
[48:10] movies
[48:11] you understand me so you say what do you
[48:13] mean i'm talking about god's faith
[48:16] and god's faith is in the bride of jesus
[48:18] christ now your faith
[48:21] god's faith
[48:23] and when we see that god has a purpose
[48:26] for us to do we need to express
[48:28] ourselves the reason why i entitle it
[48:32] uh this is your your season
[48:35] because there's not there's there's not
[48:36] coming another one
[48:38] this is the end of it
[48:40] right into eternity we we moves
[48:43] and the bride of jesus christ is what we
[48:45] call the finale of the whole drama
[48:48] and she takes everything and you
[48:50] understand what a finale is it takes
[48:52] everything that had previously come
[48:53] before it and cap it off
[48:56] and that's what god is trying to tell us
[48:58] but you got to understand that
[49:00] condemnation in your spirit of yourself
[49:04] hinders you
[49:05] and it creates a negative atmosphere and
[49:08] therefore it hinders the purpose of god
[49:10] in you amen now these things were
[49:12] brought to me and i'm trying to tell us
[49:14] tonight amen this is why uh i was
[49:17] telling a brother the other day the
[49:18] scripture says if you keep
[49:20] your mind stared on me
[49:22] i will grant you perfect peace what is
[49:25] perfect peace but god himself
[49:28] you can't get it no better than that if
[49:30] you got perfect peace you got perfect
[49:32] faith listen paul before he died had
[49:34] perfect peace oh you going to nero's
[49:37] chopping block he didn't laugh at nero
[49:40] he laughed at the devil oh death where's
[49:43] your stain oh grave where is your
[49:46] victory he's speaking these things
[49:48] thanks be to god who gives us a victory
[49:50] through our lord and savior jesus christ
[49:52] he's speaking and understand brother
[49:54] branham said when you speak the word of
[49:56] god you got angels that must bring that
[50:00] makes it come to pass
[50:02] it all is all connected you say it can't
[50:05] be it is even when brother branham was
[50:07] born there was a star that showed up in
[50:10] the sky not only just showed up in the
[50:12] sky but came down and hovered over his
[50:14] head
[50:15] as a baby he didn't know nothing about
[50:17] no stars
[50:19] but the god of the universe did
[50:21] hallelujah the same with moses it's the
[50:23] same with jesus y'all understand me the
[50:26] pillar fire witness
[50:29] who he was and what he was
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:33] is that right oh you say what do you
[50:35] mean now scientists are saying amen that
[50:38] even man is made out of the cosmic dust
[50:41] well i could have told them that
[50:45] hallelujah and you and i must understand
[50:47] that before we get the holy ghost the
[50:50] light that's in us is cosmic light
[50:53] then brother said when you get the holy
[50:54] ghost that holy ghost life moves the
[50:57] cosmic light out of the way
[51:00] amen oh people of god see what i'm
[51:03] saying but as long as the devil can have
[51:06] you condemning yourself and making you
[51:07] think that you're responsible or you've
[51:10] got
[51:10] you've got control over your life you
[51:12] have no control
[51:14] and nothing you do whether positive or
[51:16] negative is going to stop you from
[51:18] making it
[51:19] because what god has determined can't
[51:22] come back void amen
[51:26] now don't get me wrong i'm not saying go
[51:27] ahead out here in sin the bible says
[51:30] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[51:31] abound say god forbid if you are truly
[51:35] christian if you truly got the holy
[51:36] ghost you're going to do everything you
[51:38] can do to measure up to the word of god
[51:41] amen hallelujah but understand that we
[51:44] cannot sin amen
[51:46] amen
[51:47] the bible say the best seed remaineth in
[51:49] you you cannot sin
[51:52] james says you have faults
[51:55] confess your faults one toward another
[51:57] you understand me because as long as we
[51:59] are in this body this body has to sin
[52:02] nature it hasn't changed yet and because
[52:05] of this body we falter and fail
[52:08] sometimes
[52:09] is that right not a mistake it's a
[52:11] mistake when you didn't know you were
[52:12] going to do it but a mistake is not a
[52:14] mistake when you know what you're doing
[52:16] amen that's not a mistake that's sin
[52:19] you understand me
[52:22] oh yeah
[52:24] understand that god what for ordained
[52:26] works
[52:30] you love the lord amen
[52:35] and you understand that these four dane
[52:37] um
[52:38] works that god has for us
[52:42] none of us says oh i'm just going to
[52:44] serve the lord
[52:47] none of us
[52:48] it was god who drew us that's right it
[52:50] was god who changed our hearts it was
[52:52] god who changed our mind it was god who
[52:54] gave you faith
[52:56] faith is a gift from god
[52:58] you understand me and all men don't have
[53:00] faith that's the word so whatever god
[53:03] has given you use your measure use your
[53:06] measure to the fullest
[53:08] but don't think because i'm a preacher
[53:11] i'm going to make heaven or singer or
[53:14] piano player or usher or deacon those
[53:17] things those are little gifts and those
[53:18] kind of gifts god gives you
[53:21] but the bible said god gives those gifts
[53:24] a man without repentance you don't have
[53:26] to repent to get that
[53:28] you understand me so understand you
[53:30] can't say oh because i'm a preacher i'm
[53:32] going to heaven no sir the only ones
[53:34] that are going to heaven are those who
[53:36] are born again and come to the full
[53:38] stature of christ in this day
[53:41] know i mean rapture y'all know what i'm
[53:42] working with amen
[53:44] so you say well oh my brother brooks
[53:46] brother brooks what are you saying
[53:48] you know a lot of times
[53:50] we we
[53:51] we the calvinist or armenian
[53:55] it's very difficult for people to find a
[53:57] balance
[53:58] saved always you know saved and well i
[54:01] ain't going to do nothing to god make me
[54:03] do it or something you know and that
[54:05] there's no balance in there see that's
[54:07] what a lot of the uh baptist and all
[54:09] dude that's why they dress and act the
[54:11] way they act because they just figure
[54:13] you know i can do whatever i want to do
[54:14] i'm saying
[54:16] no no that ain't it
[54:17] no when you love god the bible says keep
[54:20] my commandments this is a relationship
[54:23] hallelujah this is not a club or large
[54:26] this is a relationship that you must
[54:28] have with god amen and the closer we
[54:31] walk with god the more god will reveal
[54:33] to us
[54:35] hallelujah i'm not going to be long
[54:36] tonight
[54:37] hallelujah but let's go to matthew the 4
[54:40] 6 chapter again
[54:44] matthew 6
[54:46] you love the lord
[54:49] am i
[54:50] you know what if people can see what
[54:52] salvation has done for them it would
[54:55] truly set them free
[54:58] and people of god i'm not pointing at
[55:00] nobody i'm saying i'm learning myself
[55:04] i'm learning
[55:06] my freedom
[55:08] you know because the bible said when
[55:09] you're saved it washes away the guilt
[55:12] consciousness
[55:14] and i used to struggle what if he washes
[55:15] away the guilt consciousness because now
[55:19] you know what you are and you understand
[55:21] how god thinks about you
[55:24] so you're not feeling all this guilt and
[55:26] oh
[55:27] what i did and what i used to do and how
[55:29] i did that and all that stuff once it's
[55:32] under the blood of jesus christ you move
[55:34] on amen
[55:36] ain't nothing you can do that's going to
[55:38] surprise god
[55:41] amen
[55:42] you think god didn't know that jonah was
[55:44] going to run from him
[55:48] go just the opposite way he knew
[55:52] god had planned the plot
[55:55] jonah ran right into the whale's belly
[55:57] mouth right he knew god prepared it
[56:00] already y'all understand what i'm saying
[56:03] now you look at this thing
[56:06] the bible said abraham staggered dot
[56:09] and as i said i want to ask abraham
[56:12] how in the world could you tell sarah to
[56:14] tell that man you you know i mean but
[56:16] understand to me that's that's
[56:19] that's
[56:20] that's rough
[56:22] that's real rough i can't comprehend
[56:24] that but he did it
[56:26] and brother branham said it like this he
[56:28] said abraham types the bride
[56:31] he's a bride he's a type of the bride
[56:33] as he as god dealt with abraham god
[56:35] deals with abraham see the same way
[56:38] that means we are capable
[56:40] of doing some of the most vilest things
[56:44] but god is capable
[56:46] of cleansing you from all of it
[56:50] and before we all came to christ we
[56:52] revived
[56:54] amen at least to most of us anyway
[57:00] because everything the only person that
[57:02] comes out squeaky clean in all of this
[57:04] is jesus himself
[57:07] he's the only one that comes out squeaky
[57:10] clean
[57:10] what i said matthew
[57:12] the sixth chapter
[57:16] you love the lord
[57:26] fourth verse
[57:32] let's go to the third verse but when
[57:34] thou do with arms let not thy left hand
[57:38] know that right hand
[57:40] doeth
[57:41] that that thine arms may be in secret
[57:45] and that father which in secret
[57:47] seeth in secret himself shall reward
[57:50] thee openly you understand that
[57:52] that means that you're not seeking the
[57:54] will of man or the rewards of men
[57:57] but you're literally
[57:59] doing these things as unto the lord as
[58:01] our brother said
[58:03] right you're not even you're not accept
[58:04] you're not seeking
[58:06] self-glorification but you're doing this
[58:08] as unto the lord and when you do things
[58:10] like that unto the lord nobody needs to
[58:12] know what you're doing
[58:15] hello
[58:16] that's the truth that's when god rewards
[58:18] you
[58:20] in this life now that that's not talking
[58:22] about on the other side that's talking
[58:24] about this life amen
[58:28] right so you go on you say wait a minute
[58:30] brother let's move on
[58:33] and when thou prayeth thou shall not be
[58:35] as the hypocrites are
[58:38] for they love to pray standing in the
[58:41] synagogues and in the corners of the
[58:43] streets that they may be seen of men
[58:46] verily i say unto you they have their
[58:49] rewards
[58:51] and that's one of the reasons why i
[58:52] don't like praying in public or in the
[58:54] church and stuff like that because i
[58:56] have a battle
[58:57] to keep the channel straight
[59:00] i don't want to be praying for people to
[59:02] enjoy i want god to hear it
[59:07] right so it's difficult sometimes
[59:09] because you even i'm saying with myself
[59:11] because you want to make sure your
[59:13] english is right and who cares
[59:17] god don't care about that
[59:19] but that's the way the devil will cause
[59:21] you to air
[59:22] and you'll forget you're talking to god
[59:25] and you're praying like you're talking
[59:26] to the people
[59:28] you've got your reward
[59:32] so we got to understand
[59:34] every work he expressed was meant to
[59:37] bring salvation to some and cause others
[59:40] to hate him
[59:42] is that the truth
[59:44] what's wrong with that
[59:45] god
[59:47] want every time we look at things and we
[59:49] see what god is doing
[59:52] god amen does things to call some to
[59:55] love him and some to hate him
[59:58] amen that's what god does
[1:00:02] and you and i must understand these
[1:00:04] things
[1:00:05] are real
[1:00:06] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:00:08] but i'm going to tell you one thing
[1:00:10] about the election the elect of god
[1:00:13] the elect of god do not trust in her own
[1:00:15] works
[1:00:18] how many of y'all think y'all can work
[1:00:19] your way to heaven
[1:00:22] and that's where we fall short don't we
[1:00:25] because we fail to see what grace is
[1:00:27] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[1:00:30] let me show you what grace does grace
[1:00:33] saved a sinner
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:37] had never done works in his life
[1:00:40] never perhaps thought about god didn't
[1:00:42] have him on his mind
[1:00:43] but on day on the day of calvary
[1:00:47] he said lord remember me
[1:00:49] when you come into the kingdom
[1:00:52] see
[1:00:53] so when you when you see what god is
[1:00:55] doing
[1:00:56] if god did it once he can do it again
[1:00:59] but what was he doing he was showing to
[1:01:02] the believer
[1:01:04] what god was thinking about the sinner
[1:01:07] and the man was a vile sinner but in the
[1:01:10] mind of god he was bride
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:16] right at the last minute
[1:01:19] a lot of times people don't understand
[1:01:21] you don't know the relationship that
[1:01:23] people have
[1:01:24] and maybe they don't have one at all
[1:01:27] but in the mind of god they were with
[1:01:29] him
[1:01:31] and even at that last moment i know a
[1:01:34] lot of people won't believe this but
[1:01:35] it's true anyhow and one of these days
[1:01:37] we'll see that because brother branham
[1:01:39] said they're going to be a lot of people
[1:01:41] saved you thought wasn't going to be
[1:01:42] there and there'll be many that you
[1:01:44] thought would be there would not be
[1:01:45] there
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:48] that's just the way it runs
[1:01:53] hallelujah
[1:01:54] you know and
[1:01:55] in all that we do
[1:01:57] our works are supposed to
[1:02:00] supposed to
[1:02:01] uh witness uh what we are and who we
[1:02:04] are you know you you got a christian and
[1:02:07] she she she looking like a jezebel well
[1:02:11] that's quite hard for us to
[1:02:14] really believe that person is a
[1:02:15] christian
[1:02:17] i remember seeing this
[1:02:19] so-called uh and not demeaning her
[1:02:21] because maybe she doesn't know any
[1:02:23] better
[1:02:24] but
[1:02:25] she was one of those uh
[1:02:28] gospel singers out there
[1:02:30] i mean she looked like she was in a
[1:02:32] nightclub or some kind of a less show
[1:02:35] with what she was wearing and
[1:02:36] she was singing the song i know i've
[1:02:39] been changed
[1:02:43] got home
[1:02:45] the angels in heaven has changed
[1:02:47] my name sign my name change what
[1:02:51] because what's on the inside will
[1:02:53] reflect on the outside
[1:02:56] and though we you know
[1:02:58] how can i say it we must understand that
[1:03:01] when it comes to grace
[1:03:03] grace is sovereign as brother branham
[1:03:05] said in the message of grace
[1:03:07] grace is sovereign
[1:03:10] and god will have mercy on whom he will
[1:03:14] that's why i was saying that song
[1:03:16] who have known the mind of god
[1:03:19] and who his counselor
[1:03:22] will be
[1:03:23] i mean you understand me god is
[1:03:25] sovereign he have mercy on whom he will
[1:03:28] you have grace on whom he will
[1:03:30] and who's going to stop him
[1:03:33] if the bible says no man can lay a
[1:03:35] charge to god's elect who's going to
[1:03:37] charge him
[1:03:39] huh
[1:03:41] hey you say all brothers what are you
[1:03:42] saying that's why we'll find out at the
[1:03:45] end of the day
[1:03:47] people who work let me tell you
[1:03:49] something
[1:03:50] you need to understand what the true
[1:03:51] grace of god is
[1:03:53] because if you go before god with words
[1:03:55] he's going to respond to you with works
[1:03:58] that's what the rich young ruler did he
[1:03:59] did not have a revelation of the grace
[1:04:01] of god and he says lord what must i do
[1:04:04] to inherit
[1:04:07] the kingdom
[1:04:08] and jesus said boom he went down through
[1:04:10] the ten commandments oh i've done them
[1:04:12] all
[1:04:12] but
[1:04:13] he didn't know that was the word the
[1:04:15] word saw through the heart and
[1:04:17] understood that he loved his riches more
[1:04:19] than he loved god
[1:04:21] and you can't allow yourself to love
[1:04:23] something more than you love god god
[1:04:26] must come first
[1:04:29] hallelujah
[1:04:31] you and i must understand we're getting
[1:04:33] ready to go through a persecution and we
[1:04:35] will be prior to this rapture
[1:04:38] and if you don't understand grace
[1:04:40] you don't know what you might say you
[1:04:42] don't know what you might do
[1:04:44] you understand me but the grace of god
[1:04:46] has been with us
[1:04:48] i mean when peter got under pressure he
[1:04:50] cursed and everything else and denied
[1:04:51] god and god still kept him amen
[1:05:00] yeah but it doesn't give us rights amen
[1:05:02] to go out and start cursing folks
[1:05:04] that's not grace
[1:05:07] we don't trust in our works
[1:05:09] that's what i'm saying because if you
[1:05:11] trusted in your works you're condemning
[1:05:14] yourself because your works will never
[1:05:16] be good enough amen you're condemning
[1:05:18] yourself you're working under such a law
[1:05:20] in such a place amen that you're always
[1:05:24] you can never satisfy this flesh this
[1:05:27] flesh could never be righteous that's
[1:05:29] why god's gonna change it
[1:05:32] it's the inner man that god is looking
[1:05:33] at not the outward man
[1:05:36] paul said the good that i would i don't
[1:05:38] do
[1:05:39] then that which i desire to do i find
[1:05:41] myself not doing it
[1:05:43] the prophet there of the ephesus age was
[1:05:46] confessing
[1:05:47] he wasn't all of that either
[1:05:50] but he said i pressed toward the mark
[1:05:53] of a high calling which is in christ
[1:05:55] jesus
[1:05:56] paul understood his mission and paul
[1:05:58] understood that he was supposed to
[1:06:00] suffer for christ
[1:06:02] is that what the holy spirit told him
[1:06:04] because of what you've done you're going
[1:06:06] to suffer many things
[1:06:08] for my name's sake and paul is oh god
[1:06:12] the only thing that paul asked god to
[1:06:14] heal him
[1:06:15] from was his eye disease
[1:06:19] he said how you know it was an eye
[1:06:20] disease because brother branham said it
[1:06:22] and he wouldn't get because of the
[1:06:24] pillow fire because of the scabs and
[1:06:26] stuff like that he had always had that
[1:06:27] plus and whatever running out of his eye
[1:06:29] and paul even said there were some of
[1:06:30] you who thought i was jesus christ and
[1:06:32] you would have plucked your own eye out
[1:06:34] and give it to me
[1:06:35] you understand me so paul had the same
[1:06:38] kind of
[1:06:40] fanaticism following him
[1:06:44] but understand your position as bride
[1:06:48] we will not leave out of here as
[1:06:51] failures
[1:06:53] will not leave out here as cowards
[1:06:55] this is your season and your season
[1:06:58] should be that season of staying in the
[1:07:00] presence of the lord
[1:07:02] amen hallelujah i thought about that the
[1:07:05] bible says pray without ceasing
[1:07:08] staying in the presence of the lord
[1:07:11] i says lord
[1:07:12] how you just do that
[1:07:17] and the lord said
[1:07:18] to me i believe he's talking to me
[1:07:20] because i was talking to him
[1:07:22] you let me do it
[1:07:25] you desire it
[1:07:26] you ask for it
[1:07:28] i will fulfill it
[1:07:31] because none of us can do that
[1:07:35] not one of us can do that
[1:07:37] with all of our efforts we could never
[1:07:41] do that
[1:07:43] the greatest of all men
[1:07:46] couldn't do it
[1:07:48] you say oh what do you mean just to show
[1:07:50] you i'm not saying just you go out and
[1:07:52] do things you ought not to do but david
[1:07:54] took another man's wife but the grace of
[1:07:56] god was with david
[1:07:58] and god even calls david you know he's a
[1:08:01] man after his own heart
[1:08:04] explain that one to me
[1:08:06] you see because he understood the intent
[1:08:08] of david he knew the purpose of david
[1:08:10] and he also knew the devil's tricks
[1:08:15] hallelujah and god knows every time the
[1:08:17] devil has tricked you to do something
[1:08:19] that you shouldn't do and god don't hold
[1:08:21] you chargeable
[1:08:23] why you believe god
[1:08:25] and your believing god is god has
[1:08:28] counted it as righteousness
[1:08:30] hallelujah i feel like shouting tonight
[1:08:33] because the grace of god surpasses this
[1:08:35] is why i say hey everybody want all all
[1:08:38] these laws and all these rules and that
[1:08:40] i mean that they're good you know we're
[1:08:42] supposed to correct the church and put
[1:08:43] things in order and things like that
[1:08:45] especially when a brother and sister is
[1:08:46] purposely walking disorderly but when
[1:08:49] somebody falls short
[1:08:51] the grace of god should be there
[1:08:54] you don't you don't stop and kill your
[1:08:56] soldiers
[1:08:57] you pack them on your back
[1:08:59] if you got to carry them you carry them
[1:09:01] you understand me
[1:09:03] that's what the love of god is you don't
[1:09:05] have grace you don't have love
[1:09:08] you don't have love you don't have grace
[1:09:11] we
[1:09:11] you you know how it is you think about
[1:09:14] it and you think grace and love don't
[1:09:16] care about what nobody else thinks
[1:09:18] when it comes to the services of god
[1:09:20] what do you mean
[1:09:21] jesus came to simon's house
[1:09:24] sent there by god
[1:09:27] knew
[1:09:28] the prostitute mary was coming
[1:09:31] knew
[1:09:32] the ridicule he was going to get
[1:09:34] knew how people was going to judge him
[1:09:37] you see what they did they judged him
[1:09:39] and says how can this man be of god and
[1:09:41] don't know this kind of a woman the
[1:09:43] problem was they didn't know he did know
[1:09:46] them know her he knew her better than
[1:09:48] they did
[1:09:49] and here was mary didn't even know it
[1:09:52] she was going to be in the book forever
[1:09:56] under the inspiration
[1:09:58] of thirst
[1:10:01] because jesus said if you thirst
[1:10:03] after righteousness
[1:10:05] you shall be filled
[1:10:07] and she thoughts for that righteousness
[1:10:10] she was willing to die to her own pride
[1:10:14] and she went into simon's house
[1:10:17] saw jesus there and all she could do was
[1:10:20] worship him see that's the problem we
[1:10:23] fail to see we come to worship him
[1:10:26] it was it was vast i who refused to
[1:10:28] worship god
[1:10:31] that's true her husband
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:34] the king that was in shout and tight
[1:10:37] but esther worshipped him she always
[1:10:40] showed respect to the king even at a
[1:10:43] time
[1:10:44] when she was in call or summon she still
[1:10:47] respected him
[1:10:51] she didn't come up there like a little
[1:10:52] sassy woman
[1:10:54] she came in humility
[1:10:57] hallelujah
[1:10:58] like i said even when it comes to the
[1:11:00] sinner we don't sin i mean a christian
[1:11:03] we don't sin now you can't have a sinner
[1:11:06] and a saint at the same time you can't
[1:11:07] be a sinner in the same that's why i say
[1:11:09] you got to watch your motives
[1:11:12] because if you're doing something and
[1:11:13] you know it's wrong you're doing it
[1:11:15] that's saying
[1:11:17] it's when you stomp your toe
[1:11:19] you didn't know you was going to stump
[1:11:20] your toe
[1:11:22] that's a mistake
[1:11:23] you understand me a mistake is something
[1:11:26] that you don't know is going to happen
[1:11:27] and it happens but when you think about
[1:11:30] what you're doing
[1:11:31] that's sin
[1:11:33] oh i don't get a great amen on that one
[1:11:36] [Laughter]
[1:11:39] but they just can't be mistakes if you
[1:11:41] know what you're doing
[1:11:44] when you're doing it
[1:11:46] that's not a mistake
[1:11:49] understand as long as this nature is
[1:11:51] with us
[1:11:52] and it will be into the changing of the
[1:11:53] body
[1:11:54] you're going to struggle
[1:11:56] the bible said we were born and shaping
[1:11:58] in iniquity and in sin did our mothers
[1:12:00] conceive us
[1:12:02] that's what it is
[1:12:03] right you don't have to teach a child
[1:12:05] how to lie
[1:12:06] you don't have to teach a child how to
[1:12:08] steal
[1:12:09] that nature is there
[1:12:10] but because we are born again we know
[1:12:13] how to hush him up
[1:12:15] right we know how to destroy that nation
[1:12:18] god will come in and continue like i
[1:12:20] said with a disease you've been healed
[1:12:22] and that disease takes a little time for
[1:12:24] your body to flush it out so is it with
[1:12:27] everything else
[1:12:30] you love the lord amen
[1:12:32] he takes every desire of sin away from
[1:12:34] you and ever and when god fully gets you
[1:12:37] to a place where he's taken every bit of
[1:12:40] that sin desire away from you you are
[1:12:43] completely there
[1:12:47] y'all hear me
[1:12:48] yeah take it away lord
[1:12:50] take it away that's what grace does
[1:12:52] because without grace we all would be
[1:12:54] dead
[1:12:56] right now
[1:12:57] way before now
[1:12:58] oh yes all of us dead
[1:13:01] buried and everything else
[1:13:03] if it wasn't for the grace of god
[1:13:07] and so we understand one thing because
[1:13:09] we
[1:13:10] make mistakes doesn't make us
[1:13:12] unbelievers
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] let me say that again because we make
[1:13:17] mistakes
[1:13:18] doesn't make us unbelievers
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:22] unbelievers is when you know to do
[1:13:24] to do good and you do it it's not
[1:13:26] because
[1:13:27] unbelief is sin
[1:13:29] right but we confess we spill confess we
[1:13:33] make things right with god right and
[1:13:36] understand god in this age where we are
[1:13:39] we are the most how can i say we have
[1:13:41] the greatest liberty of er of all the
[1:13:45] ages amen
[1:13:47] to express god
[1:13:50] to express what he wants
[1:13:52] to express his life
[1:13:54] we have all the ages we have the room
[1:13:58] for all of him
[1:14:01] you understand me every age coming from
[1:14:04] ephesus on up uh after ephesus had a
[1:14:06] portion of god but here
[1:14:10] we have uh the place where all
[1:14:13] all of god can be filled placed in you
[1:14:16] now everybody has a little measure of it
[1:14:18] but all of god is in that measure is
[1:14:20] that right brother of adam said a little
[1:14:22] teaspoon of the ocean
[1:14:25] has all the substance everything the
[1:14:27] ocean has is in that little teaspoon see
[1:14:29] that's how god is i'm almost done
[1:14:33] because i'm trying to tell her something
[1:14:34] i don't know whether i'm getting it over
[1:14:36] to you or not
[1:14:41] one of the things that we must learn to
[1:14:43] do is
[1:14:44] trust our faith
[1:14:46] or have trust in our faith
[1:14:49] you understand me because that faith was
[1:14:51] given to you by god
[1:14:53] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:14:55] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:14:57] faith
[1:14:59] faith
[1:15:00] god said to to abraham uh abraham call
[1:15:03] those things that be not as though they
[1:15:05] were
[1:15:05] that was faith
[1:15:07] who can do that but god
[1:15:09] amen that ain't the kind of faith that
[1:15:11] man has
[1:15:12] gods call those things that be not as
[1:15:15] though they were and it happened amen
[1:15:18] right before they ever was a star before
[1:15:21] there was a moon before they ever was a
[1:15:23] solar system god called those things
[1:15:26] that be not as though they were and they
[1:15:29] had to come to existence
[1:15:32] and that's what you have to do call
[1:15:34] those things you don't have to see it
[1:15:36] you don't have to even envision it
[1:15:38] as long as you got the word and that
[1:15:41] inspiration comes to you where do you
[1:15:43] think it's coming from the devil don't
[1:15:44] want to give you nothing good
[1:15:47] the inspiration of faith comes from god
[1:15:50] and he wants you to step in that and
[1:15:52] trust in that faith
[1:15:56] hallelujah
[1:15:58] hallelujah
[1:16:00] hallelujah
[1:16:02] the bible said we know that whosoever is
[1:16:04] born of god sinneth not but he that is
[1:16:07] begotten of god keepeth himself now you
[1:16:10] know you can't keep yourself
[1:16:13] but god is the maintenance man
[1:16:16] he's the one that maintains us
[1:16:19] right he is our is that right it's the
[1:16:21] shepherd that takes care of the sheep
[1:16:24] it's not the sheep that take care of
[1:16:25] itself we're too dumb
[1:16:27] amen it takes god who keepeth us
[1:16:31] hallelujah and how do he keeps us
[1:16:33] through our prayer through our trust
[1:16:35] through our faith through our love
[1:16:37] all of that god uses that because let me
[1:16:40] tell you something if you really want
[1:16:42] god to smile upon you have faith in him
[1:16:47] god honors your faith
[1:16:49] in him
[1:16:50] yes sir and a lot of time when the devil
[1:16:52] says it ain't going to happen you got to
[1:16:54] say devil you know what i know you you a
[1:16:56] liar
[1:16:58] hold that in his face you're a liar
[1:17:01] because god says so and when god tells
[1:17:03] you anything believe it
[1:17:06] it doesn't have to be written
[1:17:09] that's right
[1:17:10] you understand me because in the
[1:17:12] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:17:14] god and like i said the other day the
[1:17:16] word wasn't written
[1:17:17] it was a person
[1:17:20] hallelujah and that word today is still
[1:17:22] a person who is jesus christ himself
[1:17:25] amen and when you call on the name of
[1:17:28] jesus
[1:17:29] he will answer prayer
[1:17:31] hallelujah
[1:17:32] god will always come to your rescue
[1:17:36] that was one of the things that i so
[1:17:38] enjoyed when i was out there in arizona
[1:17:41] at brother bob's church and
[1:17:43] it was a it had been a long time since i
[1:17:45] felt god brush up against me
[1:17:48] oh jesus
[1:17:51] had been a long time i think the time
[1:17:53] that he brushed up against me i think we
[1:17:55] was in that church on 100th street
[1:17:58] and i was preaching and i went to move
[1:18:00] this and something bumped into me and i
[1:18:02] was way from the wall
[1:18:05] that same service my wife was praying
[1:18:08] she thought somebody had kneeled down to
[1:18:10] pray with her remember hon and somebody
[1:18:12] put their arms around her and then who
[1:18:14] was that for jesus
[1:18:16] see that's how real he is
[1:18:19] and you know i want to see that again
[1:18:22] is there anything wrong with that i want
[1:18:23] to see that again hallelujah but in a
[1:18:27] greater measure that's what brother
[1:18:29] branham said we hold fast our faith our
[1:18:32] professional confession he said one of
[1:18:34] these old days he will materialize
[1:18:37] before you
[1:18:40] i believe that
[1:18:42] i believe that and i'm looking for that
[1:18:45] hallelujah but you got to understand
[1:18:48] i'm cutting it short faith in his word
[1:18:50] is what perfects us
[1:18:53] if you can't you can't believe you can
[1:18:54] be perfected then
[1:18:56] then
[1:18:57] he can't perfect you amen i believe it i
[1:19:00] believe every one of those virtues are
[1:19:01] in me
[1:19:02] and i believe every one of those virtues
[1:19:04] will it's going to express
[1:19:06] itself and i believe in god's own time i
[1:19:09] will reach that perfection that he wants
[1:19:11] me to reach
[1:19:12] nothing can stop it
[1:19:15] that's what i love about it you know
[1:19:17] you know i won't say this but i will say
[1:19:20] it you know how those little kids when
[1:19:21] they used to want to be sassy they just
[1:19:23] got to do this kind of thing
[1:19:25] he kind of make you want to do that at
[1:19:26] the devil you know
[1:19:32] because there's a thing he can do about
[1:19:34] it
[1:19:35] you see the world can't come back
[1:19:37] forward
[1:19:38] people this is the time we should be the
[1:19:40] most joyous of all times
[1:19:42] we really see the coming of the lord
[1:19:44] don't you see it and understand who
[1:19:47] would have seen this like we can see it
[1:19:49] when brother branham preached a message
[1:19:51] satan's eden
[1:19:52] we never thought we could see the all
[1:19:55] the politics
[1:19:57] flooded with devils
[1:20:00] and they're coming after the word amen
[1:20:04] this is what the listen people say oh it
[1:20:06] ain't gonna get no better folks
[1:20:09] it's not happening it is this season
[1:20:12] that it's the darkest before dawn and
[1:20:15] it's gonna get darker
[1:20:17] and think about it when it's all over
[1:20:20] they're going to come after the
[1:20:21] christian and they don't care what
[1:20:23] denomination you belong to but when they
[1:20:25] understand you say well i don't know
[1:20:27] well they know you
[1:20:30] they already know your number
[1:20:32] they know what you how much money you
[1:20:34] got in the bank
[1:20:35] they know all those things there ain't
[1:20:37] no secret
[1:20:38] they know what you believe what you
[1:20:40] don't believe
[1:20:43] right you got a phone they know where
[1:20:45] you go and where you don't go
[1:20:48] they know all of that
[1:20:50] so how you gonna run
[1:20:52] first of all you got too much heat
[1:20:54] you got too much fire in you so they got
[1:20:57] they got machines they can show
[1:21:00] know exactly where you're running
[1:21:02] huh
[1:21:04] there's no escape except in christ
[1:21:08] that's the only escape
[1:21:10] in christ alone
[1:21:14] will i give the glory
[1:21:17] in christ alone
[1:21:19] let me read this last quote
[1:21:31] ah
[1:21:34] the message of grace
[1:21:37] grace was promised in the garden of eden
[1:21:41] and grace came
[1:21:42] grace can't get grace to adam and eve
[1:21:46] nowhere to go
[1:21:48] know which way to turn and yet grace
[1:21:51] made a way think about it
[1:21:53] let me say
[1:21:54] this my sinner friend
[1:21:58] you may be here this morning a
[1:22:00] prostitute
[1:22:01] you may be here this morning a woman
[1:22:04] chaser
[1:22:06] you may be here a drunkard or a gambler
[1:22:09] or a murderer
[1:22:11] you might be here as
[1:22:13] an impure husband
[1:22:15] or impure wife
[1:22:17] you might be violent of the violence of
[1:22:20] sinners
[1:22:21] you say i've passed that stage of
[1:22:24] redemption
[1:22:25] no you're not
[1:22:27] or you wouldn't be at church this
[1:22:30] morning
[1:22:31] grace will make a way for you
[1:22:33] in the dark hour if you just accept it
[1:22:39] adam
[1:22:40] right if you just accepted adam had to
[1:22:43] be willing to accept it so do you
[1:22:47] accept it
[1:22:48] take your hands off of god's work
[1:22:51] and let god work in you
[1:22:54] you understand me
[1:22:55] because it's hard sometimes to accept
[1:22:58] grace for what it really is because the
[1:23:00] devil is always there to call you call
[1:23:02] you a hypocrite
[1:23:06] and there's no greater hypocrite than
[1:23:08] the devil
[1:23:10] y'all understand me let's stand
[1:23:14] but this is your season
[1:23:16] and i believe with all of my heart
[1:23:19] if we learn
[1:23:21] to just praise god and worship him
[1:23:24] and give him what is because nothing can
[1:23:27] save you
[1:23:28] he saved you
[1:23:30] nothing you can do
[1:23:31] the pharisees they thought they could
[1:23:33] save themselves and the more they tried
[1:23:35] the worse they got brother branham said
[1:23:38] it's like a leper trying to lick his
[1:23:39] spots
[1:23:40] the more you lick the more the spots
[1:23:42] become clearer and that's how we do in
[1:23:45] our lives we try to transform ourselves
[1:23:48] yeah you transform on your knees there
[1:23:50] you go when the prophet god talks about
[1:23:53] remaining in the holiest of holies i
[1:23:54] said ah how do you do that
[1:23:57] it's when you can get in your present
[1:23:59] your closet and you pray until god comes
[1:24:03] that's that holy place
[1:24:05] and you begin to pray the more you pray
[1:24:07] the more you stay
[1:24:10] right
[1:24:10] there are times i tell you my mom
[1:24:13] reached something
[1:24:14] because in her day i would go to school
[1:24:17] and when i come back my mom was still
[1:24:19] locked in that bathroom still praying
[1:24:22] oh yeah
[1:24:23] and i'm not just talking about her i'm
[1:24:25] sure there have been others i heard of a
[1:24:27] pastor years ago he prayed so much to
[1:24:29] all of his parents had
[1:24:31] where his knees wore out
[1:24:34] what a wonderful testimony
[1:24:36] and you think about how we struggle
[1:24:39] and prayer
[1:24:41] understand me is not always just a
[1:24:43] feeling
[1:24:44] it's a connection
[1:24:46] once you connect
[1:24:48] it's amazing
[1:24:49] how long you could be there without
[1:24:51] knowing how long you've been there how
[1:24:53] many times you talked to a friend on the
[1:24:54] phone says oh i didn't know we were on
[1:24:57] the phone that long
[1:24:58] you've been in there three hours
[1:25:01] in my day that's the way it was my
[1:25:03] buddies we talked on the phone and
[1:25:05] didn't even know we had talked that long
[1:25:07] but see when you're enjoying yourself
[1:25:09] when you're enjoying prayer you could
[1:25:11] pray and pray and pray and
[1:25:13] and and it's in those times god changes
[1:25:16] you
[1:25:17] because once you enter into prayer you
[1:25:19] stop speaking unbelief you start
[1:25:21] beginning to speak faith
[1:25:23] and those are the things that god that
[1:25:25] pleases god
[1:25:27] faith is something that stands in the
[1:25:29] midst of all things
[1:25:30] and like i said it's god's grace to give
[1:25:32] you that
[1:25:34] nobody can give you that
[1:25:36] but god
[1:25:38] you love the lord
[1:25:41] i appreciate your coming i appreciate
[1:25:43] you being here
[1:25:44] i trust somebody has been blessed and
[1:25:46] i try to bring it more clearly i feel
[1:25:48] like i
[1:25:50] it's not as clear as i like to bring it
[1:25:52] but i trust by god's grace he'll give me
[1:25:54] a little more time to
[1:25:58] because that connection did y'all get
[1:26:00] the part about the universe that's so
[1:26:01] important that's really an important
[1:26:03] piece tonight
[1:26:05] because
[1:26:06] he created it that way and when adam was
[1:26:09] in his proper place adam ruled the
[1:26:11] heavens and the earth
[1:26:13] he was connected with god
[1:26:16] and so you got to understand that once
[1:26:18] we this message is to bring us back to
[1:26:20] that connection
[1:26:22] that's why he jesus was able to walk
[1:26:24] through walls
[1:26:26] walk on water
[1:26:28] because they were connected he
[1:26:29] understood that all of this was part
[1:26:33] you know they were all part of
[1:26:35] it's hard to explain it but i do know
[1:26:37] that we're so connected and it was sin
[1:26:39] that brought the breach
[1:26:42] how do you think
[1:26:44] the prophet could tell you
[1:26:46] that one of these old days will travel
[1:26:47] like a thought
[1:26:50] because it's true
[1:26:51] the very thoughts how many times you
[1:26:54] know i know keith different ones we've
[1:26:56] been uh brother richard and
[1:26:58] you and brother isaac sometimes you're
[1:27:01] thinking about a person in the phone
[1:27:03] ring what was that you don't think oh
[1:27:05] that's coincidence that's not
[1:27:07] coincidence
[1:27:08] it's connection
[1:27:10] it's a universal thing that's going on
[1:27:12] beyond this physical body because this
[1:27:14] physical body really is not you
[1:27:16] the inner man is spirit
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:19] right so you got to understand when you
[1:27:21] you and i that's why the bible said take
[1:27:23] this word and meditate on it
[1:27:25] when you meditate on the word of god
[1:27:26] it'll take you to another realm
[1:27:29] a different understanding a greater
[1:27:30] revelation and when you see grace the
[1:27:33] way it is
[1:27:35] you'll never
[1:27:37] have to worry
[1:27:38] about falling into the hands of a cult
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:44] y'all hear what i said
[1:27:45] when you really know grace
[1:27:48] no man ever can ever tell you well if
[1:27:50] you don't belong to this or you don't
[1:27:52] belong to that if you don't belong to
[1:27:53] mine
[1:27:56] because you know what i belong to jesus
[1:27:58] christ
[1:27:59] and him only
[1:28:01] that's what grace did for me
[1:28:03] i'm done
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:41] there is power
[1:28:44] in the name of jesus
[1:28:49] oh there is power
[1:28:53] in the name of jesus
[1:28:58] oh there is power
[1:29:02] in the name of jesus
[1:29:07] to break every chain to break every
[1:29:10] chain to break every change
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:25] there is power
[1:29:28] in the name of jesus
[1:29:33] oh there is power
[1:29:37] in the name of jesus
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:30:04] to
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:18] surprise
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:29] she's
[1:30:30] rising up
[1:30:34] [Music]
