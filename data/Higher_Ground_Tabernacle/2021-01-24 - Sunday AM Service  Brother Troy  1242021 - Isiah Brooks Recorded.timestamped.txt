[42:33] [Music]
[42:39] [Music]
[43:11] we have maybe many things that we enjoy
[43:15] little things here and there that we
[43:16] like to do in this world
[43:18] [Music]
[43:20] it might give us a little bit of joy a
[43:22] little bit of happiness
[43:26] [Music]
[43:39] i think about the uh the names of
[43:41] jehovah that's what our brothers say
[43:46] jehovah is my provider
[43:50] and we enjoy him being our providers
[43:55] [Music]
[44:06] and that was a great thing
[44:10] but there at the end of the old
[44:11] testament
[44:12] [Music]
[44:14] a new revelation was shown
[44:20] revelation of jehovah's
[44:25] [Music]
[44:34] the name of that city will be jehovah
[44:36] sharma you know
[44:36] [Music]
[44:38] the presence of the lord will be there
[44:42] we'll never leave you nor forsake you
[44:45] amen
[44:46] i claim that right now
[45:02] foreign
[45:04] we'll start at the 20th verse
[45:09] now this 33rd chapter of exodus
[45:15] there is a lot in this chapter
[45:34] and he said thou cast not see my face
[45:38] for there shall no man see me and live
[45:45] and the lord said behold there is a
[45:48] place
[45:48] by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[45:56] and it shall come to pass that while my
[45:58] glory passeth by
[46:00] thou put thee in a cliff to the rock and
[46:03] will cover thee with my hand while i
[46:05] pass by
[46:06] my grandpa
[46:12] i'll take away my hand and thou shall
[46:14] see my back parts but my
[46:16] face shall not be seen.
[46:23] let's just spy our heads and word of
[46:24] prayer
[46:26] heavenly father we just approach unto
[46:29] you
[46:31] in all honor and praise
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] giving you the preeminence we just
[46:37] humble ourselves this morning
[46:40] knowing
[46:41] [Music]
[47:08] no strength in our own selves or is this
[47:10] good
[47:12] no other place that we could go to
[47:15] but lord will we come to you father
[47:19] and we hide ourselves in your sight
[47:47] in the name of jesus christ
[47:51] amen i mean amen you can be seated
[47:58] moses here
[48:02] when you're reading in exodus chapter
[48:09] like i said there was a lot going on in
[48:10] this chapter
[48:13] and when you get to when you read in the
[48:15] beginning of the chapter
[48:19] is speaking unto moses
[48:23] and he says i want you to leave here
[48:27] i want you to go up into the place that
[48:29] i'm going to show you
[48:48] your sins have done too much
[48:52] your inequity and all these things have
[48:56] separated me us from you
[49:28] he took the uh the tabernacle
[49:34] that was in the middle of the people
[49:37] and he took it he took it outside of the
[49:39] camp
[49:42] went
[49:57] who was really interested in jehovah
[50:02] and it was at that time where joshua
[50:04] began to show
[50:05] monaco his true nature
[50:11] when he left the the tent or the
[50:13] tabernacle or
[50:14] he left the the city behind it
[50:17] he left all of his people behind they
[50:21] said
[50:21] wherever the tabernacle the lord goes
[50:31] so he left the people behind and went to
[50:33] the tabernacle
[50:37] and there he says wherever that presence
[50:39] is
[50:41] that's where i'm going to be and when
[50:44] jehovah began to tell moses
[50:48] i am not going with you i'm just going
[50:51] to send my angel before you
[51:05] then don't even send me i'm gonna stay
[51:07] right here
[51:09] because laura it's in your presence
[51:12] oh don't just send a messenger lord
[51:16] don't just send an angel to go with us
[51:19] but if your presence does not go with us
[51:23] then we don't even want to go
[51:26] it's a mighty statement let's see we
[51:29] would give up our inheritance
[51:32] we would give everything up
[51:45] and in verse 14 jehovah said it to him
[52:02] we can enjoy the revelations of god
[52:08] we can enjoy the worship of the lord
[52:12] we can enjoy praise in his name
[52:16] and we like
[52:41] and that's what moses was experiencing
[52:43] here is
[53:12] jesus
[53:26] it's a little hiding place
[53:29] and what i'm going to do moses is i'm
[53:32] going to take you i'm going to place you
[53:34] inside this hiding place
[53:38] and if you just place yourself in this
[53:41] hiding place in the side of the rock
[53:45] then i will cause all my glory to pass
[53:47] by thee
[53:49] i will place my hand on top of you
[53:53] and my presence that would kill you
[54:23] we've sickness has come upon us
[54:27] whatever it is maybe we get discouraged
[54:28] in our lives
[54:31] and we just can't heal ourselves
[54:35] we just can't deliver ourselves
[54:39] no matter what happens we just can't
[54:41] forgive ourselves
[54:44] we can't even wash ourselves
[54:47] we get down to a place in our lives
[54:48] where we just need christ
[55:10] it's just like you know like think about
[55:11] the president of the united states
[55:16] no matter how how great you think you
[55:19] are
[55:21] or maybe the president of your company
[55:23] where you work
[55:26] no matter how great you think you are
[55:30] you just get in the presence of these
[55:31] mighty men that are around
[55:44] you just let the president of the nation
[55:46] or the president of your company come
[55:48] back
[55:51] you would begin to feel a little small
[55:55] and that's just a little thing compared
[55:57] to the presence of jehovah
[56:14] where if
[56:26] our prison system has a place called
[56:28] death row
[56:52] but they have a hope in themselves that
[56:54] one day they're gonna get out
[57:10] to death
[57:38] for them to hide
[57:52] if you were to take their story of their
[57:54] sins
[57:57] to practically any person throughout the
[58:00] nation
[58:02] or throughout the world those persons
[58:06] would look at those people's sins
[58:09] and judge them and say you are awake
[58:16] you are deserving of death
[58:21] and if god was to show up at their cell
[58:23] door
[58:27] nervousness
[58:32] when they would begin to see the purity
[58:34] and righteousness of god
[58:38] how righteous god is
[58:41] and how the wickedness of what they had
[58:43] done to god's creatures
[58:48] of how they had
[59:01] who could stand in god's presence
[59:06] but there is a little rock over here
[59:10] over next to jehovah
[59:13] he said there's a little rock by my side
[59:22] there's a little place where the rock
[59:24] was smitten
[59:27] and it's in that smitten rock you can
[59:29] hide yourself this is
[59:37] when god created the heavens and the
[59:39] earth
[59:41] he placed adam and eve there in the
[59:43] garden of eden
[59:57] he was cast out of the heavens
[1:00:01] and he found himself cursed in the earth
[1:00:06] and so he clothed himself in the beast
[1:00:08] of the earth
[1:00:13] and this beast came into the garden of
[1:00:15] eden
[1:00:17] we call him the serpent as he came into
[1:00:20] the garden of eden
[1:00:24] god had his son there jude
[1:00:39] but when god decided to separate
[1:00:43] eve from adam
[1:00:46] that he smoked adam on the side
[1:00:51] and that little it caused a little
[1:00:53] crevice there in the side of adam
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:21] throughout history
[1:01:36] one to the other in a marriage ceremony
[1:01:41] she came out of him
[1:01:44] she will come back to him
[1:01:47] and when she clings to him she'll be
[1:01:50] sick
[1:01:59] i think anybody that any teenager or
[1:02:02] young man young woman
[1:02:16] your parents say feed you they clothe
[1:02:18] you they give
[1:02:31] as you begin to mentally you begin to
[1:02:34] leave your parents behind
[1:02:39] and you begin to look for a mate
[1:02:45] throughout history
[1:03:14] christ was placed upon the cross
[1:03:18] it's the rock that was that was spoken
[1:03:21] of in
[1:03:22] exodus
[1:03:26] it is that roman soldier put that spear
[1:03:42] blood
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:55] blood water and spirits
[1:04:30] you remember the story from matthew
[1:04:32] chapter 25.
[1:04:37] in matthew chapter 25 the there's the
[1:04:39] story of uh
[1:04:46] the man that was planted in the field
[1:04:51] and he went there and he and he built a
[1:04:54] really nice vineyard
[1:04:59] let me tell you there wasn't anything
[1:05:01] more that he could do for that vineyard
[1:05:02] than anybody else could have done
[1:05:08] he created a more beautiful vineyard
[1:05:10] than anybody else ever could have
[1:05:12] created
[1:05:16] a prettier field
[1:05:21] and he went and he sowed his own seed in
[1:05:23] that field
[1:05:27] but then as the parable goes
[1:05:31] that while men slept
[1:06:16] and
[1:06:57] and then i will send my angels
[1:07:12] jesus christ told us he told us to count
[1:07:15] the costs
[1:07:19] if you're ever going to be a christian
[1:07:23] if you're ever going to decide to follow
[1:07:26] christ
[1:07:28] jesus said you must first count the
[1:07:30] costs
[1:07:33] find out what it's going to cost follow
[1:07:35] christ
[1:07:38] and see if you're willing to pay that
[1:07:40] price or not
[1:07:51] you're gonna have to lay down the things
[1:07:52] that you're thinking
[1:08:07] otherwise you're never going to be a
[1:08:08] successful christian
[1:08:12] the most miserable christians i know
[1:08:17] are those that try to stay on the fence
[1:08:22] they want to
[1:08:34] before the presence of the lord begins
[1:08:36] to withdraw himself
[1:08:47] and you can't get yourself into the
[1:08:49] presence of the lord anymore
[1:09:05] of the world he also counted the costs
[1:09:10] he carried the cost of what it would
[1:09:12] cost
[1:09:15] of putting his bride in the earth
[1:09:18] blessing
[1:09:21] of planting his seeds down in the clay
[1:09:24] of the earth
[1:09:28] and just like adam and eve when eve was
[1:09:30] separated from adam
[1:10:10] he said the theme of it was gonna be the
[1:10:12] beast at the beginning
[1:10:28] the same bride that fell at the
[1:10:30] beginning
[1:10:33] she was separated from adam
[1:10:37] but now there is a bride of christ at
[1:10:39] the end time
[1:10:42] she has left the side of christ
[1:10:46] she was separated from jesus christ on
[1:10:49] the cross
[1:10:51] she found herself in the field of the
[1:10:53] earth
[1:10:56] around her is growing the the tears the
[1:10:58] weeds of the world
[1:11:03] men and women that are have given
[1:11:05] themselves over to obese nature
[1:11:20] where the bride of christ is uh trying
[1:11:24] to be
[1:11:24] filled
[1:11:33] but the whole time we're surrounded with
[1:11:35] those that are being filled with the
[1:11:36] evil spirits
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:46] there is a holy spirit that has promised
[1:11:48] to the bride of christ
[1:11:51] and to everyone that rejects the holy
[1:11:54] spirit
[1:11:56] there is an unholy spirit
[1:12:00] to anoint them to accept the beast's
[1:12:02] nature
[1:12:06] but if you once accept that holy spirit
[1:12:11] he will live inside of you
[1:12:14] and cause you to reject that nature of
[1:12:17] the beast
[1:12:21] and to give you an opportunity give that
[1:12:23] an opportunity
[1:12:25] to return back to the site of christ
[1:12:29] when christ was put on the cross
[1:12:34] nailed there in agony
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:13:16] god
[1:13:30] catches the revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:34] she runs back to his side as quick as
[1:13:36] she can
[1:13:40] she catches the revelation of that
[1:13:42] beast's nature inside of her
[1:14:52] except for through the lord jesus christ
[1:15:09] lord place me there
[1:15:12] lord let me hide myself from there
[1:15:16] i used to be inside of him
[1:15:21] but i was pulled out of the side of
[1:15:22] christ
[1:15:50] don't do this and don't do that don't do
[1:15:52] this
[1:15:55] entering into the presence of the lord
[1:15:56] jesus christ
[1:16:00] you know in in his presence there is no
[1:16:02] law
[1:16:03] it is presence there is no uh no rules
[1:16:07] no ordinances we leave those things
[1:16:10] behind
[1:16:12] when we receive the holy ghost why
[1:16:15] because we
[1:16:15] you receive the holy ghost you are
[1:16:18] receiving
[1:16:25] amen the law was given unto us
[1:16:29] to keep us and to hold us
[1:16:46] you are receiving
[1:16:58] you reject him and receive christina
[1:17:02] why because once you experience the
[1:17:05] presence of the lord
[1:17:08] that presence of the lord is something
[1:17:11] that you can never forget
[1:17:26] it causes you to become a fool for
[1:17:41] you don't chase after money or careers
[1:17:44] or different things
[1:17:49] we might all have our little bank
[1:17:51] accounts and our jobs and our careers
[1:17:53] and things
[1:18:10] because we have one goal
[1:18:13] as the bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:18] we have to get into his presence
[1:18:21] moses was given the vision of an of a
[1:18:24] promised land
[1:18:37] and it wouldn't be a land of slavery
[1:19:03] and so i said i'm just going to send my
[1:19:05] messenger to show you the way
[1:19:06] hello
[1:19:13] it's at that time that moses said
[1:19:15] everything's got to stop
[1:19:16] yes everything's got to halt
[1:19:19] we're not going to go one more step lord
[1:19:23] just kill us right out here in the
[1:19:25] wilderness
[1:19:28] because if your presence doesn't go with
[1:19:30] us
[1:19:32] we don't want to go at all
[1:19:35] god was looking for that statement
[1:19:39] sometimes god has to get us into these
[1:19:41] places
[1:19:45] where if we've been dilatory to seek his
[1:19:48] face
[1:20:01] and then all these other things will be
[1:20:03] given unto you
[1:20:06] but it would say if we seek our careers
[1:20:12] we seek our investments our jobs
[1:20:16] we
[1:20:28] where he can leave you behind
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] and let you sit there outside of the
[1:20:36] presence
[1:20:43] until you begin to appreciate
[1:20:48] your husband your creator photo creator
[1:20:54] i think every single one of us
[1:20:57] if we ever found ourselves in a place
[1:21:01] and maybe you're there right now
[1:21:05] where it's been a while since you've
[1:21:07] enjoyed the presence of the lord
[1:21:12] god has his ways
[1:21:15] where he'll withdraw himself
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:20] to see if you really value his presence
[1:21:25] how much do you really value his
[1:21:27] presence
[1:21:30] how much do you really need
[1:21:33] when jehovah began to reveal himself to
[1:21:36] the children of israel
[1:21:39] he kept revealing his names
[1:21:44] you know i think they had nine names of
[1:21:46] jehovah that were revealed unto israel
[1:21:51] the first one is jehovah jiren
[1:21:55] where he said i will be your provider
[1:22:00] if you cling to yourself inside jehovah
[1:22:05] i will provide all of your needs
[1:22:22] i
[1:22:48] i will just be your healer
[1:23:30] that's where we live right now
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:42] that we begin to forget what it's like
[1:23:44] to live in his presence
[1:23:56] when jesus christ came and walked on
[1:23:58] this earth
[1:24:00] there's
[1:24:27] and they say why are you here
[1:24:32] what are you going to do to me
[1:24:35] don't cast me out or
[1:24:38] like in the case of the legion don't
[1:24:42] look at the
[1:25:03] and so god let the the the unclean
[1:25:06] spirits be cast out into the pigs oh
[1:25:09] do you appear
[1:25:22] those unclean spirits are still here
[1:25:26] and they are still afraid of the
[1:25:27] presence of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:32] but i want you to know it says the
[1:25:33] scribes and the pharisees
[1:25:38] were filled with unclean spirits
[1:25:42] but there is no record that those
[1:25:44] unclean spirits ever cried out
[1:25:50] why because they felt comfortable where
[1:25:52] they were
[1:26:06] there is no record that those unclean
[1:26:09] spirits ever cried out
[1:26:13] because they were comfortable there
[1:26:16] they were afraid
[1:26:20] because they knew they weren't going to
[1:26:21] be cast out
[1:26:27] that's the power of the spirits of
[1:26:29] religion
[1:27:27] you ought to run to the lord jesus
[1:27:29] christ as fast as
[1:27:44] but when
[1:28:02] in exodus chapter 33
[1:28:10] verse two y'all
[1:28:16] jehovah is speaking unto moses
[1:28:20] he says and i will send my angel before
[1:28:23] thee
[1:28:27] then verse 3 says unto a land flowing
[1:28:29] with milk and honey
[1:28:34] for i will not go up in the midst of
[1:28:37] thee
[1:28:39] for thou art a stiff-necked
[1:28:54] i don't know what it felt like to be
[1:28:55] moses right there
[1:29:01] it caused moses
[1:29:05] to go take that tabernacle that was in
[1:29:07] the midst of the congregation
[1:29:22] i'm sure the people begin to wonder
[1:29:24] what's going on
[1:29:28] all the tents were surrounding the
[1:29:30] tabernacle there
[1:29:34] everybody's going about their daily
[1:29:36] business
[1:30:06] and they set the tabernacle back up on
[1:30:09] the mountains off on the out on the
[1:30:11] distance
[1:30:15] and as he and as he began to set the
[1:30:18] tabernacle back up on the mountainside
[1:30:20] there
[1:30:24] that's the presence of the lord that
[1:30:27] used to be in the midst of the camp
[1:30:31] now showed up on the outside
[1:31:00] it says and moses took the tabernacle
[1:31:04] he pissed it without the camp
[1:31:08] a far off from the camp i kept the
[1:31:10] distance
[1:31:11] and he called it the tabernacle of the
[1:31:14] congregation
[1:31:30] so those that were seeking the presence
[1:31:32] of the lord
[1:31:34] had to leave the city behind
[1:31:38] and to go out to the mountains
[1:31:44] now look here in verse 8 university and
[1:31:47] it came to pass
[1:31:51] that when moses went out under the
[1:31:52] tabernacle
[1:31:55] all the people rose up
[1:32:08] and it came to pass as moses entered
[1:32:10] into the tabernacle
[1:32:14] the cloudy pillar descended
[1:32:17] it stood at the door of the tabernacle
[1:32:19] and the lord talked unto moses
[1:32:24] and watch what the people's express
[1:32:26] spirit experience
[1:32:27] what the people did
[1:32:31] as soon as they saw the presence of the
[1:32:33] lord outside of the camp
[1:32:37] it says that all the people saw the
[1:32:39] cloudy pillars stand at the tabernacle
[1:32:41] door
[1:32:45] and all the people rose up and worshiped
[1:32:48] it
[1:32:50] every man in his tent door
[1:33:32] the bible says that when he saw the
[1:33:34] presence of the lord leaving the
[1:33:36] uh at that camp outside the door
[1:33:41] that he ran out there and he stood at
[1:33:43] the tabernacle door where the presence
[1:33:45] was
[1:33:46] at the base of the mountain
[1:34:01] and that's when moses went into the
[1:34:03] tabernacle being to speak to
[1:34:05] jehovah
[1:34:12] began to tell jehovah you brought me out
[1:34:16] here
[1:34:28] remember at this time he says i am
[1:34:42] and that's when he got the promise down
[1:34:44] there in verse 14.
[1:34:51] moses in verse 15 he tells jehovah
[1:34:57] if thy presence go not with me
[1:35:04] then carry us
[1:35:08] if you don't go with us
[1:35:12] we don't even want to go one step from
[1:35:14] here
[1:35:18] you know that same thing is reenacting
[1:35:20] itself in every church across the nation
[1:35:38] you see people are supposed to be
[1:35:40] christians
[1:35:53] instead of loving the presence of the
[1:35:55] lord jesus christ
[1:35:57] they'll worship there at their at the
[1:35:59] door of their house
[1:36:02] but they have no testimony of the
[1:36:04] presence of the lord ever being at their
[1:36:06] house
[1:36:21] i can't stand a moment lord without you
[1:36:23] holding my hand
[1:36:26] i can't even walk without you holding my
[1:36:28] hand
[1:36:30] i need the lord every moment every hour
[1:36:35] i you know don't just say oh i i set my
[1:36:38] angel before you
[1:36:41] the lord if your presence is not here
[1:36:44] i cannot even go in a step further
[1:36:47] every single one of us has a duty
[1:36:50] to
[1:37:17] jesus christ
[1:37:45] not my brother not my
[1:38:00] my
[1:38:14] i am the one that needs to find you as
[1:38:16] my provider
[1:38:17] i am the one that needs to discover you
[1:38:19] as my healer
[1:38:21] i am the one that needs the presence of
[1:38:23] jehovah in my life
[1:38:26] all right we've got to come to the place
[1:38:28] where we've grown up long enough
[1:38:32] even my own children they have to come
[1:38:35] to that place
[1:38:36] they've grown up in my household
[1:38:42] well they're going to come
[1:38:57] because christ is coming back soon
[1:39:00] he's going to find out what you've been
[1:39:01] growing in your garden
[1:39:05] whether you are growing the the plants
[1:39:08] of the lord
[1:39:22] love joy peace
[1:39:27] you're in this in this nation we have a
[1:39:31] a plague going across the nation
[1:39:36] of all these hatred men towards their
[1:39:39] brothers
[1:39:43] where all the democrats hate the
[1:39:44] republicans
[1:39:47] and the republicans hate the democrats
[1:39:50] the right wing versus the left-wing
[1:40:06] a lot of the conspiracy theories
[1:40:10] their whole purpose and destiny
[1:40:13] is to bring you into a place of fear and
[1:40:15] hatred
[1:40:18] to challenge your emotions
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:46] but you know there's wickedness in high
[1:40:48] places in jesus
[1:40:50] day and when jesus christ
[1:40:54] washed on the earth he had a right to be
[1:40:57] upset at the roman government
[1:41:01] for the things that the roman government
[1:41:03] was doing upon the jewish nation
[1:41:08] but he spent all of his focus and energy
[1:41:12] was on what was going on in the church
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:34] we have to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:41:37] brother bran i'm set up i don't know why
[1:41:40] they spend all this money on the
[1:41:42] military
[1:41:44] making
[1:41:48] i know a secret weapon
[1:41:57] he says to spend all money to develop
[1:41:59] these secret weapons
[1:42:04] they have a better weapon than the
[1:42:05] russians
[1:42:12] just put me in charge to the military
[1:42:16] let every member of the military be
[1:42:18] filled with the holy ghost
[1:42:21] they said you'd never have to fire
[1:42:23] another bullet
[1:42:26] you wouldn't
[1:42:54] yeah it's a sad
[1:43:35] leave your mother and father
[1:43:50] is
[1:44:04] the archives of the united states
[1:44:07] washington d.c
[1:44:12] thick glass
[1:44:18] it's a piece of paper 240 years ago
[1:44:23] they probably spent millions of dollars
[1:44:25] just building a case to protect it
[1:44:30] one of these days you won't even be able
[1:44:32] to find the ashes
[1:45:17] because it was never the constitution in
[1:45:19] the first place
[1:45:21] it was a spirit of blessing that was
[1:45:24] upon this nation
[1:45:27] but that spirit is lifting
[1:45:31] there's hatred men for their brothers
[1:45:35] you know that hatred has always been
[1:45:36] here
[1:45:39] but it's been given a license to run all
[1:45:42] over the place
[1:45:53] have fervent love one to another
[1:46:07] if it was my servants would fight she
[1:46:10] said
[1:46:17] amen amen
[1:46:21] you know the law has its place
[1:46:25] it exposes the beast's nature inside of
[1:46:28] us
[1:46:30] we read the ten commandments
[1:46:33] when you see those commandments they
[1:46:36] come against you
[1:47:06] so you no longer
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:21] let's turn her to romans chapter 13.
[1:47:25] we gotta leave these things behind
[1:47:30] and find the presence of god ourselves
[1:47:34] romans chapter 13 verse 10.
[1:47:40] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[1:47:45] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[1:47:47] law la murray don't like
[1:47:50] and now knowing the time
[1:47:53] and now it's high time to awake out of
[1:47:56] sleep
[1:47:56] for now our salvation is nearer than
[1:47:59] when we believe
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:13] let's cast off the works of darkness and
[1:48:16] let us put on
[1:48:45] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof
[1:48:51] amen i wish i could tell it to the
[1:48:53] people storming the capitol
[1:48:58] capital but they won't receive it
[1:49:03] it doesn't matter what side of the
[1:49:05] political spectrum you're on right or to
[1:49:07] the left
[1:49:27] where they go the left is going to go
[1:49:30] where they go
[1:49:33] but the bride of christ will be saying
[1:49:35] close to the rock
[1:49:36] place for me lord let me hide myself
[1:49:45] amen amen amen
[1:49:48] let's just stand i remember when
[1:49:57] peter was them and the disciples were
[1:50:00] speaking
[1:50:04] i said something to jesus
[1:50:08] saying should we call down fire out of
[1:50:10] heaven
[1:50:17] remember in a time when elijah
[1:50:21] was surrounded by the enemy's
[1:50:50] and so the disciples were speaking to
[1:50:53] jesus
[1:50:55] i don't remember the exact parable
[1:50:57] [Music]
[1:51:01] of should we call it on fire out of him
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:16] you don't know what spirit is causing
[1:51:18] you to say those
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:26] what we have seen these last few months
[1:51:29] in our nations
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:43] and i've seen many a christian
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:52:01] has already been prophesied the
[1:52:02] direction it's going to go
[1:52:07] yeah we can do our things make our voice
[1:52:11] heard
[1:52:13] but ultimately me
[1:52:17] we have one nation
[1:52:21] and it's a heavenly nation
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:25] we know where this country is
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:53] to rise up sodom and gomorrah and
[1:52:55] apologize to them
[1:53:10] you
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:24] healings
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:52] we're here to cling to christ
[1:53:55] our fighting is on our knees
[1:54:00] our fighting is in the way the spirit
[1:54:02] leads us
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:17] a nation has been promised
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:47] it's a draw from that land right
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:29] like we had never fallen
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:45] and all the foolishness of this world
[1:55:47] will pass away
[1:55:50] but let me tell you we can draw from
[1:55:51] that nation right now
