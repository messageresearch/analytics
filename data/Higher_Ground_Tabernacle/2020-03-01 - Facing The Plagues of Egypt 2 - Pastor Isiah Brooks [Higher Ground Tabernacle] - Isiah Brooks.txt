some about hard I asked you about yeah hmm okay can you sing it okay then I'll work with you later I don't have the courage right now and so you're not by yourself you love the Lord will appreciate God for His goodness we're gonna get right on into the word think off our brethren coming up from Iowa City may the Lord always bless you for your sacrifice may be out the service we're seeing a lot more God is good to us and we like to try to complete our service on what we started Wednesday if the Lord willing this morning we started with the another section of it facing the the plagues of Egypt and we are are doing so I think when we think about the history of diseases I don't think they've ever been an age with so many diseases flowing as they are now and often time we don't even consider that God has kept us but there are so many things out there floating around it's just a miracle that we stand home today and even the ones that did attach themselves to us God has given us victory over them so we thank God for the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ who keeps us amen in a time when I guess we don't deserve to be kept but as we stand let us turn to psalms 95 please psalms 95 one thing I love about the Bible is that it's perfect and if a man had a little bit of intelligence he would conclude that there is no way men could write such a book and be as accurate as they are not even knowing inna each other hundreds of years apart and yet they speak about the same God and you know the devil has been trying to get rid of Jesus Christ ever since before with the foundation amen but there's no way he can get rid of him it doesn't matter how jealous he is and has become of him he is a defeated foe so Psalms 95 we have a we have a pleasure in trusting God because we know that he never fails let us start at the sixth verse oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for ii is our God and we are his people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the day of provocation as in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years long was I agreed with this generation and that thing struck me he said forty years he was greed that means not even one year did they please God after they came out of Egypt forty years because that's where they were forty years think about it he brings them out of Egypt with a mighty hand they saw the pillar fire they saw God open up the sea they saw Pharaoh armed in his a kingdom destroyed and they still get beyond on the other side the greatest the best part of their Exodus is when Miriam takes a tambourine and they dance on the red seashore God in the spirit one time and Moses saying under the inspiration Miriam's song under the inspiration and the Bible said Moses was so inspired he song a new song think about it that even that song that he sang over in Revelation they singing it it's amazing but that's the only good thing you hear from that point on they criticize it they murmuring in their complaining let's go ahead finish it up what was i tenth verse forty years long was I agreed with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways until whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest okay that's how that's how important let's go to Deuteronomy please the eighth chapter you know because I really believe that that's that's been the greatest hindrance of this age we don't know how to keep our mouth shut hey you know it's difficult sometimes when Satan comes and you put thoughts in your head but wisdom is don't let it come out of your mouth because words has power words will create your atmosphere because the devil can't create your atmosphere but you are in the image of God and by opening your mouth you create your atmosphere he uses your ability to curse you because he cannot curse you okay Deuteronomy 8 god is so good to us we all have our battles but thank God for Amazing Grace I was just reading about the prodigal son today it was a yesterday and how the Word of God opens his arms up to us you know brother Branham says no man it's not even easy for a man to go to hell we have to fight our way there thank God for that well I ain't fighting to go there amen let's start at the first verse of 8 of chapter 8 of Deuteronomy all the commandments which I command thee this day shall be observed ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's and thou shalt remember all the days which the LORD thy God led thee 40 years in the wilderness to humbly and to prove thee to know what was in 9 heart whether thou would keep his commandment or no and he humbled thee let me read that again that second verse is what I was speaking of this morning these tests and trials that we're going through is to break your pride and to bring you into a place of humility that's what it's all about he come to test and try you and the Bible said that the Lord chasing those whom he loved so if you're getting a little bit of spanking know that God loves you he's making us he's molding us right and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart where the dog would it keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna now ain't that amazing here he humbled and suffered you to go hungry so that he what can bring you a blessing of manna which dog knoweth not neither did thy father no y'all didn't even know I was doing it did even know that he might make thee know that the man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live the raiment wax not all upon thee neither did that foot swell these forty years now I'm like oh we walked in this wilderness for forty years in a circle they had better shoes than what we got said it even suffered their feet to swell all right thou shalt also consider thine heart that as a man chasing his son so the Lord that God chasing is D therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to fear him for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land see all of this is to bring you into a good land a land of Brooks of waters of fountains and depths that Springs out of valleys and heals a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarce anise now he'll not like anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills now made big grass but thou has eaten all are in art full thou shall bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee and I'm gonna leave off under beware but there's a longer scripture but we thank God for His grace I didn't know whether crystal wanted to give her a testimony do you want to do that you can do it afterwards oh okay so anyway she just wanted to testify was something I didn't I hope it in put you on the spot okay she came in a little late but she was just getting off for work but God is so good to us and I thank God for the reading of the word let us pray father God we come before your Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your amazing grace Father forgive us of our see our shortcomings Lord we're here tonight Lord because we thirst for your righteousness and father you saying to all who thirst for your righteousness they shall be filled Lord I pray if there be any hypocrisy or anything in my life that's not complete with right with you cleanse us Lord remove these things from our spirit in our heart O God that we may serve you in true holiness let your Holy Spirit Lord indwelling us and father we'll be careful to give you the glory honor and praise and Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be seated and as we took our time this morning we're gonna try to do it a little bit this evening but just maybe with a little more space to it but nevertheless you know we talked about the plagues we read you by God's grace some of the things that are taking place I was still looking at the little flippin Internet today on on my phone about how that these biological weapons are formed where they are formed and I was just talking with a brother after service today that that there are some viruses that they have concocted and put together and highbreed it amen if these viruses ever would get loose there is no return in other words they have no vaccine they have nothing that they can do to bring to bring you to a cure because the virus in itself goes beyond what men intend for it to be and I can see God in that you tap into his laboratory you think you're smarter than he is and so therefore he allows you to destroy yourself by your knowledge and man has always been guilty of that we destroy ourselves and that's that's that's the thing you know even though we have been educated which is really good brother branham said education is the greatest enemy of the word why because it teaches us how to reason it teaches us how to process and nothing's wrong with reasoning and processing as long as it's left in its place but when it comes to the Word of God you and I must carry on this word by faith and faith doesn't need to be proven faith is faith in itself will prove itself is that right listen so we understand brother Branham Chael Sonnen tells us that the last plague was death we spoke of that this morning the forth hearth rider was a mixture of all the four amen remember how the first a horse rider came in as a white horse and it looked like looks so innocent and then it comes along at the end of the day it receives the name in the spirit in the church age of Thyatira and that age that name was death itself so it was spiritual death even though in Thyatira it was a natural death as well because that church slaughtered millions of Christians and so spiritually now something is happening and all of this started with one word being misplaced see because you got to realize once you get off the word there is no telling how far is going to spray it out all right it's going to continue in a way Amen that it's it's it's way out on the other side and oftentimes people don't know how to get back but I'll tell you tonight how to get back simple repent a simple word Lord forgive me help me Jesus is that right go look at the prodigal son who was not on elected chosen but was heir and seed of his daddy and he got to a place where he thought amen there was no return something gave him a possibility I love that word a possibility if I go back home there's a possibility my daddy would receive me ah daddy wasn't wasn't wasn't in a notion to reject him daddy was waiting for his repentance and he got to understand that all of us right now amen has as Christians we repent every day I do I ask God to help me to cleanse me every day right and as long as you have this man on your on your back you gonna have trouble the perfection in which we're speaking of is not with the fresh it's the inner man that God is trying to perfect and bring us to a perfection so that when he brings that perfect house to us all we have to do is fill it up y'all know what I mean by that they glorified got bought it at the apne body a man think about it it was death we talked about how that the death of the darkness in that day was so dark they said that the darkness was felt and I don't know whether you've gone through certain cities but I have like New York and in Atlanta Chicago places when you're just driving down the highway and you feel that darkness you're just going through and the darkness and greets you as you come through happy I felt it I've known it but you know we realize Amen that in this darkness God always like I said the other message there's always a light in the darkness God has never left himself without a witness that understand this there's not going to be a great majority in this message that's going to press into the kingdom of God don't expect it because they say oh I follow y'all understand me some time I think people misunderstand me but I'm working with reality look at the multitude of people that Jesus had they believed at a time he was a prophet they saw the miracles but the same people Amen that was believed in him was the same people screaming crucify him and it's like that now the same people some of the same people who saw Malachi 4 in action it's screaming crucify and they don't even believe it anymore well my question is with who you gonna believe my question is the world is falling apart where are you going to run you're going to wait for the spaceship or the spacecraft to be built you don't even have enough money to make it yet understand it's ridiculously silly to think that you can escape the wrath of God by moving to another planet if it was so when the Bible said that heaven and earth shall the Bible said that the whole atmosphere is going to be caught afire where can you hide the only place of hiding is in Christ hallelujah whoo that's what David said he saw it coming hard me in the cliffs of the rock he made into the wrath of God is past he's coming right we showed you in a previous message how that the blood of Jesus Christ surrounds the earth that's why even as sinners God don't just automatically kills us kill us because the blood of Jesus Christ protects even the sinner but once you die and you move out of this dimension and the blood of Jesus Christ is not apply you go straight to hell now that sounds rough but the Bible says that in the book of Revelation that he'll he'll follow death everybody got to die unless you take a rapture everybody goes to the grave which is called I think it's called Gahanna or Haiti how do you want to say it but the lake of fire is the last final death y'all understand me if you spiritually did now if you should die you go where the dirtiest but if you are live spiritually you go where those who are alive are so you can understand and I know you do we understand that God gives everybody a place to repent and all of us every one of us need to know what repentance is repentance means to turn around from the wrong way to the right way it means to do your best forsake all things that are wrong at least confess to God Lord I'm wrong and you're right then when you turn from God God takes over from there there you know what I'm saying now I said it earlier I'll call the revelations to 2123 the Bible said that God gave her space to repent huh of her fornication and she repented not now he's working with a spiritual thing right because we realize amen that hear him in the early church the first thing that they did wrong is they left their first love you know what the probably God used as a first law all-night prayer he used that as an example and with the last that was blousing in in a new jersey of that brother varlyn they had an all-night prayer the first night I got there I was tired and I said but if y'all going I'm going and we had a wonderful time we didn't even get out of there until five o'clock hey man and I told my encourage the church they said if I said this something's gonna happen there's no way you're gonna cry out to God like that and he's not going to answer hmm oh my when God gets serious minds amen serious things are gonna happen I'm not asking you to do all that prayer but I'm telling you I believe every one of us need to increase in our prayer remember amen she gave a space to repent look God always give a space to repent even when it came to how to the need the bright will never showed us where they repented because guess what everybody was blaming somebody else the serpent had no words because Adam said the woman you gave me blaming God and the woman said the serpent and the serpent couldn't say nothing he was like a boy caught with the cookie in his hand he was the one that caused it thank God for the blood of Jesus and then because the blood of Jesus is the reason why all of our sins everything we've ever committed goes back to him to the man who started it I love that now let's go on the thing that I want to say that sometimes and I just gonna sound really rough but sometimes you can go on a church and instead of feeling the Holy Spirit you spew feel a spirit of lust and all you got to do is look around and you'll see how the women are dressed and you see the men behavior and you can see that even the music and everything they were working with is about lust somebody help me and because you see it was a very spirit that tempted me eat was tempted with and fell to one broken word brings you from love to lust hello the spirit of lust is in a lot of churches because they rejected the word he fell to it right and the body goes all this is listen because you did not repent behold I will cast her into a bed and then they commit adultery with her soul him you hear what I'm saying the church is that's why the Bible said Babylon is a cage of every unclean bird ah because she's not worshiping under the love of God she's worshiping on the last because the devil is her Lord they worshipping Satan and don't even know it come on somebody he's the truth that's why I'm trying to tell you that's why the Prophet had everything all right he had a dress it was God not the man but he had everything straight stay with the Lord I will kill her children with death now tell me if I'm shouting I'm dancing I'm worshiping and yet I'm dead I can speak in tongues I can prophesy and yet I'm dead I can have disarmament and yet I'm dead oh yes because there's only one provided praise to Russia and that is under the blood of Jesus and we must move with the pillar of fire the pillar fire Christ was in every church page except this one that's right Laodicea was only one that put him outside the church yes y'all hear him saying so when the when it came to the seven churches I'm coming when it came to the seven churches there was a total blackout total every six of those churches was written down on the wall the other one was black until the Holy Spirit comes in and puts a little light in that church age what was that that was the response of the message message to message to the response to the message from the messenger right now you say well why would you say that because Malachi 4 says he sends us Elijah and Elijah comes to bless some and the curse and when God sent that message you know what he was doing that messenger he stayed the wrath of God you say prove it brother that levers our worker wah-wah-wah when the world should have been blown to bits it would have been but God in his mind had a little bride hello before William Branham ever came to the Pentecostal church they were already corrupted they had already expressed death but you see death could not set in until the world of correction came and when the world of correction came and they refused the word of Correction that's when death set in and so is it with the message because we're just like Israel we come out thinking well oh praise God with special people and oh praise God with special class yes but that special class of people still got that mount up to the word oh yeah God I'm gonna let you just be a special class of people be dirty and in Ranchi in the kind of way you want to be and you go into heaven it ain't happening there's power in the blood of Jesus power we cannot say that God he cannot do it when God has created everything you Lena tell me God can't clean you up God came fill you with the Holy Ghost that is a love that that was lie the Bible tells us that God will to give you the Holy Ghost better more than you only have it words of our prophet you see the thing is it's so simple we jump right over it you already elected if you chosen and elected what do you come for I want my gear hallelujah but the hard part is we don't know how to receive it we take it but if you don't if you take it and don't put it all what good is it gonna do you that's not coming to the door the man gives you the road and you leave it on the hanger that's beautiful robe that robe is not for you to put on the hanger that Rome is for you to put it on you that's the way it is it's so simple and when you put it on you put it on by faith right because this role we'll talk about is invisible it is the Holy Spirit but if you wear it people will see the change oh come on somebody listen so you got to understand we all fall short at times but God always give us time to repeat and this is your time to repent I told the church that this morning this is our time to repent from everything we've ever done wrong is that right even in this message times I thought I was right and I was wrong and you know what I repaired I ask God to forgive me hmm but because my robe got to be white without spot wrinkle up now I don't want nothing on me I want everything done away with and you tell me I can tell you like this the blood of Jesus Christ who is long-suffering he's patient is that all right see that was Satan's last ride riding with death that Oh pale horse and that right oh my but it was a sign it was a it was the evidence that death was striking earth while life was striking the people of God is that right at the time it was darkest when that Death Angel was losing and losing in Egypt and ruling on every beast in cattle and everything can you see it you don't think the death angels right what about all of the animals of the sea cattle dying whales all kind of fish everything is dying hallelujah now man that's death y'all don't see him he's riding everywhere but I it is a time that you and I can make sure that token is applied this is our time to apply the blood the lamb has already been straining a little yeah all we got to do is take him by faith and said oh I'm covered because that angels are standing by you hallelujah he must bring your confession to pass if you think you're selling you'll be a sinner if you believe you're a saint you'll be a saint hallelujah because who gives you the faith to believe that who gives you the faith to believe you bribed and all the people in this message why do you think your bride but you see like I was saying about the mirror face ancestor phase well when you look in there you see your face there's not a good mirror but you know what I'm saying when you trust God and believe God let me say it like this do you think this old flesh is gonna ever change so you can understand it will not and the only thing you can do this this flesh is lock him up in the prison and kill him every day he rises when you rise he sleeps when you sleep come on somebody you know if you didn't have this open ass the flesh on you you'll never have a bad dream it's because you're connected to this and your soul wakes up in like oh my god what happened here some of y'all must not act like I don't know what I'm talking about but it's real anyway he invades your spirit sometimes because of this nasty flesh but your stole your soul will still say God no that's not me that's a trick in a lot of devil that's not me my soul thirsts for righteousness and God said blessed is the man who hunger and thirst after righteousness y'all hear me God don't look at your outward appearance if he had seen if he had looked at that woman at the well he would have dismissed her huh the woman who come in and wash his feet can you imagine how that must have looked a prostitute washing his feet and anointing his feet he was a man but he was dead to all of his senses somebody help me here and while he's old bad thinking Pharisees were over there judging him this lady was making history that's what I'm trying to tell you what all of the people in this message say they fade to worship they afraid to say thank you Jesus they're afraid to testify Bob this stock in his own when God gives you something you give him praise you wash his feet with no one else or wash his feet you let him know how much you appreciate him when the church don't appreciate him then you'll get something from God he is that right the Bible said he dwells in the he habit to hit he habit eights in the praises of man not all right see his bride look deadly tall my savings by remember I told you this morning if you don't get the Holy Ghost Satan will inject himself in you you got to get it ain't no ands ifs or buts about it you got to know that you know that you know listen I'm gonna tell you something so you may know already if there is something in you crying out for righteousness you know what that is that is the Holy Ghost the problem is is that we have allowed Satan to roll some stone or something over our experience and is deforming you remove it remove the unbelief so that you can grow healthy there is no way that you can be a devil and thirst for God to only the children of God thirst for God somebody help me and you got to stop letting the devil put tricks on you like oh you can't be same and you can't be this and you can't be that what are you talking about then what's this hunger huh when it came to the serpent God gave him space to repair is that right Kane if you repaired and he would do it your brother I will let you rule him there was no repentance in his heart he had no respect for God he's sassy God amen am I my brother's keeper a true believer don't do that a true believer home of themselves right like Mary when Jesus when they saw Jesus she couldn't read them out Lord me you know I laughter than my brother we fed you and we let you stay with us and you let him die no she knew who he was and she humbled herself and said lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died she knew the right approach hmm those are just illustrations but can I say this in my day and I'm whole Southern Baptist born in that time my mother raised me as a Baptist and the Baptist had no holiness then we have now then you know Catholic Church Catholic girls used to wear long skirts oh yeah they even thought it was a shame for a woman to wear pants Catholics I know what I'm talking about because I was told I seen it I witness it alright so let me go on to say without one I need to say in my day when a woman who was a ill-fame woman you know what she did to note that she wore makeup everybody in the neighborhood knew what she was up to just by the paint on her face now everybody's wearing paint and the people who don't wear it there they are balls but you must understand this is unde ultras generation everybody in that generation is gonna wear the paint because they are influenced by an ill annette a prostitute's period am I making sense so when our sisters began to put on makeup there is a pool coming from hell directly from him and they think it ain't gonna matter yes it will one word broken you'll never confront God with makeup on somebody help me here now let me go on another thing about makeup was it was what the funeral home would use when you was in the coffin Oh God they wanted to make you up so that you could look alive is that true it's the truth hello I love sister Karen I went to her mom's funeral down there and her mom what I don't think I was seen with makeup on I'm not sure but when they did the coffin that was one thing she said don't put any makeup on my mom cuz I know she wouldn't want any on her it was the first time I had seen an unsaved woman I would open or forgive me I won't call her that that's not what she was saying but y'all know what I'm saying a dead person with no makeup can you make sure if something should happen me no makeup it god yeah could they do it on me into y'all didn't know that oh they do but you know the thing is amen it was a deadly look it is dead it was then and it is now y'all see what I'm saying what I'm saying is there was a time that the old Pentecostal churches would never put makeup on now they doing it there's a time they would never pierce their ears and all that they doing it now it's all but not the message yes those even those who claim to be messages you know what they calling it full grace they wear any earrings and everything yeah you don't know that it's true let me move on I don't even know how I got that but anyway let me go on by God's grace the fourth seal thank you brother separation from God is death eternal death see this is called death so keep away from him what is he an organization or organizational system why did he say just organization but he said not only just an organization but our organization system y'all hear what I'm saying this is what I'm trying to tell you we have come along with this message and it has developed our organizational system even though it's not an organization hello just to bring it out clearly here I got a picture here here I got a picture here in the cross in the middle like a McDonald's sign I'm keeping my pictures up now but my point is that does not make me message you understand me these things that it's not it's not tough it necessary that don't bring the Holy Ghost in here you see them saying you know we get it to church tulip to the fact if this church is over here singing a certain kind of song we need to sing it ah where did we become organized like that what declare you as a message church not by a sign out there Malachi falling all that like all you see the only the other churches is Baptist Methodist Presbyterian that's not it you defined the church you the message when the message is being lived in you you are the message Church no you not that you are the temple of God worship should be in here all the time people get mad with me because I'm saying these things but I'm trying to get us out of this systemic thing we're so systemic like the private God said he said one thing for certain you ought to get out of out of out of order in order at least get the Holy Ghost someone's afraid even go over thirty minutes or thirty five minutes no if the Holy Spirit is moving you don't have to stop the thing is we must give the world preeminence don't drag it on door is a if the Holy Spirit is not moving in that way go ahead home and let the word come up but my point is we come here to worship and we come here to be used by God I think what people misunderstood brother branham because he knew how sometimes fanatics can get over take the service he understood order but if you listen to brother Branham and you hear him today some things at times why would he say something you all the least get out of order long enough huh to get the Holy Ghost hmm and that's the problem you know the Holy Spirit is moving people on the altar amen and people said well it's time to go I've seen it happen right so you and I must understand by God's grace that's not what God intended for us to do they that are led by the Spirit they are the sons of God good to see you sister my wife we just talked about you God is good to us amen listen st. John 65 57 58 he says as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dead he that eateth this bread shall live for ever and y'all believe that what is the bread it is not only just the Bible but it's the message of the hour it's revealing of what God has done in this day for you he said do you believe it you know what eating it means to digest it because you can eat and bring it back up that's what Israel did with the meat y'all hear me didn't give it time to digest but if you eat this bread and let it digest he said you will live forever God and people struggling this study now as a question don't mean to be long yeah all the time why what was the purpose of malachi for what did he do we understand he was more than a prophet you understand the man didn't make himself that that pillar of fire came over his head when he was a baby he was elected and chosen to be that I believe if he could get out of her he would have he didn't want to be a preacher in the beginning I like it this way let me say like this his his ministry stayed the wrath of God held it back because of you and me who stayed it because at the time that he came I listened to him the other day and he was someone he was just about 33 years into his ministry and I think that was in 63 and 65 God took him off the scene almost the same time the Prophet I mean Jesus lived and God comes along and what did Jesus do Jesus stayed there at the hand of God but when they rejected him guess what happened he told them now you rejected me but let me tell you of a little parable he said Jerusalem will be surrounded by armies and they're gonna tread down the walls and many shall be killed he said but if you go out into the mountains he said don't come back go up in the hilltop don't come back when you see these things happening oh my goodness people don't you see what's happening to us the enemy is surrounding us it's time to go up to the mountain and not look back and everybody that heard the voice of Jesus according to or - what was that that great tough I can't take good thing now anyway he said he said he said only those who heard the voice of Jesus escaped the wrath of Titus hmm and here we are I'm almost almost as pleasure oh I'm trying to get to you and I must understand that when when these things start happening about the seals and that's why the devil is fighting them so much they don't want people to believe that that cloud was real and really happened and you foolish if you believe that and and secondly you know here the man prophesy way before this day ever happened so what did he do use a cell of felt cell phone and says hey it's about time for me to this thing to come to pass so I won't user since some Rockets up there and let them make some things go up there and I'm going to declare as Christ nonsense no prophesy is going to rain a hundred twenty years before it rain and those who disbelieve perished you understand me this man prophesied about seven ages coming how would he know God told him hallelujah listen when I say he stayed the wrath of God because he was he'd meant with those brothers out there hunting or whatever they were doing and the Lord told him to throw up these rocks God had even tell him what what he was doing he looked for obedience obedience came a world we informed cut the rocks out of the mountains pyramids rocks was everyone everywhere like I told you I had one and a brother a precious brother of mine took it and never gave it back now what do you call that anyway and he said when it went up they said what is it I said judgement is striking the west coast hmm and you got to understand all of these things took place to do what he said second day from here Alaska almost sunk and he said that thing kept moving now if it's on the west coast it can't move nowhere else but East back to easy that right that's why you see a lot of floods that's why you see all of the pestilence you see our locusts and floods and earthquakes you see that's why the Bible says all of these things in diverse places because Georgia business going over there and listen it has gold around that's why Alaska had an earthquake not long ago right where is it now he said when that serpent began to wag his tail and what's happening now the serpent is wagging his tail I think it's in the fifth seal of the sixth seal I might have the two mixed up but he brother branham talks about the rapture and the great earthquake happening simultaneously around the same time how close are we then how close he was well there's going to be a woman president brother Brown who said when Kennedy was put in the office that was full filled and we it makes there be a woman but look in your fifth or sixth seal he'll tell you it's in there I stumbled across I said oh my god we've been looking all these years for the reveal and that's what people are waiting for to fulfill like like John the Baptist it came and you knew it not it's that the truth you said what do you mean brother most think about it how these people how the church the Catholic Church is ruling the world right now every politician bowels to her well and you think I'm crazy and all of that is mixed up into the Illuminati then let's say that were too much y'all don't even believe it but it's real it's real one thing about those people at least they know who they worship him we got Christians who don't even know who they worship hmm like I said even this morning if you're not connected who are you worshiping you gonna experience Amen what is it artificial if you're not connected you must be connected to God hallelujah is that right let me read on one more he says all science to Tucson yet they're writing pieces and putting in the papers way back over there on Mount Lemmon then big cameras didn't see it rising up from there was standing drifting on toward the west showing all the time it's over I can't go up back but a little piece there it is is the West Coast judgment struck just on the very way it went he going right up over Phoenix and Canadian on earthquake no well how can they can't deny the earthquake and want to deny the cloud God fixed it just that way so let me break it down to you a prophet God can do whatever he wants to do with a prophet Ezekiel said I was caught up in the heavens about my head the hairs of my egg you believe that and I try to tell people if you can't believe what God did in this day you just throw your whole Bible away because everything that God says in this book must come by faith hmm how you know Moses wrote those books huh by faith you believe it Moses one day a new creation God took him there y'all see are you crazy I'm telling you listen to the prophet of God when he start talking about creation he's there he can see it you're not spiritual enough to pick it up are you but the point is he wasn't just a lid that was God in here I'm not exerting to him I'm just trying to tell you his position gave him opportunity to see things and know things that we we did you didn't can't see and know now let me say it like this here was Philip not even a prophet but Philip was ever enviable why do you think brother Bentham showed you that he was a valley and a revival Amen preacher whatever he was doing and God called him up into the desert to meet a eunuch and somebody says oh until it gets the oil praise God I want to tell you what happened to me the other day said I was out there with the eunuch and I got a tire chance ain't meant to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus and one brother said you know wait a minute wait a minute that can't be true because I talked to you right here at that meeting do you realize how far that is you're talking about there is no way that you could leave this meeting and go there huh that's what they said where the proper guard wasn't there when the crowd showed up yes he was if he said he was he was well let's put it this way I'm stupid enough to believe it I believe in translation and I believe that if the if the world come down on me hard enough interview in that time we'll be able to be translated I believe if a crowd crowds me up Amen I have the ability to walk through the crowd and they won't be able to touch me BA because the same Jesus that walked on the face of the earth now is living in us u leik - this thing is perfected when God is finished with the work when God strike this masterpiece holiday the world has never seen it like this before it'll be a short quick work and you don't have to worry about it people let me ask you about something let me ask you something when you was in your mother's womb were you worried please answer that question anybody worry was nobody in your mind you didn't even know what worry was now you in Christ you're bathing Christ what are you worried about daddy got it mama got it whenever you need something mama was supplying God has it it's a supplier he's gonna fix it you just rest and enjoy Jesus oh lord help me Lord let me let me do this and then we get going into communion I've not done but we'll just have to finish it with no stun does when when the seer this is why I say if you take away the cloud to take away the thunders you take away the Angels I can see the angels I've seen the image of it I've seen faces in that cloud now how did they do that you know I don't fully understand it but I know something other than brother Brandon was caught up is that right so let me say it like this whatever it means it's there and one of these old days we're going to be caught up to hmm right oh he said Peter don't you worry about it your disciples don't you watch what you're looking at big AZ he said in like manner I'm coming again do you believe the scripture absolutely in the fourth seal the return of the bride see what people understand that's why you're battling right now you've got to fight people because your victory your overcomer coming what is what puts you in the bride's army hallelujah see many a calm a few were chosen don't you be willing to get up you might be hurting get up don't stay where you are you got it you got you got to perform this is your time of performance don't be looking at what else Sampson he took the gates of Gaza it ain't Sampson time no more is your time Moses has done this day that rule is on the bride that's what I'm trying to tell people I say if the move is on the bride where she's moving right she ain't standing still something is moving that means she's alive those with him are all on white horses yeah y'all remember when women Joseph hammer came and preached hard never forget it that was a vision I had and I was there those with him are only on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world so when the devil tried to push some phone you say hold up now I'm gonna take you to a scripture I was chosen before the foundation of the world understand this where you do whether you see it or not God purposes not only for me to be washed in the blood of the Lamb but to be completely full of His Holy Ghost I'm chosen you gotta believe that you should old brother looks how can you be chosen well let me ask you a question how could Samson be chosen Samson made a lot of mistakes he's messed up real bad hello women out the women out the woman huh yeah he was still gods right chosen before the family of the world amen and they all faithful to the word Amen I like that call chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right alone coming down to meet him they know the Thunder will issue that thing for us get pretty soon hmm now you say well will you say if the thunders wait see that's what people understand when those seals were broken things changed because the Bible says time will be no more if I could put it this way there was a rip in time-space where now the bride of Jesus Christ can go direct line ain't no such thing as party line over here y'all know the party line is anybody in my day we had those old phones and the party line and you had an operator and everybody came through that one line or whatever and you can hear everybody doing anything talking on the phone it wasn't none private you can hear somebody and faintly cuz they guess they could only connect a few up at a time and you could hear they're talking right Suzie is that you over there but my point is then it became how many guys know where the phone booth is in my day we had a phone booth we had no idea we didn't know we didn't know only Jeff Jeff The Jeffersons had these these cell phones and that was a cartoon but in hongdae we had to walk to the block every neighborhood had a cell phone I mean our booth maybe some is it big enough they had to it all depends on how much we got a visitor's street walks and you're going there and you had to dial those rotators right don't mess up on one number that means you got to read out about a healthy y'all don't I'm saying everything was moving slow in the first cellphone was bigger than this and you wore it on your back you had a little little something there and then when you said it in your car man you was there you're there yeah hear what I'm saying everything speeding up there's no time for us to slow down in that sense y'all know what I'm saying everything is moving moving moving this is the astronaut age and God wants to see I cannot let him down people I can't let him down he's counting on us I will not let him down I don't care if nobody else believed this message I can't let him down I will not they gotta lose my mind trying I will not ooh in closing he said look what is coming in - what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle and that's where we are we are just at the beginning if I could put it this way because when one Satan is loosed and he become the Beast will not look we won't be here we would have been raptured but our rapturing is not all it ain't finished we gotta come back cuz y'all know that after three and a half years with him we come back riding on white horses for what that find the end of the Armageddon walk war he you gotta you gotta be a good soldier put on the whole armor god there's ain't no time to faint I know we think we got a lot of time no you don't I thought I had a lot of time and when I got save I thought surely the Lord is soon to come I thought it was bad this is worse it's moved from bad to worse and you don't wanted to get too much is it were sir you don't want it to get more worse right but it will a man let me go on he said the first thing in heaven was about don't you understand you fought with him being that's why you fighting now and those of us who hate unrighteousness what makes you hate unrighteousness what upsets you when you see a true believer supposedly doing what's not right something on the inside amen makes you hate it and you may not even be doing as much as right as you should be but it makes you different because you've not finding pleasure in it it is a beautiful thing to be eight to feel bad when you do wrong it's good to have a conscience something to check you every time you make a mistake that's good that's God it proves that you're not a serpent cuz serpents had they don't care they don't care but when you care there's some element in you that makes you care am I wrong that's the word then see what he did he polluted Eden because the battle started in heaven what I'm trying to tell you is this you and I must understand everybody that claim and I'm not here judging nobody all I'm trying to tell you is that you make sure you got the goods you make sure you know who you are and you keep fighting because somebody else might fall on your on your left and fall on your right but you know you set your face like a flint set your face like a flint don't let nobody move you it's too late it's too late in the evening alright okay this is the last quote I'm coming and now from the battle in the heavens it's coming to the battle on earth and it is to be finished at on earth at the end time in a battle call Armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven holy and so they kicked him out Michael in his angel overthrew him was run out and when they did drop right down the eden and here it started to battle down here you understand me so you and I must understand we have been selected and chosen by God amen we are the ones riding with Micah when Jesus come and cracked the sky we're riding with him to do what the very same thing we did in the beginning we kicked him out of heaven we'll kick him out earth and throw him in the lake of fire that's who we are we stood with him dead he's standing with us now he's never lost a soldier think about it every time Israel was in the Word of God they never lost a battle it was only when sin was found in the camp Lester I'm not done but we'll finish am i making sense god is so good to us I'm having faith in what I'm preaching because this is a little mind of mine can't even believe why he would even hide he would put up with me I have nothing to offer him I can't show all the Lord I did this did that did this did that I have nothing there's no good in me outside of Christ I don't even that's one of those things I'm asking when I get up there if the Lord would have me how did you do it I was telling the brother the other day I said here we can't even put up with each other and God got trillions of people I guess I don't know the number of people on earth and he has to deal with and everybody have their issues can you imagine attitudes that many flowing at one time like a river and I'll see all of them and he deals with all of them he doesn't get impatient he doesn't become anxious he is eternal he works with us all and listen the Bible said God has not dealt with us according to our iniquities thank God he hasn't I raised my hand because I'm glad that God is not dealt with me according to my iniquities but God has had mercy on me from the time I was born up until now and he will always have mercy on me his mercy is great why I stand here I even questioned many times lord why am i preacher how if this happened there is no good thing in me and yet he's chosen me to be bride I believe that with all my heart and I just believed by God's grace that I have been ordained to make a rapture I believe I'll be alive when he comes but if he chooses to put me to sleep that's okay I'm coming up cuz you know why when I die don't go down I go up so you know we look at these things and we said Lord worry what are we doing all I'm saying to the people of God in these last few messages and they're people who actually tap into the services from South Carolina other places you don't know about but these people are really enjoying the word or sometimes I question what's happening here it's not me I don't it depends on you know it's all God my thing is we're at the end time I don't know what's gonna make us hear it really where it strike us it's like somebody said the house is on fire the house is on fire and you sitting in your leis that boy said oh is it I don't smell no smoke but by the time you smell smell smoke is too late because you're trapped by the fire the alarm goes off here's a that thing has malfunctioned many times that's like crying wolf but you know what you should never take those alarms for granted probably God talked about this man who struck gold had all that gold and he had his pet dog and he said oh my the dog was just barking barking barking why because there was a thief in the area see that's what people understand the Holy Ghost will always sound the alarm it's up to us to respond to it right the dog kept barking barking barking and it got so much on that - nerve he shot the dog said you know what I don't need you anymore anyway because in the Mahr I'll be a rich man didn't even know the dog was his best friend not like in the Holy Ghost as a dog but the Holy Ghost is your best friend he's the one that will always warn you of danger is up to you to go into it or stay out of it however because he killed a dog and that's what happens sometimes we shut the conscience down when you know you're wrong instead of making right you shut it down and that's the dangerous thing to do because he's warning you trying to keep you from hell's fire all of us are guilty at times but that night the thief broke in and killed the man robbed him of all his gold and that's just like the devil he'll break in kill you and rob you of your inheritance people of God let's be watchful unto prayer when we see one another coming short and falling let's not criticize that's help one another like a real army right a real army I'll not leave one behind that's what Moses said I ain't leaving not one hood all my animals coming to yeah he's your brother boys what are you saying I'm saying I'm saying like this when I get to heaven wherever brother branham's horse and dog was mine's gonna be up there too I believe that her name is lady that's her name she's going on now as we seen God healed her from cancerous tumors and if God can care for a dog and heal them what about us the Bible says oh like the sparrows oh yeah I what you worried about what you're fretting about our feet a little sparrows I'm the one that closed the fields the lilies and everything else I I do that and you mutt you worth more than that to me why should we worry cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you I'm gonna have my daughter come if she wants dear testify oh whatever y'all just stand there it won't be long God is so good to us [Music] on yesterday he did that so I just want to give praise and thanks to God for actually is my prayer so thank you some of us don't understand but it's a major I guess she just didn't put everything in words but it's a great victory for her because when you see God move you see God is on your side that makes the world of a difference it gives you faith right so we we we just want to thank God for His grace and His mercy a lot of my children are going through some great trials I'm not fretting you know why I prayed and I know that God is gonna answer all my prayers God told me he gave me all of them and all of them are gonna be there I don't care what it looks like I am NOT trying to do the mathematical equation God has already worked it out and so that's what I want to encourage you keep all of us to do that let God work it out I'm gonna go now and and prepare for the communion service my brother Troy would come and whoever want to get brother Frank yeah Troy will help me with the Communion Frank was seen [Music] [Music] [Music] where the saints of God the fade he invites his chosen people the many died we've even aji does feed and supplies our every need all the street to sup with Jesus all the time come inside the master Kohli commander you may feast and Jesus table all the time you the multitude turn the water into one to the whole recall is now same the course again o come in nine the master call it y you may to the hall we [Music] appreciate everybody here tonight amen those of us who are going to do communion we're just gonna read the scripture here first and then those who are participating you can come up in circle as we normally do how many are being blessed by the word I know it's really helping me I tell you what after a while we're gonna have some people in here with a complete sealing of the Holy Spirit and when I say that I mean manifestation of it and the devil is all he know he's getting nervous you know he's gotta be right he's got every right to be nervous but I'm so happy that I didn't have to as a baby you know what I'm saying as a baby I oh oh I wish I could grow up to be a man it was in my DNA all I had to do was continue to feed eat rest the normal things right and I just grew out and grew up and grew out and grew up now here I stand you understand me that's the way the word works sometimes you've grown two or three inches in Christ and you don't even know it until somebody say something man you growing they might not even say it to you but they say to somebody else you know that brother has come a mighty long way what is that that's somebody seeing Christ in you I'm maturing something happening that they knew and they know they once saw you here and they see you in a different place you know it's not always visible because everybody ain't running around raising the dead opening the eyes of the blind only a choice people are able to do that those whom God chooses that's why he said if you are house but I feel good when if your janitor be a good one their holiness be wherever you are the greatest miracle of this message is you being full them into the image and likeness of God God's new creation anyway we'll start from the 23rd verse or the 11th chapter of Corinthians first Corinthians if I received of the Lord that which also are delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep I'm just gonna pause and that's where a lot of people don't understand how because of this they they don't grow you can't treat the body of Christ anyway you must respect one another as brothers and sisters in Christ if you want to grow in Christ and not be sick spiritually or in naturally for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he may not be not together excuse me that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest I was said in order when I come amen to be like G to be [Music] on earth I know to be like all through larger farmer to glory I only had to be like Lord as we come before your Lord we break the bread in your honor Lord we pray father God that you bless this service in a special way there's healing in the cup Lord and we believe Lord Jesus as we break this in memory of you what you did for us what you've already done we know Lord Jesus that you would bless us in return father we thank you right now we sanctify the bread in Hawaii unto your purpose in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] to be like Jesus to be like Jesus to be like Jesus owner the to be like all do live church [Applause] Farmar to glory high only to be like to love like Jesus to love like Jesus to love like Jesus on earth I love to love like is [Applause] all through life journey from her to glory I only love like him and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me let us eat after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this tui
