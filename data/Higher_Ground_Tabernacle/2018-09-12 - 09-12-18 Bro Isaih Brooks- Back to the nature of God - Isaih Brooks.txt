========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] toldja that's my victory song amen without a handkerchief again tonight no I don't have one that's right you love the Lord we appreciate God in His grace [Music] quite unusual when you behind the church where there's more men than women appreciate our sister valonda how faithful so say there my wife is at home feeling a little under the weather she's been very busy today and you know when school comes in how people what they do and how they do but we thank God for those of you who have come to the house of God we have a precious brothers with us tonight and some of you know him from the last time i brother richard lee from georgetown guyana he will be ministering for us on Sunday by God's grace there are issues that I need to go down to Iowa City correct I know just a lot of things happening people and I know that I've have been gone a lot and I appreciate your patience with me but in due time God will have it all straightened out by God's grace we love you because you love us we're gonna love you even if you don't love us but we really do think you appreciate our brother coming if he would mind just greet us would you please brother I will be back for sudden the evening service we will have communion this time I won't forget the bread a very good friend of mine we've met many years ago and you know I really appreciate the friendship in the Word of God and it's not just based upon friendship but it's based upon the revelation of the word amen many times I said that you know it's good to have friends and I don't like to lose friends but if you have to lose friend because of the revelation of the word it's a friend worthwhile losing amen because we come to realize that there's so much of compromise that is going on you know sometimes people want you to be negative as a believer but God is never never negative in God the Word of God has a standard yeah understanded is his word Haman I'm so happy and thankful that you know there may not be many who will stand on the word but the Bible tells us or true the Prophet any man stand for God stands alone and we truly thank God for grace that he says you know I will build my church and the gates of hell sorry not you fail again see this is not a man's thing but it is come to realize that when God gives you a pasta minister it must be by a revelation yeah because you must know who your pasta is you must know where you ought to be fellowshipping because if you you will be in a place and you'll never grow it doesn't matter what happened but with the revelation of who you are who your past is and where you ought to be then you can put your full support in fellowship on in prayer and then you can because God is a God of harmony and that is what he wants us to the common I'm so happy and thankful just passing this way I was telling but I don't know when again I be passing here because you know to come here you need to get a visa and then it will be expiring you know in a while from now but anyway we have a greater meeting and that's the meeting in the air by the grace of God we will continue this great fellowship because you know the Bible says that nothing can separate us see and when we say us many time be so selfish a lot but us we are all God's children he said nothing can separate us if you're a God's people and we are all share of God together we are all in the economy of God amen his mindedness and just our selfishness and we better realize that it's God's family and nothing can separate us from the love of God and I want to tell you I love you all and you're always part of my life in prayer and in support by the grace of God and let us continue to serve God and I would enjoy being here for the few days of fellowship God richly bless you amen God is so good to us we're just gonna go right into the Word of God I love that music brother I didn't know whether you were gonna be here Wednesday Oh Lord let him be here this evening I appreciate your sacrifice he's in school so I know how things can change in a moment's time but we think are for everybody by God's grace and you know we've been talking about the nature of God is this thing on okay we've been talking about the nature of God and we still want to talk a little bit more about it because I believe God has given me a little more understanding a little more revelation so we're gonna chew on this for a little bit until God says we finish we want to get all the nutrients out of it as much as possible and so we thank God for His goodness and His grace and brotherly coming with us seated we weren't expecting him so soon we knew he was coming amen it's kind of like you know Christ it comes when you least expect him you know time shortens amen so we thank God for him and especially he has so many places he could have gone but God laid his heart laid us on his heart so come in expectation this coming Sunday brother while I'm thinking about it brother Colley do you have do you have a prayer cloth okay I have one in my pocket I was just wondering but we still want to pray for you after service if it's okay when service is done brothers has some issues but I know God is more than abling and we really want to join in faith and prayer with him that God give him total deliverance amen he may have come and gotten prayer before but I believe I can I can empathize with him on some things amen so I just know by God's grace amen the Lord is in this place you said well brother Brooks I don't see him well I don't know what you're looking at but I see him and I see him in you and if we miss seeing God in each other we miss God it's that right that's right hey man so as we stand on this turn amen glad to see our brother Keith he was telling me he didn't know exactly when he was going to be able to come in but we think God for amen I was always good to see every one of you see our brother physically able the Lord touched him and I remember the voicemail that he was saying he wouldn't be here because of you know he wasn't feeling well and so anyway we're just glad to see everybody uh you know there's a time when when the people wouldn't show up I would literally I would just get so discouraged but you know what I don't have that in me now you know I don't you know because I realized I mean that's that's the way it's got to be you know brother branham even tells us that before it's all over he said it might be a handful you know and I'm trusting that that if there is a handful we are that handful that will make a rapture there are so many people who are not taking rapture and not thinking that's what we've been called for we have been called to divide defied nature gravity and and every man-made thing that would try to hinder us from being what God would have us to be but we have an assurance in the word and that insurance is that he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it as we stand let us turn to Matthew 12 we're going to read the 33rd and 34th verse then we'll ask you to turn with us to John 17 Matthew 12:33 234 and it says either make the tree good and it's fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit old generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh st. John 17 st. John 17 we're going to start reading from the 22nd verse to the 24th and then from there we'll go to 1st John 4 st. John 17:20 2nd verse and the glory which dog gave me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I and them thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has set me and has loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory with thou has given me but thou loveth me before the foundation of the world first John 4 beginning at the seventeenth verse st. John 4 beginning at the 17th verse herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace thank you for this time Lord God that you have given us O God to worship and to praise you and to thank you for everything that you have done and is doing for us Lord God there are no words and to to express in the English language how much we love and appreciate you but outside of these words we we want a life the life the only life your life o God to live in us O God we want to be living epistles written and read even as you have later laid it out in the word may the Word of God quicken us Lord to live the spoken word help us now as we commit the service into your hands father we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated remember I think the last time we spoke we talked about the natures of God we showed by God's grace how that God nature is not only like a dove but it's also like a lamb it's its nature as pure it's clean as a dove and meek and humble like a lamb and we showed you by God's grace that when we were born we brother branham even call eve the tree of knowledge of good and evil there was a time where she was life but because she ate up all of that tree she became the tree of knowledge of good and evil in other words brother Adam says she's now the tree of death and we realized by God's grace because she is the tree of death we have been transformed if you want to say it our hybrid ate it into a tree that it's good and evil and Jesus when he was talking there in Matthew he says now that that will not do anymore you either make the tree good or you make the tree evil and and you know I me and you there's no way of making the tree good nothing that we can do to make the tree good you see the only thing that could ever make this tree good is that there be a seed that's good on the inside right it must be a God seed only inside that would literally change this kokuboro amen into wheat because brother branham tells us that we came into this world as a kookabura amen we a child of wrath with the appearance of the children of wrath but he said on the inside of the inside there was a wheat germ it is only because of that wheat germ you and I can be changed into something we call wheat is that right now you must understand that that seed in itself Amen was predestinated it was so before the foundation of the world is that right so we must realize Amen that because of the seed we can never be an organization we can never follow Creed's we can never follow dogmas because we are the producers of the life of God because of the seed that's in you right it's not you that produces the life it's not you that produces the change is to see that's in you and understand we are obligated to make sure that the seed is quickened right sometime for the man say sometimes it takes a child of God a long time before he realized that he is a son or daughter of God nevertheless it is still in the hands of the Lord amen to do what he will with us now we talk about circumstances and sometimes circumstances sometimes they seeing are quite difficult for us but understand the scripture says that all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord those who are called according to his purpose in other words God's promise will have preeminence over everything you go through in life his purpose will be done right so whatever God has determined his purpose will become will be all always will be victorious is that right and you and I must understand that we are called and we are chosen if we are elected it is really a win-win situation but you must understand that there are always something that you and I must do God can't repent for you you must repent right and when it comes to to being sanctified God it's not going to make it happen he's given you the power to be sanctified and that is the blood of Jesus Christ in other words he gave you the vacuum cleaner his it's up to you to cut it on and get the dirt up right the vacuum cleaners stand right there it's plugged up to the power but if you don't turn the switch on its of no value to you that's how it is with the Holy Ghost though you may have it is of no value to you if you don't put it to use right now listen this is what he says Israel in the church he says no I never said that he said look a grain of wheat can only produce wheat it cannot produce kokuboro there's no desire in it there's no light in it to produce kokuboro with and if we're in Christ Jesus he said don't be deceived you had better searched is closed now she keep on saying well I don't it don't condemn me to do this and it don't condemn me to do that things of the world he says now I'm going to hurt you a little bit pull the feathers back the other way but it is this one short evidence you have never been to Christ you've never been born again if things of the world doesn't continue he's basically saying check yourself because if they don't condemn you you haven't been born again understand this God does not look at you as as oh I think I'm going to seal this person every age before the Holy Ghost came to minister to that age the cedar was already there in other words God purpose for rand-new before you came here God is waiting on you oh come on somebody see you must understand on the each seal the first a second whatever or each church age you must understand they only need the dogs who were ordained to be saved under those Church ages were saved before they got here everybody that sealed in the seven churches or what we call the bride age you were sealed before you got here but it's up to you to get there in other words you said what about Mary Mary was always in the scripture Mary had the baby Jesus before she got here in the mind of God she had already done it but you see Mary didn't know who she was so God had to bring forth some circumstances in her life that perhaps uncomfortable to her like God will do did you some of us will we we want to sin us and we did what we wanted to do and then God brought some unwanted circumstances in your life that causes you to look up right so let me say it like this when we talk about and I was saying this just the other day I said we talk about people that's really born again let's use the animals when a cow is born it's a calf and guess what that camp does it goes straight to the place where it was going there's no teacher there's no preacher there is nothing to tell that calf go to mama cuz that's where the strengths lie only but it is ordained as something in it that makes it run amen to the place of safety and in life a horse the same way no education nothing there to tell it other than that god-given instinct hallelujah it's just so it's just a thing that's in you and so when when a child of God is really born again he goes to the person or to the place that gave gives you birth and that's the ones you don't have to beg them to pray you don't have to beg in the past you don't have to beg in the come to church you don't have the megohm because that life will compel them to do so it is the nature of a son of God to run to his daddy Jesus distinctly says one is of the father and one is of the devil and when a grain of wheat falls into the earth no matter if that grain of wheat dies to itself it cannot produce a cocklebur in other words when you really die to yourself you're not bearing to nature's when you're is truly saved you are not bearing to nature's a grain of wheat will bring forth the grain of wheat just as sure as anything and if we are sold with the incorruptible seed of God how can it produce anything but a life of Christ let's not fool ourselves it is going to produce a life if that seed is in you and it is quick and like you say it is it will produce life he is the tree of life and if you have a seed from the tree of life you will produce my not education not educated into it but it will be life and you will not even be able to stop it the Holy Spirit leading the church leads in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ y'all hear me let me say it again the Holy Spirit leading the church least it in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and you are sealed unto the day of redemption in otherwise when you are truly born again the Holy Spirit leads you into these virtues he doesn't beg us he leads us yea understand what I'm saying it is something that pulls is like a cab pulling from his mother and like I was saying you know it's like a cab when that calf is first born if that mother is not quite ready what does he do he knocks on the door he will hit that mother's y'all know what I'm saying until that mother is ready to give milk and so is it with with the true born-again believer you and he know he needs nourishment we didn't know he needs these things in his life he will continue to put on al-sharia until he's floor it is in him he cannot settle for being just ordinary Christian or ordinary person in this day our desire should be to be in the statue of in the perfect of Christ you know me you know we will not commoners we're princes with Kings real royalty and it is something in us that makes us want to see those things not offensive in our lives if you slow on that something is wrong there's no time it's not you know how people I've had when I was in the Pentecostal people our world apostolic there were sisters who maybe one or two that literally deceived himself and mentally built up and made themself pregnant they went through all the symptoms they even went through a growth period and when the doctors examine them there was nothing but psychologically they believed that they were pregnant go search it out it happens and you and I were not in a time that we need to be psychologically pregnant we need to know that we've been with our mate it is an experience hallelujah there is no way that you're gonna have a mate with God and not know it doesn't make sense hallelujah understand amen even in the key in the time of Esther Amen that King can mate with any woman he wanted to but everyone he made it with never did get pregnant hello and there was there was there was some that he made it with one time and all he became was concubines for the rest of their lives but that was a meant that he chose like Esther she became Queen and her experience with the King was over and over and over you know understand what I'm saying I mean that's I don't understand how people as a Christian can just settle for one experience oh oh oh I can remember 10 years ago when the Lord did something for me you ought to have an experience with your husband every day impossible the spirit leading the church leads it to the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and you sealed unto the day of your Redemption that's the Bible grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you were sealing to the day of your redemption now before the Holy Spirit ever come this is where I got to start he is sealed away before the Gentile age ever started you understand me so he was always he was already sealing already waiting already there see and so you said well what do you mean what I'm saying what I'm saying I'm true real if you really believe this message you want to go beyond belief you want to see action you want to see God do what he's promised to do for you and to you in this age you don't settle for being a charge remember you don't settle for just like I said when it comes to just knowing the message and you don't receive the messenger and I'm not talking about profit I'm talking about the king the Christ amen who was the real messenger if you don't receive him you end up with the mark of the beast now before the Holy Ghost ever come he is sealed away before the Gentile age ever started he is sealed away under them golden candlesticks back there under that age and remember I was telling you we working with these things and I want to show you that the approach that Jesus tooked him when Calvary was not by sword because he told Peter he said he said unto Peter if you if you fight with the sword you're gonna die by the sword this is not how we fight Alma is divine love hallelujah amen in Paul's day it was safe virgin all the way up but our armor our defense our way of conquering because the Bible says is that right did y'all know that every age had Purdue had to produce that every age had to produced what was required of them and we've come to a place where people don't even have brotherly kindness but listen that's the seventh but what about the eighth Brenham took up took us behind the curtain of time and told us back there is divine love you've got to have the ego you got to have the dog nature i'ma prove it to you in just a moment that nature must come Oh amen like a brother Troy like I said this is it was inspiring Speier inspired by his message because the dog and the lamb are compatible brother Branham says they men with long as you've got that dumb nature God to stay with you but when you let that dumb nature turn into a wolf he said the Holy Spirit would fly off not that he's leaving you because he can't he promised you he wouldn't I never leave you nor forsake you but you won't feel that communion with him until that dog nature comes back and the wolf nature is gone and you wonder why I can't pray wonder why I can't feel you wonder like I was saying the other day in Arizona whatever wrong you got you've done you got to make right you say oh me yes even the prophet of God lied he said tell those people I'm not at home his wife said bill do you think that was right and then he had to go pray for a baby and when he would with that pray you know the devil Oh God Jesus are you hypocrite so he had what happened the duck nature though he was the Prophet the dubnation says I'm not there until you make it right you're on your own he had the all those people that confess to them make it right biggie was able to go pray for the baby hello see you gotta realize by God's grace God put things in your way to test those virtues to see whether they're in there or not if it rattles that means by God's grace you're not where you should be hallelujah you say remember I told you about the man at the car wash and how he pushed my button how he broke the button in my car right and how I got so mad you know I I hadn't done that a long time when I get really mad I go like mmm and we like that Luke are you in trouble and in my mind in my mind I had already done what I needed to do I was angry and I hadn't been like that in years I told my wife I didn't even know I could get that angry but what was happening is that they blamed something only when they were the one that broke it what is your fault oh ma had not really got angry that's the best thing that happened to me in a long time because God didn't showed me you're not where you thought you were mmm I'm acknowledging it but then I know where I'm trying to go you understand me try I'm that I'm a lord but no I know why you did it you helped me you pushed you let me enemy pushed me to a place where the seal broke if it was you know the mean showing that this it wasn't completely sealed in yet oh come on somebody and I disgraced Jesus I disgraced the church and I disgraced myself and I went back to that man and I ask his forgiveness told him I was a preacher ask his forgiveness every time I went about three times that seemeth oh I'm so sorry he said no don't worry about it it's taken care of but I thought about it I said Lord what is this thing amen that if this man should ever sit here in my church and I don't have never made it right then you know the devil to do it hmm that's why you can't go out in the world doing all kind of thing you never know when that person is gonna show up in your church gotta bring him right here her whoever you understand me so you look at this thing is or what are you saying if I can't be a reflection of God because that's what I want it is what you need to be right like the reflection you talking about you know a magnifying glass and us boys used to do devious things with it you know we take that magnifying glass and then let it hit the Sun and focus it on something and cause a little fly or something and burn people on it well you know we did things like that but what was it that right that that that time light was magnified through that glass right because in his normal setting it wasn't browning anything but once it was focused Amen into a point and you were able to take that light and build it in a way till it actually produced fire all you take a mirror or something and you you let that light reflecting the person don't know you you got a mirror and you just and they looking everywhere what was it you took that light in that mirror big did so much it became a reflection of the very thing that you that was hitting it and that's what God is looking for he's looking for a real reflection of himself that can literally cause some kind of action or reaction to the very light she beaming down on us Oh God the Bible tells us that when Jesus was baptized that a voice came from heaven it descended like a dove this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in hallelujah why because Jesus could not take on the devil in the wilderness without the Holy Ghost he was a man Oh y'all didn't know that he was a man he was a prophet he wept he felt pain he felt sorrow hallelujah but only inside he was God he needed the Holy Ghost to withstand the devil guess what when he got the Holy Ghost that's when God led him into the wilderness to be tempted whoa what was God looking for he was looking for a nature of a death that's why he couldn't use his authority that's why he couldn't say oh let the lightning come down that's why he couldn't just just cause her earthquake or whatever to get rid of the devil he was so humble and clothed with so much humility he just stayed with the word knowing all he had to do was speak it not my real Lord but thine be done hallelujah and when he was so hungry what an uncomfortable situation a situation where he had gone without food for 40 days and then God allowed the devil says who tell him he could turn that bread into that stone into bread hungry guys did Jesus but he rejected it hallelujah and he gave honor to God by saying man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God doesn't it sound like what David did when they cut through those hundreds of people I think mile 15 miles of Philistines just to get David a drink of water you think he wasn't thirsty he was more thirsty by the time he came back but instead of dragging it he gave either to God by pouring it out hallelujah showing that even God has a need is that right the Bible said God had a need the Bible said Jesus had need to go by Samaria huh love free will offerings and that's exactly what David gave remember listen when Jesus came and I'm not gonna be long tonight when Jesus came and you know he took the book you know we saw a mighty John was looking Oh we'd not John the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and we need to looked he saw a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world I want you to get this because your religion will not get you anywhere oh because I believe the message I you know my you know God don't care it ain't that he came to one of the greater means in his day Nicodemus Nicodemus you must be born again all your education won't get you there because that's carnal but you've gotta have a real expense y'all know what I'm saying it must be a life and then reflecting out of yours he said and when he looked around he said I don't weep not for the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David he has prevail again a man he conquered in other words he's worthy to take the book is that right oh my god it is the truth but then the prophet of God says listen they're here brothers he said through weakness through sweetness through the Holy Spirit that we conquer not some great mighty intellectual giant but he that humble himself is the man who conquers the man who can be kicked around and still be a servant of Christ he said that's the Conqueror and you know and I know we're living in an age of pride hallelujah we're living in an age where me it won't be recognized you don't know who I am am I supposed to huh you know that's the way people are I mean I'm gonna tell you I said it i'ma say it again the problem with the message is nothing there's no real problem with the message it's the preachers it is the preachers who are arrogant and prideful and you know building this kingdom and building that Kingdom their love Jesus out of it and they will get their glory but you and I there are people Amen brother brems that when that spiritual bride come forth and you cannot be a spiritual bride would having this big without having this period so what do you mean brother folks let me tell you something yes I can see the northing and brother better preach the message faster nor to giving in in time you think he talked about denominational that day is past hallelujah he talked about people who believe so-called the same message Judas and Jesus in the same message one is the devil in one is God in this message you got the same thing you got Judas and you got Jesus and Jews are sold out the money for saying popularity and that's exactly what you see among us but you see Jesus the Bible said he was so humble he was so humble he had to be kissed by Judas in order for the people to know who he was hmm so you and I must it was a mighty lamb that slew the dragon God himself and that's the only way that's why Paul said love conquers all hello love conquers all that's our weapon tree sweetness and meekness hallelujah and you and I must understand by God's grace there was a time they fought with the sword hallelujah but there was a time think about it the New Testament church went to the slaughter like a lamb huh didn't fight back they went to the slaughter like a lamb if it started off that way is going to end up that way when he doesn't you can produce it's the God in you hallelujah is this all right now sometimes God produces things he allowed things to happen you know to you it so that you can understand what he's doing before I read the scripture let me go back down here to just go here because you got to understand that horrible things come hardships come right and you and I must understand that these hardship calm so that it can make us better Christians mmm guarding against your I'm cursed guarding because that's why the curse you that's why the bob says think it not strange with divers temptations try you that the trying of your faith is more precious than go through so much the God don't put on you no more than you can bear everybody got to go through something I was thinking about the birth of a child the birth of a child is not only mess but it's a mess but it's a trial a traumatic experience for the mother in the child so he's born into death he fights so hard to get here not knowing he's on his way out it's the truth and it's better coming in to rejoicing he comes in crying hallelujah why this world is a world of death and all of us have experienced it and we are experiencing it right now but there is a better life there's a life that there is no death there is no sorrow there is no more birth pains like I said you know crying all 90 men will be over cleaning brass will be over but you and I by the grace of God we're moving into a room Amen that will be so supernatural amen it will be but to the bride that supernatural becomes natural think about it but no I had to go through and if Noah made it you can make it no it's just an example amen of the trip of the foolish virgins but what he not went through is not even written but you don't think Enoch was they did probably thought he was crazy to everybody that really walked with God is insane but he knocked like he said if I gotta lose every friend in the world to walk with God is worth to lost and that must be your attitude as well Enoch walked alone when nobody else walked with him not even his family you see it had a family what I know somewhere brother man said one day eating our way to his family bye-bye but had not that been trials every man every woman that walked with God will face hardships many are the afflictions of the righteous but God will deliver them out of them all that right that's how God builds you that's why you listen you're to believers if you go through tests at the test at the test and you still standing you still love God because there's nothing in your mind to turn back hallelujah and when there's nothing in your mind to turn back the only way you can go with think about it no what do you have to go through a promise of God laughs that mark four hundred and something years building Enoch trialed with his family trials with the out outsider than everybody else hallelujah and then when the doors shut he still had more trouble but daddy I thought it was gonna rain no don't worry about it it's gonna rain how do you know God says so well you said that for so many years how do you know cuz God says so so what are you saying God is trying to move us out of the realm of Hope into a perfect faith and when you have a perfect faith you know God is that right you said what do you mean i'ma jump a little bit when Joe went down the way he did he was already a perfect man in God's eyes he was already upright he was already doing what was president pleasing in the sight of God but God wanted job to know see that word know he wanted Joe I know the relationship had to be more intimate than what it had been lot of rules and regulations he did it all but God wanted him to know who he was and see until you become your God can get you to do operation so you know you are see joke the whole revelation behind this is God wanted job to know who he was and who Joe was right he asked the question he said I've seen flowers grow dying common this net-net but what about man where does he fit in this picture he said I never asked that question because now God has something going on up in heaven and is that right and God stopped the devil what are you going oh I've been going I'm doing for all doing whatever seeking when I made a vow God said hey hey I got something for you have you considered my servant Joe see oh why do I have to go through all is he because he wants you to know who he is and he wants you to know who you are Paula so Joe went through all these trials all these deaths his wife even got a devil owner one day say Joe come show God and I and you know Joe was spiritual he looked beyond that flesh and said well man you sound foolish you don't sound like my wife in other words there's a government high no bars you are nor did and you're not speaking the righteous things of God what about us when the devil are not the ones we love can you see God can you see the devil hello that's what's going to make you go through to understand you're not wrestling against flesh and blood but in spiritual wickedness in high places and just as the Holy Ghost can anoint you the devil can't do but had not been told let me read I'm not reading it just because I can't say it like I want to say it but you gotta realize hey man that when God sends you to troubles he's building you every fight every battle you know you lose a few but you don't lose the war oh yeah oh yeah listen brother Adam said like this there had been no rain until the flood came but at the North was pressed into the condition that he was in to throw forty days and nights in the storm and a little pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over then he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise after he had gone through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you go through the tribulation like that poem of that song must I carry home to heaven on a flower bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sail through Braille ec's see as we we asked for comfort and peace and God gives us the best that he could give us trials and tribulation that's better than comfort in peace our confidence is just beyond the river it was until the Hebrew boys was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they'd seen one like the Son of God standing among them their troubles produced the Son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat away but not until they went into the fiery fire did they get that comforter or that comforter appear you said what what do you mean well what about Stephen how many bricks had to hit him before the heavens opened before he saw God was standing and the Christ standing at the right hand of God y'all understand me he wasn't mad he wasn't angry he had to dub nature he had the Holy Ghost on the inside of him that could literally speak from his heart father ladies things not to their charge no man could have done that but it was the nature of the Tree of Life it was Christ in us is that right the Bible said that Abel that coveted that we had have rather is greater than the coveted and Abel had because Abel was seeking for revenge but this covenant Amen the Christ gave to us amen was birth under the inspiration of Father forgive them for they know not what they do he loved his enemy even unto the death that's the nature that would get us to heaven look says it was until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace and one of their most outstanding trials I read again that they seen the one like the son of God standing among them their troubles produce listen their troubles produce the son of God standing among them in the breezes their travels produced it so understand that your troubles will produce a birth some supernatural thing will come out of this every trial hallelujah that you go through understand there's a reward at the end of it every test every trial you go through if you just hold fast to the Word of God God will produce something look at look at Jonah I'm excuse me look at a joke going back to him how his children weigh out their party and everything else he went through it he lost everything his house is gadelle his bike basic everything and God said don't worry Joe you have passed the test I crown you y'all understand me he said I'm not going to just give all that I took from you back seven times I'm gonna multiply it but I'm also gonna restore your children is that right in other words that resurrection you saw your children will be waiting on you don't ever think that you're suffering for no reason you're suffering because you're like a lily you've got to be crushed thank God for the crushing your suffering is a blessing our suffering is a blessing when we talk about peace and comfort that's what cursed us that's why weaker that's what's cursing the people now easy living their devil want you to have all this peace and comfort and you don't even see it it's bringing the fire down but trials will put you on the prayer on the altar trials will put you there in a cab lord have mercy loud you see what I'm saying and sometimes God wants fellowship and that's the only way he can get it sometimes by sending you through the fire they'll remember he's a jealous God and he's not going to allow you to love anything or anyone more than you love him hello it was Daniel who had purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he would pray to God or to to a lion's den I'll go to a lion's den but it was after that the heat was put on and he was thrown into the Lions Den that app that he saw the angel the law standing in the midst of him keeping away the great pillar of fire standing between him and the Lions and the Lions could not get him because he had went through the trial and temptation and troubles and he knew that this that his God was able to deliver him from that is that right so you got to understand that's why Joe said I know hallelujah not that I'm hoping I know my Redeemer liveth see when you know something nobody can take it from you no science no mathematic books no teachers no preacher no nothing when you know and he said you will know in that day that I am in the father the father's in me and I am in you you will know not that you're hoping you will now because your trials have brought you there yep you're crying out has brought you there hallelujah sometimes God has to let them get to us amen because we won't we won't cry out for the holy good we won't cry out to be saving two troubles here Oh sometimes he said why does God trouble come God harnesses trouble and put bits in the mouth and make it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God hello he may even let the devil come and nipple you love me pull him back that's enough he'll put you out there you might feel a little pain but the devil can never destroy you don't you understand you are the reason mother Caesar cavalry was for you he died for you God so loved the world he loved you not this chaotic world he loved his world but you was in this world and he said father let them be in the world but not of the world he brought the whole thing for you but you and I must be like him for in here in him we live in him move and have our being and we certainly as they say we are the offspring of God hallelujah I was thinking about grapes I love grapes oh this is the grape season so I've been going to get me some grapes and I got a few of them in the freezer I like I'm frozen sometimes I think I think our sister told me about the frozen grapes first you know it is good so I tried the frozen grapes and they're delicious I eat them frozen and unfrozen but you know what's so bad so what a wonderful about it they're sweet when they when they're warm but they're sweeter when they're cold I don't understand that but it's so nice a mint just a plunging and one thing I know about grades and I'm going down we get to my point you know when you you have a stack of grapes that look like a pyramid upside down you know how they like that but you got them like this and you know they got one at the end and then they all branch out but if you set them up like that it's like capstone and God uses those grapes you know for wine and you know and stimulation and grapes is a beautiful thing because if you taste one off of that bunch and it's good all the rest are it's good it's the truth it's not like that with strawberries you can get a batch of strawberries and one might be good and all the rest of us our but they are strawberries but you see what it is they are on the same vine and if the original is sweet everything that comes out of it is sweet is it true you know I must make me sure you know that's you know David was saying you know he you know though I walk through the valley and shadowed us afternoon anyway I go back to this you know we must understand that this nature of God you know I I love God so much and I can't explain it I just I told a lot of the Lord all the time I just don't want to say these things i I want this life of love to express itself to me you know it's one thing to say it you know man you know how we guilty of that you know we don't say it to the wife and now we just figure because we give her this and give her that and Dada Dada Dada Amen it's okay and she owes you we assume oh she she knows I love her but that ain't the way a woman is a woman likes to hear it but she know how that I've heard now she wants you to say it young men who are not married yet you better listen up I'm giving you a lesson you better learn how to say it and if you don't know how to say it you better learn how to touch with the hand of love hallelujah y'all know no same when you're going through something that and God see it sometimes he just come in touch doesn't say a word then sometime through the scripture or through the preaching he tells you and you catch it with no one else catching it right Amen it's just you need to hear I love you everybody the probably God said the whole world is dying for love uh-huh and you and I must realize by God's grace we are designed for love we're designed to receive it and we designed to give it out that's whatever he that's what broke it they were in unity they were in harmony they were in love that's all he knew it was after the fall they experienced what hatred was they saw it manifest through their sons how Cain killed Abel and those kind of things they saw what hatred did with animals people and now God has come back to restore his nature that was the whole cavalry thing it was all it was to make a perpetuation of cleansing are you know a way of getting the nature of God back to his people see that's what makes the see live his nature and you and I must understand we can't we can't allow ourselves to come short of it hello I'm not saying you ain't saving like I said if we're gonna make a rapture we're gonna need the nature of God hallelujah now I'm a closed because I said I want to be long and I probably went a little longer than I thought but I want you to understand when we talk about Peter grace be unto you Crais and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue now we can go all the way down there we know what it says but the scripture said if these things be in you huh that you will never fail huh you'll never be failed it goes on say Dillons you to make your calling and election sure that's how you make your election sure when divine law has come and it's now on display cuz that is the token God so of the world what did he do he bought with love up in Jesus don't you know Jesus had the power to wreck the world he could have done whatever he wanted to do but he protected the people by keeping his mouth shut either when he went to the slaughter Amen then beating on him and slapping him and spitting on him and everything else the Bible said he opened not his mouth nature of God divine nature of God well I'm gonna tell them a thing or two I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind don't we do it we get our attitude and the Holy Spirit go you're not there yet and we think to ourselves like the world says up there get over it well they might but you won't until you make it right you won't get over it and that thing laying there will bring you to a complete death if you don't uproot it I'm almost done is this okay whew I'm just gonna I'm gonna stop but I want you to understand there's a there's a creation there's a place that only those who come into the divine nature will go nothing that will defile the city no unclean thing is entering therein and if you don't get clean here you're surely not going there what this creation that's going on in you like this physical creation it brought you where to this dimension and if there's a spiritual spiritual creation going on to you in you now where is it going to take you to a world that's spiritual all right but if this is all you have it bought this this this body basically was born in hell hello because this is what this world is and and the more the longer Christ carries the probably God said hell is blending into Earth that's why we see all the demonic powers that's why we see people going insane insanity is nothing but Devils mmm Legion said it and look at all the naked people you can't tell me that these people don't have legions it's the truth and my thing is this and then if they're susceptible if they can they can pull or allow them demons to come into them and express themselves why are we having such a hard time with the Holy Ghost we don't want to die we're fighting to live but the Bible said if you save your life you die if you think your life here is worth more than the life to come you do everything you could do to save it but the man who's willing to give up this life to obtain that one he'll make it let's not be fool people are dying every day and if the Lord tarry you and I gonna die and you do not want to go down unprepared now it's the time of salvation stop stop thinking you know you dissin that and you can't just treat me in a kind of way they did it to Jesus Jesus said if they did it in the green tree they gonna do it in the dry you think you're gonna get out of being persecuted and treat it wrong and you know you're taking a stand don't compromise now you got to stand on the word when you compromise you fail the test you got to start all over again wherever the where the weakest link is that's where the chain break is that word let's tan People of God it's not a fussing I'm saying if you're gonna hear the word if you're gonna be the word let's go forward give everything you got amen to live like I heard somebody say I'm dying to live and I can just die to live I'll be okay because this flesh do not want to die it fights you right you understand me when somebody do you wrong that that fresh kid you see that beast you see you mighty may not say none to you but just get upset like I told you the other day itself whatsoever it whatsoever exalt whosoever was sort of exalt itself that itself is a demon against the Word of God itself was Lucifer amen in heaven itself was Lucifer or or the serpent in the Garden of Eden itself because it's so spiritual now it's a spiritual warfare in the mind itself stays on your left side and Christ on the right you've seen the cartoons the devil on one side telling you the bad things to doing God on the other side with the halo around his head saying don't do it that's your battle and guess what it's greater than the Battle of Jericho it's greater than the battle that they had in Egypt it's greater than any of the battles they ever had in a New Testament because they could see their enemy and fight [Music] you have called me leave me [Music] [Music] [Music] Reverb that Sandra [Music] [Music] eat some to wash my sins away and now I see a brand new song amazing easy not hold I own a now I see a brand new IPE [Applause] because he gleams my soul and set me free [Music] Oh brain goosal amazing grace all day long Jesus baby you you you
