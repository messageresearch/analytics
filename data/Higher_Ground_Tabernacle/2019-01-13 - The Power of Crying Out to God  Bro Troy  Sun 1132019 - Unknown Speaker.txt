in my name I'll come right there in the midst of you and be with you amen and that was a promise Amen we have gathered here this morning we've gathered here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and we are here to partake of that promise amen what an honor it is to be in the presence of the Most High God Amen I don't know if sometimes we realize exactly what happens when we come into this place hey man we think you know we we tend to sometimes over supernatural eyes everything but we come into this natural building where Jesus gave us a natural promise of a supernatural current just a natural church service that has a supernatural meaning amen there where Christ is right here a man sometimes when we gather into this place we don't realize exactly what's happening that we were actually gathering in his name that Christ comes right in the midst of us amen let's just as we stand let's open our Bibles to Psalms chapter 145 I want to spend quite a bit of time today in John chapter 17 later on we'll read through quite a bit of it but for the beginning here let's just go to Psalms 145th Psalm read the 14th through the 16th verse I want to speak a message called the power of crying out to God amen the power of crying out to God Amen 145th psalm start with the fourteenth verse and it says the lord upholdeth all that fall and raise us up all those that be bowed down the eyes of all wait upon thee and now give us them their meat in due season now open the stein hand and satisfy us the desire of every living thing a man let's just power has an order prayer Heavenly Father we just approach unto you this morning Lord given you all the glory and the honor and the praise do unto your name father or as we and gather into this room Lord we quiet ourselves down father we lay aside all the thoughts of the week and all the thoughts of the cares of this world Lord and we just begin to focus upon you lord Lauren we just want to thank you for coming into this place father well we didn't gather out tradition Lord of any other reason or motive or purpose Lord but just together together in your presence Lord and to rejoice around your word that you gave unto us and Laura as we say here Lord underneath your word father we pray that you would open up our hearts father if we've done anything wrong we pray Lord you forgive us if we have sinned father we ask that you would wash us with your blood father and take our iniquities and transgressions away from a slore now we might sit Lord in purity a underneath your gospel father and and and just a complete understanding and rejoicing in your presence we pray you'd break open the word of life to us Lord and that way the only only you can do it Laura like you did on the road to emmaus Lord we pray you'd do it again once more here in our midst and we just think ask all these things and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated when I read there in that 145th Psalm it just caught me about how you know the promise of God would uphold those that fall down and if someone is bowed down he would raise them up amen if someone falls down it'll stand them up amen and and you know and part of this it had to do with then we get down to verse 16 he says thou openess 9 hand and you satisfied the desire of every living thing amen and as I read that I began to you know just kind of picture in my mind of a a field or a field or a meadow that is lacking in water you know and how the the plants you know they begin to bow themselves down you know and there and as the but as I said there though satisfies the desire of every living thing you know when when you like you take like a meadow or a place that is beginning to go through a drought or a time of dryness then every living thing begins to cry out to God amen everything that is in the meadow when it begins to lack water no matter what type of plant it is whether it be an animal or a plant or whatever type of life it is when the with the water begins to to go out into a drought season then everything that is living begins to cry out to God everything that is alive begins to just begins crying out what was it doing it's beginning to cry out to water how many remembers you and the Lord told Moses I have heard the cry of my people Amen they've been there in Egypt now for 400 years and they're crying out you know there that would wear its star out where they had a place in Goshen yos well water they had a place that was pretty nice than Egypt and they were rejoicing they had a name where they were the family of Joseph you know in a place of honor in Egypt but as they rose up a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph things began to get pretty tough things began to get pretty rough and then the cries they started out is just a low murmur they meant that the cry just start out as a low murmur but as the times got more or more difficult the cries began to get more stronger and stronger amen amen and we got down to the time of of Moses the children of Israel were crying out unto the Lord their God save us from where we are now why were they crying out because they are beginning to realize that their condition had gotten so far away from what God intended for them back in the beginning amen now is one thing that when they are just a little bit out of the way but now in the time of Moses they've gotten so far away from where God intended them to be and there's just something about their own natural being that they realize it's not supposed to be like this hey man this is not the condition that we're supposed to be in amen a drove a cry down on the inside of them and as the more they cried out unto God the more they cried out in cry out craft and God began to hear them and God set them exactly what they had needed they had need of to be delivered from the condition that they were in amen and now they didn't necessarily know how to be delivered they didn't necessarily know exactly what they needed but they just knew that what the condition that they were in was not the condition that God intended for them to be in amen they may not have considered their known or had the wisdom to think exactly where they wanted to go where they needed to go or what condition they should be in but all they knew how to do exactly was to cry amen that's a good thing to know how to do amen because when you begin when when the things of this earth begin crying out to God God looks back into the beginning what condition are they supposed to be in and what condition are they in now and when God begins to listen to their cry and God refers back to looking into what condition they're supposed to be in and comparing that with the condition that they are in then God begins to look and see what can I do to bring them back to the condition that they're supposed to be amen and when when I consider what the what did the children you know when when I look at Moses God sent them to Moses and the very first thing was was I got I get these guys out of Egypt amen I cannot bless you while you're here in the midst of Egypt I cannot perform my work upon you while you're here in the in the midst of Egypt so the very first thing that God did was he sent Moses to draw them out of that condition amen and to get them up to the mountain a mint where God could reveal himself unto them amen once they got their eyes off of Egypt and got their eyes upon the glory of God that once they saw that glory then they begin to realize that there's something besides Egypt for their lives amen so remember one and what would they do he took him off to that most off to that mountain what they do they saw the glory of God it's parting the Red Sea Amen they saw the glory of God as it was a thick cloud they saw the glory of God as a pillar or a fire they saw the glory of God come down upon the mountain where Joshua and Moses went up into the mountain they saw I remember the it says that the Moses and Aaron and all of his sons went up into the mountain amen and that as they set there and then there are 70 of them that went up with them as they set down there to eat that they saw the Living God of Israel they saw the Living God of the Living God and that scripture always amazes me back there in the Old Testament where they saw a guy there was like 80 people there and they all saw God and they're sitting there community was another God is giving them something first he drew them out of Egypt and what's he trying to do he's trying to restore them back to be in the condition where they were supposed to be Oh what condition of this think about what condition are people supposed to be in honestly what condition or people doesn't matter whether you're in the time of Moses doesn't matter whether you're times of Jesus Christ or today what condition our people are really supposed to be if we were created by the Most High God if we if God has created this earth and God has created people to be on the earth then really what condition where we create here to be a mate well in order to understand that to declare that to figure that out you got to go back a bit to the very beginning if you're ever going to understand the condition that people are supposed to be in what the original design is then you have to go back to the beginning amen you know like we I use the the thing of a meadow when it's lacking in water you know when you take like say a garden and that is well watered and you take the water away from it everything begins to wilt it begins to the flowers begin to fade any beauty that it has begins to fade away and pretty soon it doesn't look anything like whoever designed it intended for it to look like now all the information is there for it to look exactly the way it's supposed to look but because of the lack of the water it can't get to the position that's supposed to be in amen but once you begin adding water back into the garden all sudden things begin springing right back up to the condition that they're supposed to be in you know I was like you know like when my wife cooks a meal you know every whenever you went whenever you walk into a place like say a garden you want to see it in the condition that whoever made that garden had in his mind he when he created that he had something in his mind and that's the condemned and I want to see it a man no one wants to see something this ruined direct they want to see it in the condition that the person who created it wants it to be in you know I was like when my wife makes a meal you know and she makes a meal and she puts everything out on the table and you know and sometimes she'll have some toppings off over here and when you get there to sit down you don't sometimes I'll just I'll grab the first thing I see I'll put it on my plate and if I'm not careful I'll just start eating and also I'll watch her she'll grab something off over here start spreading it on top this should put grab something over here and put it over here and mix it in and I realized that I've been missing out on something because I wasn't paying attention amen I'm not experiencing the meal the way she designed for it to be experience now if my wife is going to make a meal I want to eat it exactly in the way that she had in her mind for it to be a man I want an experience and why because when she cooks a meal I want to experience that meal exactly how she considers it to be cooked now if you know if like so and lays out a bowl of rice and some other things over here and you just grab the rice put it on your plate and begin to eat rice bare rice you're not experiencing the meal the way the cooked experience designed for you to experience it and so it is with my wife when she cooks a meal I want to experience it exactly the way she intends for it to be cooked I think about like like I was reading about the pyramids a while back in Egypt they say that the pyramids used to be coated with these white stones they were a covering stone a covering for the pyramids and then back you know they back about 1500 years ago so inside they wanted to take those stones off and go use them to build some other building somewhere else they strip the entire pyramid of it's an outer coating now if you go to look at those pyramids you can never see them the way the build are designed for them to be seen so if I go see the pyramids I feel like I'm missing out on something because I can't see it the way it was designed for it to be I can't see in his full glory the glory that was designed to be in amen and you know and so it is a saint with a Christian if I cannot see a Christian the way God designed for them to be that I feel like I'm missing out on something amen their God designed his people to live in a certain type of way God designed for his his sons and daughters to have certain things in their mind to have certain things that to live a certain way amen so that they would be here on this earth that they not be of the earth amen when God drew the people out of Egypt he had to draw them out of Egypt so they could come and experience his glory amen he wanted to get them over into the promised land so they could begin to experience things the way God wanted them to experience a man what'd he do he took Moses and he showed them a pattern and he began to say whatever you see up in the heavens I want you to recreate that down on the earth a man and that's when he began to create a lamb sacrifice that's when he began to create an altar or man and God kimete that's where he began to create a holy place where God could come down and be amongst his people why because there are things that Moses saw up in the heavens and he was trying to recreate that down on the earth you know that thing is still going on today amen you know that's still supposed to be in place today amen that we are still have the same Commission the Moses had to take things that are up in the heavens amen and recreate them right down here on the earth Amen that Commission still stands here today let us draw her to a John chapter 17 you know if I cannot experience something the way it's supposed to be experienced then you can begin to feel like you're being cheated out of something you know like like go into a 3d movie not putting those 3d glasses on you're missing something you're not seeing it the way it was designed to be seen amen or or be like going to go into a concert and sitting there with your hands over your ears you're not experiencing it the way or what if you go to go to a go to a symphony or an orchestra and next to you is sitting a child as screaming his head off and you want to enjoy the music but you can't when you were getting upset because there's this child screaming over here and you're like I can't experience this the way I wanted to I can't see this or have it listen this Orchestra and it's full glory because of this distraction that's off over here well there's times where you see things in this world that are so beautiful because they're being done exactly the way the designer had them in their mind whether it be a painting or an orchestra or going to see a play any men are going to see a movie that has been well created you know or something like this any time I see something that's been well done and you get to see it exactly way the man that designed it design it then it just it does something to you because you're seeing something that is perfection and there's something about mankind when they see something in its perfection it drives an awe inside of them why because you're seeing something in its full glory you're seeing something exactly the way it's supposed to be seen there's no distractions it's not been tampered with it's not being contaminated but it's in its full beauty and then just it does something to you and you always remember those times when you get to see something in its full glory and even when you go down years and years later you always think back to you I remember the time when I saw this symphony or this Orchestra amen I remember the time when I went out into the mountains and I saw something just the way God created a thousands of years ago amen and you get to see something in its full glory what why it did it creates a certain atmosphere within you that you saw something that was perfect amen and God has still designed us to to be in that condition to where we would enjoy seeing things that are perfect why because we're supposed to be perfect God told tole to command us to be perfect on this earth as your heavenly father in heaven is perfect amen though we on this earth should be complete just like our Heavenly Father is complete man John chapter 17 verse 22 it says and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one amen the glory so Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago when he came to this earth he had a certain glory that was given to him amen and that glory that he had with him was perfect it was complete amen and that glory came from something that he had before with the father before the foundation of the world amen so when Jesus Christ came to the earth he came to a world those in ruins it wasn't perfect it was incomplete it wasn't in the same condition that the designer created to be in amen but the designer came to the earth which was the Lord Jesus Christ and he had in within himself the same glory of perfection that was back at the beginning amen and as he came to this earth every time he ran across things that were not in their original glory he would reach out his hand to change the situation to be back in the original glory amen so that could be back in the glory of the creator' amen and as he is testifying to his disciples he said he's praying he says Lord that the glory which thou gavest me I have now given unto them that they that they might be one just like we are one a man who can deny that when the Lord Jesus Christ was here on the earth though he was not one with the father who could deny that amen when he came to this earth he had a perfect union with his father he had a perfect union with his father amen all he had to do was bow his head and close his eyes and he could be caught talking face to face with this father amen if he ever prayed her prayer he knew where his prayer win amen when he when he saw something on this earth that he wanted to fix he knew he could draw from perfection from before the foundation of the world bring it right to the present time and changed the position of whatever situation he was in and make it just like perfect like it was supposed to be before the foundation of the world amen now what was it before the foundation of the world what happened there was a lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world there were his names were written upon a book of life a man saw God before the foundation of the world wrote down on his book that these names should have life and that they should have it more abundantly amen amen now a Fiat now if any of these names at any one time should fall short of the glory of God as Romans 3:23 says that there would be a lamb that was slain to bring those those names back to the condition that they once were now before the foundation of the world these names are written on the book so that they might have the glory of the life of God amen that was the condition before the foundation of the world and when God began to put these names in the Garden of Eden amens the first the first man the first woman and when they experienced their life life upon the earth everything was perfect they had full power over heaven and earth they were Kings over the earth a man they had Dominion they had all was perfect he meant and they lived in a perfect condition and if they need anything they could ask their Father and he would give it to them amen if they if they wanted to communion with their father all they had to do is bow their heads and ask and they are one with their father there was nothing there was separating them from their father but their father would come and walk with them and talk with him every day that was the condition amen but suddenly when the fall happened it separated man from their original condition amen you know one of the things that brother band said over and over again that strikes me is he says that we'd be restored back to the Garden of Eden again like it was before the fall that's what we were designed to do the message now there were the the the sit when the seals were broke it's here to bring us back to the same condition like we were in the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall and tell you let me tell you if we are missing out on that then we've missed something amen if we have not been restored back then we missed something if God gives us something then why don't we have it it's like that says there in Ephesians that when God ascended up on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men amen he gave some pastors some teachers amen now as he gave the fifl miss for the people he gave it for a specific purpose it was for the perfecting of the Saints so they can be back in the condition who was like they were before the fall amen and if we are missing that then then we've missed something it's like sitting down at a meal and you're eating the bare rice when you have all these toppings off over here and you're not eating a meal the way the designer had in their mind you're missing the full glory of the meal amen be like going to an orchestra and having a crying baby there you're not experienced in the way the the the conductor had in his mind for you to experience it Amen is so our men and women sons and daughters of the Living God not experiencing life on this earth in the condition that God expected them to experience it Amen when Adam and Eve were placed here on the earth they experienced life and life more abundantly amen and so should you and if you're not then you're missing something amen now first before God could get the children of Israel to experience the life that he gave unto Abraham he first had to draw them out of Egypt amen he had to show them the slain lamb he had to show them the power that could split the Red Sea he had to show them the power that could split the river Jordan amen and once they fully experienced his power I want to say it fully experienced his glory and fully experienced his forgiveness then they could really enter into the Promised Land and begin to experience it the way God expected them to experience a man you know Caleb had that had that revelation and that's why he said your mouth give me my Mountain you gave it to me and I'm here to experience it exactly how you want me to experience it Amen now if you don't have that experience and you're missing something you're sitting at the meal but all you're doing is eating the bare rice why because you're not experienced life and life more abundantly yours you're missing something let me tell you if you go through this life just staring at your cell phone all day you're missing something then amen if you go through life loving the world or the things in the world let me tell you you're missing something amen if you go through life and you've never been convicted of your sins I want to tell you something that you've gone to the movies but your worth you have your blindfold on you sit down at the meal but all you're eating is bear write a menu you went to to the to the vineyard where the best wine has ever been create and all your drinking is water amen you are missing something amen if you have never experienced the Lord Jesus Christ in his majesty if you have never been filled with the Holy Ghost then then you're just eating bare rice because you have never experienced the majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ if anybody that has ever traveled and gone to say a mountain meadow or or climb the been to a place is just so scenic it takes your breath away let me tell you that is what your the condition your Christian life is supposed to be and if you do not have that you've missed something amen when Jesus Christ ascended up on high he led captivity captive so if you are captive to something then you're missing the whole reason why Christ came amen and if you have not been perfected then you're then you have been the if you don't have a pastor then you're missing a gift that God gave you God gave you something and you're missing it amen now let me tell you if God gives me something I want to have it Amen it's just like the when they came out of Egypt a lot of them well almost everybody that came out of Egypt all they got to experience was the dry sand of the desert now I want you to think about that real plainly real clearly almost everybody that came out of Egypt came out underneath the power of God and all they got to experience was a dry desert sandy place and so it was the same is true in the Church of the Most High God now let me tell you was that what they were supposed to experience no God had a land that he wanted to bring them to amen God had a place that he is trying to get the people to but because they couldn't get themselves extracted from Egypt enough they couldn't experience what God had in their mind a man you know that Ark of the Covenant was never designed to be dragged around the desert for 40 years it was not what it was meant for they built the Ark of the Covenant but once they built it God would rich the glory of God showed up over the Ark of the Covenant but then they just dragged it around the desert for 40 years the place where the glory of God would come and soda and they dry it it was meant to be taken right to the river Jordan pass on through and go and take over under the power of God be it because they couldn't get their eyes off Egypt and the things of Egypt they could never experience the power of God the way it was supposed to be experienced amen and God has a glory as we've read there in John 17 the glory that thou has given me Christ did have a glory amen he had a glory when he came to this world Jesus Christ had a glory amen that heum his father were one and every time he saw a situation there was contrary to the glory of God all he had to do is touch it all I had to do is speak to it all he had to do is pray about it and it would be changed exactly the way he designed for it to be changed and now that same glory that he had from the Creator he has now given unto them the disciples why that they might be one even as we are one so now here it's beginning to express into the disciples that his idea what he had in his mind was not just the him himself would have the glory of God but now that the disciples would also have the glory of God and be able to go out as emissaries and do the same thing Jesus Christ did what a promise let's go back to John 17 as I want in this second half of the sermon I want to begin going through Psalm 17 we're gonna read several of these verses amen and just gonna go through one by one because as Jesus is coming to the end of his ministry on the earth he prayed this prayer over his disciples I want to think about that very clearly Jesus Christ have been with his disciples three and a half years he's coming to the very end of his ministry amen to where he's going to be he's gonna he's not going to just leave them without a witness but they're gonna no longer be able to see him with their natural eyes amen and so as the end of that ministry is coming on the earth here he he prays this prayer as John 17 1 or we'll read the first three verses here it says and these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent amen now that prayer that same pattern is to recreate itself over and over and over again throughout the entire church age amen that the same pattern that Moses saw would now be recreated us amen that those had their names written upon the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world that those same ones amen we experience life have it more abundantly they experience forgiveness for their amen they'd be pulled out of Egypt everything they've ever been done if they've ever done wrong will be forgiven them and that they could have their eyes taken away from the things that are natural amen and they began to experience the glory of God amen they would be like Moses standing on top of the mountain amen they'd be like the children of Israel staying at the Red Sea when they washed the waters part what are they doing they're getting their eyes off the world and beginning to experience the power of the Almighty God amen amen father I pray Lord that that that they would hear amen and this is a verse week and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent a man verse four I have glorified thee on the earth I finished the work that thou gavest me to do now who can deny that we that in the ministry of Jesus Christ we saw the power of the Almighty God amen everywhere he went there was nothing was beholden from nothing everything was in his power he could do anything that if the father showed him something he could do it amen the glory of the Father was shown to him perfectly he meant now let's going on to verse four and five it says I have glorified thee on the work on the earth I have finished the work that the hell gave us me to do watch this on verse five oh now Oh father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was so Jesus Christ is standing here in the natural body on the earth he's looking back to before the foundation of the world he's crying out Lord take that glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world and bring it and set it upon me just now a man died might be filled with the exact same glory that had with thee before the foundation of the world what's he crying out boys cry out for the perfection he's crying out for the same majesty the same power whatever he was supposed to back then that he did have back then now that here in the midst of a natural world if you look around all you see is a natural room made with natural walls amen and natural people sitting there in the room but that those now those natural people will begin to experience something that was from before the foundation of the world that that same glory would now come down into that room come into that body and fill that body with the Holy Ghost to fill that body with the creation fill that body was exactly whatever God had in his mind for the beginning that now be recreated there amen amen because you know in the fall took place it ruined everything there is nothing that the fall didn't touch when the fall took place when Adam and Eve sinned a man when the fall took place it ruined everything on the earth there was nothing there wasn't ruined there was nothing there wasn't tight hampered with there was nothing that wasn't touched but now in this little upper room there is a man by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a God man and He is calling out he is crying out for something for a glory that was way back before the fall to come down into the natural and to enter into that room and to fill the natural with the supernatural he's crying for now do you think it happened do you think Jesus's prayer was answered amen all power in heaven and earth is given unto me he said amen now let's keep going let's go down to verse 13 and 14 they're still in this Upper Room here amen he's cried out for the power from before the foundation of the world to come and fill him a man he's still praying unto the father and he says in verse 13 and now come I to thee he's getting ready to leave them amen and these things I speak in the world right there in the natural world the world that's been ruined by the fall these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy filled in themselves I have given them thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world so now these disciples are beginning to be separated from the world just like the shore of Israel being separated from Egypt Damon they're being separated from the world and he's beginning to declare unto Him they're just like I am not of the world so are you not of this world well that's a powerful thing because if you are in that room look at him they would look like natural men amen they look they have hands like we have hands they have faces like we have faces they're sitting there at a natural table amen they're sitting there in a room with stone walls but here is a man by a god man by the name of Lord Jesus Christ he wasn't born he didn't just come from Mary amen but he came from the holy powerful eternal Holy Ghost amen and now he is saying that the power that came back from before the foundation of the world has now come down into that room inside of him that the glory that he had with the father before the foundation of the world has now come down inside of him amen and now this same eternal one is crying out and he's saying Lord I these things I'm speaking here in the ruined earth that they might have my joy fulfilled also inside of them and that they I have given them thy world and now I'm now that they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world amen now he is taking them these natural 12th he's separating them away from the world and joining them to himself amen the all-powerful Almighty God in flesh is taking 12 natural men separating them away from the world the things of the world and joining them to himself Amen so the same joy that when Jesus the joy Jesus Christ said when he said Lazarus come forth that same joy he's now giving to them whatever joy he had in the world where he could speak to the natural situations and make supernatural things happen that same joy is now given to them amen the same joy where Jesus could reach back before the fall and draw from things before the fall and enjoy those things now he's given that same joy unto these 12 amen let's keep going let's go into verse 15 through 19 he says I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil praise God so it's not that work just going to be so supernatural that God's taking us up out of the world but he's praying that we could be here in the world but somehow be separated from all the wicked and evil things of this world and let me tell you if you have not experienced that you're missing something you're not eating the meal that God designed for you to eat Amen you're missing something verse 16 they are not of the world even s just like even as I am NOT of the world so in the same way that the Lord Jesus Christ was not of the world now these are not of the world now they didn't go through the virgin birth or did they when they're born again of the Holy Ghost they went through the virgin birth with him why because they died to themselves and they were born again amen when you have the born against perience now you're in the world but not of the world you are in the world like Jesus Christ was a man why because you're no longer born of your natural parents you're giving given power to become sons and daughters of God and if you haven't experienced that you're missing something God gave you something but you even miss it you have an inheritance but you haven't grabbed it amen God gave you a gift but you haven't opened it yet amen you have an inheritance but you haven't cashed the check yet Amen God gave you something you're missing it you're not experiencing the meal like to cook intended for you to experience it amen they are verse 16 they're not of the world even as I am NOT of the world verse 17 through 19 or says sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify themselves that they also might be sanctified through the truth amen so now that verse 18 look at that just the same way as thou sent me into the world even so if I sent them amen so now those that had their names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and the land that was slain for those names before the foundation of the world are being pulled off the Lamb's Book of Life amen set down into the world and living here in natural bodies but they're being separated away from the wickedness and the evil world and they're being given the glory of God the same glory that Jesus Christ had with the Father from before the foundation of the world and is now in dwelling not just Jesus Christ but these same twelve they were with him my what a blessing how'd you like to have been there we are there amen we that same opportunities been laid set before every single one of us amen now let's keep going verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word amen now I think we're getting to our present day condition Amen I have heard the word that these disciples preached I heard it I believed it and now I am experience it amen amen neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they made all that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me amen so now we've been separated from the world we've been sanctified from the world we're being removed from the world and now what we're becoming one with the Father even just like Jesus Christ was one with the father on the earth we've been filled with the Holy Ghost now we can begin to experience life like it was before the fall why because we've been filled with the glory of God amen and if we have if you have not experienced that you're missing something that was given to you amen you can come to this church all day long amen every day in day out but if you still love the world love the things of the world you are missing something you're missing something God designed you to live here like you were in the Garden of Eden before the fall and all power in heaven earth has been given unto you to have that experience and amen but because of the blindness of this age it is so easy for Christians to lose sight of that amen and the only way to get back to seeing that is through Communion and fellowship with him amen he's still here he has not left himself with our witness amen and there are men and women that are experiencing life on this earth in the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall and if you don't have that experience you're missing something amen nobody likes to miss out amen nobody likes to miss out on something amen verse 22 and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one yeah you know Jesus Christ one day he told his disciples I beheld Satan falling from heaven like a bolt of lightning you know Jesus Christ knew exactly who Satan was he knew exactly everything that he had done he knew the power of the Satan had over the earth and yet when he came to this earth he knew exactly the power of the slip Satan was powerless amen when he took away the power of Satan he knew what kin did what he was placing us into amen that he said remember when the when when the disciples came back her choice and they said oh look even the Devils are subject unto us name you know unto us he says don't just rejoice because the Devils are subject unto you look I even saw Satan falling down from him but I want you to rejoice that your names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life and before the foundation of the world amen because once you begin to realize who you are amen and the place the inheritance you've been given then all power in heaven is and devils mean nothing to you as jesus says i cast out devils with the finger of god my you know you know jesus did not jump up and down when he was casting out Devils he didn't scream and you know I I wouldn't I grew up in Pentecost amen and when I see the way some people cast out Devils you can tell that they're doing it from a hope so they're doing it from like I hope this works oh boy I sure hope this happens and maybe if I scream a little louder that Devil might come out or maybe if I just pray a little bit if ice scream for another hour this devil might come out and you realize that they don't know who they are they don't know the power they have that they're just doing they're like the sons of sceva they're taking the experience of another and hoping that it will work for them and there's nothing like I just cannot stand watching Devils laugh to themselves in the middle of a church service because they're the people praying have no power inside of themselves hey man I've seen that before and I just it just something that that that just drives me up a wall when I see Satan comfortable in a church service because he knows that he is sheltered from any power than anybody might have because of the unbelief Amen or the sins of the people that's just something that drives a minister up a wall when he sees that Amen I remember seeing that down in South America once when we were we were praying and you you'd see people come up and and and they would be you know people would pray over them and shout over them and you know they'd look like they were delivered they'd fall backwards their eyes and roll up they'd be riding around on the ground and they'll sudden they get quiet and they get up and you'd know in your heart that person was not delivered you know but date but Satan always likes to sin a diversion into the service so he can attract the attention of everybody so eat so then said the Holy Spirit getting the attention now the devil is getting the attention Amen it's not supposed to be that way Amen it's not supposed to be that way Amen but we are called to have the same glory that we could be one with each other and one with God this in the exact same way that Jesus Christ was one with the father when he was on here on the earth in the same way amen it's possible that's the thing about it is it's possible aim as we read there back in the beginning lord upholdeth all that fall he raiseth up all those that be bound down amen verse 16 has said thou open a thine hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing so if there is a living thing somewhere the word is in his DNA but because of a lack of water or a lack of nutrients that that plant cannot express the fullness of what DNA is says it's supposed to express was you it begins to cry out why because it's lacking something it can't it can't have it can't express what's supposed to express the DNA the DNA is there to - to know what a perfect plant is supposed to look like amen but because of a lack of water because of a lack of nutrients it can't be what's supposed to be then it begins to cry out a man as sore as a Christian Amen when you read this book when you read the Bible and you realize that's written in your DNA to be perfected it's written in your DNA that all that the power that was given unto the Lord Jesus Christ that the same works that you were supposed to do when you realize that's written in your DNA and you look down in your life and you're like I don't have it when you begin to realize that you don't have the overcoming Christian life Amen when you realize that you love the world or the things of the world a man when you realize that you're bored and coming into church when you realize that you you don't enjoy coming to church and you wish you could then your life begins to cry out a many being the more you cry out the closer you are to getting the inheritance that you're supposed to have in the beginning Amen why because God has an inheritance for you Amen God was praying to the Father amen that the same glory that he had that you would have Amen and that he was praying to the Father at the same power that the same overcoming power Amen - he had now that you had Amen he had this little prayer meeting in this upper room aim as they are sitting there in a natural it's just a natural room like we are today Amen with walls that were built by natural hands Amen or roof this place Sarabhai by natural men but yet this man this god man the Lord Jesus Christ began crying out unto the Father amen sitting there in a natural setting with natural friends natural disciples they meant but he begins crying out for something that was given unto him before the foundation of the world and the thing is is it actually happen he said glorify thou me glorify me with the same glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world and every single one of us was given a glory before the foundation of the world if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life it's yours it belongs to you it's written in your DNA your spiritual DNA it's written in you it's an inheritance that belongs to you amen and if it's just lacking the moisture if it's just lacking the proper soil it begins to cry out unto God Lord fill me with that glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world whatever it is that you had in your mind for me to be that's what I want to be Laura what when you are dying upon that cross and you are thinking about me as you are dying Laura what did you have why did you die for me what were you trying to restore me back to you when you were dying on the cross that's what I want to be whatever you had in mind Lord when you were thinking about me on the cross that's what I want to be when you wrote my name upon the Lamb's Book of Life Lord when you wrote down all that I would be all of my potential everything that I would do everything that I would say what I was supposed to be here on the earth Lord that's what I want to be Amen because if I can't fulfill that I'm missing something a man if I can't be what God designed me to be then I'm missing something and I don't want to miss out on anything that God has for me to be amen I don't think anybody does amen I want to experience this life exactly how the Creator intended me to experience it I don't want to miss one thing I want the fullness of the glory of God on the inside of me I don't want to miss anything I don't want to miss out on anything if God has something for me it's my inheritance it's mine I claim it I cry out for it and here standing in a natural room I say Lord fill me with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world fill me with the glory that I had with you and you wrote my name upon the book Lord fill me with the glory that I had with you when you said that if you fall short of the glory of God that I will restore that glory back to you amen amen why because it's possible that's the thing about it is is it's possible amen why because Jesus Christ came to the natural earth and he prayed this prayer in this natural earth so that we might have his prayer answered in our lives he meant let's keep going let's go down to verse verse 24 he says father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am now when he prayed that prayer he was in a natural room with him but that's not what he was speaking with he was standing in perfection with the father they meant he was standing in glory with the father a man he says I wants them to be with me right where I am amen that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world hey man you all reminds me of the time when Elijah was standing there and he said O Lord I pray you would open get Hayes's eyes hey man why so that so they so that Elijah's servant even though he is standing right there with him behold the glory of their amen he couldn't behold the glory of where they were standing here the servant was looking at all the enemies surrounding them hey men and here the Prophet is looking at the power of God all over the place two different visions Lord I pray that you would give my servant a haze' the power to stand here and view and see be with me right where I'm standing where I'm standing by BK hey Z even though he was standing physically where he was standing was a staying especially and now when Jesus Christ was on the earth he had the glory of God amen he knew that all power in heaven and earth was given unto him amen and that that same power he had now to give unto others and he said Lord I pray Lord that these standing here would stand with me Amen father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world you know brother band said the true Christian is a mystic to the world is a mystic to the world why is that it's because they're always standing between two worlds they're here standing on the earth but the whole time they have this heavenly vision where they're always looking up something the spirit is showing them a man the following the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen a man has led of the Holy Ghost is like the wind nobody knows where he comes from nobody knows where he's going why because he's being led by the Holy Ghost you never know what a man like that is gonna do next because he's being led by the Holy Spirit amen and so it's supposed to be with every true Christian Amen you're to be led by the Holy Ghost Lord what would you like to do today amen Lord as I get myself up this morning I'm submitting myself to you for service and making myself available to the Holy Ghost Lord Lord if I've done anything wrong though it that would stop me from being to commune with you perfectly Lord I repent of it Lord forgive me and Lord I'm reporting here for do Lord what would you like to do today amen reporting for service being available amen David why so the glory of God you're standing there amen where Jesus Christ stood not beholding the natural things of where you're at but looking at the heavenly amen breaking into the heavenly to see where we're at as brother Brown said amen out of lujah verse 25 Oh righteous father the world hath not known thee and that is true they're going on about their daily lives but they don't know amen but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me now their understanding was being opened that the almighty invisible God had sent the Lord Jesus Christ to the earth he didn't come of his own will amen but he came of the will of the Father the centum amen and as their understanding is being open to this and beginning to realize that the man staying before them was not just a natural man it was a god man amen he was not just born of Mary and Joseph Amen but he was born of the Holy Spirit born of Almighty God and began to realize that this was not a natural man but this was Jesus Christ the Son of the Most High God and as their understanding was beginning to open being open to that as he is opening their understanding he looks like this says and the power that God has given me before the foundation of the world I am now giving unto you the same glory that I had with the father before the foundation the world I'm now giving unto you and the same place that I am standing right now in heavenly places of the Father now I'm giving you the ability to stand there with me amen and now the same parentage the same lineage that I have to where I was not born of of Mary about whose womb that I came but I was actually was born of the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world now I'm given that same power unto you a man is even though as John the Baptist said the one that the angel told John the Baptist the one that you see the Holy Spirit descending upon and remaining upon that is the one that is going to baptize with the Holy Ghost that is a little lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that is one that is going to cleanse the men of God from their sins now that same one is telling them that same Holy Ghost that descended upon me and remained is now going to from heaven upon you and remain so wait here until you be endued with power from on high because it's going to come unto you amen and now though all those that had believed on him have the same ability that the same Holy Ghost be sent unto you amen o righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it and that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them and now that the same love that G's is there in the natural body on the earth had between him and his father they United them completely seamless together Amen that that same love would now be in US and he and us now we would love the father so much we be joined with him as joint heirs together partners on this life together on this journey together that we will be one with the Holy Ghost doing exactly what the Holy Ghost says to do in our lives amen that the glory of God might be in us amen and if you are lacking that right now if you are missing out on that your soul is crying out for the glory that you had with the father before the foundation of the world if you are missing that you're missing something amen if God doesn't come by your place and fellowship with you you're missing out on inheritance that was given to you amen if you haven't had an experience with God you're missing out on something that was given unto you God gave you an inheritance where's your inheritance why don't you have your inheritance God gave you something but you're missing out on it where's Jesus Christ's ascended up on high he led captivity captive amen and he gave gifts unto men amen and the so those gifts were he gave them to him apostles and prophets evangelists amen and all in the fivefold ministry why'd he give it to you for the perfecting of the Saints that the Word of God will go out over the pulpit amen we'll go out onto the people they would hear the word it would enter in through their ears into their mind they would consider it on the field of their mind and as they considered the Word of God they say that's the truth that's nothing but the truth I'd say Amen to it I believe that and as they begin to agree with the word that has preached it would drop from their mind down into their heart amen and they have began to realize oh my I am a son or a daughter of God oh my I have been separate I'm in this world but not of the world oh my I'm not the being I'm not a partaker of the evil this world but I've been separated from it and now I'm standing like I was in the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall I've been filled with the Holy Ghost I then you began to speak to him you'd be able to talk to him you'd begin to live with him you'd begin to be perfected in him why because now he is in you you are in him and the same love that existed between Jesus Christ and the father there now that same love is existing between you and him amen and you are united with your heavenly Father and you've been given power to become a son or a daughter of God amen and you're no longer you're a mystic to the world why because you're no longer of the lineage of your parents just like Jesus Christ says I was not just of Mary or of Joseph but I was the son of the Most High God and now you begin the same power to become a son or a daughter of God and you walk through this world fill with the Holy Ghost going wherever the Holy Ghost says go doing whatever the Holy Ghost says do a man when you go to witnesses someone words come out of your mouth that you didn't know we're in there Amen why because the Holy Spirit is still walking this earth drawing men and women to itself but now he's doing it through you and now you are the depository of the love of Jesus Christ on this earth and the same love that Jesus Christ have now you have and now you can love one another and all men will know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for the other amen why because you're no longer living with the evils of this world but now you can love with the same love that the thorah Jesus Christ had you've been changed from the creature that you wants one but now you have been changed into a son the son or daughter of God just like the Lord Jesus Christ you and him have become one if you have not had that experience then you've missed something somehow somewhere you've missed something and as your spirit cries out for it God has it here for you Amen just like any plant that is going through a dry or a desert time as it begins to cry out for water so as your soul cry out for the Living God Lord come and fill me with your Holy Ghost come Lord restore me back like it was in the Garden of Eden amen we're hues that's what Jesus Christ is doing he was crying out in that natural room for the Garden of Eden to return to the earth amen and we've been given that opportunity to live with the Lord Jesus Christ amen a mystic to the world that's why Christ came amen that the same glory that he had with the father would now be living inside of us amen and and and I can't stand the idea of missing something if God gave it to me like I say about the children of Israel almost everybody that left Egypt never got to actually experience the very reason they left Egypt forward and I'd hate to think that that was the same thing was true of our church here this morning that the very thing that Jesus Christ cried out for there and John 17 as we left the world and things of the world that somehow we would miss and turn into it what a shame it missed something God wants to live with you every day God wants to walk with you talk with you every day and if you don't have that type of relationship with him then you the what how can we look back at the chair is really think why didn't they believe Moses why didn't they do all do all they should do why didn't they just obey the word that Moses said why did they reject the the inheritance at Kadesh Barnea why didn't they just go into the Promised Land why were they so scared why were they so afraid why don't you pray every morning why don't you read your Bible why don't you ask the Holy Spirit what would you like to do Lord why don't you leave the world things of the world behind why don't you remove your hand from all the wicked things of this earth why aren't you you know we can't rebuke them too much because we are guilty of the same things amen but yet the same reward lays before you if we will enter into it amen amen when you begin to in your eyes oh I wish that our eyes could be open and we could begin to see that we are not just standing in the natural building but we are encompassed about with a cloud of witnesses of those have gone on before us amen than that those two have entered into the heavens already amen are beholding the throne of God and seeing these things and are shot around as a cloud of witnesses are saying come on keep going don't stop don't stop now there's a reward that lays at the end there is a there's a place beyond the river just keep going there's an inheritance is laid up for you Jesus Christ said I go to prepare a place for you and I will come back and receive you unto myself but when I come back will there be faith on the earth when I come back will there be ebuddy still standing on the earth when I come back well there me buddy keep themselves clean from the world when I come back will there be anybody praying with me when I come back will there be Ebay living in the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall amen because I sent my word unto the earth but did you listen to what I had said amen the pattern repeats itself over and over and over again we're still living in Bible days and people are still ignoring the prophets and God sends into the earth a man whoa unto us if we ignore the prophets they got sins into the earth we could look back and then and say why didn't they listen to the things that Moses said why don't we listen to the brother branham said amen amen amen I could just see them there one talking to the other you know oh did you hear what Moses said the other day no I was busy and I didn't have time to make it to our Moses was gonna be talking and and he said well yeah he said he had a word from the Most High God he gotten upon the mountain something that would prepare us for this journey of the promised land and well I you know I've just been a little busy and didn't really have time to listen to the things that Moses said but like why why did you ever leave do you even eat chips then why would you why would you even want to leave Egypt if you're not gonna listen to the one that's taking you on further and sometimes I wonder why are we even sitting here in this church if we won't listen to the things to take us on further into Christ it's like some of us are standing and beholding the things of heaven and some are just standing here looking at the natural walls of this room lord I pray that you would open up gazes eyes Amen that he might see the cloud of witnesses that standing around us amen and the glory that is available unto us amen verse 20 neither pray I for these alone or for them also that shall believe on me through their word that they may all be be one as thou father art and me and I in thee that they also may be one in us and I wonder do we have that same oneness with the Almighty all power all powerful God in the same way that Jesus Christ envisioned it because I want to experience life on this earth in the exact same way that Jesus Christ had in his mind but he was dying for me on Calvary now whatever Jesus Christ had in his mind when he was dying for me in Calvary that's why I want experience here on this earth because if I don't experience life in that way that I know that I'm missing something and I don't want to miss out on anything a man let's just stand the power of crying out to God Lord I don't want to miss anything amen if I have missed something of this experience of living in the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall and brother Brahim talked about the Lord I pray you to restore back to me right now amen let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer Heavenly Father as we pray father we see Lord that you knew full well the glory that you had with the father before the foundation of the world as you said here when you were here on the earth and Lord we are crying out Lord right now as we live our natural lives on this earth Lord we pray that we'd be separated from the world or the things of the world as you said that we could be separate from the evil that is on this world but we could live in the glory of God and father I pray Lord if there be anybody here amongst us Lord that somehow is missed out on living at oneness with you having the glory of God Lord that you would reveal them to them just now that the power of the Almighty God might overshadow them Lord that they could be be given that power to be the sons or daughters of God and then Lord that they would be a mystic to the world living Lord reporting to service every day Lord Lord what would you like to do this day father how can I live with you how can I live with you on this life Lord how can I be filled with the Holy Ghost again refilled Lord Lord because I want to be about my father's business Laura that's why we came on this journey or we didn't come to see how far away from you we could live and still make it but Laura won't be as close to you as we can Lord if we've missed something upon this journey we pray Lord that you would restore it unto us and just now in the name with Lord Jesus Christ as our souls cry out to you Lord as a Alea as a plant in the dry and thirsty land cries out for the living water Laura saw our soul cries out unto you Lord restore us back to the condition that we're supposed to be in Lord Laura that would be filled with the Holy Ghost Lord that the we'd be filled with the glory of God because all we don't want to miss anything Lord whatever you had mind you died for us on Calvary we pray you to fill us with it Lord we our heart cries out for it Lord we just want to thank you Lord for giving us all things and we just thank you Father we submit ourselves unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen brother
