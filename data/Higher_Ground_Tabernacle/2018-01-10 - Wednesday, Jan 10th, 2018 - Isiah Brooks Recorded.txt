myself that where I am there you may be also whether I go you know and the way you know Amen let's turn to the book of revelations chapter 21 start with the first verse it says and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men he shall dwell with them they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God a man Isis power has one more time Heavenly Father we just commit these words and your able hands father knowing that you are able to give the utterance just as much as what you

Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen I don't think you could have picked a better song brother amen amen I appreciate brother Isaac led of the Holy Spirit amen amen so I just wanted to speak a message this evening hail Christ and his bride amen he's he's gone to prepare a place for us amen if he goes from here a place for us he says I will come again and I will receive you unto myself a mess not that he's left us alone to slog things out with ourselves no he's had a plan the entire time amen since before the foundation of the world he has had a plan for every minute of our lives he is not worried he is not concerned jesus is not up there wringing his hands wondering what he's gonna do with our situation you know it's one thing like if my children you know if if one of them does something wrong if one of them does something that I like if I tell them to do one thing and they go and do something contrary to that you know I'm never gonna take my children and SCIM to prison for life you know here in this nation you know someone they they they do they do a certain wrong or something wicked or something evil and and we take them to the judge and we say they done this this and the penalty of this particular thing that's against the law the penalty is ten years twenty years thirty years or even life in prison and the judge will look at that man in the eye and say I hereby condemn you to a life in prison for the sins that you have done but it's not that way with Christ and his bride a men who and we when Christ he looks at his bride when we do something wrong he he looks upon us with mercy we were pin of it and he's never going to take his children and place them in a life in prison Amen he always has a way provided for his children to come back out of the condition that they are in they meant yet from before the foundation of the world eople it he put our names upon the Lamb's Book of Life and he slew a lamb for those names that if any of those names that are ever in need of forgiveness or mercy or grace that all they have to do is cry out for the blood of that lamb amen and any one of those names that is written upon the Lamb's Book of Life all you I do is cry out for the blood of that lamb and when Christ looks down and mercy at his children he said he says I will forgive you of that I'll forgive you for this I'll forgive you for that amen he won't sit ins you for a lot to life in prison but he says I will have mercy upon you amen amen you know ever since we've come upon this journey you know we first hear the gospel you know maybe we don't know exactly where it's going you know we don't know exactly what it is we hear that there was a God in heaven and then he has a plan we hear but that there's a that there is a heaven he has a place for us that he's gone prepared amen when we hear the story about how he died upon the cross amen and it looks new it's a pleasant thing and you only think my I just there's something that rings down on the inside you know you don't have the full revelation of it you know when you first CONUS your you don't know exactly where it's going you don't know what it's doing me you know one thing's for sure I gotta go that way amen when Christ first reveals himself to you I mean when Christ first begins to reveal his word to you it does something down on the inside that maybe you don't have the understanding maybe you don't know what it is the one thing for sure you know that's the direction that I'm going a man that's that's where I'm headed that's I don't know what I don't know what it means I don't know what all it's about but I'm gonna go that way a man who just walk in the light as he isn't alike and you just keep walking and you learn more you learn more and Christ begins revealing more of his word to you and revealing more of his word to you and as you begin to see his goodness and his mercy and you begin to worship him they begin to praise him it becomes more and more beautiful to you a man you know it's the thing about is you know is is when you're in the flesh when you're in the things of Satan sin is attractive you know and sin this that sin looks beautiful and when you're in the world and you love the things of the world and you're and you're in your whatever Satan puts across your mind to do and you go and do it before you're converted you know and and you just say and you go this and all those things I look there's something flashing in front of your eyes something attractive and you run over here and do this do you think why did I do such a thing you're run over here and do this you think why did I do such a thing and your heart you know condemns you and you know it but then when you meet Christ then when Christ begins to rule you and draw you all sudden the things of the world become strangely dim and you begin to hate those things more and how those things used to attract you now they just don't seem to attract you anymore and now your affections are set upon things that are above a man in Christ becomes attractive to you a man the Holy Spirit becomes attractive to you church service has become attractive to you you begin to love the things of the Lord you open up the Bible whole sudden you know used to be just a dry dusty book sitting on the Shelf but all of a sudden something just I don't you ever had the experience you know where you open it you're reading also just takes your breath away like oh my I never saw it this way before you know and you know there's there's been times to be reading in the Bible all saying like oh my brother Brandon was sitting right here when he saw this st. Paul was reading this and he caught the revelant and this is where he got that revelation you know or you know and just you know Peter was reading the Old Testament oh this is where Peter was reading when he got that revelation you know and this is why he was able to write this or write that amen and it just it does something to you amen and the beginning of the revelation of Christ all through your life's journey as Christ has become more and more revealed unto you he becomes more and more attractive to you and more and more beautiful to you Amen what is it it's a it's a love affair Amen it's a love affair it's it's it's like a man with a when he first meets a girl you know and he and he so I'd like to get to know this girl better and they get to know and he he falls in love with her and that love changes throughout life and you know the love you have for a girl as a teenager or changes as you get in your 20s and when you get married or the first decade the second decade third decade it changes and it changes why it's growing more and more mature and so is our love with Christ growing more and more mature in him amen as we get to know him more we begin to see what he's capable of how much he really does love us you know you know though I remember you know there's times really my walk that I thought I was ready for the rapture amen and then you go through a fury time of temptations and battles and snares and you want to where am I at now you know and and then you only come out on the other side he just loved him all the more a man and now you'reyou're relate you're a lot more settled in Christ a man you go through the hard battles the hard times or or you go through the mountaintop experience is where you need God to meet you in the field of action and all of a sudden he comes down right there and he meets you right there and he does something that you couldn't do for yourself something you weren't even worthy of and and something you you're right in the moment and when you were at your weakest moment he becomes strongest allies amen and just saying just sit it just makes you love them all the more ami of the times when you're not even worthy of having your prayers answered amen the times when when you you're not even worthy of him even listening to you and he comes and he answers your prayer anywhere or or gives you a blessing anyhow a man gives you something you weren't even looking for and it's just times like that you know it just makes you love him even more amen amen when your eyes are opened your Christ becomes more and more attractive amen amen all of creation is waiting for the manifestation of Christ just as much or just as much as we are waiting for the manifestation of Christ all creation is waiting for the manifestation of his bride a man just as much all creation is looking for his bride to be manifested amen all creation is waiting for that and we are waiting for the manifold manifestation of Christ in us we're waiting so that Christ has such the preeminence in this body of flesh that all us do is just one little not one little nudge from Christ and we're gone we're off about our father's business we are waiting for that time where Christ is so revealed in us that Christ has such the such sway over our bodies that we have surrendered so much to Christ that all Christ has to do is say I want you to go this and we say yes Lord we'll go do that but off we are know about our father's business Amen that's what we're waiting for that and earth is waiting for that amen installing the psalmist says Christ speaking about his bride says as the lily among the thorns so is my love among the daughters then the bride speaks back to the next verse it says as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons were unique to Christ we are unique to Christ why we have his own nature his own Spirit inside of us amen you know no man wants to marry someone who doesn't think like him doesn't act like him doesn't doesn't doesn't want to be with him no man wants to marry a woman that has nothing to do with him isn't interested in things that he's interested in a man a woman once our man wants to marry a woman that thinks like he thinks it has things in common amen and the only way Christ is never gonna get a bride on this earth is if it's a somehow some way she think has things in common with him a man there's no way that man can think like God thinks unless somehow some way she be endued with power from on high and so somehow his thinking comes down on the inside and that a sort of some way somehow his thinking comes down on the inside and all sudden it's a supernatural thing God said we cannot think like man like God thinks because his ways are higher than our ways a man but then he said that we have the mind of Christ amen oh my is it shows that something is taking place something is happening stir the brew and a bride begins to think like Christ thinks begin to love like Christ loves why we like we like I said we have we have we have what the faith we believe like Christ believes a man we have we have knowledge and temperance we have patience like God has patience we have godliness to act like God when when just like brother brand you know when Adam wait to go name all the animals when he named him you know what he named well he named him just the same thing as if God was going to name Amen you know good God will looked at Adam and Eve naming the animals and and and you know what and God says you know if I was to name that animal monkey that's exactly what I would have named it if I was to give that attribute that animal without thinking that I don't know that's exactly what I would have done why I guess Adam was about his father's business he had the attribute of his father on the inside and he did the things that his father his about his father's business amen those attributes are to be claimed upon this earth those attributes are to be endued in bodies of flesh those attributes are to be manifested here on the earth amen all of Earth is waiting for that man station Amen you know you think about a few have seen the the pictures of like those cities in China that are just overtaking the smog and pollution you know and you see the the people walking around with masks over their face they have areas buildings set there like bars but instead of giving an alcohol they give out fresh air and they give out like flavored oxygen and they pump it through this special sense and everything you can go and escape the pollution that's in the air and going there and take a breath of fresh air and they have a little fresh air booths along the city it's like a bus stop and you can walk into this fresh air booth and get a brush or fret they're fresh air and let me tell you ever I think had to think about this every plant every tree every weed every every flower in that city is waiting for a manifestation for a brush for just a breath of fresh air it's just all the DNA of all those plants is waiting for the manifestation of fresh air upon that city all the people are waiting for that pollution to be gone they're not they weren't meant to wear masks upon their faces but their whole bodies are crying out for a brush for just a breath of fresh air they're waiting and so is the earth waiting for a breath of fresh air wait for a special atmosphere a special oxygen so the DNA down on the inside can manifest exactly what was written down on the inside and so is the Bride of Christ waiting for an atmosphere waiting for a atmosphere that's down on the inside of down in the Holies of Holies it's a special place it's a special atmosphere if they can only be found in one place and the Holies of Holies when you eat you're in and the and the and the curtain comes down behind you and you begin to realize them not just in a not just in a natural place I'm not just in a man-made atmosphere but I'm in a atmosphere azzaman charged by the presence of the Most High God a place where anything can happen a place has been designed by God you think down in China where a man by his wisdom to design a place so that people can become what they're supposed to be so the people can be clear-headed and think the way they're supposed to think to have oxygen the way they're supposed to have oxygen a man and his intelligence has to create a place for people to go but so God in His wisdom and this place of sin and pollution has designed a place for his bride to escape to a place in the Holies of Holies where she can go and escape sin and pollution where she can go and escape and get away from all the things that are all around us and surrounding us and she can go into that Holies of Holies and the curtain closes behind her and when she enters into that place her DNA just takes a quick deep breath and it relaxes and it begins thinking the way it was designed to think her broad he begins to act the way is designed to act her affections are set on the things above and she because the love the way that she's supposed to love she begins to have a compassion the way she's supposed to have compassion all of her spiritual DNA begins to act the way it's supposed to act she looks upon her brothers the sisters the way she's supposed to look upon her brothers and sisters maybe she looks upon the loss the way she's supposed to look upon the lost why because the things of the earth are closed off behind her a man and she's in a special atmosphere she is being changed from glory unto glory amen amen Sunday I wanted to get into the adoption you know I've been listening to those adoption seriesin and I felt like I got right to the border but I couldn't quite get into it sunday a man I had in mind that this evening that I would preach I wanted to preach on the adoption and when I when I got down to study and it just seemed like everything was against me studying like working a lot of hours this week today I worked 12 hours and went in at 4:30 this morning and I just all I wanted to study for the study for listen and and when I thought well I'm going to study that adoption service I'm gonna study that adoption series and when I got into the room it seems like they just went a completely different way but yet it was all still linked together amen amen and so I start instead of getting to the Dobson series I started getting into the oh the heavenly City the New Jerusalem I can't run the name of the sermon all of a sudden but um the future home for the Amen I started reading through there and it just seemed like it was just all coming together amen so the bride is being prepared amen she is she is removing herself more and more from the influences of this earth amen and she is gathering herself into the influences of heaven amen as she is rejecting the things of the earth more and more and cotton is coming less more less from the negative and more towards the positive and she spends more and more time in the atmosphere that she was designed to live in more and more time in that heavenly atmosphere she begins to be changed from glory to glory what is she she is being shaped in that pyramid that we always talk about she is growing up and growing up she was designed to be in that shape he's designed to be in that shape yes designed to have that faith as the as the as the the foundation the foundation she's designed she has to have that foundation let me tell you Saints if you can't if you can't believe if you can't believe in Christ if he can't believe that he'll take care of you if they can't believe that he will fulfill his word if you can't believe that he'll fulfill every moment of the word if you can't hang your soul and every word and is in this book then you got it you got to start right there amen if you didn't tell you get that faith that God is gonna keep his word amen that God is is is heaven bound to to complete every bit of this word and all heaven is behind you to fulfill this word amen all the all the powers in heaven is behind you to fulfill what is on the inside of this book a man you got to have faith behind you to push you into that amen and when you get that you you you you're built you're on a solid foundation just like Abraham now you are entering into Abraham as Abraham walked in that city it didn't walked around that land as a promised land but there was nothing built there yet amen so what'd he do he walked around that land and faith nothing was built there yet there was no there was no place he he met the mayor of the city but he didn't find the city so he met Melchizedek but where was the city milk his neck was from I he's looking he's gotta be around here somewhere but where is it but he walked around there in faith faith was the foundation he walked around there in faith and as he kept building upon that building upon that building upon that he was building a city and he didn't even know it amen hey man one of these days that city is gonna come down and it's gonna can't let it comes down it'll be in the exact same shape as what Abraham built think about that the city that comes down will be in the same shape as the city that Abraham was built through the attributes that he had it on the inside the Abraham faith and so is the bride in the same way the same faith that she has that city will come down in the same shape that we are building here on the earth down on the inside the Holy Spirit adding attribute to a true attribute to attribute think about Christ when he came here did he have faith a man now what was now let's think about what was Christ Christ means The Anointed One amen so so Christ was formed in the in the womb of Mary there created that word of God created there placed that blood cell placed down on the inside of Mary not by the act of man but by the act of God placed there and what was it it was given a body a body was prepared and what came forth a man child a man child what was it what went and as and as now I did now I did Jesus Christ eat of the fruits of the earth he did he grew up in wisdom in nature and as he is growing his body was partaking of the fruits of the earth and things and he was growing up and growing up now remember the earth was cursed the earth was cursed so here's this portion of the earth is walking around its anointed as Christ the Anointed One and he's eating the fruit of the land he's growing up stronger physically stronger physically growing up growing up growing up and what is this earth that's walking on Christ God Himself is redeeming a part of the earth he the Holy Spirit is ruling over this part of the earth he's staking his claim Satan has held this earth for so long but Satan has to give way and Satan would come to to tempt that portion of the earth amen and now that now this earth is encased in a body a man in the skin of the Lord Jesus Christ and as this earth is he takes of this fruit here and this fruit here and he eats this and it becomes down on the inside and the DNA on the inside has taken this I'm gonna take some of this I'm gonna take some of this he's drawing it to himself and drawing it to himself when it comes in cased upon inside the skin of the Lord Jesus Christ God is drawing a part of the earth to be ready he's drawing a part of the earth to be redeemed and so as I do and all of a sudden son one day the Holy Spirit comes down like a dove from God out of heaven and a voice rings out this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and you know Aaron everybody was commanded listen to my son listen to him listen to what he has to say hear ye him he was being placed he was being adopted he was being placed upon the earth this portion of the earth has sealed it is this is mine I have claimed it and what did he and what it Satan do why did the men of the earth do they rejected it this very earth that Satan had worked so hard to claim for himself to to rich the earth away from the grasp of God to pollute it with his own action and then he took a very portion of the earth and he rejected and says we don't want this we don't want this we don't want this and he anointed the Pharisees and the Sadducees God's own people and and they looked at him and says we don't want this we don't want this and they took this body of the earth and they place it and they lift it up and place it up on the cross amen he hung there between heaven and earth placed up there in the space we rejected a man saying we don't want this earth anymore and Satan sign away his rights says we don't want this anymore ain't it and you basically take this back we don't want it and this part of the earth and God says I will take that back and it was redeemed and he and what does it do it just like Joshua just like Joshua said me the Lord told Joshua everywhere the soles of your feet go is possession everywhere the soles of your feet go where you go if you step here it's yours if you step here it's yours if you step here it's yours every little bit was possession possession of the land and so now Joshua the new Joshua Jesus Christ the word the name Jesus is the old Hebrew Joshua Jehovah saves Jehovah is saving his people through this body of flesh when Christ came down in tabernacle and man and what's he doing everywhere he steps his possession when he met the woman in the well he possession when he met this one here possession he grabbed the twelve the eleven there he possessed them amen and I want to put de Pentecost he possessed him hey where'd he go from there he went down to the gates of hell he possessed the gates of Hell a bit where to go to paradise he possessed all the saints that were there it went up to heaven and he possessed there he walked the land he says I'm claiming this he walked over power all over Palestine I'm claiming this land I'm going to prepare a place and it's gonna come down and land right here and I'm walking just like Abraham walked so Christ walked in the same land in faith saying I am claiming this for the kingdom of God for my kingdom amen where I'm going they told the sciples they said oh is the kingdom of heaven coming he says doesn't come with observation but don't you worry don't you fear I am going to prepare a place for you and I will come again and I will receive you a man he wasn't gone but more in 60 years and all son John was Milan to Patmos they've been preaching the Word of God and preaching the Word of God and you know he's getting old and getting old and getting old and nine years old and still preaching the gospel and our Lord says don't you worry don't you fear I have I had the place that you have prepared a place I've gone prepare for you it will come down like a bride prepare from God out of heaven but think it is when it comes out we will be prepared the same way that the city was preparing amen why because Christ is going to have a bride that thinks like he thinks acts like he acts loves like he loves she'll be prepared why for her husband the Bible says that that city who came down from God out of heaven was adorned for her husband it says she was a door of the city was adorned like a bride was adorned for her husband she was not adorned for any other man she was not she was not closed for anything else she wasn't clothed for the the heathen she wasn't clothed for other men to look at she was adorned for one thing for her husband a man essaouira we we are adorned for one thing our husband every attribute that God is placing down on the inside he's placing it there for himself why so that we might be in a condition a man to be a betrothed unto Him amen that's why the Holy Spirit keeps ruling us and wooing us and woo yes amen that's why he at least when we do something wrong he convicts us it's not that he wants to cast us aside no he wants us to make the thing right so he can look like him Amen so we're looking like him more and more going from the negative to the positive amen amen think about it you know you go to the forest you see a perfect tree you're seeing oak tree that's out in the middle of a field as branches are just going way out way out way out and it's beautiful you know I heard I heard a long time ago that uh that the scientists can go through a forest here in Iowa Iowa used to be all Prairie 150 years ago it was just Prairie and and the men came down and we tore up all the prairies and playing in crops and and then some places forests grew where it used to be Prairie and and they had Oaks in the Prairie and every once while they were just scattered one here and one there one there and the scientists can go to a to a place and if they see hope it's 150 200 years old they can tell they grew up in a prairie even though now it might be in a forest because they can see that branches are schooling straight out way way out well it was encumbered by the surrounding trees when it grew up and it's and they can say this tree grew up way back when Iowa is just Prairie and now it's been encroached with all the trees around it but it wasn't originally as designed to be in a Prairie a man and you see the trees that when they're the most beautiful you know they're they're doing exactly what their DNA down on the inside said they should look like a man you know and the oak tree was not around here wasn't designed to be pinned up around all the other trees it was designed to live by itself alone and to be the Sentinel you know upon the prairies and amen and you own where does a tree look most beautiful isn't when it's a seat there's when it's when it's growing up as a there's just a sprout or is it when it's fully grown when it's fully grown when it's coming up into the majesty of what it's supposed to be a man so is the Bride of Christ we're we're we're at our most beautiful crisis come back for a beautiful bride and the bride was most beautiful and she's fully formed when she has all the attributes amen they're supposed to be there everything that the spiritual DNA said we were supposed to have amen the but when the DNA says were supposed to be patient we're supposed to be kind to one another we're supposed to think like God thinks we're supposed to take the Bible and say you know this is what the Bible says walk in it amen and that's that's when we are at her best is not when we're taking the words of man a man not when we're taking the temptation of the devil but when we were walking forth in the power of the Almighty God a man think about it when John was there on the Isle of Patmos and the angel came down and says come here I want to show you something what was he doing the angel wanted to brag about something think about it the britannians wanted to show something off I've shown you loss I showed you a lot of things John but now I want to show you something that's really amazing something that's really you you're gonna love this John I want to show you something come look he says I look and I saw a holy city coming down a door and like a bride was adorned for her husband anyway he says look it's a great city he starts using always act as you just described it's a great city it's it's holiness it's got all the holiness of God it said its it has a light about it that's like a precious stone like a light coming off of a diamond a man has it says is full of all the glory of God why was it why was it so glorious because all the attributes of Christ were being displayed all about her all about her every attribute in its place everything was placed exactly where we're supposed to be amen same thing with the building of a pyramid you know when the stones are down there at the quarry are they beautiful when they're there not so much when they're and when they when they're coming up here and they're being shaped are they beautiful they're not so much but it's when they get placed when they get placed where they're supposed to be then they begin to have the glory of the designer upon it amen the glory of that divine architect when the divine architect has plate said this is where that stone is supposed to be shaped like this and this is where it's supposed to be placed and when that stone gets to its final place then that's when its most glorious amen and we are designed to be placed somewhere a man that's what we're talking about adoption now where there's a place that we're supposed to be all of us have a place in the body that we are supposed to be and until we get to that we cannot show forth the glory of God amen we are supposed to show forth the glory of our Creator the glory of that divine architect that has the divine blueprints that he has the idea that from way back before the foundation of the world when he designed the earth he designed the people he designed everything this is where they're supposed to be placed this is what they're supposed to do and when we go forth we can go forth out of here walking through a sin dwelt land but fulfilling the will of God think about that think about that we can walk through a city Oh what you imagine this look at this the way I'm looking at it if you could take two completely different two completely different playing fields two dimensions and you have the dimension here that is full of sin and unbelief and things are moving around and evil spirits going this way and that way and and men doing wicked things and I need transpose another dimension on top of it there's full of holiness and righteousness and the power of the Almighty God and angels going here and there and the the Bride of Christ doing this and that and you can begin to see how Christ could walk through walls and do different things why because he was in this dimension that was there was there was there was a godly who wasn't necessarily in the dimension he wasn't bound to the dimension of sin he was bound to the dimension of heaven and heaven an earth where we're mixing they're coming in that in the same plane the one was transposed upon the other so is the Bride of Christ we're not supposed to be dwelling in this dimension here we're supposed to be sitting in heavenly places we're going more from the negative to the positive a man as we walked through we're walking through this sin sin born land but we're not of this sin born land or of this other dimension that's that's blending into Earth amen and as we walk here walk there we're not walking according to the blueprint of this we're walking according to the blueprint ayman as we become more in tune with this people say that's a strange guy why does he do this why does he do that why is this person acting like this why is this person acting like that because he's acting like what's written in here amen he's from another dimension he's acting according to what is being transposed over here and people like why do you do this why do you that I do this for the glory and honor of Lord Jesus Christ I do this in the name of the kingdom that I serve I'm not from this earthly kingdom I'm from the heavenly kingdom and I am acting according to its laws and according to its rules I'm acting according to the law of faith I'm acting according to the law of virtue I'm acting according to the law of heavenly knowledge a man to know that God will always keep his word amen and I and I take that and win and when the thoughts of this dimension begin giving forth their word saying it has this person is sick it has to die we take forth this word and says there in the name of Jesus Christ he's healed a man when Satan comes brings horse to temptation you have to bow down to my temptation we come and forth with the word and we hear they walking in this over here and says we're like I bowed out into that temptation Amen why because we are more over here instead of over there be at the two dimensions are just right on top heaven isn't way up there is just heaven just over the doorpost amen amen and what do we do we're blending into we're going less from over there and more over there as we get as the things of world become strangely dim we get further further into Christ as you enter into the Holies of Holies and you're in that atmosphere a man is you're in that atmosphere now you begin to see things like Christ sees things Amen you know that we said you know a dog a man a dog marries a dog a horse marries a horse a man marries a man but if Christ has a bride what nature will she be and how does she get there but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen by the virtue of the Holy Spirit down on the inside and how do we form our hi we get our flesh to conform to that nature by entering into the Holies of Holies amen and that's the only way by spending the time in the presence we are changed from glory unto glory amen the God and me loves the God and you and you are so easy to love amen amen Christ walked upon this earth and he was rejected the word spoke from outside of him but every time that word spoke it was rejected it was rejected it was rejected over and over again the word rejected until they finally took the word and they hung it up on the cross and said we don't want this word anymore but we are standing here as emissaries of Christ as an ambassador or saying now we are in the same position we have taken the word down on the inside thy word is written upon to the tables of my heart and we are now being rejected by the earth and we were rejected and rejected and rejected and one of these days as we will leave this earth behind in a growl sure why because the earth says we don't want them anymore there will be so will be so so more like the word and so unlike the world that one of those days that the as they are receiving the mark of the beast we are receiving the mark of Christ amen one of these days we so much like Christ the God says watch you just walk on up here and like Enoch said as Wooper Enoch I knock had that perfect walk he walked with God he had the perfect testimony in Jude says he had this testimony that everything that he did he was pleasing to God and one of those days after 365 years Enoch was walking along and also he just started walking a little bit higher a little bit higher and all sign the Eagan Hawk was not why because God called him home a man so we'll be with the Bride of Christ that is we accept the Holy Ghost more and reject the world more that one of these days that heaven will cry why she just come on up home a man why don't you just come on up home I got to purify this earth so if my city can come down a man you don't have to be judged with the world and the great white throne judgment because you've already received judgment in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God manifested in the earth again you know in the flesh of us a man when we receive our adoption when the Holy Spirit descends down on us amen and we are placed where we're supposed to be we're building our pyramid we are building our heavenly city our Heavenly Mountain even as Caleb and Joshua Joshua they walk through the land the footsteps his possession and Kaila right there with him he says give me my Mountain so it was the Bride of Christ what'd she say give me my Mountain give it to me she says give me my faith give you my virtue give me my knowledge give me my temperance give me my patience my godly it's my brotherly kindness give me that divine love where Christ comes down and seals the whole thing off and what'd she say she says give it to me footsteps is possession I am claiming I need a little bit more faith floored I am claiming in this faith for the gospel of Lord Jesus Christ I am claiming everything every virtue you have why so I can be about my father's business amen what are you doing you're possessing the gates of the enemy amen everywhere you go your footsteps are possessing it Lord I'm claiming this for the Gospels sake amen every attribute of Christ if you'll give me Lord I am claiming it for the Gospels sake amen what would we do we'll be rejected in the earth a man through the fires of temptation then the Holy Spirit descends down like a go like a dove and Lord says this is my beloved son hear ye him amen that's why that's when your when your when your work when your signature on the cheque book that's when that's when when you can write out the checkbook why because Christ signed it with his own blood amen the city will match the occupants the righteous city bowl of the glory of God will be is created that way why because the city has to match the occupants amen I want you to think about it we here as americans we're proud of our Constitution you know we as Americans we think that's a it's an amazing document there's there's nothing else like it you know you take that that document they've spent millions of dollars just preserving that document building a special housing for it to sit in and then a special bomb-proof shelter around it you know and alright cuz they want to protect that document who we think it's a special thing whoever wrote all the men they wrote that we think that's that's printed all the the ideas are enshrined upon that that document in the Constitution of the United States but as good as that Constitution is you take a country that's full corruption and take and transpose the laws that are enshrined and that Constitution it and try to enforce upon that other country it'll never work it'll never work they can't work because the morals of the country are what make that work that that Constitution can have no effect unless the morals that give it power unless the spirit of the people I can give that Constitution power to transform their country so what is the what is more important the paper that is written fun or the morals or the the spirit of the people even so this book is is written and enshrined and people like oh you know we're gonna swear up on a stack of Bibles but and tell the morals that are written on here I tell the spirit the wrote that writes upon our own hearts then will be like a another country somewhere all full corruption then this can never can never transform the country can never transform the land but once free people are gonna submit themselves unto the rule of this law until the rule of the Holy Ghost until the spirit that that wrote this word and then submit themselves under that spirit then we begin to be changed amen because this book by itself can change no one Amen but if the spirit of this book because the descend a power person and begins ruling over them then a people can be transformed amen amen the city comes down from heaven like a dove to claim every attribute those in the earth God has placed his attributes he hasn't reserved unto himself every attribute that he for ordained that he predestinated before the foundation of the world the very reason he created this earth in the first place you know he didn't create this earth be there he created this earth that attributes of his own self could live and reign upon this earth and those attributes are a gift they are given to men and women that they might take those attributes and live them out upon this earth amen and we have the we we have the being predestinated to live out these attributes upon the earth amen and now we have an opportunity in the midst of this inborn world to act out these attributes now not to wait as I had a pastor to tell me once he says I don't believe adoption happen something happens as is as described in the Bible I don't believe that happens until we get up there he says that's that's for way up there I know there's something about it I just I don't have anything within me they can take these promises and place them somewhere else I just I just I claim them for myself even the rapture even the rapture I claim the rapture for myself I claim the second coming for myself I claim the Isle enter into his gates with Thanksgiving I only turn into his courts with praise I claim that for myself I claim the holiest of holies for myself I claim it for my for my privilege for my uses why because God has allowed me to wife does he place an ask you down on the insight that must be manifested and that attribute must find its place because it will not be attractive until it finds its place it will not fulfill its purpose until it finds its place but God's gifts always find their places amen all every stone will find its place when it's placed exactly where it belongs amen amen amen amen what do we do we end up typing out the city what are we doing we're fulfilling our portion down here so that lid is up there enjoying with what's down here amen so what will be United heaven on earth will be night once again a man's blood ran says heaven and earth has kissed amen they as a husband Brian they've come together at one amen that attribute up there marries with this down here amen from the negative to the positive amen that's how that's how men walk through walls that's how men walk through doors that's how that's how these things happen that's how the supernatural happens why because this over here blends with this over here why because that which was rejected the part of the earth that was rejected by Satan when he said I don't want this part of the earth he gave up his rights Satan gave up his rights when he hung that upon the cross we hung Christ upon the cross he was giving up his rights we don't want this we don't want any part of this and so God out of that body out of out of that is creating and molding our people for his name's sake I go to prepare a place for you he said Amen and out of that was he doing he prepares a place for him on himself a man a man a bride he is created just like just like Adam and Eve out of Christ was pulled out e for his own self and then that which was pulled out was joined back together and the two became one flesh and what God has joined together let not man let not man put asunder and even so what Christ has joined us to himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost no man can't put asunder why it's a marriage relationship were bound together Amen by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen the rejected earth and Christ was rejected Amen of the sin born earth we were rejected because we were in him a man when you count yourself in him and you're no longer part of the sin Boehner Amen Europe heavenly places amen and then the city comes down what is he doing he cleanses the whole city is the sin wasn't made for Satan so he cleanses that all wipes it all off restores it and brings this city back down for his bride to dwelling amen amen the divine architect has made a way for us amen baby man let's just stand and I just wanted to read a quote here brother branham's it says he said there in future home he says notice that Jesus said John 14 now going prepare plates Oh what will it look like did you ever think now bride what it will look he is calling us right he said did you ever think now bride what will it look like it was prepared and designed by the divine architect what will that city look like now we're going to talk about it for a few minutes the divine architect has prepared it designed it and look is designed it with tender hands or his beloved bride what's it going to look like can you imagine a man marrying his wife that's able that he's financially able how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch just what she would like everything she would want a mint now the divine architect has designed the new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch he designed the future home to exactly what she would want amen no wonder the Apostle said I has not seen ear is not heard for neither has an ear turn into the heart of man let's look and see if we can probe into a promo see what it's going to look like the divine architect has does designed this or his beloved he is what a place it must be when a divine nature a divine nature a divine architect has designed it for a divine attribute that's been divinely predestinated by a divine God who is the author of divine life what will s say you look like no this isn't even designed for us I will go and prepare a place for you and I'll go and claim it for you but he says I placed the divine attribute on the inside amen amen remember it's not heaven Jesus John said I saw coming down out of heaven it's to be on the earth amen amen I want to sit down something here good get to it I'm not seeing it right now but say it's like all the glory of God we we enter into the Holies of Holies when you go in those places in prayer and you're in all over the word and and then you're just an amazing to the gospel that's still does not even prepare the glory that should be revealed in us amen cuz is we still just not even touch the surface of what God has prepared for let me just encourage you someone once told me he says it's worth it you know hey man this is worth it don't let yourself get blinded by the things of this earth that that these things are not actual truth that this is actually going to happen amen it's not that we're gonna win the lottery we've already won we've already there we don't have to win the lottery we were born with this amen we are born again with Christ amen we you know we're rich we have a hell of the atmosphere it says these things are ours they belong to us and we cannot fear we have to have faith to go and clean amen Abraham he he walked through the land that with that foundation of faith but he didn't get to see the city Amen until later hey I trust you seen the city now amen but now but now we get to see this you know I don't believe it's gonna be long israel's been a nation now this this year will be seventy years this is real became a nation this coming May seven years God said that he would your darling back together on the wings of an eagle as they've done it we're way past the end of the the last threads of the Gentile age amen when when the grace will swing back to the Jews again for the three and a half year we're right on the cusp of that where we stand where are we living in a man we're sending her wedding ready wife we think for the gospel you fulfill amen but God wants to prepare this down on the inside of us a man let's just submit that by stayin in the divine atmosphere Amen submitting themselves on Christ a man as a bride amen and we might be a man Heavenly Father I just want to thank Lord your gospel Lord I maybe this was a mysterious sermon to some or mysterious message Laura these I has not seen nor heard heard what you've prepared for us Lord and I I know that the truth of it all is is beyond what we could even grasp father the Lord you revealed with these things unto us by your spirit and lord I pray you'd open our eyes to the things of heaven Lord and close our eyes to the things of Satan and sin more or that we might might be joined together with you father's would be more heavily minded and less earthly my lord I just thank you Lord for for this message I know if you bring the message you also bring fulfillment of it and I know that you are able Lord we're looking for it Lord we're not looking for it in doubt relic afford in wondering is it going to happen to me

finish the work on school we thank you for filming and the name of Jesus Christ you play
