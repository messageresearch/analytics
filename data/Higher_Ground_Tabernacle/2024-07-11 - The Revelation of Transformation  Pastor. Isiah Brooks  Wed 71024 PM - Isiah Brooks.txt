Hallelujah and all the promises of God are true we love the Lord we love the Lord we thank God for his grace and his mercy God for seeing our precious brother josua again glad you made it I heard you Circle the building a little bit forgot to tell you about every behind but we're glad to see everybody here tonight let's turn to our Bibles in our Bibles we're going to start reading from uh uh Romans the 4th chapter uh we'll begin at at the first verse God is so good Romans the 4th chapter ROM beginning at the first verse what shall we say then that a Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh have found for If Abraham was justified by works he had whereof to Glory but not before God what sayth the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness [Music] now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquity are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin blessed this uh blessedness I mean cometh excuse me this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision in and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but all but who also walk in the steps of that Faith yes of Our Father which Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised that's just okay go ahead instead of keeping you standing let let's have a word of prayer our gracious father God we come before you Lord we thank you for this Amazing Grace Lord you have been so good to us and you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and we pray father God that you would be merciful to us we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and we thank you for your love divine bless this service in a special way in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I'm going to continue to read by the grace of God 13th verse for the promise that he should be be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of for if they which are of the law be HS faith is made void and the promise made of non effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by Grace Amen to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were this is what I like who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith amen he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through Hallelujah but was strong in faith giving glory to God I could read this whole chapter 21st verse and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform ain't God good I just want to pray one more time you just bow your head where you are father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for the reading of your holy word Lord there is none like you oh God we thank you Father God for being so good to us you are better to us than we could possibly be to ourselves Lord I Thank you for this beautiful Redemption plan hallelujah what a mighty God we [Music] serve thank you Lord bless this audience Bless the people of God break whatever yolks Lord hallelujah speak through this vessel of clay whatever you would have your people to know in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated we thank God for his goodness and I'm just going to take my time tonight I'll try my best anyway but i' like to entitle this message the revelation of transformation and this uh transformation can only be done by and through faith in the promises of God when we think about a transformation the definition of it is to make a thorough or to make a thorough or dramatic change in the form appearance or character and the only way this could ever be established in the heart of the people God has to drop a faith in the heart of the people a faith that will believe every word it's not about what we think about it it's about what God has said about it one thing I love about brother brandham he lived by what God saw or would see if he had lived by his natural birth what he he his father was what his mother was you know what I'm saying that old genealogy uh we would have never had a message like we have now and I want to say this to uh everybody here tonight you must understand that in brother Bram he had a war know what kind of a background he had and to know and to believe what God said he was you got to understand that there was really no place in him that would push out his chest to make himself something when he always saw himself as being nothing and that's what he he said there were even people or children in his own dat day that didn't even want to associate with him because of his last name Bram Hallelujah but he liken himself as to David when David God told David I have taken you from among the Sheep coat and I have I have placed you among Kings and I want you to understand that this is exactly what God has done for us hallelujah can I say it like this he has taken us from the gut ofmost and he's now put placing us into the uttermost hallelujah hallelujah only God can make something good out of something evil Hallelujah Faith must take what the message says and say Amen to it it must apply that word regardless to what you think you are first of all you've got to die to the old man when I say the old man if you if you've been abused in your life Hallelujah you've been hurt in your life whatever Satan put on you as a sinner you must die and R to that because if you don't it's going to hinder your walk with God say we are a new creature Hallelujah and if you're dead in Christ all things are passed away and behold all things have become new I believe that so whenever the devil trying to tag a old that old man back that old man is dead Hallelujah you see that was one of the ways the Roman people used to torture Christians they would kill one and would tie the Dead one to the back of the other person and he had to carry that dead man which to and the worms and all of those things would eventually kill him too you understand me so what I I saying to you if you're going to carry around your dead man it will eventually kill you you understand me but God has set us free the Bible say he whom the son is set free is free inde the Hallelujah and whatever complexes Satan put on you when you were a sinner all those complexes Must Die those complexes belong to the old man not the new man understand me the revelation of transformation how many of y'all believe that you're in the rapture Hallelujah I believe that and I believe everything the prophet says that's going to happen to each individual that really catch a hold of it Hallelujah is going to happen the way he said it but understand you can't work yourself into the Rapture you you you you can't even sanctify yourself it it takes the Holy Spirit to sanctify you you can't justify yourself you can't sanctify yourself and you cannot make the Holy Ghost fill you Hallelujah all of the works of God are the works of Grace Hallelujah this is why we call it amazing Gra Hallelujah see the Holy Spirit he chooses you or you have been chosen from the foundation of the world how many of y'all believe that come on somebody give God the praise Hallelujah the saddest thing about this we've got to be careful is that right and I'm going to jump in my my scripture he said Peter be careful be careful with your walk because Satan desire to sift you as weak Hallelujah and I'm praying for you Peter that your faith fails not y hear what I'm saying this is why Jesus said when the son of man cometh shall he find faith in the Hallelujah now I ain't talking about some other kind of faith I'm talking about the faith the faith that was delivered to the Saints Hallelujah and that faith that was delivered to the Saints was that God saved you not on your marriage not because you were good not because you came from a nice family Hallelujah but he saved you and chose you because you were in him Hallelujah glory to God I know you've heard these things before but I want to refresh yourself because your joy cannot return to its fullness until you remember it's never been your works Hallelujah James says show me your faith by your works that's the way man looks at it is that not what brother said he said that's the way man looks at it Hallelujah but God says hallelujah I your faith in what I have done justifies you it's not your works but it's the grace of God now I'm going to take what Jesus said I'm going to take what God Said Hallelujah because in the eyes of some people my Works may not be so Grand Hallelujah but in the eyes of God y'all understand me he ordained us to walk in the footsteps of the righteous Hallelujah that's exactly right the Bible says that God ordains Hallelujah the footsteps of the righteous and as long as I walk in his footsteps I am righteous Hallelujah not my own righteousness I'm not talking about fasting three to four days nothing wrong with that but I'm not talking about just paying your tithing those are the things you ought to do but your your salvation is based upon what God has already done for you Hallelujah and you've got to have faith y understand me and when I say this faith is not an emotion I feel it you don't feel it Hallelujah but Faith does give an inspiration it gives a stimulation come on some you know when you got it you know when you have it nobody can take it from you hallelujah oh I'm so glad my religion is not manmade I'm so glad that my salvation is not in the hand of a man my salvation was given to me before I even knew me was given to you even before you knew you hallah glory to God listen brother bam in the identified Christ of all ages paragraph s he said it takes a faith no matter where it is you got to meet that Faith that's all and faith is not just a myth just something you imagine it's something you know Hallelujah see that's what what was different from us we can't explain it but we know the message is Right Hallelujah we may not even know the depth of every Revelation there is we know that we know that know that this message has transforming power we know that this this message amen it's going to translate us hallelujah we know that this message is the reason why we are changed Hallelujah and the Bible say we changed from glory to glory so we as Believers We Stand still even when we don't see change we know our change is coming hallu Hallelujah the reason being he said that the if I began the good work in you I'm fa to complete hallu I believe that I'm holding on to that it's not my working it out Jesus working it out hallelujah thank you Lord glory to God yes sir in the message Paradox 1965 Hallelujah 117 paragraph 171 brother manam said a gift of faith is not something you take and do something with gift of faith is you just getting yourself out of the way Hallelujah that gift is getting your own self out of the way Hallelujah now if you get yourself out of the way what's in the way the word you understand what I'm saying if you move out the way the word is what standing for you right there Hallelujah come on somebody when you know you can't die that ought to make you feel real good Hallelujah when you know that there is a place there is no more Devils when you know that there is a place where there no no pain no disappointment it's beyond your imagination hallel but your faith says that the promised land is there hallelu I can't explain it but I know it's real hallelujah amen see when you got this hope in you this is what I love about it I didn't have to pay a penny Hallelujah and my inheritance it's something that no money can buy y'all better hear what I'm saying amen it may I may not be the richest man on this end oh my God my wealth is greater than any accountant could ever calculate understand is beyond measures Hallelujah because when you got God you got everything God has is that right oh yes it is amen hallelujah think about it Faith makes you do strange things when you know that you know that you know faith will cause you to do strange things you know those people didn't they weren't called holy rollers for no reason they they did things that you know normal people wouldn't do Hallelujah and we still do it's like when we at a funeral we shou and dancing why because we know that's just a corpse there Hallelujah but my brothers and sisters on the other side rejoicing so our minds well join them in this Dimension Hallelujah you remember the story Paul and Silas G they were thrown in prison and guess what they did they begin to praise God now come on somebody why because they understood that that prison was no prison Hallelujah that that prison had nothing on them y understand me because they knew the god of the prison they began to praise God maybe they were singing what a mighty God we serve hear me I don't know what they were singing Hallelujah but maybe they were singing victory is mine Hallelujah but they were not there sad something in them made them know that no matter how Satan was huffing and puffing everything is going to be all right y know what I'm saying let let me say it like this so when you when you can't pay your bills don't worry praise God when things go wrong wor Hallelujah you may not feel like it but then when you start jumping when you start praising God you're now giving God a sacrifice know what you're going through but brother Bram said it like this God has respect for you when you have faith Hallelujah that's what he say God respects you when you have faith when you acting like Abraham and those things that be not they Hallelujah the devil say you ain't got this you got to tell the devil I don't know what glasses you wearing all of this is mineah and I'm just waiting till my change come y'all better hear what I'm saying devil don't tell me what I don't have the Bible said that the Earth is the Lord the don't understand me let me say it like this that's my daddy Hallelujah let's make it a little more personal husband Hallelujah glory to God Paul and Sil Wen worried no sir they weren over there singing me Lord they began to praise God this is a magnificent thing about it because you know when you have an earthquake everything caves in Hallelujah but in this earthquake everything came out it it it opened up so much even the doors open up hallu no bones fell on nobody everybody was alive Hallelujah so much so the soldiers thought to kill themselves Hallelujah because they knew the Roman penalty would be worse than death ybody hear me but when they went to kill themselves Hallelujah that the the Servants of the Lord said don't do that don't do your body no harm am amen one thing I knew about those prisoners and the the doorkeepers they recognize a supernatural thing that happened Hallelujah let me tell you what it was Faith released itself you see when Faith releases itself go beyond this Dimension Hallelujah it passes through the fourth dimension passes through the fifth dimension through the six and it goes all the way to God don't believe that that's the truth hallelujah hu getting ready to be thrown in the fiery furnace they had Faith they weren't trembling they weren't scared by the circumstances Hallelujah something struck them they prayed all night brother BR say and they did not get an answer how many of yall know what I'm talking about you pray and you don't have an answer you don't even feel God sometimes it seem like he's a Million Miles Away there Faith said he promised me I never leave you will I forsake you Hallelujah glory to God I don't know about you but I serve the same God and ab God can do it for them he can do it for me he can do it for you Hallelujah he is a God that changes not Hallelujah glory to God is that right what happened when God does something like that with Paul and Silas Hallelujah not only that he saved some Souls understand God don't just stir stuff up just be stirring it up Hallelujah there's always a purpose for whatever he's doing y'all hear what I'm saying and I'm I'm going to say it like this instead of just uh killing themselves the next question they ask what much we do to be saved hallelujah amen amen Paul and silus didn't say you got to clean your act up you got to quit your job Hallelujah he said nothing like that Hallelujah he said if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God you and your house be glory to God y'all hear what I'm saying a lot of time people well if I'm saved my family saved but if you are truly sa you going to live sa your faith in Jesus Christ Hallelujah is going to reflect into their lives it's going to stimulate them you say you don't know what you're talking about my mother was a Godly woman y'all hear what I'm saying it was her life that quickened my life I saw her live holy when nobody else was living holy and when I was a young man I said to myself whenever I get saved if God would save me I want to worship the God my mama worship hallah see you don't know what I'm talking about I know but my mama served a true Living God hallelujah my mama would see signs and wonders I look back and I look back and I say she must have been a prophet she could tell me things about me that nobody else could tell me Hallelujah I couldn't even get away with nothing even my friends she would tell me this one is not your friend Hallelujah and Lord behold it may have taken a year or two but mama said came to pass y'all better hear what I'm saying you know why cuz Mama wasn't giving you her feelings she was giving me what God had revealed to her he y'all looking at me let me tell y'all something my mama couldn't read or right one thing about my mama she knew how to pray Hallelujah yes sir every time I hear Brother brand talk about that old Auntie about my m my mama knew she knew how to pray and whenever she asked God for something he came through oh yall let me say it like this I am a product of my mother faith and her prayer Hallelujah and I can't hardly wait to see you your faith will stimulate your love Hallelujah y yall understand me because because what happened even in the Exodus the the the man of the house had to put Blood on the door post for the for all of the house you see that blood has to be applied and individually right now the blood has to be applied Hallelujah yeah nobody can ride on nobody's coat tail Hallelujah you think about it now your faith we think we got something let me say it like this Joshua with the 12 Spies 10 of them come back said we can't do it there a no way we can whip them Giants come on somebody y'all know it's true and I mean Giants I'm not talking about just six feet seven feet I mean way up to nine and on up Hallelujah right come on somebody and they would eat they you know they had the real food so they they weren't soft like this no they were real but two have faith Joshua and Caleb come back to we can do it we can do it and they weren't looking at their human abilities they were looking at The God Who dest God who F them with Mana Hallelujah that quenched their thirst that was with with them let me tell you something you better recognize that the God that was with Elijah with you Hallelujah you believe that so that you understand this this this land this land has been bought God paid the price turn with me to Ruth please yeah he paid the price and if you notice that in the Bible [Music] when a man purchased something that purchase was his sometime it had to come through Wars and fightings it's like Jerusalem that's why Jerusalem is called the city of David because he fought for it so he bought it with his with the bloodshed Hallelujah so even now it's still called the city of David that land still belong to Israel no matter no matter what the world says that land still belongs to Israel Hallelujah let me tell you this the price for Redemption was done once and for all Hallelujah and every house on the land belongs to hallelujah oh come on somebody it's the truth God promised Israel a land that wasn't even theirs yet Hallelujah but he paid the price for it that's why he said now I giving you the land but you got to fight for it but every step every footstep every step you take is yours it's your possession y'all heard what I y'all heard what I preached last week God a going to say I'm going to pick up your bed if you want healing you want to get out of your circumstances you take up your bed and walk is that the truth you know Jesus at that wedding or that marriage I mean he could went and fill those those uh uh water pots up with water but he made the servant you go you go fill it up with water my responsibility is to turn the water into wine so let let me say it like this and this is why in The Book of Revelation he said eat the whole [Music] book right I'm I'm not going to force feed you take it you eat it right if you don't eat it the Bible will never become a new book to you you by understanding and reading this message the scripture has a different meaning to it it's a different Revelation and you begin to see oh my God he is the same yesterday today forever Hallelujah now Ruth fourth chapter verse it says and Boaz said unto the elders and to all the people ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that I W I uh that was IMC and all that was chilion in M of the hand of Naomi glory to God moreover Ruth the more B this the wife of Malone have I purchased to be my wife to raise her up raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place ye are witnesses this day Hallelujah maybe you don't see it but right now this is a picture of Calvary Hallelujah Jesus Paid the price and he was a open show with all the witnesses you say no Gentile was there yes it was it was actually a gentile that helped Carry the Cross Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying he purchased the place in so much Jesus said according to uh St John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever should believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Hallelujah so when you see in the Old Testament the shadow that God God purchases Israel and purchas a gentile bride Hallelujah with the same money they were no different money Hallelujah they were bought with a price Hallelujah and by the blood of Jesus Christ we were bought with a price Hallelujah and the world knows it but this land your land your house your Tabernacle your body your soul your spirit was bought by God hallelujah so much so the Bible says you've been bought with a price and you're not your own Hallelujah is that right so listen listen the 12th verse I'm sorry we let's go the 11th verse and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses the Lord made the woman that has come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah and I love this because she was no longer a gentile when she married Boaz she was like Rachel and Leah Hallelujah she took on upon a Jewish y'all hear what I'm saying yes sir she and and this is what's so beautiful about it she's also is is in the genealogy amen a gentile dog a mo she she's no longer that anymore and that's what it is when it come to marrying Jesus Hallelujah you may be a murderer you may be a wher you may be I don't know anything and everything but once you marry Jesus you're no longer that Hallelujah you w with him and you take on his name Hallelujah and all of this is by his grace amen hallelujah you see why the devil don't want y'all to get the Holy Ghost he F you get the Holy Ghost he is finished he knows ain't nothing you can do with a man who's full of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah hey can I say it like this it's worth the fight yes sir it's worth the fight yes sir it's worth the turmoil the struggle but the you one thing you going to find out is that the struggle was with yourself oh the devil keeping me from getting no it ain't the devil you don't want to die yeah you holding on to something you got to realize the word is the word the Bible says it's sharp like a two-edged sword is able to divide the soul and the spirit it goes all the way down to the [Music] Bon so so you can't hide from God hallelujah you get that on that on your knees you're going to have to say Lord consume me give me the will to release my will Hallelujah to make my will thine will hallelujah oh God when you become a dead sacrifice the W the fire comes out of the rock hallelujah the fire comes out of the rock Oh Glory to God he said uh let's move on let me move on before the time is up yeah he said Rachel and Leah which two did build the house of Israel 11th verse to do and do thou worthily in ephra and be be famous in Bethlehem Allelujah and let th house be like the house of farz whom Tamar bear unto Judah of the sea which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman you know people say well what tribe are you on I say I be a tribe is going to be the tribe of Judah of Judah Hallelujah God so excuse me I'm just this is Joy this is not this is Joy amen and let th house did I I read that the 12 13 verse so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her conception and she did she bear a son so the purpose of Boaz marrying Ruth was to bear his offspring understand me so the reason Christ marries us to bear his offspring Hallelujah yes sir is that right who is his offspring him we are impregnated by who Christ and Christ produces who Christ Hallelujah is that all right I don't mean to hold you like this but I'm excited Psalm 74 and2 Hallelujah you know I ask the Lord to restore my joy and he's done he's done just that so don't bother me I'm having a good time I'm just having a good time Psalms 74 and2 remember listen remember that congregation which thou Hast purchased of old amen the rod of thine inheritance which thou has redeemed this Mount Zion wherein thou has dwelt do do you think the is is just writing words he was inspired by God when when the devil want to take me I'm say ah you you had me Hallelujah but I was blind I couldn't see I belong to God way before I Belong To You y understand me so my my real honor has taken me out of the pawn shop glory to God yes sir and he's cleaned me up and he's now using me to his glory same with you every one of us has a purpose Hallelujah everyone I don't know what it is but whatever it is just do it with all your heart Hallelujah if if it's just know if it's a housewife be the best one be a husband be the best one singer be the best one Hallelujah musician be the best because everything you're doing it's to the glory of God understand me Hallelujah and no matter how ragged an instrument may be God knows how to play you yes sir yes sir no matter what God is good to us isn't he see the devil loves to triumph over the believer who loses his faith Hallelujah and let me say it like this when you lose your joy you heard me say this the other day back amen that's the truth because the Bible say the joy of the Lord is your strength and when you lose your joy you are weak Hallelujah is that right you become like a city with no walls the enemy can come in and do whatever he wants to do because you have lost your wall of Faith Hallelujah but you must allow God to reild your Fai that's what he said to Peter he said Peter you know the devil desire to sift you as weat Hallelujah didn't he didn't he say it and just shortly after that the devil put the pressure on on Peter Hallelujah he shifting Peter he shiting Peter hallelujah amen yes sir one Crow at a time Hallelujah can you imagine how Peter felt in his natural he doesn't have the Holy Ghost yet he just have had the promise y'all hear what I'm saying he must have feel bad felt bad you you know how we feel sometimes when when we we miss that window of witnessing to somebody that's a terrible feeling but here was Peter denying and He was cursing but see God don't make no mistakes Peter had received a revelation he couldn't get rid of Christ the son of the Living God you see one thing about revelation when is real it holds you it holds you you don't hold it it holds you glory to God and guess what Jesus said no matter what you've done Devil he's mine I bought him I'm in the purchasing business that's right that's right and and and and before Jesus could even do much after his resurrection when he was going to gather with those the disciples he told his disciples you go find Peter and you make he can't he couldn't be cut off he couldn't be cut out with with with his failures his position couldn't be taken by somebody y understand me I'm saying this when your bride and you know that you're bride nothing can shake your position Hallelujah your position was already determined before you got here and there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God hallelujah even Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God not my mama not my sister not my brother not my coworkers nobody preacher not the Deon musician no user can separate me all you from the love of God Hallelujah Lord when somebody say you're a holy Ro you say I can't help God Lov me Hallelujah like I heard somebody say the other day because you know they say I am a Jesus fanatic she said I don't say that she says I'm a Jesus Lover Hallelujah cuz all Fanatics don't love him you understand me glory to God you love the Lord just give me a few more minutes is that all right Ephesians please Ephesians 1 people we need to love the Lord because he's already done it the Bible says the work was finished before the foundation of the world world you can't work your way into this it it it just how can I say it you can't be blessed and cursed at the same time and the Book of Revelation said blessed is the man who who read or heareth the sayings of this book nobody in the world knows this message like us the world don't know what's going on you know what's going on through all the shadows and types is that right we know what's getting ready to happen right come on in Nebuchadnezzar what did he do not only did he conquer Israel but he displaced everybody Hallelujah the whole time he was tearing up countries Hallelujah and what was he doing he was making a one world order and that's what we see now you see all these immigrants and everybody coming what do you think that is that's the same Spirit moving in the whole world it's not just it's just not America it's in England it's in Germany it's everywhere and the devil is bringing a one world he placing everybody in their position and devil is placing everybody in their position God is placing a bride in her position hallelujah it's homegoing time believe what I'm saying we're right after coming of the the change of the body want to say it's h goinging time Hallelujah I'm happy about it oh say oh Lord will I make it out of our Rim Hallelujah what you talking about yes sir is that right we had a spy if I can say it like this we had somebody to go over into the land Hallelujah when he went over to the land he said is good over there Hallelujah he said words cannot express come on somebody and he said the inhabitants the inhabitants are all of the redeemed Hallelujah he said the bride I saw her she was of every nation every Hallelujah and I don't know about you when he saw me I was there in there God hallelujah I'm not going to be one say I can't make it I've already made it hallelujah oh I ain't going to be turned down at the gate I been accepted in his beloved you're not going to be turned down because he brought you with a price God trophies 1 through 14 in whom ye also trusted after that you have heard the word of the truth the the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Ghost uh uh promise Hallelujah you say Lord have mercy let me tell you something this is how Israel whipped all the enemies they made sure they stayed within the word they were obedient to God as long as they stayed obedient there were an enemy in can land that could defeat them Hallelujah it was only When sin was found in the camp Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying as long as you keep the sin out of the camp victory is yours Hallelujah you know I I really believe if aen had come up and confessed and made everything right before he got caught he would have been okay but he he and he and he was so afraid Hallelujah that same fear caused the death of him and his family Hallelujah let's move on 14th verse which is the earnest of our inheritance until the r Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory let me tell you this that scripture was fulfilled when the seals were open and the lamb took the book now let me say it like this you know the book itself was the Bible it was no other book that book had seven seals on it and it took a prophet from God to be in place for those seals to be open you understand me Hallelujah do you think it was just a literal book Hallelujah now the Bible said Jesus Christ is the word was the word the word was of God Word was God you understand what I'm saying hallelujah but you got to understand that book that he uh uh had in his hand was the Lamb's Book of Life can I say it like this it was actually it was the record of the Bride so the book itself was the bride that's why said eat it all up represents you one thing I love about it is if the lamb was bleeding the book was Dripping with blood hallelujah it's dripping with blood yes it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood the blood of disciples who died for the this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with I love that Hallelujah one more scripture I'm going let you go first Corinthians 6 19- 20 you love the Lord I made my song need I mean made my interpreter really work don't don't wor about it if you missed a few words the Holy Ghost will bring it to their whatever they need to hear God will have to hear it amen hallelujah sorry about that I just get so excited 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods one more scripture please 1 Corinthians 7:23 this is so important ye are bought with a price be not ye the Servants of men amen hallelujah you understand me and this is not an easy way don't think it this is a hard way and I would like to say by the grace of God is harder now perhaps than it ever has been because we're living in an age that just messed up lawlessness nothing you can't see nothing not even Christmas represent Christ no more yeah and Easter you got all the bunny bunnies and eggs and Jesus is hardly mentioned about anything you go to churches and you can't even hear the name of Jesus Hallelujah almost all the gospel song they they singing about a lot of stuff Jesus could do but they don't mention his name the truth you just got to assume who they talking about Hallelujah but I love I like hearing the name of Jesus Hallelujah cuz I want the devil to know who I'm talking about you know what I'm saying it's a true it's the true because you know the Devil Himself could be glorified in that song that's what he think he is oh Jesus but when you put the real name to it no question about it you love the Lord people of God just lift up the name of Jesus and as I said and Satan tried me on this the very same thing if you lose the battle in your mind that's that's the direction you're going to go in it's the truth you know if any kind if the lust of Flesh lust of eye pride of life if it comes you to do things that you do y understand me if you don't resist that devil you're going to end up doing just what he wants you to do Hallelujah but if you listen to the Holy Ghost if you yield your holy yourself to the Holy Spirit you're going to do exactly what he wants you to do Hallelujah now sometime the battle gets so hard especially in the mind you going to have to Jes Jesus Jesus is that right brother B said when you call on the name of Jesus Jesus will draw near Hallelujah some sometimes that's all you can say you can't hardly pray you just got to call on his name Lord there's power in the name of Jesus stand up let's stand up Hallelujah there's power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah but don't come talking to me about my Lord don't tell me what God can't do don't want to hear that Hallelujah here I am breathing I can't even control my breath y understand me what what's making this go I can hold my breath and and and won't be able to to keep it because I'm not controlling God is contr God is so loving and so kind to me to grant me breath and I can still breathe that means it there's whatever he choose whatever there is I need you got to believe if you believe it you can receive it and I just believe that the same Jesus William brandom [Music] served I don't know what your problems are if there be any you know don't talk to me talk to him that presence that you feel is not my spirit it's his Spirit Hallelujah and right now while he's here while the waters are being troubled maybe you have searched for a job or a wife whatever it may be no prayer request is stupid request is important to God no matter how small it is no matter how great it is my God is more than able that's the Bible he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above whatever you ask or think God never fails but what we need to do understand that every trial we go through is not chastised sometime it's just training test and training to build your faith and all you got to do is wait fa brother vom said it like this if you can
