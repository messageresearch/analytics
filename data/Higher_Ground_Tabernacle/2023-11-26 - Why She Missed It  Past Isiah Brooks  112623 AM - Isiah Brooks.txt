is keeping me alive yes Jesus is keeping me alive amen y'all can take your seats for a little while amen feels good to be in church on a Sunday morning amen where else could you be on a Sunday morning you couldn't be in watching her basketball match or a football match nothing compares to this amen I want to do something before we ask the pastor to come up to preach but we'll ask him to come up ask the pastor to come for amen I don't know where he's um sister [Music] Ruby we are doing something that we haven't done before so we'll ask the pastor to come and stand in front of the church and his wife sister Ruby please come in front of the church how many love our [Music] pastor amen I'll read a scripture in Jeremiah 3 Jeremiah 3:15 if you can put it on the it's on the slide so you can read together Jeremiah 3:15 says and I will give you pastors I think I'll need an interpreter brother Frank you can help interpret [Music] please Bible says and I will give you pastes according to Mine Heart heart we shall feed you with knowledge and [Music] understanding amen and we have no doubt that our pastor is god-given [Music] amen and we know the month of October was a pastor appreciation [Music] month amen but we we can appreciate our pastor at any time because he's always there available for USS 24/7 Sunday to Sunday amen also want to read a quote of what the prophet says in a Christ The Mystery of God revealed paragraph 81 if you can show it on the slide please he didn't know I was going to do this so please pray for me I might get in trouble for doing this without the pastor's permission the prophet says and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respect he'll lead you through not because he he just feels like it or for any other reason but because he is ordained of God to do so so God gave us our pastor from his own heart and he ordained him to lead us through at some point in time the prophet says he's a he's a burden Bearer throughout the year January through December you do not know what he's going through he's carrying all of your burdens when you have that burden he's feeling it for you too so you you have your burdens alone and they're troubling you but imagine him carrying everyone's burdens and his own burdens too amen that takes A God Called man God ordained man that's why the prophet says give you respect and you through amen so Pastor Isaiah Brooks and sister Ruby is Brooks sister Ruby with the church is higher ground Tabernacle we want to say we appreciate [Applause] [Music] you amen I understand uh a few members of the church you might have shown your appreciation to him uh individually multiple times I believe that but we have never uh given them an appreciation as a church so we thought it necessary to give them an appreciation as a the whole church together so I know a lot of people in the church contributed some money so we can just get small tokens to to give it to them and know we cannot attach monetary value to how much we appreciate them or how much or to equate it to how much he cares for this [Music] church but but Pastor will say please our talking of appreciation when you look at it look at it as a symbol or a talking that Higher Ground T appreciates [Music] you amen so as um the the small gifts that we got them to be brought and handed to them [Music] as a show of [Music] appreciation can somebody take a picture please and when I say the pastor the prophet says when God calls a man he calls his wife too so when he's carrying all those burdens she's also caring it too and she's supporting when he is tired she's there for him and not for him only alone but for she's there for us amen so that's all we had to say we love you we appreciate you amen that's all I had to say and this just does not end here if you feel like you want to do something for them please go ahead Hallelujah so let's stand upon our feet as we invite P to in the morning when I rise in the morning morning when I rise in the morning when I Rise Give Me Jesus Give Me Jesus give me J you can have all of this world but give me Jes oh give me J give me [Music] G you can have all of this world but give me to oh when I am alone yes when I am am alone when I am alone give me Jes oh give me [Music] Jes Give Me Jesus you can have all of this world but give me Jes oh oh should I walk along [Music] yes [Music] wo [Music] me Jesus you for [Music] me amen we thank God for his grace we thank God for his Mercy I can truly say U this was total total surprise I thank God for the gifts for my wife and I they taught us in uh School the term more perfect is incorrect because when something is perfect it can't be more perfect but I'm going to be incorrect this morning uh this could not have come at a more perfect time [Music] [Music] and I I thank you I thank all of you those of you who gave and those who had a desire to give I I thank God I'm I was going to wait to show the suit but I like it already thank you thank you somebody's got some [Music] taste I was uh really struggling this morning but thank you I've been trying to arrange things so that I could be here more often and God has made a way I contacted a brother a pastor that believes in the Holy Spirit and I'm waiting on him to return uh on whether he'd be able to come or not but I invited him so that we could have at least four days of meetings definitely uh just dwelling on the holy spirit so that those of us who do not have may receive and those who want a refilling may receive so pray that God's perfect will be done in this matter amen I want to say out of all of the years that I've been [Music] pastoring this is the first time uh a church has given me an [Music] appreciation and so I want to say that by doing [Music] this you have imprinted my heart and I never will forget it even if there were no gifts just the thought that you have come this far to say you appreciate uh the work of the Holy Ghost in me I make mistakes but I always try to correct those mistakes and I appreciate your your patience with me you know I've gone back in my life and I've thought about things I've said over the pull pit that I I consider were conal but everything I've ever said over the pool pit it's been my desire to see this church come to perfection [Music] Hallelujah I have I've never said anything to have any natural gain for myself it has always been for the work of Christ in you thank you again as we stand let us turn to Revelations 19 Revelations 19 we'll read the seventh to the 10th verse and from there we go to to Matthew 25 I I preached a portion of this message in Iowa City and I thought it would be nice to preach here excuse me Revelations 19 apyp beginning at the seventh verse let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine Ling is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he sath unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou doth it not I am the F thy fellow servant and of th Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy Matthew 25 we'll read the first 10 verses then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arosed and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are G out but the wise answered saying not so lest they're not uh enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself [Music] this and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the the marriage and the door was shut now and then at the time I'm sorry I'm sorry read something else let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord because of your grace and mercy we are able to stand behind behind this pull pit Lord it is not our righteousness that you look at but it's the righteousness of your dear son Jesus Christ that you have covered us with and we're so thankful father for those who are here this morning we thank you God for all that you do and I pray this morning that you look beyond all of our faults and see our needs this morning may the May the word of God find good hearts Lord hope that it may bring forth a hund fold of your word in this last day we thank you Jesus Christ your ways are Beyond pass beyond finding out but I thank you for your loving kindness in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be SE this message was an inspiration uh brought to me by uh a quote that I read that brother brandham said and I I'll bring out that quote uh uh in the message because I really believe uh that we're we're right at a period where where the door will be shut uh there will be those that will be locked out but then we are also in that period brother brandham said that the Bride made herself ready so I entitled this message why she missed it we're not talking about the bride now we are talking about that other five that heard the Midnight Cry and they fail to keep oil in their lamps remember even in the text they all slumbered and slept am the wise slumbered the foolish slumbered they slept but they all heard the cry Hallelujah I believe that the word of God is requiring from us what we call rapturing Faith and rapturing faith is a faith that does not waver it cannot waver it is what brother Brandon called an undisturbed faith and I believe that the bride will be tested so that she may see where she stands we talk about the Supernatural and brother brandham tells us that when that squeeze comes we will see the bride in her full color because she said the church is is at its best when she is under pressure and I'm not talking about just Financial pressure I'm talking about pressure concerning your faith Hallelujah you're going to be challenged and I trust by the grace of God that you will be well prepared for this oncoming storm Hallelujah ain't God good amen what we need to do this morning I believe it's uh examining ourselves I'm not here to condemn anyone but I am definitely here here to make you think to make you look deep inside to make you shine the light on your soul to see whether you be in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah coming from the message marriage of the Lamb paragraph 54 brother Adam say it's like this so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking and from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome and you have to you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it [Music] down Hallelujah see she has made herself ready I like that you see God could not push us through a little Pip and pull us on the other other end and then then saying blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he's just pushed you through but you've got to make a decision for yourself I have to make a decision for myself and in doing that we shall show our faith and respect to [Applause] God Abraham was promised a child AB but he must maintain This Promise for 25 years the up and the Downs that he had in Temptations in those 25 years but he held to the Word of Promise my question are you holding to the Word of Promise maybe you don't see your Perfection when you're looking in the mirror you don't see the Perfection Hallelujah but it is not your face that you're supposed to be seeing when you look in the word of God you are looking to see the character of Christ be in you hallelujah how how far have I traveled uh in this journey and am I the same am I I the same as I was 10 years ago 5 years ago three years ago we know as the coming of the Lord approaches sin becomes magnified Hallelujah but you should become closer to God hallelujah I don't know about you but my desire is to walk with God as inner walk with God Hallelujah see Israel had to fight and and I think a lot of times we fail to see we got we have to fight fight it's a everyday fight Hallelujah and every day you might win some you you going to lose some but that's in your life but in the mind of God you never have you never lost a battle Hallelujah because in his mind we stand perfect I love him for that because he's not going to give up on you he's not going to give up on me Perfection is who he is hallelujah not he puts us to the test even as the prophet of God said this is the most evil Agee of all the ages but he chose you cuz he knows no matter how evil it is the light that he places within you will always cast out the darkness Israel had to fight for the land that was promised to her matter fact the Bible say says wherever you place your feet claim it possess it Hallelujah because it's yours Hallelujah now the thing that I want to say is that when you know God has given you something and Satan comes to take it away God has purposely placed you in the battlefield you don't you just don't throw up your hand well it must be the Lord's will no it's the Lord's will for you to keep that which he's given to you Hallelujah and when you've done all to stand the Bible says you stand is that right because the battle is not yours the ble is the Lord hallelujah Hebrews 12 one and two she she missed it why did she miss now we could say it happens that's what's happening Hallelujah uh the scripture goes on to say wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and let us run with patience the race that is set before us his name on you that's God accepting you but we have problems accepting God's decision concerning us hallelujah you know I was born a Brooks my blood DNA declares that my father is my father and no matter how I try to deny him it doesn't make any difference because my blood gives me away my DNA tells me who I am Hallelujah I was telling one relative uh saying uh to this individual uh because his daddy is a a real what we would consider well he's he's he's a sinner as yet and and and we were telling us uh that my the young man that he he he doesn't have to be like his daddy and he said well well what else I'm going to be I'm a son Hallelujah but if your daddy is a murderer doesn't mean you have to be a murderer see when it comes to Jesus Christ God don't care what your daddy or your mama was or even Hallelujah he's come to give you a birth something that's going to change you mean really go into your DNA and change your DNA from being your daddy's DNA into the DNA of Jesus Christ now how many of us believe that brother Bram said it like this when you receive the Holy Ghost God gives you a blood transfusion and I believe that I don't care what my daddy was or is hallelujah my Earthly father has nothing to do with me now y'all understand what I'm trying to say maybe before I got born again I had my daddy's habits but when I get born again my daddy's habits must go Hallelujah is that right if my daddy was a liar that I I'm no longer dictated by his genes or his DNA Hallelujah I am now controlled by the DNA of Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah and the word of God declar what ever Jesus is we are in this world Hallelujah I'll stay with the word I'll believe the word I'll act upon the word see that was one of the reasons she missed it she didn't have that Revelation that she needed to go all the way and that Revelation only comes by the Holy Ghost embodying you because the Bible says hallelujah that the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth all truth I don't know about you but I'm still feasting on that message brother Cooper brought Hallelujah it was made so plain in the scriptures of who we are it gave me a complete picture or image of who I am to be and I'm not going to back off of that goes on to say in the second verse of this Hebrew chapter looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God hallelujah you understand what he said the joy that was set before him he understood what his crucifixion would mean to the world he understood what his sufferings was going to bring to the world he understood the effect of his dying he understood the effect of his re uh resurrection and he knew that he was the first born of the Brethren Hallelujah he understood amen that he was the beginning of God's creation and he understood that you and I was going to come after him Hallelujah had Jesus failed we would have failed hallelujah our victory it's not in our carnal being it's not what we do it's what he has done for us hallelujah there is no failure in God I was talking to a friend of mine from South Carolina and and she was testifying of how she met some of the old friends of ours and how they got in and they were in the store wherever they were praising the Lord and then she said to me there's no shame in the name Hallelujah you see because some people who call themselves Christians are still ashamed of the name when they're not in church Hallelujah but you cannot be ashamed of the name is that right Hallelujah every KNE every tongue must confess hallelujah amen that he is Lord to the glory of God brother bam said it like this we must fight if we must Reign but we find out that we we we become lazy because things we don't know our enemy he said this age doesn't know her enemy you know the all the other ages had to suffer they had to go through something but he said our greatest enemy in this age is Easy Living Easy Living how many of y'all remember when you had a rough time you your way wasn't so easy it was doing no time times you prayed it was during those times you prayed it was during those times you may have fasted it was during those times you kept your Bible open Hallelujah but now we don't see what the enemy is doing so easy now God has blessed you so well now that you feel I don't have to come to church I could just look at it on on on the video and many of us don't look at it on the video but you can't fellowship with me on the video the Bible says when you see that day approaching come together the more coming from the message marriage of the Lamb paragraph 86 I'm taking my time because I really want this to to to to grip you a friend of mine uh just got over Co and I and I guess that's she hadn't never had it before a very a very healthy [Music] woman and uh around 70 I think but she described what she just went through she said if I could imagine hell that's what I would imagine she said she hurt all over she had pain down her spine she said it was worse than having a baby she said she was on the floor wallowing and rolling because of the pain was so excruciating Hallelujah but she said prior to that attack of the devil God had already given her a dream and she saw herself coming out as a winner y'all hear what I'm saying so God didn't spare the attack but God prepared her for the attack understand God is not going to spare us from the suffering that we're going to have to go through but he's trying to prepare us hallelujah I want to be prepared and I'm preparing now 86 y'all remember the promises we made him and that same thing when you come to Christ we said Lord if you would re receive me into your I'll love you I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forgot that I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my tithing into the storehouse I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything and I pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right where you promis that and it should come from your heart if you promise your husband that and not from your heart you mean it you you are absolutely not living correctly with him it's kind of a crystallized affair and and what did he saying what is he saying if you listen to that message he said if a husband or a wife married each other and the love that they felt in the beginning if or if that wasn't real he said she just married in the eyes of God you're not even married the woman said you just bearing his children so even at the altar when you say I love you and I do if you're not telling the truth God can't sanction that and more than likely you'll be miserable during your entire marriage until you have a come to F love that person like you supposed to love that person you don't like hearing that but that's the truth and I'm going bring that to Jesus your relationship with God is not accepted until you love him if he he's not going to accept that on the lower level he can't accept it on the higher level and he said if you love me you will keep my commandments so if you don't love Christ hello he knows it you can't hide it from him you might be able to hide it from your natural spouse or whatever but when it comes to God he knows if you really love him Hallelujah and if you don't really love him you're kind of like false teeth you're there but you didn't come from him Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah I'm not I'm not trying to beat you now don't get me wrong I'm not trying to beat up on you I'm really trying to love on you if you want to say it like this trying to get you because I know your battles I know my battles I know how intense they are at times but there I do know one thing there is not a speck of darkness in my heart when it comes to staying with God or leaving God hallelujah I'm like Paul who shall separate me from the love of God no matter what I've got to go through no matter what he sends me through no matter how much I must suffer my heart is knitted to his heart Hallelujah glory to God you said brother Brooks are you going to make it already me and those of you who will have the Holy Ghost sealed with the Holy Ghost you made it already Hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord coming from question and answers paragraph 151 I I don't know I I see people not understanding uh uh the spirits that that works with them and I'll say like this if you don't love him he will become boring to you at some point in time you're going to get tired of Jesus because you don't love him you know what I'm saying it's like you you're dating somebody because somebody else told you to date him but you don't love that person after a while that person becomes very annoying to you and believe Believe It or Not Christ becomes annoying annoying to some Christians because they don't love him enough you don't want somebody to come by your house all they're going to do is talk about Jesus what else to talk about I want to know what he's done for you and I want to tell what he's done for me Hallelujah now let's paragraph 151 now and then at that time see the Gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgins the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been re rejected in the bride and she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification listen to this be go ahead because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification then she has to suffer for her Deeds but the bride who has become the word come complete atonement was made for Christ made of Christ because he is the word that body was ritten and when that body was ritten the B the bride was in the body because it's all the word amen you see it Hallelujah that's why when you say I can't take it no more those are not the words of a real Christian Hallelujah you might think it because the devil put it in your mind but that's not the scripture Paul said I can do all things all things all things through Christ who strengthens me Hallelujah y'all y'all hear what I'm saying oh I can't take it anymore when you say that you know what God does he put more weight on you he's a real drill sergeant he'll put more on you because you say I can't and he's looking at himself in you and he said you can do this and much more amen hallelujah we got to believe that if you're going to follow this message you you might as well believe it with all your heart let let let's not have follow it halfway you you got to give give it all your heart so that God can uh perfect you you can't get away from suffering because that's part of the Cross take up your cross and follow me take up your suffering Hallelujah because through suffering God produces character Hallelujah yes sir he said look at the sleeping virgins oh what did she do she had to sell something in order to buy her o think about it what did she have to sell her old Creeds and denominations and things see those little foxes that you thought you thinking it doesn't matter it does matter when Jesus was on the cross he wasn't even clothed he was naked and that's what he gives us he doesn't give us a word that's clothed that's why we needed a prophet that God will reveal to us the Naked Truth The Naked word is what God has brought to us hallelujah and when we see the naked word we is no sh to us hallelujah it's salvation to us hallelujah I don't want nothing dressed up Hallelujah I don't need uh it to be uh made pretty give me the bloody bleeding word hallelujah that is the thing that will give me health and strength to make Heaven Hallelujah she had to sell something in order to buy her oil what did she have to sell her old Creeds and denominations and things she sold out all she had in order to find Christ Christ that's the great Jewel Jesus that body right h I have a ticket to go to heaven when the train comes by one of these dark mornings oh what blessing Hallelujah you see identity the only identity God wants to see is his identity in you the word in you made manifest in this day Hallelujah listen when he saw Jesus when Jesus were being baptized by John he comes up out of the water and the Holy Spirit descends upon him and declare this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in right then and there Jesus was identified with God and when God gives you the Holy Ghost he identified himself in you Hallelujah this is why we need it without the Holy Ghost you don't get to heaven and holy this Holy Ghost is beyond a Pentecostal experience y'all know what I mean it's beyond speaking in tongues it's beyond jumping and shouting it's beyond dancing Hallelujah it is actually a change of life in your most being Hallelujah in other words he turns on the Heavenly switch Hallelujah he turns on the Heavenly switch with that which was darkness in you must flee Hallelujah is that right brother B said you don't have to quit it you don't have to quit it with the Holy Ghost it quits you Hallelujah that's the truth I hate seeing people run around saying there in the message and doing everything sin is doing I hate seeing that I'm not saying you're not I said but you're not alive yet potentially you are you got to be changed if God told Nicodemus who was a man who followed the word I'm introducing you to a New Kingdom a new way of life what you understand is flesh what you understand is flesh but I'm spir speaking of a a Heavenly Kingdom I'm I'm speaking of something that is spiritual and just as you were born in this this world this kind of a kingom naturally you must be born into a spiritual Kingdom hallelujah hallelujah is that all right think about it you know when it comes to our ering ways we we understand and and I'm going to use this morning vasy because she she messed up she was Queen Hallelujah right and a lot of times when we talk about vasti vas we always look at the denominational churches but let me tell you what vasy is she is a spirit not a denomination she is a spirit and you can be Anointed with [Music] vasty that same Spirit she had is in this age to anoint you Hallelujah yes we we talk about the Holy Ghost he's here to anoint us as well but in this age you still have the spirit of vasty Hallelujah thinks she's all that Hallelujah can't come to an altar call or won't repent when the king's constantly calling him the word is being preached and and the King wants you to come into His presence and you sit still in your seat you feel his pres but you fail to respond back to it that's the spirit of vasty Hallelujah she's she was Queen you're in the message look how far God has brought you Hallelujah he didn't leave you in Pentecost he didn't leave you with the Baptist he brought you into this Hallelujah and you still don't want to respond to him Hallelujah but I'm going tell you something don't respond you don't have to respond because God has anointed some Esters Hallelujah and we're not about the outward appearance we're about what's in the heart we listen to Moriah we listen to the messenger of our day we play the not just to get an intellectual understanding but we we want to know who the king is what he likes and what he dislikes and whatever he wants of us whatever he demands of us that we'll do amen hallelujah glory to God Esther I'm just going to read it here Esther first chapter 9-13 Hallelujah and vasty the queen Made A Feast for the woman in the Royal house which belonged to the king of shur and that's the truth you know people are having feasts even in the message Hallelujah there are people who come to your house to eat dinner food and won't even come to church Hallelujah I ain't going all I'm not going to go too much into that it it's good to Fellowship on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he he he commanded Bona big ABA zista and cauas the Seven Chamberlain that served the prince uh served in the presence of Asos the king to bring vasty the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look upon but you know what you can take and you can go all the way up to that up the scale all the way up to brotherly kindness and you still can be rejected because the measure of Christ is divine love the Pentecostals came all the way up to brotherly kindness but they failed to cross over Hallelujah when God gave the revelation of The Headstone when Christ stood there in his presence even saying come unto me Hallelujah they stood there and refused to come because of their Creeds because of their dogas you don't belong to our church you didn't come on our schooling so this cannot be Christ but it was Christ wasn't a Pharisee he wasn't a sadducee he was none of those religious things he was the word of God made manifest and so must it be the same thing with us we're not a Baptist we're not Methodist we're not Pentecostal and we're not what you call message this message is to bring us into being the revealed word of the hour Hallelujah must be the word the word is defines who you are Hallelujah you worry don't worry God will always give you the revelation of who he is what he's doing in this day thank you Lord hallelujah right she had it now I'm going say it like this even if if it was typed out to be the Pentecostal Church it goes beyond that cuz you know the Pentecostal Church they had all the gifts they had people being raised from the dead they they had great ministers and all that they had it she once she once was beautiful you look at her now you can tell she has been excommunicated she really thinks she's still with God but look at her she no longer looks like a queen she stripped her clothing she wear all this makeup she does everything the world does trying to impress God but you can't impress god with your substance he gave you the substance gave you everything y'all getting quiet on me but I hope it's because you're thinking but when Queen vast refused to come at the king's commandment 12th verse therefore by this chamberlains therefore was the king very raw and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times they knew the times and let me say it like this brother bam knew the times and he kept telling us about the times it's later than you think what 2 minutes to midnight or however it was 3 minutes but where are we now Hallelujah you see what Israel doing you see what the world is doing and he said when all those trees began to Blossom Blossom and and and show their fruit that's the time Hallelujah you understand me Hallelujah first let finish this this verse then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment Hallelujah you understand me what she was judged with law and judgment Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ God gives us Grace Hallelujah is that right listen whether you realize it or not Esther broke the law when she went in to see the king she broke the law but she was not judged by the law she was judged by grace and love y'all hear what I'm saying this is how the bride is judged Hallelujah by grace and love Hallelujah I'm almost done just just coming to something Hallelujah see we know by God's grace that because of her her way of doing things has to please the king let me read this quote coming from the token 153 if he was has never given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet then he hasn't confirmed your faith that you say you have but the token is the confirmation should I say that again I didn't say that the prophet of God under the inspiration of the holy spirit says if he has never give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet then he hasn't confirmed your faith that you say you have but the token is the confirmation Hallelujah is that all right amen I'm I'm I'mma jump from there if you want to read something read Romans 9 I'm not going to read but read Romans 9 21-29 hallelujah hallelujah so what the the acceptance of God is to give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah is that all right in that same message paragraph 157 and the requirement of him today is the blood of his own son Jesus Christ and the token of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you see what I'm saying The Virgins were under the blood all five of them was there they could not have been Sanctified without the blood without the Holy Ghost but they didn't come to the fullness of it Hallelujah they didn't have the oil and the extra oil they were saved but they were cut out from being bride you can't stop there you can't stop until you complete it he that begun the good work work in you is faithful to complete it Hallelujah there is a completion of Christ that must take place on the inside of you Hallelujah 158 and we haven't got it we might be Baptist Presbyterian Lu Pentecostal whatever we might be we might Shout scream we might be oh so educated that has not one thing to do with it you must present the token then you are subject for the resurrection because the resurrection power is already in you Hallelujah the token resurrection power showing that Jesus raised up from the dead and you are raised from from the dead the dead things of unbelief and have been made alive in the word of Jesus Christ you believe it and the word lives through you Hallelujah he said if you abide in me my word abide in you ask what you will St John 14:12 he that believeth in me the works that I do he shall do also greater than this shall you do because I go to the father a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me because I'll be with you even in you how did how how did he not the body is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty but the token that you have received him and he have has given it back to you take the token claim anything you wish to God promised it Hallelujah glory to God see you you and I must understand we do not want a I don't want a religious spirit to to to deceive me to disguise itself as being the Holy Ghost Hallelujah this age is the is it is the age of deception and and Satan is now disguising himself as a holy ghost but the word tells us what the Holy Ghost will do Hallelujah the the the the you can that's why the prophet God said the Holy Ghost is not having blood coming out of your hand and blood out of here he said you can you can dress up like Jesus you could be crucified like him but that's Antichrist that's not Christ Hallelujah Christ bring change in your life Hallelujah you know when you do wrong and you feel guilty thank God for that feeling that's Christ Hallelujah when God tells you to repent that ain't just your mind that's Christ working on the building building you up into a statue of a perfect man Hallelujah when the preacher preach and he cuts you Hallelujah that's not the man that's Christ in the man Hallelujah trying to form and shape you into the word of God hallelujah marriage of the Lamb paragraph 145 he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's wholly Washed by the blood of his own self that's right so we we see where we stand the wedding getting ready to come now we find out she commits spirit spiritual fornication going out with the world professing something living something different that that won't work never work what the church ought to do is to do like Esther did Esther refus the adoring of the world Hallelujah now let's get down to the because the adorning of the world is not wearing a short skirt the dawning of the world is accepting the spirit in you that will make you wear a short skirt y'all hear what I'm saying the adorning of the world is taking your spiritual man and allowing your spiritual man to take on the attributes of the world because if that spiritual man takes on the attributes of the world physically he's going to do right what's in his Spirit people say oh you can't judge me on what I wear I don't have to you judging yourself the word has already said it Hallelujah glory to God what's on the inside will reflect on the outside Hallelujah I'm almost done the love of God will always manifest itself to the bride I I I want to say this again those of you who who gave even those who didn't give her but but you were United in spirit to to to do what you did this morning I I'll never forget it uh it was so on time and normally I'm a real cry baby but I'm still in inside so emotional thinking you and loving you more for for what you did today you know you know the depth of what I'm saying one of these old days uh when we get to heaven Hallelujah here in here in is now set forth the love love of God he desired in a love family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all kind all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born in of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their in their walk listen I'm going repeat that then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be what trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy now I'm going to throw this in how many times we've done something wrong and we say God will never do it again and then we find ourselves doing it again that's his long suffering Hallelujah is that right that that he reproves you because he brings condemnation to you Hallelujah but he knows you will repent he he knows you say God forgive me seven times in a day a just man will fall but he'll get up Hallelujah is that right he chasen with n na scarred hands listen to this now sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it so let me say it like this when you go through major storms is not always the devil many of times is God answering your prayer Lord I want to be like you L do y'all believe the word the Bible said the suffering of this world cannot be compared can't be compared there's no equality in it nothing that can be compared to the things in which he has prepared for us I want to see that I want to experience that I want to be a part of that Hallelujah yes Lord I'm almost done folks I know you're tired some of you just getting off from work I I it it was it was cold in here and I tried to turn it up so but I know how to I know the struggle but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not he doesn't know how to do it no other kind of way now you look at the Son of God who goes through the Wilderness for 40 days no food and I don't know about the water it says he didn't have but all I know he made it you understand me he wasn't spared he had to suffer Hallelujah and people said well I want you to take note he suffered more after he received the Holy Ghost and the devil will tell you you must not have the Holy Ghost look how much you're suffering the devil is a liar Hallelujah if I don't have it why are you bothering me right why you wasting your time on me if I don't have it see why you bothering me and why are you constantly telling me I don't have it when I know you are a liar oh God have mercy because if he can keep you believing that you don't have it he's literally he's stunting your growth hallelujah oh little flock do not fear this age is fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together I'm trying to get us ready here and as a threefold cord is not easily broken they will have a tremendous threefold strength of Poli political physical and spiritual satanical power and they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure Hallelujah fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who loved his own loveth them until the end so let let me say this cuz I'm going to let that be the be the end of it oh no I got one more one more please just one more bear with me I missed the whole message if I if I leave this off because I don't know you know how everybody's thinking but you've heard me say this I I think about death and I and I think about the Rapture every day because I know I know one or the other is going to get me right it's going to happen and and and and and however it happens I want to be ready I don't want to be screaming and holling like I have no hope you understand me I want to be certain see I don't ask God for certain things I said Lord if I've got to go then then let this happen if I've got to go by way of grave I want to leave one more testimony with my family that is the land is real y understand me I want them to see that the land is real Hallelujah so I'm going to I'm going to read this this thing and then I'm going to let you go one of my one one of the greater testimonies in in brother Brown's message of of of a friend passing on has has always stuck with me so so coming from the message marriage of the Lamb brother Bram talks about brother Bosworth starting at uh paragraph 12 and it reads and I said brother Bosworth one more thing I would like to ask you he he said what is that brother Bram I said now you put in about 60 years for the Lord in service or maybe and I said when was your happiest time in life he said right now and I said brother BOS brother you know you're dying he said I can't die y y y that means so much to me when you come down and you're not afraid of death cuz you know you can't die you know you getting ready to take a trip come on somebody if if a wagon would pull up right in front of the church right now and call my name and says I'm getting ready to take you to that other dimension right your you know what what you think I'm going to do H what you think oh no I'm going to love these people I'm going to stay that ain't mean me yet I'm just saying I going to say byebye see you later I'm going to run out that door I ain't going to walk I'm going to run might dive or jump but I'm getting in there you understand me isn't that what we want folks when I was a kid That's what Satan would always bring fear I would be buried and alive and people didn't know me they couldn't hear me scream I used to dream that and I'm knocking on the coffin's door trying to get out but I was lost I the dream falling off a clip falling what was that my soul was talking to me Hallelujah and since I got saved I don't have none of that kind of stuff no dreams of that nature none right so let me get back to the this just so you know a true saint of God should never have a dream dream of of you being lost or dead or unless God is speaking [Music] something Hallelujah he said I can't die I died many years ago and he said brother Brandon all that I have loved and cared for for the past 60 years I'm watching for him to open that door at any time and come and get me think about think about what I'm saying now when I when I said that if you have a dream bad one like that know that came from the devil it didn't come from God hallelujah no weapon formed against you shall prosper Hallelujah I think of that the the palm the Psalm of Life life lives of Great Men all remind us we can make our lives Sublime with parting leaves behind us footprints on the sands of time and he certainly left Footprints to me before he died went on into Glory about about one hour or maybe more before he passed away he had been kind of asleep for a few hours and his wife his sons loved ones were standing around and he and the old man woke up looked around and raised up run across the floor shook hands with his mother who had been gone for many years with his father and for over and hour he shook hands with people saying this is Brother John yes you came to Christ in my meeting in Juliet Illinois here's brother shaking hand with converts that had passed on for many years he said I'll tell you sometimes I believe in that hour we'll pass from this earth into another I believe sometime the river is going to be hard to cross anyhow you know I believe maybe the Lord says to our loved ones go down to the river and meet them down there for as Jacob said we'll be gathered with with our people someday Hallelujah now I'm just crazy enough to believe that Hallelujah glory to God you may stand he said now I want to ask you something that God is trying to perform in his church and the church is trying to perform by the Creeds and the two can't work together you got to get rid of the Creed and get Christ in and how can you do it when he sees the blood when the blood has been applied with a sincere heart and a hand laid Upon Jesus Christ and a heart that's true before God to confess his wrong and be born of the Holy Spirit then the work of God would follow as he said it would do yeah Church wants to perform through their Creed and see how many members they can get God wants to perform through the power of the blood to get Christians born again that's exactly the difference of it Hallelujah you must reject to do this you've got to reject the Holy Spirit and his performing power to accept the Creed you have to see the truth before you can accept an error and if you're going to be a Christian you have to walk over over God's promise I mean you you you he said you can't Hallelujah in order to get get an error you have to walk over God's promise he said because there is a red light flashing before you all the time all the time this is the word and that was from the message part to be like [Music] Jes to be like Jus on Earth I love to be like me Hallelujah all through life J from Earth to Glory I ho to be

message this morning amen amen we just have a few announcements to make um this coming Sunday we have a joint service with the Saints in Iowa City and we have the service here in De Mo starting at our regular time and we have a guest uh preacher who's coming in that's from from the Congo Pastor Gideon kasongo amen so he was um used to be the pastor of some of the Saints in this church used be brother kambas Pastor brother Isa and probably a couple of other ones so we'll be having a service here and he'll be ministering amen and um as a pastor once mentioned uh Brother Joseph for the TV and um in as much as you think the church has a lot of money the church does not because we the church do not pay offering so we barely are able to pay rent barely make it to pay rent so we are not able to get additional stuff that the church needs like equipment so if you feel led you can approach the trustees or the um the pastor or the technical Brothers if you feel like you want to help because we need to get our microphones our wireless transmitters so if the Lord impresses that upon your heart you are more than free and more than welcome to do so amen and our sister Ruby just mentioned that since um we are having a joint service next Sunday it's good for us to have a potluck so um the way it works you make something from home food whatever food you're going to make each and every person or each and every family you bring food and we all share that food we love one another someone say sharing is caring so I believe um for the Sisters if you can coordinate with sister Ruby and um I don't know you'll figure out who is helping with the coordination so that everyone does not bring just [Music] fuu and you don't have meat or anything else so uh please just help coordinate with the sisters I don't know whoever they're going to pick amen and lastly uh we have a card that we're supposed to give to the pastor and his wife brother Simon is holding it so unfortunately it's not big enough for everyone to write a [Music] message so it's okay if you have a message you can tell him but we would like everyone to sign their name on the on the card yeah or a family representative or just anyone to to write the just to sign the [Music] name amen so when the pastor can look at it he remember you amen so everyone you need to write there even if even if you were not able to [Music] contribute we still need your signature over there amen we have come to the end of our service one more time just turn around to your neighbor and say God bless you I love [Music] you I was
