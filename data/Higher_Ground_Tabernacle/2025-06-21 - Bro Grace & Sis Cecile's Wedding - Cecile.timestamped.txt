[17:55] Your love is better than love.
[18:01] [Music]
[18:08] more.
[18:11] [Music]
[18:13] If you are all Bible readers,
[18:17] you will know that when Adam was
[18:19] created,
[18:22] he had to wait a little longer
[18:25] before Eve could show up.
[18:29] He had to wait for Eve to be
[18:30] manufactured by God.
[18:34] So he had a waiting period.
[18:38] So today, our Adam is brother Grace.
[18:42] He has to wait just a little longer
[18:46] for his bride to show up
[18:51] cuz this is her most perfect day she has
[18:54] waited for her whole life.
[18:58] So, she has to make sure that everything
[19:01] is perfect.
[19:03] The dress, the shoes, the veil,
[19:06] everything has to be spot on.
[19:09] So, we'll just wait just a little longer
[19:13] before the bride comes in.
[19:23] [Music]
[19:29] [Music]
[19:35] I love you.
[19:39] Everything
[20:01] You're my
[20:04] everything.
[20:12] You're my
[20:18] [Music]
[20:27] My life
[20:29] is
[20:38] the bride is making herself ready.
[20:42] I see faces are getting a little
[20:44] concerned, a little a little sad. The
[20:46] bride
[20:48] Don't worry, the wedding is not
[20:49] cancelled.
[20:51] We are still going on.
[20:54] She just has to make sure everything is
[20:56] sitting in its right place.
[21:01] You can see she is about to get ready.
[21:08] [Music]
[21:17] We can all stand. Here comes the bride.
[21:20] Here comes the Let us all stand. Here
[21:23] comes the bride. Here comes the bride.
[21:27] Here comes the bride. Here comes the
[21:32] bride.
[21:42] When I found you, I found
[21:51] [Music]
[21:54] Here comes the bride.
[21:58] She is walking slowly.
[22:01] Take your time.
[22:04] Today is your day.
[22:07] When I found you, I found
[22:12] Just turn around and take a look at her.
[22:15] [Music]
[22:17] When I found you, I found
[22:25] you. I told others.
[22:29] Let's clap hands for the bride.
[22:33] I saw my fears fly away. That's the lady
[22:37] of the hour.
[22:39] [Music]
[22:41] Today it's her day.
[22:43] [Music]
[22:52] Sounds crazy.
[22:55] I see the father is smiling.
[22:59] He is happy today.
[23:03] You are the one, my only
[23:10] forever.
[23:17] First of all, we want to welcome
[23:19] everyone here today.
[23:29] And may the Lord bless you for your
[23:32] support.
[23:35] Dearly beloved,
[23:37] we are gathered together
[23:40] here in the sight of God and in the face
[23:43] of this company
[23:45] to join together this man and this woman
[23:50] in holy matrimony
[23:52] which is commended of St. Paul,
[23:57] to be honorable among all men,
[24:02] and therefore is not by any to be
[24:05] entered into unadvisedly
[24:09] or lightly,
[24:11] but reverently,
[24:14] discreetly,
[24:16] advisedly,
[24:17] [Music]
[24:18] and in the fear of God
[24:21] into this holy estate.
[24:26] these two persons come now to be joined.
[24:31] If any man
[24:33] can show just cause,
[24:36] why they may not lawfully be joined
[24:38] together,
[24:41] let him now speak,
[24:44] or else hereafter
[24:47] forever hold his peace.
[24:52] I require and charge you both
[24:57] as ye will answer in the dreadful day of
[25:00] judgment
[25:03] when the secrets of all hearts shall be
[25:05] disclosed.
[25:08] That's if either of you know any
[25:10] hindrance
[25:14] while we may not be lawful joined
[25:16] together in matrimony.
[25:20] Ye do now confess it.
[25:25] For be it well assured
[25:28] that if any persons are joined together
[25:31] otherwise
[25:34] then as God's word doth allow
[25:37] their marriage is not lawful.

[31:03] I give my my faithfulness
[31:08] [Applause]
[31:13] Amen before Before we go any further,
[31:17] I'd like to just remind everybody
[31:21] that this ceremony in itself
[31:25] reflects a biblical ceremony that took
[31:27] place years ago.
[31:32] And many of you have heard
[31:37] the Isaac story.
[31:40] How Abraham Abraham told Eliza
[31:44] to go find a bride
[31:47] for his son.
[31:50] In doing so,
[31:52] Rebecca was came on the scene.
[31:58] Rebecca came on the scene.
[32:01] Most of us know the story.
[32:04] When she first met Eliza,
[32:08] she was a servant to him.
[32:12] Even as brother Brandham said,
[32:14] God works on both ends.
[32:18] And God had anointed her
[32:21] to not only give Elea the drink,
[32:26] but also to water the camels.
[32:31] There are great love stories throughout
[32:33] the Bible,
[32:36] but this is one of my favorites
[32:39] because we know that God works on both
[32:42] ends.
[32:44] And this was in a divine appointment.
[32:49] for both Rebecca and Isaac.
[32:53] We know the story
[32:55] when Rebecca saw Isaac
[32:59] love at first sight.
[33:01] [Music]
[33:02] And let us not forget Jacob
[33:05] who loved Rachel so dearly
[33:09] that he was willing to work 14 years for
[33:12] her.
[33:15] Amen. What a mighty God we serve.
[33:19] And now we have
[33:23] our brother Grace
[33:25] and our sister Cecile
[33:28] who is anointed with the same kind of
[33:30] love.
[33:34] There's only one love
[33:36] and that's God's love.
[33:39] And so we thank God for his grace.
[33:44] We thank God for his mercy.
[33:48] We thank God for bringing these two
[33:50] together.
[33:53] Now, we're going to have
[33:57] exchange of rings.
[34:05] [Music]
[34:12] Yes, sir.
[34:19] As I stand,
[34:22] I'm going to bless these rings.
[34:26] Everybody here know or should know
[34:30] that the circle represents eternity.
[34:34] represent eternity. Though we be married
[34:36] here,
[34:39] our love for each other continue out
[34:41] throughout eternity.
[34:46] It also represents God
[34:49] and it also represents love.
[34:53] So, I'm going to present these rings
[34:56] first of all
[34:59] to our brother Grace,
[35:03] and he's going to uh place the ring
[35:08] on our sister Cecil's finger.
[35:21] I'm so grateful
[35:25] after
[35:27] all things I've been through.
[35:30] I present my love to you.
[35:33] You're the girl I want to marry.
[35:38] You're the only one touch my heart.
[35:42] [Applause]
[35:47] I promise that uh for God everybody
[35:53] a good husband for life.
[35:55] Amen.
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:06] Amen. It's our sister Cecil's time now.
[36:10] She's going to say what she needs to
[36:12] say.
[36:44] Guys, want to move?
[36:47] That's my love.
[37:02] I love you. Let's go.
[37:12] Let them

[37:21] I love you until your death.
[37:24] [Applause]

[41:32] Our gracious heavenly father God, we
[41:36] come before you right now in your
[41:38] precious name. We thank you right now
[41:41] for our brother Grace, our sister
[41:45] Cecile. They have come together and
[41:47] united themselves as one. Lord, I pray,
[41:51] Father, that that you let the power of
[41:53] the Holy Spirit protect them. Let no
[41:58] hurt, harm, or danger come to them,
[41:59] Lord. And as they progress, we pray,
[42:03] Father God, that you would just be the
[42:06] God before them and the God behind them.
[42:10] Build a wall of fire about them. We are
[42:13] now living such in such an evil day. And
[42:16] we pray, Father God, that you would just
[42:19] protect them both. Lord, we don't know
[42:22] how long you will tarry, but should they
[42:24] produce offspring, I pray that their
[42:27] offspring, hallelujah, will be anointed
[42:30] to love you and to serve you. Father,
[42:34] make them good husband, wife.
[42:38] May they love you even as Christ loved
[42:41] the church. Lord, I pray right now for
[42:44] their present and their future that you
[42:48] would be with them forever in Jesus
[42:50] Christ's name till we're translated out
[42:53] of this place in your lovely name Jesus
[42:55] Christ we pray. Amen. And amen.
