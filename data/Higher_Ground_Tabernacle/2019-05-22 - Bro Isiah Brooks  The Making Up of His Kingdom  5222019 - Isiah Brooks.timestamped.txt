[16:57] I've always enjoyed that song amen we

[17:06] we had to have our brother Florence with
[17:09] this a member the farmer and brother
[17:12] cliff farmers dad just his mom but
[17:20] anyway just glad to have you here by the
[17:23] grace of God glad to have everybody here
[17:26] tonight this is our Wednesday crowd hey
[17:33] we keep the scripture where two or three
[17:35] are gathered and we're so thankful that
[17:39] we have as many as we have because you
[17:43] know many are falling away many are
[17:48] getting tired so many things are
[17:51] happening now and I'm grateful to be one
[17:55] in the number Amen when you love God you
[17:59] make the sacrifice that's just the way I
[18:02] see it and like I said we're living in a
[18:06] time where I don't know it's just
[18:10] whenever like Brenda Lewis you say don't
[18:13] let this gospel become common to you
[18:16] don't let it become common
[18:18] because when it become common you begin
[18:21] to act common and we're not common
[18:23] people as such amen as we stand let us
[18:28] turn to the Word of God we're going to
[18:31] be coming from Luke seventh chapter 47
[18:36] through the 48th verse and Romans 14:17
[18:48] Luke 7 47 to 48 wherefore I say unto
[18:57] thee her sins which are many are
[19:00] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[19:06] little is forgiven the same loveth
[19:09] little let me go read that again
[19:11] wherefore I say unto thee her sins which
[19:14] are many are forgiven for she loved much
[19:19] but whom little is forgiven the same
[19:23] loveth little and he sent it to her thy
[19:27] sins are forgiven Romans 14:17 for the
[19:38] kingdom of God is not meat and drink but
[19:42] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[19:48] Holy Ghost
[19:49] let us pray Lord we thank you for your
[19:53] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[19:56] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[20:00] you have been better to us than we have
[20:02] been to ourselves we pray father God
[20:06] that you would bless this service in a
[20:09] special way break and destroy the yokes
[20:11] of the enemy and father will be careful
[20:14] to give you the praise the glory and
[20:16] honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[20:19] amen you may be seated
[20:26] as we were saying earlier you and I we
[20:30] have been ministering and actually
[20:34] working together where we can see our
[20:39] identity where we come from where we're
[20:41] going so important to understand your
[20:45] origin and last week we talked about
[20:50] that circle that is eternal
[20:54] we call it eternal life if you came from
[20:58] there you go back there we showed you by
[21:02] the grace of God how that every River
[21:04] every ocean wherever it starts it goes
[21:07] back everything makes its circle amen
[21:12] even so the scripture says there's
[21:15] nothing new Under the Sun that which is
[21:19] already been has been that which is now
[21:22] has already been so you and I understand
[21:25] if the Bible said there is nothing new
[21:28] Under the Sun what we think is new our
[21:32] technology our computers our mathematics
[21:37] and all that we do there's nothing new
[21:41] this thing has what we we're looking at
[21:44] has already been done and we must
[21:47] understand that the people in the days
[21:49] of Noah was far more intelligent than
[21:51] what we are and so therefore God wiped
[21:54] away everything and made us start all
[21:57] over again but there is nothing new amen
[22:01] we we must understand by God's grace
[22:04] that what God is doing why are we here
[22:08] what is what is God doing if we want to
[22:12] see what he's doing we we go back to the
[22:14] book of Genesis and we see that God
[22:17] wanted a family he had as brother madam
[22:22] said he had angels and seraphim's and
[22:26] cherubim but in him he wanted to be a
[22:30] father he wanted to be a savior he
[22:32] wanted to be you know a deliverer he all
[22:36] of these attributes were in him
[22:38] even brother branham said it like this
[22:40] he said that God in the way that he was
[22:44] he'll never return back to that in other
[22:48] words he has come back to a place a man
[22:53] in Jesus Christ where he will reign and
[22:56] rule forever I think is in the future
[22:59] home where the man talked about Christ
[23:01] sitting on the throne and he talks about
[23:03] that pillar of fire that'll be above his
[23:06] head you see because God the Elohim the
[23:10] self-existing one is the creator of all
[23:13] things and you and I must understand by
[23:16] God's grace that we are part of the
[23:19] family of God what Adam bypassed Jesus
[23:26] came to restore back to us because once
[23:30] the seals were open we understand the
[23:34] Prophet telling us that we go back to
[23:36] the day before the fall hello
[23:40] in other words if you can believe it if
[23:44] you can receive it this Holy Spirit
[23:48] gospel brings us back to a place before
[23:52] the fall because you must understand
[23:56] that this generation or this group of
[23:59] people that have been chosen and elected
[24:01] by God has been justified as though you
[24:06] never sinned in the first place if you
[24:10] can believe it you and I can really see
[24:15] God on the move but what we must
[24:19] understand is that when the Holy Ghost
[24:21] comes upon a man or woman he wipes away
[24:25] the guilt consciousness hallelujah in
[24:29] other words the days of being guilty is
[24:33] over by because you recognize the
[24:39] positive part of the word you and him
[24:43] hallelujah
[24:45] you are accepted in him now you and I
[24:49] must understand though we make mistakes
[24:52] in the eyes of God we stand sin-free the
[25:00] Bible said blessed is the man whom God
[25:02] will not impute ha that God will not
[25:07] charge sin now understand me now
[25:11] the Bible said if you say you have no
[25:13] sin you make God a liar but understand
[25:16] the blood of Jesus Christ that covers
[25:20] you that hides your failures that hides
[25:24] your thoughts and because you are a true
[25:27] son and daughter of God you make
[25:29] confession not in hope but in faith that
[25:34] God has already heard and answered your
[25:38] prayer now this is what brings joy if
[25:44] you don't have the Holy Ghost see the
[25:46] Holy Ghost would testify to these things
[25:49] the Holy Ghost bring peace y'all know a
[25:54] piece is there's no battle in peace it's
[25:57] peace right and you and I must
[26:00] understand the Holy Ghost brings what
[26:02] righteousness we became he became our
[26:06] sin that we might become the
[26:09] righteousness of God understand if you
[26:12] don't take the scripture in the light of
[26:14] what I'm trying to tell you you will
[26:17] always battle to the end which takes
[26:21] away your peace because you and I must
[26:26] understand we are accepted in the
[26:29] beloved not in what you do though it is
[26:34] important to do the righteous thing the
[26:38] Holy Ghost will cause you to live holy
[26:41] the Holy Ghost would cause you to live a
[26:43] righteous is that right the Holy Ghost
[26:46] will bring what joy you don't have we go
[26:50] to church and people don't enjoy the joy
[26:53] of the Holy Ghost no more
[26:55] I love the singing I love the shouting I
[26:58] love the dancing I mean if you want to
[27:01] do a cartwheel that's fine with me but
[27:03] the
[27:03] one is you need to understand that the
[27:07] joy of the Holy Ghost goes beyond that
[27:10] all of that's good but the joy of the
[27:15] Holy Ghost
[27:16] is the power of God living in you is
[27:22] that right the public God tells us in
[27:26] the Hebrews chapter 2 6 and 2 he says
[27:29] listen we are then perfect through
[27:34] Christ and we are free from judgment
[27:38] through Christ and we don't believe that
[27:40] we are free from judgment through Christ
[27:44] we should be the most happiest people on
[27:47] the face of the earth don't let the
[27:50] devil steal your joy hallelujah
[27:53] believe God trust him I was telling the
[27:56] brother that the other day I said you
[27:58] know what I trust God every time the
[28:02] devil try to put things on me and make
[28:03] me look bad and you know I said Lord I
[28:06] trust you you said you will complete
[28:11] this work it's not him that will it no
[28:16] he that runneth but God who shows mercy
[28:19] right and we are free from judgment
[28:22] through Christ we shall never die
[28:25] through Christ we have lost death and
[28:29] found life through Christ not through it
[28:32] in church not through any denomination
[28:34] not through any fantastic not through
[28:38] speaking with tongues not through
[28:40] shouting not through shaking not through
[28:42] dancing in the spirit but by grace God
[28:46] calls who he will and is all by election
[28:52] he's the one building the kingdom he's
[28:55] the one setting the stones in place
[28:58] hallelujah amen and if God has called
[29:03] you and has set you in place you ought
[29:06] to be happy every stone is cut in such a
[29:10] way my stone is cut from every but
[29:13] different way than all of us
[29:14] everybody stone is cut in us
[29:17] in a strange way but at the same time
[29:19] when God put us together
[29:21] whoo that's right it's perfect
[29:26] hallelujah God calls who he will and
[29:30] it's all by election we find out we find
[29:34] out that it's not him that wants to be
[29:37] saved whoo
[29:39] not him that willing or him that runneth
[29:42] is God that showed mercy and no man can
[29:47] come to Jesus except God draws him first
[29:50] so what you got to do with it
[29:52] anyhow you haven't got nothing to do
[29:56] with it you're out of the picture all
[29:58] together thank you Jesus how do you when
[30:08] you're out of the picture out of
[30:10] somebody's happy tonight because we have
[30:13] been fighting all day and I'm trying to
[30:16] take just to hit the head off that devil
[30:18] tonight because I want you to realize
[30:20] that man he is a liar from the beginning
[30:23] he can't stop what God has started and
[30:28] you're part of it it's never been your
[30:34] goodness has never been my goodness
[30:36] though we do our best to be good is that
[30:40] right
[30:41] oh come on the rich young ruler say good
[30:43] master and Jesus said there's only one
[30:45] that's good and that's God hallelujah if
[30:50] there's everyone if there ever is a
[30:52] goodness is the good God in you hmm
[30:57] think about it God and I took this woman
[31:01] at Simon's house because her sins were
[31:03] many but Jesus said those are the kind
[31:09] that really loves me
[31:11] when they realize that they've been
[31:13] wretched and you know like Paul said you
[31:16] know I'm a wretched sinner I'm the chief
[31:18] of all sinners a brother didn't like me
[31:21] saying that one time he said only ponca
[31:23] see there that's hey Paul going
[31:26] he's where he's at but in this age I can
[31:29] say it right because I know the kind of
[31:33] a person I was before God changed me
[31:36] every one of us can say it hallelujah
[31:40] yeah we can fight for first place
[31:43] because all of us realize amen
[31:46] how wicked we were whether we did or not
[31:48] we thought it we imagined it we did a
[31:52] lot of things and God changed at all not
[31:57] because you want a God to change you is
[31:59] because God wanted to change you it's
[32:04] not him that will it like the Prophet
[32:06] God said all I want to be saved
[32:07] there's many that wants to be saved but
[32:10] this salvation come by election and not
[32:14] by the will of man only by the will of
[32:18] God hallelujah and for you and I to sit
[32:22] here we are to be able to accept this is
[32:25] the will of God we have ears to hear
[32:28] blessed is those people who have ears to
[32:31] hear somebody help me here how would
[32:36] anybody turn away from this message I
[32:38] don't understand it there's just so many
[32:40] things I don't understand and I don't
[32:41] even try to understand it this this
[32:44] message give us such great Liberty
[32:46] it's Esav sets us free hallelujah it
[32:50] takes the burdens of weary away and you
[32:52] know we've we fret I had so many
[32:55] situation coming at me this week all I
[32:57] could do is says lord I trust him I kept
[33:00] prayers and lord I trust him is that
[33:02] right
[33:02] he moved this one out the way he moved
[33:04] that one out the way he moved this
[33:06] without the way and all I could say is
[33:07] Lord I thank you that's what you got to
[33:12] do when things get so contrary and
[33:15] there's nothing you can do
[33:17] he is expecting you to trust him is that
[33:20] the Bible when Moses saw it was out of
[33:23] his hands
[33:24] what did he have to do trust God
[33:27] hallelujah
[33:28] is that right when sham God saw it was
[33:32] out of his head all he could do was
[33:34] trust God if God be with us where be all
[33:39] the mirror
[33:40] don't get me wrong I believe that every
[33:43] son and daughter of God should be
[33:45] experiencing miracles signs and wonders
[33:47] and everything else and brother Branham
[33:49] said it like this if miracle if signs
[33:51] are excuse me
[33:52] signs and wonders are not following you
[33:54] he say you not even Christian you don't
[33:57] believe in other words you don't believe
[33:59] we are supernatural people I'm so tired
[34:03] of these Christians living in such a
[34:04] natural way real supernatural and we are
[34:09] supposed is the inheritance of the
[34:11] Saints that we see God move in a
[34:14] supernatural way hallelujah listen
[34:18] really that lady that sister you know
[34:21] when God said her freed the Bible said
[34:23] he if the son therefore shall make you
[34:25] free you shall be free indeed how many
[34:27] of us freed it tonight free you got to
[34:33] be free I don't care if the devil seemed
[34:36] like he's holding you down you're free
[34:38] he's the one that's deceived not you is
[34:45] that right oh the devil might even think
[34:47] he's gonna send you to hell he can't let
[34:50] my told you last week he'll is blocked
[34:52] the door is locked because Jesus has to
[34:57] keep devil don't have no keys not even
[35:00] to his own house and when you go you
[35:03] can't go there because the door is
[35:06] locked to the righteousness of God yeah
[35:09] I'm telling you a true believer can't go
[35:13] there because Jesus has already gone for
[35:16] you and he locked the door he has the
[35:20] keys and if Satan wanted you there he
[35:23] can't open the door hallelujah why
[35:28] because the blue prevail I showed you by
[35:32] the grace of God
[35:33] how did when Moses put the blood on the
[35:35] doorpost and the little that death angel
[35:37] had to pass by he didn't even have a key
[35:41] to open the door
[35:42] he couldn't penetrate the door he
[35:44] couldn't go on
[35:45] around it over it because the blood of
[35:48] Jesus Christ she'll do me that's how it
[35:52] is with our lives right now
[35:54] the death and you would love to have us
[35:56] but he cannot have us because the blood
[35:58] blocks him hallelujah glory to God you
[36:05] love the Lord the making of his kingdom
[36:07] he's trying to get us to see you know
[36:09] and we fail sometimes how often did the
[36:13] children of his uh his disciples failed
[36:16] remember when they was on their own the
[36:18] sea and the sea began to roar in the
[36:20] water became again to come in and you
[36:22] know Jesus was there sleeping Peter win
[36:26] over her doubt not that we perish I can
[36:29] see myself some time I bid for him I may
[36:33] have not other those words but I've been
[36:35] there Lord where are you he's responding
[36:39] the same way he's did then ye of little
[36:42] faith
[36:42] you know we don't get out of it he tells
[36:45] us just like it is
[36:47] you don't mean because listen God had
[36:50] already given him the authority of the
[36:52] word speak it right sometimes people say
[36:57] oh you've got to have fearless
[36:59] Thunderbolt and all this kind of stuff
[37:01] but you see the problem is we dis we
[37:05] don't stay connected connection is what
[37:09] we need we must stay in connected to the
[37:12] Holy Spirit when you are it connected
[37:16] with the Holy Spirit
[37:17] you're not a cold iron you take that on
[37:23] and you plug that baby up to that
[37:25] electricity it gets pretty hot
[37:28] hallelujah is that right and they have
[37:30] those little dials on there where you
[37:32] can regulate the temperature if you want
[37:34] to just medium you can get it if you
[37:36] want hot and steamy you can get it you
[37:38] have the button you have the regulations
[37:41] right you can determine on how hot you
[37:43] want to get you turn it up God is game
[37:47] of giving you the power I like the idea
[37:51] of a steam I love steam I remember in
[37:55] the days we used to have little bottles
[37:56] we had to spray you know
[37:59] your time we took water and sprinkle it
[38:01] just before we can I now we got the
[38:04] island st lush I like to hit that button
[38:08] I like to hit it you know it's because
[38:13] you and I must understand the Holy
[38:15] Spirit is that way
[38:16] he wants to use us just like that
[38:21] hallelujah but the only way you can be
[38:24] in arm but you got to be plugged into
[38:25] the power hallelujah listen the truth of
[38:30] the matter is we we fail to see Amen
[38:34] that this yeah I'm so tired of going to
[38:36] churches or places and they says waste

[39:37] house and Berlin says she elbowed her
[39:39] way through the crowd I believe she did
[39:44] it she airport away to the crowd she was
[39:47] a giver but she got to Jesus as you
[39:51] began to worship Him she began to wash
[39:52] his feet she began to touch to minister
[39:55] to him and brother them say you minister
[39:57] to the word you've entertained Jesus
[39:59] when you praise him oh that's to
[40:05] Pentecostal for you but let me have your
[40:08] nun ting if you don't want it pour it on

[42:19] little bit of makeup and he she used to
[42:20] clip and I had he said see she found out
[42:22] she wasn't completely dead yet
[42:27] yes you do these little things you're
[42:28] not completely dead yet and in order to
[42:31] get the Holy Ghost you've got to be dead
[42:32] and rotted emptied out and you just
[42:37] don't want it on your spirit you want it
[42:38] in the soul and then when you get there
[42:42] you wanted to grow up into Christ's
[42:46] ambition I aim is to grow up into Christ
[42:49] be more like our Father be more like him
[42:53] that's our earnest desire every day I
[42:56] don't care if you fall the bible said of
[42:58] just man falls seven times in the day

[43:07] what he wants us to do the devil don't
[43:09] understand but i'ma tell you there's a
[43:11] driving force in me and there's a
[43:12] driving force in you no matter what

[43:17] no turning back there's no turning
[43:19] around I don't care if it is by inch

[43:26] little by little we're gonna make this
[43:28] journey hallelujah well god help us mark
[43:34] eight it's God making his king is he's
[43:36] building his kingdom you're part of it
[43:38] I'm a part of it it's so wonderful we
[43:41] don't have much time here don't y'all do
[43:45] y'all really think God will be so unjust
[43:48] to not give us some more anointing to
[43:52] make the journey and a lot of people
[43:55] don't Oh the revival is over the revival
[43:58] it maybe yours is hallelujah but I know
[44:03] the law of God the law of God said if
[44:06] there's a deep call there's a deep to
[44:08] respond God and go have us first remove
[44:11] him and not give it to us he said if you
[44:14] ask for bread do you think I give you a
[44:16] serpent nonsense he's got us calling and
[44:22] calling and he's just waiting for that
[44:24] moment to respond he will respond we're
[44:30] not going out here without his hung down
[44:33] ain't no way no way he's making you he
[44:40] is building you right I look at those
[44:44] quotes but them says you know when when
[44:46] God Christ is in you you are nipper tunt
[44:48] and we forget don't we forget it we just
[44:53] forget that we are an impotent
[44:55] that means all power a and Satan has
[44:59] done so how come he's overcoming us now
[45:03] when I say oh I'm just generalizing it
[45:05] it ain't that see without faith it's
[45:09] impossible to please God you've got to
[45:11] have faith that omnipotent is in you you
[45:17] must believe it and even on nipple
[45:19] journey is in you that means the ability
[45:21] to create is in you that means the
[45:24] ability to stop the devil wherever he is
[45:27] is in you it's in you I remember the
[45:34] time brother Branham was down in Mexico
[45:35] somewhere in the baby had cancer of the
[45:38] mouth or something anyway
[45:39] they went to operate on the baby and and
[45:41] the devil really got mad and angry and
[45:43] swirl the baby everything up and brother
[45:47] branham was waiting on something then
[45:49] the Holy Ghost came to him says but but
[45:51] I'm waiting on you sometimes we wait on
[45:55] God for a move-on word or vision or
[45:58] something
[45:58] and God said but I'm waiting on you is
[46:02] that right oh he said to Moses why do
[46:04] you cry and speaking I've already given
[46:08] you the authority I've given you the
[46:09] word what could you handle this it's
[46:12] yours and whenever you and I handle the
[46:16] word by faith and sided off in Jesus
[46:19] name brother Branham sitting like this
[46:20] he said it's no longer Jesus is no
[46:22] longer your prayer it becomes Jesus
[46:24] prayer
[46:25] how can it fail hey somebody it cannot
[46:29] fail mark 8:34 338 you don't have to
[46:33] turn there and when he had called to the
[46:35] people unto him with his disciples also
[46:37] he said unto them whosoever shall come
[46:39] will come after me let him deny himself
[46:41] and take up his cross and follow me for
[46:44] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[46:47] it but whosoever shall lose his life for
[46:49] my sake and the gospel the same shall
[46:52] save it Holly
[46:54] yeah what shall it profit a man if he
[46:57] shall gain the whole world and loses so
[46:59] Oh what shall a man give in exchange for
[47:03] his soul you know it's the truth you
[47:05] know people who use their excuses oh I
[47:07] work I work I work and they fail to come
[47:10] to the house of God to say thank you
[47:12] Lord you understand me
[47:17] the barber said he here ten lepers and
[47:19] only one came back to say thank you and
[47:22] here God provide jobs and everything
[47:25] else for people and they work with
[47:27] strength and help every day and they
[47:29] fail to give God an hour - of thank you
[47:32] nonsense it just doesn't make sense and
[47:35] yet you say I'm a Christian always give
[47:40] thanks the Bible said always give things
[47:44] somebody help me I tell you what you and
[47:47] I realize that one thing it is the grace
[47:49] of God that's gonna really save this
[47:52] bride hallelujah right now with the
[47:58] natural eye she ain't looking too bright
[48:00] I made that word up but anyway she just
[48:05] don't look it how do you look brightest
[48:10] I'll tell you how you do it they call
[48:14] them Christian at Antioch huh cuz they
[48:20] look like it they act like him the power
[48:23] God was with them just like it was with
[48:25] him signs and wonders followed them
[48:28] hallelujah but we find that what even in
[48:32] even in among us is becoming a shell is
[48:34] just becoming a form of godliness and
[48:37] God is not pleased God want to see
[48:40] action in the church it doesn't matter
[48:43] if you're young or old David was a young
[48:48] boy into a giant Josiah was a young man
[48:53] and he became a great king so it's not
[48:57] just just old people young to have faith
[49:01] in God God told Timothy Timothy through
[49:04] Paul don't let no
[49:06] despise your youth hey that's the way
[49:09] they did me I'm telling you young people
[49:11] you know they always told me when I was
[49:13] young when I was young but they said to
[49:15] me oh that's not necessary
[49:18] you're fanatic this has told me that
[49:21] you're too much I was telling the
[49:27] brother the other day I'm still too much
[49:28] I can't help it and I don't want to stop
[49:33] at hallelujah if anybody know he needs
[49:36] grace I know it thank God for every bit
[49:40] I could get you what shall a man give in
[49:43] exchange for his soul
[49:44] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[49:46] me and of my words in this adulterous
[49:49] and sinful generation of him also shall
[49:51] the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh
[49:53] in the glory of his father with the Holy
[49:55] Angels if you are saying to be a
[49:57] Christian God would be a shame of you
[50:01] hallelujah amen it is nothing but the
[50:05] truth hallelujah
[50:07] is that right in Luke 6:46 I'm coming
[50:11] and wicked and why call you me Lord Lord
[50:13] and do not the things which I say woo
[50:17] whosoever cometh to me and here's my
[50:20] saying do it them I will show you to
[50:23] whom he is like he is like a man which
[50:27] built in house dig deep and laid the
[50:30] foundation on the rock and when the rock
[50:33] or when the flood arose and the stream
[50:35] beat vehemently upon that house and
[50:37] could not shake it but it was founded
[50:40] upon a rock so that's why everybody else
[50:44] is falling
[50:44] they didn't dig deep enough hallelujah
[50:47] they didn't hit the rock brother they
[50:50] hit everything but the rock if they had
[50:52] only seen God behind the veil of that
[50:55] little Kentuckian that it wasn't just a
[50:57] man if they had seen that that was God
[51:00] for our day to show us this is what you
[51:03] are to be hallelujah it ain't just
[51:07] looking at the Prophet is showing us who
[51:10] we ought to be when Christ feels you you
[51:13] ought to have the same dynamics
[51:18] we are super Church and until you
[51:21] believe you are super just let me tell
[51:23] you something you keep believing that
[51:25] whether you see anything or not abraham
[51:29] believed god and it was counted and
[51:31] imputed unto him as righteousness he
[51:34] believed what God said he didn't see he
[51:36] believed it though you don't have to see
[51:39] just believe it and God will bring it to
[51:41] pass
[51:44] hallelujah
[51:45] oh my god but he that heareth them do it
[51:49] not it's like a man that without a
[51:52] foundation built and house upon the
[51:54] earth I was telling somebody the other
[51:56] day I think they asked Jesus Christ know
[51:58] what what kind of what work what kind of
[52:00] work what kind of righteousness what
[52:02] what must be what must we do he said
[52:04] believe on Him whom God has sent that's
[52:08] your righteousness believe on Him whom
[52:12] God has sent that's how you make it
[52:17] because if you believe on him you're
[52:20] gonna do what he says
[52:22] you're gonna look you go you're gonna
[52:24] live it hallelujah
[52:28] what works what we work but we must do
[52:31] and that's what everybody what works I'm
[52:33] gonna tell you what works believe on Him
[52:34] whom God has said hallelujah that's your
[52:38] works and God will impute that as
[52:40] righteousness will somebody help me
[52:46] Corner Hebrews 11 and eight by faith
[52:48] Abraham when he was called to go out
[52:51] into a place which he should have to
[52:54] receive an inheritance obeyed
[52:55] and he went out not knowing whether he
[52:58] went somebody come on come on now you
[53:03] know so many people they don't
[53:04] understand it you know when I move when
[53:09] I moved from South Carolina up to Ohio
[53:11] people thought I was insane then but I'm
[53:14] Abraham see haha you know saying I go
[53:17] where he leads me hallelujah when I left
[53:21] there I had preachers I hide you gonna
[53:23] go over there they don't have enough
[53:24] money they don't have time enough people
[53:25] can't do this this enough
[53:27] let me tell you something he's never
[53:29] failed
[53:30] yeah hallelujah why it ain't about the
[53:34] money I told people I said let me tell
[53:37] you something if God sent me here take
[53:39] care of me hallelujah
[53:43] uh-huh I've never doubted yet I know he
[53:47] sent me here
[53:49] never daughter yet will not doubt right
[53:52] what storm God has vindicated himself
[53:55] too much here all kind of everybody and
[53:59] he got testimonies of healing and
[54:01] deliverance isn't any way let me move on
[54:03] see because faith when God speaks
[54:07] there's no way to explain it you don't
[54:10] even know how to tell somebody why are
[54:12] you doing what you do it you just know
[54:14] is a revelation is something that's
[54:16] taking place in you and you got to do it
[54:17] and you do it you move and God moves
[54:20] right because whenever you move by the
[54:23] Spirit of God he's right there to
[54:24] vindicate it is that right the property
[54:28] God said God won't vindicate a lie and
[54:33] he vindicates it he got vindicates it my
[54:38] face he served running the land of
[54:40] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[54:42] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the
[54:45] heirs with him of the same promise for

[55:15] people ye are the terrible temple of God

[55:25] God when John said the New Jerusalem
[55:27] ride the Lambs wife when she came down
[55:29] she had all these jewels don't you see
[55:32] people of God all I said this before all
[55:35] those jewels represent overcoming bride
[55:39] every stone I got a piece of a house

[56:44] enquire in his temple come on David what
[56:47] for in a time of trouble he shall hide
[56:51] me simple say that's trusting that's the
[56:54] rapture with these tribulations and

[58:20] and he stopped me from coming I'll go
[58:22] stop me from coming in the Holy Spirit
[58:23] said now he gonna give you a rough time
[58:24] talk to me just like a net I heard him I
[58:29] was okay I got up there and that man
[58:31] gave me a rough time so I kept stealing
[58:34] the holy get Holy Spirit say don't don't
[58:36] say no keep your mouth shut
[58:39] yes sir no sir yes sir you're right sir
[58:44] he had to let me go even when he didn't
[58:47] want to he said yeah y'all Americans
[58:49] give us a hard time and I'm gonna give
[58:51] you a hard time he was with it put on my
[58:56] passport you can't come back in here for
[58:58] three years I think it was yeah because
[59:01] he said oh you need a work permit and I
[59:03] didn't have one I'm not here for work oh
[59:06] are you gonna preach if they let me
[59:08] you preach I say yeah he said what did
[59:10] they buy your ticket how could that
[59:12] matter you know that devil was working I
[59:16] said yes sir they did see but they see
[59:18] now that's what you're wrong anyway to
[59:21] make a long story short I got in and got
[59:23] out it was God's will so you look at
[59:29] these things and you say oh brother what
[59:30] are you trying to say right now you must
[59:33] recognize that nothing matters more than
[59:37] card in you every bit of darkness has to
[59:45] go and you're gonna have to pray that
[59:49] you have not because you ask not if you
[59:52] keep asking God to deliver you from
[59:53] whatever darkness and you he will
[59:55] deliver you right it must go if not you
[1:00:01] still got some positive you still living
[1:00:03] God don't need you not that part
[1:00:06] is that right listen Matthew 22
[1:00:11] he says then said he to his servants the
[1:00:13] wedding is ready but they which were
[1:00:15] bidden we're not worthy you know I'm
[1:00:17] saying it like this I'm trying to do a
[1:00:19] much scriptures I can because I know
[1:00:21] there are people who are listening and
[1:00:23] and they probably more than likely
[1:00:25] taking down notes and here's a go ye
[1:00:28] therefore into highways and as many as
[1:00:30] you find bid to the marriage so those
[1:00:33] servants went out into the highway and
[1:00:36] gathered together all as many as they
[1:00:39] found both bad and good and the wedding
[1:00:42] was furnished with guests and when the
[1:00:44] king came to see the guests he saw the
[1:00:47] hurt there was a man which had not a
[1:00:49] wedding comment now we know the wedding
[1:00:52] garment is the Holy Spirit hello
[1:00:57] it is the virtues of God Christ nature
[1:01:00] that's own display in Moses day it was
[1:01:04] just the chemistry blood in this day it
[1:01:07] is the life of the blood when I see the
[1:01:10] token I'll pass over you not the
[1:01:13] chemistry the life when I see that life
[1:01:16] I will pass over you right I heard the
[1:01:19] Prophet God's sake that the devil cannot
[1:01:21] do anything to you until you get out of
[1:01:24] the will of God you become vulnerable
[1:01:32] so stay under the blood folks so those
[1:01:36] servants went out into the highways and
[1:01:37] gathered together all as many as they
[1:01:39] found but the bad and the both bad and
[1:01:41] good and the wedding was furnished with
[1:01:44] gas hey both bad and good why because
[1:01:48] God slipped a robe on him that was the
[1:01:51] thing that covered everything hallelujah
[1:01:54] bad angered you had to say Rolla Bolla
[1:01:57] that Holy Spirit amen covered you who
[1:02:01] hired me Oh God and when the king came
[1:02:04] to see the guests he saw that there a
[1:02:06] man which had not a wedding garment and
[1:02:08] he said unto Him friend how camest thou
[1:02:10] in hither not having a wedding garment
[1:02:12] and he was speechless then the king of
[1:02:15] the servant servants bind him hand and
[1:02:19] foot take him away and cast him into
[1:02:22] outer darkness and there shall be
[1:02:24] weeping in
[1:02:24] king of teeth now we always thought that
[1:02:26] was hell but that's not that's the true
[1:02:28] relation period hmm for as many a car
[1:02:34] meant for many are called but few are
[1:02:37] chosen
[1:02:38] can I go a little further try not to be
[1:02:41] too much too long too much longer Luke
[1:02:44] 14 21 through 2033 so that the service
[1:02:47] came and showed his Lord these things
[1:02:50] then the master of the house being angry
[1:02:52] said to his servant go out quickly into
[1:02:55] the streets and lanes of the city and
[1:02:57] bring in hither the poor and the maim
[1:03:00] and the halt and the blind you see what
[1:03:02] brothers why are you reading this
[1:03:03] because brother Branham told us he said
[1:03:08] when you see all Roberts people and
[1:03:10] Billy Graham's people they will all be
[1:03:13] all dressed up he said but my people
[1:03:16] would be on crutches weird he was that
[1:03:25] one God told him to go out go in there
[1:03:28] get the whole the main the lane right
[1:03:31] because the church world did did made
[1:03:34] excuses they didn't want to come so God
[1:03:37] start hitting the hedges in the house oh
[1:03:40] my god right in our day that's why you
[1:03:45] here cuz he was he was nobody there
[1:03:51] somebody will reject he may go out
[1:04:01] quickly in the street in lanes of the
[1:04:03] city and bringing here to the poor in
[1:04:06] the name in the halt in the blind and
[1:04:09] literally said and the servant said Lord
[1:04:12] servant not servants in the message of
[1:04:16] the love of our worker he brings that
[1:04:17] out he was that servant he had that
[1:04:22] Ministry of the lane of the highways and
[1:04:25] the byways and all of that bring them
[1:04:27] all in showing that we're right at the
[1:04:30] coming of the Lord
[1:04:31] when this portion of the scripture is
[1:04:33] fulfilled and somebody I feel like I
[1:04:37] feel pretty good
[1:04:38] why the lordís servant go out into the
[1:04:42] highways hedges and compel them to come
[1:04:45] in compare with a little you know come
[1:04:49] on man come on yes you're trying to
[1:04:52] persuade them right bring them in bring
[1:04:58] them in yeah cuz you know I sometime if
[1:05:00] you make somebody man that's a good
[1:05:02] thing when you preach in the gospel or
[1:05:05] teaching the gospel that is a good thing
[1:05:07] make a man because they won't forget it
[1:05:11] gotta have something to work with
[1:05:13] right I can't believe he says so I so so
[1:05:17] so they remember it and then God can say
[1:05:20] use that same scripture and work with
[1:05:22] him he can heat down the road he gonna
[1:05:24] say but you know they're right
[1:05:28] hallelujah or he gonna say W I said well
[1:05:31] you need to go in that scripture and
[1:05:32] prove them wrong oh praise God get them
[1:05:34] in the scripture god that's the way you
[1:05:38] want him you want him to go in there
[1:05:40] because by the time the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] finished with them they'll be convinced
[1:05:43] and being concerned
[1:05:45] hallelujah let me go on here listen God
[1:05:48] says listen father said to you none of
[1:05:51] those men which were bidden shall taste
[1:05:53] of my supper
[1:05:55] come on folks and you know it's the
[1:05:58] truth every one of those great leaders
[1:06:01] in the profit of God's day had no idea
[1:06:04] what they were refusing and here they
[1:06:07] were in the scripture lost the blind
[1:06:13] leaders lead the blind come on because
[1:06:17] of their decision they took a whole
[1:06:20] group of people with them from the time
[1:06:23] they rejected the gospel to the time
[1:06:25] that they preached it now y'all see what
[1:06:28] I'm saying
[1:06:28] and only the righteous will escape there
[1:06:33] are those who will escape but those who
[1:06:35] who trust in a bishop trust in the
[1:06:37] church trust in a system to save them
[1:06:40] they're lost I know what I'm talking
[1:06:43] about I was in that kind of a thing but
[1:06:49] I needed you see what I'm saying
[1:06:50] it's a
[1:06:52] footrace inhale right is this okay
[1:06:57] none of those bins were bidden shall
[1:07:00] taste of my supper think about a great
[1:07:02] man of God with all kinds of signs and
[1:07:04] wonders following them but chosen to be
[1:07:09] that kind of a vessel there was a great
[1:07:14] multitude with him and he turned and
[1:07:16] said unto them if any man come to me and
[1:07:18] hate not his father and mother and wife
[1:07:21] and children and brethren and sisters
[1:07:25] yang and his own life also he cannot be
[1:07:28] my disciples is that right and the
[1:07:32] prophet of God said is true he said many
[1:07:34] people were mystery after because of
[1:07:36] their family it's in their mystery after
[1:07:42] because within their families every time
[1:07:48] first the first since I heard that I
[1:07:50] said O God have mercy have mercy have
[1:07:53] mercy have mercy keep me right before
[1:07:55] you O Lord is true you said what do you
[1:08:02] mean well let me say it like this if
[1:08:04] Lord had looked back he would have been
[1:08:08] dead but is why because of her family
[1:08:13] she looked back and you and I must
[1:08:17] understand by God's grace amen
[1:08:19] there's no time you can't compromise it
[1:08:22] ain't no time for that no compromising
[1:08:26] they're going to either love you or hate
[1:08:28] you and Jesus said they're gonna hate
[1:08:29] you so let's go with it
[1:08:33] when you live writers they gonna hate
[1:08:35] you they don't love you they go that my
[1:08:37] family think I'm crazy I've been
[1:08:40] thinking that for years I'm crazy until
[1:08:43] they need money it's a - y'all know what
[1:08:49] the truth who's no they're not various
[1:08:51] cops come help them B cannot be my
[1:08:53] disciples for which of you intending to
[1:08:56] build a tower setting not down first
[1:08:59] and counted the cost whether he has
[1:09:01] sufficient to finish it I'm saying this
[1:09:03] because Jesus Christ is speaking of
[1:09:06] do you think God call you into this word
[1:09:11] knowing that he's going to lose it you
[1:09:15] know you're one of those stones that's
[1:09:16] gonna slip from the model or whatever oh
[1:09:18] no no he already count you in from the
[1:09:22] foundation of the world he knew exactly
[1:09:24] where you were going to fit in exactly
[1:09:27] right in the building of his kingdom
[1:09:30] listen we all are not great we're not
[1:09:32] all casting out Devils we're not all
[1:09:34] speaking in tongues but every junk we
[1:09:36] fit together we fit together
[1:09:40] every little joint fits together that
[1:09:45] alright I'm almost done let me read this
[1:09:53] quickly in the seal of God but then said
[1:09:56] jesus said a man went out and he worked
[1:09:59] and another man went out in another hour
[1:10:02] and he worked another man went out and
[1:10:05] worked and one man went out at the
[1:10:08] eleventh hour and when he stopped at the
[1:10:10] eleventh hour he give every one of them
[1:10:13] the same portion the eleventh hour they
[1:10:16] wondered why why did he got the eleventh
[1:10:19] hour everyone coming in Martin Luther
[1:10:22] that worked worked under Luther's
[1:10:25] dispensation died and grace others
[1:10:27] shouting met others shouting Methodists
[1:10:30] that died on the Wesley age died and
[1:10:33] grace we're living in another age not
[1:10:35] back there here but mother used to go in
[1:10:38] an ox cart and we go in a model v8 Ford
[1:10:42] almost jet propelled that's right we're
[1:10:44] living in a different age all together
[1:10:46] and we're living in a different
[1:10:48] dispensation we're living in the day of
[1:10:50] the restoration of the power of God see
[1:10:53] that that's not that that gets me
[1:10:55] statements like that we're living in the
[1:10:58] restoration of the power of God and
[1:11:00] right here see the power of God like
[1:11:03] they did in the beginning we're living
[1:11:05] in another age don't look back there -
[1:11:07] Wesley Methodists or all the other
[1:11:09] Baptists a Presbyterian look here -
[1:11:11] Jesus Christ the author and finisher of
[1:11:14] our faith
[1:11:14] the of the Bible hallelujah now watch
[1:11:17] him said hold it until what the
[1:11:19] 11-hour people come in the last calling
[1:11:23] of the gentiles now I love that I love
[1:11:26] that because that was world war one that
[1:11:28] God held back for you when the world the
[1:11:35] earth should have been destroyed the
[1:11:37] angels were ready it wasn't just for the
[1:11:40] Jews it was for the bride the 11th hour
[1:11:43] workers love of our level month level
[1:11:47] day Levant everything and to this day
[1:11:52] they don't know who stopped the war we
[1:11:54] can tell them God did why all these
[1:12:00] years have gone by did you know and I
[1:12:04] always tell people this I said don't you
[1:12:06] understand I said if those people who
[1:12:09] followed the Prophet at the time that
[1:12:11] they did if God had not allowed things
[1:12:13] to happen to throw him off track the
[1:12:17] rapture would have taken place Oh y'all
[1:12:23] don't believe that but it did they
[1:12:26] murmur it complain they fought among
[1:12:27] each other
[1:12:28] you shouldn't they did God told him look
[1:12:33] at the stone wait I'll get back they
[1:12:37] interpret the stone and with their own
[1:12:38] way that's why we saw many
[1:12:41] interpretations of this message because
[1:12:43] they didn't stay there like they should
[1:12:45] have hallelujah you understand me and so
[1:12:50] you look at these things you know what
[1:12:51] what worry brother it's the same thing
[1:12:54] God allowed Israel to do until rehab was
[1:12:58] mature it's for us he held Israel up 40
[1:13:06] years I don't even think we had was 40
[1:13:11] years old I don't know how old she was
[1:13:13] but she was still pretty yeah gggg is
[1:13:18] that right she had to be there when they
[1:13:21] came to the land you have to be here
[1:13:27] every name on the book must be made
[1:13:30] manifest we're not going nowhere until
[1:13:33] that last name is made manifest now
[1:13:41] faces the last coming of the Gentiles
[1:13:43] mother worked their daddy and then
[1:13:45] worked their grandmother worked back
[1:13:47] there this this is our age the eleventh
[1:13:50] hour

[1:13:52] month in the eleventh year the eleventh
[1:13:54] day of the month the eleventh hour in
[1:13:56] the day and the 11th minute in the hour
[1:13:58] that's the eleventh what people might
[1:14:01] come in what to receive the same baptism
[1:14:04] of the Holy Ghost that they did back
[1:14:07] there in the beginning I don't want a
[1:14:09] counterfeit don't give me a counterfeit
[1:14:12] give me the real deal see that's what's
[1:14:16] happening now in this world there's a
[1:14:18] lot of people receiving the counterfeit
[1:14:21] tell me in the scripture where Jesus
[1:14:23] they say I'm show you how to get
[1:14:26] electra-twist is the scripture if you
[1:14:28] just received Jesus in your heart
[1:14:33] receive him in your heart and you're
[1:14:35] going to be saved
[1:14:37] that ain't what Peter said Peter said
[1:14:40] repent see they jump they move away from
[1:14:43] repentance because if they say repent
[1:14:46] they gonna say repent from what then
[1:14:49] they got to tell them but they got to
[1:14:51] repent from but see that's the
[1:14:54] intellectual how they do that to the
[1:14:56] people and they're blind and the people
[1:14:58] and they give them a false experience a
[1:15:00] false world will give you a false
[1:15:02] experience you got to take him back to

[1:19:30] contest I'm so glad I didn't have to do
[1:19:33] nothing to merit this I'm so glad he
[1:19:36] chose me I just
[1:19:40] I'm just happy about that he ordained
[1:19:45] you that you should go and bring forth
[1:19:47] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:19:49] whatsoever you ask of the Father in my
[1:19:52] name he may give it you what fruit let
[1:19:56] it let it remain you know if you got a
[1:19:59] leak in the boxcar if it's not filled if
[1:20:03] it's not filled if a cast of trial can
[1:20:06] your box you ain't got it where it
[1:20:08] should be that's what he said the man he
[1:20:14] goes router you yeah I'm making all that
[1:20:17] noise he got a package some more before
[1:20:23] he can seal it it has to be packed solid
[1:20:27] mmm a supernatural God and the natural
[1:20:32] people makes them supernatural there's
[1:20:35] more to it I can't I'm not gonna finish
[1:20:37] it all but one thing I want to say about
[1:20:40] the grace of God like he said fear not
[1:20:45] on the flock is your father good will to
[1:20:48] give you the kingdom sitting together in
[1:20:51] heavenly places he goes on and say you
[1:20:54] Methodist Baptist pentateuch
[1:20:55] Presbyterian who has laughed at
[1:20:57] Pentecostals Pentecostals need a good
[1:21:00] old-fashioned gospel spanking because
[1:21:02] they organized the very Assembly of God
[1:21:05] has sent went into the biggest of
[1:21:08] Pentecost has joined the League of
[1:21:09] Churches just as formal and indifferent
[1:21:12] and the worst I ever seen the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] treated nearly was the Pentecostal
[1:21:18] preachers so don't think because you
[1:21:20] belong to a Pentecostal church you're
[1:21:22] saved you only say when your true
[1:21:25] baptized with God's Spirit by the Holy
[1:21:28] Ghost United with him in the power of
[1:21:30] his resurrection that right Paul says I
[1:21:33] save I don't want to know nothing save
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ and him crucified I want to
[1:21:38] know him in the power of his
[1:21:40] resurrection
[1:21:41] what good is it for me to claim that I'm
[1:21:44] a Christian if I have no authority and
[1:21:46] the power behind what I'm claiming it
[1:21:51] must it must work together right you
[1:21:55] only say when you're truly baptized with
[1:21:58] the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] United with him and the power of his
[1:22:02] resurrection going forth with signs and
[1:22:04] wonders following that spirit wherever
[1:22:06] it goes the signs follow the Prophet the
[1:22:10] signs follow Jesus Christ and the signs
[1:22:12] father apostles he said these signs
[1:22:14] shall follow them till he returned again
[1:22:18] go into the world and preach the power
[1:22:20] this power and demonstration to every
[1:22:23] nation he Terps it he says that he
[1:22:26] didn't say go again preach the gospel he
[1:22:28] said go into all the world and preach
[1:22:32] this power and demonstration to every
[1:22:35] nation huh
[1:22:37] it lacks two thirds of it yes yet has
[1:22:40] never heard it and these signs shall
[1:22:43] follow them every nation that's the mark
[1:22:46] of the beast see what what this is gonna
[1:22:52] sound strange to maybe some a lot a lot
[1:22:54] of people ears I believe this message
[1:22:59] with all my heart but what it has become
[1:23:02] what I see is not what I'm looking for
[1:23:09] I'm looking for what he preached that's
[1:23:14] what I'm looking for but Malachi 4
[1:23:16] preached that's what I'm thirsting for
[1:23:18] this this glamour that we got I was in
[1:23:22] the church one time and they had done
[1:23:24] rigged everybody up with these sound
[1:23:26] systems you know everybody got to hear
[1:23:29] everything perfectly what happened to
[1:23:32] them open Acosta that made noise and
[1:23:34] brought the Holy Ghost I said Lord let
[1:23:37] the Holy Ghost come down and strangle
[1:23:39] them not forgive I wouldn't write in
[1:23:43] never that shows in it but but then said
[1:23:45] if you think you might as well say but
[1:23:48] you know two people need a real rushing
[1:23:52] wind then they realized that stuff they
[1:23:55] got on their head is hazardous to the to
[1:23:58] them you can't bring the world in the
[1:24:01] church when we've got to be so perfect
[1:24:05] in that I'll tell you what I got no
[1:24:10] sister right now I won't call her name
[1:24:12] but she don't say no well but when she
[1:24:15] desired a singing she got her now
[1:24:17] unction from the Holy Ghost to sing she
[1:24:20] get up the Holy Ghost falls every time
[1:24:25] anything how good you sound what comes
[1:24:28] from the heart touches the heart
[1:24:31] you know and the thing about it is you
[1:24:33] know we got to get rid of all of this
[1:24:34] stuff that we've allowed to drift into
[1:24:38] our our our house you know what I'm
[1:24:41] saying all of these things that Matt
[1:24:43] don't matter to God we come together in
[1:24:45] fellowship in love and we supposed to
[1:24:47] worship God there's no such thing as
[1:24:49] begging people to praise them and being
[1:24:51] come on y'all that sing what you're
[1:24:56] supposed to be and you come in the house
[1:24:59] into its course with Thanksgiving into

[1:25:07] refilled you should've got we filled
[1:25:09] before you got here you know what I'm
[1:25:15] saying
[1:25:16] right then you encouraged himself in the
[1:25:20] Lord he was the only one at prayer
[1:25:23] meeting but it didn't stop him blessed
[1:25:27] and God building you're part of it
[1:25:31] he's working you you gonna suffer hey
[1:25:37] nobody likes their head but that's the
[1:25:40] way he designed it you go tried in the
[1:25:46] fire thank God for the gold

[1:25:53] come you understand me don't be afraid
[1:25:56] of it he will not destroy you only all
[1:26:01] this fire does is pull out all of the
[1:26:04] impurities of you so that at the end of
[1:26:07] the thing you got pure gold and he can
[1:26:10] see his reflection that's what he wants
[1:26:13] we came I'm closing on this note we

[1:28:00] live not far wouldn't even show up what
[1:28:03] do you think that is you know what God
[1:28:06] was doing breaking a judgment and people
[1:28:09] don't realize that's what he's doing
[1:28:11] God has never left himself without a
[1:28:13] witness hello
[1:28:15] oh come on folk it's the truth the Bible
[1:28:18] said the Queen of the South will stand
[1:28:20] in judgment why cuz she traveled all the
[1:28:26] way from bath sheep to come and hear
[1:28:29] this the wisdom of Solomon touch through
[1:28:35] the desert with no air-conditioning
[1:28:38] nothing no convenience nothing but

[1:28:44] see God live and God real and you and I
[1:28:48] I tell you the truth it's just it's just
[1:28:50] a matter and I thank God for all of you

[1:30:03] know it's those things that people think
[1:30:05] that God doesn't see he hears it he sees

[1:30:38] let's have a word of Prayer
[1:30:40] dear Jesus we know that is not him that
[1:30:46] willeth or he that running even your
[1:30:50] prophet of God said that if we had a
[1:30:52] mindset where we believe that our church
[1:30:55] saves us he said that's the mark of the
[1:30:57] beast the only thing that's the apostasy
[1:31:01] excuse me and he said the only thing
[1:31:04] that saves us is Grace and blood of
[1:31:06] Jesus Christ father I depend on what
[1:31:09] took place at Calvary I depend on how
[1:31:13] you when you as a lamb took that book
[1:31:16] that's that was in the right hand of him
[1:31:18] that sat on the throne and you released
[1:31:21] this word to us then it becomes a new
[1:31:23] book where it builds our character
[1:31:25] builds our our whole being but it sets
[1:31:29] us free until we get to a place Lord
[1:31:32] Jesus to see how free we are we can't be
[1:31:35] free and unfree it must be freedom one
[1:31:39] way or the other and you have done that
[1:31:42] for us and I'm so grateful Lord because
[1:31:47] your word has sealed us into your
[1:31:51] promises and we know that your promises
[1:31:54] are yay bless each and every heart keep
