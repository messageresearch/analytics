[12:03] speaking to you again I have only a few
[12:07] months left to stay with you here
[12:10] unfortunately I don't have time to be to
[12:13] be coming to church as often as I want
[12:15] to because I'm so busy I have to finish
[12:18] up with my teases by meters by April and
[12:22] I have to defend my thesis and it's a
[12:25] lot of work so if you don't see me here

[12:36] I'll do my best to come in and courage
[12:39] bravery name because I believe in
[12:40] fellowship so bad I hate heavenly
[12:45] righteous God want to thank and bless
[12:47] your Holy Name
[12:48] this morning I want to thank you O God
[12:51] that you are never without a witness
[12:54] Lord we are meeting as a witness that
[12:57] there is a God in heaven has sent his
[12:59] message to this world in his endtime and
[13:02] that there is a remnant in the morning
[13:05] in Windsor Heights all over the
[13:08] surrounding the morning that believe
[13:11] this truth and we are congregating this
[13:13] morning Lord around that bread of life
[13:16] that came down from heaven trusting that
[13:19] we shall feed on it and our hungry souls
[13:23] will be satisfied Lord come down Lord
[13:27] even as you broke that bread to those
[13:30] two brothers died chained it from
[13:32] Jerusalem to a mouse and they recognized
[13:34] you Lord may be present this morning a
[13:37] breaking of thy bread that's this little
[13:40] flock will recognize you that you are in
[13:43] our miss you are not in a multitude but
[13:47] you are in little places like this
[13:49] precious father I yield myself
[13:51] completely unto you praying that you
[13:54] come and take control of my lives that I
[13:56] would say only those things that would
[13:58] edify and encourage somebody Lord Jesus
[14:02] Christ of Nazareth
[14:03] it's a trembling fear that one day I'll
[14:06] have to account for every way that I
[14:08] speak from this altar but I'm trusting
[14:11] law that I'm not I'm not going to speak
[14:13] of my own but I'm coming to speak what
[14:15] you have given to your prophet for this
[14:17] age Lord their food into seizing have
[14:23] mercy on us this morning even in Jesus
[14:25] name we pray amen hallelujah less than
[14:29] our Bibles to Acts chapter 1 sorry for
[14:33] keeping you Stanley
[14:34] I'll read quickly so we can proceed Acts
[14:37] chapter 1 where I read verse 7 and 8
[14:39] then we read again Matthew 24 Acts
[14:48] chapter 1 verse 7 and 8
[14:51] then again Matthew 24 so except our one
[14:56] verse 7 reads and he said unto them it
[14:59] is not for you to know the times or the
[15:02] seasons which the father has put in his
[15:05] own power but ye shall receive power
[15:10] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[15:12] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[15:15] both in Jerusalem in and in all Judea
[15:19] and in Samaria
[15:20] and unto the uttermost parts of the
[15:23] earth amen
[15:25] let's flip back to Matthew Matthew 24
[15:31] Matthew 24 all right verse 14 just 1
[15:48] this and this gospel of the kingdom
[15:52] shall be preached in all the world for a
[15:57] witness unto all nations and then shall
[16:00] the end come may the Lord bless the
[16:05] reading of his word amen shall be seated
[16:13] hallelujah give me your undivided
[16:17] attention for the next few minutes and
[16:21] we'll be done and don't hallelujah
[16:27] beloved in Christ this morning I want to
[16:29] speak to you on the topic a qualified
[16:34] witness a qualified witness amen we are
[16:42] supposed to be ghost witnesses and when
[16:48] our Lord was living this earth some
[16:51] 2,000 years ago he gave his disciples
[16:56] and by extension those who believe on
[16:59] his disciples what we call in a Bible
[17:03] the Great Commission hallelujah
[17:08] the Great Commission he said go out into
[17:14] the world and preach the gospel it's
[17:18] written in the Gospels and in the acts
[17:23] of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles just
[17:26] before the Lord was taken away visibly
[17:28] in their sight this was the last thing
[17:31] that he told them when they were asking
[17:33] to know
[17:34] are you going to restore the kingdom
[17:36] again back to Israel he said it is not
[17:41] in your power to know the times and the
[17:45] seasons that the father has proposed to
[17:47] do his things hallelujah my heart you
[17:50] are supposed to know now is that you
[17:53] must be my witnesses
[17:55] starting from Jerusalem in all of Judea
[17:59] into Samaria and into Iowa hallelujah so
[18:04] we are covered said the whole world amen
[18:06] and fortunately hidden e and it's in
[18:10] Samaria in gdf not I only have it
[18:12] covered because I come from a very
[18:15] remote part of the world very remote
[18:18] village but words that were spoken 2,000
[18:22] years ago found me there hallelujah amen
[18:27] so that was the Great Commission that
[18:29] has been given to us and it's often
[18:31] referred to as a Great Commission of the
[18:34] change we must evangelize hallelujah my
[18:37] brother before they could go out to
[18:40] evangelize she says told them that you
[18:46] aren't qualified yet to be my witnesses
[18:49] amen if you go out this way you'll be
[18:53] defeated if you go out this way the
[18:57] outcome would not be good so you wait in
[19:01] Jerusalem amen wait in Jerusalem till
[19:06] you have met the requirement of a true
[19:09] witness when you have met the
[19:11] requirements and you go out you'll be
[19:13] victorious and possibly the disciples
[19:19] might have been wondering but he gave us
[19:25] power I mean in Luke 11 and in other
[19:28] scriptures you read that when he
[19:31] commissioned the seven year he
[19:33] commissioned the twelve and when they
[19:36] went out and he came back what testimony
[19:38] they bring back he said Devils were
[19:42] subject to us when we spoke or when we
[19:46] preach and mention your name
[19:47] demons were
[19:48] FLE so by the disciples own
[19:52] understanding they knew what it was to
[19:56] go out and go and preach in the name of
[19:58] Jesus hallelujah so they might have
[20:03] wondered how is it a game that this man
[20:06] is saying that we should wait to really
[20:11] target what of the power he gave us when
[20:13] we went out wouldn't that be sufficient
[20:16] for us bother me with witnesses are you
[20:20] following Church so they might have
[20:23] wondered but I'm sure the day that they
[20:28] met the qualification they knew the
[20:31] difference hallelujah
[20:34] I said the day that the medical if
[20:36] occasion they knew the difference and
[20:37] you see where Abraham made a distinction
[20:41] without him would he have known he made
[20:44] we have a lujah that's why you can't do
[20:49] without the Prophet for this end time he
[20:53] made a distinction between having the
[20:56] gifts of the Holy Ghost and having a
[20:58] giver so at the time that they went out
[21:02] in Luke and Matthew and in all our
[21:04] scriptures when the twelve winter when
[21:05] the seventy went out and they preach
[21:08] demons were truly subject to them
[21:11] hallelujah
[21:12] but don't forget in that when they went
[21:15] out Judas was part of them hallelujah so
[21:21] demons were subject to them they could
[21:24] cast out demons they could heal the sick
[21:27] they could perform all the miracles but
[21:31] they didn't have the giver inside then
[21:37] we have the giver and that is the good
[21:41] thing that we know in this Center
[21:43] because the Pentecostals before the
[21:45] Prophet came on the scene were also
[21:47] deceived likewise the hardness is a
[21:52] street revival in 1906 and they carried
[21:56] on in their revival and you remember the
[21:59] message of the Prophet
[22:01] where he met this Pentecostals and this
[22:04] people speaking tongues and they could
[22:05] interpret and he said it was like a
[22:08] machine gun fire said wow I've never met
[22:12] a group as great as this this is what I
[22:15] have been longing for hallelujah
[22:18] after the meeting he went and greeted
[22:20] the two men one was a genuine believer
[22:26] the other was a hypocrite he was married
[22:30] by had a mistress and we had a child by
[22:32] the mistress and the Prophet has had
[22:36] this gift all through his life so he saw
[22:40] it and to him say I see you are married
[22:42] but for shufai
[22:44] that was somebody who had anointing who
[22:49] could speak in tongues who could
[22:51] interpret a tongue genuinely I'm not
[22:54] talking about the victims to the Ali
[22:56] Baba Baba like some madhouse and I'm not
[22:58] talking about that I'm talking about the
[23:01] genuine tones that came Pentacles or a
[23:06] disaster let me put it away I promise I
[23:14] could understand it he when said I don't
[23:18] you know some of you know the story when
[23:19] searching the scriptures fellow Hebrews
[23:21] is he ready we understand it God gave
[23:24] him the interpretation hallelujah so
[23:28] beloved the disciples before Jesus
[23:31] Christ went away had manifested the
[23:36] power of the Holy Ghost
[23:37] they are exercised the gifts of the Holy
[23:40] Ghost they had seen the gift of healing
[23:43] of course they had the a limitations and
[23:47] they had done all those things but Jesus
[23:51] was telling them that you are not yet
[23:54] qualified to be my witnesses so you wait
[23:58] in Jerusalem when you wait in Jerusalem
[24:01] the qualification will come when the
[24:03] qualification comes you realize it
[24:05] yourself
[24:06] you go out there and you testify of me
[24:10] hallelujah very some time ago I preached
[24:13] a sermon here that I can't
[24:15] those days were not doing the youtube
[24:18] link so I don't think it's on YouTube
[24:19] but I mean if we have all the things
[24:22] there should be some way that this
[24:24] gospel of the kingdom so brethren you
[24:27] see as God was in the beginning so shall
[24:32] it be in the end that is why in a Bible
[24:35] the Bible makes a lot of references to
[24:37] things of the past it was in the days of
[24:40] Noah as it was in the days of pseudo
[24:44] hallelujah and I have two people always
[24:47] that the world is overly focused on what
[24:52] the evil that happened in the days of
[24:54] Sodom
[24:55] there are overly focused on the evil
[24:57] that happen in the days of Noah but for
[25:00] me as a bride of Jesus Christ I'm
[25:02] focused on what Noah did right admit it
[25:05] me as a bride of Jesus Christ I'm
[25:08] focused on what Abraham did right and
[25:10] was not in sodium but he stayed who the
[25:14] angel that came down as mighty God that
[25:17] is what is my focus hallelujah of course
[25:20] I can look at what happened among those
[25:23] who are perishing in sodium and
[25:25] understand the condition of the world
[25:26] but for me I have to study carefully
[25:29] what did Abraham do right I he made it
[25:31] and I believe that applies to you too
[25:35] hallelujah so beloved ask God was in the
[25:39] beginning as he was in the beginning
[25:42] parabrahma said that the first thing
[25:46] that God did is always a correcting
[25:49] hallelujah so when he came out with a
[25:53] church on the day of Pentecost filled
[25:56] with the Holy Ghost and power that was
[25:58] the standard so Pentecost is always what
[26:02] their standard when when William Branham
[26:05] was teaching about a church ages
[26:09] amen he said he used a biblical standard
[26:14] he said the first church age without
[26:17] question in the Bible was led by poor
[26:20] support we all know that he was apostle
[26:22] to the Gentiles so how did he find the
[26:24] messengers for the subsequent age is
[26:26] simple that was was
[26:29] ministry was process to Paul because
[26:31] God's first work was poor and that is
[26:34] the standard so in the subsequent it is
[26:36] the one whose ministry was closest to
[26:39] Paul he was the one chosen as the leader
[26:43] of that age or the messenger of the age
[26:46] hallelujah reverence so in the same vein
[26:49] the standard is always Pentacles the LHH
[26:53] hallelujah so the church that patterns
[26:58] more closely after Pentacles is a true
[27:02] church rather because we have so many
[27:05] churches and so many interpretations but
[27:08] in the mists of counterfeit there has to
[27:10] be a genuine currency beloved if there
[27:14] is nothing like dollar the US dollar
[27:16] bill I don't have one in my pocket the
[27:18] US all of you if there is nothing like
[27:20] that will their signature the Treasury
[27:24] secretary if you go manufacturing dollar
[27:28] bills you can't use it because there's
[27:29] no currency called dollar but the reason
[27:32] why if you manufa
[27:34] doing counterfeit dollar you may be able
[27:36] to get away with it and use it some ways
[27:38] because there's a currency called dollar
[27:40] so Breitling the reason why there's
[27:42] counterfeit gospel is because there is
[27:44] genuine gospel hallelujah but it is
[27:49] God's desire that as it was in the
[27:52] beginning when that where there was a
[27:53] clear distinction between genuine Holy
[27:56] Ghost gospel and counterfeit gospel in
[27:59] this end time before he comes again for
[28:02] his bride that distinction has been made
[28:04] a game and God is looking up to you it's
[28:07] looking up to me for that distinction to
[28:10] be made
[28:11] hallelujah brother so it's not a small
[28:14] bet in doubt with Terry on our show this
[28:16] that is why when we come here this is
[28:18] not a time for us to be struggling with
[28:20] basic living this is not a time for the
[28:23] preacher to come and be struggling with
[28:24] the way you dress our sisters the way
[28:26] issue I mean you should look as brethren
[28:29] hallelujah
[28:31] these things we should have overcome
[28:33] them by now and we should be looking
[28:34] forward to rest coming on the Lord for
[28:37] another Pentacles that will put us in
[28:39] the rapture hallelujah because when I
[28:41] win up
[28:42] so hope we've got now cannot make it we
[28:46] need something that is going to defy Oh
[28:49] hallelujah that is going to defy the
[28:51] laws of gravity and Flass hallelujah so
[28:56] brethren is the time for us to be
[28:59] serious is a time families has to pray
[29:02] this is the time that we say no to
[29:05] everything so this was because the devil
[29:07] is born bugging you with everything
[29:09] hallelujah
[29:10] I bought a phone when when did I buy my
[29:14] last one Laos I think last year January
[29:16] or so it's not obsolete I'm sure if I
[29:19] buy one now by next year to be obsolete
[29:22] hallelujah they are just bombarding us
[29:25] with things people cannot talk anymore
[29:27] you sit in a bus now
[29:29] I used the school bus a lot everybody's
[29:33] on a gadget hallelujah if we couples
[29:41] cannot have quality times to talk every
[29:44] when they are eating there's a phone bag
[29:46] I remember one lady in my country
[29:51] remarked to me said she visited a cup of
[29:54] work we are offering student was telling
[29:56] them that he saw in the 90 plus from
[30:00] where you don't know somebody's by the
[30:01] laptop you want corner up the ladies
[30:04] also buy the laptop and they don't I see
[30:07] some homework someway fully I was
[30:11] telling me I can't live that way sort of
[30:13] life is that I mean there is something
[30:18] wrong and we have to say this incident
[30:21] will recognize it and we put our lives
[30:24] right we can't be married to gadgets and
[30:27] I said that applies to me it's not like
[30:29] I'm free from it it's it's a disease
[30:32] that I caught all of us including me we
[30:37] can't be married to gadgets but if there
[30:40] is something I should be married to that
[30:41] is it this is the time that you are
[30:44] supposed to be married to this the Word
[30:47] of God the Bible so we are supposed to
[30:51] be his witnesses
[30:54] by witnesses of what witnesses of the
[30:57] gospel of the kingdom so in my Semin
[31:01] some months ago about this gospel of the
[31:03] kingdom
[31:04] it meant said much is 24 way we read is
[31:10] saying that the gospel of the kingdom
[31:12] has to be preached the whole world
[31:14] before he can come because if it is not
[31:20] preached to the whole world as a witness
[31:23] he will not be justified in trying
[31:25] anybody may be caught hallelujah and our
[31:30] God is a just God so he must give
[31:35] everybody an opportunity hallelujah
[31:39] so when brother Brown was preaching
[31:41] these in the 50s in the 60s Rob Ram said
[31:45] that in some messages he said that only
[31:49] one-third of the world has had a gospel
[31:51] in all our messages he said how well has
[31:54] had a gospel hallelujah Amen now but see
[32:01] the Prophet when he speaks you just
[32:04] continue really just continuous steady
[32:06] you understand you understand him how
[32:08] could he say one place that who has said
[32:10] that gospel so Jesus Christ is coming
[32:11] and another place you say that only one
[32:13] tell has had a gospel so we have to do
[32:15] more
[32:16] amen bye see the truth is that there are
[32:19] two kinds of gospel amen
[32:22] LeBron distinguish between two kinds of
[32:25] gospel and one kind of gospel one type
[32:28] of the gospel has gone around the whole
[32:29] world but the true gospel the one that
[32:35] Apostle Paul preached the one that Peter
[32:38] preach the true gospel that John
[32:41] followed the wonderfully preached in the
[32:44] deserts of Samaria the one that he
[32:46] preached that European Enoch the one
[32:49] that he went and preached in Samaria and
[32:50] even Simon associate got converted that
[32:54] gospel has not gone around the world but
[32:58] there is a gospel of tracks there is
[33:02] problem call it a psychic part of the
[33:05] gospel
[33:07] the psychic part of the gospel the
[33:10] mental part of the gospel that geology
[33:13] part of the gospel you see when Jesus
[33:15] told the disciples to tarry in Jerusalem
[33:18] till they are endued with power he
[33:21] didn't say Tyree
[33:22] in Jerusalem till you are taught enough
[33:27] geology to go out with he didn't say
[33:31] Terry in Jerusalem amen till you are
[33:35] taught enough Greece to go out with till
[33:39] you know how to recite all the Torah
[33:41] before you can go out he said Terry in
[33:47] Jerusalem until you are endued with
[33:50] power amen
[33:53] so Rob Rob said personal tract teaching
[34:01] geology hallelujah is not preaching the
[34:06] gospel and beloved endtime I said
[34:10] believers this is where we are missing
[34:11] it oh can I say that again
[34:15] I say anytime I say believers this is
[34:18] where we are missing it we are overly to
[34:21] focus on geology to that geology has
[34:23] divided us into many pieces and segments
[34:28] and there's nothing wrong with geology
[34:31] I'm not saying there's something wrong I
[34:33] say
[34:34] anytime I see believers are to focus on
[34:37] what geology they are to focus on
[34:41] mysteries they want to do a typology
[34:46] they want to take a mystery from the Old
[34:48] Testament and put it in the days of
[34:49] Abraham nothing wrong with that beloved
[34:54] winner Brom said the highlight of my
[34:59] entire ministry is that talking
[35:03] he said be born again and going to
[35:06] Pentacles that is the whole essence of
[35:10] the coming of the prophet of God receive
[35:14] the new birth cuts divine revelation
[35:17] about where Christ is hiding in your day
[35:20] well he that believes that Jesus Christ
[35:24] is born of God is of God is that no some
[35:28] of the scriptures
[35:31] that's what John said in first John
[35:33] chapter 5 verse 1 I mean so kinda
[35:37] Revelation divine revelation is
[35:38] important catch it
[35:39] Peter caught it ye are the Christ the
[35:42] Son of the Living God he said flesh and
[35:46] blood has not revealed this to you by my
[35:48] father who is in heaven and you are
[35:50] Peter and on this rock I will build my
[35:53] church and the gates of Hell will not
[35:55] prevail against it that's true if my
[35:57] revelation is important in name divine
[36:01] revelation must change your life when it
[36:04] changes your life you must move on
[36:06] through that pyramid and get to
[36:08] pentacles that's the whole essence of
[36:11] what we believe that because when you
[36:14] live a life of power you are the
[36:17] greatest witness you are the greatest
[36:18] testimony that God has on earth
[36:23] hallelujah amen
[36:26] I'm feeling inspired this morning amen
[36:29] so beloved in Christ there's a
[36:32] scriptural requirement LeBron said look
[36:35] before you can be a witness even in our
[36:40] law courts one of the things that I
[36:45] don't know how many of us having to
[36:46] contrive into God and one of the things
[36:49] that a good attorney would do if you
[36:52] have a witness is to question the
[36:53] credibility of the witness
[36:54] you know that they have something they
[36:56] call cross-examination and when you have
[36:59] been your witness is being
[37:00] cross-examined enough I mean in serious
[37:03] high-profile cases like in meta trials
[37:05] and things like that somebody who said
[37:07] he saw it you have to question him
[37:10] where were you when you said you saw it
[37:13] what happened if they notice any
[37:15] discrepancies in the things that you say
[37:20] questions your credibility and we want
[37:23] to true Matt as much as possible to your
[37:26] credibility so that they judge you see
[37:27] this is not a credible witness I can't
[37:29] rely on his testimony to pass judgment
[37:31] is that right now but in the same way
[37:37] I'll come to that versa but let me say
[37:40] it before I continue in the same way if
[37:41] you go out there as a witness of the
[37:45] Lord Jesus Christ as a witness of this
[37:48] gospel hallelujah
[37:50] that enemy the devil has his has his
[37:53] lawyers out there yes his demons out
[37:56] there
[37:56] he has his defense attorneys out there
[37:58] who are going to question your
[38:00] credibility well ah so you better be a
[38:02] credible witness or you don't venture
[38:04] out Alleluia I said better be a credible
[38:08] witness or you don't think how they
[38:10] don't know what you are talking about if
[38:16] you don't know what you are talking
[38:17] about
[38:17] don't go say it I'll give you some
[38:19] examples very soon about my first time
[38:21] when I went out what I experienced
[38:23] myself hallelujah amen
[38:26] but let's go back to this idea about the
[38:29] gospel of the kingdom memory so we must
[38:31] be witnesses to the gospel of the
[38:33] kingdom and I'm saying that the gospel
[38:35] of the kingdom is the original gospel
[38:37] our streets and Pentacles amen and in
[38:40] this end time we have seen we saw a
[38:42] church we saw a man that exemplified
[38:47] that same gospel and even more because
[38:52] he said what he did in my ministry in
[38:55] one night was more than what he did his
[38:58] own earthly ministry for three and a
[39:00] half years hallelujah because jesus said
[39:05] that I go to the Father hallelujah that
[39:10] when I go I'll send you the promise of
[39:12] the father hallelujah when you if you
[39:15] received our promise amen
[39:18] you are going to do more works that I
[39:20] have done and we saw that that on the
[39:26] day of Pentecost when pentacles finally
[39:28] came and Peter went out there with the
[39:31] on the twelve and with all their
[39:33] 120-dollar in the upper room power from
[39:35] for service came and they were preaching
[39:38] and yeah shadows were healing people
[39:40] when paul made a lot on the road to
[39:43] damascus after his conversion he started
[39:46] preaching and aprons and hacka Jews were
[39:48] placed on his body and carried to
[39:49] distant lands and people were healed and
[39:51] he is so passe I did not come to you in
[39:54] the excellency of speech he said when I
[39:58] came if my gospel my gospel was not in
[40:00] fine West my gospel was 14 flurry worse
[40:03] when I sewed on my my African assets
[40:06] hallelujah
[40:08] cause we must come him power south
[40:12] flurry waves it's not how beautiful
[40:14] people are falling dead before I'm ox
[40:18] look at these churches you are Austin
[40:21] and all these mighty preachers with
[40:24] fifteen hundred thousand congregation
[40:27] nine speakers amen brother
[40:31] problem was not a nice picker he didn't
[40:34] know his grammar a man species English
[40:41] like a Kentucky a country boy amen
[40:45] I didn't did it yes that's correct
[40:49] God doesn't care about your loss of
[40:51] grammar he doesn't care about that but
[40:55] the man had power I say he had power God
[40:59] gave him power he was a qualified
[41:02] witness hallelujah so brethren the
[41:09] gospel of trucks and literature probrem
[41:13] said if that gospel is the only place
[41:17] the gospel thomas go around the world
[41:19] then the indians are finished you know
[41:24] the Indians are they believe in many
[41:25] gods
[41:26] I don't know how many of you have
[41:28] traveled to India before there are idols
[41:30] everywhere they believe in the
[41:33] Astrophysical world where I come from
[41:37] Africa
[41:39] I mean Ghana West Africa you know how
[41:41] many of your head of juju they mean
[41:43] Ghana to Guam or my people especially
[41:45] and we're people we are their home of
[41:47] Juji and I know what I'm talking about
[41:51] and you better you can't go out there
[41:54] and talk about bye boo when you don't
[41:58] know what you are talking about you die
[42:00] I have a friend who was like that
[42:05] he told he was all-powerful and he used
[42:08] to go to these shrines to win pray he
[42:10] said he was battling them spiritually to
[42:12] destroy their power
[42:13] that's all I he did they call it prayer
[42:15] genies living went as far as the
[42:17] pyramids of Egypt where pre day that's a
[42:19] symbol of idolatry and he started
[42:22] venturing out to my region to win pray
[42:26] Chris just died
[42:28] tight like a slain like excuse my
[42:31] language like a dog just started having
[42:35] some back pain and he went to every
[42:38] hospital he couldn't be dead what it was
[42:41] he just died but you better know what we
[42:45] are talking about when William Brandt
[42:48] got to Bombay and you know the story of
[42:51] the blind man that the man that was
[42:54] blind from what sheep in the Sun he told
[42:57] a story about a man I was blind from
[42:58] worshiping the Sun and he challenged the
[43:03] muhammadans
[43:04] my god because in the vision that his
[43:09] God could make this man who he said look
[43:14] if you can come
[43:15] it's like Elijah in the professor bow if
[43:20] you can come and make this man who I
[43:23] believe your God so I stand here calm I
[43:27] said they said no one can do it
[43:28] you know they were already in a crowd
[43:30] because before them by Brahma I've seen
[43:32] a vision and a vision told him that
[43:33] there will be three hundred thousand
[43:35] people at a meeting to be a him as far
[43:39] as his eye scoffs it was that's seized
[43:41] of people said come heal him none of
[43:48] them came and when he prayed and God had
[43:54] his prayer and God open the eyes of that
[43:56] person it's not Ramu did it
[43:59] God made no distinction when God open
[44:04] the eyes of that man what do you think
[44:06] those people would do they run in your
[44:11] tassles to the altar to assert that God
[44:14] the God who open the eye of the blind
[44:20] hallelujah
[44:22] brethren well problem go to Durban South
[44:27] Africa when he go to South Africa and
[44:30] Southern Africa Tanganyika in these
[44:32] places that he went at a time
[44:35] LeBron go there and the African natives
[44:39] came and they were holding idols muha
[44:43] Brahm said we have been sending
[44:45] missionaries to these people for years
[44:49] and they came and they packed the idols
[44:52] one of them he mean stop and ask him why
[44:55] is he still carrying the idol he told
[44:57] him how the idols save him from a lion
[44:59] attack before and that if if he's
[45:02] carrying me because if God feels this
[45:04] one who know filled why because they
[45:11] were taught the gospel of tracks they
[45:16] were taught the psychic side of the
[45:19] gospel let me read let me read this to
[45:23] you in life story 54 amen
[45:26] they read the gospel of tracks is what
[45:31] has gone around the world but this
[45:35] gospel of the kingdom must also go
[45:37] around the world if it doesn't happen
[45:39] the end you know come he said this
[45:43] gospel of the kingdom must go around the
[45:45] world
[45:48] look at how Brabham put it he said in a
[45:52] message life story
[45:58] she said oh no let me read first one he
[46:02] did commissioned us to preach the gospel
[46:05] to all the world and one third of the
[46:08] world is all does head about Jesus but
[46:12] after all person trust is not preaching
[46:17] the gospel Oh hallelujah
[46:20] it doesn't mean the passing tracks is
[46:21] wrong I mean I hope you are mature
[46:24] enough to understand it hallelujah the
[46:27] gospel came not in word only said Paul
[46:31] but true power and demonstration of the
[46:35] Holy Ghost brethren this is what is
[46:38] lacking in today's Gospel and I'm saying
[46:41] that just as in the beginning God
[46:45] brought the gospel in power and
[46:47] demonstration of his way to make a
[46:49] distinction between the Jews and the
[46:51] true believers in this end time before
[46:54] rapture he must do the same
[46:59] hallelujah I say in this end time before
[47:02] a rapture he must do the same
[47:04] but because I know something in the
[47:07] Bible and I always question myself till
[47:10] I found the answers in brother Browns
[47:12] message you know brahbrah mean sub from
[47:15] 1960 instead he started questioning
[47:17] himself why is it that all the revived a
[47:20] revival that he used to have in the 50s
[47:23] and the 40's why's that those things are
[47:24] not happening again
[47:26] before God told him that the revival was
[47:29] over hallelujah
[47:33] and now that we understand by the
[47:37] message that when Jesus Christ came
[47:39] Jesus Christ had a revival among the
[47:43] Jews the whole population both Jews and
[47:46] Samaritans there were SWAT Reviva when
[47:52] he fed the five thousand the five
[47:54] thousand were not only believers and
[47:56] followers of his message because at the
[47:58] time that Jesus Christ finishes mission
[48:01] three half years and he was living he
[48:04] had made only 120 converts that's how
[48:08] hard the heart of - the Lord
[48:12] the creator himself dwell in a body came
[48:16] to this egg and it will have three and a
[48:19] half years after raising the dead after
[48:23] healing the sick after cleansing the
[48:26] leper after making the lame walk after
[48:29] stopping the blood issue of twelve years
[48:31] and after all that 120 that's how hard
[48:38] of moneys in name amen
[48:44] so when I come here and I mean this is
[48:49] not a packed place something that
[48:53] rejoices my heart I don't have always in
[48:57] my life belong to small churches it's
[49:02] not my choice
[49:04] I didn't choose that way but in my
[49:06] search for the truth
[49:07] I've always found that the truth is
[49:09] hidden in very small little places when
[49:12] nobody assets I've been to big churches
[49:17] before don't get me wrong and these
[49:20] I go there and I don't find the
[49:22] truth day hallelujah so beloved Jesus
[49:31] Christ came to this earth and when he
[49:36] was living amen
[49:39] small number of people of course after
[49:44] Pentecost the animal was added to but
[49:47] still during the minority so when he
[49:51] came and preached the Jews preached the
[49:53] four thousand preach the multitude and a
[49:57] lot of people were there when he was
[50:02] crucified amen
[50:05] that ended the revival for the Jews get
[50:11] a physically that and then what the
[50:15] revival for the Jews but the revival of
[50:19] those who believed on him started after
[50:24] Pentacles
[50:26] are you getting it so all was of
[50:30] apologies because they have rejected the
[50:32] message but for those who believe Jesus
[50:36] when he came they revived I was yet to
[50:39] start but I believe that the same thing
[50:44] is repeating in this end time but
[50:48] Abraham came and preached to hundreds of
[50:51] thousands he healed
[50:53] hundreds of thousands of thousands
[50:57] hundreds of thousands I don't know the
[50:59] number
[50:59] by the way meaning you know the
[51:02] testimonies but by 1960 the Pentecostals
[51:09] died he came to have rejected him there
[51:12] were no more moving with him he said his
[51:15] teaching his doctrine was wrong so they
[51:19] had rejected him but the small group
[51:23] that accepted him just like the smoked
[51:25] guta accepted Jesus Christ amen
[51:28] that small group must move on to
[51:31] pentacles what for for the rapture
[51:36] same pattern are you getting it so all
[51:40] the world can not see another revival
[51:44] are you getting it the world will never
[51:47] see another river because every they'd
[51:49] miss their hour of visitation just like
[51:53] Israel miss her hour of visitation so
[51:56] the world miss her our visitation the
[52:01] purifier came down again and they
[52:04] rejected it that is why brother Brown
[52:06] preach the message indictments spinach
[52:13] the cancer in a they can't see any
[52:15] revival again but listen the bride of
[52:19] Jesus Christ does a little group that
[52:22] will remain faithful to the message that
[52:24] the Prophet brought the group is
[52:26] promised a revival tour rapture so same
[52:32] pattern same pattern
[52:37] hallelujah let me give you another coat
[52:42] he said in a message Great Commission
[52:47] said Jesus said into all the world these
[52:50] signs are followed and the gospel come
[52:53] not in word only but true power and
[52:57] manifestation of the Holy Spirit the
[52:59] same taught the Bible said they went for
[53:03] preaching everywhere the Lord working
[53:06] with them with signs following
[53:11] hallelujah
[53:12] but I've already told you that science
[53:15] can follow you without a giver because
[53:19] the disciple started signs that they're
[53:22] following the disciples before Pentecost
[53:25] so science following you it's not an
[53:29] invitation that you had The Giver
[53:31] you must go on and be sure Rob Ram said
[53:35] it is when you can say Amen to every
[53:37] word of God
[53:38] when every word of God does and Kobol
[53:41] cannot reject it so wait is that when I
[53:44] advise you when I want to advise you
[53:46] amen and your heart to reject it then
[53:49] there's something wrong when I tell you
[53:51] that the Prophet says this is wrong
[53:54] that is wrong or when pasta tells you or
[53:57] valetroy tells you and you in your heart
[54:00] you reject it there is something wrong
[54:02] it means that give us no day because the
[54:05] give is there I can't tell you something
[54:07] from the bronze message and you throw it
[54:09] away and you go on and do it anyhow and
[54:12] live anyhow because the the most
[54:17] difficult people to preach to our people
[54:19] that are seen signs and wonders in their
[54:22] life I have a friend like that on campus
[54:26] because he's a preacher he preaches and
[54:29] see signs and wonders if you tell him
[54:31] anything about this message take it but
[54:35] God cannot reject it oh wait is that
[54:37] button or jet is on wait so if something
[54:40] is in the word and you are told and you
[54:42] reject it it means there is a lacking
[54:44] day so you have to go hide yourself in a
[54:47] corner and pray so that in comes
[54:51] if God is inside if God is important a
[54:54] heart if their word because in the
[54:57] beginning was the word the Word was with
[54:58] God and the Word was God
[55:00] so if God sees you they Wed must be you
[55:04] and if you hear the same way you'll be
[55:06] excited Oh hallelujah even baby and Oh
[55:10] hallelujah John the Baptist's in a womb
[55:13] of Elizabeth hallelujah because he was
[55:19] filled with that spirit right from the
[55:21] inside of them of the mother when Jesus
[55:24] went Mary went a Oh hallelujah and Mary
[55:27] just greeted hey the baby lived for joy
[55:31] but every child of God that the Word of
[55:34] God is uncle in his heart when he hears
[55:36] the word of God would live for joy you
[55:40] not dispute the Word of God Oh
[55:42] hallelujah he will rejoice I hearing the
[55:45] Word of God he will be happy on hearing
[55:47] the Word of God but when the pastor
[55:49] preaches in Europe you FRA amazing
[55:51] reject them believe this something is
[55:56] wrong
[55:58] hallelujah I said something is wrong she
[56:01] stopped right I want to see all of you
[56:03] when we cross over I don't want anybody
[56:06] to be left behind including myself I'm
[56:09] working out my own salvation with fear
[56:12] and trembling but all these useless
[56:17] certificates we are parent who come to
[56:19] not if at the end our souls who perish
[56:25] I'm not saying don't go to school when
[56:28] this message first came to Africa those
[56:29] were their wrong things that we're
[56:31] teaching the people women were made to
[56:33] quit their jobs amen
[56:36] I knew who I was who had a very decent
[56:39] job and she was so like I must know why
[56:41] she quit her job the husband couldn't
[56:45] take care of her she had to be carrying
[56:46] carrying stuff on her head and self to
[56:49] make a living I'm not a fanatic I
[56:53] believe the message of God but I believe
[56:56] in dividing it right amen
[57:00] so I'm not saying school is bad but I'm
[57:03] saying that if you go to school and you
[57:05] become rich you become successful in
[57:07] this well they did I died those
[57:10] certificates will not go with you nobody
[57:11] will remember the world will continue as
[57:13] if it really exists what matters is
[57:15] where your soul is going that's what
[57:19] matters because you are going to account
[57:21] to God if you are not ready to account
[57:23] to God you'll be in trouble my brother
[57:26] the swamp man who lived in recent time
[57:29] that saw him and he saw paradise amen
[57:36] all the same dimension whatever I want
[57:38] to call it and Abram said ma what he saw
[57:45] in hell a literal fire resource that I
[57:47] imprisoned he said a literal fire Benny
[57:50] you it's better than all he saw this and
[57:56] I told you the last time that all these
[57:58] pains that we put on our faces those are
[58:00] the people he saw in hell and he saw the
[58:03] same people in JC Penney in
[58:05] Jeffersonville one of them so the same
[58:11] people with all these green stuff eyes
[58:16] but the good news to us is that he also
[58:21] went into that dimension where the sins
[58:25] are he said there's no word in the
[58:29] English language that can describe that
[58:32] he said there's no way he said if you
[58:36] say it's beautiful it's an
[58:37] understatement if you say so blind is an
[58:39] understatement if you say it's pathetic
[58:41] another statement so there's no way I
[58:44] can describe it toss this toss it was
[58:48] beyond perfect it was beyond beautiful
[58:50] it was beyond sublime Oh hallelujah
[58:54] pasta hot eyes have now seen what years
[58:58] have no head
[58:59] what has no he ain't dead in two months
[59:01] thoughts that's what God has prepared
[59:03] for his children can God make mistake so
[59:09] why can't we this joy temporary joy we
[59:12] read in the Bible that Moses where you
[59:14] it refused to be called the son of
[59:17] Pharaoh's daughter chose to suffer
[59:19] affliction with the children of Israel
[59:21] Ranade enjoyed the pleasures of sin for
[59:23] a season but us seems pleasures is only
[59:26] for a season I've watched some of the so
[59:31] called beautiful women of the world
[59:33] miss Luxx Miss Universe see when you
[59:36] grow old my wrinkled bodies say who
[59:39] wants this play game

[59:49] cannot help you again
[59:51] it meant you fall under the weight of
[59:54] care very successful people Steve Jobs
[1:00:02] when he had cancer he was dying the
[1:00:07] Apple Empire couldn't help him you ready
[1:00:11] specimen is that when he was left and
[1:00:13] Loan they're dying he realized that all
[1:00:16] the years he's playing North sleeping
[1:00:19] and thinking about how to be successful
[1:00:20] successful successful it all counted to
[1:00:23] not he wish he had done things
[1:00:28] differently by then it was too late
[1:00:32] and I will know the truth we know the
[1:00:35] truth work hard
[1:00:37] I'm not saying to me work hard work hard
[1:00:38] try for success but beyond oh let the
[1:00:44] Bible let the message be your guide
[1:00:48] believe in it for in each you have life
[1:00:52] in it you have a treasure and no other
[1:00:55] passing us hallelujah then we give you
[1:00:57] another coat he said I'll be closing
[1:00:59] shortly he said look if the church I say
[1:01:07] this with respect if the church can
[1:01:10] produce tons produce no more than
[1:01:12] reading writing and arithmetic and the
[1:01:16] psychic sight of the gospel the Indians
[1:01:19] are finished now sell you this alien the
[1:01:23] Indians like the natives of Africa has
[1:01:25] got to see the power of God
[1:01:27] in demonstration hallelujah sea beans
[1:01:31] you've been sending missionaries over
[1:01:34] there for 15 years in Africa and when
[1:01:36] they're supposed to be Christians come
[1:01:39] they was packing little mud Idol under
[1:01:42] their arm why the missionary told them
[1:01:45] why about healing they go healing out of
[1:01:48] the idol not true the idol true God God
[1:01:52] wink at their endurance you see we
[1:01:55] people were ignorant so the more
[1:01:57] something to represent God as long as it
[1:01:59] is sincerely what allow you to happen he
[1:02:02] we are there in ignorance but when he
[1:02:04] come to a place where he has to be
[1:02:07] healed the missionary said oh those
[1:02:09] things
[1:02:09] their days are past we got that in the
[1:02:12] seminary see they ain't no such thing as
[1:02:16] that well he carried his and all for
[1:02:20] healing so brethren this gospel of the
[1:02:23] kingdom now we have the means to spread
[1:02:25] it ray bram said before the first
[1:02:28] Pentecost three things happened one a
[1:02:33] unified Empire but then the whole known
[1:02:37] world was under the Romans so it was
[1:02:40] easy to move about and spread the gospel
[1:02:43] then they had this developed a system of
[1:02:46] rules then they have and language I was
[1:02:51] come on to almost the whole known world
[1:02:54] at the time Greek Greece is it Greek or
[1:02:57] Greece or horrible Akali the language of
[1:02:59] the Greek people
[1:03:00] yeah so these treaties came together to
[1:03:03] create a perfect condition for the word
[1:03:06] to go around the first time now what
[1:03:09] about this end time the world almost has
[1:03:14] a universal language English right most
[1:03:19] people who speak or if you go to Europe
[1:03:21] almost everybody speaks English even
[1:03:24] though they have their own local
[1:03:25] languages in Africa I mean telling
[1:03:29] people that it's very easy for you to
[1:03:30] meet a French person who speaks English
[1:03:32] by difficult for you to come together I
[1:03:34] met a guy named who speaks French right
[1:03:38] so a lot of people speak English Chinese
[1:03:41] I lamien English Indian speak English
[1:03:43] these are the two most focused on is
[1:03:46] this at a populous countries of the
[1:03:48] world they all speak English so we have
[1:03:50] a language almost a universal language
[1:03:53] to spread the gospel even even that we
[1:03:56] are translated the Bible into all
[1:03:57] languages now even our own local African
[1:04:00] languages we have transferred translated
[1:04:01] a Bible now we have the modern means of
[1:04:04] communication there news horses back
[1:04:08] then amen we have the highway system in
[1:04:12] America in many other countries now we
[1:04:14] can reach every remote part of the world
[1:04:16] we have the aeroplanes that is
[1:04:18] travelling crisscross in the world now
[1:04:20] we have the jumbo jets we have formerly
[1:04:22] food travel from America to Europe you
[1:04:24] have to stay on the ship for like a
[1:04:25] month or two all right now you don't
[1:04:29] have to do that now we do five hours you
[1:04:32] can fly from New York and you are in
[1:04:33] London Heathrow now how I should fly
[1:04:38] from New York in a crackdown on my
[1:04:39] country so we have the means the modern
[1:04:42] means are spreading the gospel then God
[1:04:46] has added something else
[1:04:47] God has added technology amen
[1:04:54] formerly if I want to preach before the
[1:04:57] cable was made this app that we use for
[1:04:59] a message now before there was internet
[1:05:02] in the 90s before you cannot easily you
[1:05:06] could easily access internet in Ghana
[1:05:08] if you wanted to search messages to
[1:05:10] treat you have to have tons of books and
[1:05:13] that books don't have table of contents
[1:05:16] you don't have anything to be read in
[1:05:18] underline things and writing things down
[1:05:20] but now I can just go I give you a good
[1:05:24] then I read so we have the perfect
[1:05:27] condition for another time when this
[1:05:30] gospel of the kingdom must go forth in
[1:05:33] power and Brabham say to only be a short
[1:05:35] time
[1:05:40] hallelujah
[1:05:41] are we following so brethren let me wind
[1:05:44] up so the gospel of power is a kind of
[1:05:49] gospel we
[1:05:52] to be witnesses of a men as it was at
[1:05:56] Pentacles now for you as I said earlier
[1:06:00] for you to be a witness of that gospel
[1:06:02] you must first be qualified
[1:06:04] so don't venture out without authority
[1:06:07] now let me tell you what I was they were
[1:06:10] in the Bible the way people who ventured
[1:06:12] out without authority in acts 19 the
[1:06:16] Bible talks about the seven sons of
[1:06:18] Seaver they had helped Paul preached
[1:06:21] Paul cast out demons
[1:06:22] Paul pray for the sick say wow that's
[1:06:25] power
[1:06:26] we also how did he do it when he prays
[1:06:30] he mention and nib Jesus okay we also go
[1:06:32] pray mess in the name of Jesus and when
[1:06:34] we mention it seemed to happen see you
[1:06:40] were trying to steal the copyright kept
[1:06:42] those patent on Latino and they were
[1:06:45] trying to steal it so they went without
[1:06:49] a copyright authority they went anyway
[1:06:51] exercising it the demon taught them into
[1:06:55] pieces there was this lady Indiana who
[1:07:02] Pentecostal when the missionaries from
[1:07:05] America came and all these Pentecostal
[1:07:07] charismatic movements that telangana
[1:07:08] in the 70s and 80s she went out to
[1:07:13] believe in the sheer power demos so this
[1:07:18] boy who was a friend of his the boy I
[1:07:21] don't know the relationship that existed
[1:07:22] between she and a boy but the boy was
[1:07:23] having cement a problem and she thought
[1:07:25] she could pray for the boy she went
[1:07:27] there before she could say Jack the boy
[1:07:29] was on her trying to make love to her
[1:07:33] brother you have to have it before you
[1:07:37] venture out go to them that is a secret
[1:07:40] go to them don't venture out without
[1:07:42] authority if you venture out without
[1:07:44] authority you'll be defeated
[1:07:46] I see when they're trying to access to
[1:07:49] to to cast out demons and she was
[1:07:51] embarrassed but for some friends were
[1:07:54] around to rescue that you have in
[1:07:56] embarrassed reverie
[1:08:01] I first believed this message I went for
[1:08:03] a funeral an old man had died in my my
[1:08:05] hometown I went for the Fuhrer and when
[1:08:08] I went for the funeral I was asked when
[1:08:11] somebody dies in Ghana we know might
[1:08:13] have something we call wick keeping we
[1:08:15] keep wick meaning that we stay very late
[1:08:17] into the night singing and maybe having
[1:08:19] a chaser busy on other person so at a
[1:08:23] way keeping I was asked to preach so I
[1:08:27] preach I told I testified our hot I've
[1:08:30] now found out and how the things that
[1:08:32] our fathers worship were evil so they
[1:08:35] should throw those things away I come
[1:08:37] and follow the true God
[1:08:38] I just testified of what has what I
[1:08:41] found that has changed me
[1:08:43] why I don't live like them anymore so
[1:08:47] the following morning
[1:08:49] one of my cousin's an older cousin he
[1:08:52] sent for me he was a cousin but a divvy
[1:08:56] I don't have any link with him I don't
[1:08:59] communicate so I was suspicious so I
[1:09:02] asked the lady who came and told me and
[1:09:04] this is a true story as the lady who
[1:09:06] came and coffee are you sure that who is
[1:09:08] calling me you say yes so I went when I
[1:09:14] went to me he lives in a small madhouse
[1:09:17] I'm at hat he told me that
[1:09:19] oh I mean as his brother and I'm you
[1:09:23] know cousins but we call ourselves
[1:09:25] brothers so as his brother living in a
[1:09:27] big city just one day to have my phone
[1:09:29] number
[1:09:29] those were the days this was in 2003
[1:09:31] those were the days when mobile phones
[1:09:33] had just come everybody was using mobile
[1:09:36] phones in Ghana so I was having about
[1:09:39] three different mobile phones in my hand
[1:09:41] belonging to other people who came for
[1:09:42] the funeral so he saying he does needed
[1:09:44] my number but I was suspicious something
[1:09:47] something to be and upright so I told
[1:09:51] him I did he have a pain I didn't have
[1:09:53] the means of giving him the number so he
[1:09:55] entered his room and brought out a pen
[1:09:57] and a book and gave to me to write the
[1:10:00] number on so I gave him my number
[1:10:02] after I give him the number I couldn't
[1:10:06] write it behind I just had severe pain
[1:10:11] in my hand I couldn't write I know you
[1:10:17] don't understand what I'm saying now
[1:10:19] when you venture out one day you lot
[1:10:21] when you when you went out one time
[1:10:23] where Abraham was in Germany to preach
[1:10:26] we brother agam right and they were and
[1:10:30] I can't wait he's before he could start
[1:10:33] speaking 15 which doctors came that he
[1:10:36] wanted to talk to him that this
[1:10:38] territory was deer territory and he had
[1:10:40] come to their territory without their
[1:10:42] permission
[1:10:44] so he wanted to talk to him bragging
[1:10:48] rights and the other brothers supah
[1:10:51] abraham said no do not allow them to
[1:10:53] talk to around then they also vow that
[1:10:55] the meeting would not be held so they
[1:10:59] divided themselves into the four corners
[1:11:01] of the canvas tent where we having a
[1:11:05] meeting you know the story I think it's
[1:11:06] him he dies greater he that is in you or
[1:11:11] something like that I forgot in the
[1:11:12] title of the message they started they
[1:11:16] are enchantment they were chanting
[1:11:17] father son Holy Ghost Bravo's making a
[1:11:20] son if you listen to the tape father son
[1:11:21] Holy Ghost who father son Holy Ghost who
[1:11:25] death suddenly there was a storm
[1:11:29] there was thundering storm the tent was
[1:11:33] being judged I pray Lord you sent me to
[1:11:44] step he prayed the whole atmosphere just
[1:12:02] clicked
[1:12:03] and when he cleared people rushed over
[1:12:07] to give their lives to God what did the
[1:12:10] odd minute they saw the power in the
[1:12:13] demonstration of the gospel so I
[1:12:17] couldn't write my hand was so I told my
[1:12:21] singing brother who is also a reverend
[1:12:22] minister with one of the pentacle such
[1:12:24] edges
[1:12:25] and we started praying about it we
[1:12:28] prayed for about three weeks then the
[1:12:30] pain ceased so this happened in October
[1:12:34] so I travel back to our craft my
[1:12:37] siblings were that's teasing me so I'm
[1:12:40] so fearful by they don't think that it
[1:12:42] was anything so in December I went back
[1:12:46] to the village because my mother lives
[1:12:48] there so it makes me I've really
[1:12:49] frequent the place so I went back there
[1:12:52] to see my mom for the end of year so
[1:12:55] when I went back the following morning
[1:12:56] the first person I met was dumb and so
[1:13:02] when I met him we are relatives yeah we
[1:13:05] come from the same grandfather it's a
[1:13:07] great grandfather so I walk towards him
[1:13:09] and I wanted to greet him say oh my
[1:13:13] brother how are you my straight fold my
[1:13:15] hand and when I stretch my hand he gave
[1:13:18] me his elbow so he gave me his elbow
[1:13:22] then I said hey so I realized that his
[1:13:25] whole hand had been bandaged in help his
[1:13:30] hand
[1:13:30] this father had he had used a lot of
[1:13:33] hepzibah need a hand I said what is
[1:13:38] wrong with your hand
[1:13:39] they said there is something I don't
[1:13:43] know how to say it in English but I say
[1:13:44] it's Kaka Kaka is like some just a saw
[1:13:49] Hanna saw that that spreads like it's a
[1:13:51] form of cancer by it's not malignant so
[1:13:56] nothing has spread over the same place
[1:13:59] that was having the pain so worried our
[1:14:04] peppers for me and since then dama
[1:14:06] doesn't talk to me and he never he took
[1:14:08] my number he never called me nothing
[1:14:10] so God confirmed my suspicions that hey
[1:14:16] who is this small boy to come and preach
[1:14:17] to us in because he's the man I don't
[1:14:20] man and he's the main I dog killer in
[1:14:22] the town so he wanted to prove that as
[1:14:29] this man got a goose so
[1:14:35] if you venture out there they are going
[1:14:37] to preach this gospel without authority
[1:14:41] I'm going to face the enemy's defense
[1:14:46] attorneys they who cross exam you where
[1:14:50] are you i cannibal witness or not but I
[1:14:53] see my battle with comedy and there I
[1:14:56] wasn't gonna last you all know that I
[1:14:58] came back in me in January my mother was
[1:15:01] baptized and she died in February we
[1:15:06] witnessed all that so when I went home I
[1:15:11] saw them I was driving in my car and I
[1:15:14] saw them walking by the roadside with
[1:15:16] all that religion so I stopped the car
[1:15:18] and when I saw the car they came I was
[1:15:21] Crittenden when I was greeting them I
[1:15:23] saw that he put his hand on my kind was
[1:15:26] chanting yeah tell you he has not given
[1:15:32] out the fight I've done nothing to him
[1:15:36] nothing just the mere fact that I
[1:15:38] proclaim and I testified to be a
[1:15:41] Christian and I had simplified one I
[1:15:45] don't join them in the our drunken
[1:15:48] parties and there are sex parties he
[1:15:51] wants to I mean he won't also find a way
[1:15:54] of spiritually destroying me or
[1:15:56] something I don't know he did that I
[1:16:00] drove to our cry when I was going to I
[1:16:02] cried the car give me a lot of problem
[1:16:03] on a week when I go to a crowd then I
[1:16:05] was continuing to where I was which was
[1:16:06] 600 kilometres from a craft had a nasty
[1:16:10] accident on the way I did in front of me
[1:16:18] the car does v8 into my apartment I just
[1:16:20] run we not not even a cat so baby I'm
[1:16:34] saying this and I've given an example in
[1:16:37] the Bible about the seven sons of silver
[1:16:39] that if you go out there as a true
[1:16:42] witness of God they see that demons can
[1:16:46] make a difference
[1:16:48] Seppo we know Jesus we know but you who
[1:16:51] are you
[1:16:52] so if we don't have what you are talking
[1:16:54] about that they must know whether you
[1:16:56] have it or you don't have it
[1:16:59] bring that it was a servant of God you
[1:17:01] must never let down the ammo like this
[1:17:04] guy that I'm having this encounter with
[1:17:06] in my country he's did it once it didn't
[1:17:09] work he didn't give up after how many 20
[1:17:12] 2003 to do 15 years later he tried it
[1:17:14] again he nearly had me because I took it
[1:17:19] for granted I just thought that I didn't
[1:17:21] even really like the first time when it
[1:17:23] happened and I prayed I really prayed
[1:17:25] about it this time I did I guess I do
[1:17:29] it's not gonna happen though protected
[1:17:31] me but I spoiled it I destroyed the car
[1:17:34] in him so brethren when Jesus was living
[1:17:48] he told them to go into the world to
[1:17:52] become his witnesses and it applies to
[1:17:55] us today we must go into the world and
[1:17:57] become his witnesses witnesses not of
[1:18:00] tracks not a psychic not of theology the
[1:18:04] witnesses of the power gospel
[1:18:06] don't go unprepared amen
[1:18:11] because the maniac of Ghaderi is dead
[1:18:15] waiting for you
[1:18:18] the bull is there waiting for you know
[1:18:21] where Abraham was crossing that field to
[1:18:23] Grand Prix for a sick person and I
[1:18:25] Buddha has killed some people before the
[1:18:29] bull is worth waiting for you the maniac
[1:18:33] of Portland Oregon is waiting for you
[1:18:36] remember the story when I maniac wanted
[1:18:38] to destroy a brand they say you are fake
[1:18:40] and I want to prove to these people that
[1:18:41] you are fake hallelujah
[1:18:45] Carranza he wasn't afraid of him
[1:18:50] everybody thought that Robin was good we
[1:18:52] know he's a small man everybody was
[1:18:54] gonna be destroy but your physical size
[1:18:57] doesn't matter it is what is in that
[1:18:58] body it is what is in our body
[1:19:02] amen the witch doctors of Africa and of
[1:19:07] Germany of India the Muhammadans are
[1:19:10] witching you better have it they meant
[1:19:15] and if you are true witness God is going
[1:19:22] to stand by you so make sure that you
[1:19:28] come out prepared David came out
[1:19:32] prepared he had an experience his
[1:19:37] testimony was in a lion and a bear he
[1:19:41] said this was second sight Philistine
[1:19:43] this Philistine with other Holy Ghost
[1:19:46] coming to challenge the army of God that
[1:19:49] is supposed to have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] unfortunately being led by a backslidden
[1:19:52] King what we have to prove that there is
[1:19:58] still a God in Israel so if you are a
[1:20:03] true witness I'm saying God is going to
[1:20:05] back you if you know what you are
[1:20:09] talking about God is going to back you
[1:20:12] amen
[1:20:14] Alleluia even God backed Moses did he
[1:20:23] back him because Moses had met him Moses
[1:20:26] was sure his talk was talking about
[1:20:28] Moses was sure he saw a bush that was on
[1:20:31] fire by the bush was not being consumed
[1:20:33] he was sure that a voice spoke to him
[1:20:35] from the bush sure of it
[1:20:40] so when he went out there and painted
[1:20:42] Pharaoh's Palace God was duty-bound to
[1:20:46] back him very poor knew what he was
[1:20:51] talking about so when he went out there
[1:20:55] to the cities of Asia and throughout all
[1:20:58] of the known world at that time Greece
[1:21:02] and so many places when you went to
[1:21:04] those places I was preaching I was
[1:21:06] casting out Devils he knew what was
[1:21:08] Tandy know and God but him no one knew
[1:21:12] that God had instructed him to build a
[1:21:14] back
[1:21:15] and God back him amen I said God back
[1:21:21] him
[1:21:22] so did we didn't venture without
[1:21:24] authority you would have been killed
[1:21:26] it's not as a foolish feet
[1:21:28] you know people people just people have
[1:21:33] what we call some people exercise
[1:21:37] distance before and they just die hope
[1:21:43] and no fate a cousin of mine was
[1:21:48] diagnosed with hiv/aids in Ghana I
[1:21:52] didn't know at the time that that's what
[1:21:53] she was diagnosed with and she was sent
[1:21:55] to a prayer camp and in the prayer camp
[1:21:59] she was asked to do too fast for 21 days
[1:22:02] the sick person who have you ever seen a
[1:22:06] sick person don't go to grab remember
[1:22:08] Abraham see were fast for 21 days for
[1:22:10] your sickness to be healed if the person
[1:22:13] could help himself we have come to you
[1:22:15] so she so she was asked to fast for 21
[1:22:18] days
[1:22:18] so at the end of any one days I met her
[1:22:22] father and hey do a driving and I was
[1:22:25] somewhere we just bump into each other
[1:22:27] somewhere in a crack and say who is in a
[1:22:32] car who is lying on the seat they say oh
[1:22:34] that's very own cousin you know
[1:22:41] oh yeah but she's changed he said no she
[1:22:44] just went for a 21 big fast
[1:22:46] I said I said to do a 21-day fast my
[1:22:52] brother she died HIV some immune disease
[1:22:56] your immune system is weak so if your
[1:22:59] immune system is weak why do you go for
[1:23:00] another 21 days you to kill you
[1:23:05] so you see people who are you see
[1:23:09] doctors why in hospital who don't know
[1:23:11] how to mean diagnosable I mean they are
[1:23:13] giving wrong prescription unfortunately
[1:23:18] in our part of the world nobody takes
[1:23:21] this sin seriously and these deaths are
[1:23:23] not even investigated probably here that
[1:23:25] the operation who prescribed to anyone
[1:23:27] they first would have any
[1:23:29] right now he's supposed to be in jail
[1:23:32] hallelujah
[1:23:33] so Bradley a witness can give a report a
[1:23:39] speech if you go to a court any UI
[1:23:41] witness you can't go there and be saying
[1:23:44] that Abraham said Abraham said LeBron
[1:23:48] said is good but it must be backed by
[1:23:52] our own experience hallelujah
[1:23:56] Bram said is good right might be backed
[1:23:58] by our own experience if it's not bad by
[1:24:00] your own SPR given a reported speech
[1:24:03] that's actually part of the gospel
[1:24:06] maybe I'm saying is that we must move
[1:24:09] from the trilogy path to where God want
[1:24:11] us to be because the angel of God to the
[1:24:14] Prophet that this endtime Church is
[1:24:16] going to be a super Church saying hail
[1:24:19] will be the fullness of pentacles it
[1:24:20] says you go back to the bride she was at
[1:24:23] the beginning
[1:24:25] ready we must go back to the bride we're
[1:24:27] at the beginning where no Ananias and
[1:24:30] Sapphira could stand in the church
[1:24:32] just coming to declare their tights and
[1:24:35] they under declare tight yes because
[1:24:38] they lie to the Holy Ghost I do you know
[1:24:41] but her arm said that the days of
[1:24:42] Ananias and Sapphira will return before
[1:24:44] the rapture to the true church so if we
[1:24:49] are not saying that in a true church a
[1:24:51] true church is full of lies and lasts
[1:24:54] and all these of clean living and all
[1:24:57] these there's something wrong I mean we
[1:25:04] are getting close to there and it has to
[1:25:06] happen the cohort we've got now economic
[1:25:10] the rapture
[1:25:11] we've got something that I saw Steve in
[1:25:13] us that is healing the sick that is
[1:25:16] doing all the background saving because
[1:25:17] he had I said even with all the power he
[1:25:20] demonstrated say what we have not and
[1:25:22] not because the cohort is to come for
[1:25:26] the rapture should be higher than what
[1:25:28] Kim our Pentacles
[1:25:31] we are barometer what you have seen and
[1:25:33] prolly in me will be made manifest in
[1:25:36] the fullness of power
[1:25:41] said after a short quick demonstration
[1:25:44] on the Gospel the bride will be taken
[1:25:46] away hallelujah
[1:25:49] red rain this should be our cry I don't
[1:25:54] know what I'll speak to you again if I
[1:25:56] go back to Ghana but I'll be coming to
[1:25:57] church amen but this don't let this mess
[1:26:02] never forget this message that we must
[1:26:04] go back to the tentacles of the begin
[1:26:06] you must go back to the bright way at
[1:26:08] the beginning because we are Brahmins
[1:26:11] and the data will recognize who we are
[1:26:13] will be raptured but it's a lack of
[1:26:15] recognition that is what is creating the
[1:26:17] problem because we are betting with a
[1:26:20] kiss on this world and then we recognize
[1:26:23] that we are peculiar nation we had
[1:26:24] peculiar people a royal priesthood and
[1:26:28] then we are not just anything common in
[1:26:31] this world we are the bride we are going
[1:26:34] to live within the gate now outside the
[1:26:36] gate I mean the same Jews will be
[1:26:39] outside the gate the 144 thousand right
[1:26:45] of Christ
