[8:22] have lunch and Lord gave me a word of
[8:25] knowledge regarding one of them didn't
[8:29] know if it was them or a loved one or
[8:31] their family or a friend and and even
[8:34] called it out by name it was a cancer of
[8:37] prostrate cancer and the one brother
[8:41] from across the table said wha
[8:44] I don't know how you would have known
[8:45] that other than God showed you he said
[8:48] that's my friend Larry's got prostrate
[8:50] cancer and so we just had a lovely time

[8:55] Larry and it was just how God touching

[26:28] God from st. John glad to see everybody
[26:30] here tonight my wife couldn't make it
[26:33] she's babysitting now the shoving off
[26:36] kids brother Adam and his little fella
[26:40] Nehemiah is at home with the flu and so
[26:43] my wife has the other three kids at the
[26:45] house pray that God give them speedy
[26:49] recovery
[26:52] polio fellas I tell you but God designed
[26:57] everything and he makes no mistakes we
[27:01] love the Lord and we appreciate God
[27:04] amazing grace I was just talking with
[27:08] our precious brother you know tonight
[27:13] and when we think about how good God is
[27:19] to us
[27:19] I still when I get to heaven you know we
[27:26] say we know you know we were in him from
[27:29] the foundation of the world and there's
[27:34] still questions you know you come to the
[27:39] factory and you think you know Lord why
[27:42] me how did I get there how did I become
[27:46] this and you know it amazes me because
[27:52] the more I see my faults and my failures
[27:55] the more I see his glory and the more I
[27:59] want to be more like it
[28:02] so let's turn to st. John 17 1 through 5
[28:05] and then we're to read st. John 12 to 13
[28:10] and then we'll skip down to st. John 17
[28:13] 20 24 I believe that we often have a
[28:21] tendency of looking in the future even
[28:25] as the prophet of God says looking in
[28:26] the past but we fail to see what God is
[28:30] doing present day and even though it
[28:33] looked like God is not doing anything
[28:35] perhaps to some eye I see the glory of
[28:38] God
[28:39] every day I see the mercies of God every
[28:42] day I see his long-suffering I see his
[28:44] grace not looking out on my window but
[28:49] looking in I see what God and how
[28:53] incredible he is Saint John 17 one
[28:58] through five these words spake Jesus and
[29:02] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[29:04] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[29:09] that thy son also may glorify thee as
[29:15] thou has given him power over all flesh
[29:18] that he should give eternal life to as
[29:22] many as thou has given him and this is
[29:26] life eternal that they might know the
[29:29] only we got of the only true God and
[29:32] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have
[29:37] glorified thee on earth I have finished
[29:39] the work which thou gave me to do and
[29:42] now father glorify thou me with thine
[29:45] own self with the glory which I had with
[29:49] thee before the foundation but before
[29:53] the world was I want you to take note
[29:56] Jesus Christ is saying by how that he
[30:03] has done his work you know Paul talks
[30:06] about it he says you know I have
[30:08] finished my course I've kept the faith
[30:10] and Paul was still living had not died
[30:13] yet but it we have a tendency of we
[30:19] should have as I put this way this
[30:20] should be an instruction even though we
[30:23] don't see the finishing line we must
[30:25] confess we have finished you know Jesus
[30:30] said I have kept it I finished I've
[30:32] glorified the work is done and yet
[30:37] Calvary was still before
[30:43] John 17 12 13 while I was with them in
[30:50] the world I kept them in their name
[30:52] those that thou gave it to me I have
[30:55] kept and none of them is lost but the
[30:58] Sun perdition that the Scriptures might
[31:00] be fulfilled and now come I to D and
[31:03] these things I spake in the world that
[31:06] they might have my joy fulfilled in
[31:11] themselves so you and I must know that
[31:15] that one of Christ's purposes one of his
[31:19] finished works it was to fulfill his joy
[31:25] or let his jaw be fulfilled in us in
[31:29] other words being full of his joy all
[31:33] right st. John 17 22 24 neither pray I
[31:38] for these alone but for them also which
[31:41] shall believe on me through their word
[31:43] that they all may be one as as thou
[31:48] father art in me and I in thee that they
[31:52] also may be one in us that the world may
[31:55] believe that thou has sent me and the
[31:59] glory which thou gave with me I have
[32:01] given them that they may be one even as
[32:04] we are one I in them Darwyn me that they
[32:09] may be made perfect in one and that the
[32:11] world may know that thou has sent me and
[32:14] has loved them as they love me father I
[32:18] will that also whom thou has given me be
[32:22] with me where I am that they may behold
[32:25] my glory which thou has given me but
[32:29] thou loveth me before the foundation of
[32:32] the world
[32:34] let us pray father we thank you for your
[32:39] amazing grace we thank you for being so
[32:42] good to us and Lord you have been better
[32:46] to us than we have been to ourselves
[32:48] I pray tonight that you would bless the
[32:50] service anoint your servant Lord forgive
[32:53] us of all our sins I
[32:55] trespassers are thoughts desires
[32:57] everything Lord and anything that have
[33:00] not been pleasing in that sight forgive
[33:02] us and cleanse us from all
[33:03] unrighteousness father we give you all
[33:07] the glory we give you all the praise in
[33:10] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[33:12] you may be seated the subject tonight is
[33:18] long and pretty much the glory of the
[33:22] Lord is now being revealed you know when
[33:30] we talk about glory we more than likely
[33:35] think of something that is bliss
[33:40] something that is of a splendor
[33:43] something that is from heaven we think
[33:48] about the pillar far above brother
[33:52] branham's head that ring that circle
[33:55] that surrounding radiant light that
[34:01] represents the head the whole figure of
[34:03] a Jesus Christ person and it amazes me
[34:09] because even in the old pictures of
[34:12] those who were considered saints of God
[34:16] they they always put that glow that
[34:18] light about the head then it showed that
[34:26] that person was an extraordinary person
[34:29] yet maybe a common person but
[34:33] extraordinary in the sense that he was
[34:36] able or she was able to reflect God and
[34:39] even the world or their neighborhood so
[34:42] those who did not know them looked upon
[34:45] them as being Christians or Saints now
[34:49] they weren't here to glorify themselves
[34:51] but the glory that was reading being
[34:54] revealed was the glory that God had
[34:56] given them and you and I have come to do
[34:59] one thing and that is to glorify God in
[35:01] this evil age you and I must realize by
[35:06] God's grace that
[35:09] the glory that we have in the glory that
[35:11] we will receive is that glory that was
[35:15] given to us before the foundation of the
[35:17] world it is not a man's achievement it's
[35:21] a god appointment it is something that
[35:24] God himself has established in his own
[35:27] thoughts in his own mind before the
[35:30] world existed it is something that we I
[35:34] like to use this word will evolve into
[35:38] you know we we see ourselves as men but
[35:43] you and I must understand that we're not
[35:45] two continuous men our thoughts are not
[35:48] supposed to be thoughts of man but our
[35:51] thoughts are supposed to be thoughts of
[35:52] God and even the Bible tells us that we
[35:56] should let the mind that was in Christ
[35:58] Jesus being us you have heard me say
[36:01] before Jesus Christ was the perfect man
[36:04] he was the perfect Adam he was the
[36:07] perfect one he was the perfect God even
[36:09] though he was a man I love Jesus because
[36:13] jesus wept
[36:14] Jesus alone Jesus groan Jesus got sick
[36:19] and he never failed to call upon his
[36:23] father he realized his frailties he
[36:29] understood that everything that he had
[36:32] was not his own as a man he realized
[36:37] amen that everything that was given was
[36:41] given all that the father has given you
[36:45] were given by God to who we call Jesus
[36:50] Christ now don't think I'm confused
[36:53] because I don't believe in two gods I
[36:56] don't believe in three I know there's
[36:58] only one God but I understand the
[37:02] dispensations of God I understand amen
[37:05] the manifestations of God and if the
[37:08] disciples and if the prophets and you
[37:11] know the Apostles can can talk about the
[37:14] father of Jesus Christ
[37:17] so can I and you and I must understand
[37:20] by God's grace that this thing was laid
[37:23] up this way so that we can understand
[37:25] what we're coming to now if Adam and Eve
[37:29] had not faulted they had not fallen we
[37:32] would have come right into that sonship
[37:34] we would have not needed to be adopted
[37:37] we would have been born already into
[37:40] what that position in which God had in
[37:43] his mind for us to be but because of the
[37:47] fall we understand by God's grace amen
[37:49] that we are now - how could I say God
[37:53] uses us to walk in walks of faith
[37:57] because you understand faith must be
[38:00] established not your faith his faith
[38:04] because we realized that because of the
[38:06] lack of faith in what God has said to
[38:09] Adam and Eve it is the reason why we're
[38:12] in this position so that faith in God
[38:15] God's faith must first be established
[38:19] before anything else it is the
[38:21] foundation of the gospel he that cometh
[38:24] to God must believe that he is God and
[38:27] that he is a rewarder of them that
[38:29] diligently seek Him what glorious you
[38:32] speaking of there's only one really one
[38:35] glory and that glory is the glory of God
[38:39] now we realize by God's grace in this
[38:42] world we have many gods whether they be
[38:45] basketball gods football gods gambling
[38:49] gods whatever they got of many gods
[38:52] everywhere but the glory in which they
[38:55] obtained in this world is not
[38:57] everlasting and you asked who was the
[39:01] Pharaoh and so and so on so time and
[39:04] then you know nobody remembers who he
[39:06] was and yet is still in his day he was
[39:09] glorified as a God is that right
[39:13] but it is so amazing that who those whom
[39:16] God established as gods never fade
[39:20] they're always talked about now you may
[39:24] not look at it like that but God says
[39:26] even is it not written in your
[39:28] scriptures that God says ye are gods he
[39:33] told Moses he said Moses you're going to
[39:36] be God
[39:36] unto Pharaoh in other words at the end
[39:40] of the day they will bow to you
[39:44] now we realized the whole thing that God
[39:47] was doing and all he was doing is like
[39:50] what animals do if I could say like this
[39:53] in the natural animals teach their young
[39:59] they teach them how to hunt lions teach
[40:02] lions how to hunt how to approach porcha
[40:08] how are you pronounce it but we realized
[40:11] by God's grace they're taught that's why
[40:14] God says train your children teach them
[40:19] bring them up in the way what way the
[40:23] god-given way to understand that we will
[40:27] yes sinners saved by grace but this is
[40:30] not our stopping place
[40:32] we're not things that just happened we
[40:37] don't we don't we don't evolve by
[40:39] Darwin's Darwin's theory but you and I
[40:43] must understand that we are purposely
[40:46] brought here and we are to purposely
[40:50] fulfill God's will now you say well what
[40:58] I mean but it takes a surrendering did
[41:02] you know that Jesus Christ being the son
[41:04] of God
[41:04] had to surrender his everyday life was
[41:10] surrendering to the will of the Father
[41:13] can you imagine this person full of God
[41:17] and seeing all the afflicted ones yet he
[41:22] had to pass by some and stop by others
[41:25] think about all that he knew a man at
[41:29] the Pool of Bethesda how that he there
[41:31] were many afflicted there but Jesus
[41:35] Christ bypassed him all a had healed a
[41:41] man with an infirmity he wasn't that it
[41:45] he couldn't walk but he was sick he
[41:49] could have had
[41:50] kinds of things going on with him but he
[41:53] wasn't the worst case scenario and God
[41:57] passed by all of the others I heard
[42:00] brother Brennan said they would even
[42:01] come to the Pool of Bethesda with knives
[42:04] to fight each other off to see who could
[42:07] get into the pool first yeah and I
[42:14] thought wow that would be the that's
[42:17] exactly but yeah I want God to bless me
[42:20] but I'm gonna kill you so he can bless
[42:22] me but you see people were desperate in
[42:27] that day they needed healing gave me to
[42:31] deliverance and then when the real
[42:33] delivery came by they were they watch
[42:35] him pass by I don't know what they were
[42:39] thinking but I think to myself if I had
[42:42] seen him there and he says to this man
[42:45] take up your bed and walk and that man
[42:47] got up and walked he would have had to
[42:49] deal with me too because how to follow
[42:51] them where every whit go
[42:52] but somehow the scripture doesn't even
[42:55] say that no one else got excited pretty
[42:58] much you look at these things and you
[43:00] and I must understand by God's grace
[43:02] that when God every time God became a
[43:11] mystery to the world he always sent a
[43:16] voice every time when when when the
[43:22] miracles the signs and the wonders of
[43:24] God would disappear and Men intelligence
[43:28] would increase and and their knowledge
[43:30] would come to a place where they felt
[43:32] like they needed didn't need God God
[43:34] would always raise up a standard the
[43:39] Bible tells us he never left himself
[43:42] without a witness understand now when
[43:46] God reveals his glory everybody won't
[43:52] see it they don't see it it is only
[43:57] those who are due to see it y'all heard
[44:01] me
[44:02] everybody won't see the reality of this
[44:06] message they may read it they may study
[44:11] it they may walk too but it's not given
[44:17] to those who want to it's not him that
[44:20] willeth it's not him that runneth but
[44:24] it's God who shows mercy and you and I
[44:28] should be screaming sometime to the top
[44:31] of our voice because of God who has
[44:34] opened our eyes to see and has caused a
[44:38] life to come in us listen even your
[44:41] desire to serve God is from God you
[44:46] didn't make up your mind
[44:48] God made up your mind for you I think
[44:57] about the man who was blind and the
[45:01] question was asked who did sin and Jesus
[45:05] says they said did his parents his
[45:08] father and mother he says neither but
[45:10] all this was done for the glory of God
[45:13] hallelujah
[45:15] y'all gotta understand you didn't ask to
[45:17] be in later seer you did not ask God
[45:21] amen to be here but it was given to you
[45:25] to be here for the glory of God you and
[45:32] I need to understand we need not to
[45:34] complain we need not to be discouraged
[45:38] we need not it meant to think why am I
[45:41] here because God brought you here that
[45:45] his glory might be seen through you in
[45:48] this wicked age don't tell me it's easy
[45:53] I don't know what the Eve's before me
[45:55] had to deal with but I'm gonna tell you
[45:57] something it is a battleground every day
[46:03] that'll keep me he keeps me I don't know
[46:07] how to keep myself hello
[46:13] I must understand I'm being kept for his
[46:15] own purpose he understand me you said
[46:20] what do you mean brother was did you and
[46:22] you remember the time in the scripture
[46:24] when Peter took the sword and he tried
[46:26] to cut the head of the man off and got
[46:28] his ear God I could have left it that
[46:31] way Peter would have been thrown in jail
[46:33] more than likely crucified and would
[46:37] have missed Pentecost but God had a
[46:40] purpose for him the devil knew he meant
[46:43] that Peter had already been given the
[46:45] keys to the New Testament church and God
[46:50] for random God God saw what the devil
[46:52] was doing put that man's ear and got rid
[46:55] of all the evidence hallelujah and
[46:59] that's how it is with God when it comes
[47:02] to you the Bible says no weapon formed
[47:05] against me or you shall prosper no I
[47:09] don't care if it's all one it will never
[47:13] prosper
[47:14] it'll never get victory over you even at
[47:17] the time when it seems like it has
[47:19] victory over you God says not so this is
[47:24] truth you and I we are the glory of God
[47:28] being revealed every test and trial you
[47:31] go through God is expecting you to come
[47:34] out as a winner ah so that his glory
[47:37] would be seen you've got to understand
[47:40] you and I will will will I come with
[47:43] regards God's army on the chessboard
[47:47] Satan against God I'm God already five
[47:51] or seven steps ahead at five or seven
[47:55] you know me in there and you know God
[47:58] knows who the winner is and sometimes
[48:00] you know the devil might put a little
[48:02] play on and it looked like he got God in
[48:05] a checkmate and God put a move on him
[48:10] huh gotta put a move on him amen and
[48:13] bring him to shame because his he was
[48:16] being overconfident
[48:18] sometimes saying I really think he's the
[48:20] winner
[48:21] he's a prideful o devil and he thinks
[48:26] men with all of the things that he
[48:28] places on us he's gonna win he cannot
[48:32] win it's not in the script you and I are
[48:36] not representing ourselves we're here
[48:39] representing God we are ambassadors of
[48:42] Jesus and all of heaven is above above
[48:45] us is with us and for us God will make
[48:51] your life come out right there is no
[48:56] trap Satan God cannot break so look
[49:01] through the scripture every trap Satan
[49:04] set for the believer God came around and
[49:08] broke it they could have been ensnared
[49:11] and traps for years but at that
[49:14] appointed time God comes around and
[49:18] shows his glory oh you talking about
[49:21] what are you talking about
[49:23] you see even Rahab didn't even know she
[49:25] was a believer until that time came she
[49:28] realized she was a believer and though
[49:32] she was a believer she couldn't deliver
[49:33] herself
[49:34] hey it's about it and because you are
[49:37] believer doesn't mean you can deliver
[49:39] you have no ability to deliver yourself
[49:42] it is Christ Jesus alone who is Dodd
[49:46] deliver rock is that right Bo's is
[49:50] whether the deliverer it was God in
[49:52] Moses who was the deliverer you're not a
[49:56] deliverer is God in you who is the
[49:59] deliverer hallelujah but God puts us in
[50:03] easy so he's a he's a the captain he's
[50:06] the captain of the laws holes you know
[50:08] god is great in battle and he uses us to
[50:15] bring in it to a visitor visibility of
[50:19] what he's doing in the unseen world you
[50:26] and I must understand by God's grace
[50:28] that God knows exactly what he's doing
[50:33] you understand me listen I don't care
[50:37] what situation you in right now
[50:40] think about it God allowed it to be so
[50:45] hello why he knows you better than you
[50:49] know yourself he knows that there is no
[50:53] quitting in you
[50:54] he knows that at the end of the day
[50:57] something will go to snap you to your
[50:59] senses is that right it looked like God
[51:05] chose a bad person when he chose Samson
[51:09] cause Samson and that's right when he
[51:11] was first born and all Samson did look
[51:14] like was a mess up job messed up all the
[51:17] time hmm did a few exploits right but at
[51:23] the same time at the end of the day what
[51:26] happens when the devil thought he had
[51:29] Samson all tired of God came and
[51:32] unloosed and not broke the chain yeah
[51:35] I'm saying in other words there is no
[51:38] way you and I if you have been chosen to
[51:41] be bride there is no way you can miss it
[51:47] God will work nature to bring you to
[51:52] that place he'll make the winds move the
[51:56] trees he got quake he'll do whatever is
[51:59] necessary to put you in a place where
[52:03] his glory is revealed now sometimes we
[52:09] think glory is the praise and worship of
[52:12] God of a man excuse me when we think
[52:16] about glory we think about all these
[52:18] things but you must understand Paul
[52:23] didn't live didn't die in a bad way
[52:28] Paul went to Nero's chopping block huh
[52:33] and he was glorifying God yeah when you
[52:40] think about it he went you see a lot of
[52:42] time we think it's gonna be all this
[52:44] Fame and this beauty no no no no no take
[52:48] up your cross and follow me
[52:51] we are glorifying God by way and through
[52:54] the cross Yuri was suffer hallelujah
[52:58] but in that suffering we love him we
[53:00] believe him we trust him hallelujah
[53:03] because and then we have a relationship
[53:06] with him
[53:06] that's unexplainable he looked at old
[53:13] death in his day in his eyes as a old
[53:15] death whereas you're staying
[53:16] o grave where is your victory thanks be
[53:19] to God who gives me the victory to our
[53:21] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it looked
[53:25] like a horrible death they take all that
[53:28] Paul had done Paul says everybody has
[53:30] forsaken me even my buddy Dimas is gone
[53:34] I don't have nobody with me I preach
[53:37] this gospel all these years and where
[53:39] are the comforts and then I see amen
[53:43] through these prophetic eyes that after
[53:46] I leave grievious was going to come in
[53:48] and the whole thing that I've worked for
[53:51] and men would come to annul it seems but
[53:56] Paul says God shows him at the end of
[53:59] the day this coming another group coming
[54:02] up hallelujah this seed must go into the
[54:06] ground it must die
[54:08] it must rot it must go through a dark
[54:10] period hallelujah but in the evening
[54:15] time there shall be light so how can we
[54:19] expect to be any otherwise different you
[54:23] and I must understand when you chose to
[54:26] be a Christian you have chose you chose
[54:29] the hard way this way is not an easy way
[54:33] if it's easy you backslash lid this is a
[54:38] rough way hallelujah ridicule rejected
[54:46] you're going to be rejected if the world
[54:50] loves you something's wrong if all means
[54:54] be good of you something's wrong we're
[54:58] not here it meant to please men or to
[55:00] make them happy we're here to glorify
[55:02] God and what
[55:05] that takes if you got to walk alone you
[55:08] have to walk alone one of the things
[55:14] that we are overlooking in this message
[55:17] and I'm not going to be long tonight but
[55:20] first John 3:11 says for this is the
[55:24] message that you heard from the
[55:26] beginning that we should love one
[55:29] another and I think sometimes we think
[55:32] loving one another's being buddies and
[55:34] friends I think sometimes we take that
[55:37] love that he's talking about as some
[55:40] kind of a filial love he's not talking
[55:44] about that he's talking about that
[55:46] divine love that that was from the
[55:48] beginning huh
[55:51] and that's why I said don't go in love
[55:53] love like Cain and ain't King versus
[55:56] Abel that wasn't love that was jealousy
[56:01] and Cain killed his brother and so he
[56:09] says no if you love one another like you
[56:12] don't go around killing one another
[56:15] hello we can't kill with the gun but we
[56:19] can kill with the tongue and you and I
[56:22] must understand by God's grace this is
[56:24] the message hey hey hey somebody help me
[56:28] here here see because faith is just a
[56:30] foundation that'll take you up to love
[56:35] and none of those virtues can be sealed
[56:39] without it you can't have long-suffering
[56:43] or patient with anybody someone that you
[56:46] don't love you gotta love in order to
[56:50] see be sealed with patience even the
[56:54] unlovable
[56:56] y'all sir ma'am you know I'm enjoying
[56:59] myself I'm not just running around right
[57:01] now but I'm really enjoying myself
[57:04] because you and I we was realized Amen
[57:07] we're taking steps of faith like I was
[57:13] telling a young brother today you have
[57:15] to call those things that be not as
[57:16] though they were
[57:19] you can't expect amen a positive result
[57:23] out of winner your confession is
[57:25] negative negative chisel baguettes
[57:31] negative yes you know you got to realize
[57:35] that man in order for this to be to
[57:39] explode for you this message you know
[57:41] your life I don't care how the devil
[57:45] make you trip how many times he make you
[57:47] fall
[57:48] I'm bride Oh Lord I just don't know who
[57:52] I am and what I am what what you can't
[57:57] speak those things out of your mouth God
[58:00] can't work with that God only works with
[58:05] faith it ain't what you do is what he's
[58:08] done you're trying to tell him he's not
[58:09] done enough he's done more than enough
[58:13] he's completed it but he needs somebody
[58:17] someone like you and me uh who's gonna
[58:20] believe what he's done we got to believe
[58:24] it but hey I don't care if I make a
[58:27] mistake right now I'm perfect ha he
[58:32] called me perfect I'm sanctified why he
[58:37] sanctified me i sanctified them through
[58:40] the truth hallelujah
[58:42] I know the truth what truth I was with
[58:46] him before the foundation of the world I
[58:48] was in him before the foundation the
[58:51] world his life is holy and so his mind
[58:54] hey you said oh but it ain't there yet
[58:57] it is you said what do you mean because
[59:02] in his time he makes all things
[59:05] beautiful your life is going to be
[59:11] beautiful at the end of the day uh-huh I
[59:14] don't think I don't think I don't think
[59:16] grayham says wait a minute Lord when she
[59:18] crossed over I don't think she says well
[59:22] Lord I just did I just don't even
[59:23] understand why you let me go that way
[59:26] because she says listen I have a book
[59:30] out there now
[59:32] you know I'm an author you know and a
[59:35] finisher and I have a book now and guess
[59:38] what you live the rough life and half of
[59:43] the stories that think you've gone
[59:44] through wasn't even written but I got
[59:48] people who are now being inspired when
[59:52] they see what I did with you
[59:53] it gives him hope it gives him safe yeah
[1:00:00] when I look at doubting Thomas
[1:00:03] you know I'm encouraged by Thomas
[1:00:06] because he was real he didn't put on a
[1:00:11] fair chic facade he was real
[1:00:15] probably more real than all the rest
[1:00:16] that was in that room unless I put my
[1:00:21] hand in his side and thrust my fingers
[1:00:23] into his room I'm not gonna believe it
[1:00:25] hello and God come to his rescue God
[1:00:32] could have said wait a minute
[1:00:33] this guy he's a tough character he's got
[1:00:39] some heavy issues everybody else is
[1:00:41] believing pretty much and yet he speaks
[1:00:46] this out of his mouth no God didn't say
[1:00:49] that you know why cuz the blood had
[1:00:53] already been shared for him he was
[1:00:56] already covered it allows his confession
[1:01:03] meant nothing to God because God knew he
[1:01:06] was God knew that the devil was
[1:01:10] inspiring him the devil was anointing
[1:01:12] him and all you had to do is come and
[1:01:14] see see it's okay when you haven't seen
[1:01:17] God move it's okay
[1:01:20] because God is able to show you he's
[1:01:24] able to come and move on your behalf he
[1:01:27] will you're no different from Thomas at
[1:01:30] times we all have those moments when
[1:01:34] difficult times things calm hallelujah
[1:01:37] people said well if you got cancer just
[1:01:39] believe don't you know that even faith
[1:01:43] that kind of faith comes from God
[1:01:46] you can believe it all you vote but
[1:01:49] until it drops in your heart by
[1:01:50] revelation that demon ain't moving
[1:01:53] he don't move when your revelation is in
[1:01:55] the head he only moves when it drops to
[1:01:58] the heart cuz winners in the heart it's
[1:02:06] gonna show I love it the way Peter
[1:02:12] Newman and I'm showing how the glory of
[1:02:14] God so I'm bringing it I'm trying to get
[1:02:16] y'all to see here your suffering is not
[1:02:18] in vain what you and I are going through
[1:02:21] these trials and tribulations you you
[1:02:23] think yourself Lord how did I get here
[1:02:25] ain't because you've been so sinful if
[1:02:28] that be the case all of us would be
[1:02:30] wiped out and listen we understand
[1:02:34] sinful now it's just not believing it
[1:02:38] ain't all the fruits of it it's just not
[1:02:40] believing and who's going to give you
[1:02:43] faith who can you give you faith and
[1:02:46] Jesus said Amen in the scriptures when
[1:02:48] the Son of man shall come shall he find
[1:02:49] faith and when the Son of man came did
[1:02:53] he find it brother Branham had to work
[1:02:57] hard to get the people to believe that
[1:02:59] angel said if you can get the people to
[1:03:01] believe all things are possible so
[1:03:04] evidently they won't believe us even
[1:03:06] though they confessed to be believers
[1:03:09] many time Balaban said there were
[1:03:11] prostitution that came through the line
[1:03:13] that got their healing and people who
[1:03:15] claimed me Christian walked away without
[1:03:18] it because they thought faith was some
[1:03:21] kind of emotion they thought faith was
[1:03:23] jumping and speaking in tongues no sir
[1:03:26] faith is a revelation that God has
[1:03:27] already done it not for somebody else
[1:03:31] for me for you is this okay listen the
[1:03:37] riches of God and that's what God wants
[1:03:39] us to see his riches his glory to know
[1:03:42] that there is no boundaries you know
[1:03:44] what
[1:03:44] that's what Paul says that the death of
[1:03:46] the height the death the width of Brent
[1:03:48] he wants us to see all of him as much as
[1:03:51] possible see at all I am God and if you
[1:03:55] can see that I can do something with you
[1:03:57] regardless to who you are
[1:03:59] regardless of what state you find
[1:04:01] yourself in it's the people who think
[1:04:03] less of themselves who God can use when
[1:04:07] you come to a place where you think you
[1:04:08] something God can use you but when you
[1:04:11] realize you ain't nothing God can use
[1:04:14] you that's where the glory of the Lord
[1:04:17] is in that individual a man who don't
[1:04:20] really think much of himself all he do
[1:04:23] is old war with me Lord or war with me
[1:04:25] I'm so unworthy of your glory not all
[1:04:28] I've done this I've done that I've done
[1:04:30] this God can't use that when you humble
[1:04:34] yourself and don't get me wrong I'm
[1:04:36] preaching on the anointing of the Holy
[1:04:37] Spirit sometimes we all get in a place
[1:04:42] where we think we're something when
[1:04:43] we're nothing we don't realize we're
[1:04:45] thinking that way but some it's easy for
[1:04:49] flesh to get up but I think I'll for the
[1:04:54] keeper God always knows how to take the
[1:04:59] air out of the balloon humble the end of
[1:05:02] it y'all know what I'm saying have you
[1:05:03] ever been humbled by God oh absolutely
[1:05:06] absolutely you love the Lord give me a
[1:05:10] few more minutes hallelujah
[1:05:14] second Thessalonians 2 13 through 15
[1:05:16] says but we are bound to give thanks
[1:05:18] always to God for you brethren beloved
[1:05:21] of the Lord because God hath from the
[1:05:24] beginning chosen you to salvation
[1:05:25] through sanctification of the Spirit and
[1:05:28] belief of the truth so when the devil
[1:05:30] tells you you can't be Saint if I take
[1:05:32] him to the scripture he chosen me to be
[1:05:35] sanctified so I am will be done y'all
[1:05:41] hear me you got to work with the word
[1:05:43] and if you don't see it today tomorrow
[1:05:46] is the saying you keep speaking write
[1:05:49] and gotta make it right
[1:05:52] it is our tongues that makes us
[1:05:56] backslide you know we speak things and
[1:06:00] then you know it puts because heat God
[1:06:03] hears you hallelujah
[1:06:05] remember the time when God told Israel
[1:06:07] cross over the Jordan and I think it was
[1:06:11] it so many tribes that says oh we can't
[1:06:13] do this
[1:06:13] because we this is that this in that net
[1:06:15] and Gaza okay because you confess this
[1:06:18] this is what's going to happen to you
[1:06:22] see when you confess things that's not
[1:06:25] right with the word those are the things
[1:06:27] that happens to you hello
[1:06:31] fear is torment but faith can move
[1:06:35] mountains
[1:06:36] is this okay oh you and I must
[1:06:41] understand our life is supposed to like
[1:06:43] be like the life of Jesus now we think
[1:06:46] about first John I'm gonna read this to
[1:06:48] you first time 1 1 through 4 and here
[1:06:51] amen he's speaking a word I love this
[1:06:55] portions of Scripture because he says
[1:06:56] that which from was from the beginning
[1:06:58] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:07:02] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:07:05] and our hands have handled of the word
[1:07:07] of life do you think he was talking
[1:07:09] about a scroll he was talking about
[1:07:14] Jesus Christ John said we've seen the
[1:07:18] world manifest we have heard him we have
[1:07:21] seen him we have handled him you know I
[1:07:24] still wonder how it must have felt with
[1:07:27] John laying in the bosom of Jesus all
[1:07:29] that an auntie oh my god
[1:07:34] you take a pill of coffee he did
[1:07:36] wouldn't been able to do it but you know
[1:07:39] it's amazing how let me say this because
[1:07:43] that Holy Ghost want me to say God has
[1:07:46] called us to rest he called he has
[1:07:50] called us to rest we're not resting in
[1:07:57] him hello the
[1:08:03] says God would grant us perfect peace if
[1:08:06] we keep our mind stared on him we're not
[1:08:12] resting come unto me all ye that labor
[1:08:15] and heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:08:19] we're not supposed to be tolling the way
[1:08:22] we're Tarly
[1:08:24] God wants us to rest labor to enter into
[1:08:29] his rest and once you get into his rest
[1:08:31] stay there right is that all right is
[1:08:37] that all right remember the little
[1:08:39] rabbit running running from the wolf I
[1:08:43] believe it what it was what it was and
[1:08:44] he saw that look crack in the rock he
[1:08:48] ran into the rock right or the dogs what
[1:08:51] it was he ran into that into that rock
[1:08:53] and where he was at rest but the dogs
[1:08:56] couldn't get there he could see the dogs
[1:09:00] the dogs could smell him the dogs knew
[1:09:03] he was in there but he was sheltered by
[1:09:06] the rocks just that little crack in that
[1:09:08] rock right the birdie meant when the
[1:09:11] store was raging that bird was in the
[1:09:14] clefts of the rock that bird could smell
[1:09:16] it see it and everything else that when
[1:09:18] he was there singing that song resting
[1:09:22] it doesn't mean that you're not gonna
[1:09:24] have trials it's not good it doesn't
[1:09:26] mean you're not gonna have tests you'll
[1:09:28] see it you could probably feel it amen
[1:09:30] but at the same time you're resting let
[1:09:33] me ask you a question what happens when
[1:09:37] death comes
[1:09:42] we're not here to fight death God is
[1:09:46] already falling the victory is already
[1:09:48] won we're supposed to scream out like
[1:09:51] power o death where is your sting
[1:09:54] hey come on death bring me my chariot
[1:10:00] see you don't when you see people about
[1:10:03] to die they rasping that being something
[1:10:05] ain't right
[1:10:06] you don't you know when you resting in
[1:10:08] God and death comes on you you just
[1:10:10] speaking positive amen oh you're looking
[1:10:14] like okay I'm waiting for those curtains
[1:10:16] to uh not too loose for me I want to see
[1:10:18] whether but we look at these things and
[1:10:23] we don't see the glory of it how blessed
[1:10:29] it's gonna be when you realize really
[1:10:33] realize that you have believed the truth
[1:10:44] it's all to the glory of God your whole
[1:10:48] life is to the glory of God do you know
[1:10:50] God allows you to make mistakes but he
[1:10:54] also allows you to correct them hey let
[1:10:59] me say it like this when brother branham
[1:11:01] lied to those people who was coming out
[1:11:06] to him for the taxes he lied here's a
[1:11:12] man who God has used with healing eyes
[1:11:15] of the blind open deaf ear stopped all
[1:11:20] kinds of miracles and he lied a big one
[1:11:25] God allowed it but then that man came
[1:11:30] around and repented and went back to
[1:11:33] that man and says listen I'm sorry
[1:11:35] I told my wife they say I wasn't at home
[1:11:37] and I was there that man said I know you
[1:11:39] truly are a man of God now you
[1:11:43] understand me well he was perhaps you
[1:11:47] know and probably the devil was probably
[1:11:48] trying to skin him you know to me you a
[1:11:51] man of God and you don't need this net
[1:11:53] now you got to go confess of that man
[1:11:55] that you
[1:11:55] and what he's gonna think about you
[1:11:57] afterwards who cares who cares as long
[1:12:02] as you make it right who cares the glory
[1:12:06] of God is now being revealed in you
[1:12:09] that's when people really know you're a
[1:12:11] real Christian when you can make things
[1:12:13] right it is okay I'm almost done
[1:12:17] may the Lord Jesus the holy son of God
[1:12:20] who I believe with all my heart to the
[1:12:22] Jehovah made manifest in the flesh I
[1:12:23] believe him to be the god of Emmanuel
[1:12:26] that cometh down from glory and formed
[1:12:28] himself into a body of flesh called the
[1:12:31] Son of God that y'all understand his
[1:12:33] father's glory that I you and I had from
[1:12:36] the beginning I now give them to this
[1:12:39] glory to them glory is seen glory is not
[1:12:48] something unseen glory is seen whether
[1:12:53] it be a radiant light or just a
[1:12:56] manifestation of a life it is seen come
[1:13:02] on y'all know even in track when that
[1:13:04] God break the record that was before him
[1:13:07] what happened he received glory he's now
[1:13:11] the head of this --trackevent thing or a
[1:13:15] man that can't just so many footballs oh
[1:13:18] yeah I'm just using these natural
[1:13:20] scenarios because I want you understand
[1:13:21] he didn't get this glory by sitting on
[1:13:25] the bench it was worth hardwork
[1:13:30] submitting to hours of laboring and
[1:13:34] working hard and you know causing
[1:13:37] physical pain just to get glory that's
[1:13:40] what they do in the natural what about
[1:13:42] us where's the sacrifice where's the
[1:13:48] hard work can we compare ourselves to
[1:13:53] the early big Christians where we
[1:13:57] standing I was telling brother Troy's as
[1:14:00] I I said I hear about those these men
[1:14:03] beforehand weren't prophets but they yet
[1:14:05] they want a million souls to Christ
[1:14:09] where's the crown where's our stars what
[1:14:13] has happened at what point in time God
[1:14:17] would glow be glorified in us are a wit
[1:14:20] you know you reason why he cannot be
[1:14:23] when you know I heard brother Aaron says
[1:14:25] if the love of the world is in you he
[1:14:27] said if you still love the world he said
[1:14:29] you're not even a Christian and you and
[1:14:34] I must understand that God is trying to
[1:14:36] get all these things out of us but we
[1:14:38] must surrender I'm closing how many of
[1:14:42] us want God's glory to be seen in us I
[1:14:44] do I don't want to be like everybody
[1:14:48] else
[1:14:49] I don't want to be you don't hurt me say
[1:14:51] this many times I don't want to be just
[1:14:52] call her a message preacher I what that
[1:14:59] means to me I just wanted if the Lord
[1:15:04] should to ever take my life I want to be
[1:15:06] known as a true son of God I want to
[1:15:12] leave that witness behind me they have
[1:15:16] seen God in me you understand me you
[1:15:25] know it is what we should be striving
[1:15:30] toward more God less of me more God none
[1:15:38] of me and that's what our footsteps
[1:15:43] should be walking toward that and guess
[1:15:51] what where the glory of Jesus Christ was
[1:15:54] really seen that cow and that was not
[1:15:58] easy that was when it was the hardest oh
[1:16:02] he had fared 10,000 fed 5000 excuse me
[1:16:05] and you know there's so many more and
[1:16:08] raised the dead but with him as a man
[1:16:13] Pressey agonizing
[1:16:17] to bring the will of God to pass he had
[1:16:22] done everything else but he wanted this
[1:16:25] was the hardest of all things to die to
[1:16:29] himself and the hardest thing you have
[1:16:32] to do is to die Jesus laid in that tomb
[1:16:40] excuse me in that guard and he laid
[1:16:42] there and he cried out cried out he kept
[1:16:45] crying out so much so he was so weak the
[1:16:48] Bible said God dispatched an angel to
[1:16:51] strengthen him his his his the intensity
[1:16:56] of it said that his sweat was like drops
[1:16:59] of blood but he had one purpose in mind
[1:17:06] not my will but thine be done
[1:17:10] may God help us may God help me that
[1:17:18] God's glory may be seen he does it in
[1:17:23] ways sometimes if we're not careful
[1:17:24] we'll miss it he doesn't always blow the
[1:17:28] horn he said look at me no sometime it's
[1:17:33] so simple as that boy brother Troy
[1:17:36] brought up this evening he says we get
[1:17:39] over there and says Lord when did we do
[1:17:41] these things
[1:17:42] sometime it's not always visible not
[1:17:46] even to us but it's known we keep our
[1:17:50] self in the way God can do whatever he
[1:17:51] wants to do and at the end of the day
[1:17:53] he'll show it all to you but we least
[1:17:57] want to be in that place where God I
[1:18:03] want him to be glorified and I don't
[1:18:08] know how y'all feel how everybody's
[1:18:10] going through and what you're going
[1:18:12] through but I put it this way I
[1:18:15] disappoint him every day but I keep
[1:18:19] praising him every day I keep worshiping
[1:18:22] him every day because let me say it like
[1:18:25] this you either sinning cold
[1:18:28] or omission either what willfully are
[1:18:32] not knowing me that you're doing
[1:18:34] something wrong and I'm gonna tell you
[1:18:37] something like this without the blood of
[1:18:38] Jesus Christ none of us would make it
[1:18:40] and we and you and I must understand at
[1:18:45] the end of the day Jesus Christ says
[1:18:49] I've never lost one and all I am is one
[1:18:56] so he never lost me he never lost you he
[1:19:01] never will lose you but yeah you
[1:19:05] understand me the devil can take your
[1:19:07] salvation your salvation is certain
[1:19:12] brother and says that he said but what
[1:19:16] you do with your salvation he says right
[1:19:21] now if you're doing something wrong and
[1:19:23] you you've got you saved you're saved
[1:19:26] but think about what you did with your
[1:19:28] save life at the end of day when they
[1:19:31] giving out rewards don't be surprised at
[1:19:36] the end of the day you want to make sure
[1:19:39] that you're doing whatever you can do
[1:19:40] you know what I'm saying to please him
[1:19:43] at the day he'd give me the reward but
[1:19:46] you do want some rewards somebody lost
[1:19:53] son and I in closing my son and I were
[1:19:56] talking I said time and chance happens
[1:20:00] to everybody everybody in this world
[1:20:04] have usually have an opportunity of
[1:20:08] bettering themselves no matter where
[1:20:12] they are I don't care if they were born
[1:20:14] in a ghetto it doesn't mean they got to
[1:20:15] stay there because God will give them
[1:20:18] that opportunity somewhere down the road
[1:20:20] he'll make a door for them now whether
[1:20:22] they change that door or not is up to
[1:20:23] them y'all think Hollywood got the best
[1:20:27] singers in the world know do you really
[1:20:30] think Hollywood got the Prius women in
[1:20:32] the world forget it
[1:20:34] because that that those women they got
[1:20:37] out there that's beautiful is all
[1:20:39] maxfactor
[1:20:44] you know what the Priya's women are in
[1:20:47] this message it's the truth
[1:20:50] why because they have a natural you know
[1:20:55] we're the most intelligent men are in
[1:20:56] this in this world to buy but they yeah
[1:21:00] in this message and I'm saying like this
[1:21:06] you know my mama couldn't read all right
[1:21:08] and I brag on that I do you know why cuz
[1:21:12] because she couldn't read or write
[1:21:14] she had sense enough to believe that the
[1:21:16] word she had more wisdom than they the
[1:21:19] man with a doctor degree she knew the
[1:21:23] word was right she lived it I saw in her
[1:21:27] and I like I said this is good don't get
[1:21:30] me wrong the Bible is right we supposed
[1:21:32] to read it we supposed to study it amen
[1:21:35] and we supposed to love it but don't you
[1:21:40] know there's a lot of people who
[1:21:41] so-called love God won't make it except
[1:21:46] the moment man is born again they're
[1:21:49] people who love this word study it far
[1:21:51] more better than and they have such a
[1:21:53] intellectual thing but it's not dad it
[1:21:56] comes by revelation is that right where
[1:22:05] was it in the script when God told
[1:22:08] Joshua march around Jericho he had no
[1:22:11] letter
[1:22:13] there was nothing written in the law but
[1:22:19] the woman with the issue of blood who
[1:22:20] told her there was no letter
[1:22:24] it was inspiration something given by
[1:22:29] God and I'm not taking away from the
[1:22:31] letter I'm not taking away from the word
[1:22:32] but just like brother Branham said and
[1:22:34] the Bible says this gospel doesn't come
[1:22:37] by intellectualism the gospel is not the
[1:22:42] word only power and demonstration I
[1:22:50] don't care how the people in this
[1:22:53] message all the word the word the word
[1:22:54] that
[1:22:55] mean a thing to me demonstrate it let's
[1:22:58] see God operate let's see the glory of
[1:23:01] God in your lives and every one of us in
[1:23:04] here has a testimony don't don't
[1:23:08] shortchange yourself you've seen the
[1:23:10] supernatural don't short change yourself
[1:23:16] because the deficit whoa you've never
[1:23:18] seen you know the Red Sea open or the
[1:23:24] Jordan River dry up or whatever the case
[1:23:27] may be but you had your own I tell
[1:23:32] somebody any day I seen God dismantle
[1:23:36] something I don't know how he did it but
[1:23:38] my wife and I was coming by way of
[1:23:40] Chicago and and there was three cars and
[1:23:42] we were all getting ready to hit each
[1:23:43] other and I don't know whether we passed
[1:23:46] through I don't know I blinked and my
[1:23:48] wife and we were on and they were gone
[1:23:50] now you explained that to be many others
[1:23:57] see stuff that doesn't you know
[1:23:58] naturally it shouldn't have happened you
[1:24:00] should be dead or something and God did
[1:24:03] it you love the Lord
[1:24:08] you're the glory of God remember that
[1:24:11] Satan gonna make you sit over you ain't
[1:24:14] nothing you ain't this night say yeah
[1:24:15] but I'm here to praise God you that's
[1:24:19] how you can tell you when the man or
[1:24:20] woman love God because when you going
[1:24:23] through some hard times and you say
[1:24:24] praise God anyhow I love him anyhow and
[1:24:27] like joe said though he slay me I'm
[1:24:29] gonna trust him in it hallelujah I'm not
[1:24:32] gonna be selfish and prideful and
[1:24:35] arrogant like Satan I'm gonna be humble
[1:24:37] I'm gonna thank the Creator he is my
[1:24:40] Creator he is your Creator I'm gonna

[1:30:14] what was the difference between those
[1:30:16] who believed in the resurrection and
[1:30:18] Thomas Thomas says I gotta analyze I
[1:30:21] gotta process this thing what y'all

[1:30:38] raised he's walking around he's alright
[1:30:43] see a lot of us don't understand what
[1:30:46] Thomas battle was because we weren't
[1:30:49] there but it wasn't easy and I don't
[1:30:52] think that he just willfully didn't want
[1:30:54] to believe he wanted to believe but he
[1:30:57] could there was some element that would
[1:30:59] not allow him to and Jesus came along
[1:31:01] and helped him don't you see when you
[1:31:04] come to a position in your life and you
[1:31:06] want to believe in you can't believe
[1:31:07] that's when we need him that's when
[1:31:10] Jesus comes around and he helps you he
[1:31:13] will make you a believer because you are
