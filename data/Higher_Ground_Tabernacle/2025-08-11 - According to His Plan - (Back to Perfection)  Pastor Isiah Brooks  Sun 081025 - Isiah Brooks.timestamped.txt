[37:29] do.
[37:36] Every time the every time God was trying
[37:38] to do something, the devil was always
[37:40] there uh trying to trouble us.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; But I know that God always wins.

[37:54] &gt;&gt; The pastor and and his wife were always
[37:57] praying for me.

[57:20] grace and his mercy. Amen.
[57:26] Hallelujah.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; You alive this morning.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. You know, I like to hear noise.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; The verse to that song says, "Thank you
[57:42] for saving
[57:45] a sinner like me.
[57:48] [Music]
[57:49] &gt;&gt; To tell the world, salvation is free.
[57:56] There was a time I just didn't know
[57:59] did do right.
[58:01] [Music]
[58:03] &gt;&gt; But you watched over me
[58:06] both day and night.
[58:08] Your grace and mercy.
[58:11] [Music]
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to give honor to uh Sister
[58:18] Rebecca, dad and mom.
[58:23] Amen. Appreciate you being here.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Glad you're here.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got a little emotional there
[58:34] &gt;&gt; because there's nothing like mom and
[58:36] dad.
[58:38] No one like mom and dad.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Both of my parents are gone,
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] &gt;&gt; so I know what I'm talking about.
[58:53] As we stand,
[58:57] &gt;&gt; we're going to be coming from Isaiah
[59:02] 40th chapter
[59:04] 25- 26.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I was quite surprised
[59:12] at the testimony and the and the song
[59:17] even the songs that how a blessing.
[59:24] I got a roof over my head. I've got food
[59:26] to eat.
[59:29] Thank you, Lord.
[59:33] Thank you, Lord. We take it for granted.
[59:38] But there are many who do not have
[59:43] a roof over their head,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; don't have a place to sleep.
[59:50] But we God has been merciful.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 40
[1:00:01] 25- 26.
[1:00:10] To whom then will ye liken me?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Or shall I be equal? said,
[1:00:19] "The Holy One,
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes on high, and behold
[1:00:24] who have created these things
[1:00:30] that bringeth out their host by number.
[1:00:36] He calleth them all by name
[1:00:40] by the greater of his might.
[1:00:44] For that he is strong in power.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Not one faileth.
[1:00:54] First Peter
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; 1
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; 15-19
[1:01:16] and it reads
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; but as he which call hath called you is
[1:01:22] holy
[1:01:26] So be ye holy in all manner of
[1:01:28] conversation.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Because it is written,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; be ye holy, for I am holy.
[1:01:41] And if you call on the father,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; who without respect a person
[1:01:48] judgeth according to every man's work,
[1:01:53] pass the time of your short journey here
[1:01:56] in fear.
[1:01:59] For as me much as you know that you were
[1:02:03] not redeemed with corruptible things,
[1:02:08] silver and gold
[1:02:10] from your vain conversation
[1:02:13] received by traditions from your father,
[1:02:18] but with the precious blood of Christ
[1:02:23] as of a lamb without blemish
[1:02:27] and without spot.
[1:02:30] Let us pray.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Our gracious father God, we come before
[1:02:34] you
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[1:02:39] We thank you for being so good to us.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you have been better to us
[1:02:44] than we have been to ourselves.
[1:02:50] We ask this morning
[1:02:53] that you would do, Lord God,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; uh your purpose and your will this
[1:02:58] morning.
[1:03:00] regardless of the audience.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that there are
[1:03:07] many who come
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; but they don't know you.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And I pray that through this message
[1:03:20] you would give them sight
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; to understand
[1:03:25] that you are in full control.
[1:03:29] and that everything moves
[1:03:32] by your will
[1:03:34] and your command.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Bless this audience
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; We are here this morning
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; only to hear the word of God.
[1:03:58] And we come to hear the word of God that
[1:04:01] we might become
[1:04:03] closer
[1:04:06] to God
[1:04:08] and to each other.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; None of us have a heaven to put anyone
[1:04:13] in.
[1:04:18] So therefore, you can't put someone in,
[1:04:19] nor can you take one someone out.
[1:04:25] I think sometimes if we would look in
[1:04:29] the mirror of the word
[1:04:33] and see what we see
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; within ourselves,
[1:04:40] we would be less judgmental
[1:04:45] of others.
[1:04:47] One thing I want to say this morning,
[1:04:51] if any of us make the rapture,
[1:04:55] it will be by the grace of God.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; It would be by election
[1:05:03] because he chose us.
[1:05:06] And I believe with all my heart that's
[1:05:09] the reason we're gathered
[1:05:13] under the message of Malachi soul
[1:05:16] because we have been chosen.
[1:05:20] I believe with all my heart that if
[1:05:23] you're going to do something,
[1:05:26] you ought to give it your best.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to God,
[1:05:33] we ought to give God our best.
[1:05:38] The message of this hour
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; has come not only to perfect us
[1:05:46] uh but it came to make us rapture ready.
[1:05:52] I believe with all my heart
[1:05:55] that this is uh the time
[1:05:59] of the revival of the bride.
[1:06:04] Not something that we could turn on,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; but something that God has ordained
[1:06:13] if we understand
[1:06:16] the mission of William Brandon,
[1:06:19] the Elijah of our day.
[1:06:21] He came
[1:06:23] to prepare us
[1:06:27] to meet our Isaac.
[1:06:31] And in doing so,
[1:06:34] He told us how
[1:06:37] that uh uh uh to meet the measures
[1:06:42] that God requires from us.
[1:06:46] For those of you who weren't to hear the
[1:06:48] last message,
[1:06:51] I was talking about the statue of a
[1:06:53] perfect man.
[1:06:55] And I said that those virtues
[1:06:59] are not just a set on the wall.
[1:07:04] But these virtues
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; in which God has given us
[1:07:10] is the absolute nature of God.
[1:07:14] absolute truth.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; There's only one divine nature
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; and we who are of this message
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; have been privileged
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; to know what God is requiring
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; from us to make a rapture.
[1:07:34] I'm not just talking about salvation.
[1:07:37] There'll be a many saved.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But only a few.
[1:07:44] according to Malachi 4, we'll make a
[1:07:46] rapture.
[1:07:49] And the reason being
[1:07:52] is because we fail,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; amen, to put on
[1:07:57] the garment of God.
[1:08:02] But by the grace of God,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; the bride of this day
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; has been ordained
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; to be the feminine form of God.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; The bride today
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; has been
[1:08:24] uh uh predestinated
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; to be the feminine form.
[1:08:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; So we must understand
[1:08:42] it took a price, a cost,
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:48] it takes something
[1:08:51] from you.
[1:08:54] Even though God has done it all,
[1:08:57] we must do something.
[1:09:01] God told the children of Israel,
[1:09:04] "I've given you the land,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; but you must fight for it."
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I heard what Brother Brandham said that
[1:09:15] a true Christian.
[1:09:17] We must not only die,
[1:09:20] but we must rot
[1:09:23] in order for the life of God to come
[1:09:25] through us.
[1:09:27] My question is,
[1:09:29] which one of us have reached that state?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Look what the prophet of God says.
[1:09:38] Isaiah 53 and4.
[1:09:42] He said, "Surely ye have borne our
[1:09:45] griefs
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and have carried our sorrows.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Yet we did esteem him.
[1:09:57] stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[1:10:01] That's Isaiah 53.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; In the message, Masterpiece
[1:10:08] year 64705,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 is to bring back
[1:10:17] to the original.
[1:10:20] And he ties the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] into the suffering
[1:10:28] of Jesus Christ himself.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 160,
[1:10:33] he says, "She is smitten from the
[1:10:35] church,
[1:10:37] from the church body, smitten with her
[1:10:40] master
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; for the same purpose.
[1:10:45] She is the word
[1:10:47] just the same as Joseph was smitten.
[1:10:50] from his brethren because he was the
[1:10:53] word. And Jesus was smitten
[1:10:58] from his brethren because he was the
[1:11:01] word. The church is smitten.
[1:11:04] The bride is smitten from the church.
[1:11:07] Because she is the word.
[1:11:10] There is there is your stage of gain.
[1:11:15] One, two, and three. See just exactly
[1:11:19] the word living in action. I love that.
[1:11:23] I love that. Don't say you're following,
[1:11:26] brother
[1:11:27] or following the message. If you're not
[1:11:30] living the word,
[1:11:33] the bride, the Bible bride,
[1:11:37] not some man-made bride.
[1:11:39] The Bible bride
[1:11:42] smitten and afflicted of God.
[1:11:45] No beauty we should desire of her,
[1:11:50] but yet we did esteem her smitten
[1:11:54] and afflicted of God.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Are y'all listening?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; You're tied in
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; to his crucifixion.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; You're tied in
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; to his suffering.
[1:12:12] So there is no way
[1:12:15] you can travel this way
[1:12:20] without suffering.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said
[1:12:28] in all things give thanks.
[1:12:31] Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] Now our suffering.
[1:12:35] It's for the gospel's sake, not because
[1:12:38] of something we have done.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. She stands alone.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; She is smitten from all the
[1:12:52] denominations
[1:12:54] according to Revelation 3. She is
[1:12:56] smitten out of church age that she was
[1:13:01] raised up in.
[1:13:03] The church was raised up in the layers
[1:13:05] in the church church aid.
[1:13:08] He said that's the husk.
[1:13:11] But if there's others went
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; let me let me say say a little read a
[1:13:19] little quote another part paragraph two
[1:13:22] paragraph.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:13:27] the f uh doubt the fountain,
[1:13:31] exhaustable fountain of life,
[1:13:34] flow through us today, Lord,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and cleanse us from all unbelief,
[1:13:42] all sin,
[1:13:44] that we might stand in thy presence now,
[1:13:49] knowing that there is need among us,
[1:13:54] that we know that we are sinners
[1:13:57] and not not worthy of any blessing.
[1:14:01] How many believe that? But then we think
[1:14:04] of him who came
[1:14:06] and took our sin.
[1:14:09] Then when he when his blood is there,
[1:14:14] it's not us in the presence of God. I
[1:14:17] want you to listen closely.
[1:14:21] I'm gonna read that portion again.
[1:14:24] But then when we think of him
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; who came and took our sins,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; then when his blood is there,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; it is not us in the presence of God.
[1:14:39] It's him.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; It's just our voice through his blood.
[1:14:47] His blood is speaking.
[1:14:50] God,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; then cleanse our hearts from sin
[1:14:55] and unbelief.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; What am I trying to do?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get your mind
[1:15:03] away from the law
[1:15:07] and bring it under grace.
[1:15:10] Because as long as you think
[1:15:14] it is your righteousness
[1:15:16] that's going to make you make a rapture,
[1:15:22] heal under bondage.
[1:15:27] It is good
[1:15:29] that we do good,
[1:15:32] but our goodness does not save us.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It will always be grace.
[1:15:40] It will always be the blood.
[1:15:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Do you realize I'm finish the quote?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; I'll finish the quote in a moment. But
[1:15:51] do you realize
[1:15:53] what God has done for you?
[1:15:56] I fear
[1:15:58] God
[1:16:00] to have known this message
[1:16:04] and to come up short
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; because my will
[1:16:10] was not surrendered to his will.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Your place in the darkness
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; will be the greatest.
[1:16:27] of all ages
[1:16:31] because to whom much is given,
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; much is required.
[1:16:40] Don't get sad. I'm trying to encourage
[1:16:41] you.
[1:16:45] Remember,
[1:16:47] no matter how faulty you are,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; God has already fixed it.
[1:16:56] That's if you are a true believer.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's if you have the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Give us
[1:17:11] the desires of our heart.
[1:17:15] For we truly have these desires to serve
[1:17:18] you
[1:17:22] in these weakening conditions and
[1:17:24] afflictions
[1:17:27] and things of the world that puts upon
[1:17:29] us something
[1:17:34] to perfect us. When we've been told that
[1:17:40] then he said, "Think it not strange.
[1:17:44] that these trials come,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; they're only working out for our good
[1:17:52] and to perfect us.
[1:17:55] Every one of our battles are different,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; but they are here to perfect you.
[1:18:03] When you come to a place where you trust
[1:18:07] God
[1:18:09] regardless to circumstances,
[1:18:12] it doesn't matter
[1:18:14] what circumstance you find yourself in.
[1:18:19] Faith,
[1:18:20] real faith, brother said has hair on his
[1:18:24] chest.
[1:18:26] Hallelujah. Real faith.
[1:18:29] Amen. Knows no defeat.
[1:18:33] Hallelujah.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the government does.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your jobs do.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what encompass you.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You've got to realize that all of heaven
[1:18:47] is on your side.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know about you.
[1:18:54] But when I look and I see the heavens,
[1:18:57] I think, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:19:00] Hallelujah. And to think that this God
[1:19:05] could humble himself
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; to save a sinner like me
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and save a sinner like you. And not only
[1:19:14] that, he didn't choose the horse to live
[1:19:17] in.
[1:19:19] He didn't choose a cow to live in.
[1:19:22] Hallelujah. He didn't choose a donkey to
[1:19:24] live in. Hallelujah. But he chose you.
[1:19:28] He chose me. Hallelujah. A creature.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With feet like bear.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Hands like a monkey.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all understand what I'm
[1:19:40] saying?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; But yet God,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; he was rich in his mercy.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't even understand it. But
[1:19:48] I'll say it like this. Where would we be
[1:19:52] had God not sent Malachi?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible said without
[1:20:00] My people without a vision,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; they perish.
[1:20:09] And if you don't study and read this
[1:20:12] message
[1:20:14] and read your Bible, hallelujah, you are
[1:20:17] going to be left without a vision.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; He loved the Lord.
[1:20:29] Now, let me finish the quote so we move
[1:20:31] on.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; What is it for to perfect us?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; We've been told.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Think it not strange that
[1:20:43] these trials come
[1:20:47] only working out for good
[1:20:50] and to perfect us."
[1:20:52] You got to believe that
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; and bring us into that place
[1:20:58] that that great
[1:21:01] desert of experience
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; where righteous men
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; are molded into saints.
[1:21:10] We thank these for the experiences.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; We with no means, no wise
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; want to do anything contrary to your
[1:21:20] will.
[1:21:22] But we pray, Father,
[1:21:25] that in this
[1:21:27] we'll be brought closer to you.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the burdens are so
[1:21:33] heavy
[1:21:35] and we can't go farther, then we raise
[1:21:38] our hands and scream
[1:21:41] to our father. Then hear from heaven,
[1:21:44] Lord.
[1:21:45] Heal us. Make us well for the kingdom of
[1:21:49] God's sake.
[1:21:52] Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God preached
[1:21:55] this message.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Right after he spoke with Sister Bruce,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Sister Bruce gave a it's called the
[1:22:07] testimony
[1:22:10] and she was a Holy Ghost filled woman.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; But she wasn't
[1:22:16] emotional.
[1:22:19] She wanted a sign that she had the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says with no doubt
[1:22:28] in my mind, sister,
[1:22:32] you are true daughter of God.
[1:22:37] And she said, "But brother Brandham, I
[1:22:38] make so many mistakes."
[1:22:42] And he said, "You know what you have to
[1:22:44] do?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Basically, stop looking at yourself.
[1:22:50] and look at
[1:22:53] perpetuation.
[1:22:57] Look and see what God has done for you.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; It's not by the law.
[1:23:05] It's by the grace of God. Y'all hear
[1:23:08] what? That's that's very important
[1:23:11] because law and grace cannot abide
[1:23:15] at the same time.
[1:23:18] Law will cause you to judge your
[1:23:20] brother.
[1:23:23] Y'all hear me?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; When you don't even know who he is.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Lord will cause you to judge your
[1:23:32] sister.
[1:23:35] When you don't know
[1:23:38] who they are,
[1:23:40] you say, "Prove it by the scripture.
[1:23:43] There was a woman caught in adultery.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] And it was the religious group.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That brought her to Jesus.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone her.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know who she was.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hold myself.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; They didn't know who she was,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; but Jesus knew.
[1:24:17] Like I say all the time,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; even a devil has the ability to bring
[1:24:24] you to Christ.
[1:24:30] And God used him.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; But when he asked a question,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to tell you, this is a
[1:24:39] judgment statement.
[1:24:42] He who is without sin
[1:24:46] Let him first cast the first stone.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; See, so if you're not without sin,
[1:24:54] you have no right to cast a stone.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; You walk away.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; There's only one righteous man
[1:25:07] and that man is Jesus Christ.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Because when the book was to be opened,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; the Bible said there was no one worthy.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; No one.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Starting from Adam all the way up,
[1:25:34] the only one worthy
[1:25:37] was the perfect seed of God,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; and that was Jesus Christ himself. Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; When the Bible tells us that Romans 3
[1:25:47] and 10
[1:25:51] here the word says,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; "As it is written,
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; there is none righteous,
[1:26:01] no not one."
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; So I don't get upset
[1:26:07] when people judge me wrongfully.
[1:26:12] Because I said, you know what, they are
[1:26:15] in the flesh, too.
[1:26:19] And as long as you in this flesh,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; you got to pray.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And you got to ask God for forgiveness
[1:26:27] just like me.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm pointing to anyone
[1:26:34] because I'm not. I'm trying to
[1:26:37] collectively speak this morning
[1:26:40] so that we can be free. So we can we can
[1:26:43] start have a revival in our soul.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is that all
[1:26:48] right?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; All righteousness
[1:26:52] was fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
[1:26:55] Hallelujah. He was God's masterpiece.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; God is a planning something.
[1:27:06] And he's doing it according to his own
[1:27:08] will and purpose.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had an affliction in
[1:27:17] his stomach
[1:27:20] for almost entire time
[1:27:23] of his life.
[1:27:25] Here he was,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; God standing in flesh.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother Van was there
[1:27:35] too, you know.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I must clarify that.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He was the man.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; But there were times God would step in
[1:27:46] the man.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And discern
[1:27:53] the hearts of the people.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:28:00] with all of that
[1:28:02] he still had to pray
[1:28:07] God heal me.
[1:28:09] How many of y'all know that?
[1:28:11] Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; I better I better pick it up cuz y'all
[1:28:14] like y'all rock going to sleep or
[1:28:16] something.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So, let me move on.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Now, when we think about it,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; let let me read this quote because I
[1:28:25] don't mean to read so much this morning,
[1:28:27] but I have to
[1:28:29] Paragraph 80 from masterpiece.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; All promises was met in him.
[1:28:35] He was the perfection of the perfection.
[1:28:39] All types were fulfilled in him.
[1:28:42] our kinsman redeemer
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; in Ruth
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and Boaz our lawgiver
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; from Mount Si
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; our prophet from the wilderness as he
[1:28:55] came from the mountain
[1:28:58] as he came from the wilderness as he
[1:29:00] come from eternity and become man the
[1:29:04] perfect image God down through the ages
[1:29:10] curing away by the patriarchs
[1:29:14] and made his platform
[1:29:16] and brought them up from the different
[1:29:18] things that he would lay this foundation
[1:29:21] upon. Hallelujah. Upon this he began to
[1:29:26] build his word,
[1:29:28] the prophets and then finally come out
[1:29:31] to the perfect prophet, the prophet
[1:29:34] foundation,
[1:29:36] the perfect vision of God that God had.
[1:29:39] Y'all understand me? What is the prophet
[1:29:42] of God working with?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; He's working with the perfection of
[1:29:47] Jesus Christ.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We ought to be grateful this
[1:29:51] morning because of the gift of God.
[1:29:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like being handed
[1:30:00] a life wrath.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; A life raft
[1:30:07] from the Titanic.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; You out of all the people,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; you get a way to escape
[1:30:16] from this world.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we know that this
[1:30:20] world is on its way down.
[1:30:24] Wake up. This is a reality.
[1:30:28] It's not just in America.
[1:30:31] It's all over the world.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; So, you and I ought to be grateful.
[1:30:39] that God has given us a way of escape.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, brother
[1:30:46] Brooks,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. Even though
[1:30:50] Noah does not type out the rapture,
[1:30:54] it still was an honor.
[1:30:57] It still was a grace of God."
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; To be on that boat.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm gonna tell you something.
[1:31:07] It was a miracle.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God sent John the
[1:31:12] Baptist,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; there had not been a prophet
[1:31:17] for 400 years.
[1:31:20] What would make a a generation
[1:31:24] hear the word of John the Baptist?
[1:31:27] It was God's plan.
[1:31:30] God had already not only if he going to
[1:31:33] send a prophet,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; he's got to make a people that can hear
[1:31:36] a prophet.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; So we realized this morning.
[1:31:44] Look at Anna.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Blind Anna
[1:31:49] in the temple.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Who's talking to Anna?
[1:31:53] But brother Brandham said Anna knew the
[1:31:57] Messiah was on hand. Hallelujah because
[1:32:00] of John the Baptist.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; We know that the Messiah is at hand
[1:32:08] because of Malachi fall because of the
[1:32:11] Elijah of our day. What are you doing?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; She was in the temple praying.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let me miss this. Can I say
[1:32:22] it like this? the coming of the Lord.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; I know he's coming.
[1:32:27] But you see,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; she understood he wasn't going to come
[1:32:33] in a form that the world was looking
[1:32:35] for.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; They were looking for a man to ride on a
[1:32:42] horse
[1:32:44] and declare he was the Messiah.
[1:32:46] But here come the Messiah
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; born,
[1:32:51] a virgin.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Wrapped in swaddling clothing.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. See, you got to have
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; somebody talking to you.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It can't be a natural man,
[1:33:07] but it's got to be the spirit of God
[1:33:10] who's telling you what time it is.
[1:33:14] what time it is. You got to know the
[1:33:17] time you living in.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is the only way you'll
[1:33:21] make yourself ready.
[1:33:25] Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You and I, we're blessed. And I know I'm
[1:33:32] not going to spend too much time,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to say it like this.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; When it comes to revival,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; God ain't talking about music.
[1:33:43] He ain't talking about dancing.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; All of that is good. You know, I love
[1:33:46] it.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he's talking about life.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; God want to see the life.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. God wants to
[1:33:57] see the life of Christ in you. He said,
[1:34:00] "When I see the token, when I see the
[1:34:03] blood," and brother Brandham said, "It's
[1:34:06] not the literal blood." Hallelujah. But
[1:34:09] it is the very life of Christ in you if
[1:34:13] you don't have it. The death angel will
[1:34:16] get you.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's why I keep preaching.
[1:34:23] It's more to the to the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; It's more to the Holy Ghost
[1:34:30] than feeling good.
[1:34:39] You understand me?
[1:34:41] Listen. How many millions followed Moses
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; and only two caught the revelation?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible said,
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb
[1:34:55] had different spirits.
[1:34:58] It
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; basically they had the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wasn't given yet.
[1:35:05] What you don't understand, the Holy
[1:35:06] Ghost was always here.
[1:35:10] The Holy Ghost ain't never left.
[1:35:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right? If you go all the way
[1:35:15] through through through the book of of
[1:35:18] of Genesis all the way up,
[1:35:21] like I said the other night, you may
[1:35:23] have called him the father,
[1:35:26] but he still was the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:28] Holy Ghost, however you want to put it.
[1:35:31] Hallelujah. People said, "Well, the Holy
[1:35:33] Ghost didn't come
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; till the day of Pentecost."
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Well, of the infilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:42] in human beings, he was now doing a new
[1:35:45] thing. Y'all hear what I'm saying? He
[1:35:48] was now doing a new thing. But he always
[1:35:52] always has been here.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "Prove it to me."
[1:36:00] Who guides the birds?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Who guides the birds flying?
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Now, maybe you've seen two birds crash,
[1:36:12] but I haven't.
[1:36:17] Hallelujah. Who showed them the
[1:36:19] direction?
[1:36:22] What is south and what's north?
[1:36:27] That's God.
[1:36:31] Who brings the rain, folks?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; You say that ain't God. Yes, it is.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; It's a curse when we don't get rained.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; You said prove it by Elijah. I'm prove
[1:36:45] it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Elijah said it will not rain
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; till I call for it.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? What was he doing?
[1:36:56] cursing the land.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; But when it rains, it brings forth crop.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It brings water to the rivers.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It makes the earth flourish.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it spiritually to you. So
[1:37:15] when it rains
[1:37:17] in the church,
[1:37:20] it gives you water.
[1:37:22] It makes you flourish.
[1:37:25] It brings that which is dead to life.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; but I want to do everything according to
[1:37:38] his plan.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter whether people like
[1:37:42] you or not.
[1:37:44] And I do. I I just have this thing
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; because I was a rejected kid.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; So I do battle complexes.
[1:37:56] But everybody does. Everybody want to be
[1:37:58] liked by people.
[1:38:00] But you got to man up.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Everybody ain't going to
[1:38:06] like you.
[1:38:08] It doesn't matter whe whether you are a
[1:38:11] a good person or not.
[1:38:14] Matter of fact, this age
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; hates good people.
[1:38:23] Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm sorry."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, you don't have to say
[1:38:29] you're sorry, but I am."
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm looking back and forth?
[1:38:36] I'm looking back and forth so I can
[1:38:37] scope everybody.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand by the grace of
[1:38:42] God, you are you are a blessed people.
[1:38:46] Somehow I want to keep saying that until
[1:38:50] it becomes a reality to you.
[1:38:53] Not because I'm saying it is because God
[1:38:57] has said it.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And I believe that.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I asked a question then.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Was Joseph blessed?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet Joseph?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet Joseph.
[1:39:16] Was he blessed?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; But Joseph had to go the way the Lord
[1:39:22] had already determined
[1:39:24] him to go.
[1:39:27] This not it's not even my notes like
[1:39:29] this. But let me say it like this.
[1:39:32] How many of you
[1:39:34] would have been feeling blessed,
[1:39:40] thrown into a ditch,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; then out of the ditch
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; you get sold into slavery,
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; right? From out of the slavery,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; you get attacked by Piper's wife.
[1:40:05] And you know she had to look like a
[1:40:06] monster.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing about her looked godly.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Then accused. Oh, don't be lying on me.
[1:40:23] Then accused
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; every accusation
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; God allows. Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; But the test is on you.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; The test is on me.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; What you going to do about it?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you what Jesus did.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:40:52] Then from there,
[1:40:56] God began to work.
[1:40:59] Y'all understand me?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; But everything was in his time.
[1:41:05] If you believe God,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care how un your your situation
[1:41:10] is.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; God makes everything beautiful.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; In his time.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Do y'all know how how hard it is
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; for people to get visas?
[1:41:30] from the Congo.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; But somebody prayer worked.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Say what you want. Faith was somewhere.
[1:41:44] And it doesn't mean you don't have
[1:41:45] faith.
[1:41:47] All things worked in God's plan.
[1:41:52] All I'm saying is if God can do it for
[1:41:54] Rebecca, God can do it for you.
[1:42:00] Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:18.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I know this is way off. I I thought I
[1:42:09] was going a different way this morning.
[1:42:13] It It's just going this way. But I I
[1:42:15] trust that you're hearing because like I
[1:42:17] said to you, I'm not here to just give
[1:42:21] you these great revelations,
[1:42:24] which all of these great revelations are
[1:42:26] great.
[1:42:28] But my my question is
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; with all of the deep revelations that
[1:42:32] you have,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; how has it changed you?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; We come for change.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; This message called for change.
[1:42:51] This message come out of the holies of
[1:42:53] holies
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; and all the rod had to do was just
[1:42:57] remain
[1:42:59] in the holies of holies.
[1:43:02] It was God who brought the chains.
[1:43:06] All you got to do is stay under the
[1:43:08] blood.
[1:43:10] Stay under this message
[1:43:12] with your sincerity of heart
[1:43:15] and God will change you.
[1:43:18] You can't change yourself.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. He said, "I
[1:43:28] counseledled thee in 18
[1:43:31] to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:43:37] that thou mayestth be rich
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; and white raignment
[1:43:42] that thou mayest be clothed, and that
[1:43:44] the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:43:46] appear,
[1:43:49] and anoint thine eyes with eyes,
[1:43:53] that thou mayest see." So what brother
[1:43:57] Brandham used the same scripture
[1:44:00] and he talks about how cold it was
[1:44:02] during his day.
[1:44:05] And I know what that is. How your eyes
[1:44:08] because of the cold match together.
[1:44:13] I remember when when that happened to
[1:44:15] me. It was very terrifying
[1:44:18] because you can't open your eyes and
[1:44:21] that that matter in your eye on your
[1:44:24] eyelid is painful
[1:44:27] trying to open your eye
[1:44:30] and they had to get oil and rub it there
[1:44:33] to break up that stuff.
[1:44:36] Hallelujah. What is God saying
[1:44:40] to open your eyes? May be a little
[1:44:41] painful.
[1:44:43] God will place the oil on there.
[1:44:46] But you need to see.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; What is this world?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; What value do you have?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I don't know. I feel
[1:44:56] like I'm crying out for somebody. What
[1:44:58] value do you have here? We don't even
[1:45:01] know what tomorrow is going to bring.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; But we must recognize
[1:45:08] who we are.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? Moses did what
[1:45:13] he was supposed to do.
[1:45:15] Noah did what he was supposed to do.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Joshua did what he was supposed to do.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; William Brandham did what he was
[1:45:21] supposed to do.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Now coming to you, what are you doing?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; What are you doing?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; What are we doing?
[1:45:31] Are we doing what we supposed to do?
[1:45:35] Oh, I come to church. Is that it?
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I pay my tithe.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Is that it?
[1:45:44] I sing songs
[1:45:46] if that is
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; absolutely not.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We supposed to be Jesus
[1:45:53] Christ
[1:45:54] manifested in the flesh manifest.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that. But the only way we can
[1:46:01] get there,
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:04] hallelujah, we've got to work.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what do you mean,
[1:46:08] Brother Bruce?"
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says labor
[1:46:13] until you come to that rest.
[1:46:16] Labor to enter into that rest.
[1:46:20] Hallelujah. That means you got to pray.
[1:46:24] Oh, you think you're going to make a
[1:46:25] rapture
[1:46:26] without praying.
[1:46:31] It ain't happening.
[1:46:33] That's why the devil don't got your
[1:46:35] prayer life at the minimum.
[1:46:38] He knows the key to making it.
[1:46:48] Every revival
[1:46:50] was started by prayer.
[1:46:52] That's what brother said. Every revival,
[1:46:56] you want to see a revival in your life
[1:46:59] personally,
[1:47:00] you got to start praying.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true. It's true. Let me move
[1:47:07] on.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Anoint your eyes so you could see.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Psalm 37:16.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; A little that a righteous man hath
[1:47:22] is better than the riches of many
[1:47:23] wicked.
[1:47:27] Say, I don't have much, brother Brook.
[1:47:32] Hallelujah. But let me tell you
[1:47:33] something.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care.
[1:47:37] If God has to place me
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; in the place of poor Lazarus,
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; who didn't have nothing,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; but he had to pretty much race
[1:47:51] with the dogs to to get the crumbs that
[1:47:53] fell from the table.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But look where he ended up
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; versus where the rich man ended up.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:48:06] Hallelujah.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Romans 4.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; For what saith the scripture?
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; And it was counted unto him for
[1:48:18] righteousness.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't just believe something.
[1:48:23] He believed all things.
[1:48:26] Was Abraham faulty?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; He was a man.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He did man things.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; But God says he didn't find nothing
[1:48:42] because it was trusted in the blood.
[1:48:45] Abraham was under different covenant.
[1:48:49] An unconditional covenant. Do you
[1:48:52] understand this? Unconditional.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; When you're chosen by God,
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry about the Holy
[1:49:03] Ghost.
[1:49:05] God will make sure you get it.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; He will either lead you
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; like the lamb
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; or he will drive you
[1:49:18] like the cattle.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he's going to
[1:49:22] positionally place you in a place that
[1:49:25] you will get it.
[1:49:27] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, wait a
[1:49:29] minute, brother. Let me tell you
[1:49:30] something. I tell everybody. If you got
[1:49:33] a thirst to do righteous,
[1:49:37] God gave you that thirst.
[1:49:40] Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And if you have that thirst,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; he said you will be filled.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ain't got it yet.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Well, one thing is good about it.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; You're hungry for more God.
[1:50:01] And if you're hungry for more God,
[1:50:04] you're going to get more God.
[1:50:06] But if you look at this message like
[1:50:09] another branch of religion,
[1:50:12] all you're going to get is a religious
[1:50:14] spirit.
[1:50:16] Hallelujah. You'll never be an
[1:50:18] overcomer.
[1:50:20] Hallelujah. But when you see this bread
[1:50:23] that came from heaven as being the bread
[1:50:26] of God, as being the body of God, as
[1:50:30] being the eternal life that God has has
[1:50:33] broken up and given to us. Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] Oh my God.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; The world don't know what they in for.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz when this bride get in
[1:50:44] her rightful place,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; we won't have to we won't have to have a
[1:50:50] sign on our back.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; They will know.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; It'll be a short time.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; I know people don't think we're going to
[1:51:02] have another outpouring, but we will.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all asking for it?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; You need to be crying out for that.
[1:51:12] Send it, Lord. The prophet said, "We
[1:51:14] have it."
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz let me ask you a question.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; With the way things are now,
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; you and I know that God is separating
[1:51:23] from the earth.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; He's pulling away from it.
[1:51:29] This is why Satan is doing what he's
[1:51:31] doing.
[1:51:34] Yeah. You're the only one. You're the
[1:51:37] only piece of sand
[1:51:40] that literally has God in it.
[1:51:45] And then when we're taken,
[1:51:47] the whole world would go into chaos.
[1:51:51] Do you understand what I'm saying? If
[1:51:53] God is drawing his spirit,
[1:51:57] that means he's drawing us up with his
[1:52:00] spirit.
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I just know I know my
[1:52:09] struggles
[1:52:11] and I know you're struggling too.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; But my my thing is that you got to do
[1:52:17] something about it.
[1:52:22] You got to you got to cry out.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Like brother said, you got to cry out.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Let me finish my scripture. Sorry.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Now to him that workketh is the reward,
[1:52:34] not reckon of grace.
[1:52:37] but of debt,
[1:52:39] not to him that workketh not,
[1:52:42] but believeth on him that justifyth.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; The ungodly
[1:52:47] his faith is counted for righteousness.
[1:52:51] How many of y'all believe that? Do you
[1:52:53] know what ungodliness is?
[1:52:56] Ungodliness is you're supposed to be
[1:52:58] godly,
[1:53:01] but you're doing ungodly things.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Galatians 3
[1:53:13] 6 through9.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I may I'm over my time, but that's
[1:53:17] all right.
[1:53:19] We we're going to have communion for
[1:53:20] those who want communion.
[1:53:24] it was announced on the uh
[1:53:27] uh
[1:53:31] internet. But anyway, if you weren't
[1:53:33] prepared for it, that that's those who
[1:53:36] are prepared, we will
[1:53:38] Galatians 3 6 through9,
[1:53:42] even as Abraham believed God,
[1:53:46] and it was accounted to him for
[1:53:47] righteousness.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:53:53] faith, the same are the children of
[1:53:56] Abraham.
[1:53:58] And the scripture for seeing that God
[1:54:01] would justify
[1:54:03] the heathen through faith
[1:54:05] preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
[1:54:08] saying, "In these shall all nations be
[1:54:12] blessed,
[1:54:14] so then they which be of faith
[1:54:17] are blessed with faith for Abraham."
[1:54:21] How many of y'all know that? You say, "I
[1:54:24] know it. Oh, I really know it." You
[1:54:26] don't know it until your trials come.
[1:54:29] When your test come, that's when you
[1:54:31] prove
[1:54:36] it. You know it. You say, "Well, wait a
[1:54:38] minute, brother. Let me say it like
[1:54:39] this. When Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:54:41] Abedneo,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; they knew who they were. They were of
[1:54:46] Abraham's seed
[1:54:48] and they were faithful to God.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; This is what I love.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; even though God didn't answer them in
[1:54:56] their prayer,
[1:54:59] they said,
[1:55:02] "I'm going to stand with God anyway.
[1:55:06] Whether he answer me or not,
[1:55:10] I'm going to stand with him anyway.
[1:55:14] I don't need a feeling.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; All I need is his word.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham,
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen, was the father of faith.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And we are of what? Abraham's seed,
[1:55:32] not of the natural,
[1:55:35] of the spiritual.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you a question. I know
[1:55:38] this is simple, but I've got to go this
[1:55:40] way. This the way he's leading. You've
[1:55:43] never seen an apple tree
[1:55:46] bring forth nothing other
[1:55:50] than apples
[1:55:52] unless something else
[1:55:55] has been grafted.
[1:55:58] where we have the seed of God
[1:56:01] and doesn't matter what Satan do.
[1:56:06] This seed cannot be hid,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; he cannot graft anything into us
[1:56:14] that's going to change us
[1:56:17] from what his purpose
[1:56:21] for us to be.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I hope I said that correctly. There's
[1:56:25] nothing he can do. that can change you.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; If you've been ordained to be bride,
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; well, you might not feel like it,
[1:56:38] but nevertheless, it's not on feelings,
[1:56:40] it's on faith.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Can I address this without anybody being
[1:56:50] offended?
[1:56:53] How did the congalles?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; How did you get to America?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Was it not faith?
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Many of friends
[1:57:05] were turned down.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Perhaps many rel.
[1:57:11] But you believe.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Somewhere you believe.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And because you had that faith
[1:57:21] God brought you here.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Now you're a witness.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I once believed
[1:57:32] but now I see.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; That's how the gospel is.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; If you can believe the gospel that way,
[1:57:41] you will see it that way.
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much. Ah, I don't have
[1:57:50] to
[1:57:51] Pump it up.
[1:57:54] Something just registers.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:58:02] It It amazes me.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Abraham seed. Now, I know I've gone over
[1:58:06] time, but I'm
[1:58:08] got to finish this.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things. Sometimes I put
[1:58:17] too much stuff.
[1:58:20] Let me move down.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I'mma use this scripture.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:1-12
[1:58:33] and then I I'll close on this. Okay.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; I I I I don't know sometime how to say
[1:58:42] things.
[1:58:44] I know what I'm looking at
[1:58:48] and
[1:58:49] I don't know why I've been having dreams
[1:58:51] of people who've gone on. I even dreamed
[1:58:56] our brother Keith the other night or
[1:58:58] this morning, whenever it was,
[1:59:00] but I've been seeing things. I don't I'm
[1:59:03] not trying to be a fanatic.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; But I'm going tell you, it's later than
[1:59:07] you think.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; I just hope you all none of you have the
[1:59:13] experience of coming to church and
[1:59:14] Brother Brooks doesn't show up.
[1:59:23] I pray by the grace of God that when we
[1:59:26] we all go up.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; 1 through 12.
[1:59:45] I remember when I was a boy,
[1:59:48] I knew nothing about God.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; I was in the junior high school.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; That would have been my seventh or
[1:59:58] eighth grade year.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; I had a dream.
[2:00:04] I wasn't even a Christian as far as I
[2:00:06] was concerned.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; I gave my heart to the Lord when I was
[2:00:11] 12.
[2:00:13] in a Baptist church.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; But that's all I knew.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; My life changed even then.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; He took hatred out of my heart.
[2:00:25] I couldn't hate anybody no matter what
[2:00:28] they did to me.
[2:00:29] I never have been able to hate.
[2:00:34] And I thought something was wrong with
[2:00:35] me
[2:00:37] because I wanted to.
[2:00:40] I wanted to do to people what they were
[2:00:42] doing to me,
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:45] but I never had that ability.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; But in that dream, if you don't mind me
[2:00:51] pausing,
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; we were
[2:00:59] up in heaven.
[2:01:03] I stood before the Lord
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; and um and the gate was open
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; and
[2:01:14] all kinds of people were coming through
[2:01:16] that gate
[2:01:20] like everyone
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; and I was standing
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; which would have been on Jesus's right
[2:01:30] he was facing
[2:01:34] and um
[2:01:37] anyhow
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I was inside the gate
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; while all of these people were coming in
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; at that time I had even never played a
[2:01:49] tambourine
[2:01:53] but uh coming through the gate
[2:01:56] I was playing a tambourine
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; and it has seven colors
[2:02:04] Well, I didn't even know what that was.
[2:02:07] I thought it was a decorated
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; tambourine.
[2:02:13] That's why nobody in this message can
[2:02:15] take my tambourine away from me.
[2:02:21] Cuz I know I played it there.
[2:02:26] I didn't even understand it.
[2:02:30] I remember
[2:02:32] being fearful
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; because Jesus was watching everybody but
[2:02:37] me
[2:02:40] I mean sorry he was watching me and
[2:02:43] everybody else was coming through and
[2:02:45] I'm thinking why is he watching me
[2:02:49] in my dream
[2:02:51] it is a dream I'm just telling a dream
[2:02:55] but I was afraid
[2:02:57] and I was feeling so unworthy further
[2:02:59] that he wasn't going to let me in.
[2:03:05] But then the Lord quickened to me,
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; you were already in.
[2:03:12] Salt clothed people.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's why I say,
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; excuse me,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; I know it's in my day.
[2:03:28] I know it's in my day
[2:03:31] when the door of the Gentiles would be
[2:03:33] closed
[2:03:35] why he showed me that at a young age I
[2:03:37] thought
[2:03:40] but just at the moment
[2:03:42] that I thought he would not take me
[2:03:48] in a moment in a quinking
[2:03:51] second I stood in front of Jesus
[2:03:55] and you know what he did to me? He
[2:03:57] lifted me up.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And you might not believe it, but he
[2:04:00] kissed me on my lips.
[2:04:06] I woke up screaming.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; And that anointing that I was to soon
[2:04:12] experience
[2:04:15] was all over me like a cloud.
[2:04:18] God is my witness. I lie not.
[2:04:23] I ran into my mother's room.
[2:04:26] She was a real Christian.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Mama,
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; I just dreamed about Jesus."
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And I began to tell her about Jesus.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; And uh
[2:04:42] she I scared her half to death.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; It was in the night.
[2:04:48] She woke up when I told her that.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; She said the wrong things.
[2:04:55] She said, "Praise the Lord.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; God done call my son to preach."
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; I walked out of her room.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; All of that experience
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; went.
[2:05:18] I didn't want to be nobody's preacher.
[2:05:22] And I said to myself, I'm not going back
[2:05:24] to church.
[2:05:27] Be a preacher.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; I suffer.
[2:05:35] I got scars.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; God took my mama
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; and he told me that's why he took her.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Because I wasn't obedient.
[2:05:51] So you see
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; I know
[2:05:59] when God wants you to do something,
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; you got to do it
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; or else he will drive you to do it.
[2:06:11] I had been led tried. He tried to leave
[2:06:14] me for years.
[2:06:18] Pride would not let me go.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you see me saying things that
[2:06:26] no other preacher say.
[2:06:31] Because I'm about saying what he wants
[2:06:32] me
[2:06:34] and not what others might want.
[2:06:38] And I know I would be judged.
[2:06:41] by others who were saying,
[2:06:45] "Brother Brooks is off to work.
[2:06:48] But it doesn't matter. I'm preaching to
[2:06:51] the bride.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; That's all I'm here for.
[2:06:56] She'll get it if nobody else will."
[2:07:01] Now, let's go to Isaiah 53.
[2:07:05] There's more to that.
[2:07:08] Every time
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; I would get really sad
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; when I was in the Pentecostal church,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; God would always bring that dream back
[2:07:18] to me.
[2:07:22] When I came to this message
[2:07:25] was the only time I understood what the
[2:07:27] dream meant.
[2:07:31] Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; 1 through 12. I'm going let you go.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Says, "Who have believed our report?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[2:07:46] revealed?
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a
[2:07:51] tender plant,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and a root out of a dry ground.
[2:07:57] He hath no form nor calmliness.
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:02] And when we shall see him, there is no
[2:08:05] beauty that we should desire him.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is despised
[2:08:12] and rejected of men.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Bride, you were there.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; You were in him.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; This is why you are have been already
[2:08:23] equipped
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; to take rejection.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right? A man of
[2:08:32] sorrows
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; and acquainted with grief.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where did he get this grief?
[2:08:40] Where did he get his?
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; It was from his own house.
[2:08:46] His enemy was from his own house, from
[2:08:48] the church. Hallelujah. And we hid as it
[2:08:52] were our faces from him.
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; He was despised.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; And we esteemed him not.
[2:09:03] So much so Jesus said, "A prophet is
[2:09:05] without honor
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; in his own country.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Surely he have borne our griefs
[2:09:15] and carried our sorrows. Yet we did
[2:09:18] esteem him stricken and smitten of God
[2:09:22] and afflicted."
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; We've gone through nothing compared to
[2:09:28] the church ages before us.
[2:09:32] Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] But he was wounded for our
[2:09:36] transgression.
[2:09:38] He was bruised for our iniquity.
[2:09:40] The chastisement of our peace
[2:09:43] was upon him. And with his stripes we
[2:09:46] are
[2:09:48] healed.
[2:09:50] Not will be healed. We are healed.
[2:09:54] And we all like sheep have gone astray.
[2:09:58] We have turned everyone to his own way.
[2:10:03] And the Lord laid on him the iniquities
[2:10:05] of us all. Think about it.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Even when brother Brandham judged that
[2:10:11] woman with the purple hair and the
[2:10:14] purple nail. Hallelujah.
[2:10:17] God had to straighten him out.
[2:10:20] Hallelujah. See what I'm saying? If God
[2:10:23] straighten the prophet out, he going to
[2:10:24] straighten you out.
[2:10:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know who the woman was,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; but he says such things as this.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; She was a thing.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the prophet,
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; but to God,
[2:10:42] she was a daughter.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? You can't
[2:10:47] judge people by the way they look.
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Who could have looked more holy than the
[2:10:54] Pharisees?
[2:10:57] Hallelujah. But God came to his own.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He came to a blind man.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; A woman with issue of blood.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said those who are
[2:11:11] healthy, they don't need a physician.
[2:11:15] Hallelujah. I don't know about you.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; I need him as a physician.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; He was oppressed. He was afflicted.
[2:11:25] that he open not his what?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; He is bought as a lamb to the slaughter.
[2:11:32] Hallelujah. And as a sheep before the
[2:11:34] sheer is dumb. So he opened not his
[2:11:37] mouth.
[2:11:39] Hallelujah. People going to say what
[2:11:40] they want to say. They'll make lies on
[2:11:44] you. They're going to do everything they
[2:11:46] can do. Hallelujah. But why stir the
[2:11:49] fire?
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Leave it.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Go down on your knees in prayer. Pray.
[2:11:56] That's it.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's how that's our warfare. That's
[2:11:59] our war weapons.
[2:12:01] He was taken from prison and from
[2:12:03] judgment.
[2:12:05] And who shall declare as this
[2:12:06] generation?
[2:12:08] But he was cut out out of the land of
[2:12:10] the living
[2:12:12] for the transgression of people was he
[2:12:14] stricken. Hallelujah. Who's going to
[2:12:17] who's going to declare his generation?
[2:12:19] We are.
[2:12:21] We are. I am.
[2:12:24] And he made his grave with the wicked
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; and with the rich in his death because
[2:12:30] he had done no violence.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Neither was any deceit in his life.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; So you we're talking about brother
[2:12:40] Brooks.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; It was Nicodemus
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; who helped Joseph
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; to bury Jesus
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; among the rich.
[2:12:53] But he was prophesied
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; with the rich in his death.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; It can't be a coincidence.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; But Nicodemus
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; and Joseph
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; was there to take his body.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus truly became a believer.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.
[2:13:20] He hath put him to grief
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; when thou hath shall make his soul on an
[2:13:27] offering for sin.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; 10th verse,
[2:13:32] he shall see his seed.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; He shall see his seed.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; But he died.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; He shall see his seed.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall prolong his days
[2:13:49] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[2:13:50] prosper in his handsper.
[2:13:54] I'm almost done. Just he shall see the
[2:13:57] travail of his soul
[2:14:00] and shall be satisfied.
[2:14:02] By his knowledge shall thy my righteous
[2:14:04] servants justify thee.
[2:14:08] For he shall bear their iniquities. How
[2:14:11] many of y'all know what iniquities is?
[2:14:14] to do to know to do good and do it.
[2:14:17] Therefore will I divide him a portion
[2:14:20] with the great and he shall divide a
[2:14:23] spoil with the strong
[2:14:26] because he have poured out his soul
[2:14:28] against him.
[2:14:30] And he was numbered with the
[2:14:31] transgressors
[2:14:33] and he beared the sins of many
[2:14:37] and made intercession for the
[2:14:39] transgression.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say it like this.
[2:14:43] If you can't see yourself in this
[2:14:45] scripture,
[2:14:48] ask God to give it to you.
[2:14:52] His suffering
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; was our suffering.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; His victory
[2:14:58] was our victory
[2:15:01] and we shouldn't be worried about
[2:15:03] anything.
[2:15:06] Don't let the devil take your joy
[2:15:11] because that's where your strength lies.
[2:15:16] Know that you you you've got a resting
[2:15:19] place.
[2:15:21] It doesn't matter what you go through.
[2:15:24] You lose your house, you lose a car, you
[2:15:27] lose different things in this world,
[2:15:30] but blessed be the name of the Lord. For
[2:15:33] the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh
[2:15:35] away. your understanding. This is a time
[2:15:38] that we should be rejoicing
[2:15:41] so much,
[2:15:44] but God didn't allow me to go that way.
[2:15:46] For whatever reason, there's somebody
[2:15:48] that needs to hear or needed to hear
[2:15:51] what's being said.
[2:15:54] Backsliding
[2:15:56] doesn't mean to go backwards.
[2:16:00] Backsliding
[2:16:02] means not to go forward.
[2:16:06] When a cow backs slide,
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; a cow backslides,
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; he buckles his knees
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; and refuse to go forward.
[2:16:23] And that's what happens to many.
[2:16:26] We're just stuck. We're not going
[2:16:29] forward.
[2:16:31] You got to go forward.
[2:16:34] You don't go backwards.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; You got to see progress
[2:16:44] within yourself
[2:16:47] because Jesus said in that day, you'll
[2:16:50] know that I'm in the Father, the Father
[2:16:53] is in me and I am.
[2:16:56] You've got to know that.
[2:16:59] Now, I'm I'm I'm like I said
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; went a different way
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; than I expected. But I pray that God
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; has touched somebody this morning
[2:17:13] other than with
[2:17:16] the thought that I'm going too long.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; But my desire is to see souls saved.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; My desire is to see people overcome.
[2:17:29] themselves overcome tradition or
[2:17:32] overcome things that have been taught
[2:17:36] that doesn't ma that match up with the
[2:17:38] word only the word
[2:17:42] the purity of the word
[2:17:45] that's all we'll make it
[2:17:49] it's up to us God gives us that choice
[2:17:52] yet still he know who will and who who
[2:17:58] Many of us, we've made so many mistakes.
[2:18:03] Perhaps you think you're not savable.
[2:18:08] But let me say it like this.
[2:18:10] You're not worth that much.
[2:18:14] That God can't pay the price for you.
[2:18:19] He's already paid the price
[2:18:23] and he wants you to be free.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine
[2:18:29] what it must have been for the children
[2:18:31] of Israel
[2:18:34] under Pharaoh's bondage?
[2:18:39] They got out of Egypt
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; and they for quickly forgot
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; and they went back in bondage,
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; but not by the Pharaoh in Egypt,
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; but they were came in bondage
[2:19:03] will
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; by disbelieving
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; the words of Moses.
[2:19:13] You love God.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; God is so good to us
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; and I really appreciate you.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're going to do.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing a song.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; We're dismissed for those who
[2:19:33] are not here to take communion.
[2:19:41] I'll say I'll give you a half hour
[2:19:45] 15 minutes, whatever it is.
[2:19:48] You can either go out
[2:19:51] and uh and then come back in for those
[2:19:54] who want to.
[2:19:57] It's a quarter. It's about a quarter to
[2:19:58] one.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Let's just give you 15 minutes.
[2:20:06] So, by the grace of God, we'll
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; come back in and start uh our communion
[2:20:12] service
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; at at 1:00.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; So, we love the Lord
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; and um I I just uh pray that somehow
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; that the time
[2:20:34] You could be doing something that's not
[2:20:35] even sinful.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; If it's taking your time with God,
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; you need to give that up and give it to
[2:20:45] God.
[2:20:49] Idolatry
[2:20:51] doesn't mean you're bowing down before
[2:20:53] idol.
[2:20:58] Idolatry means
[2:21:00] you become idols.
[2:21:05] We call it,
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; "Oh, I'm so bored."
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Why are you bored when you got the word?
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; When God died,
[2:21:19] he died so we could have fellowship with
[2:21:22] him.
[2:21:24] Why? But we're not having fellowship
[2:21:25] with him.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Fellowship don't mean just coming to
[2:21:29] church. fellowship with him every day,
[2:21:31] all day if you can.
[2:21:35] That's what he wants.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; When you get to heaven,
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; what kind of fellowship you going to
[2:21:43] have there,
[2:21:46] won't be no football game,
[2:21:50] won't be no iPads,
[2:21:54] no, it won't be any of that. Everything
[2:21:56] will be focused on Christ.
[2:21:58] everything.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; So the Christian, the true Christian
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; never gets bored with God.
[2:22:09] blessed day.

[2:56:20] Communion uh to me is
[2:56:23] out of the all of the services that we
[2:56:26] have, it's uh to me the most precious
[2:56:31] one.
[2:56:41] a communion
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; and always would be afraid
[2:56:49] &gt;&gt; not to take it
[2:56:52] bread and the wine because
[2:56:54] I could always find
[2:56:57] where I had done something wrong.
[2:57:02] Um, I know by the grace of God,
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; the only way you'll ever be faithful in
[2:57:10] taking communion
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; is to understand the grace of God.
[2:57:19] Communion is not set to judge us
[2:57:23] to death.
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; It is a witness that you have life.
[2:57:32] That's why the Bible said that you
[2:57:34] examine yourself,
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; not your neighbor
[2:57:40] yourself.
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; And when you your earnest desire
[2:57:46] to do the perfect will of God
[2:57:50] you
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; because that is the Holy Spirit
[2:57:55] in you.
[2:57:57] Now whether we ever live perfectly
[2:58:04] is not the case.
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ lived perfectly for us.
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; But he wants us to acknowledge
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; that is because it's it's because of his
[2:58:18] communion.
[2:58:21] You know, he said don't don't forget
[2:58:22] this.
[2:58:24] Don't forget this. When he was doing the
[2:58:26] last supper, he said don't forget this.
[2:58:30] If you forget this, you forget me.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; You forget what I've done for you.
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why I love communion. As far
[2:58:39] as I'm concerned, we don't have it
[2:58:41] regularly enough.
[2:58:45] I think about the death, burial, and
[2:58:47] resurrection.
[2:58:52] Jesus Christ, all he did for us. We
[2:58:55] can't imagine the suffering that he went
[2:58:57] through.
[2:59:00] And we are acknowledging within
[2:59:02] ourselves
[2:59:05] that we do understand.
[2:59:07] We're partakers of this. These we are
[2:59:10] partakers of this and and the breaking
[2:59:13] of the bread is the breaking of his body
[2:59:18] and which he did on Calvary.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; His body was broken.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; But a spiritual body
[2:59:27] The Holy Spirit was
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; on the day of Pentecost.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; He gave them himself.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; And in this communion
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; to say amen to the Lord
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; for giving us himself.
[2:59:45] Amen. As we stand,
[2:59:48] we'll read the word
[2:59:51] according to first Corinthians
[2:59:54] the 11th chapter.
[3:00:04] And it reads,
[3:00:06] "For I have received of the Lord that
[3:00:08] which was also in which he was betrayed,
[3:00:12] took bread,
[3:00:20] &gt;&gt; and when he had given thanks, he break
[3:00:22] it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[3:00:26] which is broken for you. This do in
[3:00:28] remembrance of me.
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; After the same manner also he took the
[3:00:38] cup and when he had sucked, saying,
[3:00:41] "This cup is the new testament in my
[3:00:44] blood. This do eat as often as you drink
[3:00:47] it in remeance of me.
[3:00:58] For as often as you do eat this bread
[3:01:00] and drink this cup, ye do show the
[3:01:02] Lord's death till he come.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[3:01:13] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[3:01:16] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[3:01:18] and blood of the Lord.
[3:01:27] For let a man examine himself, and so
[3:01:29] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[3:01:32] that cup.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; For he that eateth and drinkketh
[3:01:40] unworthy, eateth and drinkkeeth
[3:01:42] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[3:01:45] Lord's body.
[3:01:50] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[3:01:53] among you and many sleep.
[3:02:00] &gt;&gt; For if we would judge ourselves, we
[3:02:03] should not be judged. So did y'all hear
[3:02:05] that? If we judge ourselves,
[3:02:10] so there be anything that's in your life
[3:02:13] or anything that you need to correct
[3:02:15] with God, this would be the time.
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; But when we are judged, we are chasened
[3:02:23] of the Lord that we should not be
[3:02:26] condemned with the world.
[3:02:35] Therefore, my brethren, when you come
[3:02:37] together to eat, tar one for another.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; If any man hunger, let him h let him eat
[3:02:48] at home. Let you come not together unto
[3:02:51] condemnation, and the rest I will set in
[3:02:54] order when I come.

[3:07:28] before you. We thank you for this time
[3:07:30] of communion.

[3:07:35] one with reverence and respect.
[3:07:38] We pray father god
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; as we have broken your bread
[3:07:43] &gt;&gt; which is representative of your body.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; We know it's not the literal body but
[3:07:49] father you told us to do this in honor
[3:07:51] of you.
[3:07:53] So Lord as we partake of this bread
[3:07:57] we pray that you would heal any that is
[3:08:00] sick any that is affected.

[3:08:39] As we partake of the blood of this wine

[3:13:26] I trust that every one of you feel as
[3:13:28] good inside as I feel.
[3:13:34] &gt;&gt; There was one thing that I did from that
[3:13:36] dream
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; is that when I did see Jesus,
[3:13:42] &gt;&gt; he looked like the heart.
[3:13:47] &gt;&gt; And I can remember from that time on
[3:13:52] telling people when we did see another
[3:13:55] picture of Jesus
[3:13:57] that wasn't him,
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't know other than what I did see.
[3:14:04] Please, I'm not trying to be
[3:14:13] no greater than any other pastor or
[3:14:15] preacher.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; But I believe that was a personal
[3:14:20] message to me
[3:14:23] and you know I shared it with the
[3:14:24] church.
[3:14:27] Trust that you will have more confidence
[3:14:30] in the word.
[3:14:33] The word is true.
[3:14:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to make a rapture.
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm so excited about time that I'm
[3:14:41] living in.
[3:14:45] &gt;&gt; We got all these things happening,
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; but it vindicates the word.
[3:14:53] It proves Brother Brandon was who he
[3:14:55] said he was.
[3:14:57] Everything we see has been is being
[3:15:00] fulfilled so quickly.
[3:15:03] And I just want people to constantly
[3:15:05] watch Jesus.
[3:15:08] Let's not think like Peter
[3:15:10] when the storms come.
[3:15:13] &gt;&gt; Let's keep focused.
[3:15:15] &gt;&gt; And if we were to sniff,
[3:15:18] &gt;&gt; he did pull Peter back up.
[3:15:21] So our destiny is positive
[3:15:25] and I love it. I'm just
[3:15:28] with all the things I go through on a
[3:15:29] daily basis.
[3:15:31] mental bound of that nature.
[3:15:36] I have a hiding place just like you
[3:15:40] and that's in Christ.
[3:15:42] &gt;&gt; So what we're going to do, we're going
[3:15:43] to do our foot
[3:15:47] and then we'll assemble back in here and
[3:15:49] then we'll be
[3:15:52] sisters in the best.
[3:15:56] Thank you.

[3:34:19] &gt;&gt; It could not have been done
[3:34:21] &gt;&gt; except we had a perfect sacrifice.
[3:34:26] I don't know about everybody else.
[3:34:30] &gt;&gt; I need the mercy and grace of God
[3:34:33] every day, all day.
[3:34:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm so
[3:34:40] I know how unworthy I am.
[3:34:43] And I I stand even as a pastor only
[3:34:46] because he's worthy.
[3:34:49] I rest on his word.
[3:34:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I just uh
[3:34:56] I love the people of God.
[3:34:58] &gt;&gt; I love
[3:35:01] uh this I don't know how you call it.
[3:35:06] &gt;&gt; What I go through
[3:35:08] the the journey
[3:35:10] &gt;&gt; has been wonderful.
[3:35:12] &gt;&gt; There have been hills there.
[3:35:16] There have been trenches,
[3:35:19] &gt;&gt; digital,
[3:35:21] &gt;&gt; you know, you name it. We've gone
[3:35:24] through a lot.
[3:35:27] &gt;&gt; But I can truly say it's been worth it.
[3:35:31] &gt;&gt; Every moment of it.
[3:35:35] You know, I I used to see my mom
[3:35:40] &gt;&gt; enjoying Jesus.
[3:35:43] &gt;&gt; I had no idea what it was about.
[3:35:46] I'd read the scriptures to get happy.
[3:35:50] &gt;&gt; And to me, I didn't even understand what
[3:35:51] I was reading.
[3:35:55] &gt;&gt; But when the word becomes life to you,
[3:35:59] &gt;&gt; oh,
[3:36:01] you're never alone.
