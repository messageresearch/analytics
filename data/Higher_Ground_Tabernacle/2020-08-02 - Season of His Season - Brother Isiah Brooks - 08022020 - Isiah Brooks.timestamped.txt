[42:37] that will not give up
[42:54] father we have not received anything of

[43:24] not worthy of
[43:30] [Music]
[43:51] as we turn to the scripture
[43:56] we're going to ask that you turn psalms
[44:01] the first chapter we start at the third
[44:04] verse we're just going to read that
[44:06] particular verse
[44:10] and then we'll go to
[44:14] acts
[44:18] and then we'll read the tenth through
[44:19] the twelfth verse
[44:23] glad to see everybody this morning
[44:29] psalms 1 third verse
[44:33] poison version
[44:40] and he shall be like a tree
[44:43] planted by the rivers of water
[44:47] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[44:49] season
[44:51] his leaf also shall not wither
[44:54] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[44:58] now
[45:02] you don't need
[45:16] um
[45:20] be it known unto you all and to all the
[45:24] people of
[45:24] israel that by the name of jesus christ
[45:28] of nazareth
[45:29] whom you have crucified who god raised
[45:33] from the dead
[45:34] even by him did this man stand here
[45:37] before you
[45:38] oh
[45:44] no jesus
[45:54] this is the stone which was set at north
[45:56] of you builders
[45:58] which has become the head of the corner
[46:07] neither is there salvation in any other
[46:10] for there is none other name under
[46:13] heaven given among men
[46:15] whereby we must be saved
[46:20] [Music]
[46:25] let us pray father
[46:49] most of all that we may be able to
[46:50] commune with you
[46:53] now in the name of jesus christ amen
[46:56] amen
[46:57] you may be seated speaking of communion
[47:01] we will also have communion services
[47:07] beginning at three o'clock
[47:11] last week we we ministered
[47:15] perfect compassion of his will
[47:21] and we showed by god's grace
[47:25] that god compassion is different from
[47:28] ours
[47:31] oftentimes we want to give compassion
[48:03] who was not as brother branham said
[48:07] the sickest of all the people
[48:11] because he was asked
[48:15] what was his problem
[48:18] and he said every time i tried to get
[48:21] into the pool is that the shock
[48:22] would you say
[48:23] someone that beats me to it
[48:28] hallelujah and jesus christ jesus
[48:32] healed
[48:39] [Music]
[48:46] we may or
[49:00] full control it didn't control god the
[49:03] holy ghost
[49:09] he only would do the things in which the
[49:13] father showed him
[49:41] but when you're moving by the compassion
[49:43] of god
[49:45] you will do what god will commands you
[49:49] to do
[49:50] there is only one perfection and the
[49:54] perfection in which god
[49:55] sees the perfection is
[50:09] until god perfects it
[50:13] and he perfects it by the changing of
[50:15] the body
[50:18] never confuse the two
[50:21] confounded times we work so
[50:24] hard
[51:06] he
[51:34] who you are i have a message this
[51:38] morning
[51:40] which is somewhat part 2.
[51:43] of the perfect compassion of his will
[51:47] but i like to uh entitle this message
[51:52] of his season
[51:56] hallelujah and when god
[51:59] gave me this message a countryman there
[52:02] were so many thoughts
[52:04] in my mind and i
[52:07] didn't know which way to start with it
[52:11] but then the lord showed me before the
[52:14] fall
[52:16] caprila
[52:30] the lives of adam and eve
[52:33] but he also gave them a free moral agent
[52:40] a free moral will the
[52:43] liberal they
[52:51] [Music]
[52:59] eve so much ever till he joined himself
[53:02] to her
[53:05] in order to save her poop
[53:08] hallelujah and i thought about the
[53:11] second half egypt
[53:32] [Music]
[53:38] it's because of who you are
[53:52] hallelujah we are in a season
[53:55] and sometimes season we call it his
[53:57] season
[53:59] and brother branham is going to explain
[54:01] that to us in just a moment
[54:04] but i like to say it like this we have
[54:06] come through
[54:07] seven church ages are different
[54:11] and we have had seven messengers
[54:15] hallelujah and you can actually take
[54:18] this thought
[54:19] if we point from genesis to revelation
[54:22] do you need an apocalypse
[54:23] how that the church was on fire at one
[54:25] point
[54:27] and then they became the syrian at
[54:30] another point
[54:32] and god had revived him all over again
[54:50] two seasons and the caterpillar they're
[54:54] all
[54:54] demonic powers they have always been
[54:57] eaten away from the church
[55:00] hallelujah now understand this
[55:03] these demonic powers
[55:31] we understand that the rapture is soon
[55:34] to take place
[55:36] i'm so glad you're all happy this
[55:37] morning
[55:40] well if you ain't got the joy i got the
[55:42] joy

[55:47] it's your home
[55:48] so you won't have any excuse i'm not
[55:51] understanding what i'm saying but anyway
[55:55] we realized that god has done a great
[55:59] work
[56:00] did you have been
[56:32] you see we are not the first to come in
[56:37] we're actually the last on the on the
[56:39] books
[56:41] and men continue to make the same
[56:43] mistakes
[56:46] because they don't study they don't read
[56:49] you know they don't pray and they fail
[56:52] to see that history
[56:55] please repeat itself repeat hallelujah
[56:59] if israel see israel would have
[57:02] understood
[57:04] that the demons that they had in egypt
[57:07] was going to follow them hallelujah
[57:13] [Music]
[57:38] many of them saw the prophet
[57:45] many of them had a pill of fire
[57:49] and many of them were lost hello even
[57:54] in jesus day the same
[57:57] spirit had continued even though they
[58:01] had gone
[58:01] israel had been locked up into babylon
[58:04] memphis
[58:05] hallelujah even
[58:13] they didn't leave the spirits there you
[58:16] know they see this project
[58:17] their ancestors gave them hallelujah

[58:33] abraham and he rejoiced in
[58:57] and god was nowhere to be seen
[59:00] hallelujah

[59:15] and that is the spirit of god and the
[59:17] spirit of the devil

[1:02:04] that camera can turn turn over this way
[1:02:08] we fail to see now we've got just
[1:02:10] something here because

[1:02:12] happening
[1:02:15] but with those seven thunders out of
[1:02:16] their voices
[1:02:18] available
[1:02:32] because
[1:02:45] what we fail to see

[1:04:10] baptisms
[1:04:23] we're dealing with the very
[1:04:37] amen because you gotta understand that
[1:04:40] when eve

[1:06:36] listen i know what some of y'all you
[1:06:38] know the truth of the matter is
[1:06:40] the secret the election is election
[1:06:43] it is not based upon
[1:06:59] no you may not even uh be able to
[1:07:00] explain it
[1:07:03] because in reality god cannot be
[1:07:06] explained
[1:07:08] hallelujah but that if you have the seed
[1:07:12] of god
[1:07:14] on the inside of you the word of god
[1:07:17] began
[1:07:18] you you say amen amen to every word of
[1:07:22] god whether you understand it or not you
[1:07:25] still
[1:07:26] knew
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:54] it was
[1:08:08] jesus said
[1:08:22] hallelujah
[1:08:51] but no one else could know it but him
[1:08:55] so when you hear hello guys flatter you
[1:09:00] telling theirs they're john
[1:09:03] oh this is on the show
[1:09:18] he has
[1:09:58] their relationship with god
[1:10:14] so many people that come to church here
[1:10:16] that you know you make me feel
[1:10:18] like it's just a ritual
[1:10:23] it's your religion
[1:10:26] you come because of allah
[1:10:30] but if that be the case you really need
[1:10:32] an experience from god
[1:10:37] you see because right now god is
[1:10:40] making a bride he's really
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:23] he's forming a bride
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:49] it ain't about the man who could bring
[1:11:50] the message
[1:11:52] so well actually
[1:12:06] um
[1:12:21] and desire to eat capacity
[1:12:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:28] is that all right
[1:12:31] but he knowed me but every
[1:12:35] perfect overcomer that's good receives a
[1:12:38] new name
[1:12:41] oh no but a lot of people we missed that
[1:12:46] because you know what the devil tells
[1:12:47] you because he's the same person
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] is that all right sorry did you notice
[1:14:12] jacob
[1:14:30] i'ma say something you're going to call
[1:14:31] you're going to go look it up but you
[1:14:32] understand that the holy ghost is a
[1:14:34] temporary gift
[1:14:35] exclusively
[1:14:40] why is that there's something else
[1:14:43] greater comes
[1:14:43] yeah there's something greater than
[1:14:46] something greater
[1:14:49] can something greater the truth you know
[1:14:51] what's greater
[1:14:53] god himself remember hallelujah
[1:14:57] you understand me it ain't
[1:15:00] it ain't just like a russian mighty win
[1:15:02] anymore
[1:15:04] you know what the holy ghost is doing
[1:15:06] it's birthing you into his own genetics
[1:15:08] you performed as a
[1:15:10] opportunity into his own
[1:15:13] genetics
[1:15:16] that's why so many people can have the
[1:15:19] holy ghost
[1:15:20] all their life
[1:15:37] how can the pentecostals have the holy
[1:15:39] ghost
[1:15:45] because they refuse their headshots
[1:15:50] they refuse
[1:16:18] what's right
[1:16:31] the hatred out of your life
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:17:00] it is painful
[1:17:03] you've got to get the thorns out of your
[1:17:06] flesh
[1:17:09] and the holy ghost is the only one
[1:17:13] is that right that's right
[1:17:16] they come to justification
[1:17:19] they come through sanctification and
[1:17:22] when they went
[1:17:23] into the promised land
[1:17:28] refused
[1:17:43] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:17:53] caleb joshua and caleb
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:19] right
[1:18:22] and everybody that played around when
[1:18:24] moses was gone
[1:18:30] amen that's your bible
[1:18:36] you love the lord
[1:18:50] but when he wrestled with the lord all
[1:18:52] night long
[1:19:30] because the pentecostal churches they
[1:19:32] had the holy ghost
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:25] he said look at the people in the
[1:20:26] catholic church
[1:20:29] they go there and they visit peter
[1:20:32] yvonne
[1:20:33] they don't kiss the p peter's foot so
[1:20:35] much they had to replace his toes so
[1:20:36] many times
[1:20:42] and we do the same thing in the physique
[1:20:58] we're doing the same
[1:21:11] but so many of us just like those
[1:21:15] pharisees and sadducees
[1:21:21] jesus christ he's standing right there
[1:21:23] and he said except you believe that i am
[1:21:25] he
[1:21:26] is
[1:21:38] because i know that if some of us are
[1:21:40] not delivered from that spirit
[1:21:43] see yes
[1:21:51] i'm exalting jesus christ and no devil
[1:21:54] likes
[1:22:22] i'll reveal my new name to him
[1:22:26] and everywhere every overcomer
[1:22:29] among such as them that if them leaders
[1:22:33] and so forth
[1:22:34] now all the children of israel didn't
[1:22:36] get their names changed
[1:22:40] but those high leaders may see overcome
[1:22:44] they have received a new name
[1:23:19] think and remember only the high priest
[1:23:22] could go into the veil
[1:23:28] a hidden manner
[1:23:32] hallelujah
[1:23:46] do we
[1:24:13] has to be restored
[1:24:25] oh that they had eaten up it had to be
[1:24:28] restored
[1:24:46] the devil went right to the root
[1:24:53] but in the mystery man don't think
[1:24:56] grace
[1:25:23] i'm so glad this is scene just use the
[1:25:25] words that's one thing i love about
[1:25:27] jesus
[1:25:29] he doesn't look at the outward you know
[1:25:32] they got the power but he looked
[1:25:33] at the heart hallelujah
[1:25:36] jesus said one time jesus

[1:27:20] yourself
[1:27:22] of who you are you don't read your bible
[1:27:26] you don't pray even god can talk to you
[1:27:30] so that god can talk to you you know
[1:27:32] sometimes we don't read our bible so god
[1:27:34] put you on your knees so he can talk to
[1:27:36] you that's how they do for fun
[1:27:37] all he's going to tell you is the things
[1:27:38] that are already in your body

[1:27:45] way or the other

[1:28:34] now brother branham is not just throwing
[1:28:36] things out in the end
[1:28:39] but what he's saying here
[1:29:09] it wasn't the man with the big belt
[1:29:11] buckles
[1:29:13] so hallelujah
[1:29:16] it wasn't the man with the cowboy hat
[1:29:21] we are supposed to be shaped
[1:29:51] that the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:29:54] praying and shall come some day
[1:29:56] even though the head stones christ jesus
[1:29:58] christ

[1:30:52] coming of jesus christ absolutely
[1:30:58] but one thing i love about jesus
[1:31:12] hallelujah make me want to shout out
[1:31:17] because you know what it was better than
[1:31:21] what
[1:31:22] rebecca god
[1:31:26] rebecca didn't know what he looked like
[1:31:47] and that's what we ought to be designing
[1:31:49] the very word of god
[1:31:56] loving the unlovable sickness
[1:31:59] somebody helped me so what
[1:32:07] and he goes on to say and he continues
[1:32:09] and shall come
[1:32:10] someday the
[1:32:58] it's greater than just blue concord
[1:33:02] having the toys to play with the
[1:33:05] the joy
[1:33:48] hallelujah you know what
[1:33:51] i love the lord james because oftentimes
[1:33:55] he put us through
[1:33:56] things that that's good sometimes can be
[1:33:58] quite embarrassing
[1:34:02] you know
[1:34:15] when you're supposed to be dead
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:21] pride luxury and pride comes before
[1:34:25] fall you understand me
[1:34:29] what we don't understand excluding
[1:34:42] and until you come to a place you love
[1:34:44] god more than you love
[1:34:46] the things you are playing with
[1:34:49] hello oh
[1:34:52] god deliver me from the lust of the
[1:34:55] flesh
[1:34:57] until you come to a place where you hate
[1:34:59] it
[1:35:05] we've got so many people in the message
[1:35:26] hello y'all getting quiet even though i
[1:35:29] was like
[1:35:30] it's true
[1:35:33] we got brothers
[1:35:37] think that god is just going to say oh
[1:35:39] i'm sorry oh i'm sorry
[1:36:08] i was trying to save that word from them
[1:36:11] but i knew that one in french whatever
[1:36:14] but my point is you gotta hate it
[1:36:20] you got to expose it would it be exposed
[1:37:16] you want grace
[1:37:44] but just pretend you had a movie looking
[1:37:46] at the tv
[1:37:48] just going with that
[1:37:53] and shall come someday
[1:37:56] i can feel the pressure of wanting to
[1:37:58] leave the headstone
[1:38:27] as it gets closer so sentence
[1:39:19] [Applause]
[1:39:54] in the season that the prophet is

[1:42:25] until adoption of children
[1:42:29] by jesus christ
[1:42:36] that would happen right now along the
[1:42:40] road
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:35] in just a moment
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:32] in the
[1:44:45] we all died
[1:45:27] and by everything done to it
[1:45:31] right and what happened he cannot die
[1:45:34] but he will not die
[1:45:39] in him word of god
[1:46:34] is it free it's going to prevail what
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:52] see we got to be careful that we don't
[1:46:56] allow satan to replace the natural
[1:46:59] things
[1:47:02] oh excuse me replacing the spiritual
[1:47:05] things
[1:47:06] complacency
[1:47:21] it is free nothing imprisons god
[1:47:26] hallelujah is that right the system was
[1:47:28] so tight the system is when jesus came
[1:47:50] all the time hallelujah
[1:47:53] amen is that right and how could jesus
[1:47:57] jesus kill a man on the sabbath day
[1:48:01] but you see before you others were being
[1:48:04] stoned for those reasons
[1:48:08] oh but where the spirit of the lord is
[1:48:27] he knew he had a character
[1:49:12] has come to nonsense nonsense and it did
[1:49:16] in that day
[1:49:17] and it will in this day
[1:49:21] bring us back to god
