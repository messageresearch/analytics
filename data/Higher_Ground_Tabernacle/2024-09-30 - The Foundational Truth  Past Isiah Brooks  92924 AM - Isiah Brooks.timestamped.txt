[1:08:42] children
[1:08:44] living that's such a
[1:08:47] blessing amen so you know one thing my
[1:08:51] mother was good
[1:08:53] at we we were we were born very
[1:08:57] poor and uh my father left my my
[1:09:02] mom with nine
[1:09:05] children single mom raising nine
[1:09:10] children I only would see my mother
[1:09:13] sometimes on the weekend
[1:09:16] that cuz she worked very hard she was
[1:09:21] not
[1:09:22] educated so she had to do a lot of Labor
[1:09:27] work but one thing that my mother did
[1:09:32] do she showed every last one of her
[1:09:36] children how much she loved
[1:09:39] them and when my mom
[1:09:42] died not one of my
[1:09:45] siblings could have ever accused
[1:09:48] her for not loving
[1:09:51] them and I pray that God gives me that
[1:09:54] kind of a record
[1:09:56] that if the Lord would take me at any
[1:09:59] time my
[1:10:00] children would know that how I love
[1:10:04] them so much so I would die for them
[1:10:08] readily whether they right or
[1:10:13] wrong because that's what my god did for
[1:10:17] me and that while I was yet a
[1:10:20] sinner Christ died for
[1:10:24] me as we We
[1:10:31] Stand First
[1:10:38] Corinthians the third
[1:10:42] chapter then we'll go from 1 Corinthians
[1:10:45] to St John
[1:10:51] 4 reading from the 10th verse
[1:10:57] according to the grace of
[1:10:59] God which is given unto me as a wise
[1:11:03] master
[1:11:05] builder I have laid the
[1:11:08] foundation and another build it
[1:11:11] thereon but every man take heed how he
[1:11:15] built it thereon
[1:11:27] for other foundations can no man lay
[1:11:31] than that is laid that's right which is
[1:11:34] Jesus
[1:11:39] Christ St John
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:52] 4 and seven
[1:11:59] there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[1:12:04] water listen to this and Jesus saith
[1:12:08] unto her give me to
[1:12:17] drink I never saw her like I see it
[1:12:23] now he asked
[1:12:26] her to give him a
[1:12:32] drink same chapter let's drop down to
[1:12:34] the 14th
[1:12:38] verse but whosoever
[1:12:41] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[1:12:44] him shall never
[1:12:46] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:12:49] him shall be in him a wh of water
[1:12:52] springing up into eternal
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:04] life the woman saith unto him sir give
[1:13:08] me this water that I thirst not neither
[1:13:13] come hether to
[1:13:21] draw Hallelujah
[1:13:24] hallu let us
[1:13:26] pray our gracious father God we come
[1:13:29] before
[1:13:32] you as humbly as we know
[1:13:36] how there's no hiding
[1:13:39] place you know how going
[1:13:43] forth and our coming in you know our
[1:13:47] thoughts are far off
[1:13:50] Hallelujah glory to God the only hiding
[1:13:54] place we find
[1:13:56] from your righteous
[1:13:59] judgment Hallelujah is
[1:14:03] within your dear son Jesus
[1:14:07] Christ father we pray this
[1:14:11] morning that you bless each and every
[1:14:13] one of
[1:14:15] us give us this grace that
[1:14:18] we
[1:14:20] need to make a
[1:14:23] 100 we realize
[1:14:25] that everything is forming
[1:14:29] into a a great uh
[1:14:34] Machinery but all of these things are
[1:14:36] being done for your little
[1:14:40] bride and you said fear not little
[1:14:44] bride it is your father's good
[1:14:47] pleasure to give you the
[1:14:50] kingdom Lord we're resting on
[1:14:53] that we believe believe
[1:14:56] that and we receive
[1:14:59] that bless this
[1:15:02] congregation people who you purchased by
[1:15:04] your
[1:15:06] blood in your name Jesus Christ we
[1:15:10] pray amen amen you may be
[1:15:16] seated when I read the
[1:15:21] message I'm always
[1:15:23] excited something always get my
[1:15:28] attention right now I I just feel like
[1:15:30] flying
[1:15:33] away honestly I feel so
[1:15:35] good yesterday I was very tired the day
[1:15:39] before then I was
[1:15:41] tired but Prayer Changes
[1:15:45] Things I
[1:15:47] think through this
[1:15:50] journey that we're all
[1:15:53] taking we learn as we
[1:15:57] go and in our learning we progress to
[1:16:01] what we call
[1:16:06] maturity I don't know whether everybody
[1:16:10] understand uh the mighty revelation of
[1:16:13] this
[1:16:14] message because we've had so many
[1:16:17] different
[1:16:19] angles and so much
[1:16:22] teachings when in simp
[1:16:25] in
[1:16:27] Simplicity is God giving his people
[1:16:33] Grace this Capstone
[1:16:37] Revelation is greater than
[1:16:40] all
[1:16:43] Revelations because it is the unveiling
[1:16:46] of
[1:16:48] God male and
[1:16:51] female hallelujah hallelujah one thing I
[1:16:56] know if you really take this message
[1:17:03] seriously you will always want more of
[1:17:09] him and the more you
[1:17:12] get the more you
[1:17:16] want my subject this morning will
[1:17:20] be the foundational truth
[1:17:26] I love this because not only was
[1:17:30] Jesus the
[1:17:33] Cornerstone but the same
[1:17:36] Cornerstone became the
[1:17:40] headstone and to me that
[1:17:43] is such a
[1:17:45] complete
[1:17:47] idea that God is the
[1:17:51] beginning and he is the
[1:17:53] ending he is the
[1:17:56] first and he is the
[1:17:59] last
[1:18:01] now when we talk about a
[1:18:05] foundation it is a
[1:18:08] basis or
[1:18:11] groundwork of
[1:18:13] anything the moral Foundation of both
[1:18:19] society and
[1:18:21] religion is that right the natural or
[1:18:25] prepared ground or
[1:18:28] base on which structures
[1:18:33] rest y'all get that
[1:18:35] word it it rests on the
[1:18:40] foundation no matter how
[1:18:43] fabulous a
[1:18:45] house is
[1:18:48] built it is no
[1:18:51] stronger than the foundation
[1:18:55] of which it's been
[1:18:57] built if the foundation is no
[1:19:01] good the house will
[1:19:05] crumble I know what I'm talking
[1:19:08] about so we must
[1:19:11] understand there's only one
[1:19:15] foundation and that Foundation is Jesus
[1:19:21] Christ I'm saying this
[1:19:26] because in order to go
[1:19:28] forward in this message you must
[1:19:33] understand that you are beyond the seven
[1:19:36] Church
[1:19:39] ages I didn't say it was over I said
[1:19:43] you're
[1:19:44] beyond because God in this
[1:19:48] message took us out of
[1:19:53] Lea and placed us into what we call the
[1:19:56] bride
[1:19:59] age I love
[1:20:02] this because our
[1:20:04] covenant is the greatest Covenant ever
[1:20:08] given to
[1:20:10] mankind hallu Hallelujah
[1:20:14] absolutely now the thing that I
[1:20:17] love is because I read the
[1:20:20] scripture in
[1:20:22] John where the Samaritan
[1:20:25] woman and we know who she is she's well
[1:20:30] known as a woman who had many
[1:20:34] husbands Hallelujah but
[1:20:37] Jesus never looked at her
[1:20:42] condition y'all hear what I'm
[1:20:44] saying because before the foundation of
[1:20:47] the
[1:20:49] world he knew
[1:20:51] her can I say it like this
[1:20:55] there is no
[1:20:57] trap that Satan can put the seed of God
[1:21:02] in that God can't get them out
[1:21:05] of oh my
[1:21:07] God y'all better hear what I'm
[1:21:10] saying because I want you
[1:21:13] recognize the grace of
[1:21:17] God brother bam said God works on both
[1:21:21] ends Hallelujah but here was this woman
[1:21:26] going out to get
[1:21:28] water and the Lord has already talked
[1:21:31] and spoke to
[1:21:33] Jesus and say go stand by the
[1:21:37] well
[1:21:39] Hallelujah I got somebody I want you to
[1:21:41] talk
[1:21:43] to
[1:21:45] Hallelujah now Jesus standing by the
[1:21:49] well you know why I'm preaching this cuz
[1:21:52] I'm tired of legalism
[1:21:55] I'm tired of the
[1:21:57] legalist if you continue as a
[1:22:01] legalist in hell will you lift up your
[1:22:06] eyes that's pretty strong isn't it so
[1:22:09] let me say it again if you continue as a
[1:22:14] legalist in hell you lift up your
[1:22:19] eyes if the Pharisees couldn't make it
[1:22:24] neither will you and the Bible says
[1:22:29] accept your
[1:22:31] righteousness exce the righteousness of
[1:22:34] the
[1:22:34] legalist of the
[1:22:37] Pharisees Hallelujah you have no part of
[1:22:42] me I think I got everybody's
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:48] attention if God had been a
[1:22:51] legalist he never would have talked with
[1:22:53] that woman
[1:22:55] don't look at me like y'all
[1:22:57] innocent what you didn't do in the
[1:22:59] natural you did it in the
[1:23:03] spiritual Hallelujah we living in what
[1:23:07] we call a
[1:23:09] generation God said it as adulterous
[1:23:14] generation oh y'all don't like that
[1:23:17] right but here Jesus said to this woman
[1:23:22] and y'all know the conversation
[1:23:25] but think about it if this woman was so
[1:23:28] defiled if she was so wicked how can she
[1:23:32] give
[1:23:34] Jesus a drink of
[1:23:37] water it was against all
[1:23:40] Customs it was against all the
[1:23:44] laws
[1:23:45] Hallelujah but here was
[1:23:48] Jesus y'all either come to worship God
[1:23:52] and if you don't come if you're not here
[1:23:53] to worship God you
[1:23:56] we come to worship God this
[1:23:59] morning I don't need no
[1:24:03] hindrances you understand me so let's
[1:24:06] move
[1:24:08] on and his
[1:24:10] disciples as brother BR said was
[1:24:13] standing in the bush standing somewhere
[1:24:16] watching him and Discerning whether the
[1:24:19] word is
[1:24:22] right like some of you this morning
[1:24:24] morning already Discerning whether the
[1:24:26] word is
[1:24:28] Right Hallelujah but I'm going to bring
[1:24:30] it this
[1:24:31] morning because we need to know that the
[1:24:35] grace of God
[1:24:38] continues it doesn't
[1:24:43] stop hallelujah hallelujah give me a
[1:24:46] drink of
[1:24:48] water then the woman says you you asking
[1:24:52] me Hallelujah
[1:24:55] it's not a good thing for a Jew to have
[1:24:58] fellowship with a
[1:25:02] Samaritan
[1:25:04] Lord I'm not going to go this is just a
[1:25:06] beginning of what I'm trying to
[1:25:08] say see
[1:25:10] because whether you know it or not the
[1:25:13] scripture doesn't say
[1:25:15] it but there was a deep
[1:25:18] call in that
[1:25:21] woman and that deep call
[1:25:25] got the attention of God
[1:25:28] Almighty when nobody else
[1:25:31] knew that this woman was
[1:25:34] thirsty not for the natural
[1:25:38] water she was thirsting for the living
[1:25:42] water and there was only one person who
[1:25:45] could give that to her and that was
[1:25:48] Jesus Christ
[1:25:51] himself what a Time impeccable
[1:25:55] timing hallelujah hallelujah perfect in
[1:25:59] itself perfect in
[1:26:02] itself Hallelujah that God would take
[1:26:07] somebody like
[1:26:09] me and cause that
[1:26:12] person to go to the well I don't know
[1:26:15] about you I had tried every religion
[1:26:19] there
[1:26:20] was but I still was
[1:26:23] thirsty Hallelujah there was something
[1:26:26] crying out on on the inside of me
[1:26:29] there's got to be
[1:26:32] more that
[1:26:34] religion oh come on somebody even
[1:26:37] brother brandom says that that woman had
[1:26:41] a greater teaching than the Pharisees
[1:26:44] had Hallelujah because she was able to
[1:26:49] recognize the
[1:26:52] Messiah when they they could not
[1:26:55] recognize the
[1:26:57] Messiah Hallelujah hallu go get your
[1:27:01] husband she said I have
[1:27:03] not his disciple says oh oh he looked
[1:27:07] like he going missed this one but then
[1:27:10] Jesus
[1:27:12] replied you had five and the one that
[1:27:15] you have is not yours come on somebody
[1:27:19] maybe you've never been a
[1:27:21] Methodist maybe you've never been a
[1:27:23] Baptist
[1:27:24] maybe you've never been a
[1:27:26] Pentecostal maybe you've never been a
[1:27:28] Catholic but I've had all of them as my
[1:27:32] husband Hallelujah and I didn't realize
[1:27:36] Hallelujah that I have been married to a
[1:27:40] sister somebody help me here but here
[1:27:43] Jesus is introducing a new
[1:27:47] doctrine Hallelujah a new
[1:27:51] doctrine something that's greater than
[1:27:53] the Baptist
[1:27:54] one that's greater than the Methodist
[1:27:56] one that's greater than the Catholic one
[1:27:59] that's greater than all denominations
[1:28:01] Hallelujah he says
[1:28:04] listen
[1:28:05] listen she said my my my my my
[1:28:10] background
[1:28:12] is we worshiped God on this
[1:28:15] mountain and then Jesus said you don't
[1:28:19] even know what you
[1:28:22] worshiping yes that that's how it is
[1:28:25] when you in a system you don't know what
[1:28:27] your worship
[1:28:29] be Hallelujah but he said my father
[1:28:33] seeketh those who will worship me or
[1:28:38] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:28:42] truth y'all hear what I'm saying I can
[1:28:45] be in a cow
[1:28:46] pastor and worship
[1:28:49] God I can be in a bank and worship God
[1:28:54] I can be in prison and worship God
[1:28:58] hallelujah I have no
[1:29:01] boundaries when it comes to worshiping
[1:29:04] God come on somebody if a
[1:29:08] place it it was
[1:29:11] significant for the worshiping of
[1:29:15] God we will be
[1:29:17] lost cuz where would this place
[1:29:20] be Hallelujah but God chose a
[1:29:26] body let me move
[1:29:28] on see when there's a deep calling to
[1:29:31] the
[1:29:32] Deep there is one to
[1:29:36] respond the Bible said he that cometh to
[1:29:39] God must first believe that he is God
[1:29:44] and that he's a reward of them that
[1:29:45] diligently seek
[1:29:47] him you can't even worship God if you
[1:29:49] don't believe he's God you can't have
[1:29:52] faith if you don't believe he's God
[1:29:56] hallelujah and Jesus Christ is a
[1:30:00] revelation not to a
[1:30:03] group but to
[1:30:05] individuals this is why you see some
[1:30:07] people really
[1:30:09] excited they can't help themselves
[1:30:13] Hallelujah because they've had that well
[1:30:17] experience somebody help me here they
[1:30:20] met a man who said to them give you
[1:30:26] Waters Everlasting
[1:30:29] Waters springing up into eternal life
[1:30:34] come on somebody that means my joy does
[1:30:39] not have a lid on it I don't have a lid
[1:30:43] on my joy Hallelujah my life does not
[1:30:48] have a lid on it the more comes the more
[1:30:53] that goes
[1:30:54] brings on more Hallelujah more God more
[1:31:00] God more power more strength more faith
[1:31:05] more
[1:31:09] everything hallelujah
[1:31:12] hallelujah the
[1:31:14] word may flesh is who he
[1:31:19] is he Jesus Christ was to clothe the
[1:31:23] Elohim
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:26] he who was before there ever was a
[1:31:30] beginning Hallelujah my God is I don't
[1:31:34] know you understand what I'm saying
[1:31:36] that's my
[1:31:38] Foundation That's My
[1:31:40] Capstone that's my
[1:31:43] finisher y'all understand me he spoke
[1:31:47] time into
[1:31:49] existence so time is under his authority
[1:31:54] and y'all don't believe me huh Joshua
[1:31:57] said Sun stand
[1:32:00] still
[1:32:02] Hallelujah he was a Son of God but the
[1:32:06] Son of God had
[1:32:07] power cuz that power and authority was
[1:32:10] given to
[1:32:12] him is that right but the Bible said
[1:32:15] after which the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:32:17] you you shall receive
[1:32:21] power come on somebody
[1:32:24] this is not a whole soul this is a no
[1:32:28] soul
[1:32:31] Hallelujah before there was
[1:32:34] nothing and we can't even Envision
[1:32:37] Envision
[1:32:38] nothing before he was before there was
[1:32:41] nothing do you know God created
[1:32:47] nothing it wasn't nothing than
[1:32:51] God because if it was nothing before God
[1:32:55] then nothing would have been
[1:32:57] God hallelujah but it was God before
[1:33:02] there ever was
[1:33:04] nothing you say well what wait wait wait
[1:33:06] a minute brother so that means that God
[1:33:10] is the controller of
[1:33:13] nothing is that right that little woman
[1:33:16] who had just a few a little bit of
[1:33:19] meal and a little bit of oil
[1:33:24] she said if when we eat
[1:33:25] this we won't have
[1:33:29] nothing Hallelujah but the God who
[1:33:33] created
[1:33:35] nothing say if you would serve me
[1:33:39] first your nothing will become
[1:33:42] something and it will never run
[1:33:45] out Hallelujah that's right you might
[1:33:50] come to this message as a Christian
[1:33:53] Hallelujah me you may not have nothing
[1:33:57] but you got a trust in the god that can
[1:34:00] take nothing and bring it into
[1:34:03] something Hallelujah but how I'm going
[1:34:06] to do this brother Brooks you got to
[1:34:09] give him first you make him first and
[1:34:13] God will turn your nothing into
[1:34:19] something
[1:34:21] Hallelujah yes sir he's still the
[1:34:26] Creator he is the inexhaustible founding
[1:34:30] of
[1:34:31] Life Hallelujah and we think we know
[1:34:34] what life
[1:34:36] is what we experience here is not life
[1:34:40] it's
[1:34:40] perversion it's a perversion of Life
[1:34:44] what we got on the inside is life y'all
[1:34:47] hear what I'm saying that's real life
[1:34:51] Hallelujah and this life on the
[1:34:55] inside is inexhaustable

[1:35:01] mean without
[1:35:03] water you can't
[1:35:06] live wo somebody help me here without
[1:35:10] water you can't
[1:35:12] live and that woman Jesus
[1:35:16] said see that's the problem we we come
[1:35:19] to Jesus we want to say Lord what could
[1:35:22] you do for me
[1:35:25] and Jesus is saying what can you do for
[1:35:28] me it ain't what God God done did
[1:35:31] all he's done it all now is our time to
[1:35:36] serve
[1:35:37] him
[1:35:39] hallelujah oh glory is that right
[1:35:42] remember when when Mary received of
[1:35:45] God she never left his

[1:37:26] it we can't it's
[1:37:29] Eternal it has no beginning it has no
[1:37:33] ending hallelujah look what the prophet
[1:37:36] of God is saying what was the Holy Ghost

[1:37:45] notice now what taking
[1:37:49] place God pouring himself into them
[1:37:55] now the church has got to be to a
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:00] place from
[1:38:03] Luther
[1:38:04] Wesley Wesley and the Revival is on the
[1:38:09] Pentecostal and now into this age listen
[1:38:14] to what he says and now into this
[1:38:17] age that we're coming

[1:38:27] it you understand me more of it we got
[1:38:32] to go
[1:38:33] beyond the Baptist the Methodist the
[1:38:37] Pentecostals we got to go beyond that
[1:38:41] hallelujah it's got to be
[1:38:43] more and if you hunger and thirst for
[1:38:48] righteousness God said you will be
[1:38:52] filled
[1:38:54] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah when the
[1:38:58] Methodist got
[1:39:00] Sanctified that was the work of the Holy
[1:39:03] Spirit see it was a part of the Holy
[1:39:06] Spirit they without us are not made
[1:39:10] perfect says the scripture yall
[1:39:13] understand what he said the the
[1:39:16] Methodist can't be made perfect Without
[1:39:21] You Without You
[1:39:24] because you received the
[1:39:25] Capstone you received the the top of the
[1:39:29] pyramid now I'm coming to this because
[1:39:32] I'm going to tell you something when you
[1:39:34] really catch a hold of real Grace you
[1:39:38] stop judging each other in the wrong
[1:39:41] way Hallelujah for you for you this
[1:39:45] morning who's going to lay charge to
[1:39:49] God's elect it is God who justifies
[1:39:54] somebody help me
[1:39:55] here God who
[1:40:01] justifies you said well I don't know
[1:40:03] about let me tell you something brother
[1:40:06] bam said Jacob looked worse than
[1:40:10] Esau Hallelujah but which was the real
[1:40:15] seed y'all hear me y'all better hear
[1:40:17] what I'm
[1:40:18] saying because whether you realize it or
[1:40:21] not it's not your behavior
[1:40:24] it's whether the seed of God is in
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:29] you Hallelujah I'm so tired that's why
[1:40:33] we're in bondage we're so in bondage
[1:40:37] because we can't see the grace of
[1:40:42] God we're selfish with it oh yeah God
[1:40:46] gives me
[1:40:47] Grace but I don't know about sister so
[1:40:49] and so I don't know about brother so and
[1:40:52] so
[1:40:54] Hallelujah but the Bible said you make
[1:40:56] your
[1:40:57] calling an election sure don't worry
[1:41:01] about your neighbor you make your
[1:41:04] calling an election
[1:41:06] sure let me move
[1:41:09] on right he says now God as a light has
[1:41:14] began to shine in the last
[1:41:17] days listen closely he is expecting us
[1:41:23] great thing from
[1:41:25] us because where there is much giving
[1:41:33] given there is much
[1:41:35] required so he's going to require much
[1:41:39] more of
[1:41:41] us than he did the
[1:41:43] Lutheran or the
[1:41:45] methodists because we walk in a greater
[1:41:49] light with a greater power
[1:41:53] with a greater
[1:41:55] witness than they had so let me explain
[1:41:58] some of your conditions you are like
[1:42:01] many of us are like Johnny
[1:42:04] Crow Hallelujah you have been set
[1:42:08] free and you don't know
[1:42:11] it you still walking around in
[1:42:15] circles doing the same things you've
[1:42:17] always
[1:42:19] done thinking that God power is not
[1:42:22] powerful enough to free you but I'm
[1:42:25] going tell you something God freed me
[1:42:29] before the foundation of the
[1:42:31] world hallelujah hallelujah just the
[1:42:34] other day when brother
[1:42:36] Danny from Zimbabwe was preaching and
[1:42:41] you don't have to believe this but a
[1:42:43] wind came by
[1:42:44] me and it said to me receive your
[1:42:50] grace I'm like Lord I thought I received
[1:42:52] it
[1:42:54] I thought I had it but you don't know
[1:42:57] Grace until you have Grace for
[1:43:01] others Hallelujah you don't know Mercy
[1:43:05] until you have mercy for
[1:43:10] others that's scripture you know the man
[1:43:13] who couldn't have mercy from on the
[1:43:15] person who owed
[1:43:16] him was called a wicked servant and was
[1:43:20] thrown in
[1:43:22] jail not having
[1:43:27] Mercy Mercy is when you
[1:43:30] caught you done you've done
[1:43:32] wrong and you're
[1:43:34] caught it's like when the police catch
[1:43:36] you speeding
[1:43:38] speed and you say Have
[1:43:41] Mercy he say I'll let you go this time
[1:43:44] that's
[1:43:45] Mercy Hallelujah but Grace is
[1:43:50] unmerited y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:43:53] didn't do nothing you did
[1:43:55] wrong but God uh don't impute it to
[1:44:03] you we got to push
[1:44:05] forward y'all understand when I'm where
[1:44:07] I'm going I'm talking about the
[1:44:10] foundation if the foundation is solid
[1:44:13] the house is
[1:44:15] solid let the winds come let the rains
[1:44:18] come let them beat upon the house let
[1:44:21] the flood come you see I'm not saved
[1:44:24] because of
[1:44:27] you I'm saved because of
[1:44:30] him no church saves
[1:44:33] me so if everybody in this church go
[1:44:38] bad I'm still
[1:44:40] saved you understand me it was the blood
[1:44:44] of Jesus Christ it is a grace of
[1:44:48] God and I know one thing we've got a lot
[1:44:52] of life
[1:44:54] lots a lot of
[1:44:57] lots lot
[1:44:59] lot the person lot the
[1:45:05] lot Hallelujah and what do you mean by
[1:45:09] that we all want to take the easy
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:15] road is that right but Abraham took the
[1:45:18] rough
[1:45:21] road come on somebody
[1:45:24] and because lot took the easy
[1:45:28] Road he produced
[1:45:31] Mo Hallelujah and Moab produced
[1:45:38] Goliath did y'all hear what I'm
[1:45:44] saying but
[1:45:48] Abraham wo he produced Jesus Christ
[1:45:52] Jesus Christ
[1:45:54] amen let's move
[1:45:57] on how can we describe
[1:46:01] Christ there's no
[1:46:04] words in the
[1:46:06] English language
[1:46:08] French German whatever there's no words
[1:46:12] to describe
[1:46:14] him I just believe that when we get to
[1:46:18] heaven we all receive a better language
[1:46:23] amen something that's going to describe
[1:46:25] him
[1:46:27] perfectly turn with me to Revelation
[1:46:31] 81 you love the Lord I'm people if we
[1:46:35] can see this
[1:46:36] thing I can't give you Revelation but I
[1:46:39] can preach it in the way that you can
[1:46:41] see
[1:46:43] it is it
[1:46:46] true brother brandham said there'll be
[1:46:48] many there you thought wasn't going to
[1:46:50] make it
[1:46:53] amen they're where
[1:46:55] Heaven A lot of people will be in heaven
[1:46:58] that you thought wasn't going to make
[1:47:02] it

[2:00:10] and over and over again his love never
[2:00:15] fails Hallelujah when I didn't have a

[2:00:39] times and God still blessed

[2:00:53] is that right when brother
[2:00:56] Bram wife died and he had all those
[2:01:00] deaths
[2:01:01] coming and and and and the devil told
[2:01:04] him see the Lord don't God don't love

[2:03:28] mother and your family is here to see
[2:03:31] you and Jesus said who

[2:04:18] word he he drew you with loving
[2:04:23] kindness oh come on somebody you say I

[2:04:28] brandham said when God uh drove the Jews
[2:04:32] back to their
[2:04:35] Homeland he said it was tender hand of
[2:04:40] Jehovah I don't care how I got
[2:04:44] here I got
[2:04:46] here he had to beat me a little
[2:04:50] bit but I got here
[2:04:53] you understand what I'm saying Isaiah 43
[2:04:58] 5-6 you love the
[2:05:01] Lord hallelujah
[2:05:09] hallelujah I want to emphasize
[2:05:12] this you cannot remain where you
[2:05:16] are and expect to make a rapture
[2:05:22] yall understand what I mean by that I
[2:05:24] believe in
[2:05:25] election but I also believe in
[2:05:29] inspiration and I believe that the
[2:05:31] elected vessels of God are being
[2:05:36] inspired with the time that we're living
[2:05:38] in and and and and and the time of
[2:05:43] desperation and the time of of trimming
[2:05:46] the lamps however you want to put it but
[2:05:48] something on the inside
[2:05:52] keep telling me that there is more to
[2:05:54] this
[2:05:56] message than we've
[2:05:59] seen amen amen amen yes sir and I got to
[2:06:03] have
[2:06:06] it people are barely making it as
[2:06:11] Christians and you call that this is
[2:06:14] it we can't even compete with Uzu
[2:06:18] Street and this message is greater than
[2:06:21] a
[2:06:23] y'all hear what I'm saying you can you
[2:06:25] can lay back in your easy
[2:06:28] chair but there something
[2:06:31] happening and you better ask God what it
[2:06:34] is because we're getting ready for a
[2:06:38] translation let me read this fear not
[2:06:42] for I am with thee I will bring thy seed
[2:06:46] from the
[2:06:47] East and gather thee from the West I
[2:06:51] will say to the north give up and to the
[2:06:55] South keep not back bring my sons from
[2:07:00] far and my daughters from the end of the
[2:07:04] Earth so let me say something to y'all
[2:07:07] because sometime we we judge in the
[2:07:09] wrong
[2:07:11] way Jacob had to meet
[2:07:14] Esau and because God had cast Esau away
[2:07:17] God still dealt with Esau
[2:07:22] is that right and God softened Esau's
[2:07:27] heart when it came to
[2:07:30] Jacob you understand me it wasn't
[2:07:35] Jacob who had such an evil spirit about
[2:07:39] Esau it was Esau who wanted to kill
[2:07:43] Jacob so you understand what I'm saying
[2:07:46] you going to either be Abraham seed or
[2:07:50] you're going to be the seed of
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:53] Hallelujah you're going to either take
[2:07:55] the hard
[2:07:59] way God told brother Brandon because you
[2:08:02] have chosen a harder
[2:08:03] way I've given you a huge
[2:08:06] portion hallelujah what I'm trying to
[2:08:09] say is this even if there's a lot of
[2:08:12] lots in
[2:08:14] here you still need to love and
[2:08:20] fellowship amen
[2:08:23] it was Lot who left
[2:08:26] Abraham not Abraham who left
[2:08:32] lot Hallelujah I feel like shouting
[2:08:35] right now but I got a I got a whole
[2:08:40] my fear
[2:08:42] not for I am with thee I will bring thy
[2:08:46] seed from the East and gather thee from
[2:08:50] the West
[2:08:52] I will say to the north give up and to
[2:08:55] the South keep not back bring my sons
[2:08:59] from afar and my daughters from the ends
[2:09:03] of the
[2:09:04] Earth Hallelujah now word is gone out
[2:09:08] you say well all that a word has gone
[2:09:11] out this is this is us
[2:09:14] too not just Israel but it it deals with
[2:09:17] us as well you said well that deal with
[2:09:20] the Dead
[2:09:22] the living too where the carcass is
[2:09:25] that's where the Eagles will be gathered
[2:09:28] Hallelujah I want to say this and I I
[2:09:32] didn't get to my scripture but because
[2:09:33] of time but
[2:09:36] remember in the in the beginning God
[2:09:38] gave adam a
[2:09:40] covenant is that right and that Covenant
[2:09:43] was
[2:09:45] conditional don't eat of the tree nor do
[2:09:48] you touch
[2:09:49] it Hallelujah
[2:09:52] and he told Adam be fruitful and
[2:09:56] multiply is that the truth then he came
[2:09:59] to
[2:09:59] Noah he gave Noah a covenant be fruitful
[2:10:03] and
[2:10:04] multiply Hallelujah but something
[2:10:08] changed when it came to
[2:10:11] Abraham hallelujah hallelujah God
[2:10:14] tically begins to
[2:10:17] say you are going to have seed
[2:10:21] and thy
[2:10:23] seed shall possess the Gate of their
[2:10:27] enemies Hallelujah your
[2:10:30] seed though they start off as the dust
[2:10:33] of the
[2:10:34] earth one day will become the stars of
[2:10:38] Heaven Hallelujah he did not give
[2:10:43] Abraham a covenant of
[2:10:46] conditions he gave
[2:10:48] Abraham a unconditional Covenant
[2:10:52] Hallelujah and he said your your seed
[2:10:57] sh I don't know about you but I am part
[2:11:01] of the
[2:11:02] shell hallelujah it's not by power it's
[2:11:07] not by mind but it's by my spirit say
[2:11:11] the
[2:11:13] Lord I'm almost done
[2:11:15] here can I say it like
[2:11:19] this go look
[2:11:21] cuz I can't read it because of the time
[2:11:24] but if you go in in the Book of Matthew
[2:11:25] you see it start off with Abraham the
[2:11:29] lineage of Jesus
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:32] Christ I love this gu
[2:11:36] what who was in there

[2:23:37] know if we constantly criticize each
[2:23:39] other you put bitterness in people

[2:23:53] in meekness to restore
[2:23:55] him Hallelujah God didn't say go tell

[2:24:10] inspiration to gossip about your
[2:24:12] brothers and sister

[2:24:16] devil because the Devil comes to steal
[2:24:19] kill and destroy

[2:24:24] house because a house separated can't
[2:24:30] stand you love the Lord people we got to

[2:40:22] God bless you Church um so the past two
[2:40:27] days Thursday and
[2:40:30] Friday I went to school and everything
[2:40:34] was just fine until around like
[2:40:41] two
[2:40:44] 245 uh when they said somebody came on
[2:40:46] the inter comment said that we were
[2:40:48] going in a lock down and that somebody
[2:40:50] had brought a gun to school or a weapon
[2:40:51] to
[2:40:57] school and during this whole time I
[2:41:00] didn't really understand what was
[2:41:05] happening um and after maybe 17 minutes
[2:41:09] they let us know um after like 17
[2:41:12] minutes they they let us know that um
[2:41:16] they had caught the person and
[2:41:18] everything was just fine
[2:41:24] and then Friday I went to school once
[2:41:29] again and because the officers there had
[2:41:32] caught the person but didn't get the
[2:41:34] weapon the gun whatever he
[2:41:41] had there was very few students at
[2:41:45] school and everybody that was there
[2:41:47] including me they were really scared as
[2:41:49] they were going through the Halls
[2:41:55] especially and um because of God's
