[24:45] [Applause]
[24:46] [Music]
[25:00] in the name of the Lord hallelujah God
[25:04] is good to us tonight I trusted by God's
[25:08] grace you are excited about the season
[25:12] no the people get excited about
[25:14] Christmas
[25:16] I'm excited about the resurrection we
[25:19] just celebrated last weekend Easter when
[25:23] I believe he stirs us something that
[25:24] should be within you every day because
[25:28] as we know by God's grace we do by by
[25:32] way of life we are shadows and types of
[25:36] the resurrection by dying at night we go
[25:40] to sleep and by waking up in the morning
[25:43] it's a resurrection and you and I know
[25:46] by God's raised in water these old days
[25:49] and I'm looking forward to the coming of
[25:52] the Lord where we will never have to
[25:55] return to such a mess Saders Eden he's
[26:00] really made a mess of this world and you
[26:03] know we won't have to worry about any
[26:04] pestilence any type of violence or
[26:07] sicknesses the one thing I love about
[26:11] this is that when God chose us he was
[26:13] not rolling dice he wasn't taking a
[26:17] chance and when he came to redeem us he
[26:20] did send some secondhand secretary or
[26:24] vice president or whatever attorney
[26:27] general he came himself and I thank God
[26:31] for the mercies and the grace of God I'm
[26:34] so happy to see that everybody is so
[26:36] happy tonight look at these great smiles
[26:38] on everybody I'm blessed I don't know
[26:44] about you but I'm blessed and in the
[26:47] midst of all the trials in the midst of
[26:49] all the tests amen I'm blessed
[26:53] that's the way I look at it I believe
[26:56] that if said Lazarus would would tell
[26:58] you how he felt there laying at the rich
[27:01] man's table no clothes bakes knowing his
[27:04] back yeah fighting over the food that
[27:07] drops off to the master's table but I
[27:11] don't believe he was a sad creature you
[27:14] see because when you got God on the
[27:15] inside there's a joy unspeakable there's
[27:18] something that goes on within you that
[27:20] you yourself cannot even explain it's a
[27:24] joy unspeakable and full of glory amen
[27:30] I'm trying to find a song anybody got a
[27:32] song amen oh when the saints go marching
[27:38] in or wind us a
[27:45] [Music]
[30:33] the
[30:37] [Music]
[31:33] he promised me he promised you and
[31:38] that's what we're standing on the
[31:41] promises of God you know one thing I
[31:44] know about the Lord the Lord love praise
[31:49] and I realized that praise praising the
[31:53] Lord would get you far more further
[31:58] worship and praise is where God indwells
[32:02] he inhabits the praise of his people and
[32:06] when you can praise God in the midst of
[32:09] all things you know I think about that
[32:13] woman
[32:14] and I'm not gonna preach check out a
[32:16] brother here it's gonna preach for us
[32:17] tonight but I always liken myself as
[32:21] that woman at Simon's house she didn't
[32:26] know what to say all she could do was
[32:28] crazy
[32:31] and once you begin to just worship Him
[32:34] the Lord responded every man every woman
[32:45] boy and girl about says let every breath
[32:48] that have praise the Lord let everything
[32:52] that have breath praise the Lord I
[32:56] trusted everybody has come here tonight
[33:00] in the right spirit
[33:03] because the Holy Ghost is censored and I
[33:07] wouldn't want to be the one to grieve
[33:09] him the Holy Ghost is sensitive to
[33:13] tonight tonight and and I know one thing
[33:15] for certain that when we come and we
[33:18] come in worship and in prayer God will
[33:21] answer your prayer he's just that way
[33:24] there's no way you're gonna pull on God
[33:25] and he's gonna push you away when you
[33:29] pull on God he responds to that pool he
[33:32] doesn't even care how how far you are
[33:33] away from him we have our brother Isaac
[33:37] of today tonight that's going to
[33:40] minister
[33:41] I appreciate our young brother
[33:44] I think him for the sacrifice that he's
[33:47] made to come and we just we're gonna
[33:51] pull on the gift tonight
[33:53] and I don't know about you I know
[33:55] there's some of us who are in the
[33:57] audience that and of course it's just a
[34:00] few of us but the Bible said where two
[34:03] or three are gathered in his name is
[34:06] that right
[34:07] brother Branham said it like this when
[34:10] they said to him and I just listened to
[34:12] the tape the other day today you know
[34:14] how people don't want to say Amen they
[34:17] don't want to make a lot of noise
[34:18] still friend starchiness is not of God
[34:23] but the man said how can you stand when
[34:26] they're making all that noise he said
[34:30] in response to them I really wouldn't
[34:33] know how to act if they didn't make the
[34:36] noise right
[34:38] because in heaven there's a lot of noise
[34:41] I believe in noise this is probably the
[34:46] most quiet place there is in hell
[34:49] they're screaming and hollering and in
[34:51] heavenly rejoicing in Holland I don't
[34:54] know about you but I am I'm rejoicing in
[34:56] Holland
[34:57] right now come brother we appreciate him
[35:01] once again and like I said I didn't mean
[35:03] to talk so much but I believe and I know
[35:07] I've seen God in such a mighty way in
[35:09] these last few weeks and months this
[35:11] core of our rock virus got everybody
[35:15] scared and nervous all this kind of
[35:18] stuff but Bobby tells me when you see
[35:21] this day and protein look up this is a
[35:25] time when we should be joyous you don't
[35:29] you can make it happen if you won't do
[35:31] but anyway brother come god bless your
[35:40] church it's it's good to be in the house
[35:45] of the Lord when people are afraid of
[35:50] the virus John builders when people
[35:55] don't know where to go look at this on
[35:57] yourself outwardly we know where to go
[36:01] nowhere to go

[56:12] know he didn't show it any shorter it's
[56:14] dad we really really was good Department
[56:17] recently period more we read Genesis 25
[56:20] new region isn't saying first when you
[56:22] want to prevent the user score 20 C or I
[56:28] can't jump
[56:29] that is talking about the birth the
[56:31] weekend jumped out 27:44 yearly Oh No
[56:36] chapter 27 will read verse of 15 to 20
[56:39] to capital van said yeah chapter 27
[56:44] they'll say verse 15 to 20 you know here
[56:50] is talking how everybody the Bible says
[56:53] and Rebekah took godly raiment of her
[56:56] eldest son is so which were with her in
[57:00] the house and put them upon Jacob her
[57:03] younger son ability on suitabie Capri
[57:06] live at Monday's I used some fishing
[57:07] nearly prevail Amazon Elif he met Roger
[57:11] cops on Fisk a day and we can jump to
[57:13] our verse 18 the Bible said and he came
[57:17] unto his unto his father and say my
[57:21] father and he said here Here I am now
[57:24] here am i and then he asked him who are
[57:26] there my son and even parademon pair
[57:31] exactly what she teaches and Jacob
[57:35] answer and Jacob said I say unto his
[57:37] father
[57:37] am I so that firstborn recouped upon
[57:40] justice is a so now we let let's have
[57:44] this verse in our mind you know he went
[57:46] to his father he insisted version is
[57:49] pretty little ever simple question was
[57:51] after we opposed in history who are you
[57:54] te true but now in this play here he
[57:57] didn't tell it didn't say who it was
[58:00] he seasoned about utility he said I was
[58:02] in so what it was Jacob that utility is
[58:05] a real oddity Jocko the Bible day they
[58:07] were verse 27 and Isaac said unto Isaac
[58:12] said unto his son how is it that thou
[58:16] has found a thou has found it so quickly
[58:19] my son and he said because the LORD thy
[58:22] God brought it to me exact DF is equal
[58:26] Jonah digitally Memphis is a couple upon
[58:28] we see little net on July 15 of the homo
[58:32] verse 22 you guys even do and Jacob went
[58:35] near unto Isaac his father and he felt
[58:40] him and said the voice is Jacobs
[58:43] the voices Jacob voice but the hands are
[58:46] the hands of Esau Jacob's a Posadas
[58:49] action pair killer Tasha Edie la voie
[58:51] ill-afford Oh Jacob may limits only man
[58:55] desire Wow why because if we read
[58:57] earlier we will see that you know if you
[59:00] read before you know the entire chapter
[59:02] you see that Jacob had took the code of
[59:04] his brothers new design put blue on the
[59:07] wakisaka baby Prix du monde mm so if
[59:10] fake is identity I have a peer at this
[59:13] only don't so he took the identity of
[59:15] his brother Eli people donated some and
[59:18] she presented himself to his father
[59:19] please auntie Devon some pair for a
[59:21] blessing he was asked you know his
[59:25] father asked him who are you and he said

[59:29] the DDT is so and then if you read after
[59:32] that you'll see that he was blessed
[59:34] disability but you see that though Jacob
[59:37] was blessed with a liver Mexico BT Billy
[59:39] I didn't to stop troubles from coming to
[59:43] him
[59:43] cylinder to be part he didn't know he
[59:47] had the blessing of his father no
[59:50] because in back in that time you see
[59:52] that the blessing of the Father was the
[59:54] most was something very important Oscar
[59:56] Austin is incentive the lead work will
[59:59] have been you know it was really
[1:00:02] important for a son to be blessed by a
[1:00:04] death City Ramona sister confess what
[1:00:07] Billy possum but though he had you know

[1:00:16] you know if he probably he probably saw
[1:00:19] them to himself that you know after
[1:00:20] being blessed and my life will change it
[1:00:22] worked probably MonaVie possibly are

[1:00:30] that didn't you know that wasn't what he
[1:00:32] was expecting a city positive certainty
[1:00:35] but if we turn to our Genesis 30 32
[1:00:38] Isuzu doors in desert Thunder we are
[1:00:41] diverse 24/7 cattle to 28 discover and
[1:00:46] treat the Bible say and Jacob was left
[1:00:51] alone and their rest of the men with him
[1:00:55] until the breaking of the day

[1:00:59] an omelette avec new school evade Aloha
[1:01:01] and one is so that he prevailed now
[1:01:03] against him he touched the the hollow of
[1:01:07] his tie and the hollow of Jacob's died

[1:15:37] a little savvy killed and by doing so
[1:15:39] Paul we have an easier you know work to
[1:15:42] do you know efficiency lap all the
[1:15:44] emphasis you know he won't have to go
[1:15:47] everywhere to cry to cry and to preach
[1:15:50] so that people may gather together
[1:15:52] together originally Pollak three sheep
[1:15:55] Oh Jean but the woman was doing the work
[1:15:59] for Mesa from physicists all right but
[1:16:01] now here's something Paul didn't see the
[1:16:05] work that the woman was doing was not
[1:16:08] effective is either but he saw the
[1:16:10] Spirit behind her
[1:16:12] may 11 a fat pork on the spirit behind
[1:16:16] her a polite sister stood out yes it is
[1:16:20] you know that's why I'm you know
[1:16:21] sometimes that you you win can we can
[1:16:24] have people around you know surrounding
[1:16:26] us what I prefer different Volvo to do
[1:16:28] you know telling you
[1:16:30] you know about things Paulo de Souza you
[1:16:33] know telling you that you you know
[1:16:34] you're doing a good job or whatevs
[1:16:36] autofit on both cough I know even coming
[1:16:39] to you and telling you what the Bible is
[1:16:40] saying you know just good you know but
[1:16:42] now we have to see the spirit behind the
[1:16:45] first man River Valley's pretty
[1:16:46] relatives you know poor dinner you know
[1:16:48] poor didn't need the glory for the
[1:16:51] bipartisan to grow you know by he wanted

[1:16:55] her you know was with the good spirit
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:03] you know that's what we have to be very
[1:17:05] careful about the spirit behind things
[1:17:09] we sometimes we do listen to songs we
[1:17:12] have to be careful about the spirit
[1:17:13] behind the song before news though this
[1:17:15] audition song Devon fair attention we
[1:17:18] watch videos we have to be careful about
[1:17:20] the spirit behind the video a new
[1:17:22] elusive only for the film at all you
[1:17:25] know you can see something looks holy
[1:17:27] river Texas keeper is something look
[1:17:30] scriptural Texas keeper is about the
[1:17:32] spirit behind that is bad Melissa pretty
[1:17:34] really like a force and we have to be
[1:17:36] careful about the affero Toshio and so
[1:17:39] we see that when podcast the spirit out
[1:17:41] of oculostaple ashes it is your master
[1:17:43] now was angry because that that woman
[1:17:47] was a business to him so method if a
[1:17:49] ship escaped from it even a theory and
[1:17:51] it kills Paul and Silas he like we
[1:17:54] suppose and they were beaten easy to
[1:17:56] copy and they put them in prison
[1:17:58] always a pleasure so now if I if we know
[1:18:01] if we protect the place of Paul and
[1:18:03] Silas it's an economic boon opposed to
[1:18:05] pull here they could have gone to God
[1:18:07] and say Lord you prevent leave out you

[1:18:36] those people mocking at me
[1:18:38] Amin oh to seem optimal and but you
[1:18:41] know Paul instead of doing that Apollo
[1:18:43] Ursula in starting out to praise the
[1:18:45] Lord it occupies a Louie listen you're
[1:18:47] witnessing Iacobucci at-the-money
[1:18:49] preaching in appreciate singing so train
[1:18:53] and this man that the prison the keeper
[1:18:58] of the prison is seized Julie easy you

[1:19:28] might no matter what we're going through

[1:19:34] because we don't know who is watching us
[1:19:37] to listen patty new survey you know we
[1:19:40] might be an answer through our prayer
[1:19:42] through our trials we might be an answer
[1:19:44] for somebody else
[1:19:45] don't know the proven proven echo in the
[1:19:47] pond supported and we see now I hear at
[1:19:50] the prison is in the prison of reason
[1:19:52] you know an earthquake happened it
[1:19:54] happened uncomfortable detail it and
[1:19:57] Paul and Silas were loose a Paul is
[1:19:59] selectively be a you know they could
[1:20:01] have gone because they were free but
[1:20:04] they stay there
[1:20:05] may his honesty this man after the
[1:20:08] earthquake is atomically he didn't see
[1:20:10] Paul and Silas in a policy and you know
[1:20:14] he could have said to himself that you
[1:20:16] know now and the King won't accept me or
[1:20:20] the king will kill me because it will
[1:20:22] never believe that an earthquake
[1:20:24] happened appreciative Cole made no
[1:20:27] apology doesn't free Lou of imposter
[1:20:30] Park yeah you know I will be I would
[1:20:32] take their place because you know I
[1:20:34] would take the place Julian plastering
[1:20:37] because it will never believe that you
[1:20:39] know he will think that I'm the one who
[1:20:42] let them go first girl you walk one hey
[1:20:43] Kersey Mikey let me also go and try to
[1:20:47] copy what Paul and Silas were doing
[1:20:50] so let's want a copy of screw people you
[1:20:53] know you could have thought about that
[1:20:54] if people see us because it's so is pen
[1:20:57] cap on
[1:20:57] with Paul and Silas he saw how they were
[1:21:01] praising God with you he saw their
[1:21:04] prayer time left you know probably he
[1:21:06] was praying at 9:00 you know what every
[1:21:08] guy nepata call he could have gone and
[1:21:11] cop he starting out to manufacture while
[1:21:14] Paul and Silas were doing it really
[1:21:15] could be aloof a loofah suppose he could
[1:21:18] have gone to create his own religion
[1:21:22] valium you know based on what Paul and
[1:21:24] Silas were doing but this rule school
[1:21:26] policy that's physics but he understood
[1:21:29] that that wasn't going to help me not
[1:21:31] completely should indeed you know he
[1:21:34] understood that manufacturing something
[1:21:36] if I don't have it doesn't help he like
[1:21:38] completely cushy NEPA but he wanted to
[1:21:42] know the source of it Lucas that's why
[1:21:46] when is so Paul and Silas Gaddafi policy
[1:21:49] then he asked them sirs what must I do
[1:21:51] to be saved
[1:21:52] the opposite sir is what must I do to be
[1:21:56] like you mr. Whitcomb sir is one my side
