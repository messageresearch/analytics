[55:44] and peter calling to remembrance said
[55:47] unto him
[55:48] master behold the fig tree which thou
[55:51] curses is withered
[55:59] and jesus answered said unto them
[56:03] have faith in god jesus
[56:07] [Music]
[56:08] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[56:11] shall say
[56:12] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[56:16] be thou
[56:16] cast into the sea and shall not
[56:20] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[56:23] that those things which he saith shall
[56:26] come to pass
[56:27] he shall have whatsoever he's saying
[56:41] therefore i say unto you what things so
[56:44] so ever ye desire when you pray
[56:47] believe that ye receive them and ye
[56:50] shall have them
[56:54] and quiet
[56:58] and when you stand praying forgive
[57:01] if you have ought against any
[57:04] that your father also which is in heaven
[57:07] may
[57:07] forgive you your transparency
[57:10] illustrates
[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] but if you do not forgive neither will
[57:24] your father which is in heaven
[57:26] forgive your trespasses
[57:33] let us pray father we so thank you
[57:38] for your goodness your grace and your
[57:41] mercy
[57:42] we pray father god that you will
[57:45] look beyond all of our faults
[57:48] see our needs this morning
[57:52] dear heavenly father shall be celeste
[57:54] dear precious lamb
[57:56] shall please sure you will open the
[57:57] seals but you are
[57:59] very very least released unto us
[58:03] oh the divine revelation
[58:06] of yourself we pray this morning
[58:11] that you would come and be with us
[58:15] elevate us lord kitchen take us higher
[58:18] kitchens father will be careful to give
[58:20] you the praise
[58:22] glory in jesus christ's name
[58:26] amen amen you may be seated
[58:36] god is so good to us
[58:40] and for those of you who were not here
[58:46] on wednesday we've been
[58:49] speaking basically on faith
[58:54] prior to our leaving
[58:58] many things happen in that way and in
[59:00] that area
[59:14] and then
[59:31] and then uh brother liz paul he from
[59:34] this paul
[59:34] i i taped that message to him
[59:40] and he said that he had been looking
[59:43] into faith and things of that nature
[59:51] and what was so marvelous is that
[59:54] we finally went to service there in uh
[59:58] arizona
[1:00:13] something because without faith is
[1:00:15] impossible to please him
[1:00:23] and you and i must understand that in
[1:00:26] faith
[1:00:27] lays our victory
[1:00:32] hello not a mind over matter
[1:00:38] not mind over matter okay
[1:00:54] we have been
[1:01:03] that we are no longer subject to
[1:01:06] the grips of the 7th church
[1:01:16] because you cannot receive this message
[1:01:22] abiding in that dimension
[1:01:32] this message submission takes
[1:01:35] us to a place nozap
[1:01:50] you cannot remain in this dimension
[1:01:53] and i explain to that that to you in a
[1:01:55] moment
[1:01:57] and expect to receive things that are
[1:02:01] of god
[1:02:04] the bible tells us that we are living in
[1:02:07] heavenly places
[1:02:10] in christ jesus on jesus christ that god
[1:02:12] didn't say we were visiting
[1:02:13] heavenly places the bible said
[1:02:16] we are living in heavenly places
[1:02:20] in christ jesus on jesus christ and so
[1:02:24] we understand that christ jesus
[1:02:28] is in a higher dimension
[1:02:32] he is literally above the sixth
[1:02:34] dimension
[1:02:38] remember the prophet of god he was in a
[1:02:41] dimension
[1:02:44] under the seventh
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:47] and he wanted to see jesus jesus
[1:02:50] and the angel told him he lost ready
[1:02:53] amen that
[1:02:54] jesus was up higher oh
[1:02:58] y'all hear me now so we understand
[1:03:03] that there is a place that god is
[1:03:06] desiring
[1:03:07] his bride-to-be
[1:03:12] hallelujah remember the quote on
[1:03:14] wednesday
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:52] now you may be earth in on earth
[1:03:55] in the natural
[1:04:15] hallelujah now how long it's been since
[1:04:18] you've traveled
[1:04:18] it commented on the prophet
[1:04:21] hallelujah when god wanted to show
[1:04:24] ezekiel
[1:04:28] i love ezekiel it is a very difficult
[1:04:31] book to understand
[1:04:33] the part that i do love about it is that
[1:04:36] god
[1:04:37] by the spirit
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:53] and he told john is that right
[1:04:56] is it true that brother branham said
[1:04:59] that the bride
[1:05:00] john represents the bride represents
[1:05:03] hallelujah
[1:05:04] so if john had to come up i'll see john
[1:05:21] he sets on the right hand of the father
[1:05:28] that is figurative hallelujah
[1:05:32] because god's right hand is his
[1:05:35] authority
[1:05:36] what did you say to him hallelujah
[1:05:40] and when the word of god said all power
[1:05:43] in heaven and earth is given unto me
[1:05:46] that's what jesus said
[1:05:48] right
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:06:06] as long as you listen to the fifth
[1:06:08] dimension
[1:06:10] as long as your influence is from the
[1:06:12] fifth dimension
[1:06:15] you will never climb
[1:06:31] hallelujah you see because we
[1:06:34] want to bring law
[1:06:37] into a place where god says it's grace
[1:06:41] can i say it like this it's even beyond
[1:06:45] grace
[1:06:47] it is election amen
[1:06:50] god by his foreknowledge
[1:06:54] chose you to be bribed
[1:06:57] before he gave you grace
[1:07:10] when people are still in the in
[1:07:26] being influenced by is that right
[1:07:30] confusion probably god said it like this
[1:07:33] whatever you
[1:07:33] are here is however you are there
[1:07:39] hallelujah and if if if you're in the
[1:07:42] that dimension don't sit down like that
[1:07:46] that dimensions that pulsates
[1:07:50] from hell don't pull the balance then
[1:07:52] your soul is still in prison
[1:08:00] sometimes we allow that dimension to
[1:08:02] influence our behavior
[1:08:07] sometimes we it's the places that we
[1:08:09] find comforts
[1:08:13] sometimes it's the people that we find
[1:08:15] confident in the first
[1:08:16] one hallelujah but understand this
[1:08:20] morning
[1:08:21] i are being influenced
[1:08:24] from one world or the other don't swap
[1:08:27] you're either being your knowledge from
[1:08:29] above
[1:08:29] that's what you're being influenced
[1:08:35] oh god help us here first peter
[1:08:39] 1 15 through 16.
[1:08:43] hallelujah
[1:08:48] as we were saying wednesday commodity
[1:09:01] there's nothing wrong with the message
[1:09:04] there's nothing
[1:09:46] hallelujah because the outer court
[1:09:50] uh on the other the it's where you
[1:09:53] particular you you you you're basically
[1:09:55] naked
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:12] but when you get into the hole is of
[1:10:14] holy
[1:10:56] because in heaven they don't need breath
[1:11:00] it's only in this dimension
[1:11:05] hallelujah so what is he talking about
[1:11:10] he's talking
[1:11:24] of
[1:11:34] without satan trying to influence you
[1:11:37] you might as well stop
[1:11:54] hallelujah even though christ has
[1:11:56] defeated him
[1:11:59] hallelujah he's still the ruler he
[1:12:01] continues
[1:12:02] come out but god has given the believers
[1:12:05] something
[1:12:06] major abnormal
[1:12:12] [Music]
[1:12:31] yes not like a witch of some sort
[1:12:34] but the
[1:12:48] first peter 1 15 through 16.
[1:12:52] as he which have called you is holy me
[1:12:56] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[1:13:02] because it
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:17] hallelujah and when god looks at you
[1:13:21] he sees the token he's what you see he's
[1:13:24] the light
[1:13:26] and you are holy sound y'all hear what
[1:13:29] i'm saying
[1:13:30] because i
[1:13:44] god sees
[1:13:57] because you think your clothing makes
[1:13:59] you holy
[1:14:04] there are there are no such a thing to
[1:14:07] choose
[1:14:07] from this dimension as holy garments
[1:14:11] come on
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:24] what makes you holy
[1:15:21] he is a devil
[1:15:35] if the devil says you've got a headache
[1:15:40] against christians
[1:15:45] you must understand that that is a lie
[1:15:49] because with his stripes
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:03] but you and i must believe
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:28] is
[1:17:40] you know what i'm saying it's like when
[1:17:41] you find something funny
[1:17:46] are you kidding me yeah you can't be
[1:17:50] real no
[1:17:52] you know what i'm saying it'd be
[1:17:54] something like this
[1:17:56] threatening
[1:18:08] that's what gets me sometimes
[1:18:13] when you see a true christian
[1:18:16] and they're just so terrified
[1:18:24] spiders
[1:18:38] i said you have the liberty to leave
[1:18:41] right now
[1:18:44] but if you're here when i come back
[1:18:49] you're mine right you are mine
[1:19:06] you up
[1:19:09] yeah yeah that's how you handle demons
[1:19:16] hallelujah and when you resist the devil
[1:19:18] god
[1:19:19] fights for your
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:35] and i put some peanut butter on it
[1:19:40] i know this is off the message i'm
[1:19:43] trying to tell you
[1:19:45] just like i entrap the
[1:20:10] but we the bible said perfect love casts
[1:20:12] out fear
[1:20:14] and you guys have heard me it doesn't
[1:20:16] mean that fear is not going to come so
[1:20:18] when it does there's a there's an entity
[1:20:20] there's a god inside
[1:20:21] and that's good thrust him out of your
[1:20:24] atmosphere
[1:20:26] hallelujah you love the lord let me read
[1:20:28] romans please
[1:20:31] try not to be too much longer but i want
[1:20:33] to come to something because like i said
[1:20:36] we'll be ministering this evening as
[1:20:38] well
[1:20:40] and i just got a thought i'm trying to
[1:20:42] pull together
[1:20:57] revelation that god gives you by way of
[1:20:59] the sermon
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:06] this is why preaching is important
[1:21:10] i might preach a section of a message
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:40] he appeared and revealed himself various
[1:21:43] people in different ways hallelujah
[1:21:47] is that right on the road to email
[1:21:50] he revealed himself as a stranger
[1:21:53] hallelujah
[1:22:06] but when they were all in one place
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:21] they all knew that he was alive and well
[1:22:24] yeah that is how the seven seals work
[1:22:29] so
[1:22:33] this is what messes people's minds up
[1:23:03] to reveal his secrets to you
[1:23:08] guess what you only know that the
[1:23:11] seventh seal has been opened
[1:23:14] you're part of it
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:32] by whom also we have access
[1:23:35] by faith into his grace within we stand
[1:23:42] in hope of the glory of god
[1:23:46] not only so but with glory and
[1:23:49] tribulation
[1:23:49] also knowing that the tribulation work
[1:23:53] with patience
[1:23:55] perseverance perseverance
[1:24:00] and make it not a shame oh let's be
[1:24:02] honest because the
[1:24:03] love of god is shared abroad in our
[1:24:06] hearts
[1:24:08] by the holy ghost which is given
[1:24:11] unto us hallelujah in other words you're
[1:24:15] going to go through something
[1:24:19] but you know when we go through these
[1:24:21] trials
[1:24:23] we are justified
[1:24:28] and the first thing we do
[1:24:31] believe god's word
[1:24:34] what did i do to deserve this.
[1:24:39] you didn't do anything
[1:24:43] and many of our trials come
[1:24:46] because we pray lord i want to be just
[1:24:50] like
[1:24:53] come on somebody don't pray that
[1:24:58] if you don't want to be just like us and
[1:25:00] if you want to be just like us
[1:25:03] understand you're giving him permission
[1:25:08] to take yoga
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:22] i realize one thing
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:39] that he let in he left in the word
[1:25:42] that all things that you see
[1:25:45] work it for our good in other words
[1:25:51] that which satan for destruction
[1:25:56] god means good jew
[1:26:00] is that right now i'm going to move
[1:26:03] further i should say
[1:26:05] the bible says let this mind be
[1:26:08] in you let's go which was also
[1:26:11] in christ jesus let's go let's put you
[1:26:13] down
[1:26:14] philippians 2 5 through 7 who being in

[1:28:22] way prayer is supposed to be
[1:28:25] you don't have to wait to use summons to
[1:28:27] pray

[1:29:51] half of the kingdom
[1:29:57] we are the king hallelujah
[1:30:01] is that right why
[1:30:04] did jesus christ jesus christ named
[1:30:08] you after him because there is
[1:30:11] no other name under heaven
[1:30:16] where we must be saved
[1:30:32] hallelujah let this mind
[1:30:35] let's really speak jesus never was
[1:30:37] defeated jesus christ

[1:30:46] foreign
[1:30:58] abraham had undisturbed faith abraham
[1:31:02] avi
[1:31:02] and if you are abraham's sin
[1:31:07] faith no matter what satan does
[1:31:13] you keep your eyes on the
[1:31:28] how they had so much god in them
[1:31:33] reflected the fourth man in the fire

[1:31:41] in the fire
[1:31:52] that fire reflected his image what was
[1:31:55] that
[1:31:56] that was a different
[1:32:04] that represented jesus christ that's
[1:32:07] what i'm talking about
[1:32:09] but god can live so much of you
[1:32:12] hallelujah that when people see you
[1:32:19] you say brother brooks i don't know
[1:32:20] about that
[1:32:22] brother branham talks about that woman
[1:32:24] who needed medication

[1:32:35] that he could not give discounts
[1:32:51] the man said when he went to give her
[1:32:52] the description
[1:32:56] that he actually saw the hands of jesus
[1:33:02] he said brother you believe that when

[1:35:23] this power
[1:35:24] upon them

[1:36:14] didn't glorify elijah
[1:36:18] hallelujah it didn't glorify themselves

[1:36:25] but they sing the glorified cry
[1:36:30] and and any true believer

[1:38:26] doctrine of christ
[1:38:28] let us go on into perfection not laying
[1:38:31] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:38:33] dead works

[1:38:57] understand how free we are learn
[1:38:59] decisions
[1:39:01] we're going to understand and see that's
[1:39:02] why when you don't believe that you're
[1:39:04] free
[1:39:08] yeah when you think it's your works
[1:39:14] hallelujah you're going to be sad

[1:39:41] the laying of hands and hands and the
[1:39:44] resurrection of the dead
[1:39:45] and of eternal judgment
[1:39:50] i'm not in that dimension i'm not
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:40:06] was your judgment i'll tell you when my
[1:40:09] was
[1:40:10] deal when i was willing to yield
[1:40:14] to the holy spirit when i confess that
[1:40:17] jesus christ
[1:40:19] was my lord and savior
[1:40:32] you're here to stay
[1:40:47] in his presence
[1:41:05] hallelujah let me hurry up because this
[1:41:07] is the part that i really want to get
[1:41:14] the message is more about the
[1:41:30] ain't about keeping up uh uh up with the
[1:41:33] time
[1:41:34] and the calendar
[1:41:41] heading with the message about
[1:41:46] uh the message you know a lot of people
[1:41:47] say well when this kid had this happen
[1:41:49] then i get right
[1:41:53] you know many of us trying to wait for
[1:41:54] the california earthquake or something
[1:41:57] i don't know
[1:42:08] oh you know the message is not watching
[1:42:11] israel
[1:42:17] but that's not your time piece to know
[1:42:19] when i need to get right
[1:42:26] back
[1:42:28] but we look at these things and we say
[1:42:30] oh that's it's not
[1:42:31] in the regard
[1:42:36] not not this life eternal life
[1:42:53] and that came by the opening
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:26] you know being a message preacher don't
[1:43:28] even make you in the message
[1:43:32] oh i'm a preacher that's what the
[1:43:35] pharisees and the sadducees
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:44:03] it's always good to know what you should
[1:44:06] do and what you shouldn't do
[1:44:13] on earth that didn't make heaven
[1:44:18] either
[1:44:32] hallelujah
[1:44:46] the more truth
[1:44:59] you don't have to be mean to preach the
[1:45:01] word
[1:45:04] you don't have to be mean to preach the
[1:45:07] word
[1:45:09] like i was telling somebody the word is
[1:45:13] the word
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:40] you know and it's true i've been

[1:45:54] and i'm gonna tell you something brother
[1:45:58] the political and i'm not going to
[1:45:59] preach on politics
[1:46:01] but he said they both are rotting to the
[1:46:04] core
[1:46:07] looking at people like oh my hero
[1:46:10] there's
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:24] it was when jesus left off the scene
[1:46:28] brother talks about it and
[1:46:31] when he left off the scene the disciples
[1:46:35] forgot he was in the ship
[1:47:07] them it said ye of little faith
[1:47:12] there you go where did you doubt
[1:47:15] so let me let me show you where god is
[1:47:17] please stop listen
[1:47:20] brother spoke
[1:47:30] he prayed for those who had crossed
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:34] eyeshadow
[1:47:48] hallelujah he created things
[1:47:52] that created the show by speaking the
[1:47:54] words
[1:47:57] and those squirrels came into existence
[1:48:02] you understand me
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:15] you've already excuse me i said he's
[1:48:17] just here but in the rising of the sun
[1:48:18] don't do the video he said when jesus
[1:48:20] was resurrected
[1:48:25] amen amen hallelujah so what are you
[1:48:28] saying
[1:48:29] you are the resurrection
[1:48:32] amen
[1:48:37] but when you receive the holy ghost you
[1:48:40] have
[1:48:40] already resurrected
[1:49:14] amen hallelujah that was what he wanted
[1:49:17] to see
[1:49:19] not some garment of sackcloth and ashes
[1:49:24] god wants to see a garment of prey
[1:49:29] [Music]
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:53] i'm going to see the king
[1:49:56] amen see god is more concerned about
[1:49:59] your inner man
[1:50:03] with appearance
[1:50:06] he told the pharisees to clean up the
[1:50:08] cups
[1:50:21] i'm talking about his righteousness
[1:50:33] as long as that desire is there
[1:50:47] yes lord
[1:51:00] is i'll stop here on this one
[1:51:06] i know y'all going to just rush on out
[1:51:07] the building and go home
[1:51:10] all of that you know what it ain't
[1:51:14] happening
[1:51:17] because y'all going to go right out
[1:51:18] there and you're going to
[1:51:21] talk about 30 to 40 minutes you know i
[1:51:24] need the time y'all i just need the time
[1:51:30] so just give me a few more minutes and
[1:51:32] then you can go get
[1:51:37] amen let's turn to luke 12.
[1:51:41] what i want you to understand
[1:51:45] aim to release you from feeling
[1:52:00] oh god can i can i live righteous enough
[1:52:06] how many of y'all can live righteously
[1:52:07] enough
[1:52:10] the bible said that our righteousness is
[1:52:28] oh
[1:52:56] a treasure in the heavens that faileth
[1:52:58] not resort
[1:53:00] where no thief approaches neither moth
[1:53:02] corrupt
[1:53:06] where your treasure is
[1:53:10] will your
[1:53:26] most people are not challenged
[1:53:30] until god requires you to give some of
[1:53:31] your stuff
[1:53:38] away
[1:53:40] the greatest challenge of the rich young
[1:53:41] ruler
[1:53:44] was to give his stuff away
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:49] y'all don't believe it let me tell you
[1:53:52] show you how much mind power you have
[1:53:54] this month
[1:53:56] you will ride down the road
[1:54:01] not even hungry
[1:54:06] and burger king burger king
[1:54:11] popeyes or something voip your favorite
[1:54:13] food
[1:54:15] you're not even hungry but just to show
[1:54:18] you how easy it is for
[1:54:20] the devil to take your will away
[1:54:26] and just a whoop of that whiff of that
[1:54:29] smell
[1:54:32] and then all of a sudden you see that
[1:54:34] beautiful fried chicken on the side
[1:54:42] what happened the devil just took your
[1:54:45] will away
[1:54:49] i'm just trying to show you how he
[1:54:50] manipulates us every day
[1:54:56] oh this is my last donut
[1:55:02] yeah y'all understand me but your last
[1:55:04] donut is not your last name
[1:55:09] and i'm not trying to be funny i'm just
[1:55:11] trying to show you
[1:55:12] how easy it is to be
[1:55:16] manipulated manipulation
[1:55:20] we'll see somebody on need in need
[1:55:23] the holy ghost says stop and give that
[1:55:24] beggar twenty dollars
[1:55:28] you know in the devil you know he got
[1:55:31] more money
[1:55:32] somewhere your twenty dollar ain't the
[1:55:36] only one he's getting today
[1:55:38] and then oh no he ain't getting my
[1:55:40] twenty dollars
[1:55:42] you know but we failed to see why
[1:56:12] 99 of the time i won't say i've been
[1:56:14] perfect
[1:56:15] no no but when the holy ghost inspires
[1:56:18] me
[1:56:22] you say well how do you know it's the
[1:56:23] holy ghost because when you pass that
[1:56:26] person
[1:57:09] she is a virgin because she knows no man
[1:57:12] creeds or dogmas
[1:57:18] by and through the members of the bride
[1:57:22] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:57:25] of god to be
[1:57:26] made manifest
[1:57:31] so understand this everything
[1:57:34] that god is looking for
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:07] says leave it to me it was less
[1:58:10] what christ is saying
[1:58:13] leave it to me don't you worry
[1:58:32] of the bride
[1:58:35] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:58:38] of god
[1:58:40] to be made manifest in the virgin
[1:58:43] manifesto everything he promised that
[1:58:47] will
[1:58:48] occur in the bride
[1:58:52] it is happening
[1:58:56] hallelujah why
[1:58:59] because it's a word of promise
[1:59:02] abraham i promise you abrahams
[1:59:05] hallelujah
[1:59:10] jesus promised us jesus hallelujah so he
[1:59:13] works according to his promise
[1:59:17] but we must come up higher all right let
[1:59:20] me show you what i'm trying to say
[1:59:24] i'm just going to leave this right off
[1:59:26] we'll finish this evening by the grace
[1:59:28] of god
[1:59:35] the holy ghost
[1:59:38] is supposed to take away the
[1:59:39] condemnation
[1:59:42] from
[1:59:54] you ain't got god in you if you don't
[1:59:56] feel convicted if you're doing wrong
[2:00:02] if you can just willfully go out here
[2:00:03] and sin and don't feel no condemnation
[2:00:09] because the holy ghost is always right
[2:00:14] amen so
[2:00:18] but how can this message ever live
[2:00:22] if you just believe in it with your head
[2:00:41] you understand me so if your prayer life
[2:00:44] is lacking
[2:00:48] you you've you've you've been told a lie
[2:00:50] by the devil
[2:00:54] christ himself oh jesus christ it's
[2:00:56] going to tell you to pray without
[2:00:58] ceasing
[2:01:01] he didn't say cease from prayer but pray
[2:01:05] without ceasing
[2:01:07] and how in the world we think we're
[2:01:09] going anywhere
[2:01:12] of this hour is not to pray
[2:01:16] with your experience y'all better hear
[2:01:19] what i'm saying
[2:01:31] for the abomination done in the city
[2:01:46] we'll finish up this evening
[2:01:57] that we've got to look through this
[2:01:58] message
[2:02:00] and see the promises if one
[2:02:07] we must allow god to quicken this day to
[2:02:10] us
[2:02:13] this is the only way it's gonna come
[2:02:58] that's why i don't pay attention to what
[2:03:00] other people are doing
[2:03:03] i concentrate on this man
[2:03:07] hallelujah because people are going to
[2:03:08] do what they want to do
[2:03:10] well they're supposed to be in the
[2:03:12] message
[2:03:26] hallelujah
[2:03:31] you know i look at this thing and i'm
[2:03:33] just so i guess it shows thanking god
[2:03:35] for
[2:03:35] his grace and his mercy didn't mean to
