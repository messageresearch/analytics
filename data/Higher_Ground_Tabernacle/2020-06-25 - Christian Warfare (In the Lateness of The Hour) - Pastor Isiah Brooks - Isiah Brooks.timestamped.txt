[30:06] foreign

[30:20] me
[30:34] oh
[30:48] that's one of my favorite songs
[30:51] i can always see myself marching and
[30:54] carrying on
[30:56] like a man that's been redeemed surely
[30:59] god has been to us
[31:03] i want to thank the lord from those
[31:05] musicians and
[31:06] all the people who work the equipment
[31:08] that was on time tonight
[31:11] i thought i really say you've done an
[31:12] excellent job
[31:14] i like unity you know i think about
[31:20] a sergeant in the army
[31:26] whatever his platoon is
[31:31] they reflect the sergeant so is it in
[31:34] this honor
[31:36] however this church behaves
[31:40] you reflect me and i have to give an
[31:43] account
[31:45] all right so i just thank the lord for
[31:48] everything that
[31:49] we we're pressing into and trying to
[31:52] achieve
[31:54] i think we're doing better on timing but
[31:57] you know i don't know whether everybody
[31:58] knows but i say to all the
[32:00] the the song leaders
[32:04] by god's grace 10 minutes and 10 minutes
[32:07] before service starts i'd like to see
[32:09] you
[32:10] in my office we'll pray for five minutes
[32:13] give you five minutes to get back out
[32:14] here
[32:16] all the equipment and things that needs
[32:18] to be worked with i want you to
[32:19] understand that everything
[32:20] in the old testament had to be anointed
[32:25] the blood of jesus christ had to be
[32:26] sprinkled even on the camera
[32:29] so everything that needs to be operable
[32:33] needs to be anointed so if you want to
[32:36] come in a half hour like we should
[32:38] and pray over your instruments pray over
[32:41] whatever
[32:42] you need to pray over there's a lot to
[32:43] be prayed for and prayed about
[32:46] i would appreciate it if you can't come
[32:48] that early then
[32:50] text me and let me know you're late so
[32:52] that we won't give space for the enemy
[32:55] but like i said i'm giving you a feather
[32:56] tonight
[32:58] in your hat for the excellent uh song
[33:01] service we just had
[33:03] god is good to us and i think as we
[33:06] go on and get closer to his coming we
[33:08] must become
[33:09] more serious about our salvation
[33:12] all right you've got to understand the
[33:14] bride is not a slack woman
[33:17] she's diligent she's a proverb sturdy
[33:21] she's a diligent woman and you and i
[33:23] must be
[33:24] diligent in everything we do for christ
[33:27] and it has to be by the grace of god and
[33:29] by
[33:30] love if you don't love him your
[33:32] expression of
[33:33] your love for him is shown in the
[33:35] actions that you project
[33:38] so let us always keep that in mind
[33:41] there are times you're going to be late
[33:42] we're humans
[33:44] we we know we've got schedules that
[33:45] sometimes will conflict with
[33:47] the schedule that we're now running but
[33:50] like i said
[33:50] you know we have these phones where we
[33:52] can take we can let each other know
[33:54] so that the enemy won't cause no one to
[33:56] stumble
[33:58] you love the lord thank you for your yo
[34:01] i just been blessed i feel the presence
[34:03] of the lord and
[34:04] you know today i have had some good
[34:07] prayer with the lord i've talked it over
[34:08] with jesus
[34:10] and i learned one thing that prayer is
[34:12] the greatest thing that you can have
[34:14] going on in your life right now uh so
[34:18] we're going to be ministering tonight
[34:21] on the christian warfare we kind of did
[34:23] this down in iowa city but we also want
[34:26] to
[34:26] work with the lateness of the hour if
[34:28] there's a theme
[34:29] i want to work with the lateness of the
[34:31] hour you know because i think a lot of
[34:33] times
[34:34] we are in so uh such a hurry and such a
[34:38] rush to do
[34:39] all of the other things and we forget
[34:41] that this ship
[34:43] is going down the only ship that's going
[34:45] to stand
[34:46] is that is the ship of zion but the
[34:49] tidal waves that are coming our way
[34:51] all ships will be consumed except the
[34:54] ship
[34:54] of zion hallelujah she's about
[34:58] ready to dock she's about ready to dock
[35:01] and i'm on that ship
[35:03] hallelujah is that right brother branham
[35:06] said with troubles will come but we will
[35:08] crest
[35:09] every way hallelujah i'm glad about that
[35:13] tonight
[35:14] amen let us turn to john saint john i
[35:17] believe it is
[35:18] 2.
[35:22] saint john 2.
[35:29] lord has i expected my wife and family
[35:33] to be here i don't know what took place
[35:35] and what has happened
[35:37] but i trust by god grace they're
[35:39] listening
[35:40] they know how it is when they come to
[35:42] being late
[35:48] mercy jesus god is good to us
[35:52] saint john 2 1-5
[35:59] everybody there
[36:04] and the third day there was a marriage
[36:06] in cana
[36:08] of galilee and the mother of jesus
[36:11] was there and both jesus were called
[36:15] and his disciples to the marriage
[36:19] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[36:22] jesus said unto him
[36:25] they have no wine isn't that amazing
[36:29] at a wedding in that day and time
[36:32] with no wine
[36:36] jesus said unto her woman what have i to
[36:40] do
[36:40] with thee mine hour is not yet come
[36:45] and i that that have always puzzled me
[36:47] because
[36:49] that's little phrase mine ours or
[36:51] statement
[36:52] my hour is not yet come what how is he
[36:54] talking about
[36:57] and his mother said unto the servants
[37:00] whatsoever he
[37:01] saith unto you do it
[37:04] i like it saint john 12 23.
[37:24] beginning at the 23rd verse of the 12th
[37:26] chapter of saint john
[37:28] and jesus answered them saying
[37:31] the hour is come that the son of man
[37:35] should be
[37:36] glorified now when you hear that word
[37:38] glorify you think about
[37:40] something that's going to be glorious
[37:44] but what they are expecting
[37:47] is not what he's going to be they're
[37:49] going to be presented with
[37:52] a lot of time we realize we must
[37:54] understand let's say like that's
[37:55] the times we suffer in this earth
[38:00] in the eyes of god you are receiving
[38:03] glory
[38:05] is that right that's the way it was with
[38:07] job
[38:10] verily verily i say unto you except a
[38:12] corn of wheat
[38:14] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[38:17] alone
[38:18] but if it die it bringeth forth
[38:21] much fruit and he that loveth his life
[38:25] shall lose it and he that hateth his
[38:27] life
[38:27] in his in this world shall keep it unto
[38:30] life
[38:31] eternal if any man serve
[38:34] me let him follow me and where i am
[38:37] there shall
[38:38] he also excuse me and where i am there
[38:41] shall
[38:42] also my servant be if any man serve me
[38:46] him with my father honor one more
[38:49] scripture please
[38:52] you know the truth of the matter is
[38:55] leadership we all must be led by the
[38:58] holy spirit
[39:01] but leadership starts in the beginning
[39:04] of your own home
[39:07] your dad is there to lead you your mom
[39:09] is there to guide you
[39:11] but i find out that even in the old
[39:14] testament when
[39:16] children could not obey their parents
[39:19] they were stoned it was a harsh judgment
[39:23] it's a harsh judgment we can't when we
[39:25] can't obey god
[39:28] and a lot of times we feel like because
[39:30] we're family we won't be
[39:32] judged but we'll be judged
[39:35] and the bible tells us that judgment
[39:37] begins at the house of god
[39:41] it's hard for two leaders to follow each
[39:43] other you know
[39:44] they're always butting heads but we
[39:47] almost
[39:47] always would always uh should always
[39:50] understand who who is the leader as paul
[39:53] said follow me as i follow christ
[39:55] saint john 17 beginning at the first
[39:58] verse
[40:00] these words spake jesus
[40:03] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[40:06] said father
[40:07] the hour is come glorify thy
[40:11] son that thy son also me may glorify
[40:15] thee as thou has given him power over
[40:18] all flesh
[40:20] that he should give eternal life to as
[40:22] many as thou has given
[40:24] him i like that he has power over all
[40:27] flesh that's your flesh in my flesh
[40:32] hallelujah and this is life eternal
[40:36] that they might know thee the only true
[40:39] god
[40:40] and jesus christ whom thou has sent
[40:43] i have glorified thee on earth i have
[40:47] finished the work which
[40:48] thou gaveth me to do but listen to jesus
[40:52] this is father i've i've finished the
[40:54] work
[40:55] that's that's a statement i know i've
[40:58] finished it
[40:59] you know finished meaning there is
[41:00] nothing left nothing nothing more to do
[41:03] and now oh father glorified thou me with
[41:06] thine own self
[41:07] and with the glory which thou had
[41:11] and with the glory which i had with thee
[41:13] before the world was
[41:16] i have manifested thy name unto unto the
[41:19] men which
[41:20] thou gaveth me out of the world thine
[41:22] they were
[41:23] and thou gaveth them me
[41:28] and they have kept thy word
[41:31] let us pray father
[41:35] how gracious you are tonight
[41:38] we thank you for this beautiful
[41:41] atmosphere that you have given unto us
[41:45] lord we thank you for the spirit of
[41:48] humility
[41:51] i can remember the time lord when you
[41:54] spoke to peter in your call
[41:57] looking his in his direction and said
[41:59] get thee behind me satan
[42:02] because thou doeth not the things that
[42:04] of god are saith not the things that of
[42:06] god
[42:07] and peter being a sheep was able to
[42:11] humble himself
[42:12] to your word father i pray tonight
[42:16] that no matter which way this word comes
[42:19] whether it come in rebuke or
[42:21] encouragement
[42:23] or exaltation that you give us that
[42:26] exact spirit law
[42:28] that spirit of humility that spirit oh
[42:30] god to receive
[42:31] what you have spoken to us tonight may
[42:34] we hear the voice of the scriptures
[42:36] tonight
[42:37] may we see ourselves no one else not our
[42:40] neighbor lord it's
[42:42] me standing in the need of prayer
[42:45] father help me now help us all tonight
[42:48] that we will glorify you lord that we'll
[42:51] share
[42:52] away the flesh and that we'll look
[42:55] within our hearts
[42:57] to see what our spiritual man needs and
[43:00] father i pray that we will be able to
[43:01] receive
[43:03] what you have given to us tonight in
[43:05] your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[43:08] amen you may be seated
[43:13] christian warfare is something
[43:16] i trust all you can hear me well
[43:20] uh we we we're living in a dangerous
[43:23] time but i think
[43:24] there is no time like this time there
[43:26] have never been one
[43:27] a time like this time
[43:30] uh here we have uh
[43:34] living in the uh uh satan's eden
[43:38] where it seemed like evil has over
[43:42] rode or ridden the the good things
[43:46] god is something that uh is least
[43:50] thought about in this age even among
[43:53] christians
[43:55] even when we fellowship we fellowship
[43:57] around a lot of things
[43:59] many of us and only a little portion of
[44:02] the word is
[44:03] talked about and that's not what god
[44:07] wants our conversations
[44:10] uh must be holy
[44:14] we're living in a time when people lack
[44:17] the love for the truth
[44:20] you see if we love truth we follow truth
[44:23] we try to follow it you know
[44:25] ex to the exact because one thing about
[44:28] truth it cannot change
[44:32] that's why i love god because he's true
[44:37] and he's the same yesterday today and
[44:39] forever he cannot
[44:41] change a lack of love
[44:44] for the truth of god and
[44:47] for god and that's why jesus said if you
[44:51] love me
[44:52] you'll keep my commandments and these
[44:56] things that we
[44:57] may esteem lightly
[45:01] when it comes to god god looks at it
[45:04] and and expects every word to be made
[45:07] manifest through us who those of us who
[45:10] call ourselves the bride
[45:13] we fail to see the spiritual side of
[45:16] things
[45:18] we treat god as a system as i said
[45:20] before and
[45:21] that is the thing we must pull away from
[45:25] if you love me see that's the key
[45:28] to actually being in the place where god
[45:31] expects you to
[45:32] be and to be obedient to god when he
[45:34] expects you to be obedient
[45:37] when we look even at saul who
[45:41] who once leaned upon uh
[45:45] samuel i preached this somewhat last
[45:48] time and all of a sudden the emphasis
[45:52] of samuel switched because
[45:55] all of a sudden it was saul versus
[45:58] samuel's devil samuel versing
[46:00] saul and samuel taught samuel was a type
[46:04] of the holy spirit
[46:05] saul was a type of the believer
[46:08] all of a sudden it was saul in the holy
[46:11] spirit instead of the holy spirit and
[46:13] saul
[46:15] and that's what happened to a lot of
[46:16] christians this is what what happens to
[46:18] us
[46:19] we start out following the holy ghost
[46:22] and then it eventually flips and we want
[46:25] the holy ghost to follow
[46:27] us it's it's it's what we
[46:30] do because of this human flesh
[46:34] this is why paul said i must die daily
[46:38] i must die and you must die daily it
[46:41] must be
[46:42] a prayer life somewhere you got to have
[46:44] it
[46:47] if jesus christ our lord had to pray
[46:50] to keep under the word you and i must
[46:53] pray
[46:55] in his natural humane he said father i
[46:58] would that this cup passed from me
[47:03] none of us like to suffer but sometimes
[47:06] the cup is what god has given us
[47:10] is that right they said lord lord
[47:13] can we drink from the cup that you drank
[47:15] from yes
[47:17] you're gonna drink from it i'm giving it
[47:19] to you
[47:21] a cup of what suffering
[47:24] hallelujah and you and i must understand
[47:28] that if we're going to take up our cross
[47:30] we better do it now
[47:33] one thing i love about brother branham
[47:34] he he
[47:36] he he practiced what he preached
[47:40] he lived it and he wasn't just living
[47:43] for himself
[47:44] he was living for others he guarded
[47:47] himself
[47:47] he guarded the word because he realized
[47:50] that other people were depending
[47:52] upon the very words that he was speaking
[47:56] he didn't just pray for himself he
[47:58] prayed for us
[48:01] this is a little prayer that he prayed
[48:03] in the gifts and calling
[48:05] without repentance he said god stretched
[48:09] forth
[48:10] his mighty wings across this building
[48:13] for these nights and bathed it with
[48:16] his full dewdrops of glory and mercy
[48:20] and power of healing through jesus
[48:22] christ flows through
[48:24] our mortal bodies here and may there not
[48:27] be one afflicted person
[48:29] left in our midst at the end of the
[48:31] service
[48:32] granted lord we love you
[48:35] thou knoweth our hearts more than people
[48:38] know
[48:39] our voices i love that because we can
[48:43] get up here
[48:44] and we can say whatever that seems
[48:46] righteous and
[48:47] really it sounds good but at the end of
[48:49] the day
[48:51] god is not watching the words that's
[48:53] proceeding out of your mouth
[48:54] he's looking at your heart
[48:58] and you and i know that it was a it is a
[49:01] you know i chose this and i said i chose
[49:03] it but god gave me this scripture
[49:05] according to saint john 2 1-5 because
[49:08] jesus told
[49:09] his uh mary
[49:12] my hour has not yet come
[49:16] it's not a time for you to put emphasis
[49:18] on me
[49:20] it's not a time it meant for you to to
[49:23] look at my
[49:24] my this part of of of of of me
[49:28] that that that you want to glory no no
[49:30] no no
[49:31] remember jesus healed a lot of people
[49:33] and he says tell no one
[49:36] don't tell anybody what was it he was
[49:39] not a glory seeker
[49:41] even though he was the son of god if you
[49:43] want to put it this way he was god
[49:46] but in that place that he was in
[49:50] he was about the father's business
[49:53] not his own and you and i must
[49:56] understand that
[49:57] if you see anybody that's seeking glory
[50:01] or such a great reputation they are
[50:03] inspired
[50:05] by the wrong spirit as you heard me
[50:09] preach the last time
[50:10] it was nimrod who says let's make
[50:13] ourselves a name
[50:15] but here was god who took abraham
[50:19] who was nobody he was actually
[50:22] an idol worshiper pulled him out of the
[50:25] land of chaldea
[50:26] and gave him a promise i am going to
[50:29] make you a name
[50:31] see it's all right when god makes your
[50:33] name
[50:34] but when you seek to make your own name
[50:37] you're putting yourself before god
[50:41] i don't care about all of the stuff
[50:44] i'm looking at something i'm looking at
[50:46] promises i'm looking at god what he's
[50:48] promised us to do
[50:49] and i'm looking at this thing i'm going
[50:51] to achieve it by god's grace
[50:54] not for me but for him
[50:57] i i'm just i'm just at a place
[51:00] where i want to be if it's god's will
[51:03] a manifestation of the message
[51:06] of this hour not just a follower
[51:10] not just a church member hallelujah
[51:14] these words that have been spoken by
[51:16] malachi 4
[51:18] is accurate when he preached it wasn't
[51:22] him it was god
[51:23] preaching to the man and if god has said
[51:25] we will be a supernatural church
[51:27] that's exactly what i'm looking for
[51:32] hallelujah his hour had not come yet
[51:41] he turned the water into wine
[51:45] many times jesus did miracles and he
[51:47] would slip through the crowd so
[51:48] no man would praise him
[51:52] because his hour had not yet come
[51:56] he said i can do nothing except the
[51:58] father show me
[51:59] let me tell y'all something saints of
[52:01] god though we be bright we must never
[52:04] amen glorify ourselves
[52:08] our hour has not yet come
[52:12] and when we see the miracles and we see
[52:15] the signs and
[52:16] we see the uh the the the great things
[52:18] that god
[52:20] do through men the wonders it all
[52:22] supposed to go
[52:23] to jesus christ this is his power
[52:30] hallelujah jesus even said
[52:35] the hours come
[52:38] that the son of man should be glorified
[52:43] and no doubt in their minds they
[52:45] probably thought oh my god
[52:46] we're going to take rome over and that's
[52:48] just going to be glorious
[52:51] he's going to be glorified
[52:54] but that wasn't what he was trying to
[52:56] tell them something must die
[52:58] in order to live that's your glory
[53:02] that's my glory if you don't die to
[53:05] yourself
[53:05] you won't live it takes a killing it
[53:09] takes a rottening out
[53:10] in order for life to grow in you there's
[53:14] a resurrection
[53:15] that must take place in your life here
[53:17] before
[53:18] it takes forth in your life later
[53:23] barely verily except a corn of wheat
[53:25] fall into the ground and die
[53:27] it abideth alone but if it die it
[53:30] bringeth forth
[53:31] much fruit this day and hour i know we
[53:34] will have to give an account
[53:36] of how many people we've witnessed this
[53:38] message to
[53:41] and oftentimes i think to myself i know
[53:43] that the anointing of the lord is
[53:45] lifting
[53:46] we know that it is nothing like it used
[53:48] to be years ago
[53:50] and it's now our time that we're we're
[53:52] in it's a time of pressing
[53:55] hallelujah if you don't press you'll
[53:58] have the mind to give up
[54:00] satan will take you you can't stand
[54:04] still
[54:04] standing still is backsliding
[54:08] you must go forward
[54:11] that's right you must face
[54:14] your responsibilities jesus had to face
[54:19] his responsibilities hallelujah jonah
[54:22] had to face his responsibilities
[54:26] he did not want to go to nineveh
[54:31] he was a prophet running from god
[54:35] but nevertheless he had to face up to
[54:38] his responsibilities
[54:39] even though this is a gentile nation
[54:42] they're not going to like me because i'm
[54:43] a jew but
[54:44] god is saying i must go preach
[54:47] did you know what jonah was doing jonah
[54:50] was literally typing out god
[54:54] going for a gentile bride and know
[54:57] that in in nineveh amen it was a wicked
[55:01] city
[55:02] search the history drug addicts
[55:04] prostitution
[55:05] every sin that could be named it was
[55:08] like another
[55:09] sodom but god had seed
[55:12] i love this i love this because you know
[55:14] what god did he rode into nineveh
[55:17] in a ship called grace did y'all know
[55:19] that
[55:20] a fish represents the grace of god
[55:24] hallelujah nothing neil never did
[55:27] it was the grace of god that sent them a
[55:29] prophet there's nothing you and i have
[55:32] done
[55:32] it's the grace of god that have sent us
[55:34] a prophet
[55:36] hallelujah i was telling about the other
[55:39] day i said people want to
[55:40] cut the prophet of god out i said then
[55:42] cut out moses
[55:45] hallelujah tell me the story of egypt
[55:47] without moses
[55:49] tell me the story of no uh of the flood
[55:52] without noah
[55:54] you can't do it he's the main characters
[55:58] hallelujah but we know that it was
[56:01] christ
[56:02] and noah we know that it was christ and
[56:04] moses
[56:05] hallelujah it was christ in jesus
[56:09] that's why you call him jesus christ
[56:13] we look at this
[56:19] jesus comes and he talks about
[56:23] the time of his glorified that god would
[56:26] glorify him
[56:28] like i said it confused them
[56:32] it confused them because they just
[56:34] thought he was the king
[56:36] he was really the messiah i don't know
[56:39] how they doubt it
[56:42] but sometimes i guess we doubt too
[56:45] but they doubt it yeah on the road to
[56:48] emmaus
[56:49] they said we thought he was the one
[56:53] and jesus who's already resurrected from
[56:55] the dead
[56:56] walked with them in such a patience and
[56:58] a love but one thing he said let me tell
[57:00] you something about the word of god
[57:02] he will rebuke you when you're wrong
[57:06] he didn't spare them in their time of
[57:07] sorrow he said all
[57:09] fools and slow of heart
[57:12] why can't you believe the scripture and
[57:15] then he began to preach
[57:17] from the old testament bringing it all
[57:19] the way up
[57:20] and all they could say was did not our
[57:23] hearts burn
[57:26] as he talked with us along the way
[57:28] hallelujah
[57:30] you see it's amazing that god had to
[57:33] take almost the old testament the whole
[57:35] old testament all of the prophets and
[57:37] preached jesus
[57:40] preached jesus in order for their eyes
[57:44] to be open
[57:46] he still had to do a supernatural thing
[57:49] it looked like something would have
[57:51] happened but the bible said god had
[57:53] their eyes holding
[57:55] see what i'm saying god can be talking
[57:57] right to you
[57:58] and if he he doesn't want your eyes to
[58:00] be open he'll keep it closed
[58:03] and then if somebody else is in the
[58:05] audience he'll open their eyes
[58:08] god have mercy on whom he will but my
[58:11] god may the spirit of the scripture the
[58:13] voice of the scripture speak to my heart
[58:15] tonight
[58:16] show me the lateness of the hour we're
[58:19] at the end
[58:20] we're at a time when the bride is
[58:22] getting ready to go through some
[58:23] horrible things
[58:25] and yet and still it seems like people
[58:27] are are walking with
[58:28] one eye or no eyes blind lay out a seal
[58:32] and that spirit is alive and if you're
[58:35] not careful
[58:36] it will envelop you
[58:40] we must as i said we must not
[58:43] be like saul amen in the people of saul
[58:47] amen when they chose saul over samuel
[58:49] amen
[58:51] that king wanted to give uh uh
[58:55] uh take out their right eye and brother
[58:57] branham said the right eye is the
[58:59] spiritual eye
[59:00] there's a lot of people walking around
[59:02] with one eye and that one eye is left
[59:06] left-eyed right you can't even see the
[59:10] spiritual things you can't understand
[59:12] it's not the leadership of a man but the
[59:14] leadership of the holy spirit
[59:16] it was listen that's what god told
[59:18] samuel samuel
[59:19] they that these people have not not uh
[59:22] uh uh
[59:23] rejected you they've rejected me
[59:26] that's how even with the past if the
[59:27] pastor is preaching the word
[59:29] and trying to instruct and give
[59:30] instruction to the people and they're
[59:32] rejecting him they're not rejecting him
[59:35] they're rejecting god and guess what
[59:36] happens to them they end up with a mean
[59:39] spirit
[59:41] oh yeah just what happened to saul
[59:44] saul rejected him uh uh uh samuel
[59:47] and he got an evil spirit read the birth
[59:50] the bible said that's
[59:52] exactly what happened to the believer
[59:54] when they reject the holy spirit
[59:56] god will give them a mean spirit
[1:00:00] that's a quote
[1:00:04] hallelujah but we must understand by
[1:00:07] god's grace that
[1:00:08] this message is calling for divine love
[1:00:11] we we preach it all the time right
[1:00:13] we preach amen you've got to have the
[1:00:14] statue of a perfect man
[1:00:16] it's got to be in you those virtues got
[1:00:18] to be in you
[1:00:20] that's the rainbow of god that's the
[1:00:22] covenant of god
[1:00:23] without the covenant without the rainbow
[1:00:27] there is no covenant
[1:00:29] is that right the prophet god said each
[1:00:31] one of those virtues
[1:00:33] have a color that goes with it
[1:00:36] it's a rainbow
[1:00:40] and god made a rainbow sign amen
[1:00:43] with noah
[1:00:46] and then he made a rainbow sign and then
[1:00:49] with the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:50] is that right brother brown said i was
[1:00:53] out there
[1:00:54] and all of a sudden i saw three rainbows
[1:00:57] three perfection and they were all
[1:01:00] coming in the same direction
[1:01:02] and ending up in the same place
[1:01:06] and he goes on and said the jehovah god
[1:01:08] of the old testament of jesus christ
[1:01:10] of the new there was a covenant
[1:01:14] a covenant that god has given to us not
[1:01:16] only just a covenant but a
[1:01:18] revelation with the covenant that he has
[1:01:21] given you
[1:01:22] i mean the revelation of who jesus
[1:01:24] christ is
[1:01:25] not was he's ashamed yesterday today and
[1:01:28] forever
[1:01:28] he's a god that changes not
[1:01:31] hallelujah but understand he's not only
[1:01:34] just a god of love
[1:01:35] he's a god of wrath
[1:01:39] he's a god that is consuming fire
[1:01:43] sometimes we think god is some kind of
[1:01:45] dirty old man he's not
[1:01:48] he can't change he's the same and the
[1:01:50] sin that the way he
[1:01:52] judged sin yesterday is the same way he
[1:01:54] judges sin today
[1:01:57] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:02:00] folks it's important to make sure you
[1:02:03] under the blood
[1:02:05] there is no other safe place you must be
[1:02:08] under the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:11] hallelujah we we we're in a a situation
[1:02:14] where
[1:02:15] we have to be careful first peter 4
[1:02:19] 15-17 says but let none of you suffer as
[1:02:22] a murderer
[1:02:23] or as a thief or as an evildoer
[1:02:26] or as a busybody in other men's matters
[1:02:30] and we've got so many people in the
[1:02:32] message who
[1:02:34] suffers from these things you wouldn't
[1:02:36] even think that people would steal from
[1:02:37] god they do steal
[1:02:40] hello when you don't pay your tithing
[1:02:42] you steal it
[1:02:45] no thief will enter oh i got faith and
[1:02:48] you can't even trust god with your
[1:02:49] finances
[1:02:51] but we do it hallelujah
[1:02:55] we look at people and we see these
[1:02:57] evildoers we see these busy bodies
[1:02:59] and that's the truth amen people know
[1:03:01] more about gossip than they do know
[1:03:03] about the gospel
[1:03:08] it's the truth yet if any man suffer as
[1:03:11] a christian
[1:03:12] let him not be ashamed but let him
[1:03:14] glorify god on this behalf how many of
[1:03:16] us suffer for
[1:03:17] because we're christians you know if you
[1:03:20] don't suffer as a christian you
[1:03:21] more than likely something's wrong with
[1:03:23] your fire
[1:03:25] because a christian can't help but to
[1:03:27] take advantage of every opportunity that
[1:03:29] is presented to him
[1:03:30] to testify of jesus christ sometimes we
[1:03:33] miss god
[1:03:34] but for the most part we always want to
[1:03:37] tell
[1:03:38] somebody about the savior
[1:03:43] for the time has come that judgment must
[1:03:45] begin at the house of god and if it
[1:03:47] first began at us what shall the
[1:03:49] end of them be them that obey not the
[1:03:52] gospel of god
[1:03:53] hello and you and i must understand this
[1:03:56] is where the judgment starts
[1:03:58] right here oh it's not good
[1:04:01] just to give people just messages of
[1:04:03] sweetness and everything
[1:04:04] they forget sweet things always puff
[1:04:08] people up
[1:04:09] hallelujah we need amen the sword of god
[1:04:13] to cut
[1:04:14] and to go down into the soul that's what
[1:04:16] it's for
[1:04:17] if god if this word can't convict you
[1:04:21] then you're not convictable if i could
[1:04:23] say it like that
[1:04:24] god there's something wrong with the
[1:04:26] heart
[1:04:28] hallelujah you love the lord see what
[1:04:32] people don't understand sometimes we can
[1:04:33] just grieve
[1:04:34] god breathe him away from us brother
[1:04:37] brown said when you do that you're done
[1:04:40] we can send so much old offer give me
[1:04:42] old law forgive me oh lord forgive me oh
[1:04:43] lord forgive me
[1:04:44] oh lord forgive me oh lord and they
[1:04:46] ain't trying to repent
[1:04:49] because we don't pray how can you fully
[1:04:52] repent without prayer
[1:04:55] can't do it you need to pray you need to
[1:04:59] cry out you need to sob
[1:05:00] a little bit right amen if you really
[1:05:04] want repentance in your heart
[1:05:05] you get on your knees until jesus comes
[1:05:08] hallelujah coming from the message
[1:05:11] breach
[1:05:12] between the seven church ages brother
[1:05:15] bram says
[1:05:16] lord jesus the hours are growing late
[1:05:20] it may even be later than we are
[1:05:23] thinking
[1:05:25] and we are happy to see this hour
[1:05:28] approaching
[1:05:29] it is the most glorious hour that the
[1:05:32] world has ever
[1:05:34] known for the believer now that's just
[1:05:37] the way i see it
[1:05:39] i see it that way you know what really
[1:05:42] what really
[1:05:43] what really uh tickled me is that
[1:05:45] sometimes we have that david
[1:05:47] mentality i can sleep with bathsheba
[1:05:52] and ain't nobody gonna know
[1:05:57] and i can try to get rid of all of the
[1:05:59] evidence
[1:06:00] but what you don't understand is that we
[1:06:02] have a all-seeing eye
[1:06:06] oh it's true it is amazing
[1:06:09] you know how people stand in the message
[1:06:11] and they can have a wife
[1:06:12] and a girlfriend and thank god don't see
[1:06:16] him
[1:06:18] i hope those people are listening to me
[1:06:20] because i want them to know what god has
[1:06:22] shown me
[1:06:25] and we are happy to see this hour
[1:06:27] approaching it is the most glorious
[1:06:30] hour that the world has ever known for
[1:06:33] the believer
[1:06:34] but for the rejecter the most saddest
[1:06:38] kind that could ever be there couldn't
[1:06:42] find words
[1:06:44] there couldn't find words in the
[1:06:46] alphabet
[1:06:47] letters to be to make words that could
[1:06:49] express
[1:06:50] the trouble and sorrow that lays ahead
[1:06:54] and neither is their words could be
[1:06:56] formed
[1:06:57] from our alphabets to express the
[1:06:59] blessing that lays ahead for the
[1:07:01] believer
[1:07:03] listen people choose you this day
[1:07:06] whom you gonna serve
[1:07:10] i had a sister call me and i won't call
[1:07:12] her name but she used to come to this
[1:07:14] church and
[1:07:15] we love her we always have loved her and
[1:07:18] uh
[1:07:18] she was calling and had been praying her
[1:07:21] son
[1:07:22] uh paul called me the other day wanting
[1:07:24] to come to church i said anytime you
[1:07:26] want me to pick you up let me know and
[1:07:27] i'll come pick you up
[1:07:28] and uh you know she wants to come and
[1:07:30] say sister
[1:07:32] if god had given up on you you wouldn't
[1:07:35] even have a desire to serve me
[1:07:37] i said what you need to do is come and
[1:07:40] let god
[1:07:42] take care of the rest
[1:07:45] hallelujah there's nothing you can do
[1:07:48] nothing you can do nor can i can't do
[1:07:51] nothing
[1:07:52] no man can add one cubit to his statue
[1:07:55] but one thing for sure
[1:07:56] we know how to pray somehow how do you
[1:07:59] pray you just pray
[1:08:02] hallelujah god will give you the words
[1:08:04] to pray and if you don't have the words
[1:08:06] abcdefg he's good enough for him
[1:08:10] right the bible said that even when we
[1:08:13] don't know how to pray
[1:08:14] the holy spirit will pray for you
[1:08:18] he knows what to pray he knows your
[1:08:20] needs
[1:08:22] but if you've got a desire to pray pray
[1:08:25] i'm telling you
[1:08:26] i've had i've been see-sawing you know
[1:08:29] up and down up and down
[1:08:30] allowing things to get in my way to keep
[1:08:32] me from praying and i'm gonna tell you
[1:08:34] something whenever something gets in
[1:08:35] your way to keep you from praying
[1:08:37] the devil got a trick for you devil got
[1:08:40] something down the road
[1:08:41] and he's going to trip you if you're not
[1:08:43] careful
[1:08:44] one of the worst things he can do is
[1:08:46] take your joy
[1:08:48] and the desire to pray away from you
[1:08:51] that's a cursed thing when the bible
[1:08:54] said pray without ceasing
[1:08:56] always pray always pray
[1:08:59] you love the lord coming from the breach
[1:09:02] amen once again
[1:09:04] paragraph 3 24 he said grant lord
[1:09:07] that these people on their feet that
[1:09:09] standing in their hearts
[1:09:11] making their confession and willing to
[1:09:14] let the spirit of god
[1:09:15] mold them and cut them and shape them
[1:09:19] into living stones into the house of the
[1:09:21] lord god
[1:09:22] granted father i commit them to you now
[1:09:26] now
[1:09:26] i want you to understand that this
[1:09:28] message this prayer is not for the
[1:09:30] people
[1:09:30] just back then it's for us now
[1:09:34] he's praying for me he's praying for you
[1:09:37] that god will cut you that god would
[1:09:40] come in and
[1:09:40] circumcise you that god will come and
[1:09:43] shear
[1:09:44] everything away from you off of you that
[1:09:47] shouldn't be there
[1:09:48] oh god i was praying today lord share me
[1:09:51] at whatever cost share me
[1:09:53] cut i don't care just make me ready lord
[1:09:57] hallelujah i want to be ready
[1:10:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:04] you know you know i don't want to be
[1:10:08] like daniel curry
[1:10:10] daniel curry was a preacher preached all
[1:10:12] those years
[1:10:14] daniel curry dies and he goes to heaven
[1:10:18] and the gatekeeper looking for daniel
[1:10:20] curry's
[1:10:21] name whew that disturbs me
[1:10:25] and the angel says i'm sorry daniel your
[1:10:28] name is not on the list
[1:10:31] no it can't be i was a preacher see
[1:10:33] being a preacher doesn't give you a
[1:10:35] ticket
[1:10:36] it doesn't open the gates for you only
[1:10:39] the holy spirit
[1:10:40] in you not on you not with you in
[1:10:44] you opens the gate
[1:10:48] daniel curry says lord well my what must
[1:10:51] i do
[1:10:53] the angel said you gotta appeal before
[1:10:54] the white throne judgment
[1:10:58] he said that's the only thing i'm going
[1:10:59] to tell you he says well what else do i
[1:11:01] have
[1:11:01] i don't know what else to do he said all
[1:11:04] of a sudden he began to travel
[1:11:06] and as he traveled through time he said
[1:11:08] the light got brighter and brighter
[1:11:10] brighter brighter i forgot he said
[1:11:11] something like a million times brighter
[1:11:13] than the sun however you said it
[1:11:15] he said all of a sudden he i heard the
[1:11:17] lord says daniel curry
[1:11:20] have you been perfect on earth
[1:11:25] come on i want you i'm gonna ask you a
[1:11:26] question have you been perfect
[1:11:30] jamie said no i haven't been perfect
[1:11:33] have you ever told a lie yes
[1:11:36] have you ever been uh uh dishonest and
[1:11:38] have you ever stolen anything
[1:11:41] you know he thought he was standing good
[1:11:42] he says when that light when you're in
[1:11:44] that light you realize
[1:11:46] whoa jesus have mercy nothing
[1:11:49] was able to to just to come out that was
[1:11:52] good
[1:11:54] all he could think about was how
[1:11:55] imperfect he was
[1:11:57] all of a sudden a sweet voice
[1:12:01] said the voice was sweeter than a
[1:12:02] mother's voice
[1:12:04] says father daniel curry's prayed for me
[1:12:08] on earth
[1:12:10] and i'll stand for him right now he said
[1:12:13] because before that happened
[1:12:14] he thought in a moment's time he was
[1:12:16] going to hear the words
[1:12:18] the word of god says depart from me
[1:12:21] but you see even though he didn't have
[1:12:25] what it took and he stood for god on
[1:12:28] earth god stood for him then
[1:12:31] i don't want to come to that place when
[1:12:34] i get there
[1:12:35] i want the gates to open up i want
[1:12:38] somebody to say
[1:12:39] well done you see what i'm saying that's
[1:12:42] why it's so important to make sure that
[1:12:44] all of your actions
[1:12:46] that you're doing for jesus is motivated
[1:12:48] by love
[1:12:49] and that love is the love of god and for
[1:12:51] god
[1:12:52] it must be it can't be a ritual
[1:12:56] it can't be something that you're doing
[1:12:58] for christ hallelujah he'll never owe
[1:13:01] you
[1:13:01] older man nothing but one thing i do
[1:13:04] want more than anything else
[1:13:06] is that divine love on display
[1:13:10] on display because i know
[1:13:14] if it's on display here it'll get me in
[1:13:16] the game
[1:13:19] is that right the trouble of this is you
[1:13:22] see
[1:13:23] coming from the message god's way he
[1:13:25] said we stop and talk to
[1:13:27] to too many people we stop for too many
[1:13:31] social parties
[1:13:32] we have so much sewing sewing and
[1:13:35] organize the stitching party and you
[1:13:37] know stitch and sew and talk about miss
[1:13:40] so-and-so you know how it is all these
[1:13:43] different things
[1:13:44] come into to the church and we do it in
[1:13:47] a different way
[1:13:48] we have dinner parties without our
[1:13:50] dinner party we talk about everybody but
[1:13:52] jesus
[1:13:54] every preacher that's going wrong y'all
[1:13:56] hear what i'm saying
[1:13:58] it ain't a holy conversation most of the
[1:14:00] time
[1:14:01] hallelujah arguing with brothers and all
[1:14:04] about doctrines and things of that day
[1:14:06] that is not the holy spirit
[1:14:09] when the bible says strive with no man
[1:14:13] hallelujah you know how it is all these
[1:14:16] different things coming to the church
[1:14:18] when you ought to throw all the guilt
[1:14:21] gully wash out
[1:14:22] and have an old-fashioned god-sent
[1:14:25] revival
[1:14:26] pray through till till you're back
[1:14:30] heaven is down and the holy ghost comes
[1:14:32] like a rushing mighty wind
[1:14:34] and feel the place and the people amen
[1:14:36] he said that's what we need
[1:14:38] see and that's the thing i'm taking my
[1:14:40] time preaching tonight
[1:14:42] i'm literally going slow on purpose
[1:14:45] because i want us
[1:14:46] everybody to really catch the anointing
[1:14:48] that how late it is
[1:14:52] the problem of god has been gone for
[1:14:53] years now
[1:14:55] the bride should be at a place of
[1:14:57] maturity
[1:14:58] hello we're now living in the long
[1:15:01] suffering of god
[1:15:03] hallelujah but can't you see that that
[1:15:06] the judgment and the wrath of god
[1:15:07] striking the earth
[1:15:10] you've got to be a blind man not to see
[1:15:12] it
[1:15:13] it's like we're living in the days of
[1:15:15] egypt all over again
[1:15:17] and as i said in the early sermon amen
[1:15:20] the blood must be applied
[1:15:22] not to your house at the home your your
[1:15:24] dope clothes of your house
[1:15:25] at home but the doorpost of your heart
[1:15:28] it must be applied in order to escape
[1:15:32] the death angel let me tell you like
[1:15:34] this a lot of people
[1:15:36] right now amen are sitting up in
[1:15:38] churches and they're spiritually dead
[1:15:40] because they haven't applied the blood
[1:15:43] god told me that i think in 2013
[1:15:46] he said in this message he didn't say
[1:15:48] denomination we know they did
[1:15:50] but in this message that a lot of people
[1:15:52] are sitting right up in church
[1:15:54] they're dead and they don't even know
[1:15:59] a dead man don't have no desire
[1:16:03] not here he's dead
[1:16:06] when you don't have a desire for god and
[1:16:08] a thirst for god because a dead man
[1:16:10] don't thirst
[1:16:12] he's dead in this dimension y'all
[1:16:14] understand me
[1:16:16] now he might be in hell somewhere
[1:16:17] thirsty he might be in hell somewhere
[1:16:20] with a desire
[1:16:21] but in this dimension he's dead
[1:16:26] and when you're here and you don't want
[1:16:28] more of god all you want is religion
[1:16:31] coming to church doing your dance and
[1:16:33] your shout
[1:16:34] listen that's what pentecost have been
[1:16:36] doing for ages
[1:16:38] that ain't what god called for us he
[1:16:40] gave us life
[1:16:41] and that we might have it more
[1:16:43] abundantly we must be a light to this
[1:16:45] gentile world
[1:16:47] hallelujah hey don't worry
[1:16:50] the pressure the squeeze is coming and
[1:16:53] god gonna prove your religion
[1:16:56] he's gonna prove it and you're gonna
[1:16:58] have to face up to responsibility
[1:17:01] hallelujah when they knock on your door
[1:17:03] and ask you do you really believe this
[1:17:05] malachi
[1:17:05] 4. hallelujah remember i think i was
[1:17:08] talking to somebody the other day
[1:17:10] about how uh you know uh how the song
[1:17:13] became the song i have decided to follow
[1:17:16] jesus

[1:17:20] the man had his two child let his two
[1:17:22] children that get killed
[1:17:23] and his wife and himself and when the
[1:17:26] king said i'm going to kill you too if
[1:17:28] you don't deny this jesus christ
[1:17:30] he said the cross is before me and the
[1:17:33] world is behind me
[1:17:35] hallelujah they all died in faith and
[1:17:38] guess what
[1:17:38] that whole tribe of people plus the king
[1:17:42] you need to go find it and listen to it

[1:17:48] every christian

[1:19:00] and whatever the doctor tell you is a
[1:19:02] lie
[1:19:04] hallelujah i don't mean no harm and not
[1:19:06] nobody disrespect
[1:19:08] but if jesus ain't told me i don't have
[1:19:10] to believe it
[1:19:12] right hey they can give me all they want
[1:19:15] like that like the
[1:19:16] lady said to brother branham said you
[1:19:18] know i've studied and
[1:19:20] my equipment has shown me that there's
[1:19:22] no way this
[1:19:23] heart rate anybody that we don't know
[1:19:25] nobody whose heart rate
[1:19:27] was that low ever came back back
[1:19:30] up again that old man
[1:19:33] put his hand on that that young nurse
[1:19:35] and says honey
[1:19:37] i realize and understand you going by
[1:19:39] your instruments
[1:19:41] hallelujah but i'm going by a promise
[1:19:44] hallelujah
[1:19:45] and that that's what god like to hear he
[1:19:48] like to see
[1:19:48] people who stand on the promise
[1:19:52] we all come short i'm not saying i'm
[1:19:55] perfect within myself
[1:19:56] but i got a perfect god on the inside of
[1:19:59] me and as long as he's inside of me
[1:20:01] perfect
[1:20:03] that makes me perfect hallelujah i
[1:20:06] confess
[1:20:07] every day i ask in prayer every day i
[1:20:09] have to cast down imaginations
[1:20:11] every day i have to is that right amen
[1:20:15] every hot thing that exalts itself
[1:20:17] against the knowledge of god
[1:20:18] amen i have to bring that thing into
[1:20:20] obedience
[1:20:22] holly is that right listen because
[1:20:25] if you you're being attacked by a demon
[1:20:30] of oppression and if you don't bring
[1:20:33] that demon
[1:20:34] into captivity if you don't bind him
[1:20:38] he becomes your god you begin to worship
[1:20:41] him
[1:20:42] who you hear your memories to obey
[1:20:44] that's who you're serving
[1:20:47] y'all understand me it doesn't matter
[1:20:49] what it is if you do what the devil
[1:20:51] tells you to do you become a servant of
[1:20:53] his
[1:20:54] jesus say get behind me satan
[1:20:58] though i speak with tongues and of men
[1:21:00] and of angels and have not charity i am
[1:21:02] become
[1:21:03] as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol
[1:21:06] now come on you and i didn't come this
[1:21:09] way
[1:21:09] all this way as a christian to sound
[1:21:12] like a sounding brass and a tinkling
[1:21:14] symbol hallelujah he said without
[1:21:16] charity
[1:21:18] that's what you sound like
[1:21:21] you know noise noise
[1:21:25] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:21:27] and understand all
[1:21:28] mysteries and all knowledge and though i
[1:21:31] have all
[1:21:31] faith and so that and see that's what we
[1:21:33] do whoo that preaches powerful
[1:21:36] i mean he raised the dead and you know
[1:21:38] he he you know
[1:21:39] he did win how could he raise the dead
[1:21:43] no man has raised the dead god raised
[1:21:46] the dead
[1:21:47] jesus said i can't do nothing except my
[1:21:49] father showed me
[1:21:51] it ain't the man and brother branham
[1:21:53] warned us about that
[1:21:55] he did he said i don't like it when they
[1:21:57] say brother branham did
[1:21:59] right he said i don't do nothing i can't
[1:22:00] do anything
[1:22:02] but we'll do that we'll make up we'll
[1:22:04] glorify a man
[1:22:05] instead of glorifying god that's the way
[1:22:07] we do
[1:22:08] the preacher is great he's a great
[1:22:10] preacher
[1:22:12] they ain't never one great preacher and
[1:22:14] that's jesus christ himself
[1:22:16] god gave him the gift he didn't give
[1:22:18] himself the gift
[1:22:20] hallelujah oh god help us jesus we must
[1:22:24] glorify the lord jesus christ
[1:22:28] hallelujah is that right paul said i
[1:22:31] ain't nothing
[1:22:34] folks i don't even have nothing and
[1:22:36] everything i had
[1:22:38] i counted as dumb can you imagine a
[1:22:41] doctrine of divinity
[1:22:43] he said i ain't got nothing i can't
[1:22:45] present to you nothing
[1:22:47] any preacher that gives to my uh i've
[1:22:49] been under that inspiration before
[1:22:51] oh yeah you come up to stir the people
[1:22:54] wrong wrong inspiration
[1:22:59] you're not you're not god didn't come
[1:23:00] disturb god knows how to stir a person
[1:23:03] he wants you to preach too he's not
[1:23:06] about stirring up people
[1:23:09] he's about change
[1:23:12] but we'll look at a preaching because he
[1:23:14] can you know dramatically do things and
[1:23:16] i can do it the ability is there
[1:23:20] but i fear god because i want to make
[1:23:23] sure that motive and objective
[1:23:25] is in the right place that god may be
[1:23:27] glorified
[1:23:30] amen did you see the way he did that
[1:23:34] oh it just reminds you of those old
[1:23:35] chickens right those little hands whoo
[1:23:38] can't he crow i mean can he preach
[1:23:41] right and that old chicken
[1:23:46] have you heard how intellectual he
[1:23:48] sounds
[1:23:50] brother said what good is it going to do
[1:23:52] you
[1:23:53] chick is going to win up 49 cents a
[1:23:55] pound
[1:23:57] we all going to the slaughter i tell you
[1:24:00] what
[1:24:00] i'd love to see some chickens on 49 cent
[1:24:02] a pound now
[1:24:06] i'll be running to the store hallelujah
[1:24:10] you see what i'm saying what good is
[1:24:12] your elegance gonna do
[1:24:14] when jesus christ was so humble he was
[1:24:17] nothing like the pharisees and sadducees
[1:24:19] he wasn't an actor he didn't try to put
[1:24:20] nothing on
[1:24:21] he was so normal and so natural that
[1:24:24] judas had to kiss him in order for the
[1:24:25] people to recognize who he was
[1:24:31] you love the lord now i'm almost done
[1:24:33] blame the devil
[1:24:35] this is what we must do it's so late in
[1:24:37] the evening people do y'all believe it's
[1:24:39] late
[1:24:40] how many of y'all let me tell y'all
[1:24:41] something you think prayers
[1:24:43] praying is easy satan knows your prayer
[1:24:46] time
[1:24:47] he comes right there to kneel right by
[1:24:49] you
[1:24:51] he's right there to whisper in your ear
[1:24:54] he's there to make you sleepy
[1:24:56] he's got all his tricks in his bag when
[1:24:58] he come to your prayer meeting
[1:25:01] and if you don't resist him you'll find
[1:25:05] yourself sleep
[1:25:06] you know what i do
[1:25:09] when the lord quickens me okay this is
[1:25:12] the devil
[1:25:13] i said okay devil i'ma let you hear me
[1:25:15] pray
[1:25:17] because if you pray early morning
[1:25:20] whatever
[1:25:21] it takes the holy spirit to really keep
[1:25:24] you awake
[1:25:26] but when you start speaking it whoo the
[1:25:28] devil don't he can't hardly take it
[1:25:30] then vibrations coming from heaven
[1:25:32] shakes him
[1:25:34] sometimes you got to cry out to god like
[1:25:36] he's death in one ear
[1:25:40] yeah in order to get the devil off your
[1:25:42] back
[1:25:43] but once you start cruising oh my you're
[1:25:46] cruising then
[1:25:47] right there is nothing wrong see
[1:25:52] the devil is a troublemaker he's going
[1:25:55] to accuse me before you
[1:25:56] he's going to accuse you before me he's
[1:25:59] going to tell the devil the devil says
[1:26:01] oh see that brother
[1:26:03] and he said yeah your pastor he don't
[1:26:04] even like you
[1:26:08] yeah that's what he said he don't even
[1:26:10] like you
[1:26:12] yeah and you ought to say devil you're a
[1:26:15] lie
[1:26:18] no he's right i don't like any of y'all
[1:26:21] i love you
[1:26:26] i do i really do so if the devil telling
[1:26:28] you stuff like that
[1:26:29] tell him he's a liar you don't
[1:26:33] understand those disciples that were
[1:26:35] with jesus
[1:26:36] they had confidence they had
[1:26:38] disagreements
[1:26:40] but one thing they knew they always
[1:26:41] chosen by god
[1:26:43] and at the end of the day when they were
[1:26:45] all matured up and full of the holy
[1:26:46] ghost
[1:26:47] they were all willing to die for jesus
[1:26:50] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:26:51] there is no way that you're going to
[1:26:52] have a church or people in the church
[1:26:54] amen and not have disagreements
[1:26:57] let's move on and brother brown said
[1:27:00] there was a trouble going on in the
[1:27:01] church
[1:27:03] and he had to go sort it out he had to
[1:27:05] come to the people
[1:27:06] listen it never gets sorted out until
[1:27:10] you
[1:27:10] find the culprit you find the one that's
[1:27:13] causing the problem
[1:27:15] it ain't sister sue and brother james
[1:27:18] and
[1:27:18] john and all these people it ain't it
[1:27:21] ain't your brother
[1:27:22] it's not your sister let's hear what the
[1:27:24] prophet god says
[1:27:27] if they could just realize that's the
[1:27:30] devil that gets between the people
[1:27:34] that's exactly right it's not the people
[1:27:36] if you can
[1:27:37] let a brother see that then he won't
[1:27:40] hold
[1:27:40] enmity against the other fellow he
[1:27:44] he'll feel bad he'll feel like well that
[1:27:47] i feel sorry for my brother see if he
[1:27:50] did
[1:27:51] do wrong why it wasn't the brother
[1:27:54] it was the devil that did that can you
[1:27:56] imagine the kind of perfection
[1:27:59] a shoot up in the among the believers
[1:28:02] because right now
[1:28:03] the problem is we've got all kinds of
[1:28:05] discrepancies between brothers and
[1:28:06] sisters and
[1:28:07] you know they're gone and they come
[1:28:09] devouring each other everywhere
[1:28:12] little stuff little bitty stuff
[1:28:19] but they need to realize we're in a
[1:28:21] battle
[1:28:23] we're in the army of the lord and and
[1:28:25] the things we go through come on
[1:28:27] somebody the bible says you're going to
[1:28:28] cause offense
[1:28:29] anybody know what i'm talking about you
[1:28:31] will offend people even when you don't
[1:28:33] intend to offend them
[1:28:35] it happens but there's nothing wrong
[1:28:38] with saying forgive me i'm sorry
[1:28:40] sometimes people offend people and don't
[1:28:41] even know they offended them
[1:28:44] sometimes we have sensitive days that's
[1:28:48] the truth
[1:28:49] i do
[1:28:53] in those days when this when i'm
[1:28:54] sensitive i'm easy
[1:28:56] to take the word or take somebody's word
[1:28:59] in the wrong way
[1:29:01] oh i'm the only one it doesn't matter
[1:29:04] truth is true and i have to sit back
[1:29:08] sometime and i have to realize
[1:29:10] amen what i'm going through because i'm
[1:29:11] going through the change of life
[1:29:14] still yet i don't think
[1:29:17] it's going to stop until i'm translated
[1:29:20] i don't know
[1:29:20] but you're going to catch me in moves
[1:29:22] that i don't intend to be in oh
[1:29:24] lord help me jesus it's the truth
[1:29:27] you're getting moves you don't even know
[1:29:29] why you got the how you got there
[1:29:31] right and the enemy always sends
[1:29:32] somebody with the wrong word
[1:29:37] it's the truth people but if you don't
[1:29:39] know i love you i can't explain it i
[1:29:41] can't make you know that
[1:29:43] somehow you got to know you say well
[1:29:47] this guy
[1:29:47] did a certain certain thing your brother
[1:29:50] didn't do that and your sister didn't do
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:53] he said that was the devil got into them
[1:29:56] and did it
[1:29:57] so don't blame the brother the sister
[1:30:00] blame the devil
[1:30:01] that's the one who causes it and so now
[1:30:05] in these church
[1:30:06] doctrines now they may be very odd to
[1:30:08] you they may be
[1:30:10] that you wouldn't agree with them at all
[1:30:13] but see that's what we that's what we
[1:30:15] believe we believe it's because
[1:30:17] that's it in the bible and we teach it
[1:30:20] that way
[1:30:21] i mean that's what people do even over
[1:30:23] doctrines they they fuss and they fight
[1:30:25] and they strive with one another
[1:30:27] and they don't even understand that
[1:30:28] that's not god that's the devil
[1:30:31] paul said what you carnal you're
[1:30:34] counter-minded
[1:30:35] galatians why are you doing this why are
[1:30:37] you going through all these changes
[1:30:39] over doctrine do you believe grace
[1:30:42] or do you know grace
[1:30:45] hallelujah you love the lord see we got
[1:30:48] to understand
[1:30:49] this is a crucial time and the the lord
[1:30:52] says
[1:30:52] only the pure in heart shall
[1:30:55] see god i want to see him when he comes
[1:30:59] when he makes himself manifest he's
[1:31:01] already here but when he when that day
[1:31:03] come that he want to
[1:31:04] reveal himself and we see him as he is
[1:31:07] we really see him
[1:31:09] i want to have a pure heart i don't want
[1:31:12] nobody's
[1:31:13] problems and somebody whatever you know
[1:31:16] try to get in the way i'm i'm hurrying
[1:31:18] amen coming from the message amen i hope
[1:31:20] this is all right will the church go
[1:31:22] before the tribulation
[1:31:24] the prophet god says now is later than
[1:31:26] you think
[1:31:27] it's so late until i believe it's almost
[1:31:30] too late in america
[1:31:33] we're just at the end of the road and
[1:31:36] this morning
[1:31:37] while i was preaching on babylon in this
[1:31:39] condition i
[1:31:40] thought it would be very good tonight to
[1:31:42] bring in some of the bible to
[1:31:44] show how close we were to the coming of
[1:31:46] the lord
[1:31:47] and we can see we with our natural eyes
[1:31:51] that
[1:31:52] something is fixing to take place
[1:31:55] now can you see that i see it
[1:31:58] i see it if he saw it way back then you
[1:32:01] know you ought to be able to see
[1:32:02] something
[1:32:04] if you can't see nothing you're blind
[1:32:09] the world is about it's judged we're in
[1:32:12] the judgment
[1:32:13] you call it corona you call it whatever
[1:32:15] you want to call it that's just the
[1:32:17] beginning of
[1:32:18] stuff i think in 1962 brother branham
[1:32:21] said then
[1:32:21] this was the beginning of sorrows huh
[1:32:25] hey it's the truth look what look what
[1:32:28] one of the woes
[1:32:29] did for us rock and roll whoa
[1:32:33] look what it's done to our it has
[1:32:35] transformed
[1:32:36] our country just by
[1:32:40] music and lyrics the devil preached to
[1:32:42] the people
[1:32:43] and changed the character of the people
[1:32:48] hallelujah there is uh
[1:32:51] y'all y'all know how rocky i don't care
[1:32:53] how converted you are
[1:32:55] if you get around rock and roll you
[1:32:57] gotta put on a straight jacket
[1:33:00] why because i have your body moving
[1:33:05] it will i don't know about you but i
[1:33:08] i've i've had it i have had it done it
[1:33:11] happened to me at times not anymore had
[1:33:13] in a long time you're sitting in a
[1:33:14] restaurant you don't even know your foot
[1:33:16] patting
[1:33:19] and then you look down you're like oh
[1:33:20] you get so embarrassed
[1:33:23] it wasn't your intention but this old
[1:33:26] unj
[1:33:27] unregenerated flesh this whole body this
[1:33:31] natural man
[1:33:32] he ain't converted and he loves it
[1:33:36] that's how you got to be watchful even
[1:33:38] in the gospel realm
[1:33:41] because he'll come in there too and when
[1:33:44] you feel like your body want to move in
[1:33:45] ways that ain't godly
[1:33:47] that's it you call a rock and roll
[1:33:52] it's the truth whether y'all like it or
[1:33:55] not is nothing but the truth
[1:33:57] there is such a disturbance among the
[1:34:00] people
[1:34:01] listen do you want somebody to tell you
[1:34:03] the truth or do you want somebody to
[1:34:04] preach you alive
[1:34:06] it's the truth i don't understand it
[1:34:10] but god knows there is such a
[1:34:12] disturbance among the people
[1:34:14] you know we sing jubilee songs i beat my
[1:34:18] tambourine but god knows i beat my
[1:34:20] tambourine on the inspiration of the
[1:34:21] holy spirit
[1:34:22] it's what's in your heart what's
[1:34:24] inspiring the thing
[1:34:26] that causes it to be what it is
[1:34:29] you know it's the truth most of the
[1:34:31] message people they're so afraid to do
[1:34:34] uh upbeat songs
[1:34:37] the answer to when to redeem
[1:34:41] not gathering it and you pick it up when
[1:34:44] the redeemed
[1:34:46] a gathering in it makes you want to jump
[1:34:49] because i'm going to be jumping now i
[1:34:51] don't know about you but i'm going to be
[1:34:52] jumping
[1:34:53] there's nothing wrong with that the
[1:34:56] dance started in heaven
[1:34:59] right okay let's move on
[1:35:02] i got on to that i didn't mean to but
[1:35:04] see there's such a disturbance among the
[1:35:06] people
[1:35:06] it's just hard to try to have a revival
[1:35:10] the churches are so different and at
[1:35:12] each other's throat
[1:35:14] because of denominational barriers and
[1:35:16] the christians are so
[1:35:17] nervous seem like an upset is that right
[1:35:20] even among the message this one believed
[1:35:22] this this one believed that
[1:35:24] and you know what we can't even get
[1:35:26] together and have a glorious time
[1:35:29] because of these little differences
[1:35:33] huh you know what paul asked
[1:35:36] those disciples of john
[1:35:39] he didn't even ask him do you believe in
[1:35:41] the godhead
[1:35:43] do you understand it oh do you know the
[1:35:45] thunder
[1:35:47] you know what he asked him have you
[1:35:49] received the holy ghost
[1:35:51] since you believed
[1:35:55] because god don't care what brand of
[1:35:57] religion he gives the holy ghost to whom
[1:35:59] he will
[1:36:02] hallelujah have you received the holy
[1:36:05] ghost
[1:36:06] because all other stuff doesn't matter
[1:36:09] it's good to know it
[1:36:10] but have you received the seal of the
[1:36:13] holy ghost since you believe
[1:36:16] all the stuff i i'm tired of it you know
[1:36:18] i just wish i could get me some real
[1:36:20] believers
[1:36:20] that can get that can really worship
[1:36:22] together no matter if one
[1:36:24] wearing a blue dress and the other one
[1:36:25] wearing a red one
[1:36:30] it makes sense no sense to me the very
[1:36:33] thing the prophet brother branham
[1:36:34] preached
[1:36:35] about denominationalism in
[1:36:37] organizationalism and you and i
[1:36:39] in this message can't overcome these
[1:36:41] little things
[1:36:43] then what does it make us hypocrites
[1:36:47] hypocrites we're looking at the
[1:36:49] organization's denomination here and
[1:36:51] then here we are with our little
[1:36:52] differences
[1:36:53] and we can't even fellowship not even on
[1:36:55] a picnic level
[1:36:57] it's crazy it's really insane to you and
[1:37:00] me
[1:37:01] who say we believe this message but we
[1:37:03] don't
[1:37:04] understand what brotherly kindness is
[1:37:09] um help me jesus
[1:37:13] one hump camera two ham camera three on
[1:37:16] camera
[1:37:18] all i can see is you got a camera
[1:37:22] at least you got a camera
[1:37:25] but you know it's strange but our lord
[1:37:27] said when these things began to take
[1:37:29] place
[1:37:30] to look up that our redemption was
[1:37:32] drawing nine and as we see his
[1:37:35] great mercy as it's being projected to
[1:37:38] us
[1:37:39] seeing his hand of great signs and
[1:37:41] wonders
[1:37:42] which our eyes will will be open in a
[1:37:45] few minutes to watch
[1:37:47] and then it gives us this most solemn
[1:37:50] consolation
[1:37:51] to know that the god of the bible still
[1:37:53] lives together
[1:37:54] lives today and he loves his children
[1:37:57] and he's giving them warnings and these
[1:37:59] who are spiritual minded
[1:38:01] come out all right
[1:38:06] can i one more what we must understand
[1:38:09] is this
[1:38:10] we're in a warfare how can you not
[1:38:13] expect to be tested
[1:38:15] god said he tries all of his children he
[1:38:18] puts them to the test
[1:38:19] to all the devil no god put you to the
[1:38:22] test
[1:38:23] job god put him to the test
[1:38:26] hallelujah joseph god put him to the
[1:38:29] test
[1:38:30] moses god put him to the test some
[1:38:33] failed
[1:38:34] and some did not but it was god who
[1:38:36] inspired it
[1:38:38] right oh even in joelle
[1:38:42] god said i sent the palmer worm i sent
[1:38:45] the locust in the caterpillar
[1:38:47] god sent it hallelujah and god
[1:38:50] sent those bugs amen to what eat up
[1:38:54] why it was judgment and that's how
[1:38:58] it is god will send it
[1:39:01] right god in this last day say devil you
[1:39:05] can do what you want to do to him
[1:39:07] but touch not the oil and the wine
[1:39:10] god has given him free reigns to you
[1:39:13] except
[1:39:13] do not touch the oil and the wine
[1:39:17] i'm i'm closing on this but listen he
[1:39:19] said
[1:39:20] in the message of the three kinds of
[1:39:22] believers and i'm not going to read the
[1:39:23] whole thing but he says
[1:39:24] sometimes believers put to the test
[1:39:27] not sometimes every time for every son
[1:39:30] that cometh to god
[1:39:32] must be chastened tried and trial child
[1:39:34] trained
[1:39:35] remember the trials the dusty rose the
[1:39:38] hot sun of persecution
[1:39:40] but the loyalty of your heartbeat that
[1:39:43] material
[1:39:44] material till she is ready to go into
[1:39:47] the mold
[1:39:48] god's children in it is made up
[1:39:51] correctly on his word for they are
[1:39:54] living examples and the word of god
[1:39:57] living through them see
[1:39:59] the trials come to shake you to put you
[1:40:02] in uh put you to the very bottom
[1:40:06] to see where you're stand they're tested
[1:40:10] tried every son that coming to god see
[1:40:13] you gotta understand this is not a rose
[1:40:16] of uh a bed or uh ease
[1:40:18] i'm a christian i'm in this message i
[1:40:20] praise the lord i got it made no
[1:40:23] you're gonna be tested till jesus comes
[1:40:26] the greater tests are coming right the
[1:40:29] more you mature the harder the test
[1:40:31] becomes
[1:40:32] is that right oh it's the truth
[1:40:36] so i want to encourage you tonight let
[1:40:39] the word of god caught you
[1:40:41] mold you shake you whatever it needs to
[1:40:44] do
[1:40:44] let it do it you just lay there and say
[1:40:47] oh
[1:40:47] you know that's how they got to you know
[1:40:49] put people even under anesthesia when
[1:40:51] they operating on them
[1:40:53] you know god don't do that
[1:40:59] he don't give you no stimulation amen to
[1:41:01] stop
[1:41:02] the pain that's coming you understand me
[1:41:04] sometimes
[1:41:05] he'll do a little something for you
[1:41:08] yeah but most of the time you're gonna
[1:41:11] feel it
[1:41:12] heart pain is heart growth it's what god
[1:41:16] does
[1:41:17] he ain't gonna take somebody that don't
[1:41:18] mean nothing to you and cause you to
[1:41:20] no no he gets somebody that's close this
[1:41:23] is the thing that i
[1:41:24] i i if we overlook none of us
[1:41:27] understand the pain
[1:41:37] you know that's what they said about
[1:41:38] brother branham you can't you couldn't
[1:41:39] even tell his
[1:41:40] enemy from his friend
[1:41:45] that's the real deal that's the way
[1:41:47] we're supposed to be
[1:41:49] y'all understand me it's true who would
[1:41:52] have known judas was going to betray
[1:41:55] and then jesus christ lets him come
[1:41:57] right up there and
[1:41:58] he don't give him a high five or just a
[1:42:00] handshake he comes and he
[1:42:01] kisses him on the jaw
[1:42:04] and he said in such a gentleman a gentle
[1:42:07] uh men
[1:42:08] way uh judas you betrayed your
[1:42:11] friend with the kid he wasn't screaming
[1:42:14] and hollering oh you
[1:42:15] devil no
[1:42:20] he let him do it he was a gentleman he
[1:42:22] was a sheep
[1:42:25] and that's what we failed see we must
[1:42:27] understand we must remain
[1:42:29] under the sheep nature
[1:42:32] you might have to fight for the might
[1:42:34] fight to keep it but you got to remain
[1:42:35] there
[1:42:36] and let me tell you something we have
[1:42:38] not because you asked not
[1:42:39] you can't fool god but your heart i'm
[1:42:42] telling you
[1:42:43] you can say all the kind words you want
[1:42:46] to god knows that heart
[1:42:48] and when a man really wants the holy
[1:42:50] ghost really wants the holy ghost
[1:42:53] to really want to give up their idols
[1:42:55] because every demon that we worship
[1:42:57] it becomes an idol but you got to be
[1:43:00] willing to give up your idol break them
[1:43:02] up put them in the fire whatever you
[1:43:03] must do
[1:43:04] when you come to jesus you got to give
[1:43:05] up all the things you worship
[1:43:08] you love the lord this is the last day
[1:43:12] and i i can't even express what i'm
[1:43:14] feeling tonight
[1:43:15] how urgent it is for us amen to really
[1:43:18] refocus and rededicate our lives to
[1:43:21] christ
[1:43:22] it should be done on a daily basis
[1:43:24] really

[1:43:28] come

[1:43:40] because he knew us from the beginning
[1:43:41] all those things sounds good but
