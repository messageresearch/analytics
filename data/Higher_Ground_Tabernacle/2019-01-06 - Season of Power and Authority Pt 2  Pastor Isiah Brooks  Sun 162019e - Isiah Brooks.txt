TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you a man he brought me out of the miry clay a man I am definitely gaga set me free a man we're just going to get right into the word of the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus Amy will be coming from second Peter the third chapter second Peter the third chapter hallelujah thank you Jesus we have come from the 3rd 3rd 2nd Peter 3rd chapter we began reading at the 11th first surely God is embedded to us then we've been to ourselves amen some reason I've got the wrong place first for some reason I'm skipping Peter yeah seeing then beginning at the 11 first that all these things shall be dissolved what manner person ar e to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace and without spot and blameless an account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation even as our brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him have written on to you hallelujah that's just start there by God's grace father God we thank you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves we pray Lord God this evening that you break and destroy the yokes of the enemy bless those who have come out Lord is just a few of tonight but God we all have one thing in common and that is we come to see you let your perfect will be done here tonight Lord feed your people give us grace to move completely out of your way and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we're not going to be long tonight but as we started this morning on that message Amen season of power and authority and I believe that with all of my heart of course we realized by God's grace it is not by power nor by might but by God's Spirit it's not him who will it nor he that run it but God that shows mercy and one of the things that we must come to know is that we must come to see who we really are in the story by God's grace we told this morning when it came to Sampson at some point in time I believe Sampson lost his identity and in that process in which he lost his identity he began to flirt around with the world and he was caught by Delilah Delilah is was a something that no doubt look appealing to the eye and of course you know Satan hides and beauty amen and surely enough Delilah seduced Samson in telling in in him telling her all of his secrets and as we said we you may not look at it as being a secret of God but it's by this message we understand the divine nature of God no other Church preaches it no else nowhere else outside of this message and this was a message given to us through our prophet that we may be partakers of God's divine nature it is our secret the world doesn't know anything about it they think if you jump in you shout you got it they think if you speak in tongues you got it the if you run up and down now you got it they think that if you do these things amen you have the Holy Spirit but God by God's grace has given us amen our entrance our understanding amen of what God requires of us is that Alright now we spoke this morning that we talked about identity an identity is very important right now because a lot of people want to identify themselves with a message Church God amen is not identified with a group of people not in this day God is identified with individuals is that Alright even because our identity is important our dinner identity is not Methodist it is not Baptist it is not Presbyterian it is not Pentecostal it is not message Howard entity is Christ identification is very important as I said it is being the same as one described in other words amen my description of you must fit in words what I see with my eyes or perceive with my intellect it cannot go beyond that for an example if you are a horse and I described a dog well the dog description will not fit him in the horse description because if they both have four legs they both have two eyes they have loves but there are differences in so much so that however I describe whatever I describe your eyes and your intellect will be able to determine which is the horse and which is the dog amen and that's what this Christian that's why to identification and description is so important the word described things amen the Word of God describe Amen Malik for that he would turn the hearts of the children to the father's and the father's to the children and he the Bible tells us Amen that he will come in a day when when the earth will be destroyed by fire he has finished his ministry is that right Amen so we know by God's description of Malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 that William Brennan fit that description and his identification was Christ he was to come in amen and and introduced this wicked generation again to Christ because remember in Revelations to third chapter Amen we find that Laodicea had put Jesus out of the church so the church world didn't know Christ he wasn't in there he they saw a system they saw something that man had put together and called it Christ but it wasn't Christ they what they had excuse me but by way of the internet what they had they had what they call Baptists they had what they called Methodists they had what they call Pentecostal and in our day we've got what we call message but understand message doesn't necessarily describes Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is a spirit he is God there's that right how do you know you have the accurate description in you of Jesus Christ Hebrews says and then according to Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever see that's how that was God's description even when it came to the Prophet he didn't have his own thing he used the scripture to describe who he was and what was living on the inside of him right and he goes on to say that Jesus Christ would do the same thing he did yesterday today he's a God that changes not if he healed yesterday he-here someday if he delivered yesterday he delivers today amen so we realized by God's grace Amen your identification in your description must be compatible it must work together is that right if I had a dog that meow that was something would be wrong with that because dog barks in cat meow right so you and I understand if we say we are the bride of Jesus Christ and we're giving forth a different sound then the word is sounding remember right uncertain sound and we give us different sound then the word is sounding then it shows that something is wrong with the description and the identification cannot be matched up is that right you heard me use this illustration before even in our younger days in elementary we taught we were taught what was the same and you would always have these little cars two would be blue and one would be red but they would have the same everything except for the color and you had to draw a line to the one that was the same like if this is on the left side it would be Allah if it was blue and then you had a red and a yellow and another blue you had to draw the lines to the cars that was exactly the same that's important amen because it had the same color the same descriptions everything about it had to be saying it couldn't it is not the same if one is ran in one is blue it is not the same is what if one is yellow and one is red it has to be the same in every aspect so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah and God knew that the only way that he could bring it and produce this is that he had to put the very same life in the bride of Jesus Christ it was also in the bride I'm excuse me you see them SEP there's also in Jesus Christ he could not make the same thing by putting a different kind of life in it right so his life was supernatural that's why the Bible says Amen if that same spirit that was in Christ Jesus if it be in you as it quicken his body it will also quicken your mortal body meaning it meant that the same life will produce the same life if it's in you right hallelujah so descriptions is very important because it would tell or depict what's what's been spoken or what's been written of the particular thing that you're trying to convey or make people see for an example little red little haha barista said red robbing hood right remember a little girl the little girl Red Robin Hood the little Riding Hood Red Riding Hood I thought her name was Robin okay [Laughter] amen so we must realize by God's grace her hood was red it wasn't blue it wasn't yellow it wasn't green Robin had on a red hood so you must realize by God's grace Amen so it described her and you know we had a picture of her even to this day I can see this little girl with the red hood on her head a man and she um you know the whole story but it described her right so you say one of the things of poetry when it comes to writing compositions or whatever the case may be you you always had to be what they call these Krypton and your words had to flow to connect with something to produce a picture right so that's how the Bible is the Bible is that way it leads flows and it produces a picture is that right now you must understand that and you've heard me say this before in Isaiah pinkies up when the Bible says Amen that he he treads the winepress alone right and I said gave that description of this lamb this person that would come and be crucified about said we looked upon him as though it was ourselves we we despised him you know and and and so in that description it produces Christ in other words if Christ had never suffered Calvary he would not have been the right one you understand me they wanted to kill him by throwing him over a cliff right and he passed through the crowd is that right they wanted he all Satan wanted him to die by jumping off the pinnacle but you see if he had done so he will have not been the Jesus Christ that was written in the prophecies hallelujah he a man had to be a lamb acquainted with grief you see them saying he had to be one that God was building and working and meant to literally be able to be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he couldn't take a shortcut he had to go to Calvary he had to suffer in order to be the Lamb of God is that right oh I think it was brother Keith and I were just talking the other day about how that when Abraham took Isaac up on the mountain I don't know that meant that little boy who however old he was he loved his dad and he trusted his daddy and you know he had to be faithful he meant to God to realize him and his dad was ready to kill him I don't know nobody I [Laughter] don't know anyone that I know of a men that will lay down a daddy or no daddy he had to be under conviction and anointed by God to live there with his daddy having his arm drawn back with the knife but what God was doing he was literally painting a picture of the Christ that was to come you see I'm saying now you I'm getting to something because every shadow in this Bible must depict you every shadow in the Bible must speak of you in a reality form in a shadow form we are the reality of the shadow like Jesus was a reality of the shadow right we are the reality of the shadow so in other words our identification is found in the scripture by way of the shadows there we ought to know how to perform and then we ought to know how to live because however they lived here in the Old Testament was a shadow of what we supposed to live and be in the New Testament is that right identity is important if you cannot identify with Rahab something's wrong you'll never get the victory hallelujah you must see yourself as a ill-fame woman trapped behind walls hallelujah and you need the blood of Jesus Christ to escape hallelujah if you cannot see yourself as a Ruth who was a adulterer hallelujah yes she was a priestess in her listen poor to God Hitman's she was in fame she was an outcast from the economy of God God told Israel not to have anything to do with Ruth no more Vitus hallelujah but the grace of God found her hallelujah seek out a whole yo hear what I'm saying it wasn't something that just happened everything was planned by God y'all heard me this morning it's for his own pleasure God knew which one was going to stay and God knew which one was going to leave hallelujah and that's why I try to tell people we have a type in the shadows here is Oprah on one in and God on the other Ruth on the other is that right we see Oprah out there making millions and billions y'all hear what I'm saying but yet God has what we call a Ruth on the scene your God would be is that right that's what we tell them the Israel today Israel your God is my god your people is my people wherever you lay I'll a hallelujah we have the same promise is that right and we're going to marry boy ass because Boyz II Men is redeeming Israel and a Gentile at the same time see what I'm saying but we were sold out to the old fashioned way they'll forgive me for that watch we were sold out to the old fashioned way our identity is in this word and we don't want to deviate from it we love the fact that God sent us a prophet because we understand what a prophet is he is the revealer of God's Word or the instrument in which God uses to reveal the word and what he's doing you say what God always used prophets he told Noah go bill or knock at the same time you tell the world is going to rain right if they had all only listened to Noah they would have escaped the horrible thing now right now scientists are still trying to figure how high the Arctic's became frozen so quickly and we know the answer we know the answer in the days of Noah a man then explosion took it and threw it outside out of his orbit and it tilted hallelujah and even to this day is staggering like a drunkard huh see we know the answer they say millions of years ago and tens of thousands of years ago it's just been over a little over 6,000 hallelujah but scientists is where it was where men go wrong they trust more in science than they do the Word of God let me hurry up with this okay now it's important I keep drifting a little bit but God knows where I'm going with this the property God says in God's hiding himself in simplicity he there's a church is Christ's body it's an individual among other individuals that is born in the kingdom of God get come from the inside out it's automatically lived in other words I don't have to beg you to live right I don't have to force you to live right I don't have to threaten you to live right if you're born into the kingdom of God you understand me like I was sharing with the church their two kingdoms there's the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is different from the kingdom of heaven there'll be some saved out of the kingdom of heaven but all is saved in the kingdom of God right because the kingdom of God is within you is the Holy Ghost it's his joy peace and righteousness in the Holy Ghost right but the kingdom of heaven is people from distant nomination that denomination who basically large in this great tree right everybody out there is feeling the blessings of Calvary we're living by the blessings of Calvary the sinners are living by the blessings of Calvary everything is living by the blessings of Calvary but everybody won't receive the blessings of Calvary hallelujah is that Alright that comes from the inside out it's automatically lived you don't ask a sheep to bear wool or manufacture wall I mean the sheep don't have to manufacture wool they say now my master want me to have some world this year I've got to get busy no the only thing he has to do is just remain a sheep that's right the wool will automaticaly he will bear it because he's a seat and we're not asked to manufacture fruit we're supposed to produce fruit see see bear fruit see we supposed to bear fruit and as long as you are a fruit tree of God with God's Word God's Word will vindicate itself in a bear fruit as long as the world is in there jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you that's what you will and it shall be done see you don't manufacture it you you work yourself not up to it it's just actually there and it goes on and on amen right we're living in the age of identity hallelujah like I was saying with somebody out the other day and I don't I'm not sure if it was brother rich or not but my point is amen you don't win it when it comes to identity it is who you are and this is the age of identity everybody wants to be identified they want they want I can credit for doing whatever they do Alleluia you know and y'all know Hardy is it so personal now iPhone and iPad and you know hi something everybody wants something right is what I do and what I've done I've achieved yes it's mine Cooper wait we don't understand but we're living actually in the time like Estonia where God is not hardly ever spoken of and in this world if he here spoken of is in mockery hallelujah but everybody's talking about their achievements and they fail to see God's achievement right it's the truth like I said the men who built built the fake arm get more credit than the men who built the real one he goes down in history when the rich the men who did the real arm don't even they don't talk about him don't want to hear about him don't want his name mentioned hallelujah but God has a different way of identifying himself ah God is identified in his people when Satan thinks he's got God will this is when God raises up a standard hallelujah because the devil really thinks he can defeat God but God can never be defeated this is the year of power this is the year of strength this is the hour amen I believe even the bride will become more and more and more and more in tune to who she is and when it finally strike hallelujah she'll be stronger than Samson ever thought about it why she is Sevenfold hello she is seventh Oh powerful than the original Church I'm gonna say it again she is seven for more powerful than the original Church because she carries all of him each church had a portion of God but she has it all she comes to the false patch of Christ it is because of her God brings the rapture hallelujah as soon as she meets perfection God brings the rapture is that right where that fruit comes to its maturity God said quickly thrust in the sickle hallelujah let's gather it now so it won't spoil hallelujah amen think about it people of God right now you may not be right but endure but God is grooming you you're laying in the presence of the Sun and the Sun is getting rid of all of the green stuff in you why love these old days it won't be long but the man of the harvest woo he's gonna bring it he's going to gather us hallelujah and listen we're all most there when I was looking I was looking at this thing and I thought God brought to my mind he brought to me how that in this last day we you know it was some people think before I get to that age but let me say this when God began to identify and scripturally speak of people for example when God said a virgin shall conceive well it could not have been someone who had been with a mate of any kind it had to be a person here who never knew a man it had to be a virgin then brother Branham said that in that day Mary wasn't the only virgin there were other virgins but you see it had to be the right one and had to be the one that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world in other words you you you know it just couldn't have been another Isaac I'm sure you're not the only Isaac named Isaac but it had to be the real Isaac that God had in this mind you know it had to be that like that you know you're I'm sure they're more Richardson and I'm sure they're more kissing you know all of us have names that other people have names but that has the same name but it could not have been that's more than one Isaiah Brooks believe it or not it is I've looked it up but there's only one Isaiah Brooks that I know of that was in the mind of God it was God's choosing it was God election and I had to fit the description I had to be one that was hearing the word I would jump right to it right because when the light strikes to see amen it causes a reaction that you and I cannot even control that's how it was with Mary when the last night angel came to Mary says listen you that one God showed me the other Mary that is supposed to bring forth Jesus hallelujah and you know I know how you're gonna respond but I'm going to talk to you anyhow yeah mary says well you know how is this thing gonna be you know I've seen that I don't know a man that means you could have said well we know you haven't made a man that's why you qualified for this position but not only that God saw you in his mind before the foundation the world and you the only one that can't produce him whoo God chose you as an incubator y'all hear what I'm saying that's what I'm saying about us tonight God has already described you he's already identified you when the word came to you that became your identification when oh when the word came to you and chose you that was God's saying you are identified and you are now in the description of what I call bride hallelujah and so in order for me to make this happen I must feel you with my Holy Spirit hallelujah it's not that power is not by light is by Holy Spirit I have chosen you you didn't choose me and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete don't you worry you're gonna go through your seasons you're gonna have your valleys but I love were there for you yea though I walk through the the shadow death I'll fear no evil for thou see that's your food that's your meat and I know that the word that I placed in you feeds off of this I have produced the life in you that can only be satisfied by this so I know I'm not gonna work at it there's no place or worrying me only confident that what I put in you will produce and become the very manifestation of my purpose for you being born Oh somebody oughta shout now so you see it ain't no chance thank God it's not rolling dice but God is telling the people I chose you you are bride believe me I say you are bride just like Mary she couldn't comprehend how this virgin was called a conceived and the prophecy the angel said believe me this thing that I'm telling you about is of the Holy Ghost and he will overshadow you and he will produce this child hallelujah so you must understand it's the Holy Ghost that will produce Christ in you hey man see so you and I must realize by God's grace we're living in a time now remember the world is going to burn I read that scripture the world is going to burn is that right hallelujah but you know the Bible tells us also that God will keep and protect us he protected nor in his day is that right amen he protected those ones in Moses day that second Exodus we're in the third Exodus where the world will be destroyed by fire it's a promise now you think God would promise a fire baptism for the world and we'll give you one when he promised it he promised you a fire baptism why because he know you cannot get rid of the demons on your own it takes fire they're super Metro Devils it takes fire to get rid of the demons hallelujah amen you feel better than a little bit brother I know you're struggling over there but God got God gonna touch you amen so you realized by God's grace that God a man has everything under control right amen you and I were supposed to be in the clubs of the rock in a resting place not a place of struggling in a resting place having confidence that he this that sherry was going to perform it he will perform it hallelujah it's okay yeah when I was studying this I got a hurry God God spoke to me about the Passover and I thought Passover and I'm talking about season of power but you see as long as the Jews was under the control of Pharaoh they couldn't do what they want to do they couldn't even worship God remember Moses asked Pharaoh says let me let me take him and let us go worshiping and Pharaoh wanted Moses to leave something behind but Moses no no no when I leave I'm not leaving one roof behind and so we find out that here they were in bondage they were enslaved by themselves and really amen if you look at Egypt Egypt was also not only a type of bondage but it was like a type of hell because they were whipped they were beaten they were driven you know they were starved everything that you can imagine with that would take place in hell was happening in Egypt according to the children of Israel so remember amen when the past overcame amen it was the slaying of a lamb and putting the bra our blood on the doorpost and of the lentil and this land was called the Paschal Lamb is that right amen and you must you must understand that it is a measure how can I say it this Paschal Lamb was basically working with with Egypt and in in excusing that Egypt Easter amen it was it was also dealing with a resurrection so when you and I are talking about a Paschal Lamb is also it talks about a festivity it was something that they celebrated now while they were going through it it wasn't so great it wasn't so grand you know God is gonna send us a deliverer and understand that's what I want people to understand if you don't cry out God won't hear you not that God can read your thoughts God wants you to cry out is that right because the Bible said that God said and unto Moses I have heard the cry of the people hallelujah they wanted deliverance and until you want to live you you if your desperation don't make you cry to get free you're not desperate enough hello y'all hear me you got a cry you gotta be desperate to be delivered if you're not desperate guarding gonna hear you it is the desperate cry of his children that makes him here I have heard their cry and I have come down to deliver Oh hallelujah so you and I must understand Amen when the blood would place on the doorpost a little what did the children of Israel do Moses didn't declare didn't have them to do nothing but to slay a lamb and put their blood on the doorpost a little that was in they was just as evil as they ever lost but that blood covered them that blood protected them you think they think you because you saved your flesh you're saying you gotta kill it you can't trust a soul boy you better kill it it could be sanctified today and sinful tomorrow so we realized by God's grace amen all that that's why I said this morning at the end of the day when you get ready to cross over you will not have a list of all the great things you've ever done for God absolutely not the only thing you're gonna have is Lord you gave me the here's my token Lord let me cross over that's it well is that not true the Bible said everyone that came is his Lord have we not done these mighty works in your name he said you are evil thing get away from me I don't even know you because if you realize if any Christian any Christian no there is no good thing in your flesh everything that is done good is of God and God gets all the glory what I'm gonna say Lord you know in that concert I sang so good your Holy Spirit came that's not a preacher weather of the case that's nonsense hallelujah those elders 24 elders knew better right when y'all words were that they threw down their cups and fell on the flo instantaneously because they knew it was the grace of God that God I'm there what nothing they did just was blessed because they were there you know God God is here God rewards you for allowing him to use your body and yet he's the one that gave it to you now that's a win-win there mmm ooh Passover y'all understand what I'm saying because what we're doing is it we really we call it Passover but you and I are experiencing that's why don't understand why people be so sad and everything when God has delivered you and guess what all you can see is the blood of Jesus Christ that protects you that in itself eat'em that make a real Christian jump for joy jump for joy when you realize that the only reason why you're not dead right now is because of the blood of Jesus Christ protecting the raft of God away from you what I see the Blood I pass over you and then the devil tell you you ain't got nothing I may not have wealth riches and untold but I got the blood hey in the man in his right mind know you right now every one of us need should have been dead where long ago oh I'm a Christian how many mistakes you've made since you've been a Christian and yet God spared your life you must see something and surely ain't you you think because you might you might think you may be good-looking God don't save you cuz you're good-looking what was that what was that what was that which that was that Martin was it Martin I can't remember the one that was really not so good-looking out of all the seven and the people even really cute I think it was Martin Luther whichever not look whatever one it was they were right in the papers how ugly he was and can't understand why people come to see it and this this guy came in and he says you know you know the papers right we can't understand why people come to see you he said the truth of the matter is they don't come to see me they come to see Christ hallelujah they're not looking I don't get how ugly I might be it ain't that this what they looking at they looking at what's inside what's coming out of you that's what people want to see they want to see a life and when they see their life you become the most beautiful thing they ever seen is this okay let me hurry up let me hurry up now listen psalms of psalms psalm 16 7 says I will bless the Lord who have given me counsel my rains also instruct me in the night season and I told you amen their season sometimes when you can't see there's something that God connects you to he knows how to pool your range you know what I'm saying you know what the rain is when you got that Bridal thing in your mouth and and the god that's riding the horse he pulls it which way - left right left right right that's how God's Word he instruct me and then he give me some time I he may not speak to me brother he may not even say a word but he knows how to turn on me he knows how to pull me left or right he knows how to direct me even in the night season huh Oh what is it how did Samson know that there were two pillows he couldn't see he was blind he told that little lad direct me to those two pillows Oh what was it it was God in the night season direct in him so he could be the right position to gain his victory range the controlling or directing power right the government he was the government he had the government on the shoulder he's the one that's directing us and going in the right way and sometimes you might think you're going the wrong way when you're going the right way is that right amen look like Abraham and lot look like lot chose the better lane ha ha oh but that's not true it was Abraham his land was not so nice but that's where God met him those seasons will come listen then you're 2 and 21 I love the way he says it he changes the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth the wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know that no understanding and you know when God gave me that scripture he brought me to our Russia President Putin and president trunk now I'm just going to say what he said to me you don't have to accept it but even because a man is ordained of God doesn't mean he's a Christian or he saved hello that's the truth Pharoah was directed by God is that right is that right never kanessa was directed by God he even made a statement your God is God but it doesn't mean he was saved right so you and I must understand when God places people at servants that's all they are servants right Amen so I looked at Putin which I didn't know what the meaning of Putin was until I looked it up then I was really surprised it means to force or drive some course of action and they use this to put an army to flight in other words he is one that forces and pushes for an action think about what I'm saying think about what what we're going through right now that's why God put him there that's why God called him all right he's gonna put it he's gonna make it he's going to make the prophecies of God come to pass is that right cuz that's what the Bible said God put in the hearts of all of teen Kings to give their authority over to the Beast God did it and God has placed in this man even if he is not the one that pushed the button he's pushing it he's making it happen right oh come on somebody and you know you said what do you mean even when Obama was in office and they passed that law y'all know what I'm saying well same-sex could marry and I like you know even Putin say America ought to be ashamed of themselves they know better than that a man who we say is a heathen but he was put there to bring us to our knees and the whole time he got into our our mess and messed it up more so and trunk means to devise deceitfully or dishonestly to excel to surpass and out do hello it doesn't mean just the truck bumper but papa but it's like in when you doing car Trump up you got a hand you got something I don't know nothing about cars so I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to that how to play it but the way I read it is like when you when you you're playing this trump game you already got something going in your hand deceitfully and you carry on like you got more than what you got until somebody expose what they don't have and then you show them what they what you've got see so you got to understand these names are not just there just to be there I it's like when when when when Israel was in Babylon they had to honor the Babylonian king God said if you don't honor the Babylonian king I'm gonna kill you imma let them kill you you know and because I'm speaking the way I'm speaking it's not because I dishonor Trump or dishonor Putin truth is what it is I'm honoring what I see God doing through the land you hear what I'm saying I want a rapture and I know that certain conditions must be met globally before we enter into our rapture I said this morning amen even though this is Satan's Eden brother Branham also calls this the rapture age the age of the rapture that means this age cannot close without the rapture taking place and here we are here we are like God was using Noah to build an ark here's God building an ark he's building a people he's building a tabernacle because that's all they are cloth the ark was just another form of a tabernacle where animals and people would live this is a tabernacle where God will live and God is building this tabernacle to do what escape the fire mmm the move is on the bride is that Alright said anyone's gonna be long and I'm almost done what we must do is we need to start facing the prophecies we must take everything that brother Branham said that you and I are to be and we must allow the Holy Spirit to apply it [Music] we must allow the Holy Spirit to apply it now you take for an example because I don't want you to take the human element out of this and that's where people get rid of funny they don't know that Jesus Christ was a man yet he was God and you look at Peter and you fail to see that Peter was a man Peter denied Jesus three times even when God told him he was going to deny me he didn't believe he would but their prophecies couldn't be broken Jesus had already spoken it you're going to deny me three times and before the crow right so it had to be but it never took away who he was or his identity because Jesus had already previously told them that you were with me before the foundation of the world he had already told them that you may not know me but I know you cuz you were with me right and so he told them that so they had an identity so now he's telling all of us the same thing we were with you you were with me I was with you he even praised in Saint John 17 Father make them one even as we are one he talks about he says Lord the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world Lord I give this glory to them but is it he's trying to get you to see your identity yes we are men we are human we are flesh amen but at the same time we are God I didn't say gods I say God because we are the housing of the Living God hallelujah we are the very housing of the Living God is that right so you've got to realize that when Israel was moving in those tents that was God intense that was God in you that was God in me God intense but at a at a time period change the season changed they no longer went around in tents why because David said Lord it ain't right that everybody's building all of these fine houses got a nice one and you don't have one and then God comes along and says can any any household mean heaven is my throne and earth this is my footstool but I have provided myself a body hallelujah amen so now the tents were done away with why because in shadow and time there was gonna come a New Jerusalem and read a little quote and I let you go now if the churches will forget their Creed's and forget their dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then it would come affect it to them but see Jesus said you with your traditions make the Word of God and not effective to you well that's the same thing today with spiritual Eve see spiritual bride of today so call the church she takes the Word of God and she won't accept it and she accept Dogma instead therefore the word is not affected to her see because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work now now what we need today see that's the problem if you're gonna inject your Creed you're gonna check your Dogma it is not gonna work Alleluia is that right oh my the spiritual bride that was born on the day of Pentecost of Christ before he could get to her what happened she fell at wrong what is it she added to the word the God said with his stripes you'll heal you heal amen if God said you brought your bride ain't no use an end to it if God said you saved by grace you're saved by grace not grace plus grace right now but in the day there is no but listen but now but in the day there is to come a super royal seed of Abraham that's exactly what I'll be it'll be would be a royal bride to the Royal to the Royal promise son as I spoke last night I won't be it won't be a natural seed it'll be spiritual seed there's to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the royal seed of the ROI of faith of Abraham's we're all your son she is to come on the scene in the last days and time and place is a promise that's given to her time and place is a promise that's given to her right according to Malachi 4 a scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the opposite Onex fathers again there is to rise on the scene in the power of elijah that arrives on the scene a willingness men that have come out and will have a message that a run right straight back to the word again that's the hour we're living in hallelujah he goes on to say the resurrection is sure in another message it's a gamma t and we have the earnest of it now as the holy spirit comes in and identify us as God redeemed person see he did say God redeemed persons he said God redeemed person amen and when you received the Holy Ghost you seal to the journey it's over that is your token that you hold hallelujah and so I'm just going to close there he said that shows your fear has been paid you are redeemed character Satan has no business with you none whatsoever just pick up your token and show him my healing is paid for my trip to Glory is to write so when you actually see that the blood of Jesus covers you from earth to glory you are I ain't none no no uses fearing nothing people it is it's not it Shelby it is how theophanies are right there waiting on us it is oh but I'm so messed up yeah every one of us in here is if it wasn't for the grace of God where would we be if it wasn't for the cleansing power how many of y'all have overcome by your own might none of us we have overcome because of the blood of Jesus Christ and when you hear me say blood I'm talking about the life of Christ which means the Holy Ghost that is the spiritual blood of Christ that cleanses us from all our unrighteousness and you and I know Amen that what I said even about Trump even about our Putin there it's right yeah I wouldn't never thought of it God gave it and so I want you to understand that they're in their place they're exactly doing they're doing exactly what God wants them to do so what do you say in all things give thanks it is what God want us to do hallelujah amen you're not good because you're good you're good because God made you good and how did he make you good by putting a good one in you outside of that you ain't nothing I'm nothing right and I just thank God that God didn't choose me and it was more things I could say but I'm so glad that God didn't choose me I'm telling you this thing is being pushed and I want you to understand it has to be pushed America has to be pushed we've got to be pushed because you know what we've been the boss for a long time now God is pushing everything to a place of war and it got it has to come but thank God why do you think brother venom said we will be out of here before one bomb drop that means somebody gonna push a button it's our season this is Satan's e-even but we are in what we call the rapture age light and darkness has been separated boo let us stand we are eating off of the tree of what life the world eats off of the tree of good and evil hallelujah is that right father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for you love I thank you Lord Jesus because you're so good to me you've been better to me than I've been to myself thank you Father for your amazing grace in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you think about how Paul used the political realm to get to Rome God told him he had to go to Rome Paul what was the man that uh said you almost convinced me to be a Christian what was he saying I can't think right now amen and Paul refused to be free he says no I want to go and they say they thought he was crazy he said I'm saying but God had those people in position and Paul knew he was going to Nero's chocolate chopping block he knew he wasn't going to escape but God told him but you got to go witness to him you see what I'm saying God set these people up set everything up and I read the scripture he sets up kings and brings them down amen just like he everything is gonna flow into his plan is that right but now the movies on the bride if God warned it for the Brenham to do what some people say he was gonna do he would have left him here but the power of what was in him is now in us we bring the rapture own folks is that right let me say it like brother branham say that I'm gonna let you go he said the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride you know how that is right because he is a resurrection how do we thank you right now we thank you for being so good to us Lord bless this service bless your people may the word of God find good place in their hearts we love you Jesus you're the best friend we ever had Lord you the only one they can stick closer than a brother I've got good friends here Lord I got good family here but father Jesus my lord you above them all and we thank you Lord God for your amazing grace for talking to someone like me I appreciate you Jesus I love you the Lord we ask one thing is that this fight we're speaking of this battle this courage the strength of this 'message let it live through us long not just me but everyone that that hears this message may something happened to him Lord that there they'll be changed that nothing will remain the same how mercy upon us now Lord we thank you for your amazing grace in Jesus Christ's name we pray just keep on praying come on brother for the law just keep on oh the law
