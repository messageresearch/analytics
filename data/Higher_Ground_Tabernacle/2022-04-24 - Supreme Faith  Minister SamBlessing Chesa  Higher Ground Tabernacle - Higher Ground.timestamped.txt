[48:23] oh
[48:27] [Music]
[48:40] oh
[48:44] [Music]
[48:49] know
[48:51] [Music]
[49:08] [Music]
[49:22] [Music]
[49:33] oh
[49:51] just before we start reading those bowel
[49:53] heads
[50:09] is
[50:38] lord look at your children they could
[50:39] have been other places doing other
[50:41] things
[50:45] they decided to come into your house
[50:49] that's in your house that's what
[50:50] salvation is
[51:19] because we know the letter alone
[51:48] because
[52:01] in this place
[52:12] amen
[52:13] hebrews in chapter 1
[52:17] hebrews chapter 11 verse 1.
[52:20] the bible says now faith is the
[52:21] substance of things hoped for the
[52:23] evidence of things not seen
[52:30] for by it the elders obtained a good
[52:32] report
[52:40] through faith we understand the works
[52:42] the worlds were framed by the word of
[52:44] god so that the things which are sin
[52:47] were not made
[52:48] of things which do appear amen
[52:58] by faith offered unto god a more
[53:00] excellent sacrifice than cain
[53:02] by which he obtained witness that he was
[53:05] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[53:08] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[53:10] amen
[53:23] by faith enoch was translated that he
[53:25] would not see death and he was not found
[53:29] because god had translated him for
[53:31] before his translation he had his
[53:33] testimony that he pleased him amen
[53:48] but without faith it is impossible to
[53:50] please him amen
[53:52] foreign
[53:56] for he that coming to god must believe
[53:58] that he is and that he is a reward of
[54:00] them that diligently seek him
[54:03] to exist
[54:07] but without faith it is impossible to
[54:09] please him
[54:13] faith is the revelation
[54:15] without revelation you cannot please god
[54:20] amen the lord blessings to the reading
[54:22] of his word
[54:34] amen
[54:36] in the book of hebrews when we were
[54:37] reading
[54:40] paul is talking about all the sages of
[54:43] old paul
[54:47] how they please god because they had
[54:48] faith
[55:00] and the bible tells us that you and me
[55:02] without faith we cannot please god at
[55:04] all
[55:07] so for you to please god it is required
[55:10] and it is mandatory that you have faith
[55:17] amen
[55:18] in the book of romans paul tells us that
[55:23] faith comes by hearing and by hearing
[55:25] the word of god
[55:31] in many places the prophet of god tells
[55:32] us that faith is our victory
[55:36] so since satan knows that faith comes by
[55:38] hearing the word
[55:44] and that faith is your victory
[56:15] making sure that we are distracted
[56:20] amen and many times we think faith as a
[56:23] as something that that is uh
[56:25] um
[56:26] something that is abstract something
[56:28] that's intangible
[56:33] but here paul tells us that faith is the
[56:35] substance of things hopeful
[56:41] in your early education they told you
[56:43] substance is something you can hold
[56:49] something that you know for sure it is
[56:51] present it is there
[56:55] so faith is the tangible part of the
[56:57] thing that you are hoping for that's
[56:58] right
[57:02] amen and many times when we think about
[57:04] it and we're just look we think faith is
[57:05] a very difficult thing
[57:11] but faith is simple
[57:13] if we open our bibles to the book of
[57:15] second peter chapter one
[57:19] in verse five he says
[57:22] and besides this giving all diligence
[57:24] add to your faith
[57:39] to patients godliness
[57:41] and if we go down we see us building up
[57:44] to the stature of a perfect man
[57:48] but if you look clearly at a second at
[57:51] verse five
[58:06] so faith is already there
[58:09] faith was already there before you had
[58:11] to add these other virtues to build the
[58:14] stature of a perfect man
[58:19] so as soon as you are saved you already
[58:21] have faith
[58:24] you just have to to that understanding
[58:26] and that knowledge that god has already
[58:28] given it to me
[58:32] the prophet of god says you can only
[58:34] have faith as god gives you faith
[58:40] faith is a gift of god
[58:44] however religious you may be
[58:47] you must have faith
[58:51] amen it is a gift from god when you are
[58:53] saved
[58:56] if you are seated right then you
[58:57] accepted christ as your savior you have
[58:59] faith
[59:10] because the bible tells us that faith
[59:12] without works is dead
[59:16] so you gotta exercise it
[59:19] to put it to use
[59:21] amen
[59:23] so faith brings us brings to us victory
[59:29] the prophet of god also says faith is
[59:31] the most common thing there is
[59:36] you can't even get a drink of water
[59:38] without faith
[59:42] you couldn't come to this meeting
[59:43] without faith
[59:54] when you came in to sit on your chair
[59:56] how many tried to check if the chair was
[59:58] gonna was not gonna was not gonna fall
[1:00:00] under them
[1:00:04] no one did you have you had faith in
[1:00:05] that chair
[1:00:07] so each and every one of us in this
[1:00:08] building have faith
[1:00:12] so you are on your way to pleasing god
[1:00:17] but our problem is we only have faith in
[1:00:18] natural things and when it comes to god
[1:00:20] then we no longer have faith
[1:00:35] and of all the air crashes we've ever
[1:00:37] had you still have faith that i'm going
[1:00:38] to reach my destination
[1:01:05] amen and we thank god for the prophet of
[1:01:08] our days
[1:01:21] able to work for you
[1:01:24] he says patience and soul for this
[1:01:26] mockery
[1:01:28] pretending of nature giving faith
[1:01:34] the faith that we're talking about
[1:01:35] that's nature giving faith
[1:01:40] and he says all these things are
[1:01:42] nature-given
[1:01:45] and he says and the biggest part of our
[1:01:48] faith is mental faith
[1:02:06] and i like this part it says and when
[1:02:09] the word itself is pouring into your
[1:02:12] faith
[1:02:16] our mental faith becomes a spiritual
[1:02:18] revelation
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:29] if you just pour the word of god onto
[1:02:31] that face
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:47] so it is not that difficult
[1:02:50] we all have faith
[1:02:52] but we all do not trust the word of god
[1:02:54] as we ought to
[1:02:57] so
[1:02:58] if you just apply that word of god to
[1:03:00] your faith
[1:03:04] then you know it's a done deal
[1:03:06] it's already settled
[1:03:08] because faith changes impossible to
[1:03:10] possible
[1:03:13] it is not and i think
[1:03:23] when the children of israel were
[1:03:24] crossing after they crossed over
[1:03:33] the other ten came back saying we saw
[1:03:35] giants we cannot take this land
[1:03:41] they say we are like grasshoppers they
[1:03:43] were looking at what their site was
[1:03:44] telling them
[1:03:47] but you see the word of god they didn't
[1:03:49] talk about the graves and the good land
[1:03:51] that the world was talking about
[1:03:56] but joshua and caleb they were looking
[1:03:58] at the word
[1:04:01] they applied the word to their faith
[1:04:06] and they said we sold the milk and honey
[1:04:10] the land is ours
[1:04:13] whatever is standing between me and the
[1:04:15] promise does not matter that's right
[1:04:19] because i'm standing on the word of god
[1:04:23] they did not say we might be able to go
[1:04:25] and take it
[1:04:28] but they say the land is there it is
[1:04:30] ours we are able to go and play man
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:35] why because they were using their faith
[1:04:38] they were looking at it with the eyes of
[1:04:40] god amen
[1:04:43] they did not let the circumstances or
[1:04:45] what they saw to affect god what god had
[1:04:48] said about it
[1:04:52] amen
[1:05:04] but when you are walking with your eyes
[1:05:06] of faith
[1:05:32] so i know if god say that
[1:05:47] we don't know how long it took for that
[1:05:49] light to be there
[1:05:53] but one thing we know for sure is light
[1:05:55] was there
[1:05:58] because when god speaks a word that word
[1:06:00] is eternal
[1:06:04] and a word that is spoken carries the
[1:06:06] same authority as the person who is
[1:06:08] spoken
[1:06:14] if someone comes to you and told you
[1:06:16] that someone said go do this and this
[1:06:22] the first question you ask is who said
[1:06:24] that
[1:06:26] the answer you will get
[1:06:29] will determine the speed at which you
[1:06:31] will do that
[1:06:34] because you're attaching authority to
[1:06:36] that word
[1:06:39] if it is your friend then you say oh
[1:06:40] i'll do some other time okay
[1:06:42] but if it is someone who's in authority
[1:06:46] you go and do it right away
[1:06:50] so when god speaks word
[1:06:54] that word has the same authority as god
[1:06:56] himself
[1:07:24] and he has never failed before
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:33] in isaiah the bible says
[1:07:36] when god speaks a word it does not come
[1:07:38] back to him void
[1:07:51] it only comes back after it has
[1:07:52] accomplished its commissioner
[1:08:06] and if he is a father of faith they are
[1:08:07] children of faith
[1:08:20] despite what his body looked like
[1:08:29] so it doesn't matter if you try to match
[1:08:31] up the word and what the situation is
[1:08:33] looking like
[1:08:36] that's
[1:08:38] i believe and i have enough faith that
[1:08:40] the world has enough power to change
[1:08:42] that situation to match what the world
[1:08:44] says
[1:08:51] amen the prophet of god tells us that
[1:08:53] abraham and sarah their bodies were
[1:08:55] rejuvenated they were transformed
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:03] it was not their own doing
[1:09:16] and make that promise to come to pass
[1:09:20] that's why abraham never staggered on
[1:09:22] the promises of god
[1:09:25] and he is written in hebrews 11 in the
[1:09:28] hall of fame of the saints
[1:09:32] as the people who had faith cause he
[1:09:33] stood on the word of god
[1:09:38] so when god tells you to do anything
[1:09:41] you go right ahead and do it
[1:09:44] because you know he's going to fulfill
[1:09:46] his word
[1:09:49] amen i don't worry about it because i'm
[1:09:51] not responsible for it
[1:09:54] he is fully responsible of his own word
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:59] the prophet of god said god is willing
[1:10:00] to bankrupt heaven to make sure his word
[1:10:02] comes to pass
[1:10:10] so when the when god told me and when
[1:10:12] the word tells me that jesus said it is
[1:10:15] finished
[1:10:19] whatever i come across i would just say
[1:10:20] it is finished
[1:10:24] how is it going to get finished i don't
[1:10:26] know
[1:10:28] i'm not worried about it that's not my
[1:10:29] business
[1:10:31] hey man if i'm sick i'm just going to
[1:10:33] say by his traps i was healed
[1:10:36] i don't care whether it's diabetes
[1:10:40] whether it's cancer
[1:10:42] whether it's just a headache
[1:10:45] i'll just profess and say i am healed
[1:10:49] because i'm not the one who's going to
[1:10:51] heal myself
[1:10:54] so i'm not worried about it i'm just
[1:10:56] going to speak the word and go forward
[1:10:57] because i know god will do it
[1:11:03] it gives you a permission to be reckless
[1:11:13] what the dictionary uh defines reckless
[1:11:16] as careless of the consequences
[1:11:24] you just don't care what the
[1:11:25] consequences are
[1:11:28] consequence or you can say it's
[1:11:30] question-less
[1:11:36] it says
[1:11:37] now joshua knowing that the command was
[1:12:06] that was gonna come before him
[1:12:09] or how many how many uh
[1:12:12] how many other armies that enemy had
[1:12:14] overcome
[1:12:17] he was reckless because of the
[1:12:19] commission god had given him
[1:12:34] in the right direction
[1:12:37] so we are pointed in the way of the word
[1:12:41] we are pointed in the direction of the
[1:12:43] word
[1:12:45] so all we have to do is to be fearless
[1:12:47] and reckless
[1:13:15] it is not my duty to heal them
[1:13:18] the commission says lay hands on them
[1:13:20] and they shall recover
[1:13:24] as soon as you fulfill the word of god
[1:13:26] it is up to him to complete it
[1:13:56] also talks about how it's like a check
[1:13:58] that is that has a blank amount on it
[1:14:04] all you have to do is just put it's
[1:14:05] already signed
[1:14:09] all you have to do is put in the amount
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:40] they
[1:14:55] everything is already settled because
[1:14:56] they know this is going to give me that
[1:14:58] food
[1:15:03] that's what faith is in our hands
[1:15:07] whatever you've been praying for
[1:15:10] your faith is the evidence of that thing
[1:15:12] that you need
[1:15:14] it is the tangible part amen
[1:15:17] amen so all you just have to do is have
[1:15:20] faith
[1:15:22] speak
[1:15:35] you can chase away tormenting spirits
[1:15:39] why because you are taking god at his
[1:15:41] word
[1:15:44] and we know he can do it
[1:15:46] because his word has the same authority
[1:15:48] as him himself
[1:16:00] first of all he was told to build a boat
[1:16:01] because it was gonna rain
[1:16:14] and second of all he was told to build a
[1:16:17] an ark
[1:16:25] which was also one of the most
[1:16:26] ridiculous things people had ever heard
[1:16:31] but no i didn't care about all that um
[1:16:35] you know that if god say that
[1:16:38] it is going to happen
[1:16:41] if god said it is going to rain
[1:16:44] it is going to rain
[1:16:46] if he said that build an ark see
[1:16:49] concrete i don't care what material it
[1:16:51] is that arc is going to bring me
[1:16:53] salvation
[1:16:58] no i didn't care about the engineering
[1:17:00] or the mechanics of the boat
[1:17:07] he was just looking at the word of god
[1:17:10] and now when we got to look at it god
[1:17:12] for wood is made of a material that's
[1:17:14] like a sponge
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:21] it is it is porous
[1:17:25] so if you put it in water it sucks in
[1:17:27] all the water and it sinks
[1:17:33] that's why people say that is so
[1:17:35] ridiculous how can you build a boat with
[1:17:37] a material that if you put it in water
[1:17:39] it will just sink
[1:17:54] he told him to go boil that gopher wood
[1:17:57] in the evergreen tree
[1:18:03] the sap the sap from the evergreen tree
[1:18:06] he was going to boil that
[1:18:08] golfer within it
[1:18:23] it would suck in all that sap from this
[1:18:26] evergreen tree
[1:18:30] and after boiling it it was solid
[1:18:36] so the ark ended up being made of a
[1:18:37] mature that it was light as paper
[1:18:42] material
[1:18:47] but it was solid like steel
[1:18:51] and no man would have ever thought about
[1:18:52] it
[1:19:06] and we know he
[1:19:21] to the holy ghost
[1:19:24] it's supposed to be porous to the world
[1:19:28] so that when we lay in the presence of
[1:19:30] the holy ghost
[1:19:32] when we lay in the presence of the word
[1:19:50] why because you have christ in you
[1:19:54] you have that holy ghost fortifying you
[1:19:58] hey man
[1:19:59] so if you just stand on the word of god
[1:20:11] no temptation can come in your way
[1:20:14] you will be more than an overcomer a man
[1:20:44] i'll rather spend five minutes in the
[1:20:46] will of god than 50 years out of it
[1:20:55] because when you are in the will of god
[1:20:56] god is responsible to protect you
[1:21:12] but
[1:21:24] that's why it's important for us to have
[1:21:26] faith which is a revelation from god
[1:21:32] and we can only please him when we are
[1:21:34] in his will
[1:21:38] and when we are in his will we know that
[1:21:40] nothing can come it can
[1:21:42] can take us by surprise
[1:21:47] because he is there to protect you
[1:21:50] he is there to heal you
[1:21:53] if you fall sick he will take you out of
[1:21:54] it
[1:22:09] out of them out of them all
[1:22:14] we think that righteous means that
[1:22:16] someone who never sins
[1:22:20] but if that was the case then no one of
[1:22:22] us would have that scripture applying to
[1:22:24] us
[1:22:28] but the prophet of god gave us a
[1:22:29] definition of a righteous man
[1:22:34] whom when they fall down they don't stay
[1:22:36] there
[1:22:46] so whatever you have failed and you fall
[1:22:48] down just get up and keep on going
[1:23:02] it doesn't matter what you have done if
[1:23:04] you just get up repent of it god will
[1:23:06] forgive you
[1:23:12] and you have that ability and you can
[1:23:14] call god in his word and you say lord i
[1:23:16] have this affliction
[1:23:33] many are they but god would deliver you
[1:23:35] out of them all
[1:23:39] not some but all of them
[1:23:43] amen
[1:23:44] the prophet of god was talking about his
[1:23:46] testimony how he was sick
[1:23:50] he had a stomach trouble he couldn't he
[1:23:52] couldn't eat beans or have his stuff
[1:23:53] that couldn't stay in this in the
[1:23:54] stomach
[1:24:14] examine me say it's impossible for him
[1:24:16] to ever get well
[1:24:23] but he said and i read god's word amen
[1:24:28] that's what he
[1:24:41] and i eat cornbread greens and onions
[1:24:47] you say this one time i took a big
[1:24:48] mouthful
[1:24:52] and my mother got scared and called the
[1:24:53] doctor
[1:24:56] he said i swallowed them
[1:24:59] and went out swallowed they try to come
[1:25:00] back up again
[1:25:04] and i held my hand over my mouth
[1:25:08] he says oh no you can't do that
[1:25:24] you said i just kept on doing that she
[1:25:26] continued
[1:25:27] until it stayed down
[1:25:30] and he was killed
[1:25:32] because he was being persistent
[1:25:35] he was not in that number no it doesn't
[1:25:37] matter how many times i'm fighting this
[1:25:39] demon
[1:25:41] god has to deliver me out of this
[1:25:43] affliction
[1:25:45] because he called god on his word
[1:25:49] amen so when you have this faith it
[1:25:51] changes your vocabulary from impossible
[1:25:54] to possible
[1:25:59] you cannot be shaken because it's
[1:26:01] nothing i think so but it's in i know so
[1:26:06] you
[1:26:07] amen because you have a revelation
[1:26:10] that's why we know many testimonies
[1:26:12] william branham he'll say i'm speaking
[1:26:14] according to the revelation of my faith
[1:26:32] it's not for us just to look and say oh
[1:26:34] wow that was great
[1:26:37] it is for you to see that if a man who's
[1:26:40] filled with the holy ghost can do this
[1:26:45] myself i can do the same thing too
[1:26:59] that's why you gotta share your
[1:27:00] testimony
[1:27:16] you can do the same thing for me too
[1:27:19] prophetic god says
[1:27:21] if mr john doe out there had cancer and
[1:27:23] was healed see uh mr
[1:27:27] if mr john doe was out there and had
[1:27:29] cancer it was healed
[1:27:51] and you are in that same position
[1:27:54] you know that it's happening it's going
[1:27:56] to happen for me as well
[1:27:59] it says if this man was blind and now
[1:28:01] they can see
[1:28:02] me
[1:28:04] and then you see if you are blind oh is
[1:28:07] it a verb and also if this person is
[1:28:09] crippled and couldn't walk and now they
[1:28:10] can walk
[1:28:21] and you hear of a testimony of someone
[1:28:23] who had diabetes and got healed
[1:28:32] hey man if you're reading and you're
[1:28:34] here talking to the prophet talking
[1:28:36] about someone getting healed of cancer
[1:28:45] these testimonies did not end in 1965.
[1:28:50] the bible says greater works than this
[1:28:52] shall you do
[1:28:56] so it is for you and me too
[1:28:58] he says that's the way congress uh
[1:29:00] congressman abso was healed
[1:29:05] um
[1:29:06] we know he was he was in the he was in
[1:29:09] the wheelchair for 66 years
[1:29:12] don't do it
[1:29:15] and then he heard the testimony of um of
[1:29:17] of florence nightingale
[1:29:22] and how she was
[1:29:37] they had been like that for 66 years
[1:29:42] and science says it's it's hard for for
[1:29:44] someone to have a bone regeneration when
[1:29:46] they are older like that
[1:30:01] and he walked up out of that wheelchair
[1:30:13] if you receive the holy ghost share the
[1:30:15] testimony to somebody else
[1:30:19] if you were fighting depression and god
[1:30:21] came and delivered you share with
[1:30:22] somebody else
[1:30:25] your testimony is somebody else's weapon
[1:30:31] and god will use that same testimony to
[1:30:34] bring another testimony
[1:30:36] to you remember
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] it is david's testimonies that gave him
[1:30:41] the testimony of killing goliath
[1:30:47] because he knew that if god did this
[1:30:51] with a lion he said
[1:30:54] and he did this with the beast
[1:30:57] and this goliath is just another beast
[1:31:01] that's why the bible says david ran
[1:31:03] towards goliath
[1:31:07] that was nothing else but faith
[1:31:10] he did not think that goliath was going
[1:31:12] to fall
[1:31:14] he knew that goliath was going to fall
[1:31:18] because he was standing on the promise
[1:31:20] of god and he was standing on his
[1:31:22] experiences
[1:31:26] amen so don't be afraid to testify
[1:31:42] so they can also get their deliverance
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:47] the prophet of god says genuine faith
[1:31:49] does not take no for an answer
[1:31:56] he says it's got hairs on the chest
[1:32:03] it's muscular it's big and burly
[1:32:08] it speaks and everything has to set down
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:14] amen here's the one who told us that
[1:32:16] faith is the sixth sense
[1:32:20] that sixth sense we're supposed to
[1:32:22] supersede all the other fights
[1:32:27] that's the ones that bring doubt to us
[1:32:30] when you look and see something you say
[1:32:32] no this is not it
[1:32:34] and it makes you doubt the word of god
[1:32:37] but that sixth sense he says it's
[1:32:39] muscular
[1:32:40] when it speaks everything has to settle
[1:32:42] down
[1:32:46] i probably told this story before
[1:32:48] when i was uh
[1:32:50] when i was when i was younger in um
[1:32:53] i was i was in primary school
[1:32:56] middle school
[1:32:59] and then i
[1:33:00] i was writing this test in school
[1:33:05] and the question was how many senses
[1:33:07] does a human have
[1:33:10] songs
[1:33:11] this was a thursday the previous ones
[1:33:13] i'd heard my dad preach about how faith
[1:33:15] is the sixth sense and we have six
[1:33:16] senses
[1:33:47] i'm the only one who had six senses
[1:33:52] i had the answer wrong
[1:33:56] and i was i was mad
[1:33:59] i went back to my dad i said hey
[1:34:02] this is what you're preaching i wrote
[1:34:04] this but i got this wrong
[1:34:09] what does this mean
[1:34:11] then he told me no we are different
[1:34:14] we have a sixth
[1:34:17] we sense
[1:34:17] different from the rest of the world
[1:34:19] that just operate on five senses
[1:34:23] we have that sixth one that supersedes
[1:34:25] all of them
[1:34:28] that's why when you see the doctor's
[1:34:30] report
[1:34:44] those senses to shut up
[1:34:48] and only look at the word of god
[1:34:53] that's the one the prophet is saying it
[1:34:55] has it has big
[1:34:58] muscles and it tells all the other five
[1:35:01] senses to shut up and settle down
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] he says if the old if the old feelings
[1:35:08] rise up and you say i don't feel any
[1:35:10] different
[1:35:12] to
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:26] because faith is looking at the word of
[1:35:27] god it's not looking at what your senses
[1:35:30] are saying
[1:35:32] no
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:35] so we gotta rely more on that sixth
[1:35:37] sense over the other five
[1:35:44] because faith is that
[1:35:46] it gives us that communication and it
[1:35:49] gives us contact with god
[1:35:54] because if you don't have faith and you
[1:35:55] don't even believe in god how are you
[1:35:56] going to be able to pray to him
[1:36:02] without faith you cannot please him
[1:36:05] without faith you cannot even contact
[1:36:08] god we know faith prayer is the most
[1:36:12] powerful weapon that god ever plays in
[1:36:13] the hands of man
[1:36:18] so if you cannot have faith how can you
[1:36:20] pray for things to happen
[1:36:35] that
[1:36:36] the prayer of the son of god goes a
[1:36:38] million times faster than the prayer of
[1:36:40] an angel
[1:36:49] that happens if you're in contact with
[1:36:51] god
[1:36:53] the prophet tells us that the most the
[1:36:55] three most powerful weapons he talks
[1:36:56] about
[1:37:00] he talks about prayer
[1:37:02] and he talks about the power of
[1:37:03] confession
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:24] if you believe and accept it on those
[1:37:26] basis and believe it keep confessing
[1:37:29] that's right
[1:37:33] people other people look at the symptoms
[1:37:34] yeah this is wrong
[1:37:36] but if you keep on confessing
[1:37:39] keep on believing
[1:37:42] god's going to do it despite what you
[1:37:43] feel
[1:37:46] amen amen so you gotta confess it
[1:37:50] rely on that sixth sense
[1:37:56] god will give you that victory
[1:37:59] keep on
[1:38:00] believing
[1:38:02] amen you will never fail
[1:38:06] and we do not receive because we do not
[1:38:08] ask
[1:38:11] bible says you receive not because you
[1:38:13] ask not
[1:38:16] and you ask not because you don't have
[1:38:18] faith in god
[1:38:21] because you you don't even know if god
[1:38:22] is going to do it
[1:38:26] and he says you will brother branham
[1:38:28] says you can never exhaust the love of
[1:38:30] gods to you
[1:38:35] he says he says you're gonna say well i
[1:38:37] hate to bother you so much further
[1:38:42] he says he wants to be bothered that way
[1:38:44] amen
[1:38:46] don't you ever think that you could ever
[1:38:48] ask too much of god
[1:38:53] he said he wants us to ask and believe
[1:38:56] that our joys were
[1:39:08] don't limit your fate to some little
[1:39:09] mustard seed only
[1:39:13] get out there and get out there or some
[1:39:16] kind of faith and move out big things
[1:39:20] fit the controls
[1:39:22] big things are just as easy to receive
[1:39:24] as little things
[1:39:29] imagine a little fish that's in the sea
[1:39:31] the image
[1:39:33] it says i'll just a few sips of water
[1:39:35] otherwise i'm gonna finish this water
[1:39:50] you think god that god is limited
[1:40:05] the bible says he will give it to you
[1:40:08] it doesn't matter even if it's not just
[1:40:10] for yourself
[1:40:12] you can ask for your children
[1:40:16] did it for his for her children
[1:40:19] and it was given to them
[1:40:21] you can ask for your family
[1:40:24] hey man you can apply the talking for
[1:40:26] your family
[1:40:29] why that's big things
[1:40:31] god can do it he is not limited
[1:40:47] the prophet of god i was going to choke
[1:40:51] it
[1:40:53] uh
[1:40:54] i was going to not say it
[1:40:58] but i'm just going to say it
[1:41:00] men is omnipotent
[1:41:04] i know what it means but i had to go
[1:41:05] look back and see what it means
[1:41:08] omnipotent means unlimited authority
[1:41:14] your authority is not limited to
[1:41:16] anything
[1:41:18] because we get that authority from god
[1:41:22] if god is in you you have unlimited
[1:41:25] authority
[1:41:28] because you are allowing him to work
[1:41:30] within your
[1:41:32] you are allowing him to use your lips
[1:41:36] you allow him to use your hands to use
[1:41:38] your feet
[1:41:41] so
[1:41:41] when you speak
[1:41:59] and he says whatsoever you things you
[1:42:01] say don't doubt it in your heart
[1:42:09] you can have what you say
[1:42:27] because he was omnipotent he was given
[1:42:29] god's authority
[1:42:32] but after he lost that authority
[1:42:35] jesus went on the cross of calvary to
[1:42:37] claim back that authority and give it
[1:42:39] back to us
[1:42:44] so now that he has given it back to us
[1:42:46] and he is in us that same authority that
[1:42:49] adam had is lying within you and me yeah
[1:43:07] because he was omnipotent his god
[1:43:11] and he says what happens when two
[1:43:12] omnipotents meet
[1:43:16] when god and men comes together
[1:43:21] something's got to shake
[1:43:24] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[1:43:27] power of omnipotence of god
[1:43:34] knowing that he's promised it
[1:43:49] things that is not it makes them as
[1:43:51] though they are
[1:43:54] because
[1:43:57] the word that you speak has authority
[1:44:02] so it has to happen
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:33] the prophet talks about it he says
[1:44:37] don't fear john don't fear little flock
[1:44:41] and john is a type of the bride
[1:44:45] says all that i am you are here too
[1:44:50] all my power is yours
[1:44:54] my omnipotence is yours
[1:44:57] as i stand in your midst
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:14] unto me and it's yours to use
[1:45:21] you speak the word
[1:45:24] and i will perform it
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:27] that is my covenant and it can never
[1:45:29] fail
[1:45:32] that is our covenant
[1:45:35] or your covenant
[1:45:37] god says this is my covenant
[1:45:41] because every time god tried to have a
[1:45:43] covenant with men
[1:45:46] men failed
[1:45:48] he said this is on me
[1:45:52] all you have to do is speak the word
[1:46:11] you speak salvation for your loved one
[1:46:16] and i will save them
[1:46:19] you ask for the holy ghost and i will
[1:46:21] give it to you
[1:46:23] you ask for change and i will give it to
[1:46:25] you
[1:46:27] why you just speak it and i will perform
[1:46:30] it
[1:46:32] that gives me each and every right to be
[1:46:34] reckless
[1:46:37] amen i have the right to be reckless
[1:46:40] because i know i'm not performing none
[1:46:42] of it
[1:46:45] it's all on god amen
[1:46:47] i'll give an example of being reckless
[1:46:52] when i was little in middle school
[1:46:56] if i had if if
[1:46:58] if the school would give me
[1:47:00] my tuition
[1:47:02] invoice
[1:47:05] i wouldn't even look at how much that
[1:47:07] was
[1:47:09] i'll just rush with that invoice and
[1:47:11] just go hand it over to my dad
[1:47:14] you see i don't care if he has the money
[1:47:16] or not
[1:47:19] i just know he's going to find it he's
[1:47:21] going to pay for it
[1:47:23] i don't even i'm not going to have a
[1:47:25] sleepless night because he could not
[1:47:27] find money to pay for it
[1:47:31] i know because i've been going to school
[1:47:34] he's been paying for it
[1:47:36] so therefore he's going to keep on
[1:47:38] paying for it
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] so what more about god
[1:47:44] he has done all these things for you
[1:47:46] back in the past
[1:47:49] what makes you think that he's going to
[1:47:51] fail you today
[1:47:55] just go put it in the hands of god
[1:47:59] and you say i'm done
[1:48:01] it is up to him to fulfill it because he
[1:48:04] will do it
[1:48:06] i believe hey man so it doesn't matter
[1:48:08] who you are
[1:48:10] that covenant applies to you
[1:48:14] and you say is there it is he is spirit
[1:48:16] and he is life
[1:48:19] that is exactly what the word is
[1:48:23] that is exactly what this is
[1:48:27] he is the word
[1:48:29] so when a spirit born and spirit-filled
[1:48:31] men in faith
[1:48:37] takes that word into his heart and then
[1:48:39] places it upon his lips
[1:49:39] you can say i'm not maybe i'm not a
[1:49:40] deacon
[1:49:43] i haven't done a lot of things i don't
[1:49:44] have a lot of testimonies
[1:49:48] it doesn't matter you use that one
[1:49:50] weapon god gave you
[1:49:54] use that faith jesus
[1:49:56] is going to give you victory
[1:49:59] because that faith is what you're going
[1:50:01] to need for the changing of your body
[1:50:06] you do not have faith
[1:50:13] what makes you think you're going to
[1:50:14] have faith for a transformation of your
[1:50:16] body
[1:50:20] that's why you gotta exercise it
[1:50:36] but god said daniel you go you go that
[1:50:39] way
[1:50:40] because i have a special people for the
[1:50:42] last days
[1:50:45] so you are more qualified than daniel to
[1:50:47] leave in this day
[1:50:50] you were more qualified than the three
[1:50:52] hebrew boys
[1:50:54] today
[1:50:58] so if you don't perform experts when you
[1:51:00] go to heaven
[1:51:03] daniel is going to ask what did you do
[1:51:05] when you were on earth
[1:51:08] and you don't have a testimony
[1:51:11] he's going to regret to say you should
[1:51:13] have switched me out with this guy
[1:51:17] because you didn't take use of the
[1:51:19] promises god gave you
[1:51:23] promise to do that so all you just have
[1:51:24] to do is stand
[1:51:27] have faith in god
[1:51:30] when your faith is anchored in god it's
[1:51:32] supreme faith
[1:51:38] and that faith will go and bring things
[1:51:41] to you
[1:51:42] is it forever
[1:51:45] so long is based on the will of god so
[1:51:48] long it's based on the word of god
[1:51:51] let us stand upon our feet amen
[1:51:58] [Applause]
[1:52:08] amen we thank god for that weapon
[1:52:12] that he gave to us
[1:52:18] foreign
[1:52:21] [Music]
