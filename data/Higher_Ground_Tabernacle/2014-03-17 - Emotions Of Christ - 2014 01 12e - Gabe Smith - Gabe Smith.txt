TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen praise the Lord amen yeah again we're happy to be here this evening happy to be a Christian amen and uh I uh appreciate the Lord yes appreciate being here with you I really uh counted a privilege hallu amen and uh I uh I had to say uh uh I I love your pastor amen amen that ain't that's not lip service I mean I he he may never have me back but I still love him just the same ain't saying there pulling on a on on a pull pit I just you know sometimes you meet people and you just just something about them you know you meet many people in life and then there's certain people that kind of pop out a little bit more than others you know amen so uh appreciate brother Brooks and sister Ruby and the fellowship and hospitality and uh I uh I trust this evening something's going to be said to be a blessing to you as uh as I said that this morning we're going to look at something uh a little bit different and my my uh my goal this evening uh is to is to uh display God in flesh for you uh uh and you know we we think of Jesus and we think of God and we many times we put him way up yonder right so so uh so unattainable that that he that that you know even though we know it was God made flesh but sometimes we lose the we realize what that really means that God did come in flesh amen and so God felt everything that you felt yes sir amen he went through all that you went through and just just so you know what I did is is I I I studied I'd say off and on for about a year it was a private study of mine um I I I come across something where uh Jesus was expressing an emotion in the word of this is how he was feeling and and it struck me and so what I started doing it started compiling through the Gospels every time that uh Jesus spoke of emotion or something how he was feeling whether it was anger or crying or you know whatever it may be uh and I compiled it and uh just as a personal study but as I looked at it it it grown and it just turned into a message because uh I I I honestly believe not because I studied it but I really wish I could give every believer in the world this file because it's one thing to read it periodically and see Jesus but to gather them all together and collect them and then you read it at one time it'll give you a whole another aspect of Our Lord when he walked on Earth amen because you know uh and it'll be surprising to you but we'll just we'll we'll we'll we'll try to get into the word of the Lord right now uh first I'd like to read uh Mark chapter 3 and verse 5 the Bible says and when he looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other and then Luke 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Heaven of Earth of Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and H has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight and then I'd like to read a quote uh brother Bram says this in uh 58 eight he says we find that our Lord never did anything just at random every move he made was ordained of the father we just go at random but he said I always do those things which pleases the father so every move that he had made had a meaning amen and it was to please God oh I would say here would it not be wonderful if we could have that have a have a testimony like that that we always do that which pleases God Amen and I like to speak to you this evening by the help of the Lord on emotions of Christ emotions of Christ let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer precious Lord we do love you God this evening and we just want to Bow before you and welcome you Lord to this portion of the service and just pray God that your will would come to pass Lord we yield to you pray that you'd have your perfect way Lord uh pray God that you'd bind my mouth if I'd say something contrary to your spirit and word and we'll be careful to give you praise we ask these things to be so in the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can be seated if you like and um you know you know I what really got me thinking about this and and looking at it is uh you know I'm an emotional person I just am and uh um you know I think many times we try to control our emotions that right and uh I believe Christ is our example and and so uh you know emotion is a very power F thing and it's and and so I believe that uh and and remember I I did the best that I could and comb the gospel as thorough as I could to make sure I wasn't I didn't leave anything out uh you may find a scripture or something where I I missed but I tried to be as thorough as possible and so uh and once I compiled this it was so striking to me that uh that it it it it said what it said you know and and and and so it's kind of uh and I think it's important that if if God put him saying an emotion that he's feeling it's for a purpose right it's not done just at random and and and so there's a meaning behind it and so in God I believe he's he's trying to express when I was in flesh this is how I was feeling right and and so you know emotion is is a very as much as we try to uh contain our emotions emotion uh plays a very important part of our lives uh you know it's not just we've all heard it said it's not just what we say but it's how we say it is that right uh we can we can as as we see that uh very little when we are speaking and and talking to one another very little of it is based upon what you say but there's a uh a great portion of your tone of voice and and the the way your body language is is that right uh it's just a small percentage as you see there as science uh is saying just 7% of your word uh 38% of your voice tones and 55% of your uh physiology and if I could give you an example uh to make it real to you I could I could I could look at uh um uh brother Brooks and I could say brother Brooks now be careful you might get hurt right but I could look at brother John and say careful my get hurt now I said the exact same thing I said I said brother Brooke now be careful and see look at was be careful but see and so so emotion is is is a is a uh uh a very important part and so when when God is expressing this he's trying to uh and I believe he's trying to comfort Us in this in this thing because you know brother brandom tells us this that uh uh it's been one of the most amazing things that I've noticed along the lines of my Ministry of our Lord Jesus is the peculiarity people and the study of human life is one of the one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch nature of people and and and I I'll be honest with you uh you know it wasn't so much the seals and the Thunders that caught me uh in in one sense I hope you understand but but but what what and I love don't get me wrong I love the Deep things of God and I love the opening of the word but but but what I love about the message is it helped me understand me and why I am the way that I am and and why I tick the way that I tick amen you there's so many facets of this message it is deep Doctrine and it is the opening of the word but it's also brother brandham gives us insight to to the the the way a human is and the way a human thinks and acts and responds and and all the different aspects of life I believe any question we have in this journey it's going to be found in the message of the hour of the word of God believe that with all of my heart and brother BR says in the different parts of of the nation the worlds where you go you'll notice that there's a different there's a different attitude that people takes towards Christ towards his service and towards his servants towards worship and one of the things has been that one type of meeting will just be wonderful in one part of the country where it won't work in the other part of the country am and uh I I hope this message Works in this part of the country if I missed it forgive me uh but but you know you know the Bible does tell us that uh to everything there is a season it's a time uh to every purpose under Heaven there's times to weep and there's times to laugh times to mourn and times to dance is that right times to Cast Away stones and times to gather Stones there's there's times to to Rend and times to sew a time to keep silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace and so as we go through this saying of life it it it there there's so many facets to it is that right and and before I I I you know we think of the Lord Jesus as though he he was God manifested in flesh but we also know this that he was very human because he was hungry that right the Bible tells us that there was a time and he he was thirsty and there was a time you know where the Bible says that he was wearied from his journey that means he was exhausted with toil of burdens or grief and so he was all human although though he was God tabernacled in flesh but he suffered all those things and so as we look at his emotions this evening I would like to ask you a question uh before we get started and and just think it in your heart out of all the human emotions what do you think was the greatest that he expressed when he was on Earth and and and I'm sure uh there's probably a great portion of you that was uh just like myself and before I studied this that we would probably automatically top at the list would think love uh but according to the prophet you're wrong and me too because brother bham tells us this his eyes of fire think of it those eyes that were once dimmed with tears of sorrow and pity those eyes that wept with compassion at the grave of Lazarus those eyes that saw not the evil of the murderers who hanged him on a cross but in sorrow cried my father forgive them now those eyes are a flame of fire in the eyes of a judge who will recompense those who rejected him of all the human emotions he manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often yet being that weeping and that sorrow there was still God and those same eyes saw visions that looked deep within the hearts of men and read their very thoughts and knew all their various ways blazing out of mortal lives was God who cried to those who him not who knew him not for what he was and so I I hope I'm sure that it it startles you the same as it did me to think uh we we think remember but but well I think a lot of times we get a false conception of what Christianity is that you know it's all baby blue skies and white puffy clouds you know uh but I'm sorry it's just not that way amen uh and and don't get me wrong uh uh there was uh you know he did Express the love quite a bit in his word uh but it wasn't uh I tell you who it was it was expressed to the most thank you sir it was actually to his bride amen yes sir uh because all throughout the Scriptures it it it expressed over and over the majority of it his love was to John his disciple amen and John types you yes and so thank the Lord that when his his love pred dominantly through the the scriptures what had to have been expressed to John because that's the Bride of Jesus Christ uh Mark 10 1021 and and and and and John 131 and John 13:23 and and John 19:26 I want you to realize John did John actually had a revelation that Jesus loves me and you got to get a revelation friends that Jesus loves me yes amen I don't think it's coincidence that that he would allow John under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that constantly refer back saying Jesus Loves Me amen amen and and and so all throughout the scriptures uh uh uh John 202 verse 2 he says John 217 uh John 2120 and so all throughout the scriptures his love was predominantly projected to John praise God here here's a here's a startling one when we think of compassion cuz he was a man full of compassion is that right but his compassion strangely when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion and over and over and over through the scriptures when he would see the ones that were there remember the multitude they were only there for fishes and Loaves yes sir amen amen Methodist Baptist Pentecostal first and second pool yes sir come on somebody why why would we not have the same if we have the spirit of God in us our compassion ought to be to our p this Breen we ought not to look at them as oh just a bunch of Cannon F sir you know that's you know that's predominant in the message that wasn't predominant in Christ life though sir the you can search it out friends over and over through the scriptures Jesus had come he was moved with compassion when he saw the hungry Baptist yes sir oh my don't you see how mess people are Miss by Miles friend and claim to have the Holy Ghost and can't even have a love for a Pentecostal can't even have love for somebody that may be a different belief of of a of a message rank you know this I don't care what you believe I still love you Hallelujah Thunders Peru whatever you want to neighbor better it we ought to still love him we ought to still have compassion for him Jesus said this this is a few places in the scripture where he says this is how I'm feeling and and it's and it's in excuse me it's in uh Mark 81 in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples unto him saying Toto them I this is what he's saying I he he telling us this is how I'm feeling I have compassion onto multitudes because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat the ones that were just there for handout but yet he would he he would look beyond that and see a soul that's hungry and want to feed him oh friends don't don't don't you see we are we got that's where our compassion is we can't just have compassion on our children and and our own church but it has to go beyond that has to go deeper than that amen Jesus speaking of his emotions brother B tells us this that remember Jesus as as he had in the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for you think some he says sometime he says why would a man that was so full of power like him would ever be SI have to be sick yes sir I've read in some book somewhere he raised up that boy the Widow son from na I believe Prince after David and he sat on a rock and groan with a headache he bore our infirmities bear means to pack them see he bore and had all these things like he we have he he had sickness he had Temptations He had trouble he had fluster Jesus Jesus had frustrations just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator so he had to be a partaker the husbandman of the fruit before he would know and we let frustrations take over and we we we discredit our testimony and and and Satan tries to say see you ain't got the Holy Ghost see you ain't a Christian he was God friends H and he had FR now oh let me make a disclaimer let me back up uh please uh uh don't don't don't take this collectively and try to justify your anger with a with a scripture you understand what I'm saying don't don't try to just justify your frustration say well Jesus was frustrated so I can you know you understand what I'm saying this is not this is not a a study for an excuse but but it's so that you can realize that Christ knows exactly where you're at amen that that that that we can see Christ sure he's high and lifted up but yet he also came down and suffered Humanity just like we do is that right and he did it for a purpose for we could so that we could have a high priest that could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities is that right but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin amen so he could be frustrated and not be sinning amen he could be angry and not sinning amen that's right amen he could be not grieved but much grieved and not sin amen praise the Lord amen watch the and we find here that they says because of him being a high priest watch this in the Old Testament every high priest taken from the men is ordained for men and things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed about with infirmity what's that saying and in the Old Testament the high priest first had to offer a sacrifice for himself amen that's right that's why Angels didn't come down and preach to you hallelujah amen because they wouldn't have the compassion they wouldn't they would not be able to understand what you're going through and Christ did the same that's why God came down in flesh so that he could understand what you're going through so that he could remember he wasn't a fallen man he was just dealing with Fallen Humanity we're Fallen men dealing with Fallen Humanity and he still had a headach amen amen praise the Lord for there is one God and one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus oh I love him for it Hallelujah you know God the Bible says that his voice wasn't heard in the streets but there was also times in Mark 6:45 where he would constrain them in other words he would drive them or force them or threaten them to get into the ship and also Bible says that Jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on him that sent me believeth but on him that sent me and that cry actually means to cry out or speak with a loud voice so though he was his voice wasn't heard in the streets there was also times where he' rais his voice amen that's exactly right and before we get into this too much I I I want to you may be wondering well uh and this was a shock to me I want to First focus on the Happy Time times of Jesus and and sad to say uh and I wish it could be a longer uh uh portion of this service it's going to be very short now remember I'm just telling you what when when there's emotion that he's feeling or we can read something and then say well I bet you he was feeling this way but remember I'm just collecting when it's saying this is how he's feeling okay the Bible tells us here that when the Centurion came before Jesus and we all know the story the Bible says when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto them that that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great a Faith No not in Israel but notice this marveled it actually means to Marvel Wonder have an admiration or admire we think the the king of glory but he could look at a Roman Centurion a gentile how many y'all know what I'm talking about you you got an elder uh you know no doubt uh uh we look up my pastor I look up to him and I admire him right if you you you look at your pastor your daddy or your grandpa or you know I love older people I just you know just something about me you know to see them seasoned veterans and you see a character in them and you see a solidness and an anchor and and I I admire old saints of God that's been serving the lord for years that does something to me and so we we we know that we have somebody in our life that we admire and like wow I would love to be like that I'd love to have that kind of Faith oh I help I hope I'm that uh you know I don't know about you but I love to see a old Sint of God that's just as sweet and tender and just you know uh uh every time I I see sister Marilyn Brown I think you know brother Brown she just I'm telling you brother she just gold you know you know I mean I mean it's just a character and a sweetness when you get around it you just you you you like you just want to you know patter or something just kind of you know what I'm talking about you you know what I mean it just and and so and so and so it's something about him friend that you admire that person but but but friend the king of kings and Lord of lords looked on him was like wow he admired the Roman Centurion and as we read at the beginning the Bible says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them un to babes even so fathers for so it seemed good in your sight and so Jesus what what made him excited is when his children caught the Revelation see see God you know you know you know you know this is what kills me about about about Minister sometimes is that is is you know I've seen Brothers preach and they ain't even preaching to the congregation they're preaching to the pastor and expressing how deep they are you know and trying to be so revelated but when the disciples broke when Jesus broke the bed and the disciples handed out in the baskets they didn't have the basket way up here said going brother get you peace huh is that right that's right that's right Brothers ministers are supposed to bring it down say go on brother get your get your handful that's what Ministry is supposed to do it say go on get you some brother the ministry is supposed to look at children go I got to be mindful let me say something for the little ones let me put a picture on the projector to see if they'll catch it is that right that's what real Ministry is for friends Ministry is to break it down and bring it down so ly can understand it's exactly right and Jesus he rejoiced when that happened because God is not trying to keep the Revelation from you he's trying to get it to you that's what makes God happy Hallelujah if he Rejoice then he'll Rejoice right now he rejoiced in spirit amen I want to make him happy don't you you imagine that friends it's not it's not us oh laboring at the computer oh I got to understand hallu and and and God sitting back there look at that's not God God rejoices in spirit is that right the Bible tells us he says I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in [Music] truth you say John said it no he didn't Lord Jesus said it praise God and the Bible also tells us in Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the the Throne of God who for the joy show me where there was Joy at Calvary if you didn't have this scripture didn't look like much joy huh but when he was on the cross yeah we were on his mind come on Friends it was Joy you know there's something about happiness there's something and you know uh I think it was last week week before last I stumbled across a study that was done uh uh recently it's a recent study they they did it over uh um um W with a study of over 700 people uh from Finland Sweden and Taiwan and and they it was they showed them uh pictures or slide or read them a few words and every time that that they saw this picture of this slide they they wanted them to express what what their body was feeling emotionally and and as we see here look at look at anger you got the fist see right there the heart look at look at uh uh Pride look at look at shame you got the cheeks blushed and what this is is kind of like a mood ring of the body right and so that when somebody felt it uh you know neutral surprise or sadness look at the lump in their throat you know in the eyes but but here's what I want you to see uh out of all of them happiness see happiness is a total body experience a merry heart doeth good like medicine woo Glory ah come on friends now I want to ask you if 700 uh fs and sweds and taiwans could look at pictures and have emotions of Happiness what ought to do the bride of Christ in here when I show you slide after slide after slide after slide of God's glory and grace Hallelujah he y make them Glory come on friend it's a full body experience tell me you can't clap your hands tell me you can't Hallelujah come on friends if if if if if natural Humanity can look at a picture of a Sunset and go what are we as Holy Ghost filled Christians whenever a minister paints a picture of the son Hallelujah Glory it what I'm showing you is something natural if this could happen to them natural what ought it be in the Supernatural now if we can sit there sad faced friend friend listen you're under the and I don't mean it's disrespectful but you're under the wrong anointing it's it's just truth because we and and don't get me wrong we we can have bad days but what I'm I'm saying is if it's progressively if we're in a rut the joy of the Lord is our strength that's right friends and I'm not I'm not trying to pump you out I'm just saying Christianity is not a labor you know you know I I I I tell you you know when we when we think of uh uh you know and I I don't mean to um I don't I don't mean to be uh it always makes me nervous talking about my past and things and so I'm not trying to brag on sin but you know

it anyways I'm just teasing I'm feeling good bro I'm feeling good I don't mean to be comical but it's just my nature it just I can't help it that's that's my nature you know stressful situations I I sometimes I'll laugh when I shouldn't laugh but it's just a nervousness you know so bear with me uh but but anyway thinking about our Lord so when when we go into these things friends what I'm saying is you got to get in the spirit you you you can't depend upon the song leader to preach it down and you can't wait for brother Brooks to preach it down you ought to bring it with you amen praise God that's true friends we all play a part is what I'm saying we all play a part and and it's so important so when we talking about the goodness of God I'm trying to I'm trying to uh uh get through you know when we thought when we and here's what I want to show you a couple roller coasters of Jesus's motions watch this brother now watch this Jesus says this now if we didn't have the brother brm said about when brother when Jesus says this and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold I cast out devil and I do cures tomorrow today and tomorrow and on the third day I shall be perfected brother brandham tells us the Lord himself had a sense ofor humor you know he said Herod go tell that fox yeah and so right here is Jesus with a sense of humor am right yes sir we wouldn't know that without a prophet amen but now I want I want you to see is verse 34 two verses later he says oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how off would I have gathered thy children together as a hinda gather herw on her wings and you would not and so our lord Jesus goes from a sense of humor to weeping over his church in two verses I he's been on the Mountaintop one minute and in the lowest Valley 10 minutes later and then and then Satan will beats you up even more and say see God Don't Love You Yeah amen he look at you our Lord our Lord friends do you see why it's so important cuz we're talking about Humanity we're talking about our human emotions I don't care how tough we Brothers try to be we're all fragile yes sir that's right we're all emotional that's right wh watch watch what Jesus says here when he's talking about the when the woman came as and he at Simon Lep's house and and and she anoints the O and Jesus says and he and he Jesus said let her alone why trouble you her she have wrought a good work on me and so here here here Jesus is having a blessful time being being anointed by by by his little bride and in the middle of it people are changing it by rebuking him and he says what are you doing let her alone amen she's brought a good work on me notice this friends it's highs and lows praise the Lord disappointment watch Satan couldn't get him so he went after his children to try and torment him no wonder Jesus got so emotional in certain situations Luke 19:41 and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou Hast known even now thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are HID from Thine Eyes the day shall come upon thee when thy enemy shall cast a trench about thee and Compass thee round about and keep thee on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and there shall not leave in one thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of the visitation watch and he went into the temple and began to cast them out that so doves therein and them that bought saying it is written my house shall be the House of Prayer but you have made it a din of Lees weeping is this all right is this helping you how me appreciates the word amen Brothers watch Jesus I read this to you at the beginning when Jesus saw the man with the withered hand Jesus when he saw them and and they begin to uh uh uh try to try to get Jesus catch Jesus and things and Jesus says this he said and he tells him he says and he said unto the man which had to wither hand stand forth and he said unto them it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man hold on just a minute I got to go pray for three days and fast and then I'll be back brother on well I'm not worthy cuz I've got this anger here oh tell me we don't go through that yes sir amen yes sir he didn't go on no three-day fast sir he didn't you know you know we do something wrong and we got to wait five business days huh and oh you know what I'm talking about don't tell me it we at least one person got to fire business day waiting period before they can go be spiritual again listen friends when you repent there's no five-day waiting period sir when you repent you ain't got to wait three business days and if it's a holiday oh man the Christmas has come so you ain't got to wait till the first of the year to be forgiven it's instantaneously if you repent automatically it goes into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and it's for for given we are the ones that have the problem of accepting that forgiveness and realizing there's no waiting period hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise God truth friends it's right we all go through it talking about Jesus when when he saw James and John and them and and and wanted to call Fire Heaven the Bible says he turned and rebuked them and said ye not know what manner of spirit you are of look at this after the Resurrection The Bible said he abraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart the Bible says on his road to emusu he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken see Jesus the Bible says Not only was he displeased but the Bible says when he saw it look they were having a ministerial meeting talking about marriage and divorce and they thought they were too spiritual to have children come up and and have Jesus touch him and Jesus got so so upset he wasn't just displeased the Bible said he was much displeased and said unto them suffer ye little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God the Bible also tells us that whenever he he he he could there do no Mighty work sa that he laid his hands upon a a few sick folk and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief looked at him with Wonder and Amor you like you got to be kidding me I hope I hope you're seeing god with skin on it this evening because because remember I hope this gives you courage to face the enemy not to use it to justify yourself but don't what I want you to understand is is don't let Satan discredit your testimony because you feel these emotions because we are emotional creatures is that right at least I am friends that's right I just am I know I am I can't help it uh he made me the way he made me but but I now watch I I one I just love this picture of Christ it does it just does something to me cuz I've sit like there many a time and I think oh my Lord did it too I love that picture but but watch this and the Pharisees came forth and began to question him seeking for him a sign from Heaven tempting him and he sighed deeply in his Spirit In other words he would oh I tell you this is my favorite one right here what's he doing he's tired of them Pharisees he tired of them Pharisees in his congregation and he that's what it means it means to draw up a deep of up deep side from the bottom of the breast he sat he went and he says why do this generation seek after a son verily I say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation and what did he do brother Brooks he turned around and left him oh friend I I love it friend you think he's the king of King Lord he ought to be able reason and work it out and you know you know uh you know a pastor he Pastor has the ability to make everything's right when they're troubled that's a quote you know you know what I'm talking about but even Jesus he went let's go oh friend I tell you that's my Lord that's my savior right there he left them and entered into the ship again and departed to the other side can I ask can I ask you something has anybody ever seen Jesus like this before Oh ain't it beautiful amen huh I hope you I hope you don't think I'm discredited I'm not trying to belittle Jesus I'm just telling you it's the scriptures I'm not adding to it it says what it says and means what it means and and and and this is something else that I love uh uh can you all bear with me just a little bit longer watch this he says and he saw them toiling rolling for the wind was contrary unto them and about the Fourth Watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and here's what I want you to see and would have passed by them now hold that why would why would he be walking up on the water and then pretend that he's walking past them hold on let me just add a couple to it oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how off would I have gathered thy children as a together as a h to gather her brood under her but you would not you starting to see the picture watch watch one more and they drew nigh unto the village where if they went and he made as though he would have gone further Hallelujah your your lord dealt with complexes too oh let it sink you can't tell me little school kids somebody's going to be doing something and and and and they're playing over there and they make as though they would have gone further but in their heart they want them to say no no no come on come on oh you can't tell me you've been in the fellowship go out to go out to eat and hear them say we're going to go to the house and you're like okay and in your heart you going oh please I want to go with them but you but you don't want to you don't want them to turn you down so you make as though you're go all right brother in your that's true he would have passed by them he made as though he would have gone further why listen listen friends we all want fellowship and Jesus does too and many times we we have we we we we get all bald up or we don't we don't want we get oh and we try to act like Jesus did it too see it's our human emotions you know why cuz we don't like rejection it hurts for somebody to turn us down little children don't like rejection that's why they make as though they would go farther when really they want to be invited amen praise God I love this one now this is Jesus speaking of his emotions I am come to send fire on the earth and I will and I what and what will I if it be already kindled but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straightened till it be accomplished so he's saying I'm being straightened now I want you to look at this word look at this word straighten it means to throng straighten press constrained hold together it says to hold together with constraint now watch this press together with a hand to hold one ears to shut the heavens that may not rain now watch this look right here to press on every side of a besieged city like a straight forces a ship into a narrow channel Jesus is feeling pressure watch this watch he says uh he says uh like like like a cattle squeeze pushing in on each side forcing the Beast into position where it cannot move so the forer can Minister medication Jesus is saying he's feeling squeezed in and pressed how am I straightened till it be accomplished he's feeling pressure friends cuz the medication is getting ready to be administered to him he's F to take the Stinger a death and he's feeling pressure he's being squeezed into a slot and he's feeling this look the Bible tells us this he says uh now this is him speaking of emotions again he said Jesus said answer them the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die abideth alone but if it die bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall live it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it un to eternal life if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now he says this now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into the world now Jesus is saying my soul is troubled and this is on the inside of the inside pleas please please don't fall asleep on me I know I know I know I it's going to be a little bit long but Shake Yourself cuz this is it's getting not cuz I'm preaching but it's getting good uh watch what this trouble means look it says to agitate trouble a thing it says by movement in its parts to and FL to cause one inward commotion watch cause one inward commotion take away his calmness of Mind disturb his equinity to desite make Restless to stir up to trouble to strike one's spirit with fear and dread to render anxious or distress to to perplex the mind of one by suggesting Scruples or doubts Jesus says on the inside of the inside my calmness is taken away on the inside of the inside fear and dread is striking me oh you say Jesus wasn't afraid yes he was the Bible says he was remember in order for perfect love to cast it out it has to come and he was perfect love amen see how Satan loves to twist it on you listen friend that friend don't have to rule you but it's going to come amen right and Jesus watch he says he to he says to render anxious to distress well I love this to perplex the mind of one by suggesting Scruples or doubts Jesus had suggestions of doubts nevertheless let this cup was that a doubt yes because that was what his purpose was that was the word well you know what a scruple means if you look at the defin a scruple means to hesitate you just hesitate I don't know that's a scruple and Jesus he hesitated this is your savior thank you Lord thank you Lord see he goes through the same things he went through the same thing friends now tell me Satan don't use these same tactics and to make you discredit your your your testimony amen he does me friends amen do you do you understand why this totally transformed my thinking of Our Lord it gave me a whole new outlook because I realized God put these these emotions in here for a purpose so that we would understand he wants us to know he already felt it he don't want you to just to look say he's the high priest and be touched up by the feeling of our infirmities he put it in the gospel and wrote it out there for you so that you could see it and go oh yeah he did experience it it wasn't just a thought and you know I kind of I kind of think I'm afraid but it struck his innermost being watch this roller coaster when he's at the Last Supper he said verily I say unto you a servant is is not greater than is Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you do these things happy happy happy are ye amen but look at here he says he talk he's talking about when when Judas is going to be received he says when Jesus had said thus he was troubled in his spirit and testify and said verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me and that troubled is the same word I just showed you striking so here he is doing something that we should be happy about foot washing communion but immediately while that's happening Hallelujah see we have roller coasters of emotions and God knows all about it friends God knows all about it he knows what fear is about the Bible says who in the day picking it up in the yellow who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane he he he fear struck him because he realized oh if I don't go they won't be saved he offered up strong crying and tears where where the water where it was tears of blood that poured from his body and he and he feared because God heard him Ben said no doubt nevertheless I wonder if that was it with his nevertheless that fear nevertheless no no no no he caught Glimpse and no doubt the panoramic chain he like nevertheless not my will remember fear was not a dominant force in his life though he did feel it friends and we shouldn't let fear be a dominant force in ours the Bible tells us this that when he went to the grave of Lazarus he groaned in his spirit and was troubled same same same word wherein they had laid him and he said unto them Jesus Lord come see and Jesus wept then said to the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave and it was a cave and a stone laid upon it see though he was God in remember remember friends though he already saw the vision that Lazarus was going to be raised brother B talks about that but still there was a human element that had preeminence that he still groaned and wept don't you understand friends you are the elect of God and though we've caught the vision and know there's going to be a resurrection they still go through groanings and weepings in our own selves Glory amen amen it's the vice of [Music] Resurrection the Bible tells us in Isaiah 53 23 and 4 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he's have no form nor less and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him you know when you look at Jesus you did you know you look at a preacher and you just like wow you know you look at a preacher you're like man he looks like a preacher it's got that look you know but when you looked at Jesus you didn't look at him and go wow that's God no because the Bible says there's no comly there's no appearance there's no splendor that when you'd see him you'd go wow that's God because it was a different set of eyes that you could look at him go wow that's God cuz he hid himself in humanity he said he has despised and rejected of man A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief you know that Sorrows actually means physical and mental pain a Man of Sorrows physical and mental pain the Bible tells us this that look at this and just bear with me I know I'm going long just please Shake Yourself he says and he taketh watch now he's in the Garden of Gethsemane and he taketh with him Peter James and John and begin to be sore amazed and be very heavy and said my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death Terry ye hear and watch now I want you to realize and and and I want to stop stop here before I go into these words remember remember what what what Peter James and Don John did they they went to sleep right and remember Jesus went back they went to sleep again eventually an angel came down and strengthened him right but I want you to know that was not God's perfect will Jesus did not want an angel to come down and strengthen him he wanted three sons of Abraham to to pray with him oh my oh my friend we want Gabriel or Michael to come down when we realize we sitting shoulder toosh shoulder with sons of Abraham that was what God wanted when God was in this trial he wanted sons of Abraham to pray with him he didn't want Michael or Gabriel to come down Hallelujah he was crying out for three sons of Abraham didn't have the Holy Ghost oh my goodness oh my friends and we got we got Pride filled with the Holy Ghost and we would rather have an angel come pray that oh my friends we're missing it amen [Music] watch so amazed it means to be frightened greatly amazed to throw into Terror or amazement to alarm thoroughly to terrify I want you to notice this one it means to watch be troubled I want you to notice this very heavy this is the strongest of the three Greek words in the New Testament for depression brother Brooks Jesus was on level three depression the strongest of the three Greek words for depression he was on level three depression and you can't tell me he don't know what you're feeling right right now listen friend you don't need proac you don't need no psychologist you go to the great physician and he'll take care of that don't let the don't let the devil lie to you say you got a chemical oil and balance you rebuke that in the name of Jesus Christ that's just a pharmaceutical Company's trying to pump that down your head make you believe that that's right friends it's exactly right we don't we we we ought to realize Jesus went through level three depression for you I love that friend oh don't that bless your heart friends level three three sorrowful exceeding sorrowful exceeding sorry very sad look he says overcome with sorrow so much as to cause one's death this is what he was feeling overcome with his sorrow so much that it would cause death says it again in Matthew 26 he says uh sorrowful and very heavy same thing all all these things and I want you this is this is this is wonderful friends when he was in that Garden the Bible says that he was in agony and being in agony he prayed the more earnestly being in agony I want you to look at that that word for Agony it actually means a struggle for victory Our Savior was an Agony it it's a struggle for victory friend he wasn't doing he oh my H this is this is the Son of God you are a son of God with the same Holy Ghost he is but yet he still had a struggle for [Applause] victory see how Satan lies to you and tells you you don't have the Holy Ghost cuz you're struggling for victory hallelujah hallelujah it's all a bluff of the enemy friends Satan tries to Bluff you if Jesus had to struggle for victory what ought we as a Son of God or a daughter of God we' got to have listen friends remember we have to die out we have to we have to die out every day die every day is that right pick up Die daily what do we got to do we got to have a Gethsemane every [Applause] day praise the Lord every day friend it is a struggle for victory that's the Garden of Gethsemane friends and and we got to go through that Gethsemane to get to an Eden and it's a struggle for victory Hallelujah don't let pump that down your chest that you're not bride he was God and he had a struggle for victory so we're going to have a struggle for victory Hallelujah remember when he was in that sorrow the Bible said it was sorrow that would cause him to die and brother brandham tells us this a man 33 years old and looked like 50 the Bible said of his strength rain brother BR said his ministry wore him down brother Brook brother Brooks three and a half year Ministry and it aged him 20 years he said and and he says where he probably turned gray and grim look on his face where he had suffered not so much physically but it it was Agony the Bible said that his blood and water separated from each other and any doctor anything can tell you that knows the chemistry of blood that sorrow will do that he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail drove in his hand or in his feet but he died of a broken heart being rejected he came to his own and his own received received him not what was it what was it that killed him it was an emotion and we need him friends listen listen it it may not be alcohol or or drugs or pornography in your life but it could be your emotions that are so out of whack that's killing you come on friends we need him we need him I I what I want you to listen we ought to have joy unspeakable and full of Glory Christ why did he Bear all this he bore it so we wouldn't have to bear it now listen friends listen you you know you know you know a brother told me one time Catholic brother I never forget this he told me he said Gabe he's he was a Catholic he said Gabe he said Catholicism is mainly guilt brother that's exact word for word I'll never forget it he said Catholicism is mainly guilt and I'll be honest with you friends we ought not to be in mourning every time we come to the house of God you know you I understand we go through times where we beat ourselves like the Publican and things but you understand what I'm saying it is it ought to we ought to have some Joy but but the thing of it is we're falling under the the the atmosphere of lady oia instead of falling under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that's right friends he packed this he packed this so that we wouldn't have to pack it he went through level three depression so that we wouldn't have to go to level three depression that's right friends he suffered all of that so that we could have our burdens to be light last slide brother Bram said he hasn't left us he proves it now he hasn't left us he never he he he never climbed the highest mountain he climbed Calvary and kept on climbing till he come into the presence of God on the throne in glory he climbed so high he could see the universe from his great Thorn His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he watches me he watches you he's watching this meeting he wants to see what the results will be he will come speak do signs and wonders and go away with the broken heart because people turn him down that same Jesus that I tried to bring to you this evening you have the ability right now to break his heart if you turn him down he'll go away with a broken heart see that's that's that's that's the heart of God if you turn him down he don't get mad at you but it breaks his heart he don't hate you but it really hurts him friends that's the nature of God don't you see how I'll be honest with you Satan painted a picture of God that was totally wrong but the more I look into I'm thinking what my my conception of what God is and his character how he responds to my mistakes my sins my faults my failures is totally wrong wrong my my thought is my my thought of how he's reacting when I do wrong is totally wrong that's right friends we we we got to think of him like this is what what the message is all about so that we can know the nature of God God when when when we when we when we shut the door and close the door he don't say fine but it breaks his heart he goes away like man how am I how am I going to get him and then you know what he'll send brother Craig two weeks later hallu six weeks later he'll anoint brother Brooks to bring it a different direction and then brother Jewel will come three months later and then 6 weeks down the road you'll listen to a message and it'll go that's the God we serve that's our creator want to ask you how many can really say you love him with all your heart he's so special the king of kings and Lord of lords he labors with us you know what's always what what's always just amaze me that God would would would create a creation and then come down in flesh and then serve his creation see that's the nature of God the Bible says he came in the form of a servant a servant serves he walk wash the feet of his own creation troubled in his heart because of what he had to go to and he did it all for us I'd encourage you I'd encourage you brother and sister listen you know and only you know if you turn him down but if you do turn him down remember he's not going to throw your way he just broke his heart but remember he'll be back it may take years but if your name is on that book all of us will just be waiting on you we'll keep having church we'll keep praising God we'll keep preaching the same message and eventually you'll open that door and you'll go Lord I'm sorry and you know what he won't rebuke you he'll he'll open his arms the same way and say oh thank you that's what I wanted it's exactly what I wanted I wanted you to open the door that means open the door their heart amen amen let's just let's just uh bow our heads in a word of prayer precious Lord God my words just it just doesn't seem appropriate Lord what my heart and my being is feeling I just I just pray Lord that God we're just so thankful for you I sometimes we just need another dialect Lord to try to praise you and give you thanks and just I see why it take all the eternities the the Eternal ages to expr exess our joy and appreciation to you Lord and I'm just so grateful Lord for your grace I appreciate you Lord and I'm so thankful that you put these little Snippets Lord throughout your gospels to give us a glimpse of your nature and who you are and how you handled things of life and the things that you felt the things that you went through Lord I I know we all at some point have felt some kind of level of depression we live in this nervous anxious age and God I I pray Lord that we would each one Lord enter into that chamber Lord be still to your spirit Lord that's all we're longing for just pray that you'd speak to us Lord and Lord not only tonight but tomorrow continue to deal with our heart God if we' done anything wrong please help us to make it right Lord we love you and we want to serve
