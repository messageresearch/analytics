[0:01] you love the Lord amen we're just going
[0:03] to go right into the word of God As We
[0:08] Stand we mentioned on
[0:11] last
[0:13] uh Sunday I believe was
[0:16] a when our brother came
[0:23] by we
[0:25] were
[0:27] blessed amen by the grace of God
[0:31] so many ways
[0:34] we uh was going to minister on uh
[0:37] security and so tonight we would like to
[0:41] kind of uh start there uh and I trust by
[0:46] the grace of God it'll
[0:48] be a blessing to
[0:51] you so we're going to ask that you turn
[0:54] with
[0:54] us Amen to James 5
[1:00] we then turn to Revelations 3:14 through
[1:07] 22 and then Revelation 6 back to
[1:11] Revelation
[1:15] James we're living in a time
[1:19] where uh things are becoming more
[1:23] difficult but you know the thing that I
[1:26] love about this message and what God has
[1:30] given to us is that the Covenant in
[1:34] which we have is
[1:38] unconditional we would be in a lot of
[1:42] trouble with God if our Salvation was
[1:48] based upon our
[1:50] works especially in Le
[1:53] oysa when there The Works of very
[1:57] few there was nothing that God could
[2:00] actually brag on about on lead
[2:04] Thea nothing I mean there was really
[2:09] nothing but thank God for his
[2:12] grace that he took us out of
[2:15] Lea and put us in an age that brother
[2:18] brandom acknowledged as the bride
[2:20] age the age in which we will come into a
[2:24] perfect
[2:27] State and I thank God for that it is a
[2:30] covenant that God made with us it's not
[2:34] that we made it with him he made it with
[2:37] us and I am grateful for that let us
[2:41] turn to uh Revelation James as I said
[2:45] five James 5 it'll be a little bit of
[2:49] reading here so I just just have
[2:51] patience with us
[2:58] tonight
[3:02] James 5 beginning at the first
[3:06] verse go to now ye rich
[3:10] men weep and how for your miseries that
[3:13] shall come upon you your riches are
[3:17] corrupt and your garments are moth eaten
[3:21] your gold and silver is cankered and the
[3:23] rust of them shall be a witness against
[3:26] you and shall eat your flesh as it were
[3:28] fire
[3:30] ye have heaped Treasures together for
[3:32] the last days behold the hor of the
[3:35] laborers who have we reaped down your
[3:39] fields which is of you kept back by
[3:42] fraud cth and the cries of them which
[3:46] have reaped are entered into the ears of
[3:49] the Lord of
[3:51] Sabbath ye have lived in pleasure on the
[3:54] earth and been wanting you have
[3:57] nourished your hearts as in a day of
[3:59] sleep slaugh you have condemned and
[4:02] killed the just and he doth not resist
[4:06] you be patient therefore Brethren unto
[4:10] the coming of the Lord behold the
[4:13] husbandman waited for the precious fruit
[4:16] of the earth and have long patience wait
[4:19] for it until you receive the early and
[4:22] latter rain so God is exalting the true
[4:26] seat of God to be ex uh patient and
[4:29] during this time because things are not
[4:31] going to happen the way you want them
[4:35] to be also patient establish your hearts
[4:41] for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
[4:44] Grudge not one against another Brethren
[4:47] lest you be condemned behold the judge
[4:50] standeth before the door take my
[4:53] brethren the prophets who have spoken in
[4:55] the name of the Lord for an example of
[4:57] suffering afflictions and of patience
[5:00] behold we count them happy with endure
[5:02] which endure ye have heard of the
[5:04] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[5:07] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[5:10] and tender
[5:13] Mercy is that
[5:15] okay amen let us turn by the grace of
[5:17] God now to Revelations
[5:25] 3:14 Revelations
[5:28] 3:14
[5:35] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[5:37] leans write these things sayth the
[5:42] amen the faithful and true witness the
[5:46] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[5:49] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[5:51] hard I would that thou work cold or hot
[5:56] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[5:58] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[6:00] out of my mouth because thou sayth I am
[6:03] rich this is where we're going with this
[6:05] and increase with goods and have need of
[6:08] nothing and knoweth not that thou art
[6:11] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[6:17] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[6:19] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[6:23] white reignment that thou may be clothed
[6:25] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[6:27] appear and anoint thine eyes with Isa
[6:31] that thou may
[6:32] see as many as I love I
[6:35] rebuke and chasten be zous therefore and
[6:41] repent behold I stand at the door and
[6:43] knock If any man hear my voice and
[6:46] open uh open the door thank you I will
[6:50] come into him and will s with him and he
[6:54] with
[6:55] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[6:58] to sit with me in my
[7:00] throne even as I also overcame and sat
[7:03] down with my father in his throne he
[7:06] that have an ear let him hear what the
[7:08] spirit of spirit saith unto the churches
[7:11] one more scripture Revelation
[7:17] 6 I'm working with the thought
[7:22] security if I had a theme would be no
[7:24] Hiding
[7:26] Place Revelation 6 beginning at the 15th
[7:31] verse and the kings of the earth and the
[7:34] great men and the rich men and the chief
[7:36] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[7:38] bondman and every Freeman hid themselves
[7:42] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[7:44] mountain and said to the mountains and
[7:47] rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[7:51] face of him that sth on the throne and
[7:54] from the Wrath of the lamb for the great
[7:57] day of his wrath is come who shall be
[8:00] able to stand let us pray father God we
[8:04] come before you Lord as humbly as we
[8:06] know how we thank you for your grace and
[8:09] your mercy we thank you for just being
[8:12] so real to us Lord God I thank you right
[8:16] now for the service and I pray father
[8:19] God that you would bless the service in
[8:21] a special way that we might be able to
[8:23] hear and understand and receive of your
[8:26] word Lord we pray right now in your
[8:29] precious name Let Your Divine will be
[8:31] done in our lives in Jesus Christ's name
[8:34] we pray
[8:36] amen you may be
[8:40] seated when I was in
[8:44] aine or in that way we had spoken with
[8:49] the individual and he was asking uh
[8:55] for uh a little uh counseling he wanted
[8:59] to to
[9:00] know what uh to do uh in light of what
[9:04] he felt God was calling him to
[9:07] do and the first thing I said to
[9:11] him I said brother this is what I did
[9:15] and this is what you have to do and I
[9:17] said when you do it
[9:19] correctly expect Satan to be angry and
[9:22] expect people not to
[9:25] understand I said I want you to go home
[9:28] or go somewhere and I want you to think
[9:30] about all of your
[9:31] [Music]
[9:32] priorities and I want you to list your
[9:36] priorities from one to whatever
[9:40] 10 and wherever God is I want you to put
[9:45] him as number
[9:50] one I said I want you to list all of
[9:52] your
[9:54] priorities and then I want you to
[9:57] go and wherever God is because you got
[10:01] to be honest in this in order for it to
[10:04] work I want you to be honest I said you
[10:07] put God
[10:08] one and now you got a place to
[10:13] work right now you have a place to work
[10:16] because I find out that in most
[10:19] Christian lives God is not number
[10:22] one now I told him this I said now I
[10:26] want you to understand what God did to
[10:27] his disciples
[10:30] Jesus Christ when he called them he made
[10:33] sure he was number
[10:35] one because he called for them to leave
[10:40] everything I mean they couldn't have no
[10:44] riches he pulled them away from their
[10:47] families and he basically said I'm your
[10:50] Shepherd follow
[10:54] me and for whatever reason he
[10:57] understood that those men
[11:00] had the ability to make him number
[11:05] one nobody struggled within that group
[11:09] about Jesus Christ being the number one
[11:13] man except for
[11:16] Judas I said think about it now you
[11:19] talking about giving God your allwe look
[11:22] what he
[11:24] required from his first set of disciples
[11:28] I said I'm not tell telling you to quit
[11:29] your job or anything like that but what
[11:32] I am telling you is that God requires to
[11:35] be number one in your life otherwise no
[11:39] matter what you do it won't be affected
[11:42] you will not be able to accomplish what
[11:44] you want to accomplish in God until he
[11:49] is number
[11:51] one all right outside of that you find
[11:56] out that if he's not number one
[11:58] everything that's above
[12:01] him has become an idol in your
[12:04] life you have chosen to worship that
[12:09] over
[12:10] Christ and I said you've got to get rid
[12:14] of all your
[12:16] Idols if you're not left with anything
[12:19] but Jesus Christ that's
[12:22] enough hello you take job for an
[12:26] example they accuse job and they said
[12:29] unto job the reason why the devil said
[12:31] the reason why job Ser serve you because
[12:34] you got a hedge about
[12:36] him Jesus Christ or God said not so I
[12:39] know the man job try him if you like do
[12:43] whatever you want to do but don't hurt
[12:44] the oil in the
[12:45] wine in other words don't take away the
[12:48] joy of the Lord from out of his heart
[12:51] concerning me because job proved to God
[12:56] that all the things that he saw whether
[12:59] it was his children that God had given
[13:02] him whether it was all of the wealth
[13:03] that God had given him he proved to all
[13:06] that was around him in spite of it all
[13:10] God was number one naked did I come into
[13:14] this world he said and naked I will
[13:17] return so he recognized and and that's
[13:20] the way it is that's why God even said
[13:23] to the disciples I mean not to just the
[13:25] disciples but he said to the children of
[13:27] Israel the first commandment
[13:29] love the Lord thy God with all of your
[13:31] heart with all of your mind with all of
[13:34] your soul is that right amen it's never
[13:39] changed amen it's never changed now I
[13:43] I'm saying all of these things because I
[13:46] believe that if we could all be honest
[13:48] with
[13:49] ourselves you can truly see for the most
[13:53] part he's not number one and he needs to
[13:56] be so all right now now we always talk
[14:00] about an unconditional Covenant but I
[14:03] want you to recognize the unconditional
[14:06] Covenant is given to Abraham's seed
[14:10] now all that claim to be Abraham's seed
[14:13] is not Abraham's seed true Israel are
[14:18] those who are born again amen hello
[14:21] somebody so the Covenant is given to
[14:24] those who are born again sealed with the
[14:28] Holy Ghost however you want to look at
[14:30] it that is the unconditional Covenant
[14:33] because God cannot curse
[14:36] himself
[14:38] hello listen we see there in the
[14:42] scripture and that's why I read those
[14:45] scriptures because I want you to
[14:47] understand that the
[14:49] spirit of uh of this age and and you
[14:52] know we look at Rich and increase with
[14:55] goods and have need of nothing that is
[14:58] the attitude that is now moving among
[15:03] the people of God and when we allow that
[15:08] Spirit to anoint us we're basically
[15:11] stepping out of our place of
[15:15] security
[15:16] hello the psalmist says hide me under th
[15:19] thy wings oh God see we need a hiding
[15:23] place from whom
[15:25] ourselves not just the devil we need a
[15:28] hiding place from
[15:31] ourselves now we looked and we said well
[15:33] brother BRS what are you saying I'm not
[15:35] saying that you and I can can't come
[15:37] short or do wrong after receiving the
[15:40] Holy Ghost because the Bible said grieve
[15:43] not the Holy Spirit whereby you were
[15:45] sealed to the day of your
[15:47] Redemption now come on somebody that is
[15:50] top notot security
[15:53] amen you can't get no secure than that
[15:56] Hallelujah come on somebody amen that
[15:59] you God knew even when he gave you the
[16:03] holy ghost that you would make mistakes
[16:09] am I was telling somebody just the other
[16:12] day I said remember brother branam being
[16:15] a great prophet of
[16:17] God was going to beat up a
[16:21] man he's got the Holy Ghost he's seen
[16:25] Miracles he's seen signs he's met the
[16:27] angel of the Lord he's seen the pillar
[16:29] of
[16:30] fire and God had to come back and said
[16:33] if you don't
[16:34] move when you see this event
[16:38] happened this other event you beating
[16:40] this man kicking him down the hill and
[16:42] all of these things for being
[16:44] disrespectful why am I saying this with
[16:48] all of that God in him he still had a
[16:53] potential that human element was still
[16:57] there and had not God intervened for
[17:02] him he would have made the
[17:05] headlines in a different
[17:07] way y y'all hear what I'm saying I'm
[17:11] saying all of this is that so that you
[17:13] won't you you might you may not so you
[17:15] won't misunderstand flesh is
[17:22] flesh and if God wouldn't protect us and
[17:26] keep us from a lot of things a lot of
[17:29] things we would be
[17:31] doing it is God who
[17:35] keeps he is The Keeper of the
[17:38] Soul
[17:39] Hallelujah now my thing is is that when
[17:42] we talking about a secured
[17:46] place let me put it this
[17:49] way what was the difference between
[17:52] Israel in
[17:55] Egypt can I can I tell you if you don't
[17:57] know what was the difference
[17:59] the word is
[18:02] between because in
[18:04] between Israel and Egypt was the
[18:10] blood the blood on the doorpost in the
[18:13] L hello somebody Israel was just as evil
[18:17] as they was going to be amen behind that
[18:21] blood but the blood protected
[18:27] them because amen what was God
[18:30] illustrating the
[18:32] flesh your flesh is going to be as
[18:35] evil as it ever been ain't nothing
[18:39] converted about your
[18:41] flesh come on somebody the only reason
[18:44] why God don't judge you according to the
[18:48] flesh is because of the
[18:50] blood oh y'all to be happy
[18:54] tonight Israel was under the law this
[18:57] flesh amen came can't even be governed
[18:59] by the law but it is the blood of Jesus
[19:03] Christ that protects God from attacking
[19:09] you I don't know no other ways even the
[19:12] prophet of God had that had to be
[19:15] revealed to him remember the woman amen
[19:18] with the purple hair and the purple
[19:19] fingernails and toenails and everything
[19:21] else that were
[19:22] purple and here she was amen who had
[19:25] been in a state of mind amen she was so
[19:28] bad actually and I believe if I got it
[19:30] right she was a preacher's
[19:32] wife am I correct
[19:37] Brothers Preacher's Daughter okay
[19:40] somewhere in
[19:42] there but my point is I knew that there
[19:44] was a
[19:45] relationship and she
[19:49] backslid and she was in a place Satan
[19:52] had taken her into such a dark place
[19:55] wherein that she thought she couldn't be
[19:57] saved
[19:59] because she had done so many bad
[20:06] things
[20:07] hello but what she failed to see the
[20:10] reason why a great judgment had not come
[20:13] to her even in her backsliding sliding
[20:15] state was the blood of
[20:18] Jesus see because once a Christian is
[20:21] always a Christian if it's real yes
[20:25] amen y'all hear what I'm saying that Old
[20:28] Devil I have you all beat down like you
[20:30] can't do nothing you done send away your
[20:31] day of grace and the blood of Jesus
[20:33] Christ is still protecting you amen
[20:36] thank you talk about
[20:38] security this lady didn't even know what
[20:41] was in the Assurance
[20:44] package and it took a prophet to come by
[20:47] and read her what was in the small
[20:50] print amen God every for giving up given
[20:53] up on you you may have G given up on God
[20:58] but I just talk to
[20:59] him and he told me you was his daughter
[21:03] Hallelujah hello the Bible say God loves
[21:06] the backslider amen that's why I I in
[21:10] prayer we we we prayed that God would
[21:12] bring back the
[21:14] backsliders amen those who of us who was
[21:17] there we pray that God would bring back
[21:19] the backsliders that somehow God will
[21:22] reveal to them that he still loves
[21:27] them
[21:29] it's a good place a place of security
[21:32] see my thing is this you can have all
[21:35] the wealth in the world you can have the
[21:37] greatest or the highest or prestigious
[21:40] job but that means
[21:44] nothing cuz they're dying up there
[21:48] too you know everybody have their dreams
[21:51] and their plans about in this life come
[21:53] on first of all as a Christian you've
[21:55] got no business
[21:57] dreaming
[21:59] because when you come into God you gave
[22:01] it up am at least that's what you're
[22:03] supposed to
[22:05] do huh you supposed to surrender your
[22:07] whole entire life to God and be led by
[22:10] God you got no business
[22:13] planning without God's permission
[22:17] amen can I get a
[22:20] witness y'all hear what I'm saying when
[22:23] we began to start uh looking and and and
[22:26] our leadership began uh we become our
[22:28] our own leader then you're in trouble
[22:31] amen because as a Christian you
[22:34] surrender your headship to whom Jesus
[22:38] Christ
[22:40] himself and every time you get into this
[22:43] leadership thing Satan is going to cause
[22:45] you to shipwreck and don't you blame
[22:50] God hello whatsoever you do in word or
[22:54] do deed do it all in the name of the
[22:57] Lord Jesus then you're
[23:00] saved amen come on somebody I'm so glad
[23:04] that God knows how to chastise
[23:06] us I'm so glad he knows how to break a
[23:08] leg or two y'all don't like that any but
[23:11] I'm telling you if I get out of the way
[23:13] so much I want to break my leg bring me
[23:18] back God loves
[23:21] us he does he loves us and you know we
[23:25] we we're we're blessed to have such a
[23:27] god
[23:31] Psalms 32
[23:34] and7
[23:37] says Thou Art my Hiding
[23:40] Place thou shal preserve me from
[23:43] trouble thou shall Compass me about with
[23:47] songs of
[23:49] Deliverance
[23:53] say so if he going to Encompass me about
[23:56] with songs of Deliverance doesn't mean
[23:58] he he's not going to let me get into a
[23:59] place that I need
[24:03] Deliverance what would I need
[24:05] Deliverance songs
[24:07] for if God is not going to allow me to
[24:10] get into a place where I need
[24:12] Deliverance but look what the Bible said
[24:14] he's preserving my soul even when I need
[24:17] Deliverance

[26:13] this cuz I I've been there many
[26:17] times come on where we let when we know
[26:21] we've been warn we allow our
[26:23] emotions to rise above the
[26:27] word
[26:29] hello somebody can I get an amen my
[26:33] point is this amen we allow our our
[26:36] emotions to get above the
[26:39] word when the word has declared us
[26:43] sinless amen or without
[26:47] sin and we are looking at our state when
[26:51] we make
[26:53] mistakes and we think oh
[26:56] my it's awful and it
[26:59] is but once you acknowledge it you
[27:02] spring back up Hallelujah to where
[27:04] you're supposed to be amen hello that's
[27:07] right now my point is
[27:10] this because that's how you please
[27:14] God can I say this the scripture said a
[27:18] just man falls seven times in a day how
[27:20] many times did you fall
[27:25] today y'all hear what I'm saying come on
[27:28] but the Bible said what the great thing
[27:30] about the just man is he getes up
[27:33] amen it's not the fall because why would
[27:37] the Bible put it there if he knew you
[27:39] would never fall amen come on why would
[27:43] the Bible put it there but he said the
[27:45] just man not only does he fall he gets
[27:48] up amen that's What Makes You righteous
[27:52] that's what makes you just having the
[27:54] ability to say I am sorry Lord forgive
[27:58] me and let me tell you something there
[27:59] have been times in my life I sound like
[28:01] a a broken record Lord forgive me Lord
[28:04] forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive
[28:08] me I mean in one
[28:13] day I it's the
[28:15] truth I think God trying to bring some
[28:18] peace and joy to your heart if you let
[28:20] him you know and and it's true we say
[28:23] well I'm not a Catholic but we feel like
[28:25] it sometimes we feel like we know the
[28:27] word and after God has made right with
[28:29] us or we made right with word we got to
[28:31] show the sad like countenance to make
[28:34] him know that we're
[28:38] sad I don't think so I think when the
[28:40] high priest got behind that curtain and
[28:42] he realized what do you think all of
[28:44] that incense and stuff for all that was
[28:46] was confessing sin all that was was
[28:49] confessing sins and say God we're wrong
[28:52] and you're right and we haven't hidden
[28:54] anything before us we are making it
[28:57] known to you that we need you as our
[29:00] hiding
[29:04] place now every one of us that will be
[29:07] legalistic about things don't don't you
[29:10] understand let me put it this way the
[29:12] harder you are on others will be the
[29:15] heart of your judgment will be on you
[29:18] where Mercy is
[29:19] given amen Mercy is
[29:22] obtained when Grace is given Grace is
[29:26] obtained am Hallelujah he said unto the
[29:29] Pharisees and the Sadducees you know
[29:30] what he said he said you left off the
[29:32] weight of of things you did all the The
[29:35] Works you did all these things he said
[29:37] but the thing you left off which was
[29:39] greater to me was mercy and Truth
[29:45] amen what truth are you talking about
[29:48] let him that is without sin cast the
[29:52] first
[29:57] stone
[30:02] are you being blessed
[30:07] tonight let's move
[30:09] on you said a shield yes a shield that
[30:15] God can hide his people in it but listen
[30:18] look what happens to those who are not
[30:20] in Christ the Bible said they ran into
[30:23] the cave they ran into the mountains
[30:25] rocks fall on us how hide us from the
[30:30] face of him who SATs on the throne we're
[30:34] not saying that we're the ones who
[30:37] saying Lord reveal it show me your face
[30:41] I want to see you face to face why
[30:44] because we realize that this is where
[30:47] this is our hope this is where our faith
[30:49] lay
[30:51] amen oh I love this scripture Isaiah 32
[30:56] and2 a man shall be as a hiding place
[31:01] from the
[31:03] wind and a covered from The Tempest as
[31:06] rivers of water in dry places as the
[31:09] shadow of a great rock in a weary land
[31:12] now what man you think he talking
[31:15] about there is number one man that
[31:18] becomes a hiding place Paul said our
[31:21] lives are HID where in Christ
[31:25] Jesus woo you say what do you mean I'm
[31:28] going to tell you something before Jesus
[31:30] Christ when Jesus Christ had the
[31:31] scripture said death was swallowed up
[31:34] amen death was swallowed up and let me
[31:37] tell you something if you in him death
[31:39] has been swallowed up your sins have
[31:41] been swallowed up everything about you
[31:43] have been swallowed
[31:45] up am I making
[31:48] sense he's the one God that can
[31:50] neutralize
[31:52] everything he yes and because we're in
[31:56] him God sees no sin
[31:59] amen don't get me wrong shall we
[32:02] continue in sin that Grace May abound
[32:05] God forbid every time we do wrong we
[32:08] supposed to ask God for in a sincere way
[32:11] to not only forgive us but cleanse us
[32:15] and let me put it this way brother
[32:16] Brandon when he lied Amen to that
[32:18] insurance man or when they came by says
[32:21] uh honey tell him I'm not at home y'all
[32:23] remember that story the Bible said that
[32:26] I mean brother Brown said when he got
[32:27] and he got to himself he went up and he
[32:30] prayed for so many hours Lord whatever
[32:34] you do don't let me do this
[32:36] again over a
[32:39] lie he sought God in such a sincere way
[32:42] over a lie he did not ever want to do
[32:45] that again how many of us do that see
[32:48] what I'm saying it's always in prayer
[32:51] amen
[32:53] repentance and and and sincerity it
[32:55] comes in prayer that's why the devil
[32:58] blocks that door when you know you need
[33:00] to pray he blocks it and you know how he
[33:02] blocks it he takes away
[33:06] feelings because you don't feel
[33:08] him you don't feel like you
[33:15] praying Hallelujah and you don't feel
[33:17] him so you don't pray what's to use he
[33:19] got you he got you cuz God is not a god
[33:23] of feelings amen he's a god of Faith
[33:26] Hallelujah and when ha can get you on
[33:29] your feelings I don't he I don't feel
[33:30] like he's hearing me I don't feel like
[33:32] my prayers going to the ceiling not even
[33:34] up there maybe you know I mean he's got
[33:37] you when can you feel your
[33:41] prayers I've never felt my
[33:44] prayers I've felt the Holy Spirit but
[33:48] I've never felt my
[33:50] prayers huh huh and let me tell you
[33:53] something many times listen last night I
[33:55] was here praying and I think I started
[33:57] snoring a little bit and God get I
[33:59] caught myself Lord Jesus thank you thank
[34:01] you thank you because I'm glad I didn't
[34:04] go into the third level but
[34:06] nevertheless I caught myself snoring and
[34:08] I began to thank God for it why because
[34:11] he awakened
[34:12] me he knew my sincere desire was to pray
[34:16] I came tired I struggled but I didn't
[34:19] feel
[34:20] him but I knew he was
[34:24] there and when you don't feel him don't
[34:26] you ever quit I don't care if you got to
[34:28] go an hour and two however long you pour
[34:30] your heart out to God because I want you
[34:33] to understand those Pharisees and I'm
[34:35] Excuse me those those priests do you
[34:37] really think they were feeling
[34:40] much everything had become a a
[34:45] ritual that's one thing I love about the
[34:47] Muslims I don't know what they what they
[34:49] feel but every whatever time of the day
[34:51] they are bow down before God in the
[34:53] streets no matter where they are they
[34:56] pre I wonder what they're
[35:02] feeling but they're so into that ritual
[35:05] they they there they're there under all
[35:07] of that unbelief but yet and still in
[35:10] their eyes they're praying to the
[35:12] almighty
[35:13] God and they
[35:17] Faith but it's so
[35:19] sad because they are of a a
[35:23] religion without
[35:25] salvation faithful
[35:28] and so a lot of these denominational
[35:32] churches
[35:35] religious plenty of
[35:38] it but have no
[35:42] salvation and like the brother brought
[35:44] out the other day there's a difference
[35:46] between
[35:47] saved and
[35:51] Redemption you can be saved amen by
[35:53] giving somebody a drink of water in the
[35:55] name of the
[35:56] Lord but because you're saved doesn't
[35:59] mean you came from God amen amen
[36:03] hallelujah but Redemption means I was
[36:05] there with him I came to buy back that
[36:09] which is
[36:12] mine Hallelujah so I'm not just saved
[36:14] I'm
[36:15] redeemed y'all hear what I'm saying I'm
[36:18] redeemed are you redeemed
[36:25] tonight Hallelujah a man as a hiding
[36:29] place he got it right on the head there
[36:31] I'm telling you ain't God good to us
[36:34] security I looked up that word it means
[36:37] free from risk or
[36:39] danger safety free from doubt anxiety
[36:45] fear see when you secure you don't have
[36:49] those things going on in
[36:51] you hello if you really believe the word
[36:54] and you know it's true what is the
[36:56] anxiety about
[36:58] what is the doubt about like I said
[37:01] there in accurity until you and I come
[37:03] to a place and you recognize that this
[37:05] word is
[37:07] God not a part of him it is God God and
[37:12] His word is and this word must be
[37:15] elevated above your thoughts your
[37:18] desires and everything else it must rule
[37:21] your
[37:24] life all of our Lives is is a constant
[37:28] dying out a constant fighting if you
[37:31] ever think your flesh going to give you
[37:32] a rest you are deceived The Devil Ride

[37:43] mule something that gives an assurance

[38:24] church is that right if they shall lay
[38:27] hands on the sick they what shall
[38:28] recover
[38:30] guaranteed I if you work in faith is
[38:33] guaranteed now the truth of the matter
[38:35] is you know how brother bandam preached
[38:37] a trial it comes when God wants it to
[38:41] you can't get put an element or time
[38:42] element on what God going to do when
[38:44] he's getting ready to fix it you can't
[38:46] hurry God let that song say you just got
[38:49] to
[38:51] wait gold tried in the
[38:54] fire how you going to be gold if there
[38:57] ain't no fire amen trying you a lot of
[39:00] times the devil allow things to come on
[39:02] you or to come back on you just to see
[39:04] how bad you want it amen
[39:13] amen I know what I'm talking about
[39:15] because I'm talking from
[39:17] experience how bad do you want it am how
[39:20] bad do you want God at a time like this
[39:23] how bad do you want God at a time like
[39:27] this
[39:27] now I'm preaching to myself how bad
[39:30] y'all don't know what I go
[39:34] through y'all don't have no
[39:37] idea and don't go talking to my wife
[39:41] either but my point is this we all have
[39:47] something that we're weak to am I only
[39:52] one is there anything come on somebody
[39:55] listen brother brandham
[39:58] he he had this this issue with him it
[40:00] was a sickness he had it you know did
[40:03] you know that brother brand said he had
[40:04] a thing about
[40:09] exaggerating and he can't he could not
[40:12] determine
[40:13] numbers so if it was 400 he might say a
[40:16] little more than that because he could
[40:18] because he could discern you know he
[40:19] didn't but he had a way
[40:23] of that's a
[40:26] man
[40:28] oh y'all y'all looking at me like I'm
[40:29] crazy but that's a
[40:33] man how many of y'all have told told uh
[40:36] have have told the same story over and
[40:38] over again
[40:41] exactly if you didn't somewhere you
[40:49] exaggerated thank God for the grace of
[40:52] God Amen so I'm I'm I'm just just just
[40:56] so you can understand understand what
[40:57] I'm saying now when we look at this
[41:00] thing you know we talking about um we
[41:03] look at security and you know it just
[41:05] makes me sick sometime you know me and
[41:08] my computer if I could give him a couple
[41:10] of punches he probably punch me back but
[41:13] but my point is you know I'm such an
[41:15] innocent I I say like this when it come
[41:17] to computers I'm not
[41:19] smart I I just do the minimum and I
[41:23] still have
[41:24] trouble sometime they they come and
[41:26] advertise stuff and I'm thinking it's
[41:28] something I need and I already got
[41:31] it you know but my point is a lot of
[41:33] time we think things are
[41:35] secure even on your
[41:38] computers oh if I put it on my computer
[41:40] I got it secure but now they try to tell
[41:42] you it's not secure so have a backup
[41:46] system but even your backup system is
[41:48] not secure because now we know that
[41:51] we've got these computer geeks that can
[41:53] get into those
[41:54] systems and know all your business
[41:58] so in man's world there is no
[42:02] security oh I I've got a job and I'm
[42:05] secure on my job no you're
[42:08] not don't ever think that you're secure
[42:11] on a job because things can change
[42:14] overnight and there have been times
[42:16] where whole companies had to close and
[42:19] shut down overnight and people thought
[42:21] they were
[42:24] secure huh
[42:27] listen folks we're not
[42:30] guaranteed The Next Breath of
[42:32] Life we could all die right
[42:36] now there is no security in this man
[42:39] thing
[42:41] here hello oh the rich man thought he
[42:44] was
[42:45] Secure just the only thing he did he
[42:47] just come up he lived a wonderful life
[42:50] he had his bonds and stuff built and
[42:52] things like that he he just looked
[42:54] really good and it didn't look sinful
[42:58] no but what it was is that God was not
[43:01] his number
[43:02] one he literally built his whole life
[43:05] around his career and he thought he was
[43:07] Secure in his career and God said but
[43:09] you're
[43:11] foolish you didn't make preparation you
[43:14] made preparations to live in this Earth
[43:16] but you did not make preparations to
[43:20] die and all of us I don't care how
[43:24] important your this worldly life may
[43:26] seem to be to you
[43:28] you better make sure you have made right
[43:30] preparation because every one of us
[43:32] going to either die or make a
[43:35] translation hello and what we see
[43:38] tomorrow or I see you tomorrow if the
[43:40] Lord's will because you don't know
[43:41] whether you're going to see
[43:44] tomorrow secure means to be freedom from
[43:47] financial
[43:49] care I wonder what's going to happen to
[43:51] all those secured people when the stock
[43:54] market
[43:55] crash and you what so gets me people
[43:58] said I'm going to get me some gold I
[44:00] mean the dollar going to go and I buy me
[44:02] some gold hello there's no security in
[44:06] that because listen the mark the Beast
[44:09] said you're not going to buyself no
[44:11] matter how much gold you got
[44:15] amen except you receive the Mark I don't
[44:18] care if you got for knocks as an
[44:21] inheritance you won't be able to spend
[44:24] one bar one piece of gold on a loaf for
[44:29] bread when that system claps down so
[44:33] where would your security be it must be
[44:36] in
[44:38] God and if it's not in God you're in
[44:41] trouble amen because everybody that's
[44:43] not found in God goes
[44:46] where out of
[44:52] Darkness now what happens when you
[44:54] really what what happens you ever seen a
[44:56] rich man he got he he know he's secure
[44:57] look at him look at him he walks all
[44:59] proud and head all
[45:02] up he there's an air about him there is
[45:05] a Heir about the man he can't help it he
[45:08] feels
[45:10] secure when he's not what about a
[45:13] Believer there ought to be an air about
[45:15] you amen when you know that you know
[45:18] that you know amen that you're saved not
[45:21] only save but your bride material
[45:23] Hallelujah there ought to be an heir
[45:25] about you amen
[45:29] one of the worst things you can see I
[45:31] remember going down to the farmers's
[45:32] market and every time I went down to the
[45:34] farmers market would see these
[45:35] Pentecostal people they always look like
[45:38] they just ate lime or some lemon fruit
[45:42] they look like the saddest Bunch down
[45:44] there had long hair and long dresses and
[45:47] a long face to go with it and I thought
[45:50] to myself there ain't nothing Glory
[45:52] about ain't nothing happy about why
[45:54] would I even inquire about what you
[45:55] believe
[45:59] see that us not become that
[46:05] amen like I said I uh uh this lady was
[46:10] saying waiting on me and she said oh you
[46:12] know you every time I look you just look
[46:14] so happy and and I didn't know
[46:19] that I mean I had a man at the come and
[46:21] go said oh man you always looking like
[46:23] you're so happy about things then I'm
[46:25] thinking I didn't know that you know but
[46:27] the thing is I got Jesus on my mind I
[46:30] got a song I got something going on on
[46:32] the inside didn't even know it was
[46:34] showing on the outside but other people
[46:37] can see
[46:47] that even in the barber shop when I went
[46:49] to the barber today I had a really lot
[46:51] of things on my mind and what was on my
[46:53] mind was their
[46:54] discussion the the barber man said you
[46:56] are right you seem to be quiet I said
[46:58] yeah I just got a lot on my
[47:00] mind it was
[47:03] horrible but you know the thing about it
[47:05] is you look at things and you think Lord
[47:07] what's going to happen to these
[47:09] people my heart goes out because I tried
[47:13] to even witness at the barber shop and
[47:15] got shut
[47:16] down now they act like I ain't never
[47:18] told them I was a

[55:58] Testament Saints died in
[56:02] faith in what invisible things things
[56:06] that they couldn't even see nor
[56:08] understand but they trusted The God Who
[56:10] told them about
[56:13] it trust in the Lord at all times ye

[56:26] place should run to in times of trouble
[56:30] he will hide me come on
[56:32] somebody now listen I wish I wish God
[56:36] would just allow let me say it like this
[56:39] I don't know
[56:41] why and we all do it we fail to see
[56:45] we're in a
[56:46] battle we're not wrestling against flesh
[56:49] and blood we're rasing against spiritual
[56:52] wickedness in high
[56:53] places right and you know we all
[56:57] forget right we fail to see the enemy
[57:01] because we don't see him but he's there
[57:04] fighting us he knows the stand we're
[57:06] taking and he's going to do any and
[57:08] everything else to bring us down from
[57:11] that
[57:13] stand
[57:15] right listen let me put it this way how
[57:17] do you know or how do you let me put
[57:20] this where every test and trial you go
[57:21] through do you know that the devil had
[57:24] to go before God and said let me try
[57:33] let me ask you a question then do you
[57:35] think
[57:40] job at any time didn't want
[57:45] healing of course he did but the more
[57:49] you he inquired and probably hoped the
[57:51] balls got
[57:54] worse not knowing his integrity was
[57:57] being
[58:00] tested the trials were coming worse and
[58:03] worse and like what's going
[58:07] on huh and God will move himself back
[58:10] just to see okay the devil says well see
[58:13] I I I I can I can get her to do whatever
[58:16] and and she going to leave and this and
[58:17] that and and God says no no no no no
[58:20] amen no because I realized that this
[58:22] individual love me
[58:24] unconditionally it ain't how good I do
[58:26] for them and how I bless them but they
[58:29] love me they've experienced that they
[58:31] they're at a place of no return anybody
[58:34] know what I'm talking
[58:37] about and I hope the con brother Conley
[58:40] and sister Vanda don't mind me using
[58:42] them but uh and I'm not trying to
[58:45] embarrass them but if I've ever seen
[58:48] faith
[58:50] exemplified I really have seen it in
[58:52] those
[58:55] two
[58:56] and you know and and I look at sister
[58:58] Vanda and how she comes and she's fought
[59:02] and she's fought and she's fought and
[59:04] she's fought and every time she can put
[59:07] herself in this church she's here amen
[59:11] how many of
[59:12] us and you can't tell me that sister
[59:14] wasn't feeling a real sick at times and
[59:17] she sit right up there the best she
[59:19] could wanting to hear the word she
[59:21] couldn't do that on her own that is not
[59:24] a natural thing that is super
[59:26] Supernatural and God shows us these
[59:28] things and I think a lot of us we look
[59:30] at her and we pity her but that ain't
[59:32] pity that's
[59:34] faith on both of their parts faith and
[59:38] we looking at y'all don't see what God
[59:40] is
[59:41] doing God builds rapturing Faith by
[59:44] situations like that because if he if
[59:47] you can believe God when he's not healed
[59:49] you like you want him to you can still
[59:51] hold fast to a Rapture
[59:54] amen that's rapture in faith people
[59:57] that's a building of character am loving
[1:00:01] God unconditionally believing him when
[1:00:03] you can't see it with your
[1:00:07] eyes I don't see how God going to change
[1:00:09] me but I believe it with all my heart
[1:00:12] and the closer I get to the Rapture the
[1:00:14] more wicked this thing
[1:00:17] becomes but there's something on the
[1:00:19] inside of this inside that can never be
[1:00:22] ever changed when it comes to God
[1:00:24] because it's secured am Hallelujah in
[1:00:27] secured
[1:00:33] people that old preacher got tired of

[1:01:56] in Babylon thought Babylon was the
[1:01:57] greatest Empire on the world and it
[1:01:59] would never fall fell
[1:02:03] overnight come on somebody what about
[1:02:05] Rome who thought they would be they were
[1:02:07] the Invincible Kingdom of all times and
[1:02:09] would never go down men put their trust
[1:02:12] in that
[1:02:14] Empire what about Germany who was
[1:02:16] raising up to be a great nation and they
[1:02:19] thought they were secure
[1:02:22] too
[1:02:24] h
[1:02:28] if Rome had only heard the Centurion
[1:02:30] when he said truly this is the Son of
[1:02:34] God hallelujah they would have
[1:02:37] recognized there was a greater
[1:02:39] Kingdom something to put more trust in
[1:02:42] in the Roman Empire is that right if
[1:02:44] they had heard the decree of of
[1:02:46] Nebuchadnezzar amen he said therefore I
[1:02:48] make a decree that every people Nation
[1:02:51] language which speak anything am against
[1:02:54] the god of Shadrach Meshach and they go
[1:02:56] shall be cut in pieces and their houses
[1:02:58] shall be made a dung Hill because there
[1:02:59] is no other God that can deliver after
[1:03:02] this s if they had heard
[1:03:06] that they would have recognized there
[1:03:08] was a greater Kingdom than
[1:03:11] Babylon amen people of God Amen you
