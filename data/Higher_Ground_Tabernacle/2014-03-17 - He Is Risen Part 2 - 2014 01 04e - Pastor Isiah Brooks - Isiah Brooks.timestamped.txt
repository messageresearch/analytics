[1:22] God knoweth such a one caught up to the
[1:25] third heaven I knew such a man whether
[1:29] inod or out of the body I cannot tell
[1:33] God knoweth how that he was caught up
[1:35] into paradise and heard unspeakable word
[1:39] which is not lawful for a man to utter
[1:43] of such a one will I Glory yet of myself
[1:46] I will not Glory but in my infirm let us
[1:50] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[1:53] you Lord we thank you for your grace we

[2:42] evening we believe father we thank you
[2:44] for everything Lord in Jesus Christ's
[2:47] name we pray amen you may be
[2:53] seated by the grace of God we
[2:56] showed how that the Roman seal has
[2:58] always tried trying to keep Jesus down
[3:02] locked in we showed you by the grace of
[3:05] God how that you know spiritually that
[3:08] is what Satan is doing not just among
[3:11] the uh nominal churches but I find out
[3:14] that even among the message churches
[3:16] people are getting so sto cold and
[3:19] starchy and stiff and uh we find out
[3:22] that they don't understand that that is
[3:25] a spirit that God is not pleased with it
[3:29] is the spirit of
[3:31] antichrist and so therefore amen you
[3:34] must fight amen the Bible tells us that
[3:36] we must contend for the faith that's not
[3:39] just for the word only but the spirit of
[3:41] the word amen because we realize amen
[3:45] that we being the female or the woman
[3:47] part of Christ you and I must produce
[3:50] children and you must and the only way
[3:52] that you can produce word children it
[3:55] must be under the the atmosphere amen of
[3:58] the word is that right right amen we
[4:00] realize amen this morning that it can't
[4:03] be lukewarm amen because God said it
[4:06] must be a temperature that is hot y'all
[4:09] heard my testimony before amen there's a
[4:12] time I preached on Shadrach meach and
[4:14] abedo amen and my young daughter was I
[4:16] think she was around seven years old and
[4:18] she said to me Daddy she said I know why
[4:21] God came down in Into the Fire furnace I
[4:24] said how come honey he said because amen
[4:27] you know they he hated it up seven times
[4:30] harder and that was the place he could
[4:32] be comfortable in so I hope by the grace
[4:35] of God we can get it all hot tonight
[4:37] amen till the Holy Spirit can come down
[4:39] and be comfortable in service is that
[4:42] all right so we realize amen by the
[4:44] grace of God Amen as I said earlier amen
[4:48] the only way that we know to uh fight uh
[4:52] this Spirit we must contend for the
[4:54] faith we must allow the world to know
[4:57] amen that we are alive
[5:00] we can't allow the Roman Stone to stay
[5:02] over the tomb y'all understand what I
[5:04] mean amen we must break out as he break
[5:07] in amen so we realize by the grace of
[5:10] God Amen that this brother brandom said
[5:12] the true Easter seal amen is the Holy
[5:16] Ghost and we find out there so many
[5:18] people don't even know what the Holy
[5:19] Ghost is but I thank God by the grace of
[5:22] God we know what he is and who he is
[5:25] this this evening amen so we realize
[5:28] amen that as he said in the true Easter
[5:30] seal message the genuine uh Easter true
[5:33] Easter seal shows that sin has been paid
[5:36] for for you and God has accepted you
[5:40] amen and you're sealed into Christ by
[5:43] the Holy Ghost and therefore sin is
[5:47] finished amen is that all right there
[5:50] was a question asked him Amen in uh
[5:54] question and answers amen How could a
[5:56] man live above or live so close to God
[6:00] he would be without sin his his and
[6:04] brother BR goes on and says his love did
[6:06] it his love said uh love paid for our
[6:11] sins his love uh taken it away love is
[6:15] the most powerful force there is and he
[6:20] used that scripture Ephesians 1:4
[6:23] according as he have chosen Us in him
[6:27] before the foundation of the world that
[6:29] we should be holy and Without Blame come
[6:33] on somebody holy and Without Blame amen
[6:38] before him in love Hallelujah somebody
[6:41] ought to be happy that this evening Amen
[6:43] to understand that because of his love
[6:46] he presents us to himself Hallelujah
[6:50] you've heard me say many times there was
[6:52] only one accepted Hallelujah and that
[6:55] was Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah
[6:57] Moses wasn't accepted Elijah wasn't
[7:00] accepted Hallelujah Noah wasn't accepted
[7:04] Hallelujah the only way we ever would be
[7:06] accepted is end of in love which is
[7:08] Jesus Christ himself is that right when
[7:12] the seals were opened the Bible said no
[7:14] man amen was found worthy Hallelujah but
[7:18] because we were found in him we're
[7:21] worthy because he's worthy every Victory
[7:24] he won we won every glorified thing he
[7:27] did we did Hallelujah why because we
[7:30] were in
[7:32] him Hallelujah the prophet of God said
[7:35] you can live so close to God God will
[7:38] take you
[7:40] places I like that I like that I like
[7:43] that that we can live so close to God
[7:46] that God would take us places hallelujah
[7:49] amen you say what brother I don't know
[7:51] about that but Paul live so close to God
[7:55] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:2 I don't
[7:58] know Man in Christ above 14 years ago he
[8:02] said I was caught up he said I was
[8:04] caught up into the third heaven
[8:07] Hallelujah I heard things that wasn't
[8:09] even lawful amen for a man to
[8:13] hutter Hallelujah he was the alpha But
[8:16] Here Come the Omega Hallelujah he said
[8:19] one day I was laying on my bed
[8:22] Hallelujah and I was thinking Hallelujah
[8:24] I don't have much time
[8:27] left come on somebody he said all of a
[8:30] sudden he said all of a sudden he said I
[8:33] looked around and here was my body lay
[8:36] on the bay what was it he lived so close
[8:39] to God God took him places Hallelujah
[8:43] took him beyond the curtain of time and
[8:46] he said I saw
[8:47] millions millions coming toward me as I
[8:52] said if you don't know you one of those
[8:54] Millions something's wrong with your
[8:56] experience if you can your faith cannot

[9:01] your experience I believe with all of my
[9:04] heart I'm one in a milon you must
[9:07] believe that you're one in the and

[22:59] everything they could to him and he
[23:00] wouldn't open his mouth
[23:03] Hallelujah come on somebody it wasn't
[23:05] strangers that was doing these things it
[23:08] was people from his own household the
[23:10] Bible said he came to his own and his
[23:12] own received him not amen but he came to
[23:15] those who would not those who did not
[23:17] those who knew not amen but for those
[23:20] who would he gave them power to become
[23:23] the sons of God think about it you
[23:26] better thank God
[23:28] these Wild Olive branches we used to be
[23:31] Hallelujah God done grafted us into the
[23:33] real
[23:36] Vine he said if you abide divide and
[23:38] abide and you and I abide and you is
[23:40] that right he said you'll bring forth by
[23:42] the grace of God now listen you think
[23:45] about this here it was God comes along
[23:48] and and he's working with Abraham
[23:50] according to Genesis the 17th chapter
[23:53] and I'm not going to go through the
[23:54] whole story but you know how it was
[23:55] Abraham was called by God Amen and here
[23:58] was Abraham amen just like we were and
[24:00] like we we are amen among uh a gentile
[24:04] people amen that all they were were
[24:06] idolators and and and you know what they
[24:08] were like they you can tell by the way
[24:09] it is now amen but God called Abraham
[24:12] now how did Abraham know that was God
[24:15] with all those Gods amen how did Abraham
[24:18] know God was God how do you know Jesus
[24:21] Christ is
[24:24] godall hallelujah come on somebody there
[24:27] have been people hearing that name for
[24:29] thousands of years and they still don't
[24:31] know he's God come on somebody you
[24:34] better thank God for election Hallelujah
[24:37] the only way you can hear God's voice is
[24:39] because you was elected Hallelujah
[24:41] predestinated before the foundation of
[24:44] the world and Jesus said my sheep
[24:47] heareth my voice and a stranger they
[24:49] will not follow that is the only way you
[24:51] know that's the only reason you know
[24:53] that Jesus Christ is
[24:55] God there's a lot of things to thank God
[24:58] for oh somebody you better thank I tell
[25:03] you what people say well I got the Holy
[25:04] Ghost you know what I thank God for most
[25:06] of all
[25:07] election is that right brother Bram said
[25:10] election is greater than the holy ghost
[25:12] or having the Holy Ghost you understand
[25:14] there's a lot of people that got the
[25:16] Holy Ghost but they not they're not
[25:17] elected Hallelujah to be the Bride of
[25:20] Jesus Christ glory to God and I'm so
[25:22] thankful Hallelujah that God not only
[25:25] elected me chose me Hallelujah to
[25:28] receive the Holy Ghost for my day
[25:30] Hallelujah but he called me amen and
[25:33] chose me Amen to do what be translated
[25:39] Hallelujah glory to God
[25:45] translated translate it think about
[25:49] it this old model will put on
[25:51] immortality why because of
[25:54] Calvary hallelujah it's homegoing time
[25:56] we couldn't even return return home
[25:58] until he did that Hallelujah somebody
[26:01] had to die for us hallelujah and pay our
[26:04] debt in order for us to return home we
[26:07] would have been stuck Hallelujah but
[26:09] somebody paid the ticket Hallelujah
[26:12] somebody made the way for us to
[26:15] return wo Jesus have mercy have mercy
[26:19] you see that's how God is with us he's
[26:21] good to us he's better to us than we to
[26:24] ourselves Hallelujah think about it and
[26:28] here he comes to Abraham and all of us
[26:30] we we we've passed through this phase I
[26:32] hope amen when he told Abraham said you
[26:34] know I'm going to bring forth a child
[26:35] out of your loins amen I love this I
[26:38] love this amen and we find out that

[26:58] the only way we can be inherit Christ we
[27:00] had to come out of his bows come on
[27:03] somebody Abraham was a type of the
[27:05] father hallelujah amen Isaac was a son
[27:08] Hallelujah and Isaac had to come out of
[27:10] the loin he had to come out of the bows
[27:12] like the Propet of God say we are
[27:14] rotation off of him oh my God we're not

[27:20] something God picked off the Sha but he
[27:22] said we are rotation off of
[27:26] God you you can't get it no better than
[27:29] that Hallelujah and then God comes along

[27:34] him out of your bows you know how Sarah

[33:55] why they were dead in the man in that
[33:57] manner Abraham is good as uh dead
[34:00] Sarah's womb is good as dead but what
[34:03] happened what taking place she said how
[34:05] could I being as old as I am and my Lord

[34:24] did she think within herself in her
[34:27] heart why did she say this now watch
[34:30] that excuse me excuse me that that was
[34:33] was the last sign before something
[34:35] happened to Sarah and
[34:37] Abraham now I preached here one time and
[34:40] told you that God turned them back to a
[34:42] young man and woman to prove it she went
[34:45] down they took a little trip went down
[34:47] to G geria and AMC that Philistine King
[34:51] fell in love with Sarah and wanted to
[34:53] marry her come on somebody amen amen
[34:57] amen and of course she was a young woman
[34:59] again beautiful and notice he had to do
[35:03] something he had to change her he didn't
[35:06] just put her back to a young man and
[35:08] woman see that's what we must understand
[35:10] God is not coming just to turn you back
[35:13] young but he must change you from the
[35:15] inside out Hallelujah the change must
[35:19] come from the inside out first
[35:22] Hallelujah before the outside change is
[35:24] that right but that's what he's doing
[35:27] in the secret chambers of God he's
[35:30] turning that bride Inside Out changing
[35:33] her amen that's why that's why I always
[35:36] tell you the secret of the Rapture is in
[35:40] prayer Hallelujah the secret of the
[35:43] Rapture is in prayer you don't pray you
[35:46] won't
[35:47] stay Hallelujah and you must understand
[35:50] by the grace of God Amen that if you
[35:53] stay in that prayer closet Hallelujah
[35:55] God will tell you things
[35:57] Hallelujah that he won't even give it to
[35:59] the preacher if he ain't
[36:05] praying Hallelujah come on somebody she
[36:09] going to know things that a lot of
[36:10] people won't know and he's going to tell
[36:12] her things that don't tell nobody else
[36:15] yeah somebody come on come on come on
[36:19] Amen is that all
[36:22] right is the secret of it amen is that
[36:26] right because of of they they brother
[36:28] ROM said that when the foolish version
[36:30] came amen for all what did the wise tell
[36:32] them you go pray up you go pray up and I
[36:37] I that always hold to me amen that's why
[36:39] the devil fight you so hard in prayer
[36:41] didn't God say that if you pray with him
[36:44] in secret he reward you openly hello
[36:48] somebody Oh Glory to God
[36:53] my is that right he caught them right he
[36:56] changed CH them excuse
[36:58] me right but he had to change their
[37:00] whole system and turn them back young
[37:04] and change them to receive the sign the
[37:08] same thing he's going to do next after
[37:10] that and remember after the sign was
[37:12] manifested fully to Abraham and his
[37:16] group let me ask you the question have
[37:18] the sign been fully
[37:23] manifested right cuz you got to remember
[37:25] I said this last last week or whenever I
[37:27] was here last I said here it was amen
[37:30] Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my
[37:32] blood the prophet of God said that was a
[37:34] time for for teaching them hallelujah
[37:38] amen many we in this message amen we've
[37:42] had the devil attacked us by false
[37:44] doctrines everywhere Hallelujah but when
[37:47] he saw that wasn't going to work he
[37:49] attacked the B blooded bleeding word
[37:53] hallelujah he comes around and he
[37:55] attacks that
[37:57] and then you know that's why in the 70
[37:59] left I I got to say this what is taking
[38:02] place right now among what we call the
[38:05] message it's been for the Bride of Jesus
[38:08] Christ alone because it anchors her it
[38:12] anchors her because Jesus turns to Peter
[38:16] and said are you going to leave
[38:18] too she said where can I go I can't go
[38:22] to Ben
[38:23] hen excuse me I can't go
[38:27] I can't go nowhere else you're the only
[38:30] one that has the words to eternal
[38:33] life do you really I want you to think
[38:35] about what that did to him what that
[38:39] confession
[38:40] was it anchored him even though amen he
[38:45] denied him he knew within himself that
[38:48] he was the only one that had the wor to
[38:51] eternal
[38:53] life and though the 70 left it
[38:57] separated the wheat from the chaff come
[39:00] on somebody amen it brought us into a
[39:03] place now you know you're wheat cuz you
[39:05] can't go
[39:06] nowhere you can't go nowhere there is no
[39:09] other message outside of
[39:13] this and that same group he took Amen to
[39:18] the upper
[39:19] room right one tried to make it but he
[39:23] couldn't because he didn't believe in
[39:24] the Holy Ghost
[39:28] hey somebody come on somebody he did he
[39:31] said Judas couldn't go to
[39:34] Pentecost I'm almost
[39:37] done St John 14
[39:42] please you love the
[39:52] Lord I had I've had so many friends I
[39:55] have to say this again turn around on me
[39:57] you know not on me on God oh they don't
[40:00] believe this they don't believe that but
[40:02] I let them know y'all didn't show me
[40:03] this in the
[40:06] beginning God showed me
[40:09] this and my question is if this is wrong
[40:12] then how come the world is the way it is
[40:15] and the world prophesied God prophesied
[40:17] of it thousands of years before this
[40:20] happened can't be a
[40:24] coincidence the world is the way it is
[40:27] because the word said it would be
[40:32] so you are who you are because the word
[40:35] said it would be so oh somebody ought to
[40:38] be happy
[40:40] tonight St John 1410 I'm so glad to be
[40:43] sitting in the Heavenly places in Christ
[40:45] Jesus think about it look at all these
[40:47] Stones every one of us are cut
[40:49] differently Hallelujah but right now

[41:28] thou not that I am in the father and the
[41:31] father in me the words that I speak unto

[41:38] that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[41:41] believe me that I am in the Father the
[41:44] father and the father in me or else
[41:46] believe me for the very work sake that
[41:49] is where God is trying to bring us in up
[41:53] into our lives now the Bible according
[41:56] to John said if you don't believe that
[42:00] Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh you
[42:02] are
[42:04] Antichrist not talking about Jesus 2,000
[42:07] years ago he talking about Jesus now
[42:10] Jesus Christ has come into your flesh
[42:14] and if Jesus Christ has come into your
[42:16] flesh then who living who's living who's
[42:20] living who's living
[42:22] Hallelujah that's why Paul said it's not
[42:25] I that live but Christ that lives in
[42:32] me yet in a little while and the world
[42:35] seeth me no more but ye shall see me
[42:38] because I live ye shall live
[42:41] also in other words I'm Your Life Source
[42:44] that's the only reason why you living is
[42:46] that all right amen amen listen it
[42:50] closing because I can't finish it all we
[42:52] got communion but I want to say this by
[42:54] the grace of God Jesus Christ had no
[42:57] place to be born and he had no place to
[42:59] die and no place to be buried everything
[43:03] was
[43:07] borrow a borrowed cave a borrowed tomb
[43:11] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying he
[43:12] had no house everything was borrowed
[43:15] amen so don't feel so bad if you got a
[43:17] little
[43:18] something amen he didn't have nothing is
[43:21] that right he had nothing amen but one
[43:25] thing he had in mind
[43:26] which was above all things Eden meant
[43:30] nothing to him without his
[43:34] wife the whole purpose remember the
[43:36] prophet God said he said there was only
[43:38] one thing that Jesus Christ asked the
[43:40] father and that was father I would that
[43:43] they be with
[43:49] me that now that's like David said
[43:51] that's honey in the
[43:52] cone I can taste that word right now
[43:55] amen because that's all it is he nothing
[43:58] else matter he died for you and me right
[44:02] like Adam he died for ye nothing nothing
[44:05] else matter how beautiful it was how the
[44:07] sun set the sun rise none of that
[44:09] mattered to him his Fallen bride was
[44:11] what he wanted his Fallen bride is what
[44:14] he got Hallelujah so is it with Jesus
[44:17] Christ Heaven Earth nothing matters to
[44:20] him his Fallen bride was what he wanted
[44:23] his Fallen bride is what he's got and
[44:26] you better believe this nothing can take
[44:29] you away from him Paul said what shall
[44:31] separate not e I'm sorry he said who
[44:33] shall separate me from the love of God
[44:36] who who who nothing
[44:39] [Music]
[44:42] can nothing nothing the devil mad cuz he
[44:46] can't stop this
[44:48] thing he's so upset he can't stop it no
[44:52] matter he done Tred to boil it out of
[44:53] burn it out of cut it out of Amen man
[44:56] but one of these old days he'll come
[44:57] after us and like you said we be caught
[45:00] up caught up people and I believe we're
[45:03] not too far from that right
[45:06] now when you see the things changing the
[45:08] way they changing so
[45:10] rapidly my my my my here you are
[45:14] thinking oh God ain't nothing happening
[45:16] in me like I said and I say it
[45:20] again can anybody see a tree growing
[45:23] anybody knows that can you you ever seen
[45:24] a tree grow
[45:26] you can look right at it and it's
[45:29] growing and you can't even see
[45:32] it they have to put it under the speed
[45:34] cameras for you to really see the thing
[45:37] growing but it's growing you're looking
[45:38] right at it you can't even see it grow
[45:42] come on somebody we look at ourselves
[45:44] every day can't see see ourselves
[45:45] growing we either growing up or
[45:48] out that's the truth and you don't even
[45:51] see it but it's
[45:53] happening just like the Inner Man he's
[45:57] growing he's growing people he's growing
[46:00] Hallelujah and one of these old days
[46:03] he's going to show up amen and you're
[46:05] going to see all this time all that
[46:08] suffering all that pain all that that
[46:10] trials I had to go through and all it
[46:12] was was Jesus forming himself in
[46:17] you forming himself in you all the time
[46:22] after a while you start talking like him
[46:24] walking like him looking like him acting
[46:26] like him now I'm going to bring it down
[46:27] to another scenario and I'm going to
[46:29] close like I said last week many times
[46:33] we don't we we we we we born of our
[46:35] mothers and our fathers as little
[46:37] children people say oh you look just
[46:38] like your daddy well you don't see
[46:43] that or your mama say well I sure hope
[46:45] you don't be like your no good
[46:50] daddy y'all know what I'm talking about
[46:54] I'm just being hon this been y'all know
[46:58] I done heard that
[47:00] before and you say well I'm not going to
[47:03] be like him but what you don't
[47:05] understand is that you are born of
[47:09] him without the Holy Ghost you're going
[47:11] to Bear His Image whether you like it or
[47:15] not right amen I look in the mirror
[47:18] sometime I throw my hat on just like my
[47:20] daddy the other day I found myself
[47:22] walking like it was some way I was doing
[47:24] I could see my daddy
[47:26] you hear what I'm saying I didn't have
[47:28] to practice
[47:30] it yeah I didn't have to go into
[47:32] meditation no I didn't have to do none
[47:34] of that it was in the
[47:37] DNA my point is as I matured I couldn't
[47:42] see it but when I became a man it became
[47:46] visible Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[47:49] saying if Christ be in you as you grow
[47:52] you may not be able to see it but when
[47:54] you become a man it becomes visible you
[47:57] act like him you walk like him you talk
[48:00] like him Hallelujah and you don't have a
[48:06] choice oh I love this I love this I love
[48:09] this let's
[48:14] stand but in the naturally sad because
[48:18] the part of your daddy you don't want is
[48:20] the part that you normally
[48:24] get Hallelujah is that all right oh it's
[48:28] true folks it's
[48:31] true oh it's true and I I I tell you
[48:34] what I always I would tell my children I
[48:36] said listen I said you you can't drink
[48:39] you know you you can't drink your system
[48:41] is weak to drinking I said my daddy was
[48:43] an alcoholic and we had a lot of
[48:45] Alcoholics in our in the line y'all hear
[48:48] what I'm saying so that bloodline that
[48:50] that that that strength is we don't have
[48:52] a strength there so you we can't drink
[48:55] because if you do you'll find yourself
[48:57] an alcoholic before you know it right so
[49:01] I had out of all my children I had one
[49:03] boy that fell to that disease and God
[49:05] delivered him you know but one thing he
[49:08] came to me and he said but daddy you
[49:10] told me I said yeah I tried to tell you
[49:13] you know you cannot drink you know what
[49:16] I'm saying come
[49:18] on it's like high blood pressure and all
[49:21] that other stuff it's of hereditary that
[49:23] means you got to be careful on how you
[49:24] eat
[49:27] other people can eat whatever they want
[49:28] to but you can't just eat what you want
[49:30] to because it's you see what brother I'm
[49:34] saved that's all right you have to
[49:36] battle that demon y'all hear what I'm
[49:39] saying you have to battle that demon you
[49:41] can get rid of him you think he ain't
[49:42] going to stay he gonna come back you
[49:44] have to battle that demon till Jesus
[49:46] come that don't mean you don't get
[49:49] Victory but he's going to come back cuz
[49:51] he knows what's in your
[49:54] line y'all say well you what you can't
[49:57] be sin I know what I'm talking about
[49:58] because I had to be delivered from that
[50:00] demon but I thought because I was
[50:02] delivered I could eat all the fried
[50:03] chicken I wanted to I know you
[50:07] can't it'll come back on you because
[50:09] there's a weakness in your
[50:13] Gene your body ain't redeemed
[50:16] yet it's still backsliding y'all know
[50:19] what I'm saying you love God come
[50:22] brother as we prepare
[50:24] ourselves
[50:26] we going to go into our communion
[50:28] service and we want to say everybody

[50:33] God oh my I I just feel so good how many

[50:43] place and you see uh your failure you
[50:46] see fail all the time somewhere you got
[50:49] to come to Reon something and that's God
