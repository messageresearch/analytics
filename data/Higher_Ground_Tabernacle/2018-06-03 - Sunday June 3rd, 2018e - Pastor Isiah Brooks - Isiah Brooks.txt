effort and all that he's doing to bless the bride of Jesus Christ as we stand we're going to come from revelations the fifth chapter revelations 5 we're gonna come from the 1st through the 5th verse then we'll go to Isaiah 54 love the Lord and appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and oh that he's doing for us we are in a battle and we're still working with that the life of a warrior we understand by God's grace that uh what we're doing here is whether you realize it or not we we're making history even though it's the end of it our story will be told in heaven brother vellum said they asked a question what age did you come out of and this is later CE o come sit down talk to me about it here but you know we we are who we are and I'm so glad but we suffer we have heartaches with pains we go through it all but the Bible says that what God has in store for us the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the things in which God has in store for us and I am so glad to be one of them revelations 5 beginning at the first verse and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went months because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals there are Isaiah 54 as we said we are warriors let's go to Isaiah 53 let's start reading at the fifth verse there often time we fail to see who we really are for thine maker is thine husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and the Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the Lord have called thee as a woman forsaken grieved in the spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused said by God for a small moment ever forsake indeed but with great mercies will I gather thee just a small moment but with God that with us that might seem like a long time but with God is just a small moment as here 54 in 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper in every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness of is of me saith the Lord let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your mercies and Lord Jesus what can we say we are nothing without you Lord you are the Creator you are all in all we pray father God that you would bless the service continually in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I was concerned because the young people from my own City was supposed to come I don't know what may have taken place I just trusted everything is okay I was under the impression they were going to follow or come afterwards shortly after we left there and an expectation to see them when I arrived because we had to drop my wife off grace my daughter Grace had to be taken to Urgent Care so let's pray that God's perfect will be done in her life and for those of you who may not know grace did come to me about a week ago if that long and confessed and made things right with me and for what I understand she is in the process of making all things right so let's continue to pray for her and so this thing that we were about the church and patient from under the blood she has brought forth a confession and we're definitely looking for the fruits of her repentance so God knows how to deal with every individual and we just think God for His grace I I know Shekinah and was here this morning as I was told but because of the baby's foot and all that I may know that that the baby burned her foot and it's uh Anna I think got a two second degree burn so pray that God give her a speedy recovery amen we are warrior somebody I believe that fighters I like that word fighters I was telling the church this morning my daddy is a was a fighter he loved to fight every weekend and one thing he would do before he could fight he would make sure he had his uh stimulation and he drink and get stimulated and you know it's so amazing that even in the natural world they know how to stimulate you you either stimulated by words or you stimulated by substance but either way they know how to get you geared up into fighting you know it's so amazing that's one thing I do like about the Chihuahua dog it doesn't matter how small he is you challenge anything it's because they said it's not how how big the dog is or how big the fight how big the dog is with how big the fight is in the dog and you and I know by God's grace that God chose you would elected you for the worst age of all ages this age is what we call Satan's Eden and brother Adam said don't take Satan lightly you know a lot of times people take him lightly but he's a warrior and this man has fought a man before we were even manifest in this Ram he knows about fighting he knows how to divide he knows how to conquer because the Bible says that he comes to steal kill and destroy and you and I I wanna I want to liken this service to 7co warriors because you got to realize that Jesus Christ is the captain of the laws hosts and we understand what revelation 10 was talking about that mighty angel that put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and he conquered by God's grace amen showing possession of heaven and earth so we realize a man that you and I must understand that the only way that we can truly fight the battle we can't fight like David said to Saul your garment your armor is no good to me and we can't fight with denomination or our garments or or some type of weapon tree of that Satan has given to us but we must fight with the weapon tree of call of God and that weapon tree is faith because Jesus told us that if you can say you can say if you have the faith you can say to this mountain be thou move in that mountain must be must obey he said we have their ability to by word amen to curse a tree he said if you say to anything and believing it amen it shall be done Amen it's a two coal in here for y'all to say amen amen so by God's grace amen I trust amen that you and I can understand and you know it's it's body language means a lot right body language is something else it tells me things amen so you realized by God's grace that you and I must understand and that's what brother Branham said brother man said you know the man say oh you say too much you don't say there's too much noise brother branham right brother bam said I would be worried if there wasn't any and that's what causes me to worry when I can preach and nobody can say Amen right or a few people say Amen hallelujah and I'm gonna read a quote in just a moment so you can see that you're a man's are important now we look at these things and we see by God's grace that brother Branham in the message make the valley full of rich ditches so that y'all understand I do quote brother Branham sometimes amen but you know I called him all the time because I have a revelation of what he says amen so we look at this thing and he tells us that Jerusalem at the time of the Jews he said King John has a Fant was the king of Judah which they had a split and y'all heard me Minister this I believe he said like the churches as long as you have these split ups in the church will never unite the Indians lost the United States to the white people because they were unorganized themselves split up they were having tribal fights if they have put themselves together they could have held held their ground if any people I feel sorry for is the Indians he's a real American we are not we are immigrants he's American that God made America you understand me you say well what do you say I'm saying this God had made Israel on our me Amen and they they were twelve tribes I love this because God had 12 disciples and each one of them came from different tribes and God taught them one thing you are of one bread you you are of one body oh come on somebody and we find out that as long as Israel were fighting themselves the enemy had leave way into conquering Israel why because the Bible said a house divided cannot stand hallelujah and as long as this little Fellowship continues to have their little pieces and their separation and their little cliques whatever may you may want to call it when we are like that there is no way we're gonna see a move of God only when we are united God took those 12 disciples set them up he meant into the upper room and wouldn't let him go out until they were on one accord with one mind hallelujah and when they were on one accord with one mind the Holy Ghost came it is a saying because we realized by God's grace what we call the message we are so divided and we expect a move of God hallelujah but I believe by God's grace if this little fellowship can come on a card we cannot be an example hallelujah we'll be like a David hallelujah don't we have a cause for this thing is there not a cause hallelujah when you see a Goliath boasting itself against the army of God hallelujah when you see cancer boasting yourself against the army of God when you see diabetes Boston against the army of God hallelujah high blood pressure whatever you want to call it don't we have a call when brother Branham was on the scene that devil didn't both been hallelujah he tried to hide he tried to unite hallelujah but there was a real warrior on the scene seven seer warrior hallelujah is that all right because we didn't come to God amen with with the one I left hand we didn't come to excuse me we didn't come to fight the devil with the left hand we didn't come to fight the devil with just the right hand we came to fighting with both hands hallelujah why because when God God tells us that they were skillful men in the Old Testament that knew how the how how the world the weapon tree with left both in right hand hallelujah is that right Samson Amen though he was blind he was able to work the left hand in the right hand hallelujah to defeat his enemy and I believe with all of our heart this is where we are in these last days some of us we don't understand it but the message churches we have no idea we have no business having a dead service Holly area even if you're gonna sing hymns you got to put your heart in it that right why are you putting your heart in it so that God can come on the scene you don't please God with that unless God comes down and vindicated no matter what song you sing you want God to come in and vindicate the song I'm talking to all of us now we sing every song like we singing nearer my God to D ha ha I'm already near him I'm not just meeting him I'm in him hallelujah listen what the Prophet says in the Ephesian Church h-he unless anything dies in rots like can't come life can't come from it unless a man dies and rot in his own thoughts Christ can't get into his heart hallelujah I don't care how you sit up here and I'm telling you I preach the same way amen everywhere I go my point is it is a time it is time to stop whatever we're doing and die and rot whatever it is I don't care whatever it is if it takes you a whole night and day to die and rot to yourself you need to do it Oh help us jesusí we're not going anywhere it ain't gonna rap beat no no rapture for you if you're not dead and rotted if the light of God is not quickening you you're not going anywhere like I was saying this morning you can't go nowhere and that's cause you have come into a statue of a perfect man it doesn't mean you're not as Christian you say but you need to come to full maturity hallelujah thank you Lisa I was wondering you had me wondering you know we look at this thing and you said Lord Jesus what are we doing what is going on here you know you know I thank the Lord you know I hope yeah I won't say it I just maybe you know it's amazing what God is doing you know our our precious uh brother didn't come this morning or or they afternoon because he had another appointment Jared but he made me know that he could have just not showed up but you know I thank God for the work that he's doing in his life and in his young girl's life and you know God is so good to us you know I was able to pass out a few church age books and everything and I feel pretty good I've been asking God for these moments these doors open to me you know and God is opening these doors so let's move on that's why nobody can't tell me God's not moving he's moving God is doing something and like I said until the atmosphere in this place come to a place where Jesus can step into it he ain't he won't hallelujah he's in me now and I trust he's in you but God also want to be in the church service hallelujah you know what this is one thing I know I went when I when when the anointing was still yet somewhat with the Apostolic and Pentecostal churches they could care less about how you sing they get that tamarine it sounds like noise to the unbeliever but one thing I saw this lady get up and she couldn't couldn't carry in a bucket and that whole church was on fire hallelujah no I'm not preaching on no one I'm preaching on everyone everybody I'm talking about everybody right now and I don't know why I just said it like this people of God you say well music and song is not important it is it cast out devils hallelujah but we gotta we gotta put it in a way that the devil know we know what we're talking about you can't you got to sing like you know what you're talking about when you say onward Christian soldiers marching as to war what do you see somebody else marching I see myself I am alone what Christian soldier marching as to war with what the cost of Jesus going on before hallelujah is that Alright now I say this he said you got to die and right there to your thoughts let's the Holy Ghost take over and just do what he wants to do with you get kind of messy it's already is always is okay to cry it's all it's okay to you cry so let you go you snot it's okay your eyes are getting red and swollen and puffy it's okay I think about those babies when they're born and when they're born a man then here's all crooked and all kinds of stuff sometimes they come out that face is all swollen up from the pressure they don't they don't come out really cute and pretty hallelujah they come out like they've been in a battle hallelujah and you and I was understanding that we are in a battle hallelujah the life of a warrior is hard it ain't always sunshine even why the battle is going on sometimes you got to fight in the rain he had a fight in the straw sometimes he mender the bullets and the mule flying all over your head but you got a mission you can't stay in the dig the dugout you got to come up out of that ditch and run and do what you necessary for you to do right now we are in a battle and the battle that is a raid and we're not fighting amen and understand what's happening now the same thing that the devil did to Israel he has done to this message met the road with the message the message is perfect nothing was wrong with the orders of God when it came to Israel it was perfect but you had me and who would raise up a man and bring division among the people people men preachers who would go off the Word of God just trying to build their own Kingdom and had not God intervene he would not have had a witness hallelujah but he was God who intervened and had a witness for himself because the Bible said he never left himself without a witness hallelujah I don't know about you but I didn't come for formal fashion I didn't come to be a hero I didn't come Amen to glorify myself there's only one thing I come to do and that is to glorify God hallelujah I want people to know where I came from I didn't come from hell I came from glory hallelujah where everything is free power of God is what I live with it's what I live for hallelujah and when you've seen the dead raised eyes are the blood open chicken pox healed like that cancer heal like that when you see those things how can you I think about the people who used to be with brother Branham hallelujah who testified and had that that powerful anointing with them how can they stand what they see right now and I will not settle from sup for a church that's going to lay down and let the devil beat them up hallelujah we've got to fight back you see when you preach truth people get mad with you but let me tell you something people of God even every Creed every dogma every tradition must die hallelujah is that right Paul died Paul had to die hallelujah remember in Corinthians he was trying to prove himself to all of those who make believers he said let me tell you something he said I'm speaking foolishly but but but pardon me in my speech he said the Pharisees I'm a Pharisee I'm above dad I'm really a you know I'm number one basically what he's saying right he said when it comes to when it comes up Bera bread he said listen I am I have a lineage a thoroughbreds hallelujah huh come on somebody a man he said listen when it comes to teachings and all of that I was told on the Camellia I got all the natural conditions hallelujah but that's not what makes me he said all that I learned all that I knew hold it up cause I knew I counted dung hallelujah y'all know what that is that's Melora I call it that's what it is to me I must take this what I thought ahead and pass it through my bow hallelujah huh Oh help me Jesus he said that's all it means to me he said and I'm gonna tell you something I'll died whatever is necessary because all I want to know is Jesus Christ him crucified and the power of his resurrection hallelujah I just don't want to die to myself but I want to rise again hallelujah I want to rise again and when I rise hallelujah I want to rise in his power rise in his strength hallelujah that's what Paul was saying Alleluia oh thank you Jesus it out all right hallelujah so you and I must understand we are in a battle the battle is a ray but the Bible of God the Word of God says no weapon form against you get all the encourage hallelujah I don't care what kind of weapon the devil would produce and try to take you out with he cannot hallelujah like that song we saying brother leaves he stands in my defense hallelujah somebody help me when the devil say I'm no good God said hold up he is to me when the devil said you see how many mistakes he he makes the Lord said hold up he's perfect in my eyes he gets better than that when the devil says see I'm gonna send you to hell that God says not so hallelujah he's mine Jesus already in the Lamb's Book of Life right brother hallelujah and that's what I'm talkin about listen like I want to say it this way you can't get this new wine in old bottles hallelujah if your bottle have not been changed you nobody's going to do make you mess up hallelujah when you try to put this holiness in your own spirit it's gonna not only put you in bondage but it's gonna also make you mess up hallelujah is that right see when the rain falls it doesn't change the seed it only makes the see growth hallelujah and if that seed that have not been dead and rotted out in you that old damned of a seed that we've been born with if that doesn't die in Rock hallelujah guess what when that unknown thing come you think oh praise God I'm gonna leave out here and I'm gonna be more sanctified and holy no you won't because that's that see still there and all it's going to do is produce more evil that's why you got to make the tree good or evil you can't have it both good and evil hallelujah and that old devil nature must die and rot hallelujah and with that water come you know it is gonna bring forth good fruit it's gonna bring for my husband 460 434 but it will be fruitful Peter said as long as this as you grow from faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brother carne he said all the way up to the perfect love Peter said listen this God will bring you into a perfect state of being where you'll never fall neither will you be unfruitful that's your Bible help me Lord Jesus you and I in a battle the devil don't want you to know Amen that God got you covered is that right like eagles wings hallelujah he's got you covered like eagles weed and we do not have to defray dove the devil the worst thing you can ever do is to think that the demon that you got can send you to hell when you are elected and you know what the devil put he put fear in you then if you you see this thing is gonna send you to healing and you ain't overcoming yet you go in the head hallelujah the devil is a liar hallelujah what you're saying brother Brooks don't you know when God called Abraham God said i justified him and that justification means as though you've never said in the first place hallelujah oh lord have mercy he gave Abraham an unconditional covenant can you imagine Abraham trying to fight a battle Amen with holes and rakes and the whole time he's think about all of the mistakes he's made hallelujah but this Holy Ghost come to cleanse you from all your guilt consciousness hallelujah and he's coming in to put Christ in you so you can have his mind do you believe it the Bible said he became our sin that we might become his righteous man put all the whole I'm a god the Bible said that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil hallelujah you don't listen to the devil's gospel you listen to God's gospel nah you listen to God's gospel don't listen what the devil you didn't help yourself you couldn't make you who you are you didn't you didn't choose what family you want to be in you never chose amen all the good things and all the bad things you wanted to happen to you they happen anyway hallelujah but let me tell you what your defense is that seed hallelujah God knew what he put in you that one overcomer of this age hallelujah say they wanted to imprison you he wanted to keep you in his well hallelujah but God is a God of transformation he's the one that transforms us into his kingdom by his power and by his light hallelujah see the Seventh Seal came down with power hallelujah even like I you've heard me say this before but i'ma say it again even before brother Branham fully understood what was happening hallelujah he saw him through the Holy Spirit while he was out there hunting with those brother the Holy Spirit take up that rock and throw it up in the air he told those brothers huh he said you better take cover Oh some of them healed under the cars and everything all of a sudden that whirlwind came down like that and began the blasting Rock bow hallelujah thundering Amen how to have them blasting those rocks and look pyramid rocks where everywhere hallelujah don't you know what he was saying the seals will be open and the very stone that I was made of is your stone hallelujah hallelujah and I'm bolder than bone and flesh of his flesh I'm from the same loaf brother there's only one brain of those stones until somebody borrowed it and never returned it but I was there and I went there and I saw right now you can't get back there because they got it closed off and all when I was there right there right up in that same area the profile of brother Branham is in the mountain y'all seen that profile I've seen it in reality I've been there not only that Amen that what you call this the longitude of the latitude latitude yes not attitude but latitude anything holiday and the same latitude of Jerusalem is the same latitude with the mountains with blasters the rocks will blast it out time that's why he called it Jerusalem and Jericho hallelujah Oh a sister came to me and she showed me gaga and she showed me the mountain where the rocks were they looked almost identical which one is it I couldn't tell hallelujah y'all hit me said God is the Alpha and Omega he's the beginning in the end he's the first in the land that's why I believe Amen it's just a matter of moments now Amen that this thing is going to be all over ha because he shut that off for years trees wouldn't even grow back but once a few years ago now those trees will go growing back amen that was cut off and now they're blocking the very image veiling it all over again hallelujah God gave me the grace to go down into his his cane hallelujah you can't go there anymore either hallelujah and you know they thought because of the demolition they were gonna get rid of it but God just held it in place just for me oh I waited tonight I first scared cuz I had to go down on her down amen into that cave you know I'm like I'm a big guy do you know who say I had to go down into that cave and when I got down into that cave brothers oh my god I saw that pyramid hanging hallelujah down from the ceiling I saw the profile of the prophet of God I saw Elijah's table and chair hallelujah I had a big oh my god I have a glorious time Wow out of all the people in this United States he allowed me to see it hallelujah I came out of season but I'm in season now hallelujah and what we come to do we've come amen to take the kingdom of saw away from him and make this Kingdom Davis Kingdom that's why the scriptures say come out of her my people and be not partakers of mercy and why we have a job to do it must let these people know hallelujah that well they are they're not worshiping so they under Souls ministry oh you got to come out if you're going to be going crown David King you got to be a part of David's Kingdom hallelujah and who is David David represents Christ himself hallelujah and I'ma tell you something what David messed up in I love this part but God loved David so much he called himself the son of David hallelujah and we know who the son of David is that Solomon and if you thoughts David messed up what about Solomon hallelujah but when you have an unconditional covenant hallelujah hey you see let me tell you something I preached this morning God saved the best wine for last hallelujah believe that I believe it brother man preach what Paul preached hallelujah but in that day they could not understand what Paul was preaching well because time made a difference hallelujah don't you know people he told people becoming this and becoming that in this man that he didn't see all of that hallelujah like brother bran was preaching against women wearing pants and all that in his day everybody looked like Christians hallelujah women was still wearing dresses still long hair and all that hallelujah in his day but he wasn't looking at his day he was looking at our day now we're looking at men what but Paul says hallelujah but we'll look at with better glasses Oh Revelator glasses we can now focus the vision hallelujah hallelujah you better focus your vision you might see three three three something coming at you an attainable one hallelujah we're blessed we are totally blessed hallelujah like I said he seed that wine and I don't know about you brother I got the right you know what hold on that that's why the day on the day of Pentecost I said it was new why hallelujah is that right when Jesus was at the marriage he presented to them new why that's why I was so much better than the first and the wine that we're drinking now is new wine is better than the first hallelujah why because he saved the best for last when the devil said you ain't no good he's a liar God hand-picked you hallelujah he the next he denies Gabriel or any of the other decide are angels up there who should I choose God chose you and he knows what you got hallelujah right now I look like you looking like some of us might be looking like Samson hallelujah but Samson's may have looked defeated but he was not defeated hallelujah in the darkest hour of Sansom hate him and he had one more request Oh Lord once hallelujah even your prophecy Oh Lord I just wish I could just live to see that day what do you think that brother Brandon was looking at he wasn't looking at a defeated Church he was looking at what Paul said a church that was more than conquerors he was seeing the very image of God amen now impacting people he was literally looking at the end of this drama is that okay you know we can look at Joshua and say Oh Joshua was a powerful warrior but you are too you got more than Joshua Joshua had Godwinson you got God in you hallelujah amen and you and I must understand that's not there's not a Jericho that cannot be torn down hallelujah you and I we as a bride of Jesus Christ God no we have no business hanging out here a man like we defeated in God don't miss something or something God's Word is perfect hallelujah and every promise that God has promised a men will come to pass you say what about me brother Brooks what about me I've been waiting on God for a long time have you ever been have you been waiting 120 years yeah don't complain until then no priest 120 years can you believe that and no no members nobody come in no he made it started out with a big big membership but he kept preaching the same message hallelujah you know people get tired of the same message hallelujah I don't get tired of it I listen to this message every day hallelujah I might miss a couple of days but it ain't ain't not no it is not a routine I try to listen to the prophets message every day all day every time I get in my car whatever the case may be where I'm going to buy a user headset I'm there uh I won't that mine you gotta have that mine that mine is mine oh yeah you said what brother look I don't know about this let me say it like this right now you stay in that word you stay with that message you constantly listen to it you've got to it's a must the Bible said eat the whole book hallelujah you might not see a miracle you might not see some great happen right at the moment but when you need it hallelujah see God is not a song he waits until you need it hallelujah Samson didn't even know his hair had grown back hallelujah the Covenant had already been restored and he didn't even know it but God was waiting Oh Samson for his sight to return hallelujah and what was his sight every battle I ever Lord won was because of the Lord Samson is that right where the Balaam said Sampson gave God his strength and God didn't want his strength God won I don't need your strength God wants your heart with Samson realized every thing that he had achieved was not because of his strength but because of God when Samson gave his heart to God that's when God answered his prayer oh I feel pretty good I'm not going to preach too long because we got convenient but my thing is that we look at this thing and we think amen listen brother Branham talks about all kinds of stuff and you know what was so wonderful they men that tough you know let me let me read this so y'all can understand what I'm saying all right I used when I came into this message we had gifts hello we had gifts the power of God was sweeping down on people people would pray almost all night I'm not just talking about in Columbia we could go up to Michigan and everything else and gifts and everything would be an operation huh come on you sure we don't need gifts we past that yeah you can be passed down and I guarantee you your church did no church dead and you don't even know it but we got the word what this letter the word is spirit like I said the other day this Bible can be burned but that won't destroy the word the word is spirit the word is God brother let me tell you one thing and didn't tell you another one somewhere else he said if one of those coins are missing from your bracelet if one you are considered an adulteress ooh help us Lord you see that's why we got to have grace anybody don't need grace I just don't need grace I need amazing to and when the church lays dead for so long when your church don't have a revival when the pastor just stands with a cold cut dried sermon so that's where y'all want me to preach when somebody says Amen everybody wants to deacons to take him out of the building we hadn't gotten that far yet like I said this morning when you get a church like that it will lay dormant then all let God sin hey I tell you the truth y'all may not know but I've seen a lot of things I went over to Australia I mean yeah Australia I was in New Zealand and I went to a bestest church and they sang the song so slow you know what they had the wrong preacher I got a bit I got a bit I couldn't help myself the zeal of God was with me of course they never invited me back but during that revival we had about three or four new young people come to the Lord but I told them I said they're not going to stay which all singing like see when he gets on me I have to speak of the way he wants me I said they're not gonna stay young people nowadays y'all y'all see these look kids these little children a full of energy and you tell them to sit down that's almost a commandment that's almost impossible hallelujah and what I'm trying to tell you now is the believers of this day when you are true believer they're not gonna settle for this standstill religion that's like tying a little child to the chair and say sit down I mean sit there I was in this church service I can't help it I was in this church service and these brothers was getting to praise the Lord and there was a brother who's and he's not alive anymore a teacher he came down there in the front and shut him down and I could feel the Holy Spirit moving across the audience it was just getting ready to break and that brother rushed over there and shuttle now I've had that done before in Africa I've had it done in Ohio and God judges those things but I thought to myself oh my god I'm so glad if I was pretty if I'm praising God don't you calm down stop me you don't think I got a demon after a while it's like David said I'm gonna get worse [Laughter] hallelujah I might even roll on the floor for you you said that a scripture it is say tell me brother we're under those several seal warriors when they had those crowd the Bible said they threw their crowns off and they hit the flow was they worshiping God they were worshiping God Oh Lord see he said Oh God send his man in there once watch what will take place the revival fires will come back on the altar again people will be crying out for mercy to their souls live with lives will be straightened up okay how can this all happen if we don't allow the Holy Ghost to go in there and identify sin in your life if all you're gonna get is the sweet sound of justification and you're never sent in the first place you came from God you go back to God don't you know that even your prophet of God had to pass through sanctification hallelujah don't you know that even your own prophet had to get the Holy Ghost hallelujah and don't you know he had to constantly watch in prayer with the Holy Ghost don't you know the Holy Spirit had to come down and tell brother Branham if you don't move West you're gonna beat that man he gave him a good fight - in that vision boy he tore him up kicked him all down to heel and the Lord said if you don't move brother branham this is what gonna happen to you can you imagine a prophet you know they would have put him in the papers hallelujah but the Lord told brother brother when you see them digging up to this road and doing this it's time to move west well hallelujah and don't you think that you come to a place Amen were you just so invisible it meant that you can't be tempted in your flesh with the Holy Ghost I had a brother tell me the other day he said even really having some trouble he said brother what I'm gonna do I say you better run like Joseph that's all I'm saying ain't no shame in run it when you're running for your life you love the Lord yeah you know oh come on somebody I'm talking about I gotta do the inspiration to them you just you got to understand you in a warfare hallelujah when sabda was in the warfare what did God allow Satan to do bring him Delilah hallelujah the devil knows your weakness and he's gone sinner one brother in you better run cuz he's gonna sin Delilah right with you and you know what Delilah gonna do take all your strength and she gonna blind you drown you to the truth hallelujah may God have mercy on you sisters you gotta run too but a man is just somehow the devil you think he's a warrior who it's like light like Saul said to David how you gonna beat us I saw how you gonna beat Goliath you brother youth the Goliath hey man he's a warrior from his youth he's got more experience hallelujah but David said maybe in his field hallelujah like a man when that brother and hit brother banner pray Amen for that little boy I think was a boy ain't meant to live and and the mother and father say all praise God my son is gonna live and that nurse says how can you carry on like that seeing the condition of this boy and then how can you carry he's gonna die it's not even it's recorded that anything heartbeat that went down that low ever revived itself that old faithful warrior was called a duty he put his head on her shoulder and says sister say all you know is those were things that you've learned in school hallelujah to you resting on science but I'm resting on a promise hallelujah and that's what the real warrior does he rests on the promises of God I appreciate these our young brothers and sisters I love her she's a precious sister you know I did something about it she just remind me of someone and I don't know who it is uh it may be my sister-in-law hurting her but anyway it's just she's jovial and I don't want to embarrass her but I just think her thank God for her coming up with her brothers and all that and she loves her sing that's one thing we got in common she's got a good voice too amen but I shouldn't throw it out going off on that I just I want to make her feel comfortable and and let her know that you're not left out Amen you know we look at this thing in you and I must understand that because let me tell you something about spiritual people if you're spiritual you're gonna have more problems than a man who's not you take these musicians who are spiritual Satan fight them all the time am I right or wrong probably in ways they wouldn't it not even say hi because when your spiritual you like brother branham you have contact you use sensible to the good and you're sensible to the evil you know both of them and and sometimes it's not so easy to stand with the right hallelujah sometimes that oaf let's get in the way it meant but it doesn't take away who you are hallelujah Peter who was ordained by God to preach on the day of Pentecost nothing could change that and Peter denied Jesus Christ three times hallelujah and Jesus said wait a minute you don't messed up three times boy you can't do this for me now no no no because Jesus we know understand that justification didn't income in this age our justification we were justified before the foundation of the world as though we've never sinned in the first place hallelujah see we're free we're not half free we're free and the devil always trying to entangle us all over again with our past lives our past mistakes and I always tell people that savings into the under the blood why are you trying to remember it when God said he doesn't and y'all don't heard me say this many time we get down and out on our knees time I praying to God and we'll go through a hiss yeah a recall of history just to bring tears to your eyes oh Lord I did this and Lord I'm so sorry and God is looking at you like what in the world what you talking about that's right brother I don't even remember what you what is that where did you do that what day did that take place he started in the sea of forgetfulness and you bringing it all up and then you get a whole hour of prayer that means nothing to God and then the stuff that you need to pray the devil say you don't pray long enough and you get up y'all looking at me like I'm crazy he used to do it to me he used to do it to me but at the world by the Word of God I really see his tricks you love the Lord people I know I said I was gonna cut it short let me uh one more thing in them I let you go y'all it's alright so I want you to understand we have come to manifest this ever it's discipline and I'm gonna read it again coming from Abraham he says now jesus is alive tonight making himself manifested in the spirit of man he did it even before the cross that seemed to me hard thing for people to understand it was hard when Jesus said I was that rock in the wilderness how is that bread that came down from heaven but you did not even borrow your what yeah not even fifty seven years old whatever the case may be amen seemed to be a hard thing for people to understand somehow before the cross Jesus was in Moses Jesus wasn't David Jesus was in Johor just a Joseph look at his life carried out just exactly portrayed the life the life of Christ 2,000 years nearly four he was bought before he was born and here is listen I'm saying this and I'm closing you didn't even know Jesus some of us was raised in Christian homes and in the whole time mama when protecting you nor was your daddy it was God you didn't know him but he gave you things even then all you got to do is think about those little things that are unexplainable and you know that was God you wouldn't him a Christian yet and God still protected you hallelujah see I ran from bullets why did I get a bullet and other people did huh think about that why why when I was in harm's way why did not God allowed these things certain things to happen and they didn't who was that that was the Lord who made me thirst after him he did that one there's a time a period of time in my life I never thought about God but who changed that he did hallelujah it was God calling me it was God wooing me it was God all the time why did people hate me without a cause God did it he wanted to and he wanted me unto himself just like he wants you unto himself hallelujah people trying to even explain the Godhead awake I knew God was one before I knew God I don't need nobody to teach me they had to break it down I knew that before when they said Jesus in the Baptist Church I knew he was God ain't no man walk on the water Kate no man turn Brent fishing and Lowe's and you know but multiply no man can do that can't no man stop a storm y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying all these things to you as warriors to know that your God is the same yesterday today and forever it is your God who's able to do those things just today if you need them we've seen God right brother Keith and everyone and then we've seen God turn storms hallelujah amen brother which we've seen God heal he's the same I remember I was jogging one time I don't testify to this denim cuz I keep going on I'm under that anointing I was jogging hallelujah and Here Come this big dog that this doesn't happen twice in my life the first time the big dog came he was gonna eat me up in the owner had to grab him and I was war I'm not thinking it meant about the prophets message and I'm thinking myself Oh Lord divine love let the power guess what the first time it did not happen if that owner had not called that dog I would be totally terribly injured hallelujah but this second time I'm running down for where I live now and he could have dogged and broke the chain and cross the fence and whatever tomorrow and he's coming at me and he's done barking at these other people in men he saw me coming he coming over to them and he stopped just like that and he did look like he was in confusion and he turned and went right back across the street who did that I'm looking for a branch of branches so he couldn't find nothing and God came on the scene see God don't have to show me nothing he don't have the crew to you all mean that this message is right but he does it with his own we're by his own will and his own choosing remain warriors you might have to die on the battlefield but remain warriors hallelujah I don't want to go to heaven amen and ain't no scars and ain't no bruises like I've been in war let it be so hallelujah amen I like I said by our bodies to be chained we probably won't have the scars but you know one thing we have a memory will remember how certain scars got this and I was in this bed and I was in that battle minute oh my the enemy looked like he had us down but all of a sudden God raised me up hallelujah oh mercy god is so good to us I thank God for His grace [Music] what you play huh pictures my amen Emily you love the Lord yes that's the best thing that song that's a good song amen y'all are sacred with me [Music] you know I appreciate our brother Frank when he's saying songs but y'all gonna have to put more into it don't let him be up there by himself put some anointing in there I would leave to say that I know how he feels and I don't think nobody that's why I said when when I brother Jerry Travers got up there look how the difference would sound like today versus what it was the other day we are army and I know I worked at Fort Jackson and you know and you know how they got those guys behind her back top top top top top dot those guys better repeat dot that that that that that that right because it becomes a unit and we are a unit now when I say put more into it that's not applying is applicable to everybody because I'm sure some of you are but I'm saying to the ones who are not let's give God more hallelujah oh I don't feel like it sacrificed the praise hallelujah you don't feel like sitting standing up you know I tell people say say when the devil said don't do this that's when you're doing you have a right to be a disobedient to him I give me the right God he said resist the devil and evening free from amen amen go ahead brother [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we all really believe that but I'll be over there I'm a runner I'm a jumper I'm a shouter I'm gonna sing hallelujah I don't know whether they're gonna have anybody over there sitting down but I don't think I want to hang with them I might just kiss them on the way but oh by but I'm not gonna stop there because you know there's a time for sitting though we sit there and we'll talk about it talk it over and when the worship going on with now all that worship going on I don't know I don't know how it's gonna be but I know one thing it's gonna be beyond anything we can imagine [Music] all I can say is like I said the other day can you imagine what a a contry sorry I must have see I must have tree look down at that seed and say that's just what I used to be they look over the banister one day we remember what we used to be there's a time he's gonna wipe all the other way but when we think about how we got over how we got him it's only by the grace of God come there for communion it's a song or so [Music] I guess I get carried away when I get carried away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I will into his bed with a evening or I will intern will because oh yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes and we all must know that God loves a joyful sound amen amen truly God is good to us he had been better to us than we've been to ourselves what can I say is that he is faithful in all his doings all of us are different and with one message God can feed us all my mom like that because you can have two or three children and and they wouldn't like the same me and I hope there's no one like this but you know what has always bothered my mind how children are so particular they can have three types of food on their plate and they don't even want one or the other to touch there was a brother who years ago he came to my house we had rice beans whatever and if it would run together he refused to eat it he eat his beans he it is rice now that's his chosing but I like I like mixing it it's gonna be a mess at the end so I like I'm making a mess in the beginning slop it all together I remember down in the country back there when they oh you know those old cooks we you know I think all I'm done died off now but they could put some stuff together it looked like oh what is this but oh when you put it on your plate and put it on a spoon you think and give me more of it they knew how to do it mix up stuff like what in nowhere I can remember it remember so well because I was judgmental like I ain't eating that by God's grace we find out it ain't what it looks like it's what it tastes like that's what makes food good and jesus knows how to do it all he knows how to mix that Old Testament with the New Testament hallelujah he knows how to make it better he knows how to make it sweet hallelujah however he does it nor feed me to love me as we stand we're going to read the scripture according to first Corinthians the eleventh chapter would start by God by the 23rd verse of that eleventh chapter I hope everybody's heart is feeling good for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ii as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh that drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world well for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come and when we think when we think about this this is a passage of Scripture that really I love communion and I would have it every day if I could and I still could be in the scripture because the Bible said as much as you come together that's when you do it but you know we we look at it I love it so because it's a memorial to me you know what God is gone and as long as I'm honest before the Lord when I come to this house to take communion God is requiring honesty from us his this perfection he speaks of is from him but he wants us to be honest with ourselves and others that's why the Bible said examine yourself he didn't say it examine someone else examine yourself because only you know or the battles and the failures and the tests that you've gone through and he knows that you're not exempt from those things but God also wants you to understand that you you you you confess your sins because you know he takes care of em oh is that right there are people brother Branham said God will not impute sin and I really believe that's the bride but that only comes with the Holy Ghost you see that I'm saying that covenant is beyond my my imagination when I see what receiving the Holy Ghost does I mean it's being sealed with it where the privilege is the honor the power the strength all that comes with that joint heirs with Christ it just it amazes me and and and I always tell my family I won't stop til I see Jesus fully made manifest in me I'm not gonna sit down on the side of the road like the hare like the rabbit who says I got this all under control and while he's sitting there and loafing off and falling asleep or whatever he did that little turtle was constantly moving you can't tell me a turtle king came beat a rabbit running we've seen and that's what I'm saying it doesn't make any difference how fast you go it's not given to the swift take your time and let God take his time as long as you finish at the end that's all that matters Paul come alone said I finished my course I look forward to that day oh my god anyway let me read I'm Stewart I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread I'm reading again and we had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doer remembers me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this duty is often as you drink it he remembers me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself inlet and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep but if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another if any man hunger let him eat at home that so that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest I was said in order those of us who are participating in the communion service may come forward father we pray that you [Music] when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me let us eat after the same manner also he took the cup we Nets up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do as ye as often as she drink it in remembrance [Music] in the morning in the morning you can have in the morning [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Hey [Music] Oh give me Jesus give me Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] go to the best review and the brothers room we have our feet wash and it will come back to assemble for dismissal [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]
