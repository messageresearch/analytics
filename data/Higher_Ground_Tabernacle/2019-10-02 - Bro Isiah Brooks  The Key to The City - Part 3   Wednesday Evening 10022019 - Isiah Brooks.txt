John please 14 saij on the 14th chapter we'll be reading from the first verse once again let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas said unto Him Lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way and jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also from his fall you should know him and have seen him let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy and your loving kindness father we pray that you bless the service in a special way forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings Lord give us grace to move completely out of your way that you might speak to your people tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated we realized Amen tonight that we image it's really going home time I was listening to the message according to brother branham countdown and seeing that we really are out of time sometimes we forget but if we could just remember that the same devil that conquered Egypt or the children of Egypt in Egypt also conquered the children of Egypt Israel in in the in the wilderness only because they forgot where they had been delivered from they had forgotten the bondage of Pharaoh and how hard and difficult it became and they forgot that it was God who delivered them not because of their goodness because of their merits as we can see when they got into wilderness they were no different from the Egyptians they did exactly what the Egyptians did they worship the same God that Egyptians did and so you see even then it was the grace of God that delivered them understand when God sends a prophet it's always the grace of God men we don't deserve it but it is the way god has determined to do things every time Israel got in trouble in so much trouble that God needed to dispatch a prophet because they forgot what the Word of God said many of them fail to read it or even teach it to their children and so therefore when you fail to read and fail to teach it to your children expect the next generation to be worse than you were and so that's what happened with Israel they didn't have any character about themselves amen every test every trial everything that came their way they murmured and they complain they had forgotten that God had done such a great work in Egypt and you know sometimes people complain so much till if you're not careful you as an individual will lose your vision remember when Moses got to the Red Sea the people had complained and given him so much trouble he himself lost a vision and lost the very understanding that it wasn't Moses who delivered the children of Israel in the first place it was God and but yet God had given him the authority and I love this because I want you to understand when God is in your life God expect to see some achievements I'm gonna say that again when God is in your life God expect to see achievements in your life God just don't give you himself for you to stand still is that right remember even when God told Adam throwing him out of the dust of the earth placed him in the Garden of Eden and God said it to Adam you must achieve this you must subdue everything but we see that Adam instead of achieving that he never did he failed and because he failed Lucifer or the devil took over his territory you understand me God gives us the Holy Ghost to achieve what the natural man cannot achieve somebody help me here when we think about a new city and like I said we talk about a new world we're not talking about a world as flesh and blood matter of fact Jesus told Nicodemus flesh and blood can't even enter into that place we must understand that the thing that God is dealing with us about is all spiritual and it's all about a spiritual world and the only way that you can get there you must be spiritual hallelujah the Bible said a man that's not even born again he's carnal and he can't even understand those things that are of God I've got a lot to say in a little while but I want to say by God's grace God he then took Joshua and he achieved things by Joshua and he told Joshua the land in which you're about to go in it's full of memorized Canaanites paradise you're every right there is but I want you to go in there and you need to conquer the land y'all understand me but I want you to also understand that wherever you place your feet or your foot amen it's a possession it is yours so what did God said I've given you the land but it takes faith to conquer it right without faith is impossible to please God you can say oh I believe this message but without faith you know never operate for you it takes faith which is a revelation of God that God gives you to conquer the land hallelujah is that right that's what Joshua and Caleb that's why they could come back with a great report they had a different spirit than the others and they were willing to fight to achieve whatever God wanted them to achieve you understand me this is why we go to school folks we go to school to learn and we learn to do what a chief to come to a reality of accomplishment and you and I must understand that God is the same way we are born again we're like children and the whole time God is teaching us and he's teaching us his rules his laws his ways the way he act the way he does and he's teaching us how to have faith because without faith it's impossible to please God understand by God's grace that that but by the walk working of your hand came by the fall hallelujah but everything that Adam was supposed to achieve was to come by faith that right by the spoken word and whatever he would do you can't speak the spoken where you say church chair moving you you don't have faith that the chair will move you must understand that by your faith you operate the laws of heaven yellow by faith you operate the laws of heaven and of Earth is that right it's the truth and you must understand that these achievements only comes through God hallelujah what good is the resurrection if God is not here to do something how would you know that Jesus Christ has resurrected the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe is that I write in my name there's a cast-out delta yeah is that right see these are achievements that Christ performs or do through you right and you and I must understand all of these things that we are now achieving in Christ is to prepare us for the city to come I'm gonna say that again everything that we achieve here is to prepare us for the city to come is that right say give me something to hold on to Samuel who was a prophet here everything Samuel achieve in this life by being a prophet was because over there he was a prophet is that right he had to achieve it here to be there and because he was there he was then able to tell Saul and the Witch of Endor what God has already installed for them so what are you saying brother books we say we're bride where do we become bride here and if we are bride we have the authority of the word in our possession and God wants to see achievements hallelujah I'm a given example when when Ravana described it like this in the countdown he said as science developed and began to achieve things he said the church did the same thing in the spiritual realm is that right he talked about the horse of horse-and-buggy the Wesleyan days and all that and then he comes to the airplane he says he told the Pentecostal were different because they achieved you know a greater spiritual revelation that they could fly above the earth a little bit is that Alright he said but listen as science achieve things so the spiritual Church of the Living God achieve also now they went to the moon supposedly they went into the air supposedly but my point is if they were a Qi able to to achieve those things in the natural what are we supposed to be achieving now we are not supposed to be feeding with the chickens we are Eagles and Eagles cannot eat chicken food hello oh you can't compare the denomination of food with the food in which we are eating we're literally eating off the blood of bleeding Word of God we're eating from the bread of life hallelujah and because we are eating this eternal food it will cause us it would transform us hello it will transform us into spiritual beings the food transfer forms you you don't transform yourself it's the food that you're eating remember you and I know that the food that we're eating in the natural hybrid food and it makes us soft and dhoti and may it make you wonder what the spiritual the people that call themselves bride are eating hallelujah because the real food of God that God has given us in this day will call up cause us to be strong Eagles let me ask you something have you ever seen an eagle with weak eyes no you look at the Eagles are in their Sirius all times hallelujah and that's how it is with the Eagles today they are serious about the things they are to achieve hello you said well what do you mean brother Brooks you got to achieve a certain amount of faith that not only would get you up out of the grave but if you are alive and remain it will quicken your mortal body and take you into an atmosphere or another dimension it is the only way we're going to get there hmm I go to prepare a place for you and I love that because in the 17th chapter of John Jesus pray father would that they be with me out of all the things that brother I'm said out of all the things he ever asked for he has for one thing and that was a bride to be with him now you must understand by God's grace amen that we must go beyond Pentecost here's all will be on Pentecost the spiritual bride is the counter bride is not young you be the spiritual bride will achieve this Holies of Holies place is that right they will not allow themselves to remain in the holy place see in the holy place you got the seven golden candlesticks you got faith with me and rule but in the Holies of Holies God rules and this is what God wants to do with us and then he doesn't want the Holy Ghost just to anoint you and your friends or on your spirit God says you must achieve hallelujah is that right when did the veil of God rent it when it was at the death of Jesus and the veil of God would become visible to you the unveiling of God would become visible to you when you die when you come to that place of death God will then open up the portal she is open but note not anything can go in it you understand me you can't go beyond the way is that right if the high priest was to go behind that veil with sin in his life he would immediately die and neither can you and I go beyond that veil with sin in our lives hallelujah is that Alright she the Holy Ghost comes to identify you and I said that one time before we talked about a city we talked about a pea we're talking about a holy place and the only people that I'll ever get there is that right but Jesus said be holy for my father which is in heaven is holy and brother man said the only way we can ever be holy is that the holy God come on inside of us right amen and we must achieve that God just don't let it just happen you got to work at it ooh absolutely you think you don't have to do anything oh yeah God tries your faith is that right he said Mary and mops I want you to roll away the stone if you roll away the stone you'll see the resurrection two women had to roll away this huge stone let me tell you it took faith for them to do that they could say Oh Lord easily can say God we can't do that we don't have it the strength all the muscles to do it no they heard the word and they went into action see the moment you think about it is the moment you fail you can't think about it you can't process it you must do what he says do right Oh Peter Oh Peter you your Lord we haven't we've been toiling all day all day and we haven't caught any fish he said throw your net on the other side seee he goes beyond your reasoning or beyond your thinking and most of the time God can't use you until you become a failure till you get to a place to realize you ain't got nothing can I say it like that you don't have anything to offer God but your will it is then when you are perfectly weak that's when he's perfectly strong but as long as you feel like you can ask something to God God your work is just in vain God don't need that God need an empty vessel that's all he needs a empty vessel to use somebody to say I I yield is that all right you and I must understand we must and this is what I'm saying we must go beyond the veil we don't have an option if you don't go beyond the veil you will die it used to be death to go in there I'll stay right now is death to stay out you must go in there no anybody could go in there one time only the high priest but now since the blood of Jesus Christ has been shed his whosoever will let him come and every man must go beyond the veil and you can't go there until you become the sacrifice see that usually you have the bulls and the goats and the bullocks and the pigeons and all that no no no you the one now you must live yourself only ulta you must die before God before he can allow you to go there all your will all your reasoning everything you think you can offer God must die hmm that's the truth that was what was wrong with quick equipment with cane he had thought he could offer God something to to to to to qualify him for eternal life there is nothing you can offer God to qualify for eternal life what can you offer him no money nothing there's nothing there the only thing God requires of you is your surrender a surrendered life hallelujah and you guess what we know we cannot win it with a church become lukewarm guess what happened God moves on is that right the Bible says it like this God fused them out of their mouth out of his mouth right and the Pentecost is every Church age that got lukewarm God's peeled out but what about this man everybody that could become lukewarm listen it's a time of repentance it's a time to seek God hallelujah it's time to say God have mercy on me I live my life down hallelujah listen we don't have much time look where our country is not just our country next year if the Lord tarry just 20 20 you better get what you need now hallelujah you better get what you need now because whatever they vote in is going to be worse it doesn't matter who the man is or who the woman is it's going to be worse not just in America all over the world everybody's fighting and where is your hiding place huh the only place Noah had was the ark and the only place you've got is Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right brother branham talked about and uh uh was it Armstrong that win it the neat Neil Armstrong that got in that capsule and went around the world he said I got a capsule that I must get in and so do you and that capsule is Jesus Christ is that right it will not only take you beyond the moon it'll take you beyond the Milky Way amen this is our heart is our only way of going up I'm telling you it's the only way and people of God you can you can do whatever you want to oh praise God I'm gonna retire I'm gonna have all these starts and all the stuff and you are fooling yourself the message has already told us that America is going to fall right and we about there and the world knows it they are listen even when I forgot what that a little booklet I read I must have been in the third or fourth grade I can see it almost in my in my mind but they said even then in a little booklet I read this America will rot from the inside out wait so back then they knew what was coming our way hallelujah let me say it like this any government that refuses Jesus Christ is on their way down every country that ever rejected the power of the Holy Ghost their revival is now in bondage you understand me the resurrection is sure it is a guaranteed you know that me that means it can't fail it's going to happen say brothers ha you know what I've got the earnest of it he done gave me a token hallelujah I know it's real and we're going in a rapture let me tell y'all something y'all know what y'all fighting y'all not just fighting denominationalism and all that you're fighting witchcraft it is highest full word absolutely and I'm gonna tell you something a lot of these churches got witches in them and you know what the preachers are not smart enough don't even know how to discern the difference between the two I'm no fool I know how to pray y'all think I'm crazy I know what I'm talking about I don't worry about witches nor warlocks you know why because God got it all under control see they came to you and they came here to me if God has predestinated us to make a rapture what devil gonna stop it that's what they're trying to do you cannot stop the resurrection it is what it is and God has already numbered the days of these witches y'all think I'm crazy you watch people gonna start dying he goes there what's wrong with them he already you know what God talks to me in prayer and I'm gonna tell you something these people who think they doing things behind these they think God don't see them God sees it all you know I look at these things and I said what you talking about brother Brooks I know y'all don't know what God knows this this God knows but my point is I want you to be aware because you need to know warfare what is warfare pray our prayer if you don't know how to pray the devil got you and the thing about it is people are so spiritual they think because they you know it's just like up there in Canada when they used to say oh they were speaking in tongues and people thinking they had the Holy Ghost barking like a dog come on what Holy Ghost go to bark like a dog that is not the Holy Ghost I don't care how good it feels hello a dog is an unclean thing and God do not tie himself with a unclean thing as such I don't know God got me here it's guaranteed people don't even know that pornography is a form of witchcraft it is what it is and you when you under that spell it is what it is it is a spell and if you don't confess it and make it right before God you will go to hell with that same thing that's how powerful it is it's witches warlocks demon power right straight from Hell trying to take you there what's happening I'm saying you God allow you to fall into it so he knows you can achieve a successful you get out of it not by power nor by might but by my spirit saith the Lord God will deliver you out of all of that but you can't think we are somehow he'll help me out no sir God is looking for desperation you must be desperate you know the thing about it people think that brothers are the only one that falls into that know nowadays you get more sisters looking at that nasty stuff then you do men whoo y'all didn't know that oh yeah this is this is the new world we're dealing with and let me tell you something every you don't fault people what I'm trying to say is this and God knows amen that everything how can you walk the streets you can't even go to the grocery stores the books are already there they're there what we see now was considered pornography in my day we didn't see that kind of stop bikinis oh let me stop let me go on I'm saying these things because I know what I'm saying is everywhere it's everywhere better books y'all you know people don't listen to you on the only thing I don't care the truth is the truth you have to fight you've got a fight to get out of that don't you even think the devil's gonna just let you out easily hmm you and I must understand by God's grace who we are that's the only way you'll be able to set your goals if you can get to you can make the devil you let the devil thank you or I'm just a sinner saved by grace that's all you're going to be you and I must reprogram or let the Bible reprogram us you and I must let God wash us away from the filth of the flesh and the filth of the mind only God can do that but we need to let God do that and we need to let God let it make bring a revelation that we are the sons and daughters of God the Bride of Christ we have a right we have a right and God want us to defeat the devil in his Eden is that right what I'm trying to say I had a precious brother called me today and he just having such battles in that area that's what one of the things that made me think about that and you know he's nowhere in this state he's in another state but he's having a hard time you know what was so bad about it he has a hard time even finding a godly sister in the message hello and he ain't black he's white now says understand me it's more white people in this message here in America then it is black y'all don't know what I'm saying I went everywhere in the world trying to find black people map for my family to marry I did I got tired but I did you understand me but when you got you got white sisters everywhere and you white and you can't find a decent bride something's wrong with the picture that's all I'm saying and you cannot marry somebody because they're your color well let me tell you what if I saw if I had it where I was the only black man in the world and it was the only black woman in the world and she had no character I live single I live single am I making sense why you why about again yeah y'all look strange when I say black and white y'all don't know colors it's real if you are I'm free because I know I'm not prejudiced right and I'm trusting you on either but if you are we'll pray for you my point is you and I must understand it's real and don't ever ever let yourself get that low because I've seen people do it it doesn't work you love the Lord can I go on we're the family of God and you and I must understand we have power is this alright understand me the revelation of Pentecost gave those people so much power and authority they had they seen the eyes of the blind open they seen dead raised they see miracle after miracle after miracle and each page gained more power and more authority and the bride come on somebody she's got more power than the Pentecostals hallelujah why if she can only die to herself gotta use her by way of the spoken word but you got a rot because God don't need your opinions he needs somebody that's going to submit and surrender hello you see brother banner was a was a covenant angel he wasn't just a messenger he brought a covenant just like the first John the Baptist right hallelujah our covenant is different from the Pentecostal covenant our our our our birth our we're up the ladder put it that way and we're right at the end call seven and the next thing is zero or eight how do you want to say it blast off but God cannot move the rocket until the bride of Jesus Christ get in her position where's the authority of this age not the devil somebody help me here is that right when Jesus conquered death hell and the grave and he brought back amen the redemptive the purchase of the redemption it brought us back to a perfect in the eyes of God Satan is no longer at rule in this Eden the bride of Jesus Christ is to rule in his Eden is that right he ruled in ours when Adam and Eve failed God kicked him out because he did not want the devil to rule there but because of the failure of Adam Satan had a right to rule I said not in here y'all better understand me in this kingdom Satan does not rule and that's the challenge that's where God wants us to work and achieve things in him but it only comes by faith is that right y'all think brother Branham just obeyed everything God told him to do God fix it until he did y'all understand me and God gonna fix it until you do when you and I do not do as God wants us to do he gonna spank you and correct you until he can get you to humble yourself hallelujah he wants you to humble yourself him because he wants to use you but he can't use you when you in and out and in and out and in and out he can't do it James says it to be double-minded you unstable in all your ways God can use that he needs some stability hallelujah is that right remember brother man talks about the little boy who won the bicycle contest right he said those guys what other guys were so skilful and everything else and this little boy he said all he knew is to keep his eyes straight on the end and they had to cross this little board on the bike and everybody was different ones was falling off the bike and he was the one they they called him a little they thought nothing was to him this boy is just weak he's a little but one thing about this boy he said when he they asked him after he won the contest they asked him how did you do it he said what I did I focused on the end and I wouldn't look to the left nor right I just kept straight hallelujah and that's what brother battle said he said that's what we need to do focus on the in don't look to the left or the right keep looking at the end receiving the end of your salvation hallelujah all these distractions you don't even understand what the devil is doing he distracting you got you worried about this and got you oh and I've only do this and hi I got problems too but I know the problem solver and like they say you can't get blood out of a turnip don't come knocking on my door for bills cuz I ain't got the money you can't get it to Jesus give it to me y'all understand me why should I worry about it if you ain't got it how you gonna do it but I know one thing if you get down into prayer you get in prayer God coming t realized every bit of money you need don't tell me you can't cuz I don't have it I I was in the Pentecostal church one day and I I was praying before that's when I you know especially when you're singing you're praying fast all the time but I was praying and fasting all the time during that time needed some money because I was in college and everything else and then you know on my knees I didn't even ask God he said today I'm gonna bless you with some money well I thought it was going to come through the mail didn't come I thought somebody was gonna knock on my door they they never knocked I was on my way to church and it started raining and there was a little store or country look store on the side I had to stop there and wait to the rain stop and as I was going up the hill because the church stood up on the hill the Lord spoke to me and says did not promise you some money I said yes Lord he said look down I looked down and there it was the rain held it in place I don't know who lost it but I do know who found it yeah they come crazy oh it's the truth just the other day I rebuked that devil up buying my financials and everything I said you are liya Baba and you know I can't remember all I said and and and and to be honest with you the very next day I received armed alone in the mail no you don't need to know how much it was but it was more than what I had somebody help me in and I thought Lord this is just a little bit coming on come on bring it on y'all understand me you control you you you you you stop worrying and fretting about things and God supplies all needs but we have not could we ask not and you know what sometimes we just don't believe he can do it but God can do all things hallelujah amen that's the kind of city we live we're going to nothing is impossible there and the Bible says now we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus if I'm sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means whatever I desire whatever I need as long as I'm in the spirit and will of God it is mine I just believe it that way I was head where's the wise and where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world have not God made foolish nation wisdom of this world but after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching what I'm preaching right now to the natural man economy it sound foolish hallelujah but what what is more foolish when I'm talking about a resurrection with people that died and around it for years and I'm telling you they gonna get up hallelujah that's foolish little wise man I can Christianity state shut the stuff was that why is God who said it and we believe it like I said everybody tell me I'm seeking you know we got all got problems God always yes it's time to to unfold himself but listen I don't care how sick a man is if he believed God has healed him he's healed God gonna raise him up God will never let his words fail when he knows a man have faith in Him did you know that God will heal if a man has its appointed time to die a certain time god I healed him before he take his life hello y'all know that's happened before people who brother Brad and pray for God healed them and because it was their time they had to go hmm that's how it is let me tell y'all something God will never let his word fall to the ground whether you believe it or not he gonna find somebody who gonna believe it I've said let no man glory in men and how come we do that all over the message we glory oh this man can do this and this man can do that you know I really hate that you go there you know I go to the hominy whoo brother you came and I'm like Lord Jesus help me I have to pray every time before I get up to sing you know why because I need to move out of the way I need to die people be puffing you up it's okay to give compliments every now and again but you know some people get to a place where they almost worshipping you some of y'all don't know what that feels like but let me tell like that why you think I'm hoping that over here in Iowa you have no idea what I've gone through I'm right I got to run from people a lot of preachers ain't got enough sense they let them worship them and then all of a sudden they get pumped up and guess what then because God says no no man go get any glory he causes them to fall let no man glory in men why because all things are yours I'm yours and yours you're mine that's what the Bible says whether Paul or Apollo's Cephas are the world of life or death or things present or things to come all are yours wait a minute that's a whole lot heaven and earth is mine oh god help us think like Eagles right now sig like egos not like chickens down here plucking we're up here all things are yours as far as the eye can see spiritual eyes that I'm talking about they're yours is that the scripture and you're Christ's and Christ is God's everything is of God is yours that's why you said ask what you will and it shall be given we are the children of faith and we are the children of achievements and what the other ages could not do God has placed us here to achieve it hallelujah the Bible said they cannot be completed without us how are you come on somebody you know and I know in a race especially a relay race you take the good man and you put them at the end the fastest one you got two ways you can do it if you got 2 1 2 that's fast you put Blount the fast I defer at the beginning and the one at the end not just in case the ones in the middle slack up a little bit right that one at the end boy he can take it and you see I love track I love a running I think but you know I love seeing that I'm I'm like I just marvel how fast people can refer oh my just look like they look like a blur yeah but anyhow hey God puts us out at the end why because we not only just we don't run like the Pentecostals and try to you know pick it Oh catch the win no we we get this way and then we go this way we Eagles we go beyond the Pentecostals if you can't go beyond the pillow call so you that's what you are Pentecostal but you got to be an eagle to go into the astronaut age as our prophet have said people that's y'all hear what I'm saying my point is you know what's defeating us our own character hello our own character is defeating us but you know what you got to get rid of him I don't care how good you think he is how moral you think he is it has to die God don't need your morals he meet his life in you who people come on let's understand this and I'm gonna tell you something listen desperation is coming wherever you go there now or later desperation is coming if you are to make a rapture your pressure is coming hello and God is gonna put it on you and he's not gonna spare you is that right brother BAM said he said sometimes we whip it before God sometime he feel like kicking us around that's what he said he said God feels like kicking us around cuz may God have mercy cuz you don't ever want him to kick you people of God we must understand every little demon every little thing that we are facing God allowed you say oh I mean let me say like this why not you which would you prefer going to Nero's chopping block eaten by lions huh would you prefer or having battles in your head where you can get you can do you can be delivered yeah yeah the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind but which you prefer think God has been so unjust do you think God been unfair to you because you go through these changes let me tell you all something these young men and these young women you are flesh certain desires that you will encounter it's not evil it is what it is it was set there for reproduction is when you do something you've got no business doing this when it becomes evil but you're not abnormal because you have desires you understand me you're not abnormal that is what the normal person feels but it's what you do with those desires is what God is saying and you cannot control them the Holy Ghost is the only one that can hallelujah those of us with the Holy Ghost have a time or two every now and again Oh somebody say man y'all like y'all got these little halos around your head y'all better understand the Prophet God had to put a cross in front of his vehicle to keep his mind straight that was back then they one more closed in I don't know how to brothers do it I have no idea oh lord have mercy one great thing I love about beginning a older it changes it's thank God for safety hey man glory to God I'm almost done supernatural achievements is to brings a successful end we are here to hear God say well done I don't want to be a doormat I don't want to make it very barely make it in I want to hear him say well done and I'm almost done relevé I'm sitting like this he says Wow we will watch right here before that time comes and see the glorious power of God returned to the church the presence of Jesus Christ the omnipotence showing that he is and where he is right among us doing the same works that he promised would be done in this age here he is proving that he's the same now you say well that's brother Branham but God used him as a wave sheaf it was the Christ in him now but it was showing that would come more like him and you the more you the more don't shadow for nothing less than the more we can't allow his life that's like allowing Jesus Christ like to cut be vain if there was no manifestation of Jesus to prove that he was alive and well his crucifixion was a vain no purpose behind it and we can't allow Malachi foreing God to come through him and you know the son of man we we we we caught all of these things but it's vain if this message don't live in others outside of him it's come to collect the family of god of this age and folks you he had to be serious he had to be trained you must be serious and God will train you and God will spank you and whatever else it takes to get you where you need to be he's gonna do it not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord we have a city whose builder and maker is God and God I'm telling you I said to before the early of the mist I'm gonna close character is the key to the city not yours his character that's the only thing that's gonna get you up it is the only thing that's gonna open up that portal right it's the only thing and I don't care what everybody else is preaching old millions new Moses was a prophet but they fail to allow God to mold their character and every trial they went through was to mold their character and only two of them came up with different spirits that was Joshua and Caleb that's Stan I just love that statement that estimated if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king you and I must know that you can perish one way if you're gonna die let do it for the cause of Christ you're gonna die you're gonna die unless the Lord take you up young or old the grave is waiting unless to wrap to take place and you go there or go in it it's inevitable it's a guarantee ooh [Music] whether you look forward to it or not is going to happen my thing is there's why do we waste our time and I've been asking God iiiiii you know I'm always rededicated my life even today I rededicated my life and I said to the Lord keep me steady keep my eyes focused and keep it steady no matter what things are happening people and I know a lot of the attacks that's happening to my family it's about me Satan is trying to distract me because he knows it's like a domino effect if he can get me it Falls everybody else could be knocked over or whatever just only Sunday my she trying to try to commit suicide again God's continued to pray for her but you know the thing is easier said than done I don't know but I can tell you I saw it when it happen and a lot of times people don't understand but I'm gonna tell you something all folks get to dancing that these weddings and some of the dances that they do is not right I know people don't like me to do that because I saw when the spirit took my daughter I was there and I told her not to do it she did it anyway people think I'm crazy brother books you crazy let me tell you something if God doesn't let Elvis get away with moving and gyrating he's not gonna let you and nobody else do I don't care where you come from that's true it might be a culture thing but everything must die and rot God's Word is the only thing on stand and I get people mad at me because I'm saying it but I'm gonna tell you something one of these old days if people don't repent and hear what I'm trying to say they're gonna wish there had because I know that when I say these things it's a word from the Lord I'm no prophet but I do know it comes from God and I'm gonna tell you something saints of God people think that it doesn't matter when it does you got it you got to trace things back and see where all of this stuff come from is that right it's like short pants people wear short pants and everything else you know I don't know why I'm saying but they don't know they wearing a women underwear they don't know they think I'm just legalistic or whatever because I'm telling the sister don't come in here with these these high-heeled shoes whoa hey the Prophet said a pillock also woman went to hell because she wore high heels shoes he said she had no hope and they they think well we the bread messaging we're justified as though we'd never seen before let me tell you something the Bride of Christ you really believe that and have a revelation of that she does nothing to be contrary to the Word of God is that Alright without God I could do nothing my life would be drifty like God [Music] I will need nothing [Music] get out [Music] y'all believe that without God I am nothing don't want to be nothing [Music] y'all understand what I'm saying when I was talk about the bad the bad dancing all dancing ain't bad it's just when you start moving too much and it distracts you understand I know it's okay either I'm a devil along the Son of God I'm the son of God I'm telling you the truth so you know it's like people people don't understand and I know it's hard it's hard can you imagine what it's like to tell a man who's been blind all his life you can see I can pray for you and you have your sight how can he how could he understand what I'm talking about what he's never seen inside he's never had it so how can he understand what I'm trying to tell him only faith can drop in his heart that what am I saying is possible if he believed and I'm telling you now that's people don't understand but all of the fighting that we got going on around this message this doctrine against that doctor is the very thing that's holding up the myth of the rapture it's the preachers that causes the people to end hello you don't have to say Amen is to in it's the same thing the Pentecostal church did and we doing the same thing how we're going to reach brotherly love and brotherly kindness when everybody is so interested in the depth of the world depth of the word and nobody is interested in living it I'm interested in living because what Paul says what good is going for me and know all the mysteries and can't have challenge you can't even love your brothers and your sisters and disagree and still love you can't do that and you and I expect a rapture but the bride is an entity she's a single person one by one she will accomplish this we're gonna take a rapture and everybody else God knows what he's doing with amen amen there is power power wonder-working power oh thank you Jesus there is power power wonder-working power [Music] [Applause] there is power [Music] [Music] the name [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's a Saturday morning if you need a ride here at 9:30 Oh freshened up 9:15 okay so be

where the it day [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
