Um, God willing, we all going to be together again this year of 202. Um, and I would like to wish everybody happy new year. And may God blessing be on everybody and I always feel very happy every time I'm here. Um God has given me very good friends here and you know the prophet said good friendships comes from God. And I believe that there are very good children of God here. &gt;&gt; And how many can say amen. And I did not come alone. I came with my wife. I was single. But now um I'm married. &gt;&gt; Um I don't know if you saw her, she can raise her hand. So, I'm going to ask you to forgive me. Um, &gt;&gt; I'm not very fast when it comes to preaching in English. So, my going to have to switch to friends. But, um, all the all the codes if you need them, I already give to the back. You can ask them. Without further ado, I &gt;&gt; just have a little subject topic to encourage the people of God. &gt;&gt; And if you can get the message in 20 minutes, we can pack up pack up our stuff and go home. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to keep you too long here. So, we're going to open our Bibles in the book book of Exodus chapter 23 verse 20. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 23 verse 20. Um, &gt;&gt; start reading. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Brother says when you read the Bible, you have to pay attention to the little details because the little the little details make a difference. &gt;&gt; So I want you to pay attention so you don't miss anything. The Bible says 21, beware of him and obey his voice. Obey, Obey his voice. Provoke him not. &gt;&gt; For he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name is in him. &gt;&gt; So, it's starting to excite me already intrigued me to to intrigue me &gt;&gt; because I understand who is this angel that that the Lord says that his name is in him. So this angel must be particular because &gt;&gt; you have to listen to his voice because &gt;&gt; because if you resist him, he will not pardon your sins. 22 says, "But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies &gt;&gt; and an adversary unto thy adversaries in different terms. If if you want God to be enemies of your enemies, &gt;&gt; you must listen to the voice of that angel. 23 says, "For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, &gt;&gt; and the Parizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, &gt;&gt; and the Jebusites, &gt;&gt; and I will cut them The Bible says this angel is is led is is led to to the enemies. &gt;&gt; He's leading them to the territory of the of the enemies. And I'm going to read another verse. It's going to be Psalm chapter 104 verse one. The Bible says, "My soul," um, verse one, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, &gt;&gt; oh Lord, my God, thou are very great. &gt;&gt; Thou are clothed with honor and majesty." So &gt;&gt; this verse says, "Who coverth thyself with lights as with a a garment? &gt;&gt; Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain? Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters. Who makes the cloud his chariot. who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Verse four, &gt;&gt; who makes his angels spirits, &gt;&gt; his minister is a flaming fire. &gt;&gt; Pray. Let's pray. Our heavenly father, &gt;&gt; what a precious moment to be in your house. We could feel your presence when we were singing &gt;&gt; and we came with with a need and you're the only one that can answer to those needs. &gt;&gt; So then we commit everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we prayed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then you can have your seats. I want to talk about a little sermon. It's a big topic that the brother talked about and I'm just going to take a little angle from that large topic and then in just a couple minutes we'll go home. My sermon title will behold I send an angel before thee. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send my angel before thee. &gt;&gt; And just to start this, we're going to start a little race in our in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; I like to read my Bible. because I understand the message better. &gt;&gt; Brother Brah says a Christian must read his Bible every day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that is you can I get an amen on this? &gt;&gt; So the Bible says in Act 12:1, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands to back certain of his. So pay attention verse two &gt;&gt; and he killed James the brother of John with a sword. &gt;&gt; So the verse three is what uh it says and because he saw it pleased the Jews He proceeded further to take Peter also. &gt;&gt; Then were the days of unleven bread. So then we understand that Aerod killed James brother John and because a certain group of the Jews were pleased he also arrested Peter to do the same thing. Why? &gt;&gt; Because it pleased the crowd. But whether you you want it or not, some people are predestinated to do evil. &gt;&gt; And whether you want it or not, the prayer cannot change that fact. &gt;&gt; Because we're here to fulfill the will of our father. &gt;&gt; And if there are here people to who are here to fulfill to to do evil, That means we also have people who are predestinated to do to do good. &gt;&gt; So that's why you not you don't understand. &gt;&gt; You don't understand when they do evil to you. &gt;&gt; You're not able to to return evil to to return evil against evil because your nature is not made up made up of evil. So I'm try I want to encourage somebody this morning. &gt;&gt; Continue to live with the nature that God placed in. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? So then they arrested Peter, isn't isn't it? Verse four says, "And when he had apprehended him and PUT HIM IN PRISON," now follow the details. It says and delivered him to four uh quarter cornons of soldiers &gt;&gt; of soldiers to keep him. So if I multiply four by by four, &gt;&gt; then understand that Peter was kept by 16 soldiers &gt;&gt; and their intention was to bring him before the people after Passover. &gt;&gt; So they killed J and Peter was the was next on the line. So, so then ask yourself a question. Why were they trying to kill Peter? &gt;&gt; Why? Because in that time Peter was was a chief of the apostles. And you understand that if you cut the head, all the sheeps are scattered. So that was the plan of the devil through. Now, verse five is where I'm going to bother some of you. I'm going to look at the translator. So then that he's we're not going to say he was talking about me. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; it says, "Peter therefore was kept in prison, &gt;&gt; but prayer was made without seizing of the church unto God for him. prayer without ceasing. &gt;&gt; So then I understand that when the brother's in trouble, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go talk about it, understand that when my brother's in trouble. I'm not going to get my phone to post the story about IT because posting the story will not bring down on the scene. the church were praying were making a prayer for Peter. &gt;&gt; So then I pray that in the name of Jesus Christ that in this year 2022 &gt;&gt; that if your brother is in trouble, I pray that their church goes in prayer so God can intervene. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says He says the biggest WEAPON THAT GOD HAS EVER GIVEN THE CHURCH IS NOT TO SING. &gt;&gt; It's not dancing, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S PRAYER. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because when you pray, something happens in the spiritual realm. Can I go forward? Brother Brandham says prayer &gt;&gt; IS NOT TO BRING GOD DOWN. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says prayer &gt;&gt; is to go up to God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ASK YOU A QUESTION. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOES UP TO GOD? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PHYSICALLY you're sitting on a chair. But when you start praying, why the Bible says SOMETHING STARTS TO GO TO GOD. &gt;&gt; SO THEN WHAT IS THAT? Let's go TO GOD. But &gt;&gt; let me tell you THAT THERE IS A SOUL INSIDE OF YOU THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE SICK, THE BODY OF SIN, THE SOUL CAN TRAVEL. &gt;&gt; SO THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; let's travel. &gt;&gt; Let's leave this tabernacle. AND LET'S GET INSIDE THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, "Let's travel. Let's leave this tabernacle. Let's go get out from from Let's get get out from from let's get inside the word of infallibility." Satan was thinking that by killing Jesus, he thought he would stop him from preaching. But brother Brown says Jesus was a PREACHER WHO COULDN'T STOP. AT 12 years old, HE WAS STILL PREACHING. AT 31 YEARS OLD, JESUS WAS STILL PREACHING. WHEN THEY PUT HIM IN THE TOMB, JESUS STILL WENT TO PREACH. So do not lower yourself. Your prayer has a power inside of it. Brother Bible says when the weakest of Christian &gt;&gt; get down to his knees, when he starts praying, all hell begins to shake. So I refuse to be the weakest OF PERSON. So then if you're not the weakest of Christian when I start praying, hell has to shake more more than two times. &gt;&gt; So that I came to to to to revive you revolution. &gt;&gt; You know that the biggest revolution the biggest revival revolution happens when people are TIRED OF IT. &gt;&gt; ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. SO NOW WE HAVE TO GET UP. &gt;&gt; Satan can let you sing. &gt;&gt; The only thing Satan will stop you from doing will be praying because he knows that when you start praying, there's something that start to bo that starts start to bother him. I'm going to bother somebody. Can I can you say today I'm going to consecrate all day. Then just the day you said you were consecrated, that's when you see that your child as a demon THAT THAT THAT JUST bothering you. So you understand that Satan is trying to to stop you from praying. So tell your neighbor, let's pray more in 2026. &gt;&gt; Let's pray more in 2026. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; So the people were making prayers. &gt;&gt; They were making prayers for Peter because even because of the fact that they saw pe uh James dieite despite the fact that they saw James die. It did not discourage them to pray for Peter because if God did not answer their prayer for James, then that means it was the will of God for James to go in that time and it's not the proof that he's not going to answer our prayer for Peter. So then verse six now now excuse me I have the ways of of a village guy. So now act like a village guy. So if you see me jump just forgive me the verses. And when would have brought him forth the same night &gt;&gt; the same night Peter uh was sleeping between two soldiers with two chains. He was bound with two chains slipping between two soldiers. &gt;&gt; And the keepers before the door kept the prison. So this is where we're going to start. &gt;&gt; And behold, the Bible says when you hear of behold, &gt;&gt; that means YOU HAVE TO STOP EVERYTHING [screaming] &gt;&gt; and you HAVE TO LISTEN and behold. The angel of the Lord came upon him and the light shined IN THE PRISON. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THIS PART and he smoked Peter on the Can I speak? The angel did not confuse between Peter and the He did not confuse Peter AND AOS. THE angel knew who PETER WAS. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU, the angel KNOWS WHO YOU ARE &gt;&gt; AND HE knows your name and he knows the color of your car. &gt;&gt; He knows your home address. Not that he just woke up Peter, BUT how did he wake him up? &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; the angel woke up Peter. AND HE SMOKED HIM ON THE HE SMOKED him on the side to WAKE UP PETER. &gt;&gt; HE had to touch him. &gt;&gt; So then I pray THAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS Christ that the ANGEL OF THE LORD TOUCHES SOMEBODY HERE. NOT that he does it in A VISION, &gt;&gt; BUT I want him to touch him physically [screaming] that HE TOUCHES YOU where you're SICK &gt;&gt; and the healing operates. I'M FEELING GOOD NOW. LISTEN, after smiting him on hitting him on the side, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Arise quickly. &gt;&gt; Arise quickly. &gt;&gt; Arise quickly." Brother says, "God loves a quick action." &gt;&gt; God does not love people with reasons. SO THEN MY QUESTION TO YOU IS PETER WAS BOUND WITH CHAINS. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HE COULD NOT RISE TO THE EARTH. BUT IF YOU READ, &gt;&gt; YOU THINK, "WELL, I'M BOUND. I CAN'T GET UP." &gt;&gt; BUT THE ANGEL TELLS YOU, [screaming] "A RISE QUICKLY. CAN I GET CAN I GO? IT'S IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS IF I'M BOUND TO CHANGE BECAUSE I KNOW &gt;&gt; that while I'm GETTING UP SOMETHING is going to happen. It's not my BUSINESS TO THINK. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO obey to the voice of the angel. &gt;&gt; Arise quickly. &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, ARISE QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; ACT QUICKLY. ARISE UP quickly and his chains fell off from his hands. &gt;&gt; My question to you is who freed up Peter? &gt;&gt; Did Peter set himself free? &gt;&gt; Peter himself recognized. He recognized that his time was at hand. HE WAS GOING TO DIE. BUT THE PRAYER OF THE SAINTS &gt;&gt; forced the angel TO COME DOWN &gt;&gt; TO SET PETER FREE. &gt;&gt; THEY TOLD GOD, "YOU TOOK JAMES AWAY FROM US. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOOD. But we're not ready to lose Peter. [screaming] Peter was a pillar in this ministry." So that PRE THAT PRAYER BROUGHT the angel down. And the thing that excites me is is that the DOOR DID NOT STOP the angel from getting in. They were in prison. THE DOOR DID NOT STOP THE ANGEL from getting in. Can I go forward? YOUR PROBLEM SHOULD NOT STOP THE ANGEL FROM GETTING INSIDE YOUR HEAD. THE ANGEL IS NOT STOPPED BY THE WALLS. &gt;&gt; He's not stopped BY THE DOORS. &gt;&gt; HE CAN PENETRATE THE WALLS TO SET YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. I I want I want to shout AMEN because that's WHAT MAKES THIS MESSAGE PARTICULARLY. &gt;&gt; We don't COUNT OR NOT MATTER. He says, "Behold, &gt;&gt; I send my angel before thee &gt;&gt; for you to get married. &gt;&gt; I send my angel BEFORE THEE FOR YOU to receive your healing. I send my angel before thee for YOU TO GET INSIDE THE MINISTRY OF POOL. I send my angel before thee." the the most secured person on the planet is not the president the president OF A REPUBLIC. &gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU ARE THE MOST SECURED PERSON. &gt;&gt; Let me talk like Elijah. &gt;&gt; Lord, open the eyes of these people. When you realize that you're not alone, &gt;&gt; then fear will leave you, &gt;&gt; doubts will leave you to know that a supernatural being WALKS INSIDE OF YOU. THEN HE TOLD PETER, "FOLLOW ME." Then Peter said, "How are we GOING TO GET OUT?" &gt;&gt; THE THE GUARDS are at the DOOR ARE RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE uh they're they're standing right there. Can I go forward? &gt;&gt; The angel allowed Peter for a couple a couple of minutes. &gt;&gt; He made him invisible in the eyes of THE GUARDS. &gt;&gt; Peter was walking before THOSE GUARDS. CAN YOU SEE ME? THE BIBLE SAYS HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN A VISION, &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS REALITY. THEY CAN'T SEE ME. THE ANGEL SAID, "FATHER." Then they said, "When they got TO THE THE GATES of the city, Peter said, "How are we going to open the door?" &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS, "AS SOON AS THE ANGEL GOT THERE, THE DOOR OPENED, cannot go forward. I want to TELL YOU THAT SATAN CANNOT CREATE. SATAN is a is an is impersonator. When you go to Walmart, what does the door do when you get when you get there? &gt;&gt; Do you open the door at Walmart by by yourself? Satan thinks he's the one who created that door. The angel already made that invention of the morning. I pray in the name of Jesus that in 2026 THAT EVERY DOOR CLOSED BEFORE YOU I PRAY THAT THE SAME ANGEL &gt;&gt; OPENS ALL THOSE DOORS. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you 2026 SLOGAN A &gt;&gt; EPHRA EPHRASE which means &gt;&gt; it means open up yourself. So when you face a situation just tell God Lord you said in your word that behold I send my angel before thee. So then this DOOR THAT'S STANDING BEFORE YOU &gt;&gt; I TELL THAT DOOR IT MEANS OPEN UP YOURSELF DO NOT DOUBTS IN YOUR HEART &gt;&gt; because God IS MORE THAN ABLE. CAN I GO FORWARD? &gt;&gt; There is nothing that's impossible to God. &gt;&gt; Does the verse stop right there? IT HAS A COMMON. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, "AND TO THOSE WHO believe in in different terms, the one who believes is a God. And a God does not cry WHEN HE FACES SITUATIONS. Even if you cry, IT DOES NOT STOP THERE because Jesus also cried. But then after he cried, &gt;&gt; what did Jesus do? &gt;&gt; DID HE KEEP ON CRYING? THE BIBLE SAYS HE ROSE up &gt;&gt; and he he got he got he got himself back together &gt;&gt; and HE SAYS, "FATHER, I THANK THEE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED ME AND YOU ALWAYS ANSWER ME." &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM says &gt;&gt; that when you pray in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; IT'S AS IF JESUS HIMSELF WHAT'S PRAYING. &gt;&gt; So then you HAVE A COURAGE TO pray for THIS MAN THAT FATHER I THANK YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS ANSWER me and he looked at the tomb. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID LAZARUS COME [screaming] OUT. &gt;&gt; SO THEN IF YOUR CHILD WAS BOUND YOU CAN GET YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER [screaming] AND SAYS COME OUT. If your HUSBAND WAS BOUND, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR HUSBAND AND TELL HIM, "COME OUT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I CAN SAY LIKE, "BROTHER BRANDON, &gt;&gt; HE COULD SAY ROY, WHERE ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; COME SEE. &gt;&gt; COME SEE GOD DELIVERING HIS PEOPLE. SO BE DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; BE SET FREE. &gt;&gt; Receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you want to start, &gt;&gt; if you WANT TO START A PROJECT, &gt;&gt; THEN GO START THAT PROJECT BECAUSE Satan told God, &gt;&gt; he said, "I can't touch Job. I CAN'T TOUCH HIS CHILDREN AND I CAN'T TOUCH HIS belongings &gt;&gt; because there's a protection around him. &gt;&gt; So even your car, &gt;&gt; there's a protection around your car. &gt;&gt; Even if your projects, there's protections around your project. When you go to work, THE BOSS SAYS, "I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU." You tell them, "You can't fire me. You don't have that power on me. &gt;&gt; IF I SAY THE WORD, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE one that's going to be fired. &gt;&gt; Can I start dancing right now? &gt;&gt; Because I know that dancing &gt;&gt; is a sign of victory. Well, THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN DAVID WAS GOING TO FIGHT GOLIATH, &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS NOT CRYING. &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS NOT WALKING. DAVID WAS DANCING &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHY is he dancing?" &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DAVID KNEW that as long as WHILE I'M NOT KING YET, &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS I'M NOT KING, Goliath cannot kill me. So, AS LONG AS THAT PROMISE HAS NOT ARRIVED YET, &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS he says the true faith in the end times &gt;&gt; is not to believe in WHAT GOD SAYS, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S IT'S to believe IN WHAT YOU SAID. &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT you said will will arrive. I'm feeling good because I KNOW YOU WILL RECEIVE a solution to your problem. I don't count on my on my intelligence. I DON'T COUNT ON MY STRENGTH, &gt;&gt; but there is a SUPERNATURAL HELP WHO'S walking before me. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A SUPERNATURAL HELP that's walking before me. 10 minutes before I get to work, THE ANGEL IS the angel MAKES SURE THAT THERE'S NO DEMONS ALREADY. He he he makes the way for me. He makes a WAY FOR ME. AND THEN THE SON OF GOD GETS THERE. HE SAYS, "MAKE A WAY." VIP. &gt;&gt; THE VIP IS ON HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says, &gt;&gt; it says, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." So in 2026, may God renew your strength. MAY GOD RENEW YOUR STRENGTH IN THE WORD. OTHERS can leave the message. But you &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE HAS BECOME YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; CAN I GO FORWARD? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON, &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU CONTINUE PREACHING HIS MESSAGE AFTER GOD TOOK YOUR WIFE AND YOUR CHILDREN? I'm not the ONE THAT KEEPS FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE IS following me. Even if I TRY TO TO RUN AWAY FROM IT, I'M CON I'M I'M BOUND TO IT &gt;&gt; TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. Brother Jesus said, &gt;&gt; he told Judah, &gt;&gt; he said, Judas, you come from predition and you go back to predition, no matter what you're going to do, &gt;&gt; you're going to go back to predition. Can I say that? Somebody here, they're they're condemned to go to heaven. If Judas was was bound TO TO HELL AND THEN THE SON OF GOD IS BOUND TO GO TO HEAVEN, NO MATTER what you're going to do, GOD HAS ALREADY SPOKEN. Brother Brown SAYS, "IF GOD SAYS, "I LOVE YOU," &gt;&gt; he can no longer change that. &gt;&gt; The number of my mistakes DO NOT CHANGE THE LOVE OF GOD TOWARD ME. &gt;&gt; You can laugh at me, thinking that I'm I'm nothing. You think I don't have enough money, but I have the most precious thing. I SEND AN ANGEL before you. I DON'T NEED TO FIGHT MYSELF. SUPERNATURAL HELP that's walking before me. Brother could talk ABOUT THIS AND THAT. HE SAYS IF HE doesn't come and we're going to go home AND EVERYTHING WILL STOP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE will stop AND HE'S HE'S GOING to say he's here. &gt;&gt; I love to hear the taste. I love to hear WHEN BROTHER SAYS HE'S HERE. WHEN HE COMES he's then you can start REJOICING &gt;&gt; because it was the END OF YOUR CANCER. YOU CAN START REJOICING. IT WAS BECAUSE it's the end of your sickness. Do you know that every time that light was was standing upon somebody, something good was happening to that person? But says when I see that that lights on on somebody, it was not there to curse him when God COMES TO HELP HIS CHILDREN. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that the same God &gt;&gt; that the angel of God &gt;&gt; that he stands upon YOU &gt;&gt; and that he sets you free. you can already start dancing because that's you you see I'm always happy because if something happens that means God wanted that thing to happen so then I said Lord what do you want to teach me because when you say Lord I want to SEE YOU I WANT TO SEE YOUERIENCE give me experiences God give experiences through trials so if you want EXPERIENCES THAT MEANS YOU WANT GOD TO GIVE YOU TRIALS. And I let me tell you try the trial is not there to kill you because he cannot give you some something that more than more than you can handle. So get yourself back together and start he start warming up. You know the story. Brother says, "I was standing on a tree and and the the and the storm caused the forced forced &gt;&gt; forced the the the the the plane to come down the eagle to come down." The Brahman says, "I stopped. I was looking. He was not f far away from me." They say, "Do you know that if I get my gun, I can I CAN SHOOT." THE BROTHER SAYS THE EGO WAS LOOKING at him &gt;&gt; and he was looking at him with such a confidence. &gt;&gt; The Brahman says as soon as I was about to get my hands on my god then I saw that he started raising his wings and he started rolling out. It's a way to say THAT BEFORE YOUR HANDS TOUCHES YOUR GAR I'LL BE GONE ALREADY. LET ME TELL YOU THAT THAT EAGLE is you. &gt;&gt; So then cheer tell your neighbor be of good cheer. The the Bible says a difficult life is is coming. But those that will know their God, &gt;&gt; they will do exploits. Do not wait for things to be easy because things will just get worse. But those that will know their god, &gt;&gt; they will do exploits. &gt;&gt; Exploits are things that you cannot imagine. &gt;&gt; I want to give you this testimony. &gt;&gt; I want to bother somebody here. a pastor, a friend of me, &gt;&gt; he had a he had an issues with his papers. &gt;&gt; He applied so they could readjust his status, but they they rejected it. So then they sent him a letter saying that you have to leave this the country in two weeks. Then in two weeks they send him a letter, you have to leave in 24 hours. that he was shaking. He was shaking. He got into a state of of despair. &gt;&gt; Then he said then he said, "If God is God, &gt;&gt; then he has to do something for me." Now we we we we we we're afraid to challenge God. But God loves us to challenge. &gt;&gt; God loves us to CHALLENGE HIM. YOUR GOD IS A GOD OF CHALLENGES. &gt;&gt; So then he reapplied with his lawyer. &gt;&gt; Then a week later they sent him a letter that your your case has been accepted. Why are you clapping your hands? I'm not done yet. Then it was in April. So that he was standing he was sitting there. He was hiding because of his status. because of ice &gt;&gt; because of ice &gt;&gt; and then it was April &gt;&gt; September. &gt;&gt; In September &gt;&gt; in the morning he woke up to look at his mail. &gt;&gt; Then he saw two envelopes &gt;&gt; USCIS &gt;&gt; uh envelope from USCISvel. &gt;&gt; Then he opens the first envelope. &gt;&gt; There's the work permit inside that that envelope. &gt;&gt; Then he says, well then the second envelope, what is it talking about? Then he opens a second envelope. &gt;&gt; There's a green there's a green card inside that envelope. &gt;&gt; So, can I go forward? &gt;&gt; Then he calls me and he tells me about it. &gt;&gt; Then I didn't even believe him. &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, stop playing." &gt;&gt; Then he calls me FaceTime and he shows me the card. I didn't know what to say &gt;&gt; that he says our God &gt;&gt; answers prayers. [cheering] &gt;&gt; So then if God is can do can do something FOR HIM THEN CAN he not do something for me. I pray that in 2026 that God CLOSE THE CASE OF A LOT OF CHILDREN THAT GOD GOES AROUND THAT GOD BYPASS the procedures and that you receive a desire of your heart in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. I have three three quotes and then we're going to go in prayer. AND GOD IS OBLIGATED TO COME down &gt;&gt; because he he is the rewarder of those that seek that that seek after him. &gt;&gt; When you start you already start praying. &gt;&gt; When you start praying, God God is obligated to to um to reward you &gt;&gt; because it's as if you you he owes you something. And brother Brahham says &gt;&gt; that God will owe nobody anything. &gt;&gt; So then stop praying with fear. &gt;&gt; Lord, is this going to happen? God is looking at you. He's laughing. Say the word. The angel will fulfill what you said. &gt;&gt; May God help these people. Some people think we're talking about fables, but then when it's going to happen in your life, you're going to call yourself, you say, you're going to say, "God, God is alive. Does it does it not ren um revol revolt you every time you hear the prophet talk about those things?" &gt;&gt; Do you not ask yourself, "Where did this guy go? this this God I'm going to keep on going am I going to keep on going through this cycle am I can I never be DELIVERED SO that means everything I'm doing will will fail well then if that's the case then I'll go BACK IN THE WORLD so am I going to keep on this way a certain time you have to stop gideon &gt;&gt; the angel appeared And he told him valor. &gt;&gt; A man of valor. Then he says, "What are you talking about? You call me man of valor." Yeah. Man of valor. You cannot call me A MAN OF VALOR. &gt;&gt; I'M HIDING EVERY TIME HERE. How am I a hero if God is God? Um I I want that a cloth that tomorrow when I come back here I want that all this place be dry that the that the the clothes be wet. &gt;&gt; So then it's Gideon who said if God is God then where are his miracles? The Christians here are JUST CONTENT WITH THE SAME THING. THEY DON'T GO FORWARD AND AND and they're happy. &gt;&gt; I came here to bother you this morning. &gt;&gt; Are you happy with the little things? &gt;&gt; In the time of Jesus, Jesus could tell that woman. It was it was not good to give the children's bread to the to the dogs. But in this end time, the dogs became children. In the end time that the the the dogs DOGS DOGS BECAME CHILDREN. We we NO LONGER EAT. We eat on the table of the king. &gt;&gt; So then why SHOULD I KEEP ON EATING THE CRUMBS? &gt;&gt; If God is God, &gt;&gt; if God is God, &gt;&gt; if God is God, &gt;&gt; he must do something for you. Jesus was angry at that man. He said, he said, "My son is sick." Can you do something for me? And Jesus looked at him. He said, "What you talking about? What do you mean? If you CAN you your faith, you have &gt;&gt; Yes, I can do something for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. So then God may God come help uh your faith. May God come help your faith. May God help your faith. Do you know brother says faith is a gift from God. And that faith that means you're anointed and that angel will anoint you. Billy Paul said that no matter the situation, brother Bren would never panic. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Because the angel told him that I will always be with you. &gt;&gt; So then why panic? &gt;&gt; Why cry? WHY CRY? [screaming] &gt;&gt; SPEAK. &gt;&gt; So then I'll read the sermon. the angel of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, &gt;&gt; "I would wish tonight &gt;&gt; that everyone &gt;&gt; would try to understand [screaming] closely the angel of the Lord and his great mission and work here on earth. &gt;&gt; So the angel is not jobless. He has a mission &gt;&gt; to accomplish on this earth, &gt;&gt; NOT IN HEAVEN, ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that that mission &gt;&gt; has something to do with humans. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to DO WITH THE WITH IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HUMANS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I would love you to understand it the way I I I understand it. That's where you understand that when you realize what you have then it gives you a certain strength in prayer. &gt;&gt; You can see what I nothing's working but then God is telling you that thing is working because true Christians are crazy people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Do you want to see the cra the crazy the full the craziness of OF CHRISTIANS? Do you want to see the craziness of Christians there? Do you want to see the craziness of Christians? &gt;&gt; Then let's go forward. &gt;&gt; Abraham old and he called Eliser. He said come. He said my little Isaac here. He's gonna get married, but I don't want him to take to marry those pagans. I don't want him to marry pagans here. &gt;&gt; Now, the brothers of the people to marry pagans. No, he told him, I don't want you to marry pagans here. &gt;&gt; He told him, "Go in my land." &gt;&gt; And get a w a bride for my son that brothers, let's be honest. &gt;&gt; It's craziness. It's foolishness. Then &gt;&gt; Isaac has to come with me. &gt;&gt; No, Isaac is not going with you, dude. &gt;&gt; He's like me. &gt;&gt; I don't know Isaac's taste. Then do you know the answer of Abraham? &gt;&gt; He says, "The L the Lord that I serve will send an angel before thee. He will help you. to find a wife for for Isaac &gt;&gt; in different terms. &gt;&gt; The tasks that you think is difficult will be made easy because the angel is before you. You think it's impossible. But let me tell you that me Abraham have things I've seen A LOT OF THINGS. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU is nothing for God. Abraham experiences of Abraham and knew that the God could send an angel to help Elar. &gt;&gt; Elazar has never had an an experience with angels. Then Abraham told him, you're going to have an experience. Go. &gt;&gt; And Elazar was a faithful servant. &gt;&gt; Then he got to the to the well &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lord, I I'm I'm blocked here. &gt;&gt; But because your servant spoke, &gt;&gt; the the the the girl who's going to come &gt;&gt; if I ask her to give me water &gt;&gt; and that SHE GIVES ME WATER AND that by herself and that on her own if she gives water to the camels as well, &gt;&gt; then that's going to be the wife of Isaac. The Bible says He did not finish praying yet. And behold, Rebecca was coming. The question I'm going to ask you, who went to seek Rebecca? WHO WENT TO look for Rebecca? Who went TO LOOK FOR REBECCA? &gt;&gt; ELEAZAR was praying. He was praying in his heart. He didn't even finish praying. Then the answer TO HIS PRAYER WAS ALREADY PRESENT WHO WENT TO LOOK FOR REBECCA. LET ME tell you that IT WAS THE ANGEL WHO WENT TO LOOK FOR REBECCA BECAUSE BROTHER SAYS GOD WORKS ON BOTH SIDES. Then he sees her. He says uh hey lady can you give me this water? My pleasure. My joy. She had no problem to serve to to to serve strangers to entertain to entertain strangers. She had no problem entertaining people that she didn't know. But then us here, we can't even help pe the brothers that we know. &gt;&gt; SHAME. SHAME on us. Then here's water. Then she looks then strangely she knew &gt;&gt; that if this MAN WAS WAS THIRSTY THAT MEANS his camels would also be thirsty. &gt;&gt; So then she said I will give WATER TO MY CAMELS. THEN LEAR [screaming] JUMPED. HE SAID LORD GOD THIS IS MY PRAYER. My prayer is about to be fulfilled before me. I DIDN'T I HAVEN'T EVEN THEN here she is there. &gt;&gt; So then I like the comments that brother Brham made. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; "Brother Brandham says, &gt;&gt; are you ready?" In the sermon, the time a time the time of decision, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; it was it was in the evening time &gt;&gt; that he got to the well &gt;&gt; near the city. It was around that time &gt;&gt; that Rebecca made a decision. Let's go. I believe that the angel went before her there around half an hour before 30 minutes before JESUS GOT THERE. &gt;&gt; BEFORE Elizer Elizer got there, &gt;&gt; the angel went to look for Rebecca because you she has she had to walk. The Bible says in a half hour. &gt;&gt; So, so then let's read right here. &gt;&gt; For me, &gt;&gt; in fact, &gt;&gt; he will send his angels &gt;&gt; before you may they may make the way clear. &gt;&gt; It must have been the angel of God. that spoke to Rebecca's heart. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "GO GET WATER." &gt;&gt; NOW, the brothers of Rebecca didn't hear the voice of the angel. &gt;&gt; It was only Rebecca who heard the voice of the angel. &gt;&gt; So that means for you to hear to listen to the voice of the angel. You have to be a Rebecca. The angel only speaks to Rebecca. So and Leo was was was amaz so how does this concern us brother says he said it's not my job &gt;&gt; to convince you that the message is the truth it's the angel who goes before Hallelujah. Brother says it's not my job to convince you that this message comes from it's the job of the angel. Moses could not convince ALL THOSE PEOPLE. HE FAILED HIMSELF. So then how is it THAT THE SECOND TIME WHEN HE COMES BACK THAT PEOPLE BELIEVED IN? SO THAT MEANS THAT BEFORE MOSES GOT THERE, the angel wine WENT THERE BEFORE MOSES to convince the hearts of the PEOPLE AND TO harden the hearts of Pharaoh. John the Baptist could not convince God. BUT BEFORE JOHN THE BAPTIST GOT THERE, Gabriel came down to prepare the way for him. That's what makes a difference between the message and denominations. I don't have time to to read. Brother Brham says he says people criticize me for the GIFTS THAT I HAVE TOLD ME THAT THIS GIFT COMES from the devil. Then brother Brandham says he says I made a decision that if God does not meet me I will never come back here. Now, brother, it's in that kind of situation that God is going to meet you. Brother says he wasn't he wasn't he was praying in around two hours a light a big light shone &gt;&gt; and from that light right there a man came out of that LIGHT brother says he I I could hear I COULD HEAR HIM WALK. HE SAYS I STARTED shaking but when he spoke he says fear not says it's THE VOICE THAT I ALWAYS heard &gt;&gt; since I was a CHILD now I could see his face to GO &gt;&gt; I CAME TO TELL you &gt;&gt; that the things that you see happen in your life they come from ARE because you have a mission TO ACCOMPLISH ON EARTH. Brother says, well, I don't have any education. &gt;&gt; I can't stand before all these theologians. Then he says, don't worry. The infalluable presence of God, &gt;&gt; brother. The infalluable presence. &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence. &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence. &gt;&gt; The infalluable presence of God WILL BE WITH YOU IN DIFFERENT TERMS. &gt;&gt; I will be with you. &gt;&gt; So who's the angel of God? LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE ANGEL OF GOD IS THE HOLY Spirit &gt;&gt; who comes down in the form of an angel. &gt;&gt; It's God who becomes a SERVANTS FOR HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD himself will become A SERVANTS FOR HIS PEOPLE. IT'S NOT A WORSHIP OF AN ANGEL, BUT IT'S A RECOGNITION OF ANGELS OF GOD WHO WALK before you. So you can BE HEALED. &gt;&gt; ANGELS OF GOD WHO WALK BEFORE YOU SO YOU CAN RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THEY WALK BEFORE YOU SO YOU CAN HAVE A NEW JOB. &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD, they walk before you so you can be delivered. angels of God, [screaming] THEY WALK BEFORE YOU &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN OVERCOME TEMPTATION. &gt;&gt; Jesus was weak. &gt;&gt; But but the Bible says an ANGEL APPEARED UNTO HIM. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE says an angel appeared unto him &gt;&gt; to strengthen him. I pray that the same angel who strengthened Jesus &gt;&gt; that that angel comes down this morning &gt;&gt; and that HE STRENGTHENS YOU. CAN WE SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; I pray that that same angel &gt;&gt; that he touches your children. &gt;&gt; I PRAY THAT THE same angel &gt;&gt; that he breaks your chain &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOU START SAYING THAT THAT A SPECIAL EDITION &gt;&gt; BREAKING NEWS &gt;&gt; BREAKING NEWS. &gt;&gt; I WAS SICK &gt;&gt; AND NOW I'M HEALED. I WAS BOUND. &gt;&gt; AND NOW I'M DELIVERED. I &gt;&gt; I I was feeling I was I WAS HURT and and and all and AND IT LEFT ME. &gt;&gt; I WAS BARREN AND GOD GAVE ME CHILDREN. I I HAD headache and the headache disappeared. &gt;&gt; I was looking FOR A JOB AND GOD GAVE ME A JOB. I WANTED TO ADD PEPPERS THAT GOD gave me. And let me tell you, the angel will accomplish that for me. &gt;&gt; So, let's stand. &gt;&gt; I'll read a a quote and then we'll finish. GOD IS ALIVE. GOD is alive. &gt;&gt; God is alive. In 2026, &gt;&gt; God will close the mouth &gt;&gt; of of Waters. &gt;&gt; God will close the mouth of critics. &gt;&gt; So, let's read this quote &gt;&gt; and we'll finish. &gt;&gt; ARE WE ARE YOU READY? Are you ready? Are you ready? Brother Brandham says in the sermon from the beginning it wasn't so in the the the paragraph 28 I love this quote brother says then today &gt;&gt; they have the nerve to say people are wondering What happened to the God OF THE BIBLE? &gt;&gt; Where is that God? &gt;&gt; Well, YOU CHOKED HIM OUT BY YOUR CREEDS. &gt;&gt; You've choked him out by your traditions. You've tried to place him back in history. He's the god of history. &gt;&gt; Reverence says when Moses called on called on him &gt;&gt; in in in the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; the God of history rose and he made a way. WHEN JOSHUA CALLED HIM, the God of history rose and he made a way. Faith comes from hearing and hearing from the word. When Daniel called him in the lion's den, &gt;&gt; if I refer to say he made a way, brother Brown SAYS HE'S THE SAME GOD of history &gt;&gt; and he's waiting. &gt;&gt; He's waiting. &gt;&gt; He's waiting. He's waiting. &gt;&gt; He's waiting. &gt;&gt; He's waiting for his people &gt;&gt; to call him out of history. &gt;&gt; GOD is waiting that for you to call him out of history. &gt;&gt; That same God &gt;&gt; remains God. &gt;&gt; That same GOD &gt;&gt; remains God. by our traditions, we've taught them away from the people. What we must do &gt;&gt; is BRING that living faith back to the people to bring BACK GOD TO BRING GOD BACK TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; So then if you have a need, raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Raise your hands. God will God will act this this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pray for you. &gt;&gt; You're going to open your mouth and say say the hour has come. &gt;&gt; It's either you're God or you're not God. So then we'll read the last sermon, the last quote, then we'll start praying. Reverb says in faith, he says the last quote in faith. If the blessings placed on you, then hold still. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's days before he can get to you. BROTHER SAYS, "DANIEL PRAYED ONE time and the angel didn't get to HIM FOR 21 DAYS." Brother says, "Is that right?" &gt;&gt; He says, "I've seen the time. where women and men would wait for weeks &gt;&gt; and the first thing you know ALL AT ONCE &gt;&gt; IT happened the angel passing through the neighborhood because brother spoke the words of blessing on him &gt;&gt; then the angel had to make sure that those that those words will So the angel was passing through the neighborhood as your hands. The angel knows your home. This gives me joy to know that when Jacob wanted to give inheritance to his children. He he didn't he didn't give them money. HE WAS NOT GIVING THEM a home. He said, "Sit down and I'll tell you what's going to happen to you. Brother Bronam says he said Jacob said pronounced words and what he would say &gt;&gt; is what was happening brother says a true blessing is not material blessing but it's the word God in the soul because the word can create money the word can set free the word can deliver the word can give the Holy Ghost. The word on your feet, the word standing on two feet, the the word standing on two feet has more power than the word in the book. The word that's driving the car has more power than the word that's in the book. And that word is you. Brother says, "THE HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THE WORD WILL never pass away."
