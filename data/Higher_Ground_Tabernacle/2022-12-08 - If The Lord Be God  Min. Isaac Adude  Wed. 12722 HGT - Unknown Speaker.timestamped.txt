[31:15] amen and your robe has to be white amen
[31:18] before you be able to listen to your
[31:20] name when God calls you
[31:23] amen uh without taking too much time
[31:25] let's open our Bibles in the book of
[31:27] First Kings
[31:28] uh we read the chapter 18.
[31:31] verse 19 to 21 then we'll jump to verse
[31:35] 39.
[31:37] First Kings chapter 18 verse 19 to 21. I
[31:42] mean it's a familiar uh story of the
[31:44] Bible
[31:46] you managed to show down that the
[31:48] prophet
[31:49] talks about in multiple messages
[31:55] amen First Kings chapter 18 verse 19 to
[31:59] 21 the Bible says now therefore send and
[32:05] gather to me all Israel unto Mount
[32:07] Carmel
[32:09] and the prophets of ball 450.
[32:13] and the prophets of the grooves 400.
[32:16] which eat at Jezebel's table so in total
[32:21] amen Elijah was facing 850 Prophets
[32:25] so Ahab sent unto all the children of
[32:29] Israel and gathered the prophets
[32:31] together unto Mount Carmel and Elijah
[32:34] came unto all the prophet and said
[32:37] how long hard ye between two opinions
[32:42] if the Lord be God follow him
[32:46] but if bald then follow him
[32:49] and the people answered him not a word
[32:53] amen if we jump to verse 39 the Bible
[32:56] says that and when all the people saw
[32:59] saw it they fell on their faces and they
[33:03] said the Lord
[33:05] he is God he is the god the Lord he is
[33:10] the god
[33:11] amen let's bow ahead
[33:13] father Galway come before you Lord this
[33:16] evening
[33:17] Lord just to say thank you Father
[33:20] Lord thank you Father Lord for
[33:22] everything that you have done for us
[33:23] Lord thank you Father for the grace of
[33:26] God that you give us Lord Jesus every
[33:29] morning Father Lord Lord we we're here
[33:32] father God just to talk about you Lord
[33:35] and to spend to have a really great time
[33:37] with you father that's why we pray O
[33:40] Father Lord that you have the first
[33:41] place of God and you calm down no father
[33:43] Lord and you take me out of the out of
[33:46] the way Lord Jesus and you speak to your
[33:48] people this evening father Lord I pray
[33:50] father Lord that you help me to be so
[33:52] sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord so
[33:54] that I can say exactly what you want me
[33:56] to say Lord I thank you Father give you
[33:59] all the glory and honor in Jesus
[34:00] Christ's name amen
[34:03] amen this evening I have a really uh
[34:05] small subject that uh
[34:07] I would love to share with you
[34:10] that we entirely
[34:12] if the Lord be God
[34:16] man that's what we'll be talking about
[34:17] this evening if the Lord be God Amen
[34:21] here the Bible
[34:22] talks about talk you hear the Bible he's
[34:25] talking about Elijah
[34:27] a man he had to prove to all those 850
[34:31] prophets that God was the was the only
[34:33] true God
[34:35] it meant because Elijah knew the God
[34:38] that he was serving and he believed that
[34:41] that God will show up remember if we go
[34:44] to uh uh Genesis chapter 3
[34:48] uh we'll see that the same thing kinda
[34:52] happened to Eve
[34:54] amen both of them knew the god that they
[34:57] were serving both both of them they they
[35:00] had the word of the Lord brought both of
[35:02] both of them they do they didn't have
[35:03] the promise of God but you'll see that
[35:06] one failed and the other one succeeded
[35:08] if we go to uh Genesis chapter 3 amen
[35:11] will uh from verse 1 to verse 7 we'll do
[35:14] a little study on that before I go to my
[35:16] uh subject and when you hear you
[35:19] understand you read uh
[35:22] Genesis chapter 3 verse 1.
[35:25] amen here the Bible says that now the
[35:28] serpent was more saddle than any abyss
[35:30] of the field which the Lord God had made
[35:34] and he said unto the woman yea has God
[35:37] said You shall not eat of every tree of
[35:40] the garden amen here if you understand
[35:42] that you will see that the devil here
[35:44] Satan misquoted the Bible amen this is
[35:48] not what God said because if you because
[35:49] here apparently he thought that he was
[35:52] quoting Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 or
[35:54] 17. there you will you will see that God
[35:57] told the woman to eat of every tree of
[36:00] the garden but the tree of the of the
[36:03] wisdom of of Good and Evil but here when
[36:05] the Devil comes to the woman amen he
[36:08] said that God said that you shall not
[36:10] eat of every tree of the garden Amen in
[36:13] other words he was checking to see if
[36:15] the woman knew exactly what God Said
[36:18] Amen he was checking to find out if the
[36:20] woman a man knew or had a
[36:24] knew the word that she was about to
[36:27] quote here in verse 2 the Bible says
[36:29] that and the woman said unto the serpent
[36:32] we may eat of every tree we might we may
[36:34] eat of the tree of uh uh we met eat of
[36:37] the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[36:39] but of the tree about of the fruit of
[36:43] the tree which is in the midst of the
[36:45] garden God has said that you shall not
[36:47] eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
[36:50] I die amen here the woman understood
[36:52] that the devil misquoted the word amen
[36:55] now she comes by correcting the devil
[36:57] about you know am I saying exactly what
[37:00] God Said Amen the woman quoted the word
[37:02] amen she knew the word that God said
[37:05] amen she had the knowledge of the word
[37:07] it meant by having the knowledge of the
[37:09] word it's not everything that God
[37:11] requires amen God requires us to have
[37:14] the faith Amen in the word that we speak
[37:17] amen you can't say something amen for it
[37:19] to come to pass I mean you have to have
[37:21] the faith Amen to bring that word to
[37:24] pass so the devil here he understood
[37:26] that just misquoting the word amen he
[37:29] will not accomplish whatever he had in
[37:31] mind amen so now he said that well let
[37:33] me change a little bit let me change the
[37:35] side of the tactic amen let's bring
[37:37] because here he came just by misquitting
[37:39] the word and he says that this didn't
[37:41] work so now he comes back
[37:43] in verse 4 of that same chapter he says
[37:46] that and the serpent say unto the woman
[37:49] you shall not surely die amen now he's
[37:52] bringing the woman to join him to start
[37:55] doubting the word of the Lord amen he
[37:57] said because God said that you will
[37:58] surely die amen the Devil comes back and
[38:01] he added the nut saying that you shall
[38:04] not surely die amen but because God is
[38:06] keeping something from you verse 5 he
[38:08] says that for God does know
[38:12] that in the day that you should uh you
[38:15] eat thereof
[38:16] then your eyes shall be open and you
[38:20] shall be as God as God knowing good and
[38:23] evil so here he comes and he says that
[38:25] well if you eat from this tree you will
[38:28] be equal to God Amen you'll be able to
[38:30] do the exact same thing that God did
[38:32] amen you'll be able to create your own
[38:34] word you'll be able to speak amen and
[38:37] then to speak the word and and the light
[38:39] will come and do exactly what God said
[38:41] you will have the same
[38:56] someone to believe God's word it's
[38:59] reasoning am I the only thing that will
[39:01] fail the word of God to come to pass is
[39:04] reasoning so that's why he came and he
[39:06] brought wisdom to the woman Amen to help
[39:09] her to push her to reason even about the
[39:12] word of God Amen so now here in verse 6
[39:15] and 7 the bible says that and when the
[39:18] woman saw that the treat was good for
[39:21] food and that it was pleasant to the
[39:24] eyes
[39:25] and the tree to be desired to make one
[39:29] wise she took off the fruit thereof and
[39:33] did it and gave also unto her husband
[39:36] with her and he did it also and to the
[39:40] verse 7 and The Eyes of them both were
[39:43] open and they knew that they were naked
[39:46] and they still
[39:48] a fig lives together and made themselves
[39:52] and made themselves aprons so here verse
[39:55] 6
[39:56] you'll understand that when the devil
[39:58] came with that word without knowledge
[40:00] amen you will see that the woman he met
[40:03] the woman the woman before she ate or
[40:05] before she sinned the devil had to
[40:08] convince her that whatever she was about
[40:10] to do was right
[40:11] amen because that is exactly what the
[40:14] devil does Amen before he makes you do
[40:16] something wrong and when he will come
[40:18] and start to show you examples and look
[40:20] at it when your pastor did this that
[40:22] means that this is right if I look at
[40:24] the guy that you you take as your your
[40:26] example your Mentor amen look at he did
[40:30] the exact same thing that means that you
[40:31] know it's right and you can do the exact
[40:33] same thing amen that's what that's how
[40:35] the devil came to the woman to to make
[40:38] her believe that whatever she was about
[40:40] to do was right and then after that
[40:42] before and then after that
[40:44] it made you realize that the woman saw
[40:48] that the food was good that the tree was
[40:51] good for food and pleasing to the eye
[40:54] you know it made that sin to become
[40:57] beautiful
[40:58] and that in order for her to have wisdom
[41:01] she had to eat of that tree for her to
[41:04] have the wisdom so the devil came to her
[41:06] and made it made it to be like you know
[41:09] it's a must it meant for you to have
[41:12] wisdom for you to be like God you must
[41:15] eat this fruit of this fruit Amen in
[41:19] other words if you don't eat of this
[41:20] fruit
[41:21] you will never be like God you'll never
[41:24] be equal to God you will never be able
[41:26] to create you'll never be able to Amen
[41:29] to do the uh what God Said Amen you have
[41:32] to eat this it's a must for you to have
[41:34] the wisdom Amen in the Bible says that
[41:36] the woman fell to it immensely ate it
[41:39] amen amen the Bible said that's why
[41:41] Elijah knew the exact word of the Lord
[41:44] amen Elijah knew the god of the Old
[41:47] Testament and he knew that as long as I
[41:49] keep the faith amen God will still come
[41:51] God will come and will prove these
[41:53] people wrong the prophet says here he
[41:55] says that but today the people if they
[41:58] don't get everything they ask for the
[42:01] first time they pray they seem to think
[42:05] that he's dead that God is dead what we
[42:09] need is men and women today of girl and
[42:11] spirit
[42:12] men and women who are determined to hold
[42:15] on
[42:17] till they see a God that really leaves
[42:22] come into action
[42:24] that will not take no for an answer amen
[42:27] there there are determined to stay with
[42:30] it if they are sick and the doctor has
[42:33] said that they can't get well yet
[42:35] something within them tells them that
[42:38] they are going to be well hold on no
[42:41] matter what takes place have uh uh have
[42:45] you joined the churches of the
[42:48] denominational denominational world
[42:50] after you have uh uh accept all your
[42:54] strength from walking uh from place to
[42:58] place and you still can't find relief
[43:00] there is still a God that answers
[43:03] prayers amen and saves from sin amen
[43:07] there is still a God Amen after you have
[43:09] tried him and you have prayed amen you
[43:11] come to God so many times every night
[43:13] amen the prophet said that just keep the
[43:15] faith amen it's not an attempt to
[43:18] forsaken to say that God can't hear my
[43:20] prayers even even though amen that's
[43:23] what the Bible says that that's song
[43:24] that we sing for even though it's four
[43:26] days late a man just keep believing amen
[43:29] God is coming Jesus is coming amen
[43:32] Martha knew that he was late amen but
[43:34] that Lazarus says dead amen but Allah
[43:37] she's already dead remember when she saw
[43:39] Jesus amen that renewed her hope amen
[43:42] she knew that even though four days that
[43:44] has already gone amen by when Jesus will
[43:47] come when Jesus was so up amen the
[43:49] miracle will come amen that exact same
[43:52] thing that amram amen and and your quebe
[43:55] the Father the parents of Moses amen the
[43:58] prophet says that these people amen
[44:00] they've been going to the mountain every
[44:02] night to pray the Lord that God can send
[44:05] a deliverer it seemed like they were
[44:08] praying a god of History amen because
[44:10] it's been 400 years that God is not God
[44:13] was not answering to their prayers I
[44:15] mean it's been 400 years they've been
[44:17] praying for a whole 400 years Lord come
[44:19] and Deliver Us Lord come and set us free
[44:22] amen by be looks like God will sign
[44:24] Island to them he looks like God turned
[44:26] their back to them amen the prophet says
[44:27] that these two parents amen they kept
[44:30] their faith every night they were going
[44:32] to the mountain and prayed the Lord and
[44:34] said Lord send your delivery Lord come
[44:37] and set us free Lord come and Lord hear
[44:39] our prayers amen but after 400 years
[44:42] came to pass amen God came down amen God
[44:46] came to prove that he's the same God
[44:48] because he believed that The God Who
[44:51] visited Abraham amen as Melchizedek amen
[44:55] The God Who visited Abraham as the son
[44:57] of man amid that same God Amen will come
[45:01] to visit them that same God will bring
[45:03] Amen to deliver that they've been
[45:05] looking for amen they knew that The God
[45:07] Who visited Isaac amen The God Who came
[45:10] to Isaac amen the God who showed up when
[45:13] Jacob was in need and when when death
[45:15] was knocking at his door it meant that
[45:17] God who came back Amen to save him from
[45:19] his brother amen they believed that that
[45:22] same God Amen will come and set them
[45:24] free
[45:25] they had to keep their faith amen
[45:28] because if the Lord is God Amen he would
[45:31] do the exact same thing that he did
[45:33] yesterday amen as long as you believe if
[45:35] the Lord is God Amen he will do that
[45:38] amen that's why tonight we'll be talking
[45:40] about that if the Lord is God Amen he
[45:43] will do the exact same thing that he did
[45:45] amen Elijah told them if the Lord is God
[45:47] Amen if you notice that God has done
[45:50] exactly Amen to the details about
[45:52] everything that I said you have to
[45:54] follow him amen you have to serve him
[45:58] amen and God did the exact same thing
[46:00] Amen in verse 39 the Bible says that
[46:03] they all believed in that God Amen they
[46:05] all started to serve God they all
[46:07] started to Amen to to follow that God
[46:10] Amen today we have to raise that God of
[46:13] History amen you have to raise the god
[46:16] of Israel to your praise and crisis amen
[46:19] you have to bring that God of Israel to
[46:20] the present time amen like Abraham did
[46:24] amen he knew that God came to said amen
[46:26] God came to help Isaac amen he knew that
[46:29] God came to set uh Jacob free amen he
[46:32] knew that God came and he fought for
[46:35] them before amen he knew that that same
[46:37] God Iman is able to come to the present
[46:40] crisis and set them free amen he had to
[46:43] have the faith amen that's the fifth
[46:45] that Joshua had amen when he went to the
[46:48] Jordan before the Jordan River amen
[46:51] because the Bible says that they crossed
[46:53] in April meaning that in April amen they
[46:56] have so many rings that the Jordan
[46:58] Rivers becomes full the Bible says that
[47:00] they crossed a flood stage meaning that
[47:04] it was impossible to cross it unless
[47:07] it's a miracle it meant by he remembered
[47:09] that God of History he remembered that
[47:11] God of Moses he said that the God Amen
[47:14] of Moses Who The God Who was with Moses
[47:17] amen with him we cross the Red Sea amen
[47:20] it's the same God today even who will
[47:22] help us even to cross this this Jordan
[47:25] River amen Jordan Joshua taught the
[47:27] children of Israel he said that this
[47:29] morning when he woke up he told them he
[47:30] says that
[47:31] today God is about to do something great
[47:34] just follow the leadership he said that
[47:37] everybody go behind the ark amen go
[47:40] behind the Levi amid the Levi when you
[47:42] will see them amen go behind them and
[47:45] start following them amen because when
[47:47] they will place their first feet amen
[47:49] when they will press their feet in the
[47:51] water and when God will divide this
[47:53] water into amen and they did the exact
[47:56] same thing and God divided that Jordan
[47:58] River amen because you say that the
[48:00] Bible repeated that same story amen the
[48:02] Bible says that uh the the god divided a
[48:06] river or a sea four times in the Bible
[48:08] the first time most with Moses amen God
[48:12] told Moses Moses why are you crying just
[48:14] speak the word amen because I am the
[48:16] same God if the Lord is God Amen he will
[48:19] do this Moses why are you crying speak
[48:21] the word amen Moses spoke the word amen
[48:24] and the Jordan and the Red Sea was
[48:26] divided amen when it came to Joshua
[48:29] before Jordan River amen he said the
[48:31] same thing Amanda I will do great things
[48:34] today Joshua just follow the ark it may
[48:37] just follow the leadership of the Lord
[48:39] amen you will see the great result amen
[48:42] he followed the leadership of the Lord
[48:43] and the Jordan River was divided amen
[48:47] when he came to the time of Elijah amen
[48:49] he was standing before the Jordan River
[48:51] amen with the mantle amen he says that
[48:54] he said he talked to Elijah he said that
[48:56] Elijah asks whatever you want amen God
[48:59] will give it to you amen he divided that
[49:02] that Jordan River amen and then the
[49:04] fourth time when Elijah was coming back
[49:07] amen after Elijah was raptured Elisha
[49:10] was coming back Elijah said that where
[49:13] is the god of Elijah amen he called the
[49:15] god that God of History him and he
[49:17] called the god of History Amen to his
[49:20] present crisis amen saying that God you
[49:22] have done this with my mentor amen God
[49:25] you have done this with your Prophet
[49:27] before me amen that you are still the
[49:29] same God Amen who can do the exact same
[49:31] something tonight amen you are still
[49:34] that God Amen who can set this uh who
[49:36] can divide this River this tonight amen
[49:40] Lord I need you to come am I the same
[49:42] way you showed up when Moses needed you
[49:44] amen the same way you showed that point
[49:46] Elijah needed you him at the same way
[49:49] you showed up when Joshua needed you
[49:50] Lord I need you to be the same God Amen
[49:53] who can show up today because I need you
[49:56] Amen to set this damage to divide this
[49:58] Jordan River amen that's why you had to
[50:00] cry where is the god of Elijah amen
[50:03] because he believed that the same God
[50:05] was with Elijah amen that same God is
[50:07] with me this morning amen he said that
[50:10] be that same God is here so let him do
[50:12] the exact same thing that he did amen if
[50:15] we believe that that same God Amen who
[50:17] walked in the Old Testament amen that
[50:19] same God Amen who walked with Jesus amen
[50:21] is here tonight amen we have to cry to
[50:24] that same God Amen to do everything that
[50:27] he said he was gonna do amen we have to
[50:29] cry to the same God Amen to be our
[50:31] Jehovah Jireh this evening Amen to
[50:34] provide to all our needs Amen to come
[50:36] and to answer to all our questions it
[50:38] meant to come and to heal the sick amen
[50:40] to come and to bless us amen because he
[50:43] is the same God and he will keep his
[50:44] word

[51:37] when cancer is eating the world the

[52:34] who could cleanse the Violet sinner amen
[52:37] and make them white as Lily amen that

[54:29] every time the children of Israel was
[54:30] going where they were going to the
[54:32] battlefield amen as long as they had the
[54:34] ark with them that those enemies they
[54:36] knew that as long as the ark is with

[55:16] where is he at amen how can you show it
[55:20] to me I don't want a dead God I don't
[55:22] want a god of History amen but I want a
[55:24] prison tense God Amen that's what when
[55:27] he sent Moses to the children of Israel
[55:29] he said that Moses tell him Moses said
[55:30] but Lord if they ask me who sent me what
[55:32] can I say to them amen God told them he
[55:35] said God told him he said that God tell
[55:37] them that the I am has sent me amen the
[55:41] I am he's not a god of Israel anymore
[55:43] amen but he is the god of the present
[55:45] tense amen Moses knew that at every time
[55:48] and any moment it meant that I will call
[55:50] on the name of the Lord God will show up
[55:52] because he said that I am the I am amen
[55:55] that's why when he came to the Red Sea
[55:57] amen he spoke to the red cmn and the Red
[55:59] Sea was divided amen that's when when
[56:01] when the children of Israel didn't have
[56:03] something to eat amen he spoke to God in
[56:05] the manner and food came down amen
[56:08] because he was serving the god of the
[56:10] present time amen he was serving the I
[56:12] am God Amen and we have to serve that
[56:15] same God
[56:16] amen that's why Elijah told them if the
[56:19] Lord be God
[56:20] you must follow him
[56:22] amen you must serve him
[56:25] if the Lord be God
[56:27] let him do the exact same thing
[56:29] amen he is the I am he is the Beast of
[56:32] God of present time
[56:33] amen is not a god of the past amen
[56:36] whatever he did in the past amen as long
[56:38] as you have that same Faith amen God
[56:41] would do it amen it doesn't matter how
[56:43] the situation is terrible him and it
[56:45] doesn't matter if the situation is
[56:46] getting worse I mean it doesn't matter
[56:48] even if there is no hope like Brother
[56:50] Sam preached it on Sunday amen as long
[56:53] as you believe that God of the present
[56:54] time amen as long as you believe the I
[56:57] am amen he will come amen the prophet
[57:00] preached it he said that raising God out
[57:03] of History amen you take him out of
[57:06] Israel and you bring it to your present
[57:08] tense amen you bring it to your present
[57:10] time amen you will see the miracle amen
[57:13] whatever he did in the Old Testament it
[57:15] meant he can do it today amen whatever
[57:18] he did with Jesus amen he can do it
[57:20] tonight whatever he did with the prophet
[57:22] amen he can do it tonight as long as you
[57:24] have the faith amen that we praise we
[57:27] pray that God if the Lord be God let him
[57:30] be let him do the exact same thing
[57:32] tonight amen the prophet says in wisdom
[57:35] versus faith for a paragraph 1 14.
[57:38] he says that now what started it
[57:41] man here is talking about Genesis
[57:44] chapter 3 he says that now what started
[57:46] it says the reasoning started it see
[57:48] faith has no reason
[57:50] you don't reason at all
[57:52] am I you believe
[57:54] when you prayed for and accept God's
[57:57] word for healing don't reason with your
[57:59] feelings amen don't reason with nothing
[58:02] else there is no reasoning to it
[58:06] God said so and that settles it
[58:09] in a minute that you reason on God's
[58:12] word then you're losing faith see don't
[58:16] have don't don't have no yes no's maybe
[58:20] so stay right with it see Eve had the
[58:25] right approach amen because she knew the
[58:27] word amen she could she was able to
[58:30] quote that word that's what the prophet
[58:31] says that Eve had the right approach but
[58:34] she listened to his reasonings
[58:36] amen the first uh paragraph one one
[58:39] hundred and seven he says that there is
[58:42] just so many people today that has the
[58:45] right knowledge
[58:46] that knows that this word shall be God's
[58:49] word and it is God's word
[58:52] but they stand and let some
[58:55] Seminary students reason them out of it
[58:59] away from the holy spirit away from the
[59:03] things of God reasonings were to cast
[59:06] them down
[59:07] amen he said that there is no reasoning
[59:09] that's why he says that in your soul
[59:12] amen there is only place for one thing
[59:15] amen it's either Faith or doubt amen you
[59:19] can't have the both together amen you
[59:21] must have one either you have faith or
[59:24] you don't have it at all amen and we're
[59:26] not supposed to reason with God's word
[59:28] amen whatever God says amen you have to
[59:32] believe it amen and when you believe it
[59:35] even you have to act upon it amen if God
[59:39] Jesus tell the the that man that sick
[59:41] man he says that take your bed and start
[59:43] walking amen he acted appointed him and
[59:46] he took his bed and he started walk he
[59:48] started to walk he met the prophet told
[59:50] that blind man go and Proclaim and go
[59:53] and testify that I can see amen even
[59:55] though it was still blind at the time
[59:57] and when he went and he did the exact
[59:59] same thing and days after him and God
[1:00:01] gave him the healing Amen to stop
[1:00:04] proclaiming it meant no place for
[1:00:06] reasoning amen stop proclaiming amen
[1:00:09] when the angel came to Mary and he said
[1:00:11] that you will be covered by the year but
[1:00:13] but the Holy Spirit and you will have a
[1:00:15] child amen Mary didn't wait for symptoms
[1:00:18] to come to show up before she started to
[1:00:20] testify amen she went straight the Bible
[1:00:22] said that she left with haste even she
[1:00:24] went to Mary and to tell her it meant
[1:00:27] exactly what the Angela said because she

[1:00:31] this is the word of God Amen she knew
[1:00:34] that this is God's word and I have to
[1:00:36] believe it and it is true and he will
[1:00:38] come to pass amen and that word came to
[1:00:41] pass amen she didn't wait it's like that
[1:00:43] song that says that amen I can't keep it

[1:01:05] she rose up with haste and then she went
[1:01:08] to testify and when she wants to testify

[1:01:14] sound of her greetings amen the baby
[1:01:17] that was inside of Elizabeth he started
[1:01:20] to leap for Joy the dead baby that was
[1:01:22] inside of Elizabeth amen at the sound of
[1:01:25] Mary's greetings amen when she say that

[1:02:38] to them I believe that my wife amen will
[1:02:41] also be able to conceive amen after she
[1:02:44] was buried for 20 years and the Lord
[1:02:45] showed up and God gave her twins amen
[1:02:48] you will see that spiritual Jacob's wife
[1:02:50] him and after Isaac image she was also
[1:02:53] bearing for 14 years amen Jacob went to
[1:02:55] God and said that Lord I believe that
[1:02:57] you are the god of Abraham and Isaac
[1:02:59] amen if you give to my father's imminent
[1:03:02] children it may not believe that you can
[1:03:04] give me a child amen I believe that you
[1:03:07] can give to my wife a child amen he
[1:03:09] believed in that same God Amen and God
[1:03:11] gave him amen and God gave him a child
[1:03:14] amen you will see Hannah after that amen
[1:03:17] she started to pray and say Lord we
[1:03:19] usually pray the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:03:22] and Jacob amen all three patriarch amen
[1:03:25] amen all three of them amen they didn't
[1:03:27] they were bearing amen their wives were
[1:03:29] bearing amen you give them children it
[1:03:31] may not believe that you are the same
[1:03:33] God I believe that you are the god that
[1:03:35] God who will give me a child amen she
[1:03:38] prayed and she had faith and God showed
[1:03:40] up amen and God gave her a child amen
[1:03:43] you see that the white the mother of
[1:03:45] Samson amen the Bible said that she was
[1:03:46] bearing amen she prayed to that Lord
[1:03:48] word it meant to say that God if you did
[1:03:51] this in the past amen I believe that you
[1:03:53] are the same God Amen to do this today
[1:03:55] amen he said that if Lord be God Amen
[1:03:58] you I believe that you would do this for
[1:04:00] me too and God gave her Samson amen you
[1:04:03] have the sun of my woman amen she was
[1:04:06] also bearing amen she prayed to God and
[1:04:08] God gave her his son amen and when
[1:04:11] Zechariah came amen when Elizabeth and
[1:04:13] zakara came amen when the angel appeared
[1:04:16] to them you see that zakira doubted
[1:04:19] didn't forgive him from the for that
[1:04:21] amen because he knew that God has
[1:04:23] already done this in the past amen so
[1:04:26] you have no reason to doubt amen because
[1:04:28] that same God will be your present God
[1:04:31] will do that same thing in the present
[1:04:32] time amen that's why the angel punished
[1:04:35] him because he was not supposed to die
[1:04:36] to doubt amen God gave them the prayers
[1:04:40] they may God answer to their prayers
[1:04:42] amen the Bible says in Luke chapter 1
[1:04:43] amen uh if I still can't remember that
[1:04:46] verse
[1:04:47] in my Luke chapter 1 the Bible says uh
[1:04:53] verse 13 the Bible said that by the
[1:04:55] angel said unto him fear not zicarious
[1:04:59] for that prayer he's heard
[1:05:02] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the
[1:05:04] son and thou shalt call his name John he
[1:05:07] said that fear not for the prayer he's
[1:05:10] heard amen you've been praying for a
[1:05:12] long time amen that God is not a god of
[1:05:15] ministry book amen he's the I am so
[1:05:19] therefore don't fear because he hasn't
[1:05:21] heard your prayer amen and the baby is
[1:05:23] coming amen fear not
[1:05:26] even for your your prayers
[1:05:29] your prayers are heard
[1:05:31] do not fear
[1:05:33] it man it doesn't matter if the
[1:05:35] situation I mean it's getting worse just
[1:05:39] don't fear amen because your prayer is
[1:05:41] heard
[1:05:42] amen God is not a god of History
[1:05:45] amen he's the present tense God
[1:05:48] amen he's the I am
[1:05:50] in Paul and Silas after after amen after
[1:05:53] the earthquake came and it set them free
[1:05:56] from the prison amen that God that good
[1:05:59] The God when he came to them he told
[1:06:01] them Paul and Silas if the Lord be God
[1:06:04] amen let him give me the same experience
[1:06:07] that he gave you what shall I do to be
[1:06:09] saved amen if that same God is real amen
[1:06:13] let me have that same experience let me
[1:06:15] have him at the Salvation amen Paul told
[1:06:18] him
[1:06:19] believe in the Lord God and you will be
[1:06:23] saved you in the house amen Paul never
[1:06:25] told him to quit smoking amen Paul never
[1:06:28] told him to quit drinking Paul never
[1:06:29] told him to to quit him and the sins
[1:06:32] that he was doing mayor Paul told him to
[1:06:34] believe amen because he knew that
[1:06:36] believing it meant faith is the key that
[1:06:40] unlocks all the doors amen faith is that
[1:06:43] thing that God requires that's why Paul
[1:06:45] said that you have to add to that Faith
[1:06:48] virtue amen you have to add to that
[1:06:50] Faith amen faith has to be the
[1:06:52] foundation of everything it may believe
[1:06:54] in the Lord God
[1:06:56] and you will be saved you are in the
[1:06:58] house
[1:07:00] amen and God is God tonight
[1:07:03] amen if the Lord is God
[1:07:06] why he did for others
[1:07:08] he'll do the same for you amen as long
[1:07:11] as you apply that same Faith the prophet
[1:07:13] says
[1:07:14] he said oh Brethren our religion is not
[1:07:17] a friction
[1:07:19] he said our religion is not a friction
[1:07:22] it's not some Santa Claus story
[1:07:25] it's a real living Jesus don't be afraid
[1:07:29] to put him to the test on his word
[1:07:32] amen he said that don't be afraid to put
[1:07:34] him to the test on his word because he
[1:07:37] will keep his word
[1:07:40] because he will keep his word then
[1:07:43] that's right he will keep his word I
[1:07:46] mean our religion is not a friction I
[1:07:48] mean it's not a science fiction story
[1:07:50] that people try to imagine and to create
[1:07:52] those stories in the Bible I mean it's
[1:07:55] not some Santa Claus stories it meant
[1:07:57] some lies and and some things that they
[1:07:59] make it just to make people believe amen
[1:08:01] but it's something real I mean it's
[1:08:03] something that happened amen it's
[1:08:05] something that took place amen it's real
[1:08:08] it meant to you for you to experience
[1:08:11] that same God Amen you have to put him
[1:08:13] to test amen you have to put him to tell
[1:08:16] him you have to test his word amen you
[1:08:19] have to do it that's why Elijah said
[1:08:21] that amen amen if the Lord be God Amen
[1:08:23] you will follow him amen Elijah came to
[1:08:26] them amen to ask the Lord to prove to
[1:08:29] them that God was God Amen he came to a
[1:08:32] showdown amen the Bible he said that
[1:08:34] Elijah told them to put 12 barrels of
[1:08:37] water in my 12 barrels amen is equal to
[1:08:41] 504 gallons of water amen it's a lot of
[1:08:45] water amen amen God had to burn that
[1:08:48] sacrifice in that water amen and God
[1:08:52] came to God did that amen Elijah had the
[1:08:55] faith amen because he knew it meant that
[1:08:59] same logos amen who was the pillar of
[1:09:01] fire that created the universe amen he
[1:09:04] knew that that pillow fire that spoke to
[1:09:06] Moses on that burning bush amen he knew
[1:09:09] that the same pill of fire that led the
[1:09:11] children of Israel out of Egypt amen he
[1:09:13] knew that that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:09:15] stood between Pharaoh's Army and the
[1:09:18] God's children amen before the Red Sea I
[1:09:21] mean he knew that that same Pillar of
[1:09:22] Fire that descended and and at the
[1:09:24] Tabernacle and talked to Moses amen he
[1:09:27] knew that that same Pillar of Fire amen
[1:09:29] will come down and will consume this
[1:09:31] burnt offerings amen will come down and
[1:09:33] will consume this word offering amen he
[1:09:36] had to have that Faith him and he
[1:09:38] believed amen the same God who showed up
[1:09:40] amen before when his people needed him
[1:09:43] the most amen he's the same God that
[1:09:45] will show up right now amen he had to
[1:09:48] have that Faith him and he had that
[1:09:49] Faith his faith amen was anchored in
[1:09:52] Jesus his faith was anchored in Jehovah
[1:09:54] amen and his faith didn't move amen
[1:09:57] that's why it didn't matter no matter
[1:09:59] how the quantity of the water amen he
[1:10:01] knew that God will still come amen that
[1:10:04] fire will come amen that fire will
[1:10:06] consume the offerings amen and the Lord
[1:10:08] showed up amen if the Lord is with us
[1:10:11] where are all the Miracles
[1:10:14] amen if the Lord is with us
[1:10:17] where is he it
[1:10:19] if the Lord is with us
[1:10:21] amen why are we still struggling
[1:10:24] amen we have to have that faith
[1:10:27] amen we have to have the faith imagine
[1:10:30] if we believe that God is with us is you
[1:10:32] God is God is here tonight amen whatever
[1:10:35] it needs that you have in your heart
[1:10:37] amen God will provide
[1:10:39] amen as long as you believe amen if you
[1:10:42] believe that God is with us whatever it
[1:10:45] needs that you have amen God will
[1:10:47] provide to win amen whatever questions
[1:10:49] that you have amen God will answer to it
[1:10:52] whatever prayers amen that you have been
[1:10:54] praying for it doesn't matter how long
[1:10:56] it has been amen God if you believe that
[1:10:58] God is Lord if you believe that the Lord
[1:11:00] is God Amen he will do the same thing
[1:11:02] amen he will do the same thing he did it
[1:11:05] with the woman who was losing blood even
[1:11:08] she had Faith even the prophet says that
[1:11:10] even though she didn't have any promise
[1:11:12] to lean on Amen but she had faith and
[1:11:15] with her faith she got her healing amen
[1:11:17] that's why you will see that when Jesus
[1:11:19] turned to the crowd amen Jesus felt that
[1:11:22] something had happened amen Jesus felt
[1:11:24] that amen amen
[1:11:26] another virtuous came out has come out
[1:11:29] of him amen that's what he turned he
[1:11:31] said that who touched me amen you will
[1:11:33] see that that same Jesus amen he spoke
[1:11:36] he said that Lazar has come in my
[1:11:38] Lazarus live again amen by the prophecy
[1:11:40] that when he spoke to Lazarus he didn't
[1:11:43] The Virtue didn't leave Jesus but the
[1:11:45] virtue left Jesus when that woman
[1:11:47] touched her amen because she had that
[1:11:49] Faith Amen to take the gift that was in
[1:11:52] Jesus amen to apply it to her situation
[1:11:55] amen she had that Faith to move that
[1:11:58] gift of healing that was in Jesus amen
[1:12:00] to apply it directly Amen to her
[1:12:03] presence to her present situation amen
[1:12:05] that's why Jesus felt that virtue come
[1:12:08] out of him amen because the father
[1:12:10] didn't tell him that that thing was
[1:12:12] supposed to happen Jesus didn't know
[1:12:14] amen that's where one eternity started
[1:12:16] to look in the crowd it meant to see who
[1:12:18] has touched him amen because that
[1:12:20] theachiman was not a simple church amen
[1:12:23] that touch was a touch of faith it means
[1:12:26] that touch was a different touch I mean
[1:12:28] it was a different kind of touch that
[1:12:30] could take the virtue that was in Jesus
[1:12:32] Christ amen to give her healing amen and
[1:12:35] she touched the the the Hem of His
[1:12:38] Garment imagine even yeah I had Jesus
[1:12:41] but she only touched the Hem of His
[1:12:42] Garment amen that touch was so powerful
[1:12:45] that made Jesus weak amen when Jesus
[1:12:47] looked in the crowd that Jesus knew
[1:12:49] exactly who touched her amen because
[1:12:51] something amen was going on in that
[1:12:53] woman amen Jesus felt that presence a
[1:12:56] man of faith and when he turned and he
[1:12:58] said that woman thy faith has healed you
[1:13:00] amen he didn't say that my face Jesus
[1:13:03] didn't say that my garment has healed
[1:13:04] you amen Jesus didn't say that I have
[1:13:06] healed you but he said that your faith
[1:13:08] has healed you amen as long as you have
[1:13:11] faith amen the prophet says that that
[1:13:12] Faith you can't apply it in the church
[1:13:14] service that Faith you can't apply it
[1:13:17] whenever in every moment amen that would
[1:13:19] take the gift of God Amen and I will
[1:13:22] lead it to your situation and you will
[1:13:24] have and your faith will give you the
[1:13:26] result amen your faith will give you the
[1:13:28] healing your faith amen will bring the
[1:13:30] Jehovah Jireh amen that Abraham has been
[1:13:33] talking about amen that Faith your faith
[1:13:36] will bring that God to your situation
[1:13:37] amen that God will provide right amen
[1:13:41] because when Abraham was going up in the
[1:13:43] mountain
[1:13:44] even the people didn't know that Abraham
[1:13:46] was prophesying because he said that the
[1:13:48] son of me were going to pray to worship
[1:13:50] and we will come back amen because
[1:13:53] Jehovah Jireh will provide for himself
[1:13:56] his sacrifice amen and he did provide
[1:13:58] for himself a sacrifice amen that
[1:14:01] Jehovah Jireh he's alive
[1:14:04] he's not dead amen the tomb is empty
[1:14:07] amen we don't serve a dead God Amen we
[1:14:10] serve a God who is alive amen but we
[1:14:13] just have to believe him and we just
[1:14:15] have to apply that faith amen we just
[1:14:18] have to apply it amen it's okay to test
[1:14:20] God amen amen uh uh
[1:14:23] uh what's the name of that short guy in
[1:14:26] the Bible the New Testament will climb
[1:14:27] the tree Zacchaeus he tested God Amen he
[1:14:31] said that if the god that my wife has
[1:14:33] been talking to me about if truly he is
[1:14:36] a true God he will know whatever I am
[1:14:39] amen he will know what I am it may he
[1:14:41] healed himself so that Jesus couldn't
[1:14:43] see him amen by Jesus amen knew exactly
[1:14:47] was it where's Zacchaeus Was amen he
[1:14:49] knew exactly where it was Zacchaeus Was
[1:14:51] Thinking his heart amen that's when when
[1:14:53] he came to where he was him and he
[1:14:55] stopped the exact same place where he
[1:14:57] was he lifted up his head and he says
[1:14:59] Zacchaeus tonight I'm gonna go and eat
[1:15:01] with you amen that was able to change
[1:15:04] his heart amen because he knew that that
[1:15:06] God nobody knew what I was thinking
[1:15:09] about amen by God himself knew amen and
[1:15:12] he started serving God amen if the Lord
[1:15:15] is God if the Lord be God Amen let him
[1:15:18] do the exact same thing that he said he
[1:15:20] was going to do amen if the Lord be God
[1:15:22] this morning this evening amen he will
[1:15:25] do the same thing
[1:15:26] we just have to have faith
[1:15:29] it may just have faith in his word
[1:15:31] amen it doesn't matter if the situation
[1:15:33] is getting worse of course the situation
[1:15:35] will always get worse amen the situation
[1:15:38] will not get easy imagine wait when the
[1:15:41] darkest is the when the darkest night
[1:15:43] amen that's when the morning comes amen
[1:15:46] amen Peter amen he was there by fishing
[1:15:50] for the entire night amen he didn't have
[1:15:52] didn't get anything amen the story tells
[1:15:55] us that Peter amen his mother-in-law was
[1:15:58] sick amen he had some tax money that he
[1:16:01] was supposed to pay amen if he didn't
[1:16:03] have that money if he didn't have the
[1:16:05] money that night and when he had to
[1:16:06] spend his entire life in prison amen he
[1:16:09] didn't do he didn't know where what to
[1:16:11] do amen he was in need of their money
[1:16:13] amen he wasn't that time that Peter
[1:16:16] couldn't find anything I mean it wasn't
[1:16:18] that time in that desperate moment that
[1:16:21] Jesus showed up and he said Peter I know
[1:16:23] that you've been fishing all night I
[1:16:25] know that you've been to that same place
[1:16:26] all night but I am sending you back Amen
[1:16:30] to go to that same place that you have
[1:16:31] been looking for money go and Cast Your
[1:16:33] Nest and this time it'll be different
[1:16:35] amen Peter looked at him and said but
[1:16:38] God I've been fishing this for my this
[1:16:42] entire night I've been to that same
[1:16:44] place I've you know Peter because Peter
[1:16:46] only knew two two things
[1:16:48] amen he knew how to fight and he knew
[1:16:50] how to fish amen because that's what he
[1:16:53] grew up doing amen he knew exactly if
[1:16:56] the moon is if the moon is full image
[1:16:58] that means that I will fish a lot if
[1:17:00] this happens I mean that there is there
[1:17:02] will be no fish amen he said about Lord
[1:17:04] the weather has not changed amen but
[1:17:07] because you said so amen by that word
[1:17:10] amen I will go back and I will go cast
[1:17:12] my neck because I know that you are the
[1:17:15] Living God and this time it'll be
[1:17:17] different amen he went back and again
[1:17:19] God's word and when he casted his nest
[1:17:22] amen and he had those fishes that he's
[1:17:24] been looking for
[1:17:26] at that word Lord
[1:17:28] whatever you say at that word because
[1:17:31] you said so amen this Bible is full of
[1:17:34] promises
[1:17:35] amen you just have to take one promise
[1:17:38] amen you don't need many of them amen
[1:17:41] you don't need 10 promises you just need
[1:17:43] one promise amen that you can lean on
[1:17:46] you just need one promise amen that's
[1:17:49] the body as Paul says in Hebrews chapter
[1:17:51] 4 he says that you just take one promise
[1:17:54] of the Lord and mix your faith without
[1:17:56] promise amen and you will see you you
[1:17:59] won't come short of it it may you take
[1:18:02] one promise and mix it with your faith
[1:18:04] you will see the result amen if we can
[1:18:07] do the same thing tonight it may not
[1:18:10] believe that God will come and God will
[1:18:12] give us whatever we need amen God will
[1:18:15] give us our prayers and may God will
[1:18:17] answer to our prayers amen because he is
[1:18:19] the Jehovah
[1:18:20] him and he is our healer image he's our
[1:18:24] protector amen he's a he's the Jehovah
[1:18:27] that strengthen us amen he is our father
[1:18:30] when we're fatherless amen he comes and
[1:18:33] he comes he's a counselor amen he come
[1:18:36] and he sent the Holy Spirit to be with
[1:18:37] us to always be with us amen that the
[1:18:40] holy spirit is that he's the the
[1:18:42] intercessor between between us and the
[1:18:44] God Amen if that Holy Spirit the prophet
[1:18:47] says that if you pray and you end your
[1:18:49] prayer in Jesus name amen he says that
[1:18:52] it's like Jesus himself going and
[1:18:55] praying for you amen it's just Jesus
[1:18:57] himself going and talking to the father
[1:18:59] and we know that every time in the Bible
[1:19:01] that Jesus prayed amen his prayers
[1:19:04] didn't go in vain amen God always came
[1:19:08] amen God always gave him whatever he was
[1:19:10] asking for amen if you pray today just
[1:19:13] pray in Jesus name just pray in Jesus
[1:19:16] name Jesus will take your place and pray
[1:19:18] for you amen and you will see the result
[1:19:21] amen you just have faith and you will
[1:19:24] see God God will show up because God is
[1:19:27] never late amen he's always on time the
[1:19:30] prophet says that he never misses not
[1:19:32] even one of his appointments amen he
[1:19:34] knew that going to to uh uh
[1:19:38] uh to the house that he will be
[1:19:40] mistreated but he went anyway he meant
[1:19:43] to show us that he will never miss an
[1:19:45] appointment amen even though he knows
[1:19:47] that he will not be welcomed even though
[1:19:49] he knows that he will be mistreated as
[1:19:51] long as you invite him to come amen he
[1:19:54] will always show up amen because he says
[1:19:56] that he doesn't want to give to his
