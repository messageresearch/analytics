[29:59] Jesus Christ we pray amen man let's just
[30:03] get right into the word of the Lord will
[30:04] open our Bibles to the the Book of Luke
[30:10] chapter 1 Luke chapter 1 we'll read from
[30:22] the seventeenth verse a man just want to
[30:32] speak speak a message this evening
[30:34] called the nature of the Lamb
[30:37] amen the lamb does have a nature
[30:40] amen Luke 1 verse 17 says well actually
[30:45] we'll read from the sixteenth verse and
[30:47] it says and many of the children of
[30:49] Israel shall he turned to the Lord their
[30:52] God
[30:52] and he shall go before him and the
[30:55] spirit and power of Elijah to turn the
[30:58] hearts of the father's to the children
[31:00] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[31:02] just to make ready a people prepared for
[31:06] the Lord amen now let's go over to
[31:08] revelations chapter 19
[31:25] amen revelations chapter 19 verse 7 and
[31:30] it says let us be glad and rejoice and
[31:35] give honour to him for the marriage of
[31:38] the lamb is come and his wife has made
[31:42] herself ready and to her was granted
[31:44] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[31:46] clean and white for the fine linen is
[31:49] the righteousness of the saints and he
[31:52] saith unto me write blessed are they
[31:55] which are called unto the marriage
[31:56] supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me
[31:59] these things are the true sayings of God
[32:02] a malicious power has in prayer one more
[32:05] time Heavenly Father we just thank you
[32:07] for these words Lord but pray you would
[32:09] break the bread to the people this
[32:11] evening in the name of Jesus Christ we
[32:12] pray amen amen
[32:15] you could be seated amen the Lambs
[32:18] nature you know the lamb has a nature
[32:21] yoen when God created all the animals
[32:26] upon the earth he brought all of them
[32:29] before Adam he said that he did that to
[32:32] see what Adam would name them amen you
[32:36] know you know when Adam started naming
[32:38] all the animals I don't think he was
[32:40] just giving out just the strict name of
[32:43] it Amen but the name is has to do with
[32:45] what the nature of that animal is they
[32:48] own Adams started giving out the names
[32:50] to the animals you know I don't think
[32:52] God was surprised at anything that Adam
[32:55] said because Adam when he began to give
[32:59] the names to the animals God said with
[33:02] his heart that's exactly the same name
[33:04] that I would have given him if I give
[33:06] him the name myself Amen because Adam
[33:08] did exactly what was his father's
[33:10] business amen so when Adam started to
[33:13] name all the animals whatever he spoke
[33:16] what he said was just like what God was
[33:19] said if God was doing himself amen
[33:21] because Adam had received the nature
[33:24] from his father amen so Adam here is in
[33:28] the nature of his father doing his
[33:30] father's business upon the earth just
[33:32] like his father up in heaven would have
[33:34] done a man sewing when Adam started
[33:36] giving out the names to the animals
[33:39] when he came to the lamb he had to draw
[33:42] from something beyond himself to give
[33:45] the lamb that name Amen so when the when
[33:48] because God already had a nature
[33:50] selected for that lamb right so when
[33:54] Adams went out to give the neat give out
[33:57] the name of the lamb he had to draw from
[34:00] something beyond himself to give out
[34:03] because you cannot give out something
[34:05] that you do not have amen
[34:08] you can't give something that you don't
[34:10] have they meant so what Adam had
[34:13] something he had it because a man he had
[34:17] an ability to give out the names of
[34:19] these animals because God gave him that
[34:21] ability Amen so when the lamb nature
[34:24] came forth before him Adam looked at
[34:27] that lamb looked at that nature and he
[34:29] spoke out something prophetic gray man
[34:33] to that animal and he said you will be
[34:35] called the lamb you will be called the
[34:38] Sheep why because there is a certain
[34:40] specific nature that God must have upon
[34:43] the earth a man same thing with the Dove
[34:46] when the Dove came forth before Adam for
[34:48] God to give for Adam to give out the
[34:50] name of the dove Amen God Adam had to
[34:53] prophesy he had to speak out something
[34:56] out of his mouth that didn't come just
[34:58] from the natural flesh of himself but
[35:00] something that came out from his father
[35:02] amen because God had a certain
[35:04] characteristic in that dove that must
[35:07] that must come out Amen that nature had
[35:10] to be upon the earth there had to be
[35:13] doves upon the earth there had to be
[35:15] sheep upon the earth because God was
[35:17] writing a story a man and God had this
[35:20] story selected before the foundation of
[35:23] the world and that story had to be told
[35:25] amens and God had a son upon the earth
[35:28] by the name of Adam that he was going to
[35:30] use that son to prophesy and to speak
[35:34] out over these animals and whatever he
[35:37] said would come to pass amen so when
[35:40] Adam started speaking he starts speaking
[35:43] to the lamb whatever Adam spoke to that
[35:46] lamb was implanted on the DNA of that
[35:49] animal
[35:50] so at the very DNA that animal would
[35:52] reflect down throughout all the
[35:54] generations that animal is still doing
[35:57] today the same characteristics of what I
[36:00] had back then amen
[36:02] but now we now we we people have changed
[36:06] amen we do we don't just live out in the
[36:08] fields anymore or the caves of the earth
[36:10] we you know we build you know ceilings
[36:13] Oh differently than we did six thousand
[36:15] years amen you know on the and the
[36:18] cement and the drywall and all the
[36:20] paints and everything we do things quite
[36:22] a bit different but it's not so with
[36:23] sheep amen the sheep are still bearing
[36:27] wool the same way they bore us six
[36:29] thousand years ago they're still living
[36:30] in the field like they did 6,000 years
[36:32] ago they they're still living the same
[36:34] way they live 6,000 years ago and
[36:37] there's certain characteristics that God
[36:39] put down in there on the inside of those
[36:42] animals and those characteristics are
[36:44] still being lived out today amen so God
[36:47] said but he said remember he's told us
[36:49] that before the foundation of the world
[36:52] that the lamb had a book amen why
[36:57] because God was going to type out his
[36:59] nature as the nature of the lamb right
[37:02] he said that that lamb nature he says I
[37:06] predestinate before the foundation of
[37:08] the world amen and not only is that
[37:11] characteristics there but there but
[37:13] everything now remember the lamb was
[37:14] annoyed the lamb half you when you go
[37:16] into the book of the Book of Revelations
[37:18] it says that the lamb was gonna receive
[37:21] glory
[37:22] they said the lamb was going to open the
[37:24] seals you know the lamb was gonna write
[37:27] the book of life the lamb was going to
[37:29] get married he goes all these
[37:30] characteristics of what the lamb was
[37:32] gonna do there at the end because God
[37:34] says I am I am I am I'm not care I could
[37:38] have characterized myself as the lion
[37:41] and all these things but we got to this
[37:42] part of the Bible he wanted to
[37:44] characterize himself as the lamb and
[37:47] young God everything that God does he
[37:49] does for a reason amen he does it for
[37:52] God knows exactly what he is doing he
[37:55] knew what he was doing when he created
[37:56] the heavens and the earth he knew what
[37:58] he doing when he created us he God has
[38:01] had a very has a drum
[38:03] that he has been writing out a man I'll
[38:05] ask I want to speak on this morning is a
[38:07] characteristics of that lamp amen
[38:10] now now God has prepared everything
[38:17] before we have need of it God prepares
[38:20] it now when we when we are our children
[38:25] God has prepared us to be inquisitive
[38:30] toads who want desire certain things and
[38:33] he gave us those desires as children so
[38:37] that we could grow up amen now if you if
[38:39] you ever see someone who is was just
[38:42] lazy all their life and they don't have
[38:44] any quiz' to him you think there's
[38:46] something wrong with him he'll never
[38:47] amount to what he could be in it
[38:51] throughout all throughout all of his
[38:53] life why because that nature that he
[38:55] needs to have there has to be a drive
[38:57] there has to be a drive and someone to
[38:59] become something greater than you are
[39:02] when you're our child amen
[39:04] and if that drive is missing then then
[39:07] then you will never become what you
[39:10] ought to be could you adjust the
[39:12] thermostat there if anybody's warm amen
[39:17] the lamb nature so in God beforehand has
[39:22] chosen these nature's to speak different
[39:25] things so in so in God you know God had
[39:28] God did create an animal called a hyena
[39:31] but he never chose that to speak about
[39:34] himself
[39:35] God chose a lamp amen you know and when
[39:39] when you think about you know brother
[39:40] Branham he he told he told the story of
[39:44] how you know the Holy Spirit is like a
[39:46] dove and our brother alluded to that
[39:49] this morning you know and when the when
[39:52] the when the when the when you began
[39:56] acting like a wolf and get all snarly
[40:00] then that dove will take off all right
[40:03] because the lamb has to come down to the
[40:06] duck amen if you are not going to act
[40:09] like I don't like act like lamb then how
[40:12] will the Holy Spirit ever come upon you
[40:14] amen when we begin to realize
[40:16] when you first become a Christian you're
[40:19] diving into the Bible you're reading and
[40:21] you're praying and you have all kinds of
[40:23] power amen but as you become a Christian
[40:27] a little bit longer in your life and God
[40:29] begins to remove himself from you for a
[40:32] little bit to see what you'll do and if
[40:34] you don't cling to him amen that all
[40:36] sudden you start losing that lamb like
[40:38] nature a man you have to fight to keep
[40:41] that amen and if you lose the battle and
[40:44] you remember because when you first
[40:46] become a Christian you know it's all you
[40:48] know fairytales and they're the you know
[40:50] it's you got your a lot going on but you
[40:53] but you know and when you first become a
[40:55] Christian you be kind of prideful you
[40:57] know you know because look you know I'm
[40:59] I'm clean I'm forgiving I'm delivered
[41:02] I'm not like I once was and you can you
[41:05] can kind of start getting a little
[41:06] prideful you know you you've shaken off
[41:09] all the things of the world you see
[41:10] someone who is living in the muck and
[41:12] the mire of the world and you just like
[41:13] boy I you know I I'm not like that
[41:16] anymore I've been delivered from all
[41:17] that but they need to become a Christian
[41:19] for a little while longer let the years
[41:21] go on and on and you you and you know
[41:24] it's this you know you know it's more
[41:26] painful then the sins you committed
[41:29] before you're a Christian it's more than
[41:31] the sins you commit after you become a
[41:33] Christian inflict a lot more pain upon
[41:36] you
[41:36] amen why because it's after you become a
[41:39] Christian when you start doing things
[41:40] that are wrong those are the things that
[41:42] really get you down because those are
[41:44] the things that you know I knew better I
[41:46] shouldn't have done this and the longer
[41:49] you are on this Christian on this
[41:51] Christian / journey the more you begin
[41:53] to realize you know you can't really you
[41:58] can't really blame so let's turn over to
[42:00] 1st Corinthians chapter 4 I just wanna
[42:03] explain a little bit from 1st
[42:05] Corinthians
[42:15] first Corinthians chapter four rules
[42:18] three from the fifth verse it says
[42:22] therefore judge nothing before the time
[42:25] until the Lord come who will both bring
[42:28] to light the hidden things of darkness
[42:30] and I will make manifest the counsels of
[42:33] the hearts and then shall every man have
[42:35] praise of God and these things brethren
[42:38] have I have I in a figure transferred to
[42:42] myself and to Apollo's for your sakes
[42:44] that you might learn in us not to think
[42:47] of men above that which is risen that no
[42:50] one of you can be puffed up for one
[42:52] against the other for who make us see
[42:55] differ from another and what has out
[42:58] that thou does not receive now if thou
[43:00] it is receive it why does our glory as
[43:03] if thou did not receive it and weighs
[43:05] saying there if you have something where
[43:07] did you get it
[43:08] amen if you have a certain ability in
[43:12] your Christian life where did you get
[43:14] that from
[43:14] you got a front up up and if you got
[43:18] from above then why can you use that to
[43:20] glory over someone of your brothers or
[43:22] sisters Amen if you have something that
[43:25] you got from God himself
[43:27] then you cannot use that to glory over
[43:30] your brother or your sister
[43:32] Amen no you have to receive the nature
[43:34] of the land Amen now remember the lamb
[43:36] has come to to prepare a bride so that
[43:40] his bride might be ready amen
[43:42] it wasn't that what the spirit of Elijah
[43:44] was sent for he was sent to to prepare a
[43:47] bride for the lamp a man we read over
[43:50] there in Revelations the marriage of the
[43:52] lamb has come and his bride has made
[43:54] herself ready how she make herself ready
[43:57] by submitting herself to the leadership
[43:59] of the lamb
[44:01] amen so the what the lamb is going to
[44:04] get married it's not the Mary he doesn't
[44:05] get married as a lion he gets married as
[44:09] the lamb amen so how does a lamb get
[44:13] married a lamb must marry another lamb
[44:16] amen so if you do not receive that lamb
[44:19] nature then how are you how can you
[44:22] testify that I am part of the Bride of
[44:24] Christ to be part of the Bride of Christ
[44:27] you must receive the nature of the way
[44:29] amen and the nature of the lamb cannot
[44:32] be looking over at your brother or your
[44:34] sister and saying oh look at them oh
[44:36] look at them the lamb no the lamb always
[44:39] looks at themselves amen the the lamb
[44:42] does not look over at someone else the
[44:45] lamb always judges herself first always
[44:48] looks at herself first amen brother
[44:51] Branham he tells a story about a man who
[44:53] had a vision he said they hid the man
[44:56] was he's going to a church and and there
[44:58] was a lot of infighting in the church
[45:00] and people were fighting about this and
[45:03] fighting about that and and everybody
[45:06] had their own opinion and so this man he
[45:08] was he parked the churches way up on top
[45:11] of a hill and he had to park way down
[45:13] here so he as he has climbing the hill
[45:16] up to her the church was he looked and
[45:18] heard something behind him and he turned
[45:20] around and there was a man carrying this
[45:22] huge load up the hill just struggling
[45:25] under the load and he went up to the man
[45:28] he said oh can I can I help you with
[45:29] this load and also he looked down and
[45:32] saw the man had nail scars in his hands
[45:34] he began to realize oh this is a vision
[45:38] and he said can I help you and he said
[45:41] oh are you carrying the sins of the
[45:42] world he said and the man looked at me
[45:45] says no I'm just carrying your sins he
[45:48] says I'm taking your load so you can
[45:51] make it up the hill Amen he wasn't
[45:55] carrying he wasn't burdened with all the
[45:57] sins of the world at that time he was
[45:59] burned with that man since just so that
[46:02] man can make it to church Jesus had to
[46:06] carry that man sins just so he can make
[46:09] it to church and when sometimes we come
[46:12] into this room and we think we're
[46:14] something hey man yo XY's tell him
[46:16] brother Isaiah Allah as tell him brother
[46:18] Isaiah you know last night I was in a
[46:20] terrible mood and I was just I was
[46:24] working on something at the house and I
[46:26] was getting frustrated and and I was
[46:28] this close to losing it amen it's been a
[46:31] long time since I had been that upset
[46:33] and my wife could tell she was like
[46:36] scuse telling me watch it
[46:42] and just guys getting upset I banged my
[46:45] head on something and and I was this
[46:49] close to losing it and my wife looked at
[46:52] me as she knew where I was at she knew I
[46:54] was not in a good place and she looked
[46:58] at me and I just reached over and gave
[46:59] her a hug she helped calm me down a
[47:04] little bit when I had an itch she was
[47:07] there a man by his sill all night long
[47:10] that frustration didn't leak amen and I
[47:13] knew I was preaching this today and I
[47:15] should have come here to prepare but I
[47:16] didn't feel like I was in the right mind
[47:18] to be preparing and so I should've come
[47:21] here to pray anyway but instead of
[47:23] praying I just went to bed
[47:24] and I should have taken care of it that
[47:27] night amen and I didn't do it so when I
[47:30] came in to church this morning I went
[47:33] back there behind the sound booth I knew
[47:34] I wasn't in the right attitude to be in
[47:36] this room and I was just sitting there
[47:39] and I was like I just I was not in the
[47:41] right attitude so I went back to the
[47:43] office I told brother Isaiah because I
[47:45] don't want to waste a service I came
[47:47] here to get something a mint and I don't
[47:49] want to waste a service amen I believe
[47:52] that when two or three are gathered in
[47:53] his name a he'll show up right here in
[47:56] the midst and when we're in this room
[47:58] then I want to be able to to partake of
[48:01] whatever benefit they he has for us
[48:04] Amen so I want her to brother Isaiah's
[48:06] office I said boy I would you pray for
[48:07] me I'm not in my right mind and my
[48:11] brother put his hands upon me he prayed
[48:13] for me and instantly it was gone Amen
[48:16] because I could feel what they myself
[48:17] that that frustration wasn't there was
[48:20] still there and then you know what that
[48:22] was not the Lamb nature amen and when we
[48:26] come into this house into this room
[48:28] we're coming into this room we have to
[48:31] have a lamb nature to get something amen
[48:34] if you don't come in here with a lamb
[48:36] nature you're not getting anything amen
[48:38] we have to have the nature of the land
[48:41] amen because if you don't let me repeat
[48:43] that if you come into this room without
[48:46] the lamb nature how can you have
[48:48] something how can you get something amen
[48:52] as we're here to receive from him
[48:53] now remember lambs are innocent
[48:56] amen a lamb is meek a lamb is gentle a
[49:01] lamb has to be lit a lamb does not speak
[49:06] out but it received whatever is speaking
[49:08] to it
[49:09] amen in gentleness and in quietness it
[49:12] receives from others
[49:14] amen it receives the leadership of the
[49:16] Shepherd Amen right amen
[49:19] and remember what was had the chief
[49:21] Shepherd has his Shepherd stationed here
[49:25] to preach out the gospel and the Lambs
[49:28] gather themselves to hear from the
[49:30] Shepherd that God has chosen amen and in
[49:33] order to see that yet be meek and gentle
[49:35] yourself but when you have your own a
[49:38] puffed up thought of yourself then how
[49:42] can you ever receive from the lamb
[49:44] amen you can't do it amen
[49:47] so in Luke chapter 1 verse 17 God says I
[49:50] sent forth a message I sent forth a
[49:54] message by John the Baptist to prepare a
[49:57] people for the because the Lord's coming
[50:00] amen and the wind and the way has to be
[50:04] made straight so that when the Lord
[50:06] comes that people are prepared
[50:08] beforehand
[50:10] amen how are they prepared beforehand
[50:12] they have to receive the Lamb nature
[50:14] amen and what when when and when John
[50:18] the Baptist saw the Son of God he said
[50:21] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[50:23] the sins of the world
[50:25] amen and when he saw that lamb all
[50:28] sudden he saw the Spirit of the God
[50:30] remember God told beforehand when you
[50:32] see the Spirit of God descending like a
[50:34] dove whomever that dubbed the sins upon
[50:37] that is the Lamb of God amen and so when
[50:40] John was looking out over the audience
[50:42] and he saw the Lamb of God descending
[50:45] upon Christ or he saw the dove
[50:47] descending upon Christ he knew that is
[50:51] the Lamb of God amen and he directed
[50:54] everybody I must decrease he must
[50:56] increase go follow that lamb
[50:59] Amen what happens when they followed
[51:01] that lamb they were given power to
[51:04] become the children of that lamb to
[51:06] become lambs themselves a
[51:08] and all of us have been given that power
[51:11] to become lambs of God amen if you don't
[51:14] receive that power then you'll have
[51:16] anything
[51:17] Amen if you do not receive the Lamb
[51:19] nature you don't have anything amai you
[51:22] could think that oh look how many songs
[51:24] I can sing look how much I can worship
[51:26] look how much I can raise my hands look
[51:29] how much I can pray look how spiritual I
[51:31] can look but unless you receive that
[51:33] Lamb nature you don't have thee because
[51:35] the lamb is coming to to receive a wife
[51:37] the land the marriage of the lamb has
[51:40] come his bride has made herself ready
[51:43] how how'd she make herself ready by
[51:45] receiving the nature of the lamb amen
[51:47] and the Spirit of God is still
[51:49] descending amen amen oh I wasn't just
[51:52] for Christ alone the Spirit of God is
[51:55] still descending and he's descending on
[51:57] those that had the lamb nature amen and
[52:01] how do you how do you have to have the
[52:02] lamb nature you have to be just like the
[52:04] lamb say message brother Graham said he
[52:08] went over to a restaurant and and there
[52:11] was a woman there his dress all real
[52:12] nice
[52:13] she has dressed real sweetly and a long
[52:17] dress on and long hair and and and he
[52:20] went to go talk to her and he said oh do
[52:22] you go to life tabernacle there in
[52:25] Shreveport and she said well I do but
[52:28] they won't let me sing on the choir
[52:29] because because I got because they won't
[52:32] let me sing with paint on I got makeup
[52:34] on because they won't let me those
[52:36] people down there they won't let me sing
[52:37] them choir she looked like she had the
[52:40] lamb nature but eschews her mouth opened
[52:44] she she revealed that she didn't have
[52:47] the lamb nature amen as the same thing
[52:50] with us you can look like you have a
[52:52] lamb nature but when you're open up your
[52:55] mouth what comes out is it the nature of
[52:57] a lamb remember a lamb bleats a lamb
[53:00] goes baa baa now what you have to have
[53:04] that sound Amen you have to sound like a
[53:07] lamp
[53:07] if you don't sound like a lamb that you
[53:09] don't have the lamb nature if you don't
[53:10] walk like a lamb you don't have a lamb
[53:12] nature if you don't bear the fruits of a
[53:14] lamb you don't have a lamb nature amai
[53:17] if you don't lay down your life like a
[53:18] lamb then you don't have the lamb nature
[53:22] hey may you see a lot of people to come
[53:24] in to church but they won't lay their
[53:25] lives down that's not the lamb nature
[53:28] how can you come into this room day in
[53:31] day out day in day out week in week out
[53:33] and say oh I am I'm hoping to get
[53:36] something but you never lay your life
[53:37] down then the Holy Spirit will never
[53:41] descend upon me the Holy Spirit can't
[53:44] descend upon that now remember the law
[53:46] the dove and the lamb have a similar
[53:48] nature right they're both innocent
[53:51] they're both white
[53:53] they're both meek they both the one
[53:57] bears the the oil the what other bears
[54:00] lanolin they both keep their their wool
[54:02] they're their coats clean by what they
[54:04] bear
[54:04] amen and they both a they're meek you
[54:07] know that they don't have a Gaul they
[54:09] don't you know they're there they have
[54:10] the same nature the same temperament
[54:12] amen so the one is attracted to the
[54:16] other think about that the one is
[54:19] attracted to the other now how does
[54:23] Christ ever going to be attracted to you
[54:26] until you have the Lamb nature now he
[54:30] died for us while we were yet sinners
[54:32] but he first saw before the foundation
[54:34] of the world that we would have the week
[54:37] he put that nature in there down on the
[54:39] inside as waiting for it to manifest now
[54:42] he has a right to receive what he puts
[54:45] in remember he is the husbandman if he
[54:48] plants the seed he has a right to the
[54:50] fruits after they grow so it what he
[54:53] plants the nature down the inside and
[54:55] he's coming back to receive the fruits
[54:57] from your life a my boy if he comes the
[55:00] past your life and the fruits aren't
[55:02] growing then you're holding out on him
[55:04] amen amen so judge nothing before the
[55:09] time amen because all the hearts will be
[55:11] judged at that day they may think about
[55:15] you knowing you when you uh when you all
[55:18] of us were born in sin you know when you
[55:20] have children and you look at your
[55:22] children and someday when you you know
[55:23] you you're looking at your children and
[55:26] they're fighting and bickering and
[55:27] they're and you ask them something and
[55:29] they always put the blame on somebody
[55:30] else they always put the blame on
[55:32] somebody else you know why because their
[55:34] children they haven't grown
[55:36] up to begin to to realize to look in at
[55:39] the always look at yourselves first amen
[55:41] and Christians always look at themselves
[55:43] first amen that's what Christians do
[55:46] they don't try to blame somebody else
[55:49] Christians because they have a lamb
[55:52] nature they always look at themselves
[55:54] first amen if you'll never get anywhere
[55:58] with Christ if you're always blaming
[56:00] someone else
[56:01] amen you'll never get anywhere in your
[56:03] marriage if you're always blaming your
[56:05] spouse your marriage won't go anywhere
[56:07] amen if you're at your work and you're
[56:09] always blaming your boss your coworker
[56:11] you're never gonna go anywhere your work
[56:13] amen you never get anywhere by blaming
[56:16] somebody else why because you have to
[56:19] have the lamb nature to get anyway amen
[56:21] amen so when you see your children
[56:24] fighting your bickering well they just
[56:25] need to grow up a little bit there's
[56:27] still there's still there once they
[56:29] mature hopefully they'll grow out of
[56:30] that
[56:31] amen they have to receive the lamb
[56:33] nature they have to what do they have to
[56:35] do they have to lay down their life to
[56:39] receive the life that Christ is trying
[56:40] to give them a man so is the same thing
[56:43] in the church the church how does a
[56:45] church ever going to get anywhere
[56:46] because the church had Church can never
[56:49] get anywhere is when the church quits
[56:51] looking at everybody else amen look at
[56:54] yourselves as well I ran said you sweep
[56:57] your steps all sweep mind amen and
[56:59] that's the only way the church can get
[57:01] where is when we all become lambs and
[57:04] receive the lamb nature a man now the
[57:07] Holy Spirit is still here amen II still
[57:10] a dog he's just like when when the Holy
[57:13] Spirit or when the Dove left the ark it
[57:16] was looking for some place to put its
[57:17] foot looking for someone some place to
[57:19] land
[57:20] amen there was only one place in the
[57:22] earth for it they could land and I was
[57:24] on Noah's Ark now where can the Holy
[57:27] Spirit land today can he land upon the
[57:30] Kenny land in Las Vegas he can't land
[57:34] there can he can he land over in New
[57:37] Orleans no he can't land there no work
[57:40] where can the Holy Spirit land the whole
[57:42] earth has become wicked
[57:43] hey work we're just like in the days of
[57:46] Noah a man just like in the days of
[57:48] Sodom and Gomorrah the whole
[57:50] earth has become wicked but the Holy
[57:51] Spirit is still here he's trying to land
[57:53] somewhere where can heal and just like
[57:55] when Jesus was here on the earth he said
[57:57] the foxes have holes the birds have
[58:00] nests but the Son of man has no place to
[58:02] lay his head
[58:03] well the Holy Spirit the the the lamb is
[58:06] looking for some place to lay his head
[58:08] where the head stone has to come down
[58:10] and where can it come down it can only
[58:13] come down upon the Lamb nature amen it
[58:16] has Christ is looking for a place to lay
[58:19] his head stone right amen the the dove
[58:22] is looking for a place to land and when
[58:24] you receive the nature of the Lamb now
[58:27] you're a candidate for the Holy Spirit

[1:00:24] duty-bound to be able to testify that I
[1:00:27] am living the life of Christ amen amen
[1:00:37] a man just to tell upon myself again
[1:00:41] you know like early on in my marriage I
[1:00:43] know I've told this testimony before but
[1:00:44] you know I when my I hate to lose
[1:00:47] arguments you know and I always had you
[1:00:50] know certain things I had laid up
[1:00:52] beforehand so I would never lose an
[1:00:54] argument you know and if things got
[1:00:55] heated I could always you know find
[1:00:58] something that my wife had done wrong in
[1:00:59] the past then use it against her you
[1:01:01] know and so I always had these things
[1:01:03] lined up so if I ever got to the point
[1:01:04] that I was gonna lose an argument I
[1:01:07] could just pull from this and beat her
[1:01:09] over the head with it you know and it
[1:01:11] worked out for me but didn't work out so
[1:01:12] good for her that's not the Lamb nature
[1:01:16] hey man yo and when the Lord filled me
[1:01:19] with the Holy Ghost he started speaking
[1:01:21] to me and one day he said to me he said
[1:01:24] lay down all your ammunition aim and
[1:01:27] everything that you're using against
[1:01:29] your spouse I want you to lay it down
[1:01:31] and you know and I realized I had
[1:01:34] ammunition I had things that I was using
[1:01:36] against my wife that whenever the the
[1:01:38] battle got thick you know whenever the
[1:01:40] whenever the argument going that I could
[1:01:43] use I could pull this up out of history
[1:01:46] and use it against her and God spoke to
[1:01:49] me he said I want you to lay all that
[1:01:50] down and it was like well I was using
[1:01:53] that but I had to lay it down and I had
[1:01:56] to put it far as the East is from the
[1:01:59] West amen and you know since that our
[1:02:02] marriage has grown sweeter and sweeter
[1:02:04] and sweeter hey man no what caused it I
[1:02:07] took upon myself the nature of the Lamb
[1:02:10] I couldn't blame my wife for anything
[1:02:13] anymore I couldn't hold any things
[1:02:15] against her anymore
[1:02:17] think about it isn't that our dream that
[1:02:20] Christ wouldn't holy thing is to us
[1:02:22] isn't that our desire of our life is
[1:02:24] that Christ wouldn't hold anything
[1:02:26] against us wouldn't we love to get to
[1:02:28] heaven and walk before him and have him
[1:02:31] say well done my good and faithful
[1:02:32] servant and have him not even be able to
[1:02:35] remember anything we ever done wrong
[1:02:37] wouldn't that be a blessing wouldn't
[1:02:39] that be wonderful then we ought to take
[1:02:41] that same attitude towards our brothers
[1:02:43] and our sisters a meant that we can't
[1:02:46] remember the things that they've done
[1:02:47] wrong that we can forgive them just as
[1:02:50] much as Christ forgave us then we could
[1:02:53] take that same forgiveness and pass it
[1:02:55] on to others amen now you now you can
[1:02:58] forgive your spouse now you can free of
[1:03:00] your brother
[1:03:01] now you can forgive your sister and now
[1:03:03] you're not holding things against those
[1:03:05] that are around you amen
[1:03:08] what I would saw a lot of arguments
[1:03:10] wouldn't Amen when you when you no
[1:03:12] longer have anything to argue about
[1:03:14] well you're not holy thing in your
[1:03:16] memory where you're not trying to always
[1:03:19] hold store things up for the future and
[1:03:21] you just lay all that down now you have
[1:03:23] nothing what a place
[1:03:27] what a beautiful place you know it's
[1:03:28] going to be like that one of these dates
[1:03:29] we gotta be like that now amen
[1:03:32] to be the to be the bride of the Lamb in
[1:03:35] the Millennium right we have to be the
[1:03:38] bride here amen to be the bride in the
[1:03:41] future home we have to be the bride
[1:03:43] right now amen and the bride of what the
[1:03:46] bride of the lamb his the lamb is coming
[1:03:50] looking for a bride and he has to find
[1:03:52] someone with the same nature amen and
[1:03:54] that's nature has to be in you amen amen
[1:03:59] we got to be we gotta get you out become
[1:04:01] good at finding those things they're
[1:04:04] contrary to that lamb nature identifying
[1:04:07] those things within ourselves and
[1:04:09] getting rid of those things a man he's
[1:04:12] given us the ability to get rid of the
[1:04:13] way that that nature the nature of the
[1:04:16] wolf right amen so when in the nature of
[1:04:19] the wolf rises up within ourselves then
[1:04:21] we have to draw from the from his nature
[1:04:24] and say Lord I want that nature of the
[1:04:26] lame returned to me amen
[1:04:28] otherwise you know we'll remember Lambs
[1:04:31] meek lambs are gentle lambs are humble
[1:04:35] amen and when you have something that's
[1:04:37] not meek not gentle not humble then you
[1:04:41] have to go back and repent of those
[1:04:42] things and draw from the nature of the
[1:04:44] land
[1:04:45] amen if you're hoping to be the bride a
[1:04:48] man is like brother bran said there's a
[1:04:50] quote I camera exactly how it goes but
[1:04:52] he says they act like they don't want to
[1:04:54] be the Bride of Christ they act like
[1:04:58] they don't want to be the bride all
[1:05:00] right you know because there's a lot of
[1:05:02] people that call themselves to be
[1:05:03] Christians but they act like they're not
[1:05:06] acting like a lamb and they act like
[1:05:08] they don't want to be the Bride of
[1:05:10] Christ they're testifying against that
[1:05:12] are on their own confession they said
[1:05:14] they got baptized they said they would
[1:05:18] submit themselves to the lamb but then
[1:05:20] they in their actions they won't submit
[1:05:22] their selves to the lamb so they're
[1:05:24] testifying that they are not the Bride
[1:05:26] of Christ mine they're acting like they
[1:05:31] don't want to be the bride Amen well
[1:05:33] they gotta get delivered from that Amen
[1:05:36] remember this is the judgment time this
[1:05:38] is the time to judge ourselves if you
[1:05:40] will not judge yourself here how you
[1:05:42] ever make it up there
[1:05:44] ami I don't want to preach long tonight
[1:05:47] but anyway I just wanted to let's turn
[1:05:52] back over to Revelation so I want to
[1:05:54] read that one more time here in closing
[1:06:07] revelations chapter chapter seven
[1:06:15] sorry revelations chapter 21 verse seven
[1:06:18] it says he the overcometh shall inherit
[1:06:31] all things and I will be his God and he
[1:06:34] shall be my son but watch these watch
[1:06:36] these next two verses here it says but
[1:06:39] the fearful and unbelieving and
[1:06:40] abominable and murderers and
[1:06:42] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[1:06:45] and all liars which shall have their
[1:06:48] part in the lake which burns with fire
[1:06:50] and brimstone which is the second death
[1:06:52] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:06:55] angels which had the seven vials full
[1:06:56] the seven last plagues and talked with
[1:06:58] me saying come hither and I will show
[1:07:01] thee the bride the Lambs wife and he
[1:07:04] carried me away in the spirit and to a
[1:07:06] great in a high mountain and showed me
[1:07:09] that great city the holy Jerusalem
[1:07:10] descending out of God from heaven from
[1:07:13] God having the glory of God nice talking
[1:07:16] about us now right anyway he this is
[1:07:19] describing us having the glory of God
[1:07:22] and her light was under a stone most
[1:07:24] precious even as Jessop so clear as
[1:07:26] crystal and he goes through and he goes
[1:07:27] through when he describes this city now
[1:07:29] remember he's talking about us having
[1:07:32] the glory of God we got to in order to
[1:07:34] have the glory of God we got to be like
[1:07:35] the lamb first amen remember when you
[1:07:37] lay your life down a man it's just like
[1:07:40] when you if you want to buy something
[1:07:42] amen if you want to buy something and
[1:07:44] you hand over your money amen what now
[1:07:47] remember you know just about anybody if
[1:07:49] you would love to have ten thousand
[1:07:50] dollars right you know if the Sun has
[1:07:53] caught you on the street and to give you
[1:07:54] ten thousand dollars you'd love to have
[1:07:56] that why would you love to have it it's
[1:07:58] not that it's not the paper of the money
[1:08:00] that gives us joy it's not been Benjamin
[1:08:03] Franklin's face that brings us joy it's
[1:08:06] not the something special about the
[1:08:07] number one hundredths on the hundred
[1:08:09] dollar bill that we like about it but
[1:08:11] it's the it's the fact that we can
[1:08:13] purchase anything that we desire with
[1:08:16] that right when you have ten thousand
[1:08:18] dollars you can go to just
[1:08:20] any store in the town and if yours
[1:08:22] whatever was inside that store if you
[1:08:24] want it you could put that money down
[1:08:25] upon it and you could give up the money
[1:08:28] that brought you that joy for what you
[1:08:32] could get out of it right amen and so
[1:08:35] what is it so Christ lay down his life
[1:08:37] for us we give up our lives what do we
[1:08:40] get why we give up our lives for Christ
[1:08:42] why do we get baptized because we're
[1:08:45] giving up our life why so we can receive
[1:08:47] the promise of Christ amen we lay our
[1:08:50] lives down we receive the Lamb nature so
[1:08:53] we can receive his nature
[1:08:55] amen amen
[1:08:58] the Dove just you know I don't probably
[1:09:00] remembers the testimony that of brother
[1:09:03] Dawson Riley he said that he was talking
[1:09:09] with brother Branham once and brother
[1:09:10] Branham told him he says you know the
[1:09:12] Holy Spirit's like a duck and when you
[1:09:14] do something wrong the Holy Spirit takes
[1:09:17] his flight and goes and sits upon the on
[1:09:19] the pond the branch and he is just
[1:09:21] waiting for you to make it right so he
[1:09:25] can fly back amen
[1:09:27] and brother Dawson says I was telling
[1:09:30] that story to my dad and and he says as
[1:09:33] I was telling this story he said you
[1:09:35] know brother bran told me it's just like
[1:09:37] this that when you we do something wrong
[1:09:39] that the Holy Spirit's like a dove they
[1:09:40] he takes his flight and flies up the
[1:09:42] rent and as he was telling the story he
[1:09:44] said a dove came and flew up and landed
[1:09:46] on his shoulder and they all suddenly
[1:09:49] died he yes he is telling a story the
[1:09:51] Dove took off and went and landed on a
[1:09:53] branch and did that three times and his
[1:09:57] dad says what's going on he says is that
[1:10:00] yours he says no I never seen that
[1:10:02] before and he say and he does he
[1:10:05] finished the story of relating what
[1:10:07] brother Bennett said to him he said
[1:10:08] years later his dad was talking to him
[1:10:10] he said do you remember that time when
[1:10:13] we were talking about that Dove and that
[1:10:16] where that Dove came down and he says
[1:10:18] dad I think about that every day you
[1:10:21] know and there was something about that
[1:10:22] story the brother brand gave it to
[1:10:24] Roller Dawson Riley and as he was
[1:10:26] telling the story it repeated over again
[1:10:29] I mean there is something to that story
[1:10:31] remember now you can even be filled
[1:10:33] the Holy Ghost and you're all the way
[1:10:35] down your soul but when you do something
[1:10:37] you lose all the benefits of the Holy
[1:10:41] Spirit in your life why because you know
[1:10:43] you remember we're suppose to have the
[1:10:44] Holy Spirit what and our soul and in our
[1:10:47] spirit and on our flesh right all three
[1:10:50] you're supposed to be filled with the
[1:10:52] Holy Ghost filled you know they're
[1:10:55] supposed to be baptized immersed
[1:10:57] completely immersed a man when you're
[1:10:59] immersed in something what do you you go
[1:11:01] down into it and you lose all power over
[1:11:04] yourself because you're immersed in it
[1:11:06] and you've come up out of it
[1:11:08] amen you're immersed in it amen so I'll
[1:11:10] see you in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] fill with the Holy Ghost as he leads us
[1:11:15] amen but when you go and you do
[1:11:17] something wrong now you still have him
[1:11:20] deep down on the inside in your soul you
[1:11:23] is your faith or unbelief that faith is
[1:11:26] still there that wasn't so but you lose
[1:11:28] all the benefits of him upon your flesh
[1:11:30] and upon your spirit what he takes his
[1:11:33] flight he's sitting up and they're
[1:11:34] waiting for you to make it right and
[1:11:36] when you make it right when you confess
[1:11:38] your sins it was he do he washes you he
[1:11:42] is faithful to forgive you then the Holy
[1:11:44] Spirit can come down and now you have
[1:11:47] the benefits of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:11:50] life again a man who would love to have
[1:11:52] the Holy Ghost with you they're leading
[1:11:54] you every day
[1:11:55] oh my you know you know yea though I
[1:11:57] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:11:58] death thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:12:01] staff they comfort me
[1:12:03] amen amen as the Lord told brother
[1:12:07] Brandon says don't you fear to go
[1:12:08] anywhere or do anything for the
[1:12:10] never-failing presence of Lord Jesus
[1:12:12] Christ will be with you everywhere you
[1:12:13] go hey man that's not just for him
[1:12:16] that's for you a man this this pillar of
[1:12:18] fire is not just for brother Branham
[1:12:20] Amen that pillar of fire he is the
[1:12:23] firstfruits of that amen that pillar of
[1:12:25] fire is he as question his answers of
[1:12:28] someone asks brother BAM what is that
[1:12:30] pillar of fire that follows you around
[1:12:32] brother Ram answer he says it's God it's
[1:12:36] the Holy Ghost not just for me but for
[1:12:39] every true believer amen they'll submit
[1:12:42] themselves to Jesus Christ amen that
[1:12:45] pillar of fire is still here it was
[1:12:47] on the day of pentecost amen amen the
[1:12:49] same the same pillar fire the descent
[1:12:52] upon Jesus Christ amen is the same
[1:12:54] clarifier this split self up on the day
[1:12:57] of Pentecost that same clarifier is here
[1:12:59] to lead you day by day if you have the
[1:13:02] Lamb nature amen won't you receive him
[1:13:06] amen day by day make it right confess
[1:13:09] repent amen so why so the nature of the
[1:13:12] lamb can lead you
[1:13:14] amen unless if we don't have that nature
[1:13:16] we're not going anywhere
[1:13:18] amen you think about men and women
[1:13:21] whilst all their Christian walk for
[1:13:24] years and years and years and the whole
[1:13:27] time the Holy Spirit is just waiting
[1:13:29] there for you to make it right and when
[1:13:35] you get to heaven think about think
[1:13:37] about having wasted God gives you what
[1:13:39] 40 years 50 years 60 years 70 years upon
[1:13:42] this upon this look on this earth and
[1:13:45] you get to heaven and how many years of
[1:13:48] your Christian life did you waste while
[1:13:51] the Holy Spirit was sitting on the
[1:13:52] branch waiting for you to make it right
[1:13:55] so he could lead you all over again
[1:13:58] amen does as jesus said don't you know I

[1:16:31] you are not sorry for your sins then you
[1:16:35] got to cry out for God for repentance
[1:16:36] and that may be per chance that he might
[1:16:39] allow you to come back to repentance
[1:16:42] amen because we can't make ourselves
[1:16:44] sorry amen that's a gift that is a gift
[1:16:49] sorrow godly sorrow over your sins as a
[1:16:53] gift and if you lose that godly sorrow
[1:16:56] because you go wrong day after day after
[1:16:59] day against what the leadership the Holy
[1:17:01] Ghost is uuuugh sear your conscience
[1:17:04] with a hot iron
[1:17:05] amen and then how can you ever come back
[1:17:08] to repentance it will take a gift of God
[1:17:11] to bring you back to that
[1:17:12] amen but if you but if you humble
[1:17:14] yourself and you repent God is faithful
[1:17:18] Amen was he doing he first brings you
[1:17:20] back to that sorrow Amen he has the
[1:17:23] first step
[1:17:23] he has to bring you back to being sorry
[1:17:25] for your sins if you don't have that
[1:17:27] sorrow you got to cry out for it
[1:17:29] amen gumpa see brother if you'd come so
[1:17:58] we're gonna have to do it another
[1:18:00] service my apology toward you but I
[1:18:03] hadn't heard brother Troy preach in a
[1:18:05] while and I had to make the choice
[1:18:07] either go get the bread of mr. preaching
[1:18:09] so I determined I was going hear the
[1:18:11] preaching because we could always do
[1:18:13] communion of another day but we
[1:18:16] appreciate the Word of God I was a
[1:18:17] blessing to us and then trying to keep
[1:18:20] and keeping that lamb nature and when we
[1:18:23] see that lamb nature get away from us we
[1:18:25] need to cry out for repentance
[1:18:27] because that's the only way you climb
[1:18:29] the stair like I try to tell people I
[1:18:32] said we got to understand that Jacob's
[1:18:33] Ladder is a yielding you know I mean
[1:18:36] anytime you have to climb something it's
[1:18:39] a work to you know you don't climb
[1:18:41] stairs like like you know like you
[1:18:43] flying you know it takes a little more
[1:18:46] more energy going up and down so we
[1:18:49] thank God for the victory I was thinking
[1:18:52] about when he was preaching how brother
[1:18:54] branham you know when he lied to the
[1:18:56] there was the the the tax rataxes
[1:19:01] yeah people and you know told his wife
[1:19:03] say tell him tell him I'm not here and
[1:19:06] sure enough she said brother bill bill
[1:19:09] you that wasn't quite right was it and
[1:19:11] then the phone rang and he had to pray
[1:19:13] for someone he couldn't pray for that
[1:19:15] baby
[1:19:16] matter of fact that the Holy Spirit call
[1:19:19] him a hypocrite say you hypocrite right
[1:19:24] so he had to go make things
[1:19:26] before he could preach before he could
[1:19:29] pray for the baby that's what I brother
[1:19:32] the Lord was speaking tonight you know
[1:19:34] when sin is there it doesn't take the
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost from because the prophet of
[1:19:38] God had the Holy Ghost in his soul but
[1:19:41] the Holy Spirit moved right over here
[1:19:42] and he lost the benefits see that's when
[1:19:46] we become powerless not that we don't
[1:19:48] have power inside but we lose the
[1:19:51] benefits of praying and doing the things
[1:19:53] that we normally would do because we
[1:19:56] need to make things right and as soon as
[1:19:59] we repent and get things right with God
[1:20:01] the nature of God comes back on us and
[1:20:04] then you know all the benefits come with
[1:20:06] the return of the Holy Spirit that was a
[1:20:09] powerful
[1:20:10] I mean I've I got a lot of notes in my
[1:20:12] mind then one time I preached on the
[1:20:15] Lamb's Book of Life but now I got some
[1:20:17] extra stuff huh brother joy no we win
[1:20:21] once it's out it's no longer here so we
[1:20:25] paint pop oh it's great stay with me
[1:20:26] whenever preacher comment some good
[1:20:28] stuff come there's no longer his you
[1:20:30] know but we appreciate the Lord we
[1:20:32] appreciate your coming and my apology
[1:20:34] once again that because we wouldn't want
[1:20:37] people having communion
[1:20:38] it was my fault I've been so busy so
[1:20:41] many things in my head going on and it
[1:20:45] just slipped up on me so we thank you
[1:20:56] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[1:21:02] saved a wretch like me

[1:21:55] and seek our case praise has brought me
[1:22:09] safe thus far and grace will lead me
