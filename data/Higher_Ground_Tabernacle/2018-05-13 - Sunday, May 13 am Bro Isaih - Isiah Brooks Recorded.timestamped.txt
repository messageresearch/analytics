[0:00] he set up you know I can't be late we
[0:03] don't want you to feel that way it's not
[0:05] our intent that is not not even God but
[0:09] we want to thank God for all of you we'd
[0:12] rather you be late coming in than not
[0:14] coming off so we want to make sure that
[0:16] you understand that you love the Lord
[0:19] we appreciate once again brother Frank
[0:24] will be doing song service or learning
[0:27] he used to do it over there in the kola'
[0:33] Congo and wherever he else he was but
[0:36] anyway I told him I warned him not only
[0:39] just the singling English songs but I
[0:41] want him to also do some French songs so
[0:43] everybody could be more involved amen
[0:46] y'all need to learn some English and we
[0:48] need to learn some French amen so we
[0:50] appreciate everything and and so he was
[0:53] happy and by God's grace we'll try them
[0:58] out this evening Lord's will I am I
[1:02] think brother for the Isaac ask for the
[1:06] rich and I sold brother had already
[1:08] talked with the brother as a brother
[1:10] ritual mine so I know him that much I
[1:16] know you feel like a burden off his back
[1:18] so amen we love the Lord amen when you
[1:23] see talent or gifts we need to use it
[1:26] amen and the brothers come in and humbly
[1:29] sit there and you know the only person
[1:33] I've never heard seeing his brother my
[1:34] sister are fuzzy I don't even know where
[1:39] she can sing or not we got to find that
[1:40] out she sits there quietly comes in like
[1:43] that no a member we love the Lord we
[1:45] love the people of God amen in moments
[1:51] like these when I brother said today
[1:54] about Cyrus he was a great man our
[2:00] anointed him make sure Israel went back
[2:04] home and just as God has anointed Cyrus
[2:09] it is true I don't believe God would
[2:12] allow Trump's face to be on a call
[2:14] if he wasn't being anointed by God to do
[2:18] what he's doing when it comes to Israel
[2:21] now we may not agree with everything
[2:24] that he's doing because I don't but at
[2:27] the same time God has him dead and we
[2:31] must respect and honor the office and I
[2:34] am truly excited about this time I'm
[2:40] almost like a mother about ready to give
[2:42] birth she's excited but she's afraid to
[2:46] you know there's something in her that
[2:48] makes her excited but she's a nervous
[2:50] too because she's never especially the
[2:52] first-time mothers you've not been there
[2:54] before and so I know everything is
[2:58] getting ready to really move in a fast
[3:00] way we see seven ballot and everybody
[3:03] else over there in Israel trying to stop
[3:05] this thing from happening but they can't
[3:07] stop it because this is the hand of God
[3:11] we see you know a lot of people don't
[3:15] may not even think about it but I want
[3:17] just to make put it in your mind that
[3:19] this volcano over there in Hawaii is not
[3:22] just trying to display so itself so you
[3:25] can see the wonderful works of nature
[3:27] but you must understand that they're
[3:29] undercurrents things that God is moving
[3:31] and pushing and setting in order because
[3:34] we know by God's grace the prophecy is
[3:37] that California will have this major
[3:39] earthquake and you got to understand the
[3:42] the default that's on Washington State
[3:45] over there they said it's just like the
[3:47] one that was brought that great tsunami
[3:52] to Japan so we know by God's grace is
[3:55] locked and ready and we just need our
[3:58] sense you know God he's waiting on us we
[4:02] said Oh Lord I'm waiting on you no no no
[4:03] no no God is waiting on us because the
[4:07] Bible said the bride made herself ready
[4:11] right so you and I must understand and
[4:14] and I'm not trying to put fear I'm
[4:17] trying to place excitement you know
[4:20] because God said you know in that day
[4:23] that you when you when you see that they
[4:25] approach and you need to come together
[4:26] the more
[4:28] I know that many people are cutting out
[4:29] the evening service on Sundays I can't
[4:31] do it and my thing is if it's only one
[4:34] or two people coming on evening we'll
[4:36] just have to come one or two you know
[4:39] because I believe that we ought to come
[4:41] together the more I don't know about you
[4:44] but I need more word I need more
[4:46] encouragement I need I need more that
[4:49] now than ever before and I don't want
[4:52] the enemy to get me in a place where I
[4:56] feel and you know how it is we all know
[4:59] that it is election but I don't ever
[5:01] want the devil to really doe that in my
[5:04] senses I'm elected I got it all made and
[5:09] I'm gonna make a rapture the Bible says
[5:12] you must be on fire and I believe that's
[5:16] the way we're going to be I appreciate
[5:19] the message absolute it was wonderful
[5:21] and our brother sent that to me it was
[5:24] really good to me I'm still listening to
[5:27] it because I believe that this message
[5:29] is our absolute and therefore we we we
[5:33] don't have to worry about anything
[5:38] because God has made himself known to us
[5:41] let's stand so I can get right into the
[5:44] Word of God
[5:44] last week we we started on the union
[5:49] with God and His creation started that
[5:52] on Wednesday we want to pick it up again
[5:54] today - this morning - to just really
[5:57] try to get to you the the the thought or
[6:00] the revelation or really what God is
[6:03] doing in our day in the midst of mystery
[6:06] of God revealed brother Branham tells us
[6:08] that that everything that he was
[6:09] preaching in that particular message is
[6:11] like it's like the capstone of it all
[6:14] the whole Bible this whole Bible
[6:17] declares Jesus Christ and he said that
[6:20] if you can read this Bible and not see
[6:23] Christ he said you got a you got to read
[6:26] it over again and so we we thank God for
[6:30] a messenger in this day we're not a
[6:33] worshipper of him we don't set his image
[6:37] before us we don't bow down to him
[6:39] because he did not reflect his image
[6:41] he reflected the image of Jesus Christ
[6:43] and that is the Lord God that we serve
[6:47] this morning and as Paul said I am the
[6:51] hallelujah oh I feel pretty good this
[6:54] morning I am not ashamed of the gospel
[6:57] of Christ I'm sorry that was another
[7:01] kind of eruption
[7:02] oh I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[7:06] Christ it is the power of God unto
[7:09] salvation let us turn to Deuteronomy 31
[7:19] and 3 surely God is good to us in how
[7:34] can you stop praising God when he's been
[7:38] so good to you he's been better to us
[7:42] and we've been to ourselves Deuteronomy
[7:48] 31 and 6 be strong and of a good courage
[7:55] fear not not be afraid of them for the
[8:02] Lord thy God he it is that doth do go
[8:06] with thee he will not fail thee well I
[8:11] love that nor forsake thee is that
[8:16] Alright st. John 14
[8:34] 17 through 21 17 through 21 even the
[8:41] Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[8:45] receive because it seeth him not neither
[8:49] knoweth him but you know him well he
[8:54] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[8:59] will not leave you comfortless I will
[9:04] come to you right let me go hit on down
[9:11] yet a little while the world seeth me no
[9:15] more but ye shall see me because I live
[9:19] you shall live also at that day you
[9:25] shall know that I am in the father ye
[9:29] and me and I in you that is so powerful
[9:34] let us pray father we thank you for your
[9:38] grace we thank you for your mercy Lord
[9:43] we pray this morning that you would have
[9:49] preeminence in the service Lord we want
[9:53] you to be everything to us we want you
[9:58] to be our judge we want you to be our
[10:02] friend correct us love us whatever we
[10:10] need Lord each and every one of us have
[10:12] different needs this morning whatever we
[10:14] need to take another step forward help
[10:18] us dear Jesus forgive us Lord of any and
[10:22] everything we've done wrong that your
[10:25] name may be glorified in Jesus Christ's
[10:28] name we pray amen
[10:29] you may be seated he that he hath my
[10:34] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[10:37] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[10:40] shall be loved of my father and I will
[10:44] love him and this is where I met
[10:47] and will manifest myself to him and I
[10:52] believe by God's grace that we're living
[10:54] in the age and a day that it is God's
[11:01] timing to manifest himself to us we have
[11:09] seen a lot of things especially in this
[11:12] message we have seen all kinds of
[11:15] doctrines come and go we've seen me and
[11:19] rise and we've seen them fall but the
[11:24] thing that we need to see more than
[11:26] anything is Jesus himself not in another
[11:31] man or another woman but we need to see
[11:34] Jesus in us Lord I want to see Jesus in
[11:37] me you know because that is the witness
[11:40] that is your absolute many people read
[11:45] this Bible many people read the message
[11:48] books and yet they have never seen it in
[11:52] them they've seen him in the prophet
[11:55] they've seen him in other places amen
[11:58] but the important part today is to see
[12:00] him in you not in your head cause even
[12:05] the devil knows the message in his head
[12:08] but when Christ is in your heart he has
[12:13] to live is that right oh you and I must
[12:17] understand there's so many people and
[12:19] and as we were expressing on Wednesday
[12:22] how God is seen in everything the Bible
[12:25] said the earth declares his glory the
[12:28] heavens his handiwork hallelujah there
[12:30] is no way of getting away from him he is
[12:33] in you above you with you around you
[12:39] he's everywhere so that you can
[12:42] understand brother banner tells us that
[12:45] before God was God he was just God hello
[12:49] him lol I Elohim the very self existing
[12:54] one hallelujah
[12:56] don't you understand that before God
[12:58] before there was air
[13:00] God had to make the end hallelujah God
[13:04] don't have to live off and God is God he
[13:08] is the word and so before they were air
[13:11] before they were anything that could
[13:13] sustain life in his natural forces
[13:16] elements God created it all is that all
[13:22] right so you understand Amen that even
[13:25] as David said lord if I make my bed in
[13:28] hell die out there hallelujah if I fly
[13:31] to the almost party earth there's no
[13:34] escaping you Lord because thou are there
[13:37] hallelujah and then we find out through
[13:40] this message Amen that we understand
[13:42] that God is omniscient that means that
[13:45] he's everywhere
[13:46] hallelujah not by him by just being here
[13:50] and then here and there but we found out
[13:53] that we had a man of God that could tell
[13:55] us because God knows everything
[13:58] he's everywhere hallelujah
[14:02] I never understood it hey man how God
[14:05] could break himself up into pieces and
[14:08] still be God hallelujah Amen never
[14:12] losing one counts of his power or his
[14:15] authority hallelujah oh but I hear by
[14:18] God's grace that a brother came and he's
[14:19] preached on the seed and I thought about
[14:21] that seed I said can you imagine a
[14:24] country hallelujah Amen or mustard seed
[14:28] one of the smallest seeds never imagined
[14:31] that it could produce a tree as large as
[14:33] it grown hallelujah so in in that
[14:36] scenario I want you to see by God's
[14:39] grace you and I Paul said heís that
[14:41] without seen nor ear have heard
[14:43] hallelujah what God Hanson's or ended
[14:47] into the hearts of man what God has in
[14:50] store for us
[14:51] hallelujah all we talk about all when I
[14:53] get there I have a glorified body we
[14:56] don't even know what it is
[14:57] hallelujah we talked about all mind at
[15:00] the alphadon
[15:00] we don't know what it is hallelujah but
[15:03] all when it happens somebody help me
[15:06] here somebody help me you see because
[15:08] all those things that we can't see
[15:11] clearly
[15:14] will be made clear to us hallelujah
[15:17] there will be nothing that you won't
[15:20] know oh you tell me said Brotherhood's
[15:22] what are you saying
[15:23] because even jesus told his disciples
[15:25] you know all things is that okay I'm
[15:32] talking about blending and you know when
[15:36] Jesus stood there and Saint John 10 and
[15:39] 30 I love that scripture where he says I
[15:41] and my father are one
[15:44] hallelujah and did you not know that the
[15:48] persecution really didn't come until
[15:50] Jesus declared that he and his father
[15:53] was one the Bible said they wanted to
[15:55] stone him for it he said watch domine
[15:59] why you seek to stone me he said because
[16:01] you were being a man trying to make
[16:03] yourself God hallelujah
[16:06] but brother Brennan said what it was it
[16:08] wasn't that he was being a man trying to
[16:09] make it look God it was God making
[16:11] himself a man hallelujah
[16:14] and now we see in the series very same
[16:17] word God is doing a new creation so
[16:21] that's what we must understand we are a
[16:23] new creation as long as the delicate
[16:27] make you feel like you are parents job
[16:29] job best the way you're going to feel
[16:32] hallelujah but if you have met Jesus on
[16:35] the backside of the desert if you have
[16:37] met him in your private secret room
[16:39] whatever Amen you met him you met him
[16:42] hallelujah you have been changed
[16:45] somebody help me
[16:46] you have been changed from death unto
[16:48] life you're not a pastor job you are new
[16:52] creature is that right even closer it
[16:56] does not yet appear what we gonna be
[17:00] like but one thing for sure we'll be
[17:03] just like him I want you to think about
[17:06] that for a moment think about there for
[17:09] a moment just like God whew somebody
[17:15] helped me standing at the door and knock
[17:18] in 1957 he says when Christ was on earth
[17:22] in a physical corporal body as we stand
[17:25] today he walked in Galilee
[17:27] and different places there he claimed
[17:30] not to have power to heal the sick or to
[17:33] perform miracles he said I can do
[17:36] nothing in myself I do nothing till
[17:39] first the father showed me and what to
[17:42] do anyone knows the scripture st. John 5
[17:45] knows that's the truth he did not
[17:48] perform any miracles until the father
[17:50] showed him he said verily verily I say
[17:53] unto you the son himself the tabernacle
[17:57] the God dwell in him his body the son
[18:00] can do nothing in himself but what he
[18:03] sees the father doing that doeth the son
[18:06] likewise hallelujah even though we
[18:10] become in the image of lightening of God
[18:12] we still have a head hallelujah and that
[18:17] hand ship is Jesus Christ himself
[18:19] is that right a man you can't just say
[18:23] well I got it and I'm gonna just do what
[18:25] I want to do hallelujah that's not the
[18:27] way it worked
[18:28] hallelujah remember I preached about the
[18:30] will and I showed you Amen that was the
[18:33] very thing that Lucifer did when he
[18:35] adopted his own will that's when he
[18:38] pushed and moved himself out of the out
[18:41] of God's will because you cannot serve
[18:44] God by your will it's not him that will
[18:47] it no he that run it but it's God who
[18:50] shows mercy so you can't just will it
[18:55] accept God allow you to will it and gave
[18:57] you the wheel to will it
[18:59] hallelujah now some of y'all looking at
[19:02] me like y'all sick this morning I hope
[19:07] you're alright we'll be praying for you
[19:09] but you know we look at this thing and
[19:12] wish you all brother whoops are you in
[19:13] your right mind I hope I'm not I don't
[19:18] want to be in my right mind I want to be
[19:20] in his mind
[19:22] man what is it we're coming I don't you
[19:24] see in your right mind you can't in your
[19:26] right mind
[19:27] you can't imagine becoming God or even a
[19:30] part of God
[19:31] although the peace of God you can't even
[19:33] imagine it cuz you know every piece and
[19:35] every part of God is perfect how they
[19:39] knew yet there's no imperfection inning
[19:41] hallelujah
[19:42] so you and I can't even imagine what
[19:44] imperfection of perfection is because
[19:46] all our lives we've seen imperfection we
[19:49] don't even fully understand grace
[19:50] because grace is when you don't have to
[19:53] do nothing to get something and in this
[19:55] world in order to guess something you
[19:57] got to work you got to do something here
[19:59] to get something there hallelujah but
[20:02] not when it comes to God Holly Lou is
[20:04] that right that's what the Bible says
[20:06] the gift of God is given to men without
[20:11] repentance you don't even have to be
[20:14] saved they have a gift from God
[20:16] he gave that to you as a token of his
[20:20] love before you even got into this world
[20:23] y'all hear what I'm saying
[20:25] she weak but with us in order for us to
[20:28] give a gift somebody has to behave well
[20:31] that's the way we're taught you be good
[20:34] I'll be good to you come on somebody but
[20:37] the Bible said in that while we were yet
[20:39] sinners Christ died for us
[20:41] hallelujah that's why we love this
[20:44] amazing grace hallelujah ain't God good
[20:55] to us
[20:56] hallelujah listen it is the only ground
[20:59] we could have fellowship because
[21:01] remember when I loose affirm I you know
[21:05] I really don't like calling Lucifer that
[21:07] old devil when that old devil amen found
[21:10] his own will and you know this is the
[21:12] part I was talking to a brother about I
[21:13] said Jesus God saw the will of Lucifer
[21:17] and still allowed him to preach knowing
[21:21] he was going to preach his own doctrine
[21:25] hallelujah and God allowed him to preach
[21:28] his own doctrine we don't know how I'm
[21:31] alone but a third of how many more Amen
[21:34] was
[21:35] literally taken by Lucifer's doctrine
[21:39] dangers failed angels develop their own
[21:45] will and made that will against God's
[21:48] will like Lucifer and what the Lucifer
[21:52] promised them fame popularity
[21:58] hallelujah and that's exactly what the
[22:01] devil does he promise you something huh
[22:04] y'all don't believe it he told Eve you
[22:07] gonna be let you gonna be as God and is
[22:10] she not the woman is worship everywhere
[22:14] you go in the world she's worship like I
[22:17] said even when you're selling a bad a
[22:19] truck she's the one standing on the side
[22:21] of it hallelujah is that right you're
[22:27] never gonna see Amen a man named his
[22:30] truck after another man he's gonna name
[22:42] that truck Suzie a Bessie or something
[22:44] but he'll never name that truck dawn or
[22:49] Michael she's worship why because it's a
[22:54] male/female thing well somebody help me
[22:57] that's what it was in the beginning God
[23:01] had a feminine attribute in him
[23:03] hallelujah and he needed to express that
[23:07] ah my god think about it God even in his
[23:12] own mind thought we know one day I'm
[23:13] gonna have me a wedding somebody help me
[23:19] I'm gonna have me a wedding and I'm
[23:21] gonna have me a bride hallelujah and
[23:23] we're gonna be united as one this
[23:26] wedding that I have is going to be
[23:28] perfect everything I know she like will
[23:32] be there hallelujah every color every
[23:35] fragrant everyone everything hallelujah
[23:39] in other words I'm the one that's
[23:41] coordinating the whole thing yeah that
[23:46] one is important
[23:49] man when he was in Adam all she knew was
[23:52] Adam it was after God separate her that
[23:57] Satan was able to seduce her to think in
[24:01] her own mind as you heard me say there
[24:05] was a time where her mind was his mind
[24:08] was God's mind and her mind was Adams
[24:10] mind and they all thought the same thing
[24:13] that God's Word is God's Word and
[24:17] whatever God said we're going to do
[24:19] hallelujah and tada no slicker who all
[24:22] had already practice and heaven right he
[24:26] slid it all around there and then began
[24:28] to tell her you know what you can be an
[24:30] independent woman I'm sorry I don't want
[24:33] to be an independent woman uh-huh
[24:36] come on when it comes to God I want God
[24:39] to be my head Alleluia
[24:42] all right now and it is the only grounds
[24:46] of fellowship because you got to
[24:48] understand that's how it started in the
[24:49] beginning and that's the way it must end
[24:52] hallelujah now we look at this thing
[24:55] that says it's a new creature you are a
[24:57] new creature in Christ what we fail to
[25:00] see is that we look at this over old
[25:02] thing and you know we think well that's
[25:03] me this is not me
[25:06] this is dead it's been judged hallelujah
[25:11] it's gonna is going to dissolve it's
[25:15] gonna break down somebody help me but
[25:19] while this thing is breaking down I'm
[25:21] still living everybody in this in this
[25:25] place we know don't we know don't we
[25:27] know that no matter how old you get yo
[25:31] your inside is still young that's how I
[25:34] hurt my knee
[25:35] I forgot momentarily I'm not as young as
[25:42] I used to be right and you say what what
[25:45] brothers what are you trying to say
[25:46] because that part of you will never grow
[25:50] Oh hallelujah
[25:55] is that all right now we you and I must
[25:58] understand so I'm glad about it brother
[26:00] brother rich and brother you know
[26:02] brother Keith and and and and Mike and
[26:05] all of you I am so happy one of the
[26:09] things I'm happy about Amen because I'm
[26:11] looking at a Ararat a union that is now
[26:14] changing me not you may not see it like
[26:19] I may not see it happening in you but
[26:21] it's literally happening
[26:23] I'm literally turning Amen from Mortal
[26:27] to immortality is that right brother
[26:31] branham said that when when God gave
[26:33] that promised to Abraham and Sarah it
[26:36] was like a process it was a process
[26:40] happening so he allowed us to see that
[26:42] this eternal life is a process
[26:44] hallelujah
[26:46] the last thing to be changed in you is
[26:48] this but your character your life your
[26:53] strain hallelujah even if it's just
[26:55] changes law into law into Christ brother
[26:59] madam senator like this he said that
[27:03] cosmic life the eternal light replaces
[27:07] the cosmic light and all of us were born
[27:10] with cosmic light hallelujah but this
[27:15] eternal light is now pushing that cosmic
[27:18] light out of your body and as it pushes
[27:23] the cosmic light out guess what happens
[27:25] you start seeing a change
[27:28] oh brother you looking younger thank you
[27:31] how do you you amen it comes with the
[27:34] salvation oh come on I'm telling you
[27:37] something so you can realize that man
[27:39] you can rebuke start rebuking his old
[27:41] age spirit hallelujah amen God God know
[27:49] what I'm saying God know what I'm trying
[27:51] to tell you this Union this union is so
[27:54] powerful what I was thinking you know it
[27:57] is a oneness of himself in the people
[27:59] you see because it's not you it's not
[28:01] you that can do this it's God at some
[28:03] point this generation that we're now
[28:06] living in will change from old to young
[28:10] and it doesn't say Amen at what point in
[28:14] time a bruh
[28:16] and Sarah turned back to the young it
[28:19] doesn't say it gave him a promise but
[28:22] that portion of the scripture is silent
[28:24] but we do know one thing when she got
[28:28] down there to that King he had turned
[28:31] and so did she
[28:33] right so it wasn't their doing it was
[28:38] God's doing but one thing for certain it
[28:41] was recognizable Abraham could see that
[28:46] Sarah had changed hallelujah and Sarah
[28:50] could see that Abraham had changed oh
[28:55] don't get don't get be too concerned my
[28:58] thing is this brother Branham said it
[29:01] like this he said it might cause
[29:04] persecution to bring us to that place he
[29:11] said but in other words God's gonna
[29:13] allow it to happen
[29:15] y'all you understand me see this is
[29:18] what's happening now the real trial of
[29:20] this message is now
[29:23] sifting and sifting out and and
[29:27] literally it's separating everything
[29:30] that is not hallelujah y'all hear me
[29:36] that's what's happening so what I'm
[29:39] trying to tell you is that you gotta
[29:40] fight don't let the devil make you turn
[29:44] your back on this truth because that's
[29:48] his job the Deaf age is walking and he
[29:51] looking to see who got it who's dumb who
[29:53] don't who doesn't now you said what do
[29:57] you mean I mean that's a cold eye I have
[29:59] it somewhere where he's we working with
[30:02] a time and you know it's harder how many
[30:05] y'all can say it's difficult it is it's
[30:08] difficult to pray it's difficult to fast
[30:10] it's difficult to read your word
[30:12] hallelujah it is difficult to show
[30:16] brotherly kindness hello it's difficult
[30:22] you see that the devil just coming in
[30:24] and attacking in every way what is he
[30:27] doing he's he couldn't he can't
[30:29] dude except God gave him grace to do it
[30:32] I say grace permission to do it and his
[30:35] permission
[30:36] is chipping everything all amen so that
[30:40] when God make his move he's got the real
[30:42] thing you see what I'm saying and when
[30:47] he's done this by this bride still will
[30:50] need a revival Oh somebody help me why
[30:55] because you know I am faulty but I am
[30:58] elected to be bride hallelujah
[31:04] I'm not where I used to be and that way
[31:09] I want to be I'm not in where I ought to
[31:11] be hallelujah but like I said but I'm
[31:14] not where you used to be so I know I
[31:16] traveled I know there is a change and I
[31:20] know my destiny is perfection so you got
[31:23] to know that no matter what you go
[31:27] through you must know your destiny is
[31:29] perfection not by him that will it nor
[31:34] he that run it but God that shows mercy
[31:37] you know what I'm gonna tell you
[31:39] something that's one of the hardest
[31:41] thing for us to fully understand is that
[31:43] God loves you and spider sometimes we
[31:52] things and and we preach things that we
[31:54] know that you know already and you know
[31:56] it's not against people it's not against
[31:58] any individual it's basically saying hey
[32:01] we know who you are you know you need to
[32:03] know who you are and this is not the way
[32:06] you should look this is not the way you
[32:09] should do hallelujah
[32:12] see because it's never you know we say
[32:14] touch not taste my hand or not that's
[32:16] not even that's garlic
[32:18] that ain't what God looking at it
[32:20] wouldn't be grace yeah hello it wouldn't
[32:27] even be grace if it was long hallelujah
[32:35] you say well what do you mean brother
[32:36] Brooks remember the preacher that died
[32:38] our drunkard brother branham said he was
[32:41] saying hallelujah the Prophet God said
[32:46] you can be insane and have the Holy
[32:49] Ghost and don't y'all feel like that
[32:51] sometime it's the truth because this is
[32:59] where your mind battle you battling
[33:01] right here but your absolute is right
[33:04] here when this fails you got something
[33:08] says I never leave your nor will I
[33:10] forsake you be not afraid
[33:17] hallelujah see you know how many of us
[33:26] we want to be one with him sometimes we
[33:31] have bad thoughts and we like lord
[33:33] it's that from my head of my heart
[33:37] anybody know what I'm talking about
[33:38] because you want to know where is this
[33:41] star coming from is it from my head or
[33:43] my heart even in my head lord help me if
[33:46] it's in my heart Lord take it away you
[33:51] wouldn't even be a true child of God if
[33:56] you didn't want that devil out of your
[33:58] life
[33:59] and that's what makes you know that
[34:01] you're different
[34:02] Devas love to be Devils yeah I'm I'm not
[34:08] ready to do I'm feeling very good this
[34:12] morning
[34:12] why because I see what he's doing one of
[34:16] these old days it's gonna happen in the
[34:18] twinkling of an eye and I be able to
[34:20] walk through the wall I'll be able to go
[34:23] through the ceiling what is it because
[34:26] God is all and in all
[34:28] he's everywhere you see all of these
[34:32] things right here you don't see it it
[34:33] looks solid but all these things are
[34:36] just molecules every every one of these
[34:39] things that you call solid can be moved
[34:45] through and there's a force they say
[34:50] it's called a wave that's holding
[34:54] everything together even your own body
[34:59] darling area you say that ain't true
[35:03] that's why brother Brown say that
[35:06] Kingdom will slow down and we'll speed
[35:09] up somebody help me because we see by
[35:18] God's grace amen that we have been what
[35:21] resurrected huh brother brought you
[35:23] you've been resurrected
[35:24] I've been resurrected hallelujah you
[35:28] have been resurrected hallelujah to do
[35:32] what died no more you love the Lord he
[35:40] said the only way that you could have
[35:41] those grounds is by Union to be united
[35:45] with him just like when you United with
[35:48] your husband the woman to unite with her
[35:50] husband and there's a vow unto death
[35:52] then when you are united with God it's
[35:55] the same thing that the church United
[35:58] with Christ why because God is Christ
[36:02] and Christ is God hallelujah
[36:09] I didn't say Jesus I said Christ is God
[36:13] because Christ gives the Holy Ghost
[36:16] Christ is the anointed Jesus was the
[36:22] blood sacrifice and in him dwelt the
[36:25] fullness of the Godhead bodily but a new
[36:28] person it was one in other words there
[36:31] was a union you said when did the Union
[36:35] take place when John said he saw a dove
[36:39] come down and lit upon him at the river
[36:43] of Jordan and the father said this is my
[36:47] beloved son and who I'm well pleased to
[36:51] dwell in well he was the word Moses was
[37:01] the word but Moses didn't become
[37:04] empowered until he met the purifier
[37:09] Jesus was born the word he was able to
[37:12] turn water into wine hallelujah
[37:16] but then when he got in there and the
[37:20] Holy Ghost came and filled him oh I know
[37:22] y'all don't know what I'm talking about
[37:23] some of y'all a ok talking yeah you got
[37:25] to speak the way the scripture says it
[37:26] the holy king goes came down and filled
[37:29] him and his father said this is my
[37:30] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[37:32] dwell in
[37:33] that's when man and God became one
[37:36] hallelujah then he goes into the into
[37:40] the UH into the wilderness and he
[37:41] suffers and he for forty days and after
[37:46] that his greatest challenge was Lucifer
[37:49] himself all right he comes along and he
[37:52] said I'd give you this if you turn this
[37:54] stone into bread
[37:55] oh my you don't think it was hungry he
[37:59] with the bottle said he was hungry was
[38:04] it God or the man that was hungry it was
[38:06] the man hallelujah
[38:09] but then he that same man said man does
[38:12] not live by bread alone but by every
[38:13] word that proceeds out of mouth of God
[38:15] hallelujah what was he saying
[38:18] yes it might be my will to eat this
[38:21] bread but I'm not living by my will I'm
[38:23] by his will and I can't do nothing
[38:28] except I see the father do it brother
[38:34] bream said when he took him up to that
[38:36] pinnacle up there says I give you
[38:37] America I give you Germany I give you
[38:39] all the cities of the world hallelujah
[38:42] if you just bow down hallelujah you say
[38:46] bow down to you huh uh-uh
[38:49] tell them get behind me you should
[38:53] worship the Lord thy God right in other
[38:56] words I'm your God you need to bow to me
[38:59] Oh hallelujah
[39:05] the prodigal said he knew it all of this
[39:09] one day we'll be here come do you really
[39:16] think God won't New York as it is thank
[39:19] you brother
[39:20] no I wouldn't want it I don't want
[39:26] California as it is I don't want Texas I
[39:30] don't want the morning Eddie as it is
[39:33] I'm because it's full of troubles
[39:36] full of violence but one of these old
[39:39] days
[39:41] because of his blending because of his
[39:44] union come on you said well what do you
[39:48] mean brother Brooks in the book of Acts
[39:50] about said all power in heaven and earth
[39:52] was given to who Jesus who the eternal
[39:59] God the creator of all things
[40:07] hallelujah then jesus said this same
[40:10] power after which the Holy Ghost is come
[40:13] upon you I'm gonna give you the same
[40:16] power not a different power that's why
[40:19] the proud of God expresses we must have
[40:21] the same results right if we got the
[40:25] same spirit it must be the same result
[40:29] in everything all lord have mercy upon
[40:33] us you love the Lord
[40:36] yes he said don't you see the great
[40:39] picture we in flesh are different we're
[40:42] like a byproduct a creative being by
[40:45] holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons
[40:49] and daughters not son some other spirit
[40:53] but the same spirit of the Living God
[40:57] because we become sons and daughters
[41:00] hallelujah now this part here is a
[41:03] byproduct but the Holy Ghost is the same
[41:07] spirit that's what he said that's the
[41:13] difference right we're just a byproduct
[41:16] here but the real thing that real thing
[41:20] only inside has United us with the
[41:22] eternal God proving that even when he
[41:25] was Ella him we were there even when he
[41:30] was Ella him we were there we were
[41:32] thoughts we were attributes hallelujah
[41:35] and we can eat that cannot change this
[41:40] is God's drama this is God's playing God
[41:43] created all things for his pleasure and
[41:46] his goodwill hallelujah it doesn't
[41:49] matter he could have made me a donkey
[41:51] and I still would have been satisfied he
[41:55] could have made me a frog like I said
[41:58] the other day frogs can't even sing the
[42:03] jingle stopped him from breathing their
[42:04] proper on they make all that noise cry
[42:11] because they're praising God for being a
[42:14] frog you listen to their toes Birds
[42:18] first always out there singing all the
[42:21] time amen it could have just stormed and
[42:25] everything is and the first thing you
[42:26] hear after storm is the sound of a bird
[42:28] I love that sound
[42:30] hallelujah the storm is passing no I
[42:35] could almost see him you know praising
[42:39] God because the storm is passed over
[42:41] hallelujah and they still surviving
[42:43] hallelujah
[42:45] cheak God put himself together
[42:48] yeah I mean he
[42:50] broke himself up and now he's bringing
[42:52] him back I love that I love that I love
[42:55] that amen because that's what he did he
[42:58] said brother what are you saying he took
[43:00] those 12 disciples broke that bread and
[43:02] then then when he broke that bread all
[43:04] up together he brought it all back in
[43:06] the upper room hallelujah
[43:08] what was it one loaf one bread one body
[43:11] hallelujah
[43:12] there are nothing struck them see that's
[43:18] why it's so important that we be unified
[43:20] and that's what sating is doing right
[43:22] now see you cannot be in you in God and
[43:25] yet be separate I'm from among each
[43:27] other you know God taught me something
[43:34] the last time we had a communion we had
[43:36] it in the morning will not do that ever
[43:38] again we're do it evening or night and
[43:45] my reason for doing that even though I
[43:47] may not see I said what is great your
[43:50] ceremony and that's what we don't all
[43:51] spoke to me doing this or loving her
[43:54] brother I'm not here to offend anyone
[43:58] Paul said if even eat meat with a fender
[44:02] brother he said I won't even eat no meat
[44:04] now for the older of us who love me you
[44:06] know that was a great sacrifice and I
[44:09] don't believe that Paul said that just
[44:10] to be religious he meant it and I saw to
[44:14] myself I said Lord my love was not and
[44:17] it's not and I was not at that time
[44:19] where it should have been hello
[44:25] the most important thing is communion is
[44:29] to bring us together not separate us is
[44:35] that right okay I had to confess that
[44:39] because he told me to there's not one
[44:42] person here I don't love and care about
[44:43] that's why sometimes I get on your
[44:46] nerves sometime I know what I'm striking
[44:51] something but one thing for certain you
[44:53] better know that everything I say is
[44:54] because I love and care for you I don't
[44:58] you know we don't have this big glorious
[45:00] church and that's fine because I read it
[45:03] this way you know if I
[45:04] in contact you know your spirit and work
[45:06] with you like that it's okay
[45:08] like Abraham if God has given me as a
[45:11] shepherd I don't believe in losing wine
[45:14] to the devil and understand that
[45:17] everything that I do is inspired because
[45:20] I love your soul I can see things you
[45:23] can't see but I'm and I'm not gonna let
[45:26] the devil just take you many times you
[45:29] don't see me but I'll be praying
[45:30] whenever God brings you to my heart I
[45:32] pray hallelujah all right I may not be
[45:37] one-to-one on you but I'm there praying
[45:39] for you and I hope by God's grace you're
[45:41] praying for me cuz I need your prayers I
[45:44] won't give up on no one you know and I
[45:48] look at this thing and I said I know
[45:50] many times people don't understand but I
[45:52] don't come to church to show off y'all
[45:54] understand me you may not believe this
[45:59] but by God's grace I really do believe
[46:02] if I wanted to be in the top ten I could
[46:04] be and I don't say that to brag but I
[46:10] don't try to show you how much knowledge
[46:13] I have that's not important
[46:15] the most important thing is to see that
[46:18] this church get the token and see it all
[46:22] on display that's it some of y'all I'm
[46:29] gonna tell you don't don't ever come in
[46:30] here but I know that and I know that and
[46:32] I know that see that's the devil talking
[46:33] to you because when you know that and
[46:36] know that and then that life is not
[46:38] being produced in what how much do you
[46:40] know my thing in my a man I'm off my
[46:44] scripture my thing in my aim is to bring
[46:46] us in such a union with God that we can
[46:49] feel it we can know it right you don't
[46:52] need y'all y'all how many husbands and
[46:54] wives you live so well together
[46:55] so you think alike sometimes you come up
[47:00] with the same words at the same time
[47:03] let's do this let's go there same thing
[47:06] why because you have so Leah 90 and i'ma
[47:10] tell you something I have not seen a
[47:12] marriage yet they have been so good so
[47:15] much together and then they start
[47:16] looking like
[47:17] each other it's the way it is anyway
[47:23] let's move on you love the Lord so I
[47:25] want you to understand my heart I want
[47:27] you to understand amen
[47:28] whatever message I bring it is for you
[47:32] and that's what you need to say Lord
[47:34] what what what is it in this message
[47:37] that I need to hear not with my head
[47:39] with my heart you know the Lord see
[47:45] Pentecost is not an organization
[47:47] Pentecostals and experience that anyone
[47:50] can have and I was thinking about the
[47:52] prophet of God when he didn't know God
[47:54] he said I didn't even know how to to say
[47:57] my ABC I didn't even know how to pray so
[47:59] I said ABC DL he talked about a story on
[48:01] that right he said and he said wouldn't
[48:05] when he wanted God he said he didn't
[48:07] even know how but he said God I know you
[48:10] hear me
[48:11] I know you hear me and I know he said if
[48:14] my if this this cross if this blood is
[48:17] for me the Lord you know reappear here
[48:20] because what happened we confess his sin
[48:22] and ask God to come into his heart
[48:24] amen a cross came down and he said to
[48:28] God if that be you do it again show me
[48:32] though because I don't know your
[48:33] language and you may know mine but I
[48:35] don't know your language show me in the
[48:38] message absolutely says it and and you
[48:41] say Oh after a while he said oh he said
[48:44] he said I waited to my mom my mom said
[48:46] Billy you just nervous he said I don't
[48:48] know what it is he said but all of a
[48:51] sudden he just got out there and ran
[48:52] down the track he said he started
[48:54] running wide open he said I didn't even
[48:57] know how to express my feelings amen
[48:59] he's at all but if I knew how to shout
[49:01] he said what I did I just did it my way
[49:04] see you gotta understand make this thing
[49:07] that happens once you realize it and I'm
[49:09] gonna tell you something you'll never
[49:11] get the Holy Ghost until you really see
[49:13] how wretched you are you don't see
[49:16] yourself Richard and the sinner that
[49:17] needs to be saved you'll never get it
[49:20] you got to see yourself worth less
[49:23] you got to see yourself like a worm a
[49:25] maggot one of the most disgusting little
[49:27] creatures ever but you got a
[49:30] yourself like that and really meaning is
[49:32] this God I need your help I need you not
[49:39] only do I need you but I want you I know
[49:42] this wicked knife this thing out here is
[49:44] not me it can't be me
[49:46] I don't enjoy I don't enjoy it it's not
[49:48] what I want I want you you may not feel
[49:53] lightning or thunder boat at the time
[49:55] but something got to happen because the
[49:58] Bible said if a man coming to me he come
[50:00] unto me I will and in no wise cast him
[50:02] out hallelujah
[50:05] even Christ in you is that Alright oh he
[50:10] said remember we are now as his bride
[50:13] preg mated with his spirit all my church
[50:18] bearing children see Prag nated by his
[50:22] spirit with his name bearing his name
[50:25] bearing his life bringing forth the
[50:28] signs of his life evidence with the
[50:31] preeminence 'as evidence of his
[50:33] resurrection showing that he is not dead
[50:37] but alive forevermore this is eternal
[50:41] life and vindicated vindicates to the
[50:44] world that we are alive in him y'all
[50:47] hear me it is not just carrying a buckle
[50:50] or bad you know saying I'm in the
[50:52] message it's a line and that only comes
[50:55] by a union and the world is supposed to
[50:58] see you said well what do you mean
[51:02] brother Brooks I guarantee you if there
[51:04] are stars out there at night and the
[51:06] clouds are not blocking them you're
[51:07] going to see those stars and so you
[51:10] understand in the darkness of the night
[51:12] each star stands alone huh Dan you see
[51:22] if nobody shows up to the prayer meeting
[51:25] I'll be there see then
[51:34] y'all don't mind do you ok I'm almost
[51:37] done I'm almost done because I see what
[51:38] time it is now I just assumed you come
[51:40] be here this evening brother ok I didn't
[51:43] know whether you scheduled I thought all
[51:44] night I'd already said he's gonna do
[51:46] song service and I don't even know where
[51:47] he's gonna be whether he's gonna be here
[51:49] or not
[51:49] now I just talked fast it y'all
[51:51] understood I get carried away sometime
[51:55] but you know we look at this thing he
[51:57] says listen you do know cuz you're a
[52:01] church member because Christ is living
[52:02] through you you know he says so pregnant
[52:06] it with the spirit that you you're a
[52:07] prisoner to anything else you can find
[52:11] oh my to the gospel confined to the word
[52:15] and all the children that you bring can
[52:18] bring forth is that cuz you are prisoner
[52:21] you can't commit adultery you're already
[52:24] pregnant oh now he's not talking that to
[52:28] each other spiritually you can't commit
[52:31] adultery you already pregnant girl
[52:33] already
[52:34] he can't take hold see he can he can't
[52:37] take a hold some of the enemy the womb
[52:39] is of life it's close to anything else
[52:42] you're already here by predestination
[52:46] the seed has come to light no world can
[52:50] get in oh he says how we like to stay on
[52:54] this for about an hour I'm sure you
[52:56] understand see Christ and his alone
[52:59] already finished the sea was there that
[53:02] she was already and when what and when
[53:05] was it put there before the foundation
[53:08] of the world
[53:09] has predestinated us unto eternal life
[53:11] as soon as a life-giving flow that seed
[53:15] laying there other seeds that you just
[53:18] would come in wouldn't take hold just
[53:21] couldn't do it
[53:22] what do you mean that's why you couldn't
[53:24] follow my other method is or you
[53:27] couldn't follow the Lutheran and you
[53:29] couldn't follow the cattle and you
[53:30] couldn't follow the Pittock also see it
[53:32] couldn't grab you it couldn't hold you
[53:34] but when this message caught you
[53:36] something exploded something happened on
[53:39] the inside because that was a seed that
[53:41] you were carrying
[53:45] if the seed of the lutheran was in you
[53:47] you would have carried a Lutheran C or
[53:51] Wesleyan seed but because the seed of
[53:55] God is in you you caught this message or
[53:58] this message caught in you hallelujah
[54:03] and you become a prisoner surrounded in
[54:06] Christ Christ in you his life bringing
[54:09] forth his evidence his science he's over
[54:12] my look bringing his signs of life as
[54:14] evidence of the resurrection proving to
[54:17] the world that listen I want to say
[54:19] something that's brother Mike it at a
[54:22] Main Street right the young man Mike
[54:24] they kind of we talked with he came over
[54:28] to my table the other day and started
[54:30] talking and walking in the hallelujah
[54:31] wanted to know the gospel huh hey man we
[54:34] we sit there preaching to him hallelujah
[54:36] and in the next table over there and
[54:39] then they were listening and when he had
[54:42] to go back out off his lunch break the
[54:44] lady looked at me like what was it Amen
[54:48] see people watch your life and I told my
[54:53] said you know I was just thinking about
[54:54] you I said Lord I said I've never
[54:56] invited that man to church yet and here
[54:59] the man comes and he invites himself he
[55:02] said I got a Bible in my glove
[55:04] compartment right now I've tried out
[55:06] this I've tried out that he said and I
[55:08] said no you looking for truth I said
[55:11] brother I can help
[55:13] hallelujah oh my you show all my lord
[55:17] what's what's happening she you know
[55:19] even even the one brother that I
[55:21] couldn't seem to get hold to y'all I
[55:23] want to say his name he might listen to
[55:24] this tape but anyhow amen I was able to
[55:27] give him a church age book he said I'm a
[55:31] reader I said brother you got to read I
[55:33] said if you read this book read it
[55:35] carefully with your Bible everything as
[55:39] I want you to read it I said and when
[55:42] you finish I said if there's nothing
[55:44] there I won't bother you again
[55:45] I might have to repeat but but my tip is
[55:51] to say I'm looking cuz I'm praying God
[55:54] why he read this book may the word
[55:57] god quicken I said brother it will
[56:01] change your life it'll change the way
[56:03] you look at things have you thoroughly
[56:05] read this book the way it is hello
[56:09] see you don't think people looking at
[56:12] started I say I said yeah brother
[56:13] brother rich goes to my church but the
[56:15] Keith goes there I said to almost
[56:17] everybody I come here and with to do
[56:20] lunch or whatever they go to the church
[56:21] he really got excited then so you said
[56:24] what brother was worth it because I said
[56:26] brother whenever I said and he said
[56:27] there I said listen man I said when I
[56:30] cuz he said it and I said come with me
[56:34] amen and you know we just started
[56:36] talking about the Lord I knew there was
[56:40] an attraction and I'm like Lord I need
[56:42] to talk to this man I've talked with the
[56:44] young lady you know we're not y'all
[56:45] y'all y'all I get excited so let me say
[56:49] this before I close because I'm closing
[56:50] I finished this either this evening of
[56:54] whenever but my point is this we getting
[56:58] ready to have this meeting down there in
[56:59] Iowa City I expect everybody to come at
[57:02] least one night you can't make them all
[57:04] that's fine but come when you can and
[57:07] this week we are hoping to get down
[57:11] there by Friday we're going to have some
[57:13] witnessing on the streets amen we're
[57:16] gonna form a choir for those who might
[57:18] want to come we let you know what that
[57:20] would we'll practice on Saturday I don't
[57:23] know exactly what time I'm expecting the
[57:24] musicians to get back with you on that
[57:26] but my point is we want to do whatever
[57:30] we can do they and once that done we'll
[57:34] bring it this way before the summer out
[57:37] I really want to have a meeting up here
[57:41] where we can get out here and witness
[57:43] and testify and sing and act like holy
[57:46] rollers y'all hear me young people I
[57:52] need you because when they see young
[57:55] people I used to be young one time
[57:56] believe it or not and they really you
[57:59] know I had an old lady said that's what
[58:01] gets me you young while you go up to
[58:04] that church so she opened the door for
[58:07] me she said I've never seen even though
[58:09] she wanted to stay about this she
[58:11] recognized something had ahold of me you
[58:14] see what I'm saying and my point is this
[58:16] you know we need to get out and we need
[58:18] to do something because what it will do
[58:21] it will fire you up again
[58:24] we've been sitting still too long hello
[58:29] and we need to do something don't be
[58:32] ashamed of what you got so for those who
[58:37] want to join me I don't mind I started
[58:40] out on the street with a tambourine and
[58:43] three or four singers they were all
[58:45] sisters and we would bring in Souls I
[58:48] baptized I don't know how many people in
[58:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[58:51] don't even know where they are
[58:53] it's not my business right yeah Philip
[58:58] baptized the eunuch is that okay you got
[59:00] a side in his car cuz I need to keep up
[59:01] with you know it was all about God ain't
[59:08] God good to us
[59:09] amen so y'all keep that in mind pray
[59:12] about it amen because we need to let the
[59:14] world see God reflected in us all right
[59:19] reflected in us amen
[59:23] let's tan one more scripture as you
[59:26] stand
[59:40] 13:34 35 a new commandment I give unto
[59:43] you that you love one another as I have
[59:46] loved you that you also love one another
[59:49] by this shall all men know that ye are
[59:52] my disciples if you love one to another
[59:57] and so we understand that we being
[1:00:04] Babylon every end but one thing that God
[1:00:08] said we gotta love one another and if
[1:00:14] it's not there you need to ask God to
[1:00:16] give it it's there like I said the
[1:00:19] sugars at the bottom of the other of the
[1:00:21] jaw just stir that kool-aid up you love
[1:00:27] the Lord I love God I'm not saying I'm
[1:00:31] where you should be I mean I hear people
[1:00:34] say brother Brooks I've never seen a man
[1:00:35] like you and you know I know you love
[1:00:37] God and all that and those good things
[1:00:39] they sound so good but then I know
[1:00:40] what's on the inside I know the real me
[1:00:46] you know I'm constantly asking for God's
[1:00:49] grace and God's mercy and it's a daily
[1:00:52] thing that I pray before God and you
[1:00:55] know you see strongholds in your life
[1:00:57] that you want God to deliver you from
[1:01:01] because you want to be in that image you
[1:01:05] want to get to a place you don't see
[1:01:06] nothing of the world just God himself
[1:01:09] I'm not thirsting for power whether God
[1:01:14] used me to open the eyes of the blind or
[1:01:16] raise the dead or anything else like
[1:01:18] that that's not it
[1:01:19] that's not my goal my goal is to know
[1:01:23] that he is in me and I am in him not
[1:01:29] some of the time all the time I want my
[1:01:33] mind to be completely erased of my own
[1:01:36] ideas and our own thoughts I only want
[1:01:40] the mind of Christ I don't I don't know
[1:01:43] what that is but I want to know because
[1:01:46] the Bible said let this mind be in you
[1:01:48] I want that mind I want to be like Paul
[1:01:51] says I am a prisoner of Christ
[1:01:54] if I have my lose all friends and all
[1:01:56] family I still wanna have that place in
[1:02:02] Christ where I am a prisoner
[1:02:05] you know because once you get closer to
[1:02:08] God you will get you get on you get on
[1:02:10] Christian nerves that's all you talk
[1:02:14] about is Jesus you know I'm not
[1:02:17] interested in the football and the
[1:02:19] basketball and all that kind of stuff
[1:02:21] got out there and I ain't I don't know
[1:02:22] no Hollywood singers and swingers and
[1:02:25] all that I'm not interested in all of
[1:02:26] that that's out of here why would I be
[1:02:29] interested in things the newspapers from
[1:02:31] hell my goal is to know heavenly things
[1:02:39] that's all I want to know I want them to
[1:02:44] take full full control of this preacher
[1:02:47] I can't give a count for nobody else but
[1:02:52] this preacher I don't want to be like
[1:02:55] everybody else I'm not in it for the
[1:02:59] money I'm not in it for the women and
[1:03:00] I'm not in it for the popularity
[1:03:03] I'm in it for one thing this is my
[1:03:05] calling and I want to complete the goal
[1:03:10] that God sent here for you love the Lord
[1:03:13] I trust that's your desire God sent you
