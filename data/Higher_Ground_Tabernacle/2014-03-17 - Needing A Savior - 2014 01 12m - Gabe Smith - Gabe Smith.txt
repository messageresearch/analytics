TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and so uh we just uh love the Lord this morning so I just uh have a little thought this morning I'm I I uh I can say with confidence I know it's going to be a blessing to you man if you're you're a child of God today both Services is going to bless your heart without a shadow of a doubt I know that uh because I it's it's uh it's not my thought it's not going to be my word amen amen you know uh cuz I I believe God called me to be a preacher yeah amen and he called me to be an ecclesiastics preacher if you if you look at that word in ecclesiastics the word preacher in ecclesiastics it actually means to be a collector of sentences amen what it means look it up and so uh uh I'm just uh not here to bring my own message cuz I believe we already got got one amen I want to change it a bit I love it just the way it is amen amen it's tried and true it's been tested praise the Lord I just uh I'd like to uh first uh maybe just a little bit different with the PowerPoint but uh I'm sure uh uh it'll it'll be a blessing especially uh maybe to the little ones uh and I don't know about you but I'm a little one amen amen and so uh uh brother you may be so revelated you don't need it but just close your eyes then amen praise the Lord we're going to look here very familiar scripture uh let's let's put that put that down just a little bit see there we go all right Luke chapter 23 verse 32 and there were also two two other maleactors LED with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him the male factors one on the right hand and the other on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be the Christ the chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and the superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek greek latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews and the one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answered rebuking him saying Dost not thou fear God now let's think about this friends there is not a a a uh a situ situation where Christ is is in the temple and robed in his robe without a seam and uh looking uh uh as we would say anointed in fresh for the service but this is where the Bible said his viage was marred more than any other man that when this man could look at Christ he he was he was he was so disfigured he didn't even look like a man but this thief could look at Christ in that condition and see something more than just a man he saw God praise the Lord he said he said does not thou fear God seeing thou in the same condemnation amen talk about predestination and election he gives us eyes to see amen and here's to hear he said and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man have done nothing a miss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom I'd like to speak to you this morning by the help of the Lord on a on a thought of needing needing a savior let's just bow our heads in word of prayer precious Lord we love you God today Lord I just pray that you would be behind this pull pit Lord God that you would have your way in this service Lord we appreciate the songs and we appreciate the saving power Lord of your love and truth and we just pray that it' be displayed this morning God we love you and committ into your hands and pray that you'd have your way we ask these things to be so in the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you like needing a savior and uh be before I I I I get into this thought I I I want to give you just a little uh a little preview of this evening's thought um I I want to speak to you tomorrow or this evening uh on on a little thought called emotions of Christ and uh I I really really want to admonish you to to come back this evening service uh uh don't don't uh take a rest but please come back to the house of God tonight not not for my glory but but I I I can promise you if you love the Lord Jesus tonight's service will bless your heart it'll it'll give you and I uh I I I I don't want to go too much into it but uh I I spent a uh a greater portion of a of a year off and on studying the gospels looking at every time Christ had a motion displayed in the word and um it it was absolutely it absolutely transformed my perception of Jesus Christ and who he is and and I'm positive that it'll it'll give you a different insight to your lord and savior if you'll just come back and and and and be a part of the service so I just want to encourage you to do that uh tonight but uh Tom tonight this morning uh we're going to look at needing a savior and uh uh how many needs a savior this morning amen uh I I I know and don't get me wrong as as we uh just maybe to give you a little disclaimer uh I realize uh before you start putting quotes together in your mind that we were saved in in before the foundation of the world is that right I I realized that but but still and and yet uh even though that be true we still need a savior this morning is that right uh I need him every day of my life uh I know he was there before the world ever was but I needed to be displayed AR fresh today in 2014 is that right and and so uh uh brother brandham tells us this that in the beginning there was nothing but God and in God was attributes his attribute to be a savior we know it so he is a savior and that was in him and there was nothing lost to be saved in him was attributes to be father and there was nothing he could father in him was attributes to be healer there was nothing lost nothing sick so the only thing he could do was make man in the B basis of free moral agency knowing he would do it God didn't do it himself man done it himself and you're the same way this morning you can accept life or you can turn it down amen but God made man thus that he knowing he would do it not willing that he should do it but knowing he would do it that it would display his attributes so there's nothing out of time everything is ticking there's nothing out of time everything is ticking just exactly according to God's great time piece see and this only displays his attributes to select his children who really love him and believe him amen and so we we we we uh uh Realize by the message of God that that uh uh God uh had to uh you know we think so much of of us needing to be saved right but there's another aspect of it that God needed someone to save there was a part of him that he had to have something to save amen and so there was a deep calling out to a deep not just in us but in him amen and I believe all through Christ uh Earthly Ministry that even though now right now he is a blood blanner over the Earth interceding for us this morning amen but when he was on Earth his whole life and Ministry was to express a savior yeah whether it was healing a little boy or or though he had 99 sheep it just wasn't enough why cuz he's not satisfied with 99% amen he's not satisfied with 99.9 amen but he's got to had the full 100 amen and he wants to be a savior this morning if you don't know Jesus Christ in the power of His Saving Grace I believe this morning is your morning that's right Amen brother brother brother Brenham tells us this he says you see now now why thank you brother he says you see now why that that man was more than just a teacher as people say he is today a philosopher a good man or a prophet he was Emmanuel he was the son of God which is Jehovah God made manifest in his attributes to display himself in a body that he built himself amen it reflected now watch this is what God did this is when we see Jesus we see the very Heart Of God is that right amen he says he says uh uh he says uh and the sinful nature of man could not do the thing that he did so it had to be God making reflecting himself in a man making a miracle that we might see that perfect man which is Christ yes this doing that reflected his Noble loving character seeing him was attribute as a savior and it had to display itself you know I I I I I I the Lord started dealing with my heart on this several months ago and I've been saved since 2001 and I I think it's uh something that we as uh Christians we all go through because a thought like this is very uh um real to us when we first get saved but as we get a few years on us I believe we start leaning on our own arm of Flesh maybe not consciously but sub consciously can you say amen and and and and you know I I believe it this morning you know God is not a disgruntled savior that's right God's not disgruntled that that he saved that he sent his own son that he could save us God so loved you that he sent his son and we need a savior this morning we can be as predestinated as we want to but we need a savior I believe message people get so predestinated that they no longer need a savior but I need a savior this morning I need Jesus Christ I don't know the way of a Rapture without my savior taking me by the hand and leading me and guiding me to that Promised Land amen his whole life was to express salvation to save men and women from sin amen the Bible said he had a need to go by Samaria and when he sat on that whale exhausted being wearied from his journey brother Benham tells us this in several places in the message that he was actually on his road to Jericho but God gave him a vision and then he had a need to go by Samaria is that right and so God this morning friends God will change his direction to come savior he'll go way out of his way to come save you don't hey don't take my word for it but I want you to look at the wrong map this morning and believe for yourself cuz the look at here look he said he he was brother man said he was on his road to Jericho but he had a need to go by Samaria glor Hallelujah Hall amen friends he was on his road to Jericho but he would go three times out of his way to Samaria for a [Applause] harlot he he didn't have no Cadillac he had no Cadillac to run through the car wash for his Samaria but he'll go a long way out of his way to save you cuz that's what he is he's the Savior praise the Lord he'll go way out of his way friends cuz he has a need to be a savior cuz that's what he is but we as man we as men we all battle with trying to save ourselves eles and if you on the inside of the inside says oh no not me you're actually lying to yourself because brother brandham says us tells us this and he talks about this all throughout the message this is just one quote he says man's always trying to find someone some way to save himself that's right here it is that's his nature in the Garden of Eden the man as soon as he found out he was lost he made himself a religion a fig Leaf apron and put it over him you see why I think EV was so beautiful see see why don't why I don't think these things the these think of these things these strains now watch brother BR Taps into something that's the strain of man yet tonight amen amen he says even after 4,000 yes nearly 6,000 years man is still trying to cover his own sins by his own merits and and so we uh as and brother you know we all I'm sure we've all know about family strains how many's ever known a family that uh uh you know uh the son acts just like the daddy and daddy acts just just like Grandpa and it's and it may even be unconscious but it's just a family strain is that right now friends listen I don't care uh whether whether we're from Ohio Indiana Carolinas overseas wherever it may be we this is a blanket statement we as Humanity all deal with this strain am you fight this strain because by Nature you want to save yourself am that's exactly right that's why this message came so fresh to me after i' been serving the lord since 2001 because when we get a little season on ourselves we get a few uh uh quotes put together in our mind we have a few doctrines laid out we we may have a few uh little bit of understanding and we begin in our own self to try to Merit our own salvation and place our own eles in the kingdom of God but we still have to be as babes realizing that we need Christ there is no retirement to a Christian there is no 20 years and out I thought you know I remember thinking oh when I stop drinking and drugging then I'll be all right then I thought well when I when I when I when I when I stop having cuss words is going through my mind praise the Lord but when you try to put those landmarks in your Christian walk you'll never be successful because you'll always be grasping you'll always be reaching no matter how listen you may had a good year in 2013 you may have been you may have lived a perfect life in 2013 but listen with when you no matter how well let's say you had a wonderful prayer life but if you really look deep I'm sure there's some areas where you were lacking maybe you didn't get enough give enough offering you you didn't give to the missionaries like you should maybe you didn't have the the relationship with your family and anytime no matter how well we may think we are we remember we the Bible says be ye perfect even as he is perfect and no matter how good we may think we are when we measure up in our own selves to his Perfection we will always come up short amen listen I want to encourage you this morning that the battle is not between you and Satan that's right and the battle certainly isn't between you and God our Prophet preach the message the conflict between God and Satan amen we have to rest in that that it's not our fight it's not our battle I need to be saved friends I need salvation I need something real today I can't go back to 2001 cuz the Bible says today is the day of your praise the Lord but you know man just another quote to back it up notice man has the same six senses he had had 6,000 years ago 6,000 years ago with the senses he had he contacted his Earthly home and served God and now in the past 75 years that man has come from a horse and buggy to an astronaut why he turned away from his faith in God and turned it over to his senses and his ability as a human being did you notice it he quit trusting God and he trusts himself now now remember this was and we gone from a h and buggy to an astronaut and we're in an astronaut age right spiritually speaking but we can still trust spiritually or in our own ability as what we understand or comprehend you can have everything all lined out friends but but but but your computer is never going to take you in a Rapture your computer files are never going to take you in a Rapture praise the Lord friends my iPad is not going to take me in a Rapture my PowerPoints ain't going to take me in a Rapture the Earth only one that's going to lead me to a Rapture and his name is Jesus Christ and we have to solely trust upon him is that right that is it's okay this morning oh brother Brooks I don't see a clock nowhere oh hallelujah oh praise God don't get scared he he said Proverbs 16:20 he that trust he that handle the matter wisely shall find good and who so trusteth in the Lord [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah GL this all you got brother gay come on friends come on amen listen if we can't be happy in the house of God where can we be happy H amen oh he said that's one place oh I got many he said but let all those that put their trust put their trust in thee Rejoice amen let them let them ever shout for Joy amen why we shout because he defends us let them also that love thy name be joyful in so trust brings Joy trust in him brings happiness is that right right the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusteth in him and I am help therefore my heart well that's just not my nature brother Brooks oh my praise God you might want to look a little deeper now may have some trust issues hallelujah praise the Lord just saying cuz Bible says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on this economy whose mind is stayed on Obamacare whose mind is stayed on the hour the mo hour was crop prospects whose mind is stayed on the the the Wall Street Stock Exchange you never find peace there I don't care how many zeros you got in your bank account if you trust in that bank account one day it's going to burn but if you'll trust in him that's Eternal praise the Lord see God don't just save our soul and make us go through life struggling and stressing and straining but the Bible tells me this the Bible tells me this that he wants to be our savior in all things amen amen is that right he wants to be your savior in all things I don't know about you friends listen he saved me from a life of drugs he saved me from a life of alcohol he saved me from a life of crime he saved me from a life of misery he saved me from a life with no meaning and no purpose he saved me from a life with no substance he saved me from a life of the depression and uncertainty God Is My Savior this morning that's who I trust in that's to I depend upon if I trust in my own self one day I'm up next day I'm down we've got to trust in something higher don't trust in your job I don't care if you got a PhD l d that's still going to fail one day because one day friends if that Soul ain't converted your mind may be lost but if your Soul's converted know if your mind you may be in on aane institution as brother brandham said but that Soul's just as Bound for heaven as there is a heaven amen that's exactly right but we have to have the right perspective because Jesus says this for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially to those that believe in other words friends how many how many know somebody that God has saved somebody from cigarettes that's all the farther they went cuz he wants to be a savior of all men cuz that savior actually means to be a deliverer or preserver and so many people can feel the the expression the attribute of God as a savior and and maybe get them to sanctification or justification and and and God will save you as much as you allow him to save you because he is a gentleman is that right it's right I believe it friends I I don't know about you but how would we handle the stressful situations that we go through what about that nervous breakdown that you almost had huh praise the Lord what about the time you almost called it quits in your marriage but he was but he was our savior come on friends and we and many times we we think we did it in our own selves but we got to give him praise we got to give him the credit give him the glory amen we need to be more conscious friends he saved us from pitfalls and torments what about that depression you started feeling last Wednesday afternoon but he saved you see because God God don't want you to be frowning amen well I'm just more on the serious type brother Brooks come on friends we got to be happy amen Christianity ought to do something to us listen listen like brother Bram said God God a god ain't standing over there with a three Corner Club every time you make a mistake why' you do what's the matter with you that's not the God we serve God ain't standing with a three quarter Club ready to beat you over yeah I told you to stop do that he's a savior that's what he is but Satan Satan wants to paint the picture that God is a brutal God that's exactly what Satan wants he wants to paint a picture that every time you mess up that's it I'm sick of you but that's not the God we serve am the God we serve is love the God we serve is peace amen remember there's an attribute of longsuffering Amen thank you Lord he said God wants you to be happy he wants you to be so happy he said the human heart was made to be happy God designed your heart to be happy he made it that way he designed it in a purpose so you to be happy he says worry will cause cancer amen yes sir it's all I don't know about that well where's the science on that don't worry give them a few years they'll get called up to the message don't worry God terries they'll catch up they'll get caught up to you say I don't know about that let me give you a scripture man's heart's failing for fear so human emotion can affect your health brother B ain't just pulling from nowhere friend he ain't just shooting he ain't just you know brother B ain't shooting from the hip when he say these things friends no sir he says worry I don't care how many you may never eat another GMO in your whole life you may have the pure absolute you may have you may be making $300,000 where you can afford to buy to to be able to boil you may be able to be able to afford to grow organic and have you a you know a greenhouse in the backyard you may have seeds from the Garden of Eden but if you got worry yeah and it's it'll cause cancer temper oh my temper will cause cancer don't never be upset is this okay yes thank you he says just walk in his love amen knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither power things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will well I tell you my daddy walked with the prophet my grandpa or well my dad's been in this message so that's the reason while I'm in here no no sorry get that out of your mind sorry no sir no ma'am never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen I love it brought us into him he didn't bring you into a Doctrine he didn't bring you into a few quotes he didn't bring you in just to just to a church setting he brought you into himself glory amen he says by he says he says so it's his business to take care of what he took himself some of you may have God as your co-pilot that's why you got the problems that you have won't you let him get behind the wheel you sit in the back seat don't sit shotgun sit in the back seat Hallelujah kick your kick your feet up on the seat there slide over kick your seat feet up and rest amen let him do it friends amen is that all right amen praise God brother bam says this he says it's if God takes pleasure in people being sick for heal the sick whenever you come in contact with him he he healed the sick then if it's God's will for people to suffer if he did Christ defeated his own will and when he come well if it's God's will for me to be healed no friend you might as well already admit it's your lack of faith come on friends we we we we we ought to never have a plan B we ought to always be faithful I don't care if I'm on my deathbed friends I've said this before I say it again listen if I've got to have a disease not that I want one but brother Brooks if I got to have a disease I want the rare I want one that nobody's ever had GL to God I want the rarest one that there is but I got to have one you know why because the Bible says I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases amen and if nobody's ever had it God's word got to be fulfilled I'm the one that's going to be fulfill come on friends we can't trust in Armor man we got to trust in him praise the Lord not that I want sickness but you understand what I'm saying friends we got to have that kind of confidence he says he said oh my what kind of gospel would you have see God doesn't run his office you wouldn't run your office like that I wouldn't mind you in yours how about God running his see God works at one purpose and that's to always make you doubt your Revelation and whether you're saved and always keep you grasping for tell me you ain't never had a picture of God in that your mind in your mind I'll raise both hands God works at one purpose that's to save and to be good and to do everything he can it's his pleasure to give his blessings bount ly to his people he said but we fail not because the power is not in the church because the power is not in the Pentecostal Church Methodist Church you Baptist pres Luther whatever you are you've got the power but you ain't got the faith to move that power friend we got to believe we got to have faith it's remember when you when you're born again everything you have need of is already in inside of you is that what the prophet taught us praise the Lord got an acorn you got every every bit of nut whatever it may have been it's it's in that Acorn already in potential form that's right it's just got to be placed in the right soil it's got to be watered sunlight neutrient all those things have to happen praise the Lord I believe we're in the right soil Hallelujah I believe we got the right light I believe we got the right vitamins amen big radish is and praise the Lord Brother B says this he says the world needed a savior one day and God provided his son when he come he was not recognized he was not wanted they said they wanted a savior but when God sent it his way they asked for a king God gave them a baby they wanted a mighty man to stop out of Rome God gave him a little CME baby in a barn see but it was God's provided way but they didn't want it the way God wanted to send it they wanted it the way they wanted it see and so therefore they went into chaos because they didn't accept his way amen listen friends I'll be honest with you the more I serve the Lord the more I see the importance of this message this message is not a suggestion can I say it again this message is not a suggestion list listen as me as as as your pastor uh as different ones ministers maybe have something they don't know they can suggest something to you maybe to help you if they got but but the message is not a suggestion there only one way friend there's only one provided way and we have to go that way amen praise the Lord listen friends this world is wanting a savior God promised that the trumpet would sound again always always the people listens to the true voice of the word always examine What You Do by the word this is what this is just he says the voice of politics and that thing's rampant in the message oh my friends let let you know if you ever seen you know I I've I've had I've had message Brothers send me emails that had cuss words in them blasting Obama oh yeah yeah brother oh yeah you know what I'm talking about how many ever got one huh oh yeah brother yeah and and and you see people with such a hate for our president and and I'm sorry it's not scriptural that's right I'm sorry friends listen I'm not a republican I'm not a Democrat I'm a Christian Hallelujah yes sir and and we can fall under that voice of politics amen praise the Lord look look you think about this you and and you know this message attracts all kinds because people that are that are have that voice of politics they'll just they'll just cater to the quotes of brother Brandon blast the government and they'll capitalize on that but then their house will be in shambles yeah or or you take a man that's that's real domineering he's the head of the home he'll hold to every one of the quotes where brother brandom is talking about that but let him have some love and he ain't got nothing do you understand what I'm saying and so and so brother I'll be honest with you I I want it all yeah I I I don't want to I don't want to hold to any certain portion of the message I want it all friends I want it all and I believe in order for us to have it all we've got to have the voice of God to do it he says and we in America and the rest of the world have a loud-speaking voice today and that's the voice of Hollywood it's captured the world let somebody come out in Hollywood with something you find it all over the country watch our sisters don't get me wrong no no no no I I wait wait watch our brothers watch them brothers you know and and they had them skinny jeans with a bow tie on little sissified vest oh ain't it it's a shame friends just straight out of Hollywood sir praise the Lord friends don't get me wrong I like to look good yeah yeah amen I'll be honest with you but I'm not trendy you know they talk that that's a word trending what's trending now it's trendy and when we got to be trendy something's wrong friends cuz the gospel ain't trendy I I'll be honest with you I I like for my tie to match my shirt yeah right brother I I I like to be clean I like to look good I think I look pretty nice myself huh yes sir but friends I'm not trendy amen you understand what I'm saying and and so and so watch you got to see the spirit behind it yes I realize brother Braham didn't care if his socks matched his shirt but look at the way he grew up am I grew up by my mama in a divorced home and my mama loved to decorate yeah she loved to coordinate and it rubbed off on me you understand I didn't grow up in the woods I'm a city boy but I'm grateful Elisha was a city boy amen cuz I got a type in the Bible for me I'm not a Woodsman like Elijah but am like elishah praise the Lord friends hey I'll be honest with you when I came to this message I thought oh Lord I'm not a hunter I'm not a fisherman I don't own a stitch of camouflage how am I ever going to be bride oh yeah friends but that but that's not the voice of God God don't care if you got camouflage or not yeah long as you got the camouflage of the Holy Ghost to keep you HD away in Christ that's the only thing that matters but you know the world wants a Superman the world wants a Superman and it's the voice of Hollywood you know if if you if you look at Superman he's absolutely a blasphemy of Jesus Christ you know if you look at Superman's story he had a a heavenly father and he came to Earth to save the world do you know his Earth you know what his Earthly parents was the ver when Superman was first created is created by two Jewish men and they patterned Superman off of Samson and all the great things of of the Bible they patterned it off of that it's history friends and and so you know when when they first made Superman's uh parents his mama's name was Mary and his daddy's name was Joseph wow Google it out it ain't a hard search oh yeah his and he had a he had a heavenly father but at one time he went to a Wilderness Journey up in the of Superman and then he resurrected oh yeah friends and the religious worlds are eating it up when this movie came out the latest version of it they they actually had a website where where men pastors could get on there and get sermons to preach to their congregation and and and they said if you watch this movie there's all kind of similarities they've got uh Superman uh talking next to a picture of Jesus and he's hanging in a form of a crucifixion and and they were rejoicing ing on the similarities that between and they said that Superman is more spiritual than Jesus Christ because people can relate to Superman than they can oh yeah friends absolutely blasphemy and the world is gobbling it up and I want to say this friends and admonish you this morning if you let your children watch that thing you're absolutely poking perversion down their throats listen you think of it if if the children's groomed for that and they see a Hulk and ible Hulk what does Samson look like if they see Superman and it's a cartoon what about when they see the cartoon of Jesus Christ what it does is it blurs the lines and that's all satan wants to do he wants to make the Bible he wants to make this just another Fable he wants to make this just another fiction story you better be careful with science fiction friends putting that in your children's hands because it blurs the lines and it makes them lose the the precious value of the word of God because this is not a su science fiction this is the supernatural hallelujah praise the Lord friends it's the voice of Hollywood and it's drowning it's absolutely deafening the masses it's exactly right but I I tell you you friends with all that going on there was a savior of the world standing outside his own church he bought with his own blood shame upon them standing at the door and knocking after being pushed out and ousted he still knocking amen friends in 1956 the world America rejected him and he still kept knocking 1956 yeah I wasn't even born 1963 comes around seals open does he close the door still knocking 1965 the prophet leaves the scene does he close the door still knocking amen 1977 comes around people come and go does he close the door no still knocking year 2000 h amen people get excited about so now and what happened 2000 and 2000 comes and goes does the door close still knocking fence Lord why why why and here was all of that still knocking the door trying to get back in for what and it wasn't to beat you over the head he wasn't waiting for you to to come to age of cabes so he could keep you just blasted and beat down and and feel like you're just a just a miserable wretch and all this things it was so he could give you salvation so that he could give you eternal life that's our God that's our savior that's what he is to express his Noble loving character amen hallelujah friends amen look look look think about this he says this is Paul speaking for we ourselves were sometimes I'm so grateful Paul didn't say you and you but he said we he said and we also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving daers lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy and hateful and hating one another but but but after that the kindness and love of God are listen friends Paul didn't just hear Ephesians 1 he wrote it but he still said our savior if Paul needed a savior don't be so predestinated you don't need one you understand what I'm saying message people friend you know you talk about savior Sal it's almost oh that's just so you know that's not revelated enough friends if you missed the revelation of being a needing a savior you missed it all there's going to be multitude and masses no doubt if they have Bible studies in Hell there going to be plenty of message Believers have them and they can push all their ideas and theologies they want to but it don't do no good for we need a savior he said our savior appeared and toward men appeared not by works of righteous which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly amen abundantly for not sparingly but abundantly abundantly through our through Jesus Christ Our Savior the Bible tells us in John 16:24 here to have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full Jesus wants you to have full Joy this morning amen he says listen in Acts 2:28 thou Hast made no made made known to me the ways of life Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy presence Heen that's countless his presence so if if we can be in the in the presence of God and not have joy something's wrong sir something's wrong friends something's wrong we ought to have full Joy not just half a cup not just right above the E before the light comes on it ought to be full Joy am full Joy he said beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health amen right and be in health even as thy soul prospers am God don't want you to have hard times he may have them hard times on you because he's got to get you through something but it's for a purpose not to hurt you is that right watch this he says fear not little flock for it is your it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom the kingdom of God is not something that you can earn it has to be given amen is that right amen praise the Lord I I realize we all go through things friends don't get me wrong but listen if if you're going through just years of misery something's wrong with your experience amen amen we go through seasons of Trials the the the the the the the Christian life is not just one big season of Misery we go through seasons of Darkness but there ought to be a time of refreshing there ought to be a time of renewal there ought to be a time where we where we where we where we get revived and refreshed and and you all know what I'm talking about you remember I I tell you it's been recently uh a couple months ago it's like I never read the message before yall know what I'm talking about you had them times you just can't get enough and it's just like you never you may listen to that message 20 times and it's just as freshing and new why cuz you're going through a season of renewal you're going through a Revival in your soul and God is refreshing you from the presence of God cuz God wants you to be happy he wants it's his good pleasure it's not out golfing on the golf course his good pleasure is to give you the Holy Ghost to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost matter of fact he wants you to have it more than you wanted to have it is that right watch what brother Bram says he said could you imagine take all the waters in the earth let's take that Earth let's take all that water off that Earth he says and the season everything and pile it in one one 4T pipe and pick it up there the pressure would be at the bottom of it trying to find a little crevice to leak its way through that's like the pressure of the Holy Spirit trying to come down on every life that pipe that pipe if you would take that pipe now these these facts have been checked and you would take that pipe You' take all that listen that pipe would go that would go 722 trillion 119 billion 335 million 227,000 light years away and it would have a pressure of one quillion 650 quadrillion 938 trillion 110 billion PSI Glory that's how bad want God wants to give you the Holy Ghost thank you Lord I I said I showed this slide one time in the church and brother piped up in the crown and goes well that go right through me I'm like no it wouldn't with an attitude like that it won't go through you that's right no it won't the Holy Ghost won't go through not a vessel like that with all that pressure friends there's one thing that keeps with all that pressure we can't listen friends we can't fathom the PSI there but one thing can block all of that and that's your will it's your will cuz God it's his word listen he said he wants to give you the Holy Ghost he wants you to be happy he wants you to have full Joy amen it's stronger than any well that's that's just our family makeup it's stronger than your family makeup yes sir listen friends it it's stronger than anything but the problem of it is it's our will amen it's our hurts we we could we could been hurt way back Yonder and because we was hurt we can shut down from the presence of God but listen that's what the presence is for is to bring healing but it can only heal if you'll allow him to heal praise the Lord the Bible says this for God had not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel According to the power of God who have saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world ever began when was it given to you man it was his own purpose and Grace and he gave it to you before the world ever was he says but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ so do you understand what I'm saying see how many knows I'm talking about they all you know you know message people can have all the quotes lined out but no joy yeah they have all they have all the head knowledge but bitter they have all the head knowledge but resentful have all the head knowledge but are miserable and and so and so yes that is all true before the world but there has to come a manifestation of it in our own lives I'm not I'm not talking about work up friends but listen I'm just emotional amen I'll be honest because I'm alive yeah I'm alive and that that's and I want to reiterate please come back tonight not for me not for my glory but but I want you to understand it'll give you an insight to what Christ had to deal with on Earth so that you can understand what you go through as human beings with your emotions because we're emotional creatures but we also have to enter into the service we all play A Part friends all of us play a part in the house of God and I'll be honest with you I need I need your amen some preach I you know I'll come out and preach well oh they may be able to but I'll be honest with you I need them I do I Don't Preach for them but I need them because it's all of us all of us together friends it it that's how God designed it you know brother Braham said this and and he said uh and don't I'm not telling you I feel a resentment spirit so please don't take this personal brother Bram said that he could come out and he he could pray and fast and study he said and he maybe even under the anointing almost his exact words and he said come out and feel that resenting Spirit he said the holy spirit is grieved it just won't move amen and I'm not saying please don't take I'm not saying you're resenting but what I'm telling you is this if brother brandham had that problem what what would uh what would uh uh uh us just not even enter in or I'm just tired I'm I'm wore out I'm in a bad mood what would that do to the service you understand what I'm saying and and we may blame it on the preacher and go W he must he must not have studied he must had off and it could be two-thirds of the congregation to sleep amen and they'll never get to blame the preacher will amen that's right friends it's true it's right but God knows God knows friends that's exactly right God knows all about it and and so you know don't get me wrong I realiz you know uh uh oh my I'm going a little long but but listen listen you know you I I'll give you a testimony Hallelujah it was uh it was back home and I was preaching uh I was preaching a message called blessed all your eyes and brother I'll be honest with you God give it to me yes it was beautiful I be not because of me preaching it but just what God give me and you know what and I'll be honest with you a great portion of the church is you couldn't squeak an amen out of and and you know what it it really hurt me it hurt me because I wasn't rebuking it was an it was an uplifting message was there hard things yeah for those that that it fit but you understand what I'm saying Hey Brother sometimes when it's when it's cutting me I amen just as loud amen amen I do cuz I'm saying yes Lord I need that I'm saying yes Lord I'm making a mistake that's me hallelujah praise the Lord Hey Brother Brooks preached back home a couple weeks ago and I read I was ready to crawl on need the pull pit I had to come up there and then officiate the service

been in the house of God people's rejoicing and you're miserable been there he think Lord why why is the anointing fall on everybody else and I I feel like like a duck W the present falling all over and it's just rolling off me ain't even anointing me and so we go through those things but listen just make sure it's only for a season yeah amen if you can if you can just come to the house of God and never get blessed and something's wrong friends and I don't say that to criticize y'all say that to help you because there ought to be joy in the presence of God you ought to have be happy amen now listen I'm not talking about I'm not talking about United States happy joking and josling I'm talking about joy of the Lord in your soul I'm not talking about an American Spirit I'm talking about the Holy Spirit that's right that's right he says our sa he says he says uh and hath brought us brought life and immortality to light through the go goel Jesus called us friends to have life and to have it more abundantly and if you look at that Abundant Life it actually means to have an advantag God gave us not only life but he gave us an advantage over life and we've got friends we've got many benefits the Bible tells us not to forget them and that word benefit actually means it be an advantage or profit gained from something we've got we've got advantages and we've got benefits this

when I was unlovable he loved when you when you was unlovable but he changed you like the color sister said that time in her testimony I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be then I'm not what I used to to be she know she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in you he's seen something he's seen something in me he seen something in you he had a reason to save you
