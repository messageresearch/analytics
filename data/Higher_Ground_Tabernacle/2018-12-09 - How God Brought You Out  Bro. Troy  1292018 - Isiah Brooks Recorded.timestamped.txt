[36:38] a man how did God bring you out him in
[36:42] Exodus chapter 13 will read 17th and
[36:48] 18th verse sir and it says and it came
[36:53] to pass when Pharaoh had let the people
[36:56] go that God led them not through the way
[37:01] of the land of the Philistines although
[37:04] that was near for God said lest
[37:08] peradventure the people repent when they
[37:11] see war and they return to Egypt but God
[37:16] led the people about through the way of
[37:18] the wilderness of the Red Sea and the
[37:22] children of Israel went up harnessed out
[37:24] of the land of Egypt Amen now let's go
[37:28] to the next chapter / chapter 14 well
[37:34] start in the 13th verse
[37:43] actually we're gonna start with the
[37:45] first verse it says and the Lord spake
[37:51] unto Moses saying speak unto the
[37:54] children of Israel that they turn and
[37:56] encamped on earth between megalo and the
[38:02] sea over against bales of phone before
[38:04] it show you encamped by the seat for the
[38:08] Lord for Pharaoh shall say of the
[38:10] children of Israel they are entangled in
[38:13] the land and the wilderness has shut
[38:15] them in and I'll harden Pharaoh's heart
[38:18] he shall follow after them I'll be
[38:21] honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his
[38:24] hosts and the Egyptians may know that I
[38:27] am the Lord and they did so Amen let's
[38:30] just bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[38:33] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[38:36] as we gather here the sworn and memorial
[38:38] father
[38:39] how you died upon the cross of Calvary
[38:42] for us Lord and you rose again Lord
[38:45] delivering us from all of our sins
[38:47] father Lord you washed us in your own
[38:49] blood father and you have chosen us from
[38:52] all all the people of this world Lord
[38:55] and Lord because of this great act that
[38:57] you have done on Calvary father we
[39:00] gather this morning and honor Lord of
[39:02] you and the price that you pay Lord
[39:05] believing Lord and your sacrifice and
[39:07] that your blood have saved us from our
[39:09] sins and that you have gone to prepare a
[39:11] place for us father that we do not have
[39:14] hope in this life only father but Lord
[39:17] that no matter what happens to us upon
[39:19] this life's journey father but that you
[39:21] have already passed over to the other
[39:23] side Lord and gone and paved the way
[39:25] before us Lord Lord and gone to prepare
[39:28] a place for his father that when these
[39:30] eyes closed for the last time father
[39:33] upon this earth that will open them
[39:35] again on the other side in glory Lord
[39:37] and behold that which you have been
[39:40] creating for us Lord Lord of a new
[39:43] heavens and a new earth father wherein
[39:45] dwelleth righteousness and Lord we thank
[39:47] you for that promise Lord and that is
[39:50] why we spend our lives trusting in you
[39:52] Lord and that's why we have gathered
[39:54] here this morning amen
[39:56] Morial father of the price that you have
[39:58] paid and knowing the promise Lord that
[40:00] you said to us that you gave to us that
[40:03] wherever two or three are gathered
[40:05] together in my name I will come into
[40:08] that room and be right there in the
[40:10] midst of them and so father we always
[40:12] want to thank you and invite you in this
[40:13] morning Lord and thank you for coming to
[40:16] this church service Lord we pray that
[40:18] you would have your way upon every heart
[40:20] here together this morning that every
[40:22] heart may know that you are the Living
[40:24] God and that you are not dead but you
[40:26] still are alive and remaining Lord and
[40:28] that you're here about the the people's
[40:31] business father and lord I just pray
[40:34] Lord as we turn the service over into
[40:36] your hands father that you would have
[40:38] your own way this morning and the name
[40:40] of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you
[40:44] can be seated
[40:48] one thing that marvels me about this
[40:52] story about the children of Israel at
[40:55] the Red Sea is that God told them
[41:01] beforehand where to go what to do and
[41:07] the way that he was gonna bring them
[41:09] even now he didn't tell them everything
[41:12] but he did tell them go stand by the way
[41:16] of the Red Sea don't go the easy road
[41:19] don't go over this way you know but go
[41:23] the word to the very place where I am
[41:25] Telling You and then he also tells them
[41:28] and that Pharaoh is going to follow you
[41:30] and you will be trapped there by the Red
[41:33] Sea but don't worry when you get there I
[41:37] will be there and I will be honored upon
[41:40] your enemies amen and I will deliver you
[41:44] from your enemies so when they got to
[41:46] the Red Sea it was no surprise
[41:49] amen it was no surprise he had told them
[41:53] beforehand I'm not going to take you up
[41:55] by the easy way but I am going to take
[41:57] you down through the wilderness to a
[42:00] place where there's hills on both sides
[42:02] that you cannot climb over to a place
[42:04] where the Red Sea is cutting you off
[42:06] from the front and the Pharaohs army
[42:08] will be cutting you off from the
[42:09] so I'm bringing to a place where you
[42:11] will be completely boxed in so that I
[42:15] can bring you out of Egypt with a mighty
[42:17] hand amen you know and that's the you
[42:20] know that's how God really wants to
[42:22] bring his people if any man is ever
[42:26] going to come to the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:27] from salvation he wants to bring you out
[42:30] by a mighty hand if God is ever going to
[42:35] save you if God is ever going to deliver
[42:38] you if God is ever going to do anything
[42:40] for you he wants to give you some type
[42:42] of a token amen something that you can
[42:45] look at something you can have something
[42:47] you can hold on to a testimony of some
[42:50] source to where you are brought up to
[42:52] the decision line amen
[42:57] every man that is ever going to be a
[42:59] Christian has to come to that point
[43:01] where you were brought to your wits in
[43:04] Amite you were brought to the point
[43:07] where you could realize you could no
[43:10] longer do things for yourself you know
[43:15] there's a reason why they were crying
[43:17] unto Moses saying we shouldn't stay neat
[43:19] chipped the reason was is because every
[43:23] single nerve and fiber of their natural
[43:25] being was realizing that they were
[43:28] completely lost unless God would save
[43:31] them and God did that on purpose and
[43:36] told them about it beforehand I am NOT
[43:39] gonna bring you about the easy way I'm
[43:41] not gonna bring you about through the
[43:43] wood land of the Philistines I'm gonna
[43:45] bring you to a place where you can't
[43:48] solve this by your own natural thoughts
[43:50] you can't solve this by your own natural
[43:52] Beach you know here in America we're
[43:54] good at being resourceful and solving
[43:56] our own problems you know here in the
[43:59] United States we like to think that we
[44:01] pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps
[44:02] we like to think that we can take care
[44:05] of ourselves that we can handle all of
[44:08] our own problems
[44:09] you know the we're resourceful people
[44:11] you know we like to think that we're
[44:13] rich and and we can do all these things
[44:15] you know but sometimes God has to bring
[44:17] you to a place to knock you off your
[44:20] high horse and
[44:21] realize that you need him you know and
[44:25] really no man can come unto Christ
[44:30] unless God has brought you to that place
[44:34] you know you can play around you can
[44:36] come to church you can think you have a
[44:38] church walk and all that but if God has
[44:40] never he brought you to the Red Sea yeah
[44:43] you haven't come out of Egypt yet you
[44:47] think oh no I'm part of the church you
[44:50] haven't even come out of Egypt yet I
[44:52] think about it God when he went to bring
[44:56] them out of Egypt says I am gonna bring
[44:58] them out with a mighty hand and so if
[45:04] you think that you came out of eat out
[45:06] of Egypt and it was pretty easy for you
[45:08] then did you come out of Egypt seriously
[45:15] Amen God wanted to bring them up out of
[45:17] Egypt with a mighty hint Amen and we all
[45:21] of us have to have our own testimony how
[45:24] did God bring you out now we trust in
[45:30] the Lord Jesus Christ for saving us from
[45:32] our sins have you been saved from your
[45:35] sins well that's a good question you
[45:39] know it's one thing to say it but really
[45:41] has God saved you from your sins it's
[45:44] one thing to just mentally say you know
[45:46] well God delivered me but when you look
[45:49] at the natural state of your life has
[45:51] God actually delivered you well that's a
[45:55] good question
[45:55] as God saved you from your sins because
[45:59] you see many people that live in the
[46:01] church that go to church day in and day
[46:02] out but they're still in their sins how
[46:05] can that person say that they came out
[46:06] of Egypt how can that person that walks
[46:09] in their sins day in day out day in day
[46:11] out actually have a testimony and say
[46:13] God has saved me for my sins well your
[46:16] own sins are testifying against you that
[46:18] God didn't save you from your sins every
[46:21] man every boy every girl you know like a
[46:24] robe and said you know God doesn't have
[46:26] any grandchildren
[46:27] he's only got children you know every
[46:30] child a teenager growing up grows up in
[46:33] the church they have
[46:34] come to their own decision line to that
[46:36] great striving in their own mind where
[46:39] they begin to realize I need to be safe
[46:42] for my sins I need my own deliverance I
[46:45] need my own hope you know we're not
[46:48] gonna live forever now a teenager might
[46:49] say well I'm gonna live another 60 70
[46:51] years or so but someday you got to die
[46:55] but there is a promise for you there is
[46:59] a promise for you that when you close
[47:01] your eyes on this earth for the last
[47:03] time that if you trust in the Lord Jesus
[47:08] Christ for the salvation of your sins
[47:11] that if you close your eyes here for the
[47:14] last time you'll open them there in
[47:16] glory and he will receive you and you
[47:19] have a promise to live with him for all
[47:22] of eternity
[47:23] that's quite a promise there's no
[47:27] insurance policy in the world that can
[47:28] deliver such a promise that's the basic
[47:31] that's a basic message verse one that
[47:34] all the children need to hear our God is
[47:37] here to save us from our sins our sins
[47:39] say that we need to be dragged down to
[47:41] hell amen what God's salvation says I
[47:46] have made a way for you but every man
[47:49] let every man have his own testimony
[47:53] every person and every member of the
[47:56] bride and Lord Jesus Christ have
[47:58] something that they're holding on to
[48:00] something that God has done for them
[48:02] something that they can say that I know
[48:03] that my God has brought me out if you
[48:07] don't have that testimony then let me
[48:09] tell you God you may not have come out
[48:11] of Egypt yet amen but all of us has to
[48:15] come to a certain point in our lives
[48:17] where we're always we can't do it on our
[48:19] own and that's what God was doing here
[48:22] to the children of Israel he brought
[48:24] them out of Egypt by a mighty hand he
[48:27] led them to a place where they couldn't
[48:29] climb the mountains they couldn't cross
[48:31] the Red Sea and they couldn't defeat the
[48:33] army behind them I didn't think I felt
[48:36] to be Moses I think I felt pretty good
[48:41] you know I you know me
[48:44] the Sun of Israel were a little worried
[48:45] a little concerned but there's one thing
[48:48] that Moses is is that he knew the power
[48:51] of Almighty God because in reality he
[48:54] had already been through the Red Sea he
[48:58] went through the Red Sea at the burning
[48:59] bush amen when God when God sent there
[49:05] when he when he when he submitted
[49:07] himself to the one in the burning bush
[49:10] he was already going through his Red Sea
[49:12] experience amen
[49:14] when he decided yes Lord I will follow
[49:16] you all the days of my life
[49:18] wherever you sent me I will go what was
[49:20] he doing he was having his own
[49:22] experience and what was new that same
[49:24] burning bush experience God the God that
[49:27] talked to him the same God went in him
[49:31] amen so when he came down to the Red Sea
[49:33] at the children of Israel he wasn't
[49:35] scared he wasn't concerned he knew what
[49:37] his god was capable of amen he knew what
[49:41] his God was capable of all he had to do
[49:43] is go talk to the one that had been with
[49:45] them all along and so is it with every
[49:48] Christian that's ever had the experience
[49:50] how can anything trouble you how can
[49:52] anything scare you how can anything make
[49:55] you afraid when all you I do is just
[49:57] close your eyes for you since a few
[49:59] seconds amen and you will be in the
[50:01] presence of the one that has always been
[50:03] with you amen how can you ever be
[50:05] troubled how can you ever be afraid
[50:06] because you're going to talk to the one
[50:09] that's always been with you take me to
[50:15] any Red Sea anywhere take me to the
[50:17] River Jordan take me to the enemy take
[50:19] me to the mountains take me anywhere
[50:21] anywhere you can take me just give me a
[50:23] few moments with my lord and I know I
[50:26] everything will be all right
[50:28] Amen cuz let me tell you all I gotta do
[50:30] is just close my eyes I'll be in the
[50:33] presence of the Almighty God because he
[50:36] said I will never leave you nor forsake
[50:38] you oh I'll be with you until the end of
[50:40] the world so what does it matter what
[50:43] what what what can man do unto me I've
[50:47] already been through it all
[50:48] I are I've already been through the test
[50:50] I've already been to the trial I've seen
[50:52] what my God is capable of you know I've
[50:54] seen him with the ten plagues in Egypt
[50:57] Amen I've seen him turing the frogs I've
[51:01] seen him bring the lice I've see him
[51:02] bring the blood I see him kill all the
[51:04] firstborn I've seen all the gods capable
[51:07] of and now I know that the Red Sea is
[51:09] nothing Buzz's was not afraid he knew
[51:14] exactly what God has said he was
[51:16] standing in there in complete faith he
[51:18] may not know exactly what God was gonna
[51:19] do but he knew God was gonna do it a
[51:22] manner that's how it is with every man
[51:24] that has his own testimony he's seeing
[51:27] what God is capable of he's seen what
[51:29] God can do in his own life amen what'd
[51:32] he do he took God at his own word he saw
[51:35] that God was capable amen and now that
[51:37] man has the testimony and let me tell
[51:39] you you can never lose that testimony
[51:42] let every man have his own testimony
[51:46] amen an entire event the Red Sea
[51:51] experience was orchestrated by God so
[51:54] the people all the people would have an
[51:58] experience where they would first hear
[52:02] what God said to them and then see God
[52:05] bring it to pass
[52:08] Amen that's a good thing to have first
[52:12] you see what God said and then you watch
[52:15] and bring it to pass so God said I am
[52:18] going to lead you to a place where you
[52:21] are gonna be trapped by your enemies and
[52:23] then your enemies are gonna see me save
[52:26] you that's a good thing and here's how
[52:35] Moses is staying in there the two
[52:37] million is Israelite standing there
[52:40] they're trapped by the red seat and all
[52:42] sudden here comes the thundering of
[52:44] Pharaoh's army they're trapped the dust
[52:49] is being kicked up there here in the the
[52:51] the the pounding of the hooves of the of
[52:54] the chariots and they know that they're
[52:57] in trouble but Moses knows he's getting
[53:00] ready to see the power of Almighty God
[53:04] amen the ones that didn't have a
[53:07] testimony knew that they were in trouble
[53:09] but the
[53:11] that did have a testimony new they're
[53:13] getting ready to see the power of
[53:14] Almighty God and that is the difference
[53:17] between those that have a testimony and
[53:19] those that do not have a testimony
[53:20] they're all in the same trouble they're
[53:23] all in the same circumstance they're all
[53:25] the same thing but the one knows the
[53:27] power of God and the one does not know
[53:29] the power of God and there is the
[53:32] difference between those that know the
[53:36] power of God and those that do not know
[53:38] the power of God so let me ask you which
[53:44] one are you are you the one that knows
[53:48] the power of God are you the one that
[53:51] doesn't know the power of God because
[53:54] all of us are in one camp or the other
[53:56] right now it's one amen let's turn over
[54:02] to the first Corinthians chapter 4 Paul
[54:14] here makes it a statement that I just I
[54:21] just love it
[54:22] 1st Corinthians
[54:24] after for the last two chapters or last
[54:32] two verses of this chapter of verses 19
[54:34] and 20 two of the last three what Paul
[54:41] says here in verse 19 and 20 Jesus
[54:46] Christ is saying the same thing the very
[54:51] words that st. Paul says here Jesus
[54:54] Christ is also saying to us hey man
[54:57] let's read 1st Corinthians 4 19 but I
[55:03] will come to you shortly if the Lord
[55:05] will and will know not the speech of
[55:10] them that are puffed up but the power
[55:12] for the kingdom of God is not in word
[55:16] but in power Paul here is saying I'm
[55:21] going to come visit you pretty soon I'm
[55:24] going to come to your church and I'm
[55:28] gonna find out who here is speaking and
[55:33] what power they're speaking under I'm
[55:37] gonna come I'm going to talk to every
[55:38] one of you amen and I'm gonna find out
[55:41] the power that you are living under are
[55:44] you living underneath the power of God
[55:46] or are you living underneath your own
[55:47] power because there's something going on
[55:50] in your church that I don't understand
[55:52] there's something going on in this body
[55:54] of believers of the Corinthians that I'm
[55:56] not quiet you are a sylph carnal and I
[55:58] don't understand why so I'm gonna come
[56:00] I'm gonna find out what power you're
[56:02] operating under because I can't tell if
[56:05] you've been delivered from Egypt or not
[56:07] Amen well that's a that's a powerful
[56:13] little statement wonder what would
[56:15] happen if he came to our church this
[56:17] morning I'm gonna find out who here has
[56:21] been delivered out of Egypt and who here
[56:23] is still living in their sins because
[56:25] God came to deliver us from our sins
[56:27] that's the very basics of the gospel God
[56:30] came to save us from our sins we've been
[56:34] here that we we hear that in Sunday
[56:36] school
[56:37] but there is a great reality of that
[56:39] that we all have to experience and have
[56:41] a testimony and be able to share that
[56:43] testimony with others I think like I
[56:47] said last Sunday all I will never forget
[56:49] the first time I went witnessing
[56:51] door-to-door and I realized I didn't
[56:57] have a testimony but because the
[57:01] denominational church that I went to
[57:03] said it was a good thing for me to do
[57:05] and going witness door-to-door and so
[57:09] two or three of us went knocking
[57:10] door-to-door to share Christ what we had
[57:13] memorized from the Scriptures and I went
[57:16] and the first door I went to I was
[57:18] getting a little scared because I began
[57:22] to realize that I did not have my own
[57:24] testimony I had heard about Christ I had
[57:28] read about Christ I had read about all
[57:31] the things that Jesus had done I had
[57:32] write about what he had done here on the
[57:35] earth and I knew a lot of scriptures and
[57:37] I gone to church every day of my life
[57:39] since I was a baby and but for all of
[57:41] that I had not yet experienced the power
[57:43] of God in my own life how could I share
[57:46] Christ with whoever was is getting ready
[57:48] to open that door and what about you
[57:53] amen have you been delivered from Egypt
[57:55] or not have you been saved from your
[57:58] sins the very basics of the gospel that
[58:01] we all know from Sunday school that we
[58:03] know that we need to have we know what
[58:05] there's coming a Judgment Day we know
[58:06] that one day we all stand before the
[58:08] throne amen to give account for what
[58:10] we've done with our lives here on earth
[58:12] amen to know whether we have the blood
[58:14] of Christ upon upon our house or not
[58:16] whether we have truly experienced the
[58:18] Passover or not whether Jesus's blood
[58:21] actually benefits and can we tell others
[58:25] about it but if we do not have a
[58:28] testimony that Jesus Christ has saved us
[58:30] from our sins then how or why are we
[58:33] here
[58:34] and why did you part those curtains this
[58:37] morning amen
[58:40] what are we doing here amen the very
[58:42] basics of salvation what are you doing
[58:46] with your experience amen
[58:50] and if you're not telling people that
[58:52] Jesus Christ to save you from your sins
[58:54] let's examine the motives of why you're
[58:56] not talking about it now think about it
[59:00] what are the motives that you have in
[59:02] your life for why you cannot talk about
[59:04] your salvation for many is because they
[59:10] don't have it they say they go they
[59:13] attend church or not they think about it
[59:17] it sounds like a good thing to have but
[59:19] they've never actually been driven to
[59:21] that Red Sea experience to where us be
[59:26] saved or lost and you know the thing
[59:28] about it is as only God can do that for
[59:30] you you know really no man could come
[59:34] unto Christ unless Christ draws him
[59:36] first
[59:37] and that's what God was doing God drew
[59:39] them to the Red Sea and every single one
[59:42] of us has to get to that same point to
[59:44] where we begin to realize we need Christ
[59:46] I need I need to be safe for my sins not
[59:55] just a mental salvation but I need to be
[59:58] delivered from these things that are
[59:59] more powerful than I am I need to be
[1:00:02] delivered from the things that I can't
[1:00:04] control
[1:00:04] maybe deliver from the passions of my
[1:00:06] own life you know when I want to do
[1:00:08] right I do wrong I need to be delivered
[1:00:10] from that I need to be saved for my sins
[1:00:12] and it brings a Red Sea experience to
[1:00:17] where you realize you can all longer do
[1:00:19] it yourself and now you know yes when
[1:00:22] you bow down before Almighty God and say
[1:00:24] oh lord save me for my sins every man
[1:00:27] must have that testimony that they reach
[1:00:31] their wit's end that they that they left
[1:00:34] Egypt and everything behind amen
[1:00:37] as soon as they left Egypt they
[1:00:39] celebrated a Passover they killed a lamb
[1:00:45] amen and they experienced the blood in
[1:00:48] their own house that's what as soon as
[1:00:52] you leave Egypt God has to get you out
[1:00:54] of Egypt so he can bring you to the
[1:00:56] blood of Lord Jesus Christ and from the
[1:00:58] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he brings
[1:01:00] you right down to the baptism right down
[1:01:02] to a baptism where
[1:01:04] are you going to go through the Red Sea
[1:01:05] are you going to testify to this world
[1:01:07] that you are dead to the things in the
[1:01:09] past and you are alive under Christ
[1:01:11] Jesus it's the very basics of salvation
[1:01:16] that's why we're baptized you're
[1:01:19] literally leaving it all behind and
[1:01:22] you're telling the whole world I'm done
[1:01:24] with the things of Egypt and I'm alive
[1:01:26] under Christ Jesus amen
[1:01:31] that entire event was orchestrated by
[1:01:34] God step-by-step to bring his people up
[1:01:39] out of Egypt by a mighty powerful hand
[1:01:42] so that when they left Egypt they would
[1:01:44] know I'm not leaving Egypt it's just
[1:01:46] because I'm thinking I should leave
[1:01:48] Egypt but I'm leaving Egypt because my
[1:01:51] God is pulling me out of Egypt amen and
[1:01:54] as I'm being pulled out of Egypt I got a
[1:01:57] go by the blood of the Lamb amen and I
[1:02:00] got a follow Moses all the way to the
[1:02:03] Red Sea and then I got to testify to all
[1:02:06] of my enemies that I'm being delivered
[1:02:10] so that my enemies know that the God
[1:02:14] that is saving me is more powerful than
[1:02:16] they are
[1:02:18] amen amen now and now God gave them a
[1:02:23] promise right there at the Red Sea you
[1:02:25] know what he gave them as they are being
[1:02:26] surrounded by their enemies the
[1:02:29] Egyptians at the Red Sea when Pharaoh's
[1:02:31] army was coming up God gave them a
[1:02:32] promise he said these enemies that you
[1:02:36] see here this day you'll never see them
[1:02:39] again I am going to deliver you from
[1:02:43] these enemies you will never see them
[1:02:48] again
[1:02:51] think about that this is right before
[1:02:54] their baptism the New Testament says
[1:02:57] that they are baptized in the Red Sea
[1:02:59] and the Moses just like we are baptized
[1:03:02] in water unto Jesus Christ Lord Jesus
[1:03:05] Christ and those enemies that you leave
[1:03:08] behind you will never see them again you
[1:03:11] are saved from your sins think about it
[1:03:16] you've been to
[1:03:17] livered you're set free no wonder Moses
[1:03:21] danced upon the red seashore
[1:03:25] as soon as that red sea came crashing
[1:03:29] back together after they passed over to
[1:03:31] the other side
[1:03:32] Moses jumped up on the riverbank and he
[1:03:36] started dancing and singing praises unto
[1:03:39] his God Miriam went and she grabbed a
[1:03:42] tambourine as she started dancing with
[1:03:44] them because they realized they'd been
[1:03:50] saved from their enemy completely 100
[1:03:54] percent delivered from their sins
[1:03:55] delivered from those the enemy that
[1:03:58] would get killed him delivered from the
[1:04:00] enemy that would enslave them and what
[1:04:03] was their focus to be after that
[1:04:04] entering into all the promises of God
[1:04:09] we're like I said where are you this
[1:04:11] morning
[1:04:13] amen from that time forward as soon as
[1:04:17] that Red Sea crashed before it as soon
[1:04:19] as they were done rejoicing they turned
[1:04:22] around and their eyes were focused upon
[1:04:25] entering into every single promise of
[1:04:27] Jehovah what a focus amen
[1:04:49] you know it's something about confidence
[1:04:51] now when you go through that process you
[1:04:55] now have such a confidence and your Lord
[1:05:00] and Savior and no matter what comes upon
[1:05:04] you on your life's journey you believe
[1:05:08] him because you've seen him save you
[1:05:10] from so much that is a man that has a
[1:05:13] testimony of a full salvation you've
[1:05:17] seen God at that point you've seen God
[1:05:20] do so much now think about what if God
[1:05:23] had not led them through the Red Sea
[1:05:24] there was an easier way he could have
[1:05:28] just led them through the land of the
[1:05:29] Philistines but he says I will not do it
[1:05:32] he says we were headed there he says if
[1:05:35] I leave them to the land of Philistines
[1:05:36] they'll just be a way of war and they'll
[1:05:39] be afraid and turn back to Egypt but I
[1:05:42] have to first bring them through the Red
[1:05:43] Sea experience so that they do not go
[1:05:47] through the war without seeing the power
[1:05:48] of God first now they were gonna come to
[1:05:52] war no matter what they were coming to
[1:05:55] war no matter what they were gonna have
[1:05:56] to fight their way to the promises of
[1:05:58] God amen but they but God had a plan
[1:06:01] that instead of bringing them through
[1:06:03] the land of the Philistines or the first
[1:06:07] Scripture we read there he says I'm
[1:06:09] gonna bring him this way to the Red Sea
[1:06:10] so they'll see my power first because
[1:06:16] once they see my power they can go
[1:06:18] through anything as soon as they've seen
[1:06:23] my power then I know that they can go
[1:06:25] through up to meet the enemy face to
[1:06:28] face and not turn tail running scared
[1:06:30] back to Egypt so God had a process I'm
[1:06:36] going to bring them through to a place
[1:06:38] where they see my power first then they
[1:06:41] can meet the enemy that's why every
[1:06:44] Christian must follow the same process
[1:06:47] every Christian must go through the same
[1:06:50] process and know that the the same God
[1:06:54] that saved them brings you to your own
[1:06:56] Red Sea experience so that you can be
[1:07:00] saved from your sins so
[1:07:03] you go about going and heading towards
[1:07:06] the promises of God that you know that
[1:07:08] no matter what enemy you meet along the
[1:07:10] way that you will you will see victory
[1:07:13] over your enemy why because God that
[1:07:16] saved you is the same God that's going
[1:07:18] before you i'm era when we went to
[1:07:24] Guyana South America this last trip and
[1:07:30] we were there in the capital city and we
[1:07:33] are getting ready to go down south into
[1:07:35] the jungle areas interior regions and we
[1:07:40] were going to go to a village that
[1:07:43] nobody we they hadn't heard this message
[1:07:46] before you know when we didn't know
[1:07:50] exactly what this was gonna be a new
[1:07:53] experience we didn't know what it was
[1:07:54] gonna be follow us along the way you
[1:07:56] know and it was about a 10-hour bus
[1:07:59] right and then from there was about an 8
[1:08:00] hour boat ride downriver to get to this
[1:08:04] little place but there before we even
[1:08:07] left we we got down and we prayed and
[1:08:10] there was one of us that prayed a
[1:08:12] certain prayer that I'll never forget
[1:08:14] and the man said lord I pray that you
[1:08:19] would go before us and prepare the way
[1:08:23] every step of the way before we go well
[1:08:28] that's a pretty good prayer that sounds
[1:08:32] like a good way to go doesn't it that
[1:08:33] God would go before us before we even
[1:08:36] get there so no matter where we go we
[1:08:39] know that God is leading the way before
[1:08:41] us why because we asked him to we asked
[1:08:45] them to and you know we've seen God
[1:08:47] things do things for us in the past so
[1:08:49] we have a confidence that he'll do
[1:08:51] things for us in the future that's a
[1:08:54] good way to be
[1:08:54] amen amen so as we got to the first
[1:08:58] village you know there was some people
[1:09:03] there that didn't want us there and so
[1:09:06] we had to go hold our services out
[1:09:08] underneath out in the open there was an
[1:09:11] established church there is nice block
[1:09:14] Church and a roof on it but some people
[1:09:16] didn't want us
[1:09:17] but there are people were coming they
[1:09:19] wanted to get baptized and so even
[1:09:23] though the church wouldn't let us in we
[1:09:24] went had Church anyway amen
[1:09:27] and so we went and we we had a nice
[1:09:30] baptismal service and baptized about
[1:09:32] twenty people had a nice church service
[1:09:35] and had a good time one of the men that
[1:09:40] was baptized said I want to go with you
[1:09:42] the rest the way and so there was gonna
[1:09:47] be six of us going to the next village
[1:09:49] but now there's seven a mint so and so
[1:09:53] well we say why don't you come on along
[1:09:55] and so he got in the boat with us and it
[1:09:58] was about eight or ten hour boat ride
[1:09:59] downriver we got to the next village we
[1:10:03] went to the chief of the village we
[1:10:04] asked permission to come into his
[1:10:06] village and and to have some services
[1:10:10] and he said okay you can have the
[1:10:12] community hall and you can have your
[1:10:13] services and as we were walking around
[1:10:17] the village that day waiting for service
[1:10:19] time a lady came up to that man that had
[1:10:23] just been baptized and she said I saw
[1:10:27] all of you in a dream last about two
[1:10:30] nights ago and I knew you were coming
[1:10:33] and I want to know where your service is
[1:10:36] going to be held at so two nights before
[1:10:40] we got there God gave this woman a dream
[1:10:43] and show it all seven of us even the man
[1:10:46] that hadn't been baptized yet but
[1:10:51] there's gonna be a church service and
[1:10:52] you should go to it well in these seven
[1:10:55] men arrive I want you to go with him to
[1:10:58] church amen
[1:11:01] God went before us so when it gets to a
[1:11:06] point to where you've seen God do so
[1:11:08] much you just have a confidence in him
[1:11:11] but no matter what comes upon your
[1:11:13] life's journey they you know he's going
[1:11:16] to deliver you again and again and again
[1:11:19] and again and every Christian ought to
[1:11:21] have that's not just for the ministry
[1:11:23] it's not just for the pastor it's not
[1:11:25] just for the Evangelist but it's for
[1:11:27] every member of the body of the Lord
[1:11:29] Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] that they didn't come to God in weakness
[1:11:33] but they came to God in power and that
[1:11:35] they knew that their God will say the
[1:11:37] same amount of Egypt will continue to
[1:11:39] deliver them and go before them all the
[1:11:41] days of their life when Jesus gave that
[1:11:45] promise I will go before you I will be
[1:11:47] with you even in you until the end of
[1:11:49] the age that promise was not just to the
[1:11:51] ministry amen but that promise was to
[1:11:54] every member of the body of the Lord
[1:11:56] Jesus Christ amen that's a promise for
[1:12:00] you and if you've been delivered out of
[1:12:03] Egypt that promise is for you amen let
[1:12:07] every man have his own testimony about
[1:12:10] how our God is an awesome God but how
[1:12:13] our God still lives and reigns but how
[1:12:15] our God that you can tell others about
[1:12:18] you know that's how I like to witness
[1:12:21] I've never been good at memorizing
[1:12:24] scriptures you know I don't have a very
[1:12:27] good memory and let me tell you if the
[1:12:31] Spirit of the Living God does not anoint
[1:12:33] me I would be hard-pressed sometimes
[1:12:35] they'd even be able to quote John 3:16
[1:12:38] I'm just being honest with you my memory
[1:12:41] just doesn't work that way but when the
[1:12:43] spirit of the Living God does come upon
[1:12:46] me I have every scripture that I have
[1:12:49] ever read in my entire life available at
[1:12:51] my disposal that's the difference
[1:12:55] between just being a natural man and a
[1:12:58] man filled with the Holy Spirit of the
[1:13:00] Living God and he gets to the point to
[1:13:03] where I'm not resting upon my own
[1:13:05] memorization of scriptures by am resting
[1:13:07] upon the Holy Spirit that wrote the
[1:13:09] scriptures to be able to bring the
[1:13:12] testimony there's something about being
[1:13:16] a witness of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:13:20] Christ when you can testify to the
[1:13:23] people something that God has done for
[1:13:26] you that they can look at that and say
[1:13:29] that's God
[1:13:35] God did that that's a good thing for a
[1:13:39] Christian to have now not all of us are
[1:13:42] gonna work miracles not all of us are
[1:13:44] going to do things but we will all be
[1:13:46] around the miracle working God and God
[1:13:48] will work miracles in your life amen why
[1:13:51] brother Ram said healing is the
[1:13:54] children's bread healing is the
[1:13:58] children's bread he is our first doctor
[1:14:00] it's not that I don't believe in doctors
[1:14:02] but Jesus Christ is our first doctor
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:08] we got to give God a chance to be
[1:14:10] powerful in or a lot if he's delivered
[1:14:13] you from your sins if he's delivered you
[1:14:15] out of Egypt so why don't you go and
[1:14:17] trust him for the other things so you
[1:14:20] can have some testimonies that you can
[1:14:23] bring to the lost so that they might
[1:14:25] know that Jesus Christ is still alive
[1:14:27] that he still remains God amen and allow
[1:14:31] God to be your deliverer and stead of
[1:14:33] just being an American that's self
[1:14:35] sufficient amen that's a good way to be
[1:14:40] because we all get to these places in
[1:14:42] our lives where we could we're all
[1:14:45] sudden realize we can't do it ourselves
[1:14:47] and we need our God God orchestrates
[1:14:53] those times in your life why so he can
[1:14:56] be powerful in your life amen amen
[1:15:06] you know Paul said in Romans 8:26 he
[1:15:13] says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[1:15:16] our infirmities for we know not what we
[1:15:20] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:15:24] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:15:26] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:15:28] we don't always know how to pray but the
[1:15:32] Spirit our self inside ourselves is
[1:15:34] praying for us that's Romans 8:26 a
[1:15:38] 20:27 says and he that searches the
[1:15:41] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[1:15:44] Spirit because he makes intercession for
[1:15:47] the Saints a core
[1:15:49] to the will of God isn't it great to be
[1:15:51] in the will of God how would you like to
[1:15:53] be in the will of God amen
[1:15:56] verse 28 and we know that all things
[1:16:01] work together for good to them that love
[1:16:03] God and to them that are called
[1:16:06] according to his purpose those that are
[1:16:09] the called according to his purpose
[1:16:11] if God has called you up out of Egypt
[1:16:13] amen
[1:16:14] he's got a path laid out for you there's
[1:16:17] a lot of trials along that journey
[1:16:18] there's a lot of things that would go
[1:16:20] wrong along that journey beau and you
[1:16:22] trust in the Lord every step of the way
[1:16:24] he will see you through they meant why
[1:16:27] because he's led you every step of the
[1:16:28] way he's already put those in your path
[1:16:31] to see what you will do amen God has
[1:16:35] already put troubles in your path along
[1:16:37] the way just to see what your how you're
[1:16:40] gonna if you're gonna trust him or not
[1:16:41] they meant he doesn't always lead you up
[1:16:44] the easy way he'll lead you throw away
[1:16:46] your troubles just to see if you'll
[1:16:48] trust in him or not amen that's the
[1:16:53] pattern I mean let's turn it over to
[1:16:57] first Corinthians chapter 2
[1:17:22] first Corinthians
[1:17:24] to verse 1 it says and I brethren when I
[1:17:29] came to you
[1:17:30] I came not with excellency of speech or
[1:17:34] of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:17:36] testimony of God fry determined not to
[1:17:41] know anything among you save Jesus
[1:17:43] Christ and him crucified and I was with
[1:17:47] you in weakness and in fear and much
[1:17:51] trembling all the great evangelists the
[1:17:54] great prophet of the Most High God was
[1:17:58] there amongst the Corinthians and he is
[1:18:00] there in weakness and in fear and in
[1:18:02] much trembling verse 4 and my speech and
[1:18:06] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:18:08] of man's wisdom but in demonstration of
[1:18:12] the Spirit and of power why why was that
[1:18:17] verse 5 so that your faith should not
[1:18:22] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:18:25] power of God whose faith the faith of
[1:18:29] the believers in the local church the
[1:18:32] body of the Lord Jesus Christ that their
[1:18:35] faith when they see the power of God on
[1:18:38] display and demonstration that their
[1:18:40] faith might rise up to a point that they
[1:18:43] could believe in their Savior amen
[1:18:46] and that's where their faith should rest
[1:18:49] that they can believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ save them from their sins and
[1:18:54] realize that he is not just back then
[1:18:56] he's not just the guy of 30 years ago
[1:18:58] that's now what Paul's preaching to
[1:19:00] that's what Paul's preaching here he's
[1:19:03] not he's preaching here in AD 50 amen 80
[1:19:06] 55 80 60 whatever it was that he is not
[1:19:11] just the god of twenty years ago when
[1:19:13] Jesus Christ is walking on the earth by
[1:19:15] a man but he is still the same God right
[1:19:18] here in the book of Corinthians and that
[1:19:20] your faith should not rest in the power
[1:19:22] of God 20 years ago but your faith
[1:19:24] should rest in the power of right now
[1:19:26] right now here in the local church he is
[1:19:29] still the same yesterday today and
[1:19:31] forever Amen that God still reigns that
[1:19:35] God is still alive amen and he is still
[1:19:37] with us
[1:19:38] yes amen we ought to have that testimony
[1:19:42] of our own selves amen
[1:19:46] hey I got a quote I want to read brother
[1:19:49] Branham from the spoken word is the
[1:19:56] original seat he said brother Branham
[1:20:06] says he says see now why I have been so
[1:20:10] zealous of the kind of seat the high I
[1:20:13] have planted for the body was brother
[1:20:17] bran doing he was planting a seed was he
[1:20:24] planting it for the end of the age he
[1:20:28] was a prophet and he had a message and
[1:20:31] he was planting a seed for the end of
[1:20:34] the age
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:38] he said see now why I've been so zealous
[1:20:41] for the kind of seed that I have planted
[1:20:44] for the body the rain is going to fall
[1:20:48] pretty soon I mean the real rain and
[1:20:52] it's got to have seed to fall on I hope
[1:20:58] I live to see it do you understand now
[1:21:01] it will be the Living Word as it was at
[1:21:06] the beginning oh is brother Bram doing
[1:21:13] pointing back to the same gospel that
[1:21:16] was preached at the beginning amen what
[1:21:20] was that gospel the same living word
[1:21:23] that came not just a book on words on
[1:21:25] pages amen but the real Living Word of
[1:21:28] God that can create Amen that can do the
[1:21:33] they created the heavens and the earth
[1:21:35] let's still hear the same it's Jesus
[1:21:37] Christ it will be the Living Word as it
[1:21:41] was at the beginning the spoken word of
[1:21:44] God half his power for it is in him in
[1:21:48] his own body
[1:21:50] oh the body
[1:21:52] yes not just in the head but the word of
[1:21:57] Christ in the body have his power for it
[1:22:02] is in him in his own body working his
[1:22:05] own way Jesus Christ working in his own
[1:22:08] way through his own body look to the
[1:22:11] promises that God gave this body why
[1:22:15] look at the promises God gave this body
[1:22:17] so why is it this message seeds in it
[1:22:22] and the real rain when you listen to
[1:22:26] this message you believe this message
[1:22:30] the real rain is going to come and
[1:22:32] whatever it is that you've been
[1:22:34] listening to that's what's going to grow
[1:22:36] and if you've been listening to this
[1:22:38] message that's going to grow up in your
[1:22:40] lives now if you just if you haven't
[1:22:43] left Egypt yet then you don't have much
[1:22:46] of a promise amen but if you like them
[1:22:49] cross through the Red Sea cross through
[1:22:51] the Jordan you're looking unto every
[1:22:54] single promise of God being made
[1:22:56] manifest Amen that Christ has an actual
[1:23:00] body Jesus said a body has so prepared
[1:23:05] for me amen and let me tell you the body
[1:23:07] when Jesus was here walking on this
[1:23:09] earth his body was subject unto the Word
[1:23:12] of God amen when the head said reach out
[1:23:15] your hand and put spit in the eye it's a
[1:23:20] meant rub clay into that man's eyes he's
[1:23:23] gonna be healed amen so the same spirit
[1:23:26] that was in that body then there's the
[1:23:28] same spirit that's in this body now a
[1:23:30] man when the head says to do something
[1:23:33] you out of at least having an experience
[1:23:36] with God that you know that whenever the
[1:23:38] head says to do something that he'll be
[1:23:41] with you to fall through all the way to
[1:23:43] the end amen I'll never forget one of
[1:23:50] the first times I saw someone heals
[1:23:53] someone when I saw God heal somebody
[1:23:59] well
[1:24:00] ministry because why I started preaching
[1:24:04] I said God if you're not with me then
[1:24:07] don't call me if you're not gonna be
[1:24:10] with me and then don't send me and and I
[1:24:14] was like lord I pray you give me a
[1:24:16] little token just show that you called
[1:24:19] me to do this and just about a month
[1:24:23] later I went and I traveled down to Ohio
[1:24:25] and I was preaching there and and there
[1:24:27] was a man named it was a visitor in the
[1:24:30] church he wasn't even a Christian but
[1:24:33] someone had just invited him and he had
[1:24:35] a neurological condition where he
[1:24:37] couldn't feel anything from the waist
[1:24:38] down I know I've given this testimony
[1:24:41] several times before but he couldn't
[1:24:45] feel anything from the waist down and he
[1:24:47] could you kind of would lurch from side
[1:24:49] to side as he walked and well after we
[1:24:53] preached the message I asked him buddy a
[1:24:54] desire for prayer to come up for prayer
[1:24:58] and when that man got up out of his Pew
[1:25:02] he lurched down the aisle from side to
[1:25:04] side with his cane and he came up and he
[1:25:07] says I've had this condition for 12
[1:25:09] years and I'm sick of it
[1:25:11] I'm tired of it and I looked at him and
[1:25:17] all of a sudden the head Christ put a
[1:25:21] thought in my mind that just like the
[1:25:25] woman that had the issue of blood for 12
[1:25:27] years was healed that this man could be
[1:25:30] healed if the woman that had the issue
[1:25:33] of blood sought healing for 12 years and
[1:25:36] was tired and sick of what she had so
[1:25:39] this man coming to the body of Christ
[1:25:42] who has had this issue for 12 years now
[1:25:45] wants the same deliverance and we
[1:25:48] believe Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ
[1:25:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:55] amen and so the the head Christ anointed
[1:26:00] me I was not working through my thoughts
[1:26:02] I was working through his thoughts amen
[1:26:04] I reached out my hand I laid my hand on
[1:26:07] his shoulder and I prayed a simple
[1:26:10] prayer said Lord as you healed the woman
[1:26:12] with the issue of blood
[1:26:13] for I had the issue but for 12 years I
[1:26:16] pray you would heal this man in the same
[1:26:17] way God and he walked back to his chair
[1:26:21] in his heel before I go back to his pew
[1:26:25] and now is about eight years ago and he
[1:26:28] is still but still healed still
[1:26:30] delivered he became a Christian He gave
[1:26:32] His life to Christ because he couldn't
[1:26:35] do something for himself but he saw
[1:26:37] Christ the head he made the same
[1:26:40] yesterday today and forever amen that
[1:26:43] God was still alive that God still
[1:26:45] reigned amen Jesus Christ is still here
[1:26:49] he's still life let every man have his
[1:26:51] own testimony amen
[1:26:54] I remember you know my middle boy Isaac
[1:26:58] when he was little he had a milk allergy
[1:27:02] that when he got milk on his face or
[1:27:06] anywhere on his skin he had break out in
[1:27:09] welts and he was a messy eater and he'd
[1:27:12] get food down inside of his shirt you
[1:27:14] know and down inside his clothes and and
[1:27:16] he'd eat cause cheese and everywhere
[1:27:18] that cheese product touched his skin
[1:27:20] would turn red and if he ate he who'd
[1:27:24] just bring out in welts a little little
[1:27:26] red spots around his lips and everything
[1:27:27] and we were wondering if we should have
[1:27:30] him quit eating milk products and
[1:27:34] something just struck my wife and I are
[1:27:36] you know what let's just pray for and my
[1:27:41] wife and I we just got him there in the
[1:27:43] dining room and we just laid our hands
[1:27:45] on when we just prayed a simple prayer
[1:27:47] God healed him and he never had that
[1:27:51] problem again I wasn't doing that as a
[1:27:56] minister I was doing that as a dad let
[1:28:01] every man have his own testimony that
[1:28:04] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:28:06] and forever now then we can be ministers
[1:28:10] then we can be witnesses of this message
[1:28:13] amen brother Branham when he started out
[1:28:16] in his ministry he had an old panel
[1:28:19] truck a black panel truck on the side he
[1:28:22] had printed painted Jesus Christ Hebrews
[1:28:25] 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yes
[1:28:27] today today and forever amen and that
[1:28:33] was his he was going forth in the
[1:28:34] ministry in the power of that scripture
[1:28:37] amen let me tell you we're still in
[1:28:39] going forth in the ministry and the
[1:28:40] power of that scripture because Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ is still the same he's still
[1:28:45] alive amen we ought to have a testimony
[1:28:47] not just the God's deliver us from Egypt
[1:28:50] but that Jesus Christ is still the same
[1:28:52] he's still alive otherwise why are we
[1:28:55] here why did we come here this morning
[1:29:00] amen amen
[1:29:07] just here in closing I would turn over
[1:29:11] to the book of Joshua chapter 3
[1:29:46] Joshua chapter 3 verse 6 now they've
[1:29:53] already gone through their Red Sea
[1:29:55] experience they've been out of Egypt now
[1:29:59] for 40 years and they're getting ready
[1:30:02] to enter in to all the promises of God
[1:30:07] they're no longer just battling about
[1:30:10] with their own living around in the
[1:30:13] wilderness
[1:30:13] you know God had him build the Ark of
[1:30:17] the Covenant that Ark of the Covenant
[1:30:20] was not designed to be dragged to the
[1:30:23] desert for 40 years you know what they
[1:30:28] did you know what the Ark of the
[1:30:29] Covenant was it was just a box amen it
[1:30:36] was a box that's what the Ark of the
[1:30:38] Covenant was there's a box Maywood that
[1:30:42] was covered over in gold and when they
[1:30:44] left Egypt and they crossed the Red Sea
[1:30:46] God had him sit down and begin making
[1:30:49] this box and they took two angels and
[1:30:54] they put it there on the lid with the
[1:30:59] swept-back wings you've seen the picture
[1:31:02] and inside this box they took two stones
[1:31:09] that were the tablets of stone that God
[1:31:12] wrote with his own finger you know if
[1:31:16] you ever see God do something like that
[1:31:17] you're gonna save those stones
[1:31:19] amen amen so they took those two tablets
[1:31:23] of stones that were on it were the Ten
[1:31:24] Commandments and God had written with
[1:31:26] his own finger and they placed it on the
[1:31:28] inside of that box they also took
[1:31:31] Aaron's rod that had supernaturally but
[1:31:34] it years there's a dead stick they have
[1:31:38] placed it in the presence of the Lord
[1:31:40] and it butted and bore almonds amen and
[1:31:46] they
[1:31:48] that stick and they place that in there
[1:31:49] also I think they took a little bit of
[1:31:52] the man up amen the God rained down from
[1:31:55] heaven and they placed that in there
[1:31:57] also so they took the word and the signs
[1:32:01] and the wonders and they put them all in
[1:32:03] the box a mint that box was not meant
[1:32:07] and was not designed to be dragged to
[1:32:11] the wilderness for 40 years but that box
[1:32:15] was designed to go up to the River
[1:32:17] Jordan
[1:32:19] so the River Jordan could part and they
[1:32:22] could eat you right into the promises of
[1:32:24] God amen and so if God has ever saved
[1:32:28] you from the land of Egypt if God has
[1:32:33] ever opened his word to you if God has
[1:32:37] ever revealed anything to you of these
[1:32:39] scriptures where you might actually be
[1:32:41] able to part through the darkness of
[1:32:43] laodicean your mind and all the
[1:32:45] foolishness of this age and all the sins
[1:32:47] if God could ever part through all that
[1:32:49] darkness in your mind and give you that
[1:32:51] thought that I need to be safe from my
[1:32:53] sins I need to be to layer if you could
[1:32:55] ever respond to that respond to that and
[1:33:00] actually go and say I repent of my sins
[1:33:03] I receive the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:05] Christ and get baptized in the name of
[1:33:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and have you have
[1:33:10] a little testimony of something that God
[1:33:12] has done for you your heart has become
[1:33:20] the Ark of the Covenant amen God has
[1:33:26] written his word upon the fleshly tables
[1:33:29] of your heart right amen your you've
[1:33:31] become the Living tabernacle of the
[1:33:33] living guy's dwelling place amen his
[1:33:36] name is sealed upon your forehead Amen
[1:33:38] he's you've been buried with him in
[1:33:40] Baptism you cop out of it and you are
[1:33:43] not designed to live in the wilderness
[1:33:45] for 40 years without ever seeing an act
[1:33:48] of God amen but that box was designed to
[1:33:51] go directly from the red seat directly
[1:33:54] to the River Jordan amen that's what it
[1:33:58] was designed to do amen so watch here we
[1:34:01] get to
[1:34:02] Joshua chapter three verse six they've
[1:34:04] now spent 40 years wandering around the
[1:34:07] wilderness dragging God's promises
[1:34:09] through a dry place without seeing that
[1:34:12] act without actually following the
[1:34:15] promises of God amen and now they've
[1:34:17] come back to the River Jordan and
[1:34:19] they're gonna and they're waiting to see
[1:34:21] what God's gonna do verse 6 it says and
[1:34:25] Joshua spake unto the priest saying take
[1:34:28] up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over
[1:34:31] before the people and they took up the
[1:34:33] Ark of the Covenant and went before the
[1:34:35] people and the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:34:38] this day
[1:34:39] well I begin to magnify thee in the
[1:34:42] sight of all Israel that they might know
[1:34:45] that as I was with Moses so low I be
[1:34:49] with thee and now shall command the
[1:34:53] priests that bear the Ark of the
[1:34:54] Covenant saying when ye are come to the
[1:34:57] brink of the waters of Jordan he shall
[1:34:59] stand still in Jordan and what we'll
[1:35:04] just pause right there they're getting
[1:35:07] ready they're standing before the River
[1:35:09] Jordan on the other side of the river
[1:35:12] are all the promises of God and the only
[1:35:16] thing is blocking them from entering
[1:35:18] into the promises of God is this River
[1:35:21] and so they're standing and they're
[1:35:23] watching to see what's gonna happen and
[1:35:25] arkla come and it gets up with the
[1:35:28] priests they get up and they walk and
[1:35:30] they go and they stand and their feet
[1:35:32] touch the water and they stand right
[1:35:34] there in the water and then you get to
[1:35:38] verse 10 verse 9 says and Joshua said
[1:35:42] unto the children of Israel come hither
[1:35:45] and hear the words of the Lord your God
[1:35:47] and Joshua said hereby ye shall know
[1:35:52] that the Living God is among you and
[1:35:56] that he will without fail drive out from
[1:36:00] before you the Canaanites and the
[1:36:02] Hittites and hittites and the perizzites
[1:36:04] and the girgashites and hammerites
[1:36:06] and the jebusites behold the Ark of the
[1:36:09] Covenant of the Lord of all the earth
[1:36:11] passes over before you into Jordan
[1:36:17] amen and as that heart as that arc went
[1:36:24] to the River Jordan the priests feet
[1:36:28] touch the River Jordan and the water
[1:36:31] parted and they were able to enter in to
[1:36:34] the promised land where all the promises
[1:36:37] of God are so is it with every Christian
[1:36:41] when you leave Egypt behind you take
[1:36:45] upon the Passover lamb the blood of the
[1:36:47] Lord Jesus Christ you're baptized in the
[1:36:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:52] you're not designed to live in the
[1:36:54] wilderness for forty years you're right
[1:36:56] then your heart has become the Ark of
[1:36:58] the Covenant he has written his word
[1:37:00] upon your heart and you're there you're
[1:37:01] good to go right to the River Jordan and
[1:37:03] as soon as your open heart
[1:37:05] amen as soon as your heart goes and
[1:37:09] touches when you see the word rising
[1:37:12] remember that's why people receive the
[1:37:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost a lot of
[1:37:19] people will receive it at the preaching
[1:37:20] of the word remember remember in the
[1:37:23] book of Acts that's how it happened as
[1:37:24] Pope Peter was preaching the gospel the
[1:37:29] word was going forth they entered it and
[1:37:32] there passed through the river Jordan
[1:37:33] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:34] what was that the word was going forth
[1:37:36] and the word and then were united as one
[1:37:40] they entered into all the promises of
[1:37:42] God amen so is it to be to every
[1:37:46] believer but there to be what happens
[1:37:50] from that point forward it's no longer
[1:37:53] you're just following this man Moses
[1:37:58] you're no longer following a man at that
[1:38:01] point you're following the leadership of
[1:38:04] the Holy Ghost now you are not just part
[1:38:11] of a movement you are the movement
[1:38:16] you're not just sympathizing with the
[1:38:20] movement you have literally become the
[1:38:25] very part of the body that is going to
[1:38:28] take over all the problems
[1:38:29] and so is it to be to every true
[1:38:32] believer it's at that moment that you're
[1:38:35] no longer just a follower you have
[1:38:38] become the message amen
[1:38:42] you're not just following a man you're
[1:38:44] not just following a message you're not
[1:38:46] just mentally conceiving everything but
[1:38:48] now you and our Ark have become one amen
[1:38:52] and now as God was with Moses now God
[1:38:57] will be with you you'll be filled with
[1:38:59] the Holy Ghost and the leadership divine
[1:39:04] leadership or the Holy Ghost is your
[1:39:06] promise now you are given your own part
[1:39:10] of the land for you to take over not for
[1:39:14] the ministry to take it over for you but
[1:39:18] for you the body to take over your part
[1:39:21] of the promise give me my mountain as
[1:39:25] Caleb said you part of the body are here
[1:39:28] to take over your part of the promise as
[1:39:31] the head Christ gives leadership let
[1:39:37] every man have his own testimony and
[1:39:40] it's the testimony that drove them and
[1:39:43] gave them power oh time after time why
[1:39:45] because the testimony is the faith that
[1:39:48] made AG everything come to pass
[1:39:51] Amen faith is the currency of the
[1:39:54] kingdom of heaven amen amen
[1:39:57] there was no money in the kingdom of
[1:39:59] heaven the money in the kingdom of
[1:40:01] heaven is your faith Amen that purchases
[1:40:05] through the blood of Christ everything
[1:40:09] that you have need of a man let's just
[1:40:11] stand
[1:40:19] just I just want to read one more
[1:40:21] scripture Romans chapter 15
[1:40:37] romans chapter 15 verse 28 Paul said
[1:40:46] when therefore I have performed this and
[1:40:49] have sealed to them this fruit I will
[1:40:53] come by you in Spain
[1:40:56] verse 29 and I am sure that when I come
[1:41:02] unto you I shall come in the fullness of
[1:41:06] the blessing of the gospel of Christ is
[1:41:15] that your testimony I am sure that when
[1:41:19] I come to work today
[1:41:21] though I am going to come in the
[1:41:23] fullness of the blessing of the gospel
[1:41:25] of Christ I am sure that when I go back
[1:41:28] home to my household to my family I am
[1:41:31] sure letting I come home with the
[1:41:33] fullness of the blessing of Christ I am
[1:41:35] sure that when I go on vacation when I
[1:41:37] am with my in-laws may wherever I am I
[1:41:41] am gonna come with the fullness of the
[1:41:43] blessing of Christ why was Paul so sure
[1:41:47] of that he said I am sure now he wasn't
[1:41:53] there yet he says I in verse 28 he said
[1:41:58] well I'm done doing I'm doing here I'm
[1:42:00] gonna come to you in Spain and I am sure
[1:42:04] that when I come I'm gonna come to you
[1:42:06] in the full and the fullness of the
[1:42:08] blessing of Christ why was he so sure
[1:42:12] because he had been through the process
[1:42:15] he had seen God save him with a mighty
[1:42:19] hand pull him up out of Egypt baptize
[1:42:24] heal delivered set free empowered to be
[1:42:30] a minister of the gospel sent to the
[1:42:32] nation's he was a self-contained unit
[1:42:35] that wherever he went he knew that the
[1:42:40] Holy Ghost inside of him was leading him
[1:42:42] every step of the way that's where that
[1:42:45] assured and this came from and that same
[1:42:47] assurance is a problem
[1:42:51] to every member of the body of the Lord
[1:42:53] Jesus Christ they can be sure that
[1:42:56] wherever they go that they are going
[1:42:58] there with the fullness of the blessing
[1:43:01] of the gospel of Christ and if you don't
[1:43:04] have that if you're dragging the Ark of
[1:43:08] the Covenant through the wilderness
[1:43:09] these many years if you haven't been
[1:43:12] saved if you haven't been filled the
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost if you do not have that
[1:43:15] testimony then why don't you come up to
[1:43:19] the altar this morning and we will pray
[1:43:21] with you
[1:43:22] amen so that why would we do that why
[1:43:28] would we do that why would we come to
[1:43:30] the altar so that you can leave where
[1:43:34] you are I come up to a place you've
[1:43:38] never been as a testimony to God and
[1:43:44] Here I am I'm leaving it all behind I've
[1:43:51] tried and I can't do it by myself
[1:43:53] but I want to enter into all the
[1:43:55] promises of God because every man has to
[1:43:58] come to that point where they realize
[1:44:01] that they come to that place where they
[1:44:03] can't do it themselves but they need God
[1:44:06] to do it for them that's the power of an
[1:44:09] altar call amen you're leaving that
[1:44:13] which you could not do behind and coming
[1:44:16] up and asking God to do it for you
[1:44:18] amen so if you would desire to have that
[1:44:21] kind of a testimony amen you come on up
[1:44:23] here as our brother Isaac comes and as
[1:44:26] we sing we will pray for you amen god
[1:44:29] bless you
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:48] to be saying and we pay to be
[1:45:44] [Music]
