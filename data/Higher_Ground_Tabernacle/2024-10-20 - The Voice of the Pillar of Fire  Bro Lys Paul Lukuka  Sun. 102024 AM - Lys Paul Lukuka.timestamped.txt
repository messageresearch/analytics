[36:44] Christ amen amen amen um let's turn to 1
[36:50] Samuel chapter
[36:53] 3 we greet you all in the name of the
[36:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[36:59] and I think I see sister maida um all
[37:02] the way from
[37:04] Canada welcome and sister
[37:07] shakina
[37:08] chch and I don't know if there's any
[37:11] other
[37:13] visitors okay
[37:15] cool all right um 1 Samuel chapter
[37:22] 3 it reads like this and the child
[37:25] Samuel ministered unto the Lord before
[37:31] Eli and the word of the Lord was
[37:33] precious in those
[37:37] days there was no open
[37:40] vision and it came to pass at the time
[37:42] when Eli was laid down in his place and
[37:45] his eyes began to walk them that he
[37:47] could not
[37:55] see and Air the lamp of God went out in
[37:58] the temple of the Lord where the Ark of
[38:01] God was and Samuel was laid down to
[38:10] sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he
[38:13] answered here am
[38:17] I and he ran unto Eli and said here am I
[38:22] for thou callest me and he said I call
[38:24] it I called not lay lie down again and
[38:28] he went and lay
[38:38] down and the Lord called yet again
[38:41] Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli
[38:44] and said here am I for thou did did call
[38:47] me and he answered I called not my son
[38:50] lie down lay down lie down again
[39:04] now Samuel did not yet know the Lord
[39:06] neither was the word of the Lord yet
[39:08] revealed unto
[39:16] him you know it's interesting that the
[39:19] Lord called Samuel when he did not even
[39:21] yet know the Lord
[39:27] so you don't need to know the Lord for
[39:29] in order for him to call
[39:33] you because he's the one that reveals
[39:35] himself to
[39:36] you he's the one that make himself know
[39:39] to you
[39:40] know let's keep reading and verse S now
[39:44] Samuel did okay verse eight and the Lord
[39:46] called Samuel again the third time and
[39:49] he AR arose and went to Eli and said
[39:52] here am I for thou did call me and Eli
[39:55] perceived that the Lord had called
[39:57] called the
[40:11] child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go
[40:15] uh lie down and it shall be if he called
[40:19] thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for
[40:22] that servant heareth um so Samuel went
[40:26] and laid down in his
[40:34] place and the
[40:36] Lord and the Lord came and stood and
[40:39] called as at other times Samuel Samuel
[40:42] then Samuel answered saying speak for
[40:45] thy servant
[40:55] heareth oh you may have your seat
[40:59] um we'll have another scripture but
[41:01] before we read there you
[41:04] know something very interesting in verse
[41:07] n he said you
[41:09] know Eli Eli was the high
[41:13] priest you know Eli was the high priest
[41:16] and Samuel was a
[41:21] prophet you Major Prophets do not become
[41:24] prophets they are born Prophets
[41:29] Samuel was born a
[41:31] prophet but yet he did not know the
[41:35] Lord and he needed an elder to teach him
[41:38] on how to instruct him to train him to
[41:41] train him on how to to know the voice of
[41:43] the
[41:46] [Music]
[41:48] Lord when he heard the Lord calling him
[41:50] he actually thought that was Eli that
[41:52] was calling
[41:54] him so the title my title for today um
[41:58] is going to be the voice um of the
[42:00] pillar of
[42:04] fire or you can say the voice of the
[42:06] angel of God the voice of
[42:11] God so um I will read Genesis chapter
[42:17] 1 it says in the beginning God created
[42:20] the Heaven and the
[42:22] Earth you know and verse three says and
[42:25] God said
[42:28] let there be light and there was
[42:31] light and verse and God said let there
[42:34] be a firmament in the midst of the
[42:36] waters and let it divide the waters from
[42:38] the
[42:45] waters we we notice that the spoken word
[42:47] is what created um the whole
[42:52] universe God's voice is what created you
[42:55] and me
[42:58] God's voice is what created the heavens
[42:59] and the
[43:02] Earth and so going back to the to Samuel
[43:06] the Bible says that the voice the voice
[43:08] of God was precious in those
[43:12] days it was a rare thing in the day of
[43:16] Samuel you know the Bible says there was
[43:18] no open
[43:21] vision and brother bham says that the
[43:23] voice of God is even more precious in
[43:25] our day
[43:29] so don't take the word of God lightly
[43:31] like like keep it in your heart as a
[43:34] precious
[43:37] stone because it's something that's
[43:40] precious and the title is the voice of
[43:43] the pillar of
[43:45] fire what is the pillar of fire you know
[43:48] the prophet explained to us so um
[43:51] usually I have my PowerPoint and slide
[43:53] there but I didn't get the time to
[43:56] prepare all that
[43:57] so I'll rely on the uh brother on the
[44:00] computer to put the quot for me but I'll
[44:03] let you know when I get to that
[44:05] quot brother bam explains what the
[44:07] pillow of fire
[44:10] is he says that when God in the
[44:13] beginning God was just a great the great
[44:17] spirit but you could not see the
[44:21] spirit so God had to he he he the word
[44:24] of God proceeded out out of that great
[44:26] spirit
[44:30] and started to form itself into a a form
[44:33] that that that was
[44:38] visible because in spirit you cannot see
[44:40] the
[44:41] spirit and the prophet says that what
[44:43] came out of God that logos was the
[44:45] pillar of
[44:49] fire so the pillar of fire is God
[44:51] himself in a form that that we can see
[44:58] and and let's let's look in the Bible
[45:00] people that heard so that pillow of fire
[45:02] has a
[45:04] voice that Pillar of Fire
[45:07] speaks know Moses Moses um heard the
[45:10] voice in the in the in the
[45:15] Bush Moses he like he knew that he was
[45:19] supposed to deliver the children of
[45:21] Israel since he was a
[45:25] child and then he tried to uh kill kill
[45:28] the Egyptians
[45:29] and and then they tried to kill him and
[45:31] he fled to the to the
[45:34] Wilderness over there he went in the
[45:36] desert and he and he and he saw a a
[45:38] burning
[45:41] [Music]
[45:43] bush he was curious because
[45:46] that he was curious because that that
[45:49] bush like it it had fire but it was not
[45:52] consuming the
[45:59] and then he wanted to look at that fire
[46:00] and God told him you know the Bible says
[46:03] that when God noticed that Moses wanted
[46:05] to look then the voice
[46:11] spoke like the Moses The Voice Called
[46:14] Moses Moses take off your
[46:18] shoes so that Pillar of Fire had a
[46:22] voice you know he has the Bible God God
[46:25] God God has hands God has God has a
[46:27] mouth he can
[46:29] speak you know so so so when Moses heard
[46:33] the heard the
[46:36] voice God told Moses that I heard the
[46:38] Cry of my people in
[46:42] Egypt and I am come I come I'm coming
[46:45] down to deliver
[46:48] them so that great spirits the great
[46:52] God the logos the pill of fire came out
[46:55] of him
[46:57] and he he met Moses in the in the
[47:00] backside of the
[47:02] desert and he told him that I'm going to
[47:04] delivered
[47:08] Egypt but when um uh God went to Egypt
[47:12] the Egyptians didn't did not see the
[47:13] pillow of
[47:16] fire they saw
[47:18] Moses you know when God was the the
[47:22] prophet even in in another quote he says
[47:24] that after uh uh Moses met the Burning
[47:31] Bush brother says that the pillar of
[47:33] fire came out of that bush and entered
[47:36] into
[47:40] Moses because Moses in in in himself he
[47:43] could not deliver the children of
[47:46] Israel he had to wait on the pillar of
[47:50] fire the prophet of God says that
[47:52] sometimes we try to go before the angel
[47:55] of the Lord
[47:59] and he says that's when we get into
[48:02] trouble Moses thought he he was born he
[48:05] knew his commission since he was a
[48:07] kid his parents brought him
[48:11] well and he thought that with his own
[48:14] power he could deliver the children of
[48:18] Israel and the prophet said that he
[48:20] mesed
[48:22] up but you notice that when he met the
[48:24] pillar of Fire
[48:27] Moses was a changed
[48:29] man when he met the pill of fire Moses
[48:32] did not run from the Egyptians
[48:35] anymore Moses went with a
[48:38] message knowing that the Lord the Lord
[48:40] God was in
[48:42] him no when you meet the pill of fire
[48:45] he'll do the same thing to
[48:46] you pill of fire can change your
[48:50] lives the pill of fire can deliver you
[48:53] from the anxiety the fear that
[48:57] you just got to meet the pillow of
[48:59] fire everybody in the Bible that met the
[49:01] pillow of
[49:04] fire their lives were never the
[49:08] same you know he either the the prophet
[49:10] says he either blinds you or or opens
[49:13] your
[49:17] eyes the Egyptians uh when they were
[49:20] going after the children of
[49:23] Israel the Bible says that the pillar of
[49:25] fire stood between them and and uh the
[49:29] the the children of
[49:33] is he stopped the the the Egyptians from
[49:37] attacking the children of
[49:40] God Jesus is the same yesterday today
[49:43] and
[49:45] forever the children of Israel were in
[49:49] troubl they did not know what to do but
[49:52] the pill of fire came and stood between
[49:54] them and danger
[49:57] and today again if there's a danger in
[49:58] your
[49:59] life call on the on the pillar of
[50:02] fire that Pillar of Fire will stand
[50:05] between you and
[50:08] Satan do not fear the
[50:10] Devil he's coming as a roaring Lon after
[50:14] you but not that the angel of the of the
[50:16] Lord is standing standing between you
[50:18] and
[50:20] evil you just got to meet that Pillar of
[50:23] Fire and all that fear will be gone that
[50:27] that pill of fire allowed the children
[50:29] of Israel to cross the the
[50:34] the it was a challenge that stood before
[50:38] them just like you you may have
[50:40] challenges in front of
[50:42] you and the devil is going because you
[50:45] know every time God blesses you Satan
[50:47] will also try to take that blessing away
[50:49] from
[50:52] you we see that we see that with
[50:55] Daniel Daniel when he started praying uh
[50:58] uh the angel that came to Daniel told
[51:00] him that the moment you started
[51:08] praying God God answered your prayer and
[51:11] he sent me to
[51:16] you but he he he made a
[51:21] resistance the enemy came and started
[51:23] fighting and it took him 21 days to
[51:25] deliver the message to
[51:34] and he said that he had to wait on the
[51:36] on on on Michael to come and help
[51:42] him who was that
[51:45] Michael the prophet says that that
[51:48] Michael was Jesus
[51:51] Christ if if if the angel that needed to
[51:54] deliver the message to Daniel he needed
[51:56] that pillow of fire
[52:01] too whatever trouble you are in you need
[52:03] that pillow of
[52:07] fire amen amen so let's go back to the
[52:10] topic
[52:11] um so like I said the voice of the
[52:14] pillar of fire so Moses heard the
[52:16] voice and in the message the absolute
[52:19] the prophet
[52:21] says not in paragraph
[52:24] 263 not if Moses had the The
[52:27] Fire And he says the fire was in
[52:31] Moses he says because whatever Moses
[52:34] said it wasn't Moses it was God
[52:40] speaking and he performed his
[52:45] sign because the pillar of fire left the
[52:48] bush and come in
[52:53] Moses whatever Moses was speaking it
[52:55] wasn't
[52:58] it was God that was
[53:00] speaking no it was God hid in a
[53:04] man and in in the mount si
[53:08] si you know the children of Israel
[53:10] wanted to hear the voice of
[53:13] God you know they they they they they
[53:15] were just uh they wanted they wanted uh
[53:17] the prophet says they wanted law God
[53:19] gave them Grace but they wanted the
[53:25] law so God told Moses to gather the
[53:27] children and he's going to come down and
[53:29] talk to
[53:32] them you know and when God came
[53:36] down the Bible describes it as he he had
[53:39] it was thunderous like he had a lot of
[53:41] Thunders
[53:42] Lightnings like the mountain words were
[53:50] shaking and the children of Israel were
[53:52] afraid they couldn't even speak to God
[53:57] but I love I think it's in Exodus um 19
[54:01] I don't remember but yeah Exodus 19 um
[54:03] he said the Bible says that the the
[54:06] children of Israel couldn't speak to God
[54:08] but Moses spoke to
[54:13] God they were so
[54:16] terrified that they told Moses that we
[54:19] don't want to hear the voice of God like
[54:21] that
[54:24] direct they told Moses to to tell God to
[54:28] speak to you and then you come to tell
[54:30] us the word of
[54:33] God and God honed that and from that day
[54:39] God has always used a prophet to speak
[54:41] to his
[54:43] children from that day the prophet
[54:45] became the voice of God to to to the
[54:49] children you know even Amos 3 says
[54:52] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[54:56] but he reveal his Secrets unto his
[54:59] servant
[55:00] Prophet Moses became God's voice to the
[55:05] Israelites that voice that they once
[55:07] heard on Mount Si was was veiled behind
[55:10] the
[55:16] man like the prophet says that the word
[55:18] of God was in
[55:21] Moses so much that even his face was
[55:24] shining like and they had to cover his
[55:30] face and the prophet says that that like
[55:33] um when he was removing the the veil it
[55:36] was blinding the children of
[55:42] Israel and the prophet says that it's
[55:45] the same thing
[55:47] today God God veiled in a
[55:51] man the pillar of fire veiled in a
[55:54] man and it says that that's what blinds
[55:57] the
[55:59] people God in a human
[56:04] being amen for some reason we people
[56:07] people always uh stumble when whenever
[56:10] we talk about God using God in a
[56:16] man you know because it was so in the
[56:19] time of
[56:20] Moses and everything I'm saying today I
[56:23] have I have I have quotes for literally
[56:25] everything I'm saying
[56:28] whenever I get time I read but when I
[56:29] don't get time I just you can go go
[56:32] check it at
[56:35] home so one day Moses saw the he um he
[56:39] wanted to see the glory of
[56:42] God right so he he wanted to see he he
[56:45] asked God to show him his
[56:48] glory you know so all these days Moses
[56:51] always heard he always heard the The
[56:53] Voice he saw the pill of fire but he
[56:55] never saw The Man Behind the pillow of
[57:02] fire and God said okay I will show
[57:06] you but I won't show you my
[57:10] face God showed God showed Moses the
[57:13] back the back part of
[57:18] God and the prophet said he was he was
[57:21] like a
[57:23] man you know because the Bible says that
[57:26] God used his hands to to hide Moses from
[57:29] seeing the face of
[57:33] God so that's why the prophet says God
[57:36] is a is like a man he's a
[57:38] man like he has hands you know he has
[57:42] eyes you know and he has a back you know
[57:46] he has a head you
[57:49] know amen amen all right so let's
[57:52] continue with Moses Mo so there was the
[57:56] time um Moses um he had appointed
[58:03] Elders you know so remember Moses was
[58:06] the word of God to the children of
[58:10] Israel and then he appointed Elders I
[58:13] think 70 or 71 Elders in the
[58:16] Bible you know because uh um his
[58:18] father-in-law suggested to him that
[58:20] instead of you taking the burden of the
[58:22] children of Israel all by yourself
[58:27] why don't you divide uh like choose 71
[58:32] elders and the prophet said that when
[58:35] Moses picked those 71
[58:40] Elders a part of God uh went into left
[58:44] Moses and went into those um
[58:50] 71 but brother says that but they still
[58:53] had to refer back to Moses
[58:58] and he said because Moses had thus
[58:59] sayith the
[59:01] Lord he he said Moses had the last
[59:05] word the 71 could represent preachers
[59:11] today I don't want any any preachers
[59:13] that preaches to me any message outside
[59:15] of the voice of
[59:18] God we need to refer back to what
[59:20] brother Bram
[59:22] saying because because brother Bram says
[59:25] that God doesn't use two major prophet
[59:27] at the same
[59:30] time and this is the last age and there
[59:32] was only one Prophet That was supposed
[59:34] to go to the
[59:37] last I don't recall anywhere in the
[59:39] Bible where he mentions two prophets
[59:41] being in the last
[59:45] day so take me back to what brother Bram
[59:50] saying because he also one time he met
[59:52] that pill of
[59:55] Fire pill of fire also entered in
[59:58] him and brought us not the message of
[1:00:01] brother Bram but the message of
[1:00:04] God so who are you to correct the
[1:00:08] prophet people that people that try to
[1:00:11] correct the prophet I feel like they
[1:00:12] don't even understand who what the
[1:00:14] prophet
[1:00:17] is the prophet is God veiled in a
[1:00:22] man know who can correct God
[1:00:29] those 71 Elders they were
[1:00:33] ministers but the prophet says they
[1:00:35] still had to refer back to
[1:00:38] Moses you
[1:00:39] know amen amen I don't know why today
[1:00:43] there are so many ministers out there
[1:00:44] they think they know better than brother
[1:00:48] brand I think they just need a
[1:00:52] revelation brother Bram
[1:00:54] was and then maybe they don't even read
[1:00:57] their own Bible because if you read your
[1:00:59] Bible you can clearly see how God
[1:01:02] started using
[1:01:04] Prophet prophets are they're not even
[1:01:07] made like we
[1:01:09] are I remember brother Brandon one time
[1:01:12] um I think he went to the doctor or
[1:01:14] something and the doctor told him that
[1:01:17] his his body was different than
[1:01:18] everybody
[1:01:22] else if you notice in the in in Exodus
[1:01:28] the when God descended on up on Mount
[1:01:32] Si you know the children of Israel
[1:01:35] couldn't even get on on the
[1:01:39] mountain even even the goats or even the
[1:01:43] the animals couldn't even touch the
[1:01:47] mountain the moment they touch it they
[1:01:50] die but the Bible says Moses went inside
[1:01:53] the mountain
[1:01:57] he must have been made differently than
[1:02:00] all the children of
[1:02:02] Israel even his body was made
[1:02:06] different you are not the
[1:02:08] prophet don't try to take the place of
[1:02:11] brother
[1:02:12] BR a prophet is made in a way that he
[1:02:15] can communicate with God face to
[1:02:19] face and and I'm not talking about Minor
[1:02:22] Prophet I'm talking about the ma Prophet
[1:02:25] prophet brother bam says that each age
[1:02:27] has it its
[1:02:29] prophet and the prophet brings the word
[1:02:32] of God for that age for that
[1:02:35] generation so he alone has the
[1:02:37] interpretation of the word of God for
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:41] age so if you want to know the will of
[1:02:43] God for our age refer back to what the
[1:02:49] prophet don't go on YouTube or like Tik
[1:02:52] Tok and all those other all those other
[1:02:54] stuff the word the will of God for our
[1:02:57] day came from the prophet
[1:03:01] will and then and then God the God had
[1:03:04] to vindicate the message of
[1:03:08] Moses he he Vindicated that message with
[1:03:11] a pillar of
[1:03:13] fire and in our day as well he
[1:03:15] Vindicated the ministry
[1:03:19] of and then people try to get it
[1:03:22] confused they think it's the man that's
[1:03:23] doing all this work
[1:03:27] remember the prophet says that God
[1:03:30] veiled in a man is what blinds the
[1:03:34] people but the key word is it's not the
[1:03:36] man it's God who ins who is inside the
[1:03:40] man it's the angel of the Lord that goes
[1:03:43] and do do do does all those
[1:03:46] things brother multiple say multiple
[1:03:49] times said I had nothing to do with
[1:03:52] it it it wasn't him you know it was the
[1:03:56] God it was the voice behind the
[1:03:59] voice brother bam says that I'm I have a
[1:04:02] quote here I'll get to
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:07] that okay let's read this quote um
[1:04:10] coming from the
[1:04:12] message the unveiling of
[1:04:16] God no actually let's go to um take the
[1:04:20] rod and gather the people
[1:04:26] so the prophet
[1:04:28] said the people who crucified Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ believed in An Almighty
[1:04:36] God no in religion holy renowned man
[1:04:39] crucified the Son of God because they
[1:04:41] did not believe that he was
[1:04:48] God you know and no matter how much they
[1:04:51] believed in Jehovah God they can't
[1:04:53] believe in Jesus being his son in in
[1:04:55] order to receive anything from God from
[1:04:57] Jehovah
[1:05:05] God paragraph six he told the
[1:05:09] Jews he said as you have believed in God
[1:05:13] believe also in
[1:05:16] me the prophet is saying
[1:05:20] that Jesus Jesus was telling them that
[1:05:23] the prophet says that the the children
[1:05:25] of is they believe they believe the word
[1:05:27] they believe the
[1:05:29] Bible they believed in everything the
[1:05:31] Bible
[1:05:33] said but Jesus is like okay I know you I
[1:05:36] know you believe in
[1:05:38] God but believe also in
[1:05:41] me the word of God made
[1:05:45] manifest you know and let's keep reading
[1:05:48] that and uh that's right well now if you
[1:05:51] will test his message one moment
[1:05:55] the angel of the Lord
[1:05:57] told if you get the people to believe
[1:06:03] you you know get the people to believe
[1:06:05] you and be sincere when you
[1:06:08] pray no disease shall stand before the
[1:06:12] prayer I have
[1:06:14] proof do you believe
[1:06:17] me you say I'll believe
[1:06:21] God well that's what you should
[1:06:24] do but you can't believe in God and you
[1:06:28] don't believe in this it won't do you
[1:06:30] any
[1:06:33] good brother you can't you you you claim
[1:06:36] okay I believe the
[1:06:37] Bible if you believe this
[1:06:40] Bible and you don't believe what brother
[1:06:42] tells
[1:06:44] you any good is that the
[1:06:48] word I'm not saying my own word I'm
[1:06:50] repeating what brother
[1:06:52] said even Jesus said that Jus said I
[1:06:56] know you believe in God but believe also
[1:06:58] in
[1:07:00] me why because because he the pillow of
[1:07:04] when the pillow of fire came to
[1:07:07] Moses Moses asking like why will I tell
[1:07:09] the people who who are
[1:07:12] you he said he said I am that I
[1:07:17] am the living bread the word of God
[1:07:21] present not not God of the past not God
[1:07:24] of the future but God of the
[1:07:27] that's what the pill of fire
[1:07:30] is the pill of fire is not God of the
[1:07:33] past the pill fire is God right
[1:07:36] now that's that's why brother bam says
[1:07:38] believe in me
[1:07:40] also because the pillow of fire is in
[1:07:44] him when he has th sayth the
[1:07:48] Lord and he says verse
[1:07:50] seven no no no no uh uh uh same thing uh
[1:07:54] don't believe
[1:07:56] as one of them but believe they have
[1:07:58] sent me for this purpose then God then
[1:08:00] when you believe
[1:08:01] me you believe what the angel has come
[1:08:08] from that he is the angel from
[1:08:11] God you remember in let's go back to
[1:08:14] Exodus
[1:08:15] again the children of Israel what were
[1:08:18] angry God is because they did not
[1:08:20] believe the message of Moses they were
[1:08:21] complaining
[1:08:26] even Paul later on says that they fell
[1:08:28] short to enter into the rest because of
[1:08:30] their
[1:08:34] unbelief and that applies the same thing
[1:08:36] today if you do not believe the message
[1:08:39] of William
[1:08:43] Bram like okay let me just read where he
[1:08:46] says then when you believe you believe
[1:08:47] what the angel Has Come
[1:08:52] For and verse seven I'm just his voice
[1:08:57] he is a supernatural
[1:09:00] person I am
[1:09:02] natural he can bring Supernatural to the
[1:09:05] Natural
[1:09:07] man he glorifies speaks his
[1:09:11] voice he uses my
[1:09:14] hands he uses my eyes to see
[1:09:17] Visions he uses my
[1:09:20] ears just as the Holy Spirit uses
[1:09:24] you he says I'm just his
[1:09:27] voice you know amen amen uh in um the
[1:09:33] message the unveiling of God paragraph
[1:09:38] 129 brother says Moses coming from the
[1:09:41] presence of God with the word of God for
[1:09:43] that
[1:09:46] age now watch we are now in Exodus
[1:09:51] 19 don't miss this now
[1:09:56] Moses is coming from the presence of
[1:09:59] God he has been into the
[1:10:02] word the word has been
[1:10:05] wrote and he in the presence of where am
[1:10:08] I and he in the presence of God with the
[1:10:12] word he had the word for that
[1:10:15] age there is a word for each
[1:10:19] age just like there is a word for our
[1:10:23] age you know and Moses come coming forth
[1:10:26] his face
[1:10:29] shined the word was in
[1:10:33] him right ready to be manifested giving
[1:10:37] out to the
[1:10:39] people the true word God had wrote it
[1:10:42] and he was with
[1:10:47] Moses and he was the words to
[1:10:51] them he was the Living Word he
[1:10:57] that logos the prophet says the logos is
[1:10:59] the
[1:11:01] word and that that that the word is hid
[1:11:04] behind a
[1:11:06] man you know veiled
[1:11:09] himself you know and uh let me go to he
[1:11:13] says do you see it wherever the word is
[1:11:16] it's
[1:11:19] veiled now remember after the word was
[1:11:22] made
[1:11:24] manifest Moses was Moses
[1:11:27] again so he had times where he he became
[1:11:30] a normal
[1:11:32] persones but that's after the word was
[1:11:34] made
[1:11:36] manifest but while the word was in him
[1:11:39] to be G to be given
[1:11:45] out he was God let not be let not this
[1:11:49] stumble you when Moses had the word in
[1:11:52] him to to be given out
[1:11:57] he became
[1:12:00] god well he wasn't Moses no
[1:12:04] more he had the word of the Lord for
[1:12:07] that
[1:12:08] age nothing could touch him till that
[1:12:11] was
[1:12:15] over so when the when the the the the
[1:12:18] pillow fire the word got into
[1:12:22] Moses and when he spoke that word it was
[1:12:25] the prophet says he wasn't Moses no
[1:12:27] more you couldn't even touch
[1:12:30] Moses imagine that you couldn't even
[1:12:32] touch
[1:12:33] Moses because he was God to the children
[1:12:36] of
[1:12:38] Israel because he had the word of God
[1:12:42] veiled in the human
[1:12:48] flesh and uh he says again um
[1:12:52] um yeah let me read I'll just read two
[1:12:54] more more quotes here in the message the
[1:12:57] unveiling of God he says now the
[1:13:01] world still they don't believe
[1:13:04] it no matter what they don't see
[1:13:08] it because it wasn't sent to
[1:13:12] them remember the Son of God was not
[1:13:14] revealed to
[1:13:18] Sodom two Messengers
[1:13:21] was God God God himself in human flesh
[1:13:25] was revealed to Abraham the
[1:13:29] election God in a human flesh was
[1:13:32] revealed to his
[1:13:36] elected how was he how was he revealed
[1:13:39] to
[1:13:41] Abraham he turned his back from to the
[1:13:44] tent to from the
[1:13:45] tent and and then when he gave the
[1:13:48] promise to Sarah that she was going to
[1:13:49] have a
[1:13:51] child she loved in her
[1:13:54] heart so she did not speak loud and she
[1:13:57] she laughed in her heart but God heard
[1:14:00] what what what Sarah
[1:14:02] said so he was revealing the thoughts of
[1:14:07] Sarah and then the prophet says that's
[1:14:09] how God revealed himself to his
[1:14:12] elected are you the
[1:14:15] elected if you are the elected that's
[1:14:17] how God Reve himself to
[1:14:20] you unless if you don't count yourself
[1:14:22] to be the elected but why would you why
[1:14:24] would
[1:14:28] God reveals God doesn't
[1:14:30] change if he did that like that no no
[1:14:33] wonder God says as as he was in the days
[1:14:35] of lot and Sodom
[1:14:39] Andor so shall it be in the in the
[1:14:42] coming of the Son
[1:14:44] of God in the human flesh revealing the
[1:14:47] secret of the heart
[1:14:49] of and remember there's a difference
[1:14:52] because Prophet says that when when um
[1:14:55] Moses uh when the word was his Moses
[1:14:57] that was
[1:14:59] God but when the word came out that
[1:15:01] Moses became
[1:15:03] Moses so he had times where he was just
[1:15:05] a normal man like us he make mistakes
[1:15:08] just like
[1:15:09] us but then you have you had to be you
[1:15:11] you had to recognize that when the word
[1:15:13] came in Moses there
[1:15:17] wases know just like when brother bam
[1:15:19] was uh when he was uh revealing the the
[1:15:22] thoughts of the heart of man
[1:15:26] it wasn't it wasn't the man that was
[1:15:28] doing
[1:15:29] it it was the angel of the Lord that was
[1:15:32] doing
[1:15:33] it at that moment that was God
[1:15:36] himself that was the he became the voice
[1:15:38] of God to
[1:15:41] us amen amen um the the prophet says the
[1:15:46] Gentile church has been blinded from the
[1:15:53] Veil and he says that's exactly what
[1:15:56] Israel failed to
[1:15:59] see if he would if it would have been
[1:16:02] some angel or
[1:16:06] something Israel would would have
[1:16:08] believed
[1:16:09] it so the prophet says that if there was
[1:16:12] like an angel and something like that
[1:16:14] that came down Israel would have
[1:16:16] believed but being it could not be an
[1:16:19] angel he had to be a
[1:16:22] man and he says God cannot break his
[1:16:27] word in the last days it has to be the
[1:16:30] same thing
[1:16:32] again what blinded the Israel that was
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:37] man that's what they killed him
[1:16:40] for and today because the message come
[1:16:44] through a man and not
[1:16:47] Angels because you just see a man that
[1:16:50] was born and he didn't have a he only
[1:16:52] had a seventh grade education
[1:16:55] Sade you know he was born in K
[1:16:58] Kentucky you know and then and he blinds
[1:17:00] the people they don't recognize they
[1:17:02] don't see God in the
[1:17:05] man because the message come to man and
[1:17:07] not
[1:17:10] Angel God can't change his
[1:17:13] way he cannot change his
[1:17:16] word and the Gentiles are just as blind
[1:17:19] today as Israel
[1:17:22] was because God veiled in a human
[1:17:26] being blinded the
[1:17:29] people don't be blinded by
[1:17:32] that amen
[1:17:36] amen now uh um and uh the prophet says
[1:17:40] that uh now God always like in his
[1:17:42] Prophet to
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:50] Eagles Moses was his
[1:17:53] messenger they were following
[1:17:55] Moses and that was the Eagle's Wings
[1:17:58] that they were carried on because he was
[1:17:59] packing God's
[1:18:03] message the prophet says they were
[1:18:05] following God as they followed Moses
[1:18:07] with his message of
[1:18:11] Deliverance so they were following God
[1:18:14] as they were following
[1:18:18] Moses so they weren't following Moses
[1:18:20] they were following God in
[1:18:23] Moses that pill fire from the bush that
[1:18:25] came into Moses that's why they were
[1:18:29] following and no wonder Paul says Paul
[1:18:32] said be followers of me as I am a
[1:18:34] follower of
[1:18:39] Christ it's not that you following Paul
[1:18:41] but you following the Christ in
[1:18:46] Paul when when the world out there they
[1:18:48] like they want to see
[1:18:50] Jesus where are they going to see
[1:18:53] Jesus it's in
[1:18:56] they follow Jesus as they follow
[1:19:00] you you know the the prophet says
[1:19:03] that the as the Bible says that you
[1:19:06] shall do the Greater
[1:19:08] Works he said that the greater work was
[1:19:10] not in quantity but it was in the
[1:19:14] quality and he says that that greater
[1:19:16] work was that man became a like you
[1:19:18] became able to impart eternal life into
[1:19:20] someone else
[1:19:26] when the word of God comes in you you
[1:19:28] become the word to the to the
[1:19:30] world they're looking for
[1:19:33] Jesus they're not going to see Jesus
[1:19:35] coming from heaven and they're going to
[1:19:38] see Jesus in
[1:19:39] you that's why the Bible says that ye
[1:19:41] are the light of the
[1:19:44] world the light is the word of God made
[1:19:47] manifest the prophet says in the
[1:19:49] beginning God said let there be
[1:19:53] light but he said he was just the word
[1:19:55] it because when Jesus said let there be
[1:19:58] light it took a few years for the light
[1:20:01] to to
[1:20:02] come but at that time it was just the
[1:20:05] word let there be
[1:20:07] light but when the light
[1:20:09] came it became the word of God
[1:20:13] manifested the prophet says that that's
[1:20:16] you see the the word of God becoming a
[1:20:18] reality in your
[1:20:20] life that's how that's how you are the
[1:20:22] the light up to the world
[1:20:25] if you don't see the word of God Made
[1:20:27] Real to you you're still living in
[1:20:32] darkness and the world cannot see Christ
[1:20:35] in your life because you are still in
[1:20:37] darkness the word of God has to become a
[1:20:40] reality to
[1:20:42] you and how does the word of God becomes
[1:20:44] a reality to
[1:20:46] you by faith you have to believe his
[1:20:49] word there's only one way that you can
[1:20:51] please
[1:20:53] God by
[1:20:55] faith and and then we are baptized into
[1:20:58] his body by one
[1:21:01] Spirit remember the spirit is
[1:21:04] light when when God descended upon the
[1:21:07] children of Israel in in the day of
[1:21:11] Pentecost
[1:21:12] saw fire as like tongues that came up on
[1:21:16] the the head of the
[1:21:20] disciples so they had the fire in
[1:21:23] them and they became the light to the
[1:21:26] world no you can be the light in your
[1:21:30] school you can be the light in your
[1:21:33] workplace but in order for you to become
[1:21:36] the light you have to meet the pillow of
[1:21:39] fire you have to let the pillow of fire
[1:21:41] change
[1:21:43] you don't let the pillow of fire blind
[1:21:45] you but let it change
[1:21:49] you there was one man by the name of
[1:21:53] Paul you know he was he was on his way
[1:21:55] to persecute the
[1:21:58] Christians you know but he met the
[1:22:00] pillow of fire one
[1:22:02] day he heard Paul Paul why persecuted
[1:22:06] thou
[1:22:07] me Paul also heard the
[1:22:10] voice so Paul also was another witness
[1:22:13] that heard the pill of fire that had a
[1:22:17] voice and the pill of fire said I
[1:22:21] Jesus and Paul came into contact with
[1:22:24] the the pillow of fire and that changed
[1:22:29] him so you you you you you you wonder
[1:22:32] why you keep on going around in circles
[1:22:34] you're not seeing a change in your
[1:22:38] life you just haven't met the pillow of
[1:22:42] fire Let Jesus Christ reveal himself to
[1:22:47] you Paul why persecute why are you
[1:22:50] persecuting
[1:22:51] me you know and then that same voice is
[1:22:54] speak speak to you also why are you
[1:22:56] persecuting
[1:22:58] me because you are putting Jesus Christ
[1:23:00] you crucifying Jesus Christ Again by by
[1:23:03] your
[1:23:05] sins the way you live you are crucifying
[1:23:08] crucifying Jesus Christ
[1:23:11] again the voice this morning is saying
[1:23:13] why are you persecuting
[1:23:15] me I came down and I Died For You on
[1:23:20] Calvary I love you so much that I left
[1:23:23] my comfort seat and came down for
[1:23:26] you but you are persecuting you're
[1:23:28] persecuting
[1:23:31] me take he to the
[1:23:33] voice of the pillow of
[1:23:35] fire because it's the voice of
[1:23:39] God it's always the I am it's always
[1:23:43] present amen
[1:23:46] amen so brother Bram also met the pillow
[1:23:49] of
[1:23:51] fire and as Moses was was sent with the
[1:23:54] message to get the children out of
[1:23:57] Egypt in the first
[1:24:00] Exodus the message of Moses was to get
[1:24:02] the children of Israel out of
[1:24:05] Egypt that was the first Exodus and then
[1:24:08] brother BR met the pillow of
[1:24:10] fire you know and he also had a message
[1:24:13] to get us out into the Third
[1:24:16] Exodus to get out of the life of
[1:24:20] sin to get life out of Creeds and dogs
[1:24:22] mas and traditions of this world
[1:24:28] and you have to believe his
[1:24:30] message because that's the only way
[1:24:34] out you can't even go to the Rapture
[1:24:36] without believing the message of the
[1:24:40] Propet because that is Rapture
[1:24:45] material John was said eat that book and
[1:24:50] prophesy and John the prophet says he
[1:24:52] represents the bride
[1:24:55] so you also have a part to
[1:24:58] play you got to hear the voice of
[1:25:01] God you know come out of there my
[1:25:04] people that's why this message is crying
[1:25:07] out
[1:25:09] today whatever sin sinful situation you
[1:25:12] are
[1:25:13] in the pill of fire you know came with a
[1:25:17] voice and telling you come out of
[1:25:21] there and then when God calls you he
[1:25:23] doesn't care what situation you are
[1:25:28] in because because God is the one that
[1:25:31] changes
[1:25:33] men he said though your sins may be red
[1:25:36] as a Scarlet I will make them white as
[1:25:42] snow even like the The Prostitute woman
[1:25:45] she was caught in the
[1:25:49] act but she came to Jesus and she and
[1:25:52] she was found now guilty
[1:25:57] why will God call you if he doesn't if
[1:25:59] he doesn't want to take care of
[1:26:02] you the Bible even says that he that
[1:26:04] began the good
[1:26:06] work fin
[1:26:08] work so when God calls on you you just
[1:26:11] have to
[1:26:12] surrender and Trust The
[1:26:15] Voice trust the calling trust that he
[1:26:18] will take care of
[1:26:20] you the call is come unto me ye are
[1:26:23] heavy laden
[1:26:25] and burden and I will give you
[1:26:28] rest we all have burdens here you know
[1:26:32] every your burdens might might not may
[1:26:34] not be my bur my
[1:26:36] burdens and my burdens may not be your
[1:26:40] burdens but I like that Jesus Jesus did
[1:26:42] not name a
[1:26:45] burden but he just said come unto me
[1:26:49] you bring me your
[1:26:52] burdens I will give you
[1:26:55] rest so what whatever thing is bothering
[1:26:58] you
[1:26:59] today bring it on to
[1:27:01] Jesus come to
[1:27:04] Jesus don't go seek solution out there
[1:27:06] in the
[1:27:08] world Jesus Is A
[1:27:10] Healer and he's the greatest healer
[1:27:13] ever and he's not just the Healer of the
[1:27:15] human flesh but he's the Healer of the
[1:27:19] Soul Your Soul has been afflicted by the
[1:27:22] the the disease of the
[1:27:26] come to Jesus he's the great
[1:27:30] physician you know he'll perform the
[1:27:33] surgery that no other man can
[1:27:37] do Jesus says that I will give you a new
[1:27:41] heart he will even perform a heart
[1:27:43] surgery in you he will remove the Heart
[1:27:46] of
[1:27:48] Stone the Heart of Stone
[1:27:50] means that you cannot comprehend you
[1:27:53] cannot get along with the of
[1:27:56] God you wonder you come to church to
[1:27:59] hear the word of God but you always go
[1:28:01] out the same
[1:28:03] person you come to church they tell you
[1:28:06] you know God God God works in many ways
[1:28:09] God can speak to you through me he can
[1:28:10] speak to you through the
[1:28:12] brother Through the Bible through
[1:28:16] anything and and but you have to make
[1:28:18] sure it's it's
[1:28:20] scriptural and God speaks to you but you
[1:28:23] always come out the
[1:28:25] same and it's been years years years you
[1:28:28] are still in the same
[1:28:31] condition and then you and then you you
[1:28:33] you said that but in my heart I want to
[1:28:35] do what's
[1:28:36] right in my heart I want to give my life
[1:28:39] to God but I just can't seem to do
[1:28:43] it the problem is that your heart hasn't
[1:28:46] been
[1:28:47] changed you still have a Heart of
[1:28:51] Stone it's Stone like it's stubborn
[1:28:54] Stone means it represents
[1:28:56] stubbornness you have a spirit of
[1:28:58] stubbornness in
[1:29:01] you but Jesus is the greatest
[1:29:04] healer he's the greatest physician you
[1:29:07] know and he says that he will remove the
[1:29:09] Heart of
[1:29:11] Stone and he will give you a heart of
[1:29:14] Flesh a tender heart you know and and
[1:29:17] and he says and I'll put I'll give you a
[1:29:19] new
[1:29:21] spirit and you don't stop there
[1:29:25] you know you know don't stop at just the
[1:29:29] spirit you speaking tongues you shouting
[1:29:31] the spirit you dance that's good but
[1:29:33] don't stop
[1:29:35] there you know cuz you can still do all
[1:29:37] those those stuff and still be
[1:29:41] lost the Bible says and I will put my
[1:29:44] spirit in
[1:29:45] you what is that spirit that that pill
[1:29:48] of
[1:29:49] fire that pill of fire also it doesn't
[1:29:52] just have to be in brother Bram it can
[1:29:53] also be in
[1:29:57] the the the the prophet says that he
[1:29:59] says that as the bride was as the voice
[1:30:02] was to the bride the bride will also be
[1:30:04] the voice to the
[1:30:07] world how do you become the voice to the
[1:30:09] world you have to receive the word you
[1:30:13] have to receive the pillow of fire and
[1:30:15] then your life is
[1:30:17] changed God the Bible says that God is a
[1:30:20] consuming
[1:30:21] fire I like that they compare to a
[1:30:25] fire because consuming fire consumes
[1:30:29] everything that's on it
[1:30:31] way if you see the volcano for
[1:30:34] instance it tears down everything that
[1:30:37] that's on his way and God is a billion
[1:30:40] times more than a
[1:30:43] volcano even the spirit of stubbornness
[1:30:45] God can consume
[1:30:48] that that Spirit of alcohol God can
[1:30:51] consume
[1:30:52] that that spirit of of gossiping God can
[1:30:55] consume
[1:30:57] that that sickness God can consume
[1:31:00] that even that cancer God can consume
[1:31:03] that there's not anything that's
[1:31:06] impossible to God you just have to take
[1:31:08] him at his
[1:31:10] word but it goes back to believing the
[1:31:13] voice for your
[1:31:16] age if you get the people to believe
[1:31:19] you not even cancer can stand in your
[1:31:22] way
[1:31:25] there are benefits to believe in this
[1:31:27] message of
[1:31:28] the it comes with
[1:31:30] benefits and benefit is that you can ask
[1:31:33] anything in my name and I'll give it to
[1:31:35] you speak to the to this mountain it
[1:31:38] shall be
[1:31:41] moved but you got to trust that
[1:31:44] voice you got to trust the
[1:31:49] voice Let's uh talking about trust trus
[1:31:52] in the voice let's um talk about
[1:31:55] Abraham Abraham is another person that
[1:31:57] heard the voice of
[1:31:59] God and Abra Abraham he wasn't even a
[1:32:02] Jew back
[1:32:04] then he was an Idol idol
[1:32:08] worshiper you know and God didn't care
[1:32:12] what condition Abraham was
[1:32:14] in and he still called
[1:32:17] him he's the same yesterday today
[1:32:20] for he doesn't care what kind of
[1:32:23] condition you are
[1:32:26] God can even call you even in the
[1:32:28] nightclub God can call
[1:32:31] you God's calling doesn't matter
[1:32:33] wherever you are or what situation you
[1:32:35] are
[1:32:37] in in God's Own time he'll make all
[1:32:40] things
[1:32:42] perfect in his time that's when he calls
[1:32:44] you and the Bible says that when you
[1:32:47] when you hear him call do not Harden
[1:32:49] your
[1:32:52] heart Abraham did not Harden his
[1:32:56] heart imagine this Abraham he just he
[1:33:00] never even heard of God or anything like
[1:33:02] that and he just hears a voice speaking
[1:33:04] to him telling him to get out of his
[1:33:06] father's house and to go into the land
[1:33:09] that God would give
[1:33:12] him you know and you and he the Bible
[1:33:15] says he got up and he took all his
[1:33:17] belongings and follow the
[1:33:22] voice and and and then they can benefits
[1:33:24] with following the
[1:33:28] voice and so Abraham is and God it
[1:33:31] wasn't the first time God kept speaking
[1:33:33] to Abraham God and so God Abraham became
[1:33:36] familiar he he knew he knew what the
[1:33:38] voice of God was
[1:33:40] like you know and one day you know I I
[1:33:43] spoke about that earlier he was in his
[1:33:45] tent and he saw those three men coming
[1:33:47] to
[1:33:48] him and he went out he went to them to
[1:33:50] greet
[1:33:51] them and um he cooked for them and and
[1:33:54] prepared good
[1:33:56] meal and and the prophet when he heard
[1:33:59] that voice that said where is thy wife
[1:34:03] Sarah brother says that Abraham was like
[1:34:06] he's like I recognize this this
[1:34:10] voice he said that's the same voice that
[1:34:13] spoke to me all those
[1:34:16] years you know it's the same voice so
[1:34:18] Abraham recogn you know there's
[1:34:20] something about the voice of God when
[1:34:22] you are a child of God you recogniz the
[1:34:24] voice of
[1:34:26] God when the voice of God comes to you
[1:34:29] you you recognize that that's the voice
[1:34:30] of
[1:34:32] God you know and brother brandham also
[1:34:35] had the same
[1:34:37] experience let me read this quote here
[1:34:39] real
[1:34:47] quick okay one second
[1:34:53] okay so in the message the gift and
[1:34:57] calling are without without
[1:35:02] repentance paragraph 17 the prophet
[1:35:05] said here's what
[1:35:08] happened I was sitting in my
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:13] study I seen the light spread out on the
[1:35:19] floor that pill of fire he saw that he
[1:35:21] said that spread out on the floor
[1:35:25] the same light that appeared to
[1:35:28] Paul and he say and this light was just
[1:35:30] above
[1:35:32] me and he had his arms folded so he's so
[1:35:37] he's talking about the experience of
[1:35:38] when he met the Lord Jesus Christ when
[1:35:40] he saw the Lord Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ and he had look as you don't see
[1:35:46] on the M on the face on on the face of a
[1:35:48] mortal
[1:35:54] he looked very calm and
[1:35:58] quiet very
[1:36:02] loving his voice when he
[1:36:05] spoke I knew it was the same voice that
[1:36:08] had spoke all down through life's
[1:36:13] journey but I I had never I had never
[1:36:16] seen his
[1:36:19] face that same voice that spoke to
[1:36:22] Samuel same that spoke to
[1:36:24] Moses the same voice that spoke to
[1:36:28] William and he he he but he had never
[1:36:31] seen his
[1:36:32] face there's just something
[1:36:35] about children of God we just there's
[1:36:37] something about the face of God why did
[1:36:40] Moses also wanted to see the face of
[1:36:43] God and God was keeping them from seeing
[1:36:47] his
[1:36:48] face and brother bam also was saying but
[1:36:50] I had never seen his face before
[1:36:53] Abraham had never seen his face before
[1:36:56] but he trusted his voice this is in
[1:36:59] 1950 so brother already started he
[1:37:02] trusted the voice and he started doing
[1:37:04] what the voice told him to
[1:37:05] do but yet he had never seen his
[1:37:08] face just like
[1:37:11] Abraham and but but I had never seen his
[1:37:14] face he was dark he was dark
[1:37:21] complexioned dark more like the Spanish
[1:37:24] or the Jewish
[1:37:29] people that's just the word so according
[1:37:31] to brother brandom Jesus Jesus was not
[1:37:34] white he was he had a dark complexion
[1:37:37] more like Spanish or the Jewish
[1:37:41] people he had his arms folded and and he
[1:37:45] looked to weight 200 PB in stature and
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:51] height um
[1:37:55] and and head hair to his shoulders and a
[1:37:59] smooth
[1:38:00] face and when he walked it seemed like
[1:38:02] there was a power he'll do
[1:38:06] anything and I was so scared I was
[1:38:09] biting my
[1:38:13] fingers just imagine standing face to
[1:38:15] face with something like
[1:38:20] that he said do not fear
[1:38:25] when that voice
[1:38:27] spoke I knew it was the same
[1:38:31] one so we we don't have a message by
[1:38:34] just brought that was brought up by a
[1:38:38] man we have a message that came from the
[1:38:40] Throne of
[1:38:42] God that same voice that spoke to
[1:38:45] Samuel that same voice is what told
[1:38:47] Brother Bram when he was young do not
[1:38:50] defile your
[1:38:51] body you know do not drink nor smoke for
[1:38:54] I work prepared for
[1:38:56] you but when he saw him he recognized
[1:38:58] that that was the same that was the Lord
[1:39:00] Jesus
[1:39:03] Christ Peter heard his
[1:39:06] voice and he changed Peter
[1:39:08] too you know because Peter wanted to uh
[1:39:12] abide by the
[1:39:14] Traditions that the Jews should not come
[1:39:16] in the same house with other people from
[1:39:19] other
[1:39:21] countries so he he was a holy ghost
[1:39:24] filled man but he was
[1:39:25] still abiding by the traditions of
[1:39:30] men just like we might we may have in
[1:39:32] the church people that they are still
[1:39:34] following every single tradition of the
[1:39:37] culture or or the
[1:39:39] country it doesn't mean you don't have
[1:39:41] the Holy
[1:39:42] Ghost but you just need to hear the
[1:39:44] voice you know when when Peter heard the
[1:39:46] voice he changed he
[1:39:49] Chang you know he changed he got rid of
[1:39:52] all those traditions
[1:39:55] and the prophet says in the message here
[1:39:56] his voice he says that's what the voice
[1:39:58] of God always
[1:39:59] does it changes men and
[1:40:02] women and makes them what they should
[1:40:07] be not what the schools and the teachers
[1:40:10] has
[1:40:13] made but what God has patterned them
[1:40:17] for the voice of God changes men and
[1:40:21] women you know you want to have a closer
[1:40:24] go walk with
[1:40:25] god listen to the voice of
[1:40:28] God and the voice of God you know God
[1:40:30] created even a technology back in the
[1:40:32] time of William Bram where he could even
[1:40:34] be recorded
[1:40:38] now and it's on these
[1:40:41] tips this message was not the message of
[1:40:43] William
[1:40:45] brandham it was the message of
[1:40:47] God and the message of God always
[1:40:50] changes the people
[1:40:53] if you just constantly listen to the
[1:40:57] message you will see a change in your
[1:40:59] life because it's something Supernatural
[1:41:02] that you can't even explain
[1:41:05] it just by hearing the word listening to
[1:41:08] the
[1:41:09] word you notice you start to love God
[1:41:13] more you know one time they asked
[1:41:15] brother someone wanted to have a closer
[1:41:17] walk with
[1:41:18] God they asked him how can I how can I
[1:41:21] how can I fall in love how can I love
[1:41:23] God
[1:41:25] more brother told him read your Bible
[1:41:28] and pray every
[1:41:31] day imagine I just read my Bible every
[1:41:34] day but it makes me love God
[1:41:40] more listen to the message it will
[1:41:43] change you you know don't listen now we
[1:41:46] have too
[1:41:47] many ministers that they they come with
[1:41:50] their own interpretation of of of the
[1:41:52] word of God
[1:41:54] but remember the word of God only comes
[1:41:55] to one man for the
[1:41:57] age and all of us have to refer back to
[1:42:00] what brother Bram
[1:42:03] said so even if anything I said today if
[1:42:06] you go home and you see that that's not
[1:42:07] the message come tell
[1:42:10] me because I don't want to preach
[1:42:12] anything outside of the
[1:42:14] message because the message is the life
[1:42:17] for our
[1:42:18] day that's how we get we we get life
[1:42:23] know when uh the prophet Ezekiel he was
[1:42:25] told Ezekiel prophesy to these Dry
[1:42:29] Bones those bones were
[1:42:32] dry you know and he prophesied and those
[1:42:36] bones came to
[1:42:38] life so you even if you dead
[1:42:42] spiritually listen to the voice of
[1:42:45] God you know it will it will uh awaken
[1:42:50] you like Lazarus was a dead person that
[1:42:53] also heard the voice of
[1:42:55] God he was four
[1:42:59] days well his body started roting
[1:43:02] already it goes back again to what I
[1:43:05] said
[1:43:05] earlier it it does not matter the
[1:43:08] condition that you are
[1:43:10] in when the voice of God calls on
[1:43:13] you it can restore you
[1:43:17] back Lazarus was dead four days
[1:43:21] according according to how things work
[1:43:23] after three days that's when your body
[1:43:25] start
[1:43:28] rotting you say Lord I think I'm too far
[1:43:33] gone you know I I've I've done too too
[1:43:36] many bad things in my life I don't even
[1:43:38] know if I can come back to
[1:43:40] you and it it may be true too that you
[1:43:43] are really like just like Lazar four
[1:43:45] days like you you were completely roten
[1:43:47] in
[1:43:50] sin but it doesn't matter to Jesus
[1:43:54] call on Jesus you know and he will he
[1:43:57] will rise you up you know amen
[1:44:01] amen man I I'll be finishing soon
[1:44:05] um so in the message here the voice of
[1:44:08] God the prophet
[1:44:10] says this morning might be the time that
[1:44:12] you make up your
[1:44:15] mind no okay I'll come back to this
[1:44:17] later let me move on okay uh in the
[1:44:21] message my commission message
[1:44:24] in I don't know which paragraph but
[1:44:25] you'll find it there he said the prophet
[1:44:28] says this he says I'm just your brother
[1:44:31] I'm just your brother by the grace of
[1:44:36] God but when the angel of the Lord moves
[1:44:42] down it becomes then a voice of God to
[1:44:46] you I'm just your brother just like he
[1:44:50] said Moses sometimes he was Moses
[1:44:52] sometimes he became God to the children
[1:44:54] I'm just your brother as a brother I
[1:44:57] can't make
[1:44:58] mistakes but when the angel comes
[1:45:01] down the angel doesn't make any
[1:45:05] mistakes when the angel of the Lord
[1:45:07] moves down he becomes then a voice of
[1:45:10] God to
[1:45:11] you and he says maybe if I offended you
[1:45:15] by saying that forgive
[1:45:18] me but I felt that might be resented
[1:45:25] but I am God's voice to
[1:45:28] you at first he said forgive
[1:45:31] me but he felt like he said I felt like
[1:45:33] some people they didn't feel good about
[1:45:35] me saying I'm I'm the voice of God to
[1:45:38] you just like some people this morning
[1:45:41] they might feel some type of way of
[1:45:42] saying that the prophet William Bram is
[1:45:44] the voice of God for our
[1:45:48] day I'm God you and he says I say that
[1:45:52] again that time that was under
[1:45:57] inspiration I felt bad about it the
[1:46:00] first
[1:46:02] time but it
[1:46:05] repeated so you notice it wasn't even
[1:46:07] brother Bram who spoke that Second
[1:46:11] Son the pill of fire that was in
[1:46:14] him said I am God's voice to
[1:46:18] you and brought B him as a he got back
[1:46:21] as a man he said I'm
[1:46:25] but the pill of fire said no you don't
[1:46:26] have to be
[1:46:28] sorry I am God's voice to
[1:46:32] you you know the the that and and then
[1:46:35] he still God's voice to us
[1:46:39] today and he says I cannot I cannot say
[1:46:42] nothing in myself but in myself what he
[1:46:46] show and the prophet says that know a
[1:46:48] voice carries a message
[1:46:53] it doesn't make sense for a voice to
[1:46:54] just come and just say a bunch of
[1:46:57] nonsense when someone like I'm speaking
[1:46:59] right now I'm carrying a
[1:47:01] message and and then and then and then
[1:47:04] the prophet says that you know okay let
[1:47:07] me before I read that the pro um uh you
[1:47:09] know Moses he he when he he met God he
[1:47:12] went into the pillow of
[1:47:14] fire he came down with a
[1:47:16] message but that was a message of the
[1:47:20] law he brought the Ten Commandments
[1:47:24] and we also have a prophet in our day
[1:47:27] because remember the prophet said Moses
[1:47:28] went into the pill of
[1:47:32] fire Moses went into the
[1:47:35] cloud cu the Bible says it was like a
[1:47:38] thick
[1:47:40] cloud and we also have a prophet who
[1:47:42] he's actually went inside the cloud
[1:47:46] too gone inside the pillar of
[1:47:48] fire and he brought us back a message
[1:47:53] you know but this time it's not a
[1:47:54] message of love but it's a message of
[1:47:57] Grace it's a message of
[1:48:00] mercy no matter what condition you are
[1:48:02] in if you if you listen if you hearken
[1:48:04] unto my voice you will be set
[1:48:08] free I think about there was
[1:48:11] a there was the One Vision or something
[1:48:14] like that that the prophet had that
[1:48:16] people were Bound in
[1:48:20] cages and then and then there couldn't
[1:48:22] be set free I think he was the children
[1:48:24] of
[1:48:27] God and then the prophet William Bram
[1:48:30] had to speak and say House of Hell give
[1:48:35] away and he said as soon as soon as he
[1:48:38] said
[1:48:39] that those those those cages were open
[1:48:42] and and all those people were set
[1:48:45] free you can find it out in the quot
[1:48:47] I'll find it for next
[1:48:49] time so the people that were Bound in
[1:48:51] sin
[1:48:53] Bound by
[1:48:55] Satan the voice of the Prophet William
[1:49:02] brandham that's why you got to listen to
[1:49:04] these
[1:49:06] tapes don't just come to church and just
[1:49:08] hear the the Minister preach and you
[1:49:09] that teeth and you never ever hear the
[1:49:11] voice of
[1:49:13] God go home and listen to the message he
[1:49:16] will change
[1:49:18] you that message is not it's not dead
[1:49:21] God you cannot confine God into space or
[1:49:24] something like
[1:49:26] that there there are many testimonies of
[1:49:29] people that
[1:49:30] even they got healed while listening to
[1:49:33] the
[1:49:34] prophet you know in the prayer line they
[1:49:37] got
[1:49:38] heal because the pillow of fire is never
[1:49:40] that I was it's always that I
[1:49:44] am when you listen to the the message of
[1:49:46] God you have to apply that to your
[1:49:48] condition
[1:49:50] today this pill of fire is not just on
[1:49:53] these
[1:49:54] pictures but it's even in this room
[1:49:56] right now because Jesus says that
[1:49:58] wherever two or three are G in my
[1:50:02] name I the pillow of fire shall be
[1:50:06] there he's not here in the form of Jesus
[1:50:09] Christ but he's in the form of the
[1:50:10] pillow of
[1:50:11] fire because Jesus says that I come from
[1:50:15] God and I return back to
[1:50:18] God he came from God he was the pillow
[1:50:20] of Fire
[1:50:22] the pill of fire made became
[1:50:25] flesh and God dwelt in the in the temple
[1:50:28] of Jesus
[1:50:31] Christ and the difference between the
[1:50:34] the pill of fire dwelling in brother
[1:50:36] Bram and
[1:50:37] Jesus even you and me and Jesus is that
[1:50:41] in Jesus dwell the fullness of
[1:50:44] God brother Bram doesn't have the
[1:50:46] fullness of God in him because the
[1:50:49] fullness of God makes you God
[1:50:52] because when you have the fullness of
[1:50:54] God we can worship
[1:50:55] you but you cannot worship brother
[1:50:58] abam the B the prophet says that God
[1:51:00] only put his name in one man where where
[1:51:03] the worshiper can
[1:51:06] worship we we do not worship in the name
[1:51:08] of William
[1:51:10] brandham we worship in the name of the
[1:51:12] Lord Jesus Christ we are baptized in the
[1:51:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[1:51:17] saved in the in the name of the Lord
[1:51:19] Jesus Christ we are healed in the name
[1:51:21] of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:24] the captive are set free in the name of
[1:51:26] the Lord Jesus
[1:51:27] Christ we receive our our request in the
[1:51:30] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:32] Christ not in the name of William
[1:51:39] BR the the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:51:44] tower you know and and and and the
[1:51:46] righteous run into it and he
[1:51:49] safe your safety is not under the name
[1:51:51] of William Bram
[1:51:54] your safety is in the name of the Lord
[1:51:55] Jesus
[1:51:56] Christ the world is falling apart you
[1:51:59] know we drawing night night to the
[1:52:02] end we see Bill Mark zukerberg the
[1:52:06] billionaire he's building a huge uh
[1:52:10] underground bunk
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] bunker that's costing billions and
[1:52:18] billions of
[1:52:19] dollarss why is he doing that the world
[1:52:22] is they the world can't even see that we
[1:52:25] actually drawing night to the
[1:52:27] end they're looking for a refuge made of
[1:52:32] men but they're finding the wrong
[1:52:35] Refuge our refuge is in Jesus
[1:52:38] Christ in in his Pavilion shall he hide
[1:52:42] me we want God to hide
[1:52:45] us to hide us from the Wrath that's
[1:52:48] coming brothers and sisters if you are
[1:52:51] not in Christ Jesus Christ
[1:52:53] it's time to
[1:52:54] repent because you don't know when the
[1:52:57] Lord is going to call on
[1:52:59] you it could be even walking out of this
[1:53:02] door you don't know where might be your
[1:53:04] last
[1:53:05] call the coming of the Lord to you maybe
[1:53:08] you getting struck by a car accident or
[1:53:13] something why do you always put things
[1:53:15] in the future
[1:53:17] or because here's the thing you can you
[1:53:21] can lie to us or to your brother to your
[1:53:23] sister but you can never lie to
[1:53:27] yourself each and every person of us
[1:53:29] here this
[1:53:30] morning knows that
[1:53:33] today if the Lord had to call on me if
[1:53:36] it was my time to go you know exactly if
[1:53:39] you were going to heaven
[1:53:42] on you might come to church and fool us
[1:53:44] and and ask like a good brother
[1:53:47] all but in your heart you know your
[1:53:50] condition and guess what you're not the
[1:53:53] only person that knows God also knows
[1:53:54] your
[1:53:57] condition that's it's too
[1:53:59] late you know let's get back to the
[1:54:03] voice of
[1:54:04] god let's make ourself
[1:54:07] ready
[1:54:09] know amen amen
[1:54:12] amen all right so um I hope I'll finish
[1:54:19] this okay um these are the
[1:54:22] what the Waters of
[1:54:25] Separation uh the prophet
[1:54:27] says someday I got to meet you everyone
[1:54:32] and and almighty God knows that that
[1:54:37] light that you see on that
[1:54:39] picture is standing not two feet from
[1:54:42] not two feet from where I am right
[1:54:45] now that's the
[1:54:47] truth and it's moving into my right side
[1:54:54] and in another quote he says again that
[1:54:57] um um uh in a message how the angel came
[1:55:01] to me and his commission paragra
[1:55:03] 282 and while I'm talking about it the
[1:55:07] same light that's on the
[1:55:10] picture you know there's something about
[1:55:12] when you talk about Jesus he always
[1:55:13] shows
[1:55:14] up that's why you should have Godly
[1:55:18] conversations because when you have
[1:55:20] Godly conversation you invite Jesus
[1:55:21] Christ
[1:55:24] and when Jesus Christ comes he always
[1:55:25] leaves you with a
[1:55:27] blessing we all want blessings in our
[1:55:29] lives spiritual Financial or any other
[1:55:33] way start talking about Jesus he will
[1:55:36] come visit you Jesus love when they talk
[1:55:39] about
[1:55:41] him he says when talking about
[1:55:44] it talking about that
[1:55:48] light but I uh uh but I know uh uh
[1:55:51] standing not two feet from where I'm
[1:55:53] standing right
[1:55:56] now and I know it's settling with inside
[1:55:59] of me right
[1:56:02] now and if you could only know the
[1:56:05] difference when the power of almighty
[1:56:07] God catches and how that look the things
[1:56:09] look
[1:56:12] different now things like that is why it
[1:56:16] causes a lot of
[1:56:18] confusion and people tend to worship the
[1:56:21] man
[1:56:24] because his message is his ministry is
[1:56:26] so powerful that people even mistake him
[1:56:29] for Jesus
[1:56:31] Christ but he's not he's not Jesus
[1:56:34] Christ in the in the church book The
[1:56:37] Prophet says I want to make one more
[1:56:39] comparison between the leodan prophet
[1:56:42] messenger and
[1:56:46] John the people in John's day they
[1:56:48] mistook him for the Messiah
[1:56:58] now this last day prophets Messenger
[1:57:00] will have such power before the
[1:57:07] Lord that there will be those who
[1:57:09] mistaken for the Lord
[1:57:11] Jesus so brother already warned that
[1:57:14] because that Ministry was will be so
[1:57:16] powerful that people would even think
[1:57:18] that he's Jesus Christ
[1:57:22] and even um there's one of the brothers
[1:57:24] two one of the two brothers that went
[1:57:26] with um the
[1:57:28] prophet on the mountain in Arizona when
[1:57:30] the cloud appear one of that brother
[1:57:33] that even he even saw the
[1:57:36] cloud you know it confused him so much
[1:57:39] that
[1:57:40] now now he's even calling William Bram
[1:57:43] to be
[1:57:44] God he he I saw that it's on YouTube
[1:57:47] that video he's actually
[1:57:50] worshiping because he says that the
[1:57:52] things that he saw out of that man he's
[1:57:54] never seen like he just had to
[1:57:56] be but the prophet warned
[1:57:58] that those things will
[1:58:01] come but he says that but but don't you
[1:58:04] believe
[1:58:06] it he's not
[1:58:08] Jesus he's not the Son of God he's one
[1:58:12] of the
[1:58:13] Brethren I'm not he but but he about he
[1:58:16] he's coming after
[1:58:19] me let's wrap it up real quick here
[1:58:24] now so so I said this earlier in my
[1:58:27] message but in the same same uh book The
[1:58:30] Prophet says that God still has a voice
[1:58:33] for the people of the
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:40] world even as he has given a voice to
[1:58:44] the
[1:58:45] bride the the voice is in the
[1:58:49] Bride As we have said and we about it
[1:58:52] later so the prophet is telling us that
[1:58:54] that voice that spoke to
[1:58:56] Moses that voice that we read that spoke
[1:58:58] to
[1:58:59] Samuel that voice that spoke to William
[1:59:02] brandham now it's no longer just in
[1:59:04] William brandham but it's in the bride
[1:59:07] now that voice is in the bride and he
[1:59:11] says that we're going to be the we're
[1:59:13] going to be the voice to the
[1:59:17] world so it doesn't just stop William
[1:59:20] Brenham you also have a part
[1:59:24] you know Satan Satan Satan doesn't care
[1:59:28] if you if you just point if you just
[1:59:29] keep oh Willam oh he spoke he spoke to
[1:59:32] the he spoke the the squirrels into
[1:59:33] existence oh he did this he did this
[1:59:36] Satan is okay with that he I mean he
[1:59:38] can't even agree with
[1:59:41] you you know but he the problem that he
[1:59:44] has is when you take that word that was
[1:59:47] spoken and start to leave it where the
[1:59:50] voice is no longer just the voice of
[1:59:52] William
[1:59:53] Brown but the voice now is in
[1:59:56] you and where like as he was told to
[1:59:59] John prophesy you know because John now
[2:00:03] had the word in him he had the voice you
[2:00:07] know you can impart eternal life into
[2:00:09] your
[2:00:11] brother sometimes your brother can go
[2:00:14] into a situations where you you probably
[2:00:16] don't even need to pray you can just
[2:00:17] speak things into existence and that
[2:00:19] come to pass
[2:00:23] not everybody's there but we we will all
[2:00:25] have to get there before the
[2:00:28] Rapture because the word has to be in us
[2:00:33] too so the last quote I
[2:00:36] have is um so remember
[2:00:40] Moses Moses he wanted to see the face of
[2:00:45] God but he couldn't see the face of
[2:00:48] God because the prophet says because at
[2:00:50] that time the lamb had hadn't been
[2:00:52] hadn't be had hadn't been
[2:00:56] slain because it was just the blood of
[2:00:59] bulls and
[2:01:00] goats but when Jesus Christ when Jesus
[2:01:04] Christ died on the
[2:01:07] cross the Bible says that the veil in
[2:01:09] the temple rented
[2:01:13] rent and it says that Christ was there
[2:01:16] on the cross in plain
[2:01:18] view and no wonder Jesus told them that
[2:01:20] you have uh if you have seen me you've
[2:01:23] seen the
[2:01:25] father Moses couldn't see the face of
[2:01:29] God you know but we've been privileged
[2:01:32] in our
[2:01:33] day to see the face of
[2:01:35] God God so loved us so much that he did
[2:01:38] not just want to show that to just
[2:01:40] William
[2:01:41] brandham but he also wanted to show that
[2:01:43] to the
[2:01:44] bride to let you know that now the voice
[2:01:46] is in the
[2:01:48] bride and he came down in
[2:01:50] 1963 you know in the cloud you know and
[2:01:54] there finally you can see the the face
[2:01:56] of God so that pillow of
[2:01:59] fire that was in that spoke to Moses in
[2:02:01] the burning
[2:02:03] Bo that pill of fire now all of a sudden
[2:02:06] we can see his
[2:02:07] face Moses desired to see his
[2:02:10] face but he couldn't but you you at
[2:02:13] least can see his face I took this
[2:02:16] picture of that I wanted to show you
[2:02:19] it's the cloud
[2:02:22] you know you know all everybody can at
[2:02:26] least see a see a face
[2:02:31] here you know I think even if I ask any
[2:02:33] of the kid to tell me if they can see
[2:02:36] can you see the
[2:02:38] eyes come come show us where the
[2:02:44] eyes right you know Moses couldn't see
[2:02:48] this but now even a child can see this
[2:02:53] that's the that's the message that we
[2:02:54] have
[2:02:55] received you know and he becomes as a
[2:02:58] judge because this the prophet says that
[2:03:01] this uh the
[2:03:03] cloud in England it's it was the judge
[2:03:06] that used to to wear like wi white white
[2:03:12] wig this shows us supreme authority the
[2:03:16] word of
[2:03:17] God that's why this message
[2:03:20] is and the prophet in the message the
[2:03:22] rising of the sun he
[2:03:24] says he says um Can he's describing this
[2:03:28] picture right he says can you see his
[2:03:32] eyes can you see his nose can you see
[2:03:34] his mouth and the congregation says amen
[2:03:38] I'm going to ask you can you see his
[2:03:40] eyes that pill of fire that Moses
[2:03:43] couldn't see now you are you are blessed
[2:03:45] to see
[2:03:47] this can you see his his
[2:03:50] ears can you see his nose you know can
[2:03:54] you see his
[2:03:56] hair it's Jesus Christ of Jehovah of the
[2:04:00] Old Testament Jesus Christ of the New
[2:04:05] Testament and they come with a
[2:04:08] blessing you know so just to let you
[2:04:11] know that this message is not a message
[2:04:13] by a man it's God who sent us this
[2:04:16] message and he came to
[2:04:20] vindicate you know so that's why you
[2:04:22] have to listen to the message
[2:04:25] home because it will change
[2:04:28] you it has
[2:04:30] power no it did not just stay in the in
[2:04:33] 1963 or
[2:04:36] 196 the power is in us
[2:04:40] now amen
[2:04:43] amen all right all right
[2:04:53] okay the last sorry I keep saying but
[2:04:55] this is really the last
[2:04:56] quote in the message blind uh
[2:05:02] bimus he said that um in paragraph
[2:05:08] 323 he says that I challenge your faith
[2:05:11] to
[2:05:14] that yeah don't believe me but believe
[2:05:18] him cuz I'm just a
[2:05:20] man just
[2:05:22] uh like this
[2:05:24] microphone it isn't a microphone you're
[2:05:27] hearing it's my voice so then it's it
[2:05:31] isn't me that you're hearing it's
[2:05:35] him the Jesus Christ that walked on
[2:05:39] Galilee when you read the Bible you see
[2:05:41] those those those words in
[2:05:44] red and when brother comes with thus
[2:05:47] sayth the
[2:05:48] Lord he says it's no longer I that
[2:05:51] speaks
[2:05:52] no you just hear you you're hearing my
[2:05:54] voice but it's not
[2:05:55] me it's the pill of fire inside of me
[2:05:58] that's speak it's the angel of the
[2:06:02] Lord and invite the angel of the Lord in
[2:06:04] your
[2:06:05] house invites the angel of the Lord in
[2:06:07] any situation that you are
[2:06:10] in no and do not try to to think that
[2:06:13] you're smarter than the message the
[2:06:17] messenger because the messenger is being
[2:06:19] led by the pill of Fire he was led by
[2:06:22] the pill of fire and in in the book of
[2:06:24] Exodus where where the where the pill of
[2:06:26] fire stopped the children of Israel
[2:06:28] stopped and if he continues again they
[2:06:30] go and and that's the same thing with us
[2:06:33] today if brother bam stopped on
[2:06:36] something and you want to tell me that
[2:06:38] you know more than
[2:06:39] him he was following the pillar of fire
[2:06:43] follow me as I follow
[2:06:45] Christ oh God bless you
