waters who around him we're troubled aDNA height fear filled their hearts they thought that they would die they failed to remember that the master was nigh he spoke low words and the winds all Stood Still and even the waters they obeyed his will become their storm just like you will do mine if all just remember that he lives deep inside why should I worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus say he's always near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name till the storm passes by we read in a Bible how he walked with them brought light to their targets went away cruise so damn how great it would be to have his steps leading nine walk with the master Oh the time when trials come and tip seems so night I'll just call on my master I know I'll get there on time and when I'm in trouble and my body is in pain all I have to do is to call on his name why should I worry why should I fear when the very Saint Jesus he's a soul raised near he lives in my heart and he hears when I cry I'll call on his name to the store passes by why should I worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus he stays always here he lives in my heart and here's when I cry I'll call on its name to the storm passes by [Laughter] I'll call on instead [Music] I'll call on his name I'll call on his name to the store passes by I pass by [Laughter] [Music] just recently they make a here me brother Troy is it on now okay sorry about that so I got a big enough mouth as it is I couldn't tell whether it was on or off be honest with you bet we picked this a little song up some time ago a little family called the Collinsworth family I've ever heard and we like this I can trust Jesus it's just a little simple song but I really liked the message in it sing take your time [Music] God picks up a sparrow that could no longer and he brushed off its roots and then watched it soaring to the sky if he's mindful of Grisha on this I can't eat I am his child and I can place all my trust I can trust Jesus to meet my knee it is nice that straight day my wenis I can trust Jesus he takes care of me and I have prayed some prayers and thought they never were her oh but I felt you cut and kept on trusting in his [Music] I want and calm desires don't always agree but a lien on his will for he always knows what's best I can trustees I can trust my strength in my weakness I can trust Jesus he takes care of me [Music] my etus I can't trust Jesus he takes care of me I can't trust Jesus because he he takes care of me a man better hurry [Music] [Music] [Music] God is changing me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God is changing [Music] is changing let's stand together this one race the Lord well brother Keith if you ever wondered if yous ever led of the Lord you know it now let's turn to 2nd Peter chapter 2 he was pray and he found out the virtues and those things and it just so happened that's what I'm gonna preach on this morning hey man I want to speak to you on Jacob's Ladder Jacob's Ladder let's go 2nd Peter and then we want to go back to the book of Genesis in just a moment 2nd Peter 1 verse 1 amen God's changing this little by little and aren't you glad that he is a man I am too amen 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God our Savior and Jesus Christ according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness watch very carefully through the knowledge of him you realize that your salvation wasn't even through your own knowledge you had no awareness of it you had no knowledge of it but through his knowledge his knowledge that's what's called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election Shore for if you do these things ye shall never fall what a promise of God let's turn to Genesis Genesis chapter 28 a man Jacob's Ladder he was climbing one ladder were climbing maybe a different understanding of it same ladder but just a different look of it Genesis 28 on the sub pick up verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set upon the earth the top of it reached to heaven will the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and the god of Isaac the land were in the alliance to thee will I give it and to I seed amen verse 17 actually verse 16 let's just pick that part Jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not he was afraid he said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven the gate of heaven the house of God and the gate of heaven let's ask the Lord to bless the word can we father thank you for the message now thank you for the Bible thank you for truth bless it now as we receive in Jesus name a man st. said a man you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good now we want to look at this you know in a light of understanding what we know about the statue of a perfect man knowing that this particular portion of Scripture that we read is probably one of the most important things that we know of in the entire message it's even more important than seals thunders and all these great mysteries of God because without this character none of the opening of the word can really benefit a person they can have all of the mysteries of God yet missed this and they're sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal so these things are very important for us as the children of God and we realize that each stair step or each ladder rung as we're kind of bringing a comparison between these two will be a progressive move in the life of a child of God they'll grow from faith the virtue to knowledge and so on and so forth until they come to the place of their adoption or the positioning of a child of God where that their name is just as good on the checkbook as daddy's is so God is looking for somebody that has the character has the ability to be able to take upon themselves all of God's divine characteristics now something that we want to look at as we study this this morning is that first of all I want you to if you're writing things down or you like to keep notes I want you to study this remark and remember that this is God's divine nature this is not the nature of man this is not the nature of a bishop or a priest or a prophet or teacher or past or anybody else this is the nature of the Holy Ghost himself and to try to add these characteristics without the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Prophet said is like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in himself he says not nature given it's not nature born and so therefore he's just taking a peacock feather and sticking it in there hoping that he can fool somebody but to the elect of God she will not be just putting peacock feathers in not just a feather of temperance and a feather brotherly kindness but she is going to produce this by the nature of Christ God's very nature is going to live out of her now what I love about this particular scripture is the way that Peter starts this this is one of my favorite parts of the entire Bible because I love how he starts that Simon Peter serve apostle Jesus Christ notice his name to them that have obtained like precious faith hey man I like that cuz see that could be all of us amen don't have to be any certain age or any certain generation but all of us have obtained like precious faith if we are in the righteousness of God and in our Savior Jesus Christ those on the outside they don't even know what we're talking about but to those that have obtained like precious faith and then he tells us that God wants to multiply grace and peace through the knowledge of God and through Jesus Christ so this is a a message of multiplication this is a message of growth this is a add to your and add to this and add to that so God wants us to be able to add to our Christian character all of those elements that will make us like Jesus how many wants to be like Jesus is 1 raise your hand well this is what's gonna make us like that without this divine character in our life then we are just people called by the name of Christian but we're really not a Christian just in the way of action and behavior and all that just yet because Christ for Christian is to be christ-like or to be just like him which means my faith is like him my knowledge is like him my patience is like him my brotherly love is like him amen all of that is like him so if I'm not like him then I'm not really a Christian I'm just a churchgoer we got too many of those around the ranks of this message we don't need to be just churchgoers we want to be Christians full of the Holy Ghost and then somebody said well I'm a message believer I said wonderful I'm a Christian some I said how about a message church I said wonderful I'm in the body of Christ there's a big difference between being in a church amen and then being a Christian altogether being in a church doesn't make you any more of a Christian than standing in a garage makes you a car come on zymotic a man to be a Christian means you must be in Christ are you with me Amen now watch this now I just love this Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 now as we study this morning let's just add a few things here to the text and and and add to our face and virtue and knowledge and temperance or what more now remember that Christ is looking for the same spirit Romans 8:11 if the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ be in you it shall also quicken your mortal body so he's looking for the same in Minnesota some time ago I never will forget but the Brooks preaching a message about Jesus being the same and I've used this example all over the world I guess about the same and it's true when we were children I would play a little matching game you know the cards you turn them over on the table and you'd have to turn them over and match them up you didn't want the old mate if you got her you lost the game but as you turn them over you had to match and you can't match them one to the other to the other and they had to be the same or else you couldn't continue on so then of course as we look at the Christian life in this age Jesus is like turning those cards over and he's looking for the same character can I say the way brother branham said it he's looking for something to dub tail together he's looking for a life to dovetail together that my life in your life will vulcanize with his life a man that it will be the same the exact same character the same life now watch this Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 now what I think is beautiful about this scripture is that sometimes people misinterpret this part of the Bible so quickly and when they read this word PE RF EC T it scares them to death sometimes because in their mind and listen I'm the same as you are I know my life I know what kind of man I am I know what kind of mistakes I make I know what kind of weaknesses I have I know my tendencies to do things right tendencies do things wrong and when I read that little word PE RF EC T it scares me to death until you get an understanding of what the word really means now Jesus here saying be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now you say now brother being how in the world is the bride ever going to achieve perfection well I'm glad you asked me I'm gonna tell you this morning by the help of the Lord amen now one thing I want you to notice if you got a Scofield Bible this morning there's a reference that he uses there that he references a Greek word and as he references this Greek word it is the Greek word Telos which defines what the word perfect means I want you to listen at what this word says and just tell me if we this we can achieve this by the grace of God now it let me just say it this way if I say it this way first if I read it the way we think it it means never make a mistake never do nothing wrong never have a bad thought never have a wrong idea never do anything to slip-up or a backslide or get discouraged that's our definition of perfect the words a man in case you didn't know I just looking to see if you come on with me a little bit all right now that's our definition of perfect can you say ma'am that's our definition but here's the Bible definition of being perfect which means to be a full age to bring it to its end to finish the work to complete something not wanting anything necessary to its completeness to be an adult to be mature now which definition you think is more achievable the first one I gave which is usually our definition we can't hardly achieve that for love the money as I guarantee the very moment everybody looking for a perfect church well at the moment you show up we've done ruined it ain't no perfect Church a man a perfect assembly when I come preached that I've done ruined it because I ain't perfect myself hey man there's no such thing as earthly perfection we're looking for a day when we'll never have a bad thought never do anything wrong never make a mistake that is not Bible perfection but Bible perfection is you may not always do it right but you'll reach an age in Christ to where when you do when you do make a mistake and do wrong you will know how to correct it you'll know how to deal with it you'll know how to act like a full-grown adult with it Amen people that are real full-grown Christians friends they can understand very quickly how to correct a wrong when they've made a mistake and done something wrong come on somebody hey listen to Nate this thing of well glory to God I'm gonna reach a place I'm never going to make a mistake I'll learn how to deal with my mistakes I'll learn how to govern my mistakes I'll learn how to answer for the mistakes and the wrongs that I do and learn how to correct them as we go along in life and and watch for those things and I don't get involved in messes and gone and what more like that gone that's a southern word I just mean a mess amen amen but your mess is my gone my gum is your mess alright are you with me alright perfect a full age now James chapter 1 verse 4 now I want you to look at this how the Bible identifies perfection and we're just looking at this because what we're talking about is climbing up jacob's ladder until the bride comes to a place of perfection now remember no man or woman can be perfect in any way outside of the blood of Jesus Christ do you know what makes you and I really perfect the fact that when we make a mistake we can repent and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and unrighteousness that's what makes me perfect that's what makes me whole that's what makes me tzimmes in the eyes of God it ain't got nothing to do with how good I am it ain't got none to do with how good you are it is about the grace of God that's been ministered to you and I Amen said James chapter 1 verse 4 now watch how the Bible said but let patience have her perfect word now this is a strange scripture in a way 99% of the time that you read the Bible you will always see the Bible identifies the masculine part you'll notice uh most of your scriptures will say him and we'll say to he or to him the works that I do shall he do also in the last days the manifestation of the sons doesn't say daughters doesn't say her doesn't say she always addresses the male because the male is the head of all the household the male is the head of his domain and so addresses the head and the head makes a way for the rest of the body so the women are included of course and all these things as I say something about the manifestation of sons well if there's a manifestation of the son of God there is a daughter of God somewhere following that example that would be manifested the same way but the Bible always addresses sons always addresses him until we come to this part here and of all the scriptures that you could read I just go study it sometimes Steve I'm telling the truth all of a sudden now it's a her wonder why he's talking to her her that needs to make this manifest it's the bride part that drinks this forth Alleluia but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be PE R FA CT I don't forget that doesn't mean never make a mistake never do nothing wrong never have an error never have a bad thought that's the human definition which I'm not the Bible definition of perfection full grown adult mature complete amen but let patience have her perfect word that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing do you understand we can come to a place in Christ so where we can see is very characteristics pressing out of our flesh living out of our life and we realize I am just like him but friends in order for us to see this in ourselves we are going to have to disqualify all of the other stuff that we see you know what our biggest problem is as far as human beings go we focus too much on the negative side we see every mistake we make with you yeah we consider every wrong we've ever thought we look at all of the bad parts about us and we don't measure up to that good part that's living out of us amen the very fact that you're sitting in this church this morning is the miracle of your life you could have walked out of here been back slid years ago but why are you here God in His mercy let you stand when there wasn't nothing to stand for amen count that is something well I made a lot of mistakes sure but you're here amen I said you're here you may see me somewhere else you could be anywhere in the world but you're right here right now why God has put a character in your life to help you endure through this evil age it's gonna get harder than gonna get easier it's gonna get tougher as we go along now let's look at our first corinthians chapter 13 verse 10 oh my do you love the lord well praise the lord i love him too that's that's good we must be brothers and sisters amen let patience have your print undeterred translation James 1:4 said that your patience will be crowned with perfectness your patience will be crowned with perfection with entirety with completeness your patience Laurie will be crowned with perfectness oh thank you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah first cut in chapter 13 verse 10 now many people have a tendency dub I don't want to say twist I don't want to make it sound like people do things on purpose but sometimes they do but sometimes they misunderstands a better way and they use this scripture to kindly put gifts out and put Holy Ghost out and put emotions and things out but that's not what the Bible is saying here when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with now in our minds we read this and a lot of times people say well that goes to prove errs no more gifts and there's no more emotions and I see different folks around here you might some of you might be represented from the continent of Africa and and I I know that there's a move I just returned there earlier last year and I've been three or four times the last couple of years and I run into several brothers and there's a move on that continent of course it's one of the one of the largest moves I've recognized that's trying to say well we're in the word now therefore we don't need worship we don't need gifts and we don't need emotions and we don't need all in things and and they use this scripture to try to say such a thing to the believers and I just told them over there when I preach the convention some time ago I'll tell you what that spirit come from the US as that's what the idea that a lot of people have got around this message and now we got the word we shouldn't worship we shouldn't stand in clap we shouldn't holler a man we shouldn't cry we shouldn't shout but that ain't what this scriptures saying right here what this scripture is telling us is that when that which is perfect is come everything we understood partially all of the error that we had and what we believed would be done away with Amen we have justification by Martin Luther is that right we believe the just shall live by faith but at the opening of the seven seals when the seven thunders sounded to open up the mystery of God we only had justification as the judge so I lived my faith but that was a partial understanding but when the word came open we understood what true justification really was as though you never done it in the first place a man a man as though it never happened before Amen Wesley had sanctification but when the word came open the elect of God in this last day amen we understood sanctification not to be an action of holiness or what you wear or what you don't wear but sanctification is the Spirit of God as sanctified a man's heart took all sin out of his heart and spirit amen at one time where the RAM thought Pentecost was the restoration of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Spirit revealed to him it was just the restoration of gifts Amen we had partial understanding with that some made it the initial evidence some took prophecies that didn't line up with the Bible some took this some took that but when that which is perfect is come the real revelation of the message of the day and the revelation of the hours stepped on the scene now we know what true tongues look like now we know what true prophecy looks like amen if a man a woman tried to start a bunch of stuff on prophecy amen we've got a standard we got something complete that we can take it right back into the word and say this is what it's supposed to look like we don't do away with it we complete it we complete the understanding of it amen my girls are in school they started out in kindergarten just like all the rest of us did they came up through first second third grade my daughter Elizabeth she's coming up now where she's learning fractions and all kinds of things but I remember when they start her in mathematics they were started with what numbers are 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 ones a whole number and ones this and that this is an integer they would say or this is a certain type of number and they would start him on that and then they would give him a little piece of what's going to happen in the next grade well they would take that mystery and they would lay that mystery into the next part and you didn't really understood understand rather what's getting ready to take place unless you carried on to the second grade when you got to the second grade then that which was known in part was known in fool then they finished that part and then when they come to the third grade they left a little mystery at the end of the second grade and that little mystery was then made manifest in the third and then in the fourth and then in the fifth and then in the sixth and then when we come to the seventh grade if you understand my parable I meant all them little mysteries that was left undone down through those church ages then when he which was the perfect one had come to the earth to take the book of Redemption to open up them seven seals gather of all them little mysteries that was laying out there and finished him completed him so that there was no question where the bride stood in the last day hey man this is why the prophet of God said we by God's grace have the perfect interpretation of the word of this last day of the Bible he said the Bible became a new book to him why the things we didn't understand the little mysteries left over we now were completed amen it shouldn't mean to us we shouldn't have a question about to Godhead a man we shouldn't have a question about holiness there should be no questions about marriage and divorce in serpent seed in the all of these great mister water baptism there shouldn't be a question in the mind of a true message believer that follows the message of William Branham there should be no questions as to any of these mysteries of God about heaven about Hell about Redemption about the blood there should be no mystery left that we don't understand the mysteries should be finished amen about the character of Jesus Christ it just baffles my mind sometimes that people are still living under first and second pool teaching to them they don't understand the words been opened up to us so they're still they still try to look for a Pentecostal revival hey I believe in a Pentecostal revival I believe in Pentecost but I don't believe in a modern day version of that or you lay an empty hand on an empty head and call a few people to preach hello somebody I'm talking about the revelation of the word we're talking about the character of Jesus Christ that's what true Pentecost is bringing a revival into the heart of the bride of Jesus Christ to where she understands that she's not just a an outside source I'm not just a a believer living outside the graces of God I'm not just gathered into the house of the Lord are you listening to me I'm not just gathered in amen in a protracted meeting willy-nilly as we say down home I mean I'm not just gathered here for the sake but if I'm a child of God I am a joint heir with Jesus Christ I am on equal footing with our Lord Jesus there should be no questions if there's questions it's our fault not the Bible's part not the prophets fault not the messages fault it's our fault amen some time ago some men put some questions on the internet and it snagged a bunch of people you know what I say I said the problem was they didn't go to the right answer if you want to understand the answers to many of the questions about this message don't go to mr. Google he ain't got the Holy Ghost hello somebody don't go to some theologian he ain't born again if you want the answers go where the answers lie that's right here in the Bible right here's the answer to the Bible oh they said well you know brother Branham gives certain visions and certain things didn't got the pass and on and on on and the Bible said that if a prophet gives of a vision presumptuously and it doesn't come to pass don't fear him for I'm not with him I said that's not a man black brother Branham was talking about when he said that he went to go shoot the brown bear and he missed it the will of God God's part was he's gonna shoot the bear but he missed it brother Branham missed it himself the vision didn't fail brother brems the one that failed on that Amen when he's supposed to go to Africa and go to Indy at a certain time and go down then and preachers talk to him out of it it wasn't that God's Will was compromised it was that a man got out of the will of God himself hey brother a man can get out of the will of God that's why he preached to us there's two types of will permissive will and perfect will amen but all one has to do is get on a plane and hop over to Ghana or to Congo or to Uganda or somewhere like that and you can see God's will hasn't been staunch not a bit it's a continent of some of the greatest message believing people we've got in the entire world there's more concentrated in the in the continent of Africa than any way in the world why you cannot stop God's will no matter who fails or who don't fail Amen I don't care what anybody said oh they say that's reason not to follow him alright then how about you I want to see your perfect life I want to see a man at as Santa I've never not I never disobeyed God I've never missed his will oh come on you know better than that amen sometimes a man will follow his own will follow his own thoughts instead of following the will of God that's not what Moses was talking about he's talking about a prophet that just tell lies to get the people to follow him I mean it's all about a man that missed missed the will of God or made mistakes hey just give me a just give me five minutes of your time to sit down I guarantee in five minutes you'll tell me something you've done wrong give me five minutes of your time I'll tell you something I probably don't rolling down through the years Amen I won't have to think too hard either Amen come on somebody Amen I don't have to think too hard I can get see they meant it's it's it's it's human nature it's what it is now now notice in this jacob's ladder now now notice that our patients not just going back just kind of touching James one for your patients will be crowned when nothing is lacking in your Christian character I remember the Prophet uses the example of a boxcar and he said that when everything is said in that boxcar and everything's right he places a seal on the outside of that boxcar you said will be anybody that touches that until it reaches his final destination now we know that when you receive the Holy Ghost now this of this clothes don't fail this when a man or woman receives the Holy Ghost everything they have need of is already inside of them even the raptures on the inside of you it's just a matter than brother Keith of drink and grow drink and go eat and go nobody's born full-grown just look at these little young people if you don't believe it hey man these little humans running around here we call them babies we call them children what Paul say that should be no more children whenever you can't be children though I just say it goes to prove were not born full-grown but we have all of them characteristics down inside looking at some of these young babies around here a little boy their own brothers lap hey he may be a preacher he may be an architect he may be an engineer he made to be the greatest war general that ever walked human history we don't know whatever his potential is laying inside of him right now experience will mold him in shaping I mean if you had been sitting in Germany prior to the prior to war war to say he's sitting in a church house like this and there might have been 15 babies getting ready to be dedicated and that priest reach over and sprinkle a bunch of water on those little babies I mean little did he know when he was sprinkling the water on the head of Adolf Hitler that it would turn out to be one of the greatest monsters that we've ever seen in the world's history a genocide against the Jews but as a baby he might have been cute mom am I too good at him in mmm and all that kind of stuff like that but what was ever laying and that child was laying in that child when it was a baby amen I know the blood Jesus Christ protects children but there was a reason that God told Joshua go down and tell it all because he knew whatever that potential was it'd be shaped by what the environment it lived in it'd be molded by the people who raised it the people who trained it the people who taught it all hallelujah if they'd be that way on the negative side what about a child of God in heavenly places in Christ Jesus they'll be molded to live like Jesus Christ amen I don't mean to get loud but I get happy I mean I enjoy what I'm talking about amen watch this my in Rome in the second miracle brother Brendan says like this now some people has great big faith anything can happen he's making an example and he said some have faith that deep something is it takes them a little longer some have faith that deep takes a little while some have faith like a mustard seed but if it is mustard seed faith just keep believing it and to become marble faith marble faith will become grapefruit face then grapefruit faith will become mountains now this type of faith is what Paul addresses in the book of Romans is a measure of faith we've all been given a measure of faith now you notice that when brother Bentham is identifying this type of faith you could have to something certain deep and you could have a little deeper and you can have maybe deeper than that but when it comes to the foundation of faith in this statue of a perfect man it isn't one that's bigger a littler than the other we're all on the same foundation being a preacher being a housewife beaut of Factory burger being a deacon being a trustee we all start at the same foundation not some this deep and this deep and that deep it's all the same thing all the way across the board because we are all born by the faith of the Son of God it wasn't even my faith is same it was his faith Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God holiday it was hats fate that same it it was hats faith that birthed my heart I meant one day my own faith just really I couldn't believe for myself so God had to believe his word through me amen it was faith on the foundation of faith I want you to notice this that when a person is born on this foundation of faith remember this is the nature of God being born into that person faith is like a sea and everything that's going to be in that seat is already in it every bit of virtue every bit of knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness God is all then things are already on the inside of me so then like Psalm 1 blessed is he this like a tree planted by the rivers of living water so as he's positionally placed in Christ Jesus that's his position he may not realize what he's going to bring forth but he's positionally placed in Christ Jesus brother M said your part to play was already determined in God before the world ever began if I'm gonna be a preacher I was a preacher before I was a baby if I'm gonna be a housewife I was a housewife before I took the breath of life why was God made me that way before the world began I was positionally placed in Christ Jesus then it's a matter of what does that little seed does he draws in from the minerals draws in from the nutrients he draws in from the water he draws in from the sunlight and then after a little while you stick up out of the ground what is that that's the first shoe to virtue he's adding to his faith and as he adds to his faith comes virtue and then after a while it'll Blanche Branch goes off the side what's he done he's adding or he's adding temperance amen or he's adding knowledge rather he adds a little knowledge to his virtue a little fur virtue to his faith and all the sudden on the branch goes fruit what's it doing he's adding a little temperance to his wound to his knowledge a man then another one goes what is that that's patience then brotherly kindness then godliness regardless and brotherly kindness he goes all the way up Jacob's Ladder now you'll notice when Jacob sees this ladder he said it is the gate to heaven and it is the house of the Lord our challenges sometimes just to get you a good look at this in the book of Ephesians and who he called the house of God you are the house of God the body of Christ and members in particular where is God's presence where is God's character where is God's life where's God's assets wise God contained an today and yeah the bride of Jesus Christ house is the power and deity of Almighty God she is his house but it's also the gate to heaven amen as you walk in through the faith gate remember in a water way as the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ he said that's a strait not STR iai ght like straight through but SCR AIT which is a waterway amen that's the gate that's the reason God that the Lord Jesus had to give the keys to Peter because the gate was closed to mankind remember he slammed the gate shut in the Garden of Eden and set up set a flaming sword at that gate and said no man could come and partake of the Tree of Life the gate was locked the gate was shut and a flaming sword set before it but hallelujah when Peter got them keys on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came down to humanity he took that gate to heaven that key and slammed it into the gate swung the gate of it and said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen the gate was slammed he said was guarded by holy fire he said that's the reason some people can't get in there because they're afraid of holy fire you can't be afraid of fire amen he that's afraid of the Holy Ghost and fire remember he is the Holy Ghost and fire he that's afraid of holy fire will never get inside that gate but he that loves holy fire will probably make it amen at the righteous scarcely be savor the sinners in the ungodly appear Oh hallelujah somebody I talked about the gate to heaven Jacob's Ladder once he gets inside the gate it is the gate to heaven but it is the house of God haha I mean once he steps in the house then he starts climbing up Jacob's Ladder and who is at the top of the ladder the Lord Himself of course hey amen look at this you come all the way through faith virtue knowledge temperance patience got this brotherly kindness but when you come to the capstone which is the perfect part remember the capstone is a perfect stone within itself and everything underneath it has to be setting in perfect orders got to be honed just right that's the reason you need to come Church because when you come to church preachers wield a sharp two-edged sword and if you got rough edges something that would keep the capstone from setting down on you you come get cut on that's reason you come to church amen some of us that I come to church so that I could just come to church you cousin Church get cut on I want somebody not know not nice cut on I'm done just cut ain't being a nice ain't mean cut on hey if he's got to yell at me I wanted me yeah that's what it takes get these rough edges that ya gotta be if you got to I want to be right with God Amen because when that capstone goes to set down if everything just isn't exactly honed he can't sit now I'm perfectly like that and this is the reason why Peter said he that forgets these things he's blind he can't really even see what the character of Jesus Christ is all about he's forgotten that he was a saved man but he never continued on that God's character could be lived lived right through his life seat now watch coming to the capstone of it now watch some people we know the Prophet tells us in the blasphemous names possess portions of these virtues NaturallySpeaking so naturally maybe your mama was a patient woman you might be patient too at your patience and Mama's patience but that's not God's patience because Mama's patience can't last as long as God's patience can that is patience can handle it the trials and there and the heat of waiting on a promise of God to be fulfilled like God's patience can't Oh God Lord I need a little bit more of your patience in my life amen that your word when it can become fulfilled it may take 25 years to see the thing come to pass but God I leave a little bit more of that in my life even so how do I get it as I drink I grow as I drink I push as I drink out comes the manifestation amen how do I get there stand a wide lead feet on the word and let the word shake me into the image of Christ amen that's why people they don't like hard preaching they're probably never gonna make the rapture see nobody wants to say Amen on that cuz nobody wants hard preaching it goes so high lady we'll see and we are come on some I don't look at me like a mule standing at a new gate is the truth that's the reason why the real Bride of Christ wants somebody to tell them the truth if they gotta cut them if they gotta send them if they got a shake I wanted it tell me the truth so I can be ready for his but everybody wants the preacher who's you know charismatic and he's nice he smiles and don't hurt nobody's feelings that's the kind of preacher people want nowadays that's politics friends that ain't preaching that ain't preaching if you'd have been sitting in Paul's service and he'd called your name Jaime Gnaeus and philetus or Harold's end to the coppersmith hey some of them people never even got recorded in the pages of the Bible but Alexander coppersmith went down in infamy because of the kind of kind of man he was to Paul come on somebody hey as a clear ayat aureus for his actions his behavior he said Alexander the coppersmith done me much evil the Lord reward him Amen nobody wants that kind of preacher and lady or SIA they want the kind they can look good on a on a camera and around the internet and everybody join in and oh oh what a great preacher and what a great lovely man used to be when we had tapes and CDs and all that stuff like that all that that was the guy you know they they wanted to get all of his tapes and CDs but now that we got to computers and we got the Internet oh my everybody wants that preacher that looks good on the camera a man he don't want somebody ugly I can't be ugly he got to be somewhat handsome and he can't spit when he talks because I don't look good on the internet come on somebody oh no we want the Joel Osteen version of the message or everything is positive we want the Hagee's of the message and the Benny Hinn's of the message but the real bride ain't looking for a hand she's looking for an ego and she's looking for somebody to take that word and she's got to be cut out cut me out let me write I mean they once somebody knows how to gesture right and her hair slicked in a certain way where everybody can see how handsome they are oh yeah you pay more ties to a handsome man than they do the ugly one mm-hm that's lady OCS age we're living in but that's not the character of Jesus Christ amen naturally they can possess certain things in Ephesians six 10 through 18 the Bible said that we're a soldier dressed up with a sword in our hand helmet on our head shoes on our feet or loins Girt a breastplate dirt all of this soldiers dressed up and Paul puts the weaponry in his hand all for offense and defense of the shield of faith but don't forget Paul has put the soldier in his armor but Peters putting character in that soldier because the soldier with a sword in his hands a dangerous man if it doesn't have character to know what to do with that word that's probably the reason God ain't give us third Pole power yet because the first time we got mad at somebody we would poof just speak them out of existence there are many red lights in the United States of America I would poof out of existence because I hate a red light when I'm in go mode I hate to stop a man there aren't many flies that I would probably speak kind of existence Moses brought him in I'd take him out cuz I hate to fly worse than anything is a cockroach with wings on it hey man I hate a bug like that I just hate a bug we've stolen last night about the toys talking about some of those missionary trips and a big tarantula this way Oh God I'd do it Lord but I'd die while I was doing it I hate a bug I hate an insect but if I had third Pole power the one me another fly ever again long as you ever lived amen come on somebody but God doesn't give us that kind of power he gives us a sword he gives us a shield he gives us a helmet but then he defects the catch or the warrior so that he knows how to use the word correctly because if you have no character you might take that sword and cut your brother's head off so God he puts character in the soldier amen amen thank God for a little touch of character amen that's right Romans chapter 8 verse 14 because the first time that Walmart lady glared at you in the wrong way she disappeared poof she's gone how to loo your third poor powertech God said I can't do that yet you got to have forgiveness you got to have love amen perfect hatred will bring upon perfect love in the bride of Jesus Christ because it would be a perfect contrast in the last day perfect hatred will produce perfect love because in an age where Jesus said that the love of many will wax cold when love is completely drained out like water draining I have a bucket with a hole in it then God is filling the devil's filling the world up with perfect hatred as love goes out and as a meant as hatred goes out and love is coming into the bride then as love goes out hatred filling the other so will be the vice versa see the bride hatred us were falling out of love laughs start flowing into the heart of it be vice versa they're losing love and being filled with hate we're losing hate being filled with love amen amen amen Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God there are the sons of God led we're up Jacob's Ladder and then we're crisis at the top he's at the top of this ladder once we ascend the ladder he's at the top of it even if we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear I hate bondage I said I hate bondage oh you say but you're a Christian yeah but I've been under bondage many times in my life some little pets in some little bit settings sin I'm just being honest come on I preaching to no Angels in here come on now some little thought some little aggravation some little attitude some little feeling toward another man or another woman amen some no humans reaction or some little something no she done me wrong he done me wrong I've been in bondage many time but I did not receive a spirit of bondage I receive a spirit of Liberty amen you did too that's why spirits of bondage we should break every one of them off our life we should never be in bondage we've been given a spirit of freedom off you like shouting I just don't know if you'll shout with me or not I mean I don't want to be nervous amen that's right watch now he said for you do not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God a man I love this together he said we are children amen there's a man then heirs of God praise the Lord and then join heirs oh don't rush it you trying to rush it I don't want you to rush it don't you understand we're not just heirs I'm not just a recipient I'm not just sitting here waiting on him to give me something I'm a joint heir which means everything that is his is mine everything that is mine is his or something wrong with your shower I want to know hallelujah Amen we're dried out I am NOT subject to him I am co-equal with him according the Bible and that's what the Bible said amen you like the Bible don't you believe the Bible that's what it said if so be we suffer with him we may also be glorified together well praise the Lord for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so where's that glory gonna be revealed at in us his word his life his substance his essence everything is is gonna be revealed through us Oh hallelujah let me just warn you I get to shaking my head we're about to have a Holy Ghost meeting hey man glory to God but I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed on us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth manifestation of the sons of God everything it's waiting upon this character to be manifested in the Bride of Christ everything is waiting for that moment for your life and my life to match up to tally up to God's Word in such a way just like a hand going up in a glove it fits just perfectly let me use the term balkanize when you vulcanized something usually a piece of rubber or something like that you put a lot of heat on it you can stick two pieces together and you you're frying long enough you know the little blowtorch something like that without burning the rubber up of course you've melted enough you can't tell where one stops and the other one begins amen that's what I believe it's gonna be the bride of Jesus Christ she said God's character would be in her so much that be God walking in your shoes you can't tell where he stops from where you begin where you begin and he stops ha ha I mean Jesus on the inside working to the outside make a difference in my life not just mine but everybody that I get around Amen vulcanized together the same spirit they wait for the manifestation of the sons of God everybody across the curtain of time is waiting for this thing to be revealed you notice here I got a little statement wrote down here something I want to relate to you about this Holy Ghost remember the prophet of God said it like this he says like a little white button Galatians 4 1 through 7 if you're writing it down he said because we were sons not going to be sons but because we were sons he sent his spirit into our heart crying Abba Father because we were sons we already were sons amen Romans 9 and for the Israelites to whom pertain of the adoption Paul was speaking to the natural part of adoption naturally speaking the laws of adoption was when a king was going to pass his sword over he found somebody that had the same character the same mind the same vision that he did and when he found a man that was just like him and character and thought anything he passed his sword but he also give him a ring the ring was used as a seal as you see they didn't put tape and lick the end of an envelope like we did whenever they sealed something they take a little wax off of a candle and they pour that wax on the edge of that envelope and they take their seal and have maybe their name or their initial or some kind of symbol or something they'd press that into that wax amen and when you got that letter you know who it come from Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God amen and that's what Jesus has done for you and I when he presses this capstone onto our life amen it will be Jesus Christ laying personal possession to every man and woman that's got these virtues inside of their life he'll seal it down amen and everything on the inside the contents on the inside will remain perfect until the day of your Redemption amen there's nobody can change it nobody can move it but he said it starts like a little white button he said it moves on the inside of your heart it starts like a little white button like this he said then Jesus grows into your mouth you don't say the things used to then he grows into your eyes you don't you don't you don't see it it was you he said it grows in your arms you don't pick up and walk and talk and after he said just a little white button he starts out like yeah amen I I told some I one day they said did you get to hold a ghost I said can you feel him kicking hallelujah it's Jesus on the inside what Paul say Christ in you is the hope of glory oh I feel like Sam they may I've got Christ's hands working to the outside making a difference the seven thunders when they revealed they revealed the very character of Jesus Christ and seven undone thunders is a very simple thing whenever the mysteries of God was going to come open he said there was a beast and the Thunder a beast and a thunder beast and the thunder beats down through the ages said but when these seven thunders opened up he said it was all them little mysteries it was left down through the ages like I said first had a little mystery going to second second kind of mr. going to third but when them seven unknown Thunder sounded amen it was Christ Himself coming with the message to complete everything Christ Himself coming he was wigged a man was seven angels or seven unknown thunders from each age each mystery came with Christ so that he could reveal him and said each angel each night came into the room a man but when he got to that seventh one it wasn't William Brennan talking to William Branham amen it was you recognizing the very word of God was eagle food amen you let that other thing you said you've been heard from Yahtzee - that's what this message yet you're hearing from what you always watch you didn't become a son on any certain day you didn't receive eternal life of the altar you always were son always had eternal life you just had to recognize one day you was one of his Amen I was in him before the foundation in the world some I said but you don't remember it that's right I had spiritual amnesia but he wiped the amnesia away glory and now I recognize how I swathe an eagle never a chicken in the barrio a man in adoption he says the church position before the foundation in the world God does labor pain he brought forth you knowing what you would do knowing what you would do that's not all the good stuff he knew the bad stuff seekers he knew how you'd smoke cigarettes and love drunk and I drink beer and all that and let the later on he knew all that stuff that's the reason there was a lamb slain before the foundation or amen that way your sin would be covered when you took the breath of life there would be a covering for you in the mind of God before Eve could fall in the Garden of Eden before Adam could break the word before man could be sent out of the garden there was already sacrifice hallelujah Oh Tommy in the mind of God waiting on the elect of God Amen she's not a hitchhiker Amen she owns the car Amen you say how do you know I've got a title deed in my hand a book of redemption the Holy Ghost amen I've got the title deed he said he positionally placed you in his own body but surely God position us to be apostles and prophets and great men and great evangelists huh listen to be a housewife to be a farmer some of you Iowans were the hottest truly because when God was calling farmers in positions and farmers he was thinking of Iowans he knew some of you big farmers and some of you corn farmers and onion farmers and whatever else you get up here event he knew that there'd be a position the body of Christ you see you mean you mean God called me to be a simple farmer well sure because God wants to hide himself in simplicity and then to reveal himself out of that simplicity amen amen a great dignitary with a spire on top of the hill with a million-dollar congregation Amen that doesn't reveal Christ but a simple farmer that everybody knows it's just old Jim Bob where everybody is walking in to get some feed and his overalls but yet Christ is walking in his shoes amen and one eighteenth of the world may never he has authority I know it's crazy but this was the Bible so there's one problem you believe this is Malachi 4 well there's some what brother BAM said hey we believe he's Elijah we have to say Amen he said to be a housewife oh you mean to tell me God looks at me as a housewife he birthed you to be a housewife he gave birth the Holy Ghost filled house wife I've said it a million times let me say two million and one I believe a woman that's full of the Holy Ghost see the devil attacking her family she might be in the middle of her living room vacuum in her floor and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit move on her you've got authority over your domain I believe she can tick it to tip that vacuum cleaner up and say I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God she's got authority she's a joint she can speak what she wants to speak it ain't always nice sometimes you got to be a little rough a little bit Stern but you got to take your stand to be a preacher to be a prophet Oh hallelujah glory to God but the housewife and the farmer is just as important as a mother to officers a man he placed you positionally he gave us a new name we're no longer Methodist Baptist Presbyterian world rocker sex queen a drug addict all their names have been changed like you said I say to you they are Peter he said to James and John your bananas are his sons of thunder he said to Paul he said to Saul your name is now Paul he changed their name he said when them women were given birth in the Old Testament he said in their birth pens then women would cry out the names of those sons II from Dan and said the very prophetic word would speak through them while they was given birth and that name would positionally place him in the place they were supposed to inherit a man a man in God and his labor pains he brought forth farmer housewife prophet past Amen it positionally places our name places were supposed to be a man in the new land we are positioned in the book of Ephesians that parallels Joshua Paul position as you say we're I'm glad you asked me I'm going to tell you heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen where why we are predestinated had to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to the good pleasure of his will did you know you're not even saved by your own will oh you might have said yes but it wasn't you that started it where's the Lord oh I know I know it's mind-boggling when you think of it but you say it see you say brother B and that's that's the thing though I said yes to the Lord but who wasn't moved on you'd even think about him we got too much control over our lives friends we don't want to admit it but we got too much control over who we are I couldn't even have thought about him unless he was meditating upon me the very reason I even had a thought of him is because he was thinking to me before I was thinking of him a man his action to reaction he acted I reacted a man it's this simple amen amen hallelujah to the glory of God amen praise Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord what is adoption part 2 he said your adoptions not your birth your adoption is your placing so as a man comes up this ladder he comes up to the top of Jacob's Ladder the Lord is waiting up there to do what vest in him all of the authorities have gone st. John 1:17 when we're born again the Spirit of God we are the sons of God we are predestination now what I'm trying to get you to is these sons of the last day predestinate into adoption amen all of the blending of the natural elements that Paul spoke about there in Romans 9 for about Israelite the Israelites pertained a natural adoption all the blending of that natural blends over into the spiritual remember Jesus received the Holy Ghost at the River Jordan Rama said the fullness of God poured into Jesus at the River Jordan he was anointing him for his service he was anointing him for his work three and a half years later he took him to Transfiguration and he positioned him placed him adopt him as the mediator between God and man hey man Peter got so excited about he said let's build three denominations amen but when I go the cloud was so great by time it was over with no man could say see anything but Jesus only let me tell you something listen to me carefully don't you miss this when this work is done in our life and Jesus sets on our life there won't be nothing to see but Jesus in Jesus alone Oh hallelujah to the lamb of God amen it revealed his character thunders revealed his character the opening of the seven seals revealed his character oh I I'm half quick because I'll keep preaching but we got to quit listen do you understand that nobody in this world understands who he is like the bride that follows this message nobody understands his thoughts nobody understands his life nobody understands his nature like those that follow this last a message because that's what this message done for us this message revealed to us all of those hidden characteristics of what he was show me where all Roberts and Jack CO and him guys stood up and preached the Sevenfold personnage of Jesus Christ his eye as a flame of fire and his feet like brass and his voice of many waters amen show me one man took him and broke him down to us and showed what Jesus really is a man down to what he loved and down to what he hated and when this virtue this character's we climb up jacob's ladder come to the top of pyramid all that God was he poured in the crime all the Christ is he's pouring it into the church and then his nature is characteristic they have a ceremony when the son is being adopted st. John 14 drugs are the works that I do you're gonna do the same thing in first Timothy chapter 4 12 through 16 it said Lonette let no man despise thy youth but be an example to the believers the word he uses there for example as though a man was making a stroke or making a blow into a statute making a mark so he's leaving a mark in the lives of others but look how leaves it paul saying the same things that Peter was saying right here he said let him be an example to make a mark on believers in word conversation charity spirit faith and purity all the same virtues all the same characteristics Paul speaking like Peter speaking let that example live through your life let no man despise your youth hey man that's right amen let no man despise it let all of these things live in you verse 13 till i come give attendance to reading exhortation doctor the word attendance is to be addicted to it so Paul was telling Timothy become a Holy Ghost word fill junkie and don't never get delivered from one may feed on the word and for live for Christ and live for others become addicted to it a man when a son would come to his place of adoption the the the sword or the business or the seal all of that was handed over to him a man he could hire and he could fire a man in Psalm 1 David said he saw the tree David saw this bribed tree spoke about by the rivers of living water so it wasn't Jesus tree it was the bride tree she's being planted being planned how in Christ she's being planted in Christ the inexhaustible fountain of life to bring forth all of the fullness of who he is amen don't pass that I'm almost done I know you're overloaded but it's gonna do you so good go out of a buffet kind of fool a little bit amen right amen he said the bloom don't come out of the air he said the balloon don't come up through the ground he said where's the Apple where's the bloom where's all that at he said it's already in that see when it was planted in the ground Amen I'm not looking for virtue to fall out of heaven and hit me in the it's already in me patience is already in me everything oh it's already settle down we got two services hey I'm excited I'm gonna have to quit first Peter 2 verse 4 through 7 he tells us that we're a living stone tells us we're lively stones III don't want to quit but I got acquitted with time to go on he said we're built up a spiritual house and and and Jacob when he wakes up seeing this ladder from the earth that they have in but the rim set was anchored in Christ it's on Christ the solid rock I stand he said and then the latter was hooked to the throne of God and in souls in prison Bertram said he climbed up Jesus climbed up jacob's ladder climbed over the Father's throne and sat down on it remember Jesus isn't sitting on his own throne now he's sitting on his Father's throne in the Millennium he'll be sitting on his own throne but he's sitting on his Father's throne now but as he sits at the top of the ladder he's sitting there in the form of a pillar of fire amen that's his Father's throne the pillar of fire John sees in Revelation 4 when he looks on him like Jasper and Sauron Jasper's the first stone sauron's the last stone when they flashed together to make a yellow ambarish color John was looking at him on his Father's throne in the form of a pillar of fire it was the same image that Paul saw him on the road to Damascus Alleluia when he said he's sitting there at the top of the ladder what's he waiting for every son and daughter of God there's sin up through that ladder that characteristic I'm 7 steps our virtue until they climb all the way at the top and who's up there waiting at the top Jesus Christ waiting to approve your life because remember it always remember this never forget this it's not when you accept the Holy Ghost it's when the Holy Ghost accepts you remember said in future home 8 to 64 he said it's not when you accept him but it's when he accepts you it isn't a matter of me saying go over to god I'm gonna be saved you have no say in him it's whether he wants you to be saved or not I'm gonna get to Holy Ghost we're so arrogant we're so arrogant stuff shirted when it comes to the things of God you couldn't even say the word tick you couldn't even say the word duh unless he put it in your life to be able to even say a word and we think we're gonna control the Holy Ghost don't look at me like that praise the Lord somebody do you think we're gonna control everything hey I'm gonna get to hold a ghost you'll get it if he says you can get it he's our boss not me amen he's the one that wins over alive it's not when I accept him is when he accepts me amen and how does he accept me when my faith lines up to his word and he sees there's no doubt in me and I believe his word unequivocally and there's no doubt and I was spec it out in my heart amen he sends down the Holy Ghost to seal in that life that seal on my heart is Christ amen to my face he said is he a believer I'm a believer Lord I got him it we throw that term right I have a believer but does Jesus said you're a believer how do you know he says you're a believer how do you know he amens your word I'm a believer he sends the Holy Ghost down to seal it Amen yes he is a believer yes he is a believer it's the same thing with these virtues how do I know I'm like Jesus when he sets down upon my life and seals all of this in and says you're just like me amen let me give you one little thing we got to quit we got to quit there's two minute this is one of my favorite subjects you go for four hours on this thing one little thing after another we got to quit we got chicken food eating everything okay but whenever beater would take a piece of gold he said to have all kinds of dross and things he said he first look at the reflection of he couldn't see himself he said but he'd keep beating on that piece of gold beating on that piece of gold said eventually he'd work out all of the confusion and all of the misconceptions and all the all that kind of all the arrogance and all the temper and all the attitude and all he just keep beating on that thing said how did he know it was done when he could put it up in front of himself and see his perfect reflection I'm from Amen how do I know I've achieved that place where God's done beaten and working on me when he can see himself in my life when my faith is like his faith my virtues like his virtue knowledge temperance patience governments but the kind when all that's like him and he can see himself in me Amen he'll set the capstone down on and say this is my son amen let's stand again hey hey he's the Lord amen Romans 91 Paul said my conscience bears me witness Hebrews 11:4 faith amen faith obtained by Abel he obtained a witness God testifying of his gifts and James 5 and 3 the Bible said that their gold and rust and silver and thing or their gold and silver rather be canker to the rust shall be a witness against them for loving their treasures and things first John 5 8 through 10 he said there's three that bear witness he said you see the witness of men but the witness of God is greater on and on on you takes third John one four through six the witness of I charity before the church revelation 1:5 Jesus is the faithful witnesses one of the faithful witness rather whenever we come together and we've come to the image of Jesus Christ and we're all coming into that same image by the preaching of the word we're all being shaped and formed into the image of Christ right now around the world amen it may be dark on the other side but in the morning time that we sit in the church service there'll be some little Holy Ghost preachers spitting all over the place and ugly as a wart hog but he'll be preaching truth clover to God he'll be telling people what let's say if the Lord is and it will shape them into the image of Christ and when we all come into that one great reflection and he looks into that gold and you can see my bride is just like me she has my faith my virtue my temperance my knowledge my this my that all of them things locked into the bride of Jesus Christ then the Lord from heaven from heaven remember Jacob sees him at the top of the ladder and as the Lord Himself a meant when he sees all that then the Lord Himself shod to sin and do what he'll descend down will rise up to meet him remember his feet never touched the earth until the Millennium but will raise up to meet him why the drawing strength from heaven is pulling from heaven and we're pulling from the earth and it's like a magnet pulling us together out of the ground amen and we'll go to be with the Lord you say he's already descended that's what I'm trying to tell you amen he has descended but there's come in another
