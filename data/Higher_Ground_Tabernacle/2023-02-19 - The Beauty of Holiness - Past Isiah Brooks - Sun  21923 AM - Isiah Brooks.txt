TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Applause] but they those Apostles as John's disciples the Holy Ghost since you believe [Music] let me ask you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message do you believe this message faith is based that way Assurance that's yours faith is not based upon a myth and upon something that well that just say go do this and go do that on the words of some man Faith takes the Eternal rest and upon God's words now we believe the Bible to be God's infallible word that it is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ revealing himself in the Old Testament by the prophets god making himself known Christ Jesus Christ and in him well the fullness of the godhead bodily foreign foreign Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah is that right and then Peter was so changed like all the other disciples the only person that didn't run from the squeeze and John typed the Bride of Jesus Christ run from the squeeze from the pressure away yes sir this is coming from the message perseverance God above us Jesus Christ is God working his way into man be worshiped through man God doesn't God does nothing Junior outside of a man Hallelujah we didn't come to be another organization we are different people what we call the speckled birds and some streams yes you've got to get rich you got a spirit of jealous whatever that's of this nature here y'all hear what I'm saying when a man has an achieve a vision when he wants to achieve something he puts his whole heart into it right brother yeah that's what's going to make him successful heart into what he's doing sit down what good will it do you give Beyonce he's gonna spew you out of his mouth and if you call it was it more amen is that right he said he would that we be what on fire so y'all hear what I'm saying I'm gonna tell y'all something this is your season of Revival believe it or not and if it's not it's easy to give an account for to what God for telling you that because take advantage of this season find yourself amen amen nothing yeah it's going to stop a man when he is perseverance when he knows what he is doing and God's faith is what he's trying to achieve nothing will stop him is that right listen God Called Moses and God gave Moses nothing but his word how ridiculous the scene is everybody could have looked at him as he was crazy laughed his face and Moses stayed with the commission look at this world now refuse that little Kentucky called William Brothers know it that thing is shut down to get any better better you will become the enemy they trying to get rid of Christians Soldier oh yeah don't be so proud to refuse to call him Hallelujah Moses conquered Egypt with a stick in his hands think about the odds against that and you said there and you can't even conquer one demon remember a demon that had been tormenting you perhaps all your life because the greatest heaters in you that is in the world he's talking about the Holy House the creator of all things Hallelujah listen let me tell you something the disciples were on the disease and the storm came and Jesus was in the bottom of the city the competitive news God cares for you foreign [Applause] defeated Goliath I've even created with a slingshot no one stone you know he always puts us to the position where it looks like the odds are against us hallelujah that's what he did to the disciples but what did Jesus do because God stood up on the realm of that boat does he still living on the back you commanded this the ocean and the Sea and the waves and he said be still um had to let go y'all hear what I'm saying but what the difference was it was so connected the man Christ Jesus that's where God wants us to be it's good and we're his brethrens and God wants us to calm the storms Hallelujah Noah in a scientific age conquered the scientific age in which he lived Hallelujah Hallelujah will you be able to conquer it is it this kind of religion anymore Hallelujah I'm not saying God don't use them foreign prostituting the so-called Church of God I can't help it Hallelujah but we're trying to be pure we want to be righteous but our Holiness must come from him another man very perseverance he was born a Nazarite and the Nazarite means separated to the word what a nice thing it would be tonight if all boys listen he had Seven Locks that's it okay sir that hung down his back which was a sign that he was separated God said number Seven Locks was the type of the anointed Hallelujah is that all right faith is an anointing amen virtuous Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] as he looked it up only let your conversation be as it becoming the gospel of Christ you know what the word conversation means let your life the way you speak the way you talk about it Hallelujah as it becometh the gospel of who Christ I may hear of your Affairs that you stand fast in one spirit for the faith of the Gospel Hallelujah now you must understand one Faith one Spirit that's the only way this assembly of us receive the holy foreign that was just the beginning yeah that was the beginning nobody taught me I had to mature nobody told me that that was just the beginning they made me think that was the ultimate that's why people fall apart and if you don't teach them correctly they won't grow in the world away that's where the straight comes in the right way and you know you have a goal to achieve but what we've done just like all the other churches while we're busy fighting with doctrines can I say it like this she ain't got time to fight the Sabbath the ways of bolstering on both sides those doctrines focus on Jesus [Applause] amen the word becomes her mirror Hallelujah like I was saying at that funeral come true I'm not looking for Peter Paul or John I'm looking for me don't unless you make unless you fail a wonderful monkey to make the turn dude how many of y'all ever been there you're driving so fast you don't even see the bed and you know if you don't make that turn that caught scared like this here you know right and you realize if you had not turned you would have wrecked into something and I Prophet God kept telling us it's not a straight line it doesn't down what he has done it doesn't minimize what he's done because the word of God for this hour I don't know about you we need it let's move on let this mind be in you the secret is which was also in Christ Jesus speak in the form of God the characters you act like you can't comprehend what I'm saying God here this morning this is a serious message and if you fail to get it don't blame it y'all better hear what I'm saying don't blame me this is your day of Revival of getting it right don't do this is cleaning up time Hallelujah you can't make a Rapture because the Bible says no unclean things and that means you gotta Hallelujah [Applause] for he was God word made flesh Saint John in the beginning was the word first Saint John 1 Central in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the same yesterday and forever he was there to reveal the promises of God and watch Christ throughout all of the Old Testaments Hallelujah is that right I mean where was Moses God had prophesied Moses would come well Moses was right there and Israel had no idea who he was Hallelujah right there in Egypt on egyptica and they had no idea the only person that knew him was his mama in the media family you know what I'm saying and we find out who didn't know who he was met God on the back side identified to Moses who he was amen y'all hear what I'm saying and that's why every believer on the back side of the desert whatever that means to you Hallelujah that's okay I trust the beauty of Holiness where God dwells in where the power of the Holy Ghost is what people don't understand it's your long dresses Brothers it's not because you dress neatly I mean you got every kind of religion that dress better than we do Holiness is with you I'm gonna say it again Holiness is within and when you get it within it will reflect itself outwards I don't have to teach you certain things you know when Jesus brought true to the Pharisees Pharisees they always get mad at the word [Music] some people think we don't need that yes if you don't [Applause] the devil believes it that's right yeah but that doesn't make him right amen have faith we thank thee for those who have been called out the ones that escape in the day the people of God will be beautiful and we thank thee for the beauty of Holiness holy spirit filled people living for you by the grace that uh they are dead by your grace they they are this you do something let me let me move on I've got I'm almost done yeah because I'm gonna tell you if you don't set a goal an objective I'm gonna close on this if you don't set a goal if you're not hungry and thirsting for righteousness something's wrong you've been distracted and every Christian should have a thirst in them and this this is not a thing that you wake up to on every Sunday morning every Wednesday night you know I don't know I don't know when when there's change in a lot of you guys because I know that your church attendance will change Hallelujah the devil said well you don't have to come to church but what the devil does is this girl come to when you see that day approaching those two voices come together and what y'all do with that is come over to my house for some food we're coming together yeah we're together but that's not what he's talking about that can fall in line with that um [Applause] to give you your daily bread how many of y'all have ever thought about a certain food on Japan that food has been on your mind all day and then you come home and your wife or your mama it's cooking it all kinds of papaya even the young boy back there you know what I'm saying you know [Laughter] is somehow it makes the food taste better let God intervene for you see that's the way it works many times my wife and I have had the same food desire we want to go out we don't mind my family and she'll have fish on her mind and I have fishes no argument we don't have to toss coins I love it I watch things like that because orchestrating things in those little ways listen to this before I let in this message now we're going to have a little praise and worship afterwards whatever somebody got a testimony I I want to say something you know afterwards but I don't want to you know anyway uh don't let me forget that I need to say something but you know there is something about it if God begins to put a hunger in our human heart there is there is just nothing yeah going to stand in its way whether there is cooperation or not or whether there is anything she's got to find that it's going to happen amen you understand that like I said the Holiness of God is being robbed in his righteousness and be enrolled in his righteousness being covered by his blood and being covered by his blood is to be in Christ by the Holy Spirit you love the Lord amen we do have a baptism I'm just going to stop because I know how long-winded I could be uh just just know that the Lord is not slack concerning his promises and don't think because I'm finding a message that is no no they're criterias that must be met and that is you know you got to come from justification the same time and baptism the Holy Ghost will bring you into Christ himself and that's the word of the Scripture it won't it won't mean that you're not saying there'll be many people following this message because they failed to go on they didn't have a goal you know they didn't have nothing to achieve but those of us who who are pushing continuing let me tell you something this moment foreign you can pray sometimes and you can just go you just like travel on the Wind yeah but there are times there's something and you want to pray God I feel like God is nowhere near you if something comes to Judy and that's the time to pray that's he's trying to see whether you mature enough whether you're gonna you're gonna talk to him or you talk to him when you don't feel it Hallelujah talking to God goes beyond your senses you don't have to feel him because he hears you anyway you love the Lord let's just pray our gracious father we come before your lord and we thank you for your goodness and your grace Lord without you Jesus we're nothing else but with you we are everything you're the same yesterday today and forever and we only worship the man Christ Jesus Lord you are Lord You're the only true and living God thank you Father for all that you do we know that Christianity is not a science it's not a practice if I'm practicing how to live right now it's a nature change that nature changed I like the nature that's within us Lord

Wright asked the right thing she asked for the Salvation of her two sons and uh I was listening to a little bit more and uh brother Brown starts talking about this he says he's talking about sister Hattie Wright she was very very poor as everyone knows and one of the things that they him and um brother the the pastor of the church I forget his name we're talking about was Sister Hattie Wright was wanting to give her ties and she had fifty dollars to give her ties and the Pastor said no no you you can't give that much he said so he ended up convincing her to give twenty dollars and then brother Branham heard that she gave twenty dollars I gotta give her back but the holy spirit said something to him he says don't do it and then he said then he tied that of her giving twenty dollars in ties to receiving when she said the right thing said God blessed her God won't owe you anything he'll never owe you anything amen so with that being said Brother Sam asked me to mention that we
