[7:31] Amen. I'm happy to be in the house of
[7:34] the Lord this Wednesday
[7:37] evening. Let's stand upon our
[7:42] feet. I am thine, oh Lord.
[7:48] I ever
[7:51] heard and it
[7:53] told the love to
[7:59] me. But I long to rise in the arms of
[8:07] faith and be
[8:10] close drawn to thee.
[8:17] Draw me
[8:19] [Music]
[8:21] nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to thy
[8:26] cross where thou has died.
[8:32] [Music]
[8:33] Draw me
[8:38] nearer, nearer, blessed
[8:43] Lord to thy
[8:47] preious. Let's sing that one more time
[8:50] prayerfully.
[8:51] Oh, draw me
[8:57] nearer, nearer, blessed Lord to thy
[9:02] cross where
[9:05] thou has died.
[9:09] Oh, draw me
[9:14] nearer, nearer, blessed
[9:19] Lord to thy
[9:22] preious
[9:24] leading side. Say, consecrate me, Lord.
[9:30] Consecrate me now to thy service.
[9:37] By thy power of
[9:41] grace, Lord, let my
[9:47] soul look up with a
[9:52] steadfast hope and my will be lost in
[9:59] time.
[10:01] My Lord, draw me
[10:05] near
[10:06] [Music]
[10:07] here. Nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross
[10:14] where
[10:15] thou has
[10:17] [Music]
[10:19] died. Draw me
[10:25] nearer, dearer. Blessed
[10:30] Lord to the

[10:44] [Music]
[10:50] depross the night.
[10:54] There are heights of
[10:56] [Music]
[10:58] joy of joy that I may
[11:05] not till I
[11:07] rest in peace with thee. My Lord, draw

[43:16] Hallelujah. You take all the
[43:19] glory, all the
[43:21] honor, all the praise.
[43:25] [Applause]
[43:26] You deserve
[43:29] [Music]
[43:30] it. You deserve
[43:35] it. You deserve
[43:40] it. You deserve it.
[43:45] [Music]
[43:47] My
[43:48] hallelujah
[43:50] belongs to
[43:52] you
[43:56] Jesus. My
[43:58] hallelujah
[43:59] belongs to
[44:03] you.
[44:08] Amen. Amen. We praise the Lord for his
[44:11] grace. Amen. To everybody have every
[44:23] We thank God for all that you all of you
[44:26] have come out.
[44:50] England
[45:03] singed by the blood.
[45:06] It's going on time and it's full of the
[45:10] Holy
[45:11] Ghost. It's going on time and the
[45:15] brightest rapturing fone.
[45:26] When I get to heaven, going to sing and
[45:28] shout. There'll be nobody to pull me
[45:31] out. When I get to heaven, going to tell
[45:34] the news how he brought me through. How
[45:37] he brought me through. And I'm so glad
[45:42] that
[45:45] it only siberty.
[45:56] Don't worry about
[45:59] the normally they
[46:02] don't. We want you to come introduce
[46:05] your wife and
[46:28] Praise the Lord. I
[46:35] always try to imagine what's going on in
[46:38] your mind.
[46:51] That's right. And I'm glad to be
[46:54] here because I saw a couple of short
[46:57] people as
[47:04] well. So, I'm in good
[47:08] company. So glad to be here.
[47:13] We were raised on our pastor's music
[47:18] and right now I feel very intimidated to
[47:21] be the school pit.
[47:25] He's a man we rever in this
[47:29] message and I bring greetings from my
[47:32] home church in
[47:35] England where by the grace of God we
[47:38] shall do what it takes to have him come
[47:40] over and bless us as
[47:45] well. Amen. I'd like to also greet my
[47:50] wife lovely wife.
[47:56] She goes by the name Sister Florence.
[47:58] Sister Florence. Praise the Lord. I like
[48:00] to call her sister,
[48:03] but I go by how the toddlers in our
[48:05] church call
[48:08] her. They always say
[48:11] sister got used
[48:17] to. She stole my heart many years ago
[48:20] and never gave it back.
[48:24] And I don't want it back
[48:34] either.
[48:37] Praise the
[48:44] Lord. First and foremost, I would like
[48:47] to say to our
[48:51] pastor, a man of his nature, it takes
[48:54] great humility to give me the platform
[48:56] of this
[49:02] church. I do not take this for granted.
[49:06] God will bless you, sir.
[49:08] Praise the Lord. Let's get into the
[49:11] scriptures.
[49:32] Amen.
[50:03] I will read up to verse
[50:06] three. It says
[50:08] Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and the
[50:12] brother of
[50:13] James. To them that are sanctified by
[50:16] God the Father Jesus Christ.
[50:22] Mercy unto you and peace and love of
[50:35] light. I would like to also extend the
[50:38] same salutation to you as
[50:42] well. And he goes on to say, "Beloved,
[50:46] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[50:48] you of the common salvation, it was for
[50:52] me to write unto you and exalt you that
[50:54] you should earnestly contend for the
[50:57] faith which was once delivered unto the
[50:59] saints.
[51:10] the Lord and blessings to the reading of
[51:12] his
[51:14] word. Shall we
[51:16] pray? Our heavenly father, we thank you
[51:20] for this opportunity to be in the house
[51:22] of the
[51:24] Lord. We do not take this for granted.
[51:28] Lord, for we realize there's so many
[51:30] hospitals and places that people would
[51:32] rather not be, but somehow they are
[51:34] there.
[51:38] But yet David when you were given the
[51:40] opportunity to come into your
[51:43] presence he said I was glad when they
[51:45] said unto me let us go to the house of
[51:47] the
[51:48] [Music]
[51:49] Lord. Father it gladdens our heart to be
[51:52] here
[51:55] tonight. We pray for a special
[51:58] anointing upon your word and in our
[52:01] hearts.
[52:03] Let us all together be in one place.
[52:08] so that you can have the preeminence.
[52:11] We love you. We appreciate you. Father,
[52:15] I speak a special blessing upon our
[52:16] elder brother
[52:18] books who has stood the test of time and
[52:21] still loves the Lord
[52:24] as received this message just an hour
[52:27] ago, hasn't lost his enthusiasm and his
[52:32] zeal. May you continue to bless our
[52:34] elder
[52:36] bless the congregation as
[52:38] well. For indeed, Lord, our hallelujah
[52:41] only belongs to you. Hallelujah. Give
[52:44] you all the praise, the glory, the
[52:46] honor.
[52:48] In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[52:51] pray. Amen. And amen. Amen. Praise the
[52:55] Lord. Okay.
[53:07] Praise the Lord. I mean, he's happy to
[53:09] be in the house of the
[53:11] Lord. Amen.
[53:14] I would like to introduce myself from
[53:17] the perspective of
[53:19] Jude in his pistol. He says, "The things
[53:22] that I've come to tell
[53:25] you are commonly believed among us."
[53:30] In other words, I'm not coming with
[53:32] anything
[53:34] new, but it's stuff that I've given due
[53:36] diligence
[53:40] and I want to write unto you of the
[53:42] common
[53:45] salvation. I came out with one
[53:48] conclusion. I would like to exhort
[53:52] you to earnestly contend for the faith
[53:55] that was once
[53:57] delivered because it is that rapturing
[54:01] faith that gets us to why we are in the
[54:03] message.
[54:07] The moment we miss
[54:08] that so many waters have come across
[54:11] this
[54:13] earth, so many
[54:15] doctrines. But the principal thing that
[54:18] brought us into the
[54:20] message is the prospect of the
[54:23] rapture. So it's things that we commonly
[54:28] believe. So allow me for a title to
[54:31] preach about precision shooting.
[54:37] through perfect
[54:40] understanding. Why precision shooting
[54:42] through perfect
[54:44] understanding? Because Jude
[54:46] says, "I have diligently sought to seek
[54:50] these
[54:52] things and I can honestly tell
[54:55] you, let's contend for the faith that
[54:58] was once
[55:02] delivered." Amen. Amen. Allow me to read
[55:05] Actsapter one verse number
[55:10] one. It says, "The former treaties have
[55:13] I made or
[55:14] Theophilus of all that Jesus began both
[55:18] to do and to
[55:25] teach." Amen. Amen. Then let's go again
[55:28] to the next scripture which is Luke
[55:31] chapter one.
[55:34] vers
[55:36] 1-4. For as many have taken in hand to
[55:39] set forth in order a declaration of
[55:42] those things which are most surely
[55:45] delivered among
[55:46] [Music]
[55:49] us. Even as they delivered the man to us
[55:53] which from the beginning were
[55:55] eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.
[55:58] It seemed good to me also, having had
[56:02] perfect understanding of all things,
[56:05] from the very first to write unto you,
[56:08] to write unto thee in order, most
[56:11] excellent Theophilus, that um that thou
[56:14] mightest know the certainty of these
[56:17] things which thou hast been instructed.
[56:39] as I've already given my title.
[56:43] You will notice that I've used Acts and
[56:47] Luke. And in those two scriptures, they
[56:50] are speaking of the things that have
[56:51] already been established. And it's a
[56:55] epistol like the epistol of
[56:59] Jude. And Jude writes in his own way to
[57:02] say, I have now considered all things,
[57:05] and I want to write unto you of the
[57:06] common salvation to earnestly contend
[57:09] for the faith that was once delivered.
[57:17] And now we have
[57:19] Luke. Luke was a
[57:23] gentile. And according to we who've been
[57:26] in this message for a longer
[57:29] time and our pastor for the longest
[57:33] time, we can establish that there are
[57:35] the four beasts that guard the throne of
[57:39] God which are the four
[57:42] gospels. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
[57:45] Luke. Now Luke represents the gentile
[57:49] bride. Luke
[57:52] because Luke was writing from the
[57:55] perspective of the person that led him
[57:57] to Christ who was
[58:03] Paul. So Luke did not just write the
[58:06] book of Luke, he also wrote the book of
[58:12] Acts. And as he wrote the book of Acts,
[58:15] he starts with one common character.
[58:21] And that common character start with
[58:23] it's a gentleman called Theophilus.
[58:29] And Theophilus is addressed in Acts
[58:32] chapter one and Luke chapter
[58:35] one. Now what is very outstanding about
[58:38] the address of this
[58:42] gentleman is that he is referred to and
[58:45] said most excellent Theophilas.
[58:51] That caught my attention that how can a
[58:53] man be called most excellent Theophilus
[58:56] before the stage of a perfect man was
[58:58] ever
[59:04] preached. And for a gospel to start with
[59:07] addressing him
[59:11] twice and in those times referring to
[59:15] him as an important figure.
[59:20] An inquisitive mind wants to go to the
[59:23] history to find out who Theophilus
[59:27] was and why did he enter into our Bibles
[59:30] as a most
[59:34] excellent. So upon my little
[59:38] research, as I was trying to get to know
[59:42] him, I did not find any conclusive
[59:46] evidence of who this man
[59:50] was. I said, "Okay, let me go to how the
[59:54] original was written for Theophilus.
[59:56] Maybe there is a hidden mystery in his
[59:58] name."
[1:00:04] And then I found out that there is only
[1:00:06] a
[1:00:08] supposition and theophilus by name means
[1:00:11] a friend of
[1:00:14] God. And the only definition that could
[1:00:17] come up was it says was a person Luke
[1:00:20] addressed in the gospel and the book of
[1:00:23] Acts 2.
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:30] One would have made a clever imagination
[1:00:32] if they thought that this man warranted
[1:00:35] more information being that is addressed
[1:00:37] in two or very important books of the
[1:00:40] Bible.
[1:00:45] What do you mean, brother Crosby?
[1:00:46] Perhaps maybe they should have taken uh
[1:00:49] a little biography of L of of Theophilus
[1:00:52] and say Theophilus was met by uh uh Paul
[1:00:56] or Luke as he was coming out of prison
[1:00:59] or something to make us know that he was
[1:01:01] a character that existed existed for him
[1:01:04] to be warranted the title most
[1:01:14] excellent. But all we are left with is
[1:01:17] that he was a man of high rank. He was
[1:01:19] probably he was a general of high rank
[1:01:21] and consideration and who came under the
[1:01:23] influence of Luke or Paul adome and
[1:01:26] converted to the Christian
[1:01:35] faith. The word that throws me off of
[1:01:37] his personality is the word probably.
[1:01:43] It means there is no certainty to who he
[1:01:45] really
[1:01:47] was. So I chose to make myself
[1:01:50] Theophilus.
[1:01:53] You can choose to make yourself
[1:01:54] Theophilus.
[1:01:57] Because by definition is called a friend
[1:01:59] of God. And if you are a friend of God,
[1:02:02] you can qualify yourself to say I too am
[1:02:05] Theophilas.
[1:02:08] I understand America has ways of giving
[1:02:10] names to people who are
[1:02:13] nameless. For example, if you find a
[1:02:15] corpse that's lying in the street, you
[1:02:16] call them Jane Doe or John Doe. And I'm
[1:02:20] here to tell you, brothers and sisters,
[1:02:22] that I read myself in Theophilus because
[1:02:25] Theophilas is written in the book of
[1:02:27] Acts. And I'm told by my prophet that
[1:02:30] another book of Acts has got to be
[1:02:31] written. And the book is addressing
[1:02:34] someone. And I believe I'm being
[1:02:36] addressed by this book. It's saying all
[1:02:39] theophilas. In other words, brothers and
[1:02:41] sisters, before God can ever write
[1:02:44] anything to anyone, he must specify to
[1:02:46] who he's writing to. And I believe the
[1:02:49] book of Acts is for the friends of God.
[1:02:52] If you're a friend of God, you ought to
[1:02:54] say amen. Tonight, the book of Acts,
[1:02:57] brothers and sisters, speaks about a
[1:02:59] character not known, but only addressed
[1:03:01] as a friend of God. And the last I
[1:03:04] checked in my Bible, there was a man
[1:03:06] called Abraham. He too was called a
[1:03:09] friend of God. And if you're Abraham
[1:03:12] seed, you too can be called a friend of
[1:03:14] God. Believe us thou this. Believe us
[1:03:17] thou this. Now we can also speak and say
[1:03:20] no wonder he said most excellent because
[1:03:24] we are the only generation that knows
[1:03:27] perfection through the stage of a
[1:03:29] perfect man. He had to take William
[1:03:31] brother to come and lay the caption and
[1:03:34] tell us who we are. Brother, I don't
[1:03:37] know what to read in that Bible, but I
[1:03:39] can read myself in the address of
[1:03:42] Theopilas. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:03:45] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Give
[1:03:47] God some praise in here. Or it feels
[1:03:50] like a convention already. It feels like
[1:03:52] a Sunday service. You know, look like
[1:03:55] there is an anointing in this place. I
[1:03:57] don't know whether it's the seat I sat
[1:03:59] in there, but I can tell you brothers
[1:04:01] and sisters, I feel so at home because
[1:04:05] my church chairs are exactly this color.
[1:04:09] Your pastor's uh bed sign is the same
[1:04:12] bedside with me. So when I got into his
[1:04:15] office, I started to see a few peculiar
[1:04:17] things. Something in me felt like I've
[1:04:20] been here before. So I began to ask him,
[1:04:23] "Pastor, what is your date of birth?"
[1:04:25] And he said the 31st of January. I said,
[1:04:28] "Aha, I see you. You are an Aquarian."
[1:04:31] Because I'm an Aquarian. So I feel right
[1:04:34] in place right here. Somebody say amen
[1:04:36] to that.
[1:04:38] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Do you
[1:04:41] see brothers and sisters that now we are
[1:04:44] in the age of perfection? We are in the
[1:04:47] age of excellence. That's why I said my
[1:04:50] title is precision shooting through
[1:04:54] perfect understanding because only
[1:04:58] theophilus addressed and told now we
[1:05:01] have perfect
[1:05:03] understanding of the things that Jesus
[1:05:06] began both to
[1:05:08] do and we are perfect witnesses to that.
[1:05:13] to understand brothers and sisters only
[1:05:15] we who are post brother can be perfect
[1:05:19] witnesses to the power that was shown in
[1:05:22] the ministry of William Brana. We can
[1:05:24] also say based on faith is a substance
[1:05:29] from
[1:05:30] 1947 praise the Lord to the rapture to
[1:05:33] to to the communion in 1965. You have
[1:05:37] perfect
[1:05:38] understanding how these things will
[1:05:41] be around the message with the correct
[1:05:44] spirit. You have perfect
[1:05:47] understanding the mind of God. Somebody
[1:05:50] say amen to that.
[1:05:54] So my title is precision
[1:05:56] shooting through perfect understanding.
[1:06:00] Brother's message does not
[1:06:03] need editing and
[1:06:05] editing as perfect as it is. Somebody
[1:06:08] say amen to that. If you want to correct
[1:06:11] the prophet, you must have a higher
[1:06:14] experience than him. If all your dreams
[1:06:17] were
[1:06:18] false, you correct a prophet who had a
[1:06:22] Bible study with the angel of the Lord
[1:06:25] by his side. Praise the Lord. Most of
[1:06:27] the time you have a Bible study, you
[1:06:30] miss fire. How much more brothers and
[1:06:33] sisters we ought to give the proper
[1:06:35] kudos to our
[1:06:37] prophets. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:06:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. So it's called
[1:06:44] precision shooting through perfect
[1:06:47] understanding. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:50] Allow me brothers and sisters to give
[1:06:53] just evidence that if Abraham according
[1:06:55] to James
[1:06:57] 2:21-24 is referred to as a friend of
[1:07:00] God, every seed of Abraham can also be
[1:07:03] referred to as a friend of God. Says,
[1:07:06] "Was Lord Abraham our father justified
[1:07:08] by works when he had offered Isaac his
[1:07:11] son upon the altar? Seeest thou how
[1:07:13] faith wrought with his works, and by
[1:07:16] works was faith made.
[1:07:22] Somebody say amen to that. Faith was
[1:07:24] made
[1:07:25] what? Comes a time in the life of a
[1:07:29] believer that has got to be made
[1:07:31] perfect. You might have started not so
[1:07:34] sure about how things are
[1:07:36] done by the teaching and teaching under
[1:07:39] the ministry of William Br. You begin to
[1:07:42] talk about perfect faith. If only
[1:07:44] William Brana could preach about perfect
[1:07:46] faith because perfect faith
[1:07:53] It exists.
[1:07:55] You can have perfect faith.
[1:07:58] Somebody say amen to that. Faith without
[1:08:01] wanting.
[1:08:02] Faith without but but
[1:08:05] but without because we can have perfect
[1:08:08] faith under the message of
[1:08:11] our scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:08:15] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:08:18] unto him for righteousness and he was
[1:08:21] also called theophilas.
[1:08:26] Do I have any friends of God
[1:08:29] here? Abraham
[1:08:33] seed on your faith. You told God.
[1:08:38] Somebody say amen to that. Believe thou
[1:08:42] this. Believest thou this. Believest
[1:08:45] thou this. Allow me to read a quote.
[1:08:49] Praise the Lord. Brother in the message.
[1:08:52] believers. Now, this it says, "But if
[1:08:55] the vine put forth the first branch, an
[1:08:58] arrow, that branch wrote a book of Acts,
[1:09:02] and the book of Acts addressed
[1:09:05] who is right. The second branch will
[1:09:10] will make another book of
[1:09:13] X. The third
[1:09:16] branch, the second
[1:09:19] branch was in the realm of William
[1:09:21] Brana.
[1:09:22] There could be a third
[1:09:25] branch branch like another book of
[1:09:29] acts. The branch that comes out of that
[1:09:32] vine is the same as the first
[1:09:35] branch. If we will have the same, we
[1:09:38] will have the
[1:09:40] same conditions. We meet the same
[1:09:44] conditions. Somebody say amen to Christ.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. Do you see it, brothers and
[1:09:51] sisters?
[1:09:52] If we have to go by the character of
[1:09:54] producing another book of acts, it means
[1:09:57] that there's got to be set to have
[1:10:02] theophilas friends of God. And when you
[1:10:05] have friends of God, then you have the
[1:10:08] friends of God being addressed to
[1:10:11] produce
[1:10:13] another. So can I address you tonight?
[1:10:17] Oh friends of God, somebody say amen to
[1:10:20] that.
[1:10:23] Amen. Because you cannot expect
[1:10:26] to have another book of acts without the
[1:10:29] same conditions of the first book of
[1:10:30] acts in the first book of acts of the
[1:10:34] most excellent theophilus. In other
[1:10:37] words, the word of God in this end time
[1:10:41] is capable of producing
[1:10:43] excellence for the believers of God.
[1:10:45] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:10:50] Now you can graft.
[1:10:54] We know that. I've seen a citrus tree
[1:10:56] with about different kinds
[1:11:00] of I've seen an orange tree putting
[1:11:03] forth grapefruits and lemons and
[1:11:06] everything
[1:11:07] else on it. They were grafted in. That's
[1:11:12] what the matter it is today. But the
[1:11:14] Holy Ghost does not behave in another
[1:11:18] and misbehave in another. The Holy Ghost
[1:11:21] is a consistent spirit because it's the
[1:11:23] spirit of the almighty God dwelling in a
[1:11:27] human being. So if the Holy Ghost
[1:11:30] produced excellent
[1:11:31] theophilas to produce an excellent
[1:11:34] theophilas in this generation as
[1:11:41] well. We've draft drafted in our
[1:11:45] ideas, drafted in our
[1:11:48] denominations. If that tree ever puts
[1:11:50] forth another fruit,
[1:11:55] vine itself, not a man-made one
[1:12:00] itself. It will be like the original
[1:12:04] one. And my prophet says, hallelujah.
[1:12:07] Hallelujah. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:12:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All church will
[1:12:13] blend together.
[1:12:15] We
[1:12:16] need the power
[1:12:19] of the original original. Hallelujah.
[1:12:22] Hallelujah. Is the sermon
[1:12:24] tonight. We
[1:12:26] need the power of the original. The
[1:12:30] original power produce the most
[1:12:33] excellent
[1:12:36] Theophilus. God will produce excellent
[1:12:38] Theopilas.
[1:12:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we don't have
[1:12:46] the message according to our
[1:12:49] cultures. The message
[1:12:51] according to what the original power
[1:12:54] is. Somebody say amen to that. This
[1:12:58] message ain't
[1:13:00] Zimbabwean. Message ain't
[1:13:02] American. This message ain't
[1:13:04] Congol. This message ain't French. This
[1:13:08] message is supernatural.
[1:13:10] Somebody say amen. And because it's
[1:13:13] supernatural, we test it by its
[1:13:16] production. Supernatural. Somebody say
[1:13:19] amen. Somebody say glory. Somebody say
[1:13:23] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody say
[1:13:26] glory. The original life will produce
[1:13:29] the original power. The original power
[1:13:32] will produce the original
[1:13:34] life. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:39] And the prophet in the
[1:13:42] message one time I sent a little model
[1:13:47] 70 model 75 back to the Winchester
[1:13:53] company. One day
[1:13:56] I couldn't make it hit over about three
[1:13:59] or 3/4 of an inch or 50 yards.
[1:14:07] And Winchester company sent it back to
[1:14:09] me and said, "Reverend
[1:14:13] Brham, the gun is only made to group a
[1:14:19] five short group an inch and 25 yards."
[1:14:23] Now, that was the company that made
[1:14:27] it. I know different. Did you just say I
[1:14:31] just drove on the line precision nine
[1:14:36] straight carpet tucks at 50
[1:14:39] yards. The spec of the Winchester
[1:14:42] company said as far as we're
[1:14:45] concerned this gun goes only for 25
[1:14:51] yards. The offers thought
[1:14:54] otherwise. The offer said, "I know I can
[1:14:58] do it
[1:14:59] better.
[1:15:02] original. God allow our prophet to have
[1:15:06] this enthusiasm about these
[1:15:10] guns have more than the
[1:15:15] specification to produce excellent
[1:15:23] theophilas shoot
[1:15:28] precision nine straight bullets in one
[1:15:32] hole.
[1:15:33] Do you know what that
[1:15:35] means? It means brothers and
[1:15:38] sisters. He put a tag there. and nine
[1:15:43] times.
[1:15:45] Do you realize that just just mis
[1:15:47] misplacing a breath can get you off
[1:15:49] target?
[1:15:51] But he shot nine times in one hole until
[1:15:57] those that were with him were saying, "I
[1:16:00] believe you are missing." Because there
[1:16:02] was no evidence around the tag. Then
[1:16:05] they put a paper behind it. Then they
[1:16:08] saw a hole through the paper. Then they
[1:16:10] realize it ain't missing. This message
[1:16:14] my brother cannot miss. Somebody say
[1:16:17] amen. Amen.
[1:16:21] Amen. God had to come in brother's
[1:16:24] recreation just to show
[1:16:27] just to
[1:16:29] preach scriptures
[1:16:31] through his life. Amen. So I drove on
[1:16:35] the line precision nine straight carpet
[1:16:38] tax at 50 yards.
[1:16:41] 50 yards is twice the manufacturer
[1:16:48] specification says. So I know it was
[1:16:52] zeroed
[1:16:53] in so I just kept fooling with it with
[1:16:57] it. got it driving back again.
[1:17:04] Now the same thing is by the word of
[1:17:07] God.
[1:17:11] Those apostles did those things that
[1:17:14] Christ
[1:17:17] promised zeroed with the
[1:17:21] word. If it did it one
[1:17:24] time, he will do it again.
[1:17:28] because it's God and God is his word and
[1:17:32] his word can't fail.
[1:17:35] Oh brother, if you've ever had a
[1:17:38] testimony of the power of God, if God
[1:17:41] ever did the supernatural, he can do it
[1:17:44] again and he will do it again. Why?
[1:17:48] Because he is supernatural.
[1:17:51] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:17:53] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It
[1:17:57] can't fail. You know when you read your
[1:18:00] Bible and you hear Luke writing and
[1:18:04] saying excellent Theophilus. Do you know
[1:18:07] what it means to be called
[1:18:09] excellent above
[1:18:12] me to excel to the to the highest rank.
[1:18:16] There is no need in your life. There is
[1:18:19] no failure in your life. The most
[1:18:22] excellent message believer. Somebody say
[1:18:25] amen right there.
[1:18:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:32] Says in some static a gun be a little
[1:18:36] too loose this
[1:18:39] way in the forearm a little loose or too
[1:18:42] tight and that that binds it. You can
[1:18:47] put the weight of the hammer on a rifle
[1:18:49] and it it's shooting perfect and the
[1:18:52] weight of your finger will throw it
[1:18:56] off. Everything perfect.
[1:19:03] Now, why would God allow the prophet to
[1:19:07] play this drama with the gun?
[1:19:12] It was a type of the power of the spoken
[1:19:14] word because it
[1:19:16] itself we have a
[1:19:19] gun. The spoken word is what helps us
[1:19:23] zero in so that there's no way God will
[1:19:26] give us a
[1:19:27] zero which really makes us have crooked
[1:19:30] shorts.
[1:19:32] You can never go wrong with the message
[1:19:33] of God.
[1:19:40] That's the way you have to do with
[1:19:44] Christianity to make the
[1:19:47] word make it manifest and act
[1:19:54] right. I thought he's telling us about
[1:19:56] his activity with the Winchester rifle.
[1:20:03] He brings it back to the
[1:20:05] word and then now he brings it back to
[1:20:08] us and then he says yourself
[1:20:12] with the word of God it's got to be
[1:20:15] perfect then it will
[1:20:17] zero got to
[1:20:19] be so therefore in
[1:20:23] preaching you got to feel the spirit
[1:20:28] right where it will all it will drive
[1:20:31] the target. I don't know who I've come
[1:20:33] to preach to but I feel like I where I
[1:20:36] can go. Whatever is your
[1:20:39] problem you if God ever worked in your
[1:20:42] life before he can do it
[1:20:47] again. If you ever saw the supernatural
[1:20:50] hand of God, there's no reason for you
[1:20:53] to doubt. You can see it again. Somebody
[1:20:56] say amen.
[1:20:58] Someone say glory.
[1:21:05] That's why my title is precision
[1:21:08] shooting
[1:21:10] through
[1:21:12] perfect
[1:21:13] understanding. We now
[1:21:16] know that you cannot be a sister in
[1:21:20] flex. Our
[1:21:23] understanding that don't
[1:21:25] work. Praise the Lord. You cannot be a
[1:21:28] sister in charge of your
[1:21:30] husband. Our perfect understanding tells
[1:21:32] us that don't work. Somebody say amen to
[1:21:36] that. You cannot be a son who rules the
[1:21:39] father. Our perfect understanding shows
[1:21:42] that it cannot be. We must zero in with
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:48] words. I
[1:21:50] shoot precision
[1:21:53] shooting and I had many trophies.
[1:21:57] And the other day, the Lord knowing my
[1:22:00] heart, knowing I need a little rest,
[1:22:04] let me shoot a remarkable thing with a
[1:22:07] common model 70 Winchester. 222 rifle on
[1:22:11] the range. I shot nine bullets in the
[1:22:14] same wall.
[1:22:18] Two of the group of men standing there
[1:22:22] with the P
[1:22:23] behind said I believe you are missing
[1:22:25] the
[1:22:26] target. What was
[1:22:28] it? Messed with the
[1:22:31] gun with everything till every little
[1:22:36] vibration to be
[1:22:39] right. This is the target something
[1:22:42] wrong somewhere.
[1:22:45] That's why believers don't want to
[1:22:47] tinker their lives. If the pastor says,
[1:22:49] "Let's tinker our lives." You say, "I
[1:22:52] don't like him. I'll go find another
[1:22:53] pastor." You will never hit the target
[1:22:56] like that. You've got to tinker your
[1:22:59] life to make it hit the target all the
[1:23:04] time.
[1:23:07] Hallelujah. The Winchester company said
[1:23:10] that gun will only shoot an inch group
[1:23:12] at 25 yards.
[1:23:18] And I had nine bullets in the same hole
[1:23:21] at 50
[1:23:25] yards. No matter what they
[1:23:28] say, it had worked
[1:23:31] before it work
[1:23:33] again. I don't care.
[1:23:36] goes out of the
[1:23:39] message who says it don't work. I think
[1:23:43] it in my personal
[1:23:45] life it
[1:23:50] works. That's the way it is
[1:23:53] today. They say you can't have
[1:23:56] Pentecost
[1:23:59] then as long as we have
[1:24:03] the Pentecost. Somebody say amen.
[1:24:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:12] Says people don't believe that stuff.
[1:24:15] You can do it. We got to have church. We
[1:24:19] got to have the
[1:24:21] organization. We got to have the
[1:24:22] education injected into it and so forth.
[1:24:26] If it work back there to the illiterate
[1:24:29] fisherman, he could take God and
[1:24:31] respect. If it hit the target
[1:24:34] then, if it healed the
[1:24:37] sick, if it healed, if it raised the
[1:24:40] dead, it will do the same today.
[1:24:43] Somebody say,
[1:24:44] "Amen." Cancer or not cancer, my prophet
[1:24:48] told me that's a tooth ache. Somebody
[1:24:51] say, "Amen."
[1:24:54] Believers know this.
[1:25:00] If it worked to the illiterate,
[1:25:04] it can work.
[1:25:07] Says the right
[1:25:09] vibration. Put on the
[1:25:13] gun. If it don't, go back and check up
[1:25:17] your
[1:25:18] gun. Go back. Pick up the
[1:25:23] prescription. find out where it's
[1:25:26] wrong. The only way I know it to
[1:25:31] do it because it hit it
[1:25:35] before it hit
[1:25:37] again. It worked for the apostles
[1:25:40] without
[1:25:41] denomination,
[1:25:44] without
[1:25:45] Methodists, without Baptist, without
[1:25:49] Presbyterians or what more. worked for
[1:25:52] them on the word of God. It worked for
[1:25:56] me on the word of God. It worked for you
[1:26:00] on the word of God. You But you've got
[1:26:03] to find out where your loose screws
[1:26:08] is. Sister, if your loose screws is
[1:26:12] gossip, tighten up.
[1:26:15] Brother, if your loose screws is
[1:26:17] lost, tighten up. Find out where the
[1:26:21] loose screws are. It will hit the target
[1:26:23] all the
[1:26:27] time. But you've got to find out where
[1:26:29] your loose screws
[1:26:31] is. Sometimes you got to excuse me. Got
[1:26:36] plenty of them. Some of them even get so
[1:26:40] tight. You got to loosen it up, brother.
[1:26:44] You can be so tight screwed that you are
[1:26:48] so mean. You don't realize you are a
[1:26:51] mean
[1:26:51] character. You just think you are
[1:26:53] strict. No, you are not. You are mean.
[1:26:56] There's a difference
[1:26:58] between and being mean. And if meanness
[1:27:01] is your strength, loosen up a bit.
[1:27:05] Somebody say amen to
[1:27:07] that. You've got to loosen it up a
[1:27:10] little.
[1:27:12] right to the to make the vibration
[1:27:17] like a musician with a
[1:27:20] guitar training his
[1:27:23] strings. He has to know the t of it.
[1:27:27] Brother, sister, we ought to know the t
[1:27:30] of a Christian life. You must know that
[1:27:33] the thing sounds right. I'm not a
[1:27:36] musician. I don't even know what you
[1:27:38] guys do when you say
[1:27:40] or key F. I have no clue. But you are
[1:27:43] listening for something and you're
[1:27:46] saying that's just about the right tune.
[1:27:48] And I'm here to tell you, brother, as a
[1:27:51] preacher, I'm listening for this
[1:27:53] church. About the right tune. I can
[1:27:56] preach here any time. I feel at home. My
[1:27:58] brother, I've got gray walls in my
[1:28:01] church. They've got gray walls in their
[1:28:03] church. I've got purple chairs in my
[1:28:05] church. CH. Oh, I feel religious.
[1:28:10] Somebody say amen right now. The king of
[1:28:13] it. If you can hear a 69 year
[1:28:16] old speaking about Jesus like they
[1:28:19] received him
[1:28:22] yesterday correct. Somebody say amen.
[1:28:25] Amen.
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:32] How many say we ought even when your
[1:28:34] people are praying, you ought to hear
[1:28:35] the king of it.
[1:28:39] Praise the Lord. Listen to this. A
[1:28:43] spiritfilled
[1:28:44] man tells the king of it. Whether it's
[1:28:48] the way beyond the
[1:28:50] Bible or way behind the Bible. It ought
[1:28:54] to be in the Bible. It ought not to be
[1:28:57] beyond the Bible. And it ought not to be
[1:29:00] behind the Bible. It ought to be in the
[1:29:03] Bible. That's why the prophet taught us
[1:29:06] and he preached to us an uncertain
[1:29:09] sound. You are hearing the ting of it.
[1:29:13] You go to places, you hear a funny
[1:29:15] doctrine, it sounds funny. It is funny.
[1:29:19] Hallelujah. Because in us is a Holy
[1:29:22] Ghost gadget that senses the ting of it.
[1:29:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:31] So it ought not to be beyond the
[1:29:35] Bible and it ought not to be behind the
[1:29:38] Bible.
[1:29:41] It has to be right in the Bible exactly
[1:29:44] with thus sayeth the Lord must be
[1:29:47] trained in right then it will zero then
[1:29:52] it will hit the spot. Peter was a
[1:29:54] fisherman. He had been shooting off
[1:29:57] target for a long time.
[1:30:01] his father told him before he
[1:30:04] died, "Perhaps, son, I'm an old man. I
[1:30:08] look for the Messiah.
[1:30:10] We have we've had since Eden. He won't
[1:30:14] probably be in my
[1:30:16] day, but he may be in
[1:30:19] yours, brother. The rapture might not be
[1:30:21] in my day, but it sure is a reality. It
[1:30:26] is coming." Somebody say amen to that.
[1:30:29] Now I went to Jeffersonville for the
[1:30:31] first
[1:30:32] time. When Belam shot that whole nine
[1:30:36] times
[1:30:38] paper was signed there by the Winchester
[1:30:42] rifle to say this is an anomaly. How a
[1:30:46] man can shoot nine times in the same
[1:30:48] bullets. It's now part of history.
[1:30:55] We can now go around and say, "Hey, you
[1:30:58] think our prophet's visions were wrong?
[1:31:00] Explain that to
[1:31:01] me. What drama was God playing when God
[1:31:05] allowed him to shoot nine times in a
[1:31:09] row? You can get the best sniper in
[1:31:15] America. It was meant to be a symbol to
[1:31:20] Theophilas, excellent Theophilus. As
[1:31:23] long as you do the message
[1:31:25] right
[1:31:28] itself, it can hit the target. Not once,
[1:31:32] not twice, not three times, not four
[1:31:35] times, not five times, not six times,
[1:31:39] not seven times, not eight times, our
[1:31:41] prophet
[1:31:43] standard times, somebody say amen to
[1:31:46] that.
[1:31:49] This message
[1:31:50] of the hour
[1:31:52] is a reality.
[1:31:55] It cannot
[1:31:57] denominate its people. It has its
[1:32:01] people. It people are theophilas.
[1:32:06] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Watch
[1:32:10] program in prayer. He says, "God,
[1:32:14] take us away from this sense bound
[1:32:18] existence.
[1:32:19] carry us into those realms where all
[1:32:25] things healing is possible.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah. Redemption is possible.
[1:32:31] Whatever you require is possible. Your
[1:32:34] heart's desire is
[1:32:35] possible. Into all
[1:32:38] things, that realm where all things are
[1:32:41] possible.
[1:32:44] today and repeat us another
[1:32:47] Pentecost. We can't have another
[1:32:50] Pentecost without another
[1:32:54] theophilus. Are you
[1:32:57] here? Are you here? If you are here, we
[1:33:01] can have another Pentecost.
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:08] And now upon the pressure of and the
[1:33:11] sincerity that we are praying with now
[1:33:15] Lord I ask you to answer this prayer by
[1:33:20] sending the Holy
[1:33:21] Spirit directing his servants's minds
[1:33:25] and my thoughts and my
[1:33:27] speech fixing the
[1:33:29] hearts are there to receive it. God, we
[1:33:34] don't know what thou about to say, but
[1:33:38] thou knowest what this audience needs. I
[1:33:42] don't know what to come to church
[1:33:43] burdened with, but God knew you were
[1:33:45] coming and he knew I was coming and he
[1:33:49] knew what to preach and he knew what to
[1:33:51] place you. So I challenge and take
[1:33:54] control of every foul spirit that's
[1:33:57] bothering you in your life in the name
[1:34:00] of Jesus. Somebody say amen. I challenge
[1:34:05] every sickness in this church, be
[1:34:08] cancer, whatever it is in the name of
[1:34:12] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. If God ever
[1:34:16] had us, he can hear us again. Ever used
[1:34:19] us, he can use us again. Somebody say,
[1:34:21] "Amen." Amen.
[1:34:27] The message of the hour
[1:34:30] works all the time.
[1:34:32] How many want to work it? How many say
[1:34:35] Lord I'm available as most excellent
[1:34:39] Theophilas? Lord I'm available as your
[1:34:42] son and daughter. Lord I'm available as
[1:34:45] your
[1:34:46] beloved. The prophet shot nine nine
[1:34:49] bullets in one hole. Oh, you can do so
[1:34:52] many miracles in my life, even those
[1:34:55] that you've done before. As long as we
[1:34:57] tinker with the word and we tinker with
[1:35:01] it until we have the right Christian
[1:35:04] thing to our spiritual lives, he can do
[1:35:08] it again. He will do it over and over,
[1:35:11] over and over, over and over. And I
[1:35:15] would like to declare tonight as you go
[1:35:17] home, you shall see things you've never
[1:35:20] seen before because the
[1:35:22] supernatural goes to your neighborhoods
[1:35:25] to do what needs to be done. The Holy
[1:35:28] Ghost is here not to entertain us but to
[1:35:32] provide for us and to fix our
[1:35:35] situation better candidates for the
[1:35:37] future. Somebody say amen.
[1:35:40] [Applause]
[1:35:47] The message is perfect.
[1:35:51] The prophet was perfect.
[1:35:54] And if you are perfect
[1:35:56] like the Bible says,
[1:35:59] Abraham, a friend of God, be perfect as
[1:36:04] your father in heaven is perfect. will
[1:36:07] watch this message replicate itself over
[1:36:11] and over again, over and over again.
[1:36:14] That is why brothers and sisters, when
[1:36:16] William Brham shot the squirrels in
[1:36:19] Indiana while he was
[1:36:22] shooting to repeat it again the
[1:36:26] following
[1:36:27] year. It's the tendency of the
[1:36:30] message to repeat
[1:36:32] itself. God never healed you
[1:36:35] before he again.
[1:36:41] So I've come here
[1:36:43] tonight to prove to you the perfection
[1:36:46] of the
[1:36:47] message by my little sermon. Brother
[1:36:50] Abraham in the message state of a
[1:36:52] perfect man says last evening some
[1:36:55] friends came
[1:36:58] in they had heard that a vision told
[1:37:02] about the
[1:37:05] caribau that had 42inch
[1:37:09] horn in the silver chip grizzly
[1:37:13] bay I don't know how many people that's
[1:37:16] come to to my
[1:37:19] house that wants to see
[1:37:22] that I
[1:37:24] said here is a tape
[1:37:27] measure get on the
[1:37:32] he had it told before it
[1:37:36] happened. Why? When God says
[1:37:41] anything, it's got to
[1:37:43] happen. That's the reason it's
[1:37:47] based. Brother has told, we all know the
[1:37:51] vision of of brother seeing a boy with a
[1:37:54] checkered shirt.
[1:37:58] And that boy with a checkered shirt is
[1:38:00] now an old
[1:38:02] one. How God was going to allow the
[1:38:04] prophet to
[1:38:06] shoot a
[1:38:08] car have its horns measured to 42
[1:38:14] in. And for some reason, a sister had to
[1:38:17] pack in a checkered
[1:38:20] shirt to make the vision come to
[1:38:24] pass. And the hands that were giving the
[1:38:27] checkered shirt were at Biscll's
[1:38:31] hands and the bow had to be 42
[1:38:35] in. What drama do you think God is
[1:38:38] playing? God is trying to tell you that
[1:38:41] if I can allow my
[1:38:43] prophet to shoot nine holes in one hole,
[1:38:48] I can also allow him to shoot a specific
[1:38:53] caribou and I say to you it's going to
[1:38:56] be 42 in and it will be 42
[1:39:00] in brother once the animal is
[1:39:04] killed
[1:39:06] shrink even the shrinkage was commotated
[1:39:09] in the measurement and you tell me the
[1:39:11] message is wrong, use a liar, my friend.
[1:39:15] The message is correct. It can never be
[1:39:17] wrong. Somebody say amen to God.
[1:39:21] Amen.
[1:39:23] All
[1:39:24] that was God showing
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:29] we after diligently looking at these
[1:39:33] things, we should earnestly content for
[1:39:36] the faith that was once delivered.
[1:39:39] After seeing these things, we should not
[1:39:42] have any spake of doubt. After hearing
[1:39:46] these things, we should believe. But the
[1:39:49] word believe has never been invented.
[1:39:53] Somebody say amen.
[1:39:57] All those
[1:39:58] things were not for the people around
[1:40:01] the
[1:40:05] prophet who are
[1:40:08] guarded
[1:40:10] by the beast
[1:40:12] that Luke
[1:40:13] represents Luke because Luke Luke is one
[1:40:17] of the
[1:40:19] guards of the throne of God. The crown
[1:40:23] of God is where the word resides. That's
[1:40:26] why it's guarded. It's guarded by
[1:40:29] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Somebody
[1:40:31] say amen to that.
[1:40:34] Matthew that's baptism in Jesus name.
[1:40:38] That's why my prophet says for you to
[1:40:41] see the correct baptism in Jesus name
[1:40:45] the prophet says Matthew you must be of
[1:40:47] guard. In other words he has guarded it
[1:40:52] by saying you shall baptize people in
[1:40:56] the name of the father the son and of
[1:40:59] the holy ghost. So he's guarded it.
[1:41:03] by saying father, son, holy ghost. But
[1:41:06] yet the mystery is if you have to see
[1:41:08] it, Matthew has to be off guard. Let you
[1:41:12] see it and then he guards it. Then be
[1:41:14] off guard. Let you see it. Now Luke was
[1:41:18] guarding our portion as the gentile
[1:41:20] bride to
[1:41:22] see a supernatural message that can
[1:41:25] never go wrong. May God bless you
[1:41:27] tonight. I believe we shall see you in
[1:41:31] the rapture. If the Lord delays, we
[1:41:34] shall be serving this way. Why? Because
[1:41:37] this message doesn't need
[1:41:40] amplification. This message doesn't need
[1:41:42] correction. Let me say in
[1:41:45] French is never
[1:41:48] wrong. Amen. As I invite our pastor, I
[1:41:51] invite you to stand. And I say, brothers
[1:41:53] and sisters, you are privileged and
[1:41:55] blessed to have a pastor like our
[1:41:57] pastor.
[1:41:58] May God bless you
[1:41:59] tonight. How many know now that we are
[1:42:03] entitled to precision
[1:42:07] shooting, perfect
[1:42:10] understanding, understanding makes you
[1:42:13] ting to see whether you are in tune. If
[1:42:17] the is right, the anointing is right,
[1:42:20] the blessing is right. I double tear you
[1:42:23] tonight because you came to church not
[1:42:26] knowing that I'll be here thinking that
[1:42:28] it's just a church service. I come with
[1:42:31] a blessing. I've been received in this
[1:42:33] place. And my Bible tells me if you go
[1:42:36] to a place and you are welcome and
[1:42:39] received, let that place be blessed. May
[1:42:42] God bless you church tonight in the name
[1:42:45] of Jesus.
[1:42:47] Praise the Lord pastor. I end the
[1:42:48] service to you. Amen.
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:58] God bless you, sir.
[1:43:01] Amen.
[1:43:04] Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] I I I I appreciate his humility.
[1:43:14] What a powerful message. Amen.
[1:43:17] I loved every bit of it.
[1:43:22] Yes. Yes. Yes. Amen. I'm not going to
[1:43:23] even try to preach behind that.
[1:43:27] You know how some people do that? Uhuh.
[1:43:29] Not not me. That's
[1:43:32] one everything that needs to be said.
[1:43:35] So, we just thank the Lord
[1:43:37] for our pastor Cosby.
[1:43:41] What a blessing.
[1:43:44] Amen. Thank you, Lord. You know what I'm
[1:43:46] saying?
[1:43:47] Amen. and he he was
[1:43:51] uh he came up one way
[1:43:55] [Laughter]
[1:43:57] and he's gone down another one.
[1:44:01] But that's the way it works.
[1:44:03] I love that teing thing. They got to
[1:44:06] have that team,
[1:44:08] you know. And I thank God for the grace
[1:44:10] of God. I want to have brother uh Samuel
[1:44:13] come. I'm so full. Well, I don't know
[1:44:16] what to say, but I don't want to say
[1:44:18] nothing more. So, it's been
[1:44:21] wonderful. I I told Brother Cosby when
[1:44:24] he come back. He didn't answer me, but I
[1:44:26] said, you know, if the Lord puts back
[1:44:27] put it put it on his heart to come this
[1:44:29] way, maybe we have to do something to
[1:44:32] come bring him this way, but um I told
[1:44:35] him, I at least want to get a Saturday
[1:44:37] Saturday and a Sunday.
[1:44:41] Maybe because of the chairs being purple
[1:44:43] and the wall being
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:47] Yeah, might might give me a little
[1:44:49] something
[1:44:50] something. But I thank the Lord for him.
[1:44:52] And uh I just feel sorry for the people
[1:44:55] that couldn't make it.
[1:44:57] What a what a wonderful message.
[1:45:01] Don't forget
[1:45:03] it. Nine bullets in one hole.
[1:45:08] And then he shot it. You know, the the
[1:45:11] gun say could only go 25.
[1:45:14] 25 is not God's number. He want 50.
[1:45:19] 50 is Jubilee, right?
[1:45:22] Amen. So when you see those things, you
[1:45:24] see by God's grace,
[1:45:28] I can see brother Sam.
[1:45:32] God is so good to
[1:45:33] us. Come on. Come on. I don't know what
[1:45:36] else to do or sing or I'll let brother
[1:45:39] sing. If if however it goes by the grace
[1:45:44] of God, God is so good to us. Amen.

[1:50:49] Father God, Lord, what a wonderful
[1:50:52] message,
[1:50:53] Father, Lord Jesus, that you give us
[1:50:56] tonight, Father, Lord, Lord, to remind
[1:51:00] us, Father God, that what you did in the
[1:51:02] past, oh God, that you are able, Father,
[1:51:04] to do it tonight, Father, Lord, Lord,
[1:51:06] because you are a God of a precision,
[1:51:08] Father God, you are the God who never
[1:51:10] lies, oh Lord. Lord, if we applied the
[1:51:13] same faith, oh father, you are the same
[1:51:15] God, Lord, to show the same signs, oh
[1:51:17] Father God. Lord, if you heal the people
[1:51:20] in the past, oh Father God, you are the
[1:51:22] same God today, Father. Lord, that's why
[1:51:24] we come to you, Father, tonight, Father.
[1:51:26] Lord, as needed people, Father, Lord, if
[1:51:29] you ask every one of us, Lord, all of
[1:51:31] us, we do have needs, oh God. And only
[1:51:34] you, Father God, can see our hearts, oh
[1:51:36] Father. Lord, only you, Father Lord, can
[1:51:38] see our needs, oh Lord Jesus. That's
[1:51:40] why, Father God, we call unto you,
[1:51:42] Father, tonight, oh God, ask you,
[1:51:44] Father, Lord, to reach out to every
[1:51:46] heart, oh Father, every single heart, oh
[1:51:48] Father, Lord, and see our needs, oh
[1:51:50] Lord, and provide to it, Father, Lord
[1:51:52] Jesus. Lord, those of us, oh Father God,
[1:51:55] who need the Holy Spirit, oh Father,
[1:51:57] Lord, we pray, oh Father God, that you
[1:51:58] feel, Father, Lord, those souls, Father
[1:52:01] God, with the spirit of God, Lord Jesus,
[1:52:03] those, Lord, needs healing, Father God.
[1:52:05] Father, I pray oh God that in the name
[1:52:07] of the Lord Jesus, Father, you touch
[1:52:09] those bodies, oh Father, Lord, wherever
[1:52:11] they are, Father God, Lord, our loved
[1:52:13] ones, Father, Lord, our children, Lord,
[1:52:16] Lord, our house, Father God, every Lord,
[1:52:20] we believe, Father, Lord, Amen, Lord,
[1:52:22] that you gave your word for a purpose,
[1:52:24] Lord. The Bible says, Father God, that
[1:52:25] when you send the rain, Lord, it doesn't
[1:52:28] come back until it has fulfilled what it
[1:52:30] was sent for. Lord Jesus, you send us
[1:52:32] this message tonight, Father, for a
[1:52:35] purpose, Lord. It wasn't just to learn
[1:52:37] about guns. It wasn't, Lord, Father, to
[1:52:39] learn about the story, Father, that
[1:52:41] happened years ago, Father. Lord, is to
[1:52:43] remember, to remind us, Father God, that
[1:52:45] you are still alive, oh God. Lord Jesus,
[1:52:48] when the world of Father God is
[1:52:50] celebrating Easter, Father, Lord, Lord,
[1:52:52] talking about history, Father, Lord, we
[1:52:54] want to see the same living God, Lord,
[1:52:57] among us, Father, Lord. So, that's why
[1:52:59] we ask you to touch every heart. So
[1:53:01] Father, Lord, touch every hearts,
[1:53:03] Father. Lord, Lord, we thank you,
[1:53:04] Father, for the word, oh God. We pray,
[1:53:07] Father God, that you bless, oh Father,
[1:53:08] our Pastor Cosby, Father. Lord, that you
[1:53:11] bless his family, Father. Lord, Lord, we
[1:53:13] pray, Father God, that you continue to
[1:53:15] open your word to him, oh Father. Lord,
[1:53:18] you give him more revelation, Father, so
[1:53:19] that he can bless, oh Father, so many
[1:53:21] people, Lord. Lord, we pray for this
[1:53:23] church, oh Father. Bless us, oh Father.
[1:53:26] Bless us, Lord. Lord, we thank you,
[1:53:29] Father, for everything. God, don't let
[1:53:31] us, Father God, be like the people that
[1:53:34] the Bible says they look into a mirror
[1:53:35] and when they go away, they forget about
[1:53:37] it. Father, Lord, we want to, Lord, to
[1:53:40] keep this, Father. Lord, that every time
[1:53:42] we're in trouble, Father, every time we
[1:53:44] need you, Father, to remind ourselves,
[1:53:46] Lord, about this word, Lord, that you
[1:53:49] are still, you are going to do it,
[1:53:50] Father, for us, Lord, if you did it for
[1:53:52] Brother Brandham, Father, we believe,
[1:53:55] Father, that you would do it for us as
[1:53:56] well, Lord God. That's why we pray oh
[1:53:58] father God believing father that we have
[1:54:01] prayed oh father to a god who hears and
[1:54:03] answers our prayers lord we have prayed
[1:54:06] to a god oh father lord who has ears and
[1:54:08] hearers our prayers lord who has a mouth

[1:56:12] Oh, I told
[1:56:14] Satan, "Get thee behind because victory
[1:56:20] today is
[1:56:23] mine." Oh, victory is mine.
[1:56:28] Victory is mine. Oh, victory today is
[1:56:34] mine.
[1:56:37] Oh, I told Satan, you get thee behind
[1:56:44] because victory
[1:56:47] today. I like the verse. Oh, when I rose
[1:56:52] this
