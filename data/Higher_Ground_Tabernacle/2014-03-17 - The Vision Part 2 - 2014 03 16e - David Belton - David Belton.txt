TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen as we go uh as we continue right into the word of the Lord amen and we uh we actually um we're continuing subject Proverbs 29 29 and 18 are you happy I'm happy so if you're happy that means you understand the vision amen that means you're walking in the anointed word of the Hour See to walk in the spirit don't mean you're just walking around looking spiritually but to walk in the spirit is to walk in the anointed word for your day amen that's walking in the spirit many looks look spiritual you know but when you're walking in the anointed word for the hour Proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he see it's a blessing you're happy to keep the law and the law of God is the word of God you can be seated may the Lord have a blessing to the reading of his words as the prophet taught us the law is the word of God In seed for but when it takes on flesh he said is the grace of God and as we talked about this morning Israel chose law over Grace the worst mistake as we pointed out the law pointed out our sins but Grace said I forgive you Grace come to uh pay the debt amen He Paid a Debt he did not owe I owe that debt I could not pay amen so I'm glad he paid the debt he purchased Redemption for you and I oh God that's why we taught how the prophet taught us he said now notice the the lamb when the lamb took the book he was singing the song look up your Redemption is near but then he when the lamb takes the book Redemption is here hallelujah praise the Lord so Redemption is here the day of our Redemption is here because the lamb has took taken the book and tore off the seals amen so we must recognize what's happening Among Us that's why we can say the Messiah is here the prophet said my Ministry is to declare that Christ is here amen praise the Living God oh so we ought to be the most happiest Bunch on the face of the Earth cuz Christ is here he said I never leave you nor forsake you but many times what it is we're not conscious of his presence he preached the unrecognized presence of God or the presence of God unrecognized why because many did not recognize his presence and many think he went off the scene when brother Brena went off the scene no the presence of the Lord is here Heen see I don't want just an anointing upon my flesh an anointing upon my spirit but I want to live in his presence and to live in his presence is to live in the power of the Holy Ghost amen which is our promised land today I said that's our promis land today our promis land today is to live in the power of the Holy Ghost that's our Promised Land amen bless his wonderful name so we do have the devil's answer Christ is alive hey he's alive and well living in me living in you living in you it's Christ in you amen and Satan can't touch you amen praise the Living God that's the truth amen we have the devil's answer that's right we don't have to take his bless we don't have to be afraid of him that's the greatest curse upon the church is fear but we don't have to fear Him amen he's only amen a scarecrow and he put up scarecrows he even put scarecrows in our lives but why is the Scarecrow put up it's the scale where the crows amen not the Eagles amen hallelujah praise the Living God and what happens when there's a scarecrow up in your life what is it it's showing there's something real Hallelujah there's something real down in the field amen hallelujah it's gold down in there I can the prospector is here you know I said the gold prospector is here he's on the scene and he's digging deep down in there cuz he found something in you I canel you to B me go try it in the fire so he's digging deep down in your heart because he see gold in there that's why he in the fire amen he's Sting the fire to burn Amen to burn and burn and burn why that all the drops all the trash that's been in our lives all the trash that come up to the top that he can skim it off and then he turn the heat up why does he turn the heat up because he want to see his own reflection he see gold in you aren't you GL he see character deity Christ in you God's own life Zoe amen and character we are taught that character is not a gift character is a victory amen and the word of the Lord is tried amen Paul Peter said in 1 Peter 4:12 beloved think is not strange for the fiery trial is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but it's the glory of the Lord rest is upon you arise Shine the Light is here amen and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you aren't you glad so is his glory resting upon you now if you're going through trials now I believe was Peter instructed us he said first examine yourself and see if you're in the faith and if you know you're walking according to the word then it said glory of the Lord rested upon you and the Lord is not going to put no more on you than you can bear but now if there are sin in your life then that's chastisement but God had confidence in job because he knew that job was going to stand and job had confidence in God because he knew that God was going to keep him amen praise the Living God aren't you glad appreciate God's grace you know God briag the Satan he bragged on on on Joe to the devil he said hey man I don't want to I don't want to go through that but it's a blessing when God can brag on you when God can go to the devil and brag on you that's awesome Amen don't you want God to brag on you you see we can brag on him but God want to brag on you God want you to live such a life that he can brag on you amen have you considered my servant brother Isaiah Brooks amen have you considered my servants my sons and daughters of God have you consider any of them there's none like them in all the Earth amen there's none like you in all the Earth you are highly favored you know you are highly favored among among all the others you're highly favored you're high above the president you're high above the pope amen you're the highest Amen in the land you believe that you're the highest in the land he know what he his thoughts of you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end why because you're seeking him with all your heart oh God you're not hypocrite you mean it with all your heart you want to go all the way cuz see God don't have no pleasure in them to draw back but them that go all the way to the saving of the Soul see many of them got right up the Cades B here but they didn't never crossed over they tasted of the word of God and the powers of the word to come but they only got to Kadesh banir they never received it is have you received the Holy Ghost is not when you believe that's a Baptist Doctrine but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message of the hour is this the message of the hour or do we look for another John got a little little little dimmed over go ask him is he the one is he the Messiah is he the one or do we look for another because first they asked John John are you the Christ he said no are you that Prophet what prophet Deuteronomy 18:15 no are you Eli then the one before the draft of day no well who are you John I'm the voice of one Christ in the wilderness as said the prophet Isaiah John gave them a scripture identification of himself and you as a son and daughter of God ought to give the anybody who ask a scripture identification of why you believe what you believe a lot of people go to a sinner and say you know brother brandham said this the prophet said that they don't even know Christ you know what I'm saying Jesus didn't right away told them about Elijah you know that he taught them in the scripture and as we tell them enough as they see that Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever they'll ask you well what's the prophet for this day you know if you rightly tell them and show them Christ in the word they G to ask you who is Elijah or where is Elijah cuz they going to catch the pattern of God and as we show them the pattern of God and how God works and how he thinks and how he never changes then they'll see see it hey man bless His holy name it's the truth you know later on in in the ministry Jesus said now and they said Lord didn't scribe said that Elijah should first come and restore remember they asked him and then he begin to show them yes praise the Lord he's the same he never changes he never breaks his word amen so amen I want to read something it's it's Amplified and I I love this cuz it's it brings some Hebrew words Hebrew interpretations and it it blesses my soul Isaiah 60 it says arise from the depression this Isaiah 60 verse1 arise from depression and prostration in which circumstances have kept you rise to a New Life shine be radiant with glory of the Lord for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you and a prophet taught us in Christ revealed in his own word he said now remember Satan have one punch coming God has given him that right but see we don't have to let him keep punching on us it's time to rise up amen we had to fight him sooner or later and the time is right now amen praise the Living God to cast the revelation of the word and the revelation of the blood and driveing Into the Heart of the enemy not on one another because we know elect does not persecute El La you as we search the scripture and the Bible tells us be ready to give an answer to the hope that lies within you steadly show their S approv A Workman need not be ashamed rightly devid in the word of Truth amen 1 Peter 3:15 2 Timothy 2:15 it tells us that so now elect does not persecute elac and if you find as we see the Scriptures it was always the non-elect that was doing the persecution always it was always the non-elect trying to labor everybody trying to say who's who and who's not trying to say who's bride and who's not bride that's not our place that's not our business praise the Lord but long we are called to recognize who we are and who he is amen that's what matters to me praise the Living God for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and den Darkness All Peoples but the Lord shall rise upon you and His glory shall be seen on you amen praise the Lord don't you want his glory to be seen upon you I want his glory to be seen upon me so Redemption comes in two parts out of and into praise the Lord see as we said many came out as God called a nation out of a Nation he's calling a bride out of the church praise the Lord I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them amen I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them see every age had a song Amen my Lu went forth singing Al Mighty Fortress Is Our God her bull walk never fail amen they went forth singing man John Wesley and and and and Charles Wesley went forth singing amen the Pentecost went forth singing but in this day only believe all things are possible only believe amen down from his glory ever living story amen it's going to take a stronger win than this amen hallelujah praise the Living God we're guilt free it's his elective love hallelujah oh God praise the Living God oh God every Revival produ new songs not just twins but it produce new songs amen praise the Living God so now what do we have we have God he he moves and he He makes himself known by visions you know even uh St John 5:19 the son can do nothing of his own self but what he seeth the father do that doeth the son likewise the Lord Jesus moved by Vision amen and God he uses dreams at times he showed Joseph in a dream to go another way God we know dreams are secondarily but God also he comes by inspiration he said when you come to these uh great trials and and and you're brought before counsels don't even don't even premeditate don't even think what you should say but because you're walking in the word because you're walking in the law of God which is the word of God the anointed word of this hour then God will bring it back to your remembrance when it's time for it amen and he will inspire you to speak it that's the word of God the inspiration comes from the almighty it's the breath of of God am amen he He makes himself known by symbols by Parables and also through a prophet Amen in songs in music in poets and poems all that is the ministry of Christ amen signs wonders Miracles the nine spiritual gifts God operates in many ways but we know his first way is by his word because the word of the Lord is the voice of God so we're so thankful as many ways God makes himself known many ways so we're thankful for that we know he have before the written word was the unwritten word the Loos amen aren't you glad but then he he wanted to put it in the Zodiac God's first Bible written in the Zodiac his second Bible written uh in the pyramid and now his third Bible is written on pages in words but they don't stop there we're the word hallelujah we're the Bible for today amen we are the manifested light of this hour Remy pisses known and read of all men a't she glad we are the Living Word today Christ send you the hope of glory amen that's what the devil hates but that's the whole purpose that's the essence as we said this morning the token that's the essence amen of what God want wanted to do because he Elohim existed alone but he wanted a family I'm glad to be a part of his family aren't you glad oh God oh God and then how the prophet taught us he saw God in nature aren't you glad even in nature we could see God God described himself as as a dove the spirit of God like a you know he described himself as a lamb you know God one thing about him you know he boasting himself if anybody have a right to boast God have a right to boast he swore by himself to Abraham you know we could swear about something greater growing up we used to swear about our Granddaddy and grandmother but but he swore by himself can you imagine that a man say swear by myself they couldn't do it but he could do it so he swore by himself that he'll bless us cuz he could find no one greater amen I love that so he swore by himself to Abraham that I'mma bless you and your seed after you and one thing about Abraham seed the prophet said Abraham seats believe the words the word of God quickly and walks in it just like David he repented quick see it have to be that way someone going on 10 years down the road and still don't know whether he was a true Prophet or not something is wrong some said we don't have a cloud Ministry but I believe that cloud I believe that it was super natural just as sure as the veil was rent from top to bottom that cloud is true regardless how much the devil put scarecrows there but it's the word of God and as Ezekiel said whether they hear or whether they forbear yet they will know that a prophet is been among them amen just as sure it was the days of Noah and the days of lot so shall it be in his en time the son of man is being revealed and I'm glad for his grace one thing about God when he sent Moses you know when he sent [Music] Moses then [Music] Moses um there he he was giving those signs and as he was giving those signs he threw his serpent this broad it was thrown down rather turned to a serpent Pharaoh call his musicians they threw down ass turn the serpent even though Moses serpent ate up their I believe it was showing that death was going to be swallowed up amen Jesus conquered death hell in the grave but not only that when he called FRS when he threw up the dust he called for life he went to Pharaoh can't do see the devil can impersonate every gift but he cannot create he man aren't you glad oh God see God God knew what he was going to do all along see the devil thought he had an edge but God was only only just just uh lured him amen into a trap and the devil know he can't create but he can impersonate every gift the prophet said Satan hand out the gifts by the hand fs and he'll say if I could just get them off the word then he got them but as long as we stay fortified behind the word we cannot be deceived we are the word we cannot be deceived you should know them by their fruits their teaching praise the Lord bless his wonderful name so the enemy can't create the word can't can't add to the word can't misinterpret the word can't misapply can't mislocate the word amen the third pool cannot be impersonated remember the first two the enemy impersonate but you can't impersonate the third pool can't impersonate the true love of God even an animal or a baby they could pick up the spirit of Love they could pick it up and also an animal could pick up the spirit of fear so impersonate it can't impersonate and not holy of holies to impersonate that is death we know back in the Garden of Eden that way after man failed God placed those cherums there with flaming swords to guard the way to the tree of life because God cannot break his word he said the day you eat thereof the tree of knowledge the day you die so God had to place those shums there to God the way cuz Adam would eventually I'm dropping this in I believe Adam would eventually ate himself into an immortal body Adam could have say tree be plucked up in place over here and they were in perfect Fellowship they met every evening and had church amen my and some can't go three days a week with church M but they met every evening and the pillow fire met them there and they had fellowship with almighty God even the animals you know praise the Living God it's something about perfect love I had a dream years ago about 20 years ago 1994 and the Lord was showing me in the dream there were these Prehistoric Beasts I was in a forest and these Prehistoric Beasts were coming after me to rip me apart and there were people looking inside rejoicing to see my hurt to see me ripped apart and a voice begin to speak to me and say don't fear I climbed up in a tree try to protect myself but the creatures were so big they could reach in the tree the for said come down out of the tree and then when I came down out of the tree they were constantly coming after me to rip me apart and and those people I didn't see any faces I'm glad I did but rejoicing to see my hurt but then all of a sudden the voice said I've given you supreme power and control over every creeping thing in beast of the Earth according to Genesis to and all of a sudden the spirit of perfect love Came Upon me the anointing of perfect Love It Came Upon me in the dream and all those animals that was coming to rip me apart they stopped in their tracks and went their ways and I woke up crying because I believe I had experience that rim of perfect love that and the Prophet come told us whatever you do get perfect love no one can enter him without it love is the greatest force on this Earth love called amen love told the Hornets to go back to their nest perfect love stopped the killer bu in his tracks amen perfect love was spoken salvation I give you your two sons in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen perfect love said before the doctors touch her let the tumor be gone maybe some would have said that's judgment on you for talking to me the wrong way you know maybe some men told their wife that but here perfect love said before the doctors touch her let the tumor be gone perfect love said told that couple I forgive you perfect love told the maniac when he HK spit in his face he said I love him you see what perfect love does but because you've challenged the Son of God you'll fall to my feet why because the word of God the scripture cannot be broken he said I will cause your enemies to fall at you your feet hey man aren't you glad he said I've given you all power over the enemy so whatever you do get perfect love now this is the real to enter in Praise the Lord and our theme today is entering into omnipotence let us enter into omnipotence that's where we at we must God has called us to enter into omnipotence omnipotence you said what is it what is it it's unlimited power it's unlimited resources the song only believe all things are possible he said the angel of the Lord loved that song what it means it means unlimited power that's what it means the astronaut age why is the astronaut age is unlimited powers where are we today we have unlimited Powers Through the Ages there was only a dip of the Holy Ghost but because the seals were open the foolishness of the word came back and was revealed under the Earth why that the Holy Ghost now could come in his fullness that's where we at in other words right now it's unlimited what God can do so all things are possible them that believeth that's where we at that's perfect faith not a faith but perfect faith and perfect faith is wrapped in faith amen and perfect Faith worketh by perfect love amen and perfect faith brings the revelation of the perfect interpretation of the perfect word of God Amen and perfect strength comes by Perfect weakness we realize that we were nobodies we realize that we had to doubt and R to our own ways and our own thoughts and our own self and acknowledge God in his ways amen so we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ amen and what it does it brings us to the stature of a perfect man oh bless his wonderful name so we're so thankful so what is it we have to start right now and face the enemy amen praise the Living God because we have what it takes by the grace of God we have what it takes it's God's Mercy is God's grace oh God makes himself present in his army then do you believe that God said I sent them the word eve just walked right over the top of it disbel it I made it manifest and they crucified it I'm just getting tired I'm coming myself cuz man kept failing God but God said I'm coming myself so here he come God in you hey amen God above us the pillar fire God With Us in Jesus Christ God in us the Holy Spirit what is it the same word the same God Amen no more trusted in anything else God come himself this was a mansiz job so he just brought it on down he come down himself they won't have to do nothing about it see see Israel wanted to do something about it but they won't have to do nothing about it we appreciate his grace coming down amen oh my that's it I'll do I'll do the work just let them just humble thems let them just empty up I'll just beat my enemy out there through them God want to defeat the Devil through you through me a she glad yes sir that's it you can't do it in yourself now you're not a match for him but if you just let God do it get the word in you and it'll be taken care of now God fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what the office of the church is is God's dress inside dress Apostle Prophet sir before say never gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church these officers is God's dressar when you see those officers pastors teachers evangelist what is it that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit and is working through manen but if those officers denies any of the word this word then is not God dressing see we're not going to be like Cinderella Cinderella was missing a slipper but we will be fully dressed waiting on him amen waiting on our bridegroom to come catch us away aren't you glad we being the bride his wife has made herself ready how she's putting on the word hallelujah praise the Living God so glad I'm so glad I'm doing some reading tonight when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you'll still off the real true foundation but when these virtues grow in as you added on to that then you are a living Monument you a living moving Idol praise the Living God that's why the prophet said we should ask God for word on top of word on top of word why because we gonna need it we needed to defeat the enemy he's going like a roaring line he's not a roaring line but he's going like a ro line but remember when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God lifts up a standard against the enemy every time he came he came on his white horse that that Lon anointing came he came on his red horse amen that Ox anointing came he came on his black horse amen that wisdom of the man came and now he's beginning just about begin to ride on his Pale Horse where that eager anointing is here to combat every demon from hell and we know the lead has already been torn off of hell and those demons have been loosed Revelation 9 and 13 through 16 the river Euphrates they they come to go against not against denominations but against the bride but we must abide under the shadow of his wings under those Eagles Wings amen and he'll combat every demon that comes up against us praise the Living God as we know the word of God you know what say it in the time of peace I don't know who said that phrase way back I try to search it say in the time of peace prepare for war Always Be Ready for War and the greatest battle of fought is right here see God chose to meet the enemy in no man's land not to meet the enemy in your heart not to meet the enemy in your flesh but he chose to meet the enemy in the no man's land in the battleground of your mind and that's the greatest battle I ever fought is right in the human mind but we have Victory even the Lord Jesus he had to be partakers because he was the he is the husband so he he had to be partakers of the first fruits and the Bible tells us Amen in Hebrews 5 he was tempted All Points like on us yet without sin you said what's all Point lust at I lust of the flesh the pride of life those are the points after that the government come out amen it's the truth so it's Faith the Lord Jesus lived in a world of perfect faith and perfect Faith Faith Works by love I'm so glad so we got to possess those things in Christ as we talked about this morning there's only one thing the devil is afraid of that blood that word and Faith holds to it it's strong see faith is strong it takes a strong hand of faith and we marching on in the Lord we can't look back frog look back but those four living creatures they kept moving forward and we're moving forward amen cuz one time those full living creatures were blocking us away to enter but now it's death not to enter so I'm glad even Paul went on to say let us boldly go before the throne of grace to obtain Mercy to find Grace to help in the time of need and I'm in need he said let us therefore Brethren have boldness to enter in by the blood of Jesus enter into the holy of holies enter into that omnipotent power I I got phone right so we can enter in can enter in I want to read something here scientists discovered over the years that grudges causes high blood pressure can't hold any grudges they discovered that hatred causes heart can't have any hat they discovered that worry is causes horses and the prophet taught us variation there's no virtue in it at all there we are taught they discovered that bitterness causes cancerous cells and then I added one jealousy causes murder now you can murder someone naturally or spiritually you can kill their character see so so we don't want any parts of that and and Paul even talked about Hamas and Pates and they were preaching false Doctrine he he talked about them and he said but their word shall eat like a canker so we can't hold any of those things now that word canker it means gain green it's a disease by which any part of the body suffering from inflammation become so corrupt that unless a remedy be seasonably applied we know the remedy the remedy is the Holy Ghost unless the remedy remedy be seasonably apply apply at the right time the evil continually spreads attacks other parts of the body that's why the prophet taught us that he said the enemy will come in and try to bring isms but let it shape up or ship out because it can destroy the body someone come to you to speak against someone say let's pray for amen we don't want any gossip you remember the Corinthians were in all of that you remember but the Ephesians were so much further along Paul told the Ephesians you know the Galatians were putting burdens Galatians were putting burdens on the people wanted them to receive it by by law and by works and they received it by Grace the Romans got self-righteous the Hebrews were legalistic because Paul said you should have been teachers and now you need to be taught the Corinthians were babies they couldn't even take bely could take the milk see they couldn't even receive strong meat but the Hebrews couldn't receive strong meat but Ephesians Paul said I he said I've heard of you he didn't say I heard of your gossip to the Ephesians and the Colossians and the Philippians and even the Thessalonians he said I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints not of your gossip not of your backbiting not of your hatred and grudges and all those things and isms but I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints ammen don't you want God to say that about you he can say that about Higher Ground Tabernacle amen praise the Liv I heard of your faith I've heard of your love amen praise the Living God and this message is to produce another Ephesian church that's what it's doing we don't want all that other stuff that that chipm chatter chatter chatter you know job had three friends bildad Z zor help me out in El elas one meant dogmatic that's what one one of dog he was dogmatic one of them meant uh uh one of them meant contention and the other other one it meant gossip or chatter see that chipmunk Shadow just gossip the latest gossip you know they they criticize many times they criticize the they always say the sisters gossip gossip but you know I've learned that preachers gossip more than sisters they say what they want to say it's the truth you know I'm telling you I had to call one brother when he called me I said brother it wasn't brother Minister I said brother I want to tell you I'm not an information center I said go somewhere else I said call th zero praise the Lord and I've learned I said the Saints back home I said what we talk about in the office Les you tell it and it's it's seal because I've learned we must confidenti amen we have one chance for that I said I will not preach your sins on the pull pit I'm not going to throw slams upon you I come to you proud praise the Living God so it spreads throughout the body evily evil continually spreads attacks other parts of the body and at last eats away the bones you see how deadly that is so thank God for Grace it takes the supernatural Holy Ghost to come and take everything out that's not like him can't have any hatred many of them want to operate in these amip po and as the prophet taught him how can I teach them algebra when they don't know the ABCs amen praise the Living God so now as we move on I'm glad for the ABCs but let us go into Perfection amen don't you love it see the broad goes all the way cuz God have no pleasure in them to draw back but them that go all the way to the saving of the Soul I'm going all the way to the saving of the Soul amen one song Say all the way so when my man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting in the bride material you see see you're getting in the raping condition amen that's what we need raping Faith must be preached in order to have rap in faith amen that means for each of us not just the pastor the deacons the [Music] trustees that means for the Ley see sister H Wy got sister hety Wright got in the right channel it's not just the pastor it's not just the deacons not just the trustees you know in the olden days back in the time of the the the anglian church they were teaching that during the time John Wesley and uh Whitfield was on the scene they were teaching that only the the clergy can be born again so the sister start having Bible studies in her home that's how Whitfield heard the gospel in his day he and John Wesley were together even when John Wesley horse broke his leg or had that inine but and we know that's a false Doctrine it's for every son and daughter of God because it's already written in Jeremiah 31:31 behold I will make a New Covenant with my people not as I wrote on the tables of stone but I will write my laws in their minds and in their hearts Ezekiel said I will take away the Stony heart and give you a heart of Flesh I will give you a new heart which is a new way of thinking I will give you a new spirit which is new desires and then I put my spirit within you say the Lord he said in Jeremiah 31 All Shall know me from the least to the greatest not just the preachers not just the fivefold ministry but every son and daughter of God shall know me say the Lord of host that's God's covenant no man died for you it's Jesus Christ he's the mediator he's the only mediator between God and man so there's no man in this that's why the prophet said many are establishing them own their own self in the heart of the people but we are called to establish the word of God in the hearts of the people amen amen and only the word of God not ourselves Jesus made himself of no reputation it's not I to do with the work but my father dwell the thing to me he said my father is greater than me amen greater than I amen praise the Living God you know sometime up here I make I make my own dictionary reper don't have nothing on me but you know those young folks coming correct I said well I know what I mean take me like the Dutchman take me for what I mean and not what I say so I got all kind of words I done wrote my own this there praise the Lord you see you're getting in erupting condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor DEC construes that means for the Ley every individual walks in a world with God Alone you're baptizing his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God heyen don't you love it Christ in you see you and God of the majority not you and someone else not you and your spouse and God you and God are the majority praise the Living God oh praise the Lord see he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it no one talk you in no one can talk you out amen this is not psychology this is not rivalry is by the Holy Ghost God draw you then God will keep you God don't draw you unless he gonna keep you that's the truth you don't halfway do anything he started to work in you he's faithful to complete it he's the faithful one you know Jeremiah went a Time said I'm not going to preach anymore he got discouraged said I would not even make mention of his name I said I ain't gonna say nothing about the message anymore I'm not going to even mention it God didn't say nothing what God do God set his heart on fire and Jeremiah came back he said I cannot contain it he said the word of the Lord in my heart the word of the Lord in my heart is like fire shut up my bones I cannot shut up I cannot hold my peace amen so many US get a little discouraged and said that's it but if they're Chosen and elected God going to set them on fire because the word is there and God s the father quick in the word amen you see how loving God is you see the grace of God you know elu one day the prophet said I'mma show that show you that elu is Christ I never saw where he went and preached that but he said I'm going show you he would say I'mma show you that elu is Christ he never preached it but elu described it like this elu in in job 32 and 18 and 19 elu said it's like he says like wine in a bottle about to burst he could not hold it amen hallelujah you remember the sister went to brother brandom said brother randam I'm about to bust Hallelujah don't you feel like that sometime like you going just bust oh praise the Lord that's why he can't put new wine in Old botles we got to rock ourself amen and receive new skin and he'll put new wine in new skin he'll put new garment in new garment not new garment to Old garment it'll rent it won't work praise the Lord Jesus Christ you know the Psalms in in Psalm 30 9 he says he said it was hot within me it's hot within me it's so wonderful you can't describe it it's the stimulation of the revelation of the word oh it's hot within me oh God it's a burning on the inside oh praise the Living God bless his wonderful name I'm so thankful can't talk you out of it go right on just the same now you're coming in the perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails this faith never fails the word never fails perfect love never fails charity never faileth the word cannot fail before before one J one to the fa Heaven and Earth will pass away so the word of God is forever settled in the heavens it cannot fail he was a Mystic and also in the holy of holies there's Victory all the time in the holy of holies when you live in there the glory never fails amen yes he was Amis to them with perfect Faith with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect Faith are a Mystic to others people not going to understand you we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us now to resist is to just simply turn him down just resist him let us just walk away from him you young people especially it's like a 18wheeler driving down the road you jump you run to get out of the way that's how dangerous you got to shun the very appearance of evil you have to learn the Master human ability God said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says see to he that hath an ear that listens see what the spirit say to the churches the one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit says to the churches see he an ear let him hear what the spirit said into the churches that's bride material and the Lord God as we read God changed his ministry in him from Miracles the teaching of the word because we know the greatest healing is the healing of the Soul remember in St Luke 108 17-9 the Lord Jesus when they went the disciples went to him Lord even Spirits are subject unto us through that name but there were others casting out demons wasn't even falling after him he but he said Rejoice not cuz CU demons Spirits are s under you but joice Rejoice rather because your names are written in heaven and then in Luke 15 what it tells us it tells us that when a sinner repent it never said that when a person is healed of a physical sickness in the body that there was joy in the presence of the Angels but when a sinner repents when a sinner comes to be a saint amen when a drunker and a liar comes to be a son and daughter of God Amen when a street woman becomes a lady hey man when a drunken becomes a gentleman there's joy in the presence of the Angels over one sinner that repented heyen bless this wonderful name aren't you glad so that is the greatest miracle that is the greatest healing the healing of the soul that word come into the soul amen praise the Living God so it's the teaching of that word surely you could read between the lines you're not that blind notice as soon as God changes Ministry his miracles went on but not like that he begin to tell them the straight scripture truth where they were standing the crowd walked away from him this is a hard saying what happened see you had to tell them where they are standing but I'm glad he came to tell me where I was standing because where I was standing the wrath of God was against me remember Ephesians we were all by Nature the children of Wrath born in sin Psalm 51 and5 Psalm 58 and3 shaping in iniquity came to the world speaking lies we didn't have to remain that way but you had he Quicken you has he brought to life Quicken means to bring alive again Hallelujah we were all dead in trespasses and sin but he's quick in US aren't you glad we who had the wrath of God upon us against us the blood was on our hands we were just as guilty at one time but we've applied it to our hearts God who's rich in Mercy amen amen so glad so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and you set me free so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm Yours Hallelujah his mercy found you his mercy found me mercy reot my life mercy reot your life hallelujah amen oh praise the Living God I'm so glad amen you know there was a time when when Israel was in Exile and I love Ezra and Nehemiah I love to read about them they were devout men of prayer and and men that stood and they they got to a place where they applied the word to them themselves first before they applied it to the people they wanted to be right before they going to give it to the people and up until that time Israel was never even called a people of the book until that time in that era they were called a people of the book then and we SE that Ezra and neemi there was a time course Ezra was used used to build the temple and Nehemiah was used to build the wall and even though San Balon and Tobias came when the work of the Lord was going on they try to talk nemiah out of it to come down nemiah said we're not coming down amen you can tell him we're not coming down we caught up in the mystery of the seven seal and we're not coming down we are caught up in his unipotent powers and we're not coming down s bad and tabas even begin to tell them and they lied and they they said we're Jews also but they were not Jews they were Liars then they paid a false prophet to go prophesy to neemi they paid him off see we're not hard servants amen we love the Lord and we love his people so we're not we're not harling see a harling don't care for The Souls of the people a harling just want his pay God call him in Isaiah 56 greedy dogs you know he Al also call them dumb dogs so what they have they have GDs greedy dogs and they have DDS dumb dogs God call them dumb dogs and greedy dogs amen it's the truth and Paul said Beware of dogs amen and Jesus said Beware of wolfs so they're hings they're wols they're greedy dogs and dumb dogs I'm not just saying that God call them that amen we can speak the truth in love we don't have to be dog but we have to tell the truth in love praise the Living God so he said we're not coming down even balam balam was hard curse him you can't curse what God has blessed no one can curse you they'll only bless you they can't curse you because you're under the blood you are Abraham's raw seed and no one can curse the raw Seed of Abraham could only bless can you imagine balum even this even this female donkey women preachers always try to get me well God can use a donkey he could use me I said but remember it was a female donkey that spoke with a man's voice so they back up then I have to say there's one one woman preacher with two of them said do you mean to tell me all that white stuff comes out of my mouth when I speak in tongues that I don't have the Holy Ghost I said according to scripture anyone that formed out the mouth was Poss possessed with a demon they got so upset their brother came out the room after me with a shotgun I had to leave he couldn't take the word but you imagine this this female donkey speaking to balam and he it didn't dawn on him wait a minute my donkey is talking to me in my language you know to to the donkey it was tongues but here his he having a conversation with this donkey you know Lord have mercy I mean that's really blind a donkey that never talked to you and now he's talking to you and you still going on to try to curse the children is that should have woke him up God have mercy he was blinded I'm that's why I'm so thankful it's God that open our eyes that's why Jesus could say blessed are your eyes for you see we have nothing to do with it if we ever think we have anything to do with it we've gotten off the beaten path we got to if we ever think we have anything in it CU we don't we can Rejoice we can rejoice in it cuz the Lord Jesus Rejoice Amen in Matthew 11 he Matthew 11:25 he said oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth the Bible say he rejoiced in the spirit and say I thank thee Oh father I thank thee for hiding these things from the wise and prudent and revealing them under babes and the prophet added such as we learn amen praise the Living God so now what do we see some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone what did it they do when they when they had the the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever GI to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without magic and one day he entered into the temple picked up the stro and read it and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me the priest the accepted of a year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick to give sight to the blind now we would think of such anointing was on him that been prophesied 800 years before that it would come with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we will want to run all over the building streaming Hollow but the Bible said he laid down the strob he sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions now I love to shout at times when it hit me it just happens it happens when it happens you can't manufacture it but we can't jump no heart and we live but when it comes praise the Lord I love it there Joy bells ringing in my my soul the priest danced because and there was noise in there when they heard that noise and they hear those Bears it could say I couldn't imagine Joy bells ringing in my soul Joy bells ringing in my soul amen hallelujah Joy bells ringing Joy bells ringing Joy bells ringing in my soul amen because anything that don't have emotions is dead and need to be bad anyway amen so I'm not speaking against motions but anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how see and that's what's here see and the secret is what the word is in the bride as it was in Mary she knows what he wants done with the word she keeps still until she have th set the Lord see we don't have to manufacture anything amen we don't have to prove anything to the devil God will use us to prove to the devil as the song says M I'm in a lot of songs tonight but Satan we're going to tellar your kingdom down amen you've been building your kingdom all over this land but Satan we going to tear your kingdom down amen we boast in the Lord so that's the greatest anointing we're so thankful all right here was voices Oh how we need in here today not just Zep but thousands of Little voices the Thunder of God burning out sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that Thunder against the enemy me the devil don't care how loud you holler now notice in the time of Ezra as Ezra read the word the Bible say he stand aloud he read aloud he stand upon the pull pit of wood he was above the people and he read aloud the law and as he read the people begin to weep they wept they wept because they did not understand but then the scripture tells us that those priests went to the people and caused the people to understand and begin to tell them this is not the time of weeping this is the time of rejoicing amen John we bility before he understood but when he recognized who he was when he recognized his name he cried out amen so without a revelation yeah they could walk and be sad but once the word is revealed to you see it's not just the opening of the word and revealing of the word to the prophet no now that opening and revealing must be to us remember to the Gentiles individual see behold I send you Elijah the prophet it's personal you got to take it personal if one going in the Rapture you should say I'm not one you should have that much Faith to say I'm not one praise the lord it's to the individual is personal so they broke it down to the people I said Lord cuz I asked the Lord I said the prophet said birth pains he said now I'm laying the seed out but if it if it be the will of the Lord he said these ministers will come along bring it to life make more sense of what I'm saying just like those priests in the time of Ezra they took what Ezra read and they caused the people to understand he's the same yesterday today and forever and now the Holy Ghost through the 5f and it don't stop as we said earlier it does not stop at the fivefold but the Holy Ghost because why we must have the not just the inside dress but we must have the inside teach amen yes there real Christians that Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can hide remember on the day of Pentecost ask of the Holy Spirit when Peter baptized 3,000 Souls devil didn't even move out of his bed didn't even turn over when he saw a manifested life knocked him off his place amen the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this a shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything see it's not Paul I know Jesus I know brother brandom I know brother Isaiah Brooks I know but who are you the devil should say the same thing about you it's the truth you know every son and daughter of God he should be afraid of and believe it or not he is afraid of you but you have to understand that he's afraid of you more than you realize call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil something jump up and down and holler the prophet just went up and said Satan leave him leave her in the name of Jesus Christ wasn't all that jumping and holling and streaming you know the disciples as the prophet said the disciples went out we cast you out we cast you out so the devil didn't didn't move when you walk with authority knowing who you are amen after the Holy Ghost comes upon you you shall receive power now notice they were given one power before the Holy Ghost was given power which was Authority now that was different but on the coming of the Holy Ghost they were given another Power amen dunamus Christ in you there was a difference there's a difference I'm coming down you people here tonight God is depending on you to project his love to the CER there's something about a man or woman there's something about a man or a woman you you are a miniature Creator this is our climax right here you are a miniature Creator have you ever seen people that you just love to be around it's the atmosphere they create around you other nice people you just can't stand to be around they create that by the way they live the way they think it's a little atmosphere you live in got to be the it's the atmosphere it got to to be the right atmosphere we have to continue to dig the prophet say I will continue to dig and humble thyself he said if you want to miss the tribulation you got to dig keep digging he said I'm going to keep digging he said we got to keep digging deeper and deeper we can never get enough of this it's like in the middle of an ocean you know it's so much worse you know shall of water you jump in it you take a dive in it you going get hurt you can dive all day in deep water amen hallelujah so we love the Lord Jesus Christ as the prophet taught us when the supernatural comes in it's the mind of Christ it's far from our own thinking that's where God want us to live that's where he wants us to live now notice perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it and we were created to master to become master of all circumstance remember earlier Isaiah said arise from any circumstance that that perhaps got you in depression you know I found out it shouldn't be among us but a lot of people and and and Lord forgive me but a lot of people maybe I hope there's no doctors and nurses in here if you are forgive me but a lot of people they are on medicine it shouldn't be among the bride I'm telling you it should not be among the bride we have an anointed word here to deliver from all of those things but we did a little study on it and and and and it shows that the pharmacist the psychiatrist and the physician not all of them all of them not one doctor my my uncle my uncle was 80 something years old 87 he passed away at 87 never had a toothache he never drunk any whiskey or anything like that never never was sick but he started having some heart situations problems and he went to Charon so he asked the doctor why are you sending me to chareston he said to be honest with you I would make more money if I send you the child that's was the only reason so uh but every doctor is not like that but we found out that some of the people got in went in Disguise as patients and they went in Disguise as employees for these other people and they reported and show how the pharmacist many of the pharmacists psychiatrists and the doctors work together to get a patient for life that's their whole goal they got and they this book got thicker and thicker of all these different diseases they call psychiatrist name the book begin to grow and grow and grow and it got to a point where and they give him all these disas these medicines that cause a suicidal you look at the read the after facts a lot of after facts and young people were just killing themselves because of that medicine they they they it it was proven to be that reason why and and then uh but many of them were were viewed and and they they got where if you turn if they go send them to psch psychiatrist they got where they would actually U the psychologist if a person a patient refused a medicine they had even a a disease for that really is in the book if they refuse to take medicine they call that something so they couldn't get around it they were determined to have a patient because they it was a it's a money scheme everyone get a percentage for life can you imagine that I mean that's pretty good when you got 2,000 patients and if it only $5 you know a month you know so Lord have mercy and now when the Brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong see there's no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's unlimited resources of God has never been ta yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been even revealed to archangels hey man that we have a song The Angels can't sing hey man aren't you glad oh the angels have to sit and listen to our song of redemption oh praise the Lord we'll sing a song of redemption they will not join along because they don't know the song they don't know him as a redeemer they don't know him as a deliverer they don't know him as a Healer praise the Lord but we can sing Redemption story amen oh Victory in Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and bought me with his redeeming blood amen he love me now yeah I know him amen bless his wonderful name so it's not even revealed the archangels is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for I have not seen ear have not heard neither has it in in the heart of men what God has for them in store that love him so let's move up and claim our rights amen as God opens the gates and swings out the we command let's move on up into deeper deaths and never colonize ourself to organize ourself we put a period on the word we die Enoch had a progressive walk the prophet had a progressive walk a lot of people don't like that the prophet made mistakes but when the seals were open all those mistakes were corrected I believe that but at one time he was saying evidence of the Holy Ghost fruit of the spirit love Meet Joy patience long suffering later on he said I used to say that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was love he said but the Lord in the vision straight me out on that but he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word of God for your day and walk in it and have a clear understanding and he went on to say one one place he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said when the Holy Spirit Come And Lead you and guide you in all truth and then he also said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is those that sign and crying out for the Abomination is done among the message of our among our ranks that's where we place it today then he also said the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said the real you is the je so he had a progressive walk they say he's infallible but you know he said I'm not infallible he said that's the offest thing to say that I'm infallible he said the word of of the Lord is infallible amen God don't build a revelation on any man he didn't build it upon Peter he didn't build it upon Paul he didn't build it upon the prophet he build it upon the spiritual revelation of who he is that's what hell is against amen I don't want a second-handed revelation now I thank God for a second-handed robe amen the same robe that Elijah wor Elisha wor Elisha had to grow to it but it was a firsthand experience cuz Elijah said where is the Lord God of Elijah and Elijah did four Miracles Elisha did eight Miracles the same God the same word the same Revelation it had to be personal have to be personal because it because God won't share his glory with the so I'm so thankful have to move on Amen to get into a place where this we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God I think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the Lord Jesus to receive all that you can from the hand of his Bountiful mercies that that's my heart that's the reason I never joined any organization or took sides with any group why you put a period you die because I wanted myself wide open for the love of God and for what he could give to me that's our desire amen the church ought to be grown by this time but many of us who ought to be teaching others or yet design a sincere milk of the Bible see we need someone to teach us when we should be teachers and to know I bow my head in shame that I should know more about God than I do the prophet saying that about himself the Lord told him he he handled the first and second poor wrong but he said this third poor can not be pers he said I'm drawing back I'm dropping back he said what you've seen in a minority in his ministry you will see it in the fullness of his power in the bride the cast tightens down begins to tighten down that's what's happened so now are we the Sons and Daughters of God now Faith is now the brid Revival is on Amen will cut every obstacle from human beings that they might might be connected like the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent unlimited Powers you don't believe that but he is a man is fully surrendered to God is omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you've said that's what we at that's the time we liveing in don't look for it down the road it's now if you never cried for it how you going to get it so we believe this plus what God going to show will show [Music] us but the church is always looking back let's look up for their powers are unlimited and we have unlimited power for all things are possible to them that believe in God real genuine faith will punctuate every word that God give with them with a amen not well is for another generation I'm not looking for another generation is for us he's the same yesterday today and forever now we could have got get any continuity amongst Medics amongst scientists different ones but if if Einstein had only had the spiritual application as he had the physical application as he studied the laws of light and so forth he could have told us something when I heard his message on the great Center somewhere into the skies that ever contacted with that Center the center of the universe you could create Earth this is what Einstein do anything that the power would be unlimited see he had seen that that's what Einstein see they begin to break open dimensions and discovered other dimensions you know the First Dimension first three light matter time which we live in fourth dimension is science Fifth Dimension region of the LW sixth Dimension region of the saved and we know seventh is where God lives prophecy God lives out there oh praise the Living God but we're connected we as a bride of Christ we are connected to the sixth and the seventh Dimension we heard from our the which dwelleth in the sixth and God dwelleth in the seventh oh praise the Living God but Einstein saw the natural part he kept splitting atoms he saw no end Einstein Des drive it is this Hebrews 11 for we understand that the words were framed by the word of God the different dimensions Einstein have that theory of relativity E equals mc² energy e is energy equals mc² m is m is matter C is [Music] light what do we have C this matter light are theophany amen energy is God they call it energy they call it a supernatural intelligence they call it energy but we know it is God the prophet say Einstein used the dark side of it so what is it matter mult multiplied times the speed of light squared 186,000 miles per second times 186,000 miles per second like magic equals anybody want to tell 596 billion miles per second times matter so the prophet said we will move he said we take billions of miles per second so billions billions that's what he said 596 billion miles per second now I can't comprehend that it's incomprehensible but that's how fast we a travel like a thought in a moment of Twinkle that word moment it means Adam aommy oh God we enter into something we entering in omnipotent powers of God hey man to shake the enemy so let us enter in by the blood of Jesus Christ we can live in that place we can live in that world of perfect Faith Hallelujah that's right we can coner sickness we can conquer all things in Christ we are possessing all things you believe that we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that's what we come we are we we have arrived so Einstein only had that part look what the prophet told us as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have see according to your faith being unto you as much faith will be released as much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen I'm talking about an absolute connected with Christ your thinking is altogether different than the thinking you once did because you have found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and the Earth that's his very word itself is created a God who spoke the world into existence and there's nothing to hard for him so it makes you create yourself because you take his word and the word is his thought expressed so in you you could create you believe that said the time coming where missing limbs will be restored say wait to those wait to those Thunders Ed voice of that little group this said Thunders you know the devil has put a scarecrow up about the seven Thunders but notice the seven Thunders is in Revelation 10 it's the bride's inheritance seven Thunders Thunder is the voice of God Seven means completion the seven Thunders is the word of the Lord revealed in its entirety so we're not afraid of the seventh Thunders it's the brid's Revival hey this what's going to produce rapt and faith in our hearts praise the Lord the prophet say shall it be something that'll cause us to run through troops and leap over walls is such a power that God is releasing un us that's what it is because he sent the quality of the word and the quality of the spirit that's why the fullness of the word had to be restored back so the fullness of the Holy Ghost could be loosed that was bound by Creeds and dogmas now you can ask whatever you will you can live in that omnipotent powers of God Amen praise the Living God you know it's time for us to recognize Who We Are that's what perfect faith is the prophet said knowing where you stand he said that's one of the curses people don't know where to stand I'm so glad it's the everpresent water from the rock it's Jesus Christ in action say when it utter its voice to that little group when the footage of the word being revealed to that little group she will slice she will cut she can call for a 100 billion flies if she want to she can create worlds if she want to and go live on she can speak her own world in existence and go live on in other words even in your life even in the circumstances and conditions you have the authority and power to change it whether it's on your job whether it's in your home whether it's among your family whether wherever it is you have the authority you can speak your own world in existence we're not talking about another world we're talking about those circumstances and conditions you don't have to live below your privilege I said you don't have to live below your privilege we've been living below our privilege too long it's time to rise up and claim our Jubilee claim our inheritance in christl that's what time it is the devil is a liar he's the father of Lies we're free you don't have to live in guilt and shame I said you don't have to live in guilt and shame you know Judas live in guilt and shame what did he end up doing committing suicide p pa lived in guilt and shame what did he end up doing committing suicide but Peter lived in guilt too and say when he denied the Lord three times but Grace came to Peter Hallelujah go tell my disciples and Peter Hallelujah that I'm risen that I'm here to deliver to set free amen tell them to meet with me in Galilee I meet you in that little room I meet you in that little room Hallelujah I'm not looking for the Tent Revival the T Revival is in me you're the Tent Revival the T Revival is the Bride of Jesus Christ the T Revival is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the T Rev you're the T Revival amen bless His holy name amen I get excited I get excited because what God is doing he's alive and well so we ought to T Revival I'm not looking for the prophet to raise from the dead and open the seven seal is already open Christ is here in the power of the Holy Ghost Christ is here in the footage of his word the Messiah is on earth now amen so ask what you will amen claim your Jubilee claim your freedom claim your inheritance because whom the son is set free is free indeed claim your loved ones claim your family all that you ever love and all that ever love you I've given them unto you that's not just for the prophet that's for every son and daughter of God heyen that's perfect Faith a rise and shine your light is here amen he's here to deliver he's here to set free whom the son is set free is free indeed this is our Jubilee amen demons are on the run I want to tell you demons are trimming demons are on the Run even now speak salvation for your loved ones speak healing for your loved ones the always now the third pull is on now the brid Revival is on now don't put off it's now stop putting off he's now speak forgiveness speak your world Amen speak your atmosphere in you is the power to create so create your atmosphere in your home on your job in your life in the church everywhere create the atmosphere and you watch God come on the scene and meet the needs for his people God loves you so you ask what you will it's the Holy Ghost on the scene Jesus Christ on the scene amen amen it's not just a a saying it's truth it's a reality some doubt some may doubt but is a reality the Holy Ghost is here to meet our [Music] name Prophet said on one casion one occasion he said I'm going speak according to the revelation of my faith he said I'm not going to even speak it in his name he had come to understanding see many times we may say you know brother brandham said this and brother brandham said that that's good but the prophet taught us himself he said it have to become a revelation to you he said when it becomes a revelation to you he said you can speak it Hallelujah and the prophet went on to say what happened to me on Sabino Canyon he said was like he said some said Don't Fear see that's the problem many times fear cause torment but perfect love he that fearth is not made perfect in love he come he said whatever you do get perfect love he said but what happened he said the inside of me spoke see that's where God chose to meet you that's the little room remember

a perfect Faith Build It Up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper in any two-edged sword the is ear of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order to rapture we have to come to perfect Faith that's why the seventh seal must be preached not just six se but the seven there was silence in heaven remember but on Earth there was noise and the Thunders was revealed amen that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that

mighty man rejoice in his might let not a rich man rejoice in his riches let him glory in this he understand the Lord he said all I get and get understanding get wisdom wisdom is the principle thing wisdom is Christ many seek for the Jews the Greek seeks after wisdom but to them that believe is Christ the wisdom and the power of God so wisdom is Christ but I pray that you'll give them such a crave for it Lord that they'll come and see we're at the end time the as age I pray father that they realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more rap in Grace so God is not trying to condemn us he want to give us more R in faith but the hour will come when when we'll have to have Rapture power not only to hear the body but to change it in a moment twink 11 ey Christ and that's where Einstein seen it as we said earlier in the na he saw his body speeding up the theophany blending in with this matter this redeemed body and transforming it to a glorified condition that's what Einstein see Christ will be so real in the in their bodies our bodies to he can change it by his great death and what he purchased may they take this today that token that I
