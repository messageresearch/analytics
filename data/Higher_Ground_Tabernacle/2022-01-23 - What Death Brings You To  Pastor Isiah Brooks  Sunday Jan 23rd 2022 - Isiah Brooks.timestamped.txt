[20:31] [Music]
[20:36] as i've heard our brother savannah and

[20:44] at least we know that the church is
[20:45] increasing
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] amen
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:56] and we thank god for those who traveled
[20:58] from iowa city we appreciate you coming
[21:00] up we're going to associate
[21:03] [Music]
[21:14] in the last few days i've
[21:17] had four close friends die don lee
[21:20] [Music]
[21:26] brother charlie spencer from virginia
[21:28] the franchise
[21:31] brother ross from lima ohio brother ross
[21:36] brother ramji from trinidad
[21:41] and of course charlie's sister-in-law
[21:45] uh
[21:46] would be her his uh
[21:49] daughter-in-law excuse me
[21:52] passed a few hours prior to his past
[21:58] and they were buried
[22:01] this week as well
[22:05] i don't know the calls for every one of
[22:08] their deaths
[22:28] [Music]
[22:36] the more i think about this message
[22:41] i appreciate the grace of god
[22:46] because every one of us will meet god
[22:50] at some point in time we're going to see
[22:52] him
[23:05] so as we stand
[23:08] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[23:10] to saint luc
[23:15] we're going to start reading uh
[23:17] the 16th chapter of saint luc
[23:31] one of the things that happens i was
[23:32] seeking the lord on a lot of things
[23:45] and he said my sheep were here with my
[23:47] voice
[24:15] shepherd of the lord
[24:36] so that was a real comfort to me
[24:39] and a strength to me
[24:42] because we're living in the last days
[24:46] satan is putting pressure on every hand
[24:51] and he's doing everything that he can do
[24:55] to overthrow the word
[24:58] for satan
[25:11] uh the 24th verse of that particular
[25:14] chapter
[25:20] and he cried and said father abraham
[25:24] have mercy on me
[25:26] and send lazarus that he
[25:28] may dip
[25:30] the tip of his finger in water
[25:33] and cool my tongue
[25:35] for i am tormented in this flame
[25:38] it's
[25:48] but abraham said
[25:50] son remember that thou in thy lifetime
[25:54] receiveth thy good things
[25:57] and likewise laughter is evil things
[26:00] but now he is comforted and thou art
[26:03] tormented
[26:08] equally
[26:17] between us and you
[26:19] there is a great golf fixed
[26:22] so that they which would pass from hence
[26:25] to you cannot
[26:27] neither can they pass to you
[26:29] and that would come from this
[26:36] suit
[26:40] and then he said i pray thee therefore
[26:43] father that thou withered send him to my
[26:46] father's house
[27:00] for i have
[27:01] brethren thy brethren
[27:03] that he may testify
[27:05] unto them
[27:07] lest they also come unto this place of
[27:10] torment
[27:15] thank you
[27:16] for
[27:20] and he said unto him
[27:22] if they hear not moses
[27:25] and the prophets
[27:27] neither will they be persuaded
[27:30] though one rose
[27:32] from the dead
[27:44] we ask once again that you turn with us
[27:46] the first john
[27:59] through the 16th verse season you'll see
[28:07] for
[28:08] see we we know
[28:10] that we have passed from death unto life
[28:14] because we love the brethren
[28:16] he that loveth not his brother
[28:19] abideth in death
[28:28] who hated whosoever hated his brother is
[28:31] a murderer
[28:33] and ye know that no murderer has eternal
[28:36] life abiding in him
[28:45] hereby perceive we the love of god
[28:49] because he laid down his life for us
[28:52] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[28:55] the brethren
[28:59] [Music]
[29:07] we ask that you turn with us to
[29:26] and we're going to read the 21st verse
[29:30] [Music]
[29:34] that as sin has reigned unto death
[29:39] even so my grace reigned through
[29:41] righteousness unto eternal life
[29:45] by jesus christ our lord afraid
[29:49] [Music]
[29:51] of
[30:06] you have
[30:13] [Music]
[30:20] but i say these things because they are
[30:22] true
[30:24] and i pray lord god this morning
[30:27] that somehow
[30:30] you would reach the inner core
[30:34] of your
[30:48] that holy place that place
[30:50] that you have designated
[30:54] to be your throne
[30:56] oh god have mercy upon our souls
[31:00] we come before you lord
[31:29] uh i thank god for those of you who were
[31:31] praying for them
[31:34] and praying for me as well
[31:37] i came to bring this message this
[31:38] morning
[31:41] because i realized the
[31:45] way we all live
[31:49] even the way we think
[31:52] sometimes we
[31:54] fail to really realize
[31:58] the importance of importance of living a
[32:01] holy and sanctified life the vivo in the
[32:04] center
[32:05] many of us being that we confess the
[32:08] message
[32:11] but the message if it's not quickened to
[32:13] you
[32:15] is a dead letter
[32:18] because the message is not something uh
[32:21] tangible
[32:23] it's not stuff
[32:25] written on pages about the shows
[32:32] it is christ himself she pleased to
[32:34] remember and you can understand the
[32:36] message
[32:38] by way of an intellectual concept
[32:42] intellectual even as paul said you can
[32:44] understand all mysteries
[32:48] and have not charities
[32:50] it profits you nothing
[32:54] i was telling a friend of mine the other
[32:56] day
[32:58] i said this is not the season
[33:01] to fight
[33:03] it's not the season to fuss
[33:06] all of these things the devil brings to
[33:08] distract you
[33:12] but we must understand
[33:14] that we this is a time
[33:17] to focus
[33:20] on the coming of the lord
[33:35] brother branham tells us
[33:40] [Music]
[33:49] and oftentimes that quote
[34:16] and when god accepts you you're going to
[34:18] he seals
[34:26] this morning
[34:28] what
[34:29] will death
[34:31] bring to you jesus
[34:46] i read about the rich young ruler
[34:50] and this man once was a real christian
[34:55] but he allowed his riches
[34:59] to get in his way
[35:02] to social media hallelujah he lost focus
[35:08] on his purpose for being here
[35:11] objective
[35:13] you see and because he lost his focus
[35:17] he did not have the compassion
[35:21] and love
[35:22] for his brethren
[35:25] that he should have had
[35:28] but god gave him a second chance
[35:32] when he turned god away
[35:35] when the lord said unto him
[35:38] follow me
[35:39] more sell all that you have
[35:42] give your riches to the poor with me and
[35:44] follow me
[35:46] hallelujah
[35:47] it was at that point
[35:50] he made a decision
[35:52] that will
[35:53] affect him
[35:56] until
[36:15] [Music]
[36:24] lazarus
[36:26] because jesus had already preached the
[36:28] message
[36:30] if you give one of these little ones
[36:33] a drink of water
[36:36] you shall be rewarded
[36:50] god will give them eternal life
[37:02] jesus
[37:03] said to him jesus
[37:05] have you done this
[37:08] have you done that
[37:09] as a church member
[37:12] he was great he didn't love you he had
[37:14] done everything
[37:17] basically the law
[37:18] required
[37:48] you see god doesn't give you riches
[37:54] but those riches are given to you
[37:59] amen
[38:00] hallelujah
[38:01] now sometimes we're poor if you find
[38:03] some povo just as poor as that with a
[38:06] woman
[38:08] that came to the offering table
[38:12] and gave her two mites
[38:15] to do since and jesus said is his
[38:17] reality she has given more can ever
[38:21] than anybody in the church service
[38:26] there were wealthy men there yeah
[38:29] wealthy men there
[38:45] [Music]
[38:59] how are you going to pay your rent come
[39:00] on what should be where your food is
[39:01] going to come from
[39:04] all those things that satan
[39:06] normally brings to our minds
[39:09] to hinder us
[39:11] from doing the will of god
[39:16] see wherever your heart is
[39:20] that's where your treasures will be
[39:26] when my friends
[39:27] passed away it was me into the city and
[39:30] the thing that i thought about
[39:33] okay
[39:34] was
[39:35] today which way did they go
[39:39] catch your mountain when death struck
[39:41] they
[39:42] came to their door door lost
[39:45] which way did they go yes
[39:48] i don't know your heart
[39:50] i don't know their hearts
[39:52] all i know is that i hope
[39:54] by god's grace
[40:00] no doubt this rich man
[40:02] remain religious
[40:07] he found himself in a place
[40:11] that he thought he would not
[40:16] and being that he was the sixth
[40:19] son
[40:22] and he had
[40:23] he said
[40:24] brother said even when god called him
[40:27] he called him to be an evangelist
[40:31] you understand me he had a gift of
[40:33] evangelism
[40:36] and no
[40:51] amen you're going to have to answer
[40:55] every gift that god give has given unto
[40:57] you
[40:59] hallelujah now those are not my words
[41:01] it's just
[41:02] those are the words of brother branson
[41:46] we are going
[41:48] to take something with us
[41:50] i'm making sure
[41:52] what that something is it's a question
[41:55] it's all we can take with us
[41:59] nothing less
[42:27] now what kind of character
[42:30] will you take with you
[42:34] will it be
[42:36] like this
[42:37] uh
[42:38] the whole his whole character
[42:43] let me read that again will it be like
[42:44] his whole character
[42:47] was molded by suffering
[42:50] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[42:53] oh will it be softness
[43:02] [Music]
[43:09] every man will bear
[43:17] even as the prophet has said remember i
[43:20] really want you to think
[43:22] because personally i am tired
[43:36] get you there
[43:51] god knows i'm fighting against that
[43:53] system
[43:54] i don't care if you say brother brooks
[43:56] is in the message
[43:57] or brother is not in the message
[44:00] because you don't know where i am
[44:02] but i can tell you where i am
[44:04] i'm in christ
[44:07] hallelujah
[44:09] listen is that right
[44:11] paul had a message for you but paul's
[44:14] message was christ
[44:16] william branham had a message
[44:18] but his message was christ
[44:32] because we
[44:33] have been in different churches
[44:37] under certain ministries and the army is
[44:40] there we feel like we're all right
[44:43] something some correct but look at all
[44:45] the men all of the people man
[44:47] who followed moses
[45:16] joshua
[45:43] whatever you are when
[45:58] is not in you you are not in the message
[46:03] amen now i'm going to tell you the truth
[46:06] because none of us want to die
[46:40] because i know this message came from
[46:42] god
[46:43] and i don't know what the what's his
[46:45] next movie
[46:46] but you need to know
[46:49] and examine yourself this morning
[46:52] to make sure that you are in the faith
[47:02] the bread behind this is the bread that
[47:04] was behind the veil
[47:08] you understand me excuse me
[47:10] so let's move on i don't have one song
[47:12] if you are a doubter
[47:15] you'll be raised a doubter
[47:17] if you die
[47:22] however the tree falls when it lays
[47:26] that's what it is
[47:29] hallelujah
[47:31] oh i can hear some of your thinking but
[47:32] that's okay
[47:35] reflections
[47:37] the reflection you know reflection is
[47:39] something that
[47:41] uh we know about reflection
[47:44] when i was a boy we play with the mirror
[47:49] sunlight hit the mirror and then we'll
[47:51] throw a reflection
[47:54] hallelujah
[47:56] it's kind of like a shadow
[47:58] how can i say it it's like remember some
[48:00] of y'all don't know what i'm talking
[48:01] about
[48:03] in my day
[48:17] in order to develop that uh negative
[48:20] into the real picture
[48:23] so it would be defined
[48:26] whatever more
[48:28] you had to take it into a dark room
[48:37] and you had to put it in this this
[48:40] negative it would be functioning you
[48:41] have to
[48:42] put it in these chemicals
[48:45] and these chemicals of
[48:59] now we are the
[49:14] and right now we're in what we call the
[49:17] dark room
[49:20] and those chemicals of death amen will
[49:23] develop you
[49:25] hallelujah this will show who you are
[49:54] and we have the pictures as evidence it
[49:56] is
[50:11] don't like her
[50:12] you understand me amen
[50:18] you take
[50:21] people who use the talents
[50:38] can live any kind of way now
[50:41] and then we die god is going to do one
[50:43] of these snap your fingers
[50:46] make us rich
[50:48] or make us holy spell the new sound no
[50:50] no no no it doesn't work that way
[51:07] oh i've got the holy ghost oh
[51:09] because i come to church
[51:11] because i pay my taxes you pay me
[51:13] because i pay my offer because you pay
[51:15] me
[51:16] doesn't mean one thing
[51:18] you can do all of that
[51:20] and still not
[51:23] [Music]
[51:33] put a finger on my life
[51:37] but when he met that pillow
[51:40] called himself
[51:42] had to receive the holy ghost
[51:46] don't you let nobody talk you
[52:03] that's what determines it
[52:05] have you been changed
[52:08] the bible said you changed from death
[52:09] and to life
[52:11] the bible says you become a new creature
[52:14] and the old things are passed away
[52:30] um
[52:42] is that right
[52:43] you can't be good and evil at the same
[52:46] time
[52:47] jesus said make the tree good jesus
[52:50] or make it evil
[52:52] we're not living in a time
[52:55] where god is accepting would you accept
[52:58] her
[52:58] the tree of good and evil
[53:02] you understand me
[53:03] you got to be good
[53:05] oh you got to be evil
[53:06] and there's only one good and that
[53:08] concern that's god
[53:10] [Music]
[53:13] amen
[53:16] take for example
[53:19] horizontal
[53:20] when a baby is born again this can be
[53:23] living
[53:24] it takes a spanking it's full in
[53:40] now they come out almost with
[53:41] calculators
[53:44] they already know how to cry
[53:47] you don't speak them you don't have to
[53:48] they come out screaming
[53:51] and then i just believe by god's grace
[53:54] that's how it is with
[54:21] or you would go somewhere else
[54:25] your brother adam says
[54:27] from darius and divine healing if you
[54:29] know the jerusalem message 54.
[54:32] let me tell you what you are here
[54:35] scrutin is a reflection
[54:38] [Music]
[54:48] already in the presence of the father
[54:52] we have a glorified body
[54:57] wasn't that deep
[55:00] all right so we'll find out
[55:03] whether it's right or
[55:10] [Music]
[55:18] so right now meant to know and what we
[55:21] are there
[55:22] is a reflection
[55:24] here
[55:26] what we are here
[55:28] is a reflection of what we are somewhere
[55:31] else
[55:46] if your ds
[55:53] [Music]
[56:01] would you rather me say
[56:03] a lie to you
[56:05] this must be something you must consider
[56:09] and understand
[56:10] because you say you in the message does
[56:13] not
[56:14] guarantee
[56:22] and you must have come from god in order
[56:25] to go back to god and the only way
[56:27] you'll know you came from god it's when
[56:30] god seals your history and gives you his
[56:33] approval
[56:37] shame on us
[56:39] i know it's cold outside the 65th water
[56:42] bring that atmosphere in the church
[56:44] we bring our attitudes in the church
[56:47] and i'm going to tell you this this
[56:48] morning god has re
[56:50] has on his own camera caught your
[56:53] attitude
[56:54] and and and the way you behave when it
[56:57] comes to worshiping god
[56:59] hallelujah you say you in the message
[57:02] live like you in the message
[57:04] rejoice like you in the message
[57:06] act like you in the masses
[57:09] i don't serve a dead god i can't stand
[57:12] it
[57:13] i can't stand it
[57:14] now if you want to make me angry is when
[57:16] you come in here
[57:19] like my god is a methodist or a catholic
[57:22] son
[57:24] he's the
[57:32] [Music]
[57:39] [Music]
[57:45] you supposed to give him sacrifice
[58:04] what kind of place you you're in
[58:23] [Music]
[58:31] amen
[58:33] hallelujah
[58:36] let me move on this morning
[58:39] like i said this life is a negative
[58:42] negative and it's got to be
[58:47] developed
[58:48] is
[59:06] if something in you is not groaning for
[59:09] perfection
[59:12] there is something wrong with your
[59:14] experience
[59:28] [Music]
[59:45] comes
[59:46] but i gotta have it
[59:53] kind of remind me of the woman when she
[59:55] went down to
[59:56] simon's house
[1:00:21] uh she heard that jesus was at simon's
[1:00:24] house
[1:00:26] and she
[1:00:40] and she did not stop
[1:00:42] until she fell at the feet of jesus
[1:00:46] you understand me
[1:00:48] i don't care about opposition
[1:00:51] they make me stronger
[1:00:53] they make me a
[1:00:54] fighter not for me but for the kingdom
[1:00:57] of god
[1:00:58] hallelujah
[1:00:59] what difference does it make
[1:01:02] hallelujah if somebody doesn't like you
[1:01:05] what different does it make if you want
[1:01:07] what you must go through
[1:01:21] it's going to be a family affair
[1:01:24] hallelujah but you must make up in your
[1:01:27] mind
[1:01:28] that you're going to see jesus
[1:01:31] that's why i sing that song when i die
[1:01:34] let me rise
[1:01:36] and when i rise let me see jesus
[1:01:39] i don't care about nobody else
[1:01:44] hallelujah
[1:01:46] so many people
[1:01:52] i'm gonna say it because we think
[1:01:55] calling on the name of william branham
[1:02:01] and the bible says
[1:02:03] there is no salvation yeah but
[1:02:06] any other on the other there is no other
[1:02:08] name
[1:02:10] in heaven
[1:02:12] that we must be saved
[1:02:14] but foreign
[1:02:18] he said oh i call on the name of brother
[1:02:21] there's nothing wrong with that yeah
[1:02:23] but that's not your salvation
[1:02:26] brother branham is not christ
[1:02:28] hallelujah
[1:02:30] he was anointed by christ
[1:02:32] he had christ
[1:02:47] and jesus said this is ready i'm not the
[1:02:49] one that's doing the work
[1:02:52] it's him that's doing the work
[1:02:55] and when i see him doing the work
[1:02:57] then i go forth and do them
[1:03:00] hallelujah did not william branham do
[1:03:02] the same
[1:03:04] he said i'm waiting on him
[1:03:06] hallelujah and when he would come he
[1:03:09] lost
[1:03:10] when he would reveal what was in the
[1:03:12] hearts of the people not the man
[1:03:27] the bride of jesus christ the positions
[1:03:29] of priests will never be satisfied
[1:03:32] by satisfaction with satan's eden amen
[1:03:37] amen hallelujah
[1:03:40] see we long for perfection
[1:03:56] hallelujah
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:25] the only thing that makes it la
[1:04:27] is that character okay it's in you
[1:04:30] that have been formed
[1:04:35] through the fiery trials
[1:04:37] that you and i have gone we are going
[1:04:39] through
[1:04:41] hallelujah
[1:04:43] [Laughter]
[1:04:45] you love the lord
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:48] what would that bring to you
[1:04:51] was not the rich young ruler
[1:05:05] no doubt he thought because he was
[1:05:07] blessed in a financial way
[1:05:11] that was on his side
[1:05:14] but great gain is not godliness
[1:05:16] the girl
[1:05:18] great gain or the gun is not godliness
[1:06:02] uh
[1:06:17] a short season
[1:06:19] because
[1:06:21] shortly after that
[1:06:24] he was in his own home
[1:06:28] and god came again
[1:06:42] god allowed him to return
[1:06:57] came back and visited him
[1:07:00] when she was already gone
[1:07:03] crossing over
[1:07:05] she said oh brother bill that's you
[1:07:07] you can't imagine what it's like
[1:07:10] hallelujah amen she said is is this it's
[1:07:14] beautiful more beautiful than i'm
[1:07:15] paraphrasing than you can imagine she
[1:07:17] said
[1:07:18] hallelujah
[1:07:19] but you've been preaching this
[1:07:21] but you have no idea what it is
[1:07:26] she
[1:07:38] and we should have ignored mama on the v
[1:07:40] i
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:56] that same kind of holy ghost filled fire
[1:08:00] baptized people remember hallelujah the
[1:08:04] same screaming
[1:08:06] hollowing jumping running power of god
[1:08:09] that struck the people that's what they
[1:08:12] call trash
[1:08:14] hallelujah but those were god's kind of
[1:08:17] people
[1:08:19] and if it was that time yesterday it's
[1:08:22] that kind this
[1:08:36] heresy
[1:08:38] the way they call crazy
[1:08:41] even your prophet
[1:08:43] said you ought to get out of order long
[1:08:45] enough
[1:08:47] to get the holy ghost
[1:09:18] justification
[1:09:19] you can't baptize sanctification
[1:09:22] you can't pass the baptism of the holy
[1:09:24] ghost and expect to come into the
[1:09:25] capstone ministry
[1:09:30] it will not work
[1:09:32] and it is the
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:59] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:10:55] um
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:26] oh my you love the lord
[1:11:28] revelations
[1:11:33] if you should die today
[1:11:40] would be your result
[1:11:43] think about it
[1:11:45] you're gambling with your soul
[1:11:48] for him to do it
[1:11:49] to him who to know to do good
[1:11:55] to him
[1:11:59] this is something that we shouldn't even
[1:12:03] have to be concerned about
[1:12:06] because
[1:12:18] revelations 2 apocalypses
[1:12:24] this is not a political
[1:12:26] move
[1:12:28] i'm trying to help this morning she said
[1:12:30] did this
[1:12:35] and i trust that god would help us
[1:12:41] i came up you know
[1:12:45] my mother
[1:12:46] raised me baptist
[1:12:47] my mama
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:13:01] i left the catholic church went back to
[1:13:03] the methodist church
[1:13:06] from the messenger church i went to the
[1:13:07] apostolic church
[1:13:09] and that's the jesus that's the jesus
[1:13:11] only folks it's only john
[1:13:14] jesus only mentioned
[1:13:16] classified as
[1:13:25] you know what
[1:13:26] i couldn't shout in the catholic church
[1:13:31] and in the methodist church i was too
[1:13:33] fanatical it only did
[1:13:35] fantastic then i went to the apostolic
[1:13:37] church where all the shouting's supposed
[1:13:38] to be going on like this
[1:13:42] you know what they told me
[1:13:56] you see how ridiculous
[1:14:12] you're shaming me
[1:14:14] oh you don't have to you carry on like
[1:14:16] that
[1:14:18] hallelujah
[1:14:19] and it's that same attitude in the
[1:14:21] message that's what i mean my teacher
[1:14:22] you don't mean they don't care if the
[1:14:24] method is coming
[1:14:26] they don't care
[1:14:41] in this message
[1:14:43] find themselves in hell
[1:14:46] because they have blasphemed the holy
[1:14:48] ghost
[1:14:49] by speaking of it like it's some evil
[1:14:52] unclean spirit
[1:15:01] somebody didn't like that one but it's
[1:15:02] okay
[1:15:04] because i feel like a lot of people have
[1:15:06] been bewitched
[1:15:08] a spell
[1:15:20] y'all don't know what a spell is nope
[1:15:52] in her full potential
[1:15:55] that means signs and wonders
[1:15:57] miracles and everything else that comes
[1:15:59] with it
[1:16:00] hallelujah not only that but you'll see
[1:16:02] her in her life
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:31] now i know i'm going a little longer
[1:16:32] than i intended just section
[1:16:35] but i want you to understand you must
[1:16:36] understand your influence
[1:16:39] i listen to brother branham's table
[1:16:40] almost every day
[1:16:43] every day
[1:16:45] and the anointing that comes off of
[1:16:47] those tapes
[1:16:49] it's greater
[1:16:51] than the anointing
[1:16:53] i feel in most churches
[1:16:57] what's wrong with that
[1:16:59] have you ever seen brother branham
[1:17:02] rebuke the anointing
[1:17:05] absolutely he always gave reverence
[1:17:08] absolutely an honor to the anointing
[1:17:12] hallelujah
[1:17:13] and then we get into the church
[1:17:16] and when the holy ghost fall
[1:17:19] some of us are afraid
[1:17:22] to enter into that presence
[1:17:24] because we wonder
[1:17:26] what others will think about us
[1:17:29] and let me tell you something listen
[1:17:31] you need a real experience
[1:17:36] there is no way
[1:17:38] i will be ashamed of my lord
[1:17:42] my
[1:17:49] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:17:51] what i'm trying to say is this you just
[1:17:53] said the same brass serpent lumens
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:11] and then god had to tear the image down
[1:18:15] hallelujah it was christ
[1:18:18] it has always been the lord
[1:18:21] it has always been the anointing
[1:18:24] that destroys
[1:18:38] none
[1:18:51] because i'm a preacher doesn't guarantee
[1:18:53] me
[1:18:55] a place in heaven
[1:18:56] because there's a lot of preachers
[1:18:59] they are now running
[1:19:01] the foot race in hell
[1:19:04] because they've deceived the people
[1:19:13] amen hallelujah you might as well sit
[1:19:15] here and enjoy yo
[1:19:18] and repent
[1:19:20] whatever you need to do
[1:19:22] hallelujah amen
[1:19:24] because you see this message i know came
[1:19:27] from god
[1:19:31] hallelujah
[1:19:32] and some of us we get to the place we're
[1:19:34] so stubborn
[1:19:35] and we don't even know that they're
[1:19:36] stubborn it's like like witchcraft
[1:19:41] you come into this church with your
[1:19:42] attitude
[1:19:44] and you think that you're going to shut
[1:19:45] down hallelujah you think you're going
[1:19:47] to shut down the holy ghost but the holy
[1:19:49] ghost can't be shut down
[1:19:51] not in me
[1:19:53] if he was just in the building you have
[1:19:55] to control that but when he's in me
[1:19:58] and when he's in other people you cannot
[1:20:01] control the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[1:20:04] a free spirit listen
[1:20:06] to this it is god let me tell y'all
[1:20:08] people listen those of us who love to
[1:20:11] rejoice those of you who love to scream
[1:20:13] and holler for the name of jesus don't
[1:20:15] let nobody
[1:20:39] and it's building character in me
[1:20:42] and taking away all fears
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:55] i'm gonna go back to ezekiel you don't
[1:20:57] have to turn there
[1:21:06] everyone that uses this proverb
[1:21:09] against against thee saying
[1:21:12] as is the mother
[1:21:14] so is her daughter
[1:21:20] hallelujah
[1:21:22] you understand me
[1:21:24] and the mother was a head tight
[1:21:53] and
[1:21:54] one that is broken and one who is is is
[1:21:57] wrapped in fears
[1:22:01] i may not make the rapture
[1:22:04] god is not going to answer my prayers
[1:22:06] just all kinds of stuff dude
[1:22:21] it also means to be a troublemaker
[1:22:24] because
[1:22:25] you find the rebels
[1:22:27] you find people that the least little
[1:22:28] thing they get bitter
[1:22:30] and you know what they're going to do
[1:22:31] they're going to babble
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:37] yeah that's the truth
[1:22:41] no a cans will be there
[1:22:47] these kind of people won't be there
[1:22:50] remember
[1:22:58] but they thought moses you're not the
[1:23:00] only holy man
[1:23:03] there's only one message
[1:23:09] so we give honor to our prophet william
[1:23:11] brandon
[1:23:13] but let me tell you something
[1:23:16] calling on his name um
[1:23:32] um but he said the witches
[1:23:37] had the chair suspended in the air
[1:23:41] and he said in the name of father son
[1:23:43] and holy ghost
[1:23:44] because they challenged him
[1:24:12] and he says
[1:24:13] in the name of the father son and the
[1:24:14] holy ghost
[1:24:17] nothing happened
[1:24:19] he said in the name of william
[1:24:24] nothing happened
[1:24:26] but when he said in the name of the lord
[1:24:28] jesus christ he said the chairs dropped
[1:24:31] so hard
[1:24:32] it almost broke every leg off of him
[1:24:37] the power was in the name of jesus
[1:24:38] christ
[1:24:39] i don't know you're going to marry i'm
[1:24:41] going to marry jesus christ
[1:24:45] y'all understand me there's only one
[1:24:47] husband
[1:24:48] there's only one handshape and that
[1:24:50] hardship is my lord jesus christ
[1:24:55] you say we're not like that oh
[1:24:58] yes we are
[1:25:00] or we will do something
[1:25:01] we may not call them popes and bishops
[1:25:06] but still let them lord over us
[1:25:10] and
[1:25:21] the holy ghost is supposed to be your
[1:25:23] lord
[1:25:24] somebody
[1:25:37] those preachers out there
[1:25:40] they're having these great mega churches
[1:25:43] they're riding in these fine
[1:25:46] cars
[1:25:47] and having these five houses
[1:25:51] and we're doing the same thing
[1:25:55] like the mother
[1:25:57] so is the daughters
[1:26:01] amen i don't care whether you like it
[1:26:03] i'm preaching
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:32] there is nothing that you could offer me
[1:26:35] to make me change my way of preaching
[1:26:37] fulfillment
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:43] amen i came to iowa with god jesus
[1:26:47] jesus
[1:27:03] think about it
[1:27:04] you say oh brother books what are you
[1:27:06] saying
[1:27:09] and i know how some of y'all gonna take
[1:27:11] this message you're gonna take it so
[1:27:13] like i'm picking on somebody
[1:27:31] nobody talk to me that's only about god
[1:27:33] himself it's a true remember
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:38] think about it
[1:27:39] the thief
[1:27:42] in luke 23
[1:27:45] the one that was on the cross
[1:27:48] see that's how it begins you see
[1:27:52] the difference between the the
[1:27:55] the two thieves
[1:27:57] is that one had representation
[1:28:02] they both were thieves
[1:28:05] they both had bad records
[1:28:08] but on the inside of the inside
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:40] when you enter into your kingdom
[1:28:43] have mercy on me
[1:28:45] i won
[1:28:47] when that thing saw them put that
[1:28:50] heading
[1:28:54] above their
[1:29:08] that means he's
[1:29:09] you
[1:29:11] because i am a jew
[1:29:14] and he says lord
[1:29:16] when you enter into your kingdom see he
[1:29:18] believed the sign
[1:29:20] that what the romans put over his head
[1:29:24] what's the truth identity of this word
[1:29:27] hallelujah when you enter into your
[1:29:29] kingdom
[1:29:30] lord remember me have mercy on me and
[1:29:34] jesus said this day
[1:29:36] because you believe it
[1:29:38] you see believing william branham is a
[1:29:41] problem you got to understand what's
[1:29:43] behind where you're brandon
[1:29:45] it wasn't a man
[1:29:47] it was the almighty god and when you can
[1:29:50] see god behind the man
[1:29:52] and truly believe the message
[1:29:55] will transform you
[1:29:58] amen
[1:30:00] hallelujah
[1:30:02] it'll transform you
[1:30:04] you
[1:30:17] but i find it very hard
[1:30:22] to preach the people the precision and
[1:30:25] they look like they're dead
[1:30:30] no matter what you say
[1:30:32] they just got that dead look
[1:30:34] he's also a god more hallelujah
[1:30:38] no smiles
[1:30:40] sometimes you want to i want to just
[1:30:42] walk down there and flip your eyes back
[1:30:44] the pressure is
[1:30:48] like what in the world
[1:30:52] that's what brother brown said to the
[1:30:53] brandon kaplan
[1:30:54] do what i've done it's become too common
[1:30:59] it's too
[1:31:00] common is that betrayal
[1:31:02] like i was telling you
[1:31:04] i'ma tell you all too
[1:31:06] if i was to play a tape here this is a
[1:31:09] visual
[1:31:10] he playing the tape
[1:31:12] he's playing the table
[1:31:14] i ain't
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:42] you
[1:31:56] you don't have no place to go
[1:31:58] and if it be a baptist church
[1:32:00] and all you know you can get is one
[1:32:02] slice
[1:32:03] you say go get the slides
[1:32:06] how can you justify it
[1:32:08] that brother ain't deep enough he is
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:23] something's wrong with your experiences
[1:32:26] there are churches you say well
[1:32:28] there are churches that play the tapes
[1:32:30] and that's all they play
[1:32:32] and they don't have a life you know
[1:32:35] now how would you know that
[1:32:39] you got a church what's up everything
[1:32:41] they got a preacher
[1:32:43] so how was your life
[1:32:48] amen
[1:32:50] amen she had always come back
[1:32:55] i'm almost done
[1:32:57] some of y'all gonna be glad too i know
[1:33:03] lord of god ain't got good
[1:33:08] i want you to realize this morning i i'm
[1:33:11] saying this and i'm preaching out of
[1:33:12] love i'm preaching out of concern
[1:33:13] because
[1:33:14] right now i could drop dead that's
[1:33:16] coming
[1:33:17] right now
[1:33:19] and if it was to happen i know which way
[1:33:21] i'm going just sit right here
[1:33:23] amen you say brother books have you done
[1:33:25] everything right
[1:33:28] y'all waiting for the answer

[1:33:34] but i've been doing my best
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:39] pressing into
[1:33:41] the holiness and the righteousness
[1:33:46] every day how many are fighting
[1:33:48] if you don't
[1:34:00] right against wrong
[1:34:19] hallelujah maybe a little cake but
[1:34:23] but y'all know what i mean
[1:34:26] he takes those things that he know
[1:34:29] that you have a a pool
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:34:38] but you can never let the devil
[1:34:41] make you think
[1:34:43] he has more power
[1:34:58] let me read this is what you also see
[1:35:01] coming from go tell my disciples
[1:35:05] that would be paragraph 282.
[1:35:09] listen to what brother branham says it's
[1:35:10] disconformity and many of us my friends
[1:35:15] have missed the mark on monkey
[1:35:18] calling in christ
[1:35:21] it's because we didn't recognize
[1:35:24] many times
[1:35:26] at the judgment don't
[1:35:54] i'm
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:03] yes
[1:36:04] you do you definitely don't appreciate
[1:36:06] me being here because you don't show
[1:36:08] that
[1:36:19] oh boy
[1:36:25] let me read this when you realize
[1:36:27] that religion of jesus christ
[1:36:30] brings salvation
[1:36:32] and happiness
[1:36:36] which is called as paul said
[1:36:39] in the days of oh
[1:36:42] in the way that's called heresy
[1:36:46] heresy is crazy you know
[1:36:49] in the way that's called heresy
[1:37:04] what's crazy
[1:37:08] you can find this on a college campus
[1:37:18] oh i'm just listening oh
[1:37:21] i'm making sure he don't err
[1:37:26] discerning my spirit
[1:37:29] the holy ghost will have come and gone
[1:37:42] see we don't worship like that no more
[1:37:44] they say
[1:37:46] you don't know nothing about a tree
[1:37:49] tell me something
[1:37:51] whether it be apple tree
[1:37:52] whether it be orange trees
[1:37:54] whatever kind of tree it is
[1:37:56] apples when that spring time comes
[1:37:59] and those leaves comes on those trees
[1:38:02] and that wind begins to blow
[1:38:05] it doesn't matter how old the tree is
[1:38:08] those leaves clap their hands
[1:38:11] they're going to worship god
[1:38:14] when the bride of jesus christ
[1:38:17] stops worshiping god
[1:38:19] she is not the bride
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:24] we don't act like the pentecostal well
[1:38:26] they have fanaticism
[1:38:28] and their fanaticism is emotion
[1:38:33] and this so-called bride fanaticism
[1:38:39] fanaticism is no emotion
[1:38:56] god
[1:39:10] brother
[1:39:37] because i get into the message
[1:39:45] don't get me wrong
[1:39:47] everybody
[1:39:49] that god has blessed to have great
[1:39:50] churches should we could you have been
[1:39:52] here
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:25] come on somebody
[1:40:26] where the pastors can't sit down with
[1:40:28] the with the with the congregation
[1:40:32] brother took his people out to eat and
[1:40:34] sit at the same table
[1:40:39] in the apostolic church
[1:40:42] the preachers and the deacons had a
[1:40:44] certain section
[1:40:47] and the rest of the congregation had a
[1:40:48] certain secret
[1:40:58] maybe i exaggerated a little bit but my
[1:41:04] uh my point is there was a noticeable
[1:41:06] difference
[1:41:08] even then i thought that was hypocrisy
[1:41:12] and i find it hypocrisy today
[1:41:18] don't tell me ain't real and i'm almost
[1:41:20] done
[1:41:21] right because i had some visitors in my
[1:41:24] house
[1:41:26] or whatever where they were
[1:41:28] and they got mad at me because i was
[1:41:30] helping my wife wash the dishes
[1:41:32] don't come to my house
[1:41:35] you might find me helping my wife
[1:41:38] wash dishes
[1:41:40] or give me a call happily more and ask
[1:41:42] have you washed the dishes yet who was
[1:41:47] shame on you
[1:41:50] my prophet helped
[1:41:51] his wife wash dishes
[1:42:00] man
[1:42:00] washing dish is going to make you a girl
[1:42:03] fella said that
[1:42:05] that's true don't ask her to help you
[1:42:07] work then
[1:42:13] really her place is at home
[1:42:16] don't send her out there you can't help
[1:42:17] her wash dishes
[1:42:20] i'm stepping on somebody's toes
[1:42:22] yes sir
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:25] that's nonsense
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:38] traditional whatever but anyhow
[1:42:45] i don't wash dishes every day
[1:42:47] but when i see my wife struggling
[1:42:51] and she's tired
[1:42:53] i'm going to help her do something
[1:43:10] and i'm saying go fix me some food
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] don't tell me y'all don't do it y'all do
[1:43:16] it
[1:43:19] you get mad when that food ain't ready
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:34] the bible said love your wife as christ
[1:43:36] loved the church
[1:43:38] hallelujah
[1:43:40] and that's beyond traditions
[1:43:43] i don't care what somebody else says
[1:43:46] no man no woman
[1:43:48] is going to come into my house and
[1:44:04] you don't want to miss it
[1:44:06] amen
[1:44:07] amen said you did everything
[1:44:10] right
[1:44:12] but you just wouldn't help your wife
[1:44:14] i did a farm
[1:44:20] i'm sorry maybe i i'm leaning too too
[1:44:22] much on that side but this is where they
[1:44:24] put that i just that's a good thing
[1:44:27] i feel um anyway let's move on
[1:44:30] i don't want to say it i know i don't
[1:44:32] you know let me let me go on let me go
[1:44:34] on i'm almost done i'm almost done oh
[1:44:37] give me grace
[1:44:41] see they they don't understand
[1:44:44] the holy ghost works only by him by his
[1:44:46] laws
[1:44:50] it was against
[1:44:51] the law
[1:44:53] for jesus to talk with the ill-fated
[1:44:55] woman
[1:44:58] and he stood there with her
[1:45:15] to speak to my kind of people
[1:45:19] first all about samaritan
[1:45:22] and then you know what kind of work i do
[1:45:26] jesus wasn't looking at the outward
[1:45:38] go get your husband
[1:45:40] a porto marie
[1:45:44] see what we don't understand is we must
[1:45:46] be new creatures
[1:45:49] you can't bring that old stuff in and
[1:45:51] expect to reach 100.
[1:45:54] whatever you mean
[1:45:57] the holy ghost will convict you
[1:46:00] if it's wrong he will convict you
[1:46:04] he'll come to your mind he will come to
[1:46:06] you he'll come into your heart
[1:46:08] the real holy ghost is not going to
[1:46:10] absolutely
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:39] deeper situation
[1:46:43] and say oh she didn't mean that oh
[1:46:46] he didn't mean that oh you feel bad
[1:46:50] elementary but it's true
[1:47:34] you know at the back side of the desert
[1:47:37] i always think about that phrase on the
[1:47:39] back side of the desert
[1:47:42] that means you got to travel through the
[1:47:43] desert specifically to get to the back
[1:47:45] side
[1:47:46] you got to come through some hardships
[1:47:49] in order to get there
[1:47:51] but when you get there you may you need
[1:47:53] him
[1:47:55] he said one writer said
[1:47:58] that the only thing that god had did to
[1:48:00] death
[1:48:16] and the only thing death
[1:48:18] shows can do is pull a believer
[1:48:22] into the presence of his maker
[1:48:26] the only thing amen let me tell you
[1:48:28] something this one with your truth
[1:48:31] you don't even know what joy is
[1:48:32] persevering
[1:48:34] until the word can give you joy
[1:48:38] that joy is far beyond anything satan
[1:48:41] says
[1:49:39] into the presence of god or it's going
[1:49:42] to take you
[1:49:43] somewhere you don't want to go
[1:49:47] as i said in in the early part of my
[1:49:49] ministry
[1:49:52] that doesn't change
[1:50:04] and as i read that first quote
[1:50:07] wherever you whatever you're doing in
[1:50:09] this life
[1:50:11] is declaring
[1:50:13] where your influences are coming from
[1:50:16] hallelujah
[1:50:18] if you're truly born again
[1:50:21] and you pass from death into life and
[1:50:24] your influences will be coming from
[1:50:25] heaven
[1:50:27] and you will reflect jesus christ in
[1:50:29] your daily warfare
[1:50:31] but if you haven't not yet had that
[1:50:33] experience
[1:50:35] passing from death to life
[1:50:49] they do not practice sin in the practice
[1:50:54] amen
[1:50:55] it doesn't mean they don't fall
[1:50:56] seriously it doesn't mean they don't
[1:50:58] come short
[1:51:00] but when they do they repent
[1:51:03] and they ask god to forgive them
[1:51:06] death can do uh pull you in or pull a
[1:51:08] believer into the presence of the maker
[1:51:12] that's the only thing that death can do
[1:51:16] some of these days
[1:51:18] death will
[1:51:28] and these were supernatural beings
[1:51:32] there was excuse me and there was a
[1:51:33] supernatural being
[1:51:36] waiting at my mother
[1:51:38] to give me life
[1:51:40] when i was born
[1:51:42] so if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:51:44] dissolved
[1:51:46] there is already
[1:52:00] and just as i've been the garden of the
[1:52:02] spirit here
[1:52:04] um
[1:52:06] and the spirit of god crying out abba
[1:52:09] father
[1:52:11] not only me
[1:52:12] but every person in the world
[1:52:25] in the grace of our lord jesus christ
[1:52:42] no
[1:53:10] in galilee
[1:53:12] hallelujah is that all right
[1:53:15] one of these days
[1:53:17] in galilee of god
[1:53:20] yonder somewhere
[1:53:22] i expect to meet him in peace
[1:53:31] i trust that he's the same with every
[1:53:34] one of you
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:54:21] ought to see that
[1:54:24] people are you uh people
[1:54:28] all you're you're done lay right here
[1:54:33] this is what i'm trying to say excuse me
[1:54:35] i'm admitting some of it
[1:54:37] because i want to get back to it
[1:54:41] even these things memphis shows us satan
[1:54:45] sinners
[1:54:47] for eternity
[1:55:15] will be done away without
[1:55:30] [Music]
[1:55:45] and everything else
[1:55:47] it's gone
[1:55:51] it's the origin
[1:55:52] is a sign of sin
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:56] the earth will be cursed
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:24] nothing will ever touch that side yeah
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:40] hallelujah
[1:57:04] like if anything is sterilized
[1:57:50] let them
[1:58:15] [Applause]
[1:58:17] you can't tell me you got to fire
[1:58:19] baptism
[1:58:20] and you still want to do evil
[1:58:28] he said oh you can be tempted
[1:58:31] but satan cannot hold you
[1:58:46] his husband
[1:58:55] one glorious plan of redemption
[1:58:58] and it's brought right into the bosom of
[1:59:00] god again
[1:59:04] so what am i saying
[1:59:06] in closing
[1:59:10] i preach my heart
[1:59:20] what i really want everybody to really
[1:59:22] consider
[1:59:25] your position in christ
[1:59:28] personally personally
[1:59:30] my cry before god the
[1:59:33] villager is always
[1:59:36] don't let me be deceived
[1:59:41] don't make me
[1:59:42] believe or let satan make me believe i
[1:59:45] got it
[1:59:48] every church
[1:59:50] whether it be baptist methodist
[1:59:53] catholic presbyterian every one of them
[1:59:55] believe that they're the truth
[1:59:56] don't
[2:00:09] what is blinded us
[2:00:10] schemes
[2:00:12] because we think because we've been so
[2:00:14] justified
[2:00:17] we have never seen in the first place
[2:00:20] we think that's applicable
[2:00:23] to us when we don't even have the holy
[2:00:25] ghost
[2:00:28] i don't know who i'm talking to jesus
[2:00:31] but you know who i'm talking about
[2:00:34] the the pentecostal people
[2:00:38] because they spit
[2:00:51] and yet they're deceived
[2:00:54] then what is it that they're doing
[2:00:57] or what is it that they don't have
[2:01:01] that we must have
[2:01:03] you can't think that god is going to
[2:01:05] brace a judgment on them
[2:01:11] and we have the opportunity to have it
[2:01:15] and won't go after it
[2:01:20] you know what it is sorry
[2:01:23] the life la vie
[2:01:26] i don't care how much they jump and
[2:01:27] shout
[2:01:29] out the bible says
[2:01:31] babylon
[2:01:32] has become the cage
[2:01:47] because they want their own little thing
[2:01:48] going on

[2:01:53] we don't want the life
[2:01:57] we needed
[2:01:59] not on every sunday
[2:02:01] or every wednesday
[2:02:16] your father which
[2:02:27] [Music]
