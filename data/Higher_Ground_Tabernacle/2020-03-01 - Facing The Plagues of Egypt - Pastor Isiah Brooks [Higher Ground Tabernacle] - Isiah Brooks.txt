me yes [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my soul [Music] [Music] I by which testimony to start I'm just I'm just I've been going through some battles where the devil will tell me that God won't answer my prayers anymore and for sometimes I start I kind of believe that because there are things I was praying to God and it seems like it was he wasn't answering so I went through like almost like a depression depression time well where I thought that God was not answering my prayers anymore but um still there was just that faith inside of me that you still I still know that I mean even if it doesn't answer some prayers but His Word is still true like if he says ask and you shall be given as to I don't know how to explain that but I still knew that his word was true and also one day actually Frank should have given that testimony but I don't know why I didn't give the testimony but so one day just in the middle of the depression I texted Frank and it was a he was at school and I asked him where it was and he told me that school and I told him and he told me lost his car key and all it's been it's been searching for that for a long time and he can't find it and I'm like okay I'll pray for you still the devil telling me that God isn't its he won't even matter if I pray because God doesn't even answer my prayers anymore but I still told him I'll pray for you and I prayed for him and I told God that because I've had I've had some experiences where God showed me where certain things that were lost were and so I told God that you know where the key is so if you can help find I'll help Frank find the key or you take that key you bring it to Frank and in less than five minutes Frank texted me told me you found the key somebody somebody had the somebody turned the key to the security officer and the security officer brought it to Frank so that was very very encouraging to me cause oh I know the devil is a liar he always tells me that God doesn't answer my prayers and he's still telling me that that's why I had some hard times not knowing which testimony to start by because I knew that I still know God is to God Israel you just gotta learn how to check his yes and those two another one was um I've been going to some financial battles and um so yeah that was today about two days ago I went to do a demonstration for like a me salesman and I do demonstration for my product and um when I enter into that the house I mean that's the I noticed like do it there was the husband and his wife and as after a child his phone his phone rang and I heard like I can only imagine that was his ringtone and I thought dear Christians so um that made me comfortable and I started talking and I went to the bathroom to like put one of my device there and I saw the Bible in the bathroom was like oh wow and I asked him what were you reading and he said I was reading The Book of Isaiah and um and in the made me comfortable we started sharing about the word and it was talking about how nowadays many people have their own interpretation of the word and I was like you definitely true and one of those is Matthew 28 where Jesus says baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but then men have brought their own interpretation of baptizing name of Father Son and Holy Ghost but nowhere in the Bible you see the baptism in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and I explained to them Jesus the baptism in jesus name they were just like wow we've never heard of this before and oh they were very amazed and then I just like his wife had like a share to live on oxygen support she'd locked a long oxygen line that should drag everywhere she goes and I that made me sad and I asked her like how did you like do you mind sharing how you what's wrong with you and she's like yeah she they diagnosed they diagnosed me with all these disease and it's been there I think it's like Oh from father to son to likely just like from generation to generation and I saw is there in any way you can get rid of that she's like no like I'm gonna stay like that for the rest of my life and she can't she can't work she has kids they're really good people and I told her but you know you don't have to stay that way because when Jesus died for you on the cross if that's so you can be healed and saved it wasn't just for you your salvation but also your healing and I started telling her about those Bradburn I'm so disturb Abraham Lincoln how that one guy was already pardoned but he refused his pardon because he thought I was a joke and then so pardon his pardon if it's receivers pardon and healing is healing if it's received as healing and I really encouraged her and I noticed the guy will go outside and smoke cigarette and I'm like well you know the and after the normally I'm not even supposed to talk about religion at work but just because they made me do it I just had to do it and oh so I told him you know the Bible says that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost so you shouldn't defile it when you go and smoke cigarette and you claim to be a Christian it's like yeah that's sure unlike you guys do you promise that if I'll pray for your wife but you promise that if God kills your wife you're going to give up the bad habit of smoking cigarettes but I just try to do what bourbon and we're doing the prayer lines and I'm like do you promise that if God will heal your wife that you'll give up the bad habit and you guys both of you you will give your life to Jesus and you'll be baptized the right way the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they're like yes no doubt about it and I'm like wow that's a good thing so let's join hands and pray so we just join hand and pray and I told them to keep believing and I just keep trusting even when the devil keeps telling me that God is not answering my prayers but I keep trusting I just did what brother but I'm told us to do to apply the token everywhere we go and also it's up to God now to do and just keep praying for them and all god bless you [Applause] amen God's real amen brother Frank wants to give a little testimony it says Thanksgiving he says hi brother Frank I thank God the Almighty for adding a new member in my family giving a son to my little sister on Friday I'm a proud first time uncle now let's sing in the name of Jesus [Music] in the name of G

musicians amen those of us who were not here on Wednesday night the Lord really blessed us and I'm looking for the Lord to do exceedingly above that I'm an expectation of all of the things that have been prophesied for us but I know that the only place these things could happen is that we find ourselves in that provided place the Prophet God tells us that the only place of worship in this day is under the blood of Jesus Christ so as we stand I want us to turn to Exodus the twelfth chapter will read the 13th verse there there's a lot I'd like to say and I trust that God will grant us this morning not my thoughts but his thoughts that we will speak to this morning to all of us I believe that we are living in a time where it's very serious and we need to know that it is the will of God or what the will of God is for us so Exodus the 12th chapter xiii verse and shall be to you for token upon the houses where you are and when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt hallelujah let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and Lord we thank you Lord for all that you have done for us and everything that you are doing for us God I I see your perfect plan and I see how you have protected us throughout all the ages and Lord we realize this morning that even our our standing here is not some coincidence it's not some freak accident of science but Lord you chose us and elected us before the foundation of the world and father we know that your word is sure and stedfast and father we believe because that was your theme song Lord when you came Oh God in in in in the mask of William Branham that song was sang almost every service only believed and father we believe this morning Oh God that that's all that we can do that means no space for doubt no space for fear there's no space for reasoning Lord we thank you for the the revelation of only believe thank you Lord for all that you are and all that you are doing for us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle the message this morning facing the plagues of Egypt and we realized by God's grace day prophet of God spoke a message on the token after the seals were opened and one of the greater things messages that he spoke after the seas were open was the token and God revealed in simplicity we have to know that in the line of duty we must understand that we must all come under the blood in that time in Egypt I find it amazing how God hundreds of years ago could lay out such a plan that we could actually look back and see that that plan not only was for them but for us haven't missed a beat everything perfect in its own way we realized by God's grace that the only way that we'll make a rapture is that we believe all of the word by one word we have found ourselves in this fallen condition and we are yearning and groaning amen for our new home but understand that the blood of Jesus Christ or the revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ can only be given to those who are elected we realize Amen that when God shed his blood on Calvary even though he purchased the whole entire earth or the whole entire world everybody will not be saved so for those of us who are failing to see how blessed you are I hope by the end of the service you'll see that the message itself come to give you Liberty but one thing about God is that he will never force anything on you the Word of God say whosoever will let him come now I don't know about you but my anchor holds you and I must understand that we're living in a time when when when when if you don't have Jesus you're in trouble because there are two pools one pool is in pulling you downwards and the other pool is pulling you up to heaven even brother branham's had two facets one facet is to believer the other facet of this message is the unbeliever one this message come to condemn and the other one the message come to give liberty is that right you and I must understand that the life is in the blood now we do not put blood on the doorpost in a little we're not looking for a man whose hands are bleeding we're not looking for somebody who has scars on his brow because we realized where the word of God is you and I must understand Amen that the blood of Jesus Christ came to not only justify us sanctify us is that right Amen - give us the Holy Ghost so that Christ Himself can live in us now the Bible tells us not to grieve grieve not the Holy Ghost and see a lot of time like I was speaking on Wednesday you know we've got to be connected is that right it has to be a connection between God and you and I think that's what has happened to a lot of people they have lived what you call an artificial Christian experience because they have allowed systems to - - how could I say it they have allowed systems to reform them but this message come not to reform you it comes to transform you right anybody can have false teeth and and use them and a false arm or leg and use it but in reality that false arm and that false leg is not you you'll never be connected with those things even though they are useful brother branham actually liking it on to this he said that's the way it is like a lot of times we think that even Christians who are of their denomination those who are born of a denomination sometimes they have a denominational spirit and therefore they can't see the truth no matter how much you give them the word they cannot see the truth because their experience is not a world experience it is a denominational spirit so let us be careful because no system can save you because you were raised in the message or raised around the message and you know God the Prophet and you know his name is William Branham you know Amen that God opened the seals you know that there have been thunders and lightnings hallelujah that still does not save you because in order for you to make a rapture you must be connected you must be born again this is why I put emphasis on it because we are now experiencing a lot of things not in just America but all over the world and the only way of your escape is to be found underneath the blood of Jesus Christ when we see how people don't seem to understand you can't play with this it ain't something that you can just have an option because remember priests don't Esther Esther amen excuse me I preached Amen on Unown Esther and the other day I preached her own vasti right and that's tea refused the king's call and a lot of time we think because we come out of denomination and we come out of organization praise God I got it made well the children of Israel came out of Egypt and they still didn't having me they knew that Moses was a prophet and they still did not have it made hallelujah and in the 40 years of Jehovah teaching them in the wilderness showing them that he was still still God there is none of them sick out of two million people are law none was sick ha because they had a smitten Rock and they had a pillar fire and the blood had been applied somebody helped me here see they were protected from all of the germs and diseases that they could have contracted while they were in the wilderness hallelujah and think about this God will heal you God will will deliver you from diseases he will protect you even prosper you but that still doesn't mean you got in me because the children of Israel it meant in the wilderness they did they met the shoes never rule out that clause never got ragged hallelujah but there was one thing they did not have they did not have the connection to Jehovah they saw who Moses was and in their mind they saw Moses as a man who was trying to exalt himself hallelujah so is it today we look at William Branham and many people looking at him not even understanding who he is or who he lost and we look at him as though he was a man who God exalted but you let me let me say like this that still doesn't fix it the Bible says that Joshua and Caleb had a different experience somehow they met the God that was moving Moses like that they knew that Moses what could not have come up with the things that he came up with so they had an experience somewhere reading between the lines they had the same Holy Ghost or the same anointing that Moses had that's why they did not blaspheme Josh when Caleb they followed every word Moses spoke and at the end of the day of their generation they were only the only two that God did not destroy y'all hear what I'm saying you see because God protected them when the Death Angel came in while they were in Egypt God protected them ah because they had the blood on the doorpost and 11 but what they fail to see was that the blood justified them when they came through the waters they meant it was baptized unto Moses he meant the blood the water sanctified just i sanctified them but you gotta understand after being sanctified that's when the test comes in God told him Amen that he put them out of the wilderness in the wilderness to be what tested so that they could see what was in their hearts God knew wasn't what was in their hearts just like God knows what's in your heart God knew what was in their heart he put them out because you see nobody would be able to stand before God as his Lord you was unfair because God give everybody a fair chance somebody help me even when he know you're not gonna go any further hallelujah is that right it's true the same thing happens with this message animalic I saw hallelujah the number of people who saw the miraculous saw the pillar fire there in the meetings and where are they now hallelujah remember you said oh if I could go back to Egypt oh I remember the millions and the leaks and all of the good things we had over there see we weren't so we're not so organized that we could produce such stuff is that because we're on a journey we're travelling we're trying to meet me heaven our home but the Bible tells me that because of the murmuring and complaining believe you me if God judged him doing for that God will judge you now for that because of the murmuring and complaining always in God's face as the God is unjust hallelujah he is he your the claim he's the potter he knows how to load and make you and oftentimes we need to hush and let God Mode and make us facing oh I can hardly stand it when everybody who's in here yeah were you clothed you fed him then you got a nice hole and then a place to stay and live and we complain to God because we don't have nonsense nonsense pride is the thing that makes you want more than what you necessarily need I remember the time and I must job just for a moment cuz I feel led to go this way I was over in India where kids didn't even have clothes to wear not y'all hear what I'm saying not just kids people had no closer where they had cardboard boxes as houses but one thing I saw in them that I've rarely see in what we call Christians and that's joy they will content with what they had the fact and then the brother went out about three or four o'clock in the morning because we wanted to get to the real poor we wanted to get to those who were not pretending and we were just passing out candy and this one little boy saw us he could recognize we were I guess Americans or whatever he ran into us too big amen we just said I just gave him some candy you know what that little boy did I'll never forget it he ran and he went and got all of his buddies all of his friends and they all came we had to be confident we wouldn't be still paid but it touched my heart so much this made this little boy who say here he could be back in his pockets but he went and got his friends so they could share awesome just-just-just and I left there thinking who is the rich man the one who has character and the one who has wealth with no character hello somebody I'm a preach on anyway now you must understand that God amen this is the age of repentance how many y'all know that and now you say why why you bringing it up because it's so hard to get people to repent wish there was such a beautiful night everybody came to the altar didn't have to ask much didn't have to beg everybody was down only needs one wait one place or another crying out or speaking to God I was so moved and so touches as Lord that's what I like because the Bible said our broken and contrite spirit is what God delights in prideful look he hates it he hates a prize for luck and yet we'll come in here looking prideful according to the fourth seal the Prophet Goss said I might just give you an individual a little shake here he said to refuse God to refuse God call you know what I'm trying to say he said O Lord I came out I came out but you see what it is we fail to see we got to go in and you can't go in without the character of Christ Peter tells us it meant how that there has been an entrance and interested to what that same door it meant that the foolish virgins could not go in the wise went in because they didn't stop in the middle of the trip they kept moving because they knew that the time and the season was an urgent season your character must be shaped it must be formed into the image of God and you're going to if you are elected let me put it this way if you are elected to make a rapture it's going to be done whether you like it or not you're going to either be led by like God leads a lamb or driven like cattle he's going to get it he said Oh brothers why would you say that Jacob was elected and God put Jacob in such a position for 14 years he fought but by the time God finished with him he was ready to be sealed with the Holy Ghost he was ready Amen to wrassle with the angel see some of us ain't ready that's why we ain't got what we say we have related people we just want God to just drop in on us brother man who said no no no God ain't pulling nobody through a tube you got to work for this salvation and about said work out your own salvation you can't work mine out and I can't work yours out you got to work your own hello in nobody knows like you know the demons that you have in you every bit of those dark thoughts and you must go out every demon that you're possessing so I ain't possessed no demons yes you are if you're not filled and sealed with the Holy Ghost you got some demons that ain't nothin but the truth the Holy Ghost comes like brother Baron said in the future home he said we're not sure when that earth gets its fire baptism he said people complain about all the noise in the sound I wish I had some noise and sound in here it shows we ain't where we think we are mm-hmm you think how to get people to say Amen real good they get attitudes because you preach it on them I'm preaching on you this morning ha because God told me so and let me say it like these people of God there is no gospel real gospel that will not cut you every true gospel come to rebuke is that right Laodicea he said I come to rebuke you and be zealous to repent and when you repent that means you ready to turn from the evil that you're doing now you tell me y'all I need I need more help I need more God huh yeah yeah you don't have to raise your hand and all you know what I know you do cuz you're human you got flesh when you take this flesh off you don't need no help but as long as you got this man on you Oh we go give you trouble and that's why the pot tank called the kettle black every one of us need help that right even brother Brendan said he confesses he sees everyday the prophet of God at least acknowledged he has problems some of us think we don't he said but oh when I see the Blood I pass over you who praise God see and when she refused it let me see and just like that church did excuse me it's over see God patience will not always strive with man y'all think I'm gonna keep putting up with y'all nonsense he ain't gonna put up with mine and he ain't gonna put up with yours and when she refused it and refused to accept it then she can change right she's got a name called death why because she refused but what would you say while they were in Egypt they accept escaped the death angel but when they got in the wilderness they failed to see that the death angel was coming again hmm understand if you refuse God's character when he's telling you you must have patience he's telling you you must have knowledge and the private God said this is a battle this is a fight you've got to have these things ever I'm telling you it's not because you believe in America you if you really believe in Malachi 4 and the message in which God has brought you'll be pressing toward the mark you do everything you can do hallelujah even though you know it's by grace you'll do everything you can do to make things right but when you refuses it that's what God won't put up with when you know to do good and do it not we know us we know it's nicotine but we understand that the bride of Jesus Christ she's not made like that she's not made like that she's a woman that says Lord whatever your will is let your will be done in our lives she's that kind of a woman right see I've even I really take her children and listen if God had me and a brother me and Troy I was just talking in a it's so true if you think is bad now i'ma say like this let me use this scenario brother Ellen said that the Catholic Church was the true Church of God one time they actually believed in acts 2:38 they believed in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were the true Pentecostal Church of Rome and look how far they have fallen the real deal and think about this they meant that how God has come and in the Prophet I told the Pentecostal church just give you a long long time and you'll be worse than the Catholic Church hello and they are at least the Catholic Church people know what they worship Him a lot of them know what they worship it but the Pentecostal people don't know what they worship it do you know what you worship it because if you're not worshiping god you're worshiping the devil and because people go to different churches don't need their true Christians give them the word test and if they don't take the word that means they're born of another seed that's true what happens that's what I'm saying you know why I'm telling you all this because if you don't press into Christ you're going to get worse your habits will increase your bondage will increase if you refuse God he will refuse him for the last time and God is gonna reject you he's not a respect to person making sense no brother books everybody ain't creaking like this I I'm not concerned because I have to give an account for those who I pastor and let me tell you like this but the velum said I think he said the preachers ought to be telling the people about the end time the time we're living in do you realize we are living in the time where the fourth horse rider is riding do you all know who that is that's death that's that pale horse it meant that mixture and his death is not natural spiritual look if you do not press into we don't have to wonder what the end is going to be he says I've even taken their children the Protestants and ice-cream sometimes every time I think about it every time I think about those 400 preachers who's supposed to meet brother Branham down there and Jefferson via to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they didn't even show up what did they do they rejected the gospel and not only because they rejected it everybody they preached to if the blind leader Lisa bride they both fall in the ditch thank about the thousands of people under those ministries who thought they were saved the only way they could have ever been saved is that God gave them grace to escape come out of her my people no system can save you I'm going to tell you that over and over again no system can save you y'all don't have to believe me but I know I'm of God what was it you know when that that was given out in the Age of Thyatira when the woman wanted to be the boss hello and don't tell me that that the devil don't work with you women and you want to be the boss you don't even want to listen to correction anymore hello the spirit of Thyatira still lives and still affect people what does it produce stubbornness and what is stubbornness is like witchcraft is though some battle has been cast upon you when you know the Word of God and you don't want to do it he's long-suffering hallelujah listen I'm gonna quote you some stuff so you know it's just not my words but then say he is long-suffering like he was in the days of Noah he tried hard he suffered alone for 120 years to get them to repent look how long it's been brother Branham is off the scene and look what we're doing the very stuff he told us getting rid of we're now incorporating it back into our mercy services whoa come on somebody they wouldn't do it in the days of Egypt he said plagues and everything else they wouldn't do it huh look at it what are you saying let me let me jump here just for a moment the corona virus is now plaguing nations now they say is here it's not some false propaganda it's real people are dying their only protection when I see the blood I'll pass over your your only protection this is why I'm screaming I can't help it the only protection doesn't will be the blood of Jesus not because I think I've got it you got to know that you have it the blood must be on display and his the chemistry is to life that means people supposed to see the life of the blood living through you here oh I got it let me tell you but let me tell you something even if you've got let me say like this what good will it do you if the faith of it not is not on display you got to have faith in what blood y'all believe that I believe it I'm gonna get there I've got a few quotes on germ warfare because y'all don't understand I looked it up even on the internet today and I thought on my phone and I thought oh my god I didn't realize it was so vast I didn't realize that they've been experiencing with this stuff for a long time America and everybody anthrax you name it they've got all kinds of these jars locked up that they have hydrated you understand me that means a demon out of hell has gotten into it and Jesus listen in the days of each of these in place and everything else and I used to wonder when I used to read this revelation and I thought oh my God look at this look at this I'll be playing everything else you know scorpions Olga and the Bible said and the people would not repent God we live in the same day we live in a day right now where the people will not repent they don't repent they don't want to repent not your bad shape you don't repent have you ever been in a place you want to cry and you can't cry that's an awful feeling but if you still want to cry God can give you some tears but if you don't want to repent he can't give you nothing am I making sense I know this is a hard message for people of God I'm I'm looking for a revival and the only way revival can come is that we clean up car can't see no revival in a trashy place and I don't know your lies but one thing I know I could tell by the atmosphere that things ain't right and when we come in here and our lives are not right we greed the Holy Ghost it's not up to the song leader to get you stirred up he's supposed to come in here stirred up am I making sense come in here with your fire and I don't care if it's just one person one person would fire can let let like the whole church on fire let me move on and now last days he promised a game that he was sin a message to call her out i'ma read that again brother sorry and now in the last days he promised again that he was sin a message to call her out and restore the original faith back to it back to the word let me ask you something has it truly been restored we've got the word but the word has got to be a living word and as long as we don't have the Holy Ghost to activate it it hasn't been personally restored in your life I believe the restoration is a personal thing it's not a group thing it has to be here a personal thing where it has been restored and you believe every word and you're getting results everybody's not getting resolves why I don't care if you got an iron here or electric stove or electric heater it's got everything working you got the plug and everything else but if you don't set it in there and plug it up is of no value and with all this message that you have all the words have been preached on us we ought to be ashamed because we're living in the last moment of this time and with the raptures right at our face and we are not on fire and the Bible said I would that you be hot or cold help us do help us help us but this is just what I'm going to he said and restore the original faith back to it back to the word and they won't receive it he didn't say they didn't believe it he said they won't receive it there's a difference you can believe something because Satan believes and tremble but he doesn't have anything to receive with and you've got to receive this you got to take this word and this word must become a part of you is that's what Jesus had he broke the bread and he said eat take heed he took the ride he said drink it why because he wanted that wine and that bread to be connected to you symbolic it was us being connected to him bearing his suffering burn his shame and dogmas increasing gonna get it well they didn't receive it and their dog was in creature they don't want it it's true I can preach Jesus Christ here and I tell you what you'd be surprised at the people that will receive it you know you know brother barons message was Jesus Christ it wasn't his message it was given to him am I right or wrong and that word in which he preached amen it was Jesus Christ and this is why he said the same yesterday today and forever but they won't receive it people think you let me tell you what the devil did what he has done he has given this message or people in the message of Baptist doctrine when you believe the message you got it that's a lie have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message hmm have you got the kinda holy ghost and somebody spit in your face you can forgive them somebody help me here because the pressure is coming you think you have an adversities now it's going to get worse but my question is can you love the person that spit in your face but you know Jesus did it they spat in his face they mocked him they stole him and while he was in his dying moments he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do that's the character that takes a rapture hey divine love is what he's looking for hmm I love it this way he says you know he said he takes something ignorant and stupid and I know sometimes people think that of me but that's okay something that don't know hardly anything not a B C's or anything and then he takes that type of a person cuz he can take something that's nothing and then work through it and as long as something think there's something then they can't do nothing with it and that's exactly what the devil has done to a lot of us we had given us the message and given us a message pride with it Pharisees of all Pharisees mmm we can't even love nobody else if they don't proclaim this message who's somebody help me here that ain't the way brother Brandon was he didn't care what brand you was he just wanted to know have you been born again help us lord help us he's done it again she won't do it her rejection away makes her all her rejection mixed up the perfect way of satan to come into her be incarnated whoo put you wet if you reject the Holy Ghost you get the unholy gold which is called Satan and just like the Holy Ghost will inject himself in you Satan will inject himself in you without the Holy Ghost you have no protection and right now we're living in the most darkest time ever is that right the darkness can be felt and that's the way it was in Egypt y'all know what I'm saying did do you know why I call it the plagues facing the plagues of Egypt because the plagues came before the Exodus he so I'm not gonna be here when that happened yes you will just like he Israel was there in Egypt amen they were there when the plagues failed every one of them but they were in a hiding place called Goshen and even at a time where it was so dark in Asia there was lighting ghosts somebody help me here see what you got to understand it may be a hard time if neither a dark time but there's lied in Goshen hallelujah I'm not stumbling around in the dark I'm not stumbling around in the dark I see which way I'm going whoo hallelujah do I fight every day I fight every day do I deny myself every day I deny myself every day do I get a hundred percent every day no but I'm still pressing hallelujah I'm pressing toward that mark of the high calling there's no giving up there's no turning round ha because I feel the pool my pool is upward surely is not that way hallelujah that's right incarnated himself in her because she rejected the word hmm now he just talking about denomination you know we don't if you believe this hey you don't have to believe it I know it's true and I don't told y'all some of my experience experiences here I went to a Jeffersonville when they had brother branham's cable put no man could have carved that cave like that and he was just man figures hanging from the ceiling right he's got a whole mountain range in his profile I don't understand even in Sabino Canyon out there amen he's there what was it this generation is without excuse God said make no graven image and yet God caused this man's image thousands of years you gotta realize this happened way before when the Indians got here it was here and you gonna come to a time in your life right now you're gonna doubt it what foolish mind or what foolish thinking that is because you're doing work it in your life don't blame it on God faith will move mountains where is your faith hmm some of us we're so small we just want God to snap at our finger guarding you don't rule him and one thing you understand no church rules God hallelujah he have might have been ruled by Jezebel though no one whose God no chart tell him what to do he's the head of it I feel like shouting but I got a preach oh my and that's exactly the same thing the president church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the vindicated truth of the world of God God don't change with fashion we don't care about liberal artwork women's living all that nonsense the trick of the devil that's what we got all these Bert's perverts now is that right brother brown said because the woman moved out of her place Jesus help us Lord that's exactly the same thing that Protestant church become a hot harlot is because she rejected the vindicated truth of the world of God and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself what about all those people who rejected this truth you think they're still the same that's why many of them are stripping themselves going out on the beach drinking and pot many of them have become atheists because Devils have entered because they refuse the Holy Ghost message this is the Holy Ghost message hmm I preached nothing there Peter didn't preach on the day of Pentecost he said repent they said what must we do repent change your mind change your heart Satan's business is to put bitterness in your heart and unforgiveness because when he does it he know he's got you at a standstill but you gotta overcome that and don't tell God you can't do it cuz he put it in your life allowed it to happen so you can overcome so you can stand on that day set a comma how you gonna overcome something without battles how are you going to do it don't tell God he doesn't know what he's doing he knows what he's doing hallelujah what we need to do is in tune our minds into Christ right let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus you see what one thing about the Lord no matter what G God told him to do he did it he humbled himself and that's the problem we need to humble ourselves is that right he said he gave each of a place to repent and what was the last plague was death and that's where we are he's given us place to repent and death is the lad play that's the last plague that hit the Pentecostal church his spiritual death she's dead is that the Bible increased with good have neither nothing and I said she did and don't even know it that's in the name of the Lord she is spiritually dead he gave her space to repent and she rejected it oh I love this message you know why because those gifts always confused me and the Bible says that the gifts and calling of God was without repentance that means God gives gifts some can preach some can sing some can have a little discernment but it still don't mean they say y'all better think are for election y'all looking at like the Doomsday bombers hit you it ain't hit you it will if you don't repeat it it's coming this is your out of it event I don't know what you're going through but make it right with God even the scientists in what two seconds now two seconds to midnight the coronavirus and and and I got a quote here and I'm have to hurry up let me let me jump to that quote because time is moving and we're trying to finish it up but just to give everybody a word of encouragement those of us who know you elected maybe you haven't come to the place you want to but don't stop don't quit this is not a time to give up the finishing line is right there yes times are hard but guess what they could be harder you ever heard the word worst worse is worth it's the next level in the force field he says those with him and this is I love about it because we realized Amen that this battle is not all over it ain't over yet right it means that we got something else coming but let me start with this one so I'm a little longer than what I intended to be he said let me pass something here quickly as our time or going listen you did did you know the Bible predicts that in the last days that there that there be a germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and we're following everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost but with the angel or who has charged over these plagues was given order to touch no one on whom the mark was why how much kind of teaching have we got to be present to get the church in order to be in that condition immune and a lot of us don't even know how to fight the flu y'all hear me let me let me read you another one because I want you to understand by God's grace now now we are here it is let me read this to show you how people can be deceived how many I'll believe that William Brennan was the last messenger the last age okay let me say it like this how many of y'all know okay now here it is in closing not my closing he's saying this to those who don't believe that the last messenger to the church ages Elijah the prophet a man anointed in that line he's the last one now he says now in the fifth sealed that was the fourth seal he says now the first Elijah that was him the second Elijah was Elijah the third was John the fourth person seven angel or the messenger up to the Church of corn America for in Revelation 10 seven the fifth time he is a messenger to the Jews to the 144,000 to the Jews after the church is gone so the fourth one is the last is the Elijah to the church there ain't no eighth angel there's no great prophet that's gonna come around if it is this is wrong but you've got people who have not entered into his arrest and see that's why people run to and fro he said if he says in the desert don't you go ha ha he said if they say whatever you make don't go ha because we're the caucus is there were the Eagles be gathered and you know what people know this is true yet they go a ministry because they have not made their calling and election sure somebody helped me here that's why God did not give a man the ability to give you the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost God gives it to you I don't care if I lay hands on you all day God has to give it to you you are brought by Jesus Christ and him only you think I'm crazy but I was told that in a meeting demons was being cast out of people and then one person took the picture of William Branham and asked him the devil do you know this man what he said yes but that was going to do you Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you that person was just lucky that the devil didn't jump all over him it's all right I'm telling you the truth I'm looking for something that I can't find it but that's all right our ministry tonight so I want you to understand that I'm not just saying anything to be saying anything but the inspiration that I'm getting is coming from the word I'm a quote this one scripture now and imma let you go proverbs 27:19 and I finished tonight or completely tonight I would like to encourage everybody well you know if you can come come if you can't you can that's just the way it goes but everybody that can come come this is the last day if you really love the Lord you don't care if you getting a slice you're gonna get a slice any soup kitchen if they said all you're gonna get is a one cup I'm going cuz I'm hungry now if you ain't hungry you don't have to come proverbs 27:19 but I'm always looking for more word um you know what I don't care about let me put the way law understand what I'm saying people I love too deep things but let me tell you something when a preacher can come and show me what faults I have when he can shine the light of the gospel in my soul and show me the devil's that's-that's-that's that's hiding within me those are the kind of preachers I like that's why I so love brother Branham because you know brother Branham didn't play no jokes he went straight for the jugular that's what he did even now I could listen to his tapes and be moved by God's voice crying and repenting hallelujah but it doesn't confuse me I know God sent a fivefold ministry you love the Lord this is what he says proverbs 27:19 this is what I preached last Wednesday and I'm gonna show it to you again as in water face answers to faith and so the heart of a man to a man I meant to bring my mirror and I forgot hmm it must have not been the will of God I was gonna bring my big mirror and I was gonna show you I wanted everybody to look into it and tell me what you see right when you look at that mirror you see your face whether you like it or not you're the image in the mirror the mirror don't lie you understand me it the light of it just reflects what you are and the Bible says Amen that here it is he said he goes on to say Amen so the heart of a man to a man right in other words what's ever in your heart is what you show on the outside and people say dont you judge me I ain't judging you I'm seeing your reflection that's what it says the heart of a man so don't tell me I'm judging you if you looking all worldly it's out in your heart your heart is telling me something ain't right because the mirror of the world is supposed to reflect the mirror the reflection of Jesus Christ and if I'm looking at you and I see that you're not reflecting what Jesus Christ would be reflecting no something is wrong and no matter what you say you can't get out of it your heart is going to tell the truth oh all right I didn't read that quote I wanted to read but i'ma tell you something own artificial Christians you know how it is we say all the Lord I love you and the moment we can get a chance to do a Judit Aryan kiss we kiss the devil who you got quiet you know what do it Judit Aryan kids look it up in the message flirting with the world doing things you know you ought not to do huh and you're coming say Oh Lord I love your brother and say he don't like that God don't like you and any man that's a good man and love his wife wouldn't like that I'm just throwing that out at you it's time to us all of us to become more sincere more consecrated we need to be connected you love the Lord best and when I see the blood I pass over you you know one of these old days like brother branham said you'll appreciate what I'm telling you there's no way I'm trying to equate myself with the Prophet but one thing I know it's gonna be a lot of souls in hell because brother Branham said don't wear those high-heeled shoes that we do it anyway he tells us amen the reflection what we saw in heaven he said I saw the bride she was dressed in comet that was loose-fitting and she said she had sleeves and her dress was down to her ankle that was the reflection that means that someone up here is living that way here [Music] hallelujah even Einstein knew that you can be in two places at one time Jesus said how can the Son of Man be here on earth and be in heaven at the same time how can he say Joe where were you blessed Joe was there in here too see this is not some coincidence it's a reality he's our brother but you just being legal no I'm not all I know is that if you knew and understood your election Amen you do and try your best to reflect what you would be reflected that's why he said let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven this ain't our home but we act like it is no I'm not I'm not saying let me just leave it the way it is but if you got the real Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost to teach you how to dress it'll tell you when you're naked and when you're not naked it'll tell you when you're going worthy when you're not going word hallelujah a little leaven leavens the whole lump hallelujah you love the Lord what can I say owner here are stood at all rock [Music] that'll wear the D in a world love rustling [Music] Oh [Music] fill my drawer that [Music] I will to the [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] applause Jesus [Applause] ah sure [Music] I'll eat down [Music] [Music] it's on [Music] [Applause] I will [Music] [Applause] [Music] where is loli I Oh the [Music] and exchange for just want to say to the saints of God this morning one thing I'm certain of I don't ever get in this pulpit without knowing that I've heard from God I don't I don't rely on anyone elses anointing what I get I get and you may not feel or even understand what I'm trying to say but I know if the seeds are planted at some point in time you're gonna understand what's being said and you will react to it but I must do as he tells me and I know my god break when it comes to the time line we don't have much time when I wiggle now because a lot of us have strongholds you know the stronghold is you in deep we don't know how to get out of it it has a grip on you but understand that God destroys stronghold the same Lord Jesus think about it a brother was say it really sick and I told I said brother God he is some perfect he put the greatest example of resurrection and restoration in that little story of Lazarus you might be sick but you ain't dead and if he was there God still Carrera and I think about stuff like that I think about what's in hospital for God if God can raise up people who have been in the grave for thousands of years raise them up clothe them in a glorified body and take him to him he can do the same for us we're just in time but when that time means we are we are eternal beings and understand that where I am now there is no sickness there is no failure there is no no no no nothing that that can relate to this everything over there is victorious there's not a bad day there's not a rainy day there's not a time of depression or anything so why should I be depressed here why should I be down here when I'm over there enjoying whatever I enjoy that's the way you got to look at it you got to look at health like I'm looking at my health too bad I'm looking at my deliverance up there I'm looking at mine everything I'm up there okay I'm perfectly her so if I'm perfectly hold there I should be perfectly whole here that's the way God wants us to look at it that's why he said set your affection on things above not on the things of the earth people set your affection on things above he told Abraham that he didn't say Abraham see all her says to seal this know sure he told me Ben look up this is not all it I've got something up here for you and inheritance up there and as it is here so shall it be there if we can just see those things and move in a give us a plane where there'll be no quitting and there'll be no turning around or looking back but befallen forward forward wouldn't it be a shame to miss a rapture because you you like something so slow I loved it more no one for prayer [Music] see [Music] sir [Music] [Music] see [Music] [Music] try [Music] [Music] [Music] sir [Music] [Music] see [Music] [Applause] [Music] see [Music] see [Music] once again Oh [Music] [Music] see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] on the promises of God [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and God bless [Music] you [Music]
