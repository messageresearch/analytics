[21:32] [Laughter]
[21:35] hallelujah that's the only way to sing
[21:37] it like you really believe it either
[21:40] I believe it praise the Lord God is good
[21:44] to us I'm just gonna get right into the
[21:47] word of the Lord I think that that
[21:49] that's a beautiful song I've always
[21:52] liked it I could remember the first time
[21:54] I heard it was that Jarrell Hughes's in
[21:57] South Carolina on Polk Street Amen a
[22:01] sister with the guitar sang that song
[22:03] and I've loved it ever since
[22:06] Amen Psalms 19
[22:18] one through six thank you those of you
[22:25] who pray for us while my wife and I were
[22:27] on a trip it was also a mission God
[22:32] really blessed and gave me peace was
[22:37] what I needed to know surely I thank God
[22:39] for His grace I don't know how I'm going
[22:42] to minister this message I don't know
[22:44] how I just hope and trust it God give
[22:49] you understanding because to me it's
[22:53] it's really something I'm seeing and I'm
[22:55] it's been really unfolding I was talking
[22:57] to brother Craig yesterday and I said I
[22:59] don't even know how to bring this
[23:00] revelation out the thing that I'm
[23:02] looking at the thing that I'm seeing I
[23:04] really don't know how and I just trust
[23:06] that somehow God will quicken it to you
[23:09] amen tonight I'll be ministering on this
[23:12] tonight and Sunday as well so we just
[23:16] want to take our time by God's grace
[23:19] Psalms 19 I'm glad to see but I wasn't
[23:22] thinking he was gonna be here I'm
[23:23] surprised to hear that voice Psalms 19:1
[23:27] through six
[23:28] they heavens declare the glory of God
[23:30] and the firmament showeth his handiwork
[23:34] day unto day uttereth speech and night
[23:37] unto night short knowledge there is no
[23:41] speech nor language where their voice is
[23:44] not heard their line is going out
[23:48] through all the earth and their works
[23:50] words their words to the end of the
[23:54] world in them have he set a tabernacle
[23:58] for the Sun which is as a bridegroom
[24:02] coming out of his chamber and rejoicing
[24:06] as a strong man to run a race his going
[24:10] forth is from the end of the heaven and
[24:12] his circuit unto the ends of it and
[24:15] there is nothing here from the heat
[24:19] there let us pray father God we come
[24:22] before you as humbly as we know how and
[24:26] we thank you for being so good to us
[24:29] you have been better to us
[24:31] then we have been to ourselves Lord
[24:34] there is no way to explain you even
[24:38] though we have the word your word here
[24:40] we can take the scripture from Scripture
[24:43] and line upon line and precept upon
[24:46] precept but Lord still with all of that
[24:49] we cannot be educated into you Father we
[24:53] realize that this word come by
[24:56] revelation you choose the individuals
[24:59] that you desire to reveal yourself to
[25:02] and father I pray that your grace will
[25:05] be with us tonight and through your word
[25:07] and by your word you will reveal
[25:10] yourself to us more and more Lord in
[25:13] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[25:16] you may be seated you know I stand in a
[25:28] position tonight I think about the world
[25:32] at large and I think about this song
[25:37] David is singing how David as we said
[25:45] before which that thought came
[25:47] originally from brother rich how the
[25:52] word and David was so close that God
[25:55] took those songs that he sang in those
[25:58] prayers that he prayed and made him his
[26:03] word and I thought by God's grace about
[26:07] a union of course I've been thinking
[26:08] about this Union before I heard that
[26:11] because I realized one thing that it has
[26:14] to be a union everything must go back to
[26:18] its original state and form you and I
[26:21] must understand that what we are now
[26:24] experiencing in this fallen world was
[26:27] not what God created we are looking at a
[26:31] perversion and be honest with you when
[26:34] you were born into this world you were
[26:36] born a perverted being you were not the
[26:42] way God intended you to be
[26:43] from the
[26:44] Guinea God is a holy God he's a
[26:48] righteous God it's ways the Bible says a
[26:52] pass finding out but I thought about a
[26:56] maggot you don't know what a maggot is
[26:58] it's dead nasty little thing that
[27:00] everybody screams and squirmed about
[27:02] when they see them it's one of those
[27:06] disgusting things that you and I know
[27:10] exist and I was thinking about that
[27:13] magnet maggot and I thought to myself
[27:15] Lord without your grace that's what I am
[27:21] I'm a just nasty squirmy little thing
[27:24] that hatched out of a dump a dump out a
[27:28] pile of dung and yet your mercy and your
[27:33] grace chose me and chose me to be
[27:38] transformed into something that I cannot
[27:40] even imagine what it's going to be like
[27:44] Paul tried to give us an example or some
[27:49] kind of heads-up and he says I have not
[27:51] seen no is a heard nor have entered into
[27:55] the hearts of a man
[27:57] I heard that brother Jesse preached on
[28:01] the seed and and and you know I know and
[28:05] can you imagine if that little you know
[28:09] read would see could think see how small
[28:14] it is and know that the only way that he
[28:18] could have actually become what he he is
[28:20] is that they had to have been a fire
[28:23] because that's why those trees burned
[28:26] the way they doing when they do burn
[28:27] they set forth those seeds but that seed
[28:30] can't imagine can you imagine he looks
[28:33] up at that tree and it can't even see
[28:34] them can't even see the end of it but by
[28:38] faith that seed can say that's me
[28:41] and that's the way I look at this
[28:44] ourselves the kind of being or the kind
[28:49] of creation that God is creating you and
[28:52] I can't even imagine we don't even know
[28:55] what a word body is we can't even
[28:58] imagine what a glorified body is all we
[29:01] have been used to is this old nasty
[29:03] thing that covers us now that imprison
[29:06] us to us our spirits sometimes but we
[29:12] know that there is a union and you know
[29:17] Bible says that even the heavens and the
[29:19] earth declare of his glory therefore
[29:21] amen
[29:22] Psalms is saying take the son for an
[29:24] example everybody know about the Sun
[29:28] that Sun goes around it's a journey and
[29:31] as a journey travels the same path every
[29:35] day never gets out of order and never is
[29:38] late always on time
[29:42] the Bible tells us amen his going forth
[29:46] is from the end of the heaven and his
[29:48] circuit unto the ends of it and there is
[29:50] nothing here from the heat thereof and
[29:53] we see Amen that this son is so faithful
[29:57] I love that because that son is a type
[30:00] of Christ that son is a type of the
[30:03] creator hello
[30:04] without the son everything dies right
[30:08] and that circuit Amen it's a constant
[30:11] the moon the stars you know in reality
[30:14] there is no such thing as a falling star
[30:16] even so we even though we said it's a
[30:19] meteor or some type of rock passing
[30:21] through because a star has been ordained
[30:24] to stay in this place it cannot fall but
[30:28] you said what the Bible says they've
[30:29] been the stars of heaven shall fall a
[30:31] man but you must understand that at that
[30:35] time a man there will be a flipping of
[30:38] the earth and of course you know you
[30:41] look at that and you say well what do
[30:42] you mean when the earth start moving it
[30:44] up will appear that the sons of the
[30:46] stars are falling but nevertheless
[30:50] whether it's that or not I want you to
[30:52] understand that God will interpret his
[30:53] own word and at the end of the day you
[30:58] and I the Bible said the heaven and the
[31:00] earth shall pass away but the word of
[31:03] the Lord shall stand when we talk about
[31:07] movie I love the scripture the Bible
[31:10] says in him we live
[31:12] and in him we move and in him we have
[31:15] all being even a man they said even as
[31:20] the poet has said Paul is literally
[31:24] quoting a poet and making that poet
[31:28] words scripture and we find out by the
[31:33] grace of God he's saying something
[31:34] that's far more magnificent that our
[31:37] minds can't conceive and that's why this
[31:40] way is my faith if we look at ourselves
[31:45] in there's no way that we can see
[31:48] ourselves fit for heaven some of us even
[31:51] feel like we're not even worthy of Earth
[31:53] but the Word of God tells us that this
[31:56] world is not worthy of us how can you
[32:00] figure it out because you and I must
[32:04] understand how beginning never was
[32:08] we always was with him and he is eternal
[32:13] when we talk about Amen Union when we
[32:17] talk about uniting with God in his
[32:20] creation I think about that there was a
[32:22] time there was a union when God created
[32:26] Adam he created Adam in a way that he
[32:30] could unite with the creation out of new
[32:33] when the birds start tweeting he knew
[32:36] and understand the language the birds
[32:39] understood his language
[32:41] all animals understood adam and adam
[32:44] understood it through all the animals
[32:47] hallelujah right there was a union there
[32:50] was a uniting that God had established
[32:52] in the beginning and that same union
[32:57] comes by way of a new birth y'all hear
[33:02] what I'm saying you see you said what do
[33:04] you mean you and I must understand that
[33:06] Jesus tried to teach his disciples who
[33:09] they really were and he told them I knew
[33:11] you and you were with me before the
[33:13] foundation of the world now you have
[33:16] been sprinkling amnesia you don't know
[33:17] who you are so I'm here to make you
[33:19] understand who you are
[33:21] and I want you to look at me carefully
[33:23] now because my life is the life of what
[33:29] a man should be so you don't know what
[33:32] you should be but I am the literal life
[33:35] is that right John said he was the light
[33:38] of men
[33:40] he was the revelation of what a man
[33:42] should be hallelujah when God created
[33:46] that man God and that man was one is
[33:50] that right
[33:50] Adam and God was one when you saw Adam
[33:54] you saw God not Olivia had him did the
[33:57] things of God Adam talked about God Adam
[34:00] did everything God would do when he
[34:02] stood upright as a man there's only
[34:07] after he became a fallen tree that he
[34:12] began to do otherwise but as he stood as
[34:16] a when he as long as he stood up as that
[34:18] holy tree of God they met he did the
[34:20] theme that God wanted him to do he did
[34:23] not have to ask God Lord is this what
[34:26] you want me to do see because really
[34:29] even though there wasn't it does say the
[34:31] Lord
[34:32] Adam was Lord he was the lord of his
[34:36] creation and God was the lord of Adam
[34:40] there was a union there was no breach
[34:44] there was no fussing there was no
[34:46] argument when he got the inspiration I
[34:48] understand there's a brother branham
[34:50] saying he said a prophet must live by
[34:52] inspiration hallelujah he can read the
[34:56] word but that were yes excuse me
[34:59] must come to life it must be inspired
[35:04] that's how we read this Bible but this
[35:08] Bible must be inspired it must come off
[35:12] the pages it must live tea with you by
[35:15] revelation hmm you say well what do you
[35:20] mean brother Brooke so like so you can
[35:22] understand there was no scripture for
[35:27] Elijah to throw a piece of wood in a
[35:32] river for exhale
[35:34] the floats there was an inspiration that
[35:39] was not there in a book or scroll but he
[35:43] was so in tune with God he was united
[35:46] with God that he and God was really one
[35:49] he said what do you mean I'm trying to
[35:52] give somewhere see you must understand
[35:55] that if the moon the stars and all these
[35:57] things keep that place we supposed to
[35:59] keep our place right this is what the
[36:03] holiest of holies about once you go into
[36:06] the Holies of Holies you should pull the
[36:08] curtain behind you so you'll always be
[36:11] there and never lose your place or
[36:13] position is that right
[36:16] that's what brother Ram said he said if
[36:17] when we go in there he said let God
[36:20] close the curtains behind us stay there
[36:23] because that's your original position
[36:28] when you're talking about uniting you
[36:31] talk about taking two parts and making
[36:33] one sometimes they come by fusion which
[36:38] means fire you know how people wear
[36:40] things together and they take the same
[36:42] piece of metal and they fuse it together
[36:43] amen it becomes one piece of metal
[36:47] there's different places there's a
[36:50] different process and these things these
[36:52] things takes a process you understand
[36:55] what I mean so what do you mean brother
[36:57] books listen let me sit like this as a
[36:59] husband and wife comes together there is
[37:01] a fusion of his sperm and her egg and
[37:06] they become one right and that's the way
[37:11] it is supposed to be with us but in a
[37:15] super natural way now
[37:19] you said what why why what what do you
[37:21] mean see that's what's so important
[37:23] because the Holy Ghost justifies you the
[37:27] Holy Ghost sanctifies you right and the
[37:31] Holy Ghost baptize you but listen John
[37:34] said he shall come with Holy Ghost and
[37:37] fire so when the fire comes it changes
[37:41] your composition hallelujah to your very
[37:47] nature change
[37:48] from adaptable nature to a holy nature
[37:54] you and I we will be united with
[38:00] something you go to new unites with
[38:05] something because God even put a place
[38:08] in your heart that must be filled and
[38:14] it's going to be filled either with God
[38:17] or the devil things of the world
[38:21] hallelujah
[38:22] it's going to happen see the thing is
[38:25] with this matter you cannot be neutral
[38:30] hallelujah see there is no purgatory if
[38:33] it is this must be happening right now
[38:35] you got heaven or hell and you and I
[38:41] must understand by God's grace you don't
[38:43] get a second chance after this that's
[38:48] why I love God because he's original one
[38:52] thing the devil messed up he didn't
[38:55] understand that God had already signed
[38:57] sealed and delivered his package before
[38:59] it even came to existence God knew you
[39:05] and I was going to thirst out to him he
[39:09] knew and what did he do he placed a seed
[39:12] on the inside of you come on somebody
[39:15] because he knew one day he had a date
[39:18] with you he knew by God's grace like
[39:22] like Esther Esther had to go into the
[39:24] king chamber there's a lot of women who
[39:27] went in with God and came out like
[39:28] concubine but when Esther came in he
[39:33] knew she was his match
[39:36] they were compatible he was a very she
[39:40] was the very woman he was looking for Oh
[39:44] somehow it just happened no sir God
[39:48] orchestrated it hallelujah I don't know
[39:52] exactly how God felt about at our vast
[39:55] time but if I could look at what that
[39:57] little seer has come to be I can see
[39:59] that God didn't like
[40:00] well God had to put our way out of the
[40:04] width with divorcement and said I'm
[40:05] gonna get me somebody else right
[40:07] we don't even know whatever happened to
[40:09] master I do y'all know if we take the
[40:11] system we know that God killed him
[40:13] somewhere he's gonna put death there
[40:16] right notice you might be feeling one
[40:22] thing over another you say brother man
[40:25] I'm kind of on the fence you not the
[40:28] Bible plainly say that all that was not
[40:30] sealed with the Holy Ghost received the
[40:32] mark of the beast
[40:34] zip y'all understand that I don't think
[40:36] people in this message understand it you
[40:39] don't have an option about the Holy
[40:42] Ghost if you're not sealed with the Holy
[40:45] Ghost you will receive the block of the
[40:48] Beast
[40:51] help us Jesus how I know I got the mark
[41:01] of the beast when you argue with the
[41:03] truth huh you say how can you say when
[41:09] you are going through what did Cain do
[41:11] Cain argued with the truth and God
[41:15] mocked him and everybody that argued
[41:20] with the truth of this day is mocked
[41:27] come on somebody we're talking about a
[41:31] union we're talking about letting God do
[41:35] his work in us and I'm gonna tell you
[41:37] something you the only one that could
[41:39] keep him from doing it because God is a
[41:43] gentleman he's not going to force you
[41:46] into anything
[41:48] hallelujah he ain't gonna force you to
[41:51] make love with him hallelujah
[41:54] he wants to romance you you say God
[41:57] wants to remain you absolutely
[42:02] songs of Solomon tells us that that's
[42:05] why I put a little bit that in my
[42:07] service probably something because
[42:09] Psalms of Solomon loved his this lady
[42:11] more than he said I'm gonna find you
[42:13] only wherever you
[42:14] I'm looking for you she said don't worry
[42:16] about it because I'm looking for you too
[42:18] [Laughter]
[42:19] hallelujah that's how you know you got
[42:22] God because you're always looking for
[42:24] him you want to find your beloved whoo
[42:28] even if it's me I gotta go out late at
[42:31] night hallelujah
[42:32] you know what that means that means I
[42:33] got a all-night prayer I'm gonna find
[42:35] you see I like to test it just a little
[42:40] bit and see where we're standing
[42:43] oh the mocking B's remember is a
[42:45] religious Lord certainly is you might be
[42:49] filled with religion you you could have
[42:51] all kinds of religion that doesn't
[42:53] happen that doesn't save you at all you
[42:56] can just be a religious fanatic if you
[43:00] want to be touch not taste not handle
[43:02] not smell not that don't that don't have
[43:06] one thing to do with the Holy Ghost you
[43:12] might be fear with a bunch of malice you
[43:14] might be filled with a bunch of
[43:16] prejudice or so full that you can't even
[43:19] sit and hear one sermon preached you
[43:23] might be filled with a lot of hatred you
[43:25] you despise everybody that don't agree
[43:27] with you you might be filled with a lot
[43:30] of nonsense too
[43:31] you might be filled with a lot of out
[43:33] the golfing dirty jokes you must let so
[43:36] much that you you think too much much of
[43:39] that you won't go to church on Wednesday
[43:41] night or something you might be filled
[43:43] without refreshing a rock and roll
[43:45] that's true I was telling somebody the
[43:48] other night the other day a friend of
[43:50] mine he asked me how do you like this
[43:52] music and I said let me ask you
[43:55] something do you believe that music you
[43:57] listening to will be played in heaven
[44:00] and he said no I see that's right
[44:04] let thy will be done in earth as it is
[44:07] in heaven if you can't live or do in
[44:10] your living what you're doing during the
[44:12] daytime if it can't be done in heaven
[44:13] you don't need to do it y'all hear me as
[44:18] you do come on somebody let that will be
[44:22] done in earth as it is in heaven
[44:25] if you can't do what you're doing in
[44:27] heaven
[44:28] leave it alone ooh well you don't have
[44:35] to be that way Christ died that you
[44:37] might be cleanse from all those things
[44:39] you might be filled with a bunch of
[44:41] trees you might be filled with a bunch
[44:43] of denomination but God don't want you
[44:45] feel with that God made a place in there
[44:48] to put himself in God wants you to be
[44:53] filled with himself
[44:54] yeah you mean ah God whatever you gotta
[44:58] do feel me hallelujah what take place

[45:21] with long-suffering with goodness with
[45:24] meekness with gentleness with worship
[45:28] you filled with joy huh
[45:32] you filled with something and when you
[45:36] feel with man's ideas if you filled with
[45:38] churchianity if you feel weak read if
[45:41] you're only building yourself a Babylon
[45:44] that's got to fall if you fill yourself
[45:46] up with a modern world if you feel
[45:48] yourself up with lust if you feel
[45:50] yourself up with pride if you feel
[45:52] yourself up with denomination you're
[45:54] lost there's only one way to endure that
[45:59] is to put the original thing that God
[46:01] made that compartment in your heart to
[46:03] be filled with and that was the Holy
[46:06] Ghost
[46:07] that's on the way there is no other way
[46:10] folks no other way hallelujah is that
[46:14] Alright st. John 13:34 335 says a new
[46:18] commandment I give it to you that you
[46:20] love one another as I have loved you
[46:22] that you also love one another is that
[46:26] the word but this year all men know that
[46:29] you are my disciples if you have loved
[46:31] one toward another hallelujah if God is
[46:34] in you the Bible said not only will you
[46:36] love one another but you have the
[46:38] ability and you will even love your
[46:40] enemy
[46:43] the Bible says he said if you hated your

[49:26] allowing the devil amen to preach to me

[54:45] disappearing all that stuff to believe
[54:47] God I believe God cuz it's water here
[54:51] you know another reason why I believe
[54:53] God cuz I exist and I know because I
[54:57] just he does because I did not create
[55:00] myself and neither can I change myself
[55:03] but I know that there's an invisible
[55:05] force that's been able to change me when
[55:08] I couldn't even change myself by because
[55:12] of unity uniting with him standing in
[55:16] the fire burning all of the sin in a and
[55:19] the dross out of me
[55:21] consuming my worldliness lusting
[55:24] everything consuming it
[55:26] and at the same time allowing me to live
[55:30] who could do that say well yes III think
[55:37] about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in
[55:39] the in the fiery furnace as a high in
[55:41] the earth - David how how how how did
[55:44] they survive the fire because the fire
[55:47] and the man in the fire became one Union
[55:52] United hallelujah and the Bible said it
[55:56] was so powerful they didn't even have a
[55:57] smell of fire smoke on them talk to me
[56:01] somebody you know that's what I'm
[56:03] talking about that kind of a union that
[56:06] if God said Philip I want you to go to
[56:08] the desert hallelujah Phil it won't have
[56:11] to say Lord I don't have a plane ticket
[56:12] Lord I don't have a bus ticket he said

[56:24] are the kinds of things that we will
[56:26] experience before we leave here where
[56:29] the man said before the rapture come
[56:30] there would be a final outpouring of the
[56:32] Holy Ghost that's what he said that's
[56:37] gonna keep this what's gonna lift us
[56:38] people look at a final outpouring
[56:45] there will be a final output how many
[56:48] needed I need it I need it I believe it
[56:53] I'm looking forward oh yes that's God's
[57:01] grace brother
[57:03] hallelujah is that what he said in the
[57:06] Sears book God is not going to do this
[57:08] because we've been so good he's doing it
[57:10] because of His grace
[57:13] huh
[57:14] he's giving us this thing because of
[57:16] grace hallelujah oh thank God for grace
[57:21] yeah oh yeah remember that little story
[57:29] amen about that
[57:32] man who had those apples that
[57:36] Yellowjackets would eat brother band
[57:38] colouring infidel made mockery and font
[57:42] out of other Branham across brother
[57:45] woods brought him to go hunting say
[57:47] brother woods you don't got became such
[57:48] a low-down person you've got to carry
[57:50] your preacher which he's your security
[57:55] to make sure you do right brother
[57:58] hallelujah brother branham you know how
[58:03] it goes he found out this man is the
[58:05] infidel and he says yeah and this guy
[58:07] says and then you say you never seen God
[58:09] brother bear I'm talking he says well
[58:10] that's that's just nature he said that's
[58:13] right and so this man is bragging you
[58:15] know all these preachers I've seen the
[58:17] hypocrisy of it ain't nothing to them
[58:20] now he but there's one thing in his mind
[58:22] he remember there's one man who told
[58:24] these women amen about their illness and
[58:27] how they were gonna be healed in all
[58:28] these games and he says you know I I
[58:30] heard he said one day he's one night he
[58:32] said there was screaming and hollering
[58:34] up there on the hill he said I was going
[58:36] getting ready to go up there cuz I
[58:37] thought the lady's head and I he said by
[58:40] the time I got up there she was in the
[58:42] kitchen cooking so he witnessed a
[58:46] miracle right and he said not that's one
[58:52] preacher I like to I like to come to
[58:54] know and brother Woods before in the
[58:56] television not right now not right now

[59:07] the places like this one guy was
[59:09] Catholic I don't know what the other guy
[59:10] was but I was justified how the Lord
[59:12] heals and it just you know and I could
[59:14] tell something's going on because he got
[59:16] really quiet like they didn't want to
[59:17] hear it I'm like please this is my god
[59:19] you gonna hear this because you had you
[59:21] in my space don't get too close to me
[59:24] you in my space that's what the devil
[59:29] wants you to stop praising God
[59:32] when you sit some people don't want to
[59:35] hear it
[59:36] if Jeremiah had paid attention to what
[59:39] people was feeling he was never preached
[59:43] but when God
[59:44] get you in a place and the people don't
[59:46] want to hear it that means you dare to
[59:48] stand as a witness right so anyway I
[59:52] don't mean to look at you you know it's
[59:55] like this when you and I realized him
[59:57] and that everything moving by the power
[1:00:00] of God we sing that song everything
[1:00:03] moving by the power of God I rose this
[1:00:06] morning but I'm walking I'm talking

[1:00:12] God I have nothing of my own hallelujah
[1:00:15] y'all know that before God
[1:00:19] there was nothing before God don't you
[1:00:22] understand that God created the air that
[1:00:25] you breathe because he knew you was
[1:00:27] gonna need it
[1:00:29] hallelujah water everything he created
[1:00:33] for us God did meet this God was this
[1:00:40] but ever had to beauty he pulled out he
[1:00:43] had you and I in mine
[1:00:47] hallelujah you say what do you mean let
[1:00:50] me tell you something those theophanies
[1:00:52] don't need to breathe and neither do
[1:00:53] they need to eat cuz of you eat you
[1:00:58] gotta breathe huh and I'm bad I don't
[1:01:03] sleep well what do you mean the Bible
[1:01:07] said God never sleep nor slumber
[1:01:10] halleluiah he don't need these old

[1:18:54] out the image of God fairly I severely I
[1:19:01] said to you the son himself the
[1:19:03] tabernacle of God dwell in his body
[1:19:05] the son can do nothing in himself but
[1:19:08] what he sees the father doing that doeth
[1:19:10] the son likewise right for an example
[1:19:13] you go buy a coke you ain't going to the
[1:19:16] stove for the bottle it ain't the
[1:19:19] problem that's called coke it's what's
[1:19:21] in the bottle called coke and that's it
[1:19:29] it was what was in the bottle of Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ was God the bottle could break
[1:19:37] the bottle died but the substance that
[1:19:41] was in him could never die that's why
[1:19:45] God don't give you two souls one got to
[1:19:48] die and when the true soul of God comes
[1:19:51] in you you're not I'm there Brooks of
[1:19:53] natural and God of spiritual you're
[1:19:56] actually God in human flesh oh I can't
[1:20:00] say it that's why we can't stop til we
[1:20:03] see the very little life of God living
[1:20:06] in us don't you stop beat you fight

[1:20:26] ordained for me to whip you is that
[1:20:29] right Paul said with more than couplers
[1:20:32] who Christ Caesar
[1:20:33] hallelujah no devil no grave can hold my
[1:20:37] body down nothing can stop us now why
[1:20:41] because of the life of Christ it ain't
[1:20:44] us is him when that Sun comes up he
[1:20:49] meant all of the darkness don't fee at
[1:20:51] all at one time he grabbed

[1:20:55] that darkness scatters hallelujah and
[1:20:58] watch it brothers and sisters as the

[1:21:09] stay in your life read this quote and
[1:21:18] we'll stop here it is the only grounds

[1:21:25] down for himself in the church is the
[1:21:28] oneness of himself in the people woo
[1:21:31] that's the only ground of fellowship the
[1:21:35] only way that you can have those are
[1:21:39] grounds is by Union to be united with
[1:21:42] him forever
[1:21:44] just like when you unite with your
[1:21:46] husband the woman to unite with her
[1:21:48] husband it is a vow unto death now then
[1:21:53] when you unite with God it's the same
[1:21:55] thing that the church unites with Christ
[1:21:59] is until death we part and then if you
[1:22:03] never sin or do anything wrong you'll be
[1:22:06] eternally United with God and the only
[1:22:09] death can take you away from God and not
[1:22:11] physically death but the sin of death
[1:22:14] sin is death and that takes you away
[1:22:16] from God so to be united with him in the
[1:22:20] spirit of his power is eternal life and
[1:22:22] your return you've eternal life
[1:22:25] eternally United with God he said oh I
[1:22:28] want to get to that altar being United
[1:22:32] eternally with the eternal God perfectly
[1:22:36] in harmony with him perfectly United
[1:22:39] together a church that all both God and
[1:22:42] His Church is one United together see
[1:22:45] you said what do you mean that's what we
[1:22:47] talked about we talked about growing up
[1:22:48] into him when that full statue of Christ
[1:22:51] is now developed in you amen you are
[1:22:53] totally totally United with God
[1:22:58] hallelujah and if you notice how that he
[1:23:01] was united with Adam she come part of
[1:23:03] him now if I'm not reading
[1:23:06] with the scripture tell me but this is
[1:23:08] truth yeah I mean this is true if heaven
[1:23:19] is so holy and no unclean thing is going
[1:23:21] to enter in how are you gonna get there
[1:23:24] that's why the Bible said if that see
[1:23:26] remaineth in you you cannot see in when
[1:23:29] that seed is quickening you god don't
[1:23:31] look at you no more he's looking at the
[1:23:33] seed he's watching over that seed like a
[1:23:36] eagle with her egg to make sure that
[1:23:38] seed come to a full maturity so let's
[1:23:40] see B birth and learn how to fly and
[1:23:42] become grown that's what God is all
[1:23:45] about hallelujah God don't forsake his
[1:23:48] seed hallelujah he's always with us
[1:23:51] always will be with us hallelujah is
[1:23:55] that right yeah yeah I know y'all have
[1:23:59] seen trees and apple trees and plum
[1:24:01] trees now one of those plums on that
[1:24:04] tree is exactly alike
[1:24:06] yet they came from the same tree some
[1:24:10] big clump so I'm bigger than the other
[1:24:12] one some smaller than the other with
[1:24:13] some juicy or some sweeter same tree huh
[1:24:20] yo yo see nature today to declare his
[1:24:23] glory you think about all those
[1:24:27] characters that came from Adam and how
[1:24:30] they were because of nature change
[1:24:33] because of the fall in the nature huh
[1:24:36] what about Jacob Jacob didn't look like
[1:24:39] a son he's a rascal
[1:24:44] I look at Tom as I said and I always say
[1:24:48] if Thomas made it I'm gonna make it to
[1:24:52] [Laughter]
[1:24:54] you understand I look at all of these
[1:24:57] people to make love hurt
[1:24:58] Holly knew it you know I'll make many
[1:25:01] mistakes myself but hey come on now
[1:25:03] Solomon did a lot of stuff it's all
[1:25:06] about sitting in the throne where ever
[1:25:08] Solomon is I'll be there too hallelujah
[1:25:10] why his grace not one man is sitting in
[1:25:15] heaven right now because of his works
[1:25:16] everything has been bad grades but Enoch
[1:25:19] was
[1:25:19] translating yes cuz God had favor found
[1:25:22] favor with him why because God gave him
[1:25:24] what he needed that wasn't a work of
[1:25:28] Enoch you know what God we look at that
[1:25:30] like Enoch did it himself hallelujah
[1:25:33] every man man's righteousness is like
[1:25:35] filthy rags to God hallelujah
[1:25:40] don't you know Abel would not have made
[1:25:42] it this God's grace when here was with
[1:25:44] him and revealed unto him the blood
[1:25:46] sacrifice it still was God that's why
[1:25:51] the Bible said blessed is the man who
[1:25:53] hears the sayings and above don't you
[1:25:55] understand this message blesses you it
[1:25:59] blesses you I heard brother Branham
[1:26:05] preaching this morning he said don't you
[1:26:07] worry don't you fear God gonna have him
[1:26:12] a bride God gonna have him a church
[1:26:15] united under one hand hallelujah God
[1:26:19] will have us United
[1:26:22] there ain't no is if the buts about the
[1:26:24] bride will find her proper place and she
[1:26:28] will humble herself to the word and then
[1:26:30] we'll take a rapture he's you know what
[1:26:33] he said he said you know God might have
[1:26:36] to use persecution to bring us all
[1:26:37] together I don't care let it be so I'm
[1:26:43] all for that because the closer we get
[1:26:46] to get each other and the more unifying
[1:26:48] we get to each other the closer we are
[1:26:50] to home going home amen whoo ah Lord
[1:26:55] Lord see we don't see that great picture
[1:26:58] we're in the flesh our difference we're
[1:27:01] like a by-product a created being by
[1:27:04] holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons
[1:27:07] and daughters not some other spirit but
[1:27:10] the Spirit of the Living God we are in
[1:27:13] his likeness in his unity in the perfect
[1:27:17] image of the Living God because we
[1:27:19] become sons and daughters not separate
[1:27:22] but the same spirit the same God the
[1:27:25] same person join in well our to the
[1:27:28] eternal well see how God planned it
[1:27:33] we should be not a different but him not
[1:27:37] some other being of some other tribe but
[1:27:41] a real union in all spring of the
[1:27:43] almighty done by a holy union not the
[1:27:47] body comes from a mother a father but
[1:27:50] the spirit comes from God God separating
[1:27:54] himself as Adam was separated whoa
[1:27:56] listen one day of Pentecost we find the
[1:28:00] Holy Ghost the appeal of fire separating
[1:28:02] himself and setting upon each member of
[1:28:04] that church God putting himself together
[1:28:08] whoo hear what he said God putting
[1:28:11] himself together then with that group of
[1:28:14] the people together what does he do
[1:28:16] bring back the unified party of the Lord
[1:28:18] Jesus
[1:28:19] he says coming together that's what the
[1:28:24] Holy Ghost does it brings God back
[1:28:26] together hallelujah
[1:28:28] he broke it and he said one day that
[1:28:31] Brady say one day you understand this
[1:28:33] you remember me but now God has taken
[1:28:36] them pieces and bringing them back
[1:28:37] together hallelujah
[1:28:39] back to one body hallelujah I'm not
[1:28:42] doing but I finished I I keep working on
[1:28:44] this I've said to myself I said Lord I
[1:28:47] said I want to bring something because
[1:28:49] you know I look at the supernatural I
[1:28:52] look at him you know Peter James and
[1:28:56] John and you take for instance let's go
[1:28:58] back to this first of all you know when
[1:29:00] Paul was on his way to admit to Damascus
[1:29:01] and he was going to persecute the
[1:29:03] Christian and of course the light shine
[1:29:04] from heaven and and then Paul asked Lord
[1:29:07] who our Lord and he said Jesus Paul had
[1:29:12] never seen it Paul had never heard his
[1:29:15] voice but that day Paul knew that Jesus
[1:29:20] wasn't just one man anymore he was not
[1:29:27] just one man he was a member of my of my
[1:29:30] what it was a multi-member body and
[1:29:37] think about all those ones that he blast
[1:29:39] calls a blaspheme and put to death and
[1:29:41] Jesus was still living
