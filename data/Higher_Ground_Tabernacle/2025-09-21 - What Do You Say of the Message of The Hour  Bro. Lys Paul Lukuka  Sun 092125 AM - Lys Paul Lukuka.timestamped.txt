[56:23] Amen.
[56:25] When the redeemed are gathering in,
[56:28] you know, the message of the hour came
[56:30] to redeem us back to the positions of
[56:32] sons and daughters of God. You know, and
[56:35] how many are happy to be in the house of
[56:36] the Lord this morning.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] Let's open our Bibles to the book of
[56:44] John, chapter 14. Thank you for the
[56:46] songs and the
[56:55] And about the when the redeemed are
[56:57] gathered in the Bible says that wherever
[56:59] two or three are gathered
[57:02] in his name he's going to be there. So
[57:05] when the redeemed gather that brings the
[57:07] presence of Jesus.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; John chapter 14 verse 18 to 19
[57:19] The Bible says, "I will not leave you
[57:22] comfortless. I will come to you yet a
[57:25] little while and the world seeth me no
[57:28] more. But ye, the redeemed will see me,
[57:32] because I leave, you shall live also."
[57:43] And let's turn to Matthew 16.
[57:48] verse 13 to 20
[57:55] &gt;&gt; the Bible says when Jesus when Jesus
[57:57] came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi
[58:00] he asked his disciples saying whom do m
[58:04] whom do whom do men say that I the son
[58:07] of man am?
[58:16] And they said, "Some say there are John
[58:18] the Baptist, some Elias, and others
[58:21] Jeremiah's and or one of the prophets."
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "But whom say ye
[58:32] that I am?"
[58:36] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[58:39] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[58:41] God.
[58:45] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[58:47] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[58:50] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[58:52] thee, but my father which is in heaven."
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and
[59:10] upon this rock I will build my church,
[59:12] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[59:14] against it.
[59:23] Amen. Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[59:28] come before you this morning in your
[59:29] precious name.
[59:33] the the only name that we can pray to,
[59:35] Lord.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; The only name in which you have placed a
[59:41] the place of worship, Lord,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; the name in which we are saved,
[59:49] the name by which we have our
[59:51] redemption,
[59:53] the name that has been raised above all
[59:56] names.
[59:58] That father at the mention of the name
[1:00:00] of Jesus Christ every knee shall bow.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Lord that's why I mention your name this
[1:00:07] morning
[1:00:09] because father we want every knee to bow
[1:00:10] this morning
[1:00:12] so that you may have the preeminence.
[1:00:15] Lord Jesus forgive us of our
[1:00:16] shortcomings.
[1:00:18] Wash us with your blood Lord Jesus. And
[1:00:21] father Lord you know why your children
[1:00:23] came this morning.
[1:00:25] Lord, they worked all week.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, they could have just decided to
[1:00:29] stay home and rest today.
[1:00:32] But they came here, Lord, to hear from
[1:00:34] you, Lord Jesus.
[1:00:36] They did not come to hear from me, but
[1:00:38] to hear from the God who created them.
[1:00:41] Lord Jesus, I pray that you, Father,
[1:00:43] Lord God, uh, uh, give them what they
[1:00:46] what they came to hear.
[1:00:50] I pray, Father Lord, that you speak to
[1:00:52] their hearts,
[1:00:54] that you hear through their ears.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And Father Lord, I submit myself to you
[1:00:58] as well, Lord Jesus.
[1:01:01] Lord, I give everything that I am unto
[1:01:03] you and have your own way, Lord Jesus.
[1:01:09] And I bind every spirit of unbelief in
[1:01:11] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:13] And I pray that you anoint the word,
[1:01:15] Lord Jesus,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says it's the
[1:01:18] anointing that breaks the yolks.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want we want the yolks to be
[1:01:23] broken this morning, Lord Jesus. In the
[1:01:26] name of Jesus Christ, I pray.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And may you may have your seats.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; My title this morning is going to be,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; what do you say of the message of the
[1:01:41] hour?
[1:01:47] Or I can say what do you see in the
[1:01:50] message of the hour?
[1:01:52] You know when someone says when someone
[1:01:54] says I believe the message of the hour
[1:01:58] when someone says I am a message
[1:02:00] believer.
[1:02:04] What does that mean? Remember the
[1:02:06] question that Jesus asked Peter
[1:02:10] at first he was like what do other
[1:02:11] people say?
[1:02:16] Peter said that oh some say that you are
[1:02:18] Elias or other Jeremiah or this and that
[1:02:21] or one of the prophets
[1:02:23] you know Jesus didn't stop there.
[1:02:26] Then he he's like okay but let's not ask
[1:02:28] about what other people say of me about
[1:02:31] you.
[1:02:35] Whom say you that I am?
[1:02:39] The Bible tells us that Jesus is the
[1:02:41] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I was reading a place where the prophet
[1:02:46] says that the same Jesus that walked on
[1:02:48] Galilee is the same Jesus Christ tonight
[1:02:50] in the brand tabernacle.
[1:02:55] And I also say that same Jesus Christ
[1:02:57] that was in the brand tabernacle is the
[1:02:59] same Jesus Christ here this morning.
[1:03:04] And Jesus the same way he asked Peter,
[1:03:07] he's also asking you this morning this
[1:03:09] morning, what do you say of the message
[1:03:11] of the hour?
[1:03:13] What is your revelation of the message
[1:03:15] of the hour?
[1:03:17] A lot of people they just we just come
[1:03:19] and we just say, "Oh, I believe the
[1:03:20] message."
[1:03:23] But what is truly the message?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because it's a it's a it's a
[1:03:30] revelation.
[1:03:32] Because Jesus said to Peter that flesh
[1:03:35] and blood has not revealed this to you.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; So you have to understand that godly
[1:03:41] things are not revealed by flesh and
[1:03:42] blood.
[1:03:47] They are revealed by God himself.
[1:03:50] That's why you got to make sure you have
[1:03:52] a good connection with God.
[1:03:57] You got to make sure you have a good
[1:03:58] fellowship communion with God.
[1:04:03] because only then that he can reveal to
[1:04:05] you his who who truly this messages.
[1:04:11] That's the question I ask everyone this
[1:04:13] morning including myself.
[1:04:17] If someone came to you was like I I've
[1:04:19] always heard I'm a message believer.
[1:04:21] What does that mean?
[1:04:27] What are you going to tell that person?
[1:04:30] Are you going to say, "Oh, let me call
[1:04:31] Brother Brooks and ask him a little
[1:04:32] bit."
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; What if that person only had five? You
[1:04:39] were, for instance, a nurse at a
[1:04:41] hospital
[1:04:46] or in your workplace
[1:04:48] or wherever you may be, you may be
[1:04:49] walking on the street and someone had an
[1:04:51] accident and you go to hell, the person
[1:04:53] is like,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; "I've always heard people talk about the
[1:04:57] message of the hour.
[1:05:02] You know, I only have a few minutes left
[1:05:03] on earth.
[1:05:06] What is the message of the hour? What
[1:05:08] are you going to tell that person?
[1:05:12] Cuz the message has to be reflected in
[1:05:13] you.
[1:05:15] You don't have to wait to to to start
[1:05:17] calling your your father, your mother to
[1:05:19] say, "Oh, what is the message?"
[1:05:23] So we see that Jesus got to a place and
[1:05:25] he asked his disciple whom do others
[1:05:27] says that that that I am.
[1:05:33] You know you noticed what others were
[1:05:35] saying was not the true revelation of
[1:05:37] who Jesus Christ was.
[1:05:44] The true revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:05:45] had was something that was personally
[1:05:47] revealed to Peter.
[1:05:52] You can never have the revelation of
[1:05:54] this message to what other people are
[1:05:56] saying of this message.
[1:06:01] You truly know the message of the hour
[1:06:03] when the message of the hour reveals
[1:06:05] itself to you.
[1:06:10] And the message came not just to be
[1:06:12] preached or not just to be said in the
[1:06:14] mouth, but it's to be believed.
[1:06:18] And I I read a place where the prophet
[1:06:19] says the kind of life you live shows the
[1:06:21] kind of revelation you have.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; So many of us says we believe the
[1:06:29] message
[1:06:31] but do we leave the message
[1:06:34] because the Bible Jesus says that if you
[1:06:36] love me you will keep my commandments.
[1:06:40] A lot of usually quotes that that that
[1:06:42] place where the prophet says that God
[1:06:44] says that all you ever loved and all
[1:06:46] that ever loved you, I have given them
[1:06:48] to you.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; But if you truly and that that that's
[1:06:57] that quote is very true. If you truly
[1:06:59] love the prophet or the message of the
[1:07:01] hour,
[1:07:05] what will happen is that you will do
[1:07:07] what the prophet says to do.
[1:07:11] That's why Jesus says that you you are
[1:07:13] known to be my disciples by the love you
[1:07:15] have one towards another
[1:07:20] not by what you say but by by the way
[1:07:23] you act
[1:07:26] no others there different interpretation
[1:07:29] of the message
[1:07:32] and what you notice is that in that
[1:07:34] interpretation one Peter says some says
[1:07:37] you are one of the prophets
[1:07:43] That was true.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You know Jesus was one of the prophets.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But the difference was that that was if
[1:07:53] only Peter the difference is that when
[1:07:56] he says you are one of the prophets that
[1:07:57] was he was just repeating what others
[1:07:59] were saying.
[1:08:05] How do you know the message of the hour
[1:08:06] is real?
[1:08:09] I know it's real, but are you just
[1:08:11] repeating that the message is real
[1:08:13] because people say,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; brothers, the message did not come to
[1:08:17] just say the message is real.
[1:08:20] Leave me a message. The prophet even
[1:08:23] says, I rather have a man pre leave me
[1:08:25] the message than preaching me a message.
[1:08:32] Because you cannot live higher than your
[1:08:34] testimony.
[1:08:39] Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Just bear with me a little bit. I came
[1:08:43] up with this message yesterday. I was
[1:08:45] going to preach something else, but I
[1:08:46] just felt led to go this direction.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus came,
[1:08:55] you know, a lot of them knew that the
[1:08:57] Messiah was supposed to come.
[1:09:01] They were even singing, "My God, my God,
[1:09:03] why have you forsaken me?" in the
[1:09:05] temples,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; in the synagogues,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; but they miss to see that that that that
[1:09:14] prophecy was living in their age.
[1:09:20] Why? Because their eyes were blinded.
[1:09:24] Why? Because the father had not revealed
[1:09:26] who Christ was to them.
[1:09:32] So that that's why in order to to to
[1:09:35] understand what uh in order to um
[1:09:40] because the title the one of the title
[1:09:42] that I title is what do you see in the
[1:09:44] message of the hour but you only know
[1:09:47] the value of the message of the hour or
[1:09:48] what it is if you actually know its
[1:09:50] characteristics.
[1:09:55] You have to know what is the message
[1:09:56] supposed to do.
[1:09:59] What is even the message of the hour?
[1:10:02] When the prophet preached on the message
[1:10:03] the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:06] the prophet says uh what he started by
[1:10:09] preaching what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:10:11] for.
[1:10:15] Why? Because he says that some you have
[1:10:16] to know what you are looking for so that
[1:10:19] you know the value it brings.
[1:10:23] A lot of us don't value the message
[1:10:24] because we don't have the revelation of
[1:10:26] what the message is.
[1:10:33] The message is very important for this
[1:10:35] hour. I'll go through it. You understand
[1:10:38] why it's very important.
[1:10:40] Without the message of the hour, you
[1:10:41] will not make the rapture.
[1:10:44] Without the message of the hour, you
[1:10:46] will stay behind.
[1:10:51] But the message is not a book.
[1:10:54] The message are not tapes.
[1:10:56] The message is the spirits that was on
[1:10:58] the tapes.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; That spirits that was on the tapes
[1:11:03] that's that has to be lived in you.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; You know the the the the devil doesn't
[1:11:10] care if you just quotes the message.
[1:11:13] The devil doesn't care if you just
[1:11:15] quotes the Bible.
[1:11:17] But he's scared when you start seeing
[1:11:19] that that quotes become alive in you.
[1:11:23] If you want to check the devil this
[1:11:24] morning, just start leaving the word.
[1:11:28] Be a witness that God has sent a prophet
[1:11:30] in this generation.
[1:11:34] Don't just say God has sent a prophet,
[1:11:38] but show it by the way you live, by the
[1:11:40] way you dress, by the way you carry
[1:11:43] yourself in the church,
[1:11:46] you know, because this message is a
[1:11:48] message of perfection,
[1:11:50] you know.
[1:11:52] It's a message that when the Bible Paul
[1:11:53] says that we prophesy in part
[1:11:58] but when that which is perfect comes
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; and I was reading a place where the
[1:12:03] prophet says humbly as I can say this is
[1:12:05] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:12:07] of God.
[1:12:11] What is the message of the hour? It's
[1:12:13] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:12:15] of God.
[1:12:16] Don't go look at other places for the
[1:12:18] revelation of the word.
[1:12:21] The revelation of the word is found in
[1:12:23] the message of God.
[1:12:25] Billy Graham doesn't have the me the
[1:12:27] revelation of the word.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could have had a
[1:12:31] revelation in his day,
[1:12:35] but the revelation progresses.
[1:12:39] The message of Luther cannot take you to
[1:12:41] the rapture today.
[1:12:44] The message of Luther will take those in
[1:12:46] Luther's time to the rapture.
[1:12:50] But you you that which is perfect.
[1:12:55] And the word is perfect. The word is
[1:12:57] perfect.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; What does the the Bible in Malachi says?
[1:13:01] He will restore us to the faith of our
[1:13:04] sins.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is a message of
[1:13:09] restoration.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; It's the message that throughout the
[1:13:13] ages the enemy tried to to to kill the
[1:13:16] word of God.
[1:13:20] He tried to kill the influence of the
[1:13:22] word.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; The devil tried to kill the influence of
[1:13:25] the word on the believers.
[1:13:29] But God had promised that in the evening
[1:13:31] time
[1:13:33] there shall be lights.
[1:13:35] That's not a partial light, but that's
[1:13:38] the great light. That's the same lights
[1:13:41] that shine in in Genesis.
[1:13:45] That's the same life that the Bible
[1:13:46] says, "Let there be lights."
[1:13:49] That's the same light that was in the
[1:13:51] pillar of fire.
[1:13:53] That's the same lights that appeared to
[1:13:55] Paul.
[1:13:56] The Bible says the message of the hour
[1:13:58] in the end time is bringing back the
[1:14:00] pillar of fire in the church.
[1:14:04] That's what the message of the hour is.
[1:14:07] The pillar of fire among God's people.
[1:14:10] Brothers and sisters, when you you speak
[1:14:13] the message of the hour, when you leave
[1:14:16] the message of the hour,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire is present.
[1:14:22] That same pillar of fire that appeared
[1:14:24] to Paul.
[1:14:26] You have been received the grace not
[1:14:28] just to hear about it, but to see it.
[1:14:31] There is a reason why God let the pillar
[1:14:33] of fire be photographed.
[1:14:36] The reason is to let you know that now
[1:14:38] we are living in an age.
[1:14:41] God is among his people
[1:14:44] where the pillar of fire is among the
[1:14:46] people of God.
[1:14:49] Hallelujah.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; But the pillar of fire is only in God's
[1:14:53] camp.
[1:14:57] The denominations don't have it.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; The pillow of fire went knocking on the
[1:15:03] door, but they're not opening the door.
[1:15:08] When the angel comes, when he sees the
[1:15:10] blood, he will pass over.
[1:15:14] But when there were darkness in all the
[1:15:16] land of Egypt,
[1:15:19] everywhere there was there was thick,
[1:15:21] the Bible says thick darkness upon the
[1:15:23] land.
[1:15:28] And the pre the message, the prophet
[1:15:30] preached a message, the third Exodus.
[1:15:33] And as it was in the time of Moses, it
[1:15:35] is right now
[1:15:38] darkness in the land.
[1:15:41] The Bible like like the word right has
[1:15:43] become wrong and wrong has become right.
[1:15:48] When the prophet was preaching the
[1:15:50] message the seven church ages,
[1:15:52] the angel of the Lord came and started
[1:15:54] drawing the church ages.
[1:15:59] And you could see how the darkness
[1:16:01] started to take over the church.
[1:16:05] And he got to a place where he felt like
[1:16:06] it was going to be complete darkness in
[1:16:08] the church.
[1:16:13] But then
[1:16:14] God always keeps his word. He says that
[1:16:18] in the evening time when there's
[1:16:20] darkness in the land
[1:16:23] in the camp I the pillar of fire is in
[1:16:26] the midst of
[1:16:29] that's why the mighty angel had to come
[1:16:31] down
[1:16:32] who is the mighty angel is the pillar of
[1:16:34] fire among his
[1:16:38] god allowed himself to be photographed
[1:16:42] because he wants to to have witnesses
[1:16:47] He wants science to also witness.
[1:16:51] It's in an age where it's not just oh
[1:16:53] the pillow far about
[1:16:57] things that just cannot be seen.
[1:17:00] In this age, God is seen.
[1:17:04] Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] There is even a reason why if you go to
[1:17:08] Washington DC,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; you will see this picture there
[1:17:14] because it's proven that it's a
[1:17:16] supernatural supernal thing.
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But the mistake that many people do,
[1:17:24] they leave the pillar of fire in the
[1:17:26] picture.
[1:17:29] Brothers, this pillow of fire did not
[1:17:31] let to be photographed to stay on the
[1:17:32] picture.
[1:17:35] But he came to indicate the message of
[1:17:37] the hour.
[1:17:38] I want to tell you that he wasn't a
[1:17:40] prophet speaking,
[1:17:42] but he was just a microphone
[1:17:45] that God was using to speak to his
[1:17:47] people.
[1:17:49] And when God says anything,
[1:17:52] when I receive it, I receive a blessing
[1:17:55] behind it.
[1:17:57] Blessed is he that keeps the word of
[1:17:58] this book.
[1:18:00] Blessed is he that reads and meditates
[1:18:02] this book this book day and night.
[1:18:06] Brothers, what is the message of the
[1:18:07] hour?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It's God among his people.
[1:18:11] It's God back in this age among his
[1:18:13] people.
[1:18:16] Not just a God of yesterday, but the
[1:18:19] prophet says he came to vindicate that
[1:18:20] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:18:22] forever.
[1:18:26] that just in yesterday's message
[1:18:29] that is not the message of the hour. If
[1:18:32] you believe in just a message that's for
[1:18:34] tomorrow, that's not the message of the
[1:18:36] hour. If you believe for a message that
[1:18:39] just for today, that is not the message
[1:18:42] of the hour. The message is the same
[1:18:45] yesterday,
[1:18:46] today, and forever.
[1:18:48] What Jesus did when he was walking in
[1:18:50] Galilee
[1:18:52] is the same this morning, walking in
[1:18:53] this church.
[1:18:55] Jesus did when he met the the the the
[1:18:57] woman who was prostitute
[1:19:00] she was full of sin but he said go and
[1:19:03] see no more that same message is here
[1:19:06] this morning saying that though your
[1:19:08] sins may be red as a sconeless but I'm
[1:19:11] here proclaiming to you go and sin no
[1:19:14] more because I am the same Lord Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ of the Bible the same Lord Jesus
[1:19:21] Christ that was with William Brana
[1:19:24] and Same with his people.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; The prophet preached a message.
[1:19:32] If God be with us, then where are the
[1:19:33] mirrors?
[1:19:36] God cannot be with you and you don't
[1:19:38] know it.
[1:19:42] Hallelujah. God was with the prophet
[1:19:45] William Brham.
[1:19:46] Everybody that came across across with
[1:19:49] him across him
[1:19:51] in contact with him they know that he
[1:19:54] had something different
[1:19:57] even those people even Tommy I was born
[1:19:59] all those people they testify
[1:20:02] we have never seen anything like
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; so the people needs to also be able to
[1:20:10] say that there's something different
[1:20:11] with the bride
[1:20:14] because have that which is perfect.
[1:20:19] So how do you have that which is perfect
[1:20:24] and be the same with that which is not
[1:20:26] perfect?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; The the word see means to understand.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; What do you see in this message?
[1:20:44] That means what do you understand of
[1:20:46] this message?
[1:20:48] Young young brothers and sisters, you
[1:20:50] know, is the message that's something
[1:20:52] that you grew up under.
[1:21:04] made real to you.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And if it's not yet real to you, ask God
[1:21:09] to reveal to you what this message is.
[1:21:13] Once you have the revelation of what
[1:21:14] this message is,
[1:21:17] the Bible says, "The gates of hell shall
[1:21:19] not prevail against it.
[1:21:23] I may not finish this message today if I
[1:21:25] don't."
[1:21:30] No, it's very important to have a
[1:21:32] revelation.
[1:21:37] You can only know this message with the
[1:21:38] revelation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; In the message, the rapture.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 73.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour?
[1:21:53] The prophet says, he said, "Flesh and
[1:21:55] blood never re revealed this to you,
[1:22:00] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:22:02] revealed this to you.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, I will build my church."
[1:22:11] Now notice he says the revelation of the
[1:22:14] word in its season.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; I will build my church and the gates of
[1:22:21] hell cannot prevail against it.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; What is Christ building his church upon?
[1:22:29] The revelation of the word in its
[1:22:32] season.
[1:22:34] That is why you need the message of the
[1:22:36] hour because it is the revelation of the
[1:22:39] word in our season.
[1:22:42] the message of Noah. If you building
[1:22:45] your church based on the message of
[1:22:46] Noah,
[1:22:48] that's not the church of Christ.
[1:22:51] If you are building your message based
[1:22:52] on the message of Luther,
[1:22:55] that's not the church of Christ.
[1:22:58] It was back in the in the in the age.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; But today, God is building his church on
[1:23:04] the revelation from
[1:23:10] Hallelujah.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; In this season, what is a season?
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; A season is a period of the year that is
[1:23:16] distinguished by special climate
[1:23:19] conditions.
[1:23:24] You know, in other words, you can say
[1:23:26] that a season there are like ages.
[1:23:32] Even in life, there's what called the
[1:23:33] season of life.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You first came in as a baby. There's a
[1:23:39] season where you're a baby and then you
[1:23:40] become an adolescent, young adult,
[1:23:43] and then you become an adult.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; There are seasons.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; So, God is also building his church
[1:23:51] through seasons.
[1:23:53] God is building his church through seven
[1:23:55] church ages.
[1:23:58] He's building a body
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; and during those season God is building
[1:24:04] a church on the revelation of the word
[1:24:06] for that season.
[1:24:11] In a message, the talking the prophet
[1:24:13] says it doesn't matter what you are,
[1:24:17] how good you are, how many times you've
[1:24:20] jumped up and down,
[1:24:22] how many churches you've joined,
[1:24:25] how many good things you've done.
[1:24:28] It won't mean one thing to you if the
[1:24:30] token isn't applied.
[1:24:34] This is the evening time.
[1:24:38] He worked all right in the days of
[1:24:40] Luther.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; In the days of Luther, the message was
[1:24:45] different.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; In the message of Luther, you could have
[1:24:49] made it without the talking.
[1:24:53] That worked all right in the days of
[1:24:55] Wesley,
[1:24:57] but it don't work now.
[1:25:01] Right now, you need the talking applied
[1:25:03] to you.
[1:25:05] The message of the hour is applying the
[1:25:07] token.
[1:25:09] The prophet says it was the highlight of
[1:25:11] my ministry.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It's the highlight of the ministry of
[1:25:19] the hour.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; What is a highlight?
[1:25:22] You know, if you watch, for instance, a
[1:25:24] sport game,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; a game like a soccer,
[1:25:28] if you didn't get a chance to watch an
[1:25:30] entire game,
[1:25:33] the game can be summarized through
[1:25:35] highlights.
[1:25:38] You can go to YouTube and you watch the
[1:25:39] highlights to have an idea of the game.
[1:25:42] So the prophet is saying
[1:25:45] if you never have a chance
[1:25:47] to listen to the entire messages that I
[1:25:50] preached
[1:25:52] but if you listen to the talking
[1:25:55] you will know that this is the message
[1:25:57] of the hour.
[1:25:59] What is the message? What is the
[1:26:01] talking?
[1:26:02] Applying the blood in your house.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Applying the blood in your lives.
[1:26:10] And the the thing is it's not just
[1:26:12] saying that I applied the blood,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; but God only gives you the token when
[1:26:17] he's received you.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; You may say, "I believe the message of
[1:26:21] the hour."
[1:26:23] That's good. That's what you say.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; But what does God say about it? Has he
[1:26:28] received your faith yet?
[1:26:31] And when God receives your faith,
[1:26:34] he gives you the token. And the prophet
[1:26:37] says that's what the message of the hour
[1:26:38] is.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; that's why you, he says, it might have
[1:26:44] worked back then,
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; but right now to make it to the rapture,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; you need the message of the hour.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You need the message of the hour.
[1:27:04] You know the the in the exposition of
[1:27:06] the seven church age is the prophet says
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; no man knows the things of God save the
[1:27:11] spirits of God
[1:27:18] and he to whom the spirit of God reveals
[1:27:21] them
[1:27:25] to whom the spirit of God reveals them.
[1:27:31] You need a good fellowship with the
[1:27:33] spirit of God.
[1:27:38] He says we need to call on God for
[1:27:40] revelation more than anything else in
[1:27:43] the world.
[1:27:47] I'm reading the prophet. We need to call
[1:27:50] on God for revelation more than anything
[1:27:52] in the world.
[1:27:56] The prophet says we have accepted the
[1:27:58] Bible.
[1:28:00] We have accepted the great truth of it.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But it still is not real to most people
[1:28:08] because the revelation by the spirit is
[1:28:10] not there.
[1:28:15] The word has not been quickened.
[1:28:20] We believe the truth of the Bible.
[1:28:24] We believe the truth of the message.
[1:28:28] We still don't see being live in us.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Why the prophet says is because
[1:28:35] the revelation by the spirit is not
[1:28:37] there.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; That's why it's the it's the most
[1:28:43] important thing that you can ask God.
[1:28:46] There's even another place where the
[1:28:48] prophet says I I only pray if God could
[1:28:50] reveal to you give you the revelation of
[1:28:53] the importance of the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:58] So in order for you to even be desperate
[1:29:00] for the Holy Ghost, God has to reveal to
[1:29:02] you what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:29:07] So that's why you have to ask God for
[1:29:09] revelation.
[1:29:13] The importance of revelation by the
[1:29:15] spirits to a true believer can never be
[1:29:18] overemphasized.
[1:29:24] So the prophet says,
[1:29:26] I can preach on revelation every Sunday
[1:29:28] and that's not still not going to be
[1:29:30] enough.
[1:29:35] He says now I'm not talking about this
[1:29:37] book of re revelation and you
[1:29:42] talking about all the revelation.
[1:29:47] So the revelation of the word in our
[1:29:50] season
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; is important. Mothers
[1:29:56] when you when you are raising your
[1:29:57] children
[1:30:00] what are you going to tell them about
[1:30:01] the message of God
[1:30:05] but you know what are you going to tell
[1:30:06] them if yourself you don't have the
[1:30:07] revelation of God of the message
[1:30:13] but the Bible says you have not because
[1:30:14] you ask not
[1:30:16] if you ask God for revelation
[1:30:19] Lord I'm raising my family
[1:30:22] what is the revelation of the word for
[1:30:24] how a family is supposed to be raised.
[1:30:30] You know the message of the hour came to
[1:30:31] be applied to every aspect of our lives
[1:30:36] even in how we do businesses.
[1:30:40] The prophet preached on the message
[1:30:41] investment
[1:30:44] and in that message he also talks how a
[1:30:46] good person is supposed to do business.
[1:30:50] The prophet is saying never go for those
[1:30:53] investment that they that just they
[1:30:54] promise you things overnight.
[1:31:01] We hear about all those stories like
[1:31:03] like there was something that happened
[1:31:06] recently with a lot of African
[1:31:09] you know the LLC something
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; no or those kind of things
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; and a lot of Africans jumped really
[1:31:17] quick after it. Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I even read I because they
[1:31:23] were they were talking to me about it
[1:31:26] and I and I went to do my research
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; and I could see out in the research
[1:31:30] they're saying that they are targeting
[1:31:31] African people
[1:31:35] because they know we came from a lot of
[1:31:37] us came from like we didn't have good
[1:31:39] good background back we didn't have
[1:31:41] money.
[1:31:46] We we tremble before money.
[1:31:49] if they just tell us, "Oh, there's an
[1:31:50] opportunity to make 30,000
[1:31:54] jump real quick to it."
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, uh, uh, uh, Proverbs
[1:32:00] 3:5, "Lean not unto your own
[1:32:02] understanding,
[1:32:06] but acknowledge him in all that you do,
[1:32:10] and then he will direct your path."
[1:32:15] You know, a lot of us, we jump real
[1:32:17] quick into it,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; but we forgot to acknowledge God.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You you forgot to get a revelation of of
[1:32:27] the message for what a business is
[1:32:28] supposed to be like.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the message investment.
[1:32:33] If you're thinking about starting a
[1:32:34] business, listen to the message.
[1:32:39] The prophet says, "Don't go for things
[1:32:41] that promise you things overnight."
[1:32:46] The Bible says, "My people perishes for
[1:32:48] lack of knowledge."
[1:32:55] We have people that lost thousands of
[1:32:57] dollars
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; because you forgot to filter that
[1:33:04] through the word.
[1:33:07] Maybe maybe if you had prayed about it,
[1:33:12] God could have directed you
[1:33:16] because I don't think you are having
[1:33:18] losing thousands of dollars. I don't
[1:33:20] want to lose.
[1:33:24] So now the Bible says,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; does he say God came to steal, kill, and
[1:33:30] destroy?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; The devil came to steal. What is steal?
[1:33:39] It's something that belongs to you.
[1:33:43] And now he came and he took it. You
[1:33:46] worked very hard. You did overtime and
[1:33:49] work.
[1:33:51] And now all your money you take it and
[1:33:54] you gave it to someone who is probably
[1:33:55] chilling in China over there.
[1:34:02] I mean the Bible doesn't lie.
[1:34:04] You perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:34:08] In other words, you perish for lack of
[1:34:10] revelation.
[1:34:14] You know this message came to perfect
[1:34:16] us.
[1:34:19] You know what Satan does is he he he
[1:34:22] looks he knows each and every one of our
[1:34:23] weaknesses.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And he knows that African people,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; if you just go with a promise that
[1:34:30] tomorrow you I'll you invest 30,000
[1:34:33] you'll have
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; to me even the thought of it was very
[1:34:37] ridiculous.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You know one time I heard someone
[1:34:43] mention I think if you invest like
[1:34:45] 30,000 or something you'll have like a
[1:34:46] million of dollars.
[1:34:50] You know, I kept asking myself, I was
[1:34:52] like,
[1:34:53] I think one of them was a business about
[1:34:55] scooter or something.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; I didn't plan this, so I just I'm just
[1:34:58] going to go out this lady.
[1:35:00] I was like, what kind of a if I looked
[1:35:02] up how much a scooter cost online?
[1:35:08] So, I was like, so how come you are
[1:35:11] going to make millions of dollars for
[1:35:12] just investing this money?
[1:35:16] them. How you would make profit out of
[1:35:19] that?
[1:35:22] Brother, I'm here to tell you it was the
[1:35:24] devil.
[1:35:26] Your money, God gave it to you for a
[1:35:28] good purpose.
[1:35:30] God gave you your money. You have to be
[1:35:32] a good steward of God's money.
[1:35:36] That's why the prophet is against
[1:35:38] gambling.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet is against gambling.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he says that when God gives
[1:35:45] you money,
[1:35:47] he expect you to be responsible with the
[1:35:49] money.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; This is God speaking. It's really not in
[1:35:56] my notes.
[1:35:58] You have to be responsible with the way
[1:36:00] God not just
[1:36:04] you ask God for a child. You ask God for
[1:36:07] children,
[1:36:09] you have to be responsible
[1:36:11] for the children that God gave you.
[1:36:15] Because if God never give you a
[1:36:16] children, you would have been crying and
[1:36:19] God give me a child.
[1:36:21] But now God has given you a child. God
[1:36:24] is giving you children,
[1:36:27] but you giving them to daycarees,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; you know. And now you you saying, "God,
[1:36:35] give me a child." so someone else can
[1:36:37] raise the child.
[1:36:43] That's not a perfect will of God.
[1:36:48] I might even say one thing. I'm not
[1:36:50] against women working.
[1:36:53] I am not against it. But we have to
[1:36:55] understand the Bible, the prophet has
[1:36:57] taught us on the perfect will and the
[1:36:59] permissive will.
[1:37:03] I'm just going to repeat the message.
[1:37:05] Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that the perfect will
[1:37:09] of God for a woman is to be stay mom.
[1:37:19] The perfect will of God is for you to
[1:37:21] take care of your children
[1:37:24] because you are the sixth gospel to your
[1:37:26] children.
[1:37:28] There is no one that can raise your
[1:37:30] children like the mother can.
[1:37:33] To be honest, even the dad cannot raise
[1:37:35] the children the way the mom did.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And then there's another quote where now
[1:37:44] the prophet is talking about the
[1:37:46] permissive will of God
[1:37:49] where he says that I can understand
[1:37:51] circumstantially
[1:37:55] even at if
[1:37:57] so it's conditional.
[1:38:00] If you need to help your husband
[1:38:01] financially,
[1:38:05] you know, you need to help him, you guys
[1:38:06] need to pay the bills and all that, it's
[1:38:08] okay for you to go work,
[1:38:12] but that's the permissive will of God.
[1:38:16] And another thing I will say too,
[1:38:19] I you know, a lot of us live in the
[1:38:21] permissive will of God because we choose
[1:38:23] to.
[1:38:28] It I it just doesn't make sense to me
[1:38:30] that God will say this is my perfect
[1:38:32] will but he says I know you won't be
[1:38:34] able to do it and I'm also not going to
[1:38:36] help you figure it out on your own.
[1:38:40] That's not the God that's not the God I
[1:38:42] believe in.
[1:38:44] If God says you're supposed to do one
[1:38:46] thing,
[1:38:48] the prophet says if I'm trying to reach
[1:38:50] somewhere with a ladder
[1:38:53] and I cannot reach it, get a bigger
[1:38:55] ladder, go higher so you can reach it.
[1:39:01] So what I was about to say is that a lot
[1:39:04] of us find ourselves that we cuz I
[1:39:06] understand sometimes you really have to
[1:39:07] work both husband and wives but most of
[1:39:10] the time is because you choose to live
[1:39:12] above your means.
[1:39:16] You choose to leave. Imagine you choose.
[1:39:20] Nobody forced you.
[1:39:23] You purposely choose to to live above
[1:39:25] what what you are comfortable.
[1:39:32] Now that's why you feel like now okay I
[1:39:34] have to go work.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, you have to go work.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; You need to take care of those kids. But
[1:39:42] you have to understand that you know
[1:39:45] when God gives a permissive will like
[1:39:50] it's there's something that's lacking in
[1:39:52] that permissive will
[1:39:54] for instance
[1:39:57] it wasn't it wasn't the perfect will of
[1:40:00] God for us to come through through sex
[1:40:06] he allowed his permissive will
[1:40:10] he produce there is sin
[1:40:13] So just because God says it's permissive
[1:40:15] doesn't mean that okay I'm going to
[1:40:16] choose to do it permissive
[1:40:19] you have to understand what are the
[1:40:21] consequences that come with this
[1:40:22] permission
[1:40:29] living above your means and what
[1:40:30] happened now when you go both the
[1:40:33] husband and the wives go work you have
[1:40:36] to sacrifice one thing
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; what is that one thing now it's the
[1:40:40] education of your children
[1:40:43] If it's not the education of your
[1:40:44] children,
[1:40:46] it's the harmony between the husband and
[1:40:48] wife. Why? Because the husband has to go
[1:40:51] to work from 8 to 5
[1:40:54] so that the wife stays home and takes
[1:40:56] care of the kids and then the wife goes
[1:40:58] to work at night.
[1:41:00] Now you don't you don't barely even see
[1:41:02] each other.
[1:41:04] But you notice when when the prophets
[1:41:06] preach on the message uh
[1:41:09] the choosing of a bride, you know, he he
[1:41:12] he he preached a message showing that
[1:41:15] the marriage, our physical marriage is a
[1:41:17] is supposed to be a reflection of the
[1:41:19] marriage of God.
[1:41:27] God
[1:41:29] said he wouldn't leave you comfortless.
[1:41:37] God says if you are weak tired come unto
[1:41:40] me and I will give you
[1:41:45] husband
[1:41:47] sometimes your wife go and she's very
[1:41:49] tired she goes to work
[1:41:54] and she comes home she has to take care
[1:41:56] of the children again she has to cook
[1:41:59] she has to clean the house
[1:42:01] and you just there like a king.
[1:42:04] That's not a reflection of God's love to
[1:42:06] his bride
[1:42:08] because God says, "I will give you rest.
[1:42:22] I I I I cannot speak on that because I'm
[1:42:24] not a mother,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; but I'm sure mothers here know
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; that it it is actually a full-time job
[1:42:33] to take care of children.
[1:42:42] I like I remember growing up,
[1:42:46] I'm not saying that it's like everybody
[1:42:48] is supposed to do it,
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; but my my dad,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; he used to even give a salary to my mom.
[1:42:57] She like because my mom wanted to work
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; but my dad was like we need to take care
[1:43:02] of the children.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; So he's like stay home.
[1:43:07] I will pay you whatever you were
[1:43:09] supposed to get out there
[1:43:13] because it's a job.
[1:43:16] And if you truly love your wife, you
[1:43:18] don't want her to be tired all the time.
[1:43:22] Children also be nice to your parents.
[1:43:25] Don't give them a hard time.
[1:43:28] Sometimes dad and mom have to go work
[1:43:30] because they they made a choice to live
[1:43:32] above their means.
[1:43:35] But don't make life harder for them. Now
[1:43:38] be good children. Help your mom at home.
[1:43:42] When mom comes back from work,
[1:43:45] do the dishes,
[1:43:48] you know,
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; clean the house.
[1:43:53] The message of the hour came to restore
[1:43:55] to true sons and daughters,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; true parents.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:44:05] It's that which is perfect.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; We live in a time where we need
[1:44:09] perfection in every aspect of life.
[1:44:17] No Jeremiah says that I can't my plans
[1:44:20] for you is is not my place for you is to
[1:44:23] prosper.
[1:44:28] So you define what prosper is to you.
[1:44:33] But God is here this morning to prosper
[1:44:35] you.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to prosper
[1:44:39] you.
[1:44:42] Brother didn't have to talk about
[1:44:43] investment.
[1:44:45] But what did he do? He knew that there
[1:44:47] would be some people that would need
[1:44:49] those advices.
[1:44:54] So what you take away from it is don't
[1:44:57] jump for quick investments.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You need to be patient in life. Actually
[1:45:05] if you you know if you actually study
[1:45:07] business
[1:45:08] you will see that
[1:45:11] the stat shows that a true business
[1:45:13] usually takes off within three to five
[1:45:15] five years.
[1:45:19] It's never tomorrow that the business
[1:45:21] just takes off.
[1:45:25] And in case you didn't know, those that
[1:45:26] want to be entrepreneur, I'm not an
[1:45:27] entrepreneur.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; But I know one thing about investment is
[1:45:33] only invest what you are comfortable
[1:45:35] losing.
[1:45:39] So you cried because you you like maybe
[1:45:42] lack of knowledge.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Go seek help. go seek for like help from
[1:45:48] people that have been successful
[1:45:49] investing. That was off my notes, but I
[1:45:51] believe God wanted it. So, let's get
[1:45:52] back on topic.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; In the message, Christ is the mystery of
[1:46:00] God revealed.
[1:46:03] Paragraph 234,
[1:46:08] the prophet says, "What is the new
[1:46:09] birth?" Then,
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; you'll say, "Well, brother Brandham,
[1:46:14] what is the new birth?
[1:46:18] He says it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:46:19] Christ personally to you.
[1:46:24] Now you join a church.
[1:46:27] You shook a hand. You done something
[1:46:29] different. You said a creed.
[1:46:33] You promised to live by a code of rules.
[1:46:38] That's what the message of the hour is
[1:46:40] to a lot of people.
[1:46:44] It's just a code of rules.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm supposed to wear a a long dress.
[1:46:51] Oh, I'm supposed to do this. I'm
[1:46:53] supposed to do that. And I promise to
[1:46:55] live by those rules.
[1:46:58] That's not the message of the hour.
[1:47:01] That's not the new birth.
[1:47:03] The prophet says,
[1:47:06] "But Christ, the Bible,
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; he is that word that was revealed to
[1:47:12] you."
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And no matter what anybody says,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; what takes place,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; it's Christ,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; pastor,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; priest, whatever it might be,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; it's Christ in you.
[1:47:31] Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; So your revelation of the message is not
[1:47:34] what the pastor just tells you in the
[1:47:35] pulpit.
[1:47:38] The revelation of the message is not
[1:47:39] just what I'm preaching to you,
[1:47:43] but it's when God personally is revealed
[1:47:45] to you,
[1:47:48] then you know you are born again.
[1:47:52] So the new birth is not just jumping and
[1:47:55] getting those are good. But the new
[1:47:58] birth is when Jesus is personally
[1:48:02] revealed to you,
[1:48:06] not by what the pastor says.
[1:48:09] That's why we have people, you know, one
[1:48:11] minister will come in the pulpit, he
[1:48:13] preaches one thing
[1:48:16] and then you go with that side. Another
[1:48:18] minister comes, he preaches one thing,
[1:48:19] you go with the other side. You know,
[1:48:22] moved from preaching to preaching,
[1:48:25] church to church to church.
[1:48:28] You know,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; but that's not the message of the hour.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; And also those other people say the
[1:48:35] message of the hour is just play tapes.
[1:48:38] Just press play.
[1:48:40] You can't press play 24/7.
[1:48:45] And if God doesn't personally reveal
[1:48:47] this to you, himself to you,
[1:48:50] it's all in vain.
[1:48:54] So ask God what you can take from this
[1:48:56] message. Ask God reveal to me what is
[1:48:59] the message of the king.
[1:49:02] What I'm doing right now, I'm not trying
[1:49:03] to reveal it to you.
[1:49:06] I'm preaching you the importance of
[1:49:07] knowing that you need to have your own
[1:49:09] revelation
[1:49:10] because I cannot reveal it to you.
[1:49:13] Blessed blood has not revealed this to
[1:49:15] you, but my father which is in heaven
[1:49:18] has revealed this to me.
[1:49:20] you know, let's keep reading this, you
[1:49:22] know, and he says it's Christ, you know,
[1:49:25] he says, um,
[1:49:28] you you said I'm a Lutheran. I'm a
[1:49:30] Baptist. That don't mean,
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; you know, it's Christ being revealed
[1:49:39] and he is the word. And when the word is
[1:49:42] revealed, it expresses itself.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. When the word is
[1:49:51] revealed in you
[1:49:55] that the prophet didn't say you express
[1:49:56] it.
[1:49:58] Why? Because you can try to fake it
[1:50:03] but the word itself will express itself.
[1:50:08] So examine your life. Has the word been
[1:50:12] revealed to you? Is the word being
[1:50:14] expressed in your life?
[1:50:21] it expresses itself.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; You you won't force it. That's something
[1:50:26] you can that's not something you can
[1:50:27] fake.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:30] That's why Paul says make sure your make
[1:50:33] sure the uh make your elections and
[1:50:35] calling sure
[1:50:39] how by seeing the word expressing itself
[1:50:41] in your life.
[1:50:45] Someone hurts you.
[1:50:47] Someone does something really evil to
[1:50:49] you and you want to you really want to
[1:50:52] just go like confront that person so bad
[1:50:56] but then the word expresses itself in
[1:50:58] you
[1:51:00] and you forgive the person.
[1:51:03] You know
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; you have a problem that comes in in your
[1:51:07] life.
[1:51:08] You want to get weary and all those
[1:51:10] things
[1:51:12] but then the word expresses itself to
[1:51:14] you.
[1:51:16] How does the word express to you? It
[1:51:17] says peace be still.
[1:51:21] God is a God of peace.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he's a he's a counselor,
[1:51:28] Prince of peace.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want your word expressed in my
[1:51:34] life.
[1:51:37] Lord, express yourself in my life.
[1:51:41] Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And Christ God died in flesh. You know,
[1:51:46] let's skip the verse paragraph uh 237.
[1:51:49] And if a man says he's born again
[1:51:54] and tries to place these promises of
[1:51:56] Christ in in these last days to some
[1:51:58] other age,
[1:52:02] making him Christ yesterday but not
[1:52:04] today,
[1:52:07] then that man or that person has been a
[1:52:10] delusion by Satan.
[1:52:14] You've been in a delusion.
[1:52:17] If God has never revealed himself to be
[1:52:19] the God of today,
[1:52:24] we read a lot of stories in the Bible.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Are you able to write one story about
[1:52:29] your life?
[1:52:32] If you cannot write a single story of
[1:52:34] how God has been revealed to you, how
[1:52:36] he's he's the same today,
[1:52:40] you are living in a delusion by Satan.
[1:52:44] If you think that you are
[1:52:50] like the me the message has to be lived.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I know that God is real.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I know there was I remember I was I was
[1:53:03] talking to a brother.
[1:53:05] I think one time he he he went to the
[1:53:08] prayer line so that he can get he needed
[1:53:09] some money.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And then I think Isaac was preaching and
[1:53:14] he prayed for him.
[1:53:17] And when I was singing the brother, the
[1:53:18] brother is telling me,
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; you know, God is real.
[1:53:24] No, God is real.
[1:53:27] God,
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; that's the God that we serve.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; In case you didn't know, I'm here to
[1:53:32] tell you this morning that God is real.
[1:53:36] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:53:39] today, and forever.
[1:53:42] No, he he didn't die just to and stay
[1:53:44] dead. He rose again.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; He says uh making delusion. And if that
[1:53:52] man says that he believes that and it
[1:53:54] doesn't manifest itself to
[1:53:59] you say you believe the message of the
[1:54:00] hour
[1:54:02] but the message of the hour is not
[1:54:04] manifesting itself in your life.
[1:54:08] The prophet says you are living in a
[1:54:10] delusion by Satan.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; So I don't know what kind of message you
[1:54:16] are believing.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe the message of the table.exe
[1:54:26] maybe the message of
[1:54:29] let me even maybe the message of William
[1:54:31] Brham.
[1:54:34] This message is not the message of
[1:54:35] William Brandon.
[1:54:37] If you have the revelation that this is
[1:54:39] the message of William Brham,
[1:54:42] then you are lost.
[1:54:44] Because if you build your church, your
[1:54:46] house on the message of a man,
[1:54:51] you will not.
[1:54:53] But if you build your revelation on
[1:54:55] Christ, if you build your life on
[1:54:57] Christ,
[1:54:59] the winds may come,
[1:55:01] the tempest may may come, but you will
[1:55:04] stand.
[1:55:08] You know, there's there's a wave that's
[1:55:09] going on around the message now.
[1:55:14] A lot of people are leaving the message.
[1:55:18] A lot of people, even pastors, are
[1:55:21] leaving the message. people that have
[1:55:23] been pastorred for 30 years, 20 years
[1:55:27] with vindication in their ministry.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; You know, great teachers
[1:55:34] praying for people, people getting
[1:55:35] healed.
[1:55:37] 30 years later, they come and they say,
[1:55:40] "I don't believe the message."
[1:55:43] They said that was they starting now.
[1:55:45] They start disputing everything that
[1:55:46] brother Brandham said.
[1:55:51] If you were if your faith was built on
[1:55:53] that pastor,
[1:55:57] what a disappointment.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm like if that even if
[1:56:03] that was me, if I was putting my faith
[1:56:04] on a man like that
[1:56:07] and I see that he leaves the message,
[1:56:10] it's going to shake me,
[1:56:13] you know? I would be like, like, is this
[1:56:16] message really the truth?
[1:56:19] Where have we been living? Where have we
[1:56:21] been been living all these years?
[1:56:24] That's why you see those people, they
[1:56:25] don't just leave alone.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; They also have a way for people that
[1:56:28] follow them.
[1:56:34] So if your revelation of the message is
[1:56:36] built on what a pastor preached you,
[1:56:41] what if that pastor today decided to
[1:56:43] leave the message?
[1:56:45] Will you also leave the message?
[1:56:49] You will if you never had that revealed
[1:56:52] by God.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not even saying you might know. I'm
[1:56:56] promising you you will if God never
[1:56:57] revealed you.
[1:57:00] But when your revelation is based on
[1:57:02] Christ,
[1:57:04] the solid rock. The Bible say the song
[1:57:07] says on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:57:12] All other ground is seeking stand.
[1:57:16] But on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:57:21] Brothers and sisters, stand on the solid
[1:57:23] rock.
[1:57:25] Let Christ reveal himself to you
[1:57:28] personally.
[1:57:30] Then even if 30 million people leave the
[1:57:33] the message of the hour,
[1:57:36] even if the entire earth left the
[1:57:38] message of the hour, I know for myself
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; that this message is the truth.
[1:57:45] I know for myself
[1:57:48] it's the truth.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; But are you able to say that
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; today? If the entire world forsook this
[1:57:54] message,
[1:57:58] what where will you stand?
[1:58:00] What is going to be your stand?
[1:58:04] I remember myself when I was I was
[1:58:05] studying at Kirkwood
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; when God was really burning so so hard
[1:58:11] in my heart that I could even skip my
[1:58:13] classes
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; and just go to my car and pray and
[1:58:17] listen to the message
[1:58:20] a fire a fiery desire of God in me
[1:58:25] and I remember I was studying the seven
[1:58:27] church age
[1:58:30] and I got through the seventh church age
[1:58:33] And it just seems like everything
[1:58:35] clicked all of a sudden.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; I was in the car. We had a van at that
[1:58:40] time
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; and I remember it seems like it's not a
[1:58:42] vision but it's like I could see a like
[1:58:44] an image.
[1:58:47] God studied in the age in the in the uh
[1:58:50] with Paul
[1:58:53] and it's like I could see like a light
[1:58:55] that's going through our ages
[1:58:57] and the light is on. And I remember I
[1:58:59] had my hand in my Bible like this and it
[1:59:02] seems like all of a sudden it's like
[1:59:03] whoa. It seems like this is the light.
[1:59:07] And I was like oh my god this is that
[1:59:09] same light.
[1:59:11] And then all of a sudden I got in the
[1:59:13] spirit and I started shouting.
[1:59:16] And from that time I was like I don't
[1:59:19] care even if anybody else this message
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; God has revealed to me that this message
[1:59:26] is the truth.
[1:59:28] That is my witness. That's what came in
[1:59:30] my I was like I don't care even if the
[1:59:33] whole world left this message.
[1:59:36] I know for a fact that this message of
[1:59:39] the hour is the truth. But I didn't have
[1:59:42] to force it. God revealed this to me.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:59:51] All the ground is seeking stand. But I
[1:59:54] stand on the revelation of the word for
[1:59:56] our season. Rather stand on the
[1:59:59] revelation of the word for this season.
[2:00:02] If you stand on the revelation of the
[2:00:04] word for this season, the gates of hell
[2:00:07] shall not prevail against you.
[2:00:09] If you stand on this message, even if
[2:00:12] you go in colleges that are full of
[2:00:14] demons,
[2:00:16] you will be like me, Shadrach, and
[2:00:18] Abednego
[2:00:20] who stood on the message of their hour.
[2:00:23] And God came down himself.
[2:00:26] If you stand on the message of the hour,
[2:00:29] when the enemy is attacking you, God
[2:00:31] himself is going to come down to rescue.
[2:00:35] God is your refuge.
[2:00:37] When you believe the message of the
[2:00:39] hour, God is your strength. When you
[2:00:42] believe on the message of the hour, God
[2:00:44] is your provider. When you believe on
[2:00:47] the message of the hour,
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; I've been young. The Bible says, "I have
[2:00:51] been old. I've been young, but now I'm
[2:00:55] old. I've never seen a righteous
[2:00:57] forsaken." When you believe on the
[2:00:59] message of the hour, God says, "A little
[2:01:02] world, the world will see me no more."
[2:01:06] But you, you have received the light.
[2:01:10] You have received the message of the
[2:01:12] hour. You will see me because I will be
[2:01:16] with you, but not just in you, but the
[2:01:18] same pillar of fire. Hallelujah. The
[2:01:21] same pill of fire shall be in you.
[2:01:24] When the pill of fire is in you, all
[2:01:27] things become possible. When the pill of
[2:01:30] fire is in you, all the mountains has to
[2:01:32] to to God.
[2:01:34] When the pill of fire is in you, every
[2:01:37] knee shall bow. Why? Because the name of
[2:01:39] the Lord Jesus Christ is in you.
[2:01:43] When the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:44] is you, there's not a single gate that
[2:01:47] can stand against you.
[2:01:49] Brothers, I'm encouraging you. Take the
[2:01:51] message in your heart. Apply the message
[2:01:54] of Yahweh in your life. Don't ever be
[2:01:56] ashamed of this message. This is your
[2:01:59] power of salvation. This is your power
[2:02:01] of of rapture. That is rapturing faith.
[2:02:05] It's not elsewhere. Rapturing faith is
[2:02:08] in this message.
[2:02:10] If the devil is tormenting you, take the
[2:02:13] message of the hour and says house of
[2:02:16] house of hell, give away
[2:02:19] The message of the hour is a message of
[2:02:21] deliverance.
[2:02:23] The message of the hour will break the
[2:02:26] chains of the enemy. It doesn't matter
[2:02:28] the strength of those chains. It doesn't
[2:02:31] matter how long you have been addicted
[2:02:32] to that.
[2:02:34] But when you take the message of the
[2:02:36] glory in your heart,
[2:02:40] that chain has to be broken.
[2:02:43] That chain has to be broken. The chains
[2:02:46] of lust has to be broken.
[2:02:48] The chain of sickness has to be broken.
[2:02:51] The chain of worry has to be broken. The
[2:02:54] chains of anxieties have to be broken.
[2:02:56] The chains of depression has to be
[2:02:58] broken. The chains of alcohol has to be
[2:03:02] broken.
[2:03:03] Nothing. I said this morning, nothing
[2:03:06] can stand against you when you believe
[2:03:08] the message of the hour. Satan, I
[2:03:11] challenge you in the name of Jesus
[2:03:12] Christ.
[2:03:14] These people here are the redeemed of
[2:03:16] the Lord.
[2:03:17] We have believed the message of the
[2:03:19] hour.
[2:03:20] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[2:03:22] Christ. Satan, I rebuke you in the name
[2:03:24] of Jesus Christ. The prophet says that
[2:03:27] the message of the hour brings the
[2:03:29] pillar of fire back in the church.
[2:03:32] The pillar of fire is in this building
[2:03:34] right now.
[2:03:36] What you need to see is call on the
[2:03:38] pillar of fire. He's passing through
[2:03:40] every aisle right now. He's passing by
[2:03:43] your eye right now. Call on Jesus
[2:03:45] Christ. He steal you. The spirit of the
[2:03:49] Lord is in this place. Nothing will
[2:03:51] stand against you.
[2:03:54] Nothing will stand against you.
[2:03:58] Just do like blind B.
[2:04:00] Please Jesus don't pass me by.
[2:04:03] Jesus. Jesus don't pass me by. Whatever
[2:04:06] you need this morning, Jesus don't pass
[2:04:09] me by.
[2:04:13] Bimus was like, who is this? I hear a
[2:04:15] noise.
[2:04:17] I hear a noise. What's going on? They
[2:04:20] told us, "It's Jesus of Nazareth."
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; This morning, I hear a noise. I hear a
[2:04:27] spiritual noise going on. Some noise. I
[2:04:30] hear demons screaming.
[2:04:32] I'm hearing demons calling for help.
[2:04:36] But I'm also hearing the people of God
[2:04:38] asking for God.
[2:04:42] And you're asking, "What is that? What
[2:04:44] you are feeling right now? What is that?
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; That pillow of fire is near you.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; What is a pillar of fire? It's a
[2:04:56] consuming fire.
[2:04:59] A consuming fire will consume everything
[2:05:01] that on its way.
[2:05:06] all the stress that's in your life,
[2:05:09] the pill of fire will cleanse you
[2:05:12] and it will make it will bring the true
[2:05:14] gold out of you. It will make you a a
[2:05:17] true Christian. It will make you a true
[2:05:20] sister. It will make you a true son, a
[2:05:23] true daughter, a true parent.
[2:05:26] It will make you a a true husband,
[2:05:29] a true wife.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour.
[2:05:35] I don't believe a message of yesterday.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; The message did not die when the prophet
[2:05:40] died.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet says you might kill the
[2:05:43] messenger but you will never kill the
[2:05:46] message
[2:05:47] because the message is one with the
[2:05:50] messenger.
[2:05:51] The messenger and the message is one.
[2:05:55] But when I say the messenger, don't
[2:05:57] think I'm talking about the prophet. I'm
[2:06:00] talking about the true messenger.
[2:06:03] The prophet says a messenger is an
[2:06:04] angel. The prophet says every prophet
[2:06:08] has an angel behind them bringing the
[2:06:11] message. The prophet says I'm just a
[2:06:14] microphone and the angel is speaking to
[2:06:17] you.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; We are living in a visit in an age where
[2:06:24] angels are visiting the children of God.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Angels has visited this generation.
[2:06:33] and they are still here.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; They did not go back up.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; The message came to bring down the
[2:06:40] angels of God around around his people.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Not just the angels but the might
[2:06:48] angels.
[2:06:51] You know in the God God saw his people
[2:06:54] in trouble.
[2:06:56] God saw in 2025 the bride is in trouble.
[2:07:00] darkness up on all the land. And Gabriel
[2:07:03] is telling God, "Oh mighty God, send me.
[2:07:08] Send me there. I'm just going to go
[2:07:09] rescue them myself."
[2:07:12] God said, "No, Gabriel, sit down."
[2:07:15] The other angel warm is saying,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; the prophet says the angel wound was the
[2:07:20] the angel of water.
[2:07:23] He was the angel that that that brought
[2:07:25] the the the the flood.
[2:07:28] And the angel is like when Meshadra
[2:07:30] Shadrach and Abednego were in trouble
[2:07:33] the prophet says the angel was like God
[2:07:35] send me I will bring the flood and I'll
[2:07:38] destroy all Babylon.
[2:07:42] But the prophets God said no war s.
[2:07:46] I myself have seen my people in trouble
[2:07:50] this morning. God saw you in trouble.
[2:07:53] God saw you in trouble and he says, "No,
[2:07:55] I for my people I need to come myself.
[2:07:59] For my people, I'm not going to send my
[2:08:01] angels. I, the mighty angel in
[2:08:05] Revelation 10, I put one foot on the
[2:08:07] land, one on the sea. I am calmed down
[2:08:11] among my people." Why? To set you free.
[2:08:15] Why? To bring you back to the positions
[2:08:17] of sons and daughters. You are no longer
[2:08:20] in trouble. Because your big brother has
[2:08:23] come down. You are no longer in trouble.
[2:08:26] Because the mighty God is with you.
[2:08:29] This message is God speaking to you.
[2:08:34] That's why the messenger and the message
[2:08:37] is what?
[2:08:40] The message is Christ.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; We serve a living God.
[2:08:55] We serve a living God. I'm trying to
[2:08:56] wrap up.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; You know, I think I read this, but in
[2:09:01] the message, the talking, the prophecy,
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; and remember, Israel come through many
[2:09:07] things,
[2:09:09] but it was evening time when the token
[2:09:11] was required,
[2:09:16] not in the morning,
[2:09:18] not in the preparation.
[2:09:20] the 14 days of the keeping up of the
[2:09:22] land
[2:09:25] in P of 91. The message is preached on
[2:09:28] the September 1st the token 63.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "So did Luther know
[2:09:34] it.
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:38] So did Wesley know it. So did Finey,
[2:09:42] Knox, and Calvin know it.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:09:46] They knew
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; there would come a time that the pillar
[2:09:51] of fire will return back to the churches
[2:09:55] knew of it. Paul knew of it. They knew
[2:09:59] there will be a time.
[2:10:02] What is a pill of fire? It's light.
[2:10:05] What is that time? In the evening time,
[2:10:08] there shall be light. Brothers and
[2:10:11] sisters, you are blessed
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; because now God didn't just send an
[2:10:15] angel by himself. The pill of fire has
[2:10:18] come down.
[2:10:22] Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:25] Means the highest praise. Hallelujah.
[2:10:26] God deserves the highest praise
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; because he's mindful of you
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; because he he he thought of you. You
[2:10:34] know, he came down to rescue you. This
[2:10:37] message came to get you ready for for a
[2:10:39] rapture.
[2:10:43] You know, often time I think about
[2:10:44] college college students,
[2:10:47] the struggle of being a college student.
[2:10:52] It's really tough out there.
[2:10:55] You know, women dress inappropriately.
[2:11:01] the that that's why Paul says in second
[2:11:03] Timothy I believe he says their
[2:11:06] conscience has been sealed like an a an
[2:11:10] iron.
[2:11:14] So people no longer have conscience of
[2:11:16] good and right.
[2:11:18] People going outside almost naked out
[2:11:21] there,
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; you know, and they believe that we're
[2:11:25] just going to we're not robots
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; when when those guys go to college.
[2:11:32] It
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's a real struggle out there.
[2:11:36] You think God doesn't know that you're
[2:11:37] in trouble?
[2:11:41] He knows
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; but he said he will not leave you.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; The message came
[2:11:49] to display the token in your colleges
[2:11:53] so that in the midst of the trouble
[2:11:56] you stand on the message of the hour
[2:12:00] will keep you.
[2:12:03] He will keep him in perfect peace.
[2:12:06] He who keeps his mind stayed on the on
[2:12:09] him.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; What is Who is he? What is he? Who is
[2:12:18] Who is he?
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; He's the word.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; I'm wrapping up. Sorry. I'll be done in
[2:12:25] the next 10 15 minutes. The prophet
[2:12:26] says, I'll continue this next time. I
[2:12:29] don't think in the message God chose a
[2:12:30] place of worship
[2:12:36] my friends I don't want I don't want to
[2:12:38] hurt you
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; but I am responsible for a message
[2:12:45] and what is that message
[2:12:48] come out of this mess
[2:12:52] if I ask you to come out
[2:12:55] where am I going to take you to Would
[2:12:59] I take you to the Brandham tabernacle?
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; It's as much fault as any of the rest of
[2:13:06] them.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; So, I don't know why some people think
[2:13:09] as if the brand tabernacle was like the
[2:13:12] mother church.
[2:13:17] The prophet says it's as much fault as
[2:13:20] any of them.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; But there is one place I can take you
[2:13:26] to.
[2:13:29] where it's safe,
[2:13:31] where you are protected from death,
[2:13:33] that's in Jesus Christ.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour came
[2:13:38] to do.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came
[2:13:43] to take you into Jesus Christ.
[2:13:48] If your life is not in Jesus Christ,
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; you are failing as to accomplish the
[2:13:56] purpose for which
[2:14:01] has God revealed himself to you? You
[2:14:05] stand?
[2:14:12] Has God revealed himself to you?
[2:14:20] The Bible says that the gospel did not
[2:14:22] come in words or or um words or deeds
[2:14:26] only
[2:14:30] but it came with power.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; He came with a manifestation.
[2:14:37] He came to express itself.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; I know I asked you to stand but I have
[2:14:43] just a quick test quick testimony.
[2:14:48] Because the question to you is what is
[2:14:49] the message of the hour to you?
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is a God
[2:14:54] that keeps his word.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is a God
[2:15:00] that that would never leave me.
[2:15:04] To me, the message of the hour is God
[2:15:06] saw me in trouble and he came down to
[2:15:08] help me.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is God's
[2:15:13] mercy in my life.
[2:15:16] When I was full of sin,
[2:15:19] but Christ cleans me.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; The word washed me. The word washed me.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I am what I am because of the message of
[2:15:28] God.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; This message has changed my life.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; When I I come with
[2:15:40] u a problem or or struggles
[2:15:46] I turn back to the message of the hour
[2:15:50] and I take God at his own. I said you
[2:15:51] promised this.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said this
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; and I stand on it
[2:15:59] and every time God has always come
[2:16:01] through. I've given a testimony before
[2:16:03] how even I had a class that could not be
[2:16:06] in the system and God created that.
[2:16:09] I had another testimony how even God
[2:16:11] changed a policy of an entire university
[2:16:13] because of a prayer that I prayed right
[2:16:15] here.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is not a
[2:16:19] story.
[2:16:23] You know, like many of some of you know,
[2:16:26] we we we have we received our papers
[2:16:28] from immigration.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; It was it's been like it was like nine
[2:16:34] years since my parents my mom came and
[2:16:36] she applied for asylum.
[2:16:39] Nothing was moving. It was in the same
[2:16:41] stage for nine whole years.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Nine whole years.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; And then one time, I think it might have
[2:16:49] been in my third sermon.
[2:16:53] And then while the the anointing of God
[2:16:55] came up on me,
[2:16:57] you know, we prayed, we prayed, we
[2:16:59] prayed
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; and one time I was here right here.
[2:17:02] It's, you know, and I was preaching at
[2:17:04] the end of the service. I God took over
[2:17:06] me. And one of the things he said was
[2:17:10] that if you need your papers,
[2:17:13] he says, "I the Lord Jesus Christ give
[2:17:15] it to you."
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Less than three weeks after that,
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; they called us for an interview.
[2:17:22] And then a few a few months after,
[2:17:26] you know, actually before that even
[2:17:28] happened, God is so God was so merciful.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; He gave me a dream
[2:17:33] and I had a dream. In a dream I saw that
[2:17:36] the immigration responded to us and
[2:17:38] approved our case
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; and I told one of my friend I was like
[2:17:42] hey I had a dream this is what happened
[2:17:44] that we usually when I dream something
[2:17:46] that means it's not it's not too long
[2:17:48] before that happens
[2:17:52] two days later I get on the system I see
[2:17:53] it's been approved
[2:17:56] that's what the message of the hour is
[2:17:58] to me
[2:17:59] he's a real God a God that when he
[2:18:02] promises anything to you
[2:18:05] He will give it to you. It doesn't
[2:18:07] matter how long you've been waiting for,
[2:18:10] but when God says he will give it to
[2:18:11] you. It's yours to take.
[2:18:15] Whatever you need right now,
[2:18:17] God is here to give it to you. God is
[2:18:20] here to vindicate to you that this
[2:18:22] message is the reality.
[2:18:26] So, let's bow our head. If you need
[2:18:28] anything,
[2:18:30] just raise your hand or you can come up
[2:18:32] here.
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:40] If you can lead us into a song,
[2:18:42] [Music]
[2:18:45] you know, I want you to put your faith
[2:18:46] on the God of this message
[2:18:49] right now. Challenge God.
[2:18:52] Challenge God this morning. Ask him, "Is
[2:18:55] this message the truth or not?"
[2:18:59] Ask God. I mean, I've I've been going to
[2:19:01] church for years.
[2:19:04] Is this message the truth?
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, prove it to me today.
[2:19:10] In Malachi chapter 3, God says, "Prove
[2:19:13] me."
[2:19:15] God wants to be proven.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says that if God doesn't
[2:19:20] take care of his own word, then he's not
[2:19:22] God to you.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; What do you need?
[2:19:28] Jesus is here this morning to give you
[2:19:29] whatever you need.
[2:19:32] Put your faith in him.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; He will never let you down.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Can you lead us into a song and you can
[2:19:39] start praying wherever you are or come
[2:19:41] here.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; My
[2:19:44] faith looks up
[2:19:48] to thee.

[2:24:35] one plea
[2:24:37] but
[2:24:39] Thy blood
[2:24:42] was shed
[2:24:44] for me
[2:24:46] and that thou become

[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Just believe that whatever you ask God
[2:25:53] right now,
[2:25:56] he's already given you
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; and just start thanking him ahead of
[2:25:59] time.
[2:26:02] Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[2:26:04] thank you Lord God.
[2:26:07] We thank you heavenly father Lord God
[2:26:08] for being the same yesterday.

[2:26:19] for giving us the breath of life.
[2:26:22] We thank you father Lord for the
[2:26:23] revelation of the message of the hour.
[2:26:27] Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray Lord that
[2:26:29] those that don't have the revelation of
[2:26:30] the message,
[2:26:33] I pray that you reveal yourself to them,
[2:26:35] Lord.
[2:26:37] Lord, I pray, heavenly father, Lord,
[2:26:38] that you give them the true revelation
[2:26:40] of the word.

[2:28:11] as a man.
[2:28:12] Lord Jesus, it'll take you to reveal
[2:28:15] your word to your people, Lord, wherever
[2:28:17] they are in the in their homes,
