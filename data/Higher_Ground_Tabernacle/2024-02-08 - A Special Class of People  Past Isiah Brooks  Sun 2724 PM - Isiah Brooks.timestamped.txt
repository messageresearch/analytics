[50:38] 2:9 says but ye are a chosen
[50:42] generation a royal
[50:45] priesthood and holy
[50:47] nation A peculiar people that ye should
[50:51] show forth the Praises of him who have

[50:57] Darkness His Marvelous
[51:00] Light Jesus I'll never
[51:03] forget what You' done for
[51:05] me Matthew
[51:08] 13 appreciate the song
[51:11] service I tell you what the preaching
[51:13] and the singing has been really getting
[51:16] Gooden the presence of the Lord is in
[51:18] this
[51:20] place Matthew
[51:23] 13 it's going to be a lengthy scripture
[51:26] reading from 34 to
[51:30] 44 so bear with
[51:33] us all these things spake Jesus unto the
[51:36] multitude in Parables and without a
[51:39] parable spake he not unto
[51:47] them that it might be fulfilled which
[51:50] was spoken by the prophet saying I will
[51:53] open my mouth in Parables I will were
[51:55] utter things which have been kept secret
[51:58] from the foundation of the
[52:09] world then Jesus sent the multitude away
[52:12] and went into the house and his
[52:14] disciples came unto him saying declare
[52:17] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[52:24] field
[52:28] he answered and said unto them he that
[52:31] sth the good seed is the son of
[52:36] man the field is the world the good seed
[52:40] are the children of the Kingdom but the
[52:42] tears are the children of the wicked
[52:50] one the enemy that sth them is the
[52:54] devil
[52:56] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[52:58] the reapers are the
[53:03] angels as therefore the tears are
[53:05] gathered and burned into the fire so
[53:09] shall it be in the end of this
[53:15] world so the son of man shall send forth
[53:19] his angels and they Shall Gather out of
[53:23] his kingdom all things that offend and
[53:25] them which do
[53:34] iniquity I want you to take notice to
[53:36] that particular
[53:38] scripture the son of man shall send
[53:40] forth his
[53:41] angels and they Shall Gather out of his
[53:47] kingdom all things that offend and them
[53:50] which do
[53:53] iniquity so there is a separation of
[53:57] those who are of his
[53:59] kingdom Hallelujah they shall cast him
[54:02] into a furnace of fire there shall be
[54:05] wailing and nashing of
[54:10] teeth then shall the righteous shine
[54:13] forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their
[54:15] father who have ears to hear Let Him
[54:24] hear
[54:26] the Kingdom of Heaven is liken to to
[54:28] treasure hid in a field the which when a
[54:31] man hath found he hideth and for Joy
[54:35] thereof goeth and selleth all that he
[54:39] had and by that
[54:51] field let us pray father God we come
[54:55] come before you Lord humbly as we know
[54:58] how and we thank you for your grace and
[55:00] your mercy we thank you for this time
[55:03] and opportunity to come before
[55:05] you Lord we pray that you would give us
[55:08] grace
[55:09] mercy Lord to move completely out of
[55:12] your way that you have preeminence
[55:15] tonight speak to our hearts Lord sow the
[55:18] seed in a good
[55:20] ground that we may bring forth a 100
[55:23] fold help us now Lord Lord because we we
[55:26] need you the word of God is life to
[55:31] us forgive us for anything we may have
[55:33] said or done that would hinder this
[55:36] service Lord have th Own Way in Jesus
[55:40] Christ's name we
[55:41] pray amen amen you may be
[55:46] seated
[55:47] um I I know you've heard this term
[55:52] before the prophet of God tell tells us
[55:55] that we are a special
[56:00] class and that's my subject
[56:03] tonight we're living in such a horrible
[56:07] world and Satan uh purpose is to wear
[56:11] the Saints
[56:16] out and according to the scriptures the
[56:19] Bible said that the of people means that
[56:21] you're not just
[56:23] ordinary you have been set aside for a
[56:27] particular
[56:28] purpose a special
[56:31] purpose uh if you if you if you if you
[56:34] ever fly on a
[56:37] plane you have several different
[56:42] classes the poor people like me we we we
[56:45] normally sit in the
[56:48] back and they call that the economy
[56:53] class and uh then you have like a a main
[56:57] cabinet or something like that yeah that
[56:58] class main cabinet but then there is
[57:01] that first
[57:03] class the first class is treated
[57:09] differently well it's it's only
[57:12] right because the price that's
[57:15] paid to fly in first
[57:18] class it's different from the price of
[57:22] the economy and the
[57:23] main
[57:26] and of course the greater the
[57:28] price the greater the
[57:32] reward is that right so we understand
[57:36] that in this last
[57:38] day there is a people that will pay a
[57:41] great
[57:43] price I read the
[57:45] scripture I read the
[57:48] parable when the individual found a
[57:50] pearl in the
[57:53] field
[57:56] he purchased the whole
[57:58] field to buy the
[58:00] Pearl in other words he gave up all that
[58:03] he
[58:05] had uh to hold fast to the the Pearl
[58:08] that he
[58:09] had the riches wasn't the
[58:12] field the richest was the Pearl in the
[58:16] field often times people think it's the
[58:21] field that's who were not of the special
[58:24] class
[58:26] uh when we look at Jesus
[58:29] disciples they may have come from a
[58:31] rough
[58:34] background many of them look like the
[58:37] many of them look like the scum of the
[58:42] Earth but in the eyes of
[58:45] God they were a special class of
[58:49] people uh they were a people that God
[58:53] knew be before the foundation of the
[58:56] world I mean just like he told
[58:59] Jeremiah before you were even formed in
[59:02] your mother's
[59:04] womb I knew your mother's
[59:07] womb
[59:10] knew every single
[59:13] person who were in the mind of
[59:16] God hallelujah as Sons and
[59:20] Daughters they have an eternal security
[59:26] they can never be
[59:28] lost Hallelujah and you say why would
[59:31] you say
[59:32] that because Jesus said Lord I've I
[59:37] haven't lost
[59:39] one Hallelujah and the and
[59:42] Judas wasn't really mine but everyone
[59:47] that you gave
[59:49] me is still mine see that's the way God
[59:53] works he doesn't give you eternal
[59:57] life and then take it back Hallelujah
[1:00:00] hallu eternal life is not based upon
[1:00:03] your
[1:00:04] righteousness eternal life is based upon
[1:00:07] his righteousness Hallelujah and only
[1:00:10] God can give you that
[1:00:13] righteousness I heard the prophet of God
[1:00:15] say
[1:00:17] today uh in a
[1:00:20] message uh uh and he was saying
[1:00:25] I don't ask for God
[1:00:27] righteousness he said I ask for God's
[1:00:30] mercy and
[1:00:33] Grace hallelujah hallelujah and I said
[1:00:36] to
[1:00:37] myself Hallelujah that's exactly
[1:00:40] right Hallelujah I ask for his mercy and
[1:00:44] Grace Hallelujah you understand me
[1:00:47] because it's so easy to get
[1:00:51] confused in the field of
[1:00:53] righteousness
[1:00:55] you understand me because we can think
[1:00:58] that we're righteous and the things that
[1:01:00] we do is
[1:01:03] righteous but the Bible said our
[1:01:05] righteousness is as filthy
[1:01:07] R Hallelujah and so in order to get the
[1:01:11] righteousness of God you got to approach
[1:01:14] the throne of
[1:01:15] grace you got to ask God for his mercy
[1:01:18] and his
[1:01:20] grace in order to receive a robe of
[1:01:23] righteousness
[1:01:25] Hallelujah that comes through
[1:01:28] humility see the secret is
[1:01:31] this the truth of the word is
[1:01:36] hidden from the
[1:01:38] world they can't
[1:01:41] see you know most snakes if not
[1:01:45] all
[1:01:47] see they feel with their
[1:01:52] tongues vibration
[1:01:55] they're blind but their eyes look like
[1:01:58] they're wide
[1:02:01] open and that's the way John saw those
[1:02:04] Pharisees in that
[1:02:06] day he said you Generation of
[1:02:09] Vipers you looking right at me but you
[1:02:12] can't see who I am you're looking right
[1:02:15] at Jesus you can't see who he is you're
[1:02:19] looking at the skies you're Discerning
[1:02:22] all the things and signs
[1:02:25] but you don't have the the ability to
[1:02:29] discern the time and season that you're
[1:02:33] living in right
[1:02:35] now hallelujah hallelujah but God has
[1:02:38] never left himself without a
[1:02:41] witness there have always been a special
[1:02:47] class hallelujah hallelujah God has
[1:02:50] always had a
[1:02:51] people that can see the hour
[1:02:55] and the time that they're living in
[1:02:57] there's always been a
[1:02:59] people that can recognize the
[1:03:02] Messiah when the world can't
[1:03:05] see hallelujah hallelujah think about it
[1:03:09] all Abraham had to
[1:03:11] do was believe the
[1:03:14] word and the Bible said God imputed it
[1:03:19] to Abraham is
[1:03:21] righteousness Hallelujah there's only
[1:03:23] one per
[1:03:24] man that's Jesus Christ himself
[1:03:28] hallelujah hallelujah but because we
[1:03:30] believe in our sacrifice because we
[1:03:33] believe he's the sacrifice because we
[1:03:37] believe he's a perfect one hallelujah
[1:03:40] our belief is imputed unto us as
[1:03:46] righteousness it doesn't mean that
[1:03:48] you're going to live an ungodly life but
[1:03:51] when you are truly born again try to
[1:03:54] live as close to God as you Poss can
[1:03:58] Hallelujah but when you fail when you
[1:04:02] come
[1:04:02] short the blood of Jesus still prevails
[1:04:07] the blood of Jesus still covers
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:12] Us this blood is an eternal Covenant of
[1:04:18] God yes sir glory to
[1:04:22] God Luke 10
[1:04:25] L 21 10 21-
[1:04:29] 24 hallelujah hallelujah we we we we
[1:04:33] looking at and we must know these
[1:04:36] things keep them in our hearts and our
[1:04:39] minds if you don't Satan is going to
[1:04:42] wear you
[1:04:45] out yes that's true hallelujah
[1:04:47] hallelujah he's going to wear you
[1:04:49] out I know what I'm talking about
[1:04:53] hallelujah hallelujah just as soon as
[1:04:55] you get your eyes and your mind off the
[1:04:59] word
[1:05:01] ground we must learn how to give thanks
[1:05:05] in all
[1:05:06] things how to give thanks in all
[1:05:11] things okay amen Luke
[1:05:14] 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the
[1:05:20] spirit I thank thee oh Father Lord
[1:05:24] Heaven and
[1:05:25] Earth that thou has hid these things
[1:05:28] from the wise and The
[1:05:31] Prudent and has revealed themto babies
[1:05:36] even so father for so it seemed good in
[1:05:40] th

[1:05:46] disciples him for three and a half
[1:05:49] years and still didn't know who he
[1:05:53] was because they were
[1:05:55] drawn by way of election they were drawn
[1:05:59] to the voice of
[1:06:01] God my sheep hear my voice and will not
[1:06:06] follow so they follow Jesus for and half
[1:06:09] years they cast out Devils they were out

[1:06:21] per time before getting the Holy
[1:06:25] Ghost know that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:06:30] promise the B said

[1:06:58] was he had to ask the
[1:07:01] question say I the son of
[1:07:05] man and only one of

[1:38:20] experience I'm not talking about just
[1:38:22] speaking in tongues I'm talking about
[1:38:24] jumping and shouting none of that is the
[1:38:28] evidence how they say the the initial
[1:38:31] evidence of the Holy Ghost you can do
[1:38:33] all of that and still not have
[1:38:37] it God change
[1:38:40] you hallelujah hallelujah and that's
[1:38:43] what people don't believe they don't
[1:38:45] understand when God changes you when you
[1:38:48] become uh you you're born you a
[1:38:53] baby hallelujah hallelujah but often
[1:38:55] time people want oh i' I've been oh I

[1:39:03] understand you're a
[1:39:04] baby you born a baby not a man you to be
[1:39:10] a man you got to up into Christ
[1:39:13] Hallelujah and that comes through
[1:39:16] sufferings that comes to trials that
[1:39:19] comes through prayers
[1:39:27] amen but God don't throw you away when
[1:39:29] you stumble and
[1:39:32] fall your experience was
[1:39:36] real amen and and if it's real you
[1:39:40] couldn't get away from it if you
[1:39:42] tried because he that begun the good
[1:39:47] work he he he
[1:39:50] he to complete
[1:39:53] it I'm almost done the designation of a
[1:39:57] special class of
[1:40:00] people and we're protected by
[1:40:04] election amen that's true yeah you
[1:40:08] didn't choose God God chose you your
[1:40:12] election was before you were
[1:40:15] born is that right the Bible says in the
[1:40:18] Book of Revelation your name written in
[1:40:21] the Lamb's Book of
[1:40:23] Life Foundation the world so God
[1:40:28] divinely elected you and chose
[1:40:31] you hallelujah hallelujah and that is
[1:40:35] your
[1:40:37] destiny Hallelujah is that that's the
[1:40:40] truth amen Jeremiah say I Ain preaching
[1:40:43] no
[1:40:44] more I'm tired of these stiff
[1:40:49] people
[1:40:51] amen Jeremiah thought he could
[1:40:55] stop see you can't stop when fire
[1:40:59] on all of a sudden that little that that
[1:41:02] revelation of who God is and everything
[1:41:04] God has
[1:41:07] done you see the Holy Ghost something
[1:41:09] else he'll Stir It
[1:41:12] Up Jeremiah says I got to
[1:41:15] preach fire set up in
[1:41:18] my how try to quit the message but the
[1:41:22] message can't quit
[1:41:24] you the
[1:41:26] Mage hallelujah hallelujah when God gave
[1:41:29] you the Holy Ghost he took that that
[1:41:32] very message and it in your
[1:41:36] heart hallelujah hallelujah not in your
[1:41:43] head he
[1:41:45] said this is I think the church ages he
[1:41:48] said you will you will remember you will
[1:41:51] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:41:53] of this message that this book was we we
[1:41:57] are studying is actually the revelation
[1:42:00] of
[1:42:02] Jesus in the church and his works in the
[1:42:05] future
[1:42:06] ages then I mentioned that it takes the
[1:42:10] Holy Spirit to give us
[1:42:13] revelation we will fail to get
[1:42:16] it hallelujah hallelujah bringing these
[1:42:19] two thoughts together
[1:42:21] you will see that it won't take just
[1:42:23] ordinary
[1:42:26] study and thinking to make this book
[1:42:30] real see the intellectual they can take
[1:42:34] that Bible and they can prove to you by
[1:42:36] the
[1:42:37] Bible there are
[1:42:41] three Hallelujah but
[1:42:44] Revelation
[1:42:46] reveals that the three are not three
[1:42:49] persons
[1:42:51] one person revealed in three
[1:42:55] offices hallu I am a
[1:42:58] father I'm a
[1:43:00] preacher I'm a pastor I'm one
[1:43:04] person I
[1:43:06] function three different
[1:43:09] manners hallelujah hallelujah but my
[1:43:11] name is Isaiah
[1:43:13] BR so is it with
[1:43:15] God God in
[1:43:18] creation father he was God in
[1:43:22] son
[1:43:23] Hallelujah Jesus he God is the Holy
[1:43:27] Ghost working in the church
[1:43:31] today Hallelujah but his name is the
[1:43:35] Lord Jesus
[1:43:36] Christ one God three
[1:43:40] offices hallelujah hallelujah yeah yeah
[1:43:43] yeah they going to come after you for
[1:43:45] that hallelujah hallelujah they were
[1:43:48] they were considered Heretics
[1:43:51] when they believed in one
[1:43:53] God hallelujah but if they watch it and
[1:43:56] see where that three Trinity came it
[1:43:59] came from ba
[1:44:01] worship it came from ba worship
[1:44:05] inste they brought all of those
[1:44:09] Creeds
[1:44:10] Traditions into the work into the into
[1:44:13] the church what scares me about a lot of
[1:44:16] countries they want their
[1:44:19] traditions church and they don't know
[1:44:22] that these things are the things
[1:44:24] that the word of God it of
[1:44:29] n it did it then and it does it now
[1:44:34] am amen hallelujah the tradition of the
[1:44:40] elders it got so bad to ask Jesus why
[1:44:42] you don't wash your
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:49] hands yeah cuz they took that as the
[1:44:53] word traditions and they tried to
[1:44:57] correct the word with the
[1:44:59] Trad the word comes to correct the
[1:45:06] tradition y oo God help us
[1:45:11] Jesus Lord have mercy
[1:45:17] Lord it is going to take operation of
[1:45:21] the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost that means this book can't be
[1:45:25] revealed to
[1:45:28] anyone but a special
[1:45:33] class do you see
[1:45:35] yourself hallelujah hallelujah listen
[1:45:38] let me tell y'all something you better
[1:45:40] remember the
[1:45:42] types and the types and the Shadows they
[1:45:44] tell the truth hallelujah it wasn't that
[1:45:48] many that made the rapture when
[1:45:52] Enoch and we declare that we're the
[1:45:55] Rapture
[1:45:57] age many hallelu but in the
[1:46:02] tribulation there was eight you know
[1:46:04] eight Souls no in his
[1:46:07] family Hallelujah had to go through the
[1:46:10] Great
[1:46:11] Tribulation hear what I'm saying even
[1:46:14] though they were saved they remain on
[1:46:18] Earth am when Enoch was in Heavenly
[1:46:22] Place hallelujah hallelujah so will it
[1:46:24] be the of Jesus Christ would take a
[1:46:28] Rapture but the foolish virgin will
[1:46:31] remain
[1:46:32] here and when they
[1:46:35] die it's going to take a thousand years
[1:46:39] before they come up
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:43] again hallelujah hallelujah it would
[1:46:46] take one one with prophetic insight
[1:46:54] it will require the ability to hear from
[1:46:59] God it would require the supernatural
[1:47:03] Instructions Not Just of a student
[1:47:05] comparing verse with
[1:47:08] verse though that is
[1:47:11] good but a mystery requires the teaching
[1:47:13] of the Holy
[1:47:16] Spirit it never becomes
[1:47:19] clear how we need to hear from
[1:47:22] God and lay ourselves
[1:47:25] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:47:29] hear and
[1:47:31] know Hallelujah can I go on as I have
[1:47:35] already said this book re this book
[1:47:39] Revelation is the consummation of the
[1:47:42] Scripture it is even placed exactly
[1:47:45] right in the Canon of
[1:47:48] scripture at the end
[1:47:51] now you can know why it
[1:47:53] says that Anyone who reads or even hear
[1:47:57] it is
[1:47:59] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[1:48:03] would give you authority over the devil
[1:48:06] now he didn't say
[1:48:08] power he said
[1:48:10] Authority there's a difference between
[1:48:15] Authority a king could be sick on a
[1:48:19] bed
[1:48:21] strength but that being sick with no
[1:48:25] strength doesn't change his
[1:48:29] authority his word when going when it
[1:48:32] goes
[1:48:33] out it must come it cannot come back
[1:48:40] vo cannot change the
[1:48:43] order amen hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:48:46] love the
[1:48:48] Lord hallelujah Hallelujah and you can
[1:48:51] see why they who would add or take from
[1:48:55] it would be
[1:48:57] cursed it will have to be
[1:49:00] so can add or take away from the perfect
[1:49:04] revelation of
[1:49:06] God overcome the
[1:49:10] enemy this is why everything has become
[1:49:14] social a social club there there no
[1:49:19] power having a form of
[1:49:21] godliness but denying the power
[1:49:24] thereof Hallelujah just just give me a
[1:49:27] few more
[1:49:28] minutes hallelujah hallelujah it is that
[1:49:32] simple there is nothing of such
[1:49:34] prevailing power as a revelation of the
[1:49:39] word a blessing is
[1:49:41] pronounced those who give special
[1:49:46] attention I think this refers to the Old
[1:49:49] Testament
[1:49:51] of the
[1:49:53] priest reading the word to the
[1:49:55] congregation in the
[1:49:58] morning you see many could not read so
[1:50:02] the priest had to read to them as long
[1:50:05] as it was the word the blessing was
[1:50:09] there it didn't matter if it was read or
[1:50:15] heard
[1:50:16] Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm I'm
[1:50:19] going to cut it short but I just want to
[1:50:22] say by the grace of
[1:50:24] God God is interested in
[1:50:29] everything that's
[1:50:32] wrong everything that you anticipate
[1:50:36] in every Walk of
[1:50:39] Life God is interested in
[1:50:42] you you are his
[1:50:44] child and he is rich in
[1:50:47] Mercy he wants to do for for you and
[1:50:51] often time we think God is there to send
[1:50:54] us straight to
[1:50:56] hell but God is there to give you his
[1:50:59] mercy God is there to give you his
[1:51:02] grace that's why he saved you not to
[1:51:06] lose you Hallelujah he cannot lose you
[1:51:10] even like he said about Israel
[1:51:12] hallelujah how can I forget you how can
[1:51:15] I lose you I've got you written in the
[1:51:18] palms of my hand
[1:51:20] Hallelujah but we were even in a better
[1:51:22] place we were in the mind of God
[1:51:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:51:29] spirit of
[1:51:30] Christ Is Now hidden in Earth and
[1:51:34] vessels Hallelujah I'm just going to
[1:51:36] leave it there hallelujah hallelujah but
[1:51:40] Jesus said in this in that
[1:51:41] word St John
[1:51:44] 1420 he said at that day you shall know
[1:51:48] that I am in my father ye in me and I in
