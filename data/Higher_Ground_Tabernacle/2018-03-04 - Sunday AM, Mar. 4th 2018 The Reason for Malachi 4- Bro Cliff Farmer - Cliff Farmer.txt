looks like you're guilty now what do you see I spoke Your Honor I have no defense but that's when mercy walked and mercy walked in and feed it my case call to the stand God's saving grace the blood was presented but covered my sin forgiven when mercy walked in I stood there and wonder how could this be it someone so guilty had just been set free my chains were broken I was born again the moment the mercy walked in mercy walked in and pleaded my case call to the stand God's angry the blood was presented but covered my sane forgiven when mercy walked in the blood was presented that covered my sea in forgiving when mercy [Music] Thank you very I'm an ready to be condemned that's a story that I I love to tell and it's not a good story on one side but on the other side it's great i my wife had a cousin who was he was just really it was really rough and the law was pretty well against him and he was he was a drug dealer so he actually was shot in cold blood murder and the law didn't not much about it but when they went to court the lawyer for the for the man that had shot him shows up but the judge didn't show up so they had someone to sit in for the judge and the one that they had to sit in for the judge was this man's lawyer and I said that's a rigged court but I got to thinking about it I said but you know my judge was my lawyer and so I was judged in a rigged court there was no way I could lose because the one standing for me was the same one that was judging me I'm thankful for it Amen if we could this morning let's just turn to the book of Malachi and I was I was telling John and I fer I didn't announce brother John Friday night at Iowa City so I better do it this morning I know you all know Burres john hayes but he's mine he's mine my companion in driving and man I'm thinking will have a driver I get to sleep most away and so Saturday morning yesterday morning I sent him a text I was downstairs I said man are you up yet or what he said hey not all of us got to sleep the whole Drive so but I'm thankful that he got to come with me and so I was thankful that relies a I went back to Iowa City this morning because the Lord laid the same thought on my heart for this more that it was on my heart that I had preached Friday night and I said man I don't want him to have to hear this twice but God knows all things so man we we think for this morning Malachi chapter 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of Hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch now this is not a good prophecy this is this is not positive this is not telling you oh everything's going to be good and it's all going to work out for you know this is this sounds pretty negative but I want you to notice that he's not speaking to the bride here because now he's going to make a turn he says but unto you oh brother I'm thankful the Prophet came and and he gave he gave witness of things that were going to happen he talked about that the earth was going to see a Great Tribulation he said that the United States would be laying in craters and ashes he saw it by a vision but but he wasn't talking to us remember because at one point in his ministry turns and he says now I'm gonna call you the bride so you'll understand it he wasn't calling us the church he was speaking lip to ear God to his bride to us so there's some there's some things that are not positive sounding in the Bible but they're not for us he still but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be as ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts remember you the law of Moses my servant which I commanded under human orab for all Israel with the statutes and judgment behold I will send to you it lied to the Prophet what you to understand this scripture I'll send you who's he who's you it's me this is personal I was sharing with them an hour an hour city church and you you're welcome to look in my Bible but brother Mike I kind of scribbled out you and I wrote in over at the top of that cliff farmer because when I read my Bible it says I sin unto cliff Elijah the Prophet I you know what I don't know who all he sent him to but I know personally brother rich I know personally then he sent him to me I know when I heard water from the rock that was preached to me I know when I heard invisible Union of the bride that was preached to me so when I read this it says I'm sinning unto cliff I sinned this morning under brother Isaac Elijah the Prophet I send this morning to brother Adam Elijah the Prophet this has got to be a personal revelation I sent unto you Elijah the Prophet before the great before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord now what you notice something my name was in that scripture before the prophets was and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse and you can be seated this morning I want to title this this morning the reason for Malachi 4 you know I was sharing what Isaiah said you know I feel like I'm going back now and going back over the things that we knew until you know we've almost forgot them but but I see something in this you know right now we're watching a following away people are leaving this message and but you know what so I'm going back and I'm looking at what is the absolute end and what was the purpose for Malachi 4 and so that that's just the things that are on my heart but you know I wanted to pick out something brother Branham he made a statement you know what is the attraction on the mountain he's reading this scripture Malachi chapter 4 and this is the way that he reads it he says but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness rise with healing campaigns instead of healing in his wings so when he says that he kind of chuckles and I thought you know that's funny because brother Branham knew what was going on and those other people thought well he just misstated it but as I looked at this I caught something very striking to me the scripture said he'll arise with healing not for healing the prophet of God did not come on the scene so we could talk about miracles that he had in his ministry as much as we loved those things as much as I appreciate the fact you know my dad was born crippled and was healed in the prophets meetings I love to be able to tell that story it's you know what's it's kind of a family heritage you know my my grandmother had female trouble and in spiritual food and due season 1965 she comes up before brother Branham and brother Branham says you've got female trouble he says but you're healed in the name of the Lord they told her she couldn't have any more children but 9 months and 15 days after that service my uncle was born hi but let me say this that's not what he come for he did not come to bring healing to my grandmother he did not come but it was an added benefit of the coming brother Branham says this isn't a prayer line he says how do you do we are strangers to each other I don't know you but Jesus Christ knows you do you believe that he is able to give me his spirit I want you to watch what he's asking his sister she's wanting prayer for healing and he's not going to address the healing now he's not going to ask her do you believe that God will heal you he's not gonna ask do you believe you know that the Lord can take the pain from you but to ask her he says do you believe he's able to give me his spirit our words I don't care if you think God's a healer right now what I want to know is do you believe that God can embody himself in a man this is the way this is the access to her healing he says which I'm not sufficient as a minister you know but by a gift that's promised in the last days watch what he's doing he's pointing her now to Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the children back to the father's I didn't read that verse 6 he shall turn the heart of the children I did read that I'm sorry but he says to restore the faith of the children back to the father's did you believe the hour has arrived for that and that that ministry is an operation in the church today now I'm thinking as me listening to this if I was her I would have wanted him to just say sister I'll pray for your healing but he wasn't there to pray for healing he was asking her do you believe that the ministry of Malachi 4 is in operation the hour has come and now it is because if you can understand that then you can see that healing is an added benefit the Prophet wasn't there for healing but if you could accept what the Ministry of the Malachi 4 was that healing was an added benefit he says you two you've come from Chicago cuz I see you going on a street looks like Clark Street to me that's right you suffer with arthritis different affliction in your body you can go back now your faith makes you whole it wasn't faith that God was a healer what's this he'd never asked do you believe God's a healer but the faith was do you believe that his spirit can end well in a body and do you believe that the ministry that's to turn the hearts of the children back to the father's is on the earth again and when she believed Malachi 4 was in operation healing came to her body I want to tell you that's why their sickness across the land today because the United States rejected the gift of Malachi 4 that was given that's the real reason why there are school shootings is because the gift of Malachi 4 was rejected the real reason that there's transgenders and homosexuals that and all this stuff going on is because the gift of Malachi 4 was not received but believing this gift brought healing to her body so I'm going to give you another quote I won't read the whole time but I just want to lay a foundation he says how many believes that in the resurrection you'll raise and have an immortal body divine healing is the down payment or the earnest money of your immortal body so when she accepted yes I believe that the ministry is only earth that's here to turn the heart of the children back to the father's when she caught the revelation it healed her body and brother Branham said that healing was the down payment God keeps his word brother Branham said so when she accepted the message the message and the messenger then she received the down payment which is saying you will receive a new body oh let me tell you something it's important that we accept this message it's important that we recognize who the messenger was I'm not stuck back on what it used to be but it's important to see this because I want to tell you something a lot of people are looking at Malachi 4 as a scripture of days gone by people are looking at Malachi 4 about a scripture that that talked about something that was but I want to tell you today Malachi 4 is fresh and new and alive today I'll tell you how it's alive today the other day I was I was sitting out I was worried about something I was praying about something and I was actually I was just I was battling some nervousness I was driving down the road and I had a tape going in my truck and I'll never forget I as I was driving down the road I just reached something I went like this and when I did brother branham said you young man scratching your nose listen the words alive he said do you believe God will take the nervousness from you oh let me tell you something so this now that was a few years ago but just about six months ago I was sitting in church on a Sunday morning I was just dealing with pain in my stomach and I didn't know what was causing and so my pastor asked me said do you think you could preach for us tonight I said I will and I went home and man I was just hurt hurting so I told my wife s I'm just gonna take a walk outside so I I was walking outside I was listening to a tape and I come and I went and I just set in my car for a minute I was sitting there and brother branham he starts to work the prayer line and all of a sudden I just felt the power come over me and I felt that presence and it just I thought man I'm fixing to rapture and about that time brother Branham says that's feeling that you're feeling he said that's the pillar of fire it's hanging right over you I begin to shout I begin to scream and I said oh my god what's going I just worship for a while and so I didn't hear what he said after that so I went back and I listened to it again this will blow your mind he when he said he said that pillar of fires hanging over you he said your stomach trouble is gone oh let me tell you the world is alive the word is fresh this is not a dead gospel it's an alive living breathing word but what this prophet came to do brother Graham tells us he came to tie up the loose ends he come to to bring the mystery of God and so we'll just read this I know it's familiar scripture revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we're still under the voice of the seventh angel I tell you a brother one time he eat not too long ago he was trying to promote playing tapes for service and he said we need brother Branham in the pulpit I said he never left ours we preached what the Prophet preached every Sunday every Wednesday the ministry of william branham has never left this pulpit so don't tell don't come tell me that he's gone go don't come tell me that though you know we got a movie on him no we're still there he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God not mysteries the mystery of God should be finished now mysteries were finished but that was not what he come to do he come to bring the mystery and to bring an end to what everyone was wondering about the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets I want you to to look at this now I was talking with someone the other day about how brother Branham said in one place he you know brother Branham I know he would change things as he preached and he would say you know I used to see it this way and now see it this way but then brother Branham would come back and he would say my doctrine never changed and someone was asking me the question I said well let me describe it like this because brother Branham said this he said my doctrines never changed it's always been Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I said you know youyou understand as you come to know someone you find out more about him now so let me let me bring you the example like this brother I've known you for 10 years now right but all I knew was his name and I could have went all across the world saying I know this brother I know his name but then there come a point to where I spent the night in his home so I saw more of him and I learned more of him than I had before he didn't change and I didn't change but now if I was to talk to you about our brother I could say he lives in a white house it's a four-bedroom house what because I understand more about why because as I come to know him better there is a better relationship with him and now the things that were once mysteries now I know III didn't know his address now I knew I didn't know how many bedroom it sounds was now I know you see what I'm getting at so when the Prophet comes he is preaching Hebrews 13 and 8 but he's telling you about a Christ of 2000 years ago then he's telling you about a Christ of present today then he begins to show you how that Christ is going to act what operation he'll be in in the church so what was the mystery well we can go back to the beginning of time and we can see what the mystery was because after Adam and Eve were ran out of the Garden of Eden the mystery was no man could see God remember Moses Moses was speaking to him and he said Lord just show me your face Saturday night for you you can't see it Moses there's a bride coming the can but you can't see it Moses tried to bargain him with God you know he said Lord please just show me come on Lord you know let's make a deal and the Lord said I'll tell you what I'll do he said I'll show you my Honda parts but you can't see my face no man could even touch the mountain that God lived on but listen we're not going to a mountain now that God lived on we're not trying to touch a mountain what we come by revelation is to find out we are the mountain where God dwells he said that Mount Zion what is Mount Zion the prophet of God said that's the bride what is the mystery Tabernacle in the wilderness what wasn't really random said it was all types all these types were coming up and it was because God wanted to be seen but he couldn't he wanted to show himself brother but he couldn't show it because it wasn't time yet Romans chapter 16 chapter 6 25 it says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world begin now see we when we read scriptures like this sometimes it puts our head in a spin oh he's talking about the revelation of the mystery but you know what the mystery is finished if you hear a preacher trying to make a mystery he ain't seen it yet a brother said one time he endured a mystery preacher I said there are no mysteries let me tell you something if we preach a gospel so mysterious that the young people of the church cannot get it then we've missed it my goal for Adam my goal is to preach a gospel that the seven and eight year old children can understand this gospel my goal is to preach to where that young people at that age are coming to an altar and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost we preach it so over people's head sometimes so we're there thirty and forty years old before they even know what you're talking about but I prayed God give me a simple gospel he said the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest look they wanted to see it but they couldn't see it but Paul could Paul said it's now made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for oh wait a minute he arose with healing in his wings not for healing right but there is scripture is saying the mystery come for something so now he's going to tell us what it's for for the obedience of faith brother I thought the mystery comes so we could argue a doctrine no I thought the mystery comes so we could have big name preachers and and talk about who's the greatest it no that was the problem back in Jesus day when everybody went to argue about who was the greatest and he said which one of you will be a servant which one of you will wash my feet they were here they were setting the preachers the top ten of that day the ones that preached all the meetings they they were sitting there arguing who's the best and Jesus is over there wrapping a towel around himself oh yeah you want to talk about who's the greatest who will humble himself made known to all nations for the obedience of faith the mystery come to calls and obedience to happen in your life one of the scriptures say he'll turn the heart back to the faith of the original fathers this scripture said the mystery was made known for the obedience of faith let me say this the church said I was raised up in I don't go there anymore we were taught obedience but it was by this you know they had the pastor had his thumb on you and he beat you to death we didn't know God love this let me tell you this a lot of young people around this message have walked away because they don't know God loved them now I'm not preaching a loose gospel I believe in living it as strict as you can live it but people present I was saying when I say yesterday preachers are not honest enough to present to the church we fail to deacons fail so leaders fail men husbands fail I don't care how great it this flesh is just dirt I don't care how prayed up you are I don't care how godly and how many tapes you listen to you still got a flesh that likes money you've still got a flesh that lusts pulls at you still got the flesh that will lie if you get in trouble you have a black dog that is fighting against the white dog and whoever you feed the most is who's gonna win that's what the prophet of God said yeah praise the Lord but the mystery comes to bring you into obedience you see under that ministry I tried being obedient I tried to quit lust but the mystery wasn't in here yet so it was all trying I tried to quit lying but I couldn't help it I tried to be a good kid but I couldn't help it I tried to not break the law but I couldn't help it because the mystery was not made known to me yet I did not understand yet what the mystery was and the mystery was not something that someone brought and laid out and you know a pie chart or not a pie chart but you know a chart on the wall and you know I heard a brother say he said the most anointed that people get around the message it seems like as you know you can tell by how many color pencils they got whatever they're at marking on the wall you know but when the mystery came to me was our pastor walked to the pulpit one Sunday and I was struggling I was struck I couldn't live it my marriage was a wreck my life was a wreck my finances was a wreck everything about me was a wreck and our pastor walked to the pulpit one Sunday morning he said the Lord's laid it on my heart to preach the adoption series and when he began to preach about the mystery of adoption I begin to hear my name called well Isaac I begin to hear that I was part of that adoption I begin to hear that I was one of those that was predestinated before the world began and when the revelation of the mystery came to me it caused an obedience to come in me because when I me when I was sealed into the kingdom then I was not trying to not less but because I love my father I did not want to us I did not want rap music anymore I didn't want the things of the world any longer because when he the Spirit of Truth came in here the mystery was over the mystery to me was mi son of God mi the Bride of Christ I don't know but when the mystery was settled I recognized this is for me and to live this I was predestinated to overcome to the obedience of faith you want to talk about obedience look at those men of old they would lay their head down on a chopping block for the gospel they would say take me now but brother branham said God don't want you to die for him now he wants you to live for him but how can you live for him you got to die you know our problem we got too much of the old man still living cliffs biggest problem is because cliff is still alive sometimes I'll just preach to me and then y'all can say man about it you know my biggest problem is me and when I get in the way what I want to do really hinders God sometimes I told somebody I said I think sometimes God six back sits back with his arms folded until I figure out I can't do it and then he goes on now you gonna let me have a shot you you gonna let me work on it now I'll tell you you got the scripture says you got to come as a child the other day I couldn't figure something out on my phone you know and my wife said why don't you just give it to your daughter and I said listen I said I got this and you know what they're coming point what I said and she figured that thing out for me you know but we get so caught up in me and and my Friday oh I can do this I can work it out alone you can't do it alone why do you think the scripture said confess your faults one to the other you need each other this church cannot exist one person on its own you've got to have each other you've gotta talk to one another you've gotta be like this it's gotta be a family you said well they don't understand me fellowship with them till they do I don't know why I'll leave that alone the mystery being made known brings obedience see the mystery don't just tell you what the seven seals is the mystery causes you to kick the TV out the mist well the mystery causes you to listen to the right kind of music and let me tell you something I'm just talking about rap I ain't just talking about rock now it causes you to listen to the right kind of so-called Christian music because let me tell you some of the same lyrics not lyrics but some of the same music in the so called gospel songs now let me tell you this there is a gospel recording artist that I just found this out Friday me and brother John I said are you kidding me man a gospel recording artist wanted one verse of their song to be a rap song not to be a rap song but one verse to be rap so they went and got a well-known prostitute rap artist woman to do a verse in the song and then we listened to that and we call it gospel and we worship and you don't know what you worshipping when you are worshiping a god under some woman with a spirit of a harlot upon her that is is rapping I said are you kidding me who who was thinking this who thought this was a good idea well praise the Lord I'm better I better get ready to fight yeah you know you can't eat or fight with a coat on so I thank you brother hey let me tell you something the young people of our church we don't even recognize sometimes why the spirits are so battling the minds of people but the prophet of God said that when a person sings their spirit goes out and when a rap artist is singing that spirit upon them is ministering to us when a man that is is singing and maybe it sounds good but he's got a lust spirit on it that lust is being ministered out that's why you should listen to message believers I'm gonna leave that alone Paul said Colossians 1:25 where of I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you now look at this Paul the Apostle the Prophet the first church age messenger it's telling you this ain't given for me he gave me the word her name for me it's for you that's why you remember the prophet of God one time someone asked him they said brother Branham you remember II had the stomach sickness and he said they said brother Branham they said you you know you pray for people you pray for the dead they're raised up you pray for the crippled they walk the blind eyes are open and yet you got sickness he said it ain't for me remember Jesus when he was standing on the earth it said that a sound came from heaven avoid the voice of God spoke from heaven and Jesus said he said this voice came not for me but for your sake milah Branham knew he was he was bringing a message to call you to who you were which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God the scripture tells us that Jesus humbled himself to fulfill the Father's will it said that he made of himself no reputation oh let me tell you you that's the problem we want a reputation oh I want to be known as a singer I want to be known as the preacher of the message listen I don't need a reputation I want to humble myself to the Father's will when you share this we're here we look at things the wrong way can I want to share personal testimony with you there's a man in our area I walked into a McDonald's after church and and this man I've never seen him in my life he was brand new to the area he kind of high balled me up and down and he looked at my wife up and down he said brother I want you to come preach for me I said okay so I went down and I preached for him a little Pentecostal church and he said I want you to understand something when we got there I took my pastor with me he said I want y'all to know something he said I know the science says UPC but I ain't UPC he said I'm not part of a denomination I said well isn't this something now you know what this ain't gonna get me famous in the message for going to preaching to a Pentecostal Church but I wanted to humble myself to the father's will I preached there that night and when I got through the brother got it behind and he said I want to say something he said ministry like this he said was ministry like this he said and he told my pastor he said brother Morris he said any man in your church that ever has a message for my church the doors open we've been going back for the next eight months or so we and right now the door is wide open I was just there just a couple of months ago and preached again in the church and he got up and he said brother I want you to know something I love you and I trust you the man come down with stomach cancer and I found out this morning but they just put him in Hospice excuse me last night I found it out and I I thought why and it just come to me like this he had to have an opportunity he had to have the opportunity to accept this and let me tell you something I believe he did I believe that God gave him an opportunity before he left this earth and I said let me tell you so I told someone I told my wife I said if nothing else brother Branham said there would be people there simply because they were kind to the bride and I said that man loved our people he looked listen I don't know God's plan but I want to be humble enough that if he wants me to preach in a little Baptist Church on the corner or a little Pentecostal church it's not about Fame it's not about a name it's about humbling to the Father's will maybe the Father's will is for you to just be a housewife maybe the Father's will is for you to just be a godly mother maybe the Father's will is for your testimony when you walk through the mall to show someone the light of the hour just be humble it's given the me for you to fulfill the word of God somebody's got to fulfill the word there's a word promise for this generation somebody's got to fulfill it he said even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest oh this mystery remember the scripture said many kings and rich man desired to see this but you you were the elect he picked you I think about I think about when the Lord sent spies down to Jericho he didn't go to the mayor he he didn't go to up to the king he went to the lowdown to the prostitutes house I was telling what Isaiah yesterday I said you know I believe if we would have wrote the book of Joshua we would have wrote a different story if we were God we wouldn't have sent them to the prostitutes house but sometimes God wants you to get humble sometimes God wants to strip everything away from you until you know you are nothing I told the church back home I said if you want to sing good get up knowing you can't hello if you want to preach good get up knowing you can't if you want to live the message get up every day knowing you can't but if you can humble yourself he can even the mystery which has been here for ages and from generations is now made manifest to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you well mark that was the whole mystery all along was that Christ was not going to be worshiped on a mountain Christ was not going to be worshipped hanging on a cross brother branham said 18:49 deity of Christ he said we're not worshipping Christ in a manger we're worshipping Christ in you we're not worshipping a god that we used to hear about we're not worshipping a god that that used to heal in the 60s when the Prophet was here but we're worshipping a fresh alive God because Christ is in his bride so I want to see God look around you know I told someone the other day and and don't think I've gone too far with this but I said what caused me to have the respect I do for my pastor is not his preaching it said I saw God in a man I saw grace in a man I didn't see a man that was ready to cut people's head off whenever they fail but I saw grace I saw look listen we are never I don't know why I'm getting on this again but we are never going to help anyone without love we never going to help anyone Paul said look if I know all mysteries I got all this revelation but I don't have love I don't have tyranny it's nothing he said it's as dung to me he said which is Christ in you the hope of glory I remember jesus said father glorify thy name and he said I have glorified it and I'll glorify it again well how is that glory gonna come he said the hope of glory is Christ in you brother the only hope of him being glorified again is for you to see the mystery that he's in you the only hope of him being glorified again is for you to recognize that it was not look at this brother branham now it's easier to see Christ here but what we reckon I is that there was a man born in 1909 that was born by sex birth he said he had to hang across from his mirror listen I'm not talking bad about him I'm just talking Matt he was a flesh blood man he battled like we battle he had thoughts like we had thoughts and yet that man flesh body found a place that he could so move out of the way that another being could enter into his body and could open up the seven seals another being could enter into his body and tell you every address you ever lived at tell you what the color defenses around her house tell you what color the couch was and what what you did twenty years ago being a blessed man but the scripture was not to see Christ in the profit the hope of glory but there was to be a bride to come forth William Branham our prophet was a wave sheep he was the first one to come to maturity but the wave sheaf is only saying there's an entire crop coming after this that'll move forward in the same works Jesus it's a hill that believeth not the illness a prophet to he'll not believe it this morning if you believe you can do the greater works Christ in you if that man being a flesh and blood and bone man couldn't move that far out of the way then you know what it tells me I can't do if I can get this guy moved out of the way this guy my thoughts my wants my will if I can get my wheel out of the way he can do something if I can ever throw down every imagination that exalteth itself against God if I can cast down all those things he could step into this body the same way he stepped into that party I'll give you a quote for it brother Branham said now if there are some here who doesn't know him you're jobs are not right you're invited now to stand here in the presence of this audience the face of God can we read that again you're invited to stand in the presence of this audience the face of God the audience was the face of God he said he had been here from ages and generations but now I've made manifest Paul said we've seen him through a glass darkly but now we're face to face how am i face to face with Christ right here how are you face to face with Christ right here how are you face to face with Christ right here my god brother Branham said how is the Lord coming he said in his bride he said the Alpha was Jesus the Omega was the bride he said I'm the root I'm the offspring I'm the first on the last I'm the Alpha and the Omega and then brother Branham said now the Alpha has become the Omega Christ is still walking the earth in a 16 element body [Music] watch this when he was here he said I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also right now we talked about that as going over there but he said that where I am you can be well where was he where was he he was walking on the earth in a 16 element body and every demon power was subject to his command and he said I'm preparing a place for you that where I'm at that's where you can be but I think he was preparing it to where that me and you in a flesh body could still overcome temptation we can still overcome depression we kill overcome cancer we can overcome every demon power of the devil in this generation the face of God I say I was I was seeing this at home and I didn't know we was gonna have communion but maybe this will be appropriate if you can take communion and recognize Christ in your brother it'll change the way you take communion I want to tell you to you like this if you can look down in that communion pan in that pan of water and you can see nail-scarred feet jesus said whatever you've done to the least of these you did it to me when you wash that brother or sister speak tonight I want you to look in that pan and I want you to see nail prints in those feet because you're not washing the feet of another human being but you're washing the feet of your Lord and Savior when their hands are washed in your feet I want you to look in that pan and see nail scarred hands brother sister we can recognize Christ is in our brothers he's in our sisters Christ is in the church this morning in a broad body when you look at your brother and sister you'll see them different why let me tell you something you couldn't hold a grudge against Jesus you couldn't gossip about Jesus and if we ever saw our brother and sister as Jesus or what a change in make so the mystery unveiled was that it brought her an invisible God back to visible a God that couldn't be seen now can't be unseen but the scripture said that he came to turn our heart back to the faith this is the reason turn our heart back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers so let me ask you this if I'm gonna be what the Apostolic father's fathers were then I need to be looking at what the Apostolic fathers did and I'm gonna know what I'm supposed to be well let me tell you what the Apostolic father's done they walk by the gate beautiful and there was a man laying there asking of alms and they didn't have a prayer meeting they operated the third pool Paul walked by and he said such as I have I give to the rise and walk and the man rose up immediately and walk what was he doing he was walking forth Paul in Hebrews 13 and 8 he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus of yesterday walked by the lame and they walked and Paul was saying he's still the same today and I'm walking by the lame and they walk but listen somebody's got to be the Jesus forever and I choose to rika to recognize I am the Jesus of forever I don't walk by the lemon they'll walk again I'll walk by the dead and they'll race again I won't buy the bond and their eyes will be open again oh my god I know I told the testimony here many years ago but I was in Nicaraguan I was preaching on the spoken word and I got to the end of my message and they wanted to have a prayer line you go overseas you gonna pray for everybody in the church and I thought God I ain't I ain't got enough strength pray for all these people so I said we're just gonna pray one prayer over everybody I said everybody come out and we don't pray one prayer and the power of God dropped down in that room and I didn't pray but sister Ruby I prophesied and I said thus saith the Lord receive you the Holy Ghost and I watched 40 people fall in the floor screaming speaking out crying running around the building listen we are we're waiting on something to happen that is happening now a brother said to me the other nation I believe pretty soon we're going to start seeing that short and powerful demonstration I said brother I am the short and powerful demonstration oh pretty soon we're going to see the works being made manifest I am no works being late manifest oh pretty soon we're going to see the coming of the Lord I am NOT coming of all he's in his bride man brother branham said I'm gonna try to close what time is it they know Clark know where brother branham said then the works that the Holy Spirit is doing today by these visions never failing promises never failing all the Apostolic signs promised in the Bible of Malachi 4 and old revelation 10 7 I like I said that he said oh-ho-ho Malachi 4 and old revelation 10 7 all that of that is being fulfilled and proved by science and every other way and if I haven't told you the truth these things would not happen but if I have told you the truth they bear record that I've told you the truth he's still the same yesterday today and forever I want you to listen to this the manifestation of his Spirit is catching away a bride now we've said for years we're already in the rapture but what puts you there the revelation of the mystery what he come to do was call you into a rapture and in that rapture you can do the greater works you don't have to wait for a preacher to come preach a revival for you to have greater works you don't have to wait on some some big name or you don't have to wait to go to a camp meeting the greater works is you in your prayer closet alone with God getting to the police to where he speaks through your lips he said the manifestation of his Spirit is catching away a bride he said let that faith revelation fall into your heart that this is the hour don't push it away it's something coming it's now the hours now I was reading the other day in the book of Judges that Deborah got up one morning and I forget the dinner but she went home she said get up for this is the day the Lord will deliver the enemy in our hands they had looked forward to it they had prayed about it but there came a day that that woman went over and she said listen there I'm praying about it there ain't no more looking forward to it it's now listen we keep pushing away I'll put it to you like this you ever seen a child like they have a little ball on the floor and they try to grab it and they push it away from them and they just keep chasing it around the room when if they would ever just grab ahold if there's and we keep slapping at this thing like one of these days one of these days today's the day hey man would you stand your feet with me the reason for Malachi 4 he said the manifestation of his spirit he's catching you away you know we've got a biology teacher a professor that goes to church with us and I asked the church the other day I said how smart do you think it would be of me to go sit in his class and when he describes the human body that I would say I don't think you said that right that would show my ignorance because he is the authority on the subject and you know when I see that this message is what's going to rapture me out how in the world could I ever stand and say well the Prophet was wrong there now let me tell you something when you recognize what that message came to do it came to right let me tell you something I was hearing with the church in our city brother Branham said in 1965 he said now the he said science says the earth is round he said but they just found out it's square he said even the Bible says the four corners of the earth I told the church has let me tell you something I don't care he is scientifically wrong well y'all look at me funny now but you know what I never did believe the message by scientific proof I believed it by revelation and I said I don't care you call me crazy if the man that preached the message that's going to rapture me out set it Square it's square I believe it sister I don't care what anybody thinks call me a fanatic call me crazy I want to be crazy you said cliff you lose your mind Paul told me to he said let this mind be and you get out of your mind let this mind in you that was in Christ Jesus that thought it not Robert he be equal it wasn't robbery to be equal he said I want you to think like this Isaac it's not robbery you're equal I want to share with you just before I turn it back over the eysie I want to share with you a dream that I had the other day I was it was a very short dream but I was uh I was I was somewhere and I still don't know where I was at but it was a very small group of people and I saw brother branham and I thought man I got to go I got to go shake that guy's hand you know some running and I'm waiting for my turn you know and so when I finally get up to him I just grabbed him and hugged him and I'll never forget I just laid I laid my head over on him and I said brother bite him I want you to know that I love you and the dream was over and I I was awake and I was like I want to go back I got some questions for him Eileen and I I mean I'm trying you know how you force yourself to go back to sleep I'm like come on come on come on go back to sleep go back so the next day I was just it was going over my mind what is this got to do with anything and I heard the prophet of God say on the tape he said the message and the messenger are one and I said well what's that got to do with anything and the Lord just spoke to my heart and said you have embraced this message and as I begin to think about that I said wait a minute what would be greater to hug the man or to embrace the message that he brought but Mike there was many people that embraced the man William Branham and turned and went right back to sin many people were raised up people raised from the dead people raised out of wheelchairs and they went right back to their denominations but the Lord was showing me like never before I am embracing this message embracing this message does what he said it'll catch you away you want a body change embrace the message that's what Malachi 4 came to do god bless you this morning come on brother Oh wonderful amen praise the Lord the sing that song this is the day Amen that the Lord has made amen oh this is the day oh this is the day that the Lord asked me that the Lord asked me we will return we will rejoice and we will rejoice and be glad in oh this is the day oh this is the day that the Lord has me oh this is the day this is the day that the Lord has made that the Lord asked me we will reach or we will rejoice and be glad and be glad oh this is the Lord that's me we will rejoice and be glad in it oh this is the day this is the day that the Lord asked me Amen praise God amen or Jesus or do you see masses
