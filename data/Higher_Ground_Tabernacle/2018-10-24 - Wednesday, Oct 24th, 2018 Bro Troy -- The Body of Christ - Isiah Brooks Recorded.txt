Holy Spirit is guiding us we make no mistakes we heard his voice there he M there are no mistakes he was perfect and all that he gives us to do have a brother I met with this morning at 6:30 for coffee and he had been struggling over a series a lot of months with the name of God and had hooked up somehow of somebody out of these that said that oil was the name of God and that prompt prompts in me internet that showed oil flowing out of a Bible and and Lord to see him didn't give me anything to say directly to him other than to say that there's clearly a name it's not oil the oils the choking that the Lord instructs to use from time to time when when praying for the surfing just but we just kind of I cut the conversation weeks went on and so today he came in and he said had a very interesting experience on his invited bike they gave me the gentleman's name me and my wife to go to this church denominational Church on the west side he said that it was a name of the gathering was a pumpkin harvest and a Halloween harvest pumpkin harvest and he said we were helping some elderly that were you know not quite with it needed help getting around and really enjoyed himself and all of a sudden a man came up another Lee man and he said my god he give you the name of his God he said to God Egypt and it really caught mark yes I didn't know what to make he said all I know is my gods the Lord Jesus Christ no that was really a different direction and he's been going with me regarding the name of God being oil and I said wasn't that good mark did not help you understand his name he said amen and he said watched the man and just then the Lord get judge me the demands of duck I said I just tell you something the man that you met he was a double and God allowed that to happen to you get his name straight and he said I believe that I watched him and he said I didn't see him talk to anybody else the whole place except for me so that was a I God sent and maybe it didn't sound like that to you to have a devil come to you but if you were struggling with something about God it was that early in his word be prepared God's gonna make sure you get it straight or at least heaven he's a righteous judge if you're gonna insist upon sailings saying something foolishly in the air then you'll get a return on that I just thank God for the brother and an opportunity to give testimony to him his daughter also was having a problem she's a runner athletic runner and we know how that goes sometimes as new babies don't need to be dressed the way they are lordy just Steve called me the day before and asked me to pray for Anna and Lord led me to pray for her in a way that probably he didn't see but is to allow that ankle sprain that wasn't even the ankle that was sprained to continue and so I just waited for God to finish our testimony of this this morning to assure him the I did pray for Anna and I just encourage you to that you instruct in her just like yourself to learn how to recount I said yeah under if you repent once a day or seven times a day find different opportunities to repent I know people that have a hard time detecting at all and I said you have to teach her how to repent even if for the things that she may not even know that she's done and just ask her to ask the Lord and circumcise her heart every day so there's nothing between her and the Lord and I said you're the prime example for dad to teach her how to do that so it's just all in all just a lovely day and I just to appreciate God showing me that hearing his voice not guessing out of my hearing his voice let's just go before the Lord before the throne of grace father God we come to you this morning this evening and about Lord we come to you this evening in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you

believe the way has already been made hey man how do we give me the power that Jesus hats it would change that first there used to say had a man we took that word hat out and put it to the word has a man because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen he has not changed a man he's still the same he's the same right now a man we got a draw from that sameness hey man that was a prophecy this day in October 2018 Paul prophesied about this day that Jesus Christ would still be the same this day on a day that is called today hey man sorry to keep you waiting a few scriptures I just had to find amen not exactly sure where this message is going to go tonight I'm just praying that the Lord will bring it out exactly the way that he wants to as it's reading through a few of brother branham's messages and it just I'd already written out my notes and I go through and read some messages and brother bands message just going right in line with what the Lord had me write down and and just you know let me say this in the right way but people enjoy going to Jeffersonville and standing somewhere and saying you know a brother Bram walked into this candy store one time you know or going to Sabina Canyon and this is the same trail that brother Brandon walked on and this is what he pointed out or sunset mountain you know and this is the mountain that he stood upon when this happened this happened but there's something about when you're in the scriptures and those things are fine but when you're in the scriptures and all of a sudden you begin seeing a scripture I you realized the one day that brother Branham was in his study gazing at that same scripture and the revelation of God would come down upon him and he had see something and he'd be able to preach a message based upon that scripture you and then when you sit in your study and you see that same scripture and all of a sudden that feeling comes upon you brother Branham was right here and he was staring at that scripture that I'm sitting right there somewhere where brother Aaron was and the various to me that is greater than being somewhere in jeffersonville to me that is greater than being somewhere on sunset mountain or in sabino canyon because now I am standing upon the same word that brother Branham was staring at and receiving the revelation that he brought out amen amen let's just open our Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 16 got three passage of scriptures I want to go to and it's kind of long reads and I know I do that a lot so I hope you I hope you like the scriptures a man I want to preach today on the body of Christ amen amen so Deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 1 six I'm just going to go through this as we have time tonight I think so in Deuteronomy chapter 16 here speaking about the Passover and and you all understand it and we're gonna I want to read all six verses we'll start with the third verse it says thou shalt eat no unleavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life a man you know and brother branham took those seven days thou shalt eat the unleavened bread that there should be no leavening in the bread through all seven Church ages that the Bride of Christ would live by the pure Word of God amen she's nothing added to it nothing taken away from it but that the Bride of Christ would live by the full Word of God amen amen so verse four and there shall be no leavened bread seen within with thee in all thy coasts seven days neither shall there anything of the flesh which thou sacrificed the first aid even remain all night until the morning so every day there has to be a fresh kill every day there has to be a fresh a fresh word would come every day amen now may us not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee amen now God gave him a lot of cities a lot of gates a lot of places but there was one place where the sacrifice would be and only in that place but the sacrifice Pete it couldn't be eaten somewhere else but there was one place given a mint just one place verse six but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in there thou shall sacrifice the Passover even at the going down of the Sun at this season that thou camest forth out of Egypt amen where God shall choose to place his name there that there that's where you're gonna sacrifice it at the evening time now we are here at the evening time Amen and there is a place that God has placed his name Amen now let's go / - let's go over to Luke 24 Luke 20 verse 15 and it came to pass that while they commune together and reasoned that was their reasoning they meant they were communing together with their own reasoning that Jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad I think about here is the word coming up next to them comparing their words with his word amen the word with their word amen now let's go down to verse 25 and then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and entered into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself so here the word I'm gonna go on to another scripture here in a second sorry to keep you standing but here's the word watch they were communing together and they were in confusion amen they they they they had they had they had their names on the Lamb's Book of Life but somehow the word wasn't there to come out of their mouth the word had to come out of their mouth but it wasn't coming out of their mouth so the word had to come up next to them and began to preach the true ur to them to correct the word coming out of their mouth because the word that's coming out of their mouth was wrong they were preaching the wrong word amen they and he had the word had to correct them amen now let's go to Acts chapter 8 Acts chapter 8 verse 5 which Romans 8 Acts chapter 8 verse 5 will read the fifth verse and go over to the 26th verse then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them amen now it's going on 26 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the south under the way that goeth down from Jerusalem under Gaza which is the desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopian a unit of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians who had charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for torsion was returning and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet and then the spirit said to Philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understandest thou not what thou readest and he said how can i except some man should guide me he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him and the place that the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his Shearer so open he not his mouth and his humiliation his judgment was taken away who shall declare his generation who shall declare his generation amen for his life is taken from the earth jesus's life taken from the earth amen and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom spake speak as the profitless of himself or a smother and watch this verse 35 then Philip opened his mouth doesn't say it Philip said it says and Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture and preached unto him Jesus a man let's aspire has an order prayer Heavenly Father we know Lord that you have reserved a rich feast unto us this evening father and lord I just pray far as you'd find me faithful lorta to be able or that your words would come out of this mouth father and that I be faithful and true to your word and to your message in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen now Christ was sent to this earth he was the Word of God amen he was the living true Word of God amen now the the since the creation since the fall we had many promises many expectations but everything constantly fell into death and decay amen every time God tried to set something in order it would always fall into death and decay every revival ended amen every every every good man died amen every every move of God eventually came to an end amen and that time would be sealed away and as they got to their high points that day will be sealed and they go back down and Ty dolla tree man so but but for all of that had been tried and tried and over and over again finally it came down to because remember when Eve sinned and doubted the Word of God mankind was sealed away from the tree of life amen it was sealed away from the tree of life but that doesn't mean that the tree of life as we preached a few weeks ago the tree of life kept visiting them over yo and over again you had visitations of the tree of life as we preached about a month ago I'm on the Tree of Life the tree kept visiting and visiting and visiting and giving them little tokens little tokens little revivals amen but but still mankind was separated from that tree of life amen but they clung to the Passover they clung to the slain lamb they clung to that token that that that there was something in that slain lamb they didn't quite understand what it was but they knew that that was what God gave them that was the token that they had that you just cling to this slain lamb amen and this is the token that I have given unto you and you can't eat of this Passover any other place but you have to come back to this place to Jerusalem and Trust right here because this is where I have placed my name wherever I place my name that is where you partake of the slain lamb a man so that name was put into Shiloh amen that name was put into the tabernacle the wilderness wherever God placed that name if the name changed they had to change with where that name went amen so they had to follow that that Ark of the Covenant through the Tabernacle in the wilderness and wherever his name was upon that gate that's where they would that's where they would eat the Passover amen and so as that transferred from the Tabernacle in the wilderness over into Shiloh then they had to bring and eat the scent eat the Passover there because that's where God was placing his name amen so now now and then when the when David got so excited about the Ark of the Covenant going up unto the up the hill to be sent to the Zion he said that God arise that all of his enemies be scattered why because God is placed in his ark there were the name of God to be we can rejoice in the name once more we can eat the Passover her again we can rejoice in God select pattern amen amen and that's what that Ethiopian was doing a meant he was going to where God had placed his name he is going to a certain gate even though he lived down Ethiopia he knew that God had his name at a certain gate somewhere and he had to go there a man to eat the Passover he had to go there to I'll break the feast a man so he was being faithful to what God had said and as he was traveling he went to Jerusalem to fulfill what God has said amen now now remember God has a body amen a body that he has chosen a mint he has somewhere that he wants to place his spirit amen now he you know heat God is a spirit but God wants to place his spirit inside of a body that's what he wants to do that's his desire amen God and man to become one he wants to dwell amongst his people that's why he put his tree of life there in the earth they men to join himself to the earth that's right the tree of life had roots amen where do those roots go they went into the earth why because God's own life was gonna be tied connected to the earth by what the roots the life of God connected to the earth God's pattern but mankind was separated 'try of life remember nowhere in genesis did God ever rebuked them from eating from the tree of life until the fall happened and then he says unless they come and they take from the fruit of the tree of life I have to separate them from until and what happened then the tree of life reappeared in the time of Jesus Christ God was restoring back those restoring back his life and the earth amen now what was he doing God had now what was God doing there through the fall was in effect from the time that that was flaming swords were placed there the fall was in effect and now all sudden Jesus Christ what was God doing God took his word the same word that created the heavens and the earth he took that word and spoke to a virgin by the name of Mary he spoke to that virgin mary and he gave her you shall bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus I was a prophecy that was gut as a creative word and she said be it and what she do she received his word she received his word and gave birth to the word she didn't know any other man amen she was a virgin she had never been with any other man she was a virgin - it's a sinful man amen but she but when Christ came to her she received that word amen she had been careful her whole life but now when this word comes to her she receives that word and she says be it unto me according to thy word the same way the earth back in the beginning when God said let the earth bring forth the trees amen let the earth bring forth he put his word into the earth dirt and it became forth exactly what he said so what now he's putting his word into Mary and she gives birth to Jesus Christ and what does he do he grows up and he is God the fullness of the Godhead bodily and a body of flesh God was placing God look now look the earth God had the title deed to the earth a meant he was going to give that to Adam Adam lost that title deed he lost he rejected his possession of a title deed to all of earth and demeaning over the earth he rejected it when he when he went out with his wife he rejected his ownership but what happened so so what so what so the earth was lost amen Satan so ruined the plan of God that the entire earth and all the air all was on the earth was lost and Satan became the god of this earth that was supposed to have been at him and Satan would begin to show his civilizations and grow up ungodly cities and all these you know if you look at all the the archaeological thing that they found going back you know four thousand years five thousand years all these little figurines and gods and things and the baton you know I even read that when when they in eighteen hundreds when they discovered Pompeii that that that was buried underneath that volcano two thousand years ago that in the Victorian times when those archeologists first started digging up Pompeii that the figurines they found were so wicked and so grotesque and so vulgar that they just buried him right back up again they didn't want to dig them out of the ground that they actually reburied what they found because what they found was so wicked that they didn't want to have it in their possession that's not a problem anymore because mankind has now changed their mind back to that wickedness but 150 years ago that was too wicked to be unburied but now it's okay amen but now look the earth grew wicked and wicked and wicked why because the god of this evil age was having its way with civilization and the earth amen all of mankind was ruined there was no hope a meant we were where there was no hope for us there was no hope we had our Passover lamb we had the things we clung to but ultimately we were so vulgar than our minds we spoke lies where can we find a new creation how can we be created again once we become dirty and filthy how can we be cleansed again amen God created us to be the rulers of the earth but we lost our possession God created us to have dominion God created us to live in purity with our God God created us to walk with Him in the cool of the day and we trashed our opportunity amen we lost our opportunity amen we weren't careful with the opportunity that we were given so that opportunity was taken away have you ever had something given to you and then you ruined your opportunity by your own actions it's a terrible feeling to ruin to be given something an opportunity to be in a certain position or an opportunity to have something and then you buy your own foolishness or your own actions you lose that opportunity and then you just kick yourself you're like why did I do such a thing anything especially if you ever get to a place where you can never go back to that opportunity and just it pains your heart you think oh why did I allow that to happen why did I ruin that opportunity why did I let this happen why did I not take advantage of that why didn't I die jump at that chance and but alas now the time is gone and it'll never come back and that's the condition that mankind was in the entire earth had been taken out of our possession every speck of dirt was underneath Satan's control every speck of dirt but now Christ or God speaks his word to a woman by the name of Mary and she believes it and God and her body is born that we called Jesus Christ now that body was made out of the dirt of the earth right that body was made out of the natural dirt of the curse earth and what'd he do he claimed it for his own Jesus Christ said this is my portion of the earth and he claimed it and he filled it with himself he took a part of the earth and he filled it with himself he was reversing the curse over that hundred and thirty pounds of dirt all just a hunt now think about how much this world weighs how many tons quadrillions of quadrillions of tons at this earth waste but yeah God came and claimed a hundred and thirty pounds and said I claim this for my own and he took that body and he Bible says that he grew up and he grew up and he grew up in wisdom and stature amen and then as he grew and as he grew and he ate and he ate the natural food of the earth is by agroni and the Holy Spirit descend upon him like the Dove and sealed that portion of the dirt amen God was reclaiming the dirt of the earth amen God was reclaiming it now what'd he do he gave Satan the opportunity to have that portion of the dirt right amen and he and Satan took that and says I don't want it amen hueso so so the so he went to the to Jerusalem and they didn't want him that 130 pounds of dirt went to Jerusalem Jerusalem didn't want it Jerusalem wouldn't claim it he went to the Roman Empire the Roman Empire didn't want and turned them back over to Jerusalem let the priests do and the priests say but we need to say he deserves death and Jerusalem and the Roman said but we cannot kill him what hit wrong has he done and so then but then Jerusalem answers back and says let his blood be upon us and and they are in agreement Jerusalem in agreement with the Roman the world power in agreement with the church power agreeing together that we don't want this 130 pounds of dirt and they took him up off the earth and hung him on a cross between heaven and earth and he was rejected and separated from the earth that he came from a hung up in the air and he was rejected by what he was rejected by the devil he was rejected by the Romans he is rejected by the church he was not wanted but there were some that wanted him there were some that would receive him amen look he was rejected by all and he hung there and so why did God do God so it is that body laid there in the in the grave those three days and three nights and a few women went to go claim him amen went to go anoint him amen and it was it and now all of a sudden that body was laying there dead it grew cold three days that body laid there and grew cold nobody wanted nobody would claim it they sealed it behind a stone and nobody wanted the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and so as it grew cold there those those three days all of a sudden something happened God waited for someone to claim it nobody wanted so God says I will claim it I will claim this body so God takes his spirit and places his spirit back inside the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and he claims that 130 pounds of dirt a mint now know that body is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan didn't want it the church didn't want the world didn't want it but God says all take and that reversed the curse over that part of the dirt now that body has sinned it up into the heavens they meant and as a token the Bible says that is a token it's a sacrifice that Jesus stands there with his own blood waiting for us to make intercession for you based upon your confession amen so what that was the body of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the body of Lord Jesus Christ now what is he doing he's expanding that body that if anybody would believe upon me I will give him power to reject the body that he was born with and to be transformed by the renewing of your mind to be a new creature and now you will become a part of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now you have a chance and an opportunity that the opportunity the Adam and Eve lost has now been returned back to the sons of men Amen Satan rejected that body now it's no longer just a hundred thirty pound body but now it's all of when we are given an opportunity when the window when the light comes of flashes across your eyes and all sudden you begin to realize what the gospel is and you accept the gospel amen now you but Jesus says come unto me all ye who are weary laden I will give you rest hey meant what was rest it was the the end of the creation the the last day of creation the seventh day was that rest amen and Jesus says if you come unto me I will give you rest you will be completed a new creation you will be a mint about the body of the Lord Jesus Christ recreated upon the earth flesh of my flesh bone of my bone she is him by the blood by the word the opportunity that has been given to us so think about it now on the road to Emmaus they were talking there and they were sad the greatest event that ever happened upon the earth was upon them and they were sad their countenance was contrary to the event it's like giving someone a million dollars and they get all upset about it they didn't realize the point in time where they were staying so God sent the word to them because they didn't realize where they were and what they're at the point that they were standing in God had to send the word to them to change their way of thinking why so they could be redirected to do exactly remember he told them wait here until you be endued with power from on high amen and so I had to he had to come here to meet them the visitation the visitation a mint so what Jesus the word came to them and changed they were there but now think about here's another now go couple years later here's a eunuch he doesn't know but he's been faithful he leaves Ethiopia and he is in charge of all the wealth of this queen by the name of Candace and he leaves and he goes to Jerusalem and while he's there he perhaps you know sees a scroll of Isaiah for sale on the streets you know how much one of those costs you know how many days of labor it costs to get a scroll of Isaiah you know a 30-foot long scroll of Isaiah that's a lot of money how many man-hours that go into - to creating something like that but he says it is worth it I will pay that price I want to know what the word of Jehovah is he K he left Ethiopia to go to Jerusalem the thing is is he went to the wrong Jerusalem because he wanted to go to where the name of the Lord was because God said in Deuteronomy 16 that only in one gate will you worship Amen and there at that gate is where you'll eat the Passover so he went but he didn't realize that Jerusalem had changed the gate had changed it was no longer there in Jerusalem the gate had changed he went to the wrong Jerusalem and he bought the scroll of Isaiah and as he as he read his reading through the scroll he's he said I'm reading here I just don't understand when he says he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb done before his Shearer so opened he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life was taken from the earth whose life is he talking about and so as the eunuch starts talking to Philip whose life is who is taken from the earth I don't know who he's talking about somebody's life was taken from the earth and I don't know what it means amen now think about how many verses in the scroll isaiah could have pointed to it comes right down there to that verse there and he says he tells me and then oh and then the angel tells philip go and speak to this man there I remember the angel could have went and spoke to the eunuch but the eunuch the angel couldn't do it he had to go find a man he had to go find a body amen he went and found a body where'd that body that body had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she had become one with Christ amen isn't that the bride of Lord Jesus Christ flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and wanted to do eunuch or the Philip joins himself with the eunuch and the eunuch says his life was taken from the earth whose life is that is that the prophet or some other and from there and then all sudden Philip opens his mouth and begins to preach Jesus so now how did Phil how did this unit get saved now remember just a few years before that Jesus was walking over them they were sad they were like what is this all meat was all this meat and jesus preached unto Him Jesus but now Philip is doing the same position doing the same thing proving that he was the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ Philip was proving to the world that he was the bride of Lord Jesus Christ doing the same thing that Jesus did how how did he do that because he had received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had received the same spirit so he could preach the same gospel he received the same spirit so he could preach the same gospel amen I want to read here from tamal fashioned a man brother branham said here and the spoken word is the original seed he said now he's talking about philip and the eunich he said now Philip had been up to Pentecost Jerusalem for worship Tommy says amen to that Philip went to Pentecost amen the eunuch didn't go to Pentecost he went to Jerusalem with all the Dedes and the oldies amen so Philip knew the eunuch didn't know amen then Bream says talking about the eunuch he says but why didn't he get something because he went to the wrong Jerusalem amen he come back down from Jerusalem studying the prophecy of Isaiah they says although programs seen here although an angel directed Philip to him the eunuch but the germ of life had to come through the body Philip oh brother now we're on the line where did the germ come from through the angel no the angel showed Philip where to go an angel is a messenger but here's a son Philip had the germ the message the word and that's how a child can be born Philip laid his hands upon him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and there came forth the Spirit of God sure now the germ had to come from the body what body Christ's body correct and Philip was a member of the body amen Philip was a member of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ so because Philip was a member of the body body of Lord Jesus Christ he could open the Bible says and he opened his mouth and what came out the word philip opened his mouth and the word came out any priest jesus that was the germ of life the same germ of life that was in Jesus Christ now is in the body it was in the body of Christ they are still in the body of Christ but the body has become one Christ and his bride Amen now brother Branham said Jehovah had a bride and Adam had a bride she felt Adam had a bride but she felt Jehovah had a bride she fell Christ had a bride on the day of Pentecost she felt to all the dark ages amen brother Branham says I sat there in the basement and he said I wonder what am I going to do I the patterns have to keep it going I'm gonna get the church out on a limb there was three brides and all three of them fell how can it be that the third one fell when the third one shouldn't fall and then he says and the scripture came to me I will restore saith the Lord so the third bride Christ had a bride on the day of Pentecost but she fell throughout all the dark ages but I will restore saith the Lord all of the years every year amen I'll restore it year 34 year 35 year 36 or 37 amen your 500 year 1000 all those years they're separating us from where we came from we'll be restored back to us so we can become the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now not not not a body like the Methodist body because the Methodist body added to the word so that the Spirit couldn't come upon it amen the Lutheran body mixed it together so it wasn't just the boughten message of Christ buzz of Christ plus the message of Luther's followers message of man so in Pentecost the gifts are restored and they say that we now have the life of Jesus Christ upon us but yet then all suddenly being adding to it adding to it was it see they're testifying that they're not restored yet they're testifying that they were not restored yet why because if they've been restored back to what they were at their original they would have mixed it but there has to come a word of restoration so that the so that Christ can be the same why because we are part of his body amen so what the body at the end has to look like the body at the beginning a man and the body at the beginning when she opened up her mouth the word came out and men were healed men were delivered man we're baptized amen the Spirit of God was upon a man and they didn't mix the word of man with the Word of God amen so what so what God sends a prophet with a word and says go back to where you come from go back to the word don't take anything away from it don't have anything to it but restate with the word stay right with the word and by that prophet the word was restored I tried living this word without the message and I couldn't do it it took this message to restore me back amen amen why Weiss why so we could be a bride of Lord Jesus Christ so what was it brother Branham had a word that was given to him he was a prophet that word came from where came from God that word was a seat so brother Branham opened up his mouth and spoke out and what was it seeds amen now what was that there was also a Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and they pre shout what a message seeds and all those seeds are going out where they and they go or they where they came anyway let's turn it over to Ephesians chapter 4 I know keeping you along tonight but in PJ's chapter 4 verse 1 and it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you now beseech you means I'm crying out to you I'm asking you I'm begging you I'm bleeding you with you I beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called now you know I I went to a Bible study once years and years ago that tore the scripture apart and looked at every word and and what they got out of it was is that when you're a young man and you're studying to figure out what type of career you should go in that you should pray about it and and God will give you the career the desire of your heart and you go and you do the best job you can in that career and God will bless you with wealth and the health and all that and just walk worthy of the vocation you know and the vocation being in your career you know we're we have not been called that they miss the entire boat of what we've been called to hear peep Hall is speaking out the word and the war by the word he's saying I am busy tching you that you walk according to what your calling is going to be amen and you have a high in holy calling amen now the bride of this day has a high and holy calling and we in Paula's pleading with you yet this day I'm beseeching you walk worthy with this with this word that you've been given Amen with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace trying endeavoring there is one body and one spirit even as you're called one hope of your calling later on in the chapter he says grieve not the Holy Spirit where you're sealed and he says put off all the those follow the lust put off all these things he keeps warning them warning them don't let your mind get confused don't let your mind go down in the sin why because he he wants to give these seeds room to grow all of these warnings in this chapter are here for a purpose because Paul wants you to clear out all the junk out of your life to give room for this seed to grow why so the body could be prepared for the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ because what happens when a body receives the Spirit of Christ Christ is all upon the earth again amen in his body amen so what faith cometh by hearing so when these seeds are planted let's go out into Fiji's 421 if so this year let's start with verse 19 who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him faith cometh by hearing right and have been taught by him as the truth isn't Jesus that he put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind now let's pause right here what is Paul doing he's trying the fusions Church he's he's speaking to those in the ephesians church that have heard about jesus they've been taught about jesus but have not become a new creation and he's trying to clear all the junk so that the seeds that have been planted can grow because if that junk now even though they've heard about jesus they've been taught about jesus but with all the associates and all this stuff in there the the seeds that were planted cannot grow amen so in verse 23 verse 22 that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man the old way of living which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and they put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness a new man well no wait why does we have to have a new no we had an old man that was God created in the gate beginning that fell amen and Jenner after generation as soon as carried on carried on carried on throughout all of our generations to us amen but now here's an opportunity that there's a new man available what is this new man it's a new creation it's Genesis all over again we've gone back to the book of Genesis where creative words were available they meant what what in the book of Genesis creative words were available they went out of God's mouth they went into the dirt and create exactly what God had well God wanted to create whatever that particular word was it created exactly in every seat bore forth after its kind amen so what we know we think Genesis is oh us way back in the past the creative word is gone there is no more creation amen but now we find out that the creative word that was in Genesis is still here there's still a creative word here and was this creative word saying that it's gone out and now it's gone out by the preaching of the gospel every word that comes over this pulpit amen when God when I'm preachers preaching our youth inspiration he becomes what a five full prophet right becomes he's preaching out the word it's he's prophesying amen and that word goes forth as a seed and it strikes amen and if it goes hits good ground it grows that's the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor four members one of another and he goes through there and just all these different things because I'm a verse 30 you know in grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye or sealed why because we're he's trying to the the body now the body at this point is showing signs of trying of the grievious wolves are trying to come into the flock Amen he's warning them make make room for the seed to grow he knew what the creative word could do but then when he looked off over the churches he saw so many things crowding it out so they could not grow and the same thing is here today the creative word is still here to create sons and daughters of God to be part of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ to be like Phillip speaking to the eunuch tour an angel wouldn't dare witness to the eunuch but the angel had to go out and get a man a body son of God and call that son of God go out here and minister this man and open your mouth and let the Word of God flow out and let the creative word create as a seed upon the heart of this unit if anybody would be willing to get the trash out of their life they could be the same thing but he warns him watch throughout all these books of Paul he he goes through the all the great things that could be but he says warnings stay clean I'm beseech you keep clean walk worthy be worthy of the calling why because this calling is a creative word and then we go to a denominational Church they'll go and they'll teach these scriptures they'll teach them and it'll teach him but yet they have no power to actually create what Paul was trying to create a new creation a son or a daughter of God the body of Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth it's the bride of Lord Jesus Christ she has become him by the word but so many things hindered amen so many things hinder but I Ram says and now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind these last days the true church bride comes to the headstone will be a super church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be much like him so much like him even as they will be in his very image in the order to be united with him they will be one now when a prophet is speaking something like this what happens that's right it comes to pass it's a seat when our prophet prophesies a man and this is where I said the spirit told me to pick up my pin right and this is what he wrote so well it's a creative word it has to come to pass it has to has to be who should have come to pass it I beseech you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called I cried out to you get it get this thing's clear make pigment they got all the rocks dig out all the stones clean up the dirt prepare the dirt of your heart why so these words can grow in your heart and you can become exactly what was prophesied to be why because wheat now this wasn't just 2,000 years ago this is a prophecy prophecy in our day that this would come to pass well then who should have come to pass there's got to be someone that's going to believe this amen now if we believe if we believe you know anoint the sick with oil and they shall recover and we believe that we pray over them they get sealed we think oh my it came to pass just exactly or we think oh if we baptized someone in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we put him down into the water and we take up that man's now a Christian and we put our faith in those words we have to put our faith in this word that these are these prophetic words can't come to pass they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can ever produce this they will produce their creeds and dogmas mixed with the word amen then then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin now think about that you know I you know in my life I've seen a lot of different types of people you know and there's how do I say this there's you think of people that believe in proprietary things and people that believe in do it yourself you know and and I and I a it it I could see both arguments on a lot of things you know it's almost as though you know you should never work on your own furnace because you should only have a professional work on your furnace you know Amen but do yourself or says well I know how this can go together and I can do just as good job as professional and spend less money and so there's the argument the proprietary the factory authorized service or the man is going to do it himself amen but the interesting thing is is how some people twist that when it comes to religion and then they'll say well I have I am the factory authorized dealer and you have no part in this and then but and now there's going to be a lot of people who claim that their factory authorized dealers but when they go to put their hand upon the equipment I know if you've ever been there have you ever taken your car to a dealership and said I could have fixed it better myself [Music] there's many people they put their hand to the equipment and though they have the seal that they are factory authorized dealer when they put they - they don't know the first thing about what the designer intended to actually but if you ever take a man who is actually knows the design and knows the intention and he can dive in there and go in there and know exactly what's going on Amen that man deserves the true seal amen and a lot of people will say you know well you know brother branham used the Prophet and there should be no more preachers no more speaking we're the Foxes of the factory authorized dealers and and and this forth and and now I know all of a sudden the church sits there and dries up and dies out and they tampered with the Machine and their church died and they're not bringing forth life but Philip when Phil point out all he had to do was open his mouth and the way it proved that he was a factory authorized dealer he knew what he was doing he opened up his mouth and he was a factory authorized dealer jesus said by their fruits you shall know them amen and in this day you will find a lot of people saying a lot of things people will say I am I am this and I am that amen but it in the end it will show who who is who they say they are it will show who is the factory authorized dealer or the word who has the Word of God amen there will be a new creation brother Branham let me read that again he said then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed's or dogless through them why because Christ has to have a body to work through amen brother BAM said they're back there and we read about Philip what he said about Philip God the angel needed a body and went and got Philip I had to have a body because the word comes through the body the same is true today amen the word still has to come through the body the body of the Lord Jesus Christ we must preach the gospel we must preach the gospel you submit yourself to the word to this message clear out your heart of all the junk and what brother Branham prophesied to come to pass those seeds will come past your life amen now if you go to the Baptist Church in the Methodist Church to receive those seeds and bring forth that fruit or we come to this message receive this seed receive this message and bring forth exactly what was prophesied to come she will be like him amen it's an opportunity that's the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I'm gonna read here Ephesians chapter 4 verses 13 through 16 I'm almost closed almost done he says he's talking about the fivefold ministry in verse 11 he says any games gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers amen that's what we call the fivefold ministry and it's not a two fold ministry it's not a three fold ministry it's a five fold ministry amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ the body of Christ still needs edifying still needs perfecting amen and there is a word they'll do that and it comes through what the fivefold ministry and what and what will that what will that perfection do what will that do it says until we all who's part of that all that's still stant amen until we all come in the unity of the faith we have to be united with st. Paul and believe like he believed of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man oh my perfect body until the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is squash this which is the head even Christ so the body this body has a head have you have you taught have you heard from him lately have you talked to him lately do you know him are you part of the body of Christ the crew the body of Christ knows it's head amen amen now if you don't know the now watch if you don't know the head you will shrivel up and die watch which is the last part of the 15 there which is the head even Christ from whom from this head from whom the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love where'd all that come from from the head what brought the unity the head amen what brought the increased from the head everything came from the head who was the head Jesus Christ part of the body of the God remember that hundred thirty pound body was rejected by Satan it was rejected by the church now we come we unite ourselves with that and by a new creation we've become part of that body and he and that body is the same yesterday today and forever it has not changed now what that head a head has to have leadership remember brother Branham said the the three part meant the three part revelation of Christ the mystery that God would would first come and God be revealed completely in Jesus Christ Christ will be reveal completely in the bride amen and then a New Eden the earth will be remodeled and she would have a new home amen amen now let's turn over to Colossians two washes to verse fourteen blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances which was against us which was contrary us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross having spoil of principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it what happened the reversing of the curse through his death on the cross all that was done in during the fall has now been reversed openly triumphing over upon the cross right when he proved it by rising up again on the third day that that body was was now a part of the new creation and out of that body he was creating a new race amen amen the verse 60 says let no man therefore because of this let no man therefore judge you in meat or a drink or in respect of a holyday or of the new moon or the Sabbath days or saying you have to do this or you have to do that or or or you have to go to this church or believe this doctrine over here or this doctrine over there which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ amen let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and have worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he has not seen vainly puffed up puffed up in his fleshly mind there's a lot of people going out and preach it they even in the name of this message they're preaching things that they've worked up in their own minds and preaching them for doctrine the commandments of men but they are not being driven by the head which is Christ amen and I astounds me to see the people that could preach the message and they don't even know their Bible and it astounds me to see that men would would come and come against an evangelist for preaching out of the Bible and not using enough quotes and not knowing where brother Branham got those quotes I'll stop there but first 16 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holyday or of the new moon or the Sabbath states which are a shadow of the things to come but the body is of Christ let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels we have a reward saints less being part of the body of Lord Jesus Christ which is a greater thing than most people even realize amen intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up in his own fleshly mind and not holding the head which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of God so there is a body and it's growing it's expanding it's getting its nutrients through the veins being strengthened by the ligaments increasing so it can perform it sub I of Christ performing the same things whatever performing whatever it is that the spirit would do in this day and you are a part of that body and the head is still controlling it amen and if you look to the head you will grow up into him amen and increase these movements that are not driven by the ligaments of your old creation but now by the ligaments of the muscles of the new creation being moved by the Spirit of God because you are a new creation Amen why by holding be holding the head verse 19 there I want to read that again verse 18 let no man beguile you of your reward why by following the doctrines and thoughts of men amen Burton the last for the verse that they intruded into those things that they have not even seen vainly puffed up with his own fleshly mind and not holding the head they didn't watch Christ they got something in their own mind and they didn't keep their eyes on Christ the mainspring amen amen and if they would have kept their head their mind on Christ the head then their body by the joints and the band's the ligaments they'd have had received nourishment they have grown stronger and then they were been actually perform acts the book of Acts but right right and wrote again the new church by beholding the head amen but Philip beheld the head amen he heard the message that whatever was told him on the road to emmaus he heard it amen he knew of it amen all that Jesus told them he took it to his mind and he says I'm gonna stay here until I be endued with power from on high amen and once he was in dude with that power he went out preaching the gospel and when the angel of the Lord needed someone to preach that gospel because I know I'll go grab Phillip he is part of my body he is flesh of my flesh he is bone of my bone and he sent him and when Philip opened up his mouth the word of creative word of God went out and then the eunuch was created a new creation and changed into a man a body the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so are we we are the body of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham he talked about you know the Cadillac that had all the all eight cylinders freshly cleaned out right off the factory a tank full gasoline the spark plugs tightened in there torture with the torque wrench to a certain torque amen and there and with a certain gap on the spark plug and everything going there you know and but if that main plug to the coil is off no matter how fine your Cadillac is they've been the first 1962 model that ever had air-conditioning might have been a fine model of vehicle with buttons they have where they go and do things little wires and everything but without that spark being able to get to where it needs to go the whole thing is a bunch of junk wouldn't do what it was designed to do just a bunch of junk and so are we without that spark of the Holy Spirit in our lives if we do not behold the head which is Christ if he can't turn you but he can't turn you into the body of Christ if the head cannot control you and tell you what to do then how can you say I am connected to the head which is the know you've been decapitated you are not a part of the body of Christ because the head can control the body and if he can't control you then you are testifying that you are not part of that body amen amen in closing let's turn to Romans chapter 8 the old creator could not produce Christ that's why the spirit sent Philip to the eunuch eunuch had gone to the wrong Jerusalem so God had to send a part of the New Jerusalem let's go meet him a mint part of the body of Christ Romans chapter 8 verse 11 first ten let's read verse ten if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead was the body of Christ was laying there in the grave cold dead and what something sprung into it God Almighty sprung to it resurrected it he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you let no man beguile you of your reward amen therefore brethren we are debtors oh I thought we were free you know this message sets people free it sets people free from the bondage of Catholic Lutheran Methodist what the problem is is I see so many people who get set free from Catholic Baptist Methodist but they don't get rebound to Christ and and you can see the evidence of it because they get set free from that and then they run off on these wild tangents and grabbing this and grabbing that and they go off over and they don't even know Christ why because the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead didn't enter into their body to make them a part of the body of Christ if I where I was eight eleven but if this of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you now brethren we are debtors debtors always say oh we're free no no no no we are free from that but we I'd the prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ I beseech you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if he through the spirit oh now we are debtors to the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body he shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God but if you are not led by the Spirit of God then you are not a son of God but they all preach things that are worked up by their own fleshly mind and cannot even prove that they are tied to the head amen remember 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit though we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified together there will be suffering they meant for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us amen what is that the adoption it goes right into the adoption amen the glory of Lord being revealed in us adopted sons the daughters of God God can finally do with you everything that the body of Christ was supposed to do then we can truly say that Jesus Christ is the same why because he has just as much power over our body as he had over his body if the when Jesus was in his own body that he was that God created the 130 pounds of dirt when the the spirit spoke to the mind the mind spoke to the body it did exactly what the Spirit wanted to do and now we are a new creation the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and whatever the head says if he is the same if the head is the same then the body has to be the same a mint then we got to do exactly what the head says and if Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's why the signs and the wonders and all those things appear why because Jesus Christ is the same but what's he doing it through he's doing it through his body and he has a body on this earth it's his bride she is the flesh of his flesh she is the bone of his bone and she does exactly what the head does tells her to do through the spirit that's why he should walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called i'm beseeching you brethren walk worthy of the vocation where keep yourself clean keeps up why so the spirit the head can't work through you so that Christ can be the same yesterday today and forever brother Branham had the revelation of it and prophesied over the bride so the bright I have the revelation of it and here we are living proof testimony of the message of the hour if so be that the spirit can work through you and bring forth the message of your day through your body there's many good Methodists that brought forth the method the eighth in the ages method Methodism they were true to John Wesley's message and they bore witness to what God is doing in that day there was a lot of foolishness but there's a lot that were true to it a man in the days of Luther there was many people that were faithful to Martin Luther's message and so is in the state as we meet people they're faithful to the message of brother brand and they will see that seed come for us but the thing is is this seat is the last seat to bring you into perfection not just another age but the end of the ages to bring for a bride for Christ a bride virgin of the word Amen Amy let's just an amen when you're when you're when you see it like that brother Bram said he said notice but Christ we believe were an endtime do we do you believe that before you have a crop now you have to plant the seed before you have a crop you have to plant the seed it says do you see why I've let the church's turn me out tell me everything call me all kinds of names and everything and yet I just stay right with that word see there's a plant the seeds been planted it's already been planted friends it's already done I can say it now it's over that's right she's done been planted oh yeah so has the denominational seat and all the rest of them seeds gunmen planted was it God had God what God wired a crop right you wanted a bright wanna crop that's what he do right before the end you want a crop at the end it's right before the end he sends a profit that profit has a message that message has a seat and se goes out and all the world play it on tape players everywhere and it'll go and find some hearts and they'll become exactly what that message is and when they stay and when they and when you now you can take that message and you can it will set you free but you must be rebound to Christ be set free from all the denominations all foolishness but get rebound to the head that's how you become the new creation they can argue about all the tapes and the different things and whether there's ministry now or they can argue about whether there's pastors anymore they let them have all those arguments let me just behold the head Christ I don't want any part of it I just want to see Christ I know what the message is I've seen it I've heard it I've listened to it I know it's for somebody and I know that it has to have a fruit amen and that fruit is a greater reward let me beseech you then what the denominations can tell you about it's not just a career not just a church walk not just this little thing over here but it is we're there is we're actually eating the day that brother Graham said we were in we're really there the last days amen and there is a seat so there could be a crop at the last day which is the variety of Lord Jesus Christ flesh of his flesh bone of his bone she will be him by the word by the blood amen part of him joint eres amen and he is the same so then she becomes the same by the head which is Christ when she gets bound to the head Christ amen let's just power has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father even as the eunuch went to the wrong Jerusalem Lord even so I Lord went to the wrong Jerusalem for a long time the Lord you redirected me and set me free Father now I've looked to you Lord so that I could become your prisoner father a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord than all things you might have the preeminence in my life floor Lord always be holding that head always be holding that spirit Lord what would you like to do this day or what do you want to do today lord I am here I am at your service Lord Lord I want to be about my father's business here my lord send me willing Lord or let me get all the junk out of my life Lord as Paul said I beseech you walk worthy I got something I'm trying to get over to you you're taking it in a natural way but I'm eat it to you in a spiritual way a crop has to grow lord I pray for your Holy Spirit to have free reign Lord in this assembly father that the church here will be blessed Lord and in all things we'd be headed behold the head Christ Lord that we would not be a try to be another denomination I believe in this or believing that or looking to some other headquarters but our headquarters is in glory and believing on the
