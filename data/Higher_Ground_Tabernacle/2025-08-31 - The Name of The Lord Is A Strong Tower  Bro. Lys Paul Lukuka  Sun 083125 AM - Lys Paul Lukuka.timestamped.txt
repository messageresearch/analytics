[46:47] knowing that you are here this morning,
[46:52] as we surrender the service into your
[46:54] hand in the name of Jesus Christ.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open our Bible to
[47:03] uh Joshua chapter 20 verse 1-10.
[47:12] Joshua chapter 20 verse 1 to verse 10.
[47:19] And like I was saying, Wednesday
[47:22] the
[47:23] &gt;&gt; I still don't get used to preaching.
[47:25] Like every time I get up here, I get
[47:27] super nervous at first.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; But I like that because I put my trust
[47:35] in God.
[47:38] Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The Lord also spake
[47:41] unto Joshua, saying, speak to the
[47:44] children of Israel, saying, I point out
[47:46] for you for you cities of refuge,
[47:49] whereof I speak unto you by the hand of
[47:51] Moses,
[48:00] that the slayer that kleth any person
[48:02] unawares, and and unwittingly may flee
[48:07] theater, and they shall be your refuge
[48:09] from the avenger of blood.
[48:13] [Music]
[48:20] And when he does and and when he that do
[48:23] flee unto one of those cities shall
[48:25] stand at the enterings of the gates of
[48:27] the city, and shall declare his cause in
[48:29] the ears of the elders of that city,
[48:31] they shall take him into the city unto
[48:34] them, and give him a place that he may
[48:36] dwell among them.
[48:49] And if the avenger of the of blood
[48:51] pursue after him, then they shall
[48:53] deliver the slayer up into his hands,
[48:56] because he smote his neighbor
[48:58] unwittingly and hated him uh not before
[49:01] time.
[49:12] and he shall dwell in that city until he
[49:15] stand before the congregation for
[49:17] judgment and until the death of the high
[49:19] priest that shall be in those days. Then
[49:21] shall the slayer return and come unto
[49:24] his own city, unto his own house, unto
[49:27] the city from whence he fled.
[49:45] and and then they named those cities. So
[49:47] there were it was six cities of refuge
[49:50] and
[49:52] verse seven and they appointed Kadesh in
[49:54] Galilee in Mount Napali Sashm. So they
[49:58] pretty much list those six cities.
[50:05] Amen. Let's turn to Proverbs chapter 18
[50:08] verse 10.
[50:22] Proverb 18:10, the Bible says, "The name
[50:25] of the Lord is a strong tower.
[50:28] The righteous runth into it and he's
[50:30] safe.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna read that again. One more
[50:37] time. The name of the Lord is a strong,
[50:39] not a weak but a strong tower.
[50:45] The righteous runth into it and is safe.
[50:50] May the Lord add a blessing to reading
[50:52] of his word. You may have your seat.
[50:56] I'll title the sermon this morning uh
[50:59] the name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; You know, I like how the Bible
[51:07] emphasizes on a strong tower. It could
[51:10] have just said the name of the Lord is a
[51:11] tower,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; but the Bible says it is a strong tower.
[51:22] You know that's that means it's
[51:23] something that you can put your trust
[51:25] in.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; And as we read in Joshua chapter 20
[51:30] verse uh 1-10,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; let me explain what that verse is.
[51:40] God had set a law uh in Exodus I believe
[51:43] where if you kill someone then people
[51:46] can come to you and kill you for killing
[51:48] another person.
[51:55] But God God also knows that he know but
[51:58] sometimes you can kill someone by
[52:00] accident. You didn't you didn't mean to
[52:01] kill the person.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; So then God told Joshua that I said
[52:07] cities of refuge
[52:11] &gt;&gt; so that when you kill someone by
[52:13] accident by mistakes you you didn't mean
[52:15] to do it.
[52:21] Then if you run to that city before your
[52:23] avengers find you,
[52:28] then the the the you go at the gates and
[52:30] you make your case.
[52:34] And then the man at the gates is going
[52:36] to welcome you into the city.
[52:39] And whenever you are in that city, you
[52:41] are safe from your avengers.
[52:45] You know, you you stay there until the
[52:48] they give you a trial.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And as we read until the high priest
[52:52] that was at that time dies, then you can
[52:54] go out.
[52:56] But when you were in that city of
[52:58] refuge, nothing could harm you.
[53:01] Where where you were in that city of
[53:03] refuge, nothing could touch you.
[53:07] That's why the Bible tells us that that
[53:08] city of refuge is the name of the Lord.
[53:14] When you have it, when you you take the
[53:16] name of the Lord with you, nothing can
[53:17] touch you.
[53:20] When you have the name of the Lord with
[53:22] you, nothing can harm you.
[53:26] And the Bible says it is a strong tower.
[53:31] It's something that it doesn't matter
[53:33] what the enemy throws at you.
[53:37] You know, if God says something is
[53:39] strong, that thing must be very strong.
[53:44] So you they kill you kill someone by
[53:47] accident.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; How many times we that's what iniquity
[53:50] is you know you know doing something
[53:53] that you know you ought not to do and
[53:55] you keep doing that
[53:57] and and then many times we we fall into
[54:00] things that we don't mean to even do
[54:03] Paul
[54:05] said the good that I want to do I don't
[54:08] do.
[54:11] But what I don't want to do, that's what
[54:13] I do.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; But every time you fall into the scene
[54:16] that you you didn't mean to make it,
[54:20] I'm telling you this morning that
[54:21] there's a city of refuge.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; There is a place where you can run to
[54:26] and be safe
[54:30] and that thing is the name of the Lord.
[54:34] the prophet the Bible says that in
[54:35] Deuteronomy there's only one place where
[54:37] God the worshiper uh uh the worshipper
[54:40] can worship God
[54:45] I believe it's in uh Deuteronomy chapter
[54:47] 16 to2
[54:49] chapter 16 verse two
[54:51] the Bible says thou shalt therefore
[54:54] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[54:56] God
[55:00] of the flock and the herd
[55:04] where in the place which the Lord shall
[55:06] choose to place his name there.
[55:09] [Music]
[55:11] &gt;&gt; You notice he doesn't say to place his
[55:13] names, but he says to place his name
[55:15] there.
[55:18] And it's a place that man didn't make a
[55:19] choice, but God himself designated that
[55:22] place.
[55:24] And the prophet used this scripture to
[55:26] preach the message, God's chosen place
[55:29] of worship.
[55:31] Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; One name
[55:39] you know there's the Bible says there's
[55:40] only one name by which we are saved.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; You know that name is the Lord Jesus
[55:47] Christ. We are gathered here this
[55:50] morning because of the name of the Lord
[55:51] Jesus Christ.
[55:54] We pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[55:57] We preach in the name of Jesus Christ.
[55:59] The Bible says whatsoever you do in
[56:01] deeds or in words do it all in the name
[56:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[56:05] Why? Why? Because in that name, that
[56:08] name is a strong tower for us. Because
[56:12] when you preach in the name of Jesus
[56:13] Christ, Satan can try to to to throw his
[56:16] attacks at you, but he will not prosper.
[56:20] When when you live in the name of Jesus
[56:22] Christ, the enemy can throw his his
[56:25] arrows at you, but he will not prosper.
[56:28] When you pray in the name of Jesus
[56:30] Christ, the enemy can try to slow down
[56:32] your prayer. But one thing you know,
[56:34] your prayer will reach its destination.
[56:37] Why? Because God always finish what he
[56:39] starts. Why? Because sorry because the
[56:42] word of God is not will not return void.
[56:47] But it will always accomplish the
[56:49] purpose for which he was sent for.
[56:52] The word of God says if you ask anything
[56:54] in my name, I will give you.
[56:57] So if you take God at his word and you
[56:59] ask, you must know that you will receive
[57:01] an answer.
[57:04] That answer, it may take a few days for
[57:06] it to get there.
[57:08] It may take a few months for it to get
[57:10] there. It may even take years for it to
[57:12] get there. But one thing we know for
[57:14] sure, the answer is going to be there
[57:18] because God, the Bible says God is not a
[57:20] man that he shall lie.
[57:23] That's what that's why he told us to put
[57:25] our trust in him
[57:28] in his name. That's why we don't ask in
[57:31] any other name but the name of the Lord
[57:33] Jesus Christ.
[57:36] That's why we baptize only in the name
[57:38] of Jesus Christ.
[57:40] Everything we do must be in the name of
[57:42] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:46] Father is just a title.
[57:48] Son is just a title. Jehovah, those are
[57:51] titles. The lily of the valley, the
[57:53] bright morning star, those are titles of
[57:56] God. But God only chose one place where
[57:59] the worshipper must meet him.
[58:03] It's in the name of Jesus Christ. You
[58:05] want to find a relationship with God,
[58:07] it's in the name of Jesus Christ. You
[58:09] want to commune with God, it's in the
[58:11] name of Jesus Christ. You want to walk
[58:14] further with God in your walk as a
[58:15] Christian, it's in the name of Jesus
[58:16] Christ.
[58:18] You want to overcome the enemy, it's in
[58:20] the name of Jesus Christ.
[58:23] The name of William Brham is not going
[58:25] to overcome the enemy.
[58:27] The name of Moses is not going to
[58:28] overcome the enemy. Your name will not
[58:31] overcome the enemy. Satan is not scared
[58:34] of your name. The only name that Satan
[58:37] is is afraid of is the name of Jesus
[58:39] Christ.
[58:40] That's the only name that the Bible says
[58:42] every knee shall bow.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Bow at what? at the mention of the name
[58:47] of Jesus Christ that when you have the
[58:50] enemy comes at you with standing walking
[58:52] up to you.
[58:54] You just need to mention the name of
[58:56] Jesus Christ, he'll take a knee.
[58:59] Mention the name of Jesus Christ and
[59:00] Satan is going to take a knee.
[59:05] That's that's why God put salvation only
[59:08] in the name.
[59:11] That's why even we baptize only in that
[59:14] name.
[59:15] Brothers, make sure that everything you
[59:17] do in your life is in the name of Jesus
[59:19] Christ.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; What do I mean by that? It means that
[59:22] whatever you do must be identified with
[59:24] Christ.
[59:27] Your work at work must be identified
[59:29] with Christ.
[59:31] The way you behave yourself at church
[59:32] must be identified with Christ.
[59:38] Hallelujah.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; The way when temptation comes your way,
[59:41] it must be identified. You must be
[59:43] identified with Christ.
[59:46] How Jesus Christ resisted the devil.
[59:51] When he resisted the devil, he overcame.
[59:54] And if you also resist the devil,
[59:58] then you will overcome.
[1:00:00] Everything you do, you must be
[1:00:02] identified with Christ
[1:00:05] because that's the only name that
[1:00:07] matters.
[1:00:10] The only name that matters in the life
[1:00:12] of a Christian is the name of Jesus
[1:00:13] Christ.
[1:00:15] And this morning we are here to lift up
[1:00:17] the name of Jesus Christ. You know it's
[1:00:19] so sad out in many especially message
[1:00:22] churches.
[1:00:23] They don't really talk about the name of
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ a lot. You know it's just
[1:00:28] they always mention the prophets the
[1:00:30] prophet the prophet. It is good. But you
[1:00:33] have to know that Jesus Christ comes
[1:00:35] first. You have to know that it was
[1:00:37] Jesus Christ acting through the
[1:00:39] prophets.
[1:00:40] The prophet says that he I didn't do
[1:00:42] anything on my own.
[1:00:45] Everything that I do was by the power of
[1:00:47] Jesus Christ.
[1:00:49] And when you take anything away from
[1:00:51] what Christ has done, then you you are
[1:00:53] failing.
[1:00:56] I read a quote where the prophet says in
[1:00:58] believer thou this.
[1:01:02] He says, "Oh my," the paragraph 43,
[1:01:07] "Oh my, the little baby lived in his
[1:01:09] mother's womb for joy.
[1:01:15] Then when he was born, he preached."
[1:01:18] He's talking about John the Baptist.
[1:01:20] All the regions come around to hear him.
[1:01:25] Now the prophet said, "We wonder what
[1:01:27] kind of a message he preached." He
[1:01:29] preached
[1:01:31] He says, "We wonder what kind of a
[1:01:32] message John the Baptist preached." The
[1:01:35] prophet says he preached Christ.
[1:01:38] He says, "If the churches will quit
[1:01:40] preaching on theology
[1:01:43] and stuff like that, some kind of a
[1:01:46] human theology
[1:01:48] and some philosophy or something like
[1:01:50] that, you know, something about the
[1:01:53] flowers, the roses or something and
[1:01:55] preach Christ."
[1:01:58] He says, "If only we'll quit preaching
[1:02:00] on everything else but preach Christ."
[1:02:04] And who is Christ? Christ is the
[1:02:05] anointed.
[1:02:07] Christ is the word of God.
[1:02:10] I want a church that preaches to me the
[1:02:12] word of God.
[1:02:14] Paul says, "If any angels comes from
[1:02:16] heaven and preaches you anything outside
[1:02:17] of this word, let it be a curse."
[1:02:23] The prophet says he will draw men.
[1:02:27] If I be lifted up,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; if I be lifted up, I will draw all men
[1:02:33] unto me.
[1:02:35] That's what we want. We want us to be
[1:02:37] drawn to Christ. I don't come to church
[1:02:40] to be drawn to the pastor. I don't come
[1:02:43] to church to to be drawn to the music.
[1:02:46] But I come to church so that I get
[1:02:47] closer to God. Like the song was saying,
[1:02:50] closer to you. When something is drawing
[1:02:52] you, it's getting you closer.
[1:02:56] But you only get closer if you lift up
[1:02:58] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:02] If I be lifted up,
[1:03:06] I will draw amen all men unto you.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to make sure the way
[1:03:11] you live, lift up Jesus Christ.
[1:03:15] When the sinner is looking at you that
[1:03:18] that does he get closer to God?
[1:03:22] When the sinner looks at your life, who
[1:03:24] does he glorify?
[1:03:26] Who does he see when he sees the way you
[1:03:28] respond to your manager at work?
[1:03:33] When there's no believers around you but
[1:03:34] just worldly people out there, how do
[1:03:36] you behave at schools?
[1:03:39] Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:03:44] Is your life lifting up Jesus Christ?
[1:03:48] My precious brothers and sisters, if
[1:03:49] your life is not lifting Jesus Christ,
[1:03:51] you have failed as a Christian.
[1:03:55] If my life has not lifted up Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ, I have failed as a Christian.
[1:04:01] The the first Christians that were
[1:04:02] called Christians in the Bible,
[1:04:05] it was in a city called Antioch,
[1:04:10] the reason why they call them Christians
[1:04:14] is because they saw they were so much
[1:04:16] like Christ.
[1:04:18] So many of us bear the name Christians,
[1:04:19] but are we worthy of that name?
[1:04:25] Are you like Christ?
[1:04:27] The Bible says, "Husband, love your
[1:04:29] wives as Christ has loved the church."
[1:04:33] So in your relationship, in your
[1:04:35] marriage at home, are you a Christ at
[1:04:36] home?
[1:04:39] Are you lifting up Jesus Christ in front
[1:04:40] of your wife?
[1:04:43] Are you loving her the way God loved the
[1:04:45] church?
[1:04:48] Wife, you lift up Jesus Christ when you
[1:04:49] submit yourself to your husband.
[1:04:53] the way the church submit itself to
[1:04:54] Christ.
[1:04:57] Wife, have you submitted yourself to
[1:04:59] your husband?
[1:05:02] If you are not doing those things, you
[1:05:03] are not lifting up Jesus Christ.
[1:05:06] To be a witness doesn't just mean to go
[1:05:08] witness on the street.
[1:05:11] Witnessing starts in your own house.
[1:05:14] Witnessing starts in your own life.
[1:05:17] The Bible says you cannot point a finger
[1:05:19] an eye at someone else a finger at
[1:05:21] someone else's eye
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; without looking at yourself.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; How does like how does Christ loves his
[1:05:34] church?
[1:05:38] Jesus is faithful to his church.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave anyone
[1:05:45] behind.
[1:05:49] What the promises that he makes to his
[1:05:51] bride, he keeps them.
[1:05:55] Husbands, the remember the promises you
[1:05:58] were making to your wives when you when
[1:06:00] you were just in a relationship
[1:06:01] courting.
[1:06:05] The Bible says, "Love your wife as
[1:06:07] Christ loved the church.
[1:06:11] Christ kept all his promises."
[1:06:16] Are we keeping our promises?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Have you kept your promises to your
[1:06:20] wife? If you haven't, the Lord this
[1:06:22] morning is telling you to revisit it
[1:06:27] and start treating your wife like God
[1:06:30] wants to like God treat his church.
[1:06:35] That's how we lift up the name of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ.
[1:06:39] Ephesians 3:14:15, he says, "For this
[1:06:43] cause I bow my knees unto the father of
[1:06:45] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] of uh of of whom the whole family in
[1:06:50] heaven and earth is named."
[1:06:58] The whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:07:00] named after the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:07] So if you say that you we come from
[1:07:09] we've heard that so many times I come
[1:07:10] from God and I return back to God
[1:07:15] you know I come from my theophony and
[1:07:17] and I'm returning back there
[1:07:21] but what are you what is your name over
[1:07:23] there
[1:07:25] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:07:27] named after Christ
[1:07:31] you got to know are you part of the
[1:07:32] family of Christ or not
[1:07:36] this morning. Are you part of the family
[1:07:38] of Christ or not?
[1:07:41] How do you enter into the family of
[1:07:43] Christ? The Bible says, "By one spirit,
[1:07:46] we are baptized into the body of
[1:07:48] Christ."
[1:07:50] That's why you must have the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:53] Without the Holy Ghost, you don't even
[1:07:55] bear the name of Jesus Christ with you.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the talking.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the sign.
[1:08:04] that bears the name of Jesus Christ. But
[1:08:07] that sign doesn't stay on your forehead,
[1:08:09] but that sign is engraved in your heart.
[1:08:14] The prophet says the token was the
[1:08:15] highlight of his ministry.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Like ask yourself that question this
[1:08:26] morning. Do you have the Holy Ghost or
[1:08:27] not?
[1:08:31] You cannot lie to yourself. That's one
[1:08:32] thing for sure.
[1:08:36] Do you have the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:08:37] or not? And why don't you have the Holy
[1:08:40] Ghost?
[1:08:42] God wants to give you the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:45] but why don't you have the Holy Ghost?
[1:08:48] And the thing that's even worse, you
[1:08:49] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:52] and you know you don't have the Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost and you are just very comfortable
[1:08:56] with it.
[1:08:59] That's a very dangerous state.
[1:09:02] I pray that God gives you the
[1:09:04] revelation.
[1:09:06] If the prophet says that was the
[1:09:07] highlight of his ministry,
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; without it, you cannot make it to
[1:09:11] heaven.
[1:09:14] Without the Holy Ghost, you cannot enter
[1:09:15] into the family of Christ.
[1:09:20] Brothers and sisters, make it your
[1:09:21] priority.
[1:09:24] The Holy Ghost will make you overcome
[1:09:25] the things you cannot overcome on your
[1:09:27] own.
[1:09:28] that sin that you keep battling battling
[1:09:30] all the time and you keep falling.
[1:09:33] The Holy Ghost is there to say the
[1:09:35] battle is not yours but it's it's the
[1:09:36] Lord's.
[1:09:41] Seek the Holy Ghost with all your heart.
[1:09:45] Jesus says that when you seek me with
[1:09:46] all your heart then you will find me.
[1:09:49] But we know the problem. What we do
[1:09:51] sometimes, we just come and we see God
[1:09:53] for five minutes
[1:09:56] and we get tired, we go home. Other
[1:09:58] people, they only see God when they come
[1:10:00] to church on Sundays.
[1:10:03] When we just pray here, that's the only
[1:10:04] time they pray.
[1:10:07] Like I mentioned on Wednesday, sometime
[1:10:09] ago, God spoke to me and told me that,
[1:10:12] you know, in this church that there are
[1:10:15] people who go even an entire month
[1:10:17] without even praying.
[1:10:21] I wonder how you survive.
[1:10:24] You know, let me my own experience as a
[1:10:26] Christian.
[1:10:29] I find myself falling a lot when I don't
[1:10:31] pray.
[1:10:39] I am the weakest when I don't pray.
[1:10:44] And you think the devil doesn't know it.
[1:10:45] He knows it.
[1:10:48] Why is he fighting the prayer life
[1:10:49] around your life?
[1:10:52] Because he knows that your strength.
[1:10:56] The prophet says that prayer is stronger
[1:10:58] than even atomic weapon.
[1:11:01] That even when the weakest Christian
[1:11:03] gets on their knees,
[1:11:06] God has to answer to his prayer.
[1:11:09] So Satan knows it. But that's the thing
[1:11:12] he fights you the most.
[1:11:15] You wonder how every time you just want
[1:11:17] to pray,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; destruction comes your way.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; It can't be like I am tired from work.
[1:11:27] You know, it can be taking care of the
[1:11:29] kids. There's even a a place I remember
[1:11:32] the prophet's uh is hidden life in
[1:11:34] Christ. I believe
[1:11:36] he gives an advice to mothers.
[1:11:39] He says, "Wait when the the children go
[1:11:41] to work go to school.
[1:11:44] You know, he says, "Don't let the
[1:11:45] washing of clothes hinder you."
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "When the children, all the
[1:11:51] distractions are gone,
[1:11:54] hide yourself in a closet.
[1:11:57] Your husband is gone. He's gone to work.
[1:12:00] The husband, the children, children are
[1:12:02] at school. Mom, now is your time to be
[1:12:06] alone with Christ.
[1:12:09] Hide yourself there." The prophet says
[1:12:12] it will make you a better Christian.
[1:12:15] The prophet says it will make you the
[1:12:16] Christian that you ought to be.
[1:12:19] When I read, I love that quote so much.
[1:12:22] Because in my heart, I'm like, God, I
[1:12:24] have this image of a Christian that I
[1:12:25] want to be.
[1:12:29] And the prophet is giving us the answer.
[1:12:31] So he says it's it's prayer,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; consecration.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Always make time for God.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; God makes time for you.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He's the busiest person ever,
[1:12:51] but he still has time for you.
[1:12:54] Didn't the prophet preach the message?
[1:12:56] God, he cares. Do you care?
[1:13:06] You got to get to a place where you also
[1:13:07] show care for Christ.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; When you love your wife or you love your
[1:13:14] partner, you want to spend time with her
[1:13:16] or with him.
[1:13:19] Imagine you just keep telling your
[1:13:20] partner, I I love you. And you never
[1:13:22] ever spend time with her with her.
[1:13:28] especially I know from women they want
[1:13:31] to spend quality time with their
[1:13:32] partners.
[1:13:34] Imagine not just time but quality time.
[1:13:38] You know, you can buy her flowers, you
[1:13:40] can tell her you love her, but if you
[1:13:43] never spend time with her,
[1:13:46] she she's not going to she's not going
[1:13:48] to feel appreciated.
[1:13:52] I mean, sisters, is that isn't that the
[1:13:54] truth?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; You know, and also God wants quality
[1:13:58] time with you.
[1:14:01] The prophet, the prophet talks about not
[1:14:03] just when you get up in the morning,
[1:14:05] just say a quick prayer and you go to
[1:14:06] work. That's not the kind of prayer he's
[1:14:08] just looking for.
[1:14:11] God is looking for a quality time with
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:15] where you actually set time aside. No,
[1:14:18] this time is just for me and God.
[1:14:21] It will change you.
[1:14:23] It will make you Christians that you
[1:14:25] ought to be.
[1:14:28] That that was not part of my notes, but
[1:14:29] I believe God wants us to pray more.
[1:14:36] So we see that God God the Bible says
[1:14:38] God is a jealous God.
[1:14:42] For thou shalt worship no other God.
[1:14:47] For the Lord whose name is jealous
[1:14:54] and he's a jealous God.
[1:14:57] The prophet tells us anything you put
[1:14:59] before God becomes your idol.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And we know here that God is jealous.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; So why would you want to make someone
[1:15:08] that you love jealous?
[1:15:13] God will never share his glory with
[1:15:15] anyone.
[1:15:17] Not even a prophet. You know, he will
[1:15:19] not share his glory.
[1:15:26] And we see we live in uh uh let's uh the
[1:15:29] the story of Daniel and the the the
[1:15:32] worship of the of the image
[1:15:38] in the time of Mesog. I think a lot of
[1:15:41] us are familiar with that story.
[1:15:46] The prophet says that image
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; that they wanted to worship
[1:15:52] was the image of Daniel.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Daniel was the prophet of the hour.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; You know, Daniel had the word of God for
[1:16:04] that hour.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Every time they wanted to hear from God,
[1:16:07] they call on Daniel.
[1:16:10] And the prophet says that they even
[1:16:11] called Daniel a god.
[1:16:17] And the spirits don't die.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The same thing happened even throughout
[1:16:21] our age.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; People now they they want to worship the
[1:16:27] prophet of the hour
[1:16:32] because it's the same thing that repeat
[1:16:33] itself.
[1:16:36] But what happened? There were three
[1:16:37] guys,
[1:16:39] three brothers who refused to bow down
[1:16:42] to the image of man.
[1:16:46] They say they will only worship one God.
[1:16:50] They say we will not bow down before
[1:16:52] your image
[1:16:54] because our God is able to rescue us.
[1:16:58] But even if he doesn't rescue us, we
[1:17:01] will not bow down.
[1:17:04] That's the stand we need to take this
[1:17:05] morning. I will not bow down to the
[1:17:08] devil.
[1:17:09] Even when the affliction comes my way, I
[1:17:12] know my God can rescue me. But even if
[1:17:16] he doesn't rescue me, even if he doesn't
[1:17:18] heal me, I will still not bow down to
[1:17:21] the enemy. You know, I know my God can
[1:17:24] get me out of this situation. Go ahead
[1:17:26] and testify about it. Go tell it
[1:17:29] everywhere.
[1:17:30] But I also say that even if it doesn't
[1:17:32] come,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; you know, that's maturity there. Because
[1:17:36] you understand that sometimes God
[1:17:38] answers can be a no.
[1:17:41] And when you understand that, you
[1:17:42] understand that God can never fail you
[1:17:47] because even in his nose, he's still
[1:17:49] taking care of you. The Bible says
[1:17:51] everything works for good to them that
[1:17:53] love God.
[1:17:55] Once you understand that you cannot you
[1:17:58] cannot worry.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Why do we worry a lot?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want his children to worry.
[1:18:08] When problems comes your way, why do you
[1:18:10] worry?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; It's because you you will not run into
[1:18:14] that strong tower.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus says if you ask anything in my
[1:18:23] name,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; so what do you need?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word or not?
[1:18:33] I I read a place where the prophet says
[1:18:35] uh uh we we only preach Christ.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. I can only that's
[1:18:41] why I love pointing you back to the word
[1:18:44] because I understand that I cannot do
[1:18:46] anything.
[1:18:48] You know I cannot help you. The only
[1:18:51] person that can help you is Jesus
[1:18:52] Christ. So all I can do and may the Lord
[1:18:55] help me to point you to Christ
[1:18:59] to point you always to Calvary.
[1:19:02] The prophet says that in a message get
[1:19:04] to get the people to believe.
[1:19:08] He says he's the only one that can heal.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; He did it at Calvary.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And for me to do something that he did
[1:19:18] at Calvary would be robbing him of his
[1:19:20] Calvary sacrifice.
[1:19:25] So the pro the prophet is saying for me
[1:19:28] to do something that Christ did at
[1:19:29] Calvary, I will be robbing him of what
[1:19:31] he did.
[1:19:34] He says I can't do it. Christian
[1:19:36] friends,
[1:19:39] and to be honest with you, I don't
[1:19:40] believe there's anyone else that can do
[1:19:42] it.
[1:19:47] I believe the only thing that any man
[1:19:49] can do to you is to get your faith
[1:19:51] pointed towards Calvary.
[1:19:55] Brother, I believe the prophet.
[1:19:58] That's why I'm pointing you back to
[1:19:59] Calvary. I'm pointing you back to your
[1:20:02] source of healing.
[1:20:05] Healing is found only in Christ.
[1:20:08] Salvation is found only in Christ.
[1:20:12] He is my refuge.
[1:20:14] In the time of trouble, who will hide
[1:20:16] me? Only Christ will hide me.
[1:20:21] In your heart, in the time of trouble,
[1:20:22] your partner will not hide you.
[1:20:26] There is a place where you get to a
[1:20:27] place where it's only you and God.
[1:20:31] When death knocks at your door,
[1:20:34] it's only you and God. Your partner is
[1:20:37] not going to go with you. It's only you
[1:20:39] and God. But in that time, you know,
[1:20:43] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:20:45] shadow of death, I will not fear no
[1:20:48] evil. Why? Because you are my refuge.
[1:20:53] Why? Because in time of trouble you will
[1:20:55] hide me.
[1:20:57] Lord, hide me in you.
[1:21:00] The prophet says a man can get to a
[1:21:02] place so hidden in Christ till the devil
[1:21:04] doesn't know what to do with him.
[1:21:08] Lord, I want to be there.
[1:21:11] Lord, hide me in you. That when Satan
[1:21:14] comes and he's looking, he cannot find
[1:21:15] me.
[1:21:17] The Bible says when the enemy is cast
[1:21:19] out of you,
[1:21:21] he goes he goes looking for a
[1:21:22] reinforcement,
[1:21:25] he goes looking for a reinforcement and
[1:21:28] he brings 10 times that a lot more times
[1:21:31] more demons that you had before.
[1:21:34] But the Bible says when he comes,
[1:21:36] if he meets that strong man of the
[1:21:39] house,
[1:21:41] then he cannot come in anymore. But if
[1:21:43] he finds that place is empty, then he
[1:21:46] will occupy you. Oh, when Satan comes
[1:21:50] looking for you, I want to be hidden in
[1:21:52] Christ. The only see is Jesus. Oh,
[1:21:56] please, where are you? I don't see you.
[1:21:57] I see No, I see Jesus. Brother Alexis,
[1:22:00] where are you? I see Jesus. I don't want
[1:22:03] Satan to see me. I want him to see
[1:22:05] Christ. Lord, hide me in you. You know,
[1:22:08] hide me in that secret place.
[1:22:13] Jesus, hide me in that secret place.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Where the enemy doesn't know where to
[1:22:20] find me anymore.
[1:22:24] That
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; that's I believe there's a song that
[1:22:26] takes uh Lord, lift me up on higher
[1:22:28] ground. That's the name that's the name
[1:22:30] of our church. That higher ground, that
[1:22:32] place where the enemy cannot reach you
[1:22:33] anymore. You know, just keep rising.
[1:22:38] You can rise a little bit higher. Satan
[1:22:40] tries to get higher. Keep going higher.
[1:22:43] Keep going higher till you get to a
[1:22:45] place where the enemy is talking.
[1:22:47] Oh, he's like that's a different
[1:22:49] dimension. I cannot reach that
[1:22:51] dimension. That's why we call you
[1:22:53] eagles. Why? Because eagles they get so
[1:22:56] high in the air where if any other birds
[1:23:00] go, they will disintegrate.
[1:23:03] They will die. Lord, lift me up on
[1:23:05] higher ground that when the afflictions
[1:23:08] of this of this life comes my way,
[1:23:11] When depression knocks at my door, when
[1:23:13] anxiety knocks knocks at my door, when
[1:23:15] fear knocks at my door, oh fear has to
[1:23:18] die, fear has to go. Why? Because I am
[1:23:22] found in you. Oh, Satan is like, that's
[1:23:24] a different level. That's a different
[1:23:26] level. That's a different height. I
[1:23:30] can't get there.
[1:23:32] Lord, take me to that height.
[1:23:36] What is it? A tower is not something
[1:23:39] small.
