[54:27] so you have to get in the spirit and get
[54:29] a little warm
[54:31] you love the lord people thank god for
[54:34] his grace
[54:38] a long time we'll go right on into the
[54:39] word of god
[54:46] don't have my ipad this morning
[54:51] it locked up on me
[54:54] so i had to come with the message this
[54:57] morning
[55:00] i spent several days working on the one
[55:02] that's on the ipad
[55:28] we've been preaching on a lot of things
[55:32] being born
[55:46] don't feel strange
[55:50] yourself at home amen
[55:54] everybody in here is human
[55:57] we're people
[56:01] and we love fellowship
[56:05] and to our visitors i trust that the
[56:07] people of god will love on you after
[56:09] service
[56:13] because that's what this is all about
[56:17] it really is a family of faiths
[56:20] as we stand
[56:24] let us turn to acts 17th chapter
[56:28] action
[56:41] in the way that we think
[56:46] in the way that we perceive things
[56:53] as you have heard me say many
[57:10] and the only way that we can reflect him
[57:14] is that he himself
[57:17] is within us
[57:21] reflecting god has can never be by human
[57:24] ability
[57:28] you can work like a horse
[57:33] [Music]
[57:37] and all of your accomplishments
[57:44] to god will be as filthy rags
[57:51] so in order to make the heaven
[57:55] we need what it takes to get there
[58:00] and we have learned that we ourselves
[58:04] cannot make this happen
[58:08] this is why we need the grace of god
[58:13] acts 17 actually 26 22
[58:20] 72
[58:23] my subject beginning to this morning
[58:26] will be
[58:28] the destiny of god's will
[58:34] destiny
[58:36] 17 a book the book of acts 17 chapter
[58:39] 22.
[58:48] i'm sorry acts 17 actually 26
[58:51] verses 22 through 31.
[59:07] then paul stood in the midst of mars
[59:10] hill and said you men of athens
[59:14] i perceive that in all things
[59:18] you are too superstitious
[59:20] [Music]
[59:29] for as i passed by and beheld
[59:32] your devotion i found an altar with this
[59:36] inscription
[59:37] to the unknown god whom therefore ye
[59:40] ignorantly worship him worship him
[59:43] declare unto you
[59:59] world and all things therein seeing that
[1:00:02] he
[1:00:03] is lord of heaven and earth
[1:00:06] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[1:00:17] neither is worship with men's hands as
[1:00:20] though he
[1:00:21] needed anything seeing he giveth to all
[1:00:24] life and breath and all things
[1:00:35] and have made of one blood all nations
[1:00:38] of men to dwell on on
[1:00:42] all the earth face of the earth excuse
[1:00:45] me
[1:00:53] i hope you all got that one blood thing
[1:00:58] there's only one race and that is the
[1:01:01] human race
[1:01:06] and have determined the time
[1:01:09] before appointed in the bounds of their
[1:01:13] inhabitations
[1:01:20] that they should seek the lord if
[1:01:22] happily they might feel
[1:01:24] after him and find him though he be
[1:01:27] not far from every one of us
[1:01:39] for in him we live and move
[1:01:43] and have our being as certain also of
[1:01:46] your own
[1:01:47] prophets have said for ye are also the
[1:01:50] offspring his offspring
[1:02:01] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:02:04] of god
[1:02:05] we ought not to think that the godhead
[1:02:07] is likened to gold
[1:02:09] or silver or stone or graven by
[1:02:12] arts and man's device
[1:02:18] without divinity
[1:02:25] and the time of this ignorance god
[1:02:29] went at but now commended
[1:02:32] all
[1:02:46] a day in the which we he will
[1:02:49] judge the world in righteousness
[1:02:53] by the man whom he have ordained
[1:02:56] whereof he have given assurance
[1:03:00] unto all men in that he have raised him
[1:03:03] from the dead
[1:03:15] this is that this third verse 32nd verse
[1:03:18] and when they heard the of the
[1:03:21] resurrection of the dead
[1:03:23] some mocked and
[1:03:26] other says we will hear
[1:03:42] we come before you lord jesus we know
[1:03:44] how we'll see
[1:03:46] and we thank you for your amazing grace
[1:03:50] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:03:53] god who cleanses us from all our own
[1:03:56] rights
[1:04:10] that we would bring forth a hundredfold
[1:04:15] in jesus christ's name amen amen you may
[1:04:19] be seated moves us off
[1:04:26] i was so glad when our brother jose told
[1:04:28] us that he was going to be
[1:04:29] off
[1:04:37] what a victory we appreciate
[1:04:40] uh all of you this morning
[1:04:45] hey man i'm glad to see my sister
[1:04:48] sitting over there and she's holding by
[1:04:50] myself
[1:04:51] she's not hadn't seen her in a while so
[1:04:54] there's so many you know
[1:04:55] she works out of town and so therefore
[1:04:57] she she's been here when i wasn't here
[1:05:02] we always have her in our prayers
[1:05:05] when we think about what's happening now
[1:05:12] surely everybody at some point in time
[1:05:16] would like to run away and find a hiding
[1:05:20] place
[1:05:26] and there are times you know you feel
[1:05:28] like god
[1:05:30] can you take me now you have to follow
[1:05:34] something it's because of
[1:05:37] all of the pressures that we're now
[1:05:39] facing
[1:05:42] things that we have never seen
[1:05:47] no have ever heard
[1:05:57] and we talk about the last days
[1:06:00] a long period of time
[1:06:18] and that means that the grace and mercy
[1:06:22] of god
[1:06:24] has come to an end
[1:06:27] mankind will be reproved
[1:06:32] hallelujah now i want to say this to
[1:06:35] those who are angry at each other this
[1:06:37] morning
[1:06:40] that is the spirit of the enemy that's
[1:06:42] doing that great
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:57] you need to focus on what god is doing
[1:06:59] this is
[1:07:01] a very serious time that we're living in
[1:07:05] this is a time where god is calling for
[1:07:07] mature christians
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] and you must know that god is real if
[1:07:15] this
[1:07:16] is sensitive to your feelings right now
[1:07:22] when i was reading this morning
[1:07:26] i thought well if god had a diary
[1:07:33] this would be it
[1:07:37] the bible in itself
[1:07:40] tells us that the things that god did
[1:07:44] throughout out all the history of man
[1:07:49] we read it like it's some history book
[1:07:52] no
[1:07:52] let it come only for this one but it's
[1:07:55] more than the history book messi please
[1:07:57] click what it is
[1:07:58] this is the book of life
[1:08:02] yeah understand me your company
[1:08:05] hear paul it was simple
[1:08:10] come to a place
[1:08:13] where people were worshiping all kinds
[1:08:15] of gods
[1:08:19] and to make sure they didn't
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:09:04] he's not your church dogmas
[1:09:07] god is not your traditions
[1:09:11] the bible said that god is a spirit
[1:09:15] and they that worship him must worship
[1:09:18] him in
[1:09:19] spirit and in truth
[1:09:23] hallelujah and here paul says
[1:09:27] i'm going to declare unto you
[1:09:31] this unknown god should you
[1:09:45] this resurrection because we know
[1:09:50] no man come to life
[1:09:55] and when you talk about a resurrection
[1:09:58] that in itself is a mystery
[1:10:14] because he declared i am the
[1:10:16] resurrection
[1:10:18] i am the light and he proved it
[1:10:21] he raised a man from the dead
[1:10:26] for four days hallelujah you love the
[1:10:30] lord you're producing your heart
[1:10:31] now we know that there is a destiny
[1:10:36] but how are you going to know god come
[1:10:39] on somebody
[1:10:40] there are thousands of gods
[1:10:51] god is not like a statue juniper coming
[1:10:53] in he's not some
[1:10:55] object that you have made like unto man
[1:10:59] hallelujah he's beyond that
[1:11:03] he is the creator of all things
[1:11:07] he is even your creator
[1:11:10] and
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:21] you understand me amen when god gave you
[1:11:24] the breath of life
[1:11:26] hallelujah it was at that point
[1:11:37] and no man can shorten his time
[1:11:43] is that right no man can just die
[1:11:47] everything is on a calendar
[1:11:51] everything is set in order by god
[1:11:55] hallelujah if you think you are in
[1:11:58] control of your life
[1:12:01] let me see how long you can hold your
[1:12:03] breath
[1:12:06] photo
[1:12:48] you must surrender
[1:13:01] and how can you say that brother isaiah
[1:13:04] i'll say it like this where were you
[1:13:08] before you got here hallelujah
[1:13:12] they say you were in your mother's womb
[1:13:16] but where
[1:13:54] you can search the scriptures day and
[1:13:56] night
[1:13:57] and if god does not open the scripture
[1:14:00] if he doesn't reveal himself to you
[1:14:04] you won't even know it this is why
[1:14:08] so many people have doctors degrees
[1:14:12] in
[1:14:17] hallelujah is that the truth it was like
[1:14:20] that in jesus day
[1:14:23] the pharisees they were the
[1:14:26] intellectuals of the scroll
[1:14:29] and when they came in contact with jesus
[1:14:34] recognizing him instead of saying you
[1:14:37] are the son of god
[1:14:39] they called him a devil
[1:14:42] see because if you don't know how god
[1:14:44] behaves
[1:14:46] you really wouldn't know him let's go on
[1:14:50] the bible says that god is a spirit and
[1:14:52] i'm gonna try to hurry
[1:14:54] and they that worship him must worship
[1:14:56] him in spirit and in truth
[1:15:01] and the truth of the matter is
[1:15:04] if you come into this world
[1:15:20] it's okay if you're a doctor
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:16:04] oh i wish i was living you know
[1:16:07] revelation is something else well you're
[1:16:09] living in revelation

[1:16:37] because my handwriting is pretty bad
[1:16:40] so i got really scared
[1:16:43] when we think about what god
[1:16:47] did in the beginnings to show you his
[1:16:49] purpose
[1:16:52] he created the animals he created the
[1:16:55] trees
[1:16:58] and then he met
[1:17:02] and in genesis he created man in his
[1:17:05] image
[1:17:09] the first chapter he created man in his
[1:17:11] own image
[1:17:14] as a match
[1:17:25] and that man was in the image of god
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:41] image of god
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:18:08] you have a representation of yourself
[1:18:46] you see a lot of times people come to
[1:18:48] church
[1:18:49] and they come to church to hear a sermon
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:05] he's speaking to his people
[1:19:21] he's the spirit and the bible says no
[1:19:25] no man have seen god at any time
[1:19:29] oh but i've seen him you may have seen
[1:19:32] his housing
[1:19:39] how many of you have seen the holy ghost

[1:20:09] and the word is god and that
[1:20:13] word is jesus christ and jesus christ

[1:24:47] hallelujah now one thing about god i
[1:24:50] want to say because i don't have to
[1:24:51] hurry
[1:24:53] he is unchangeable
[1:24:57] and i want to say to my visiting friends
[1:25:00] and all other builders
[1:25:02] christians this water is just absolutely
[1:25:06] delicious
[1:25:11] it's called naturally alkaline
[1:25:17] and inside the bottle is called eternal
[1:25:20] interior
[1:25:25] you understand me i have no company and
[1:25:28] i can ask you

[1:25:36] you guys
[1:25:40] the way you're drinking it look like
[1:25:42] it's delicious

[1:25:49] is
[1:25:52] until you come
[1:25:59] i can tell you by somebody else's
[1:26:00] testimony god is good
[1:26:06] but
[1:26:34] let's go back to the garden of eden
[1:26:36] quickly
[1:26:38] but in the garden of eden adam
[1:26:41] and adam knew god i don't you couldn't
[1:26:44] say
[1:26:45] i did that on purpose it was not adam
[1:26:49] and eve
[1:26:50] it was adam and adam
[1:26:53] they both had the same name because they
[1:26:56] had the same characters
[1:26:58] they were made in the image and likeness
[1:27:00] of god
[1:27:16] hallelujah
[1:27:30] but before he was in it he was only out
[1:27:34] you understand me and so we find out
[1:27:37] that god had a plan
[1:27:39] and the first thing he told adam i want
[1:27:42] you to be fruitful and multiple
[1:28:12] you know what i'm talking about it's not
[1:28:15] there
[1:28:16] the point is we must return
[1:28:21] back to the state we were in
[1:28:25] before the fall
[1:28:39] and remember the longer
[1:28:42] man stayed away from the presence of god
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:47] the more his eyes became dim it pleases
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:53] so much so their eyes became blind
[1:29:01] they didn't know him they didn't know
[1:29:03] what he looked like
[1:29:04] hallelujah so when god came in the form
[1:29:07] of a man he lost
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:20] mathematically perfect mathematics
[1:29:24] that could endure the tsunami waves
[1:29:30] of the flood without it sinking
[1:29:34] hallelujah the most intelligent man
[1:29:38] of our day hallelujah built the ship
[1:29:42] called the titanic
[1:29:48] hallelujah when they thought it was
[1:29:50] unsinkable
[1:29:52] hallelujah you know what i say they
[1:29:55] should have pulled up noah
[1:29:57] and asked how he built his ship was it
[1:30:00] hallelujah
[1:30:01] you see because he had a word from god
[1:30:10] [Music]
[1:30:14] hallelujah you know what i'm saying the
[1:30:16] bible says
[1:30:17] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[1:30:20] it be in this day
[1:30:22] so don't say oh if i was in the days of
[1:30:24] noah
[1:30:25] i would have heard noah but if you don't
[1:30:29] hear god now
[1:30:30] hallelujah through the voice of a
[1:30:32] preacher you wouldn't have heard him
[1:30:34] then
[1:30:35] hallelujah because noah was a mighty
[1:30:38] preacher
[1:30:39] he had to go against all odds
[1:30:42] it had never rained in that day
[1:30:46] it had never
[1:30:51] hallelujah he was speaking in a language
[1:30:53] he's finally hearing
[1:30:54] guys that the people had never heard of
[1:30:56] the legion of people the scientists were
[1:30:58] saying
[1:31:00] never been is ninja and it will
[1:31:03] never happen hallelujah but noah
[1:31:06] preached a hundred and twenty years
[1:31:10] you see what i'm saying they have
[1:31:13] discovered noah's ark
[1:31:24] [Music]
[1:31:29] this is it see something
[1:31:41] the first alien we know of was the
[1:31:42] serpent
[1:31:45] he was not of the bloodline
[1:31:48] and that makes me excited so anyhow
[1:31:51] that's wrong
[1:31:51] yeah remember i said one blood but
[1:31:53] anyway let's go
[1:31:56] so here was god behind human flesh it
[1:31:59] was a jew by the name of noah
[1:32:05] hallelujah and only eight souls
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:09] eight souls in that day saw god
[1:32:15] they looked beyond noah's fault and they
[1:32:17] saw
[1:32:18] god god's warning
[1:32:23] and thank you to it
[1:32:40] because we're living in such a
[1:32:42] scientific age
[1:32:44] don't get me wrong science has
[1:32:47] its place but when science can't give
[1:32:51] you what you need
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:04] can you see me now oh that great science
[1:33:08] right that's what i would do i would bow
[1:33:10] before it is
[1:33:11] a scripture if it fail but i i don't
[1:33:12] worship science measures
[1:33:14] i worship the god that made the
[1:33:16] scientists
[1:33:18] hallelujah listen the bible says in
[1:33:20] diverse
[1:33:34] is
[1:33:43] he doesn't have his own interpretation
[1:33:46] that's why the bible says
[1:33:47] the word of god is not of any men's
[1:33:49] private interpretation
[1:33:52] because god interprets what he needs by
[1:33:54] way of a prophet
[1:33:57] let's move on hallelujah now the bible
[1:34:00] says
[1:34:01] that if the words of the prophets were
[1:34:02] steadfast
[1:34:04] or the way the words of the angels
[1:34:06] because that's what god called them
[1:34:08] angels
[1:34:10] i know a lot of people believe
[1:34:14] and they believe that angels got winged
[1:34:16] quite
[1:34:30] you just
[1:34:42] hallelujah you understand me so let's
[1:34:44] move on by god's grace
[1:34:47] no you said well what do you mean
[1:34:48] brother bro you and i
[1:34:50] are elements or how can i say you and i
[1:34:54] are products of the fall
[1:34:58] we came in as sinners so there's no way
[1:35:01] i can
[1:35:02] preach we came in as sinners something
[1:35:04] you can't be sure
[1:35:05] and we're products of sin
[1:35:08] we come through this life hating the
[1:35:12] fact
[1:35:24] have you not ever been jealous of
[1:35:26] somebody
[1:35:41] foreign you understand me that's because
[1:35:44] of sin
[1:35:46] you know oh we you know i hear i hear
[1:35:48] women say that all the time
[1:35:50] oh she just thinks she's something
[1:35:55] usually when they do say that it's a
[1:35:57] little jealousy
[1:35:59] it's like you're not getting the
[1:36:01] attention
[1:36:03] okay so there's a little jealousy there

[1:36:52] beginning
[1:36:54] they were the the scene part of god can
[1:36:56] i say it like that
[1:36:58] they were the part that you could see
[1:37:01] they were very
[1:37:02] housing whatever god wanted them to do
[1:37:05] they did it
[1:37:07] they didn't have their will they didn't
[1:37:09] have that you know it was always the
[1:37:11] will of god

[1:40:34] but
[1:40:48] you know god is good people even in our
[1:40:51] civilizations

[1:41:01] is that right thou shalt not kill
[1:41:04] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear

[1:41:15] and some kind of peace
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:29] you're not going a dog

[1:42:02] little creators
[1:42:04] hallelujah we can see visions
[1:42:07] we can take trees that are actually
[1:42:10] standing there
[1:42:12] and take paint
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] this is not where god wants us to remain

[1:42:50] experience hallelujah
[1:42:52] you mean to tell me you've got god with
[1:42:55] you
[1:42:56] are you bored he said i'll never leave
[1:42:58] you
[1:43:00] will i forsake you i will always be with
[1:43:03] you
[1:43:03] so evidently if you bored i don't see
[1:43:06] that means god is not there
[1:43:08] oh you don't recognize him as being
[1:43:10] there somebody help me here
[1:43:12] oh oh i feel so lonely that spirit is up
[1:43:15] to the devil hallelujah
[1:43:17] because let me tell you something when
[1:43:19] god is walking with you
[1:43:21] and you're walking with god he's the
[1:43:23] majority all by himself
[1:43:26] hallelujah i'm preaching something
[1:43:29] that's not even in my notes
[1:43:32] god always tried to reveal himself to
[1:43:34] jesus what he's trying to do
[1:43:36] trying to heal himself
[1:43:51] that's what calvary was all about that
[1:43:54] was
[1:43:54] what the cross was all about he's gonna
[1:43:57] die
[1:43:59] so that you will not have to die
[1:44:01] hallelujah he rose again
[1:44:03] so that you can rise y'all understand me
[1:44:06] he took your sins you might become his
[1:44:10] righteousness
[1:44:11] hallelujah and what are you saying the
[1:44:14] greatest privilege i've ever had
[1:44:17] is what i am now
[1:44:30] about my past that might even make you
[1:44:32] walk out
[1:44:36] hallelujah but i can also tell you some
[1:44:38] things
[1:44:40] that where i am now god brought me here
[1:44:44] it was not about human effort
[1:44:51] i did all the worldly things that
[1:44:53] everybody else was doing
[1:44:56] hallelujah but when the holy ghost came
[1:44:58] here
[1:44:59] god changed me
[1:45:28] i'm a methodist
[1:45:38] hallelujah all of that becomes idolatry
[1:45:41] hallelujah what gods want to hear that
[1:45:44] i'm a christian
[1:45:46] i've been born again i've got god on the
[1:45:49] inside
[1:45:50] and i'm walking with him and he's
[1:45:51] welcome
[1:45:53] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:45:55] believe that
[1:46:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:13] yeah but if you're struggling with
[1:46:16] people even here
[1:46:18] what you say hallelujah because when god
[1:46:22] comes in
[1:46:23] it's not a new lease on life it's a new
[1:46:26] life
[1:46:28] it's god in you which is the hope of
[1:46:31] glory
[1:46:33] hallelujah now when we look
[1:46:48] but anyway uh
[1:46:52] god is creating a new creature
[1:46:56] a new creation and this is where a lot
[1:46:58] of christians don't know
[1:46:59] this is what they said yourself god
[1:47:02] never ordained you to just go to church
[1:47:06] pack your
[1:47:20] all right you know so that's not
[1:47:22] christianity
[1:47:25] christianity is the life of jesus christ
[1:47:29] you see people who say they're
[1:47:31] christians and their behavior
[1:47:33] doesn't become this
[1:47:49] y'all hear what i'm saying so we know
[1:47:52] and they know it is the life of god
[1:47:56] i'm talking about something here this is
[1:47:59] just the foundation of what i'm trying
[1:48:00] to get to
[1:48:02] i'm trying to tell you something there
[1:48:04] is a destiny
[1:48:06] there is an end that we must all come to
[1:48:09] um and this end must be according to the
[1:48:12] word of god
[1:48:15] you know when you get to heaven you're
[1:48:16] not going to have
[1:48:18] the the the catholics here

[1:49:39] about you knowing that
[1:49:51] this is what gets me yeah we've got
[1:49:52] schema people

[2:10:26] beginning

[2:12:23] views or whatever they call it so
[2:12:27] i never needed to go get a blood test
[2:12:31] the very image of who they are
[2:12:46] he was able to love the unlovable did he
[2:12:48] take up the mission
[2:12:55] he was kind to people when they were
[2:12:57] mean to him

[2:13:26] but what about stephen um they were
[2:13:29] stoning him
[2:13:31] beating him with rocks y'all better
[2:13:33] understand what i'm talking about

[2:13:38] a persecution of the christians

[2:13:43] it's coming the question you're going to
[2:13:45] be tested
[2:13:46] you're going to be tried you better have
[2:13:50] christ on the inside

[2:14:28] all the things pertaining to life
[2:14:32] according to second peter 1. everything

[2:15:50] know
[2:15:50] all the dudes
[2:15:53] know how to dress up where not to go
[2:15:58] and steal me don't have the holy ghost
[2:16:03] you know why because most people are
[2:16:06] ashamed
[2:16:08] a lot of people are ashamed
[2:16:12] or having the holy ghost is
[2:16:13] old-fashioned
[2:16:26] [Music]
[2:16:31] is have you received the holy ghost
[2:16:34] since you believe
[2:16:38] and there's a certain way that the holy
