that you're here i pray that you will just hide your servant speak to us lord from your word may you get honor and glory anything that would be among us that we might have drug in here with us that would disturb the atmosphere lord we are speaking to it now that it has to be silent if it's something that has to be picked up in a little while so be it but right now it needs to be silent in the name of the lord jesus christ we have come to have fellowship with you we bless you and give you praise for it is in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] amen god bless you saints of god it's sure an honor to be here with you tonight while you're standing if you have your bibles let's read from the book of ephesians chapter 5. i'll turn this other one on does that get it that's that's got us on all right ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and had given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor but fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not be once named among you as become a saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them for you were sometimes darkness but now are you light in the lord walk as children of light for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight before we start preaching just give you a little background of myself as brother isaiah said i'm brother wes greeley my wife's sister joyce i'm so thankful that she is with me i have had a different journey than brother brooks has had and god knows everything that is necessary for our journey and so he puts it in our path what we need to refine us to make us what we are who we are what we need to be and uh my father is a pastor he's now 83 years old still pastors a little church in virginia and he has preached this message this end time message since 1970 i was born in 69 in 1968 my father moved my mother and my well four older sisters at that time uh to from baltimore maryland to union city pennsylvania and my father says that that was his backside of the desert experience and as a grown adult now preaching this end time message i am personally thankful for his backside of the desert experience because god put him in that place separated from a lot of the isms and the doctrines of the message that you hear about and so it kept him separated from that and it made him a more balanced man uh and and even though we attended some meetings of some of the different what i'll call sex or isms of the message daddy would always go back home to his desert and he would he would seek the lord about it and he would find out what he needed for himself his family and for his church and it caused him to be balanced through the years and so again as a preacher i appreciate the balance that he kept through the years uh not a hundred percent because all of us are growing we're maturing but i thank god tonight for uh being raised in a christian home a home that believed this message of truth and and that it was it was not just handed to him from one generation to the next but it was something that he fought for and when you fight for something you're more likely to hold on to it if it's given to you as easy you're more likely to be somebody who would let go of it with ease that's why we see a great falling away because it has been passed from one generation to another and they felt like that it was just kind of a free ride for them but this truth of god is not a free ride it is something that has to be continually fought for we can look in our precious united states of america and we can see as it goes from one generation to another generation you see there was a generation that was willing to fight a foreign war to be able to have freedom in the united states and when they came home they did not want their children to have to fight the same kind of wars that they fought for and so they tried to make life a little bit easier for that next generation and they were they worked hard to be able to give them something that so they wouldn't have to go and fight a war like they did then that generation became a little softer and they gave it to the next generation and now that generation is the one that we see that is about to repeat history because they didn't have to fight for what they got it was handed to them but we as the people of god we can see that the natural types the spiritual and there's a generation that has been handed something they didn't have to fight for it they didn't have to work for it they didn't have to pioneer it the pioneer anything they didn't have to fight the same battles that the previous generation and the previous generation fought for and so now they're a bunch of man be pambi uh children that expect everything to be handed to them and so they're not willing to fight for this message of truth they're not willing to hold on to anything and so we find out that people are falling away but there is a people who are willing to stand in this end time and they're willing to fight for what they got they're willing to stand on truth and say i'm gonna stand if everybody else falls away if everybody else just gets to the side gets to the side i'm gonna stand for the truth and i'm going to let the world go by because when we're handed a truth there is a responsibility that we have to hold on to that truth with everything we've got my father fought for it and i as a child a family of ten i have nine siblings one has already gone on to glory but by the grace of god because of the balance that my father kept all of us attend churches that believe this end time truth some are more steady than others but you know why that some are more steady than others because they've received the baptism of the holy ghost that is the only thing that's going to keep us in the end time that this is another thing that i've noticed through the years because people have not been willing to fight through to the baptism of the holy ghost when i was growing up i heard so many things i i would go to meetings with my dad and my mom and i would i would hear these different things and i would hear preachers talk about all you got to do is believe the word well yes you've got to believe the word that's the first thing you've got to do even to call on the name of the lord our god you have to believe and that is the beginning of our of our salvation experiences to believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him and if we diligently seek him he's willing to keep us and to guide us and to strengthen us but that's not the end of the experience and brother brooks comes from a background where that they they believe that speaking in tongues well my wife comes from a similar background and where that speaking in tongues was the height of all of it and so the the growing up you would hear preachers and they created such an opposite thing to that that it almost seemed as though tongues was not even a part of the christian experience they created such an opposite uh thought about it and growing up i personally i'm giving you my testimony i personally had really come to a place where that i didn't care whether i ever gained that experience of the holy ghost and speaking in tongues and and allowing the spirit of god to work through me that it was something that i had to work through by the spirit of god and growing up as a teenager there's all of these things that reach out and grab a hold of you and they they want to capture your mind and as an adult they want to capture your mind friends when you get to my age or you get to older than than i am brother brooks and this brother i'm pointing them out because i know they're ancient men and that they fight the same kind of battles that i do and because this greatest battle that was ever fought is still being fought in the earth today it is not a battle of flesh and blood although sometimes we make it that way as as part of a church family we tend to create flesh and blood fight but this is not a flesh and blood fight this is a fight of principalities and powers that are above our head and there's a war going on in the heavenlies at all times and they're out to capture the minds and the hearts of anybody that they can capture because they desire to corrupt and to cause us to be stunted in our growth with the lord and it is constantly that a believer has to wrestle those things down and we have to capture our thoughts and wrestle down to the ground all of these things that come against us in such a way that we can't weak with our natural eyes we can't see this battle that's raging but we can we can feel this battle that's raging we can experience it we are experiencing it and we are trying by the grace of god to put the enemy on the run and i tell you what puts the enemy on the run and that's when we do like we did tonight we come in and recreate an atmosphere by lifting up a praise to the lord and saying lord i'm gonna press my way through even if even if i'm having a hard time when i come in sometimes it's a little slow sometimes it feels like it's all that you can do to put one foot in front of the other but oh when we press through to praise the lord and then there's the breakthrough all the breakthrough makes all the struggle worth all the effort that there was to get there as a teenager just fighting all of these battles i went to public school and i dealt with some of the stuff that was going around at that time and i think about some of these children what they face today and how awful it is and and i feel like that my going to school and what i faced was nearly a picnic compared to what they're facing today and and all of the garbage that you can get a hold of right on this thing here how that the enemy is putting it right out there right in the hands of these young people and i think about how that the enemy works on their minds and the things that they hide from their parents and they hide from one another and how that the enemy is constantly moving and i didn't have to fight that same kind of battle when i was a teenager but yet i had the battle that i had to face of whether i was going to try to ride the coattail of my daddy preacher or whether i was going to give my life to the lord jesus christ and i can remember my sister debbie who is the one that the lord chose to take about six years ago five six years ago and she came to me in in one summer and she must have had uh some kind of a understanding maybe she just watched a little closer than some of the rest of them did and she said i think it'd be a good idea for you to go to youth camp in ohio and you know we talk about people getting saved and kneeling down at an altar crying out to god for some that's the way it happened but as i look back on my journey and i watch what the lord did in my life just from her talking to me that particular day asking me to go to a youth camp my life changed from that moment that moment i didn't call on the lord i didn't ask his forgiveness at that moment i did not say lord forgive me of all my sins i didn't do any of that but my life started changing from that moment and i knew that the holy spirit had had done something for me because my desires had changed from that time now the way that the lord works the way he does things he draws us by his holy spirit and he knows because he is omnipotent because he knows the end from the beginning he knows our yeses all along the way he knows because that there would be a future event that would happen he knew that he didn't have to put me on my knees right at that very moment he was changing some things from day to day to get me to a place where i was going to get in an atmosphere at a youth camp that was going to so radically changed my life that i would never be the same and so i went to the youth camp i was 18 years old i had just graduated high school and i went to this youth camp and it so happened to be that somebody else had booked this particular campground that year and uh so the camp had to be moved from one place to another and as this move was taking place uh i had my dad's van and we drove to the next campground and it was very primitive and as the director of the camp everybody had a place to sleep but somehow my name had been overlooked and so amazed at the sovereignty of god and how he works things i told the director i said got the whole back end of this van i can sleep in the back of this van he says oh no i got a place for you i got a place for you to sleep well i not only got one of the best places on the whole campground to sleep i was bunking with the preachers apparently i know apparently about it god saw ahead of time that he was going to call me into the ministry and he was putting me right there in the middle of all those preachers i had a better shower than all the rest of the kids did and and somehow god just saw fit to place me there but although all of that was beautiful there came a night that a birth took place it was a messy birth it was a slobbering snotting birth it was a birth that forever changed my life that forever changed who i am and it forever changed my thoughts about a lot of things and god set me on a course to pursue him with everything that was within me and after that particular night i spent until 4 30 in the morning up under the trailer uh that what they were using as a platform and and this is my testimony yours is probably different than mine but old friend if you've not received the baptism of the holy ghost i challenge you to get before god and if it's in a church building if it's in your bedroom if it's under your bed whatever it takes you get to that place where that you know that you have the baptism of the holy ghost the same god that raised up jesus from the dead the same spirit if that same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body and it will raise you up into new heights of the holy spirit yes it will eventually take us on out of here but that spirit of god is given to us to quicken the inside of us to raise us up above the place where we are currently because we can get in a stuck position and when we get in a stuck position the enemy wants to hold us there and he wants us to think that everybody forgot about us even god he wants us to think that nobody cares about us and that we're not really qualified to be called a child of god no none of us are qualified to be called children of god there's nothing in us that qualifies us to be children of god but yet he called us just the same why why did he call me why did he call me why did he call you because he saw something in you that he knew that he could trust you say well i don't feel very trustworthy right this moment what's that got to do with it what do feelings have to do with it because god did not call us to go by our feelings you see back in the 50s and the 60s when brother branham was on the on the earth and he was he was trying to present to the people this thought that they did not have to remain in their sickness a lot of his ministry concerned the physical healing of the human body and this physical healing of the human body as he was preaching uh he was trying to get the people to look beyond how they felt so many times he would tell people you're healed and then they would respond but i don't feel healed and he would say that doesn't matter confess that you are healed by the confession of your mouth he said if you confess with your mouth then your body is going to respond to your confession and then your body will respond to that confession and there will come healing in your physical body and that was the outward man but really he was pointing forward to something that was much greater than the physical healing because he even said you're gonna die if you're healed tonight somewhere if you have 10 more 20 or 30 more years and you have health for those 30 years you're probably going to get sick again and you're going to die it is a part of the cycle of life now we know by the grace of god that there is going to come a a rapture of the church and it's going to pull us up out of here but he was giving us this instruction because he wanted us to understand that we were fighting a battle in our mind that would affect the inner man and it would cause us to to even question whether we were a child of god or not we would question whether we were born again or not and he said he kept saying what the feelings have to do with it that's why he kept preaching to us that we could not base our experience on feelings and so that's what i grew up understanding you can't base your experience on feelings and because that you know as a child i thought as a child and i spoke as a child and i did childish things but as i grew up i begin to realize no i cannot base my experience on feelings but that doesn't negate the feelings that i have when i'm in the presence of the lord amen and as i went on my journey and i realized that i come up with a really really nasty attitude about speaking in tongues and god really had to deal with me hard he had to deal with me hard and and so it went through a period of several years again my precious wife came out of a pentecostal holiness church and and knew nothing of brother branham or the message or anything like that and and so that was all new to her and for many years uh it was a growing process and and quite frankly we're still growing together in the grace and the knowledge of the lord jesus christ and as we were talking today at the table and we were talking about things that we don't really understand but we just lay them aside for now because god gives progressive revelation and and he helps us to understand along the way uh things that we may not have understood in the past and he has to deal with us as sons every son that cometh to god has to be chastened has to be reproved has to have some things uh cut off of them and and so that's what god does with us that's what he was doing with me and i know that's what he does with you but don't lose hope amen don't lose faith when you feel the chastening of the lord that is really the time that we ought to throw up our hands and say thank you lord that you love me amen but that's the time that the enemy wants to beat us the hardest and tell us how unworthy we are and how worthless we are and or what failures we are but what we ought to do is is every once in a while just just tell him to shut his face just be quiet i was i was you know those things that roar around in our head and i was by myself on a job the other day and and he was just tormenting my mind the enemy was and finally i said devil just shut up amen just be quiet amen you're a liar just shut up and i started singing the praises of god and about an hour later i was back fighting him again and i had to tell him again devil just shut up i don't have to be polite to him he's not polite to me and i'm the blood-bought child of god amen and sometimes i just need to know that he's put in his place be quiet you have no voice in my life i will not allow you to have a voice in my life pardon me so you have to shut him down so we can't go by our feelings but yet we're a human being we all have feelings we all have things that we're dealing with and when we're feeling these things we everybody else is kind of shut out of our of our lives and what battle they're going through is irrelevant at the time because we're fighting our own battle and we have to just put the enemy in his place and it's not always easy to get to that place but by the grace of god it is doable amen and praise works the best against the devil amen amen declaring the word of god you see when jesus after jesus was baptized this is not preaching from ephesians 5 but let's go with it when jesus was baptized by john in the river jordan there was a voice that came from heaven that said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and immediately jesus was driven into the wilderness well that was jesus well we start out our journey and we ask the lord to come into our lives and we are led on into a place where that we recognize that it is important for us to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we want to obey the lord so we go into water and we're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ taking on the name of the lord upon our lives and it's like immediately we're driven into the wilderness immediately we're driven into the wilderness and it feels like that we are starving for more of god amen we had such a beautiful experience when we knelt down and we called on the lord and perhaps you were immediately filled with the holy ghost i don't know your experience i'm telling you mine but when i knelt at that altar that night really i was laying on the ground and i knew that something had took took place had taken place but then there's this journey that we all are faced with where that it feels like that everything is a wilderness and we have to go back to our home see that was a camp meeting and we had to go back to our homes and to our home church and none of the fellowship of the believers was right around us the way it was at that camp where it was singing and worshiping every day and preaching every night and every morning and there was just a lovely atmosphere among the people and we went home we had to go back to the daily grind of life yes we were going to go to church on sunday and we were going to go to church on wednesday but we had to go to our jobs and we had to go maybe back to school or we had to face the things of life that were uh oppressive to us they were things that were just our natural everyday life and we didn't get the same infusion of the holy spirit on that daily basis that we were getting when we were at the camp meeting amen and so the devil used that as a wilderness and he tried to break me down he tries to break you down but god makes a way for us to have a filling of his spirit amen where that it doesn't have to be a one-time experience oh how we get things all misconstrued and we think that the baptism of the holy ghost is a one-time thing well the initial filling of the holy ghost that gets us started on the journey but things tend to leak out we're human amen we deal with the devil on a daily basis we deal with humanity on a daily basis we are we're fighting spirits that we can't see things that are hanging for you all over this region that maybe we don't fight down in alabama but you're fighting a different region of warfare then we're fighting down there pardon me we're fighting different battles but god put us in the region that he wanted us to be in just the same as he put you in a family that he knew would build you into the nature and the character that you needed for the spirits that hang over the region that you were called to you would be able to fight those battles you may say preacher i don't feel qualified to fight the battles that i am fighting well let me tell you you are qualified amen the holy spirit qualified you when he called you and it was something that we did not understand when we first called on the name of the lord it was something that we struggle with through time and and even into our adult years we don't really understand this warfare that we battle with from day to day so the spirit of god comes into our life and he comes with the measure that is needed for the moment you don't have currently everything that you are going to need amen but you sitting here tonight testifies of the thought of the fact that god has brought you through every trial you've ever been through amen you may say well i'm in the middle of one right now but we can still testify right this moment that every trial that god has put you through he has brought you all the way through it amen and so if you're in one right now he is going to bring you through that one too because he gave you of his holy spirit so that you could go through that trial amen it's not always easy it's not always pleasant we don't want to cuss in the pulpit but sometimes we just go through hell we go through things that feel like that we have gone to the depths of hell and back but david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil now this valley of the shadow of death is not death itself and we know that many times we become scared by shadows anybody ever been jumpy when i was a child i was a scaredy cat i mean i was scared of everything go to a new house is that my sister's house last week never slept down there in that bedroom in the basement just different noises and you wonder is somebody breaking into the house what's going on so these things are still there to mess with our minds but shadows when when when the darkness begins to set in and in their shadows and then when darkness fully sets in and there's a little bit of light that shines and it creates a shadow and we can't see what's in that shadow and our mind makes up all kinds of imaginations of what's in that shadow or what's lurking behind that shadow and our imagination goes wild and this is exactly what the enemy tries to do with us when god takes us through a trial there is the valley of the shadow of death and there are shadows everywhere and the enemy wants our imagination to go so wild that we start making up stories in our mind of what we're about to face when all it is is a shadow amen just a shadow there's nothing there but the enemy uses it to try to make our minds go crazy and not concentrate on the word of god and this shadow keeps us all in a stir but it's nothing but a shadow but somewhere there's light amen somewhere there's light that's causing a shadow now you could make this room just as dark as you possibly could and that little exit sign back there with that little 5 watt bulb in it that's all that's in that exit light is 5 watt bulb it's like the ones at our church that sign would be enough if this room was pitched into blackness that exit sign would be enough to cast some light so that we could find our way to get out that door but because that that light is so small it would begin to create shadows all over this room and the further that you would get from that light the less light there would be but it would still create shadows and that is exactly how the enemy works with our imagination to cause us to fear but fear not little bride there is a man in here that can turn on the light and by the baptism of the holy ghost by the infilling of the holy ghost there is a light that comes in the believer that starts dispelling the shadows that are around us amen now my experience went on and continues on but i want to give you the rest of the story because i fought my way to get what i've got and friends if you haven't fought your way to get what you've got i would encourage you to be on guard because the enemy is going to try to steal what you got even for a seasoned believer the enemy wants to try to steal what you have amen so you've got to be on guard at all times i didn't understand concerning the when the people in the upper room received the holy ghost and cloven tongues of fire set down upon them and they staggered like drunk men i've had that experience to stagger like a drunk man with the power of the holy ghost and when they went out into the streets they were speaking in another language they began to speak in different tongues and they were able to communicate with some of the people that were there from other nations that didn't understand their language they spoke with other tongues and i believe that it is a gifting of the holy spirit that goes along it's a part of the gift of the holy ghost that is given to the end time body of christ it is not the initial evidence of the holy ghost it is not the finish hall of the holy ghost but it is a part of the holy ghost it is a part of the gifting of god that he gave to his people on the day of pentecost and god is still pouring it out on the believer in the end time amen if you've never experienced it i encourage you to ask the lord if he will bless you with that amen but i fought against it for many years ignorantly fought against it stupidly fought against it not realizing how much that it was a benefit to a believer amen but one day i was praying and i started hearing another language in my mind in my spirit however you want to say it i could hear it i could hear it i could hear it i could hear it and i didn't know what to do about it because i did not want to presume anything but i could hear it and so i went to brother shelley i knew that he was a tongue talker i knew that that's the way that the lord birthed him amen i knew that's why what from the age of seven years old that's how that he had he came in and and god blessed him that way so i went to him and i said what should i do about that i can hear these things in my mind i can what should i do about it he says well in your private time when you're alone he says just speak out what you're hearing i said okay that's exactly what i'll do so i began in my private prayer time this went on for about two weeks in my private prayer time i just began to speak out what i was hearing just i didn't know what i was saying i just was trying to feel my way through because i wanted that experience i knew i had the holy ghost i knew that i had been called to preach the gospel at i think i was about 21 years old when i preached the first time 52 years old now i started preaching and i knew that i had the holy ghost but i wanted more of god i wanted all that god had for me i didn't want to stop you know these people they they get to speaking in tongues part and they think that's the all of it oh friends they're so much more than that and then you have preachers that you know you get somebody that speaks in tongues and then they throw out this quote why settle for that when the pentecostal skies are full of the real and you see i had this this mindset it was a false mindset it was one that i created maybe those preachers didn't have that particular thought in mind when they were saying it i don't know i can't judge their motives i can't judge their character but i can tell you what i felt in my own self that they were saying why bother with that it's all the word the word the word well friends a part of the word is that on the day of pentecost there was a rushing mighty wind and there was cloven tongues that came down upon them and they staggered like drunk men and they went out into the streets and brother branham said that they did that they were so full of god that they didn't they weren't able to speak in their own native tongue that god had to give them a new heavenly tongue they went out into the streets and began to speak in other tongues that's the word you look through the book of acts how many times when they received the baptism of the holy ghost that they spoke in other tongues they spoke in another language and so i began to recognize this is something for me amen it is not what god gave me to let me know that i had the holy ghost but it is something that god came to me and i was feeling my way through it because i wasn't satisfied just to hear it in my head amen i wanted the experience in full so for about two weeks for about two weeks i would in my private prayer time i would just start hearing that and i would just start trying to express it with my voice about two weeks later on a sunday night power of god came down in new hope revival center in columbus georgia brother shelley laid his hands on me and that push of the holy ghost came down in such a magnitude and i went from one side of the building to the other side of the building and that speaking in tongues that power of the holy ghost was coming out of me and brother shelley said get full of it let it just fill you up let it fill you up and he said just get all splash around in it a while he said because you don't want the devil to be able to steal it from you tomorrow that's good well i just listened to his advice and i was a wild man that night and the devil ain't been able to steal it from me from 1998 till now the holy ghost came in such a wave and what i found out friends see we're not going to major on a minor so to speak but speaking in tongues was a part of what they received on the day of pentecost and there have been many who have tried to say it wasn't necessary in our day but friends if you ever experience it and and you realize that it's not just a gift for you to be able to tout or pat yourself on the shoulder or something and say i've spoken in tongues no it is a gifting of god that he places inside of a believer because he wants to use it as a tool to defeat the devil in your life and you may say how is it that that it's going to defeat the devil in your life well you see not all tongues has to have an interpretation there is a gift of tongues that operates in the church that is a gift that has to have an interpretation otherwise it's not edifying anybody it's not going to help anybody but there is a gift of the holy ghost that he gives to the believer that we we speak in a language that he is making intercession on our behalf amen amen perhaps you are going through a trial and perhaps that trial is of such a nature that you don't feel like that you can tell anybody about what you're going through and perhaps you would go to somebody that god has given that gift to and you would say pray for me and that's all you would say now amen i can look at you over the past couple of weeks and realize that you've been going through a deep dark trial and i can make some observations and i can make some assumptions and i can have some thoughts in my mind of what kind of a valley that you're going through and i can pray in my own native tongue and i can and i can tell the lord what i think that you might need or what might serve you better is for me to get in the spirit amen and let the holy ghost intercede through me amen and let him do the interceding on your behalf because the holy ghost knows a whole lot more about what you're going through than i do and if i can let him pray through me and he can express that then that intercession is going to do so much more for you than if i pray my natural thoughts of what i've observed of what i've thought of what i think that you're going through all of that could be good could be right but if the holy ghost intercedes amen if he does the interceding then i believe that the need can be met so much more abundantly amen than if now again this is not to major on this gifting it is just a part of the things the the the gifts of the holy ghost that he places in our life to be able to guide us through this maze of life that we have been uh given here on the earth again every one of us has a different maze that we're going through our lives have intersected now and and they've intersected in such a way that god must have saw that there was something in me that he wanted to intersect with your life and your life with me because he is offently joining the body of christ together in such a way now the battles that you face the upbringing that you had the the the the family unit that you had or didn't have all of that stuff that constructed your life up till now and what constructed my life up till now this is now a junction of time this is a junction of time that god has chosen to intersect our lives for whatever purposes only eternity will tell but there must be something that god wants to do among us at this junction of time that he would bring us together on this saturday night when it is cold outside and nobody really wants to go outside because it is cold but yet here we are gathered together in the presence of the lord amen because he has something that he wants to put inside of us he has something that he wants to birth in us and it may not always look like what we think it would look like it's true amen light is an interesting thing jesus said you are the light of the world matthew chapter 5. john i believe chapter 8 he said while i am in the world i am the light of the world that was john's record of what jesus said jesus said while i am in this world i am the light of the world but then he had a record in the book of matthew you are the light of the world and he instructed us that we because of him we can carry light we have the ability to carry life we are not creatures of darkness men have loved darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil we see darkness settling in on the earth in such a way that we begin to wonder how soon will be the coming of the lord how soon will the lord come can the earth take much more darkness we see evil pressing in on every side amen every way we see sodom conditions but yet i have said this before [Music] we say that we live in a sodom condition and yes we see that the spirit of sodom is gaining ground in the earth but i would remind you that when the angels went to sodom when the angels met abraham and those two angels went to sodom that the spirit was so prevalent in sodom that they were busting the doors down to get to the angels and we've not yet seen them busting the doors down that spirit is most likely going to get stronger amen yes sir the transgender idea it's going to get stronger the the the the gay and lesbian agenda it is going to get stronger it's they're going to try to infiltrate every part of our life but it is the responsibility of the believer to carry the light amen men have loved darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil but a a city that is set on a hill cannot be heard that's right amen and god did not put his light in you for you to go hide in the shadow god did not put his light in you for you to run away and say oh lord why don't you just take the bride out of here no now this has been our attitude friends amen god why don't you just rapture us out of here we're not ready oh we're ready but we're not ready everything that has been prophesied to us must be fulfilled amen and that includes the bride of jesus christ coming to her maturity amen and as long as the bride is fighting with one another and we're wrestling flesh and blood and we're we're hiding our sin in the darkness and in the shadows as long as all of that is going on there cannot be a rapture of the bride of jesus christ amen but there is coming something it is pressing in on us even as we speak it is pressing in on us and it is going to squeeze us into our maturity amen when jesus after after he was baptized and he went into the wilderness he went through a time where that he fought the devil he fought the devil he fought the devil and he overcame him every time by the word amen amen amen amen amen i wonder when jesus was fighting the enemy i wonder if he felt anything when he spoke the word to the devil i wonder if he felt elated by speaking the word he was in a human body amen he was in all manner amen tempted yes sir as we amen now you watch when when he was driven into the wilderness he was fasting and he was hungry what was the first thing the devil did he hit him in the flesh if you're who you say you are why don't you turn these stones into bread but i'm just going to let you know when jesus got through telling the devil man cannot live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god he was probably still just as hungry as he was before he said that amen amen amen did he feel any different i don't know but the word was put on the enemy amen amen but the enemy hit him first in the flesh then as he works on us he worked on jesus there in the wilderness all right he was hungry anybody ever fast done some fasting my life and i would dare say that brother brooks has probably done something much more stringent than i have ever done i have fasted for a 21 day period but i was drinking a protein shake every day because i was in the face of message preachers who was reminding me that said brother branham said three days was enough i understood that i felt the call to do 21 days i was not abusing my body my teeth were not falling out of my head i was getting some nutrition but i felt the call to do the 21 days but as you go into these days and you are getting hungry even though i was drinking a shake i was still hungry and then you get on over into seven 10 days where you haven't chewed anything for 10 days and the devil starts playing with your mind and so that's what he was doing with jesus and so he takes him up to this high pinnacle of the of the temple and he says why don't you just commit suicide that's right why don't you just jump off the word says the the word says that he'll give his angels charge over you lest you dash your foot against the stone but he wanted jesus to kill himself because he didn't want him on the earth anymore but you see you are a part of the lord jesus christ amen and the enemy wants to kill you he wants to thwart your journey he wants to stop you from what god has called you to amen and he will mess with your mind and he will drive you to the same place that he did jesus where that you might take pills where you might jump off of a building you might jump off of a bridge you may take a gun and shoot yourself in the head he doesn't care how you do it he just wants you to take your own life and wreck your destiny put the word on him devil the holy spirit is here to keep me all the way through every one of these trials amen amen every one of them amen did jesus feel any differently after he had that battle i don't know was he still hungry i suspect he was he was still fasting he was still in the wilderness he was still in the journey he was in the trial he was in the heat of the battle the devil was coming to him because he was in a human flesh and he was fighting these same temptations and things that we face on a daily basis and jesus was going through the same thing so now the devil has to come up with a different tactic i didn't it didn't work for me to get him to quit so let me try something else leads him up to a high place says all of these kingdoms i'll give to you if you'll just bow down and worship me what was he working on now pride pride if you're not going to get out of my way let me see if i can't build you up in pride you see the devil tried once upon a time to usurp authority in heavenly places now i just want you to think about the power and the authority that the devil had when he was in the heavenly place and he was really he was right hand man to god he was one of those powerful angels with gabriel and michael he was music director we'll say there was something about him but he was lifted up in pride and in isaiah 14 you can read about all of the things that he tried to do to build himself up build himself up build himself up till finally he wanted to be above our creator and he created a rebellion in such a way that god finally said enough is enough and put him out when jesus was tempted in the wilderness the devil again was trying to find a way to gain authority to gain some access to uh use humanity for his purposes just as he did in the garden he was trying to use humanity for his purposes and so he's trying to get jesus lifted up in pride all of this is to be a shadow and a type for us to understand that the enemy is going to come to us in the same kind of ways he's going to come at our flesh he's going to come at our soul he's going to come in our spirit he's going to do all kinds of things to try to get us all out of sorts with life to and and if if he can't get you to live in the valley of the shadow of death he's going to try to get you lifted up in pride to try to let you be somebody that is always i'm somebody if he can't get you to be a nobody he'll try to make you think you're somebody and the fact is i'm somebody and nobody all at the same time but i'm not going to let him put a name on who i am amen and you can't let him put a name on who you are you have got to allow the holy spirit day by day by day to work on you and and and by his holy spirit work in you and become the light that he has called you to be he has called you to be a bearer of the light and he called you to be a bearer of the light because he knew that there would be plenty of darkness in the world and he came he's he came into your life for you to keep a little bit of light in this earth amen now the bible is coming to a close this did not go the way i thought it was praise god but the bible tells us in luke let's turn there and read it luke chapter 11. verse 33 no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body is also full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the hole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give the light back to 35 take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkened or darkness or shadowed or obscure god chose to put his light in you so that it could shine amen this little light of mine i'm going to let it shine but there are always things in that the enemy comes at you with to try to put out your light i would like to report to you tonight that the enemy cannot put out your life he cannot but he will come at you with trials he will come at you with temptations he will come at you with family scuffles he will come at you with church scuffles he will come at you with job scuffles he will come after you with mind battles of all sorts because it is his desire to obscure your light now the light is still there is it not but it has become obscured it has become lessened because we have allowed the enemy to come and use something or someone to put a bushel over our light to do something to obscure our light now we read in ezekiel and we also read in the book of revelation that there is a aura a light around the throne and there is a perfect light in the presence of god remember when when the the humans were put in the garden of eden they were clothed with the light of god they had clothing the glory of god but when they tasted of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there they lost their covering their light became obscured we'll say they no longer had see but god wanted once us by the baptism of the holy ghost he wants our light to shine brightly before man that they may see our good works and glorify god which is in heaven but we allow all kinds of things to obscure our light and to steal the glory of god out of our lives but he calls us back to the baptism of the holy ghost back to a refilling of the holy spirit and if i could encourage you in anything tonight that would be my encouragement to you if you've never received the baptism of the holy ghost i would encourage you to lay before the lord and perhaps you have responsibilities that that may cause you to have to get up i don't know but just stay before the lord and you constantly ask him lord i want you to fill me so full of the holy spirit till that i never again doubt amen that i have the holy ghost friends i've had a lot of battles in my life i've faced the devil many a times but the devil has never been able to talk me out of the baptism of the holy ghost he's never been able to make me doubt that the lord gave me the infilling of the spirit does it mean that i've not fought the devil i have does it mean i've not gone through discouraging times in my life where i wanted to just throw up my hands and say i quit of course there have been but there was still something on the inside of me that i knew that i knew that i knew that i knew no matter how much discouragement even even if i did something that displeased the lord you know how the enemy does he comes and says you don't have the holy ghost why you're not even saved shut up devil shut up i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he's able to keep me all the way to the day of his appearing he that began that good work in me is the same one that's going to perform it all the way to the day of jesus christ amen amen the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away they can't they don't have the ability to take it away the devil doesn't have the ability to take it away from me does that mean that i've never kind of released it into his hands there have been those times but by the grace of god i stand before you tonight and give you the testimony that i have yanked it back i have yanked it back time and again and i said oh no you know he can only go so far he can only go so far and i've yanked it back and said oh no you don't oh no you don't i know the experience that i had with the lord jesus christ and i know that he is able to keep me to the day of jesus christ he is able to sustain me as things press in and get harder and harder and harder he'll give me more grace and more grace and we're going to have to keep coming back to the lord jesus christ musicians come please oh i keep coming back to the well of grace great is its power sweet is the taste whenever temptations and trials i face i keep coming back to the well oh i keep [Music] [Music] i keep coming back [Music] it is [Music] no better place [Music] [Music] calvary [Music] victory [Music] [Music] i keep coming back [Music] [Music] oh thank you lord [Music] there is a river that flows from deep within [Music] there is a fountain [Music] oh this water there is [Music] is [Music] from [Music] [Music] their hearts [Music] [Music] there is [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is a fountain that freezes [Music] [Music] there is [Music] while they continue to play would you bow your heads [Music] my lord knows just what you need tonight he knows right where you're at he knows the battle that you fought just before you got here tonight [Music] he knows the one you fought earlier in the day one that you fought yesterday my lord knows your condition tonight and he's right here right now you can reach out and touch him [Music] and there's such grace and mercy in him that he can reach farther down than you can reach up if you don't feel like that you have the ability even to reach up i want you to just say in your heart lord you know the need that i have but if you can just lift your hand up toward him say lord i have a need tonight and i know that you're capable you're well capable of handling that need i fought some discouragement i've wondered why i even go to church but old friend he knows tonight he knows the seeds that he planted inside of you and he's not going to leave you forsaken he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll go with you all the way to the end but you just reach up to him tonight lord you see every person that is under the sound of my voice and you know you know their latitude and their longitude you know their place on this earth tonight you're not off on the other side of the earth taking care of somebody else and forgetting about us right here god you're faithful and you're with us right now i ask your father that you would just descend into these lives things that they've been crying out to you for lord i'm asking you that you would just bring fulfillment to them this night lord i'm so thankful that their satisfaction in the living god satisfaction in my jesus i ask you lord that you'll touch lives right here right now god the seeds of discouragement that have been in some i'm asking you right now that you would drive that thing far far from their lives and that there would come such a boost of the holy spirit that that feeling of quitting would dissipate in the name of jesus christ satan i take authority over you in the name of jesus christ i do not have the power to do anything but i am calling the plans of god out of heaven into this earthly realm and i am saying lord thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in earthen vessels as it is in heaven lord you have a plan and you have a purpose and may be carried out in the lives of these people tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ i give you praise lord i give you praise i give you praise wonderful wonderful wonderful is your name [Music] thank you jesus [Music] is a river that flows these let the holy spirit [Music] this water there is [Music] just reach out and touch the lord you'll find he's not too busy to hear you hearts cry he's passing by this moment all your needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he goes by oh reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear is out and touch the lord once again as brother brooks comes reach out and touch as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your [Music] is [Music] as he [Music] is [Music] [Applause] reach out and just truly the lord is blessed i trust everybody tonight i'll receive something from the lord one thing for certain by just listening to the message god's provided a place of worship for this day in 1964 the prophet god tells us that you cry out until you get what you want he said that's god provided way for this day i don't care what the teachers have told you god has told us this is how you get what you need it may come in a various way but when you do get what you need you'll come up in peace like the brother said you come up in a way that satan can never take it from it so i i just thank god because i know that throughout all the trials i've ever gone through there's always a place satan can't touch and i thank god for the experience of the holy spirit i'm kind of greedy i want more i i won't stop i want baptism after baptism at the baptism at the baptism until i see the perfection of god living in me and for a person who don't want it i don't know what to say but for those of us who want it [Music] we're like jacob if we got a wrestle all night with the angels we're going to get our blessings i was blessed tonight we thank you brother [Music] i like when god shifts sermons that's when you really get my attention for sure because i know somebody's being fed somebody's being touched and somebody is getting an understanding of things they never had understanding of and i appreciate the brother because in the message so many people are afraid to talk on these subjects on this subject in particular because they're afraid of it many of them don't understand it and most of them don't know what they're talking about and so they stay away from it and they give you a different uh idea of the way it should be but i look at the way animals have babies cows dogs even humans brother adam said every birth is a mess there's no way of getting around it people you can't be educated into it
