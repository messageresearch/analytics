[51:29] diligence add to your faith virtue
[51:30] virtue knowledge knowledge temperance
[51:32] temperance patience patience godliness
[51:34] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[51:36] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[51:39] things be in you and abound they make
[51:41] you that you shall neither be barren nor
[51:44] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[51:46] Jesus Christ amen but he that lacketh
[51:49] these things is blind and cannot see
[51:52] afar off and hath forgotten that he was
[51:55] purged from his old sins wherefore the
[51:57] rather brethren give diligence to make
[51:59] your calling and election Shore for if
[52:02] you do these things ye shall never fall
[52:07] what a promise of God let's turn to
[52:10] Genesis Genesis chapter 28 a man Jacob's
[52:15] Ladder he was climbing one ladder were
[52:18] climbing maybe a different understanding
[52:21] of it same ladder but just a different
[52:23] look of it
[52:24] Genesis 28 on the sub pick up verse 12
[52:30] and he dreamed and behold a ladder set
[52:33] upon the earth the top of it reached to
[52:35] heaven will the angels of God ascending
[52:37] and descending on it and behold the Lord
[52:41] stood above it above it and said I am
[52:45] the Lord God of Abraham my father and
[52:47] the god of Isaac the land were in the
[52:50] alliance to thee will I give it and to I
[52:53] seed
[52:54] amen verse 17 actually verse 16 let's
[52:59] just pick that part Jacob awakened out
[53:02] of his sleep and he said surely the Lord
[53:04] is in this place and I knew it not he
[53:05] was afraid he said how dreadful is this
[53:08] place this is none other but the house
[53:12] of God and this is the gate of heaven
[53:16] the gate of heaven the house of God and
[53:19] the gate of heaven let's ask the Lord to
[53:22] bless the word can we father thank you
[53:24] for the message now thank you for the
[53:26] Bible thank you for truth bless it now
[53:28] as we receive in Jesus name
[53:30] a man st. said a man you may be seated
[53:33] may the Lord bless you real good now we
[53:37] want to look at this you know
[53:38] in a light of understanding what we know
[53:42] about the statue of a perfect man
[53:43] knowing that this particular portion of
[53:47] Scripture that we read is probably one
[53:49] of the most important things that we
[53:51] know of in the entire message it's even
[53:55] more important than seals thunders and
[53:57] all these great mysteries of God because
[53:59] without this character
[54:01] none of the opening of the word can
[54:03] really benefit a person they can have
[54:05] all of the mysteries of God yet missed
[54:08] this and they're sounding brass and a
[54:10] tinkling cymbal so these things are very
[54:12] important for us as the children of God
[54:14] and we realize that each stair step or
[54:18] each ladder rung as we're kind of
[54:20] bringing a comparison between these two
[54:22] will be a progressive move in the life
[54:27] of a child of God they'll grow from
[54:29] faith the virtue to knowledge and so on
[54:31] and so forth until they come to the
[54:33] place of their adoption or the
[54:35] positioning of a child of God where that
[54:38] their name is just as good on the
[54:40] checkbook as daddy's is so God is
[54:42] looking for somebody that has the
[54:44] character has the ability to be able to
[54:47] take upon themselves all of God's divine
[54:50] characteristics now something that we
[54:53] want to look at as we study this this
[54:55] morning is that first of all I want you
[54:57] to if you're writing things down or you
[54:59] like to keep notes I want you to study
[55:01] this remark and remember that this is
[55:03] God's divine nature this is not the
[55:06] nature of man this is not the nature of
[55:08] a bishop or a priest or a prophet or
[55:10] teacher or past or anybody else this is
[55:13] the nature of the Holy Ghost himself and
[55:15] to try to add these characteristics
[55:18] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:20] the Prophet said is like a black bird
[55:22] trying to put peacock feathers in
[55:24] himself he says not nature given it's
[55:27] not nature born and so therefore he's
[55:29] just taking a peacock feather and
[55:31] sticking it in there hoping that he can
[55:32] fool somebody but to the elect of God
[55:34] she will not be just putting peacock
[55:37] feathers in not just a feather of
[55:39] temperance and a feather brotherly
[55:40] kindness but she is going to produce
[55:42] this by the nature of Christ God's very
[55:45] nature is going to live out of her now
[55:48] what I love about this particular
[55:49] scripture is the way that Peter starts
[55:51] this
[55:52] this is one of my favorite parts of the
[55:54] entire Bible because I love how he
[55:55] starts that Simon Peter serve apostle
[55:58] Jesus Christ notice his name to them
[56:01] that have obtained like precious faith
[56:04] hey man I like that cuz see that could
[56:07] be all of us amen don't have to be any
[56:09] certain age or any certain generation
[56:10] but all of us have obtained like
[56:13] precious faith if we are in the
[56:15] righteousness of God and in our Savior
[56:17] Jesus Christ
[56:18] those on the outside they don't even
[56:20] know what we're talking about but to
[56:21] those that have obtained like precious
[56:24] faith and then he tells us that God
[56:26] wants to multiply grace and peace
[56:29] through the knowledge of God and through
[56:32] Jesus Christ so this is a a message of
[56:35] multiplication this is a message of
[56:37] growth this is a add to your and add to
[56:40] this and add to that so God wants us to
[56:44] be able to add to our Christian
[56:46] character
[56:47] all of those elements that will make us
[56:49] like Jesus how many wants to be like
[56:51] Jesus is 1 raise your hand well this is
[56:53] what's gonna make us like that without
[56:55] this divine character in our life then
[56:57] we are just people called by the name of
[56:59] Christian but we're really not a
[57:01] Christian just in the way of action and
[57:04] behavior and all that just yet because
[57:06] Christ for Christian is to be
[57:08] christ-like or to be just like him which
[57:10] means my faith is like him my knowledge
[57:13] is like him my patience is like him
[57:15] my brotherly love is like him amen all
[57:18] of that is like him so if I'm not like
[57:20] him then I'm not really a Christian I'm
[57:23] just a churchgoer we got too many of
[57:25] those around the ranks of this message
[57:27] we don't need to be just churchgoers we
[57:29] want to be Christians full of the Holy
[57:30] Ghost and then somebody said well I'm a
[57:32] message believer I said wonderful I'm a
[57:34] Christian some I said how about a
[57:36] message church I said wonderful I'm in
[57:38] the body of Christ there's a big
[57:40] difference between being in a church
[57:42] amen and then being a Christian
[57:43] altogether being in a church doesn't
[57:45] make you any more of a Christian than
[57:47] standing in a garage makes you a car
[57:48] come on zymotic a man to be a Christian
[57:51] means you must be in Christ are you with
[57:53] me Amen now watch this now I just love
[57:55] this Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 now as
[57:59] we study this morning let's just add a
[58:00] few things here to the text and and and
[58:03] add to our face and virtue and knowledge
[58:05] and
[58:05] temperance or what more now remember
[58:08] that Christ is looking for the same
[58:11] spirit Romans 8:11 if the same spirit
[58:14] that was in Jesus Christ be in you it
[58:17] shall also quicken your mortal body so
[58:19] he's looking for the same in Minnesota
[58:22] some time ago I never will forget but
[58:23] the Brooks preaching a message about
[58:25] Jesus being the same and I've used this
[58:27] example all over the world I guess about
[58:30] the same and it's true when we were
[58:32] children I would play a little matching
[58:33] game you know the cards you turn them
[58:35] over on the table and you'd have to turn
[58:37] them over and match them up you didn't
[58:39] want the old mate if you got her you
[58:40] lost the game but as you turn them over
[58:42] you had to match and you can't match
[58:44] them one to the other to the other and
[58:46] they had to be the same or else you
[58:48] couldn't continue on so then of course
[58:50] as we look at the Christian life in this
[58:53] age Jesus is like turning those cards
[58:56] over and he's looking for the same
[58:57] character can I say the way brother
[58:59] branham said it he's looking for
[59:01] something to dub tail together he's
[59:03] looking for a life to dovetail together
[59:05] that my life in your life will vulcanize
[59:08] with his life a man that it will be the
[59:10] same the exact same character the same
[59:12] life now watch this Matthew chapter 5
[59:14] verse 48 now what I think is beautiful
[59:18] about this scripture is that sometimes
[59:21] people misinterpret this part of the
[59:22] Bible so quickly and when they read this
[59:25] word PE RF EC T it scares them to death
[59:29] sometimes because in their mind and
[59:31] listen I'm the same as you are I know my
[59:33] life I know what kind of man I am I know
[59:35] what kind of mistakes I make I know what
[59:37] kind of weaknesses I have I know my
[59:39] tendencies to do things right tendencies
[59:41] do things wrong and when I read that
[59:43] little word PE RF EC T it scares me to
[59:45] death until you get an understanding of
[59:48] what the word really means now Jesus
[59:50] here saying be you therefore perfect
[59:52] even as your father which is in heaven
[59:55] is perfect now you say now brother being
[59:57] how in the world is the bride ever going
[1:00:00] to achieve perfection well I'm glad you
[1:00:02] asked me I'm gonna tell you this morning
[1:00:04] by the help of the Lord amen now one
[1:00:06] thing I want you to notice if you got a
[1:00:08] Scofield Bible this morning there's a
[1:00:10] reference that he uses there that he
[1:00:12] references a Greek word and as he
[1:00:15] references this Greek word it is the
[1:00:17] Greek word Telos which
[1:00:19] defines what the word perfect means I
[1:00:21] want you to listen at what this word
[1:00:23] says and just tell me if we this we can
[1:00:25] achieve this by the grace of God now it
[1:00:27] let me just say it this way if I say it
[1:00:30] this way first if I read it the way we
[1:00:31] think it it means never make a mistake
[1:00:33] never do nothing wrong never have a bad
[1:00:35] thought never have a wrong idea never do
[1:00:38] anything to slip-up or a backslide or
[1:00:41] get discouraged that's our definition of
[1:00:43] perfect the words a man in case you
[1:00:46] didn't know I just looking to see if you
[1:00:47] come on with me a little bit all right
[1:00:48] now that's our definition of perfect can
[1:00:51] you say ma'am that's our definition but
[1:00:53] here's the Bible definition of being
[1:00:56] perfect which means to be a full age to
[1:01:01] bring it to its end to finish the work
[1:01:04] to complete something not wanting
[1:01:07] anything necessary to its completeness
[1:01:10] to be an adult to be mature now which
[1:01:14] definition you think is more achievable
[1:01:17] the first one I gave which is usually
[1:01:20] our definition we can't hardly achieve
[1:01:21] that for love the money as I guarantee
[1:01:24] the very moment everybody looking for a
[1:01:25] perfect church well at the moment you
[1:01:27] show up we've done ruined it ain't no
[1:01:28] perfect Church a man a perfect assembly
[1:01:31] when I come preached that I've done
[1:01:32] ruined it because I ain't perfect myself
[1:01:33] hey man there's no such thing as earthly
[1:01:37] perfection we're looking for a day when
[1:01:39] we'll never have a bad thought never do
[1:01:41] anything wrong never make a mistake that
[1:01:42] is not Bible perfection but Bible
[1:01:46] perfection is you may not always do it
[1:01:48] right but you'll reach an age in Christ
[1:01:51] to where when you do when you do make a
[1:01:53] mistake and do wrong you will know how
[1:01:55] to correct it you'll know how to deal
[1:01:57] with it
[1:01:57] you'll know how to act like a full-grown
[1:01:59] adult with it Amen people that are real
[1:02:02] full-grown Christians friends they can
[1:02:04] understand very quickly how to correct a
[1:02:06] wrong when they've made a mistake and
[1:02:07] done something wrong
[1:02:08] come on somebody hey listen to Nate this
[1:02:11] thing of well glory to God I'm gonna
[1:02:12] reach a place I'm never going to make a
[1:02:13] mistake I'll learn how to deal with my
[1:02:15] mistakes I'll learn how to govern my
[1:02:17] mistakes I'll learn how to answer for
[1:02:20] the mistakes and the wrongs that I do
[1:02:21] and learn how to correct them as we go
[1:02:23] along in life and and watch for those
[1:02:26] things and I don't get involved in
[1:02:27] messes and gone and what more like that
[1:02:29] gone that's a southern word I just mean
[1:02:32] a mess amen amen but your mess is my
[1:02:35] gone my gum is your mess alright are you
[1:02:37] with me alright perfect a full age now
[1:02:40] James chapter 1 verse 4 now I want you
[1:02:43] to look at this how the Bible identifies
[1:02:45] perfection and we're just looking at
[1:02:47] this because what we're talking about is
[1:02:49] climbing up jacob's ladder until the
[1:02:51] bride comes to a place of perfection now
[1:02:53] remember no man or woman can be perfect
[1:02:56] in any way outside of the blood of Jesus
[1:02:59] Christ do you know what makes you and I
[1:03:01] really perfect the fact that when we
[1:03:02] make a mistake we can repent and the
[1:03:05] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:03:08] all sin and unrighteousness that's what
[1:03:10] makes me perfect that's what makes me
[1:03:13] whole that's what makes me tzimmes in
[1:03:15] the eyes of God it ain't got nothing to
[1:03:17] do with how good I am it ain't got none
[1:03:19] to do with how good you are it is about
[1:03:20] the grace of God that's been ministered
[1:03:22] to you and I Amen said James chapter 1
[1:03:26] verse 4 now watch how the Bible said but
[1:03:28] let patience have her perfect word now
[1:03:34] this is a strange scripture in a way 99%
[1:03:37] of the time that you read the Bible you
[1:03:39] will always see the Bible identifies the
[1:03:42] masculine part you'll notice uh most of
[1:03:46] your scriptures will say him and we'll
[1:03:48] say to he or to him the works that I do
[1:03:52] shall he do also in the last days the
[1:03:55] manifestation of the sons doesn't say
[1:03:58] daughters doesn't say her doesn't say
[1:04:00] she always addresses the male because
[1:04:03] the male is the head of all the
[1:04:04] household the male is the head of his
[1:04:06] domain and so addresses the head and the
[1:04:09] head makes a way for the rest of the
[1:04:10] body so the women are included of course
[1:04:13] and all these things as I say something
[1:04:16] about the manifestation of sons well if
[1:04:18] there's a manifestation of the son of
[1:04:20] God there is a daughter of God somewhere
[1:04:22] following that example that would be
[1:04:23] manifested the same way but the Bible
[1:04:26] always addresses sons always addresses
[1:04:30] him until we come to this part here and
[1:04:33] of all the scriptures that you could
[1:04:35] read I just go study it sometimes Steve
[1:04:37] I'm telling the truth all of a sudden
[1:04:39] now it's a her wonder why he's talking
[1:04:44] to her her that needs to make this
[1:04:45] manifest
[1:04:46] it's the bride part that drinks this
[1:04:49] forth Alleluia but let patience have her
[1:04:54] perfect work that ye may be PE R FA CT I
[1:04:59] don't forget that doesn't mean never
[1:05:01] make a mistake never do nothing wrong
[1:05:02] never have an error never have a bad
[1:05:04] thought that's the human definition
[1:05:05] which I'm not the Bible definition of
[1:05:07] perfection full grown adult mature
[1:05:09] complete amen but let patience have her
[1:05:13] perfect word that you may be perfect and
[1:05:15] entire wanting nothing
[1:05:18] do you understand we can come to a place
[1:05:20] in Christ so where we can see is very
[1:05:23] characteristics pressing out of our
[1:05:25] flesh living out of our life and we
[1:05:27] realize I am just like him but friends
[1:05:31] in order for us to see this in ourselves
[1:05:32] we are going to have to disqualify all
[1:05:36] of the other stuff that we see you know
[1:05:38] what our biggest problem is as far as
[1:05:40] human beings go we focus too much on the
[1:05:42] negative side we see every mistake we
[1:05:45] make with you yeah we consider every
[1:05:47] wrong we've ever thought we look at all
[1:05:49] of the bad parts about us and we don't
[1:05:51] measure up to that good part that's
[1:05:53] living out of us amen the very fact that
[1:05:55] you're sitting in this church this
[1:05:56] morning is the miracle of your life
[1:05:58] you could have walked out of here been
[1:06:00] back slid years ago but why are you here
[1:06:02] God in His mercy let you stand when
[1:06:05] there wasn't nothing to stand for amen
[1:06:08] count that is something well I made a
[1:06:09] lot of mistakes sure but you're here
[1:06:11] amen I said you're here you may see me
[1:06:13] somewhere else you could be anywhere in
[1:06:15] the world but you're right here right
[1:06:16] now why God has put a character in your
[1:06:18] life to help you endure through this
[1:06:20] evil age it's gonna get harder than
[1:06:23] gonna get easier it's gonna get tougher
[1:06:25] as we go along now let's look at our
[1:06:27] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 10 oh
[1:06:29] my do you love the lord well praise the
[1:06:32] lord i love him too that's that's good
[1:06:34] we must be brothers and sisters amen let
[1:06:37] patience have your print undeterred
[1:06:39] translation James 1:4 said that your
[1:06:41] patience will be crowned with
[1:06:44] perfectness your patience will be
[1:06:47] crowned with perfection with entirety
[1:06:50] with completeness your patience Laurie
[1:06:53] will be crowned with perfectness oh
[1:06:57] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:06:59] Oh hallelujah first cut in chapter 13
[1:07:02] verse 10 now many people have a tendency
[1:07:04] dub I don't want to say twist I don't
[1:07:08] want to make it sound like people do
[1:07:09] things on purpose but sometimes they do
[1:07:11] but sometimes they misunderstands a
[1:07:13] better way and they use this scripture
[1:07:15] to kindly put gifts out and put Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost out and put emotions and things
[1:07:19] out but that's not what the Bible is
[1:07:21] saying here when that which is perfect
[1:07:23] is come then that which is in part shall
[1:07:27] be done away with now in our minds we
[1:07:30] read this and a lot of times people say
[1:07:32] well that goes to prove errs no more
[1:07:34] gifts and there's no more emotions and I
[1:07:36] see different folks around here you
[1:07:39] might some of you might be represented
[1:07:41] from the continent of Africa and and I I
[1:07:43] know that there's a move I just returned
[1:07:46] there earlier last year and I've been
[1:07:48] three or four times the last couple of
[1:07:50] years and I run into several brothers
[1:07:53] and there's a move on that continent of
[1:07:54] course it's one of the one of the
[1:07:56] largest moves I've recognized that's
[1:07:58] trying to say well we're in the word now
[1:08:00] therefore we don't need worship we don't
[1:08:02] need gifts and we don't need emotions
[1:08:04] and we don't need all in things and and
[1:08:06] they use this scripture to try to say
[1:08:08] such a thing to the believers and I just
[1:08:11] told them over there when I preach the
[1:08:12] convention some time ago I'll tell you
[1:08:14] what that spirit come from the US as
[1:08:17] that's what the idea that a lot of
[1:08:18] people have got around this message and
[1:08:20] now we got the word we shouldn't worship
[1:08:21] we shouldn't stand in clap we shouldn't
[1:08:23] holler a man we shouldn't cry we
[1:08:25] shouldn't shout but that ain't what this
[1:08:27] scriptures saying right here what this
[1:08:29] scripture is telling us is that when
[1:08:31] that which is perfect is come everything
[1:08:33] we understood partially all of the error
[1:08:36] that we had and what we believed would
[1:08:38] be done away with
[1:08:39] Amen we have justification by Martin
[1:08:42] Luther is that right we believe the just
[1:08:44] shall live by faith but at the opening
[1:08:46] of the seven seals when the seven
[1:08:48] thunders sounded to open up the mystery
[1:08:50] of God we only had justification as the
[1:08:52] judge so I lived my faith but that was a
[1:08:55] partial understanding but when the word
[1:08:57] came open we understood what true
[1:08:59] justification really was as though you
[1:09:01] never done it in the first place a man a
[1:09:05] man as though it never happened before
[1:09:07] Amen Wesley had sanctification but when
[1:09:10] the word came open
[1:09:11] the elect of God in this last day amen
[1:09:14] we understood sanctification not to be
[1:09:16] an action of holiness or what you wear
[1:09:18] or what you don't wear but
[1:09:20] sanctification is the Spirit of God as
[1:09:23] sanctified a man's heart took all sin
[1:09:25] out of his heart and spirit amen at one
[1:09:28] time where the RAM thought Pentecost was
[1:09:29] the restoration of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:09:31] Holy Spirit revealed to him it was just
[1:09:33] the restoration of gifts Amen we had
[1:09:36] partial understanding with that some
[1:09:37] made it the initial evidence some took
[1:09:40] prophecies that didn't line up with the
[1:09:41] Bible some took this some took that but
[1:09:44] when that which is perfect is come the
[1:09:46] real revelation of the message of the
[1:09:48] day and the revelation of the hours
[1:09:50] stepped on the scene now we know what
[1:09:52] true tongues look like now we know what
[1:09:54] true prophecy looks like amen if a man a
[1:09:57] woman tried to start a bunch of stuff on
[1:09:58] prophecy amen we've got a standard we
[1:10:01] got something complete that we can take
[1:10:03] it right back into the word and say this
[1:10:05] is what it's supposed to look like
[1:10:07] we don't do away with it we complete it
[1:10:09] we complete the understanding of it amen
[1:10:13] my girls are in school they started out
[1:10:15] in kindergarten just like all the rest
[1:10:17] of us did they came up through first
[1:10:19] second third grade my daughter Elizabeth
[1:10:21] she's coming up now where she's learning
[1:10:23] fractions and all kinds of things but I
[1:10:25] remember when they start her in
[1:10:26] mathematics they were started with what
[1:10:29] numbers are 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 ones a whole
[1:10:32] number and ones this and that this is an
[1:10:35] integer they would say or this is a
[1:10:36] certain type of number and they would
[1:10:39] start him on that and then they would
[1:10:40] give him a little piece of what's going
[1:10:42] to happen in the next grade well they
[1:10:44] would take that mystery and they would
[1:10:46] lay that mystery into the next part and
[1:10:48] you didn't really understood understand
[1:10:50] rather what's getting ready to take
[1:10:51] place unless you carried on to the
[1:10:53] second grade when you got to the second
[1:10:55] grade then that which was known in part
[1:10:57] was known in fool then they finished
[1:11:00] that part and then when they come to the
[1:11:01] third grade they left a little mystery
[1:11:03] at the end of the second grade and that
[1:11:05] little mystery was then made manifest in
[1:11:07] the third and then in the fourth and
[1:11:08] then in the fifth and then in the sixth
[1:11:10] and then when we come to the seventh
[1:11:11] grade if you understand my parable I
[1:11:13] meant all them little mysteries that was
[1:11:15] left undone down through those church
[1:11:17] ages then when he which was the perfect
[1:11:19] one had come to the earth to take the
[1:11:21] book of Redemption to open up them seven
[1:11:24] seals gather
[1:11:25] of all them little mysteries that was
[1:11:27] laying out there and finished him
[1:11:29] completed him so that there was no
[1:11:31] question where the bride stood in the
[1:11:33] last day hey man this is why the prophet
[1:11:36] of God said we by God's grace have the
[1:11:38] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:11:40] this last day of the Bible he said the
[1:11:43] Bible became a new book to him why the
[1:11:45] things we didn't understand the little
[1:11:46] mysteries left over we now were
[1:11:48] completed amen it shouldn't mean to us
[1:11:51] we shouldn't have a question about to
[1:11:53] Godhead a man we shouldn't have a
[1:11:57] question about holiness there should be
[1:11:59] no questions about marriage and divorce
[1:12:00] in serpent seed in the all of these
[1:12:03] great mister water baptism there
[1:12:04] shouldn't be a question in the mind of a
[1:12:06] true message believer that follows the
[1:12:08] message of William Branham there should
[1:12:10] be no questions as to any of these
[1:12:12] mysteries of God about heaven about Hell
[1:12:14] about Redemption about the blood there
[1:12:17] should be no mystery left that we don't
[1:12:19] understand the mysteries should be
[1:12:21] finished
[1:12:22] amen about the character of Jesus Christ
[1:12:25] it just baffles my mind sometimes that
[1:12:27] people are still living under first and
[1:12:28] second pool teaching to them they don't
[1:12:31] understand the words been opened up to
[1:12:33] us so they're still they still try to
[1:12:35] look for a Pentecostal revival hey I
[1:12:38] believe in a Pentecostal revival I
[1:12:39] believe in Pentecost but I don't believe
[1:12:41] in a modern day version of that or you
[1:12:44] lay an empty hand on an empty head and
[1:12:45] call a few people to preach hello
[1:12:48] somebody I'm talking about the
[1:12:50] revelation of the word we're talking
[1:12:51] about the character of Jesus Christ
[1:12:53] that's what true Pentecost is bringing a
[1:12:55] revival into the heart of the bride of
[1:12:57] Jesus Christ
[1:12:58] to where she understands that she's not
[1:13:00] just a an outside source I'm not just a
[1:13:03] a believer living outside the graces of
[1:13:06] God I'm not just gathered into the house
[1:13:08] of the Lord are you listening to me I'm
[1:13:10] not just gathered in amen in a
[1:13:12] protracted meeting willy-nilly as we say
[1:13:14] down home I mean I'm not just gathered
[1:13:16] here for the sake but if I'm a child of
[1:13:18] God I am a joint heir with Jesus Christ
[1:13:21] I am on equal footing with our Lord
[1:13:23] Jesus
[1:13:24] there should be no questions if there's
[1:13:27] questions it's our fault not the Bible's
[1:13:28] part not the prophets fault not the
[1:13:30] messages fault it's our fault amen
[1:13:33] some time ago some men put some
[1:13:35] questions on the internet and it snagged
[1:13:37] a bunch of people you know what I say
[1:13:39] I said the problem was they didn't go to
[1:13:40] the right answer if you want to
[1:13:42] understand the answers to many of the
[1:13:43] questions about this message don't go to
[1:13:45] mr. Google he ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] hello somebody don't go to some
[1:13:51] theologian he ain't born again if you
[1:13:52] want the answers go where the answers
[1:13:54] lie that's right here in the Bible right
[1:13:56] here's the answer to the Bible oh they
[1:13:58] said well you know brother Branham gives
[1:13:59] certain visions and certain things
[1:14:01] didn't got the pass and on and on on and
[1:14:03] the Bible said that if a prophet gives
[1:14:05] of a vision presumptuously and it
[1:14:07] doesn't come to pass
[1:14:08] don't fear him for I'm not with him I
[1:14:10] said that's not a man black brother
[1:14:12] Branham was talking about when he said
[1:14:14] that he went to go shoot the brown bear
[1:14:15] and he missed it the will of God God's
[1:14:18] part was he's gonna shoot the bear but
[1:14:20] he missed it
[1:14:20] brother Branham missed it himself the
[1:14:22] vision didn't fail brother brems the one
[1:14:24] that failed on that Amen when he's
[1:14:25] supposed to go to Africa and go to Indy
[1:14:28] at a certain time and go down then and
[1:14:29] preachers talk to him out of it it
[1:14:30] wasn't that God's Will was compromised
[1:14:32] it was that a man got out of the will of
[1:14:34] God himself hey brother a man can get
[1:14:36] out of the will of God that's why he
[1:14:38] preached to us there's two types of will
[1:14:39] permissive will and perfect will amen
[1:14:42] but all one has to do is get on a plane
[1:14:43] and hop over to Ghana or to Congo or to
[1:14:46] Uganda or somewhere like that and you
[1:14:47] can see God's will hasn't been staunch
[1:14:49] not a bit it's a continent of some of
[1:14:52] the greatest message believing people
[1:14:53] we've got in the entire world
[1:14:55] there's more concentrated in the in the
[1:14:57] continent of Africa than any way in the
[1:14:59] world why you cannot stop God's will no
[1:15:01] matter who fails or who don't fail Amen
[1:15:04] I don't care what anybody said oh they
[1:15:06] say that's reason not to follow him
[1:15:07] alright then how about you I want to see
[1:15:09] your perfect life I want to see a man at
[1:15:12] as Santa I've never not I never
[1:15:13] disobeyed God I've never missed his will
[1:15:15] oh come on you know better than that
[1:15:17] amen sometimes a man will follow his own
[1:15:20] will follow his own thoughts instead of
[1:15:22] following the will of God that's not
[1:15:24] what Moses was talking about he's
[1:15:26] talking about a prophet that just tell
[1:15:27] lies to get the people to follow him I
[1:15:29] mean it's all about a man that missed
[1:15:31] missed the will of God or made mistakes
[1:15:33] hey just give me a just give me five
[1:15:36] minutes of your time to sit down I
[1:15:37] guarantee in five minutes you'll tell me
[1:15:39] something you've done wrong give me five
[1:15:43] minutes of your time I'll tell you
[1:15:44] something I probably don't rolling down
[1:15:45] through the years
[1:15:46] Amen I won't have to think too hard
[1:15:47] either Amen come on somebody
[1:15:50] Amen I don't have to think too hard I
[1:15:52] can get
[1:15:53] see they meant it's it's it's it's human
[1:15:55] nature it's what it is
[1:15:56] now now notice in this jacob's ladder
[1:15:59] now now notice that our patients not
[1:16:03] just going back just kind of touching
[1:16:05] James one for your patients will be
[1:16:07] crowned when nothing is lacking in your
[1:16:11] Christian character I remember the
[1:16:12] Prophet uses the example of a boxcar and
[1:16:14] he said that when everything is said in
[1:16:17] that boxcar and everything's right he
[1:16:20] places a seal on the outside of that
[1:16:21] boxcar you said will be anybody that
[1:16:24] touches that until it reaches his final
[1:16:26] destination
[1:16:27] now we know that when you receive the
[1:16:30] Holy Ghost now this of this clothes
[1:16:31] don't fail this when a man or woman
[1:16:33] receives the Holy Ghost everything they
[1:16:36] have need of is already inside of them
[1:16:40] even the raptures on the inside of you
[1:16:43] it's just a matter than brother Keith of
[1:16:46] drink and grow drink and go eat and go
[1:16:51] nobody's born full-grown just look at
[1:16:54] these little young people if you don't
[1:16:56] believe it hey man these little humans
[1:16:58] running around here we call them babies
[1:16:59] we call them children what Paul say that
[1:17:02] should be no more children whenever you
[1:17:04] can't be children though I just say it
[1:17:05] goes to prove were not born full-grown
[1:17:08] but we have all of them characteristics
[1:17:10] down inside looking at some of these
[1:17:12] young babies around here a little boy
[1:17:13] their own brothers lap hey he may be a
[1:17:16] preacher he may be an architect he may
[1:17:17] be an engineer he made to be the
[1:17:19] greatest war general that ever walked
[1:17:21] human history we don't know whatever his
[1:17:22] potential is laying inside of him right
[1:17:24] now experience will mold him in shaping
[1:17:28] I mean if you had been sitting in
[1:17:29] Germany prior to the prior to war war to
[1:17:33] say he's sitting in a church house like
[1:17:35] this and there might have been 15 babies
[1:17:37] getting ready to be dedicated and that
[1:17:39] priest reach over and sprinkle a bunch
[1:17:41] of water on those little babies I mean
[1:17:43] little did he know when he was
[1:17:44] sprinkling the water on the head of
[1:17:46] Adolf Hitler that it would turn out to
[1:17:49] be one of the greatest monsters that
[1:17:50] we've ever seen in the world's history a
[1:17:52] genocide against the Jews but as a baby
[1:17:55] he might have been cute mom am I too
[1:17:57] good at him in mmm and all that kind of
[1:18:00] stuff like that but what was ever laying
[1:18:03] and that child was laying in that child
[1:18:04] when it was a baby amen I know the blood
[1:18:07] Jesus Christ protects children but there
[1:18:09] was a reason that God told Joshua go
[1:18:11] down and tell it all because he knew
[1:18:14] whatever that potential was it'd be
[1:18:15] shaped by what the environment it lived
[1:18:17] in it'd be molded by the people who
[1:18:19] raised it the people who trained it the
[1:18:21] people who taught it all hallelujah if
[1:18:23] they'd be that way on the negative side
[1:18:24] what about a child of God in heavenly
[1:18:28] places in Christ Jesus
[1:18:30] they'll be molded to live like Jesus
[1:18:32] Christ amen I don't mean to get loud but
[1:18:36] I get happy I mean I enjoy what I'm
[1:18:39] talking about
[1:18:40] amen watch this my in Rome in the second
[1:18:44] miracle brother Brendan says like this
[1:18:45] now some people has great big faith
[1:18:49] anything can happen
[1:18:50] he's making an example and he said some
[1:18:53] have faith that deep something is it
[1:18:55] takes them a little longer some have
[1:18:57] faith that deep takes a little while
[1:18:58] some have faith like a mustard seed but
[1:19:01] if it is mustard seed faith just keep
[1:19:03] believing it and to become marble faith
[1:19:07] marble faith will become grapefruit face
[1:19:10] then grapefruit faith will become
[1:19:12] mountains now this type of faith is what
[1:19:17] Paul addresses in the book of Romans is
[1:19:19] a measure of faith we've all been given
[1:19:22] a measure of faith now you notice that
[1:19:25] when brother Bentham is identifying this
[1:19:27] type of faith you could have to
[1:19:29] something certain deep and you could
[1:19:31] have a little deeper and you can have
[1:19:32] maybe deeper than that but when it comes
[1:19:34] to the foundation of faith in this
[1:19:36] statue of a perfect man it isn't one
[1:19:39] that's bigger a littler than the other
[1:19:40] we're all on the same foundation being a
[1:19:46] preacher being a housewife beaut of
[1:19:47] Factory burger being a deacon being a
[1:19:49] trustee we all start at the same
[1:19:50] foundation not some this deep and this
[1:19:53] deep and that deep it's all the same
[1:19:54] thing all the way across the board
[1:19:56] because we are all born by the faith of
[1:19:58] the Son of God
[1:19:59] it wasn't even my faith is same it was
[1:20:01] his faith Oh hallelujah to the lamb of
[1:20:03] God holiday it was hats fate that same
[1:20:06] it it was hats faith that birthed my
[1:20:08] heart I meant one day my own faith just
[1:20:11] really I couldn't believe for myself so
[1:20:13] God had to believe his word through me
[1:20:15] amen it was faith on the foundation of
[1:20:18] faith I want you to notice this
[1:20:20] that when a person is born on this
[1:20:22] foundation of faith remember this is the
[1:20:24] nature of God being born into that
[1:20:26] person faith is like a sea and
[1:20:29] everything that's going to be in that
[1:20:31] seat is already in it every bit of
[1:20:33] virtue every bit of knowledge temperance
[1:20:34] patience brotherly kindness God is all
[1:20:36] then things are already on the inside of
[1:20:38] me so then like Psalm 1 blessed is he
[1:20:41] this like a tree planted by the rivers
[1:20:43] of living water so as he's positionally
[1:20:46] placed in Christ Jesus that's his
[1:20:48] position he may not realize what he's
[1:20:50] going to bring forth but he's
[1:20:52] positionally placed in Christ Jesus
[1:20:53] brother M said your part to play was
[1:20:56] already determined in God before the
[1:20:58] world ever began if I'm gonna be a
[1:21:02] preacher I was a preacher before I was a
[1:21:04] baby if I'm gonna be a housewife I was a
[1:21:07] housewife before I took the breath of
[1:21:09] life why was God made me that way before
[1:21:11] the world began
[1:21:13] I was positionally placed in Christ
[1:21:15] Jesus then it's a matter of what does
[1:21:17] that little seed does he draws in from
[1:21:18] the minerals draws in from the nutrients
[1:21:21] he draws in from the water he draws in
[1:21:23] from the sunlight and then after a
[1:21:24] little while you stick up out of the
[1:21:27] ground what is that that's the first
[1:21:29] shoe to virtue he's adding to his faith
[1:21:32] and as he adds to his faith comes virtue
[1:21:35] and then after a while it'll Blanche
[1:21:36] Branch goes off the side what's he done
[1:21:39] he's adding or he's adding temperance
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:41] or he's adding knowledge rather he adds
[1:21:43] a little knowledge to his virtue a
[1:21:44] little fur virtue to his faith and all
[1:21:46] the sudden on the branch goes fruit
[1:21:47] what's it doing he's adding a little
[1:21:50] temperance to his wound to his knowledge
[1:21:52] a man then another one goes what is that
[1:21:54] that's patience then brotherly kindness
[1:21:56] then godliness regardless and brotherly
[1:21:58] kindness he goes all the way up Jacob's
[1:22:00] Ladder now you'll notice when Jacob sees
[1:22:03] this ladder he said it is the gate to
[1:22:06] heaven and it is the house of the Lord
[1:22:08] our challenges sometimes just to get you
[1:22:12] a good look at this in the book of
[1:22:13] Ephesians and who he called the house of
[1:22:15] God you are the house of God the body of
[1:22:22] Christ and members in particular where
[1:22:24] is God's presence where is God's
[1:22:26] character where is God's life
[1:22:28] where's God's assets wise God contained
[1:22:32] an today
[1:22:33] and yeah the bride of Jesus Christ house
[1:22:37] is the power and deity of Almighty God
[1:22:40] she is his house but it's also the gate
[1:22:43] to heaven amen as you walk in through
[1:22:46] the faith gate remember in a water way
[1:22:48] as the light today buried in the
[1:22:49] precious name of Jesus Christ he said
[1:22:52] that's a strait not STR iai ght like
[1:22:55] straight through but SCR AIT which is a
[1:22:57] waterway amen that's the gate that's the
[1:23:00] reason God that the Lord Jesus had to
[1:23:03] give the keys to Peter because the gate
[1:23:05] was closed to mankind remember he
[1:23:07] slammed the gate shut in the Garden of
[1:23:09] Eden and set up set a flaming sword at
[1:23:11] that gate and said no man could come and
[1:23:14] partake of the Tree of Life the gate was
[1:23:16] locked the gate was shut and a flaming
[1:23:18] sword set before it but hallelujah when
[1:23:20] Peter got them keys on the day of
[1:23:22] Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came down
[1:23:24] to humanity he took that gate to heaven
[1:23:27] that key and slammed it into the gate
[1:23:29] swung the gate of it and said repent and
[1:23:32] be baptized in the name of Jesus and you
[1:23:35] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:36] amen the gate was slammed he said was
[1:23:42] guarded by holy fire he said that's the
[1:23:43] reason some people can't get in there
[1:23:45] because they're afraid of holy fire you
[1:23:47] can't be afraid of fire amen he that's
[1:23:50] afraid of the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:23:51] remember he is the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:23:52] he that's afraid of holy fire will never
[1:23:55] get inside that gate but he that loves
[1:23:56] holy fire will probably make it amen at
[1:23:59] the righteous scarcely be savor the
[1:24:01] sinners in the ungodly appear Oh
[1:24:02] hallelujah somebody I talked about the
[1:24:05] gate to heaven Jacob's Ladder once he
[1:24:07] gets inside the gate it is the gate to
[1:24:09] heaven but it is the house of God haha I
[1:24:11] mean once he steps in the house then he
[1:24:14] starts climbing up Jacob's Ladder and
[1:24:16] who is at the top of the ladder the Lord
[1:24:18] Himself of course
[1:24:21] hey amen look at this you come all the
[1:24:27] way through faith virtue knowledge
[1:24:28] temperance patience got this brotherly
[1:24:30] kindness but when you come to the
[1:24:33] capstone which is the perfect part
[1:24:35] remember the capstone is a perfect stone
[1:24:38] within itself and everything underneath
[1:24:41] it has to be setting in perfect orders
[1:24:43] got to be honed just right that's the
[1:24:46] reason you need to come
[1:24:47] Church because when you come to church
[1:24:49] preachers wield a sharp two-edged sword
[1:24:51] and if you got rough edges something
[1:24:53] that would keep the capstone from
[1:24:54] setting down on you you come get cut on
[1:24:56] that's reason you come to church amen
[1:24:58] some of us that I come to church so that
[1:25:00] I could just come to church you cousin
[1:25:01] Church get cut on I want somebody not
[1:25:04] know not nice cut on I'm done just cut
[1:25:06] ain't being a nice ain't mean cut on hey
[1:25:09] if he's got to yell at me I wanted me
[1:25:10] yeah that's what it takes get these
[1:25:11] rough edges that ya gotta be if you got
[1:25:13] to I want to be right with God Amen
[1:25:16] because when that capstone goes to set
[1:25:18] down if everything just isn't exactly
[1:25:19] honed he can't sit now I'm perfectly
[1:25:21] like that and this is the reason why
[1:25:24] Peter said he that forgets these things
[1:25:26] he's blind
[1:25:27] he can't really even see what the
[1:25:29] character of Jesus Christ is all about
[1:25:30] he's forgotten that he was a saved man
[1:25:32] but he never continued on that God's
[1:25:34] character could be lived lived right
[1:25:36] through his life seat now watch coming
[1:25:38] to the capstone of it now watch some
[1:25:41] people we know the Prophet tells us in
[1:25:42] the blasphemous names possess portions
[1:25:45] of these virtues NaturallySpeaking so
[1:25:49] naturally maybe your mama was a patient
[1:25:51] woman you might be patient too at your
[1:25:53] patience and Mama's patience but that's
[1:25:56] not God's patience because Mama's
[1:25:58] patience can't last as long as God's
[1:26:00] patience can that is patience can handle
[1:26:04] it the trials and there and the heat of
[1:26:07] waiting on a promise of God to be
[1:26:08] fulfilled like God's patience can't Oh
[1:26:11] God Lord I need a little bit more of
[1:26:13] your patience in my life amen that your
[1:26:16] word when it can become fulfilled it may
[1:26:18] take 25 years to see the thing come to
[1:26:20] pass but God I leave a little bit more
[1:26:21] of that in my life even so how do I get
[1:26:23] it as I drink I grow as I drink I push
[1:26:26] as I drink out comes the manifestation
[1:26:28] amen how do I get there stand a wide
[1:26:30] lead feet on the word and let the word
[1:26:31] shake me into the image of Christ amen
[1:26:34] that's why people they don't like hard
[1:26:36] preaching they're probably never gonna
[1:26:37] make the rapture see nobody wants to say
[1:26:41] Amen on that cuz nobody wants hard
[1:26:42] preaching it goes so high lady we'll see
[1:26:44] and we are come on some I don't look at
[1:26:47] me like a mule standing at a new gate is
[1:26:49] the truth that's the reason why the real
[1:26:51] Bride of Christ wants somebody to tell
[1:26:53] them the truth if they gotta cut them if
[1:26:55] they gotta send them if they got a shake
[1:26:58] I wanted it tell me the truth so I can
[1:27:00] be ready for his but everybody wants the
[1:27:04] preacher who's you know charismatic and
[1:27:06] he's nice he smiles and don't hurt
[1:27:09] nobody's feelings that's the kind of
[1:27:10] preacher people want nowadays that's
[1:27:11] politics friends that ain't preaching
[1:27:13] that ain't preaching if you'd have been
[1:27:16] sitting in Paul's service and he'd
[1:27:17] called your name Jaime Gnaeus and
[1:27:19] philetus or Harold's end to the
[1:27:22] coppersmith hey some of them people
[1:27:24] never even got recorded in the pages of
[1:27:26] the Bible but Alexander coppersmith went
[1:27:28] down in infamy because of the kind of
[1:27:29] kind of man he was to Paul come on
[1:27:32] somebody
[1:27:33] hey as a clear ayat aureus for his
[1:27:35] actions his behavior he said Alexander
[1:27:37] the coppersmith done me much evil the
[1:27:39] Lord reward him Amen nobody wants that
[1:27:43] kind of preacher and lady or SIA they
[1:27:45] want the kind they can look good on a on
[1:27:47] a camera and around the internet and
[1:27:48] everybody join in and oh oh what a great
[1:27:50] preacher and what a great lovely man
[1:27:52] used to be when we had tapes and CDs and
[1:27:54] all that stuff like that all that that
[1:27:56] was the guy you know they they wanted to
[1:27:57] get all of his tapes and CDs but now
[1:27:59] that we got to computers and we got the
[1:28:01] Internet
[1:28:01] oh my everybody wants that preacher that
[1:28:03] looks good on the camera a man he don't
[1:28:06] want somebody ugly I can't be ugly he
[1:28:07] got to be somewhat handsome and he can't
[1:28:09] spit when he talks because I don't look
[1:28:11] good on the internet come on somebody
[1:28:12] oh no we want the Joel Osteen version of
[1:28:15] the message or everything is positive we
[1:28:17] want the Hagee's of the message and the
[1:28:19] Benny Hinn's of the message but the real
[1:28:21] bride ain't looking for a hand she's
[1:28:23] looking for an ego and she's looking for
[1:28:25] somebody to take that word and she's got
[1:28:29] to be cut out cut me out let me write I
[1:28:35] mean they once somebody knows how to
[1:28:38] gesture right and her hair slicked in a
[1:28:41] certain way where everybody can see how
[1:28:43] handsome they are oh yeah you pay more
[1:28:45] ties to a handsome man than they do the
[1:28:47] ugly one mm-hm that's lady OCS age we're
[1:28:50] living in but that's not the character
[1:28:52] of Jesus Christ amen naturally they can
[1:28:55] possess certain things in Ephesians six
[1:28:57] 10 through 18 the Bible said that we're
[1:28:58] a soldier dressed up with a sword in our
[1:29:00] hand helmet on our head shoes on our
[1:29:03] feet or loins Girt a breastplate dirt
[1:29:05] all of this soldiers dressed up and Paul
[1:29:08] puts the weaponry in his hand all for
[1:29:10] offense
[1:29:11] and defense of the shield of faith but
[1:29:15] don't forget Paul has put the soldier in
[1:29:19] his armor but Peters putting character
[1:29:22] in that soldier because the soldier with
[1:29:26] a sword in his hands a dangerous man if
[1:29:28] it doesn't have character to know what
[1:29:30] to do with that word that's probably the
[1:29:32] reason God ain't give us third Pole
[1:29:33] power yet because the first time we got
[1:29:36] mad at somebody we would poof just speak
[1:29:38] them out of existence there are many red
[1:29:41] lights in the United States of America I
[1:29:43] would poof out of existence because I
[1:29:44] hate a red light when I'm in go mode I
[1:29:46] hate to stop a man there aren't many
[1:29:49] flies that I would probably speak kind
[1:29:51] of existence Moses brought him in I'd
[1:29:53] take him out cuz I hate to fly worse
[1:29:55] than anything is a cockroach with wings
[1:29:57] on it hey man I hate a bug like that I
[1:30:00] just hate a bug we've stolen last night
[1:30:02] about the toys talking about some of
[1:30:04] those missionary trips and a big
[1:30:05] tarantula this way Oh God I'd do it Lord
[1:30:08] but I'd die while I was doing it I hate
[1:30:10] a bug I hate an insect but if I had
[1:30:12] third Pole power the one me another fly
[1:30:13] ever again long as you ever lived amen
[1:30:16] come on somebody but God doesn't give us
[1:30:18] that kind of power he gives us a sword
[1:30:20] he gives us a shield
[1:30:21] he gives us a helmet but then he defects
[1:30:23] the catch or the warrior so that he
[1:30:25] knows how to use the word correctly
[1:30:27] because if you have no character you
[1:30:29] might take that sword and cut your
[1:30:30] brother's head off so God he puts
[1:30:32] character in the soldier amen amen thank
[1:30:35] God for a little touch of character amen
[1:30:38] that's right Romans chapter 8 verse 14
[1:30:40] because the first time that Walmart lady
[1:30:41] glared at you in the wrong way she
[1:30:43] disappeared poof she's gone how to loo
[1:30:45] your third poor powertech God said I
[1:30:48] can't do that yet you got to have
[1:30:49] forgiveness you got to have love
[1:30:50] amen perfect hatred will bring upon
[1:30:53] perfect love in the bride of Jesus
[1:30:54] Christ because it would be a perfect
[1:30:56] contrast in the last day perfect hatred
[1:30:58] will produce perfect love because in an
[1:31:01] age where Jesus said that the love of
[1:31:03] many will wax cold when love is
[1:31:04] completely drained out like water
[1:31:06] draining I have a bucket with a hole in
[1:31:08] it then God is filling the devil's
[1:31:10] filling the world up with perfect hatred
[1:31:12] as love goes out and as a meant as
[1:31:14] hatred goes out and love is coming into
[1:31:17] the bride then as love goes out hatred
[1:31:19] filling the other so will be the vice
[1:31:21] versa see the bride hatred us were
[1:31:23] falling out of love
[1:31:24] laughs start flowing into the heart of
[1:31:28] it be vice versa they're losing love and
[1:31:32] being filled with hate we're losing hate
[1:31:34] being filled with love amen amen amen
[1:31:37] Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by
[1:31:39] the Spirit of God there are the sons of
[1:31:41] God led we're up Jacob's Ladder and then
[1:31:45] we're crisis at the top he's at the top
[1:31:46] of this ladder once we ascend the ladder
[1:31:48] he's at the top of it even if we have
[1:31:50] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:31:52] to fear
[1:31:52] I hate bondage I said I hate bondage oh
[1:31:58] you say but you're a Christian yeah but
[1:32:00] I've been under bondage many times in my
[1:32:02] life some little pets in some little bit
[1:32:05] settings sin I'm just being honest
[1:32:07] come on I preaching to no Angels in here
[1:32:09] come on now
[1:32:11] some little thought some little
[1:32:13] aggravation some little attitude some
[1:32:15] little feeling toward another man or
[1:32:16] another woman amen some no humans
[1:32:18] reaction or some little something
[1:32:20] no she done me wrong he done me wrong
[1:32:22] I've been in bondage many time but I did
[1:32:24] not receive a spirit of bondage I
[1:32:26] receive a spirit of Liberty amen you did
[1:32:29] too that's why spirits of bondage we
[1:32:31] should break every one of them off our
[1:32:33] life we should never be in bondage we've
[1:32:35] been given a spirit of freedom off you
[1:32:38] like shouting I just don't know if
[1:32:39] you'll shout with me or not I mean I
[1:32:41] don't want to be nervous amen that's
[1:32:42] right watch now he said for you do not
[1:32:44] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:32:46] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:32:48] adoption amen whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:32:52] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[1:32:55] spirit that we are the children of God a
[1:32:59] man I love this together he said we are
[1:33:01] children amen there's a man then heirs
[1:33:07] of God praise the Lord and then join
[1:33:10] heirs oh don't rush it you trying to
[1:33:13] rush it I don't want you to rush it
[1:33:14] don't you understand we're not just
[1:33:16] heirs
[1:33:16] I'm not just a recipient I'm not just
[1:33:19] sitting here waiting on him to give me
[1:33:20] something I'm a joint heir which means
[1:33:22] everything that is his is mine
[1:33:25] everything that is mine is his or
[1:33:27] something wrong with your shower I want
[1:33:29] to know hallelujah Amen we're dried out
[1:33:31] I am NOT subject to him I am co-equal
[1:33:34] with him according the Bible and that's
[1:33:36] what the Bible said amen
[1:33:38] you like the Bible don't you believe the
[1:33:39] Bible that's what it said if so be we
[1:33:42] suffer with him we may also be glorified
[1:33:45] together well praise the Lord for I
[1:33:48] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:33:49] present time are not worthy to be
[1:33:51] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:33:54] revealed in us so where's that glory
[1:34:02] gonna be revealed at in us his word his
[1:34:09] life his substance his essence
[1:34:11] everything is is gonna be revealed
[1:34:12] through us Oh hallelujah let me just
[1:34:16] warn you I get to shaking my head we're
[1:34:17] about to have a Holy Ghost meeting hey
[1:34:19] man glory to God but I reckon that the
[1:34:23] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:34:24] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:34:25] which shall be revealed on us for the
[1:34:27] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:34:29] waiteth manifestation of the sons of God
[1:34:35] everything it's waiting upon this
[1:34:38] character to be manifested in the Bride
[1:34:41] of Christ everything is waiting for that
[1:34:44] moment for your life and my life to
[1:34:46] match up to tally up to God's Word in
[1:34:48] such a way just like a hand going up in
[1:34:50] a glove it fits just perfectly let me
[1:34:53] use the term balkanize when you
[1:34:56] vulcanized something usually a piece of
[1:34:57] rubber or something like that you put a
[1:34:59] lot of heat on it you can stick two
[1:35:01] pieces together and you you're frying
[1:35:02] long enough you know the little
[1:35:03] blowtorch something like that without
[1:35:05] burning the rubber up of course you've
[1:35:07] melted enough you can't tell where one
[1:35:08] stops and the other one begins amen
[1:35:14] that's what I believe it's gonna be the
[1:35:15] bride of Jesus Christ she said God's
[1:35:16] character would be in her so much that
[1:35:18] be God walking in your shoes you can't
[1:35:21] tell where he stops from where you begin
[1:35:23] where you begin and he stops ha ha I
[1:35:28] mean Jesus on the inside working to the
[1:35:30] outside make a difference in my life not
[1:35:33] just mine but everybody that I get
[1:35:35] around Amen vulcanized together the same
[1:35:37] spirit they wait for the manifestation
[1:35:41] of the sons of God everybody across the
[1:35:42] curtain of time is waiting for this
[1:35:45] thing to be revealed you notice here I
[1:35:48] got a little statement wrote down here
[1:35:50] something
[1:35:51] I want to relate to you about this Holy
[1:35:54] Ghost
[1:35:55] remember the prophet of God said it like
[1:35:56] this he says like a little white button
[1:35:59] Galatians 4 1 through 7 if you're
[1:36:01] writing it down
[1:36:02] he said because we were sons not going
[1:36:05] to be sons but because we were sons he
[1:36:08] sent his spirit into our heart crying
[1:36:10] Abba Father because we were sons we
[1:36:13] already were sons amen Romans 9 and for
[1:36:16] the Israelites to whom pertain of the
[1:36:20] adoption Paul was speaking to the
[1:36:22] natural part of adoption naturally
[1:36:25] speaking the laws of adoption was when a
[1:36:27] king was going to pass his sword over he
[1:36:30] found somebody that had the same
[1:36:31] character the same mind the same vision
[1:36:34] that he did and when he found a man that
[1:36:37] was just like him and character and
[1:36:38] thought anything he passed his sword but
[1:36:40] he also give him a ring the ring was
[1:36:43] used as a seal as you see they didn't
[1:36:45] put tape and lick the end of an envelope
[1:36:47] like we did whenever they sealed
[1:36:48] something they take a little wax off of
[1:36:51] a candle and they pour that wax on the
[1:36:53] edge of that envelope and they take
[1:36:54] their seal and have maybe their name or
[1:36:56] their initial or some kind of symbol or
[1:36:58] something they'd press that into that
[1:36:59] wax amen and when you got that letter
[1:37:01] you know who it come from Oh hallelujah
[1:37:04] to the lamb of God amen and that's what
[1:37:07] Jesus has done for you and I when he
[1:37:08] presses this capstone onto our life amen
[1:37:11] it will be Jesus Christ laying personal
[1:37:14] possession to every man and woman that's
[1:37:16] got these virtues inside of their life
[1:37:17] he'll seal it down amen and everything
[1:37:20] on the inside the contents on the inside
[1:37:22] will remain perfect until the day of
[1:37:24] your Redemption amen there's nobody can
[1:37:26] change it nobody can move it but he said
[1:37:28] it starts like a little white button he
[1:37:30] said it moves on the inside of your
[1:37:32] heart it starts like a little white
[1:37:33] button like this he said then Jesus
[1:37:36] grows into your mouth
[1:37:37] you don't say the things used to then he
[1:37:38] grows into your eyes you don't you don't
[1:37:40] you don't see it it was you he said it
[1:37:42] grows in your arms you don't pick up and
[1:37:44] walk and talk and after he said just a
[1:37:46] little white button he starts out like
[1:37:48] yeah amen I I told some I one day they
[1:37:50] said did you get to hold a ghost I said
[1:37:52] can you feel him kicking hallelujah it's
[1:37:55] Jesus on the inside what Paul say Christ
[1:37:58] in you is the hope of glory oh I feel
[1:38:00] like Sam they may
[1:38:02] I've got Christ's hands working to the
[1:38:06] outside making a difference the seven
[1:38:10] thunders when they revealed they
[1:38:11] revealed the very character of Jesus
[1:38:14] Christ and seven undone thunders is a
[1:38:17] very simple thing whenever the mysteries
[1:38:19] of God was going to come open he said
[1:38:21] there was a beast and the Thunder a
[1:38:23] beast and a thunder beast and the
[1:38:24] thunder beats down through the ages said
[1:38:26] but when these seven thunders opened up
[1:38:27] he said it was all them little mysteries
[1:38:29] it was left down through the ages like I
[1:38:31] said first had a little mystery going to
[1:38:33] second second kind of mr. going to third
[1:38:35] but when them seven unknown Thunder
[1:38:37] sounded amen it was Christ Himself
[1:38:39] coming with the message to complete
[1:38:42] everything Christ Himself coming he was
[1:38:44] wigged a man was seven angels or seven
[1:38:47] unknown thunders from each age each
[1:38:49] mystery came with Christ so that he
[1:38:51] could reveal him and said each angel
[1:38:53] each night came into the room a man but
[1:38:55] when he got to that seventh one it
[1:38:57] wasn't William Brennan talking to
[1:38:58] William Branham amen it was you
[1:39:00] recognizing the very word of God was
[1:39:02] eagle food amen you let that other thing
[1:39:04] you said you've been heard from Yahtzee
[1:39:06] - that's what this message yet you're
[1:39:09] hearing from what you always watch you
[1:39:12] didn't become a son on any certain day
[1:39:14] you didn't receive eternal life of the
[1:39:16] altar you always were son always had
[1:39:19] eternal life
[1:39:20] you just had to recognize one day you
[1:39:22] was one of his Amen I was in him before
[1:39:25] the foundation in the world some I said
[1:39:26] but you don't remember it that's right I
[1:39:27] had spiritual amnesia but he wiped the
[1:39:29] amnesia away glory and now I recognize
[1:39:32] how I swathe an eagle never a chicken in
[1:39:35] the barrio a man in adoption

[1:42:31] your stand to be a preacher to be a
[1:42:33] prophet Oh hallelujah glory to God but

[1:44:22] much control over who we are I couldn't
[1:44:25] even have thought about him unless he
[1:44:26] was meditating upon me the very reason I

[1:45:11] that Paul spoke about there in Romans 9
[1:45:13] for about Israelite the Israelites
[1:45:15] pertained a natural adoption all the
[1:45:17] blending of that natural blends over

[1:45:22] Jordan Rama said the fullness of God
[1:45:24] poured into Jesus at the River Jordan
[1:45:26] he was anointing him for his service he
[1:45:28] was anointing him for his work three and

[1:46:21] understands his life nobody understands
[1:46:23] his nature like those that follow this
[1:46:25] last a message because that's what this
[1:46:27] message done for us this message

[1:46:45] me one man took him and broke him down
[1:46:46] to us and showed what Jesus really is a
[1:46:48] man down to what he loved and down to
[1:46:50] what he hated and when this virtue this
[1:46:53] character's we climb up jacob's ladder

[1:46:55] pyramid all that God was he poured in
[1:46:57] the crime all the Christ is he's pouring
[1:46:59] it into the church and then his nature
[1:47:02] is characteristic they have a ceremony
[1:47:05] when the son is being adopted st. John
[1:47:09] 14 drugs are the works that I do you're
[1:47:10] gonna do the same thing in first Timothy
[1:47:13] chapter 4 12 through 16 it said Lonette
[1:47:15] let no man despise thy youth but be an
[1:47:18] example to the believers the word he
[1:47:20] uses there for example as though a man
[1:47:22] was making a stroke or making a blow
[1:47:24] into a statute making a mark so he's
[1:47:27] leaving a mark in the lives of others
[1:47:30] but look how leaves it paul saying the
[1:47:32] same things that Peter was saying right
[1:47:34] here he said let him be an example to
[1:47:36] make a mark on believers in word
[1:47:38] conversation
[1:47:39] charity spirit faith and purity all the
[1:47:44] same virtues all the same
[1:47:45] characteristics Paul speaking like Peter
[1:47:47] speaking let that example live through
[1:47:50] your life let no man despise your youth
[1:47:52] hey man that's right amen let no man
[1:47:55] despise it let all of these things live
[1:47:57] in you verse 13 till i come give
[1:47:59] attendance to reading exhortation doctor
[1:48:01] the word attendance is to be addicted to
[1:48:02] it so Paul was telling Timothy become a
[1:48:06] Holy Ghost word fill junkie and don't
[1:48:09] never get delivered from one may feed on
[1:48:12] the word and for live for Christ and
[1:48:14] live for others become addicted to it a
[1:48:17] man when a son would come to his place
[1:48:19] of adoption the the the sword or the
[1:48:21] business or the seal all of that was
[1:48:23] handed over to him a man he could hire
[1:48:26] and he could fire a man in Psalm 1 David
[1:48:30] said he saw the tree David saw this
[1:48:33] bribed tree spoke about by the rivers of
[1:48:36] living water so it wasn't Jesus tree it
[1:48:38] was the bride tree she's being planted
[1:48:40] being planned how in Christ she's being
[1:48:43] planted in Christ the inexhaustible
[1:48:44] fountain of life to bring forth all of

[1:48:58] through the ground he said where's the
[1:49:00] Apple where's the bloom where's all that
[1:49:01] at he said it's already in that see when
[1:49:03] it was planted in the ground
[1:49:05] Amen I'm not looking for virtue to fall
[1:49:07] out of heaven and hit me in the
[1:49:08] it's already in me patience is already
[1:49:13] in me everything oh it's already settle
[1:49:22] down we got two services hey I'm excited
[1:49:26] I'm gonna have to quit first Peter 2
[1:49:29] verse 4 through 7 he tells us that we're
[1:49:33] a living stone tells us we're lively
[1:49:36] stones III don't want to quit but I got
[1:49:39] acquitted with time to go on
[1:49:40] he said we're built up a spiritual house
[1:49:43] and and and Jacob when he wakes up
[1:49:47] seeing this ladder from the earth that
[1:49:49] they have in but the rim set was
[1:49:50] anchored in Christ it's on Christ the
[1:49:52] solid rock I stand he said and then the
[1:49:55] latter was hooked to the throne of God
[1:49:57] and in souls in prison Bertram said he
[1:49:59] climbed up Jesus climbed up jacob's
[1:50:01] ladder climbed over the Father's throne
[1:50:03] and sat down on it remember Jesus isn't
[1:50:06] sitting on his own throne now he's
[1:50:08] sitting on his Father's throne in the
[1:50:09] Millennium he'll be sitting on his own
[1:50:11] throne but he's sitting on his Father's
[1:50:12] throne now but as he sits at the top of
[1:50:14] the ladder he's sitting there in the
[1:50:16] form of a pillar of fire amen that's his
[1:50:18] Father's throne the pillar of fire John
[1:50:20] sees in Revelation 4 when he looks on
[1:50:22] him like Jasper and Sauron Jasper's the
[1:50:24] first stone sauron's the last stone when
[1:50:26] they flashed together to make a yellow
[1:50:27] ambarish color John was looking at him
[1:50:30] on his Father's throne in the form of a
[1:50:31] pillar of fire it was the same image
[1:50:33] that Paul saw him on the road to
[1:50:35] Damascus Alleluia when he said he's
[1:50:41] sitting there at the top of the ladder
[1:50:43] what's he waiting for every son and
[1:50:44] daughter of God there's sin up through
[1:50:46] that ladder that characteristic I'm 7
[1:50:48] steps our virtue until they climb all
[1:50:50] the way at the top and who's up there

[1:50:53] waiting to approve your life because
[1:50:57] remember it always remember this never
[1:50:59] forget this it's not when you accept the
[1:51:01] Holy Ghost it's when the Holy Ghost

[1:52:35] thing one little thing after another we
[1:52:36] got to quit we got chicken food eating
[1:52:38] everything okay but whenever beater
[1:52:41] would take a piece of gold he said to
[1:52:43] have all kinds of dross and things he
[1:52:45] said he first look at the reflection of
[1:52:46] he couldn't see himself he said but he'd
[1:52:48] keep beating on that piece of gold
[1:52:50] beating on that piece of gold said
[1:52:51] eventually he'd work out all of the
[1:52:53] confusion and all of the misconceptions
[1:52:55] and all the all that kind of all the
[1:52:57] arrogance and all the temper and all the
[1:52:59] attitude and all he just keep beating on
[1:53:02] that thing said how did he know it was
[1:53:03] done when he could put it up in front of
[1:53:05] himself and see his perfect reflection
[1:53:06] I'm from Amen how do I know I've
[1:53:09] achieved that place where God's done
[1:53:11] beaten and working on me when he can see
[1:53:13] himself in my life when my faith is like
[1:53:16] his faith my virtues like his virtue
[1:53:17] knowledge temperance patience
[1:53:19] governments but the kind when all that's
[1:53:20] like him and he can see himself in me
[1:53:22] Amen he'll set the capstone down on and
[1:53:24] say this is my son
[1:53:29] amen let's stand again
[1:53:32] hey hey he's the Lord amen Romans 91
[1:53:37] Paul said my conscience bears me witness
[1:53:40] Hebrews 11:4 faith amen faith obtained
[1:53:44] by Abel he obtained a witness God
[1:53:48] testifying of his gifts and James 5 and
[1:53:52] 3 the Bible said that their gold and
[1:53:54] rust and silver and thing or their gold
[1:53:56] and silver rather be canker to the rust
[1:53:57] shall be a witness against them for
[1:53:59] loving their treasures and things first
[1:54:01] John 5 8 through 10 he said there's
[1:54:03] three that bear witness he said you see
[1:54:05] the witness of men but the witness of
[1:54:07] God is greater on and on on you takes
[1:54:09] third John one four through six the
[1:54:11] witness of I charity before the church
[1:54:13] revelation 1:5 Jesus is the faithful
[1:54:15] witnesses one of the faithful witness
[1:54:17] rather whenever we come together and
[1:54:19] we've come to the image of Jesus Christ
[1:54:22] and we're all coming into that same
[1:54:23] image by the preaching of the word we're
[1:54:25] all being shaped and formed into the
[1:54:27] image of Christ right now around the
[1:54:29] world
[1:54:29] amen it may be dark on the other side
[1:54:31] but in the morning time that we sit in
[1:54:33] the church service there'll be some
[1:54:35] little Holy Ghost preachers spitting all
[1:54:36] over the place and ugly as a wart hog
[1:54:38] but he'll be preaching truth clover to
[1:54:42] God he'll be telling people what let's
[1:54:43] say if the Lord is and it will shape
[1:54:45] them into the image of Christ and when
[1:54:47] we all come into that one great
[1:54:49] reflection and he looks into that gold
[1:54:51] and you can see my bride is just like me
[1:54:54] she has my faith my virtue my temperance
[1:54:56] my knowledge my this my that all of them
[1:54:58] things locked into the bride of Jesus
[1:55:00] Christ then the Lord from heaven from
[1:55:03] heaven remember Jacob sees him at the
[1:55:05] top of the ladder and as the Lord
[1:55:06] Himself a meant when he sees all that
[1:55:08] then the Lord Himself shod to sin and do
[1:55:10] what he'll descend down will rise up to
