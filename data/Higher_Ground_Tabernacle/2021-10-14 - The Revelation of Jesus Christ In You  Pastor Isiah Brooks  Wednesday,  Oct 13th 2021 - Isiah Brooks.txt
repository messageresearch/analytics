[Music] amen i just want to thank the lord amen for the opportunity to amen just to witness and to pray for people every day as i'm uh my job or my new job um requires me to go and visit with about

fourth chapter i stand amazed at the word of god that was preached the other night was wonderful sunday and and i'm still feasting off of that living bread one thing i love about it is it doesn't grow old you know if you chew on it it will expand it'll keep moving for you and so we're thanking god for uh the brother amen that did come out our brother richard and we pray that the lord continue to bless him he did receive get it he did go home and uh he landed safely so we thank god for that amen let's remember those who are in need of prayer don't forget about the obama family and our brother eugene and wife and everyone so just keep them in their prayers you know it takes a little time amen for things to kind of move for you you know so you know if you ever lost a dear loved one you know what it means you know i know what it means i've lost both mom and dad so i do understand there's no uh you know you can say oh you can empathize but you can't empathize unless you've been there right but you know my soul go out for him and his family god is good to us i'm excited because that was such a perfect song we appreciate our brother troy coming i he he pulled a little muscle or something and by the grace of god he came out anyway i appreciate the uh coming um you know i didn't know what to tell him i started to tell him to stay and you know i remember the last time i encouraged somebody to come out it was not so nice so i'm very careful about that especially when somebody is sick or in in trouble by god's grace ephesians 4 15 everybody there yeah i don't know what about 4 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen one more scripture let's go to first corinthians 13th chapter i believe that's correct oh god help us i trust everybody is doing well it really rained heavily last night yes first corinthians 13 and we're going to begin at the eighth verse we'll begin reading charity never faileth but whether there be prophecy they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spaked as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face amen now i know in part but then shall i know even as i am known amen and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity amen let us pray our heavenly father we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us because you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves lord i just want to just say thank you for your amazing grace thank you for your gift of love thank you for that love that so past surpasses all of our understanding lord i know that in my soul i desire to be just like you and i have confidence in your word because you said he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it amen by power it's not by light but it's by your holy spirit and we thank you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated we want to thank god for the word of god i want to take my time but not too long but i thought of the subject of building upon the revelation of jesus christ in you building upon the revelation of jesus christ in you one of the things that we must first realize is that who we are as individuals you must come to know that you're a bride amen not because somebody else says it to you but it's something that within you must speak to you and tell you who you really are amen you say what you mean speak to you remember when in the beginning uh when adam produced his female adam uh it was adam who told eve who she was she had no idea on who she really was and her relationship with him not only did he tell her who she was he said you're born in my bone and flesh of my flesh so you must understand the second adam who is jesus christ amen is alive and well and we must know that he the word must speak to you amen so that you'll know who you are amen we are the housing of god we are the new creation of god we have said it in so many ways paul said when i was a child i spake like a child i act like a child i did those childish things but now that the word of god has come and let me say it like this when throughout the church ages we were like children and brother branham and i his day he called the pentecostals pentecostal babies so they were just children and and then and they fought with each other they they did all kinds of things against each other they separated themselves they pouted against each other like children but now with the opening of the word with the seals broken and the headship of god come down we need to learn how to allow christ to be formed in us to mature in us to cause us to come into his very image and his likeness see we are here for a purpose amen hallelujah and the purpose is scripturally known it's not such a mystery that god is is hiding in some in any way because god has opened up the mystery of what his purpose is for us and if you understand the beginning of genesis you'll come to understand that it was always god's desire to multiply himself every seed shall bring forth of its kind amen so you and i must understand amen that the prayer that jesus prayed even in saint john 17. i'm just going to go there 17 john 17 22 quickly he prayed and he wanted to see the things that he came to know and to understand amen what the will of god was and is uh he knew that his seed was to come and and and he knew that because of his death barrier and resurrection they were going to come there was nothing now that could hinder god from moving into the heart and life of a human being anymore because remember in the old testament god could only anoint the flesh and the spirit but that's not where god resides god resides in the soul and when jesus came he conquered death hell and the grave and he brought back the prize he bought he he he paid the price excuse me for everything and now death has been stripped hell has been stripped the grave has been stripped and satan himself has been stripped he has no power over the seed of god hallelujah amen in saint john 17 22 i love saint john 17. it speaks directly to me and and i love reading this chapter over and over again i've always get something out of it i always get something out of it it says and the glory which thou gavet me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one praise god hallelujah i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me now that's a powerful love and i still think that often time when we think about the love of god we think of god that love on a human level instead of taking it to the agape love we keep it on the filio and filio love will always fail you it is not the perfect love there's only one perfect love this love says in that while you were yet sinners i died for you that's powerful hallelujah like i was telling my son the other day and i was going through saint john with him a little bit the fourth chapter i believe it was and i was telling him by way of the phone and i told him and i said listen if you've got the holy ghost if you're truly saved you shouldn't worry about your salvation amen at all because you didn't pay the price right he paid the price right i don't have to if i owe some money for rent and a brother came and paid my rent now i don't have to worry about the rent being paid i don't have to worry about being kicked out i don't have to worry about penalties because the rent was paid so has this the the sentence of sin it's been paid and that that that that that sentence was death in itself and jesus died for you the bible said he died for the ungodly amen oftentimes in this message we we forget the simplicity of these things and we find ourselves so burdened and down and depressed and whatever more and we we act as if there's something you can do we can do about our salvation and the prophet god told us this there's nothing you can do amen it's not even in your hands hallelujah amen it always happened in the in the hands of god sometimes the devil says oh you're a conqueror you're not a conqueror unless you've got the conqueror in you he's the mighty conqueror not you you just there or along for the ride is that all right and this is thing this is the thing building upon that you must faith in itself is the foundation everything that's in this world word you must apply faith to it yes amen amen hallelujah understand me because the bible tells us that we are the children of abraham's seed we are abraham's seeds excuse me we are the children of abraham which makes us abraham's seed and abraham was the father of faith amen a lot of times we we want this uh great gush of wind and uh or some whirlwind or some thunder and lightning or some chills up and down our body to signify we've got faith that's not even the way faith works first of all you can't feel faith faith is in the soul hallelujah y'all understand me faith is a revelation that you cannot even explain how can you explain that you're saved how can you explain that your sins have been washed away how can you explain even the holy ghost that you claim to have how can you explain it is unexplainable but you know it's more real than the seats that you're setting in amen [Music] nobody can take it from you because god gave it to you this is not a trial and error test this is something that god determined for you and me before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah the reason why we need the holy ghost is because as long as we got the holy ghost we are more than conquerors it's the truth the holy ghost in you is a conqueror the holy ghost in you amen is the one who destroys and defeat your enemy amen thank you amen hallelujah is that right brother branham the prophet of our day he says i'm waiting on him if brother branham was the conqueror he would have been able to do something he said i can't give you the holy ghost he says i can't heal you he said there's no such thing as a divine healer amen if a man can be a divine healer he's a divine savior he said i'm neither of that amen but he jesus christ i'm here to bear witness that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah i'm actually his forerunner i'm the guy who's telling you he's on his way listen and let me say it like this he's come yes amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a lot of times we look for god up here that's not where you're supposed to be looking he's in here he's behind the veil what is he doing behind the veil he's changing you it is a mystery but he's changing you from glory to glory y'all hear me not just a feeling it's a voice it's a word he talks he speaks he instructs he leads he guides he do all of those things to who how many times you you know the devil said that's your conscience how many times god is spoken hallelujah and he didn't speak from out there he spoke from in here hallelujah and when he speaks from in here that's god but we need to learn how to cultivate that amen see the more we die the more he lives hallelujah in matthew the 16th chapter you don't have to turn but i'm just going to quote the 18th verse here jesus was talking to his disciples and he asked them who do men say i the son of man am see they know what the son of man the son of man was a prophet that's what's another name for a prophet ezekiel son of man jeremiah the son of man that was another word or phrase for a prophet but he said who do you say this prophet is amen right in other words i'm different from jeremiah amen i'm different from all the other prophets and i need you to know who i am amen you need to know this revelation now let me say it like this if they need to know it then you need to know it now amen right this is what i love because jesus says in that day i'll be not only with you but i'll be in you come on amen amen hallelujah what are you saying brother in this day the revelation of jesus christ is being in house in a housing in what we call the bride he's in there why because in revelation the third chapter you open the door he said if you open the door unto me i will come into you and have suff suff with you i come in glory to god hallelujah is that all right and peter says thou out the christ you know because they all didn't know at that time but peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god what is and then jesus says i say unto you and today that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church that's why we need the prophet because some people thought that he was trying to build a church on peter it took a profit to give us understanding it was not peter it wasn't even a natural rock it was the revelation of who jesus christ was that's the content of the whole subject matter right and so we realized by god's grace he said upon this rock you need to hear this because we we quote the scriptures all the time upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it hallelujah meaning when you've got the holy ghost when you have the revelation of jesus christ in you no baptist no methodist no presbyter no gate hello no gate amen none of the gates will prevail against you no wickedness shall prevail against you you cannot be deceived amen you cannot that's true be deceived not because you can't be deceived but because the christ who wrote the word cannot be deceived he knows his it's the christ in you hallelujah is that all right so you must understand what was jesus doing because he said to simon but johnny he said flesh and blood have not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven so he takes it to another level they understand and yet they don't understand even when jesus says amen in saint john 10 30 when you see me you see the father see those who were counter-minded looked at a man's body and that's not what he was talking about he was working with character amen and then he was also working with the things that he had done because he said if you don't believe that i am he believe me for my very work the very works say you understand me so he was displaying the invisible god to them but he was the housing he was the literal housing of god there had been none like him amen none amen amen the bible said in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily and i love quoting that scripture because all that was in christ he poured it into the church amen is that right if he was a fullness of the godhead bodily then who is the bride amen if he poured it all nothing was left undone he finished the word amen hallelujah in the message invisible union he said but you remember when it went down and get began to excuse me you remember when it went down you talk about the grain i'm sorry when the grain began to ripen everything in the stock had to be dead hallelujah can you see where we're standing now what is he working with he's calling something stalk amen now if the bride or the life has moved out of laodicea lay of the seal has become stalked come on it's nothing but the truth every age became tap stop whatever you want to call it the remains were left to be burned yes amen but the life kept moving you understand me this is what i'm trying to say we must mature into the life the life is not something that we have in our head it is it is it's an expression it is god himself we must move into that life where god is living amen in our housing amen if it's just theology you're missing it if it's just what phrases that we use for what we call the message you're missing it the purpose of christ's death barrier and resurrection was to bring forth his own kind amen amen the seed planted in the ground he came up right and on the day of pentecost what happened there and then god began to multiply himself amen and the devil came inhabited so it could never produce a real thing but in the last day amen he the alpha became the obey mega man the original she was planted again amen that's the truth yes it is right you have you had three c's in this day preached three planted that's what the prophet said billy graham oral roberts and william branham amen right and these are the seeds that are now being harvested amen amen you understand me so you say well what do you mean this is why you could not be attracted this is why it could not hold you this is why amen this message caught your attention because that's where you came from [Applause] hallelujah what is it just exactly the same he said what the same grain that went into the ground the same jesus in dry form amen same power same church same thing same word you understand me so if you get if you don't have the same power see because a lot of times when you got power or are you seeing the supernatural oftentimes people say that's pentecostal well you better have it [Music] right if you can't believe in healing you surely can't believe in resurrection because you can't be that's the greatest healing god is going to ever do amen is that right you've got to have the same it must be the same power the same church the same thing the same word it must produce the same thing yes sir amen hallelujah let me say it like this and something the holy spirit spoke to my heart today when a man goes around and he does the same thing over and over and over again and expect a different result you call that what insanity if you are doing the same thing over and over and over and over again and you expect a different result come on something's not right the only way that can ever change is that you must bring a change and only god can bring the change somehow you've got to look within yourself this is why the bible says examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith folks that must be done on the daily basis yes sir hallelujah confession is done on a daily basis father forgive me on a daily basis lord i'm sorry on a daily basis hallelujah and the bible said if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness but this is a daily process we'll keep doing this until we reach our goals amen hallelujah and that's what's wrong with some people they have the word in their head and they think they've arrived but let me tell you something you not you having a ride amen until this world is living it must live through you [Music] hallelujah who i feel so good up here same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here see and all that life that comes through here picks up its people that's right light picked you up you didn't choose it it picked you up right something's happening and the prophet of god is not using those words for naught the bible says amen that we are now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus so the word doesn't leave you earthbound it picks you up and places you into another dimension oh come on somebody and that's the problem many of us are still living in the fourth dimension when god is trying to get us elevated to live in the sixth dimension hallelujah where eternal life is you don't believe me but jesus said it like this how can the son of man be on earth in heaven at the same time amen hallelujah how can you be on earth and in heaven at the same time you are because you have a theophany hallelujah and that theophany is in the sixth dimension this is what picked you up and one of these old days you're going to have a final pick up but we must press it's not an easy journey you and i must press into it we fall down but we get up amen praise the lord you know the word god is coming folks the bible said a just man fought seven times in a day and get up hallelujah you love the lord so we find out by god's grace he says now it's forming up into a head for what the rapture speaking on tomorrow night he says you know see well you separate well you separated from your first union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not of your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you aren't you glad to be found amazing grace now your old book is gone that's right and when the devil tried to bring your pastor you tell him that's gone what i used to be is gone hallelujah even if i make mistakes now it's gone did you know that amen the prophet god tells us that the justification in the word is it's it's though you've never seen in the first place grace is guilty mercy is guilty excuse me mercy is guilty because you're caught and you found in your judge and you need some mercy but mercy plays not in this the headstone came down calling grace grace and that's unmerited love and favor for you you mean to tell me god loves me that much that he's had to say twice yes hallelujah amen yes sir now your name is in your own it has been transferred oh book now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book god put it in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before god if that's not a black eye for the devil what is it but we must learn y'all hear what i'm saying we must grow into or build upon the revelation of jesus christ amen what was i reading to you the revelation of jesus christ in your life amen and if you can take this into your heart you'll understand that in him there is no darkness hallelujah in him there is no darkness amen y'all understand what i'm saying if you are in him the blood of jesus christ has washed you clean you sanctified you justified you and put a lot of grace over you so there is nothing to be seen there's nothing to be seen it's hard to understand but he didn't say understand it he said have faith if you're going to conquer the devil of this age you got to believe this put on the whole arm of god the helmet of what faith the shield of faith right the heaven of salvation amen shield of faith in the heaven of salvation amen is already done amen we say oh brother brooks is all listen now if you truly believe this it doesn't mean it's not going to give you leeway to go out there and say well i know i'm already saved so i can do what i want to do no no no no every true believer every true born again christian they do their best to live right before god amen amen and when they make mistakes they say god forgive me amen that's right this is why god could justify you because he knew your heart response before you would respond is that right he said i know your thoughts are far off hallelujah now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life hallelujah what the lamb redeemed oh my not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the land book of life your marriage certificate what are you saying brother amen what are you saying there's not a there's been an invisible union because i'm married i'm not only the bride of christ but i'm the wife of christ hallelujah he's changed my position hallelujah he's changed your position amen hallelujah your new life is in the land book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold your eternal germ takes hope does it have a hold of you yes sir amen it has a hole in you hallelujah you can't let it go because it won't let you go you can't turn loose cut he won't turn you loose hey brother yes sir i'm glad he won't turn me a loose hallelujah yeah he can he said i'm engraved in the palms of his hand glory to god i mean deeper than that i'm written on his heart is that right amen that's right he's written on mine if you would open me up you'll see the lord jesus christ written on my hallelujah that's ownership right that's ownership he owns my heart he owns your heart right hallelujah is that all right now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory amen romans 5 1 says yeah romans 5 1 says amen therefore justified by faith and brother brown and break it down he says you didn't do it in the first place oh praise the lord this is why the devil fights the whole holy ghost he fights it he fights people getting it he don't mind you being sanctified but he don't want that soul to be quickened amen and we don't have to do the all of the emotional things though emotional things may come i mean you know what i'm trying to say when the word strikes that soul it changes you you don't change it yourself it change you your desire changes it's like a woman when she gets pregnated her desire for the food that she once uh did eat it doesn't excite her anymore she wants something new and something different and that's how it is with those who are truly born again you want this message yes you want to eat this how many how many all remember we may have slowed down on it a little bit but when we first got it boy did we eat oh we stayed up all type time of the night three or four o'clock in the night talking about the words hallelujah we didn't care about rest we didn't even care about working we didn't care about going to school we went to school all refreshed because of what he was doing for us inside that same god cannot die and you it can't be aborted it's real y'all love the lord now listen what what the prophet god says here i have heard but now i see he said blessed old baptism of the holy ghost to guide us up this marvelous old highway oh how glorious it is how could i ever be ashamed of it i stand with saint paul this morning saying this i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation it's the power over sickness it's power over death it's power over the grave and when those stern death and and when the when the stern death it's the power over the grave see and when the stern death of old apostle came to his end of his road excuse me when the stern old apostle came to the end of his road and they dug his grave out there and death was facing him in the face he laughed in the face of it y'all understand me this holy ghost will make you laugh in the face of death when you know you really got it amen y'all understand me you're not afraid of him anymore when you know you really got it no matter if cancer gets you no matter whatever comes amen because that's what the devil is going to uh a place of fear on the people now you you y'all think it was bad when corona hit but wait till this thing start locking down and see how fear will grow up fear will become so enlarged now we know that's what's happening now the bible said men's hearts are failing for fear even now people jumping out of windows committing suicide and everything else because of what's coming on the earth but we don't fear no sir we know it's going home time this is the time of our exodus yeah it doesn't mean it's going to be easy hallelujah but neither is giving birth to a baby but you know at the end of the day you got your baby you understand hallelujah and right now we're birthing we're going into something and and we can already already you know see the cramps and you know how that comes hallelujah he laughed in the face of it he said death where is your sting grave where is your victory then he shouted the praise of god but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen now i say this because i think it was bob's worth what did bosworth the one there was they were singing all those sad songs he said hey give me some snappy something who dying me or you see you know he was excited for this purpose i lived this life for this end because this is not the end this is my beginning that's why that's why paul laughed at death he understood it wasn't his end this was his beginning this is what i've been preaching for suffering for desiring to leave and could not leave now it's my time jesus right the mighty conqueror that ever lived that's right he was the mighty conqueror that ever died for he was the only one who could conquer die and conquer death itself and rise again in triumph he proved this is where i'm going he proved what he was it was the last seal of his messiahship what are you talking about he is that that was that's what proved him that was the last seal and remember he was the seventh seal of his days jesus and he broke that seal what we call the easter seal remember seven is completion hallelujah and he broke that seal hallelujah went down into the grave that the devil had only known if he knew y'all better hear what i'm saying because we give the devil too much power amen we give him stuff that he doesn't deserve amen he's stripped we must realize he's stripped yes oftentimes we don't get things that we desire to have because we're looking at god like he's a million miles away and he says i'm not there you you're off the word when you think he's a million miles away he said i'm i'm not there in that day you'll know that i'm in the father of the fathers in me and i'm in you i'm on the throne of your heart so how do you connect with him by way of prayer submitting yourself to him amen amen this sounds crazy but it's true anyhow but jesus when he went to pray he says father i wouldn't this cup pass from me but understand brother bannon tells us he said it was right at that time jesus of the father separated himself because he became sin that's right and and god can't handle sin he can't be in the presence of sin so he became sin for us that we might become what he's righteous now so for the first time he's separated he says you know my god my god why hast thou forsaken me you and i can't imagine what that feeling was like because he never experienced it before he was always there he never sinned so it never broke the communion the fellowship but now here was something that that that was already written in the psalms he was going to say but this now has become a revelation of being rejected y'all understand me that's why you cannot be rejected by god because he was rejected for you he took his your sin so when the devil tried to make you feel reject him you he's a liar he christ paid for that amen hallelujah and the devil like to work with our feelings try to make us feel like we're not saved and try to make us feel like we're hypocrites and try to make us feel like all kinds of stuff that's not godly and he's a liar amen you need to put the holy ghost home hallelujah is that all right his messiahship and then the prophet god says when the holy ghost comes into you you are little messiahs so somewhere you've conquered something too huh you're no longer dead but you're alive your resurrection when god gave you the holy ghost you defeated death amen did y'all know that you defeated death when god gives you the holy oath that means you died to yourself and god comes in and he's living and that's why he said you cannot die again amen you can't hold your your body down hallelujah is this okay let me hurry because uh let me hurry second corinthians says now thanks be to god which always causes us to triumph in christ in you christ in you christ causes you to triumph right and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place that means we can be winners wherever we go triumph wherever we go god is is that right oftentimes we you see i see it i see it clearly we don't acknowledge the lord in all of our ways he said if you acknowledge me in all of your ways he then will direct your past but we don't do that oftentimes instead of being the body we try to be the head and as long as as long as you allow yourself to be the head of your life you're going to keep bumping up into things because you have no eyes to see he has the eyes all right let's move on amen save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy place hallelujah now here's the great triumph the manifestation of his messiahship when he took the book out of the right right hand of him that sat upon the throne no man could take it we know that's been in our day right and so we know that not only was he supposed to take the book but the bride how did she become righteous enough to take the book is that right because when the angel told john take the book john represented the bride amen hallelujah and the only reason why she could take the book is because jesus christ her husband paid the price so that the life that was once with adam can now return to the bride of jesus christ which was the holy spirit and his protection amen see that's what this oh god if we could see it that's what this message does it not only protects you it matures you it is that wall of fire about you it is the living god hidden in such a way that only the bride of jesus christ knows what it is think about it we're now eating manna that once was veiled and the only high priest could could actually eat of it but now amen is veiled again but in human flesh hallelujah and what is he doing now he's changing us from glory to glory to glory and we need to allow him to do so when god said don't do it don't do it when god said don't go don't go amen amen y'all know amen hallelujah and he took that little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth this is what john said sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter in other words i didn't pick and choose any of the word that's right i ate it all up like israel's what was was uh commanded to do with the paschal land eat it all up right you love the lord amen i know i've been here for a while but i'm gonna cut it short i'm gonna cut it short because i know this is wednesday night but i will read this quote before i let you go see say this this is an ongoing thing it is an everyday thing now i don't know about you sometimes i i wake up in the morning and i don't have the right attitude sometimes my attitude is like oh no i got to go through this again y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but it's the truth but you i have to re i have to adjust that that spirit i have to adjust that that's that's before i get on my knees y'all understand me i have to adjust that anointing because if you don't adjust that spirit you go through a whole day with that attitude and that means you're going to have a bad day you got to wash yourself from that devil's thought because that's the thought the devil gave you wash yourself and realize i'm bright devil you better know it i'm up now you got to work some faith in there you got to let the devil know i'm i'm awake now and jesus is in the inside of me and you know you got to preach the word to the devil to have a good day have a good day i'm going to have a good day but i'm gonna make the devil's day miserable right hallelujah he come with that nonsense and you gotta readjust that you gotta change it because otherwise your whole day was gonna go bad amen i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his course with praise and you do that on your knees hallelujah i think the church has been preached to death brother says in jehovah jireh the thing it needs now is to come back to teaching and get it on the foundation so you'll know how to build yourself up in christ and we built our churches upon sensations and upon the different things but can't build upon nothing but christ that's the only way you can build you've got to build on christ the revelation of jesus christ that's the only thing that we could do in him you are complete without him you're lost and there's not a way in the world for you to be saved see that's the building him in you word upon word lying upon line precept upon precepts you've got to realize that you are dead you're no good at all you're filthy and god's the only one can help you that's right see now if you think you got some goodness about you you ain't dead yet you know sometimes people think oh when i come to church i yeah i can i can make it happen you can't make nothing happen i don't care if you've been a virgin all your life you're still filthy remember whether you be man or woman you still filthy you were born in sin that's right and let me tell you something because of those things you still have evil thoughts that don't stop evil thoughts like i try to tell people i say you could be a monk go into the highest mountain on top of us and guess what sin gonna find you why because you brought it there you took it there it's with you sin is in the flesh unbelievers in the flesh you got to kill it listen he said that's right when you do that then you're getting close to the kingdom of god when you reckon yourself nothing and just solemnly uh depend on him and let the holy spirit lead you amen hallelujah one more but see there's not a thing that you can do to save yourself there's not one thing you've got to solemnly trust on the grace of god to do it you can't save yourself i don't care how religious you are and how good you try to be and keep all the commandments and everything that won't do one thing there's not one thing you can do to merit anything you're just simply lost and that's all to it there's not a way for you you have to accept his provided method that's jesus christ and it's freely see you don't have to do one thing but just accept what's been given to you not not a thing you can do see that's why i'm preaching because oftentimes we think that all that i preached i'm sure the mind have thought to itself what could i do i'll tell you what it what you can do repeat amen that's all you can do that's one thing you have to do see if you're going to see christ begin to grow you've got to acknowledge everything you do wrong and make it right amen you have to and i don't mean you got to tell the public it's between you and god when you go into your secret cards the closet the bible says god will reward you openly it's about you it's a love affair god's going to have with you and let me tell you like this in closing the one person that is most difficult to tell on is yourself that's the truth there have been things in my mind at times i almost stutter when i'm praying because it's hard to get out but the only way to get rid of it is to get it out your confession it didn't say the way you think uh out of this mouth let's stand i'll finish this i'm not completely finished because it's something that we must lock into everything the word of god says we are that's what we are right and if you don't have faith to grab onto it you just say lord help me and take away the unbelief god sees you and he knows you better than you know yourself and he knows how to remedy everything that you need to be taken care of that needs to be taken care of i'm gracious i'm grateful uh to to to be in this message or to be able to hear the voice of malachi 4 to know that that was not just a man but the voice of god and to be able to accept the things that are being preached to me by way of the tapes and by way of ministers who who have studied and brought uh the word um you know i i just i've learned so much and and even the like i said the message that would preach sunday it will never lead me satan can never defeat me again in the time of silence amen because i know that doesn't mean he's not dead and often times have we asked god and we've gotten frustrated with things and yet god doesn't answer because sometimes we think we're the head you know like the brothers say god i ask you this today and i want it tomorrow but in his time he makes all things beautiful oh praise the lord god is so good let's have a word of prayer oh gracious father my heart just feel like it's been exercised [Music] i thank you for the word of god the word of words of faith you've spoken to our hearts and our minds today you're allowing us to see that [Music] there's a process and in this process you are the master builders but in order to build this house into perfection you need us to take our hands off of the project of the building father you said you were completed you said not one of your words would come back void amen and you said oh god because we see and believe this message that that eternal germ picked us up it caught us and all we're asking now is lord show us the way may we walk in the spirit lord in this day forward do our best to keep your word and also lord may we commune with you may we talk with you may we we acknowledge you in all our ways not some but all so that you can direct us on the things that we need to do so we could stay in alignment with your father granted father god to everyone that came tonight and blessed those that were able to listen in uh uh we pray that somehow you do a work in their lives father i see the changes that's occurring in me and father i thank you because all i desire is to see your perfect love manifested in me we have been talking about it we have been we have been preached to about it but i really believe with all my heart this is manifesting time the harvest is right and i believe father the sickle is about to be thrust into amen bring us to that perfection that was in your mind bring us to that beauty that was in your mind before the foundation of the world and father we'd like to say we yield we yield we yield to your will
