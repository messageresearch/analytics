[44:42] he that believeth in me though he were
[44:45] dead yet shall he lives

[45:12] let us pray

[45:18] thank you for your blessings
[45:21] we thank you Lord because you are
[45:52] in US we pray that you would cleanse it
[45:55] is
[46:02] [Music]
[46:14] you you may be seated
[46:24] I like to entitle
[46:28] this message
[46:30] the next connection the connection
[46:35] and I know that sounds pretty strange
[46:39] but you must realize that that God works
[46:43] in that way
[46:46] there's really no void in God
[46:50] everything is connected
[46:53] in what we call this space in time
[46:58] it may seem like God works
[47:06] [Music]
[47:10] but you must realize that only in this
[47:13] dimension
[47:20] it's a quick thing
[47:22] it's like a thought
[47:25] it happens
[47:28] but with God he must do something
[47:32] he breaks things down in segments
[47:37] so that we can understand
[47:40] him
[47:43] uh God even worked with what we call
[47:46] dispensations
[47:49] when he uh uh changes himself
[47:55] his mask
[47:57] so massacre but we want you to
[47:59] understand
[48:01] his character never changed so God tell
[48:04] me
[48:06] for example for example when when Moses
[48:11] was delivering the children of Israel
[48:15] from Egypt
[48:18] there came water from The Rock he is
[48:23] and even though that water
[48:26] was in a chemistry formula
[48:30] Jesus in the New Testament Jesus tells
[48:34] us that he was that water
[48:37] when Moses smoked the rock
[48:42] even when he spoke to the Rock
[48:45] Jesus then said
[48:48] in the New Testament he was that rock
[48:52] hallelujah amen when the Manna From
[48:55] Heaven
[48:57] hell from in in in the company
[49:03] of Israel
[49:09] they didn't know what it was
[49:12] they don't know what it is
[49:15] Jesus in the New Testament
[49:26] because in Hebrews 13 and 8.
[49:31] Jesus says I
[49:33] am the same today
[49:38] I am the same as I was yesterday
[49:42] and I will be the same forevermore
[49:46] he is a God that does not change
[49:50] God doesn't make mistakes
[49:54] he's the only person
[49:57] that I know I never needed an eraser
[50:02] because he's
[50:06] and I say
[50:09] so that you can understand
[50:12] that God did not make a mistake
[50:16] when he chose you
[50:19] was his only choice
[50:23] there's none like you
[50:26] you are unique in your makeup
[50:31] you are unique in your character and
[50:36] there is none like you know nobody can
[50:40] take your place
[50:42] but God needs
[50:44] in this connection
[50:48] oh man
[50:50] when we think about the universe
[50:53] everything looks like it's floating in
[50:57] space
[50:59] because we can't see
[51:02] the connection
[51:04] it is a spiritual thing it is a
[51:08] supernatural thing
[51:09] the sun can't rise
[51:14] hallelujah amen until the moon sets
[51:18] [Music]
[51:19] and the moon cannot rise
[51:23] until the sun says
[51:27] [Music]
[51:29] it seems like they're not connected
[51:34] it's what
[51:57] [Music]
[52:25] [Music]
[52:33] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[53:00] they are all connected
[53:03] God is a family man
[53:08] you must understand a family is a unit
[53:12] they are connected
[53:15] by Blood
[53:17] somebody help me here
[53:19] think about this easy
[53:21] how that God
[53:23] chose a seed monster to show that he is
[53:29] the resurrection
[53:31] a little seed in pretty much the God
[53:35] planted by the spoken word
[53:39] there were seeds
[53:42] every seed brought forth its kind
[53:46] but as long as the seed was in the
[53:49] ground
[53:52] as long as it was under the water it
[53:55] could not produce what God wanted it to
[53:57] produce then God began to put everything
[54:01] in order
[54:02] to separate things
[54:12] somebody help me here man see that is
[54:15] the thing is like what we used to be
[54:20] we were like
[54:33] [Music]
[54:46] we had no idea
[54:49] we were connected
[54:51] [Music]
[54:53] to the sun somebody help me here
[54:57] because nothing could bring life to you
[55:00] doctors could not bring life to you
[55:02] Hallelujah
[55:05] it takes the sun
[55:08] because the sun is
[55:11] a type of the Resurrection
[55:14] y'all hear me the sun was set in order
[55:18] so that even those who remembers who
[55:22] could not read all right
[55:28] Divinity Hallelujah we don't have three
[55:31] sons
[55:43] [Music]
[55:52] is Everlasting
[55:56] Hallelujah
[55:58] you understand me I'm coming by God's
[56:01] grace
[56:04] the message expression
[56:06] the problem God says it like this
[56:09] when the sun begins to bathe the Earth
[56:14] you can't hold it
[56:18] or you can't hold life
[56:39] monster
[57:06] [Music]
[57:33] the Su is the s-u-n is the resurrection
[57:38] of all botany life
[57:43] you can't hide it
[57:46] as as long as the sun shines
[57:51] amen I've seen it I've seen little
[57:55] blades of grass
[57:56] [Music]
[57:58] push its way deep through the concrete
[58:05] it doesn't matter
[58:07] how dark your situation is
[58:14] [Music]
[58:19] strike the seed
[58:39] and even his disciples
[58:42] who had followed him for years
[59:00] [Music]
[59:09] you know he had his own uh understanding
[59:13] of what people were saying Jesus Christ
[59:18] but then Jesus said unto him
[59:21] Hallelujah who do you say I am
[59:27] that's what he asking you this morning
[59:33] because the voice of God still lives
[59:37] he still speaks Hallelujah and he still
[59:40] creates
[59:41] Hallelujah he's moving this morning
[59:45] he need for you to answer
[59:48] who do you say
[59:52] who do you say this message is
[59:56] hallelujah amen oh it's not the words of
[59:59] a man it's the words of God but who do
[1:00:02] you say he is
[1:00:07] the son of the Living God you're not
[1:00:10] just a prophet your God manifested In
[1:00:13] the Flesh
[1:00:15] you're the human manifestation of the
[1:00:19] invisible God we call Elohim somebody
[1:00:23] help me here that was the deepest
[1:00:25] Revelation
[1:00:26] that healer could have received at that
[1:00:30] moment Hallelujah but God told him
[1:00:34] there's coming another day Peter
[1:00:37] approaches that the same
[1:00:52] he will not be with you but he will be
[1:00:55] in you
[1:00:56] Hallelujah
[1:01:06] is that right that's why the problem
[1:01:09] that God tells us
[1:01:11] he's just not being justification
[1:01:14] it's not enough
[1:01:16] sanctification is not enough oh I got
[1:01:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:22] hallelujah what God wants in you is to
[1:01:26] form his life into you
[1:01:29] foreign
[1:01:45] somebody help me this morning even Jesus
[1:01:49] prayed amen Jesus father I want the baby
[1:01:52] one even as we are one Hallelujah is
[1:01:56] that right Jesus told us that God loves
[1:02:00] us even as he loved him and that the
[1:02:04] love of God loved us before the
[1:02:06] foundation of the world I don't know
[1:02:09] what you're talking about this morning
[1:02:10] but I'm trying to tell you
[1:02:13] Christianity is not being associated
[1:02:16] with the church or an organization
[1:02:21] that's like a club that's a common Club
[1:02:23] it could be a lot
[1:02:26] Christianity like Lucas you must make a
[1:02:29] connection
[1:02:30] or the son himself
[1:02:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:47] there's no there's nothing you can do
[1:02:50] you can't stop it foreign
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:31] when Mary and Martha when they were
[1:03:35] there at the Garden Hallelujah
[1:03:39] Jesus told them one thing
[1:03:42] he didn't say we are the resurrection
[1:03:48] he said I am
[1:03:50] Hallelujah
[1:03:52] I don't need a group
[1:03:55] Hallelujah I don't need a a helping hand
[1:03:58] somebody help me he said
[1:04:01] come on somebody that means
[1:04:06] the resurrection in other words
[1:04:09] everything you see and everything you
[1:04:14] will see
[1:04:15] will come only
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] hallelujah amen is that all right he
[1:04:24] said why
[1:04:26] see the gospel before he like live on
[1:04:28] Jesus has been preached I depreciate
[1:04:31] what is the problem
[1:04:34] with the people
[1:04:37] there's power
[1:04:40] there is no greater message
[1:04:45] outside of the Gospel
[1:04:48] you can preach about predestination
[1:04:51] you can speak about elections
[1:04:54] Hallelujah but when you take the man to
[1:04:57] Calvary
[1:05:00] because predestination can't work
[1:05:04] until Calvary juice
[1:05:18] there were Saints of old
[1:05:21] you had Moses
[1:05:24] when they died
[1:05:26] they were still in what we call
[1:05:30] a place of captivity
[1:05:34] we call it Paradise
[1:05:37] it was better than hell it is better
[1:05:41] than the region of the law
[1:05:43] but you still must understand
[1:05:45] they were still captive
[1:05:48] Hallelujah
[1:05:50] but they was elected they were chosen
[1:05:54] they did Mighty works on the Earth
[1:05:58] but still they were captive
[1:06:00] Hallelujah why because without the shed
[1:06:04] of your blood
[1:06:05] there is no remission of sins
[1:06:11] to release the prison doors
[1:06:17] to unlock the prison doors
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:24] to release you from prison
[1:06:33] but but the gospel it can't work
[1:06:38] it will not work
[1:06:41] until you accept it
[1:06:44] oh come on somebody you gotta understand
[1:06:47] this
[1:06:48] you and I pray
[1:06:50] and prayer is good look what the prophet
[1:06:54] of God says
[1:06:55] glorify Jesus
[1:07:03] keep it up companies I think it's a good
[1:07:06] thing
[1:07:07] come out there and pour your heart out
[1:07:10] before God is
[1:07:12] the way to do it
[1:07:15] but really man that isn't what saves you
[1:07:20] you can stay there at the altar
[1:07:24] pray all night long
[1:07:28] walk up and down the
[1:07:33] altario you could do every Penance you
[1:07:36] could
[1:07:37] you can sell everything you got
[1:07:41] and give to the poor
[1:07:44] you can go on a fast for 40 days
[1:07:48] and get so out from fasting till you
[1:07:51] just couldn't walk
[1:07:55] and never do you any good
[1:07:59] until first
[1:08:01] I'm gonna say that again
[1:08:22] and when you believe it
[1:08:25] that settles it forever
[1:08:27] I believe the message
[1:08:29] but it's not enough just to say I
[1:08:32] believe it with your head it must be
[1:08:35] believed with your heart and out of the
[1:08:39] abundance of the heart the mouth will
[1:08:42] speak you understand me
[1:08:46] foreign
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:17] Hallelujah and sometimes selfish
[1:09:27] but God is looking for somebody who
[1:09:32] would die
[1:09:34] to their will
[1:09:37] we need the connection right now
[1:09:40] see the world falling apart but we need
[1:09:43] a connection
[1:09:44] she gotta bring a connection
[1:09:47] if you look for it it's already here oh
[1:09:51] let me back it up a little bit you and I
[1:09:54] must understand
[1:09:55] Jesus is here right now
[1:09:59] amen his spirit is here right now what
[1:10:02] you're feeling is the spirit of Christ
[1:10:06] he's in this room right now
[1:10:09] oh Lord send your power just now he's
[1:10:12] here his power is here he's in a
[1:10:16] different dimension you can't see him
[1:10:18] but he's here and then God gives you the
[1:10:22] Holy Ghost
[1:10:23] so that you can feel him sometimes
[1:10:27] foreign
[1:10:41] this morning
[1:10:44] as far as returning
[1:10:46] we talk about the returning of Jesus
[1:10:50] but he's also is here
[1:10:54] you know the world don't understand it
[1:10:57] but it's like radio waves
[1:11:00] the radio waves are here but you can't
[1:11:04] see them
[1:11:05] the television waves are here but you
[1:11:10] need the right channel that's what it is
[1:11:13] and when we come to church we should
[1:11:17] come to China
[1:11:20] that Dimension
[1:11:23] it comes by meditating sometimes
[1:11:27] Hallelujah keeping your mind stead on
[1:11:30] him
[1:11:31] he said if you keep your mind stead on
[1:11:34] me I will grant you perfect peace
[1:11:42] see that is it had to become visible
[1:11:47] how many times the prophet of God would
[1:11:50] say
[1:11:54] and everybody's looking around without
[1:11:56] me
[1:11:58] but there were those who could see him
[1:12:03] some people say well I saw Jesus
[1:12:05] some said I saw the pillars
[1:12:09] many have said I've seen angels
[1:12:14] it seems like that natural Veil
[1:12:19] move back and then the spiritual steps
[1:12:23] in one spiritual and this is an
[1:12:26] individual thing it's not a group thing
[1:12:29] it's an individual thing that we begin
[1:12:32] to see Christ
[1:12:38] we're getting ready to embrace the
[1:12:40] resurrection
[1:12:44] will be able to see the resurrection
[1:12:48] they'll walk right by you and if your
[1:12:52] eyes are not eyes you see you won't see
[1:12:55] them
[1:13:21] he was always there
[1:13:29] you love the Lord
[1:13:33] hey
[1:13:35] you and I must know that he's already
[1:13:37] here
[1:13:38] you see
[1:13:40] now today
[1:13:42] just imagine his presence
[1:13:45] being here today as I said
[1:13:48] the Lord Jesus is in another world
[1:13:52] he's in another world
[1:13:54] and that's what we must understand you
[1:13:57] can't live in Two Worlds at the same
[1:13:59] time
[1:14:02] you're going to either live in this
[1:14:04] world
[1:14:05] are you going to live in the world that
[1:14:07] cannot be seen that's why the Bible says
[1:14:10] set your affection on things above
[1:14:15] set your affection on things above not
[1:14:19] on the earth this is not our world if we
[1:14:22] are back to this world
[1:14:24] at least we're supposed to be help me
[1:14:27] Lord hallelujah
[1:14:29] right imagine
[1:14:31] his presence being here today
[1:14:35] the Lord Jesus is in another world
[1:14:38] or another Dimensions right here today
[1:14:42] in form of the spirit
[1:14:45] is blending
[1:14:48] in with our spirit
[1:14:59] you not only want to heal here
[1:15:02] but you want to feel him and the only
[1:15:05] way you can feel him is that you allow
[1:15:08] your spirit amen to blend in with the
[1:15:12] spirit
[1:15:14] I don't believe that
[1:15:16] I don't like what he's preaching you're
[1:15:19] shutting God out
[1:15:21] because if it's God's word and you
[1:15:25] rejecting his word you are rejecting him
[1:15:29] Hallelujah that's why some people can't
[1:15:33] get the Holy Ghost sitting right in the
[1:15:35] service
[1:15:36] Hallelujah why because the preaching of
[1:15:38] the words and then they allowed
[1:15:41] themselves they hear the word not with
[1:15:44] just the ears but the spiritual ears
[1:15:49] see that's how you know you're saying
[1:15:52] when your spiritual Hearts
[1:15:57] that's your intellect not your reasoning
[1:16:01] Hallelujah something let you know
[1:16:05] it's done it's finished Hallelujah you
[1:16:09] love the Lord man
[1:16:11] Hallelujah see our eyes can't see him
[1:16:15] because that they are physical yet
[1:16:19] unless
[1:16:22] there would something happen I'm
[1:16:25] wondering that we could see this Vision
[1:16:28] Hallelujah but he is here just as
[1:16:31] visible
[1:16:33] just as real real as he was the day
[1:16:38] that he spoke to Mary
[1:16:43] see a lot of times we want to put God in
[1:16:45] history
[1:16:49] God is soon to come but God is a right
[1:16:53] now God I'm trying to bring something to
[1:16:56] you this morning
[1:16:58] to be disconnected
[1:17:01] and when you fall in sin the first thing
[1:17:06] you do
[1:17:07] restore the connection
[1:17:09] father
[1:17:11] cleanse me
[1:17:19] because when God said come up here
[1:17:23] and you're not connected
[1:18:12] if this life separates
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:48] it doesn't matter
[1:18:52] if all you got left of yourself
[1:18:58] God will make it come back to itself
[1:19:01] Hallelujah you're not going to come back
[1:19:05] with something different
[1:19:07] you're going to come back with the same
[1:19:11] nose
[1:19:12] the same eyes the same here
[1:19:16] but better
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:53] because I know he's in the building I
[1:19:56] know he's in the house but most of all
[1:19:59] is in me he's in you Hallelujah and that
[1:20:02] soul is magnetized it's a connection
[1:20:08] to be a Christian I don't know what to
[1:20:10] do there's no way as a Christian you can
[1:20:15] fail Hallelujah because we are accepted
[1:20:31] because every one of your mistakes have
[1:20:34] been thrown into the sea of
[1:20:35] forgetfulness God can't see you he hears
[1:20:40] your voice
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:42] when he looking at a Christian it's the
[1:20:44] righteousness of your son Jesus Christ
[1:20:47] he became our sin that we might become
[1:20:51] the righteousness of God
[1:20:52] hallelujah amen and the devil says
[1:20:56] you're just a hypocrite you need to
[1:20:59] preach back to the devil I should never
[1:21:02] be a hypocrite because my life is here
[1:21:07] this morning
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:16] as long as I'm in Christ I'm Sanctified
[1:21:19] as long as I'm in Christ Hallelujah I
[1:21:24] made whole
[1:21:25] what you looking at devil
[1:21:28] the blood prevails
[1:21:32] y'all better hear what I'm saying this
[1:21:34] morning I'm doubting God hallelujah
[1:21:37] believe God stop doubting God
[1:21:40] hallelujah
[1:21:46] when the devil says
[1:21:50] hallelujah it's not by your words it's
[1:21:55] by his words it's what he's already done
[1:21:57] he saved you he called you he elected
[1:22:02] you and he that begun the good work in
[1:22:05] you is faithful to complete it
[1:22:23] he gave me some good punches Hallelujah
[1:22:26] but still yet man he couldn't hold me
[1:22:29] down
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:41] yes God has ordained deceiving you never
[1:22:45] to quit who can never give up even
[1:22:48] though sometimes you may feel like
[1:22:51] giving up
[1:22:53] that will not give up
[1:22:57] thanks be to God for the power of the
[1:23:01] Holy Ghost
[1:23:03] because of his life in US
[1:23:08] Hallelujah
[1:23:38] man but the seed of God
[1:23:41] they don't know why they believe it and
[1:23:44] they accept it Hallelujah Mary said when
[1:23:48] the angel told marriage
[1:23:51] cause I'm the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you
[1:23:55] shall bring forth
[1:23:56] Hallelujah
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:02] but nevertheless
[1:24:10] I don't know how he's gonna do it don't
[1:24:13] know how he's going to do it but I said
[1:24:16] being unto me
[1:24:23] a clean heart
[1:24:26] created me a real new spirit
[1:24:33] amen the fullness of Christ
[1:24:38] thank you
[1:24:40] hallelujah amen he is the high priest of
[1:24:43] our confession
[1:24:45] the Hebrew says
[1:24:48] the Hebrew letter says
[1:24:50] he's the half priest of our confession
[1:24:55] welcome
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:26:04] you are crazy
[1:26:07] but your craziness is of God not of this
[1:26:11] world think about it
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:16] and all these Roman emperors
[1:26:25] were plum crazy
[1:26:30] for something you cannot see
[1:26:34] that those Emperors didn't see
[1:26:37] him
[1:26:48] when they stole Stephen
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:58] nobody else could see him but Steven
[1:27:01] eyes
[1:27:03] and when they were killing those
[1:27:05] Christians
[1:27:17] those Christians they didn't run away
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:22] but all they could do is run to the
[1:27:25] lions
[1:27:31] in a moment's time it'll be all over is
[1:27:35] that right that's the same way Paul
[1:27:37] looked at it
[1:27:40] because
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:59] I was over there she behind the curtain
[1:29:03] of town
[1:29:04] Hallelujah he said I saw Millions
[1:29:10] oh
[1:29:13] my gosh I'm one of those Millions
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:34] I'm sorry
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:30:00] to Jesus Christ
[1:30:03] amen

[1:30:15] place you just make that connection the
[1:30:18] Holy Spirit

[1:58:43] I cut my hair
[1:58:45] when I met Jesus
[1:58:48] my wardrobe changed my my my brother you

[2:00:13] like this listening
[2:00:16] and that's in Christ amen
[2:00:19] yeah I'm gonna start with this
[2:00:21] because I'll connect this by God's grace
[2:00:27] when you're buried in Christ
[2:00:29] those people said
[2:00:31] when the Resurrection comes
[2:00:34] you go with the resurrection
[2:00:38] I don't care if you're in Jerusalem
[2:00:43] I don't care if you're in South America
[2:00:45] or America or Canada
[2:00:49] if you buried in Christ
[2:00:52] that is
[2:00:57] God ain't Rapture and nobody in Egypt no
[2:01:04] Hallelujah is that right God a Rapture
[2:01:07] nobody in the world
[2:01:11] is that right Joseph said don't bury my
[2:01:14] bones don't leave me down here in Egypt
[2:01:18] because when the resurrection
[2:01:21] all by him when when Jesus Christ comes
[2:01:25] the resurrection when he comes when the
[2:01:30] son
[2:01:33] is that all right people of God Amen
[2:01:37] oh my you and I will get up
[2:01:40] if we're dead in the grave we get up
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:45] if there's nothing but a teaspoon of ash
[2:01:48] left we'll get up
[2:01:50] somebody help me
[2:01:53] because you're buried in Christ
[2:01:56] remember Jesus said I am the
[2:01:59] resurrection and I am the life
[2:02:04] and when Jesus died
[2:02:06] the Bible tells us he went into the
[2:02:10] region of the
[2:02:13] laws that were in prison
[2:02:17] those that were in Egypt
[2:02:19] those who were in
[2:02:39] hear them
[2:03:06] but because they believed
[2:03:15] they believe
[2:03:17] that
[2:03:18] dog is it good
[2:03:21] it was a type only video it was a type
[2:03:25] of Shiloh Hallelujah
[2:03:32] Jesus I got another stop
[2:03:35] I gotta go by Paradise
[2:03:38] Hallelujah I love this because I didn't
[2:03:41] get to it but I'm gonna tell you
[2:03:42] Abraham called a field
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:57] double portions
[2:04:04] Abraham was buried there
[2:04:06] Sarah was buried
[2:04:09] and did you know that that gravesite
[2:04:13] what's near the place job was buried
[2:04:20] so you understand
[2:04:23] the Bible says let me read it again
[2:04:29] until Shiloh come
[2:04:33] and unto him shall be unto him shall the
[2:04:37] Gathering of the people be obese
[2:04:44] so
[2:04:45] when when Joseph said bear with me
[2:04:49] not in Egypt
[2:04:53] you bury me in the promised land yeah I
[2:04:57] want to be one of my relatives
[2:05:09] but this time man the burial ground
[2:05:14] it's not natural
[2:05:18] we are buried in Christ
[2:05:20] and we are buried with Christ
[2:05:25] somebody help me here so the burial
[2:05:28] ground is in Christ
[2:05:33] because in Christ
[2:05:38] in Christ you cannot die so the saints
[2:05:42] of God when we leave this earth
