[49:01] amen amen
[49:04] let's turn to John chapter
[49:08] foreign
[49:33] John chapter
[49:35] John Chapter 14 verse 18 to verse 20.
[49:38] Jean
[49:41] and the Bible says I will not leave you
[49:45] comfortless I will come to you
[49:50] yet a little while and the world seeth
[49:53] me no more by ye see me because I leave
[49:56] and you shall live also
[50:02] at that day you shall know that I am in
[50:05] my father and in me and I in you
[50:13] let's go back to John chapter 1.
[50:18] we read the verse 1 and we jump to the
[50:20] verse 14.
[50:30] John 1 verse 1 and verse 14.
[50:37] and when the Bible says that in the
[50:39] beginning was the word and the Word was
[50:42] with God and the Word was God
[50:49] verse 14 the Bible says that and the
[50:51] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[51:01] amen let's go to uh first Timothy that's
[51:04] the last um foreign
[51:26] the Bible says that and without
[51:28] controversy great is the mystery of
[51:30] godliness
[51:31] God was manifesting the flesh justify in
[51:34] the spirit
[51:35] sin of angels preach unto the Gentiles
[51:39] believed
[51:41] on in the world received up in glory
[51:44] beauty is
[51:56] foreign
[53:15] again John Chapter 14 verse 18 to 20.
[53:28] John 14 18-20 jeans
[53:32] and when here the Bible says that I will
[53:35] not leave you comfortless
[53:38] I will come to you
[53:40] he had a little while the world seeth me
[53:44] no more by ye see me because I live and
[53:47] you shall live also
[53:52] and at that day you shall know that I am
[53:55] in my father
[53:57] and you in me and I in you
[54:04] amen that's a that's a great problem
[54:07] that's a great promise that God gave us
[54:09] effect that because I leave you shall
[54:12] live also because
[54:14] and we'll try to remind you again with
[54:17] what we've said the last time
[54:22] and just to get everybody up to date and
[54:25] and continue from there
[54:28] amen we know that as we read it in John
[54:31] chapter 1 that in the beginning was the
[54:33] word and the Word was God and the Word
[54:36] was with God and the Word was God
[54:42] so we preached it that before the
[54:45] beginning
[54:48] before the creation
[54:50] amen because there in John chapter one
[54:53] John was talking about the beginning
[54:57] John was talking about when when God
[55:00] started to create jean-pally
[55:04] and the time when time began
[55:09] that's what he said in the beginning
[55:14] with the grace of God Amen we received
[55:17] the prophet
[55:18] man who was able to bring us before the
[55:22] beginning
[55:24] he met before the time began
[55:29] before the before the creation
[55:32] amen the prophecies that before that God
[55:35] was the spirit
[55:38] amen his Spirit was covering the entire
[55:40] Earth
[55:45] yeah and then he was covering the entire
[55:47] Earth
[55:48] so since he was covering the entire
[55:51] Earth there were no place for for
[55:53] creation
[55:57] because he was only him and he was only
[56:00] him covering that entire surface
[56:02] [Music]
[56:04] amen and then he decided to make to
[56:07] become a son
[56:10] amen the Bible says that the prophet
[56:13] says that he condensed himself to that
[56:15] form that we call the logos
[56:19] amen the logos also means the anointing
[56:22] the logos
[56:23] which is the Son of God which is also
[56:26] the Son of God
[56:27] so he became that son
[56:31] amen so that he can start now to to
[56:34] create
[56:37] amen and when he started to create
[56:41] that's when John started to write
[56:45] in the beginning was the word
[56:48] amen because that spirit that thoughts
[56:53] himself into into one form
[57:11] [Music]
[57:25] Amen in order for you to see it you had
[57:27] to have the spiritual eyes
[57:30] you could only see him by Revelation
[57:35] what do you mean
[57:37] amen he said that that son is the logos
[57:40] to love us which is the pillar of fire
[57:44] they might notice that when the children
[57:46] of Israel was crossing the the Red Sea
[57:49] markets and the Bible said that Pharaoh
[57:52] was in their back coming for I mean to
[57:54] kill them
[58:20] that Revelation was given to him
[58:24] amen by far referral wasn't able to see
[58:27] that pill of fire
[58:30] that's why it was continued that's why
[58:32] it was keep on it was uh pursuing them
[58:36] and so they have to know to see him you
[58:40] had to be had to be revealed to you
[58:43] amen you had to be you have to you had
[58:46] to have uh you had you had to have a
[58:48] revelation
[58:49] amen and only and back then only
[58:52] prophets that was able to most of the
[58:54] temples on the prophets that was able to
[58:56] see him
[58:57] foreign

[1:39:46] when he said that for the wrath of God
[1:39:49] is revealed from Heaven against all
[1:39:52] ungodliness
[1:39:59] of men
[1:40:01] who hold the truth
[1:40:04] in on righteousness
[1:40:07] verse 19 because thou which may be known
[1:40:11] of God is Manifest in manifesting them
[1:40:14] for God has showed it unto them
[1:40:18] manifest
[1:40:21] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:40:24] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:40:27] being understood by the things that are
[1:40:30] made even his eternal power and godhead
[1:40:33] so that they are without excuse
[1:40:36] Perfections
[1:40:47] because that when they knew God
[1:40:53] they glorify him not as God
[1:40:58] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:41:03] their imaginations and their foolish
[1:41:05] heart was darkened in the Lions
[1:41:13] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:41:16] became
[1:41:17] foolsage and change the glory of the of
[1:41:22] the uncorrectable god into an image made
[1:41:25] like the corruptable man is
[1:41:31] and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[1:41:35] creeping things
[1:41:39] through the lust of their own hearts and
[1:41:43] and to dishonor their own bodies between
[1:41:46] themselves
[1:41:52] who changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:41:56] and worshiped and served the creature
[1:41:59] more than the Creator who he's blessed
[1:42:03] forever amen amen
[1:42:12] amen uh uh let's jump here uh
[1:42:17] uh verse 28.
[1:42:22] he says that and even as they did not
[1:42:24] like to retain God in their knowledge
[1:42:27] God gave them over to report uh Repro
[1:42:31] reprobate mind to do those things which
[1:42:35] are not convenient communities
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:43] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:42:45] fornication wickedness covetness
[1:42:48] malicious full of Envy murder debate
[1:42:51] deceit my dignity and Whispers
[1:43:06] despiteful proud boasters uh inventors
[1:43:10] of evil things disobedient to parents
[1:43:21] without understanding Covenant Breakers
[1:43:24] without natural affection incapable and
[1:43:28] merciful
[1:43:29] intelligence
[1:43:32] who knowing the Judgment of God that the
[1:43:36] witch that their which commit such
[1:43:38] things are worthy of death not only to
[1:43:41] the same but have pleasure in them that
[1:43:43] do
[1:43:44] themselves
[1:43:53] 21 it says that because that when they
[1:43:57] knew God reverse events
[1:44:01] that glorified him not as God
[1:44:05] then in their imaginations
[1:44:09] imagination and their foolish heart was
[1:44:11] dark person
[1:44:52] amen I will go and I will have you know
[1:44:55] multiple wives and I will go sleep with
[1:44:57] women and things like that because I
[1:44:59] know that God you know I have the grace
[1:45:01] of God and God will forgive me
[1:45:03] please
[1:45:08] that they knew God foreign
[1:45:37] amen but God gave them the spirit
[1:45:41] according
[1:45:43] amen because Grace is not something that
[1:45:46] we can play with
[1:45:48] amen God is merciful
[1:45:51] amen by his Mercy also can turn to
[1:45:54] judgment

[1:46:10] will overflow
[1:46:12] amen there is a time where that Mercy
[1:46:15] will change into judgments
[1:46:18] you have to pay for everything
[1:46:22] last Wednesday that every action there
[1:46:25] is a reaction to a
[1:46:27] reactions
[1:46:29] so whatever you do today and you say
[1:46:32] where people don't see me I'm by myself
[1:46:34] and using my phone and um
[1:46:49] you have to know that there is always in
[1:46:51] God the eye of God that's watching
[1:46:56] amen the guy is watching Drew himself
[1:46:58] and he knows everything
[1:47:00] amen the prophet here it continues and
[1:47:03] we want to close the prophet here
[1:47:04] continues and says that about God but
[1:47:06] that is the god the Creator
[1:47:11] living in you
[1:47:14] and giving you all the powers
[1:47:17] and you're in possession of anything
[1:47:20] that he had if we don't put on position
[1:47:24] so is it so is it in you to abstain from
[1:47:29] Evil
[1:47:33] to do good
[1:47:35] to shun evil and flee to righteousness
[1:47:42] to turn away from Temptation
[1:47:47] oh malice hatred strife
[1:47:51] and so forth turn away from it
[1:47:57] take him from your heart
[1:48:01] they will take God from your heart
[1:48:07] if you will receive him
[1:48:10] Embrace him and love him
[1:48:13] and hold him in your heart
[1:48:16] and love him I can't tell you the church
[1:48:19] together in that kind of a power
[1:48:24] has the power to bind the heavens
[1:48:28] heal the sick
[1:48:30] Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah
[1:48:37] and the death here the death here it is
[1:48:40] the creepers walk this is the blind sea

[1:49:17] the controllers control what you're
[1:49:19] saying
[1:49:20] what you're watching

[1:49:27] then that power of God will reflect in
[1:49:30] you

[1:54:14] children to go to church early one
[1:54:16] yourself you don't come to church early
[1:54:18] um
[1:54:19] how are you gonna tell your children
[1:54:21] that this type of music is wrong when
[1:54:24] yourself you do listen to that type of
[1:54:25] music
[1:54:31] that parents do have on their children
[1:54:36] they might not realize it but the
[1:54:38] children always look up to their parents
[1:54:40] you
[1:54:43] regardless amen it doesn't matter how
[1:54:46] how young they are they always look up
[1:54:48] to them foreign
[1:55:43] matter if Jesus is in US
[1:55:46] amen we have to live like Jesus we have
[1:55:50] to talk like Jesus amen we have to walk
[1:55:53] like Jesus amen we have to stop being
[1:55:56] hypocrite
[1:55:58] amen we have to be we have to become
[1:56:01] Christian all the time and every
[1:56:02] everywhere
[1:56:05] am I doing what the Bible asks us to do
[1:56:09] amen being in the father's business
[1:56:17] God will give it to us
[1:56:20] amen because the prophet says that in
[1:56:22] order for the third put to come in

[1:57:08] will be with you even in you but
[1:57:12] um
[1:57:19] amen but we just think that we just
[1:57:22] thank him for you know for his presence
[1:57:25] and his grace
[1:57:27] remember every time I preach I always
[1:57:29] say the Lord I want to be so sensitive
[1:57:31] to the holy spirit
[1:57:35] because that's what I want to do
[1:57:38] how many hours are put in for a sermon
[1:57:50] I know it's not a hard thing to do when
[1:57:53] you change your when it changes your
[1:57:54] sermon at the last minute
[1:57:58] amen but that's what I want him to do
[1:58:01] Amen to answer to speak to the need of
[1:58:04] the church
[1:58:07] because the Holy Spirit was wrong and
[1:58:10] what's right
[1:58:12] and when he speaks that means that there
[1:58:15] is something that we need to fix it
[1:58:18] it meant that there is something that we
[1:58:21] need to fix
[1:58:22] our lives in our homes
[1:58:25] what are we letting in it
[1:58:29] what are we doing
[1:58:31] amen what type of songs are listening
[1:58:37] we drink kitchen
[1:58:40] it doesn't matter how you justify it is
[1:58:45] that when you have questions on
[1:58:47] something
[1:58:50] don't do it because it might be that one
[1:58:54] thing that can keep you from the kingdom
[1:58:55] of God
[1:59:00] so when you question something is this
[1:59:02] good or bad
[1:59:06] my advice to you is not to do it
[1:59:10] man just don't do it because it might be
[1:59:14] that one thing that can keep you from
[1:59:15] the kingdom of God
