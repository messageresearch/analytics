[27:34] surely God is good to us are we gonna
[27:42] ask you turn with us to Psalms 23 please
[27:48] simple but powerful the Lord just gave
[27:58] me a little wisdom the other day I was
[28:02] just thinking basically what is
[28:05] acceptable before God what is acceptable
[28:08] it has nothing this has nothing to do
[28:10] basically with what I'm getting ready to
[28:12] preach what I was thinking about music
[28:15] and everything else and he took me back
[28:19] to the Word of God where it says that
[28:22] that will be done in earth as it is in
[28:24] heaven so everything that we do in an
[28:26] earth is supposed to be accepted if it
[28:31] can't be accepted in heaven we're not
[28:33] supposed to do it on earth if it's
[28:37] movies
[28:38] music dance whatever it is if you don't
[28:44] see where that can fit or be accepted in
[28:47] heaven you should not do it that's
[28:52] simple
[28:52] but it's powerful I was talking to a
[28:56] Christian the other day and I asked him
[28:58] because of the music that he was playing
[29:00] I I said is it supposed to be Christian
[29:03] music and I said well let me ask you a
[29:05] question
[29:06] do you really think they're gonna be
[29:07] singing that kind of song at heaven and
[29:10] he had to be honest and he said no I
[29:12] said well then if it's not gonna be
[29:14] accepted in heaven you shouldn't be
[29:15] doing it we are here to do the Father's
[29:19] will Psalms 1
[29:22] I'm sorry 23 we're gonna read the whole
[29:27] whole of Psalms here through the 6th
[29:30] verse I just thank God for His mercy
[29:41] Psalms 23 1 through 6 the Lord is my
[29:46] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[29:49] to lie down in green pastures he leadeth
[29:52] me beside the still waters he restoreth
[29:56] my soul he leadeth me in the paths of
[29:59] righteousness for his name's sake
[30:02] yay though I walk through the valley of
[30:05] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[30:07] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[30:11] staff they comfort me
[30:12] thou prepareth the table before me in
[30:15] the presence of mine enemies thou
[30:16] anointest my head with oil my cup
[30:19] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[30:22] shall follow me all the days of my life
[30:25] and I will dwell in the house of the
[30:28] Lord forever
[30:29] let us pray father we thank you for your
[30:33] amazing grace we thank you for being so
[30:36] good to us
[30:37] you have been better to us Lord that we
[30:40] have been to ourselves father
[30:42] there are times oh lord where we don't
[30:45] even know how to pray but lord you said
[30:48] your spirit will intercede for us and
[30:51] perhaps
[30:52] there are those here tonight Lord that
[30:54] need you to intercede for them Lord I
[30:57] need you all the time
[30:59] help us Lord that will seek not our own
[31:02] will but that will seek your will father
[31:05] and that will die to our old self I all
[31:08] will Amen that your will may be
[31:11] glorified father we're here just to say
[31:15] thank you for being the God that you are
[31:18] and in our name Lord Jesus Christ we
[31:21] pray thanking you for all things amen
[31:25] you may be seated
[31:26] I know this is just how I was thinking
[31:29] you know as God was giving me this
[31:33] message and I'm always seeking the Lord
[31:36] on what he wants me to do sometimes I'm
[31:38] just perplexed because I don't want to
[31:41] get up here and say what I want to say I
[31:43] really just want to say what God wants
[31:46] to say and you know something said we'll
[31:50] just brag on him tonight
[31:53] you know I really believe when I read
[31:56] Psalms here when I was reading it I
[31:58] thought you know David is not only
[32:00] talking about the goodness of God but
[32:02] he's literally bragging on because David
[32:05] said when he says I shall not want
[32:08] why because he's my shepherd and I
[32:12] thought about it like who is David
[32:14] talking about you know we a lot of
[32:17] people say they know God and they they
[32:19] really don't make Christians and all
[32:22] like I said it's one thing to know me my
[32:25] wife and I I think we were talking about
[32:27] this just this morning or last night
[32:29] everybody don't mind Savior but nobody
[32:32] wants Lord and then when it comes to God
[32:36] being your friend many people don't know
[32:38] him as a friend but you know what friend
[32:42] when you got a when you got God as your
[32:45] friend think about it the Bible said
[32:48] that God called Abraham friend and when
[32:52] you think about a friend that that the
[32:55] Bobby said a friend a real friend sticks
[32:58] closer than a brother well I can truly
[33:01] say this that God is above all friends
[33:05] right amen because when I need him he's
[33:08] always there I'm bragging on him because
[33:13] I realize who he is you know we're
[33:17] talking about not a secondary God or
[33:20] third we're talking about V God right in
[33:24] the message of Dobson brother Bell says
[33:25] let me before we go further he said I
[33:28] pick it up he says listen when God
[33:29] before he made man he called himself lol
[33:34] ah hello him that means he was the
[33:38] self-existing one I want you to
[33:39] understand this now because when you
[33:41] talk about Jesus Christ all you're
[33:44] talking about is that your Savior your
[33:47] Lord your friend your family is that
[33:52] right Oh sake Jesus ain't my family yes
[33:54] he is he's my mother he's my father
[33:58] he's my sister he's my brother he's my
[34:01] all and all Oh hallelujah
[34:05] think about it he's a self existing one
[34:08] Amen when there was nothing he was there
[34:13] listen we must understand that when we
[34:17] talk about the word when we talk about
[34:19] God we're talking about the word and the
[34:22] Bible said in the beginning was the word
[34:23] the Word was with God and the Word was
[34:25] God that same word is still God
[34:29] hallelujah and the Bible tells us
[34:32] according to Psalms 33 and for for the
[34:35] word of the Lord is right and all his
[34:40] works are done in truth hallelujah so we
[34:44] don't have to worry about God leading
[34:46] leading us in error whatever God says
[34:49] he's gonna do that's what he's gonna do
[34:51] is that Alright we know that hey man he
[34:55] is the only according to the Bible
[34:57] he's the only you know III don't know
[34:59] how Timothy felt when he was writing
[35:01] that but Timothy say Amen he when he
[35:05] writes this he says when in in first
[35:07] Timothy 6 and 15 says which in his times
[35:10] he shall show who is the blessed and
[35:13] only potentate king of
[35:17] Kings and Lord of lords now he says now
[35:21] if he goes right back cuz you know
[35:23] Timothy you know he's he's how could I
[35:26] said he's one of those ones a man that
[35:30] know the grace of God hallelujah amen
[35:34] and he was taught by way of Paul Paul
[35:36] called him his son hallelujah
[35:38] so you and I must understand that Paul
[35:41] our Timothy knew God as God by Oh
[35:45] here ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one
[35:49] so here Timothy is right now the
[35:51] inspiration and he's telling a man he's
[35:54] bragging on him right
[35:56] he's the only potentate he's king of
[35:59] kings
[36:00] is that right I don't care how many
[36:02] kings Amen Rome has Herod Pilate it
[36:06] doesn't matter
[36:07] Amen we know by God's grace that all
[36:10] King his king of that King is that right
[36:14] the bouncer who talked about when he
[36:17] talked about this God he's not just
[36:19] talking about Ella him because he's
[36:21] bringing Ella him to us by way of Jesus
[36:23] Christ is that right the Bible said in
[36:26] the in him throughout the fullness of
[36:29] the Godhead bodily right amen and that
[36:33] means God the full God every attribute
[36:37] of God was in the vessel Jesus Christ
[36:39] that's why in John 10:10 one he's excuse
[36:45] me 10:30 he said I and my father are one
[36:48] he said to Philip when you see me you
[36:51] see the father so understand by God's
[36:54] grace he wasn't talking about his
[36:56] physical he was talking about the
[36:58] attributes hallelujah even that's what
[37:01] the bride is being formed into the
[37:03] attributes of God that's the image we
[37:06] won't hallelujah
[37:08] listen he says who had only have
[37:11] immortality dwelling in the light which
[37:14] no man can approach unto whom no man
[37:18] have seen nor can see to whom be honor
[37:21] and power everlasting amen hallelujah
[37:25] Jesus Christ the one who dwelt in the
[37:28] light come on somebody
[37:31] in mortality you said what God is like
[37:34] want you wish you must understand that
[37:36] God is a spirit the light is just a
[37:39] clothing of God hallelujah cuz you can't
[37:43] see a spirit hallelujah but God clothed
[37:46] himself in the light and we call it the
[37:49] pillar fire hallelujah
[37:51] that same pillar fire is eternal
[37:53] hallelujah amen it is God what God my
[37:57] god
[37:58] is your God I want the devil to know
[38:01] that I can brag on him
[38:02] yes all what do you mean brother was you
[38:04] going through a hard time but he's still
[38:06] God hallelujah he's still God and no
[38:10] matter what times I go through he will
[38:13] always be God in my life hallelujah
[38:16] if God chooses never to bless me again
[38:19] he's still God hallelujah he will always
[38:23] be calm hallelujah doesn't matter how
[38:26] much Satan try whatever kind of tactics
[38:29] he has and then trying to destroy me I
[38:32] Got News for him my god shield me before

[1:02:27] you Thomas you're not blessed because
[1:02:29] you didn't believe what happened God he
[1:02:33] didn't have to do it but God knew Thomas
[1:02:35] thought before he even walked through
[1:02:37] the wall hallelujah before I got out of
[1:02:40] his mouth Jesus and let me go show this
[1:02:42] guy hallelujah amen
[1:02:44] so he is a committee to become a
[1:02:46] believer he's a believer but he need to
[1:02:48] feel something that's how some people
[1:02:50] are then still they're believers but he
[1:02:52] got to feel something and God makes
[1:02:55] provision for them hallelujah ain't the
[1:03:00] Lord good mmm yes sure you know this is
[1:03:06] you know you think about how blessed you
[1:03:08] and I are amen because we have ears to
[1:03:12] hear yeah I tell you what sometimes I
[1:03:15] think about it this is the Bible said
[1:03:17] listen this is one of my favorite
[1:03:18] scripture John 10:27 236 my sheep hear
[1:03:22] with my voice and I know them and they
[1:03:25] follow me
[1:03:30] wait a minute
[1:03:31] my sheep hear my voice it doesn't say
[1:03:34] voices says voice that means whenever
[1:03:37] there's one boy for every age one voice
[1:03:44] hmm those people who wouldn't follow
[1:03:46] Luther guess what they were lost cousin
[1:03:53] it went Luther's voice it was God in
[1:03:56] Luther those who you said all brother
[1:03:59] Brooks those Lutheran's who did not
[1:04:01] follow Wesley they were
[1:04:08] because they not what they normally do
[1:04:11] is like the Pentecostal like when the
[1:04:13] Westley saw the pillar call shows a man
[1:04:15] guess what they said that's of the devil
[1:04:17] when you say such a thing is that be
[1:04:20] careful because when you say such a
[1:04:22] thing like that in this age you
[1:04:24] blaspheme the Holy Ghost and that's what
[1:04:29] the Luther's the West is they couldn't
[1:04:31] see that shot when speaking in tongues
[1:04:33] and all of that it was right in the word
[1:04:35] but because Luther didn't teach them
[1:04:37] that they thought it was wrong and the
[1:04:41] same thing with the Pentecostals they
[1:04:42] blaspheme themselves away from God you
[1:04:45] say they shouting in desert is bigger
[1:04:47] than thumbs and the Bible said that's
[1:04:49] the strong illusion delusion they will
[1:04:52] believe a lie what oh yeah brother and
[1:04:56] lean unto Him you know we you know he he
[1:04:58] wouldn't he wasn't of God you know God
[1:05:00] used him but you know when he got into
[1:05:02] that serpent seed that was over devil
[1:05:04] see they signed themselves away no
[1:05:07] matter how much shouting how much
[1:05:09] dancing how much running how much faith
[1:05:12] today the church how they pay ties Jesus
[1:05:15] said that's one thing they will not be
[1:05:18] forgiven when you call that thing that
[1:05:20] is of God of the devil that in my
[1:05:25] preaching to earth and it doesn't matter
[1:05:28] whether we believe that or not it
[1:05:31] doesn't believe it like so many people
[1:05:33] didn't believe Noah's Ark the rain no
[1:05:37] are you crazy
[1:05:38] did it rain it rain why cuz no say-so
[1:05:43] hallelujah y'all gonna hear me she we're
[1:05:47] blessed because he the Bible says my
[1:05:50] sheep hear my voice that's why we can't
[1:05:53] follow other people ministry because the
[1:05:55] Bible said and a stranger they will not
[1:05:58] follow I can't follow TD jakes in all of
[1:06:02] the mothers being got nothing you said
[1:06:06] brother well you can say that but it's
[1:06:07] the truth
[1:06:09] what what what in this age what
[1:06:13] trinitarian gonna make a rapture you
[1:06:17] don't even know who God is
[1:06:21] I'm not saying they're not saved I'm
[1:06:23] saying how many gonna make a rapture you
[1:06:28] look this is a wedding ceremony going on
[1:06:30] and you don't even know who you were
[1:06:32] married you don't even know whose name
[1:06:37] you're supposed to take
[1:06:38] you're gonna take Pentecostals and
[1:06:39] Baptist and Methodist and Catholic and
[1:06:42] even message people doing the same thing
[1:06:44] but because you belong to mrs. church
[1:06:46] don't make you rapturing material it's
[1:06:49] when you marry Christ Union night with
[1:06:53] Christ and that's when you are become

[1:07:09] you wasting your time and we ain't got
[1:07:12] time to wait that's what I'm saying
[1:07:14] God has been faithful to us by cuz we
[1:07:17] had a prophet God sent us a voice that
[1:07:22] were y'all sure why you keep getting
[1:07:23] known that it's like I try to tell
[1:07:25] people how you going to talk about uh uh
[1:07:27] how God delivered Israel out of Egypt
[1:07:30] with out talking about Moses are you
[1:07:33] going to talk about even how God travel
[1:07:36] took the children of Israel into the
[1:07:38] Promised Land and leave out Joshua you
[1:07:41] can't do it that's God's provided way
[1:07:48] mmm I don't know what y'all enjoying is
[1:07:53] like I am but I got a I got a brag on
[1:07:57] and I hadn't even come to my part yet
[1:08:00] second Corinthians 11 21 through 23 I
[1:08:03] love the way Paul brag on him cuz Paul
[1:08:05] didn't bag on him and just saying oh you
[1:08:07] know God been so good to me I can just
[1:08:10] tell you gave me a new car a new house
[1:08:12] and I knew this that I knew that didn't
[1:08:13] know what Paul said Paul should I speak
[1:08:17] as concerning reproaches though we've
[1:08:19] had have been weak howbeit we're in so
[1:08:23] ever any is bold I am bold also
[1:08:28] hallelujah now we're gonna have a praise
[1:08:30] and worship we're gonna battle up in
[1:08:33] this place
[1:08:33] hey man we're gonna
[1:08:35] see what you got versus what I got
[1:08:36] posted I'm speaking like a fool but let
[1:08:39] me say it any hair he said are they
[1:08:41] Hebrews so am i are they Israelites so
[1:08:45] am i are they seed of Abraham so am I
[1:08:48] and what is Paul fighting against false
[1:08:50] brethren who's boasting himself to be
[1:08:53] something when they're nothing
[1:08:55] that's what Paul says I'm speaking like
[1:08:57] a food because I'm not trying to be
[1:08:59] nothing he said I only know Christ and
[1:09:00] him crucified hallelujah I'm not here to
[1:09:03] glorify myself but if you're gonna go
[1:09:06] there let's go there are they ministers
[1:09:12] of Christ I speak as a fool I am more Oh
[1:09:16] Paul knew what he was a man you see that
[1:09:20] this message is the only message that
[1:09:22] really identifies Paul as a prophet
[1:09:25] everybody else he said though he's an
[1:09:27] apostle so when you say he's a property
[1:09:29] where you get that from I'll tell you
[1:09:31] where the Bible said that the word of
[1:09:33] the Lord comes to the Prophet and Paul
[1:09:35] wrote almost all the New Testament did
[1:09:38] God bring the word to him hey man
[1:09:42] hallelujah yeah man it Labor's more
[1:09:46] abundant in stripes above measure in
[1:09:49] prison more frequent in deaths oft Paul
[1:09:53] says listen I didn't testified about
[1:09:55] Jesus
[1:09:56] I don't proclaim his name everywhere

[1:10:32] by the heathen in perils in the city in
[1:10:35] perils in the wilderness in perils in
[1:10:37] the sea in perils among the false

[1:13:34] Pentecostals saw God move in such a
[1:13:36] miraculous way with this book then

[1:13:43] real recipe y'all give me somebody man

[1:13:53] preached of me is not after man for I
[1:13:56] neither receive of a man neither was I
[1:13:59] taught of it but by the revelation of
[1:14:01] Jesus Christ in other words I'm founded
[1:14:04] on the foundation that Jesus said I
[1:14:06] ought to be founded on and that is the
[1:14:08] revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:14:11] nobody taught me Jesus I repeat he it
[1:14:16] was revealed to me I met him he could
[1:14:19] say hallelujah oh when I said whoever
[1:14:22] our Lord he says I'm Jesus going to God

[1:14:42] Jews religion about many of my equal in
[1:14:44] my own nation being more exceedingly
[1:14:46] zealous of the traditions of my father's
[1:14:50] hallelujah but when it pleased God who
[1:14:53] separated me from my mother's womb and
[1:14:55] called me by His grace you mean to tell
[1:14:58] me that God allowed me to persecute
[1:15:01] those people he allowed me to call some
[1:15:04] of the blaspheme and all along I was
[1:15:07] still on his book hallelujah

[1:19:01] trusted him to believe that it was over

[1:21:50] things that went on and had they had all
[1:21:53] the Deacons and preachers had to fight
[1:21:55] this lady she was climbing all over
[1:21:56] their backs and everything trying to get
[1:21:58] in the prayer line then all of a sudden
[1:22:00] while he's looking out somewhere here is
[1:22:02] this Brown looking baby a man standing
[1:22:05] in the midair what is he saying
[1:22:07] I didn't do it well in fact I really he
[1:22:12] said I sent or King David's name he said
[1:22:15] I said what are the brothers there to go

[1:22:19] size and everything else she would have
[1:22:20] known it then God stopped the show I
[1:22:25] love it hallelujah he stopped the show
[1:22:28] he said hold it wait a minute bring me
[1:22:31] that later in Tracy hallelujah what
[1:22:34] happened God took a baby that had been
[1:22:36] dead the day before and raised him up
[1:22:41] hmm
[1:22:42] that's my god that wasn't 2000 years ago
[1:22:46] that's my god that's your God and if he
[1:22:49] did it then he can do it now but we let
[1:22:52] our sisters control our faith sisters
[1:22:55] ain't got nothing to do with faith faith
[1:22:57] they call those things that be not as
[1:22:58] though they were I'm almost done people
[1:23:01] just just a little while longer Amen
[1:23:03] when we need help we got to call heaven
[1:23:05] ah hey man the scripture says Amen God
[1:23:09] is our refuge and strength a very
[1:23:11] present help in trouble any like like
[1:23:15] they say can I get a witness
[1:23:17] hallelujah Amen everybody ought to know
[1:23:20] that God helps in time of trouble yeah
[1:23:24] man therefore will not we fear though
[1:23:27] the earth be removed let me tell you
[1:23:29] something you and I we have not seen
[1:23:31] anything yet we're sheltered in it in
[1:23:35] this IO right now everybody have the
[1:23:38] earthquakes and everything else and we
[1:23:39] just I suppose you say holy you stay
[1:23:44] holy and as long as we don't lose our
[1:23:46] salt
[1:23:48] this place will be protected now I
[1:23:52] believe that I truly believe that but if
[1:23:57] we lose our save if we lose the effect
[1:24:00] and we get out and start doing all kind
[1:24:02] of stuff that we God
[1:24:04] judges not only you'll judge us but
[1:24:07] he'll judge this whole state because uh
[1:24:10] we are the Church of the Living God
[1:24:12] we're like Jerusalem hallelujah
[1:24:15] y'all understand me to Israel when
[1:24:17] Jerusalem held her salt when she hurled
[1:24:20] her strength as as a witness for the
[1:24:22] Lord they were blessed but when she did
[1:24:25] what she did and lost that strength she
[1:24:27] loved everything she suppose the hand
[1:24:30] was taken from he's the same God is that
[1:24:35] right look how bless I look at you you
[1:24:37] look at look at California when
[1:24:40] California the city of the Angels when
[1:24:43] California held that holiness and that
[1:24:46] righteousness you heard nothing about
[1:24:48] earthquakes but when God saw judgment
[1:24:55] because when tongs came did you know
[1:24:57] when the Spirit of the Lord fell in the
[1:24:59] zuzo street they had a massive
[1:25:00] earthquake and what was happening now
[1:25:04] tongues came in and tongues is a sign of
[1:25:08] the judgment people think the tongues is
[1:25:10] see that's what Babylon did Babylon when
[1:25:13] they were death that King and that
[1:25:15] Kingdom was getting ready to move out
[1:25:16] guess what was happening god handwriting
[1:25:19] on the wall was spoken in tongues and
[1:25:22] need an interpreter right the Gentile
[1:25:25] Age came in that way and it goes out
[1:25:28] that way
[1:25:28] that's how we know this is the end of
[1:25:30] the day cuz now everybody say it's the
[1:25:34] evidence of the Holy Ghost and it's not
[1:25:37] some Paul said that's the least of all
[1:25:39] the gifts they take you in the room and
[1:25:42] say ha yeah that make you say something
[1:25:44] and you call it the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:46] Cainan live it the Holy Ghost make you
[1:25:49] leader hallelujah he ain't gonna force
[1:25:57] you but he will make you yeah it calls
[1:26:01] it if you really want to live right the
[1:26:03] law to keep working with you therefore
[1:26:07] we're not fear though the waters thereof
[1:26:09] roar and be troubled though the
[1:26:11] mountains shake with the swelling there
[1:26:13] are there's a river the streams thereof
[1:26:16] shall make glad the City of God
[1:26:18] the holy place of the tabernacle of the
[1:26:20] Most High God God is in the midst of her
[1:26:25] she shall not be moved
[1:26:27] wait a minute you think God talking
[1:26:30] about a city made by hands he talked
[1:26:32] about you we are the city that cannot be
[1:26:37] moved

[1:26:40] that cannot be moved you are in the
[1:26:42] kingdom and the Kingdom is in you I'm
[1:26:45] almost done
[1:26:46] amen you gotta realize and this is what
[1:26:50] I'm saying I'm bragging on Jesus tonight
[1:26:53] why everybody's making a mockery
[1:26:56] you know Jesus walked on the water he
[1:26:58] sho did why is that so difficult to
[1:27:03] really believe he rose from there yes he
[1:27:07] did well how do you know cuz he's living
[1:27:10] in me and people don't know God doesn't
[1:27:15] change God doesn't change people if only
[1:27:18] he not made a rapture was not no say he
[1:27:24] would say but he had to go through the
[1:27:26] Great Tribulation we don't even know how
[1:27:30] many people there were in Enochs name
[1:27:31] but one thing he not was smart he walked
[1:27:35] with God what about Elizabeth and her
[1:27:38] husband who house was so so holy
[1:27:41] today were visited by an angel doing
[1:27:45] everything they can do to do right God

[1:27:52] gonna give you a special one mmm gave
[1:27:57] them John the Baptist so you got to
[1:28:02] understand there's always rewards when
[1:28:05] you live circumspectly through the word
[1:28:07] when you circumcise yourself to that
[1:28:10] word you might look like a fanatic you
[1:28:12] might have to walk by yourself

[1:30:09] on the day of Pentecost he had him
[1:30:12] preach it out it probably didn't have no
[1:30:15] building everywhere they went the Bible

[1:32:00] mistakes here it is now he's he's a
[1:32:03] spectacle they have a laughing at him I
