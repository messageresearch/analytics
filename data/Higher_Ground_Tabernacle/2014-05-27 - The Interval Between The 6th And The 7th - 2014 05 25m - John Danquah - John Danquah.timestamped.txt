[57:46] 13 this morning
[57:49] uh we're just going to do a little
[57:51] teaching
[57:53] here
[57:56] and I
[57:58] beheld and heard an Angel flying through
[58:01] the midst of
[58:03] Heaven saying with a loud
[58:07] voice
[58:08] w
[58:11] w
[58:13] wo to the
[58:15] inhabitant of the
[58:17] Earth by reason of the other voices of
[58:21] The
[58:22] Trumpet of the Three Angels which are
[58:25] yet to
[58:26] sound now chapter 8 from verse
[58:29] 7 you see the first Angel
[58:33] sounded and the follow hail and fire
[58:35] mingled with Blood cast upon the Earth
[58:39] and third path of the trees was bent
[58:43] up verse 8 the second Angel
[58:47] sounded as it were a great Mountain
[58:49] burning with fire was cast into the sea
[58:52] third part of the sea became blood
[58:55] verse n the third part of the creatures
[58:58] which were in the
[58:59] sea and and had life died and the third
[59:02] part of the ships were
[59:04] destroyed the third Angel sounded and
[59:06] there fell a great star from Heaven
[59:08] burning as it were a lamb it fell upon
[59:10] the third part of the rivers upon The
[59:12] Fountains of waters the name of the star
[59:14] is called wormwood and the third part of
[59:16] the waters became worwood and many men
[59:19] they died of the waters because they
[59:20] were made
[59:22] bitter the third the fourth Angel sound
[59:24] and the third part of the sun was
[59:26] meeting third part of the moon third
[59:28] part of the Stars so the th the third
[59:31] part of them that was darken and the day
[59:33] shown not for a third part of it and the
[59:35] night
[59:37] likewise two things are happening
[59:40] here the first four trumpeters the
[59:43] angels that sounded affected the
[59:48] environment the last three woes are
[59:53] affecting the inhabitant
[59:55] or the people that
[59:57] occupy the
[1:00:00] environment may the Lord add blessings
[1:00:02] to his
[1:00:03] word Lord we honor you for your grace
[1:00:06] and this morning I pray
[1:00:08] for unction that you will come and bless
[1:00:10] us and the prophet told us that when the
[1:00:15] scriptures are written you bring life
[1:00:17] when we see the Fulfillment of it and
[1:00:21] the expectations because we know what
[1:00:22] you have done we look forward to what
[1:00:25] you're about to
[1:00:26] do what you are doing now we give you
[1:00:29] praise for it we thank you Father for
[1:00:32] your grace bless my wife and children
[1:00:35] brother gear this morning will be
[1:00:36] preaching and all the ministers that are
[1:00:38] handling the word of God this morning
[1:00:41] worldwide may you bless them Lord and
[1:00:43] anoint them for their services in Jesus
[1:00:45] Christ's name amen you see the
[1:00:52] Saints um
[1:00:56] I want to take a subject this morning
[1:00:58] and preach on the
[1:01:00] interval between the 6th and the
[1:01:08] 7th uh because uh many people today uh
[1:01:13] only know Jesus by the
[1:01:15] cross and that's all they can they can
[1:01:18] look at and that's so they can see they
[1:01:21] can never move on into any promises
[1:01:24] after
[1:01:25] that so may God help us today that as we
[1:01:28] progress into the
[1:01:29] word it will be a blessing to
[1:01:32] us amen amen
[1:01:38] um going to start with a
[1:01:43] quote in the seven seal page 534
[1:01:47] paragraph
[1:01:49] 2 but Brenham says here that the sixth
[1:01:52] chapter ends up The Sixth Seal and it is
[1:01:55] correct Revelation chapter 6 it
[1:01:59] ends the six seals because the seventh
[1:02:03] seal is in chapter 8: 1 are you with me
[1:02:07] Church
[1:02:13] okay now but between the Sixth
[1:02:18] Seal and the seventh
[1:02:21] seal there is something that takes place
[1:02:23] between these
[1:02:27] how lovely that is placed just in its
[1:02:31] right place between the sixth and the
[1:02:34] seventh if you
[1:02:36] notice in the seventh chapter we notice
[1:02:40] that between the sixth and the seventh
[1:02:43] seal there is an interval between the
[1:02:46] sixth and the seventh of the Book of
[1:02:48] Revelation it is between the six and the
[1:02:51] seventh seal that this interval is given
[1:02:54] yes we want you to notice this very
[1:02:58] important that we notice this little
[1:03:03] time so if the prophet of God thinks
[1:03:06] that it is important for us to notice
[1:03:09] this time I want us to take our time and
[1:03:11] go into it amen are you with me church
[1:03:14] amen because we all understand
[1:03:18] that the Sixth Seal is the Tribulation
[1:03:23] seal
[1:03:26] so it is
[1:03:28] coming are you with
[1:03:30] me the seven
[1:03:33] seal has a
[1:03:35] threefold mystery to
[1:03:39] it but is saying that between the Sixth
[1:03:43] Seal that ends in chapter
[1:03:45] six and the seventh seal which is
[1:03:48] chapter 8 and:
[1:03:50] 1 there's an interval and the interval
[1:03:54] well it's Revelation chapter
[1:03:56] 7 and he want us to watch
[1:04:00] this now
[1:04:02] since we are living here at this time
[1:04:07] when Israel is not out of their
[1:04:10] Homeland Israel is in their Homeland now
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:14] okay but Israel has not yet received
[1:04:18] there are two
[1:04:19] prophets and we are here we have to find
[1:04:23] out the reason why
[1:04:24] yeah and what is delaying them to
[1:04:29] receive they two
[1:04:33] prophets before I get into
[1:04:37] that let me get into the mystery between
[1:04:40] the sixth Church age and the seventh
[1:04:42] Church
[1:04:44] age you all know that the sixth Church
[1:04:46] age is the age of
[1:04:50] Philadelphia the age of Brotherly
[1:04:53] kindness
[1:04:54] the lisian church age is our age that
[1:04:57] started around
[1:04:59] 1906 you know many people say how can
[1:05:01] Bram say that the age started in 1906
[1:05:04] and the messenger was born in
[1:05:08] 1909 the reason the messengers of the
[1:05:12] age do not appear at the beginning of
[1:05:15] the age they come at the end of the age
[1:05:19] to rebuke the age of their falling
[1:05:21] condition amen are you with the church
[1:05:23] amen
[1:05:26] okay there was an open
[1:05:30] door between the six and the seventh
[1:05:32] there was an open
[1:05:34] door but the bandam says here
[1:05:43] that an Open Door what was it it was the
[1:05:48] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:05:51] Christ not being a second person of a
[1:05:54] trinity but between God himself made
[1:05:57] flesh and R Among Us and the
[1:06:02] Revelation the name of
[1:06:05] Jesus is come back again between these
[1:06:08] two
[1:06:10] ages in between the open door now it is
[1:06:13] a revelation of what he was the
[1:06:17] deity Allelujah
[1:06:19] Hallelujah Jesus is the
[1:06:21] door he is the door of the
[1:06:24] sheep and notice that it speaks now of
[1:06:27] the door opening what is it but a
[1:06:31] revelation of him amen and that
[1:06:34] Revelation is opening up to bring us
[1:06:37] strength to illuminate the word and
[1:06:40] glorify his name amen it was in the
[1:06:43] midst of the two last
[1:06:45] ages that the revelation of the Dy of
[1:06:48] Jesus Christ Blossom before
[1:06:51] us yes we knew he was God
[1:06:54] how else could he be our savior but to
[1:06:57] know that he was only God or God Alone
[1:07:00] that he was the Alpha and the Omega that
[1:07:04] this Jesus was both Lord and Christ
[1:07:07] making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father
[1:07:09] the Son and the Holy Ghost or one person
[1:07:12] that had been lost since the first
[1:07:15] church ages but now we are seen it again
[1:07:19] the revelation of who he was had come
[1:07:21] back amen indeed God head is not a three
[1:07:25] person God with one personality for it
[1:07:28] takes a personality to make a person if
[1:07:31] there's one personality there is but one
[1:07:33] person but they who believe in three
[1:07:35] persons have a three God godhead and are
[1:07:38] guilty of breaking the first commandment
[1:07:41] amen so the Revelation between the six
[1:07:44] church8 and the Seven Church eight was
[1:07:46] the open door yes sir and the open door
[1:07:48] was the revelation of the Supreme deity
[1:07:52] of Jesus Christ coming back back to the
[1:07:54] church
[1:07:57] am
[1:08:00] amen he says again
[1:08:03] here in
[1:08:06] Daniel listen God Daniel you shut up the
[1:08:09] book for thou shall rest and you shall
[1:08:12] stand in the last days in your Lord but
[1:08:15] many of those who turn many to
[1:08:17] righteousness shall outshine the Stars
[1:08:19] forever and
[1:08:21] ever there you are the
[1:08:24] Stars these seven ministers through
[1:08:28] seven Church Ages which consists of
[1:08:32] 2,000 years but Bram is a mathematician
[1:08:38] too these seven ministers or seven stars
[1:08:42] are consisting of 2,000 years from the
[1:08:46] first 2,000 years the anti deluvian
[1:08:50] destruction the second 2,000 years the
[1:08:53] first coming of
[1:08:55] Christ the third 2,000 years the
[1:09:00] six is the second coming of Christ and
[1:09:02] the Millennium the end the seventh are
[1:09:06] you with me in other
[1:09:08] words the first 2,000
[1:09:11] years is the word being destroyed by
[1:09:14] water the next 2,000 years was the
[1:09:17] Savior coming to shed his
[1:09:20] blood the next 2,000 years will be the
[1:09:24] end the seventh is the Millennium amen
[1:09:28] are you through
[1:09:30] church so there's going to be 120
[1:09:34] jubilees let me explain a jubilee is 50
[1:09:39] years so the first 40 Jubilee was the
[1:09:43] first 2,000 years because 40 by 50 is
[1:09:46] 2,000 are you with the church the second
[1:09:50] Jubilee is the
[1:09:52] 80th 80 multip by 50 is
[1:09:57] 4,000 and the last is our time that
[1:10:01] we're about to end and because Noah had
[1:10:03] 120 years and destruction came 120
[1:10:07] jubilees will end man's
[1:10:10] time all
[1:10:14] right before I get into it let me bring
[1:10:16] the church
[1:10:18] memory to the seven Jewish
[1:10:22] feasts that God gave
[1:10:26] Israel for them to keep perpetually now
[1:10:29] these feasts were literally designed for
[1:10:32] the Jewish Nation but it has a spiritual
[1:10:35] application as well amen every time that
[1:10:39] they have the Passover Lamb it was
[1:10:42] supposed to remind them that someday
[1:10:44] there was going to be the real Lamb of
[1:10:46] God that will take away the sins of the
[1:10:50] world so the first feast was the
[1:10:54] Passover the second Feast was the Feast
[1:10:58] of unleavened bread the third was that
[1:11:02] of the wave
[1:11:03] Shea the fourth was
[1:11:06] Pentecost fifth was
[1:11:08] trumpets six was atonement and the
[1:11:12] seventh is
[1:11:15] Tabernacles the first Passover speaks of
[1:11:19] the
[1:11:20] Cross where the sacrifice will be
[1:11:25] Tabernacles speaks of them rejoicing at
[1:11:28] the end when they build
[1:11:32] boots therefore from the Passover to
[1:11:37] Tabernacles is speaking of a period of
[1:11:40] time from the cross to the
[1:11:46] Millennium when you start at the cross
[1:11:49] you don't stop
[1:11:51] there you have to come to
[1:11:55] Pentecost you don't stop there amen
[1:11:58] hallelujah you have to come to
[1:12:05] Tabernacles so in the first three
[1:12:08] feasts with pertains to both Christ and
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:12] church Jesus fulfilled the Passover
[1:12:15] because he was the Passover Lamb
[1:12:19] amen he was the unle bread amen amen
[1:12:23] there was no sin in him but he was made
[1:12:26] sin for us
[1:12:28] am he was the W sheep because he rose
[1:12:31] from the dead on the third
[1:12:34] day and was
[1:12:36] waved after the wave sheath you got to
[1:12:40] count from that day seven sabbaths
[1:12:43] amen seven sabbaths is the seven Church
[1:12:47] ages yes
[1:12:49] sir and the tomorrow after the seven the
[1:12:53] 14 night is actually the Jubilee sir
[1:12:57] which is
[1:12:59] Pentecost now after Pentecost and
[1:13:01] Pentecost this what
[1:13:03] happens Jesus fulfilled the Passover on
[1:13:07] leaven bread and the wave sheath by the
[1:13:11] Feast of Pentecost something happens yes
[1:13:14] sir you have to take two loaves of bread
[1:13:18] with leav in
[1:13:21] them and they had to to set the the
[1:13:24] bread on
[1:13:27] fire the two loaves of bread is
[1:13:31] showing the ministry of men with sin
[1:13:36] yes comprising of both Jews and
[1:13:40] Gentiles but the Holy Ghost Fire will
[1:13:44] consume the
[1:13:46] sin that's why the apostles in the upper
[1:13:49] room the fire has to
[1:13:52] come and Cornelius has to receive the
[1:13:55] same fire they had to bring both Jews
[1:13:58] and Gentiles into one body am therefore
[1:14:02] in Christianity is not a
[1:14:06] race Christianity is about
[1:14:11] Christ there is no Jew or
[1:14:14] Gentile in Christ he made all men one in
[1:14:17] him but the problem called that the
[1:14:19] super
[1:14:22] race
[1:14:26] amen after
[1:14:28] Pentecost the Jews are
[1:14:31] scattered they go back to their various
[1:14:34] homes never to come back again until the
[1:14:39] trumpets therefore we see a
[1:14:41] pattern after the apostolic age after
[1:14:44] the Gentiles everything came in what
[1:14:46] happened Titus scattered
[1:14:49] them they went to all the nations trying
[1:14:51] to pute the gospel India wherever they
[1:14:52] were scattered
[1:14:55] naturally the Jews lost their Homeland
[1:14:58] they were sold as
[1:15:00] slaves therefore Pentecost is
[1:15:04] fulfilled amen yes
[1:15:07] sir Passover is
[1:15:10] fulfilled unleaving bread is
[1:15:13] fulfilled web sheep is
[1:15:16] fulfilled what is not left is
[1:15:19] trumpets atonement and Tabernacle
[1:15:25] and since the Jews will only be gathered
[1:15:28] by the
[1:15:30] trumpets it has to take the trumpets to
[1:15:34] bring the Jews to their Homeland that's
[1:15:41] right the
[1:15:43] trumpets gathers the Jews that's
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:51] atonement give them a recognition of the
[1:15:54] morning of the
[1:16:00] sacrifice the
[1:16:02] trumpets when did they
[1:16:06] sound so brother Bram is trying to let
[1:16:09] us understand that between the Sixth
[1:16:11] Seal and the seventh seal there's an
[1:16:15] interval he want us to watch so let's go
[1:16:18] to Revelation
[1:16:21] 71 the pastor was singing as on the wind
[1:16:24] I said Lord
[1:16:25] Jesus I know the master of the
[1:16:29] wind oh my the song just came so
[1:16:33] good now after these things I saw four
[1:16:38] Angels standing on the four corners of
[1:16:40] the earth and I know people say the
[1:16:43] Earth is round and the Earth is
[1:16:45] round but the Bible say Four
[1:16:48] Corners since people these this are so
[1:16:50] dogmatic that they want everything to be
[1:16:53] be Dam
[1:16:54] imprecision round is also
[1:16:59] Square
[1:17:03] Hallelujah holding the Four Winds of the
[1:17:06] earth that the wind should not blow on
[1:17:09] the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[1:17:15] tree and I saw another Angel ascending
[1:17:18] from the East having the Seal of the
[1:17:21] Living God he cried with a voice to the
[1:17:23] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:17:26] the earth and the Sea saying hurt not
[1:17:29] the Earth neither the sea nor the trees
[1:17:32] till we have sealed the Servants of our
[1:17:35] God in their
[1:17:37] foreheads and they had a
[1:17:41] number these four
[1:17:46] wings wind according to B Bram is
[1:17:52] war
[1:17:55] question
[1:17:57] answers page 9 93 paragraph
[1:18:01] 27 now on the four corners of the Earth
[1:18:04] holding the Four Winds in other words
[1:18:06] here went the winds blowing in the wars
[1:18:09] and strife to come all over the world
[1:18:12] when did that ever happen never until
[1:18:15] the first world war holding the winds
[1:18:18] and they were striving going in to take
[1:18:21] over now Hallelujah but AB Bram is now
[1:18:25] beginning to bring this scripture of
[1:18:26] Revelation
[1:18:28] 71 that it took
[1:18:31] place in this
[1:18:35] generation that the wind was the war
[1:18:38] that never in the world have we had a
[1:18:40] World
[1:18:42] War but in this time there was a war now
[1:18:47] the three
[1:18:49] Wars are the three world wars yes sir it
[1:18:52] is not a repetition of one one thing
[1:18:54] there are three different woes wo wo wo
[1:18:58] maybe you say brother John why you
[1:18:59] saying that look at chapter 9: 12 for a
[1:19:05] second chapter 9:12 say one W is pass
[1:19:09] and behold there come two Wes more
[1:19:12] Hereafter so it is not a repetition of
[1:19:15] one W just going for there are three
[1:19:16] different walls yes sir all right the
[1:19:19] next wo is chapter 14 and
[1:19:26] vers four I
[1:19:32] believe no chapter
[1:19:36] uh chapter 14
[1:19:40] vers 14 is
[1:19:44] it
[1:19:46] that oh sorry chapter 11:14 I'm sorry
[1:19:49] chapter 11:14 so sorry
[1:19:51] please it said the second war is passed
[1:19:55] behold the third war cometh quickly so
[1:19:59] the wars are three different Wars yes
[1:20:02] sir the Bible call them wo but said they
[1:20:05] are Wars amen so if they are Wars then
[1:20:08] they are the first world war second
[1:20:11] world war and the third world war
[1:20:15] amen are you with the
[1:20:20] church since the Jews have been
[1:20:24] Ed and they can only be gathered by the
[1:20:28] trumpets are you with the
[1:20:31] church then the first war if that be the
[1:20:36] first world war then it only sounded for
[1:20:40] one reason to bring the Jewish people
[1:20:44] back to their Homeland
[1:20:46] amen so when the first world war was
[1:20:49] ushered
[1:20:50] in the tur
[1:20:54] were taking over Israel at that time sir
[1:20:57] General Alm from Great Britain had to
[1:21:00] drive them out and Liberate the land of
[1:21:03] Palestine for the first time to come
[1:21:06] under British rule yes so the land was
[1:21:11] liberated but the people had not yet
[1:21:14] come but the people were in Europe
[1:21:16] making money in America making
[1:21:21] money but the name an anointing of
[1:21:25] Hitler to release a
[1:21:29] genocide in a second war or a second
[1:21:32] world war where 6 million of them were
[1:21:35] slaughtered
[1:21:36] yes then the Jews began to look for a
[1:21:39] land of their own you see under uh uh
[1:21:42] Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand in
[1:21:46] Spain it was the Jews after the
[1:21:49] Catholics will not get to be converted
[1:21:50] into Catholicism
[1:21:54] slaughtered millions of
[1:21:56] them and the rich Jews took money
[1:21:59] together and hired Christopher Columbus
[1:22:03] to find a land anywhere in the world for
[1:22:06] them to come and live in it was the
[1:22:08] money of the Jewish people that make
[1:22:11] Christopher Columba discover
[1:22:14] America that's why the principles of
[1:22:17] America is Bible based
[1:22:19] amen are you with me Church
[1:22:24] but now in the second world
[1:22:27] war the Jews including Europe and
[1:22:30] America have no place to go do you know
[1:22:32] that there was a shipload of of of of of
[1:22:34] Jews Coming to America they had to send
[1:22:36] a ship back a Hitler sped
[1:22:41] them there was no place for them but God
[1:22:45] had
[1:22:46] already delivered the land out of the
[1:22:49] Arabs
[1:22:51] hands and now he's going to put the
[1:22:55] people into the
[1:22:58] land amen amen so the
[1:23:02] trumpets gathered the Jewish people back
[1:23:05] to their Homeland in the second world
[1:23:08] war the third world war is
[1:23:12] amadan it is coming yes amen it will be
[1:23:15] fought after the
[1:23:17] tribulation just before the Millennium
[1:23:20] as a matter of fact we fight that battle
[1:23:22] that's right that's right the bride we
[1:23:24] fight it
[1:23:26] amen so now we are living between the
[1:23:30] second wo and the third
[1:23:36] wo since it is the trumpets that
[1:23:39] gathered the Jews brother Bram as a
[1:23:43] prophet of God these people don't know
[1:23:44] what they're talking
[1:23:46] about you got to see a a prophet respect
[1:23:49] him as a prophet take your time and and
[1:23:52] ask for Revelation in what he's saying
[1:23:55] to connect the dots
[1:23:58] together the prophet says
[1:24:00] here that these
[1:24:03] four Angels who were
[1:24:06] sounding their effect was upon the
[1:24:10] ecosystem of the wether inhabit in
[1:24:13] habitation of the Earth the environment
[1:24:15] that we live
[1:24:16] in but what caused it is as a result of
[1:24:20] the three last Wars
[1:24:23] the first world war you know how many
[1:24:26] people
[1:24:27] died and the effect of that
[1:24:30] war affected the Earth in fact it was
[1:24:33] said that the chlorine gas was used or
[1:24:35] the Master Guard was used they had the
[1:24:38] ability to destroy the world at that
[1:24:40] time yes sir but God did not permit it
[1:24:42] the war came to a mysterious
[1:24:45] end they don't know till today who
[1:24:48] commanded the war to
[1:24:51] stop yes they cannot unhal the Earth
[1:24:55] because God has a
[1:25:00] purpose that the Jewish people have to
[1:25:02] come back to their Homeland hold the
[1:25:05] wind Hold the Wall until we have sealed
[1:25:09] the servant of our God in the
[1:25:16] foreheads so the world
[1:25:19] stop and because it's a second w
[1:25:23] the prophet said now listen to be
[1:25:25] carefully
[1:25:26] Church the fifth
[1:25:30] seal
[1:25:32] is the sixth
[1:25:38] trumpet the fifth
[1:25:41] seal is the sixth
[1:25:44] trumpet 200 million
[1:25:48] demons were
[1:25:51] released and it
[1:25:54] anointed
[1:25:55] politics religion demon power to go
[1:26:00] after the Jew to slaughter them and they
[1:26:03] kill six million of
[1:26:05] them are you the
[1:26:08] church the seventh
[1:26:11] trumpet is the Sixth Seal because the
[1:26:15] two prophets are going to come in The
[1:26:18] Sixth Seal in the
[1:26:21] tribulation
[1:26:24] six trumpet fifth
[1:26:26] seal seven
[1:26:28] trumpet Sixth Seal
[1:26:32] correct in
[1:26:34] between the six
[1:26:37] trumpet and the Seven trumpet which is
[1:26:41] the calling of Elijah and Moses Ministry
[1:26:43] in the seven
[1:26:45] trumpet but Bram says it's Revelation
[1:26:50] 10 why because the sixth trumpet is
[1:26:54] Revelations
[1:26:56] 9 the seventh trumpet is Revelations
[1:27:00] 11 between 9 and 11 is revelation
[1:27:06] 10 a gentile
[1:27:09] Prophet to call the Bride of Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ
[1:27:18] out
[1:27:20] therefore six of those trumpets have
[1:27:22] already
[1:27:25] sounded the seven trumpet is for the
[1:27:27] Jewish
[1:27:29] people we are called by the great
[1:27:36] trumpet brother
[1:27:38] John I've said a lot in this short
[1:27:41] time but you
[1:27:43] cannot speak the word if you don't have
[1:27:46] your
[1:27:48] ties therefore we need to get our ties
[1:27:51] to put into the scriptures to make a f
[1:27:54] because we are
[1:27:56] here we are here and we have seen Israel
[1:27:59] in their homeand
[1:28:02] am
[1:28:03] therefore the fifth seal is be uh before
[1:28:10] the
[1:28:11] Rapture The Sixth Seal is after the
[1:28:16] Rapture so we are
[1:28:19] between the fifth and the
[1:28:23] six we are
[1:28:25] here we have something must happened to
[1:28:29] us so why are we
[1:28:32] here if the Jews are in their
[1:28:34] Homeland there is a
[1:28:37] purpose they have been gathered by the
[1:28:41] trumpets preparing for the Feast of
[1:28:46] atonement the Feast of atonement is not
[1:28:50] a recing of the Lamb
[1:28:53] amen it is a mour for the
[1:28:57] sacrifice and where would they mourn and
[1:28:59] say where we receive the
[1:29:02] wounds it will be the two prophets to
[1:29:05] bring on the revelation of
[1:29:08] Calvary that this Jesus Christ Yeshua
[1:29:11] that you killed is the one and the more
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:19] sacrifice because we have already
[1:29:21] believed it
[1:29:25] amen let's take the story of Naomi for a
[1:29:31] second Naomi's husband
[1:29:34] ELC took his family out of the promised
[1:29:38] land into a gentile country because
[1:29:41] things were not doing good in Palestine
[1:29:42] and they just left God to the life story
[1:29:46] of this one man in his family to tie the
[1:29:48] whole Jewish
[1:29:50] Nation I remember remember alimac his
[1:29:53] son Malon and
[1:29:54] chilion died in Gentile
[1:29:58] countries there were a
[1:30:01] type that were killed by Hitler melinian
[1:30:05] ikan and all those people in Jan land
[1:30:09] but the death caused
[1:30:12] them Naomi realizing that she had no
[1:30:15] more hope in a gentle country she's
[1:30:18] looking to come back yes sir
[1:30:24] therefore it took
[1:30:25] death to bring the to
[1:30:28] Palestine it took death to bring the
[1:30:31] Jews back
[1:30:35] home but was Naomi was coming
[1:30:40] back she had two daughters
[1:30:45] in-law Gentile
[1:30:49] women and ask one just go back to your
[1:30:52] families I got nothing to give you I
[1:30:54] can't give birth anymore I got nothing
[1:30:56] in my stomach let's go and serve your
[1:30:58] God one of them said yet it is true when
[1:31:01] I look at you this message when you
[1:31:02] follow it you don't have much
[1:31:05] bye-bye the other one
[1:31:11] said I'm not going
[1:31:14] back I have
[1:31:16] decided I have made a decision Amen in
[1:31:19] good times and in bad times I'm going to
[1:31:22] stay with the message regardless of what
[1:31:24] it is I'm going to go with you seek or
[1:31:28] th your God will be my God and the god
[1:31:33] of Israel is our
[1:31:35] God
[1:31:37] hallelujah your people be my people why
[1:31:41] do we love the Jews because we got a
[1:31:44] spiritual connection with
[1:31:49] them where you die I die
[1:31:54] it's a decision we can never
[1:31:57] reverse so when Naomi was coming back to
[1:32:00] Palestine there was a gentile Woman by
[1:32:03] the name of Ruth coming with
[1:32:06] her now also want you to
[1:32:09] understand the
[1:32:12] Naomi and this where people got get it
[1:32:14] but brandham
[1:32:16] said the day Israel was declared a
[1:32:18] nation now the prophet the angel met him
[1:32:20] many times
[1:32:22] people are looking to only one date to
[1:32:24] say that he made an error in that that's
[1:32:26] your problem what the prophet sees you
[1:32:28] can see that but I believe him I he said
[1:32:30] the very
[1:32:32] day the Israel became a
[1:32:35] nation I was receiving the Commission in
[1:32:38] the
[1:32:39] cave to take a message to the gentile
[1:32:42] people what I'm saying is that as nowy
[1:32:46] was going back to her Homeland God was
[1:32:48] also calling the GLE
[1:32:50] Bri
[1:32:55] and the scripture says in the Book of
[1:32:57] Ruth that Naomi came back to Palestine
[1:33:01] at the beginning of
[1:33:03] harvest this is Harvest Time Church she
[1:33:07] came at the beginning of
[1:33:12] harvest but Ruth was
[1:33:14] married at the end of
[1:33:20] harvest
[1:33:22] the beginning of harvest is when you see
[1:33:25] that the fruits are all coming out is
[1:33:29] the beginning of a new life hope but
[1:33:33] when you harvest it it's
[1:33:35] matured glory be to
[1:33:38] God so we have seen the beginning of the
[1:33:41] Jewish
[1:33:42] people we are about to see the first
[1:33:44] fruit in the hand of 44,000 they are the
[1:33:46] first fruit of God Revelations chapter
[1:33:49] 14 says that
[1:33:52] 144,000 the first fruits you go back
[1:33:54] script and check it amen in
[1:33:58] there we in a Harvest Time church and
[1:34:02] the bride is about to be
[1:34:04] harvested but when Naomi came to the
[1:34:06] land and at the beginning of harvest the
[1:34:11] attention though it was Naomi going back
[1:34:14] home the attention was on a gentile
[1:34:20] woman
[1:34:24] though the Jews have been in their
[1:34:26] Homeland God's attention is to pull the
[1:34:29] bride out of every
[1:34:31] organization thank you
[1:34:34] Lord so Ruth was directed by God to go
[1:34:39] to the field of
[1:34:41] boas who was the lord of the
[1:34:44] Harvest and also a Kingsman
[1:34:50] Redeemer
[1:34:52] the moment boas saw her said who is this
[1:34:56] woman he said she's Ruth the Widow of
[1:35:02] Chilean
[1:35:06] oh give her special
[1:35:11] treatment make sure that she never leave
[1:35:14] this field
[1:35:15] empty if she need anything on purpose
[1:35:18] drop it for her hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:22] in this Harvest Time
[1:35:24] church we are
[1:35:26] feasting special Commandments huj stay
[1:35:30] in boas's field not any other field but
[1:35:34] boas's field and in boas field is stored
[1:35:38] food am if she wants the revelation of
[1:35:42] Jesus Christ give it to her amen if she
[1:35:45] wants B baptism give it to her to
[1:35:48] adoption give it to her whatever she
[1:35:51] needs
[1:35:52] as long as she's in the field Supply her
[1:35:54] need and as long as we are in this field
[1:35:58] our needs have been supplied by
[1:36:02] God don't go nowhere don't go nowhere
[1:36:05] there's nothing anybody's fi everything
[1:36:08] you need is
[1:36:15] here and
[1:36:17] then at the end of
[1:36:20] harvest it was
[1:36:22] Naomi who was going to
[1:36:26] instruct Ruth how to obtain the
[1:36:29] promise there is no promise that we can
[1:36:32] obtain without having the shadow in the
[1:36:34] Old
[1:36:35] Testament blessed be the name of the
[1:36:37] Lord he said today is the wi day he's
[1:36:42] going to
[1:36:43] sleep Mark where he's going to sleep and
[1:36:47] humble yourself and when you get
[1:36:49] there just go under his feet
[1:36:52] pull the scares of His Garment and cover
[1:36:54] yourself when he WS out to see that you
[1:36:57] are there it will be
[1:37:02] over brother we Mark where Jesus
[1:37:06] died we Mar the spot of
[1:37:09] Calvary we they strip him of His Garment
[1:37:12] when we took the Garment it became the
[1:37:14] brighter
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:19] garment and when they saw
[1:37:22] that he said I have to go and make
[1:37:25] everything
[1:37:27] right I got to go to the
[1:37:30] elders and bring
[1:37:32] Redemption and redeem the inheritance of
[1:37:36] eliminate now the person who supposed to
[1:37:39] do that the goel must be a worthy person
[1:37:44] and wealthy
[1:37:48] person somebody
[1:37:50] credible
[1:37:51] willing and also
[1:37:55] wealthy he must have the price to pay
[1:37:58] are you the church amen so he goes down
[1:38:02] there before the elders and that's why
[1:38:05] is so beautiful that this is the day for
[1:38:08] the book of redemption to be open but
[1:38:11] look at the Seven Seals and called it
[1:38:13] the book of
[1:38:15] redemption it is God redeeming you and
[1:38:17] showing you your inheritance in the
[1:38:20] promise because by Ruth marrying boas
[1:38:24] she is entitled to everything boas
[1:38:29] has and church when the seies was open
[1:38:33] to the bride it entitled us to
[1:38:37] [Applause]
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:46] everything so
[1:38:49] Ruth now has been
[1:38:52] redeemed became the
[1:38:54] wife of
[1:38:56] boas and
[1:38:58] Ruth boas and
[1:39:01] Naomi lived off the inheritance of
[1:39:07] ELC are you with me
[1:39:11] church
[1:39:13] we the
[1:39:15] Jews are going to come back and reign in
[1:39:19] Jerusalem the very land amen that the
[1:39:22] Jews left off by the kingsman Redeemer
[1:39:26] it has been redeemed for us
[1:39:29] hallelujah let's take the next
[1:39:32] type
[1:39:35] Joseph but brandham says that
[1:39:38] Joseph is the perfect type of
[1:39:45] Christ he was hated by his
[1:39:47] brothers for no reason because he was
[1:39:50] spiritual
[1:39:51] he could tell them dream that he had and
[1:39:54] the father Jacob loved him above all the
[1:39:57] brothers and he was the 11th
[1:40:00] born does it appear to you why it has to
[1:40:02] be Revelations
[1:40:08] 11 he was the 11th
[1:40:11] born and
[1:40:14] Joseph
[1:40:16] Brothers hated him and they sold him out
[1:40:21] and who gained the
[1:40:25] Gentiles when the Jews hated Jesus who
[1:40:30] gained the Gentiles
[1:40:32] amen and Joseph was put in prison
[1:40:37] because he will not lie with another
[1:40:39] woman a man's
[1:40:43] wife ptif wife was already a married
[1:40:47] woman when you are married to
[1:40:49] organizations
[1:40:53] Jesus want to have this wise virgin not
[1:40:56] somebody's
[1:40:59] wife are you the jurge I hope you
[1:41:03] understand what I'm saying
[1:41:05] spiritually so as he will not mingle
[1:41:08] with organizations who have been married
[1:41:10] and polluted themselves he was
[1:41:13] accused of all kinds of stuff and they
[1:41:16] threw Joseph in
[1:41:19] jail why is in prison he had a baker and
[1:41:24] a battler there but the brother said
[1:41:27] Jesus on Calvary was in prison he had a
[1:41:30] Thief two theves on the
[1:41:33] cross Joseph in
[1:41:36] prison one was saved the other was
[1:41:40] condemned Jesus in prison on on the
[1:41:43] cross one was saved the other was
[1:41:45] condemned amen Joseph came out of prison
[1:41:49] and sat on the right hand of Pharaoh
[1:41:52] Jesus came out of prison and be start
[1:41:54] the right hand of the father amen the
[1:41:57] Tes are
[1:41:59] correct but that was not the
[1:42:01] end when Joseph came out of
[1:42:04] prison Pharaoh had a dream the reason
[1:42:07] why he came out of prison he interpreted
[1:42:09] a dream of
[1:42:11] pharaoh a dream of farming for seven
[1:42:15] years seven years of plenty and seven
[1:42:19] years of farming
[1:42:21] he has to
[1:42:22] keep the plenty to
[1:42:25] overcome the famine and there's a
[1:42:28] spiritual drought in the land right now
[1:42:31] that the only place that we can feed is
[1:42:34] the message of the
[1:42:41] hour when he interpreted Pharaoh's dream
[1:42:45] pharaoh changed his
[1:42:48] name from Joseph to zaniah
[1:42:53] pah that meant a
[1:42:56] savior so in
[1:42:59] Egypt Joseph has a new
[1:43:02] name as long as he remain
[1:43:06] Joseph every Jew would have seen him and
[1:43:10] as long as Jehovah remain Jehovah the
[1:43:12] Jews have no problem but when he told
[1:43:15] them I came in my father's name they
[1:43:17] took out
[1:43:19] stones
[1:43:22] see but the Gentiles love that name How
[1:43:26] Sweet the name of Jesus sounds in the
[1:43:28] Believers here it's like music in our
[1:43:32] ears it soes our wounds heals our
[1:43:41] wounds so his name is changed so
[1:43:44] everybody knows him as a savior
[1:43:47] Zephaniah
[1:43:49] bah
[1:43:51] and the drought it fine
[1:43:55] it so God is going to put a pressure on
[1:43:58] the Jews to go look for
[1:44:00] food soam says that this same gospel
[1:44:04] that we have believed will go back to
[1:44:06] them glory
[1:44:09] amen so the brothers
[1:44:12] came the first time they approach Joseph
[1:44:16] Joseph recognized
[1:44:17] them but they could not recognize
[1:44:21] him and the reason why they could not
[1:44:24] recognize him he was standing in their
[1:44:26] midst but they could not see him because
[1:44:28] of a name
[1:44:36] change you see Church there's power in
[1:44:39] the
[1:44:40] name what I'm saying is that lack of
[1:44:43] revelation of the name blinded them
[1:44:47] amen the revealing of the name will open
[1:44:51] their eyes because the two prophets will
[1:44:54] have the revelation of the father's name
[1:44:57] written on their
[1:45:00] foreheads
[1:45:02] hallu and that revelation of the name of
[1:45:05] Jesus Christ is what has blinded
[1:45:08] ludia as long as they have a
[1:45:11] theological concept of Jesus Christ as a
[1:45:14] second or third person they are
[1:45:17] blind amen but we our eyes have happened
[1:45:21] because the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:45:24] Christ has come back to us we know that
[1:45:27] God we serve Jehovah of the Old
[1:45:30] Testament is Jesus Christ of the
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:37] new so think of
[1:45:40] it when he saw
[1:45:43] them it was
[1:45:46] incomplete somebody didn't
[1:45:49] come
[1:45:54] Benjamin Benjamin doesn't
[1:45:56] come I will not reveal
[1:46:00] myself but AB Bram said
[1:46:03] 144,000 is little
[1:46:08] Benjamin oh glory be to God
[1:46:14] Amen so he played a prank on
[1:46:17] them that you people have been
[1:46:19] ungrateful took Simeon locked Simeon up
[1:46:24] he said when you bring the complete
[1:46:28] tribe then you'll get what you
[1:46:33] want when they went and told the father
[1:46:35] that Benjamin should come Jacob said you
[1:46:37] took Joseph why Benjamin why did you
[1:46:40] tell him that I have another brother
[1:46:41] said the question he
[1:46:44] asked he said Dad if we don't take him
[1:46:47] we all be dead they got to take shorty
[1:46:49] and everything
[1:46:52] Brothers it was
[1:46:54] Benjamin I said it is
[1:46:56] Benjamin Benjamin is the one now
[1:46:58] remember that Benjamin was not part of
[1:47:01] the
[1:47:02] conspirators
[1:47:04] am he was not part of those that
[1:47:08] conspired to sell a
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:14] brother so God is looking for
[1:47:17] somebody to stand for their behal am
[1:47:25] and then when Benjamin came he set them
[1:47:28] on their tribal order from ruin to
[1:47:32] Benjamin and brought Benjamin closer to
[1:47:35] him but you see brother Bram said and
[1:47:38] this why I'm coming
[1:47:40] in the trumpets gathered Joseph's
[1:47:44] brothers to
[1:47:48] him Joseph will have to reveal himself
[1:47:51] to his
[1:47:52] brothers he cannot do that because at
[1:47:55] this time Joseph was a married
[1:47:57] man when Joseph was in Israel he was not
[1:48:03] married but when he came out of prison
[1:48:06] he was given a gentile
[1:48:09] wife when Jesus was in Palestine he was
[1:48:13] not married yes but when he died on the
[1:48:17] cross he died to obtain his bride the
[1:48:20] Bri was inside of
[1:48:24] him and the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[1:48:29] gentile I said Jesus married a
[1:48:37] gentile you know I see people say that
[1:48:40] I'm a Jew and I'm a Jew and I'm glad I'm
[1:48:43] a
[1:48:45] gentile hallelujah hallelujah because
[1:48:49] the brothers where are they they still
[1:48:53] blind because it doesn't matter how much
[1:48:55] I love my brothers you know once I got
[1:48:57] my wife I said goodbye I took my wife
[1:48:59] and
[1:49:00] [Applause]
[1:49:04] godallah hi brother hi brother my
[1:49:07] brother don't stay with me my house my
[1:49:08] wife
[1:49:10] does so which one do you want to be his
[1:49:13] wife or
[1:49:17] brother you so don't boasting I'm a Jew
[1:49:21] and I'm a Jew and I'm a Jew Thank God
[1:49:24] I'm a
[1:49:25] asate a gentile
[1:49:31] wife now this woman
[1:49:34] asth is the daughter of a
[1:49:38] priest Joseph loved
[1:49:41] her they had two
[1:49:45] kids Ephraim
[1:49:48] man and
[1:49:52] he want to show himself to his brothers
[1:49:56] so
[1:49:57] bad he cannot do that why the Gentile
[1:50:01] woman was
[1:50:03] present but said the marriage take place
[1:50:07] here amen we are married to Christ here
[1:50:12] amen as a matter of fact he says that
[1:50:15] the marriage certificate is the Seven
[1:50:18] Seals Hallelujah
[1:50:20] invisible union he said you are wearing
[1:50:23] the wedding Bond of
[1:50:28] Grace the Rapture will go to the
[1:50:31] supper the Millennium is the
[1:50:40] honeymoon are you married to
[1:50:43] him then why can you break a covenant if
[1:50:46] you're married to him I said could not
[1:50:48] break a covenant with Joseph he loved
[1:50:52] Joseph she was loyal to
[1:50:56] him
[1:50:58] now for him Joseph to reveal himself to
[1:51:01] the
[1:51:04] brothers
[1:51:06] asth take the
[1:51:08] children and go to the Palace in other
[1:51:11] words get out of my presence honey
[1:51:17] stay at the marriage supper just go in
[1:51:19] the palace down there just enjoy
[1:51:20] yourself I got some business to take
[1:51:22] care of here so when Joseph had to
[1:51:25] reveal himself to the brothers the wife
[1:51:28] was not present amen amen and for Jesus
[1:51:32] to be revealed to the Jews we will not
[1:51:35] be
[1:51:36] here and the reason why we will not be
[1:51:38] here is because we have already been
[1:51:41] married by the word hallelujah and
[1:51:45] because we are married he has a right to
[1:51:48] take his wife where he want
[1:51:59] to
[1:52:01] therefore the Feast of
[1:52:03] trumpets is the Gathering of Joseph's
[1:52:06] brothers to
[1:52:08] Joseph in between Joseph revealing
[1:52:11] himself and the Gathering there's a
[1:52:14] Rapture that takes
[1:52:17] place Revelation 16
[1:52:35] I'm going to go into this very soon but
[1:52:37] here brother brand I'm talk from verse
[1:52:38] 13 I uh verse 12 and the sixth Angel
[1:52:41] poured out his vial upon the great river
[1:52:44] Euphrates and the waters thereof was
[1:52:46] dried up that the way of the king of the
[1:52:49] East might be prepared heard I saw three
[1:52:51] unclean spirits like frogs come out of
[1:52:53] the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth
[1:52:55] of the Beast out of the mouth of the
[1:52:56] false prophet for they are spirits of
[1:52:58] devils working miracles which go forth
[1:53:00] onto the kings of the earth and of the
[1:53:03] whole earth to gather them to the Battle
[1:53:05] of that great day of Our God Almighty
[1:53:06] which is the third wo or
[1:53:08] amaden verse
[1:53:10] 15 while this Gathering is going forth
[1:53:14] to gather all the kings of the earth
[1:53:16] together for that great battle coming
[1:53:18] behold I come as the
[1:53:20] thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth
[1:53:23] His Garment lest he walk naked and they
[1:53:26] see verse 16 and he gathered them
[1:53:29] together into a place called in the
[1:53:30] Hebrew tongue aadan are you with me
[1:53:33] church so in between
[1:53:37] aadin and the Gathering is he come like
[1:53:40] a thief
[1:53:42] Amen brother Bram said the Rapture will
[1:53:44] be a sudden secret catting
[1:53:48] away
[1:53:51] he said if 500 people came missing from
[1:53:53] the earth they not even know anything
[1:53:56] about
[1:53:59] it let me uh just say something that may
[1:54:02] be shocking to you
[1:54:04] but I don't think around the world in
[1:54:06] the message we are we are even more than
[1:54:14] 150,000 you say brother John why do you
[1:54:16] say that now now all of us who are here
[1:54:19] let me just ask a question
[1:54:20] question how many message Believers live
[1:54:23] in the area where you
[1:54:27] live at your workplace or your
[1:54:30] school how many message Believers are in
[1:54:33] your
[1:54:36] workplace take your whole vicinity your
[1:54:38] area where you
[1:54:39] live you might be the only one
[1:54:42] there at your work you might be the only
[1:54:45] one at your school may be two
[1:54:50] that is the way we are scattered in the
[1:54:51] world but say you look at the
[1:54:55] darkness you see one little light say
[1:54:57] believer that
[1:55:04] walking it makes you count yourself
[1:55:08] worthy that you are special that amidst
[1:55:10] this Darkness God will pull you out to
[1:55:13] be the light to reflect
[1:55:18] him
[1:55:21] he comes like a
[1:55:28] thief what does a thief
[1:55:31] do he come to
[1:55:34] steal
[1:55:36] kill and
[1:55:39] destroy so he
[1:55:41] comes said to steal his wife like Romeo
[1:55:44] and
[1:55:48] Juliet take his lover
[1:55:52] away and after that he's coming to
[1:55:56] destroy them who destroy the

[1:56:25] brothers is the Feast of
[1:56:30] atonement in the Feast of
[1:56:32] atonement they are not going to kill
[1:56:35] Joseph again they are going to have a
[1:56:38] revelation of what they
[1:56:40] rejected the one they rejected is going
[1:56:42] to be their savior amen he told them you
[1:56:46] bow I saw the moon the stars bow before
[1:56:49] for me and they kill me because of that
[1:56:52] but now they're going to do

[1:57:17] day in that room see said I told you
[1:57:20] Brothers I told you you see
[1:57:23] that they said now we know we are
[1:57:26] finished you're going to kill us he said
[1:57:27] no no no no no no he said you me it for
[1:57:30] evil but God had me for all the trials
[1:57:35] to prepare me to save the household of
[1:57:37] Israel amen because if I had not come
[1:57:40] would have all perished in a
[1:57:42] drought you meant it for evil but God
[1:57:46] meant it for
[1:57:47] good and Jesus took love to conquer
[1:57:54] hatred you know sometime we talk about
[1:57:56] these things is very tough for a man
[1:57:58] that really will destroy your name and
[1:58:01] and say any kind of to come back and
[1:58:02] tell him that brother I love you Joseph
[1:58:06] did that and Jesus had to do that on the
[1:58:09] cross he said father forgive them for
[1:58:12] they don't know what they doing because
[1:58:14] they doing that in blindness and
[1:58:16] ignorance Hallelujah therefore the of
[1:58:20] atonement is the recognition of
[1:58:25] Joseph it's not a killing of
[1:58:28] Joseph it's a revelation of the men they
[1:58:32] rejected in the Feast of atonement is
[1:58:35] the morning for the
[1:58:37] sacrifice for them to have a revelation
[1:58:41] of the Jesus they rejected amen that he
[1:58:45] is the savior of the world Amen and they
[1:58:48] have to bow
[1:58:49] at the name of Jesus at the feet of
[1:58:55] Jesus Oh glory be to God and did you
[1:58:59] realize that because they accepted
[1:59:01] atonement they had a privilege to enjoy
[1:59:05] the
[1:59:06] benefits of
[1:59:08] Joseph's position for them to live in
[1:59:10] Egypt with
[1:59:11] peace they were treated with
[1:59:14] royalty until a pharaoh came who did not
[1:59:17] know them but until that time they were
[1:59:21] given all kind of privileges because
[1:59:24] Joseph was
[1:59:25] there
[1:59:27] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:59:29] Lord church so we are living at a time

[2:01:05] to14 if you want to put that down it's a
[2:01:09] be sure that when you go home you can

[2:01:59] born at free unclean spirits individual
[2:02:02] Spirit are you getting it they look back
[2:02:05] to NAIA where the Trinity doctr was born
[2:02:07] at not in the Bible and these brothers
[2:02:09] are denying the godhead that brother
[2:02:11] bram's teaching was a error of the
[2:02:13] godhead and the should go to Trinity

[2:02:18] yourself

[2:02:46] the time but it wasn't my manifested
[2:02:50] until between the sixth and seventh vial
[2:02:52] just before the seals open to reveal
[2:02:56] it now you know sometime people don't
[2:02:58] realize that the seals when we say it
[2:03:01] was opened we are not telling you that
[2:03:03] they manifesting now because the first
[2:03:05] seal already
[2:03:07] happened second seal already happened
[2:03:11] third seal already happened we are
[2:03:13] living in the shadows of the
[2:03:15] fourth are you me Church the fifth seal
[2:03:18] is history now it happened in 1939 to
[2:03:23] 1945 the six seal is coming the
[2:03:26] tribulation the seven seal brings him
[2:03:28] back to
[2:03:29] Earth to do what to get the wife in
[2:03:33] marriage because the servant seal is a
[2:03:36] brighter seal
[2:03:41] amen hallelujah yes but brandham says
[2:03:44] that it's like a
[2:03:46] rocket is the end time seal
[2:03:49] it blasts from one thing opens into the
[2:03:52] next open into the next and even ushers
[2:03:56] us into the Millennium that's what this
[2:03:59] seven seal is all
[2:04:01] about amen it's a coming
[2:04:04] down to pick up a bride in
[2:04:07] marriage give her a seal the Covenant
[2:04:13] Hallelujah put her in the Rapture and
[2:04:15] the body
[2:04:15] change and bring her back all is
[2:04:21] about in fact in Christ in the midst of
[2:04:24] God revealed he said it's a three for
[2:04:27] purpose one of
[2:04:30] Christ the church and taking us to
[2:04:35] Eden the seven seal don't
[2:04:38] stop is the end time steel taking us on
[2:04:42] we are in it amen
[2:04:44] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:04:47] notice the were all there all the time
[2:04:50] but was not manifest until now for in
[2:04:52] the message of the seventh angel the
[2:04:54] mysteries of God will be known all these
[2:04:58] traran and false baptisms and everything
[2:05:00] else God help us to see what truth is
[2:05:03] and not to think that somebody is trying
[2:05:05] to say
[2:05:07] something in
[2:05:10] closing the first miracle Jesus
[2:05:13] did was at a
[2:05:17] wedding
[2:05:21] the first miracle Christ
[2:05:23] did was being invited to a
[2:05:27] wedding the last miracle he has to do is
[2:05:31] to finish the
[2:05:37] wedding and when he went to the
[2:05:40] wedding something took
[2:05:45] place they were lacking something
[2:05:51] you don't make weddings and get short of
[2:05:55] drink what kind of embarrassment is
[2:05:59] that you go to a wedding to enjoy the
[2:06:01] wedding only water is there they lack
[2:06:05] wine and then what they lack is what
[2:06:09] Jesus had to
[2:06:12] supply and then Mary went
[2:06:15] ahead and tried to give instructions
[2:06:19] and then Jesus said woman what have I
[2:06:21] got to do with you that's no
[2:06:24] insult but the church cannot give
[2:06:29] Revelation mary caught the revelation of
[2:06:32] the preeminent one standing in their
[2:06:35] midst and said you see him whatever he
[2:06:39] tells you do do
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:41] it Mary was directing them to him but
[2:06:45] Abram directed us to Christ the pastors
[2:06:48] will give us to Christ who is Christ but
[2:06:51] said Christ is the revealed
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:56] word he said if Jesus Christ should come
[2:06:58] today with nail scared hands I will not
[2:07:00] believe him because that's not the way
[2:07:02] he said he will come yes
[2:07:06] sir Christ is the revelation of the word
[2:07:10] amen so Mary said now everybody don't
[2:07:13] look at me now Look to Him that's why
[2:07:14] the Catholic church I'm sorry we can't
[2:07:16] look at
[2:07:17] you
[2:07:19] we have to look at Jesus
[2:07:21] now they said we should go through Mary
[2:07:24] Mary said go through
[2:07:26] Jesus
[2:07:32] Hallelujah and then Jesus said what do
[2:07:34] you have here they said
[2:07:38] pots what are
[2:07:40] pots how many of them
[2:07:43] six the scripture says in
[2:07:47] John chapter 2 is
[2:07:49] it let's get there for a
[2:07:55] second John two I believe it
[2:08:09] is and the third day there was a
[2:08:11] marriage in K of Galilee and the mother
[2:08:14] of Jesus was there and both Jesus was
[2:08:16] called and his disciples to do the
[2:08:20] marriage and when they wanted wine the
[2:08:23] mother of Jesus said unto him they have
[2:08:26] no
[2:08:27] wine Jesus said unto her woman what have
[2:08:30] I what have I to do with thee mine hour
[2:08:33] is not yet come his mother says unto the
[2:08:36] servant whatsoever he says unto you do
[2:08:39] it and there were said there watch the
[2:08:42] six water pots of stone after the manner
[2:08:46] of the purifying of the Jews containing
[2:08:49] two or three fing a pieces it was for
[2:08:52] the purifying of the Jews six water
[2:08:56] pots standing for the purification of
[2:09:00] the
[2:09:02] Jews uh just let me get what brother was
[2:09:05] saying here about it and then I just

[2:09:20] pots is a type of the six seal where the
[2:09:25] Jews are going to be
[2:09:28] purified are you with me
[2:09:32] church but they
[2:09:35] needed
[2:09:38] something to open their understanding
[2:09:42] and Jesus said fill it with
[2:09:46] water they fill the C with
[2:09:49] water and Jesus said
[2:09:52] draw the water became
[2:09:55] wine when a man is
[2:09:58] truly baptized with the Holy
[2:10:02] Spirit what comes out of you is the
[2:10:04] stimulation by revelation of the word
[2:10:08] that's the reason why you are all
[2:10:09] worshiping this morning the way you are
[2:10:11] doing the reason why you enjoy the word
[2:10:13] of God is because you are been
