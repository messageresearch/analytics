different way but we know that the two Christmas of Christ being born it's everyday in our lives amen we have to get him reborn in our lives in our hearts you know he went that day on the cross of Calvary he died so he could be born in us amen so each and every day we can leave knowing that is Christ who is living within us amen that is just open with a word of Prayer do you have any father we

name we pray believing amen hallelujah I mean you're happy to be the house of the Lord this evening amen let us open our Bibles to the Book of Luke chapter 24 verse 49 I don't intend to take too long this evening Luke 24 chapter Luke chapter 24 verse 49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you may take our seat continue reading well - you're seated and we see that this was Jesus before he was gone before the Ascension and he was talking to his disciples saying you go wait in Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high he was telling them to wait until the day of Pentecost after he would come back and he would come and meet them a man would like to read another scripture in the book of Acts chapter 2 verse 1 to 4 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and take not as it set upon each of them and they were were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance you just want to take not unchopped ur three essays and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it's set upon each of them amen I'd like to speak on a small subject entitled personal experience here if you look at the wording of the Bible he says and it's set upon each of them and we know that they were about 120 disciples in the in the Upper Room as they were waiting for the for the Holy Ghost to come upon them as Christ had promised and here it was not a matter of a group but it was an individual affair Christ split all the cloven tongues of fire for each and every one of them so that each and every one could get a personal encounter with God amen and so what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ coming to live within us we know in a lot of different places some schools of thoughts they they they explain the Holy Ghost to be some sort of emotion emotion or some theology that after you go through some school or after you go through a certain number of courses or anything then you have the Holy Ghost and they teach it amen but we know that's not right the prophet of God told us amen that the whole a ghost is Christ himself coming down to dwell within us amen we know in the Old Testament he was God above above them he will speak from above and he will speak through the prophets when God had a message for his people he had to speak from above so he was God above he was Jehovah a man but that was not good enough for him he did he he had a revered him he had a mediator which was a prophet to get to his people and he wanted to get closer to them that wasn't working out so well once he was up there and then he desired to come down on earth to condescend and become a man and dwell among us and he came down and God prepared a body called Jesus Christ and that's where he decided to dwell in amen and then he walked on the face of the earth grew up with people communicated with people he wanted to feel how it is being a man amen and he got into contact with his disciples he was leaving but still he thought that was gonna be better but it was just not close enough because even as he was walking with them they still had no idea who he was and that was not good enough amen then he devised a plan he wanted to get closer to people and the only way he could do it he had to come and dwell within us himself amen so that each and every one of us we have a personal relationship with God amen many people they take Christianity as a religion but it is not a religion because their religion you can get in and out of it but it is not a religion Christianity is a relationship with God amen until when he comes and lives within you he reflects himself from within you and everybody sees that you are acting like Christ you know when they called them the first time they called them Christians it was a nickname because they say they were acting like Christ they were showing all the characteristics of Christ that's why they say their christ-like so they are Christians amen from the very original day of Pentecost and now coming down through the ages us we are when we received the Holy Ghost - Christian true Christianity is when we reflect the life of Christ from within us amen wherever we live whenever we are talking we are supposed to show the life of Christ and since it is a relationship with God we do not try to live Christianity but it is automatic amen so Christ decided to come in and live within us to live within the people that's why he commanded them and he said you go tarry ye in Jerusalem until you've been endued with power from on high because he knew that without this power without the Holy Ghost they wouldn't be true Christians they couldn't be true witnesses of God because for you to be a true witness of God he has to be within you amen so that's why he decided to come in and dwell within them and from that day on they were Christians God living within them amen and now this is the book of Acts the prophet of God calls it the book of the book of the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles so there was Christ working in the Apostles so it is the book of Acts of the Holy Ghost that was using the people amen so it was the Holy Ghost that was doing the work using the bodies of people because we know that God needs a body for him to you for him to work on earth amen even the devil as well he uses people so it is your own choice it is our own decision on whom we want to yield to amen either to yield to God or to yield to the devil because either way for that to work for God to work he uses that person for the devil to work to do his job he uses a person a man so we got to decide whom we want to be yielded to a man whom we want to build the relationship but now we are called the Bride of Christ a man and we know we are bride and we have that relationship with God the moment we have that Holy Ghost within us we know we are connected amen so after now he came in to live within the disciples that's when the book of Acts started and we have all these miracles that's when everything started but now the book of Acts does not have miracles only it also have persecutions of the Christians because the moment you received the Holy Ghost you have declared with the devil that it's time for war you have made the lines clear that you are they and I'm here we are not on the same side before you receive the Holy Ghost you are trying to live a Christian life you know the devil is not really sure if you're he's or not because sometimes you were there you're neither here not there but the moment you receive the Holy Ghost and you make your decision to follow Christ then that's when you know you have declared war with the devil that's when before before the crucifixion of Christ Peter was so scared and he rejected Christ three times it's because he didn't have the Holy Ghost yet he didn't have that courage and they didn't persecute him they left him like that but after the day of Pentecost after they started performing all these miracles healing people saying silver and gold have I none but what I have I give to you that's when they saw that these people are dangerous then they threw him into prison and started persecuting them because they had drawn lines with the devil to say you are they and I am here amen so when Jesus was walking on the face of the earth all the whole host of Hell they were looking at one man they had to I believe in modern day if we're looking at it they would have they would have a screen and a little track or one dot trying to see where he is at wherever Christ is then they have a meeting that man you see where he is going we have to go and disrupt his plans because we know wherever he is going there's a healing that's going to take place we'll know whenever he's going we know there are thousands of demons that are going to be cast out we know wherever he is going demons are going to be in trouble wherever he is going people are going to be saved so they they were all looking at this one little dot on this you screen probably under on the map of on the map of Jerusalem Israel wherever he went they were keeping track then they thought after crucifixion and they thought they devised a plan to kill him and after that they thought it was done the screen went blank they said we have finished it it is done amen but then after it doesn't a couple of a couple of weeks they just hit pan dam pandemonium happening in Jerusalem and they just pops 120 different dots now they were now they now had more trouble after the day of Pentecost than when Jesus was there because now 120 people we're now doing the work that Jesus was doing while she was by himself so Jesus Christ now he had he had most success using the diffusing of the disciples the 120 and we are told that that very day three thousand people were baptized so it was all a mess they didn't know whom to look at what to watch because the whole screen was full of dots just crisscross in the whole the whole country amen and that is the effect when Christ comes in you so for him to be rib for him to be born in each and every one of them he had to die so that like he said in the in the scriptures that for a seed to come forth it has to be buried so that it brings forth too many amen so when he was buried after he died on the cross of Calvary he was doing that so you and I we could rise up with him amen when he rose we rose up with him not he was no longer just doing it by himself but doing it through each and every one of us amen so it is our duty to keep the devil to keep the demons on their feet hallelujah so we need this Holy Ghost it is very important for us to have it because that's what makes us Christians right amen and now the Prophet talks about the importance of the of the Holy Ghost I read he says that's what the church needs tonight it's just stop starting so much theology and get down to the altar and pray until a personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the darkness and gives a new vision amen you see he says you shall receive the Holy Ghost and fire you know the Holy Ghost is fire it burns out all the dross it burns out all the dirt and it burns out all your past amen whatever that you did in the past it doesn't exist no more because the the Holy Ghost and fire it is the most powerful purifier there is a man and when it burns all that it's no longer exists when the devil the accuser comes to you to say you did this you look at it and you say I don't see it it never happened I never did it in the first place a man this is what the Holy Ghost does for you and we amen so each and every day we leave knowing that we're we are living holy lives cling to God amen because we have nothing that condemns us of everything that we did it is attributed back to the devil because Paul tells us that in the New Testament that we are not imputed to sin sin is not imputed to us amen that's why the holy ghost does for us I read another quote from the prophet of God he says now look now to you people it's absolutely essential and the necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection now watch God cannot break his laws we know that he follows his laws so he's telling us he is emphasizing how it is important since essential necessary compelling and compulsory you see without the Holy Ghost we cannot make it to the resurrection then what are we doing if we are not striving to make it into the resurrection you you try to leave your holy life but then you don't get the Holy Ghost you die you don't make it into the resurrection then what was all the trouble for amen so we have to strive and thrive to make sure we get the Holy Ghost because this is the person of Christ himself coming to live within us and when you have the Holy Ghost the Christa Christian life becomes automatic you don't have to think if this is right or wrong your body you're the Holy Ghost puts your whole body under subjection to everything that you were supposed to do when you try to say something you're not supposed to it will check you to say that's not right make it right when you try to do something that's wrong it will check you to say no that's not right because it is God that's living within us amen so when wherever our feet walks to that's where God wants us to go amen and he can never let us go in wrong places that's right you see when you get the Holy Ghost it it is all a matter of nature change it changes your whole nature into a brand-new man amen it's not like a ship that's wearing a wolf's clothing that he can take at any point in time it's not like that and it's not just a makeup that we come in with you somebody comes and sit they and we tell them you know what now you're a Christian you have to do this you have to do that do this and do that that's one other thing where we get it wrong we think that Christianity is a list of do's and don'ts but that's not what it is because when you exhaust that list you do a lot of are the wrongs that's not there but it is a life amen such that you do not have to think what's wrong what's not right you find yourself doing what's right but we are humans and we make mistakes Paul says I die every day I die daily but when you die every day you rise up amen because we are we are righteous people and a righteous person is one that when they fall they rise up they don't stay on the ground so whenever we make those mistakes we get up and we get going so the Holy Ghost changes your whole nature it's not something that is taught we do not teach the Holy Ghost it's the same like taking a pig a hug you take it out from from from the pen or whatever they stay you you brush it up nicely put some ribbons on it keep it in the house it's really good it's so smart for however long it is in the house but as soon as it rains you open up the door it will run straight into the puddle and lose you start rolling into the mud and what have you done you see you just dressed it up but what the Holy Ghost does it removes the whole nature such that when you when you are cleaned up and when you go into the house of God when you leave your appetite is different you do not want to go back to the mud to the murk that way you used to be because it is a whole nature that has been changed amen so that's why we the Holy Ghost because it's not something that's made up or something that is thought but it is a lifestyle it is a new lifestyle because you're like life your nature has been changed a man you see the prophet of God said and as long as that hog remains a hog his nature is a hog he'll go right back to that wallow so that will never change for life or in life to change you have to get the nature change amen to remove that nature because we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and so we have we have the nature of the serpent in the Garden of Eden amen when when the origin of Cino occurred that's when that's how we all came through so we have that nature within us but now that's when we need God the second birth so that it comes and removes that nature that's that the first birth gave unto us so that we can be reborn and become Christians amen and be reborn by Christ hallelujah and now a lot of people and many a times we get under this pressure and this notion that we cannot make mistakes and we think that we are supposed to be holier than thou but it doesn't work like that we are all humans and we are bound to fail no matter how strong of a Christian you are so long you are in this body we are going to get tempted so long you are in this flesh you are still going to get tempted the only time we are not going to we are going to stop being tempted is when we have this body change amen so until then the fight is on we keep on going amen but that doesn't draw us back because we know that the Bible tells us that there is no temptation that's uncommon to man every trial that is set before you before it was set you already given the power to overcome it amen so you go through it and when you fail you realize and you say you go to God you pray and you say god I failed it this time may you please grant me the strength next time so that I overcome it next time when you come up you come out as a victor you come out victorious as an overcomer amen because that's what we are we are meant to be overcomers because in psalms david said when afflictions come on the righteous he will deliver out of some of them out of them all when afflictions come on the righteous he would deliver out of them all and we are the righteous of God earlier on we said a righteous person doesn't mean somebody who doesn't sin a righteous person is one when they sin they get back up again amen if we look into the Bible and try to count the number of sins and wrong things that Saul and David did the gravity of the sins that David did are worse than the ones that Saul did but God said I am the seed of David and he says David is a man after my own heart amen why is that but he committed most sins and his his all the generations after him were given the kingdom but so when he made one mistake when he failed to obey the kingdom was taken away from was taken away from his family but he just did one mistake why is that because David was a righteous man every time he fell down he got back up he had that thing he had that God had placed something within him that whenever he was drawn further away from God he had that longing to want to come back to God amen because of God had pleased in him because oh he was a righteous man so a righteous man whenever one Falls you get up and you get going now we have a promise to us that if we are righteous whenever afflictions come upon us God will deliver out of he will deliver us out of them all so whenever you come across afflictions that you think you cannot get out of you go to God and to point at the scripture and you say Lord your word says when afflictions come upon me you said you would deliver me out of it because the word is not the word the word is what God said and God never lies so you got to hold him accountable for the word you say Lord this is what I see in your word may you please fulfill it in my life because I have done that which you require of me I'm trying to live a righteous life for you amen and he will always come through for you amen you know the the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much like we spoken last Saturday in last Sunday when you are a righteous man when you pray you have the main line you get priority it says okay you can put that one on pause you can put that one on pause let's listen to that one because you are you pray availeth much amen God will listen to you because you are a righteous man so whenever you follow up get up rise up and get going amen that's the definition of the righteous man God will always provide a way out and we know that through these temptations trials and fallings that's how we get perfected because we are told that that Christ although he was a son he learned obedience through suffering so the sufferings are the ones that made up his nature to mate however he got to being the perfect being that he was it was due to the suffering that he went through and although he was a son of God he went through that so we offspring of God we sons of God we have to go through that as well because Christ was the first ship waving that in as much as this one has come to maturity we are also coming through that and so we are taught to be perfect as he was perfect and so we are perfected by this trials tribulations and temptations so counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations Amen because they are meant to perfect you because that's what Christ wants and when he is going to come back he's going to he is coming back for a perfect bride but perfect doesn't mean you don't you don't do wrong you cannot do wrong you can do but you will fix it as soon as you do amen and he looks at you and he say you are blameless he looks at you and he says you are spotless amen you see that's how we get to be come into the state of the perfect man virtue knowledge temperance patience it comes with time being patient with your with your brothers you know first time somebody some somebody offends you you just get off right quick then you you reflect back to it and you say there was a bit extra you pray to God lord please give me more patience with my brothers next time it happens you let it go next time else something happens you let it go then you are building yourself God is building you to being a perfect person amen and it is a victory character is a victory God does not put you through a pipe and take you out through the other you have to strive you have to fight for you to get it amen and when Christ is going to come he's going to try and find he's looking to come and get the perfect bride that's what he is coming for he comes for something that looks like him amen it's like the gold the gold purifiers when they go and mind the gold it is it has so much impurities within it but because it has impurities the gold miner does not trash it it has a lot of value but he takes it and then starts purifying it until he or she can see their face in the gold when they see their own reflection then they can say it is now pure amen so those trials those tribulations that you are going to count it all joy because it is for your perfection Amen God is working on you he is removing those impurities he is removing impatience he is removing that lying after some time you say oh I used to lie but I lied no more why because he is perfecting you each and every day Amen you are getting closer to being what God is like a man and slowly he's removing all those impurities until he can see himself within you and he sees his own reflection coming up from you and he can say that's my bride amen we are cause we are cold people who are called by his name and he is Jesus Christ and since we are bride we are mrs. Jesus amen is that right so that's what he is going to come forth he's going to come for a bride that is perfect so count it all joy because all it is working out in your favor that's what he is coming back for amen so you do not have to worry there is nothing that's added to the gold when it's gotten it's just taken out as it is with the dirt that is it has and it is purified and the impurity is removed so whatever that you need God has given you no need to worry that I'm lacking this or I'm lacking that just as you are God justified you prophet of God a likens justification to a person who goes to get um a glass from from a dirty glass from from trash you go and take it it is dirty but he just goes and he selects that one there are many other ones that are there but you preferred that just that specific one and you take it and you go and you clean it up and then it is set aside for use amen that's what you and I were when we were walking down those streets doing wrong we had no idea we just looked like everybody else but there was something special about us and when God came and he chose us because he had predestinated us before the foundation of the world amen and he came and he picked us out out of that Mary clay and he justified us he cleansed us so that we could be Versalles of Honor and he can he can dwell within us amen so that is what he is requiring for us from us amen so do not worry he has predestinated you before the foundation of the world you cannot fail amen because the scripture tells us that God will never lose none that I his so the moment you know you see the word the depot in you calls back to the dip that is in the word you know you are chosen you are bright and you tell the devil I cannot fail amen can somebody say that this evening I cannot fail hallelujah because we were chosen before the foundation of the world and now God now is obligated the prophet of God tells us that God is more willing to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to so it is just a matter of going to God you say God I have come may I have the Holy Ghost may you please dwell within me the formula for it it was spelled out at the day of Pentecost they said how shall we receive the Holy Ghost you say repent and be sighs and you shall be filled with a gift of the Holy Ghost which is Christ giving you a piece of him south amen so when you receive when you receive the Holy Ghost now you did you become a different and a new creature amen so now that's why your that's all you have to do just go to God and say God please may I have the Holy Ghost and many a times the prophet of God says we fail to get the desperation that's needed we just come then you say well if you give me all that's fine if you don't that's it we need the desperation we need to come and say Lord if I cannot leave until you give it to me I forgot the name of this other gentleman he said Lord if you don't give it to me today you when you come back you will find a pile of my bones right here because I am NOT going to leave until you touch me amen the prophet of God told is that when we come to the altar we should come with that sincerity we should come with that desperation to say God you please come and touch me and he is more willing to do that more than you want to receive it amen so when you receive the Holy Ghost you have this relationship established with God and everyone knows that amen the other day we talked about the sons of sceva they knew they knew that Paul was making was having all these miracles and they went they they tried to chase this demon the demon says and Paul we know Jesus we know but we just don't know you because they never had the Holy Ghost they didn't have the relationship that they were supposed to have with God so without that Devils are not scared of you so you gotta have the Holy Ghost amen each and every one of us have to get to that point if we are Christians we have to get to that point where we can point back to say on that day since this day my life has never been the same again because that's when I met God amen we look at Jacob when he was there he knew his grandfather Abraham it had an experience with God he knew that his father had had an experience with God and he had come to a point we know that Jacob was as was as a planter and he was just leaving anyway anyhow but he came to a point where he needed it he remembered his father had a personal experience with God when God talked to Abraham mouth to ear and he said leave the land of the Chaldeans and I'll give you a land that I have set for you amen and Abraham could say I remember this day God came to me and he chose me out from the people that were there and he had to leave his family and he lead had to leave everybody else because he was hearing to the call of God amen and we are told that Abraham was a hidden they were worshipping idols but when God came to tell him he left all that to follow what God had in store for him what God had commissioned him for amen and now we see lot just followed Abraham he had no idea why Abraham was leaving he was just following and he never had that contact he never heard that personal experience with God he didn't have a point where he could say this day God told me this God met me I had this personal experience with God you see that's what happens many many a times people just follow people with the revelations strange revelations and you ask them could you explain that they say no so-and-so told me this this and that we are not talking about so in sauce revelation what did God reveal to you amen you have to get that personal revelation from God so that you can be answerable for whatever you believe not just getting different revelations and following whatever that is because if a revelation is explained to you it can be unexplained to you so you have to get that personal experience so that you can say for sure I know that this was God and I know that what I have is it's I'm holding substance and will not let this go because this is my lifeline this is what God told me amen and he came down Abraham bought Isaac and Isaac he had a point in time where he could point back and he says this was God he says this day my life almost ended but God provided a lamp instead of me I could have been sacrificed but I know that it was God who brought who created that lamp and it got stuck in the bush amen and that was his own personal experience and this was a time he could remember amen so Jacob knew all about this he was told all this history I believe and he knew and we know Jacob us as a planter and he was just living anyway if somebody when people were at home if they would miss something they would ask everybody else have you seen this have you seen this they'll just say um did you ask Jacob because he was always the suspect everybody knew him to be a cheater he cheated his way through everything even he cheated even doubt on how he got his wealth with his um with with his ax father-in-law Laban he cheated through everything but it came to a point in time when he had to meet back his his brother his twin brother Esau and he knew now that this was a matter of life and death it was now different he remembered all the supplanting he had done all the cheating's he had done it was nothing he counted in vain and he knew that his life was at stake he looked at his children he looked at his wives he looked at everything he had that meant nothing because until unless he would meet God his life was going to be ended that's when he got desperate and he got to a point where he went and he started praying and until the angel of the Lord came down and he started wrestling with the angel until almost daybreak almost up until the Sun almost came out and he said I'm not going to leave you until you bless me because he knew that if the angel was gonna go without giving him an assurance yeah he he was going to be in trouble with Esau but he held on to the angel and he fought until he he broke his hip and he could say this day just before daybreak I had an experience with God and he could point back to that a man and from then on his life was changed and his name was changed from Jacob to Israel why because he had met God he started working different when people will see they say Jacob is now walking different used to walk straight but now he's walking crooked why something should have happened to him amen I believe he started talking different because he had met Christ amen and thus what happens to all of us amen when we meet Christ people can see they say you used to do this you don't do it no more why because you had an experience your language is now different you don't speak the words you used to speak before why because you had an experience with Christ amen so whenever you have a personal experience with God people will see you do not have to say it people can tell there is a mark that's just visible to say this person has been somewhere they should have met God amen so your Christianity you do not have to walk just by the way you leave you people come and ask you what's so different about you how come you don't you don't wear pants for for the sisters how come you don't you don't wear pants so the Bible said we are the salt of the earth we gave we give the savour to it the flavor so people get thirsty they want to come and find out more about it amen that's what we ought to be when we receive the Holy Ghost so Jacob now came to a point where you could say this day that's when I met God you see God does not have grandchildren or he just everybody is the same so whether your parents God the Holy Ghost or not well if your parents go the Holy Ghost he don't mean that you and also be automatically it comes to you it's different you have to have your own personal experience amen he doesn't share the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not inherited it has to come down upon you amen so if your great-great-grandfather was a message believer that means nothing yourself you have still to come and come and have a personal experience with God because you will be accountable for yourself because we Gentiles we accountable unto God individually it is only Israel that is saved as a nation amen so we have to get this personal revelation of who God is to us one time Christ as the disciples he said whom do men say that I am and they started saying different things they say that's that's in the Matthew 16 chapter 13 Matthew chapter 16 verse 30 and I believe he says who demands who do men say that I am some studies say you some say you are Isaiah some say you are Elias Jeremiah they started off saying all the different names but then he said okay that's fine but what did you say that I am a man how do you see me as and Peter said you are Christ the Son of the Living God and God said Jesus Christ said unto him flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you a man because he knew there was a personal revelation to Peter nothing could shake him off that you couldn't come and tell him anything different because he had had that personal revelation and he knew it was he is a man so that's what we ought to do to have that perfect to have that personal experience personal revelation that we can hold onto as substance holding onto as a lifeline knowing that my life depends on this amen because that's what Christ means to me amen so you cannot get an experience explain to you neither can it be taught we look at Moses we know Moses the children of Israel had been crying they knew 400 years were up and they knew it was time for a deliverer to come and the prophet of God tells us that Moses his mother and father that's a merman Djokovic he told us that they were praying they were praying fasting day and night for this deliverer and when Moses was born they knew that he was a deliverer but now and God made it possible that Moses was raised by his own mother in the in the palace of Pharaoh and she was being paid to suckle her own child a man and then Moses as he was growing up his mother always told him that you are a deliverer and he knew it and it was true that he was a deliverer and now with that knowledge that revelation that had been taught to him he tried to go and carry out the duties of being a deliverer and that's when he went and he killed one Egyptian and after that he was a fugitive why because he was trying to carry out a commission on a tort revelation he hadn't gone to meet the person who had given the commission he hadn't met God yet for him to the person who had given him the commission to be a deliverer a man but after 40 years he was in the desert he came to a point where he came to the burning bush that's when God said it is now time for me to make myself manifest to Moses Amen and that's when he came and he said removi of your shoes for way you are standing is holy ground and that's when Moses saw this burning bush that's when he had a personal experience and Moses knew that God the God they would pray and say the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so that was a historical God to Moses but now God said it has time for me to make myself make manifest unto Moses and he said I am that I am which is present tense so he was letting Moses know that I I want to be your God yes I am Abraham's God yes I am Isaac job Isaac's god I am Jobs God but now I am that I am I want to become your God he was making it revealed to to Moses amen and when he had that experience he had he had a one-man invasion and he went back and he delivered the whole nation why because he had had this personal experience and he had this revelation amen one more quote the prophet of God said if I went here to a church member and I said what do you think of Jesus Christ who was he why he was the son of God well how do you know my posture say so your past is right but what do you know about it see mother's right and the pastor is right but before you know he is the son of God the Bible said no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost has to witness it too you must be a personal experience I hope you see that no matter how much you go to church how well your name is engraved or on its stained windows Oh book it'll never mean nothing to you until you are witness you're a witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the infilling of the power of the Holy Spirit amen so it is good to come to church but that doesn't make that doesn't guarantee you the Holy Ghost after you come to church you have to go the further step to say Lord may you please fill me and that is the only way we can be true witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ but getting the Holy Ghost filled within us amen and that's how we can become we can have personal experiences and we can become perfect weaknesses for for Jesus amen now we can talk about Paul when he was on the road to Damascus he was given this knowledge that he was serving God by persecuting the Christians and to him he was doing God a service by persecuting this cult of people who supposedly followed a person who said you drink my blood and he was doing God a service but then God said no you have had you been you have been having new revelations shoved down your throat for a while it's now time for me to give you my own revelation to have your own personal experience and on his road to Damascus that's when Christ shine that light and his and his donkey stopped and that's when Christ had a conversation with Paul you see Paul after that he was so bold because it was not something he had been told he wasn't taught by Peter to say this is what it is and this is what happened he knew he had a personal revelation he knew he had a personal experience that he could point back to and he said Jesus Christ spoke to me amen from this day on my life was different from this day on I was one soul but now from this day my name changed to Paul amen a name change is the same as a life changing that's when my lifestyle changed because I had a personal experience with God amen and we wrote all this he wrote Paul wrote the the New Testament why because it was a man who had had a personal revelation where they had a personal experience and a feeling of the Holy Ghost so brothers and sisters it's Bhuvan us that we have the Holy Ghost it is essential and it is very important that we have the Holy Ghost because that is the only way we can make the rapture and that is the only way we can get to come into the resurrection because of the Holy Ghost amen and God is willing to give you the Holy Ghost more than you are asking for it you just come to God desperate enough and you say Lord may you please fill me and God is always so faithful that he will give it to you because he knows by giving it to you you were going to get more victory by giving it to you nothing can stand in your way amen because it is he himself who is doing it amen he is different from other people that when they send you they send you and they go the other way but when God sends you as soon as he finished sending you he comes in and he comes in with the new and he comes out and do what and he does what he has sent you to do right using your body amen isn't that wonderful knowing that wherever you go so long you are in the will of God you know that God is within you wherever you go whatever you do you know that God is within you that it is God who is doing it amen and he said whatever you do to this little ones you have done it unto me amen so he knows that when you have the Holy Ghost you are invincible that's why the devil always tries to ask you to he wants you to to procrastinate to say no no today I'm getting some other time when I have more time whilst today is today get on your knees and you say lord please feel me and it doesn't mean that you were only supposed to get it once the prophet of God tells us that we are supposed to get refilling over over again amen rejuvenation you pray Lord fill me again because it is like David say the cool waters of Bethlehem you just want to keep on having more of it amen so however many times you have gotten it you still need more and more refilling of the Holy Ghost because this is important for us to get this is Christ dwelling with dinners amen how many love
