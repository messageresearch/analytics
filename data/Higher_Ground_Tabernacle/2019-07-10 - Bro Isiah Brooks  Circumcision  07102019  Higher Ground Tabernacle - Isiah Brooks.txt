TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our nose it's been wonderful I know my subject tonight is going to look kind of strange when you see the direction I'm going in but I ask that you turn with us to Hebrews 11 and 10 and Hebrews 11 and 10 then we'll go to Hebrews 11 no let's just go Isaiah 54 from there Hebrews 11 and 10 for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God Isaiah 54 for me to scripture my wife would have been here tonight but her mom is not was having issues with her leg so she stayed home with her by the way my mother-in-law is visiting us for about three weeks so Isaiah 54 we're gonna read the fifth and the sixth verse let's start with the fourth please fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded but thou shall not be put to shame without show for for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy wood of widowhood anymore for thy maker his dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and the Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the Lord have called thee as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife were youth when thou was refused said thy God for a small moment about forsaken thee but will greet great but with great mercy will I will I the I think I hear some day in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the LORD thy God let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and we pray father God that your perfect will be done tonight forgive us of our sins cleanse us Lord Jesus from all our righteousness we pray tonight Lord that that perfect will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated if you could cut the air on just a little bit gonna feel warm for some reason I like to entitle my message seeking a city in crucial times seeking a city in crucial times and one of the things that really caught my attention we know by God's grace that has been prophesied that California it will sink and we know by God's grace they have had several earthquakes in the last week or two the last measured earthquake I believe was 7.1 of course we would know that numbers mean a lot to God seven was completion and one a man makes eight it seemed like God is getting ready to do something I was telling the saints of God that on that ring of fire has has made it right its rounds it's you know going through Mexico it's going through New Zeeland and own up and then it made his reign his way back to Canada and the next dot was California and I was telling someone that that was what was going to happen and it happened just that way I believe that when this last earthquake and like I said I thought it was that night or the last 17.1 maybe it wasn't but it was a the the highest one did most the most damage and all I could think about was Capernaum Pompeii I could think about just all of the other things that God promised would take place and people ignored the warning but God never judges as anything without a warning in the time of Enoch he was translated the Bible says translated he was raptured the Bible said he was not found but he escaped the wrath that came by way of Noah and understand that Enoch and Noah are two representatives of two Christians Enoch represents the Christian that gives his whole heart to God and then nor represents the lukewarm line he had to go through the Great Tribulation which was the flood the Bible said that God called a man by the name of Abraham before then people lived the way they wanted to live but when God called Abram his name was Abram but he was chosen by God and God had a purpose for him and that purpose God even called him the father of many nations I'm not here to scare anyone or to but to make it known to us that this is a crucial time all scriptures are being fulfilled I mean we we see the days of Noah we see the sector days of Sodom we see these days combining in our generation and this day is called the worst of all days God has been put out of school God has been put out of churches God has been put out of politics but God promised it would be so but understand the Word of God for today did not come to shake the world the world has already been shaken this America have experienced one or more great revivals in the 50s was the greatest revival ever hit the face of the earth we know that when Martin Luther Wesley and all those great men of God that God used shook shook shook shook the world but in this last day God come to shake the church because the church is in what we call a lukewarm state a lair to see an age where everybody has their rights I got a right to do it the way I want to do it you can't tell me how to do it because I'm living in a day and it's okay because the Constitution says so but you and I must understand that God doesn't go by the man-made Constitution this is the only Constitution that God has and you and I we either do it God's Way or we all suffer the consequences God just doesn't judge a person or persons harshly but he always give us a way of escape you and I must understand that this day cannot be how could I say babied all or or God would have such great mercy upon us when we have a whole Bible to learn and to know how God thinks and what God will do when we don't obey his commandment but in all of this I'm saying there are people that are looking for an escape Enoch escaped no escape and each time we they escaped they only could escape by the hand of God I'm coming so you understand coming out of something doesn't necessarily mean you've escaped that particular thing that you have come out of because remember Moses came out of Egypt and 2 million people are more came out with him they came out of Egypt but Egypt never came out of them and because they allowed all of these nasty things to remain in them when Moses tried to sanctify them because understand when they came through the Red Sea that Red Sea and they Bobby said Moses and the children of Israel were baptized into Red Sea and so when they went into the Red Sea it was like a death burial and resurrection think about it over 2 million people being baptized in one day or however long it took them to cross that Red Sea but even in that baptism it wasn't enough that was just like a justification justified that means God chose you picked you up and was gonna use you but he couldn't use them until they went into the wilderness the Bible tells us that in the wilderness it was 40 years they stayed into the wilderness 40 years and God tried to sanctify them 40 years and they never crossed over in other words God dealt with these so-called Christians let me put it in modern terms for 40 years and they did not meet the criteria matter of fact they all died in the wilderness jesus said so and if you looked at died in the wilderness in the New Testament that means they were eternally separated from God now you said what brother books that just doesn't seem right well even in nature tells us that when it comes to producing or burying a child or a woman to get impregnated you know when the man gene meets the woman's egg it's about a million or more all those little fellas trying to way to break into that egg but out out of all of them only one make it so even in nature in the man's way is one out of a million if they were eight toes in those day was one out of million who made it we don't know how many was during the time of ena but think about it only one and think about the percentage of people that made a rapture and that's what Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Lord so what do you do with all of these things that we're working with now I don't know about you but I'm toe according to revelation 21:27 there shall in no wise enter into into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or make it a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life so you must understand that the people that make heaven have been chosen to make heaven and these people who have been chosen to make heaven they were chosen before the foundation of the world now you can't say God God are you no you just not fair but the Bible tells us that God had mercy on whom he will he's God like I said and I've used the illustration many times when I was a boy I played with soldiers I played with Indians and always determined which one was going to win sometimes the Indians would win and sometimes Amen the soldiers would win but I was the one who determined which would win it was my choosing and that's how it is with God God is there's so much to him and in no way I can explain to you by God's grace all that he is to God but he's a God of our contrasts in other words he's a savior so he needed a sinner he's a healer so he needed someone sick is that right he's a deliverer so he needed somebody bound so he allows Satan to come and do the nut the dog park the contrast part and that now he didn't make Satan do it but that was Satan's choice to do it and God knew he would do that - listen let me go on so I'm saying all of these things because you must understand that that in this day if we're not careful we will miss it out miss out we've come out of organization we don't consider ourself an organization we don't consider ourselves a denomination we only consider ourselves that being part of the bottom crop body of Christ and the only way that you can get into the body of Christ that is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire that right you must be born again not by the water only but by the water and the spirit you see so we realized by God's grace that that God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth I'm taking my time tonight so you can understand Amen that we are living in a crucial time of crucial time Laodicea which is a age that we're in is the last church age before the Great Tribulation all right the last Church age this is it people I don't care what everybody's thinking is going to happen this is it America has spewed her day of grace and she's not going to get better she's going to get worse that's what the Bible says he evil seducers shall wax worse and worse there's no such thing as a better day when our country has rejected God we had Israel as an example they rejected God and look what happened to is that right so you and I must understand there's not no nothing's gonna get better it's going to get worse and God will even make nature work on his behalf now let me go on because you got to realize Amen that just like Israel all that came out of Egypt was not all Israel think God doesn't destroy his own he only destroyed those who who knows not that I'm not here is that right the Bible says the Lord knoweth them that I hear you see what I'm saying and the only way you can understand that is to know that there are two seeds one seed is of God and the other seat of isn't of the devil there's no such thing as they're in between right you either are of God or you are of the devil is that right now the Bible tells us that there was a woman that had twins and one name was Esau and the other one name was Jacob Jacob and we find out that Jacob Amen in his character didn't look much like the seed of God but Esau constantly served his father Abraham did whatever he wanted whatever he he wanted him to do but we find out that it was Esau who was the shyster it was Esau Amen who hated his birthright and I'm coming to that in a moment because the birthright was the thing that Jacob lied and shyster his brother out of he had respect for the birthright y'all understand me is alright but we know that Jacob had a problem with lying and deceiving right and we find out that he went to his father his up his uncle's house he met Rebecca over there he met Leah you know them saying and the same tricks he pulled on Jacob on Esau God pulled on him is that right see because whatever you saw you going to reap and so therefore he had to see he reached set fourteen years and amen he gather two wives so that's a long story but the point is amen the Bible said that Jacob knew that he was not ready and prepared for the war there was a fun him and that was he had to come back to his country to me Esau hello and we find out that Jacob the Bible said wrestled all night now you got to understand when that route so that means prayer he prayed all night lord have mercy on me I'm not prepared for tomorrow y'all understand me see we can't get out of here we can't get out of this situation without prayer there's no way it is the way that God has determined it and that's the way we must do it in order for anyone to get out of Egypt guess what the Bible said that God said I have heard their cry what was it they were praying they were crying out and prayer God have mercy God deliver us God we need a Savior and God sent the Moses but you see when God send you someone it's never like like you wanted to be it's always something contrary to what you think is going to be and so when Moses came they were ready for Moses right consider how Moses Amen was once Pharaoh or next to Pharaoh he became a murderer is that right is that right now how many you would follow a murderer but God chose it to be that way because car take the foolishness of this world to confound the wise he always hides himself behind what we might call foolishness and you saw a cry when I follow a man like Moses when we know he's a murderer he's been dethroned he's a reject of Egypt he's a castaway but that's what God chose that's what God chose and and we find out that he led millions out of Egypt now they come into a place we call the wilderness did you know I think it was like a seven day journey they could have gone to Jericho seven days to the promised land but 40 years God made them work let me tell you something when God is trying to clean us and cleanse clean us up a man no longer no here take however long it takes because God is not governed by time he's eternal right somebody put tests on them for 40 years and they still murmured and complain I'm gonna tell you something that's one thing God won't Talib tolerate and that is murmuring and complaining about his leadership hmm his ways of fire pass finding out way beyond our ways but he took them there to do what he's trying to help them now because leading them into the wilderness he gave them bread to eat he every time they complain he gave them fouls to eat bird they didn't even have to hunt for them he sent them to their backyard right rain down manna from heaven the Bible said that clothes never got raggedy neither did they have to change shoes 40 years I came up here shoes for 40 years right and they still fail to see what God was doing all God ever wanted for his people was to trust him with all of their hearts that's all he tried to do try to get them to trust him how do you know when you can you trust in God when you're complaining cease and that's all he ever wanted he wanted his people to trust him is that the scripture trust the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways and he shall direct your path right so I'm coming to something in just a moment so now there's another Exodus there was an exodus in noise day right that's the first exit the second Exodus was Moses right he mainly brought them out of Egypt but there's a third X's God is three right one two three that's perfection he works in three right three dispensations a dispensation of the Father dispensation of the son disposition of the Holy Ghost but these three are one so you look at these things and so all brother Brooks what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that God and then he's working there's another Exodus but you understand whenever God brings you out of something he must first do what sanctify you when he brought the children out of the wilderness tried them and everything else he told him listen sanctify yourself secondly he said you must be reser kamsani help me here I'm getting stirred so I want you to understand by God's grace that God comes along and he gets to work with you work with what the inner man see it's not about all what you think you are all that you do they're going to be a lot of preachers who end up in hell thinking because they were preachers they were saved there's gonna be a lot of gospel singers a man end up in hell because they said oh I saying gospel but when did that become a criteria when did God say you got to learn how to sing gospel to get they ever you know what he told them you must be born again of the water and of the spirit you must be born again because the way you are now you can get there no flesh and blood shall enter into that City none you and I were born in iniquity shaped and iniquity born in sin came out speaking lies you don't have to tell a baby how to lie you don't have to tell a young child Hara how to be jealous or to hate it is in them that's the nature and that nature must be changed and that change come by fire baptism of God right and the only way that you can have that is that you've got to be sanctified circumcised amen listen one of the things that God did with Abraham April when his name was ABR a b ra m abram when God called him but when God began to change Abraham his name became Abraham that word ham means God God attached his name to Abram so Abraham became what like God is the father of all things Abraham became the father of Nations right but the circumcision came the change of the name came at the same time the circumcision came C so when when circumcision whether circumcision means to cut away the Serpent's part and y'all understand what I mean so when a man is circumcised and that skin is taken off it's cutting away the circumcircle part and then you have a revelation there right so you must understand that when God began to work in a man's life or a woman's life amen they must understand it just not I believe that I'm a Christian or I believe that Jesus Christ is our Savior that's the beginning but that is not where it stopped you must move on you do Paul said we must grow into grace grow into the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we are on a journey and circumcision means not only had you had to clean your house physically but you had to clean your natural house whoo you had to make sure nothing was in your house that would defile and what is something that is defiling anything that's unclean and won't fit in heaven that's what the filing is if whatever you have you know that if you would die you couldn't put it in heaven it ain't right here because if I said let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven right listen goddess has his church called and named and set aside and in the age that she lives he's revealed himself to her each and every time just and he says in Romans eighth chapter that the foreknowledge of predestination of God might stand assure you understand me in other words God was not surprised at the birth of Judah Judas Judas the Bible said was born the son of perdition he came he didn't even know where but he was a devil from his birth it was only during the time that Jesus needed Judas to betray him because in the Old Testament it tells about how he would be so for thirty pieces of silver and then Jesus come of Judas come right along and sell jesus for thirty pieces that scripture there in the Old Testament was Judas it just didn't have a name it was in the New Testament that scripture became a person follow me here the scripture had to become a person it had to be the Word made flesh is that right the Bible says according to Isaiah nine a virgin shall conceive right and so you see that that was Jesus Christ that was Mary first of all conceiving Jesus well nobody knew that was Mary and never nobody knew who it was going to be Jesus but nor did they know his name because about said his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the everlasting father the Prince of Peace you're understanding but when the age of met Mary and told her that this thing that being used of the Holy Ghost you understand me and his name shall be called Jesus that scripture became a lie you understand me so what I'm trying to say is that there are shadows and types of every devil in the Bible and there's shadows and types of you there and if you want to see yourself you look through the Scriptures and you will find yourself you understand what I'm saying because you can say oh if I was in the days of Jesus I would serve him well nope the only reason why you would serve him is that you're serving him now because he's still here you see what I'm saying oh I was in Moses day I saw the Moses no only if you would follow Christ now because it wasn't a man Moses it was Christ in Moses see so there will be no excuse let me move on now sanctification coming to this place and you know what i'ma tell you it like this and I'm cutting it short I'm not gonna be long tonight but I'm gonna tell you this every church age manifested its virtue hmm Elvis's manifested faith right it's right what it did it was they were chosen to do that they couldn't help but do that and when Luther was called Luther was justification Wesley was sanctification those people fell under that anointing and they they got so sanctified they believe that chewing gum was wrong you understand me it was the anointing of that age this is why we're different it's not that we want to be different but there's a message there's a word that's causing us to be the way we are acting the way we are you can't help it it caught it catches you for an example it's like a magnet it's like when Peter James and John Jesus witness they come follow me they didn't know the man but the Bible said they dropped everything and followed him now that sounds insane but what it was there was something that caught their attention that was greater than their eyesight the Bible says birds have nested and foxes have holes and birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head that you go follow somebody that don't even have a house but that's what they did they followed Jesus y'all understand me God always makes it that way you always got are you gonna look like a nut you're gonna look like a fruitcake something's wrong with this boy why would he why would he live like that why would he do that why would he follow that he can't help there's something that magnetized you if you are elected to make heaven you understand me we read about Abraham the Bible said Abraham left his country knowing not whether he was going and child II was like Babylon he was a flourishing place it wasn't poor flourishing method Abraham took his took his goods he wasn't leaving with one wagon he had a lot of things but there was a call on his heart from God and even though he couldn't explain it he knew he had to follow can you imagine what they were saying Abraham Abraham Abram you have fallen of God what he looks like I don't know have you ever seen him no where where can you find him I don't know you see because he was the invisible God he was a low him he was spirit but that spirit called a hold of him and somehow communicated to Abraham and Abraham knew he had to leave Babylon why because they were idolaters right so it is with every Christian that's what he said Peter James y'all come follow me they're like quit their job and they left followed him right so let me move on so we realize they meant that when it came to Westby them that jessilee that sanctification fell on then what were they consistently doing making sure that they were circumsized cleansed and this is what Christians do today we're not perfect within ourselves but we because we are under the blood work constantly confessing when constantly asking God to cleanse us with constantly asking God to fill us with this holy goes some things are what the Holy Ghost is shouting the Holy Ghost is dancing the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues it can be all of that and yet is still it can be just a still small voice but whenever it happens it's going to change you because the Holy Ghost is the nature of God Peter says it is the divine nature and that has been administered to us through Malachi for you understand me these verses that we see up on the wall these virtues are not mind over matter absolutely not it is the gift of God and yet in his victory so how do you gain victory in this matter by yielding to God that's it you yield to God you decide you yield to God you need virtue you year to God you surrender says lord I need virtue and guess what he did give it to you and then he will test it hallelujah you know work forward the work is already finished but he gives us grace that we can ask for it listen so you must understand the Church of the Living God now is in a small number and when I say that if you think this is small compared to the Church of the whole world it's small hello you said well what do you mean I'm time I bribed now I'm talk about people that's gonna make a rapture they're everywhere but they're in small numbers because Enoch was small and you got to find out a mint that even those who go through the Great Tribulation they don't behold it's gonna be a great number compared to the numbers that have have lived on this earth but even then and to be a percentage comparing to the vast numbers of people that ever lived and so you must understand that election is so important if you say I'm bride a bride it must be vindicated because it can't be head knowledge oh I'm gonna make the rapture that's not that don't guarantee you rapture being in the message doesn't guarantee you the message there are rapture what guarantees you the rapture is that you come to the statue of Christ the very image of God must be revealed in you shown in you that is what we call the tokhes eye hmm you must understand Amen that here we are so you understand Christians like Israel all Israel is not Israel right I bet you got some real shysters yeah you see them in the mall someone selling goods and all that and if you not watch it watch for them beat you out your money representing God in Israel now Romans 9 6 to 13 and I'm trying to hurry up not as though the Word of God have taken more none effect but they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is that which our are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed so what do you mean by the rugs remember when Hitler killed a hundred and forty four thousand how many was six million I'm sorry six million when when Hitler killed six million Jews do you don't you realize that every one of those names God had already called they didn't know nothing about Jesus you know why they didn't know nothing about Jesus two things first of all when Jesus Christ was being crucified those Jews scream now let his blood be on us and our children and they're all words condemn them right secondly with Miriam and Aaron when they made fun of Moses they made fun of Moses Amen Marin and Ethiopian woman is that right and it was at that point Miriam was stricken with leprosy and leprosy is sin and she had to stay without the camp for seven church ages seven days she had to stay out of the camp and guess what before she could come back she had to be sanctified by a priest hallelujah and that's what Moses and Elijah comes in hallelujah one comes the sanctified and the other one comes to bring the word there's other things they do too but you understand the scripture is perfect shadows and types are perfect right so we realize amen that when they come back in when it's time for Miriam to come back into the camper into the presence of God the rapture takes place right so you understand by God's grace how close we are Israel has already come a nation she's already in her homeland is that right and we're now experiencing the fall of America yeah people don't think we've fallen we're falling and we'll never get back up right it has been prophesied that she's going to go up in smoke yeah Russia gonna bomb us that's why you see Russia and all the stuff all these countries she's already got the bomb great waiting huh y'all understand me for example when God tries to get a country to repent and they will not he sins he said he places our enemy over them when Israel would not repent guess what God sent Nebuchadnezzar he said Babylon to conquer his people they were founded over religion so are we and who can be more atheistic than Russia but she has been ordained to not only to destroy us but destroy the Vatican as well now let's go on because if that be the case being a Christian is not the outside is the inside right and if Christ is only inside he is the one that's working you're not working when you come into Christ you come into rest is that right for example y'all heard me say this last week a week before last when Joseph when he came among his brother the Bible said that Joseph had on a coat of many colors that was that was that was like a three-piece suit that was one of them debonair Dan Schuster expensive daddy made it for him so when he came into the company of his brothers they knew he did not come to work he was at rest they did all the work all he did was report back to the daddy right so what did they do they got so angry they got so jealous of him but what you got to understand that Joseph Joseph had a work he had to come through something Joseph had to be in check all the time right he had an opportunity to steal he had an opportunity to commit adultery he had all these opportunities and Joseph was saying no he met the test every time what was God doing sanctified circle sizing him cleansing him up because God had a greater position and that was at the right hand of Pharaoh right that's what there was a how who can I trust but this man this man is there anybody else in my kingdom I could trust like that but that that King was actually speaking the words of God see is this okay there is only one way of entrance and people said what there's you know I hate to say it but I'm gonna say it I heard TD Jake when he was with Oprah saying that that there's more than one way to make it to heaven I don't know what other way he's knowing cuz they asked her yeah she asked him the question is he says no there other ways I heard it now my question is who's right Jesus or TD jakes is that right because jesus said I am the door I am the door and if any man gonna come he must come through this door right there's only one way Jesus Christ is the way and the thing about it is this is why Muslims laugh at Christians because they haven't seen the life of Christ in the Christian and the life of Christ is supposed to be in the Christian how do you get this life in you by asking God for it we have not because we ask not but when you call on God see he's the father all there's not a child that will cry in the prayers of his mother father and his mother and father will not answer God is looking see we are proud nation we are proud people and it's hard for Americans amen to follow me knees and ask God for help we'd rather say he doesn't exist so you can understand where we are nor was a man of God you know what nor was the only man that God had chosen for that day let me reword it Noah was that day's xscape a flood was coming and no one knew the way out no other man knew it if there were other preachers no other preachers knew it right Moses he was the only way out of Egypt the auto deign it that way Jesus Jesus even said except the man know that I am he should like while dying his sin he was the only way out I always tell people I said listen you don't know who everybody else is but you must come to know who you are and if there's a pull on your heart of that call on your heart don't we don't don't reject it don't walk away as if it's not there Amen because that's God so you understand what I'm trying to say in the days of Noah when Noah was building the ark all of the animals did not have a pool on him there were chosen animals from God that had a pool on them to enter the ark huh and let me tell you what you know I love this illustration even if mr. rabbit had to cross the country amen to travel to leopard territory leopard a lion couldn't touch him because he was ordained get to get on the ark that's how it is with a true believer we go through something many of us it's like a lily can I say like this we're like mr. Lily both of most of us were born in the milk slide but the seed that was underneath that that mop in that slide caught the light and that light struck us and we pushed through the slime we pushed through the mud we pushed through it and there's nothing more beautiful than a beautiful pond Lily but it had to go through something to get there so is it with the Christian though we walk in this world we are growing into Christ growing into the knowledge growing and after a while these childish mistakes we've we've made in the past disappear but we must continue to ask God the Word of God says acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path you love the Lord man consists of body soul and spirit did y'all know that body soul and spirit and I meant to draw that out and totally forgot I went through it like a circle one that's body spirit so like a bull's-eye in the middle is your soul your soul in there is faith or doubt here in your spirit are all of the other attributes like feelings and you know how that goes and in your flesh you got everything so when the Holy Ghost Falls it could fall on your flesh and you've seen people who they're called religious and right and then all of a sudden the anointing leaving they back to what they used to be then you'll have the Holy Spirit fall on your spirit it'll make you cry and they shout you might shout you may speak in tongues you might do all these glorious things but it ain't over yet see that's just the beginning you must there's a third part which we call the Holies of Holies in God's temple he had the outer Court the inner court and the Holies of Holies and this was designed like a man and in the Holies of Holies there was a veil right and that veil had to be rent in order for God to get there and out of for us to see God the veil must be read so that's why the Bible said Amen that when Jesus was crucified the veil was rent from top to bottom showing that it wasn't a man that rent the veil it was God who rent the veil see it's not you accepting God as God except in you and when God accepts your faith he rinsed the veil and he places his Holy Spirit behind that veil which is called the Holies of Holies and in that Holies of Holies you you change not because you practice it but the change come from the power with him see that is that's the Holy Ghost when you don't have to do it he does the work for you right and when you recognize he's in there to do the work you go to the man who could change you is that alright cuz none of us gonna add one cubit to our statue we can't do it I used to try so hard when I oh my I was such a heavy part of your I really was and I want it I want to see God with all my heart I wanted to stop all younger what partying do does for you and when you get all intoxicated and everything else you lose your bearings you do things you wouldn't normally do somebody help me here y'all know what I'm talking about y'all sitting up here so expect ammonia's but it's the truth you lose control and then somebody else takes control and then you wake up in the morning feeling really bad for doing the stuff that you've done and there's no way to undo it and you get tired of that what is it it's the devil using you but none of us have been we weren't made to be used by the devil we were made to be the temple of God that's what the Bible says no you not that you are the temple of God that's where God wants to dwell not in a building like this God wanna dwell in you so that you understand that's the difference between the church today in the church yesterday in in the days of Acts not only where they feel with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but I think on the seventh chapter a fourth chapter either one they were actually resealed and you have to be refilled refilled refilled it over and over again why because if you're not you have a tendency to backslide every day all day it's making that connection once you come to see that's why I read that scripture my mom my Maker is my husband what are you talking to telling me um the Bible said he's not only my redeemer but he's my husband for example Adam was the Redeemer of Eve but he was also her husband but it was he who saved her from the wrath of God by taking her into himself you understand me and so that's how Christ saves us by taking us into him in him right but day by day you got to understand this that's true the Bible says they asked Jesus how to pray and you know confession was in that they wanted to know how to pray Lord every day forgive me of my desk hmm as I forgive my dead toys every day you must confess and forgive every day and that's how we make it she is so simple the people don't understand that as long as you see God on a daily basis asking God for his cleansing power for his power to circumcise however you want to say it but it is then when God can trust you because he realized you don't want to live the bad life it is then God can say okay you've been faithful I'm gonna seal you boom right and then all of a sudden you realize that the demons recognize you that right oh yeah they say Paul we know Peter we know but who are you that's why that's why the Devils be sitting up in church right now and and and the church ain't no threat to them because people don't have them they have religion they have religion they have religion I just recently saw the devil cast out of a band you know by the power of prayer you know how many times we've seen healings and deliverances in I'm a witness it's not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord you know we don't have the plush seats and but you know what neither did Jesus when he in the manger think about what you have he's all I gotta have no you don't the early church had churches in caves they went house-to-house they didn't have a change of clothes they had all they all they had was Jesus let me tell you something if I had to make a trade give me Jesus give me the way they had and give it to me listen i'ma tell you something I might seem crazy right now but I'm gonna be crazier later because I'm seeking God with all my heart do I make mistakes yes but I do know one thing and God had me skip a lot of things but but one thing I do know mm-hmm is that without God we are nothing and you and I must know these are crucial times let me say let me ask you a question if California had really dropped off the map on on the other day how many of us would have been prepared and ready for you know that according to the sixth seal caliber that that great earthquake is the same earthquake that that brings forth the resurrection that's why people won't know they're missing because not only with this great earthquake shake California is going to shake everything Florida was saying England would sink the whole mass of the world would change places that which was up goes down and that which was down comes up and people have no idea and they're going to see a lot of the things that the Bible took foretold and told that did happen won't be in their face this wise generation who think they have outsmart God God will show them at the end of the day then what your people still trying to figure out where they're the flood never happened all over the world in the caves everywhere paintings everywhere showed it happened but the intellectual man want to put God out and don't want to acknowledge him but they won't have to one day because God will acknowledge himself so I'm giving all of this to say this every age produced what they were supposed to produce and this age is being required to produce divine love that's rapture material there'll be a lot of Christians that will make heaven but they won't take a rapture they've got to go through the Great Tribulation according to Matthew 25 the Bible said there were five wise and five foolish in the five that was foolish did not have enough oil in their lamps in other words they were dilatory they became complacent they became distracted you understand me it's like Oh what you talking about yes Moses was at work when Moses Amen was was was with the children of Israel and everything else Moses got so busy he forgot to circumcise his own son you see them said he was in the line of duty but he got so distracted and that's what a lot of Christians do we get so distracted with so many things we fail to see that this this is our priority we forget we came into this message to produce Christ not to build houses and get famous and have all of this stuff and all of that you understand me it's alright to have that but my point is we not were not to forget who what we come for we should be listen the Word of God said we should be hot or cold he said lukewarm experience out of his mouth we supposed to be hot or cold and we supposed to be in a position right now Amen that we should be calling out to the name of the Lord like it's a matter of life and death because it really is and if we don't get this circumcision that we supposed to have I mean coming into the Christ coming into the image of Christ because nothing that will defile will enter it doesn't matter how many time on you've been in the message 40 years with Moses boom what's what was that yeah you understand me you got to understand that God can't change them his mind about his work what he says is what he meant but every man has the opportunity of making it so I'm just encouraging you not tonight I want a different way but but the reason why I I'm trying to say these things because it is a crucial time it's a time that you and I should really take inventory and see how important it is for us to refocus ourselves because distractions comes all the time all the time I'm not saying you got to be like a robot no but they're supposed to come a relationship between you and God remember Jesus said I never knew you Christians people who went out we can't start Devils in your name we see what I'm saying all these miraculous things they did and then Jesus God says listen but I never knew you in other words she said I never had an intimate relationship with you that's what God wants he wants an intimate relationship not a church core whatever I want an intimate relationship we do something that you and I can have communion with everyday yeah that's what he wants so you said what do you mean but that's all I'm saying so this intimate relationship is it's a it's how could I say it it's not a group thing every man for himself that's what I'm trying to say you love the Lord I hope I said something that sparked your interest I've got a lot of notes but he didn't even let me use them but I do want to say one thing is that you and I supposed to come to grow up into Christ so much so two demons fear hmm and my trip in Arkansas being Minister down there and the Lord did some great discerning situations that were going on in the church I knew nothing about and I was saying words verbatim this is from the pastor's mouth that another minister had already said I wasn't even there he had spoken on things situations that he needed to rectify out May Cry however it was God went right there in the area and these people were were astounded it wasn't me it was a Lord Jesus God knows every situation and if you really need God or you cry out for God he will always answer and that's what God did for this particular pastor he needed to know how to remedy this thing that he was going through and God came right on the scene I don't know the half because they wouldn't tell me you know what I didn't want to know it wasn't my business it was Christ's business so I say this by the grace of God and I'm a closed cuz I heard of a brother say Dias and I believe and he said the poor was a shout and type of the church she knew that the messenger or the message had not yet circumcised her son and she went into action in other words she recognized the church recognized that so many people in the church that deal didn't have the only ghost you know we might have enough Holy Ghost to don't do this and don't do that or maybe wear a certain clothes whatever but that doesn't cut it either if you're going to be a Christian we got to go all the way people and we've got to forget what what you think people might you know they say they go say you gone crazy you losing your mind I'm not saying for me because I can't give you nothing nothing I can give you another I could preach to you I could tell you what I know he wants and that he wants full surrender and y'all know what I'm saying he wants full surrender when you fully surrender the guard gotta give you exactly what you need you know God spoiled those ones either that surrenders completely to him pause yeah that might sounds pretty bad but I asked Abraham about it he got away with some stuff you know and and you know you look at these things you said brother what are you trying to say I'm just saying it's gonna be a few I believe personally I personally believe that this earthquake is closer now than we ever thought when that 7-1 hit I thought oh Lord look at that number look at that number seven Church ages plus one and I really believe with all my heart that was God saying okay get it right get it right it's closer now than it's ever been get it right you love the Lord you can't add one cubit to your statue but I do know one thing that all of us need to learn how to let God circumcise our hearts change me or God change me all of us we know what we battle through in our minds every day sometime as a Christian I'm a shame of the thoughts that I have but I don't give up I keep pressing I know Christianity is the right thing I've seen the pillow fire you see this life I've seen that not on a picture either reality I've seen that I've seen the pillar of cloud I was in India and all of a sudden the whole place I was preaching with Hindus and everywhere I just filled up like the house was on fire and I was preaching this message and those Hindus ran to the altar to confess Jesus Christ as their Savior I've seen lights of God but you see that still don't give me nothing you understand me Israel saw far more than I did and they all died in the wilderness because they didn't believe the Bible said they would not mix it with faith so what you hear if you don't mix it with faith it won't do you any good right you gotta mix it with faith you got to believe it you love the Lord that's there let us pray dear father God we thank you for your grace in your mercy Lord I know a lot of things were said and I don't know why you just took me the way you did but I know that somehow you had your own purpose being fulfilled father I know you spoke to my heart tonight and I trusted everyone here tonight has heard from you Lord there's nothing wrong with being more sincere that's what I desire I pray father God for my family at home touching my mother-in-law revive my house Jesus I pray that you give us each and every one of us what we stand in need of time is short and running out but one thing for certain you said you've never left yourself without a witness there will be those tobe few in number that will make a rapture and all God I trust and pray that I'm one of them bless your people now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen so that you understand there will be a lot of people missing but the world I never know especially during the time of crisis there are thousands of people missing every day never nobody knows where they are world is coming to Flying Saucer them pick them up but not like the world is saying these likes that they do see exist I remember my first time ever seeing UFOs was in 1977 I was in Columbia South Carolina screaming like a madman I knew what I saw was supernatural but I didn't understand what it really was now I see things on YouTube the exact thing I saw with my own eyes so I know other people are seeing new things now what people don't understand is that these people are this is not UFOs these are called investigating angels these are beings that God has sent to investigate this earth see is it as bad as they say that's what he did it it saw them sit down investigating angels and that's what he's doing now and once you start seeing investigating angels you know the fires about to fall this world is it's finished can't go any further from the east to the west and we ought to be happy that God has called us has chosen us to be a vessel to hear his voice in a land and a time where there's millions of voices how do you know which one is the right one because the right one will always take this Bible and declare it to be truth and we declare it that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God cannot change oh geez you're a friend of mine you supply my everything my hungry soul Lord you are my soul from whence all blessing oh you supply my every my hungry so you know what I think Heavenly Father we so thank you for tonight we pray father that you would have preeminence once again all I know Lord Jesus is that the enemy didn't want me to speak this tonight but I trust by
