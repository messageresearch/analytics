[21:58] live through my life
[22:01] and let my life be his life
[22:04] let us stand
[22:09] i'll be preaching a message tonight and
[22:12] i trust i can get all get through it
[22:15] in in such a way that you'll be blessed
[22:18] uh we're living in the last days and
[22:21] we see so many things happening and i
[22:22] think
[22:24] people are not aware of what's really
[22:26] happening
[22:27] uh they don't understand that the devil
[22:29] has a trap
[22:31] and all of the easy living that we are
[22:34] now uh enjoying
[22:36] if not careful will come back and bite
[22:38] us one day brother branham tells us that
[22:41] the dangers of this age
[22:43] is easy living
[22:45] and i'm coming to understand what he
[22:48] means
[22:49] i just wish i had and was able to put
[22:51] these up at the board but i i don't um
[22:55] didn't get a chance to go to uh
[22:57] get these what they call the illumina
[23:00] laminated
[23:02] can you do these pictures no but anyway
[23:04] you have to have it laminated i think in
[23:06] order to put them up but nevertheless
[23:08] we'll we'll explain things to you as we
[23:10] go
[23:11] let us turn to matthew the second
[23:13] chapter
[23:14] matthew's the second chapter i was
[23:16] really compelled to come to church
[23:19] i knew that
[23:20] many weren't would not be here
[23:22] but i felt like this message was for
[23:24] whoever should be here and for those who
[23:27] are listening by the grace of god
[23:29] on on the uh
[23:31] youtube
[23:32] we hope that this message becomes a
[23:35] reality and a real blessing to you it
[23:37] was some things that
[23:39] god began to show me none of my own
[23:41] myself but
[23:43] a brother shared some things with me
[23:45] which triggered a lot of thoughts by
[23:47] god's grace and i kind of compiled some
[23:50] of the things he he brought with the
[23:52] things that god was showing me and i
[23:54] trust by god's grace that this message
[23:56] would be a blessing to you
[23:59] it may even sound like a christmas
[24:01] message but it's not
[24:03] matthew 2 and 11
[24:09] and when they would come into the house
[24:12] they saw the young child
[24:14] with mary his mother
[24:16] and fell down and worshipped him
[24:19] and when they had opened their treasures
[24:22] now now
[24:24] they open their treasures but i want you
[24:26] to take note to
[24:28] what their treasures are
[24:32] they presented unto him gifts
[24:35] gold
[24:36] frankincen
[24:38] and myrrh
[24:40] let us pray
[24:41] father god we come before you
[24:44] and we thank you for your grace and your
[24:47] mercy
[24:48] we thank you for being so good to us
[24:51] you have been better to us than we have
[24:53] been to ourselves and
[24:55] father there is no words to express our
[24:57] gratitude
[24:59] all the things that you're doing and has
[25:01] done for us and
[25:02] we realize oh god that was it's going
[25:05] home time and amen and as we approach
[25:07] this time
[25:09] things are going to get worse
[25:11] and times are going to get harder and
[25:15] we understand that the trials and the
[25:17] tribulations also will escalate for the
[25:19] believer
[25:20] but by god we have confidence
[25:23] in your word
[25:25] because you said you'll never leave us
[25:27] nor will you forsake us
[25:29] and so we thank you right now oh god
[25:32] because your word is sure and we believe
[25:35] you lord and we trust you with all our
[25:37] hearts i pray tonight oh god that you'll
[25:40] bless the reading and the preaching of
[25:42] this word
[25:43] may it be a blessing to all those who
[25:45] would hear in jesus christ's name we
[25:48] pray amen
[25:51] you may be seated i'm going to read also
[25:55] from romans 12 and 1
[25:57] it says i beseech you
[26:00] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[26:03] that you present your bodies a living
[26:05] sacrifice
[26:07] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[26:11] reasonable service so here paul is
[26:14] writing to the romans
[26:16] and and he's literally telling them that
[26:19] you need to present your body as a
[26:21] living
[26:22] sacrifice and uh when we talk about a
[26:25] sacrifice it's not something that's
[26:28] enjoyable
[26:29] it is something that is done in honor of
[26:33] and so we we thank god for that because
[26:36] paul is saying you need to present
[26:38] yourself
[26:40] now
[26:42] according to revelations 13
[26:44] excuse me according to revelations 3 and
[26:46] 18.
[26:48] we are told
[26:51] in this particular book
[26:54] here john writes and says counsel i
[26:56] counsel thee
[26:57] to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[27:02] the dollar made be rich
[27:04] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[27:07] clothed
[27:08] and that the shame of thy nakedness
[27:11] do not appear
[27:13] and anoint thine eyes with eyes have
[27:16] that thou
[27:17] mayeth see
[27:19] and i like to say tonight amen by the
[27:22] grace of god that that's what i see
[27:25] i see that there are a lot of people who
[27:28] are not seeing
[27:29] they don't see
[27:31] the role that they're playing in this
[27:33] drama
[27:34] but understand it is a very serious role
[27:38] and uh we must understand by god's grace
[27:41] that uh
[27:42] the bible tells us history repeats
[27:44] itself
[27:46] but just going back to the first
[27:48] scripture i read
[27:50] that has always
[27:52] caught my mind
[27:54] in the sense of what these gifts were
[27:57] and what did they do what did they
[27:59] represent
[28:01] understand by god's grace that when
[28:03] these wise men came to
[28:06] uh the child jesus
[28:08] he was not as christian says
[28:11] a baby wrapped in swaddling clothing but
[28:13] the bible tells us he was of age
[28:16] around two to three years old
[28:19] when the wise men came
[28:21] now so we want to kind of work with that
[28:24] thought by the grace of god
[28:27] because the bible tells us that when he
[28:29] brought these gifts to him
[28:31] christ jesus
[28:33] he didn't bring him to mary they brought
[28:36] him to jesus
[28:37] so these gifts had to tie into who jesus
[28:41] was and what he came to do
[28:44] so history calls them kings and of
[28:47] course that's not scripture the bible
[28:50] said that they were wise men
[28:52] and and we know that these that term
[28:55] king didn't come into play until a
[28:59] little after 300 years uh you know after
[29:01] the death of christ and y'all know what
[29:03] happened at late uh at the niocia a lot
[29:07] of things changed during that time
[29:09] but according to the persian word or the
[29:13] word that would be used in that time we
[29:16] understand that that word wise men in
[29:19] the persian understanding would mean
[29:21] priests and that word preached would fit
[29:24] better
[29:25] than anything else
[29:26] even though they were astrologers and
[29:29] things like that but they were a priest
[29:31] of that particular faith now according
[29:34] to what brother branham says he they
[29:36] said indeed he said these three wise men
[29:39] started off in different places and they
[29:41] joined together and came to one place as
[29:44] did the stars
[29:46] the stars were three they were
[29:47] supernatural and then they came together
[29:50] amen signifying amen the trinity of god
[29:54] understand that by god's grace amen to
[29:56] three
[29:57] not not three persons but we it
[30:00] represented amen a lot of things that
[30:02] the god on earth the god of heaven was
[30:05] now on earth
[30:06] and so we realize amen that when these
[30:09] three kings understand each one of those
[30:12] stars represented the kings or the
[30:14] priests from which they came
[30:16] amen they came from different directions
[30:18] but at the end of the day those three
[30:20] lights became one so we understand the
[30:23] condition of the world when we think
[30:25] about the condition of the world when
[30:27] jesus was born it was born in a bad time
[30:29] oh yeah yet again it was a good time we
[30:32] understand that israel was really
[30:34] spiritually dead
[30:36] as a nation
[30:38] is that right they have mixed religion
[30:41] with roman politics
[30:44] is that the truth and so we realized by
[30:46] god's grace amen they had a mixture of
[30:50] politics and religion sound familiar
[30:54] and in that day we understand that the
[30:56] the city of jerusalem that was supposed
[30:59] to be such a great time of a place of
[31:02] worship and a place of life and a place
[31:04] of god we find out because they had
[31:07] mixed everything with roman theology and
[31:10] and doctrines and isms and schism they
[31:13] were dead and what they used to be was
[31:15] no longer there
[31:17] so much so that when the star appeared
[31:19] they never did see
[31:22] that star
[31:23] is that right so underneath all of this
[31:26] stuff
[31:27] we understand that the uh political
[31:30] power which which basically was a priest
[31:32] or the preacher amen uh uh working amen
[31:36] with with this um uh i'm sorry the
[31:38] political power working with the priest
[31:40] power amen it became they were
[31:42] backslidden and they were being ruled
[31:45] and they were being taught by scholars
[31:48] does that sound familiar so i want you
[31:51] to understand that in that time
[31:53] jerusalem should have been a glow
[31:56] but instead of them being a glow they
[31:58] were a glare and and it's like our
[32:01] organization like our pentecostal age
[32:03] you what had happened is that we've
[32:05] joined in with the political realm and
[32:07] so therefore we have become just like
[32:09] the jerusalem of jesus day
[32:12] amen because even when the star in our
[32:15] day appeared they couldn't see it
[32:18] why because they had the glare of of of
[32:21] of yesterday amen working with them is
[32:24] that right
[32:25] even the prophet of god tells us that
[32:27] that when when when when the wise of men
[32:30] when they entered in jerusalem uh the
[32:34] glare of jerusalem
[32:36] made them lose sight
[32:39] of the star
[32:40] hallelujah and so when they went into
[32:43] and i'm just going to go ahead and
[32:44] preach it when they went into jerusalem
[32:47] they went by way of herod and herod was
[32:49] the king there
[32:50] and uh herod was the controller he was
[32:52] the nicolaitan he was a dictator he was
[32:55] the man of rome that was really
[32:58] over all of jerusalem and they had mixed
[33:01] it of course you understand you've seen
[33:02] little stories and maybe little movies
[33:04] where the the sanhedrin and all of those
[33:07] who were supposed to be a spiritual
[33:10] priest of god was ruled by rome
[33:14] and so even when jesus christ came they
[33:16] didn't recognize him but let me go on by
[33:18] god's grace so we realized amen that
[33:21] herod who was the type of the nicolaitan
[33:23] rule of rome ruled israel the church as
[33:26] well
[33:27] they had a name that they were life and
[33:30] yet they were dead so how would you say
[33:33] that because john said so that's right
[33:36] amen and the king that would come along
[33:39] because
[33:42] any king any king understand that's the
[33:44] way rome was any king anybody that had
[33:46] an authority anything that that that
[33:48] came that had power became a threat
[33:52] to herod
[33:54] as well as the church sounds familiar so
[33:57] when our star appeared oh i'm gonna jump
[34:00] in here to myself because that's the way
[34:02] it was in our day
[34:04] when he appeared amen we wanted to know
[34:06] where the king of the jews was but this
[34:08] time it was the king of the gentiles
[34:11] hallelujah but we find out amen that
[34:15] god always chose bethlehem
[34:18] right i mean you take david it was
[34:20] bethlehem it was you know he always used
[34:23] bethlehem because the word bethlehem
[34:25] means the house of god's bread
[34:27] and we must understand that even though
[34:30] the bible tells us that here was amen uh
[34:33] this city bethlehem it was a notable it
[34:36] wasn't anything great matter of fact the
[34:38] bible said it was the least of judah's
[34:40] princes
[34:42] and and we find out that that's where
[34:43] god always hides himself not in the
[34:46] great big fashion
[34:48] uh fashionable things but little things
[34:51] that places where people would dare to
[34:53] look for him that's where he shows up
[34:56] so we know by god's grace amen
[35:00] herod was so upset
[35:03] because here was these wise men had
[35:05] followed the stars for thousands of
[35:07] miles to find
[35:09] this king and they were thrown off the
[35:12] track or thrown off by the glare
[35:16] of religion and politics
[35:19] hallelujah that's the same thing that's
[35:21] happening in the message
[35:24] people are being thrown off of a
[35:26] systematic way of worship
[35:29] is that right and anything outside of
[35:32] that systematic worship
[35:34] is deemed to die
[35:38] that's the way it's been and that's the
[35:39] way it is
[35:41] and we realize by god's grace amen that
[35:44] here we find that here was this this
[35:46] king and and he he he he wanted to know
[35:50] where was this child going to be born
[35:53] now watch this because
[35:55] these wise men they were wise enough to
[35:57] try follow god by faith right and the
[36:00] faith that the just shall live by what
[36:02] faith
[36:04] you can't even walk this message without
[36:06] faith because you and i don't know where
[36:07] we're going amen
[36:09] hallelujah we've never been this way
[36:11] before
[36:12] and so god is training us but understand
[36:15] this the way is the way of the cross
[36:18] this is a hard way this is a way of
[36:20] suffering this is a way amen that you
[36:22] and i must understand in order to get to
[36:24] heaven you've got to suffer first
[36:27] hallelujah we always talk about all when
[36:29] i walk those streets of gold but you in
[36:31] order to walk those streets of gold you
[36:33] must prove yourself on this side of the
[36:37] dimension
[36:39] so we realized by god's grace these
[36:40] three wise men lost sight of the star
[36:43] when they entered into jerusalem and why
[36:45] because it was a system of religion
[36:47] religion and politics mixed hello and we
[36:51] find out it's among us
[36:53] religion and politics and whenever you
[36:55] have religion and politics mixing you
[36:58] have a dead church
[37:00] you have a dead seed somewhere
[37:03] amen because that is not god amen days
[37:06] that are led by the spirit of god they
[37:09] are the sons of god
[37:11] hallelujah look at these wise men they
[37:13] were wise in the sense that they were
[37:15] able to catch hear the voice or hear the
[37:18] unction or feel the unction of god and
[37:20] they left everything to follow that star
[37:24] alleluia there was nothing even the
[37:27] astrologers of of of the world didn't
[37:29] see the star the astrologers of
[37:31] jerusalem never saw the star
[37:34] hallelujah and so is it in our day
[37:38] that's right only the elected of god can
[37:41] see the star and they will always follow
[37:44] that star because that star will lead
[37:46] you where to bethlehem to the house of
[37:49] god's bread amen
[37:52] hallelujah
[37:54] yet the wise men
[37:56] were asked the question
[37:59] where is the why the wise man asked the
[38:02] question where is he that is born king
[38:04] of the jews for we have seen his star in
[38:08] the east
[38:09] and have come to worship
[38:12] him
[38:12] understand me
[38:14] that star that you see
[38:16] has caused a lot of commotion
[38:18] you you may not see it and you may not
[38:21] know it but it's it's it's shaking uh
[38:24] the religious realm
[38:26] because they can't get rid of it and the
[38:28] more they try to get rid of it
[38:30] the more it prosper
[38:32] is that right because remember amen when
[38:35] herod the roman the the the spirit that
[38:38] operates that system found out that
[38:41] there was another king
[38:43] he was troubled
[38:45] and right now
[38:46] they're still troubled
[38:48] because they understand that there are
[38:50] those who are coming up just like he
[38:52] came up
[38:53] hallelujah it was more than just uh uh
[38:56] three three gifts and understanding the
[38:58] gifts that they gave were the most
[39:00] expensive gifts of that time
[39:02] frankincense
[39:04] gold and myrrh
[39:06] and we think oh my goodness gold gold
[39:09] but gold was one of the least of the
[39:11] three
[39:12] the most expensive was the frankincense
[39:15] the myrrh and then the gold
[39:18] but today gold means more than anything
[39:20] else you can get a little bottle of
[39:21] frankincense now you know for 9.97 on
[39:24] youtube
[39:25] but back in the day it was hundreds of
[39:27] dollars and that and then a few years
[39:29] ago they've made billions of dollars
[39:32] selling frankincense
[39:34] now frankincense come in different kinds
[39:36] of trees you know but we're talking
[39:38] about the frankincense frankincense amen
[39:42] that can only be found as i've been told
[39:44] in one place
[39:46] now i've seen other places but we've got
[39:49] to do a little bit more studying on that
[39:52] because
[39:52] it says it not only can it be found in
[39:55] arabia but it also can be found in east
[39:58] africa and when i looked up east africa
[40:01] i found out that in east africa ethiopia
[40:05] was there
[40:06] and that's where the king of sheba came
[40:07] from
[40:09] her herbs and her spices and all of
[40:12] those kind of things so anyway
[40:15] we're talking about with and this is
[40:16] saudi arabia see how it's so close to
[40:18] each other you can't see that but here's
[40:20] saudi arabia and here is the south uh
[40:22] east africa but anyway let me move on by
[40:25] the grace of god it's important to see
[40:26] that because you understand that this uh
[40:29] frankincense tree
[40:32] only grows in places
[40:36] that is most i say most impossible for a
[40:40] tree to grow in
[40:42] and in my study i was told that a
[40:45] frankincense tree
[40:47] franken incentree
[40:50] can literally grow out of a rock
[40:53] oh y'all didn't catch it oh my god
[40:56] because at the end of the day you're
[40:58] going to see where i'm going with this
[41:00] because you got to understand
[41:02] that when they brought
[41:05] these gifts
[41:07] to jesus christ and i see now that uh
[41:11] it
[41:11] it there was something um
[41:14] that they had in common
[41:16] and that each one of these gifts had to
[41:20] suffer
[41:22] in order to manifest its glory
[41:25] amen you understand me amen now it also
[41:28] is a is a it's it's it's like a shadow
[41:31] and a type
[41:32] of god bringing the bride of jesus
[41:35] christ to the baby child
[41:37] because remember jesus
[41:40] at the time had no seed
[41:45] but the the bride that was to come
[41:48] was to suffer
[41:50] amen she had to be bone of his bone
[41:53] flesh of his flesh she had to be just
[41:55] like him
[41:57] and so it was more to just frankenstein
[42:00] incense and gold
[42:01] but you you understand there was a
[42:03] shadow and a type of justification
[42:05] sanification baptism of the holy ghost
[42:07] all of that was included in that giving
[42:10] and understand this
[42:12] that each one of those gifts
[42:14] were given from a different nation
[42:17] right ham sham and jeopard
[42:20] right and they were the three sons of
[42:23] noah
[42:24] right with which was the whole pete the
[42:26] whole of god's people
[42:29] y'all understanding so each one of those
[42:31] gifts amen represented suffering and i
[42:35] don't want to get too much into that
[42:37] but understand the bethlehem of judah it
[42:40] was at least among the princes of judah
[42:42] and as i said it was the house of god's
[42:45] bread
[42:46] and when when i said the the the wise
[42:49] men when they left uh jerusalem
[42:53] which which you know brother bam said in
[42:55] jerusalem they went you know should have
[42:56] been going down hallelujah boulevard and
[42:58] all that but nobody was going they may
[43:00] have been going down there but the
[43:01] worship was gone
[43:06] where the priest of god once was
[43:09] and then by leaving the star
[43:13] the star appeared again y'all understand
[43:15] what i'm saying
[43:16] see if you're tied into the system of
[43:19] this message
[43:21] you'll never see him
[43:23] you'll never understand what he's
[43:25] requiring from you
[43:26] because the system the glare of this
[43:29] thing will blind you and keep you from
[43:31] seeing the true christ christ child
[43:34] now i'm going to say it like this so you
[43:36] can understand me
[43:38] when we come to this thing
[43:41] this is where we're missing it
[43:43] brother branham said easy living that
[43:46] that that's the thing that's that's
[43:48] that's that is killing
[43:52] the bride of jesus christ let you know i
[43:54] said the bride let's say like this
[43:56] message people
[43:57] all right because it can't kill the
[43:59] bride but message people are dying
[44:03] in their tracks because of easy living
[44:06] matter of fact the bible said when if a
[44:07] woman liveth in pleasure she's dead
[44:10] already
[44:11] and and as you can see
[44:13] the people who claim to have seen a star
[44:17] something has happened
[44:19] understand the devil is smart he
[44:22] understands what it takes to destroy
[44:26] is that right he understood
[44:28] giving uh job more riches
[44:31] wasn't going to
[44:32] you know make him deny god
[44:35] because he understood god gave him the
[44:37] riches
[44:38] but understand job even job had a thing
[44:41] about him that that that superseded
[44:45] everybody of his age because the bible
[44:46] said he was a perfect man amen and
[44:49] understand how you become perfect
[44:52] because paul says it like this
[44:54] jesus let's say the word says like this
[44:56] jesus learned his obedience through the
[44:59] things in which he
[45:00] suffered
[45:01] so you got to understand the perfection
[45:03] of job came by with all all of his
[45:06] sufferings
[45:09] hallelujah and that's the problem we
[45:12] want to easy living we don't want to
[45:13] suffer but i'm going to tell you
[45:14] something paul says i'm going to glorify
[45:16] him amen i'ma glorify him or whatever
[45:19] state i find myself in hallelujah if i'm
[45:22] suffering i'm gonna glorify him if i've
[45:25] got more than enough i'm gonna glorify
[45:27] him in whatever state he finds me i'm
[45:31] going to glorify him
[45:33] hallelujah is that right
[45:36] listen
[45:37] so that you understand it's not just
[45:40] stop
[45:43] they said we come to worship and honor
[45:46] him
[45:47] so there's there's a worship
[45:50] and there's honor
[45:52] right
[45:53] and in order to honor him
[45:56] you've got to honor him through your
[45:57] sufferings
[45:59] hello somebody he said oh my god you
[46:02] know why do i have to go through all of
[46:04] this
[46:05] praise him
[46:07] when you go through it bring the
[46:09] sacrifice of praise honor him because he
[46:13] is the one that's leading and the word
[46:15] of god said the shepherd knows the path
[46:18] in which he's leading you
[46:20] hallelujah
[46:21] understand this this is why we need a
[46:24] man to see the word manifested it's not
[46:27] enough to preach the message of the hour
[46:30] preach it and and make the people feel
[46:32] good but we need to see a a
[46:34] manifestation of it
[46:35] we need because what happens is that
[46:37] manifestation of the word preached will
[46:39] always keep the true believer on right
[46:41] on the right track and then we won't
[46:43] have to worry about a system coming to
[46:45] spoil it
[46:47] you understand me because we can see
[46:49] jesus
[46:50] amen see the impossible it's impossible
[46:54] to honor god without faith in the
[46:56] promised word of prophecy now god
[46:59] promised us that we were going to come
[47:01] to the perfect stature of a christ
[47:04] and and if you can't honor him amen you
[47:06] cannot truly honor him without having
[47:09] faith in those promises
[47:11] hallelujah see the manifested world will
[47:13] always bring the true believer under the
[47:16] right authority
[47:19] oh it's true
[47:20] see that's what happened amen in the
[47:22] earlier church amen things became common
[47:27] even the prophet god said to brethren
[47:29] tabernacle how common things are
[47:31] becoming
[47:32] and he began to say no no notice that
[47:34] the philistines is upon you
[47:36] what happens you're cooling off the
[47:38] things that used to excite you don't
[47:40] excite you anymore
[47:42] and you know why
[47:44] because they start praying
[47:47] and when you stop praying
[47:49] you stop
[47:50] crying and oftentimes god make hardships
[47:54] come on you to bring tears
[47:57] tears are important to god
[47:59] that's why the prophet god said he
[48:01] doesn't believe in a dry eye confession
[48:03] amen because those tears are important
[48:06] to god it is something god is doing in
[48:09] your life
[48:11] to so
[48:13] in order for you to honor him
[48:15] now let me go on
[48:18] and i'll be i'll be getting with this in
[48:19] just a minute so that roman denomination
[48:22] of spirit always tries to kill the
[48:24] effect
[48:25] of the word
[48:26] you know everybody want to put it in the
[48:28] system you you can't do this and you
[48:29] can't do that and it kills the effect
[48:32] because the bible says who he whom the
[48:34] lord
[48:35] have set free is free indeed and and we
[48:38] want to put god in a box
[48:40] this is why we don't we don't see the
[48:42] move of the holy ghost like we ought to
[48:44] and we don't see the power of god
[48:46] falling like we ought to and something's
[48:48] got to be wrong
[48:49] somewhere we have allowed a system a
[48:53] damnable system to enter in and we'd
[48:55] rather have this rigid thing going on
[48:58] than to
[48:59] probably brother i'm saying like this
[49:00] you ought to get out of order sometimes
[49:02] just to get the holy ghost
[49:04] people need the holy ghost
[49:08] you understand me
[49:10] and god cannot build upon you without
[49:13] the holy ghost
[49:15] and where was the christ child found in
[49:18] a manger
[49:20] hallelujah
[49:22] in in a stable
[49:24] with animals and everything else in
[49:27] other words in order for god to be born
[49:29] he must be born in your manger your
[49:32] unclean heart this is where god comes in
[49:35] and he brings you to a place
[49:38] of suffering
[49:40] amen is that right oh lord you say i
[49:43] have suffered brother i'm saying you
[49:44] haven't even suffered till you get the
[49:46] holy ghost that's when it all starts
[49:49] hallelujah is that right
[49:51] now i'm just bringing you to something
[49:53] because i want you to understand your
[49:54] suffering is not so bad
[49:57] abs actually it's for your good
[50:00] you've got to have listen
[50:02] my subject is the gift the gifts i bring
[50:07] and that frankincense
[50:09] that myrrh
[50:11] and that gold
[50:13] must be exemplified
[50:15] in your life
[50:16] in order to be accepted
[50:19] you'll never reach perfection
[50:22] and each one of those
[50:23] particular virtues of particular items
[50:25] or however you want to look at it as i
[50:27] said they have a common element and that
[50:30] is you have to suffer in order for it to
[50:33] bring out its glory or its glow
[50:36] right
[50:37] it has to be beaten amen
[50:40] hallelujah is that right
[50:42] it's got to be beaten it's got to be
[50:44] wounded hallelujah tears got to come
[50:48] assumption about it
[50:50] amen hallelujah in order for god to
[50:53] perfect samson he had to bring him into
[50:56] a place where he could be beaten
[50:58] shackled scone rejected cry all of those
[51:02] things wounded he had to have all of
[51:04] that
[51:06] before god could crown his ministry
[51:10] paul too
[51:12] let me move on by the grace of god
[51:15] so you got to understand you can't get
[51:17] out of this
[51:18] samson got to the place that he was
[51:20] literally blinded but guess what
[51:23] samson never lost his faith that's right
[51:25] amen hallelujah and he said oh lord oh
[51:29] lord once more if i've allowed myself to
[51:32] be controlled by the philistines so much
[51:34] soldier i'm blind i'm shackled
[51:37] i've lost my freedom in the spirit lord
[51:40] please sir grant me victory over these
[51:43] philistines is that right amen and as i
[51:45] said the other day i think about it
[51:47] samson was so determined about his
[51:49] destiny until he said lord let me die
[51:52] with him
[51:53] he committed suicide in order to kill
[51:56] his his enemy
[51:58] now ain't asking y'all to go do that i'm
[52:00] just telling you that's what samson did
[52:02] right and he ended up in the hall of
[52:05] fame
[52:06] amen
[52:07] in hebrews 11 samson was there
[52:11] glory to god but he had to go through
[52:14] something to get there
[52:16] but he came through as a sacrifice for
[52:18] truth and hebrews 11 32 would tell us
[52:21] that see in order to you to get there
[52:25] you've got to give god your best amen
[52:27] and those three uh uh uh
[52:30] wise men came with their best
[52:34] is that right oh come on somebody it's
[52:36] nothing but the truth
[52:38] you think about amen the uh mary you
[52:41] know the prostitute she didn't go get
[52:43] some some little uh weird perfume but
[52:47] she spent all she had she gave her best
[52:51] amen what was she doing she not only
[52:54] worshiped him and understand
[52:57] in that out of basketball was
[52:59] frankincense
[53:03] and she was showing by presenting this
[53:06] frankincense her own suffering so that
[53:09] she that's why the bible said this woman
[53:11] has done a major thing
[53:13] she has anointed me for what my
[53:16] suffering my sacrifice
[53:18] somehow she was anointed to understand
[53:20] that this man was frankincense
[53:26] a tree
[53:27] that was going to be wounded a tree that
[53:29] was going to be bruised because in order
[53:31] to get the shap out of
[53:34] the frankenstein tree you've got to cut
[53:37] it
[53:38] you got to bruise it
[53:41] and when you cut that tree amen the sap
[53:44] the raisins what they call it the
[53:45] r-e-s-i-n
[53:47] it seeps out
[53:50] hallelujah
[53:52] and they call it the tears
[53:55] of the tree
[53:57] and that tree cried
[54:00] jesus was a man
[54:02] and he cried tears
[54:04] and the beautiful thing about the
[54:06] frankincense tree is that when it does
[54:10] it forms a scab
[54:13] and that scab heals the wound
[54:17] but the scar remains
[54:19] that's why the bible says he was wounded
[54:22] for our transgressions he was bruised
[54:24] for our iniquity and the chastise
[54:27] without peace was upon him and brother
[54:29] adam said it like this even though he's
[54:31] brought the healing the scars
[54:34] will remain there we'll see him amen at
[54:37] the end of the day with those nail
[54:39] pierced hands hallelujah what was it it
[54:42] was that it was that freaking sense that
[54:45] good smell y'all know what i'm saying
[54:49] and you got to understand
[54:51] that's how come god bruises you
[54:54] that's why he let people cut you
[54:57] that's why he let people harm you and do
[54:59] the wicked things they do against you he
[55:01] knows that out of that womb was going to
[55:03] come that real residence that's if you
[55:05] got the holy ghost
[55:07] hallelujah it's going to come it's going
[55:09] to heal that scar but at the same time
[55:12] that wound but the sky will remain
[55:14] hallelujah that's all right it's all
[55:16] right to have battle scars hallelujah
[55:19] and that's the way it is with with the
[55:21] with with the uh a true believer that's
[55:24] your gift to god
[55:26] not to go and fight
[55:28] not to retaliate
[55:30] none of us we do it sometime but that's
[55:32] not what god wants we've got to die to
[55:35] ourselves and that's where murray come
[55:37] in
[55:39] murr is murder's death
[55:43] murr is also somewhat like the
[55:45] frankincense tree but you know when you
[55:47] when you when you're getting the south
[55:48] out of the myrrh you got to go beyond
[55:50] the bark
[55:52] you got to really bring him a womb
[55:55] like that soldier did on calvary
[55:58] he just didn't scrape the side the top
[55:59] of the tree like it is with frankincense
[56:02] but he pierced him
[56:04] and then when you pierce that that
[56:06] murray tree that resins come out of it
[56:10] amen hallelujah but that murder is a
[56:13] healer
[56:15] used myrrh for healing did you know that
[56:17] and understand that even when it came to
[56:19] frankincense that the seed offering and
[56:22] and the sin offering uh they they could
[56:26] not have those without frankincense
[56:29] but when it came to myrrh
[56:31] they didn't use it like that
[56:33] but when jesus died
[56:36] married him came with their ointments
[56:37] and they wrapped him up in myrrh
[56:41] hallelujah
[56:42] because myrrh was that smell
[56:45] [Laughter]
[56:47] that literally covered the stench of
[56:49] your death
[56:51] somebody help me here see so you can
[56:53] understand by god's grace that these
[56:55] things are so much alike because you got
[56:57] to understand that even with gold you
[56:59] can find it in the river you can find it
[57:01] in the spring but most of the time
[57:03] gold you have to dig for
[57:06] and among the astrologers among the
[57:08] scientists i would say they say gold was
[57:10] a material that really when the
[57:13] supernova exploded
[57:16] that this node this supernova star
[57:18] exploded and a lot of pieces of the gold
[57:21] landed on earth
[57:23] think about it
[57:24] was a shadow of the type of god
[57:27] jesus who came from god
[57:29] and and landed on this earth
[57:32] deity gold is deity
[57:35] and the only way you can get it you got
[57:37] to escalate it this is what happens to
[57:40] you your trials your tests the things
[57:43] you go to sometimes is so unbearable but
[57:45] you got to understand that god is trying
[57:48] to escalate it he's trying to bring that
[57:51] gold out of you hallelujah and when he
[57:53] brings that gold out of you guess what
[57:55] it has to be beaten that's the only way
[57:58] that you're going to reflect him is that
[58:00] you must have that kind god hey and now
[58:04] i'm going to tell you like this you
[58:05] gotta that the goal he's talking about
[58:07] is the holy ghost in you
[58:09] hallelujah that's why paul said let
[58:11] christ be formed in you
[58:15] you got to suffer
[58:17] that's why you've been suffering maybe
[58:19] you haven't understood why you've been
[58:21] suffering and why i got to go through
[58:22] this and why is this god is forming that
[58:25] perfect man in you
[58:27] hallelujah and and what's happening is
[58:29] we've got to let go and let god amen do
[58:32] it
[58:33] let him do it because this this this is
[58:36] your gift to him
[58:38] paul said present yourself as a living
[58:40] sacrifice here you are lord
[58:43] sacrifice man whatever you got to do
[58:46] hallelujah bring out the frankenstein
[58:48] bring out the murder bring the gold amen
[58:51] so that people can see
[58:53] that you and i have become one
[58:58] hallelujah you love the lord
[59:04] think about it these three wise men
[59:07] were following the prophecy
[59:09] but they did not even know where they
[59:11] were going
[59:13] and they go to rome in jerusalem
[59:16] excuse me
[59:18] and i'll say like this
[59:20] the daughters of jerusalem had no idea
[59:21] what was going on
[59:23] just like in our day they don't have no
[59:25] idea
[59:27] because they've mixed themselves with
[59:28] politics
[59:31] they never did see the star
[59:34] they never did see the star y'all
[59:36] understand me
[59:37] you know what they they saying now oh
[59:39] that's some some whatever they did you
[59:41] know that can't be real
[59:44] and when it comes to the cloud they
[59:45] can't see that
[59:48] it you know because god brings down
[59:49] seven stars and then those seven stars
[59:51] seven angels however you want to say it
[59:53] form the cloud
[59:54] but they can't see that
[59:56] but it's not for them to see that's
[59:58] right it's only for those elected ones
[1:00:00] to see
[1:00:01] hallelujah
[1:00:03] the most valuable
[1:00:06] item of all times as i said
[1:00:09] they were the most valuable the most
[1:00:12] costly this gold and frankincense and
[1:00:15] myrrh
[1:00:16] see in order to serve god in order to
[1:00:20] honor him you honor him with your best
[1:00:22] that's why the bible says come into the
[1:00:24] house you know when you you give a
[1:00:26] sacrifice of praise but you know what we
[1:00:28] do
[1:00:30] to show you that a lot of us are are are
[1:00:32] not where we should be
[1:00:35] because we think we can honor god by our
[1:00:37] social clubs
[1:00:40] you understand me we come to church to
[1:00:43] socialize oh to see this one and to see
[1:00:45] that one and and and you know and that's
[1:00:47] not it
[1:00:49] you know you're no longer you're no
[1:00:51] different from what they do in the in
[1:00:53] the churches with politics
[1:00:55] you're doing the same thing it's the
[1:00:57] same spirit
[1:00:59] we come here to honor god
[1:01:02] and and when the preacher preach and you
[1:01:04] find people in their seats like
[1:01:06] who did you come see
[1:01:08] you come to see god
[1:01:11] you come to honor him with the praises
[1:01:13] of your lips with the clapping of your
[1:01:16] hands but most of all with your
[1:01:18] surrendered life
[1:01:27] i know
[1:01:30] the word of god called said to
[1:01:33] see the prophecy is going to be
[1:01:34] fulfilled yes
[1:01:36] and even in genesis 49 10 it says the
[1:01:38] scepter shall not depart from judah nor
[1:01:41] a lawgiver from between
[1:01:44] his feet until shiloh come and until
[1:01:48] unto him shall the gathering of his
[1:01:50] people be you understand me
[1:01:53] and when you saw those three wise men
[1:01:55] gathering from the north south east and
[1:01:57] west wherever they came from amen that
[1:01:59] was the gathering showing that one of
[1:02:01] these old days that same baby that that
[1:02:03] stood there two years old one day as the
[1:02:06] lord of lords and kings of kings is
[1:02:08] gathering all of his people
[1:02:11] why
[1:02:12] because they saw the star for their day
[1:02:16] you understand me
[1:02:18] this is why the prophet of god says
[1:02:20] listen
[1:02:21] god is storing up food yes amen
[1:02:25] this message is bethlehem
[1:02:27] amen hallelujah come on that's what it
[1:02:30] is the house of god's bread
[1:02:32] it is bethlehem in spiritual form
[1:02:36] amen and you and i must understand you
[1:02:38] cannot see jesus without this message
[1:02:42] you can't see it
[1:02:44] they had to go to bethlehem
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:49] oh lord help us lord
[1:02:51] those who can see the star of their age
[1:02:54] and walk by faith because they have not
[1:02:56] come this way before they are the bride
[1:02:59] of christ
[1:03:01] as i say astronomers didn't see him they
[1:03:03] couldn't see him but you can you have
[1:03:05] eyes to see
[1:03:07] listen we always played a part
[1:03:10] whatever god did we played a part it was
[1:03:13] gentiles that basically rule rule
[1:03:16] jerusalem and told and through their
[1:03:18] intellectual
[1:03:20] what teachers told the wise men where to
[1:03:22] go
[1:03:23] but you think it would have affected
[1:03:25] them
[1:03:25] see a lot of the people have seen this
[1:03:28] message have seen this picture have seen
[1:03:31] a lot of things but it means nothing to
[1:03:32] them
[1:03:34] because they are blinded
[1:03:37] hallelujah but those who have eyes to
[1:03:39] see
[1:03:40] they'll continue the father the star
[1:03:43] until they come to that resting place
[1:03:49] yes
[1:03:51] we look at this and understand that the
[1:03:53] tree had to be wounded that's the way
[1:03:54] they described when you're making uh
[1:03:57] frankincense and they say you have to
[1:04:00] wound the tree
[1:04:01] and when you wound the tree that's when
[1:04:04] that he shed tears now a lot of people
[1:04:07] don't think jesus cried but he did
[1:04:09] he even cried at lazarus tomb
[1:04:12] hallelujah do you not think he didn't
[1:04:14] feel the pain that he suffered he'd been
[1:04:16] going through calvary he felt the pain
[1:04:19] there's nothing wrong with crying matter
[1:04:22] of fact amen is best that god put trials
[1:04:25] on you that will break you
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] because that's what it's supposed to be
[1:04:30] we're supposed to suffer is that right
[1:04:33] because jesus said if you suffer with me
[1:04:36] you shall also reign with me
[1:04:39] take up your cross and do what follow me
[1:04:43] hallelujah it's no way out of it people
[1:04:47] horrible things can happen to you and
[1:04:49] understand that everything that happens
[1:04:51] to you is for your benefit
[1:04:53] children going wayward that's your
[1:04:55] crying time that's your time that's your
[1:04:57] molding time
[1:04:59] wife husband whatever that's your
[1:05:01] molding time that's your time of
[1:05:03] breaking down that's your time of god
[1:05:06] allowing you to cry those tears so he
[1:05:08] can come back and heal it
[1:05:11] the scar will remain
[1:05:12] but he comes to heal you of those tears
[1:05:15] heal you of that hurt is that right
[1:05:17] is that right that's what the word of
[1:05:19] god says why are s
[1:05:22] why is the children of zion why are they
[1:05:24] still hurt is there no bomb in gilead
[1:05:28] there's bomb in gilead amen hallelujah
[1:05:32] right so we go on
[1:05:35] and we know by god's grace amen that
[1:05:37] we're following truth
[1:05:39] hallelujah so as i said by god's grace
[1:05:42] when it comes to uh these three nations
[1:05:45] this frankincense and this gold god's
[1:05:47] gift amen brother i said god gives fine
[1:05:50] it's place
[1:05:52] you believe that
[1:05:53] amen let me let me just read a little
[1:05:55] quote and i i'm uh no let's turn to uh
[1:05:58] acts 9 15. it's getting pretty warm here
[1:06:01] acts 9 15.
[1:06:06] you love you love the lord
[1:06:09] acts 9 15. thank you brother
[1:06:16] i hope this is a blessing to you
[1:06:18] i know by god's grace the word of god
[1:06:21] has been such a blessing to me just to
[1:06:23] see
[1:06:24] uh and i know you probably said how can
[1:06:26] this three these three gifts represent
[1:06:29] the bride and i'm gonna show you in just
[1:06:30] a minute
[1:06:32] but by the grace of god you'll see that
[1:06:34] that
[1:06:35] jesus christ
[1:06:36] he laid as a baby but all three of those
[1:06:40] things he was deity in that baby form
[1:06:43] yes he was the frankincense in that baby
[1:06:45] form
[1:06:47] he was he was the uh myrrh in that baby
[1:06:49] form he had to die for you and i
[1:06:52] that was jesus
[1:06:54] and and it represented these it was a
[1:06:56] revelation laying before that child and
[1:06:59] it was basically prophecy of what was
[1:07:02] going to happen to him in his life
[1:07:07] so you can see acts 9 15 please
[1:07:13] i'm just getting too excited i guess
[1:07:16] but the lord said unto him go thy way
[1:07:20] for he has a chosen vessel unto me to
[1:07:23] bear my name before the gentiles and
[1:07:26] kings and the children of israel
[1:07:28] for i will show him how great things he
[1:07:31] must suffer
[1:07:32] for my name's sake
[1:07:36] paul
[1:07:37] was chosen and listen you know and i
[1:07:39] know there's never been an apostle like
[1:07:42] paul
[1:07:43] since brother branham
[1:07:44] y'all know what i'm saying even paul had
[1:07:47] to give recognition to brother brown i
[1:07:48] mean even uh brother branham had to give
[1:07:50] recognition to paul
[1:07:52] right paul wrote almost all of the new
[1:07:54] testament
[1:07:56] but he had to suffer
[1:07:58] go to corinthians he'll tell you i was
[1:08:00] shipwrecked i was dead three times i was
[1:08:02] beaten i had many stripes i went hungry
[1:08:05] i went naked and paul said and all of
[1:08:07] that
[1:08:10] that let the frankincense come through
[1:08:15] and all of that i still was a
[1:08:17] sweet-smelling savior
[1:08:19] savor you know what i'm saying in other
[1:08:21] words nobody still can't put a hand on
[1:08:24] me is that right that's what paul said
[1:08:27] paul said even touching the law i was
[1:08:29] blameless
[1:08:31] so we find out that paul says listen i
[1:08:33] was a christian i was born a christian i
[1:08:35] had a reputation of a christian and
[1:08:37] nobody can say i acted outside of
[1:08:39] being a christian
[1:08:41] i was like christ and i was so much like
[1:08:44] him they wanted to worship me
[1:08:46] that's what he said
[1:08:48] he said there were those who would
[1:08:49] literally would have plucked their eyes
[1:08:50] out and giving them to me because they
[1:08:52] thought i was jesus christ himself
[1:08:55] but that comes through suffering
[1:08:57] that's not the over overnight trick
[1:08:59] that's that comes through suffering it
[1:09:01] comes through maturing hallelujah and
[1:09:04] understand paul represented the seed
[1:09:06] that was planted amen
[1:09:09] the original seed
[1:09:12] ain't nobody going to do me like that
[1:09:13] well
[1:09:15] a sheep always forfeits their rights
[1:09:19] romans 8 17.
[1:09:23] this is blessing me people
[1:09:29] there have been times i almost got a
[1:09:30] little upset when people won't speak i
[1:09:32] said i just spoke to you and won't say
[1:09:33] nothing me so i've done it to like hello
[1:09:39] you know you got to calm that devil down
[1:09:41] right because he up there trying to try
[1:09:43] to make you say something do something
[1:09:45] that's not of christ
[1:09:46] and and you've got to stop him in his
[1:09:48] tracks
[1:09:50] hallelujah romans 8 17
[1:09:53] you love the lord
[1:09:56] the bible says if children and heirs of
[1:09:58] god and join us with christ if so be
[1:10:02] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:10:06] also glorified together
[1:10:08] that's what's killing the people easy
[1:10:11] living nobody wants to suffer
[1:10:14] and then the bible tells us don't you
[1:10:16] suffer as an evil dude that don't count
[1:10:19] only for righteousness sake only for god
[1:10:22] in the sake does god account count your
[1:10:25] righteousness

[1:10:36] i've listened to tapes today
[1:10:38] different ones why bethlehem and all
[1:10:41] kinds
[1:10:42] and it was just so much
[1:10:45] i'm steady trying to get it all
[1:10:47] and so by god's grace i'm gonna preach
[1:10:50] this again when i get the full armor but
[1:10:52] i thought i'd start this and do
[1:10:54] something with it so you can understand
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:57] your suffering is all in the plan of god
[1:11:02] if you want to reign
[1:11:04] you got to suffer
[1:11:07] god knows what we got inside
[1:11:11] and so that gold has to be dug
[1:11:13] and then it has to be beaten
[1:11:16] and i mean beaten until the image of god
[1:11:18] is formed
[1:11:20] that deity got to be on display
[1:11:23] it can't be still down there dirty and
[1:11:25] all that kind of stuff don't serve when
[1:11:27] he comes back he's coming back for deity
[1:11:30] right
[1:11:31] amen let me move on philippians 1.
[1:11:41] philippians 1 29
[1:11:46] for unto you it is given in behalf of
[1:11:49] christ
[1:11:50] not only to believe on him but also to
[1:11:53] what suffer for his sake
[1:11:57] having the same conflicts which he saw
[1:11:59] in me and now here to be in me
[1:12:02] so paul says i'm an example now you've
[1:12:05] heard all the conflicts and the
[1:12:06] afflictions in which i've had
[1:12:08] and this is not just for me it's for you
[1:12:10] too
[1:12:13] the fragrance of god has to come out
[1:12:15] that's right amen god has a bottle of
[1:12:17] tears he has tears that that he saves
[1:12:20] and it and it's a sweet savor to you to
[1:12:22] him
[1:12:24] knowing amen that you press through all
[1:12:26] the hardship i used to wonder lord how
[1:12:29] in the world
[1:12:30] these people of the ages have come
[1:12:32] through such a hardship and it looked
[1:12:33] like we got it so good new the truth of
[1:12:36] the matter is when you suffer from sin
[1:12:38] when you cease from sin you you know
[1:12:40] that's when god is you suffer
[1:12:43] right unbelief because one one thing for
[1:12:45] certain you know when you're truly sure
[1:12:47] of your salvation you tell everybody who
[1:12:49] you possibly can tell and in doing so
[1:12:53] you're going to come against some great
[1:12:55] devils
[1:12:56] right
[1:12:57] they're not going to believe you
[1:12:59] and instead they will persecute you
[1:13:01] but how many of us have been persecuted
[1:13:03] for the name of the lord jesus how long
[1:13:05] has it been
[1:13:07] one more thing let's move on you you are
[1:13:09] being blessed
[1:13:11] these three gifts represented the bride
[1:13:13] of christ john heirs
[1:13:15] in
[1:13:16] his
[1:13:17] suffering
[1:13:18] and even paul says i want to know him
[1:13:20] not just in the
[1:13:21] in the power of his resurrection but i
[1:13:23] also want to know him in his suffering
[1:13:25] see
[1:13:26] and we must understand when it gets too
[1:13:28] easy we're dating we're treading on a
[1:13:30] dangerous ground
[1:13:32] it's not supposed to be easy for us
[1:13:34] we're the bride of christ
[1:13:36] it's supposed to be difficult don't
[1:13:37] worry if we don't get it now we'll get
[1:13:39] it later because he tells us that the
[1:13:42] squeeze is coming
[1:13:43] right and he said when the stock market
[1:13:45] dropped he said ease of living will be
[1:13:47] over then
[1:13:48] so understand by god's grace is coming
[1:13:51] listen in the in i'm going to give you a
[1:13:53] couple of quotes and i'm going to let
[1:13:54] you go
[1:13:55] laodicean church agent says oh little
[1:13:57] flock
[1:13:58] do not fear this age is closing fast
[1:14:02] as it does those tares will be bound
[1:14:05] together as a three-fourth
[1:14:08] cord
[1:14:08] is not easily broken then
[1:14:11] we'll have a
[1:14:13] tremendous threefold strength of
[1:14:15] political physical and spiritual uh it
[1:14:19] says and then he says satanic power
[1:14:22] and they will seek to destroy the bride
[1:14:24] of christ
[1:14:26] she will suffer but she will endure amen
[1:14:30] fear not those things
[1:14:32] excuse me
[1:14:33] that are coming upon the earth
[1:14:36] for the for he who loved his own loveth
[1:14:39] them unto the end
[1:14:41] that's john 3 1
[1:14:43] 13 1 excuse me so you understand it's
[1:14:46] coming
[1:14:47] y'all we we we're looking at this little
[1:14:49] stuff that we're going through it's
[1:14:50] going to get and listen
[1:14:53] you need to know how to pray and you
[1:14:56] need to know how to to to die to
[1:14:58] yourself because that's the myrrh
[1:15:00] you got to die
[1:15:02] but god will wrap you with that mercy
[1:15:04] you'll smell good
[1:15:05] but you got to die and rot to all those
[1:15:08] things of the world
[1:15:11] ephesian church age that's why the bible
[1:15:13] said love not the world and all the
[1:15:14] things of the world and brother branham
[1:15:16] took it a little father he said if the
[1:15:17] speck of the love of the world is in you
[1:15:19] the love of god is not
[1:15:21] ephesian church asia says but not only
[1:15:23] is the candlestick of gold
[1:15:26] it is a beaten gold
[1:15:28] hand crafted of beaten gold according to
[1:15:31] her according to her according to her
[1:15:34] blueprint
[1:15:35] which were spirit given
[1:15:37] outside of the lord listen
[1:15:40] and the master jesus christ was ever a
[1:15:43] people so beaten and purged
[1:15:47] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:15:50] surely she is filling up the suffering
[1:15:53] that christ has left behind
[1:15:55] her good
[1:15:57] are destroyed her life is in jeopardy
[1:16:01] she is counted as sheep for the
[1:16:02] slaughter sound familiar
[1:16:04] she is killed all the day long that's
[1:16:07] scripture referring to jesus christ
[1:16:11] huh she suffers much but in it all
[1:16:15] retaliates not
[1:16:18] neither does she causes others to suffer
[1:16:22] worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[1:16:25] bride of christ y'all understand me she
[1:16:28] retaliates not
[1:16:30] neither does she cause others to suffer
[1:16:33] worthy there it is now honoring him and
[1:16:36] bringing yourself into a worthy state
[1:16:38] worthy of the gospel is the lovely bride
[1:16:41] of christ and as gold is malleable
[1:16:45] whereas brass will break with the
[1:16:47] beating this gold of god will bear her
[1:16:52] suffering for the lord
[1:16:53] not bowed not broken not destroyed but
[1:16:57] formed as a thing of beauty
[1:17:00] and joined forever by the trials and
[1:17:04] testing of this life
[1:17:07] see so when when knows why
[1:17:10] that star was coming together it was
[1:17:12] coming together for us
[1:17:14] shadowing the type of what god was doing
[1:17:16] and what he's doing in his last day amen
[1:17:19] is that right
[1:17:20] so we must understand by god's grace
[1:17:22] what the lord is doing
[1:17:24] god is working through our lives
[1:17:27] we understand by god's grace we've got
[1:17:29] to be wounded we've got to be bruised
[1:17:31] we've got to be beaten we've got to go
[1:17:33] through all of those things in which you
[1:17:35] know
[1:17:37] so you can understand what i'm what i'm
[1:17:39] saying
[1:17:43] even the prophet of god had to be beaten
[1:17:45] and wounded
[1:17:46] and who did the wounding
[1:17:48] god did it
[1:17:50] when the prophet disobeyed him
[1:17:52] he took his wife and baby
[1:17:54] wounded him
[1:17:56] but look what it brought forth
[1:17:59] he learned his obedience through the
[1:18:01] things in which he suffered
[1:18:04] sometimes god lets us go through these
[1:18:06] hardships these wounds amen just
[1:18:08] bringing us listen you want to be
[1:18:09] perfect that's what you asked for that's
[1:18:11] what i asked for
[1:18:13] i used to wonder lord why all my
[1:18:15] children why why why why
[1:18:18] this answered my questions
[1:18:20] because i can look back and i can see
[1:18:23] how
[1:18:24] intense my prayers were and how i cried
[1:18:27] out to god and how god healed me so much
[1:18:30] so that i don't even worry about it
[1:18:32] anymore
[1:18:33] that's the healing i trust god
[1:18:37] hallelujah i didn't understand it
[1:18:41] you know a lot of time we blame
[1:18:42] ourselves oh because i did no no no no
[1:18:44] no the the path of the righteous they
[1:18:46] are ordered by god
[1:18:49] they are if nothing happens
[1:18:52] coincidentally with god god has already
[1:18:55] staged it before you get there
[1:18:59] oh i didn't know samson was going to
[1:19:01] fall in love with delilah yes he did
[1:19:06] and he used that failure
[1:19:09] but look at look at ruth
[1:19:12] all the way in
[1:19:13] down there
[1:19:14] in moab
[1:19:16] naomi and all them they go down in there
[1:19:18] naomi and they she suffers
[1:19:22] and guess where she ends up back in
[1:19:24] where bethlehem
[1:19:25] [Laughter]
[1:19:27] the house of god bread and when she got
[1:19:29] back there that's when she prospered
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] what about what about uh uh simone and
[1:19:36] and and and and derrick jericho
[1:19:40] when rahab ended up dating and marrying
[1:19:42] samoan
[1:19:44] and what happens where did they end up
[1:19:46] bethlehem
[1:19:48] see you've got to understand amen this
[1:19:51] message god has hidden it it's a
[1:19:53] spiritual place to be it's somewhere god
[1:19:56] has ordained for those who follow the
[1:19:59] star they end up in bethlehem and as
[1:20:01] long as you stay in bethlehem you're
[1:20:03] going to have a birth
[1:20:05] you're going to see christ being born in
[1:20:07] you
[1:20:08] you're going to see a maturing of christ
[1:20:10] and don't get afraid when god has to
[1:20:12] rush you down to a place that's uncommon
[1:20:16] you didn't know you had to run down to
[1:20:17] egypt
[1:20:20] hallelujah because when he comes and you
[1:20:22] come out of egypt you think oh well i'm
[1:20:24] going to a better place and then god
[1:20:25] sent you in into nazareth
[1:20:28] and the bible said can any good thing
[1:20:30] come out of nazareth right but he puts
[1:20:33] you in the midst of a mess
[1:20:36] to produce gold
[1:20:39] to produce frankincense
[1:20:41] and to produce myrrh amen
[1:20:44] that's what it's all about
[1:20:46] and when jesus came
[1:20:48] out of that place
[1:20:51] we find him in the temple teaching
[1:20:54] never went to school
[1:20:56] but he had the wisdom of god in him
[1:20:59] let me tell you something
[1:21:01] at the end of the day
[1:21:03] if you haven't gone through those stages
[1:21:05] of god dying out to god and let those
[1:21:07] virtues come through
[1:21:09] and letting that life die in you so you
[1:21:11] no matter what people just just confuse
[1:21:14] the devil when they curse when they
[1:21:16] scandalize your name when they lie on
[1:21:18] you and they do do it
[1:21:20] they do it
[1:21:21] you got to smile and enjoy jesus
[1:21:24] because what you're doing now is
[1:21:26] allowing god's fragrance to come through
[1:21:28] you
[1:21:29] they can't stand it
[1:21:33] they can't stand it when they see god
[1:21:36] come through you and they know you ought
[1:21:38] to be upset they know you ought to be
[1:21:40] mad they want you to try to curse they
[1:21:41] want you to and you and here is jesus
[1:21:44] coming through
[1:21:45] right it's like stephen
[1:21:48] being beaten being stoned hallelujah and
[1:21:51] all he said was lord
[1:21:53] hold not these things of their charge
[1:21:56] what was it
[1:21:57] it was those
[1:21:59] attributes
[1:22:01] of that frankincense
[1:22:03] and that mirror and that gold that was
[1:22:04] deity coming through that that vessel so
[1:22:08] much so
[1:22:08] they saw the glow of the gold
[1:22:10] [Laughter]
[1:22:13] he said he had a face like an angel huh
[1:22:15] y'all love the lord amen i i trust i
[1:22:18] there's like i said not many here but i
[1:22:20] trust that those of us who are all i
[1:22:23] understand your suffering is not in vain
[1:22:26] especially if you're suffering for
[1:22:28] christ and i want to say to you amen i
[1:22:30] don't care if your husband leave you or
[1:22:32] your wife leave you or your children
[1:22:34] leave you nothing is more precious than
[1:22:37] jesus christ
[1:22:39] understand that's your treasure
[1:22:41] and you're his treasure
[1:22:43] and so understand that when he's molding
[1:22:46] you he'll never leave you'll never
[1:22:47] forsake you but he wants you to trust
[1:22:50] him amen and if you can trust him and
[1:22:52] have faith in this word
[1:22:55] i'll see you at the end of the day
[1:22:58] you love the lord
[1:22:59] let's stand
[1:23:15] he is so wonderful to us
[1:23:18] and i just appreciate everything that
[1:23:19] he's done for me in my life
[1:23:22] i can truly
[1:23:23] say i better understand
[1:23:27] what he's been doing with me all these
[1:23:29] years
[1:23:31] i couldn't understand why he had me
[1:23:34] leave lima
[1:23:36] uh leave colombia to lima from lima to
[1:23:40] here
[1:23:41] and all of this has been a process of me
[1:23:44] of god and me
[1:23:46] producing fragrances
[1:23:49] bringing me to a place to die and rot
[1:23:52] so that the glory of god can come down
[1:23:56] and i know that many of you can testify
[1:23:58] to those things
[1:24:00] but let go and let god have his way
[1:24:03] i can recall the time when
[1:24:07] peter said oh and they want to crucify
[1:24:09] him says no
[1:24:11] turn me upside down
[1:24:13] i'm not worthy to be crucified like my
[1:24:15] lord
[1:24:16] when they were thrown in jail peter
[1:24:18] james and john they didn't say oh lord
[1:24:19] words mean they understood that they
[1:24:22] were
[1:24:22] worthy of the suffering they weren't
[1:24:24] worthy
[1:24:26] and they thank god for his grace
[1:24:29] for allowing them to suffer for his
[1:24:30] namesake
[1:24:34] i've had to suffer for his namesake but
[1:24:36] it's been a long time
