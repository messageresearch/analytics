Bibles in the first book of Samuel chapter 17 we read verse the thirty first verse to the thirty seventh first same--no 17th or you wanted thirty-seven it's a story die everybody knows well that everybody is supposed to know the the challenge that David had Goliath had with David or with the children of Israel first Samuel 17:31 237 the bubble says and when the words were her wish David spake they rehearsed them before they rehearsed them before soul and he sent and he sent for it for him and every said to soul let no men's heart fail because of him servant the servant will go and fight with this Philistine and so say to David now are not able to go against this Philistine to fight giving poor sorry for thou art by the youth and he a man of war from his knees and everything on to soul thy servant kept his father speak and there came a lion and the bear and took the lamb out of the flock and I went now after him and smote him and delivered him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I called him by his beat by his beard and small him and slew him the servants Luke both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he has defied the name the the armies of the other of the Living God dare be said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the pole of the lion and out of the pool of the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine and so said unto him go and the Lord be with you let's turn again to say contains the 19th chapter we read from verse 8 to verse 13 second Kings 1918 so wrap shake so rub shake a returned and found the kena serie warring against Lebanon for he heard that he was departed from our lodges and when he heard say of Taraka king of ethiopia behold he has come out to fight against me he sent me sent messengers again unto a zakiya saying thus shall I speak to as a kayak king of Judah saying let not thy God in him that rusted the sea of thee saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the King behold thou thou has heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lanes by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nation delivered them wish my father had this role as Gaza as Anne Haran in reserve and the children of Haydn of Eden which were in where is where is the king of hmmm and the king of all

house of Lord and spread it before the world and as a kiya prayed before the Lord and said O Lord God of Israel which dwell us between the cherubims thou art God even though alone of all the kingdoms of Earth thou has made heaven and earth both bow down and then he done here and he'll open loyal and eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which has sent him to report the Living God over truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their names and have cast their guts into the fire for there were no god but the work of man's in wood and stone therefore they have

thank you and yet at the end of the service father God we will not miss to say thank you thank you for everything in Jesus name Amen I mean I I dealing plane to read to the verse 19 for them I feel like reading a tube you know to make everything clear and my subject this morning I mean this afternoon is wario's let's take up the challenge because if you read if you read and in those two Verte in those two chapters or those two books where we read you see that the main were challenged we see David was the the the army of Israel which Goliath you know standing and telling them that you know I will kill you all and none of you will come and fight against me because it was big it was huge she was tall and he thought they were stronger than everybody yes physically he was that's why it was a confidence into himself saying that you know I will kill everybody and he said before the children of Israel a challenge and that challenge somebody somebody had to take it up somebody had to go before him and say that hey we do serve a living God who can deliver us from your hand and and here we see it in second Kings we see that there were also another team his name was an Arab I used this verse this scripture one time when I preached the King the name of the king was in a grave he came and he said a challenge before the king of Judah before before before the king of Judah saying that your God would not deliver you from my hand and he began to show him how his father how his father killed other nations he began to show him how his father killed other other other Kings how other gods could not said free their kings and what he forgot was that the god that he was now challenging was different from the god he killed the god that he was now challenging was different from all other gods that he called that their gods could not save them you know he forgot that that's the part I forgot I forgot that the now that as a crier was serving a true and living God if Ogada Hezekiah was serving a God who was able you know to set him free if we forgotten Hezekiah was serving a God who was able to intervene to the fight and fight for him and he forgot all the you know all the fight that Israel had and how God delivered them from their enemies you know he forgot all of that and he came before them setting a challenge you know telling him that hey here's a challenge and now you can't you know your God can't can deliver you from that and we see that all those things you know went on to show us you know to give us the ability to trust God to give us the trust in God to give us the faith to build our faith you know to know that you know God has delivered people from the pinna past you know God has delivered the tune of Israel with everything ahead and is the same God today who can deliver us because we also as young people we do have challenges you know when you might not know it but we do have challenges when you go to work you go you go to school you have you are in in places where people don't believe as you it's a challenge for you because you have to keep a good reproach you know you go over the places and you see people you know cursing cussing and and singing you know it's a challenge for you you know cuz they don't believe that in this world that there's there's still people who follow the Bible they don't believe that in this world that's their people you know who all right they don't believe that in this world there's still young people you know who can stand and say hey you know this I don't do this this I don't say and this song I don't hear and this this this I don't do you know they don't think that there's still some other people and that is a challenge for us and that somebody has to take up the challenge somebody has to take up and show them hey Here I am I buy a Living Bible somebody has to go and take up the challenge you know we see one time David after going to the bottle you know he was coming home and and and and and and someone told him that his wife and and the wife of all these soldiers were taken and and that was also another challenge for David and he had to show that enemies that he was serving that God was more than able even though he didn't know where they went even though he didn't know who they took it but God was able to go and fight with him and to bring those people back and that is the same thing with us too you know you might have you know family people or friends or brothers going through a hard time you know you might not know what they're going through by your prayer is able or God is able to hear your prayer and to say them free if you only believe and the Prophet says that we need a man men and women who knows their position because if you see that all those people you know they knew their position you see David when was facing the challenge he knew his position that's why he could have gone to - so to tell him that - telling the experiences he had before you know he told them that experience he had with the lion he told him the experience he had with the bear you know telling him that hey I destroyed those those wild animals and I am able the God God that the god arisen with the God that is within me he's able to destroy this man again you know he had experienced God before and but and from those experience you know he had confidence in God he knew his position and he could have gone to show and tell him you know the same God who protected me is the same God today you know who will protect me against this one that's why you know experience is very very very important for us you know I I had my previous cuz this sermon was not what I planned to to preach today I had another one that are entitled a story of taking linear let me check it up again a story that becomes a personal experience you know cause because we went to our till Kentucky last night last week and we heard how those people the experience of the people you know who were a drug addict before you know who were you know who were who were drugged who were drinking and we were you know bad guys and how God has said them free and from those experience you know they were going and witness to people and God was saving them you know from the experience they had you know they had a standpoint they had some where they say that you know hey I have experienced God and they knew God and cuz we cannot know God without having an experience you know yeah they had something to stand you have to have something to lean on that you say that hey from that time you know God has become real to me from that time I have known God and he's the same God and and therefore I can face any other challenge because I know that God is with me that's why David had the experiences you know he could have gone to so and tell you and and and rehearse you know those experience and then so we have confident in their feel and when he was there he was not afraid because they knew that God was with him and the Prophet said that well this big Goliath walks out there that morning with all this great big crowds we though he's great big pounds after pounds and and Britain and breast plate he's big giant guards and everything worked out there and say made his great Boston said I defied the armies of Israel brother it happens it happens to fall on the wrong here and around the wrong ear that morning for him there was a little fellow standing out there know where he was it what we need tonight or this morning is somebody else who knows where they head what we need tonight is a man is men and women know who knows their position in cross Jesus and when the devil makes a big boat Heuer he makes it he makes his big boat he still making his boast with God who liest and we still got Davis to thanks be to God for that you know when you know your position they prophesy that even though the devil can come and make his big boss you know come to you and say hey you know I challenge you with this one I defy you you can't get it over you you know you can't get over this I got a challenge you I defy you I give you a sickness I give you you know pain I give you sufferings I give you Beatles I give you everything you know you can't get over it you know the devil a prophecy that we need David you know those people who can stand and say that hey you know I have experienced this with God and God is the same God able to do this you know cause he did it before and it's the same one over there because the Prophet says that God is the same yesterday today and forever and David was the man of faith but by Professor I Debbie was the man of faith and he knew where standing and he could easily tell so this experience because he knew God will back it up and and ago and he had that confident in God and the prophecy that he said but listen so he said I trust the Lord and I know even way long ago I took my slingshot and kill the lamb I killed a lion I killed a bear and and took his things right out of right out of the lab and took the lamb rod of right out of his mouth and when he rose up he slew him and he said and how much more will he give that answer uncircumcised philistine into my hand hallelujah there you are he know where he was standing he was a man of faith he believed God God was in him he knew he was anointed and and you know the same thing if you have yeah or if you're a Christian and if God hadn't elect you to be a Christian you will not be a Christian it's God's choice not yours no man seeks God no man seeks God at any time you haven't sought God but God I saw you it wasn't you calling for God it was God calling for you and when God called you is short he elected you he's sure he elected you you accepted the call he was justification and then you gave your heart to cross and he it was and was filled with the Holy Spirit and now you positionally placed in the body of Christ now if it made you quit your old man a bit you know old meet your old mean habit and as like a Christian how to they'll do that for you you know here your body cause it's a promise amen there you are you know when you know your position nothing can stand against the prophecy even you know there's even a quote that a prophecy that you know even cancer even everything nothing can stand against you you know we read last Sunday when we preached that the Prophet said that you know when you seek and the doctor tells you that today or you have you only have a few hours to live the prophecy that you don't have to accept it and if you don't have to accept that if you know your position you know the fifth that you're having cross because it's easy you know saying it's easy by believing it's another thing you know there's a song that says that faith unlocks the door you know we pray praying is easy you know praying you know words are easily spoken but faith is another thing because we have many people you know who testified that they're Christian we have many people who testify that have been with Christ we have many people who testify that they have had an experience with God but you know by faith but they don't but we find you know when they have problems when they have trials they don't have faith you know we have the tune of Israel in the earth in the desert you know in Egypt all of them had experience with God all of them saw how God created things all of them so how God said them free all of them you know so how God you know separated the Red Sea and they walked on dry land all of them so how God created the fourth for them all of them saw how God created water for them all of them had an experience you know most likely all of them you know my have you know they they have I can say that I have even more experienced up some of us do but but we see that when they can't but when they were challenged you know they're fair why because they did not have faith in God you know your experience you might have an experience but as long as you don't have faith in God you know that will not stand again you know your experience will become now a story I know God delivered me I know God you know created the water I know God you know man made me walked on the the dry land but but here is another experience where is the same faith that you had you know where's the same faith that you had but we need to have that faith you know in our entire life you know we need to have that fit there they can you know before God because God promised them Berlin but God never told them what they had to go through for them to get our land and they thought everything will be easy they thought that they will not have any challenge they thought that everything will be easy you know as God says that hey I give you this land so that we walked in that we walk in without a fire that we're walking without without you know without a challenge without anything and when they came and they saw those big man you know that was there and that in that city you know there be camp they forgot everything that God did for them you know they forgot all the experience that they had with God and when you forget your experiences you know you become weak when you forget your experiences that you have with God you become weak and the delicate is repair with you the Prophet one day is it all the story say it was playing he was praying for a blind man he prayed for the first time the blind man didn't see he prayed again for the second time he asked him he said that usually when I pray for the foot fall for a man for healing and if he doesn't if he's not here at the same place I tell him go and believe but he saw the desire that the young man had he wanted to see so bad and he prayed for him and he didn't see to the devil now be got be you know camp to his mind and tried to tempt him the Prophet said that the thing that he had to do was to remember the experiences that he had with God you know the Prophet was if we know it was remembering that all the experiences that God had with him and when he remembered those experiences that built up his faith you know when you remember those experiences they you know he had more confident and when he prayed again for the second time that man was healed and that's the same thing you may go through trials right now you may my you you know you might have challenges you might be sick you know the doctor telling you that yeah you can't get healed you might have things that you need to overcome but you know you need not if there now is the time to start thinking about what God has done for you in the past and when you think about what God has done for you the past then we start building up your faith that we start building up you're gonna feel you're confident and then you can go and fetch that devil and say that a devil I divided you before and then with God and I am still able to defy you again and if you only remember those experiences amen and and and the prophecy that you can I have a full foundation you cannot have a full foundation stand until you meet God so there is no way that you can say you can say that a I'm a child of God or I'm positionally placed you know in God's body without meeting him first everything has to start by meeting him first we see the Moses Moses was born with the gift Moses was born the Prophet says that Moses was born with the gift of faith but he had to have an experience with God to exercise that gift you know he was born it when he was born his mother was telling him you know about everything you know his mother was telling him how he had to set the children of Israel free and he went there and he was instructed by by the Egyptians and he was wrong and and he was smart you know with the with the Egyptian intelligence and he was well-trained and he thought that you know with the strength it was said that you know people we said the chin of Israel free but he forgot that he had to have an experience first you know and the Prophet says that the best way to serve God you have to have a bath you know an experience of God you know you have to know where to stand he says that one day when I was coming to church I was listening to in this sermon the Prophet said that was a young preacher and there was a young preacher who told his pastor he said that hey I need to go to school first you know to study the Bible and then he found out my bachelor degree on my daughter you know my bachelor degree and everything then I would go preach God and the pastor said that you don't need that you know the only thing that you need is to have an experience the Prophet said that's right you know we don't need all those bachelors we don't need all those things we just need people with the experience where they can say that I met God at this place and they can testify what I have experienced and if anybody here and if everybody here can testify can have the same thing you know we all can test five where we have met God you know we will see wonders and we will see things coming you know happening be among us you know we will see you know our miracles we will see you know wonders we will see God moving and the people will know that you know these guys and these people have met God and that they have been changed because they're watching you you know I was working I was at work you know working with a man you know it was my first time working with it just working and we were talking you know he understood that there was something in me that was different you know after the three days he stopped himself and saved me are you asked me a question if I was a Christian I said yes and I asked him why I said because you're different because my language is not like your language you know that's the you know that's the kind of experience you know that's the kind of things that we need you know we need to live a life of Christ not forcing it but yet to become natural you know you don't need to force it wherever you go you're living that life and you will have the same testimony everywhere and and that's the water when the prophecy that a Christian is to have the that the same testimony everywhere if I'm going to ask brother Frank about your testimony it will say the same thing and if I go ask brother Sam there's just a more LLL say the same thing and that will make you that that's what we need we don't need you know people who are based themself for all people you know who are followers of the crowd if you are with with sinners you become sinner and if you are with sense you become sense no we need people who knows where they stand you know no matter if they're living in a place where they're by themselves they can still you know bring the hollander to God and then the Prophet says that you save brother Brennan can I accept cross at my healer now he says certainly well they didn't then did someone ask him a question when what if in five minutes and what if I'm not feeling well in five minutes the Prophet says that you heal anyhow if you believe it you would ask me that question there is no question in your mind when you really you don't question it you believe it other people not questioning but you don't question it Goliath dragging Goliath says you see he was here last night and you didn't get here he was he was at the other meeting and didn't get here who is that answer Khan circumcised devil who is that devil that has no relationship with God at all who is that therefore that stands with nothing but defeated thing behind him his master was defeated recovery by a Lord and conquer hallelujah he's a bluff there that's all we won't believe him anymore down with him Jesus Christ Rob Satan everything he had he spoiled principalities and powers and dominions his domains reigns over the heavens are an earth and we are the subject of his domain my my that puts him where he belongs the devil thought they'd ever down there and Christ the victor you David you called elected anointed positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ but the baptism of the holy ghost Goliath you defeated a man he is defeated tonight and and if we all can stand and say that Goliath if this is defeated this morning you know we were you know we would not be you know nothing else we're coming our ways nothing else work on and look at how many even though we will you know look at how many of us are here and if we all can be together you know put our testimonies together and try to work together nothing will be nothing we're defeat us nothing will stand in our way you know if we all can be bound together in prayer and have you know this group of young people of testimonies you know who will have testimonies after testimonies nothing can stand in our ways and if you look at the Bible the New Testament you see that the book of Acts was is the only book that is not finished with an amen why because it's a book that needs to be continued it's a book you know that people needs to continue living the same book and and if you see and if we see the power of unity if we look at in Genesis chapter 11 verse 6 we will see the power of unity when people are together why why they can accomplish Genesis 11 verse 6 the Bible says and the Lord said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained for them which they have imagined to do why because they were all together they had all one language they had one objective they had one goal they had one thing one vision and God Himself say that nothing can be restrained from them you know they are able to do everything they can they're able to do everything they plan to do that's people who were not even Christian you know there were sinners but only by being together being unified God could have taken himself would have said that you know nothing can stop them from doing everything they wanted to do and God had to divide them for for stopping that accomplishment and what if we are Christians born of God you know Christian and and have the same faith have the same objective after the same goal have the same you know vision have the same language and what can defeat us what therefore can stand against us and say that we are not able to do you know why can't stand what can stand against us and say that if these people can't live the life they can you know if we all are together and if we all have wanted you know we will be able to accomplish everything because the Bible says that you know there's nothing impossible for them that believe everything that you believe as long as you have faith in God everything will be possible no matter how big it seems to be no matter how difficult that thing looks like you know it's all it only takes your faith the only takes of faith in God you know you know your position and you go to God and pray and God and God what we're certainly you know here you'll pray you know God promised that you know of Israel Palestine but they never told them you know why they had to go through you know God promised you things but he never told you why you have to go through so those little you know challenge that you have don't let this things discourage you you know you have a vision you have a promise go for it you know you have a vision you have a promise God promised you something go for it you know of course you will have trials because I remember long years ago I've read something the promise is that if you're doing something to go for God or if God has promised you something trials we always come you know you will always have challenge and that is the best way to know that God is behind it you know and whatever it is coming for the you know to your way on your way right now and he's trying to stop you from accomplishing while God has promised for you you know just have faith in God you know he promised it and he will do it as long as you have faith in God I mean doesn't matter what you have to go through even though you have to be sick even though the doctor has to say that this is your last day of living even though you see that you're a you wanted to do something and you don't have money at bills up to bills you know if God promised you something believe it and you will see it you know that you know of Israel never expected to see people you know who were you know who were are bigger than them because God has delivered them from Pharaoh so easily they didn't even have to fate you to fight and they thought that in the way that would a you know and everything will be the same thing but when they came before this trial they bear their fear and Wonder fear they're feared people who were fearing them because you see that when Joshua when the spy went to rehab where I began to tell them the testimony everywhere I had began to tell them what she heard and she told them that you know those people they fear you because they heard what God has done for you and your Goliath fear you because he is worried that they heard what God has done for you they heard why how God has set you free they heard our God has filled you with the Holy Spirit they heard how God has done things for you and they heard all of that and they know you and they fear you and and it's just as the prophecy is like a bluff you know it's just coming to trying to you know just trying to shake you a little bit and if you stand still you know God will make you you will go through if you stand still you will have everything you will have your possession you know just what you know after hearing what what Rahab said you know I imagine myself I mean you know just what I probably say that so why was all those people afraid of you know what they were afraid of people were afraid of them you know it's like a dog a dog is afraid of you but if he fears fear he will attack you and that's the same thing with the devil he's afraid of you you know the god he has been gone he has been conquered he has been conquered and and God conquered the devil you know recovery and and and he has nothing he doesn't have the power anymore and and he is fearing you so now what you have to do is to know where you stand to go and to remind him about what God has done in coverage to remind him about the position that he lost and when you remind him and when you have that faith nothing would stand against you you know in closing I want to say this as a lyric this are the lyrics from a song the song said the fight is on all Christian soldier face-to-face is stirring array with almost gleaning of gleaming and color streaming the right and wrongs engaged today the fight is on but be not weary be strong and his mind and in his mind hold fast if God before us his glory offer us will seek the victory which we sing the victor song at last we've got you rebound to the promised land resurrected Lord Jesus he's here now you believe it that's the Prophet asking the question the prophecy hallelujah there was on the move for Jesus the chief captain said in my name they shall cast out Devils they fail to get it 40 years ago but we coming now processing the land the same pillar of fire the same chief captain is leading the host of the Lord it's your land God promised to prosper you in Hell he gave you the body it's yours my it's your possession the devil is trying to take it over he hasn't got any authority to do it he's trembling tonight hallelujah great world of God's power moving in the building setting his trembling is it trembling Oh what if they only have faith his hearts about God it's melted in him why oh you say well the doctor said yeah but they realized that the host of the Lord is moving in now that's right no matter how high is what ah no matter how high is warded he may have warded out of the side of the doctor but he wasn't worthy out of the side of God he might be a great big Bluff to the medical science but here habla a big buff to God hallelujah if you only believe you know if you're honorable if God is here and the only thing is taking is your faith that's the only thing that can touch God you know this woman it was Bush she was was in blood everything was everybody was touching God everybody was touching Jesus people were touching Jesus even harder than her people were touching even the body of God Jesus people were that even the hand of Jesus people were touching all the PAS every part of Jesus but she didn't have to touch the part she only touched the garment the hand of the the you know they did the hem of the garment but what one make heard one made a touch a touch very special was because she had faith and that faith just God and took his virtue out of him and then and today if your faith can touch God is still the same God today to delivery if your faith can touch God is still the same God to dare to stand you know to stand for you if your faith can touch God is the steer still the same God to dare to set you free it doesn't matter whatever what you know what what you have done in the past it doesn't matter what you know what sin you have done how much how big it is if you are you if you can only have faith you know Calvary is there and the Prophet said that he never seen a man going to college and coming the same something has to happen either you have to be sealed with the seal of God or you have to be a seer you know with the seal of the devil you know something has been happening and if you can come to Calvary today you know if you can come to cover it today God is still the same God you know it doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't matter how hard it is it doesn't matter how impossible it is God would still make a wish you know tread imagine the chin of Israel standing before the sea and seeing Pharaoh behind them coming none of them could have thought that God would make a way out you know people began to complain and they began to cry because the situation was bigger they what in their faith the situation were bigger you know then why did the authority they they they thought that the situation was bigger than God but Moses had faith and it took by the faith of Moses you know to God use the faith of Moses for the way out and if you can only have faith the Prophet says that you can have faith for you and even for your family you can have faith for them there were one time but I'll tell the story and then closed hey baby came to the altar and a prophet had to pray for support for him I forgot what sickness he had and his mother was there and the Prophet tell they told his mother said we can have faith for this baby you know and that is the same thing to death today you can have faith or we can have faith for someone that you care it the more we can have faith you know for anybody that you have in your mind any situation any problem if you can only have faith in God God will see God when you know God will make a way food if you can only have faith let's stand and brother friend will come you know if you can only have faith have faith in God you know that is the only thing that will set you free only thing faith nothing else [Music] bring to God like this it's Matthew chapter 18 verse 19 he says again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven so I'll repeat that part that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done of them of my father and I just had this one quote that also came into my mind when he was speaking he says you just her brother branham he preaches he says this in the message influence of 63 he says you just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivals you could have so if you just have two good members in a church power of unity and here we are more than two so if we could just get in one of four every time people got in one Accord the Holy Spirit came down in the upper room 120 people were filled with the Holy Ghost Paul in Silas when they go to Monaco the prison walls fell so we just have to be one Accord I know many times when we are at home school at work the week just goes by so fast and our minds are so preoccupied but just to need this moment just this moment that we have just try to concentrate yourself consecrate to God I know many of you asked for this to be able you know to have time to pray so just now after such a wonderful message has been preached let's just get in one Accord I believe in this place we can have a revival a new revival starts with the person in the church so if each and every one of us bring their revival imagine this place would be explosive so let's just sing this song just because he lives I can face tomorrow we are warriors just because of God because he won't have a future able to overcome just to say so let's just think this song a couple of times and then each and every one of us pray in your own way [Music] eally I confessed [Music] all I beer is
