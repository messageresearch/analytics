TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God has given us everything we need to be ready in this journey. I you know this morning I was even thinking I was like we really don't have an excuse anymore in our age because now we even have cell phones when you can just type a quote real quick. The devil is bothering you on something. Let me see what the the word says about that thing. Satan, I chop you off with that word. You know I chop your head off with that word. We don't have an excuse anymore. &gt;&gt; Everything is in your hand. What are you going to tell God? &gt;&gt; Those people that receive the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; they believe the same word that we are reading this morning. &gt;&gt; William Brandon, the prophet William Brandham, he did not preach any other words. Everything he preached was just in this Bible because he said that everything Paul preached I have preached the same message. So why is there no fruit in your life? &gt;&gt; You have to make yourself ready. The coming of the Lord is at hand. It it pains me to feel that there are some people you sitting here very comfortable living in sin as if nothing is like as if they'll keep living forever and this morning I can feel the spirit of God groaning and and crying out for those people. You know the prophet says you only go to hell because of yourself because God is going to do everything he can to save you. &gt;&gt; Because he the Bible says he doesn't want anyone to perish. You only go to to hell because of yourself. &gt;&gt; The prophet says that God doesn't judge you for falling but he blames you because you refuse to take his accepted way. What is way is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I I understand sometimes there are times that in your heart you want to do what's right &gt;&gt; and then you end up falling and you have this certain addiction that you keep falling over all the time but in your heart you really desire to be closer to God. You know the prophet preach on the message uh why are so many people tossed about? And in that message it says that there are some Christians. They are Christians. &gt;&gt; The prophecies they are Christians. But then um they keep finding themselves falling short all the time. No victories, weak Christians. The prophet says the difference is because they are not living in the holies of holies. They are not in the shikina glory. They are not in that place where God has put his name. I'm inviting you this morning if you are struggling. You know, don't give up. You know, don't give up. Get on your knees. You know, God say, "Lord, I surrender everything to you. Jesus, I've tried everything I can as a man. I've done everything that I can. You know, but now I give it all to you, Lord. I give these addictions to you. I give this fear of drinking to you. I give the spirit the spirit of laziness to you. I give the spirit of beating my wife to you. I want to be a better Christian. I want to be a better Christian, but I keep falling. Lord, I want to serve you more. I want to read my Bible more. I give it all to you. The Bible says after you've done all you can, after you've done all you can, stand. Oh Jesus, this morning I've done all I can. I'm feeling like I want to give up. How many people sometimes you feel like you want to give up? &gt;&gt; Lord, why is it so hard for me to live a life as a Christian? &gt;&gt; Lord, am do am I not loved? Do you not care about me? Brothers, I'm not just preaching to you. I'm preaching things that I've experienced myself. I've gotten times where I wanted to give up. I've gotten times where I felt like God didn't care about me. But I'm telling you this morning that God has your names written in the palm of his hand. &gt;&gt; He can never forget you. If you are his, you will never be lost. Just keep walking. Just keep walking in that stairs until you reach a higher dimension. The problem is that you are stopping. The moment he says, "Lord, I give up. Lord, I give up. I want to give up." You are stopping. The prophet says that's a mistake you make. We're talking about rapture. The Bible says Enoch walked with God. &gt;&gt; So why are you stopping? &gt;&gt; Keep walking. &gt;&gt; Don't let the things that you fall hinder you. We read that the Bible says the righteous run into thy name and he's safe. The refuge. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that the righteous man is that person that um when you when you fall, you get back up. Get up. What did you do yesterday? Don't feel down. This morning, God is telling you, get up. Continue your walk as a Christian. Psalm 34:3 says, "Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together." Together. When we come into the church, we should have one purpose is to exalt his name. And then how do you exalt your his name? &gt;&gt; You notice your brother there has fallen short. &gt;&gt; You don't pick up the phone and you call someone else and be like, "Hey, did you hear what happened there? If you don't have the courage to go to that brother and talk to him yourself, then set your mouth and get on your knees and pray because we exalt his name together. The worst thing is there are even believers sometimes, a brother or a sister in the church falls short and you pick up the phone and you call someone else who's not even a believer. Who are you glorifying? Let us exalt his name together. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that uh there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Moses. No condemnation for them that are in Christ. So if you feeling condemnation, maybe you're not in Christ because the word cannot lie then get in Christ so that you don't feel the condemnation every don't let let us never ever take anything away from God for what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; I'll read this one quote real quick. The prophet says in the message God's chosen place of worship paragraph 49 He said a man called me not long ago in in Texas. He said, "Mr. Brother, if if your name if your name is not on our church book, you cannot go to heaven." That's a that's the attitude of a lot of people. Unfortunately, even in this message, if you don't go to our church, you cannot go to our pastor is the only pastor. &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes you even go other places and they want to start an extension. Because only if you listen to our pastor that you will go to heaven. The prophet says, "Would you ever think of that?" He says, "Don't you believe such a thing as that?" Your prophet is telling you that they think you have to belong to this to that certain church or you cannot go to heaven. The word tells us that's wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; To believe that is Antichrist. I say this, if you believe such a spirit, you are lost. It's right there. It's a prophet saying that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because salvation is not in a church. &gt;&gt; Salvation is only in one name. The prophet says he put it in his son Jesus when he and his son became one. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, get the people to Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't get the people to, you know, like sometime I I even I heard of of this one song like they even talk about the whole song is talking about the prophet's weapon like the prophet the prophet's rifle. Like what are we doing? I don't recall in a psalm any songs in a psalm talking about just any other weapons as the main theme of the song [Music] &gt;&gt; brothers I'll read a quote where the prophet says that &gt;&gt; the devil is woripped in religious places now &gt;&gt; and we do it unaware sometimes you know talking about the prophet's weapon. And there's another song I know I've heard &gt;&gt; like those song is just William like just from the beginning to the end &gt;&gt; who is glorified &gt;&gt; William Prophet William Brandon wouldn't want that &gt;&gt; because he says that his purpose is to point you to Calvary &gt;&gt; and he says pointing you to anything outside of Calvary is a failure. We don't come here just to to know all the stories that happened. And unfortunately, there are some people they know more stories of the prophet than they even know of Jesus Christ. Sometime you go to church a church and a visitor comes in the church, &gt;&gt; they go out of the church just knowing more about a name William Brown than even Jesus. &gt;&gt; Nothing against them. the name William Brandon. We need the message of the prophet in order to make it to the rapture and we are grateful for God for the message. But what is the message? You know what is the message? You know we keep saying we believe the message brothers when you say you believe the message it's not I believe in William Brham. No, I believe in the message that he preached which the message is Jesus Christ points the people back to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I I I did I did a research. You know a lot of people they like those kind those kind of people they they used to they like to use this statement. Oh what about Moses in the Bible? They used to always refer Moses Moses. Moses. Well, I did some research and I saw that in the Old Testament, the name that is mentioned the most throughout the entire Old Testament &gt;&gt; is Yahweh or Elohim. And to even go further in the entire Bible, including the Old Testament and the New Testament, &gt;&gt; the human name that is mentioned the most out more than any other name is the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Go do your research. You'll find it. Jesus comes the first place and I believe the name David comes the second and then Moses third. So why there's no it's not it's not just in vain that God kept repeating the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's put things in the proper place. &gt;&gt; William Brham is the prophet of God for this age. &gt;&gt; He is not to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; And when I say worship I don't say oh in the name of William. No. Sometimes the way you you talk about the prophet can seem as if you are worshiping the prophet. &gt;&gt; When you make everything seem as if it was the prophet himself doing that instead of God doing that through the prophet. &gt;&gt; The prophet says I don't he doesn't want to take any credit for it. All credits goes to Jesus Christ. All credits goes to Jesus Christ. And even in our lives, we want to make sure that we give all the credits to Jesus Christ. When the minister, all they talk is just me, me, me, me. That's not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is a jealous spirit. And he will not share his glory with anyone. There is security in the name of Jesus. There is safety in the name of Jesus Christ. It doesn't matter which church you go to. Imagine if you had put your trust in a church. &gt;&gt; Then what happens when you go outside there when the demons follow you there? Is your church with you outside? When you go to work, is your church with you at work? Is your pastor with you at work? Is the prophet William Brandon with you at work? Prophet the prophet passed away already in 1965. &gt;&gt; But he said, "You may kill the messenger, but you will never kill the message. The message will live on." So the me what is the message? The message says, "I will never leave you." Do you understand what I mean? Never. Even when you backslid, you backslide, I will not leave you. You know, he said never. He didn't put, oh, unless if you have this condition. The Bible, the prophet says once God saves you, he saved you all once and for all. So why put in a I want to put in a my trust in someone that is with me everywhere. We want to lift up the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's a song that says in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, we have the victory. You know, in the name of Jesus, Satan, you have to flee. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, Satan, this morning, you have to flee in the name of Jesus. We have the victories. The battle that we kept falling all the time. The battles that we kept falling under all the time. But in the name of Jesus, we have the victory. I want you to say that with your own mouth. In the name of Jesus, I have the victory. You You need to start claiming that name. The more you claim the name of Jesus, the more victories you keep having. Why? Because when you call on when you claim the name of Jesus, you call on Jesus. And when Jesus comes, he says, "Oh, brother, sit down. Let me fight your battles for you now." And once Jesus fights your battle, I reassure you this morning that he's never lost the battle. Oh, Jesus has never lost the battle. It doesn't matter the size of the battle. My God is bigger than the battles. It doesn't matter the size of my problems. My God is bigger than my problems. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the size of what I need. &gt;&gt; My God is bigger than what I need. &gt;&gt; You got to believe that your God is bigger. Your God is bigger than anything. God will only be as big to you as you make him. If to you God is small like that, then you will keep losing all the time. We have the victory in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you come in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; no weapons formed against you will prosper. No weapon, it doesn't matter if it's an atomic weapon, the the things that Satan throws at you. When we come in the name of Jesus, it will not prosper. It will not prosper but you will prosper. You know because it says I know the plans I have for you. &gt;&gt; The plans not to harm you but to prosper you. Oh I I want to prosper. I want to prosper in my finances. I want to prosper in my life with God. I want to prosper my the way I lead my family. But you got to take the name of the Lord Jesus with you. Don't never forget that name. &gt;&gt; There was one man in the Bible in in the Bible, his name is David. &gt;&gt; David took the name of Jesus with you in the battle against Goliath. &gt;&gt; There was a challenge that came in front of David. And all the children of Israel were scared of Goliath. I wonder if that's us this morning. &gt;&gt; Goliath kept on making fun of God. and they were all afraid. You know, I wonder if that's us this morning. What is that golite in in your life that keeps making fun of your living God? What is that golite in your life that makes fun of the God of this message? I know the God of this message is real. The God of this message is not just a story. He's a reality. And he's actually right here this morning, you know. Who is that Goliath that's challenging the the living God? &gt;&gt; In 1 Samuel 17:45, the David says, "Then then said David to the Philistine, &gt;&gt; that cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield." Verse 45, you know, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; the God of the armies of Israel, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou has defied, Satan, I'm serving you. And notice this morning, you know, you have challenged the army of God. You get the people of God so weary. They come to church tired. You disturb their mind. Instead of focusing on the preaching, they are thinking of something else. You have challenged the spirit of God. You may come with all the tactics you want. You may come with a sword. You may come with a spirit. But this morning, I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I challenge you. And I say this morning, we will cut off your head, Satan. I believe that this morning the devil will be cut off. &gt;&gt; I believe that his head will be cut off. &gt;&gt; I believe that you will walk out of this place free. Satan, you better hear me. &gt;&gt; This day, verse 46, this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand. And not my brother, but I will smite thee. So tell the devil right now, that devil that's been tormenting you for years, that devil that's been tormenting you forever, tell him that this day. This day the Lord will deliver thee in my hand. And I will smite thee. You need to stop saying that with your own mouth. I will not smite for you. You will smite him yourself. You notice he doesn't say God will smite thee. He says, "I will smite thee." But later on you say, he says, "The battle is not yours, but it's the Lord's." Why? Because it's not I that the says, "He that is in you is greater than he that's in the world." When Christ is in you, the hope of glory, you can tell the devil that this day &gt;&gt; I will smite thee. &gt;&gt; The the gospel is the demonstration of the gospel. I mean of the the gospel is a demonstration of the power of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I can't I don't want to preach a Jesus of just a theory. I'm talking about the name of Jesus this morning &gt;&gt; and that that name has power &gt;&gt; this morning. There's nothing that can all the afflictions that you came with. &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk out the same. If you take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will see that that that demon leave you. Because if you just go out the same, then why serve God? &gt;&gt; Why serve a God that won't even fight for me? Jesus is real. &gt;&gt; Jesus is real. &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan, you heard me. Jesus is real. Hallelujah. And Jesus is in this building. And I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray that you leave the hand. You you get away from God's people. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Bible says every knee shall bow in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you must bow because in the name of Jesus Christ, every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. In your life, you want to confess that Jesus is Lord. &gt;&gt; But how do you confess that he's Lord? It's only if he's been lo to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to manifest yourself to me. How many times have I been here giving testimonies after testimonies? But I don't say just to to talk about myself. The reason why I give testimonies is to help you know that God, if God can do it for me, he can do it for you. To let you know that God is not dead. He's alive this morning. He's alive and well. You know the Muhammad's grave is still closed over there. You know, all those other prophets, their graves are still there. You know, like all those gods. But we have a God whose grave is open. And you can't even you have an invitation to go to that grave as proof. There is no one there. Why? We have the only God who has risen from the dead. Jesus is not dead. He's alive and well this morning. So why continue in suffering? Why is my people crying? Why are they suffering when I've laid everything here in the world for them? Why? Why don't you have the Holy Ghost? We need to have more Holy Ghost powers in this building. We need to have more revivals. The We need to see the power of God here. Why are we not seeing that? May God be merciful to us. You know, Goliath challenged the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And you notice David had five stones. &gt;&gt; Five stones in his bag. The prophet says those stones represents Jesus s. Five stones. The name of Jesus Christ. David knew that you have challenged God. But with the name of Jesus Christ, nothing shall stand against thee. Nothing will stand against me when I come in the name of Jesus Christ. I know that I will have the victory because I have the name of Jesus with you. Brothers, take the name of Jesus with you. When you go out there on the streets, take the name of Jesus with you. When the temptation comes your way, take the name of Jesus with you. Temptation will come. But we fall because we don't take the name of Jesus other spirits not myself. Every time I have such a bad spirit come on me. You know every time I mention the name of Jesus Christ and I rebuke that spirit or I thought he leaves. God is my witness. Many times we fall because we don't call on Jesus. When you call on him he's there to be found. Verse 477. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spare, for the battle is the Lord, &gt;&gt; and he will give you into our hands. So this morning, I'm talking to the devil. This assembly, they will know that the Lord saveth. They will know. this assembly will know that the battle is the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Don't let Satan bother you. Don't let Don't let him make you fear. He's just a He's just a bluff. The prophet says he's been stripped of everything at Calvary. Satan doesn't even have anything to harm you. He doesn't. Jesus making noise &gt;&gt; and we're exposing him this morning. &gt;&gt; But you remember there's another place the prophet says that &gt;&gt; the only time Satan has power over you &gt;&gt; is when you have unconfessed sins. There's not the prophet says they can pour as much oil as they want on you. It will do nothing if you hide that sin. What are you hiding? You think you think you hiding it from me? God can see what you be watching on your phone. You think God does doesn't see that the text message you send to someone? You think God doesn't see that? What is that that you think that God doesn't see? &gt;&gt; But it's just as simple as you just get on your knees. Lord, forgive me. It's not that complicated. Why are you letting Satan still have a grip in your life through unconfessing? Verse 51 says, "Therefore, David ran and stood up on the Philistine. He took his sword. He drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off and cut off his head therewith." And I love this. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, the person that they looked up to was dead, they fled. Well, Satan, I'm here to point you to something. Go read Revelation chapter 20. Your champion is dead there. The Bible says he's thrown into the lake of fire. So therefore, you better be on the run. Demons, you better be on the run already, you know, because our champion, the Lord Jesus Christ, you know, he's here fighting our battles. Don't fight your battles yourself. He's a strong tower. He's a strong tower. I'm going to uh wrap up real quick here. The prophet says in the message, this great warrior David, he says, "Where is the Goliath?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Who is the Goliath, Brother Brano?" He says, "That cancer that's eating you up, &gt;&gt; that tumor that's hanging on you, &gt;&gt; them cataracts on your eyes, &gt;&gt; that crippled arm, &gt;&gt; everything looks at it and says it can't be done. That thing that like it seems like it's impossible to be done." &gt;&gt; The devil says you might as well quit believing. I wonder if Satan has told that to anyone this morning. The prophet is saying it's your Goliath. He says you might as well settle down because you can never uh no more get well. He says, "But the Christ that made you stop your drinking." I wonder I'll probably stop here for a minute. the Christ that made you stop your drinking. &gt;&gt; So what is the defense of brothers in this church drinking alcohol? &gt;&gt; I mean we claim to believe the same message. Maybe come Simeon and Sime show me a different message than this message. Because we all call ourselves message believers. I wonder if we are believing a different message. Oh no, if I just I can't drink just a little bit. That first of all, that's a lie of the devil because you will stop by drinking a little bit and you keep drinking more until you find yourself drunk. Then who do you glorify? But you have to know you cannot stop it on your own. &gt;&gt; The Christ that made you stop your drinking. &gt;&gt; You got to give it up to Christ. You got to give it up to God. Lord, I can't overcome drinking. You that the prophet is talking about help me to make to stop my drinking. Like you actually making fun of God. You just I don't get that. You just keep drinking &gt;&gt; and you are people get drunk and you come to church, you go to like I don't understand what is going on. &gt;&gt; What is going on? &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I have not shown to preach to you the gospel of Jesus Christ." I'm not going to be afraid to preach the gospel because this is the gospel that will set you free. And if you keep living in your drinking way, you will not make it to heaven. If you keep going in your drinking way, if you die right now, you go to hell. Why would you want to go to hell? The prophet says, "I don't even want my worst enemy to go to hell. You have no idea what hell is like. smoking, &gt;&gt; lying, &gt;&gt; stealing, talking about stealing. You You might say, "Oh, no, I don't steal." No, you steal from God when you don't pay your tithing. When God blesses you, he gives you a job. 10% of of it belongs to him. So, when you don't pay your tithing, you are stealing from God. But you remember it's like God that help you even pay your tithing. &gt;&gt; I've given you an before a testimony how one time I I needed money and then I was not I started not paying my tithing for some time and then u but in my heart I was like God help me to I want to pay my tithing and I was like God I promise you I'm going to start paying my tithing. And then one day I was just praying in that vegetable over there &gt;&gt; and then um I see someone message me says God spoke to me and told me to give you this money and the money that he gave me was exactly what I needed to pay my tithing. I took all that money and I just paid right away for tithing. I didn't even want to wait for another day. So if you are struggling pay your tithing, ask God. He will help you. He will help you stop your stealing, your lying. He saved you from a life of drunkenness. You know in person you know nothing is happens but just like that with God. There's no hazard because why did the prophet mention drinking the first time and he comes back again? He saved you from that life of drunkenness. When you read this, are you able to say also that God saved you from a life of drunkenness? &gt;&gt; If you're not, then you better repent. But that's why we come to church. The Bible says the the church is a house of correction. I don't mean to talk bad about anybody here because I myself have things that I struggle. I myself have things that I need God to help me with and I need your prayers. You know with the Bible says exalt his name together. This is a one body. We pray one for another &gt;&gt; and then I cannot see a devil here and just just let him be so comfortable. I don't like Satan to be comfortable. I don't like when Satan comes to church cuz the prophet says Satan comes to church. &gt;&gt; I don't like when he comes and he just comes comfortable sitting in the church. No, I want to make him uncomfortable. And I believe every Christian needs to make the devil uncomfortable. May God be merciful to us. How can you get drunk as a Christian? And you've never even been drunk in the spirit. Why? Then you will never want to be drunk in this world again. You know the same God that that saved you from drunkenness, from riing, from sin, and a devil's grave. God can do that for you. He can save you from your TB. He can save you from cancer. He's a He's a Goliath. &gt;&gt; Don't take his boast. Stand in the name of the Lord Jesus. and challenge him to a showdown. The prophet is saying, &gt;&gt; "You are struggling with the spirit of lying, all kind of spirits, drinking. He's telling you that he's just a Goliath and it's just a boast, but come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and challenge him to a showdown positionally in Christ. The believer know his position, he'll have it. And he says, "God's great spirit is here. &gt;&gt; And his holy ghost is ready to fall on anybody that will believe it. How many needs the Holy Ghost?" The prophet says his spirit, he's is here &gt;&gt; and is ready to fall on anybody that will believe it. Hey man, I'm finding I'm looking for a place where to wrap it up. Um, I'll I'll end up with this one question. Sorry for being long. So, in a message, the patriarch Abraham, the prophet says, "What did he do? He set out and he conquered sickness. There could be no sickness around him. Wherever sickness was, he conquered it. What did he do after he conquered it? He gave us the keys, saying, "Whatever you bind on earth, I will bind it in heaven." That's the royal seed of Abraham. The Holy Ghost in us now with the keys holding it to sickness. Sickness cannot stand in his presence. Verse 63 also temptation. He was tempted in every manner like we was. I wonder if Jesus went he was he turned the wine into water into wine. The Bible says he was tempted in all manner like we was he he would he probably got tempted too in all manner. Every manner that's how he understand us. Then the prophet says what did he do? He conquered it. What did he say to us? Now he told us how to conquer it. resist the devil &gt;&gt; and he will flee from thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when does like like I'm really trying to help you this morning. I'm not trying to go hard at you, &gt;&gt; but I'm trying to help you overcome the spirit of drinking when you see a cup of alcohol cuz I mean unless if in your heart you really don't even want to be set free at all, then that's your own problem. But if you want the Lord to help you, he's helping you right here. You see a cup of alcohol. You know, the prophet says resisted. &gt;&gt; And there's another place say, what does resisting means? It means to simply turn away from it. You see alcohol here, I'm not going to take it. But don't you think it's just going to be that first time? I'm not going to take it anymore. &gt;&gt; He's going to come again. You know, I've had moments where you do something and you leave. You start regretting. You're like, "Ah, why did I not do it?" &gt;&gt; The devil is not. He said Delilah with Samson. She kept going to Samson. She kept going to Samson. You see the first time you overcame. Don't rest. Satan is going to come again. He gives this time he gives you like he probably gives you to on a discount, you know, and your favorite alcohol drink. &gt;&gt; But every time you see that temptation, the prophet says, "Resist it." That means keep walking away from it. And one day you keep resisting, resisting. And one day you see alcohol, it doesn't even mean anything because that devil has fleeed from you. The prophet says that resist the devil and we flee from you. He conquered sickness for us. He conquered temptation for us. &gt;&gt; He's done it for us. He broke down the gate. He took the key away from the temper, handed over to the believer and said, "If now this is what God is saying, what Jesus is telling you If Satan tempts you, &gt;&gt; so that means he knows that Satan will tempt you. Resist him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he will free flee from you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The prophet insist again resist him. &gt;&gt; So it's something that he comes the first time.
