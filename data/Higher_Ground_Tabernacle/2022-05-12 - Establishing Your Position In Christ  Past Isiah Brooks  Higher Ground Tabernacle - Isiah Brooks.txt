little song came to me that we used to sing years ago kind of like on the jubilee style and so we're trying to sing it tonight jesus is the light light of the world jesus is the light the light of the world jesus is oh jesus is the light he's the light of the world lord jesus is take my life oh jesus everywhere shining in my soul jesus he's the light of the world amen everywhere i go i'll take my light amen amen before i forget brother guardian gave us a song now i can't sing that tonight or it's a nice song it's a real nice song the fullness of the lord and uh by the grace of god i um if you have you given it to the musicians okay and uh did you find that or you wrote it you wrote it wow it's wonderful oh where's my phone i'll let you hear it at the end of the service amen it's awesome you show your body [Laughter] [Music] it's beautiful it's just i it's beautiful um and i think we should we we should you know every song that god brings through him that we can sing we need to sing it amen because it's not just for him it's for the church the fullness of the lord that's wonderful amen well i saw where he said he wrote it but i mean i want to make sure [Laughter] it was really it's really good you'll see i won't have to brag on it but i thank god for the inspiration that god gave him and for those who helped in whatever way you helped uh it's really to me as a masterpiece one thing i want to say by god's grace is that i was telling the brother the other day i take my leadership as a pastor i take it very very seriously i wish i was perfect one day i will be perfect in manifestation i'm already perfect because he made me perfect but i mean when it comes with that manifestation but i can assure you that everything that i bring as the word of god i try my best to make sure that it is the word of god and should i make a mistake it's up to you to tell me and make me know that i've done something wrong [Music] and i want to say to every young person always well i will never purposely deceive you or mislead you in any form of fashion god is my witness he stands as my witness today on what i'm saying by the grace of god i realized and i was telling that brother i said not only do i preach the word for my soul but i have children i have a family that even if they should come back to the lord they should follow the teachings and god knows i want to see all of my family say so i said all of that because it was just weighing on my heart sometimes we we have spirits and spirits have a way of accusing people you think sometimes you see things when you don't see hello i've been there uh by god's grace that's why i always test it first i had somebody say well brother brooke you you confessed too much you you you confessed too much no the bible says if you think that your brother has an art against you think it it's your duty to go to that person even if you're wrong it's okay because you'll be corrected is that right so i thank god for it's grace i had i had to say all of that uh to assure uh you uh and whoever else that whatever the enemy is bringing to your mind about me you know is truly a lie as we stand thank you musicians we really appreciate it i stand amazed on where god has brought me from and i can truly say as they always say he's brought me from a mighty long way i still got some distance [Laughter] but in my heart and mind it's my purpose to achieve the goal in which god said we would make so this is kind of like a part two i i preached this a little bit at in iowa city uh last sunday but i thought that it was something that i should bring to the church here as well i know everybody don't get a chance to look at the youtube because i myself can't say i'm totally faithful to doing it but i do it whenever i can and uh so we thank god for his grace saint john 15 we're going to start at the fifth verse there we'll read from uh the 15 the fifth verse to the ninth and then we'll go to saint john 4 23 and 24. you know i've been dealing with prayer and i think prayer is so wonderful and i think sometimes even fasting maybe god will give me grace to work with that because i'm learning i'm learning you know uh and uh because it is a beautiful thing to fast but you we must learn too fast to not increase faith be fast because we have faith and we also fast because we have a purpose we we need god to do something and [Music] for an example when david's son uh was sick the baby child and the prophet had already told him that the child was going to die it did not hinder david from fasting and praying and count calling on the name of the lord pre-adventure god would change his mind but we realized by god's grace that god did not change his mind and once the fasting was over david was pleased and they couldn't understand why david began to worship and start eating and they thought it should be just the opposite nothing wrong with fasting now don't get me wrong it literally brings you closer to god it's of the afflicting of your soul you afflict your soul so that you can get closer and feel his presence and know his will so anyway let's move on i'd like to entitle this message establishing your position in christ john 15 5-9 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you you believe the word hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love john 4 23 and 24. but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth let us pray father god we thank you you have ordained us to be your temple even though we gather in this place we know where the throne room is and father we thank you as we speak of you because your word according to saint john out of the mouth of your dear son you said he said father i would that they be one even as we are one and father the very glory that we had and shared together i pray that you would give this glory to them but father here tonight i say because you know uh the depths of my heart you know the depths of all of our hearts we're not glory seekers we're nobody but we just want to be the kind of vessel that will give you glory that will give you honor that would raise up your name as the savior of the world knowing that you are the same yesterday today and forever speak to our hearts commune in our hearts and may your glory be revealed in our hearts so that we would better understand our position in you granted this morning or to tonight as we thank you once again for living in us being in us and most of all hearing our prayer may our prayer be your prayer lord if we should error in our prayer we pray that you would make intercessions for us in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i put it in my pocket because it kept falling that tape is not working hey yeah we have to get what's one of these things a rubber band will work too but you know god is so good to us remember we said we worked with teachers lord how to pray prayer is so important it's essential it's a communion with god and we understand that calvary bind the breach we know that calvary made it possible for ben and god to commune and talk with one another without any great sacrifices because he was that sacrifice he was the bridge that brought us back into heavenly places in christ jesus without jesus christ we are nothing we can't do nothing he as he said he he is divine and we're the branches in other words the life that's in the vine must be in us otherwise we can't do nothing even jesus himself who was a man yet god said i can't do nothing except the father show me same with us we are part of him he is the creator and by his grace he has made us little creators the scripture talks about abiding in him that means residing in him that means living in him walk in the spirit talk in the spirit whatever you do even paul says do everything in the spirit that spirit is not a human spirit it is christ the holy spirit so god intends for us a man to walk in his spirit that's the only way that he can be glorified the bible tells us also that if we are in him we will bear fruit that means you won't have to do anything the fruit itself will come through you it is his process it is the the life of the vine to produce fruit on the branches all we have to do is remain connected and abiding we look at this thing and jesus says in that ninth verse which i lie love of the 15th chapter as the father has loved me so i so have i loved you continue ye in my love now when you think about this love this is unconditional love this love is a love that god gave us before the foundation of the world the bible says according to saint john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life i love that word believeth that e.t.h means continue to believe and we're living in a time where everybody declare that they're worshiping god but the bible says in this hour which is what we call the last days jesus said you must worship me in spirit and truth the father seek as such what is the father the father is the holy ghost the father is the holy spirit however you want to say it the father is god god in creation and that's the part of god no man has seen the bible says no man has seen him he's a spirit it's like the wind you never see it but you can see the effects of it that's how it is with god you can't see him the spirit part of him but he can declare himself he can declare his presence by the effects right that's why when people were being healed and delivered the blind eyes being opened jesus said that's not me but my father and i come in his name that he might be glorified so is it with us there is no healing power in us it's god in you the hope of glory so we understand the hour has come spirit and truth and this is why it's so important to understand that god is one he told israel that god cannot lie god the lord thy god is one not three personalities in one person or one being because that would make god schizophrenic if you had three personalities in you you would be locked up in the crazy house except they'd be agreeing and if you had three persons in you now let me say it like this if you had three of parts of god in you like that which one started first see god is eternal so he never had a beginning nor ending when we say god is a spirit and this is why you know people don't understand you can use this body you can clap you can raise your hand you can do all you want that's praise but when it comes to worship only a few can really worship him and worship is not singing or dancing or shouting or praising god worship is living amen when you live for god that's the greatest worship you could possibly give god you know i looked and i think i've said this before when when i was in south carolina there was a young man that looked just like michael jackson same kind of hair same kind of everything and i don't know whether he could sing or not but but he was impersonating michael jackson and listen i said to myself well that's the greatest worship he could give to michael jackson to impersonate him to love him so much to you want to look like him act like him you know everything he did that's what you want to do that's god that's worshiping god you want to look like him you want to walk like him you want to act like him you want to talk like him you want to be so much like him like they were in antioch when they first called the christian call those people christians now we look at this thing and i'm going to try my best not to be too long every time i say that usually i take it too long but we have to uh how can i say it in in the world today in where we are today we have to change uh you know mentally what we think of god spiritually what we think of god consciously what we think of god solely what we think of god because most of us have been deceived yeah i'm not saying you deceive now but there was a time that every one of us was deceived and the bible said that everybody that came out of the laodicean age was deceived they were blind and naked and didn't even know it and then we come to the message and we find out that god is not uh no denomination or organization is the thing that you're supposed to be connected to the only person you're supposed to be connected to is god amen those systems don't mean a thing they cannot save you they cannot change you they cannot convert you all of those things comes only by god who is the holy spirit amen you understand me now we know by god's grace and we said that even the bible are pretty this way because i want to mix some of this in when the seals were open brother adam said it put us back into the place before the fall well before the fall there was no altar that's right amen before the fall there was no building amen before the fall there was nothing but relationship that they had with god and all we know that as far as on the record the bible said in the cool of the evening god would come down for fellowship i've had scientists have said that the dimensions were so connected to god in heaven or the earth in heaven was so connected that that that even adam and adam could listen to the angels sing in the morning i don't know how true that is but you see that's where god is taking us to bind heaven and earth again amen and everything you say no brother that came yes it is because the bible says in the prayer lord teach us how to pray and one of the things he said let thy will be done amen in earth as it is in heaven amen so heaven and earth is supposed to come together amen can you imagine going through all of this what is the purpose of all those saints who have died all the saints who've gone on who's desiring to come back to the earth for what because this is your original home this is where god created you fleshly you know what i'm saying this is where he breathed the breath of life in adam amen and god is going to recreate this thing you know renovate it as the prophet of god use he used the word renovate in in in in in the uh future home and god will renovate and he says listen this is what god must do for you you and me as individuals god has to renovate amen it's not enough to be justified it's not enough to be sanctified i'm saying i don't do nothing wrong well with that attitude you've already done wrong amen because the bible says amen that your sin your righteousness is as filthy rags that's right amen hallelujah the bible said even those who have not even sinned after the similitude of adam will be judged so you and i without the blood of jesus christ we're nothing but sinners but thank god for election thank god uh uh for predestination that god knew you he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew every trial every situation everything every fall every get up every lay down every whatever god knew all of that and guess what he still loved you god just didn't give us unconditional love his love has always been unconditional that's right amen there was no priesthood in the garden there was no traditions there was no easter there was no there was no you know what with that uh i want to say christmas but santa claus days none of that fourth of julys nothing the whole realm was based upon worship and serving god and manifesting god in the flesh because you see no man could see god but when god enveloped and dwelt in mr adam and mrs adam that that the whole creation even angels would be were able to see something they had never seen before because remember that spirit of god was always veiled even in heaven lucifer was the covering angel he veiled god so if anybody knew anything about god he did but even lucifer could never have a true revelation of who he was because only god gives revelation and if lucifer had known and had seen there was no other god he would have never desired to be one he didn't see it yet we come in a day where god is trying to produce not trying where god is producing and creating himself again in human flesh now this stumbles so many people that's why they couldn't see jesus it's always been christ ever since uh genesis all the way to the book of revelation always been christ christ is god the anointing there's only one anointing there's only one holy anointing let me say it like that and that holy anointing is elohim god amen that's why the bible says they that are led by the doctors of divinity no they that are led by the spirit of god what they are the sons of god why did jesus say why why why because that was the way adam and eve were in the beginning they were led by god adam didn't wake up and say you know what i'm just going to name these animals no sir he was led by god to name the animals and because adam and god were so connected the very thoughts that god had adam had this is why the bible says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus because the very thoughts of god was in him the bible said in him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily he was a man yet he was god god of this evil age he says god own thinking god the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was god and did not did and did and did you know you were in him then amen this is like this is what really excites me because i'm coming to know who i am not isaiah clara's brooks's son i was god's before the world began hallelujah the bible said your name my name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world that's before god started creating it he knew you is that right he told jeremiah i knew you before you was formed in your mother's womb come on somebody you need to whip the devil with this truth when the devil says you're lost when the devil says you're no good when the devil says you you won't make it you let him know i am a sheep and jesus said my sheep here is my voice and the stranger they will not follow that's what makes you different from all the people of these ages because you heard the voice yes everybody else saw a prophet we saw god behind the prophet like it did in israel they saw moses but there were two joshua and caleb saw god behind moses hallelujah one thing about the true sons and daughters of god you cannot hide god from them amen hallelujah there's no place to hide him amen as soon as he opens his mouth you know who he is you say what do you mean brother that woman at the world a prostitute she heard the voice of jesus and she didn't call him bills above but she was so connected with god because she had a gene seed on the inside of her that when that voice began to speak she knew something was different that's why we can listen to the tapes that's why we can understand the tapes it's not the private man but it's the prophet god who is jesus christ on the inside listen if you come to hear me speak you're not going to get nothing but if you come to hear god he'll drop a seed he'll give you something amen hallelujah listen see and then if they be so i'm trying to hurry the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of jesus christ and then when jesus died at the cross i died with him yes wait a minute how could i have died with him if i wasn't there but what you fail to see is that you were in him that's it amen hallelujah my and then when jesus died at the cross i died with him for i was within him then is that right the bible said levi who was not yet born paid tithe in abraham so when abraham was paying tithes levi was with him amen you understand me i didn't know all my children they were with me i didn't have to wave a wand they were in me and when my wife and i union amen she became the bedding ground and i planted the seed but those seeds didn't all of a sudden show up they were with me even before i was born i don't know how god does it spiritually he knows where to place every seed in whatever body thank you lord amen it is what it is listen let me tell y'all something so that you understand at the end of the day you got to know jesus for yourself one thing that i happened before the crucifixion was that judas betrayed jesus don't think you're getting out of here and out of this world without betrayal somebody will what you're gonna do when that happens the bible even said their family will be against family brothers like your sisters and fathers against mothers and all of these things now what are you going to do this is why i keep telling you you got to know who you are amen look beyond all of your faults look beyond all of your failures because that's not even what god sees all god see when he looked at you is representation he knew you before the foundation of the world so when like i always tell people you don't know who's sitting next to you you need to know who you see who you are right listen only jesus knew who judas was except when jesus told john and that's a revelation in itself is that right if jesus told john then then this jesus that we know will tell john again the bride will know [Laughter] like i said i know i got a storm coming it's okay but you know what i i'm he prepared me because i realize i have no burdens everything that would be and would have been a burden i'll cast them on him so we look at this thing and we know by god's grace when jesus died at the cross he said i i i died with him for i was was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested what later you understand me the bride is something or someone christ jesus manifested in this day it's not good enough to say i go to i belong to the message what's that no i belong to jesus christ amen hallelujah and he is the message today living it out of me and through me so it is with you if you are the message you have the revelation of the word of this day and is living through you it's not in just your head it's living through you knowing that we would be manifested later and we was at calvary with him we went in the grave with him and we raised with him and his resurrection and now we're ex ascended by his spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus always amen sister divine did you go take that trip on this weekend just know who you are no fear okay i just felt led to say that you go rejoicing in the lord the lord is will take care of everything now we're looking at this thing and we know by god's grace that god has a amazing you know he was talking with brother rich the other day and and really it's it's the truth god what are you trying to hide there's nothing to die you can't hide from him you might as well be truthful yes sir amen truthful with yourself truthful with others like i was telling somebody you know how i overcame a lot of things oh god delivered me from unknown and unknown says no i called the demon by his name amen amen amen yes sir call it philistine call it the assyrians whatever but you know i called him by the way he's identified and the way he manifests itself through me i called it amen i called him i don't say well lord i don't i don't have no problem lying what the bible said all men are liars oh not some all and guess what you're going to do it every now and again even if it's in your actions and what do you do with that you repent you ask god to forgive you you ask god to cleanse you lord i'm wrong god loves to hear those words i'm wrong and you're right he loves that and he's right there the bible said he heard you before you even called hallelujah listen in the writing of the son he says now look at transfiguration we was everyone repented there there was the living i was represented excuse me everyone was represented there there was a living saints that had raptured there was elijah standing there and there was moses and there stood moses the dead saints represented also both of them had quickening power whether one died or the other one didn't die they're all there the thing that they had the commonality that they had was that they all had quickening power hallelujah y'all know what that means they all was in christ and christ was in them amen hallelujah elijah had so much power on his bone a dead man was raised to him y'all understand what i'm saying it don't leave you and then the devil says see god doesn't left you he's a liar once you get the holy spirit on the inside of you god who said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you the problem is you forget who's abiding in you god abides in you amen let me ask you a question when you get anybody been in a wreck or close to an accident you say jesus all of a sudden it literally turned the automobile or whatever it saves you and then you walk away you think you did that the bible said you are encompassed about what greater clout no uh great cloud of witnesses you have angels is that right the bible said he has built a wall of fire about you you don't need to be afraid it's almost an insult to god to fear satan huh you three authorities in your mouth lord i can't cross over i can't cross over yes you can the bible said it's in your mouth speak it and you don't have to beg him what are you talking about just meditate on it talk to him in the temple you don't have to tell the devil everything talk to him in the chamber you think god don't hear you he heard the pharisees when they called him the other bob he caught their thoughts then you think being a child of god god don't know your thoughts shame on you you don't have to tell the devil because when you tell the devil the greater the fight is going to be because now he's got his army against you resisting you amen you better hear what i'm saying learn how to pray right like i tell people when i want god to hear something i don't want the devil to hear i shut my mouth amen and when i shut my mouth i don't have to worry about being deceived because he didn't hear it amen amen only god knows the thoughts of the heart do you oh come on folks listen god is through god don't ever if if god can't solve your problems here in this dimension how do you figure you're going to get about the grave going to bring you up out of the grave your faith in god amen you think about what the beating jesus got think about that beating you and i can't even fathom it we can't even comprehend it but but according to history they said they had beaten jesus so much he didn't even look like a man he was so swollen and out of shape from the beating and and everything and you know the devil you know he had one scripture thou shall not leave my soul in hell neither will you allow my flesh to see corruption he had that trust in that word yes sir amen to look what he looked like when he died how could anything come up from that amen but it was god who quickens amen and that's not bad see when he won the war over death hell in the grave everybody that died believing in him got up yes sir and like i said the other day we always think that don't say that grave was open at easter no it was not the bible said when he died and gave up the ghost the graves were open so he was open that means they got up amen before his body was resurrected think about it amen they were quickened i don't know maybe i think i think about ezekiel when you know they ask the question can these dry bones live that army they have been dead for ages almost and god connected those bones and he connected that sinew and he connected that flesh and they stood up amen then all of a sudden a breath of wind came forth and the bible said they walk like an army march like an army uh uh listen they were destroyed or killed in the valley i don't know what the whole battle was all about but one thing for sure they had god and because they had god a prophet had the word to resurrect them amen jesus god let a man by the name of ezekiel speak to those bones a man y'all think that's powerful when when when joshua says son stand still but he was a man seeing her only look like they've been defeated in the valley and god raised them up and said the battle is not over yet amen you mean to tell me god can't fix it for you we used to sing that song let jesus fix it for you for he knows just what to do whenever you pray just let him have his way no matter what the problem is let jesus fix it for you yeah let jesus fix it amen i always liked that part that last part it's real it's real god is so real i often think about how god told my mom not only will i be saved but i was coming into a greater message years after she was gone the reality came to me amen god god ain't held back by no dimensions this third dimension don't mean a thing to him the bible says he's in us above us he's with us he's through us he's right now here the angels of god are here heaven is here you set him in heavenly places right now in christ jesus he said you believe that he said we shall rise in him we become part of him the easter the revealed secret of god like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and y'all understand me when you were quick into this message when god showed you the revelation and i'm not talking about your head i mean your heart at that time that's when god quickened you [Music] you have passed from death into life amen thank you lord yes he said we are now alive who are once dead in sin and trespasses the true easter seal has broke has broke death from around me and i'm alive what are you saying what was the seal it was thing that shut it up that kept it from being said and listen people every age had a seal what was the seal that sealed the truth was was the denomination and the organization's creeds and dogmas took the word of god put it on a man you can't be saved unless you be in this church or you be in that church it's all a lie there's only one church and that church is blood washed by the blood of the lamb that church is jesus christ is it listen oh i'm in the message oh my but it's the message in you see that's the point being around brother berlin's message being around this message does not save you that's more like being around moses did it save him no the revelation that quickened joshua and caleb that's the saving grace when you know you who you are and you stop trembling at the devil's voice you you you trembling you know and we can read we read it we read it read it read it we read it right there oh moses why christ speak we hear it but when it comes our turn we're like israel that ran away from goliath there must be davis here somewhere if you just got one revelation jesus christ it's the same yesterday and forever hallelujah one revelation god cannot lie one revelation whatever god says must come to pass hold fast to that you don't have to do nothing but wait you know when moses held that rod which was a representation of the word he didn't say waters back up back up back up no it was a word now fulfilling what god had already in his mind to do but he used moses to do it so is it with you every trial come to be everything satan comes and brings your way god has brought it to you for you to defeat it amen god ain't got no cowards no cowards hallelujah oh and then when it gets rough oh my god we act like peter lord carried out not that we perish god's hell ye of a little faith where did you doubt i have fed you have clothed you i put shout over your house i've done everything i've given you help i've healed you i've kept you from being sick whatever the case may be i've been there for you where do you doubt him now what devil in hell can defeat jesus christ when jesus himself has defeated the death hell and the grave amen you just gotta wait on him like the brother branham said let go and let god yeah that's what's been defeated me in the past i love my children so much thinking i've given them up thinking i've given them up and then god gave me grace to give them up that don't mean i don't love them i love them i pray for them but i've come to recognize i cannot save them the word of god is the only thing that can save them but god gave me a promise you understand me and i stand on that promise that he's going to save all of them i don't know how he's going to do it it's not my business amen amen my business he is just that he promised it amen so why should i worry and fret and oh lord you know what i'm saying we've got to give it up we got to release all that you know it caused you to get bald it caused you to get gray it caused you to wrinkles it caused your heart attacks it caused you what what what arthritis and all those things come by worry and stress amen and being faithless now ask i gotta ask you a question you know god tried you've got to try god as word the bible says no evil shall come nigh thy dwelling place and then when it comes we never think about that we we need to we need to think about it because if no evil comes you know he's going to come now your dwelling blades that means you know i heard something brother branham said the other day and i was just in god proving his word he says when when people get sick doesn't necessarily mean it was the devil he said god allow things to happen to draw you closer to him so let me put it this plainly usually when things happens in the house happens in your life personally and you don't know that god allows it to happen to bring you closer that's what it's all about this is rapture time this is translation time and god is bringing us closer however whenever however he choose to do it it's fine with me i don't care i'm just like yes sir job says though he slayed me i'll trust him do you think the devil is behind this no god is behind it the bible said he's the author and finisher of our faith amen what do you think moses felt when he saw pharaoh coming at him but lord you told me you you know i'm going to deliver them and look like we're going to all die he probably wasn't the only one thought like moses have you brought us out here to die something affected him where he cried out and god said in my return shut up why christ speak we we as human beings we're so we do it we do it we just do it and the disciples did the same thing just after the revival jesus walking on the water they see him coming and they're afraid of him and today is the same day people are afraid of the holy ghost this is the time where the waters are just choppy and the storm is going crazy and now the holy ghost is trying to come and you know what i'm saying trying to see make you see who he is and and you know oh it's a ghost you know they're looking at listen that's what's happening in this message people are afraid of the holy ghost you know why because we want to control god you'll never control him you can't control god god controls you let go and let god be trust them folks that's what the vibes are trusted i love that scripture trust the lord with all your heart and lean out to your own understanding now i know i'm going much longer than i thought i would go almost an hour already but that's okay let let listen what brother bradley it's his own experience in it's it's the rising of the sun he says oh aren't you glad i'm so glad way back down yonder in a little old cold shed one morning the seals were broken and i raised i raised with him a new creature his quickening power he said the sun is up now you understand what he's saying he said the day that i god broke the seals in my life he broke the seals amen i began to see who he is the revelation of christ filled my heart he said that's when i was resurrected listen people oh you was resurrected yes i'm resurrected if i wasn't then how could i be in heavenly places it ain't the ending of it it's the beginning of it amen glory amen but you've got to be resurrected here life must come here first before this could ever change that's right we say oh i'm in the rapture do you really believe that if you are in the rapture that means you got the holy ghost because jesus said i am the resurrection and now my life and if that's in you you're already there there's no backing up amen it's the truth people i preach you the truth tonight the things what we need to do is stop listening we just remember i told you earlier it's your traditions it's what you've been taught it's deception if you don't see that this message has brought you a different word a different place in christ you're not in the organization you're not in denomination you're not in laodicea we're then where are you hallelujah amen you're in yes christ where is christ he's in you amen oh come on brother he said in that day you'll know i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you that day what day this day that is the revelation of the hour that christ is now living in the bride and he's now manifesting himself in the bride form that's the revelation hallelujah glory to god that's why our father prayer and i'm almost done tying this in but that's why our father prayer was so important but you know what we did we did just like matthew 28 19. go you therefore baptizing everyone in the name of the father son and holy ghost and we repeated that for hundreds of years since nia council thinking that was what god said tell him what he said he said it but that ain't what he meant that was not the revelation behind matthew 28 19. the revelation behind matthew 28 19 was acts 2 38. you thought well i'm gonna believe what the disciples what jesus said over the disciples that means you're just as blind as a bat you don't have no idea who god is and you don't have no idea who those disciples were when people say i ain't gonna believe paul paul was a woman hater i'm yes and you don't believe paul the bible said if you don't believe him you're lost amen paul said except for man preached the same doctrine i preached let him be a curse it don't matter what you believe because the point is it doesn't stop the program of god you're going to have the believers the make-believers and the unbelievers those three is going to always be all right i tell you what it's so amazing and listen like i said when he began to pray and he came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place listen where in the scripture in the book of genesis well where where where where adam and eve had to pray is it there why would they pray prayer is communion prayer is talking to god they always talk to him god always talk to him hallelujah the altar came after the fall now if god has restored everything back where do you think we're going all the time amen god want to be in you all the time not just here in the building or you know it's amazing because god don't want to be an extracurricular activity god wants you all of you your mind your body your soul your spirit everything is even so on my show he said if you're a dishwasher if god called you to be a dishwasher be holy that's right whatever he's called you to do you can be a garbage man whatever but god can still use you you say no i don't believe that and you just like i corrected uh i won't say i just said it in the right way don't never say what you don't believe just say you don't understand it because when you say i don't believe you cutting off your grace what if it's true the thing you say you don't believe what you say but that ain't that can't happen yeah those those pharisees was was taught a certain way and because of their teaching they were blind it wasn't that god blinded them but it was the pharisees it was the doctrines of divinity it was their tradition he said yo your traditions and all of these things they're the things that blind you well my mama was this my daddy was this and this is the way listen god requires more from you amen let's go to always god the bible will never leave himself without a witness he won't do it i'm almost done folks and it came to pass that as he was praying a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples and don't get me wrong i'm not trying to tell you to make your prayer a traditional prayer sometimes you might cry sometimes you might scream sometimes you may holler sometimes you might be quiet however you're being led by the holy spirit hello amen that's how you pray how god leads you to pray amen but don't pray like he's way off in heaven somewhere you're denying the scripture when you do that the bible even says he's not a far off he's 90 where even in your mouth and if he's in your mouth that means he's in your heart amen amen are you not the tabernacle the bible says know ye not that you are the temple of god you are the holy place and if there be any holy ground you are the holy ground because the holy ghost is on your ground or in your ground however you want to put it and he said to them when you pray say our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name and this is where people say well you might as well you rise well you could well there's a trinity now he said ah where the father is the creator jesus the body was created anybody know that the bible said i have prepared myself a body who is the body jesus that's what made him a son there's no such thing as eternal son because son has a beginning this part amen that we call son has a beginning but the part that we call father is in us that has no beginning that's eternal that's who oh my god people amen amen and when you pray say our father what was he saying i want you to understand you're praying to the creator hello that's why jesus didn't leave no idols that's right when you pray look at this and that's what they did even even israel made jerusalem an idol that's why they died that's why when titus came in in 80 70 they thought they thought for sure jerusalem was going to save them there was no power in that city jesus had already told him when he was on here he said listen i'm going to tear this down why they couldn't see it i don't know but let me say it like this that's why jesus was able to go into solomon temple and whip them out and guess what he said you din of thieves and robbers right he said he goes on his head don't you know listen my house shall be called the house of prayer he wasn't talking about solomon temple he was talking about his creation his house where he would abide his habitation will be called the house of prayer you say oh brother that has nothing to do with me yes brother branham said it like this when those foolish virgins came to ask the wise version give us of your all the wise versions say you go pray up that's what makes the difference the wise virgin has become the house of prayer praying without ceasing i never could understand that honestly for a long time pray without ceasing not understanding that your prayers should be on your heart well i don't ran out of things to pray when you have not you don't know what prayer is because there's too many things to pray for you'll never run out ever you're selfish that's when you pray and you don't ran out cause all you praying about is yourself god help this god help me there god do this for me and you want god to be your servant but he's jehovah jireh that's all we know him some of us that's all we know of him he will supply our knees what about his needs what about his need you think god doesn't have needs let me say it like as he did he does because jesus said i have need to go by samaria the converting of souls that's his needs and he puts us out here so that we can help what bring his needs to pass let me move on forgive us of our sins and i'm almost done because you see the blood is on the altar you say well what do you mean the prophet god said the bride of jesus christ is the blood of jesus christ by the spirit and so the holy ghost is here yes that's where you become a priest and this is where you become a king amen hallelujah a king rules and a priest omits sins or remit sins you know what i'm saying you say what do you mean this is what acts 2 38 is whatsoever you bound there to be bound whatsoever you remit it'll be remitted that's really a deep subject but you and i must understand that listen and i'm gonna close because there's no way i can finish this but let me say it like this when it comes to god i looked at the prophet of god and he constantly was saying i'm no prophet i'm no prophet and there are times he said you believe god's prophet but then people thought well he said it no that was god's spirit saying it through him and what we fail to see is that that's the way god we want to be so connected like that because many times brother branham had to go back home and listen to the tapes because he could remember what was being said or what had been said but we want to be that connected amen you say what do you mean even the bride of jesus christ lord when did we visit with the prison when did we give you clothing when did we feed you they were so connected to god they never thought about it amen but the moment you start thinking about it well if i do this i'm gonna get that that's your reward amen can i read one more scripture and i'm gonna have to close this acts 17 27-30 says that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find what him though it be not far from every one of us find him where is he in heaven where is he or where is god amen he's in you happily if you should find him for in him we live and move and have our beings as certain also of your own prophets have said for we are his offspring that's the word for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone or graven by the odds of man devices what is he saying stay away from idolatry don't form no kind of image of me you have become my image is that right divine nature right coming into the very image and likeness of god by his power by his strength he is the creator he's the one building the house and not we no no no no god in you the hope of glory the one beautiful thing and i love that god doesn't leave nothing incomplete nothing incomplete for as much then as we are the offspring of god will not see and that's what people say oh i'm wearing me a cross i got a picture of brother branham now i'm wearing me buckle belt a butt what's called a belka buckle on my belt that's nothing do y'all you know so y'all heard me say this before sometimes we put too much emphasis like a friend of mine and i'm going closer a friend of mine he bet this hindu and he began to witness to this hindu and his hindu at like okay you know because i guess the hindu wanted some money so he said the hindu was like okay uh uh uh you know he told me about you ever heard of william branham he said yeah yeah yeah yeah i heard we say y'all just like the hindus y'all worship eagles [Music] oh yeah i mentioned this down and i was saying and one of the brothers like he said because in front of the church he said they got this great [Laughter] once you see that everybody that's a call right listen you're gonna have all these pictures hanging up in the and people are coming like where's jesus in [Music] want to see this amen and how they're going to see him except they see him through you the atmosphere must speak jesus the worship must speak jesus everything that we do must be jesus isn't some image out there we are the temple of god they didn't understand jesus but they they had no idea that godhead was in him god had come down the earth indwelling a human man and jesus was not only the godhead but he was the mercy seat that's why he could he wasn't even dead yet but he was steady handing out mercy standing deadly handing out grace and only a few people caught it i don't know what the woman with the issue of blood had done but she said bro if i could just touch the human's garment i know i'll be made whole oh blind by the mayor's what would you want what are your needs you got to understand he was breaking every tradition you couldn't be healed in those days except you went to the priest and you had to bring your lamb and you had to bring your goat and you had to bring your dove but he was the true lamb of god breaking all traditions of the laws that's why they hated him how could this thing be amen they hated him so much they called him a devil and said you do these things by the by by the hand of bears above he said if i do these things by by the hand of a bears above then how are your priests bringing healing because they did there were those who really believe in their offerings and by those offerings they were healed god honored those laws was that bells above no it was god but they could not believe and that's what's wrong with folks now they cannot believe that god would come down and live in men amen and i'm not talking about jesus himself now i'm talking about you even even even among us we can believe that jesus died on the cross jesus rose again jesus was in william branham but we have a hard time believing that jesus is in us oh if the prophet was here then what tell me what could he do he couldn't do nothing he said if i could heal you i would but i have to wait on him amen amen what is that he's tried to tell us he had no power of his own the power which he had was from god people of god don't you see where your position enclosing like i said until you see when elijah leaves till you see that elijah is gone until you see that you will never be able to take your position because as long as you don't see that the mantle cannot drop on you that double portion will never fall on you until you catch the revelation of your day in your position in christ this is the day of the bride this is the day of elisha we're not taken away from elijah but elijah has already fulfilled his position we the bride of jesus christ must reflect jesus christ for our day hallelujah glory to god and once we see that god want to use us in a different way more powerful way we'll still be looking back like unclean frogs we'll be praying on our knees wishing that elijah could come and talk to you and discern your heart elijah ain't never discerned a heart it was jesus christ who did all that discerning but what what what did people do they made an idol out of him yes amen that's why they weren't getting nothing huh and until you recognize who jesus is brother adam said like this he said one day they're coming a day they're gonna call on the name of jesus and won't get nothing you know why the protocol you don't even know who he is right remember the woman says oh thou son of david thou son of david he said yeah he was the son of david to the jews but not her but then when she said lord and you see how people are calling on jesus like a denominational jesus you ain't getting nothing when you recognize that jesus christ that have come in this day and appeared to us to bring us to a change a change of our body this message has come to change you from glory to glory this y'all understand me this message is a message that will rapture you amen it's what god will come back for people who have lived it believed it engulfed it so much so it brings about a change people say well uh it's eager to come back physically i don't know how he's coming in that way he's come but how he however we see it we'll see him amen you understand what i'm saying every i that ain't the time every eye going to see him did y'all know that the rapture is not the time every eye is going to see i know what hollywood has done but if that be the case then when was it how can it be a secret when jesus raised from the dead his disciples stood there and saw his ascension did everybody see it so much so he was he was lifted up into a cloud y'all understand what i'm saying the same kind of cloud that came the same took him up in the same kind of cloud that brought him back amen and people don't want to don't want to acknowledge that but it is the truth of the matter is he didn't come the way you thought he was going to come and he's a thief he's stealing away the hearts of the people and they're changing amen they're changing and after a while what what am i wrong what is the invisible union of the bride what is it when will it happen when she will transform from bride to wife when you better understand it it's a revelation everybody don't get it because they say brother books you off the word well you can believe what you want to but i know he's changing me i've made a lot of mistakes i'm telling you even as a christian but i can tell you right now he's changing me and i trust by god's grace he's changing every one of us here tonight i know he's changing me and i know this thing is like it's getting better all the time you love the lord i i people of god i i use you're special i really appreciate every i appreciate everybody that comes out on wednesday there's a different anointing on wednesday and i really and i know god appreciate you and i know it ain't brother brooks that you come to see but i trust that what i preach that god will give you understanding or what i'm saying i i don't know about all of the doctrines i somebody said well what about this you say something about thunders and you said something i said i don't know nothing about that i ain't never been in a thunder camp i've never been to perugia camp i've never been in nobody's camp ever the only place i've ever been is christ amen i don't know what they're teaching and really don't care i don't think when paul was in the desert getting everything that that all the other disciples had i don't think he was worried about what they were getting and what they had god gave him the same thing that's how it works the book is open you cry out for more revelation cry out for god to give you understanding of the message because we've got to know this message is beyond pentecost let's stand i wanted to you to hear that
