[32:06] Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray Lord
[32:09] that tonight Lord that your message
[32:12] would get across and all of its purity
[32:14] father Lord not my words Lord but your
[32:18] words Lord not that I would speak of my
[32:20] own my own thoughts Lord just your
[32:24] thoughts and Lord that we know that this
[32:27] is possible father because you gave the
[32:29] promise wherever two or three are
[32:32] gathered in your name you'd be right
[32:34] there in the midst of them Lord and
[32:35] throughout the ages you have proved
[32:37] father that you were able to select
[32:39] Oracle's out of me Lord and you gave
[32:41] gifts unto men
[32:42] so we claim these gifts father as part
[32:45] of the ministry though we claim these
[32:48] gifts Lord that you for the perfecting
[32:51] of the Saints would speak to us tonight
[32:53] and nor those tonight as we can go home
[32:56] we can go home and say that surely Jesus
[32:58] Christ showed up tonight and we have
[33:00] been made closer into his image like him
[33:04] Lord we just thank you Father we you
[33:07] desire to give you the preeminence
[33:08] tonight father or that we might be made
[33:11] and your image and the name of the Lord
[33:14] Jesus Christ we turn the service in your
[33:16] hands and your name we pray amen amen
[33:22] let's just turn in our Bibles to
[33:25] colossians chapter 1
[33:30] amen will read from the fourteenth verse
[33:36] on down through the 18th and then we'll
[33:42] go over to John chapter 15 and Auctions
[33:47] 1:14 it says in whom we have the
[33:53] redemption through his blood even the
[33:56] forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[34:00] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[34:02] creature for by him we were all things
[34:06] created that are in heaven that are in
[34:09] the earth
[34:10] visible and invisible whether they be
[34:14] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[34:17] or powers all things were created by him
[34:21] and for him and he is before all things
[34:25] and by him all things consist
[34:28] and he is the head of the body the
[34:31] church who is the beginning and the
[34:34] firstborn from the dead that in all
[34:37] things he might have the preeminence
[34:41] amen and we want to give him the
[34:43] preeminence tonight
[34:45] Amen let's turn over to you and turn
[34:47] over to John chapter 15 I want to speak
[34:56] a message called the preeminence of
[34:57] Jesus Christ John 15 verse 6 jesus saith
[35:10] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[35:13] life no man cometh unto the father but
[35:16] by me if he had known me he should have
[35:20] known my father also and from henceforth
[35:22] you have known him he his forth you know
[35:25] him and have seen you know they didn't
[35:29] realize they had seen the father a
[35:32] malicious you can be seated
[35:35] we'll just go straight on into the
[35:36] message you know one thing that amazes
[35:45] me is Christians that will start upon
[35:52] the path that will claim the name of the
[35:55] Lord Jesus Christ and then somehow in
[35:59] their lives neglect to give Jesus Christ
[36:03] the preeminence amen
[36:06] now now Jesus Christ is the head of the
[36:11] body and for our body to not give
[36:16] preeminence unto the head that is a sick
[36:22] amen if a body does not give preeminence
[36:26] to the head that body is sick Amen if
[36:30] you if you're if you're suddenly your
[36:33] body ceased to give the preeminence to
[36:36] your own thinking to your own mind you
[36:38] had run to the doctor right away
[36:41] you know his brother branham he said
[36:43] that you know people enjoy alcohol and
[36:47] enjoy drinking that they will drink
[36:51] until their mind has completely thrown
[36:54] themselves - they don't even know what's
[36:57] going on they'll stumble around they'll
[37:00] trip and the fall they'll say things
[37:02] they shouldn't say they'll do things
[37:04] they shouldn't do and they are powerless
[37:07] to have control over their own body
[37:10] because of the influence of the alcohol
[37:12] it's in their system and brother ban
[37:15] says they'll go to the bar and they'll
[37:17] pay money to drink that and so that they
[37:21] can enter into that state but then if
[37:24] somehow they entered into that state
[37:26] without the influence of alcohol they
[37:29] would run to every doctor in the country
[37:31] trying to find out what's wrong with
[37:32] them now if they they'll they'll pay
[37:38] money to enter into that state so that
[37:41] their body is no longer giving
[37:43] preeminence to the head but their body
[37:45] is giving preeminence to the spirit of
[37:47] the alcohol but if somehow they were to
[37:50] slip into that state of mind without the
[37:53] influence of alcohol right away they
[37:56] would run to the doctor looking to find
[37:59] out what's wrong and Stan and it amazes
[38:03] me when I see Christians who have named
[38:05] the name of Christ amen who but who
[38:08] somehow are not giving the preeminence
[38:11] the they claim be a part of the body of
[38:14] Christ but they are not giving
[38:15] preeminence to the head which is Christ
[38:18] amen and now the body of Christ is ran
[38:22] by a spirit amen
[38:24] there is a spirit within this body it's
[38:26] not a dead body it's a live living body
[38:29] amen and there is a spirit that gives
[38:31] that body life and that body must give
[38:35] priam
[38:35] under that spirit because the head
[38:38] because from the head gives control
[38:40] through throughout the whole body
[38:42] through that spirit the spirit is life
[38:44] if the life leaves the body it doesn't
[38:47] matter whether the head is still
[38:48] attached or not amen if the life leaves
[38:51] the body then the body cannot listen to
[38:53] the head amen but there is a life that
[38:56] flows through that body and that life is
[38:58] there because of the Spirit amen
[39:01] and so is the body of Christ connected
[39:05] to the head must have the spirit the
[39:08] life of the body which is the life of
[39:11] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost amen and by
[39:14] giving preeminence amen and and by be
[39:18] giving preeminence to the Lord Jesus
[39:20] Christ
[39:21] it seals it creates a sealing amen so
[39:25] that you cannot listen to any other
[39:28] spirit amen when you give the
[39:30] preeminence to that body all other
[39:33] spirits are sealed away from you and you
[39:36] cannot give the preeminence to the other
[39:38] spirits you give the previs to the one
[39:41] which is the head Christ amen and when
[39:44] that happens then all of a sudden what
[39:46] happens to your actions your actions are
[39:51] whatever the head says for you to do
[39:53] which the head is Christ because you
[39:57] gave him the preeminence therefore now
[39:59] the Holy Spirit can tell you what to do
[40:01] and also and also also in your actions
[40:04] our actions our Holy Ghost actions your
[40:09] thoughts our Holy Ghost thoughts amen
[40:12] your your your your emotions are now
[40:20] Holy Ghost emotions controlled by the
[40:23] control tower of the Holy Ghost but when
[40:26] you see a somewhat who names the name of
[40:29] Christ and their emotions are dragging
[40:32] them off over here and dragging them off
[40:34] over there and there are no longer
[40:36] giving preeminence to the head which is
[40:38] Christ but they're giving preeminence to
[40:40] some other spirit that has dragging them
[40:43] off to the other side there's something
[40:45] wrong they are not giving preeminence to
[40:48] the body
[40:49] amen now he is the image of the
[40:53] invisible God he is the firstborn of
[40:55] every creature for by him we're all
[40:57] things created that are in heaven or
[40:59] visible and invisible whether they be
[41:01] Thrones dominions principalities or
[41:03] powers all things were created by him
[41:06] and for him you know one thing you know
[41:11] is you know my viewpoint I grew up in a
[41:13] Pentecostal churches and one thing about
[41:17] growing up in Pentecostal churches and
[41:19] seeing all the phenomenon I I grew up
[41:22] with people seeing demons and and
[41:25] telling dreams and miracles happening
[41:28] and and all those things I grew up
[41:31] seeing all the phenomenon the speaking
[41:33] in tongues interpretations I saw all of
[41:35] that but yet when I ever I heard about
[41:39] the Holy Ghost it was always this object
[41:45] that gave you power to do this
[41:49] phenomenon if you wanted to get ahead in
[41:53] your Christian life you might seek after
[41:55] this Holy Ghost so that it would give
[41:58] you the power to do this certain
[42:00] phenomena or do this nifty thing over
[42:02] here or the safety thing over there but
[42:04] the thing of it is is that Holy Ghost is
[42:07] not just a power it's not just speaking
[42:11] in tongues it's not you know you can't
[42:14] just say that's the evidence it's not
[42:16] just this little neat thing over here or
[42:18] this little thing we we do over here
[42:20] over there but it is Jesus Christ
[42:22] himself the one that we are giving the
[42:24] preeminence to amen he is the the one
[42:28] that created the world by his own word
[42:30] amen he is the one that is before all
[42:32] things he is the one we worship it's not
[42:35] a third person a man it's not the lesser
[42:37] of the Trinity it's not the one that no
[42:40] one ever thinks about in the Trinity
[42:41] where they give all the premiums to the
[42:42] Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost is
[42:45] this little spirit off over here but he
[42:47] is Christ himself the word and he is the
[42:53] one that is the that is giving the power
[42:56] to the body the life to the body to do
[42:59] the things that the head was done
[43:02] and when you give the preeminence to
[43:05] Jesus Christ you are creating that link
[43:08] between the head and the body so that
[43:11] the head can have can have that can do
[43:15] exactly what the head wants done the
[43:18] body is acting upon what the control
[43:22] tower says to do because it is linked
[43:25] the body and the head are now linked so
[43:28] tightly so closely that as soon as the
[43:31] head says arm go out it goes out amen
[43:35] leg kick up it kicks up you know feet
[43:38] move why go do think act talk live love
[43:42] amen because you are linked you have
[43:46] given preeminence to the head amen and
[43:49] the head has answered and the body has
[43:52] been filled with the Holy Ghost and you
[43:55] are alive and well in him we live and
[43:57] move and have our being why because we
[44:00] gave Christ the preeminence but it is
[44:05] possible that the body could fail to
[44:08] give the head the preeminence is it
[44:13] possible it is possible Amen it is
[44:17] possible for the body of the Lord Jesus
[44:19] Christ to cool off to fall asleep to
[44:26] slumber amen and now a sudden even
[44:30] though the head is still talking is
[44:32] still trying to act but now the the body
[44:35] has gotten sluggish and to where the
[44:39] head says go do this and you're like oh
[44:41] is that and you're in this dream world
[44:44] and you're no longer acting upon what
[44:46] the word is saying because the word is
[44:49] still speaking he that thoughts are
[44:51] still there that the thoughts are still
[44:53] speaking but just can't get the body to
[44:56] act why because your as some others
[44:58] slumber yours you're not awake you're
[45:02] not giving preeminence the body is now
[45:05] tired it's asleep it's slumbering
[45:07] because it's not giving preeminence to
[45:09] the head amen
[45:14] that is not the position that the body
[45:17] is to be in amen there was a time where
[45:20] a cry went out at the time of the
[45:23] wedding and wake yourself wake up go ye
[45:27] out to meet him the bridegroom cometh
[45:30] the time has arrived go out and the cry
[45:33] went out go out to meet him and they all
[45:36] woke up and they began to trim their
[45:37] lamps and five of them found out that
[45:39] they were connected to the head and they
[45:42] could take instructions from the control
[45:45] tower and five of them found out that
[45:47] they had no connection to the control
[45:51] tower they were not connected to the
[45:53] head the head was speaking but though
[45:56] the foolish virgins couldn't couldn't
[45:59] get the instructions to act out in their
[46:01] body because there was no link there was
[46:04] no power there was no life a man there
[46:07] was no fire in their vessel
[46:08] amen amen
[46:13] that in all things he might have the
[46:15] preeminence for it pleased the father
[46:18] that in him should all the fullness
[46:20] dwell in who Christ Christ is the
[46:26] Anointed One he was anointed he was the
[46:30] reason that there was an ark of the
[46:32] covenant he is the reason there was a
[46:35] Horn of oil
[46:37] he is the reason there was a Sabbath he
[46:40] is the reason there was a rock in the
[46:42] wilderness he is the reason there was
[46:44] manna coming down from heaven amen he
[46:47] was the reason for all of that be yet
[46:50] late when they they followed all of
[46:52] those little things but yet when he came
[46:54] they didn't recognize him the very head
[46:57] came to the body but the body said we
[46:59] reject him amen
[47:04] what a shame amen let's turn over to
[47:09] theya chapter 28 giving christ the
[47:15] preeminence he deserves a previous test
[47:18] has now he'd done all things well
[47:32] Isaiah 28 verse 7 I think about the body
[47:47] should be in direct control from the
[47:53] head the body should be now the body of
[47:57] Christ what will be preached last
[47:59] Wednesday we preach on the body of
[48:01] Christ we are the body of Christ we call
[48:03] ourselves so if I ask you brother are
[48:05] you part of the body of Christ and say
[48:06] yes amen I am a part of the body of
[48:08] Christ then the head should have the
[48:11] preeminence for it to sin down it's
[48:16] instructions and you would act upon
[48:18] whatever those instructions are amen now
[48:20] we also talked about what drunkenness
[48:23] drunkenness causes the body to not do
[48:28] act upon the spirit of the body but to
[48:32] act upon some other spirit amen
[48:36] verse 7 but they also have erred through
[48:41] wine and through strong drink are out of
[48:44] the way the priest and the prophet have
[48:47] erred through strong drink
[48:49] they are swallowed up of wine they are
[48:52] out of the way through strong drink they
[48:54] err in vision and they stumble in
[48:56] judgment for all the tables are full of
[48:59] vomit and filthiness so if there is no
[49:01] place clean whom shall he teach
[49:04] knowledge and whom shall he make to
[49:06] understand doctrine to them that are
[49:09] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[49:10] breasts watch verse tenure for precept
[49:15] must be upon precept precept upon
[49:20] precept line upon line line upon line
[49:24] here a little and there a little what's
[49:27] he doing he's building something amen
[49:29] what precept upon precept Commandment
[49:32] upon commandment word upon word he is
[49:35] building a building he is building a
[49:38] house amen he is building a pyramid he
[49:41] is building a temple amen a place where
[49:44] the calf stones in
[49:45] come down amen but in order for the
[49:47] capstone to come down there first must
[49:49] be a cornerstone a man soy's he do he
[49:52] starts building word upon word he sends
[49:54] down the cornerstone which is Jesus
[49:56] Christ amen
[49:59] and everything he is the word and
[50:02] everything must be in line from that one
[50:06] cornerstone and the walls go out from
[50:08] the cornerstone lying upon line here a
[50:11] little there a little amen
[50:13] and it's what those lines what are those
[50:15] lines have you ever seen how they build
[50:16] a building they set the corners first
[50:19] when you're building a foundation you
[50:22] set the corners first amen and you what
[50:25] before you can build the corners first
[50:26] you have to set out the lines amen
[50:29] so then what do you do you build the
[50:31] lines you dig the hole and then you get
[50:33] a plumb bob and you and you go and you
[50:35] make sure that the the bottom of the
[50:37] wall is going to be right with it from
[50:39] the top you have to bring the thought
[50:42] from up above and translate the higher
[50:45] thought using the plumb line all the way
[50:47] down to the bottom amen so what so that
[50:51] the corners will be straight they'll be
[50:53] square this way they'll be squared this
[50:55] way and then we square this way a mint
[50:58] line upon line line upon line here a
[51:01] little and there low it's all correct
[51:03] with the cornerstone he says
[51:05] for with stammering lips and another
[51:07] tongue will he speak to this people then
[51:15] he says to whom he sayeth well he's
[51:19] speaking to a people what's he doing
[51:20] he's trying to get a people to be in
[51:23] line with what the Spirit is saying amen
[51:27] who so he went to whom he sayeth this is
[51:30] the rest wherewith he may cause the
[51:33] weary to rest and this is their
[51:35] refreshing yet they would not hear now
[51:38] we're going to keep going on later down
[51:40] here in a little bit but think about it
[51:41] what'd he do he created the world in six
[51:44] days the seventh day he rested from all
[51:48] of his works then he told the people
[51:51] honor the seventh day and rest and that
[51:55] will be that is the Sabbath rest and
[51:58] then wait til I'm going to
[51:59] you're gonna enter into the promised
[52:00] land that is the rest where you cease
[52:03] from your own works amen amen
[52:06] and what would they do it to Hebrews he
[52:08] says but they entered in because not
[52:10] because of unbelief all those years they
[52:14] observe the Sabbath they observe the
[52:16] Sabbath they are so faithful throughout
[52:18] the desert to observe the Sabbath but
[52:20] when they got up to the true Sabbath
[52:22] they could not enter in because of
[52:24] unbelief word upon word Sabbath upon
[52:29] Sabbath Sabbath upon Sabbath obedience
[52:31] upon obedience but they came to up to
[52:33] the final line their attire foundation
[52:36] was built upon the wrong foundation so
[52:41] so even though they had the form they
[52:43] were building a building they had some
[52:46] corners they had some obedience but the
[52:50] foundation wasn't there
[52:52] there was no cornerstone so everything
[52:55] they built upon all those Sabbath
[52:57] rearing all that when they got up to the
[52:59] River Jordan no we can't do that they
[53:05] could not enter in because they didn't
[53:08] give the head of the preeminence now
[53:11] they would give previous to the form and
[53:13] the function they gave preeminence to
[53:16] obeying the Sabbath they gave
[53:18] preeminence to you know speaking in
[53:20] tongues so doing this or doing whatever
[53:22] they gave previous to all these things
[53:24] that came to church we can't wake out
[53:26] but they didn't give preeminence to the
[53:28] head which is Christ says but the word
[53:38] of the Lord were searching was unto them
[53:40] precept upon precept precept upon
[53:42] precept line upon line line upon here a
[53:45] little and there though that they might
[53:47] go and fall backwards and be broken and
[53:50] snared and taken God didn't stop
[53:52] building but because they had no
[53:55] foundation amen
[54:01] verse 16
[54:06] let's uh think you know and Luke it says
[54:17] in Luke remember Jesus gave the parable
[54:20] he said talking about the man that
[54:22] builded a house a man he said that there
[54:27] was a man who built his house he what'd
[54:31] he do he hurt the boy he is given a
[54:33] parable about those that heard Jesus's
[54:35] Saints and he compared to men those that
[54:39] heard Jesus the sayings and did them and
[54:41] those who heard Jesus sayings and
[54:43] wouldn't do them they both heard one was
[54:47] a doer and one was not amen
[54:49] so and he gives up parable the one that
[54:52] heard and did is the one that was like a
[54:54] man which built a house he dig down deep
[54:58] and he laid the foundation upon a rock
[55:03] amen and he built up his house and when
[55:08] the flood arose the stream beat
[55:10] vehemently upon the house and could not
[55:12] shake it because it was founded upon a
[55:15] rock
[55:15] they gave preeminence to the rock but
[55:19] the other man the he that heard and did
[55:21] not was like a man that didn't dig down
[55:24] to the rock but just started building
[55:26] this house right away right away he
[55:28] started coming to church they meant
[55:31] started observing all the observances
[55:33] spada's ties his offerings and all those
[55:36] things a man came to church day-in
[55:39] day-out but he didn't give preeminence
[55:41] to the foundation which is Jesus Christ
[55:46] amen now remember this building has a
[55:48] cornerstone the capstone is going to
[55:51] come down to it but if your building
[55:53] doesn't have this cornerstone the
[55:55] capstone ain't coming to that type of a
[55:57] building it's coming to one building the
[56:00] one that gives the premise to the head
[56:02] amen
[56:16] let's go back to Isaiah 28 in verse 14
[56:22] it says wherefore hear the word of the
[56:25] Lord ye scornful men that ruled this
[56:27] people which is in Jerusalem because he
[56:31] have said we have made a covenant with
[56:34] death and with hell are we at agreement
[56:37] what were they doing
[56:40] they believed that they could do a
[56:46] little bit of sin they had a covenant
[56:51] that sin could only come so far I
[56:53] wouldn't overtake them they talked to
[56:57] the devil and told the devil you just
[56:58] stare right there a mint they may have
[57:02] an agreement with hell the hell can come
[57:04] into my life right here but stop right
[57:06] there they made an agreement with death
[57:10] I can accept a little pinch of death in
[57:12] my life by not giving premisis of the
[57:13] word here of all gift freeman's to the
[57:15] world over there and they had these
[57:18] agreements with the devil because he if
[57:29] we made a covenant with death and with
[57:32] hell we are at agreement when the
[57:35] overflowing scourge shall pass through
[57:37] it won't come unto us for we have made
[57:41] lies our refuge and under falsehood we
[57:44] have hid ourselves they set in the
[57:52] church he's talking about the people in
[57:55] Jerusalem verse 14 says wherefore hear
[57:58] the word of Lord East scornful me and
[57:59] what are they doing there scouring the
[58:01] word that rule this people which is in
[58:03] Jerusalem they had made a covenant they
[58:06] were there seeking they were seeking
[58:08] refuge under the lies while proclaiming
[58:10] to be the bride of Jehovah amen and now
[58:14] we claim to be the Bride of Christ amen
[58:17] how they built their entire Christian
[58:20] walk up upon a lie because they would
[58:23] not get preeminence under Christ the
[58:25] head so they said that when the
[58:28] overflowing scourge shall come through
[58:30] and won't hit us now you can live a long
[58:34] time with your agreements with death and
[58:38] hell right those will stand for Oh quite
[58:44] awhile and people will stand with one
[58:47] foot in the world and one foot in the
[58:49] church for a long long long long time
[58:51] but one of these days that flood is
[58:54] gonna come you know that prayer but we
[58:56] were I just read you it from Luke 6 he
[58:59] is like the man the man that heard the
[59:01] word but didn't do the word was like a
[59:05] man that built his house without a
[59:08] foundation now the house did get
[59:10] finished
[59:12] they got finished he built his house
[59:15] without a foundation it was built upon
[59:17] the sand he got it all up he put the
[59:19] shingles on put it in the windows put
[59:21] the door lock the door and everything is
[59:23] good and well but when this when the
[59:25] floods arose shook the whole house down
[59:29] and great was the ruin of the house Amen
[59:33] why he had made it he was taking shelter
[59:35] underneath lies that he didn't need the
[59:38] solid rock which was Christ the word we
[59:42] have to
[59:43] preeminence to the head we have to give
[59:45] preeminence to Christ the word amen we
[59:49] can we can we can do all kinds of
[59:51] religious things we can we can listen to
[59:54] the messages we can talk the talk we can
[59:57] do all those things but if we don't get
[59:59] preeminence to Christ the word you are
[1:00:03] taking refuge in a pile of lies and when
[1:00:06] the stream the stream with the river
[1:00:08] will flow the flood will come amen it
[1:00:12] will beat upon your house amen and if
[1:00:14] he'll find out what your house was built
[1:00:17] upon and whether you gave preeminence to
[1:00:21] the word which is Christ or not amen
[1:00:27] amen God gave them a Sabbath day and
[1:00:33] they followed it he gave them manna and
[1:00:36] they ate it he gave them a rock in the
[1:00:40] wilderness and they drank from the water
[1:00:42] amen he gives us the Holy Ghost we sit
[1:00:46] here we worship in the services we we
[1:00:48] enjoy the feeling of his presence we we
[1:00:52] drink from the we say oh my that was a
[1:00:54] great sermon and all those religious
[1:00:56] fine religious things well given the
[1:00:58] offering and all that but now you know
[1:01:00] we eat the manna from heaven but but one
[1:01:03] of these days will come up to a point
[1:01:05] where we'll find out if we've been given
[1:01:07] preeminence to Christ the head or if we
[1:01:10] become drunken and given preeminence to
[1:01:15] some other spirit
[1:01:16] besides the Holy Spirit amen and that
[1:01:19] becomes when we don't give preeminence
[1:01:21] to the word which is Christ amen Christ
[1:01:27] is the word he that heareth and doeth
[1:01:32] not is like a man that without a
[1:01:34] foundation build a house though this
[1:01:38] house with no foundation
[1:01:45] let's turn over to Colossians chapter 2
[1:01:47] you can get away with with with not
[1:01:59] following the word for so long that it
[1:02:01] will fool you and you will be fooled by
[1:02:06] being foolish you will become fooled
[1:02:09] into thinking that you are okay
[1:02:11] amen amen people will get lulled into a
[1:02:15] false sense of security by standing on
[1:02:18] something other than the word their own
[1:02:21] thought that they came up with that
[1:02:22] something that Satan gave them a little
[1:02:25] thought I can get off the word over here
[1:02:27] and I'll be okay away from the word and
[1:02:30] I can stand and then they come to church
[1:02:32] the next Sunday and why God didn't seem
[1:02:36] to notice at all I seem to have gotten
[1:02:37] away with it and you stand week after
[1:02:40] week after week and you you know boy I I
[1:02:44] see Mike I can get away from this word
[1:02:47] pretty far and I'm doing okay I can
[1:02:50] still worship I can still pray I can
[1:02:52] still do this like I still preach I
[1:02:54] guess so do all these things and yet I'm
[1:02:56] so far off the word now I'm no longer
[1:03:00] given the word the Prima it's because I
[1:03:02] think I'm okay I've made what have you
[1:03:03] done you've made an agreement with hell
[1:03:07] because you can say I can be this far
[1:03:10] from the word and still keep hell at bay
[1:03:14] hell you just stop right there I'm going
[1:03:16] to get close to you but I don't want you
[1:03:18] to take over my life now right I don't
[1:03:22] want I don't want the devil to take over
[1:03:23] my life I don't want the devil to to
[1:03:26] overflow me but I don't want necessarily
[1:03:28] the word to have the preeminence so I'm
[1:03:29] gonna stand right here between the two
[1:03:31] and I made an agreement with hell I made
[1:03:33] a creamy with death that the you will
[1:03:36] stop right there and you're looking at
[1:03:38] my you stopped right there I got away
[1:03:41] with it and how long someone can get
[1:03:44] away with being off of the word and
[1:03:47] their their agreement with hell seems to
[1:03:51] stand and so there they stand boldly
[1:03:54] between the two thinking that they got
[1:03:56] away with it
[1:03:59] amen clashes to verse six as he
[1:04:07] therefore received Jesus Christian as he
[1:04:10] have therefore received Christ Jesus the
[1:04:13] Lord so walky in him rooted and built up
[1:04:19] in him established in the faith as he
[1:04:21] have been taught they had they have to
[1:04:26] listen you have to listen to the
[1:04:27] preacher now don't you amen
[1:04:30] as he have been taught abounding therein
[1:04:32] in with Thanksgiving
[1:04:35] abounding your your alive in the church
[1:04:38] giving Thanksgiving staying upon the
[1:04:41] word that you have heard amen
[1:04:44] verse eight beware watch out be careful
[1:04:50] beware lest any man spoil you
[1:04:54] now how does how can you be spoiled you
[1:04:59] know the word spoil there can be a
[1:05:00] couple things either one you turn rotten
[1:05:03] or the army of enemy comes in and Rob's
[1:05:10] away the things that are most valuable
[1:05:12] in your life amen
[1:05:14] always spirit the most valuable thing we
[1:05:17] have is the sealing of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:18] amen and the evidence of Christ walking
[1:05:22] and living moving in our lives amen but
[1:05:25] he that the thief comes to steal kill
[1:05:28] and destroy and robbed that experience
[1:05:31] out of your life and beware lest any man
[1:05:33] spoil you through philosophy what is
[1:05:38] philosophy just another way of thinking
[1:05:40] some type of thinking is not upon the
[1:05:43] word amen and vain deceit they meant
[1:05:48] what you've deceived yourself and your
[1:05:50] own vanity that's when you get all the
[1:05:53] way over here and you're far off from
[1:05:55] the word and in your vanity you think
[1:05:58] that your barrier with hell is gonna
[1:06:00] hold up
[1:06:01] you don't realize that's just a paper
[1:06:04] wall and Satan could come right through
[1:06:05] that any time he wants to and because
[1:06:07] and you think that you can get back to
[1:06:10] the word
[1:06:12] anytime he comes through you don't
[1:06:14] realize you've been separated from the
[1:06:15] Word of God and people will stand there
[1:06:18] and think that they can get back to the
[1:06:20] Word of God anytime they want to amen
[1:06:24] jesus said be careful because the thing
[1:06:27] that you seemeth to have you might find
[1:06:29] out that it doesn't actually belong to
[1:06:31] you
[1:06:32] amen beware lest any man spoil you
[1:06:36] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[1:06:38] the tradition of men oh it's ok to do
[1:06:41] that after the rudiments of the world
[1:06:43] and not after Christ for in him dwelleth
[1:06:47] all the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:06:49] and ye are complete in him amen in him
[1:06:56] dwells the fullness of the God we gotta
[1:06:58] give him the preeminence we gotta do it
[1:07:00] every day we gotta give him the rule of
[1:07:03] our life if we don't you'll be like
[1:07:07] those and Isaiah chapter 28 making an
[1:07:10] agreement with hell that I can be this
[1:07:12] far from the word and he'll won't touch
[1:07:14] me that's a dangerous place to be
[1:07:19] amen let's turn over to Hebrews chapter
[1:07:24] 3
[1:07:41] Hebrews three verse 18 talking about
[1:07:50] those in the wilderness he says and to
[1:07:53] whom swear he that they should not
[1:07:55] intern it at his rest but them that
[1:07:58] believe not what do you do
[1:08:00] he swore they will never enter into my
[1:08:02] rest they started they left Egypt they
[1:08:05] followed Moses they listen to what the
[1:08:08] prophets said they did all that the
[1:08:10] Prophet told them they rejoice in church
[1:08:12] they they they they believed in the
[1:08:15] Sabbath they followed all those things
[1:08:17] by Jeep but God Himself was swearing by
[1:08:20] himself
[1:08:20] they will never receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:23] they will never enter into my rest why
[1:08:26] because they just would not believe
[1:08:28] they didn't build their house upon the
[1:08:31] foundation amen so we see that they
[1:08:37] could not enter in because of unbelief
[1:08:38] let's go to verse 1 of chapter 2 the
[1:08:41] next chapter let us therefore fear lest
[1:08:44] a promise being left of us
[1:08:47] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:08:49] seem to come short of it so there is a
[1:08:57] promise of entering into his rest amen
[1:09:01] no God created the world in six days the
[1:09:04] seventh day he rested from all his works
[1:09:06] amen he gave them the Sabbath as a type
[1:09:09] of that saying there's a chance an
[1:09:11] opportunity of you entering into your
[1:09:14] rest also amen and they are obedient to
[1:09:17] the type but they didn't come to the
[1:09:18] fulfillment now we have a type we have
[1:09:22] the fulfillment which is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:24] where you cease from your works and your
[1:09:28] own ideas your own thinking your own
[1:09:30] actions
[1:09:31] amen your own drunkenness your own
[1:09:34] foolishness and you receive the baptism
[1:09:36] of the Holy Ghost and now your what you
[1:09:40] have you are a new creation you are a
[1:09:43] brand-new man
[1:09:44] you are no longer living your own life
[1:09:47] but you have a life of Christ is now
[1:09:50] living in you and you've been
[1:09:52] transformed into the image of the Lord
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:57] and now you are the body of the Christ
[1:10:00] upon the earth amen you know every
[1:10:11] farmer when he plants his field was he
[1:10:13] do he Labor's he Labor's he Labor's and
[1:10:16] everything that he does after the winter
[1:10:18] is over as soon as the ground starts
[1:10:21] thawing he starts working he's got a
[1:10:23] he's got a plow up his feet he's got to
[1:10:25] put in all the nutrients he he does all
[1:10:28] those things he prays for rain and and
[1:10:31] he then he prays that the field won't be
[1:10:33] too wet and he he struggles he looks he
[1:10:36] watches he waits he it finally he gets
[1:10:38] the seed into the ground and what does
[1:10:40] he do he rests because he knows that the
[1:10:44] the power of the seed that he put into
[1:10:47] the ground will bring forth the crop
[1:10:50] that he is looking for and then he can
[1:10:53] rest and was he do he ceases from his
[1:10:56] own works now what happens if he decides
[1:11:02] to rest going through all that labor to
[1:11:05] prepare the ground and then rest before
[1:11:07] the seed actually gets in the ground and
[1:11:09] man won't have a crop they'll have a lot
[1:11:13] of weeds they won't have a crop amen you
[1:11:16] got a you got a cease from your own
[1:11:18] works once the seed is in the ground so
[1:11:21] once that word enters into your heart
[1:11:23] and you realize you believe on it it's
[1:11:26] yours you accept you say Lord I believe
[1:11:28] your word Lord I have got you latch on
[1:11:32] to that then you know you're gonna get a
[1:11:34] crop a mint why they entered in not
[1:11:37] because they didn't believe Amen but for
[1:11:42] the man that receives the word believes
[1:11:44] it and then that man is gonna get a crop
[1:11:47] amen and why do people fall away was it
[1:11:54] in here to enter into his rest they
[1:11:58] didn't do it they didn't rest upon Jesus
[1:12:02] Christ so what is it troubles came
[1:12:05] something came and instead of giving
[1:12:08] their troubles over to Jesus Christ they
[1:12:13] fall away because they lost their
[1:12:15] foundation amen they made an agreement
[1:12:19] with hell and the flood came and
[1:12:20] destroyed their entire house
[1:12:24] amen what happens because people will
[1:12:27] leave the word the word didn't change
[1:12:29] but they left the word and Satan just he
[1:12:34] slow walks you off the word you knew you
[1:12:36] were doing wrong you knew you were doing
[1:12:39] wrong but you allowed yourself be slow
[1:12:41] walked off the word and they'll sudden
[1:12:43] the flood comes and you want to run back
[1:12:45] to the word but you're so far from it
[1:12:47] and you had the agreement with hell and
[1:12:50] it passed over you let's go back to
[1:12:52] Isaiah 20 I want to read that again now
[1:12:54] that we've drawn the picture let's read
[1:12:55] that one more time
[1:13:10] after they fell what verse 7 they fell
[1:13:13] through their drinking they drank the
[1:13:15] strong drink they started being obedient
[1:13:17] to a spirit other than the Holy Spirit
[1:13:20] amen so they weren't given Christ the
[1:13:23] head the preeminence so the another
[1:13:25] spirit entered in and they gave the
[1:13:27] preeminence to that other spirit so but
[1:13:31] the whole time God is giving out his
[1:13:34] message every Sunday
[1:13:36] his message every Wednesday his message
[1:13:40] on the tapes amen
[1:13:41] God still giving out he's getting out
[1:13:43] what's he doing precept upon precept God
[1:13:45] is building a house
[1:13:47] amen but they couldn't enjoy this house
[1:13:50] because they were taken out of the way
[1:13:52] verse 10 for precept must be upon
[1:13:56] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:13:59] line line upon line here a little and
[1:14:01] there little a mint for with the
[1:14:04] stammering lips and another tongue will
[1:14:05] he speak to this people amen us talking
[1:14:08] about the Spirit of God speaking to the
[1:14:10] church amen people will say Austin
[1:14:13] speaking in tongues and they don't
[1:14:14] realize what speaking in tongues is they
[1:14:16] don't realize what it means for the Holy
[1:14:18] Spirit to speak to the church amen it's
[1:14:22] not just some nifty thing for us a gate
[1:14:24] banghak get going hear what the Spirit
[1:14:26] is saying to the churches he meant the
[1:14:29] Spirit is talking to the churches isn't
[1:14:31] he
[1:14:31] amen to whom he sayeth wait for with
[1:14:37] stammering lips and no tongue he'll
[1:14:39] speak to this people what people the
[1:14:41] people are drunken they're listening to
[1:14:44] some of their spirit to whom he sayeth
[1:14:46] this is the rest wherewith he caused the
[1:14:48] weary arrest and this is the refreshing
[1:14:51] yet they would not hear he's standing
[1:14:54] there he's Christ is standing there
[1:14:56] holding his word saying this is the line
[1:14:58] this is the precept this is the spirit
[1:15:01] that makes this happen this is the Holy
[1:15:03] Ghost stay right with us stay right in
[1:15:06] it stay with what you've been taught
[1:15:07] stay with what you're hearing stay with
[1:15:10] what's been preached you stay with the
[1:15:11] gospel stay with what the pastor's
[1:15:14] saying but yet they would not hear this
[1:15:17] is the refreshing be it they would not
[1:15:18] hear but the word of the Lord was still
[1:15:21] unto them verse sir
[1:15:22] precip was still upon the precept
[1:15:25] precept upon precept the line was soap
[1:15:27] on the line the line is helpline God he
[1:15:29] gave to him here a little there a little
[1:15:31] that they might go and what they do they
[1:15:33] fell backwards they were broken
[1:15:36] they were snared and they were taken why
[1:15:38] because Christ the word was here but
[1:15:41] they were off over there amen
[1:15:44] verse 14 where for here the word of the
[1:15:47] Lord he's scornful meant their rule as
[1:15:50] people which is in Jerusalem washe was
[1:15:52] read verse 15 again because here is the
[1:15:56] cause of all this the cause that they
[1:16:00] fell back the cause they were broken
[1:16:03] even though God was building his house
[1:16:05] lying upon line they still fell back
[1:16:08] they're still broken why because they
[1:16:11] had made a covenant with death and with
[1:16:13] hell they were an agreement and when the
[1:16:17] overflowing scourge shall pass through
[1:16:18] it shall not come unto us for we have
[1:16:21] made lies our refuge and under falsehood
[1:16:25] we have hid ourselves verse 16 the
[1:16:29] entire time God has laid in Zion a
[1:16:31] foundation a stone a tried stone a
[1:16:34] precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[1:16:38] and he that believeth shall not make
[1:16:40] haste amen amen you rest upon that rock
[1:16:46] now even the gates of Hell come against
[1:16:49] you amen though the stream beats upon
[1:16:52] that house Amen though it shakes it will
[1:16:55] never fall down why because that man has
[1:16:58] built his house upon a rock
[1:16:59] he gave Christ the word the preeminence
[1:17:03] amen and it came here a little and there
[1:17:06] a little Sunday after Sunday Wednesday
[1:17:09] after Wednesday every time I read my
[1:17:11] Bible every time I prayed in the morning
[1:17:14] every time I opened it up and Cape kept
[1:17:16] giving it he's building the house here a
[1:17:18] little there a little here a little
[1:17:19] little but that because that man has his
[1:17:22] found his house is being built upon a
[1:17:25] foundation now you can still come to
[1:17:27] Sunday every Sunday and every Wednesday
[1:17:29] you hear the same message but if you're
[1:17:31] not standing upon the foundation which
[1:17:34] is Jesus Christ the
[1:17:35] flood will come and you will be sucked
[1:17:37] away you are making your house built
[1:17:40] sheltered around with lies and it cannot
[1:17:43] stand amen amen
[1:17:49] upon Christ the solid rock I stand amen
[1:17:54] all other ground is sinking sand
[1:17:58] amen and Christ has to have the
[1:18:01] preeminence in her life yes I had the
[1:18:04] preeminence over every habit over every
[1:18:06] habit he has to have the preeminence
[1:18:09] over every temptation Amen yes to have
[1:18:14] the preeminence over every shortcoming
[1:18:17] every weakness in our lives
[1:18:19] Christ has to have the preeminence Amen
[1:18:22] we have to give it to him amen why
[1:18:26] because Christ is still the mediator who
[1:18:29] has been may he is standing there to
[1:18:32] mediate between two which is us and the
[1:18:35] perfect word between us and the judgment
[1:18:39] of God between us and God's righteous
[1:18:42] judgment God has a righteous judgment
[1:18:45] amen amen and that righteous judgment is
[1:18:48] true amen
[1:18:49] now remember you know God talks about
[1:18:52] the plummet line throughout the Bible if
[1:18:54] you ever heard him talk about the
[1:18:55] plummet line though the plumb bob you
[1:18:57] know you when you're building a house
[1:18:59] and you or you you or you want to take
[1:19:03] something a point that is way up here
[1:19:05] and you want to build something didn't
[1:19:10] you want to start here upon the
[1:19:11] foundation and as you build it up you
[1:19:14] want make sure it meets this point it
[1:19:17] doesn't meet over here it doesn't meet
[1:19:19] over there I mean doesn't meet over
[1:19:20] there but because so what you do take a
[1:19:22] string you tie a heavyweight on the
[1:19:25] string and you put it right at the point
[1:19:27] right there and you wait till stops
[1:19:29] moving and then you make your mark upon
[1:19:31] the dirt you have transferred the line
[1:19:34] from the higher place down to the lower
[1:19:37] place God's righteous judgment his
[1:19:40] righteous word is established in the
[1:19:42] heavens forever he has established his
[1:19:45] word it shall never ever
[1:19:48] change its established assured in the
[1:19:52] heavens and he has marked it up here and
[1:19:55] then he has this line he marks it down
[1:19:57] the earth and he says you stand right
[1:20:00] there
[1:20:00] Amen what does he do he has the ability
[1:20:03] God has the ability to take His perfect
[1:20:06] word and transfer it into the dirt into
[1:20:09] your body into your life amen
[1:20:12] to make sure that you are in the exact
[1:20:15] same points was Ethan he starts building
[1:20:17] you've been stood right where the
[1:20:19] foundation is you're built upon Christ
[1:20:21] you're going up to Christ you start with
[1:20:24] Christ the cornerstone you end with
[1:20:25] Christ the capstone amen amen let's just
[1:20:31] in closing let's go over to second
[1:20:32] Timothy Christ has to have the
[1:20:37] preeminence over everything in our lives
[1:20:40] every temptation every habit every
[1:20:42] weakness Christ has to have the
[1:20:45] temptation has to have the preeminence
[1:20:49] 2nd Timothy chapter 2
[1:21:06] verse 19
[1:21:13] second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the
[1:21:17] foundation of God standeth sure God has
[1:21:20] a foundation amen
[1:21:22] having this seal the Lord knoweth them
[1:21:25] that are his and let everyone that
[1:21:29] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[1:21:31] iniquity amen when you believe when you
[1:21:38] have those two things in your life you
[1:21:40] believe you know you were chosen by God
[1:21:43] you know who you are God has come across
[1:21:47] the threshold of your life and revealed
[1:21:50] unto you that you know who you are

[1:22:11] say that you say by revelation you say
[1:22:14] that's me
[1:22:15] Amen well there's another fold of that
[1:22:18] the second part of the verse
[1:22:20] nevertheless first verse 19 says
[1:22:22] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:22:24] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:22:27] knoweth them that are his and everyone
[1:22:30] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[1:22:32] from iniquity that's how you know that
[1:22:37] you're gonna get from the foundation to
[1:22:40] the capstone God placed a cornerstone
[1:22:43] upon the earth now everybody has their
[1:22:47] own he placed the corner so what's he
[1:22:49] doing
[1:22:50] where'd he place it in Zion God has
[1:22:53] placed a cornerstone in Zion
[1:22:55] what was that cornerstone it was the
[1:22:56] first stone of the building God was
[1:23:00] building a house think about it they
[1:23:03] built the temped a the the the temple
[1:23:05] and the time of David and they said this
[1:23:07] is the temple and they got destroyed
[1:23:09] they built it again in the time of Herod
[1:23:11] and they the disciples took Jesus on
[1:23:15] tour of it and they're showing oh look
[1:23:16] at all these great buildings and all
[1:23:18] those things looking at this great
[1:23:20] artwork and they took Jesus and they're
[1:23:22] walking through and they're trying to
[1:23:23] show off trying to impress them you know
[1:23:25] and I don't know I know you were born
[1:23:27] off over in Nazareth and I don't know if
[1:23:29] you spent a lot of time here in the
[1:23:30] temple but we just want to show you you
[1:23:32] know we've grown up around here and we
[1:23:34] know this place really well and we're
[1:23:35] pretty impressed with this building we
[1:23:37] think this temple Herod's temple is
[1:23:39] really splendid you know this is the
[1:23:41] temple of Jehovah look how great it is
[1:23:43] it took us 46 years to build this place
[1:23:46] and this temple this is the temple of
[1:23:49] Jehovah and Jesus looked at him and said
[1:23:51] tear this building down I will rebuild
[1:23:57] it again in three days and they looked
[1:24:02] at him and he said we spent far father
[1:24:06] spent 46 years building this temple we
[1:24:11] built we quit and we took the
[1:24:14] cornerstone we hewed it out of the rock
[1:24:19] and we placed it over here and we put
[1:24:23] our inscription upon it this is Herod's
[1:24:26] temple and we built everything off of
[1:24:32] that corner and for 46 years we put all
[1:24:39] of our effort into this building until
[1:24:43] the final touch at the pinnacle of the
[1:24:45] house Herod's temple was complete and
[1:24:49] you say that you will you could tear
[1:24:52] this down and rebuild it in three dates
[1:24:59] and yet the prophecy clear back at the
[1:25:02] time of David said the cat left corner
[1:25:05] stone that the builders rejected became
[1:25:09] the head of the corner they rejected the
[1:25:13] corner stone which was Christ and they
[1:25:17] took some other stone some stone
[1:25:22] selected by man and not the stone
[1:25:24] they're selected by God and they built a
[1:25:26] house and God tore down Titus 80 70 they
[1:25:34] burned it down
[1:25:34] and great was the room of the house now
[1:25:38] he rebuilt it
[1:25:39] three days well he rose again on the
[1:25:42] third day he was that cornerstone and
[1:25:46] let me tell you we must give preeminence
[1:25:50] to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ if
[1:25:53] we fail to give preeminence to the Lord
[1:25:56] you are so the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:25:57] Christ every single thing we build is in
[1:26:00] ruins you know and I and you know I grew
[1:26:05] up in all going to all kinds of
[1:26:07] different churches I've seen all kinds
[1:26:09] of religion in my life and let me tell
[1:26:12] you I got sick of it and tell you what
[1:26:15] when I come to the message and I see
[1:26:17] people not giving Prima's to the Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ I don't want any part of it
[1:26:24] because I have one cornerstone that I
[1:26:26] stand upon and that's Jesus Christ
[1:26:29] and I will give preeminence to one I
[1:26:34] remember you know there was a time you
[1:26:36] know as a teenager that I quit calling
[1:26:40] myself a Christian because I had seen so
[1:26:45] many things go on in the name of
[1:26:47] Christianity that I said I'm gonna just
[1:26:50] gonna call myself a follower of Jesus
[1:26:52] Christ in my own my own you know young
[1:26:58] Christian mind I had gone from church to
[1:27:01] church to church and I just I could
[1:27:04] always find a couple people that were
[1:27:06] more interested in Christ than the world
[1:27:09] but just a few such a small few I
[1:27:14] finally I was just I was sick of it I
[1:27:16] kind of I was like Lord I'm just gonna
[1:27:18] call him and call myself a Christian was
[1:27:20] gonna call myself a follower of Christ
[1:27:21] because I don't want to be linked with
[1:27:23] those that are standing between the
[1:27:25] world and Christ and so so when I you
[1:27:30] know what and I studied I studied other
[1:27:32] churches I read about the Methodists I
[1:27:35] read about the Lutheran's I read about
[1:27:37] and I I marveled because I had friends
[1:27:41] that were Baptists I had a lot of
[1:27:42] friends or Baptists and they would make
[1:27:45] fun of me for being Pentecostal and you
[1:27:47] know and all those things and you know
[1:27:50] making fun of all the gifts in the
[1:27:52] church
[1:27:52] and everything and and I was thought
[1:27:56] Lord you had me born in a Pentecostal
[1:28:00] family what would have happened if I'd
[1:28:05] been born and a Baptist family I would
[1:28:11] be just like them believing the Baptist
[1:28:15] theology and I saw our Lord if you had
[1:28:19] me been if I would have been born in a
[1:28:22] Catholic family I would have grown up
[1:28:25] believing the Catholic doctrine and
[1:28:27] these were my thoughts as a teenager and
[1:28:30] I like Lord where are you and where is
[1:28:34] your church and I went from church to
[1:28:38] church I and I finally and I looked and
[1:28:41] I always saw how every church was
[1:28:43] created by a revival you know and I
[1:28:47] looked at the read about his oozes
[1:28:50] Street and all those things and and and
[1:28:52] I looked and I saw that there was always
[1:28:55] there was always a revival that got me
[1:28:58] in started and then after a while they
[1:29:01] would drift away and then after a
[1:29:05] hundred years or so the people that
[1:29:07] lived in that church were no longer had
[1:29:10] the same zeal they're no longer on the
[1:29:12] same foundation so those that founded
[1:29:15] the church stood upon a solid rock
[1:29:18] Christ but when they set their doctrine
[1:29:21] here they were off the word and then
[1:29:24] there and then word they got off further
[1:29:27] and further and further amen and drifted
[1:29:30] away from the word so that the
[1:29:31] grandchildren canola's Holy Spirit
[1:29:35] couldn't lead them they are no longer
[1:29:37] connected to Christ the head Amen so
[1:29:40] when I came to this message I was pretty
[1:29:41] excited when I I don't know if you can
[1:29:45] envision how excited I was to hear the
[1:29:49] things that brother Graham said about
[1:29:51] denominations because I'd seen I was
[1:29:53] sick of it I was tired of it amen and I
[1:29:56] started listening I had listened to the
[1:29:58] tapes day in day out day in day out and
[1:30:01] then one day I heard somebody start
[1:30:04] talking about creating a message
[1:30:06] cheer in the morning and I wanted
[1:30:11] nothing to do with it so I'm just
[1:30:14] telling you my thoughts I wanted nothing
[1:30:17] to do with a message search into one
[1:30:18] because I was excited about brother
[1:30:21] Bram's message but when I found out that
[1:30:24] there were entire churches that had been
[1:30:26] following the message for 50 years I
[1:30:28] thought oh well this is gonna be the
[1:30:32] same thing I've seen all over that that
[1:30:36] they might have been true 50 years ago
[1:30:38] but there is no way that they have kept
[1:30:40] the revival up over 50 years and I am
[1:30:43] NOT interested in building a church here
[1:30:46] in des moines you know I'm not that was
[1:30:47] my thoughts now I wasn't right in my
[1:30:49] thinking I really was not right in my
[1:30:52] thinking because I do believe in the
[1:30:55] local ministry I do believe in a local
[1:30:57] church and what I didn't realize was the
[1:31:02] thing that keeps the church is giving
[1:31:06] Christ they had the preeminence and
[1:31:10] every single thing we do not just in
[1:31:14] token not just in word but in our every
[1:31:18] action and our very in our prayers we
[1:31:21] are so connected to Christ the head that
[1:31:25] we love him we adore him we love
[1:31:27] everything that he does we love
[1:31:29] everything that he says we are in love
[1:31:32] with the Lord Jesus Christ amen we love
[1:31:35] the way he acts the way that we love the
[1:31:37] way he moves and we hate everything that
[1:31:39] is against him in his word and we refuse
[1:31:42] to allow anything to draw us off away
[1:31:46] and the only way we can do that is by
[1:31:48] following the leadership of the Holy
[1:31:50] Ghost
[1:31:51] so my thinking was that there was no way
[1:31:54] that there could be a message church
[1:31:56] that could still be in living according
[1:32:00] to the vision of brother Branham I was
[1:32:03] wrong it's possible it's possible but
[1:32:10] there's only one way that it's possible
[1:32:12] and that's by the Holy Ghost the church
[1:32:17] has to be alive amen
[1:32:20] and it won't be a denomination it can
[1:32:24] never be a denomination when brother
[1:32:26] Branham says they will never denominates
[1:32:28] he was talking about a Holy Ghost filled
[1:32:32] Church
[1:32:32] it cannot it's the bride what'd he do he
[1:32:35] was a prophet he put forth the word
[1:32:38] there will be a bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:40] Christ
[1:32:42] now when brother Branham said that where
[1:32:44] did that word go the word went out he
[1:32:49] was a true prophet of God and when a
[1:32:52] prophet prophesies that word is a seed
[1:32:56] and it has to go out and bring forth of
[1:32:59] its kind amen and let me die I'm here to
[1:33:02] announce today that that word has come
[1:33:04] into my heart
[1:33:05] amen is bringing forth of its kind amen
[1:33:09] and I am a part of the bride of Lord
[1:33:10] Jesus Christ I've heard it I believe it
[1:33:13] I accept it yes and amen amen and every
[1:33:17] single promise of the book is mine amen
[1:33:21] I believe it I will be a part of the
[1:33:24] Bride of Christ so there's certain
[1:33:25] promises that are coming my way and they
[1:33:29] are that I will be without spot without
[1:33:31] wrinkle I will be believing when he
[1:33:34] comes there will be faith on this earth
[1:33:35] when he comes when the son of man comes
[1:33:37] because it will be in me
[1:33:38] amen and I will be believing I will
[1:33:40] enter into his rest amen these signs
[1:33:43] will follow them to believe and I am a
[1:33:45] believer amen and that is the truth I
[1:33:49] will says every true church will write a
[1:33:50] book of Acts behind it that's what
[1:33:52] brother Graham said Amen well that word
[1:33:55] is a seat amen and I've received the
[1:33:57] seed and I am resting on that seat
[1:33:59] because I have entered into his rest
[1:34:01] amen i the word has been planted inside
[1:34:04] of my heart my trust has been playing in
[1:34:07] your Savior amen so like the farmer I
[1:34:10] have done the labor I've cleared out all
[1:34:13] the rocks of unbelief I've cleared away
[1:34:15] all the weeds I've good you know I've
[1:34:18] let everyone the name with the name of
[1:34:20] Christ depart from iniquity amen I've
[1:34:23] done the best I know how to do to do
[1:34:25] that amen and what I am rusty why am i
[1:34:29] resting because
[1:34:30] the seed has been planted in my life and
[1:34:33] the Holy Ghost will water it will see it
[1:34:38] grow a mint and day in day out I am
[1:34:41] gonna cherish that seed and I'm gonna
[1:34:43] keep my ground clean amen and watch by
[1:34:49] giving preeminence to the Lord Jesus
[1:34:51] Christ all the fears I had as a teenager
[1:34:54] will be taken away because we're not
[1:34:57] here to live in fear we're here to live
[1:35:00] in faith amen amen we don't have to be
[1:35:04] lukewarm we don't have to be lukewarm
[1:35:08] we've been given permission to not be
[1:35:11] lukewarm through the fire of the Holy
[1:35:14] Ghost amen and I believe a man let's
[1:35:17] just stand hey man god is good isn't he
[1:35:24] Saints hey man let's just pray Heavenly
[1:35:29] Father our sincerest desire Lord is to
[1:35:32] be real Christians Lord connected to the
[1:35:36] head which is you Jesus Christ Lord a
[1:35:40] life filled with the Holy Ghost Lord
[1:35:43] when you gave the Holy Ghost the way
[1:35:46] that you described it has never left my
[1:35:48] memory Lord Lord you said that we would
[1:35:50] be filled with the Holy Ghost you said
[1:35:53] we'd be baptized into the Holy Ghost you
[1:35:56] said it'd be the baptism of fire Lord
[1:35:59] that we'd be anointed Lord amen that you
[1:36:02] would be in us Christ the head in us
[1:36:05] Lord and those those descriptions Lord
[1:36:08] will never leave me Lord because I
[1:36:10] believe that a man can be immersed and
[1:36:13] the Holy Ghost a man that he can grow up
[1:36:16] his feet is upon the foundation that
[1:36:18] when the when the stream rises up Lord
[1:36:21] and when the when he'll tries to overrun
[1:36:23] it Amen that we still stand we don't
[1:36:26] fall away we stand because upon Christ
[1:36:29] the solid rock we stand
[1:36:30] we're beholding the head which is Christ
[1:36:33] we have become real Christians Lord you
[1:36:36] said that that many in this last day
[1:36:38] would be lukewarm the Lord that we could
[1:36:42] hear what the Spirit is saying to the
[1:36:44] church
[1:36:44] and we could be ally of Lord and
[1:36:46] remaining when you come or it's a
[1:36:50] promise you said we you gave us
[1:36:53] permission Lord to be real Christians

[1:37:28] Lord and we believe Lord and the message

[1:37:34] prophet Lord and we want to be faithful
[1:37:37] to the vision that he had Lord that

[1:37:44] its kind so there will be a bride and
