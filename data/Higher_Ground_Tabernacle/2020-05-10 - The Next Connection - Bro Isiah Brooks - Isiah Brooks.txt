I hear him you love the Lord God is so good to us I'm glad he reached down his hand for me we want to greet the saints of God this morning but those who are listening by way of live streaming we like to wish the mothers Happy Mother's Day this is a day that I guess the United States celebrate mothers but reality is that Mother's Day is every day as long as Mama living she needs a Day celebrated we thank God for Mama we God for our precious brother Uriah we're feeling better this morning we trust that everybody that's been prayed foreign [Music] without the Lord let's pray Again by God's grace father we thank you for those uh who are on the prayer list so good to us remember the Elders of this particular assembly that you would keep them uh in good healthy remember the Saints in Iowa City Iowa City that you would keep them connected connected with you Lord we are all going through uh trying times but Lord you promised us no would you forsake bless those who we're praying foreign [Music] those who need help this morning there is no change in you [Music] Jesus Christ amen amen amen uh one thing for certain you can't pray too much the Bible says we pray without cease as we stand we ask that you turn with us appreciate our musicians we appreciate the song a leader and we definitely appreciate our interpreter so let's pray for him as well that uh my English would be clear enough for you as we stand we ask that you turn with us to Saint John the 11th chapter we appreciate all who works the sound systems trying to get all the Kinks out of it the knots trying to get all the knots out of it we know that God is going to bless us we appreciate the brothers who have donated the church the mixing board the mixer as well as the new new camera that we have may God bless you thank you for beneath Saint John the 11th chapter beginning at the 25th verse thank you you know if you have no battles you have no victories and we know that all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord a Christian can never failure is always Victoria because of Jesus Christ our Victory is in Jesus you believe that this morning I tell you what when I get the glory you better get to him before I do yeah I cannot tell you how long I'm going to be there we appreciate the Lord beginning at the 25th verse 17th chapter Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he lives and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth all this is to me those are shouting words let us pray father we come before you oh Lord we thank you for your blessings we thank you Lord because you are in US we pray that you would cleanse it is [Music] you you may be seated I like to entitle this message the next connection the connection and I know that sounds pretty strange but you must realize that that God works in that way there's really no void in God everything is connected in what we call this space in time it may seem like God works [Music] but you must realize that only in this dimension it's a quick thing it's like a thought it happens but with God he must do something he breaks things down in segments so that we can understand him uh God even worked with what we call dispensations when he uh uh changes himself his mask so massacre but we want you to understand his character never changed so God tell me for example for example when when Moses was delivering the children of Israel from Egypt there came water from The Rock he is and even though that water was in a chemistry formula Jesus in the New Testament Jesus tells us that he was that water when Moses smoked the rock even when he spoke to the Rock Jesus then said in the New Testament he was that rock hallelujah amen when the Manna From Heaven hell from in in in the company of Israel they didn't know what it was they don't know what it is Jesus in the New Testament because in Hebrews 13 and 8. Jesus says I am the same today I am the same as I was yesterday and I will be the same forevermore he is a God that does not change God doesn't make mistakes he's the only person that I know I never needed an eraser because he's and I say so that you can understand that God did not make a mistake when he chose you was his only choice there's none like you you are unique in your makeup you are unique in your character and there is none like you know nobody can take your place but God needs in this connection oh man when we think about the universe everything looks like it's floating in space because we can't see the connection it is a spiritual thing it is a supernatural thing the sun can't rise hallelujah amen until the moon sets [Music] and the moon cannot rise until the sun says [Music] it seems like they're not connected it's what [Music] [Music] y'all better hear what I'm saying they are all connected God is a family man you must understand a family is a unit they are connected by Blood somebody help me here think about this easy how that God chose a seed monster to show that he is the resurrection a little seed in pretty much the God planted by the spoken word there were seeds every seed brought forth its kind but as long as the seed was in the ground as long as it was under the water it could not produce what God wanted it to produce then God began to put everything in order to separate things somebody help me here man see that is the thing is like what we used to be we were like [Music] we had no idea we were connected [Music] to the sun somebody help me here because nothing could bring life to you doctors could not bring life to you Hallelujah it takes the sun because the sun is a type of the Resurrection y'all hear me the sun was set in order so that even those who remembers who could not read all right Divinity Hallelujah we don't have three sons [Music] is Everlasting Hallelujah you understand me I'm coming by God's grace the message expression the problem God says it like this when the sun begins to bathe the Earth you can't hold it or you can't hold life monster [Music] the Su is the s-u-n is the resurrection of all botany life you can't hide it as as long as the sun shines amen I've seen it I've seen little blades of grass [Music] push its way deep through the concrete it doesn't matter how dark your situation is [Music] strike the seed and even his disciples who had followed him for years [Music] you know he had his own uh understanding of what people were saying Jesus Christ but then Jesus said unto him Hallelujah who do you say I am that's what he asking you this morning because the voice of God still lives he still speaks Hallelujah and he still creates Hallelujah he's moving this morning he need for you to answer who do you say who do you say this message is hallelujah amen oh it's not the words of a man it's the words of God but who do you say he is the son of the Living God you're not just a prophet your God manifested In the Flesh you're the human manifestation of the invisible God we call Elohim somebody help me here that was the deepest Revelation that healer could have received at that moment Hallelujah but God told him there's coming another day Peter approaches that the same he will not be with you but he will be in you Hallelujah is that right that's why the problem that God tells us he's just not being justification it's not enough sanctification is not enough oh I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah what God wants in you is to form his life into you foreign somebody help me this morning even Jesus prayed amen Jesus father I want the baby one even as we are one Hallelujah is that right Jesus told us that God loves us even as he loved him and that the love of God loved us before the foundation of the world I don't know what you're talking about this morning but I'm trying to tell you Christianity is not being associated with the church or an organization that's like a club that's a common Club it could be a lot Christianity like Lucas you must make a connection or the son himself before the foundation of the world there's no there's nothing you can do you can't stop it foreign [Music] when Mary and Martha when they were there at the Garden Hallelujah Jesus told them one thing he didn't say we are the resurrection he said I am Hallelujah I don't need a group Hallelujah I don't need a a helping hand somebody help me he said come on somebody that means the resurrection in other words everything you see and everything you will see will come only [Music] hallelujah amen is that all right he said why see the gospel before he like live on Jesus has been preached I depreciate what is the problem with the people there's power there is no greater message outside of the Gospel you can preach about predestination you can speak about elections Hallelujah but when you take the man to Calvary because predestination can't work until Calvary juice there were Saints of old you had Moses when they died they were still in what we call a place of captivity we call it Paradise it was better than hell it is better than the region of the law but you still must understand they were still captive Hallelujah but they was elected they were chosen they did Mighty works on the Earth but still they were captive Hallelujah why because without the shed of your blood there is no remission of sins to release the prison doors to unlock the prison doors [Music] to release you from prison but but the gospel it can't work it will not work until you accept it oh come on somebody you gotta understand this you and I pray and prayer is good look what the prophet of God says glorify Jesus keep it up companies I think it's a good thing come out there and pour your heart out before God is the way to do it but really man that isn't what saves you you can stay there at the altar pray all night long walk up and down the altario you could do every Penance you could you can sell everything you got and give to the poor you can go on a fast for 40 days and get so out from fasting till you just couldn't walk and never do you any good until first I'm gonna say that again and when you believe it that settles it forever I believe the message but it's not enough just to say I believe it with your head it must be believed with your heart and out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak you understand me foreign [Music] [Music] amen Hallelujah and sometimes selfish but God is looking for somebody who would die to their will we need the connection right now see the world falling apart but we need a connection she gotta bring a connection if you look for it it's already here oh let me back it up a little bit you and I must understand Jesus is here right now amen his spirit is here right now what you're feeling is the spirit of Christ he's in this room right now oh Lord send your power just now he's here his power is here he's in a different dimension you can't see him but he's here and then God gives you the Holy Ghost so that you can feel him sometimes foreign this morning as far as returning we talk about the returning of Jesus but he's also is here you know the world don't understand it but it's like radio waves the radio waves are here but you can't see them the television waves are here but you need the right channel that's what it is and when we come to church we should come to China that Dimension it comes by meditating sometimes Hallelujah keeping your mind stead on him he said if you keep your mind stead on me I will grant you perfect peace see that is it had to become visible how many times the prophet of God would say and everybody's looking around without me but there were those who could see him some people say well I saw Jesus some said I saw the pillars many have said I've seen angels it seems like that natural Veil move back and then the spiritual steps in one spiritual and this is an individual thing it's not a group thing it's an individual thing that we begin to see Christ we're getting ready to embrace the resurrection will be able to see the resurrection they'll walk right by you and if your eyes are not eyes you see you won't see them he was always there you love the Lord hey you and I must know that he's already here you see now today just imagine his presence being here today as I said the Lord Jesus is in another world he's in another world and that's what we must understand you can't live in Two Worlds at the same time you're going to either live in this world are you going to live in the world that cannot be seen that's why the Bible says set your affection on things above set your affection on things above not on the earth this is not our world if we are back to this world at least we're supposed to be help me Lord hallelujah right imagine his presence being here today the Lord Jesus is in another world or another Dimensions right here today in form of the spirit is blending in with our spirit you not only want to heal here but you want to feel him and the only way you can feel him is that you allow your spirit amen to blend in with the spirit I don't believe that I don't like what he's preaching you're shutting God out because if it's God's word and you rejecting his word you are rejecting him Hallelujah that's why some people can't get the Holy Ghost sitting right in the service Hallelujah why because the preaching of the words and then they allowed themselves they hear the word not with just the ears but the spiritual ears see that's how you know you're saying when your spiritual Hearts that's your intellect not your reasoning Hallelujah something let you know it's done it's finished Hallelujah you love the Lord man Hallelujah see our eyes can't see him because that they are physical yet unless there would something happen I'm wondering that we could see this Vision Hallelujah but he is here just as visible just as real real as he was the day that he spoke to Mary see a lot of times we want to put God in history God is soon to come but God is a right now God I'm trying to bring something to you this morning to be disconnected and when you fall in sin the first thing you do restore the connection father cleanse me because when God said come up here and you're not connected if this life separates [Music] it doesn't matter if all you got left of yourself God will make it come back to itself Hallelujah you're not going to come back with something different you're going to come back with the same nose the same eyes the same here but better [Music] because I know he's in the building I know he's in the house but most of all is in me he's in you Hallelujah and that soul is magnetized it's a connection to be a Christian I don't know what to do there's no way as a Christian you can fail Hallelujah because we are accepted because every one of your mistakes have been thrown into the sea of forgetfulness God can't see you he hears your voice [Music] when he looking at a Christian it's the righteousness of your son Jesus Christ he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God hallelujah amen and the devil says you're just a hypocrite you need to preach back to the devil I should never be a hypocrite because my life is here this morning [Music] as long as I'm in Christ I'm Sanctified as long as I'm in Christ Hallelujah I made whole what you looking at devil the blood prevails y'all better hear what I'm saying this morning I'm doubting God hallelujah believe God stop doubting God hallelujah when the devil says hallelujah it's not by your words it's by his words it's what he's already done he saved you he called you he elected you and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he gave me some good punches Hallelujah but still yet man he couldn't hold me down [Music] yes God has ordained deceiving you never to quit who can never give up even though sometimes you may feel like giving up that will not give up thanks be to God for the power of the Holy Ghost because of his life in US Hallelujah man but the seed of God they don't know why they believe it and they accept it Hallelujah Mary said when the angel told marriage cause I'm the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you shall bring forth Hallelujah [Music] but nevertheless I don't know how he's gonna do it don't know how he's going to do it but I said being unto me a clean heart created me a real new spirit amen the fullness of Christ thank you hallelujah amen he is the high priest of our confession the Hebrew says the Hebrew letter says he's the half priest of our confession welcome [Music] [Music] you are crazy but your craziness is of God not of this world think about it [Music] and all these Roman emperors were plum crazy for something you cannot see that those Emperors didn't see him when they stole Stephen [Music] nobody else could see him but Steven eyes and when they were killing those Christians those Christians they didn't run away [Music] but all they could do is run to the lions in a moment's time it'll be all over is that right that's the same way Paul looked at it because [Music] I was over there she behind the curtain of town Hallelujah he said I saw Millions oh my gosh I'm one of those Millions [Music] I'm sorry [Music] to Jesus Christ amen talking about a connection I don't know if there'll be anybody sick this morning radio wherever you are even in this place you just make that connection the Holy Spirit you can ask what you're real you don't have to feel it you just got to receive it you got it right now you got it receive it in the name of Jesus Christ my mind he's the high priest Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah amen we prayed those documents coming back brother if they ain't there yet they're coming they got to come I don't care if they threw them in the trash you believe that I believe that with all my ah come on girl whatsoever you asked the Lord in his name believing that you shall receive it shall be given to you hallelujah amen oh my is that right so we pray trusting in God tonight on Jesus in his Mercy in his kindness and mercy that he will give to us this abundance of Grace now remember we must accept it Hallelujah and if you accept it it's yours Mary accepted and she saw no signs of her being pregnant on us is that right amen the Bible says amen that they can they cannot be made perfect Hallelujah is that right amen that's Hebrews 11 40. say they cannot come to that Perfection Hallelujah and brother Brandon said it like this how did those Old Testament Saints and without us Paul said we are encompassed about that with so great a cloud of witnesses than looking into this thing cheering you come on Jesus Christ you can make it you just need to be connected you can do it Sasha [Music] amen without us they are not perfect so they depending on us to believe God's word help us Jesus man you love the Lord hallelujah can I give a few more minutes yeah look at something here turn with me uh Genesis 49. y'all love the Lord I don't know I I feel so sorry for the atheists I'm so sorry for those who who can't see or believe the boys I mean

mean I think about some of the sisters who couldn't have their weddings oh my I know that's painful but don't don't be too discouraged if I had a choice which wedding I would want give me that one in the sky that's going to be greater Hallelujah and in that wedding they're gonna Pretenders everybody's going to be real somebody help me here oh glory to God that's the greater wedding yeah Brothers

Jeanette I love to be next standing next to you when you see her I want to see your expression Genesis 49. beginning at the eighth verse I want to say to those who are listening at home we still got some Empty Chairs you could have come to church God is testing you he's opened up the door you understand me we're still social distancing because that's what our government wants us today Hallelujah but I was expecting these chairs you understand me amen what I'm trying to say is socializing oh it's true to give the bread uh to children's bread whoo Jesus called her a dog she didn't get no attitude there was something in here and no matter what he said amen amen that's how it is she said that's right it's easy right Lord when she said Lord I can almost feel the fluttering of Jesus heart and she said he said unto her I've never seen such Faith Jesus [Music] says Lord even the dogs these are the crumbs mostly men that falls from the master tables you don't say oh Lord that's for him when you humble yourself Hallelujah let me hurry here this is 49. we love the Lord oh I feel good this morning I I I came expecting God and I can truly say I have not yet been disappointed if you

never doubt it the Bible said Abraham never at the promises of God Hallelujah say Mary Marie how you know come on you're gonna bring forth a child because the angel says the word of God says I can find myself if that virgin didn't have a name but now it's me I'm married the bride doesn't have a name because she's a member of anybody but when Christ brought me to the world when he impregnated me Hallelujah I became not only his bride but the wife has made herself ready but the blood keeps me coming I'm stirred up uh Genesis 49. at the eighth verse Judah Thou Art he whom the Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judas is [Music] Judah is a lion's web from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couches crouched couches as a lion and as an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law Giver excuse me the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver

wonderful counselor the almighty God has come the peacemakers to bring peace [Music] oh yes yes yes yes we hallelujah amen y'all don't believe that there was a woman we call her Mary was that Simon's house [Music] tormented by devils she walked into Simon's house everybody was ignored that's how it is in church today you can go to a dead church and come out alive amen But You Gotta Have Eyes to

Spirit Lift Me Up by myself I want some of that that's how we say it over here [Laughter] laughs give me some of that you know what I'm saying oh God help us Jesus and here come Jesus I'm almost done I have to finish later but the point is when you're connected we must stay connected disconnected Hallelujah but don't feel like you're lost because you never can never can be lost Hallelujah God ain't resting upon the way you think about it but think about it when you make that connection people don't understand I remember when I got saved the Holy Ghost came in my life they call it an afro but I had a bush and you know of course I thought I was all of that and back in my day we had our psychedelic clothing we call them platforms but they were men high heels now that I can see bottoms I bare bottoms somebody I thought I was all of that until I met Jesus when I met Jesus you I cut my hair when I met Jesus my wardrobe changed my my my brother you see I wanted to reflect Christ I didn't want to look like the world I didn't have them anymore I didn't put them away but they put me away is that right oh you holier than that you did Hallelujah you see when Christ comes here there is a change it changes is that all right so let me say it like this but you and I must understand the Prince of Peace is here we need here in a world of turmoils we need a resting place there's only one resting place it's not on Saturday people say the Sabbath day Jesus Christ is the Sabbath day there's so much I wanted to say this morning oh my God help us but but let me say it like this listening and that's in Christ amen yeah I'm gonna start with this because I'll connect this by God's grace when you're buried in Christ those people said when the Resurrection comes you go with the resurrection I don't care if you're in Jerusalem I don't care if you're in South America or America or Canada if you buried in Christ that is God ain't Rapture and nobody in Egypt no Hallelujah is that right God a Rapture nobody in the world is that right Joseph said don't bury my bones don't leave me down here in Egypt because when the resurrection all by him when when Jesus Christ comes the

we'll get up somebody help me because you're buried in Christ remember Jesus said I am the resurrection and I am the life and when Jesus died the Bible tells us he went into the region of the laws that were in prison those that were in Egypt those who were in hear them but because they believed they believe that dog is it good it was a type only video it was a type of Shiloh Hallelujah Jesus I got another stop I gotta go by Paradise Hallelujah I love this because I didn't get to it but I'm gonna tell you Abraham called a field [Music] double portions Abraham was buried there Sarah was buried and did you know that that gravesite what's near the place job was buried so you understand the Bible says let me read it again until Shiloh come and unto him shall be unto him shall the Gathering of the people be obese so when when Joseph said bear with me not in Egypt you bury me in the promised land yeah I want to be one of my relatives but this time man the burial ground it's not natural we are buried in Christ and we are buried with Christ somebody help me here so the burial ground is in Christ because in Christ in Christ you cannot die so the saints of God when we leave this
