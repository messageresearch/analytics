if you like god god is good to us i um don't know i'll just say it like this for those of you who did not make the service last night i would encourage you go listen yeah go listen it was really really really really wonderful and i appreciate our brother ben he's going to be coming him and his wife i think singing and all that good stuff as they usually do good to see you my brother god is so good to us we thank god uh for all things amen oh this is what i wanted to say uh brother branham preaches a message proving his word 1965. you need to go hear that listen to it and when you listen to it i trust everybody understand because i don't have an interpreter when you listen to it i trust that you pray that god gives you the revelation of what brother branham or god is saying [Music] it will release you from all your fears [Music] it's important that you go listen to that this is the hour to be uh rejoicing in spite of the trials that we're going through all of us are being tried in various ways i'm not going to be you understand [Music] and that's what we must i was thinking uh earlier during the service [Music] you are the victory of jesus christ this is why you're here but i'm not the preacher and i know how preachers do [Laughter] amen our brother being the righteous old friend of mine [Music] [Music] [Music] so let me get out of the way i don't say it and done enough probably a little bit too much we just got one service and uh so pull from the gift of god out of the way um the last time he was here very sick he's very well now amen praise the lord amen praise the lord jesus as far as i'm concerned he stopped too short brother isaiah is one of my favorite preachers in the whole wide world and he's one of my favorite people in the whole wide world i encountered an honor and a privilege to be able to call him a friend and i i mean sincerely and you know brother branham said friendship is a gift of god you may not speak to them all the time i appreciate i believe that brother isaiah was a gift to me not to leave out sister ruby she's been precious to our family as well we love you both very very much and certainly thank you for allowing us to come this way again and uh appreciate the church body for receiving us and uh we just are looking forward to what the lord will speak to us i'm today that the holy ghost will absolutely pour out of his great blessings today upon all of us amen that's all right help him hit the ring ah buddy ain't no big deal this day we live in everybody no brother got some phone something chirping something whistling something wearing some kind of a thing it might have been the devil calling he's nervous about what i'm about to preach trying to put a stop to it anyways god bless you very much just want you to know how much we appreciate you listen i'm like this this is me i've got plenty of rose buds i just give them out all the time to people and it's not for flatteries i mean these things from my heart amen good good to see these boys over here again today you look like you took you your vitamins you looking healthy all right good good amen i tried to kill him last time i was here i give him corona hey man but you come out of it didn't you buddy yeah i'm sorry about that [Laughter] you're alive that's right amen that's the thing well the lord bless you you can be seated for just a little bit if you would like and i want to invite my wife to come if she will we're going to sing just a little bit and then get right into the preaching of the word of the lord good to see everybody in the house of god today when i grow up i want to play music just like this bunch right here now see the only problem with this these these these boys these good-looking boys over here the only problem with every single one of them is i don't know if there's a woman attached to any one of them which one we need we need to get some resumes out and take some applications amen and you get these get these boys attached to some singers i see you're doing it wrong you play the music but you need the female to do the singing ain't that right sam that's what i did i got me a female singer amen my old pastor used to say with a voice like that i'd let her sing me to sleep every night hallelujah but we appreciate the lord today and it's all right we've seen two or three songs all right god bless you very much and by the way when i get done preaching she's a school teacher and uh we're probably gonna go very quickly so in other words if you're gonna shake my hand in my mouth it's like jesus get me while i'm here amen because we're going to leave like a thief of the night pretty sure but uh anyways we appreciate the lord again and i'm gonna come over there and play and we're gonna sing a little bit [Music] i can't remember all the verses [Music] about two years ago sam and i wrote this song says lord help me i need your help had his feet [Music] crying bitter tears her life was full of guilt and wasted years as they mocked and criticized she knew she was despised yet the oil flowed from one who could forgive [Music] she cried help me lord i need you now and touch my life come touch me now [Music] help me lord help me jesus help me now come and touch my life come touch me now come touch me now [Music] ashamed of my sin so guilty within i needed someone who could rescue me and as i bowed down at his feet oh there came a sweet relief cause healing oil flowed from calvary [Applause] i cried help me lord need you now come and touch my life come touch me now help me jesus help me now come and touch my life come touch me now come touch me now [Music] and now i can sing [Music] thank you lord [Music] thank you now you have touched my life you've touched me now thank you lord thank you

amen that may not mean nothing to you but it means something to me yes sir i love being able to worship and i got to sing with my buddy frank amen that sounded good over there boy once you get on the bus come with us amen we'll do some traveling and some singing amen we'll go lay some empty hands on some empty heads call a few women to preach we'll have a church of thousands before midnight amen amen i'm just kidding of course you know that all right galatians chapter 2 verse 20. yes sir today i want to speak to you on these words jesus understands jesus understands our weaknesses amen i don't get no hurry today let's just absolutely settle into the word of god amen you got your spot there all right i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me the life which i now live in the flesh i live by how many tapes i can listen to no i live by how righteous i can be no i live because i follow a prophet well why do people believe that why do people believe that's the reason that they exist let me tell you something right now you every one of you everyone all your little ears you perk them up and listen right here brother ben if you live at all it's because of the faith of the synagogue and not because of you not because of me amen and then reading galatians 2 and 20. now let's look at verse 21. all right these two verses galatians 2 20 and 21. paul now says i do not frustrate the grace of god you got a word for that in french here here's the here's the definition of it clemency i suppose the fact or quality of being more merciful or tolerant than expected our expectation is for god not to be merciful to us for god not to want to put up with us ah the words amen in case you forgot it right notice i do not frustrate the grace of god i want you to think about that just a minute if christ needed you or me then there was no reason for the cross of calvary i didn't need him that i can't live this by myself amen let's pray together what your head's about this morning if you'd like to be remembered in prayer some special need would you raise your hand to the lord this morning amen god bless you my hands up too father thank you for your mercy lord thank you for being tolerant for being patient for giving us grace to grow and acknowledge to know how to grow lord we commit the service now to thy capable hands may your holy spirit i pray not only speak to us through thy word lord i pray you'll grant to everyone i commit we commit this to your hands and for every uplift we commit these needs to you in the name of jesus christ and the church said amen god bless you may be seated may the lord bless you really good amen it's about all i know in french but i like to say it amen and looking now just to hold your bible there in galatians for a moment i want to call your attention to a couple things the first thing i want to point out the apostle paul is identifying himself has been crucified with christ one of the first things you've got to understand is that in order to be a true child of god we must die to ourselves our ideas our thoughts jesus crucified golgotha being interpreted the and that's where you and i must be crucified all of that must die in order to produce eternal life and without that death there can be no resurrection if i am going to live in jesus christ i must be crucified with him remember he was a subject to death he made himself subjects he come on somebody give me a little amen or something praise the lord now listen to me the holy ghost is wanting us to do the same exact thing god doesn't want to overtake us jesus doesn't want to force us he doesn't want to make us do anything but he wants us to surrender ourselves to the death of the cross remember that he said nevertheless even though i live in this flesh it is not me that liveth anymore but christ who lives inside of me you see we ain't happy enough about that [Music] everything was made amen and praise the lord his whole mission was to come together that christ could be born in you which is the hope of glory let me tell you something right now my only hope in this life my only hope in this life is is that reality without that in my heart i'm live in a fine house but brother when russia hits that button over there and this nation is laying an atomic fodder amen it won't matter one thing you come on somebody preach to me now amen it is something that wants you to leave this life everything you've ever accomplished is null and voice you might be a very good looking person i've always been jealous of that i've never felt like i was ever really a good looking person some people might have great strength in their muscles they take great confidence and how much they can bench press but let cancer strike that body one time there is and the skin worms are destroying lays upon that new birth experience amen hallelujah as i said we're not happy enough about it we come to church and hear this and we sit down and say well it's not wonderful well you know i'm a curious sort of person i'm always asking questions yes to answer your question i do get in trouble a lot but i wonder to myself sometimes before why is it even the christian church seems to have lost their joy about what god has done within why the church is not more surely that would bring you to the house of the lord shouting and rejoicing [Music] thanks be to god forevermore i was a sinner now i am a saint of god that should make you worship a little bit but i'm going to tell you why it doesn't and here is the reason i'm preaching my text this morning [Applause] you can at least blink your eyes at me every now and then that won't hurt my feelings right you know yourself you know how lazy you can be you know how aggravating you can be [Applause] you know in this day and age people love to visit landmarks i remember the civil war i remember when the the when congo used to be or such and such i remember when africa used to be this i remember when europe used to look like that christians have done the same thing i remember when we used to have joy i remember when we used we enjoy i remember the day when the lord saved me but we have long forgotten that jesus christ is the same yesterday today come on now preach to me and forever if you ever had choice you can have it right now if you ever had a shot it don't have to be a thing of history you can lift him out of history but i'm going to tell you what hinders us our weaknesses it's not those things that god delivered us up when we got you see when a man used to smoke cigarettes or drink and watch where it lands for later on [Music] you take a man that was a drunkard or a woman for that matter when god forgives him gives him the holy ghost what he can't take that impatience from you because that was born in your flesh oh i see you're looking at me now all right now listen close when you got the holy ghost how many got the holy ghost put your hand up come on don't be ashamed if you're born again tell it let the redeemed of the lord say so now when you got to holy ghost and he changed your nose did he you are the same person today as when you got received the holy ghost when you got saved if god because he knew you could not overcome that you would overcome because he knows you can whip it [Applause] jesus i said i got a message for you today jesus understands i want to tell you something quickly quickly quickly quickly i want to tell you this you thinking yourself that god is frustrated with you god were you a human when you got saved evidently it didn't bother him he gave you the holy ghost in spite of you y'all like what i'm saying he wasn't looking at that part anyways he wasn't looking at how [Applause] it ain't no good but that i don't have enough faith for me well that got some interesting looks on some interesting faces because you see we have a tendency to believe it's my faith that keeps me see my god as long as i believe i'm a son of god as long as i believe i'm a daughter because you see human faith has an expiration date people running around my choice my choice i chose i chose what did you choose when it comes time to eat after church let's go eat mexican i don't know i don't want to go eat mexican i'm tired of mexican i want chinese i don't want chinese i want to eat italians and on the way to the italian restaurant you've done decided you want mexican instead this is why brother bradham said you're only saved as long as you believe you are well [Applause] [Music] even he always believes and god believed his own words oh come on somebody preach to me wow i don't live by my face i live by his face as i know how we are oh i don't care what the color your skin is you're a human being like everybody else you got pride no girl you got arrogance you think you're something and those that don't think there's something they take joy in being nothing there's no all it takes is just a just a little thank god i don't live by my face amen thank god right but now paul is saying i don't frustrate his grace because of your feasts and celebrations and traditions you have frustrated god and frustrated his grace well he said so that's all become a stink in my nostrils is that played the part of a laying under every green tree remember that when he talked about going to idols she's laid under every green tree committing adultery with everything around her now we look at god if i am a born-again child of god it is impossible it is impossible for me to ever go to hell [Music] well that didn't get the ring i was looking for let me say it one more time make sure you take your time on this now it is impossible for me to go to hell if i'm a born again child of god god cannot don't lie in church tell the truth in church now [Applause] to [Applause] the second thing i want to share with you is that often we get this in our mind that because god is just that he is going to beat us with us correct repenting all the time of little tiny that there is no mercy for the bride you are the bride of jesus christ so if you lose your temper you better look out daddy's gonna get your well i don't even have to know your language to know that i'm real close to home with you right now as human beings of what kind of father he truly is now turn me to second peter chapter 3 this is where my word comes in leniency clemency there would not be a moment of our life that we wouldn't have a spanking coming but now watch us in second peter chapter 3 verse 8. that a god that comes to the end of a thousand-year reign looks down and says oh what a day that was you realize when the church ages and all of this is over with [Applause] [Laughter] well i want to ask you something then what is your 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 year lifetime mean then to a god that a thousand years is like one day what is that little tiny five-minute mistake that you made what's it say to a god andrew that a thousand years is like one full day i'm here to tell you it means nothing to him oh it means something to us we'll carry on and we'll barely ache and groan and grumble devil pressing right now satan you better get ready i'm coming anyhow you watch and see how that we act when it comes that way we will spend more time being that is not the [Applause] for seven years let's say what is that to a god that's got a thousand years feeling as a day yeah glory to god well church i'm to preach with you or without you but i'm preaching anyhow so good time to get your mouth open and say amen right but you see what we do as human beings already little turtles you have retreated into your shell and this is why your shout has become historically remember that he does not deal with us you take this little child in this mother's arms right here which one of you fathers would want to grab it by its neck and take a stick and beat it [Applause] there is a before he allows you to misbehave oh but see that was easy to say amen too because we look at him as he's a judge he is a just god but do you ever stop to think how merciful he really is you see folks the hardest person to forgive is your own self the person you now listen again james chapter 5 verse 7 well hallelujah y'all didn't make an amen tape that we can fill in the gaps with you all have amen services well if you've got it cue it up i may need to borrow your electronic amends every now and then it's all right the thing will hurt you now james 5 verse 7 i've been at this 31 years i ain't killed nobody yet now watch be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord jesus behold the husbandman stomps he waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth you see this is his attitude you are precious come on somebody help me this morning he doesn't look at you as a bother you are not an aggravation to jesus he is not one of these fathers that get irritated at their children when they come around he can't wait to be in your presence [Music] the same that you feel about him that he feels about you he can't wait to get in your [Music] for as long as it takes i might as well say it i can feel your thinking i can feel you and i can hear some of you thinking well brother ben you're trying to give us a license to live any way we want to say well when you get bored again then you'll get that devil out of your mind and then we can go on christians don't have that attitude and if you've got that attitude you're not a christian amen and amen praise the lord roger i don't care what you say amen or not that's the truth christians aren't looking for loopholes they're not looking for little side roads to take you know they got the pop no if you got that in your mind you don't even know what i'm talking about this is only for those that are trying to walk notice you are precious fruit to him now what farmer do you know okay we'll go down through a great big apple orchard and see some of those red and delicious and honeysuckle and some of those honey crisp apples some of them granny smith apples go down through there and see a bug on that tree or see weeds at the bottom of that tree and then run over and get a big ax and start chopping that tree down you are the stupidest tree i've ever seen in my life why can't you get them bugs off if you were any kind of a tree at all you wouldn't grow them weeds do you know what that farmer does he picks that bug and goes bloop he gets down and pulls him weeds up around that tree he gets one of them red and delicious next to his face and if he's a real farmer he starts talking to it you gotta talk to nature to get what you want out of it you are a beautiful red and delicious you ain't there yet but i know what you're gonna taste like one day my wife has got an apple pie with your name on it grow little apple grow right i know it's hard it's hard to translate hillbilly but you're getting there how absolutely out of your mind are you coming what's the matter are you crazy oh he don't look at the tree like that but he considers it precious the bug doesn't mean anything to him he doesn't get upset at the bug he deals with a bug but not quickly because you realize sometimes you gotta learn how to treat that plant and give you some time to figure it out i figured that's about the way this would go but you're going to be better when you walk out of here i promise right because remember he is waiting but you see we don't deal with our families that way we don't deal with our our friends that way we have no patience for anybody we just do we just get mad at the drop of a hat also a bit more the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said the prophet but the bible said the bible says and you're trying to make it walk when it's not able to yet you gotta have leniency you gotta have tolerance until it gets strength and it's little legs me you see because we are revelating people we know everything you don't think so just ask us we know everything we've got the opening of the word you can explain to somebody every plague and vile in the book of revelation to figure out why you get lazy and don't want to pray you were mute not a scripture not a quote not an explanation not a clue oh i know look at the angels in this church right now your halos are blinding me come on you all do the same thing that i do amen what do you do about those times what's god supposed to do grab his belt he knows you're still trying to walk because you forgot to read your bible we are better catholics than the catholics are catholics because we practice all of the same catechism see when a catholic does wrong they have to pay penance so they'll punish themselves in some to have peace with god thank god for a little fella by the name of martin luther because he found out what trash that was in the 16th century this is why paul said i am crucified with christ [Music] i don't have to punish myself i've already taken the punishment amen and yet at the same time he has long patience until he receives the early and the latter reign if you're brave enough to admit that that's the truth then there ought to be some deliverances in this church this morning right now because your weaknesses were designed by god oh they were placed there by god so that he can reflect his strength through you my god why can't we get that into our hearts why do we take cats of nine tails and beat ourselves when the very weakness that you're ashamed of is the thing god placed in you that shot amen amen and amen and amen and amen and amen amen amen praise the lord praise the lord most gladly he says i will glory in my infirmities the next time you get discouraged about yourself to not be able to do it can you take over i don't know that's what paul said if i can be righteous then christ died in vain i don't do it but because i can't do it of course pastor should have properly i don't have the that i'm helpless and i need his strength amen thank you lord jesus thank god he says i'll take pleasure [Music] and distress for christ's sake that is is when we know [Music] adoption brother says how can you preach the predestination of god foreign unless there's a sin atonement somewhere so all of you in this room this morning sitting around i'm predestinated i'm predestinated well good for you honey i'll give you a good stock gold star after church we've got this attitude that somehow we're the elite i believe the message because i am a prophetic class all right amen and praise the lord but you cannot hold that belief without knowing there was a lamb slain before [Applause] whoa you got to get with it man i ain't doing this come on come on get them legs up if he's going to be a translator he needs to translate all of it right come on let's jump a little bit come on come on oh mercy see your problem is this thing you got to unbutton that and go all right we preach all of this kind of idea oh we're the bride of jesus christ i am only his thank you lord brother man says why is it who in here is ready now to say amen to that for you that would not say amen when i said it now you can say amen truth is truth no matter where it comes from right but notice he said each day you make a mistake each day but if you're born again man and woman as soon as you speaker as you make the mistake god knows you're sorry for it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah think about it brother sister if he is hebrews 4 12. not only does he know my thoughts but he also knows my intentions [Music] he [Music] the moment you make a mistake you notice he says please comment i'm waiting for you to say amen to that all right good now she does things wrong do it again one more time right does things wrong i didn't say right now i said does things wrong right talk about the church i'm talking about the baptist now i'm talking about you gets a wrong thought [Music] i never smoke cigarettes got mad got discouraged this happens to me all the time you see people look at me well i've actually been accused of being hooked on dope my answer to that was you get the same holy ghost i got it i'll do the same thing for you right 64. you get the wrong impression sometimes and you'll get the thought that something that brother or sister's got something against you that's just the strength of our imagination he said make scooples or wobbles like a little child that's trying he's just trying to learn how to walk but there are constant areas of our life this pastor that we are still trying to walk in the machine you might master one thing all right listen close are you listening if you're listening say amen amen he doesn't whip us oh my god dear brother brad i'm going to say that well then why do we have it preached the other way listen to me i don't have to have an altar call every time i need i don't mean here from the local church but i mean listen around look at how you sisters have been preached on your entire life every time you come to church some preachers stand up talk about women listen brother i understand we've got to hold a standard in the tabernacle [Music] well just go check me out if you doubt me they asked the prophet of god what about that woman brother branham you know what he said but you see when it comes to our churches if a woman walked in here poorly dressed and i wouldn't i wouldn't be a good candidate today because i walked out of left tennessee and forgot my coat but and this was my title the woman of the wells first day in church could you imagine what them oh we don't like her kind around here but evidently jesus didn't share that opinion because he jeopardized his own reputation he will come to your he knew that her life was a mess those married people like that marriage and divorce i ain't dealing with them people in marriage conditions god thank god thank god that the lord still had that opinion in the 20th century because he took brother branham rock in arizona to show his attitude toward little women at the well because we're trying to walk and memorizing every word a real daddy would not whip his child when he's trying to walk if he falls on the floor he reaches down with a strong hand gets a hold of him say this is the way you do it son but you see a lot of preachers are the other way they like to get the baby by both hands and make its legs walk forward why no christian preacher needs to preach the gospel and then try to make you live it it is none of my business what you do with what i preach that's between you and god but you know what you see you see preachers that will preach it why they would get but i don't have facebook so i can spy on the people i preach to you about facebook not when he does something wrong but when it's gonna overtake him then if you are spiritual you go to that man otherwise sweep your own steps mind your own listen you got your hands full with your own mess pay attention to that moment [Applause] some of y'all are probably sitting there wishing i was still sick and on the way out the door don't you well i wish this guy would just get out of here amen but i'm well now so here comes the preacher right amen watch us in questions and answers brother batman was dealing with the tabernacle about the gifts of the spirit but now here he is in 1961 and the gifts are beginning to come back into the church now when the lord would fall on somebody and they would fall on them and they'd speak in tongues or prophesy sometimes they get it wrong so people were very nervous about how do you handle such things as that since i've been here in this church and and well i'll i'll just leave it like that all the things that prophet could have probably told us about his own people [Laughter] he said but you see you say now brother branham why didn't you correct this he says no no no when billy paul started walking back there but i believe he had a gift [Laughter] and then when he got to stumbling his big feet so brother bradham is saying you don't always jump in and correct everything you see when you think it's wrong i say this with great respects and great great honor to you as a mother and father i'm a daddy too there's mama sitting there but that's one reason some of our children not all of them now but some of them um and i know because i come up with his own children to him the knowledge of jesus christ we place our token over them and i can only hope and pray but eventually they'll make the right decisions [Applause] that's not the time to throw them in [Applause] all of our girls almost look like cookie cutters in the message all of them with a flat shoe an address from 1940 come on jezebel you good for nothing jezebel well i got news for you women want to be pretty and they're built to be pretty developers and god made him to be pretty now if any of you brothers get that on you i'm holding a prayer service after this meeting very quickly right but if they do anything curl their hair i said you go back and tell her but we're not here to please everybody do you understand that you could not live good enough to ever please the lord you could not live clean enough to ever please the lord because it is not your righteousness that pleases him it is his righteousness that makes me pleasing to the lord [Applause] and more because susceptible one thing about it if a man is going to do a woman's going to do something wrong they don't carry a 72 inch into their bedroom or bathroom in television but this little baby right here is portable and you can set it to men's room of mcdonald's and go to the belly of hell did you get it you can go right into a restaurant mcdonald's you can say mcdonald's and friends right yeah go to the bathroom at mcdonald's take your phone in there and go right to the depths of hell nobody does that mean you should take a piece of glass or tin and scar your face up to keep some man from looking at you i had a friend of mine some years ago him and his wife are having all kinds of marital troubles this guy wore shoes that were absolutely horrible holes in them his pants were filthy all the time holes all in his shirt he would not take care of his teeth [Music] and then he tried to tell me i just want my wife to be intimate with me and tell me she loves me and kissed me on the mouth and i went oh my god if i told him if i was her i wouldn't want to kiss you neither how could anybody ever be attracted to a cesspool it's all the same thing cesspool trash jump sewage just pick your metaphor they they get most of it anyways i think brothers if you if you're looking for a wife there's this little invention called soap and it is just as spiritual as your prophet's message come on now there is a way that you can show yourself to be attractive [Applause] [Music] a boy is not even allowed to see a girl as beautiful how in the name of god are you supposed to get married oh well she's a good cook that's good enough for me you better know more than that come on now and brother she can be as pretty as she can be and have a rotten attitude just believe me when i tell you before you buy that car you better know all about that car if it's got a busted radiator and a battery's badge you might ought to think about what your future looks like come on now but because we find ourselves to be spiritual people we think nothing in the natural even matters i'm gonna quote you a scripture right now he i know some people think i am absolutely the biggest they've ever seen i wash dishes i vacuum the floor i changed diapers she shows the diapers uh-huh i helped her in the home i don't just come home kick my big ugly feet up don't like me and say you're the woman you do at all you lazy thank you get up off the couch get that phone out of your face and learn how to be a real man hey man cause real men wash dishes real men will buy flowers [Applause] real fathers i have had pink in my hair and purple in my hair i have had to play with dolls i have had to have tea parties with baby dolls and i am a real man cause i know some men that wouldn't even think of doing such a thing with their children but them babies need you to care for us [Applause] then don't have them if you ain't going to take care of it right if you're not going to get down on the floor and play barbie dolls then don't don't have them in the first place and don't have him just to throw on her lap and say she's the baby maker she'll take care of him you should care about these things listen to me church in the years i've served the lord ask your pastor the majority of the prayer lines i don't hear people saying to me brother ben pray for me i just can't figure out who that third horse rider is pray for me i don't know i can't get that fourth seal just exactly right i've lost my kids don't want to be around me anymore [Music] if i call a number 80 of the new testament dealt with your life and about 20 of it was doctrine even ephesians chapter one a little later you see that's what being spiritual looks like if you've got one god i mean if god's revealed to you the right baptism and you are baptized correctly you're not going to spend the next six months trying to figure that part out that's done that's history come on somebody preach to me but it's the everyday is there any of you in here that have trouble with the serpent seed are you wondering whether brother i was a prophet or not that's good oh my god if you are you're in the wrong church the majority of you even some of you without the holy ghost you've got the right doctrine but you don't have the right spirit because you think god is your judge instead of being your father the and my father shows grace while i'm trying to walk he shows leniency it's just like education we tell people in this message education is of the devil and that is why people in our churches because we falsely accused brother branham of preaching that and he didn't know he's like what brother branham was against was people using education to explain god there are people sitting in this church right now that are probably absolutely completely intelligent but you have no ambition about yourself you think to be pleasing to the lord now sure as god made green apples i'm meddling but you have no ambition about yourself because you think it doesn't matter but jesus cares about such things as that listen to this in luke chapter 7 verse 19. can i go on a little bit i was going to anyways but i thought i'd be nice and ask first thank you for the mercy amen luke 7 verse 19. now this is john the baptist john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus ha there's things that happen disappointment he says that's what happens to all of us in your healing and things you'll find something didn't work right he's never experienced that things just didn't work right remember that's the enemy and god is permitting it to give you a trial and he sent two of his disciples and said go ask him now that was the poorest compliment he could have ever paid to jesus [Applause] jesus did not put him in hell he turned around and paid him the greatest compliment that could have ever been paid never was there a man born greater of a woman than john the baptist he understood where he was coming from oh now many of you are saying amen amen but what about you you think god don't understand where you're coming from as well now you got to give yourself the same grace if you're going to give it to john you got to give it to yourself the prophet tells us this he said isn't it wonderful he loves you before there was a world i got the log cut just a little bit more cutting to go we gonna go home but you just stay right in there with me just another minute or two listen i got a longer way to go than you all do so just bear with me he knows your nature he knows your weaknesses he knows your habits amen did you notice he never made an excuse well i can't use him he's got a bad temper moses had a temper david was an adulterer on and on and on right notice a perfect strike by the man says now we try we try to make our weaknesses an excuse i have no ability i am unable to do this now you know what's interesting everything brother branham is saying as though he's saying it about somebody else is all the things he said about himself i have no education no ability i can't do this brother said as long as you make those excuses so there's the other side of the fence yes well i'm no good i'm i'm i'm just a bad person well don't be so happy about it huh don't be so happy about it some people love to be miserable because for some demented reason they think that's being spiritual you can hear them when they pray oh lord i'm a miserable wretch i'm a sinner i'm low i've never seen people happier than when they are miserable they love putting themselves down well if we believe what this prophet says so why are you trying to remind him of the stuff he didn't care about in the first place it didn't stop him and he didn't care brother says like this we make excuses for our weaknesses and then god uses that very thing [Laughter] but we'll you're trying to say you can't accomplish nothing and learn to take a little risk in your life this is why some of you in this church have probably never spoke in tongues this is probably one reason many of you will never prophesy because you're not willing to get out of your own self long enough to let god use you to do something supernatural now i'm not saying you have to but some of you probably won't because you're to his full potential so let's quit making excuses then i can't do it well tell me something i don't know i'm insufficient preach to me a little bit i came to the world failing everything i put my hand to you that's not how i win i don't win by focusing on things that don't paul said brethren i count myself not i can't not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing i do for getting those things behind the only issues now i know let's say somebody has been molested or raped or some other kind of thing let's say somebody had great trauma in their life that as a christian amen do you ever notice how the devil did your past as a measuring stick for what you're going to be tomorrow listen to me carefully my [Applause] you may never forget that race if you are ever molested you may never forget that molestation but you in the name of the lord you can live with such powers [Music] look at verse 15. as many as be perfect [Music] now bible perfection does it mean sinless perfection it means maturity he who is going to be mature she that is mature let her be thus minded now i never heard brother baby say this till the other day in blasphemous we're done after this i promise preachers are liars i tell you i closed 40 times i'm lying through my teeth i'm going to close when the holy ghost is done but this is my last quote i promise he said we believe everything the bible says do no we are forgetting our weaknesses behind and pressing toward the mark of the high calling in christ you see the scripture says his mercy is new every morning so when my little bitty eyes go [Music] i just take them past weaknesses and say that was don't you understand you don't have to live under the weight of the past what are these little children instead of just walking on and going about their business well that might have been true but what's that got to do with now now that baby is walking that's what it focuses on it doesn't focus on the falls when you get your family albums out do you take pictures of when that baby was falling all over the place do you get your videos out and get a video of it and then show everybody look how stupid my child is look how ignorant this baby is this is the dumbest baby i've ever seen in my life you know what you say to it just a little while she's learning to walk just give her some time she's figuring it out maybe somebody might speak up and say oh yeah i remember when isaiah was walking that way i remember when old ben was stumbling along like that you know what they got the same daddy the one learned to walk and the other one will do the same that's the way it is with jesus folks he looks at your weaknesses and he lets you stumble along until you can figure it out and then when you figured it out not until you grow not until you get your big feet up underneath you where they belong and then you might hear a sermon that might remind you better get this thing fixed or i'm about to get in trouble anybody ever know when daddy was about to get him i could feel it before he walked in the dome i can feel the heat coming off his face he might have been a cool 98.6 but i could feel the fire and all of a sudden i'd hear that sound in the other room and i knew oh that leather is coming to me that's the way it is with jesus you know when you've overstepped your burdens when you have frustrated him to where he must deal with you but until then he does not whip you while you're trying to walk now if you want to walk out of here and accuse yourself of being no good and sorry in a rascally that's up to you but i have given to you the tools i've given to you the word and the ability to be able to walk out of here and be a brand new person if you want to be don't you blame the church because it's whether or not you want to walk whether you're going to do it or not you ever notice how with little kids those aren't so far they go through a stage we call cruising if it is [Music] these little idioms and things are hard to translate i know but he pulls himself up on the on the furniture you know and so mama she'll take all of her little pretties and she'll pull them back off the table she'll keep them just out of reach for that child so don't pull it in the floor that's why some things in the word are still out of your reach because if you don't learn to walk in this area then how can you know how to handle the pretties on the table so he'll sometimes keep things out of your reach until you get strong enough to know how to handle all of it i'm gonna tell you something friends i'm glad i serve this kind of daddy i said i'm glad i serve this kind of father and he is my champion of love amen and amen let's bow our heads together father we are so so grateful for how you speak to us by your words i've held the people a long time i pray that you'll reward them eternally for their patience today a lot has been packed into this service here we are 20 to 1 we start at 9 30 there's been a long time here [Music] i pray you wouldn't allow this time to fall to the ground [Music] tire the sleepy the hour going around all of it was worth it if you can bring change in the lives of your people lord how we love you how we thank you and we pray you'll bless your children in jesus name amen amen amen and the church said amen stand to your feet with me will you brother brooks please forgive me for being so long-winded this morning [Music] i am so sorry i transgressed your rules 45 minutes to an hour brother ben 45 minutes to an hour well did you ever hear this quote brother said sometimes you need a four-hour sermon to fatten you up you know what jesus brought us to the table today and we've been eating until i feel fat and i thank him for it god bless you so much it was not our desire to sound harsh [Music] mean spirited but listen to me children of god sometimes that's how the word comes up and makes a challenge to you to get you out of that complacency thank god he cares enough about me to shake me to my core if he needs to so you take what's been said now you apply it to your life and let this word change you from here on out let it change you let it bring a change amen will you do it put your hand up to the lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah let's sing together sing for us praise this holy his strength name perfect yes strength is gone he'll carry us when we [Music] oh they become strong his strength is perfect this strength is perfect yes a man how many believers [Music] [Music] i love you friends i love you perfect his strength [Music] all i can say is that in some areas brother ben supersedes me [Music] i've washed dishes [Music] [Music] he's done far more than i know i can do it but you have to do what you got to do [Music] i might work with some trucks with the boys he's got girls i had girls but i never did that [Music] i know what y'all think about me when i say i wash dishes now you got somebody that's super sick god is so good to us i learned so much today [Music] [Music] i know some i don't know what you're thinking but you had to stay in the spirit to understand what he was trying to get over to you and if you were in the spirit of god you got it but if you were not you'll walk out here being critical she knows now i know how long i can preach [Music] but you may be seated for just a moment just a moment i'm not going to take you too much of your time we have our brother uh samuel chaser [Music] god's grace [Music] but god [Music] [Music] uh [Music] because he's done so [Music] i don't know what his dad was like but i do want to say i know his dad did a great job and i know that if his father was here [Music] i often think about the time my mom [Music] very difficult [Music] is even as with brother frank remember what a friend i know frank talked about leaving one time i'm like no you're dumb [Music] and so is it with brother samuel he's god has [Music] amen amen i have been i've been blessed by singing blessed by sean and we want samuel to turn around so the camera can get you [Music] especially around the message [Music] we're gonna ask that everybody stand up [Music] keep him [Music] [Music] come before you in strengthened precious name we thank you right now for our brother we thank you for the ministries that you have given unto us and pray right now that you bless them strength may he always protect him lord [Music] as we ordain him give him [Music] we appreciate our brother [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] i could be hard sometimes especially [Music] because brother branham said you can see the condition of the church [Music] [Music] this morning as well and i know i know that all all especially young girls you want to look pretty [Music] look as pretty as you possibly can but keep it holy man god this will happen just keep it godly keep it holy and god will continue to bless you brothers likewise you know what you need to do amen you don't have to look like somebody drug you off the street that's that's not holiness [Music] and always know that however you dress [Music] you love the lord [Music] we're going to give our brother samuel a moment if you want to say something if not we'll just go on with the service let him come sing a song so it will be dismissed i know i know some of you tired and i appreciate every one of you who stayed [Music] he perfect when all strength is gone he'll carry us [Music] is [Music] power [Music] is [Music] [Music] so that we don't have unnecessary stuff flying around and if it's not yours and you just leave it after some time we'll have to take it to goodwill [Music] and in addition to that to that we [Music] so if there was anything that's personal views in the refrigerator please take it with you [Music] [Music] do take water [Music] please don't leave the half bottles laying around or in the refrigerator okay man so that we just keep our church in a good state amen let us sing the steadfast love of the lord never ceases as we get dismissed [Music] steadfast sees his mercies [Music] are new every morning every morning [Music] also i forgot to mention about the collection of the love offering if you forgot there's still baskets that are out there in the festival so if you forgot just drop it in the amen [Music] is [Music] great is thy faithfulness [Music] [Applause] of the lord [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] every morning [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
