[38:02] through to not only express our love to
[38:06] the
[38:08] Lord by being obedient to his
[38:11] word but we're here to
[38:14] manifest In the
[38:16] Flesh what it means to have
[38:21] mercy what it means to have
[38:24] Grace what it means to have love
[38:28] and all of these things that we uh do
[38:32] have are not things that you can touch
[38:35] or
[38:37] feel but the greatest of all
[38:40] blessings are the spiritual
[38:43] blessings there are certain types of
[38:47] blessings you have the spiritual
[38:50] blessings the material and financial
[38:54] blessings the undeserved blessings
[38:59] and the
[39:01] unsolicited
[39:03] blessings either way you look at
[39:06] it they are all
[39:09] blessings but
[39:11] personally if I had a choice between the
[39:16] four I would choose God's spiritual
[39:23] blessing because to me the spiritual
[39:26] blessing supersedes the
[39:32] natural the Bible said you can gain the
[39:34] whole
[39:36] world and lose your
[39:38] soul but when your soul has been
[39:42] quickened it really doesn't matter
[39:44] whether you gain the world or
[39:49] not because the blessings of your
[39:52] soul they are
[39:55] Eternal no wonder the uh scripture
[39:59] says oh give thanks unto the
[40:04] Lord for he is
[40:06] good for his Mercy endures
[40:10] forever David picks it
[40:12] up and said his Mercy endure to all
[40:18] generations and I'm glad tonight to know
[40:21] that his Mercy didn't run out with me
[40:30] But realize
[40:32] tonight there's a reason why his Mercy
[40:35] finds
[40:37] you there's a reason why his grace finds
[40:42] you the Bible said he died for the whole
[40:46] world but even as the prophet of God
[40:49] saids God knew that the whole world
[40:52] wouldn't receive
[40:54] him but there is a seed
[40:58] that God ordained before the foundation
[41:01] of the
[41:03] world that will receive him with
[41:07] joy is that right it's not a seed that
[41:11] you can be educated
[41:15] into or promoted by a
[41:23] man but it's something that God gave us
[41:28] before we even knew
[41:30] him is that all right when God chose
[41:35] Abraham we all know that the story about
[41:39] that
[41:40] Abraham was from the land of the
[41:43] Chalan he was he was he was
[41:47] Babylonian a country that was full of
[41:51] idols and and full of
[41:54] sin God didn't call Abraham because he
[41:56] was right
[41:59] righteous but God called
[42:02] Abraham to show Abraham his mercy and
[42:04] his
[42:07] grace Abraham didn't even know
[42:11] God but in Abraham's
[42:14] Journey he came to trust and believe in
[42:19] God think about this now Abraham for
[42:24] years followed God
[42:28] and all he had was his
[42:30] voice he had never seen
[42:33] him but he knew that the voice he heard
[42:36] was
[42:38] God so is it with Abraham
[42:41] SE we know that the voice that we hear
[42:45] is from
[42:46] God hallelujah we have heard many
[42:50] voices uh but when God called
[42:54] us even though we had not yet seen him
[42:58] we know the voice of
[43:00] God the Bible says that my sheep heareth
[43:04] my voice and a stranger there will not
[43:08] follow but when God blessed
[43:12] Abraham he blessed
[43:15] Moses he blessed
[43:17] David he blessed every seed that was in
[43:22] Abraham y understand me this is why God
[43:25] calls him the father of many
[43:29] nations
[43:31] Hallelujah and the Abraham
[43:34] seed is a seed of
[43:37] blessing not a seed of
[43:39] cursing a seed of
[43:42] blessing Hallelujah and if God has
[43:45] blessed
[43:46] you no man can curse
[43:49] you hallelujah hallelujah Deuteronomy 33
[43:53] and
[43:55] 1 we find out that
[43:58] Moses blessed the children of Israel
[44:01] before his
[44:03] death now I'm not going to go through
[44:05] all of the
[44:08] blessings but I want you to read that on
[44:11] your
[44:12] own to see how God blessed the
[44:15] children of Israel through
[44:18] Moses Hallelujah you see Moses couldn't
[44:21] help but to give out
[44:26] blessings to his
[44:28] children because he himself was a
[44:32] blessing and tonight you're
[44:36] blessing I'm not talking about your
[44:39] flesh I'm talking about in your
[44:41] soul you are a
[44:44] blessing never forget that because Satan
[44:48] will make you feel like you
[44:52] cursed and nothing can curse
[44:55] you we can go back we can go all the way
[44:57] to the
[44:59] end where Jesus said blessed is the man
[45:01] who readed the
[45:05] book and blessed is the man who hears
[45:07] the sayings of this
[45:11] book you're blessed in the alpha and
[45:15] you're blessed in the
[45:16] Omega Hallelujah hallelu and realize no
[45:20] weapon as we often say formed against
[45:23] you shall
[45:25] prosper but you you got to believe who
[45:27] you
[45:28] are you got to understand who you
[45:32] are and even even your
[45:36] identity must be a
[45:39] revelation hallelujah hallelujah it's
[45:41] not because you're born in a preachers
[45:45] family or some saint that that that
[45:48] that's been in church for
[45:51] years you're blessed because you can
[45:54] hear the
[45:55] voice of
[45:57] God is that right see if you're not a
[46:01] god you may hear
[46:04] sounds but you'll never hear his
[46:07] voice because Jesus says my sheep
[46:11] heareth my
[46:13] voice that's one of the
[46:16] blessings of the seed Hallelujah that
[46:20] God implanted in
[46:22] you is that right before the foundation
[46:26] of the world
[46:27] brother brandham said it like this he
[46:30] said even when you was a
[46:32] sinner you knew you were
[46:35] different Hallelujah he said something
[46:38] pulled on
[46:40] you even then when your friends could do
[46:44] evil
[46:46] things God wouldn't let you go but so
[46:51] far you you felt that there were you
[46:54] were
[46:55] different and and because of this
[46:58] feeling you became the black sheep of
[47:01] the
[47:04] family that's the truth and then the
[47:08] world didn't want you Hallelujah you
[47:10] just didn't know where you
[47:13] fit as brother Adam said it like this
[47:16] you was a chicken in an eagle you know
[47:18] you was an eagle in a chicken
[47:20] yard Hallelujah the the the the way the
[47:24] things were
[47:25] there the way things were
[47:28] there is what made you thirst for
[47:30] something
[47:32] else
[47:34] Hallelujah you were a
[47:38] misfit an
[47:42] eyeball but God had his hand on you all
[47:48] alone Hallelujah I'm going say it like
[47:51] this and I love this scripture now I'm
[47:53] falling in love with it
[47:57] the table is prepared before me in the
[48:00] presence of my enemies and thou anointed
[48:03] my head with
[48:04] oil when I when I see that when I see
[48:09] that my whole life has been
[48:11] prepared from from the time of my
[48:15] birth until the time that I either die
[48:18] or or
[48:20] Rapture God has already laid it
[48:24] out let me show you this none of you
[48:28] knew that one day you was going to be in
[48:33] Iowa Hallelujah not even
[48:36] me I I was born in South
[48:39] Carolina God took me from South Carolina
[48:42] to
[48:44] Ohio he had to climatize
[48:48] me and he moved me from Ohio to
[48:52] Iowa this is no
[48:55] coincidence Hallelujah everything is
[48:57] moving by the power of
[48:59] God hallelujah God could have brought
[49:02] some of you and taken you
[49:05] anywhere but he brought you
[49:08] here and if he brought you here there is
[49:12] truly a Divine Purpose for
[49:14] it Hallelujah you don't fight the hand
[49:18] of
[49:19] God you move with God and you said
[49:23] nevertheless Lord not my
[49:25] will but thine be
[49:27] done hallelujah hallelujah this is
[49:31] revelation and you and I must
[49:34] understand in order for us to move
[49:37] forward we must we must know who we are
[49:41] and what God has called us to
[49:43] do
[49:45] Hallelujah God didn't call us to be
[49:47] church
[49:49] members God called us to be his
[49:53] body that's the difference now God
[49:56] didn't called you to be a message
[50:00] believer but he called you to be a
[50:02] message
[50:05] receiver Hallelujah huj because even the
[50:08] devil believes the
[50:10] message but he can't receive the
[50:13] message and you know what the message
[50:15] really is in in in a
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] nutshell Jesus Christ is same yesterday
[50:24] today and forever hallelujah hallelujah
[50:27] that is the message in a
[50:30] nutshell Hallelujah is that all right
[50:33] God come to restore
[50:35] us will he do it he's already done it
[50:40] but we're just in the
[50:42] process is that right you say well wait
[50:45] a minute now God called Abraham a father
[50:49] of Nations when he didn't even have a
[50:54] son hallelujah hallelujah but he had to
[50:56] go go through the
[50:58] process time was on his side y'all hear
[51:02] me time was on his side he he wasn't in
[51:06] a
[51:06] hurry Hallelujah you can't get in a
[51:09] hurry you got to move by God's
[51:12] timing Hallelujah but know for
[51:16] certain you are
[51:19] blessed God blessed you and when God
[51:22] blesses you no man can curse you
[51:25] Hallelujah but we need to learn how to
[51:29] take on the
[51:30] trials that God places on
[51:34] us with
[51:37] Thanksgiving Hallelujah I'll say that
[51:40] again we must learn how to take on the
[51:45] trials and tests that God gives us with
[51:51] Thanksgiving is that the word the Bible
[51:54] said in all things give
[51:57] so you you you can't exclude
[52:01] some you got to take it all is that the
[52:04] truth when we took on this
[52:07] message the scroll was
[52:12] bitter and it was
[52:15] sweet when you take on this
[52:18] message you're going to experience the
[52:20] good
[52:21] times you're going to experience the bad
[52:24] times Hallelujah but in all these things
[52:29] we must give
[52:32] thanks
[52:35] Hallelujah St John
[52:39] 17
[52:42] 9-2 blessings
[52:45] blessings the blessings that you
[52:47] now have upon
[52:50] you didn't even start when you was a
[52:53] Christian it started before you was a
[52:56] Christian
[52:59] is that right and God protected you all
[53:03] of these
[53:04] years Moses didn't even know who he
[53:07] was he didn't even know he was a proper
[53:10] child when he was
[53:12] born Hallelujah but God had Angels
[53:15] protecting
[53:18] Moses because that seed was
[53:21] blessed and that seed had a purpose
[53:25] Hallelujah so is with you
[53:27] you can't even die until God has
[53:31] finished his purpose with

[54:09] darkness when that light is cut
[54:12] on the darkness must back
[54:15] up Hallelujah and no matter how
[54:18] condensed the darkness
[54:21] is you still be able to see that light
[54:26] Hallelujah from a
[54:31] distance hallelujah hallelujah St John
[54:36] 17 ain't that
[54:38] amazing Jesus said he was the light of
[54:41] the
[54:43] world and then he said we are the lights
[54:46] of the
[54:48] world a city that cannot be

[55:31] God y'all hear me that's where we
[55:35] falter we let the devil take our
[55:39] joy when in
[55:41] reality if we look at what God is doing

[55:49] him you understand me something need to
[55:54] click God is in control

[56:00] through this test is for
[56:03] me hallelujah hallelujah and I'm going
[56:05] to praise him I'm going to worship him
[56:09] I'm going to let the devil

[56:20] Jesus is
[56:21] praying he said I pray for
[56:24] them I pray not for the word
[56:27] but for them which thou has given
[56:30] me for they are
[56:33] thine and all mine are
[56:36] thine thine are mine and I am glorified
[56:41] in them y understand me he said father

[57:19] this come by yielding to the Holy
[57:22] Ghost to the Holy
[57:25] Ghost this is this is something we
[57:27] learned to
[57:29] do Hallelujah you understand
[57:31] me I'm
[57:33] sure Peter James and John had a moment
[57:36] to
[57:37] think you know devil is saying you're
[57:39] going to be wiped
[57:41] out you're going to die they going to
[57:44] kill
[57:45] you and no doubt they says so
[57:50] what so what whatever comes I'm going to
[57:54] praise him
[57:58] I'm telling you when you learn how to
[58:01] praise God under all
[58:04] circumstances Hallelujah that's is where
[58:07] your reward comes in Hallelujah that's
[58:11] when it says trust the Lord with all
[58:14] your heart and lean not to your own
[58:17] understanding acknowledge the
[58:22] Lord in all your
[58:24] ways and he shall direct your
[58:28] path hallelujah hallelujah
[58:31] right all of mine are
[58:35] thine thine are
[58:37] mine and I am glorified in
[58:40] them and now I am no more in the
[58:44] world but these are in the world and I
[58:48] come to thee Holy Father keep through
[58:52] thine own
[58:53] name Those whom thou has given
[58:57] me that they may be one as we are
[59:03] one can I say this and I have been
[59:07] guilty but you've never seen Jesus in a
[59:10] sad
[59:15] continent I don't think he was smiling
[59:18] when he was going to
[59:20] Calvary but he had a seriousness on his
[59:24] face he had a Purp purp and his whole
[59:27] mind and thought was to fulfill that
[59:34] purpose did he have a sad
[59:37] moment in the garden he
[59:39] did but there was nobody there to
[59:42] witness
[59:44] it because everybody that would have
[59:46] seen him in that
[59:49] condition fell
[59:52] asleep Hallelujah even as a man he had
[59:56] to suffer and I want you to hear what
[59:58] I'm
[59:59] saying but he wasn't a
[1:00:02] seed he was
[1:00:05] dced and if dced went through those
[1:00:09] trials Hallelujah the Bible said he set
[1:00:12] his face like a
[1:00:18] flint like a
[1:00:23] flint down
[1:00:27] and he and he and he and he and he and
[1:00:29] he went to
[1:00:31] Calvary with a
[1:00:33] joy to
[1:00:35] know that he was getting ready to defeat
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:40] Devil and all that Satan had and all
[1:00:43] that Satan had
[1:00:45] won he was going to gain
[1:00:48] back he come to
[1:00:51] restore and he took his life to restore
[1:00:56] so let me stop right here if God is
[1:01:00] restoring and he is then what is he
[1:01:03] restoring in
[1:01:05] you Hallelujah we are supposed to be the
[1:01:11] expression of the
[1:01:13] restoration of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:01:17] hallelujah we are to
[1:01:18] be the the the the
[1:01:21] restoration the
[1:01:23] manifestation of the restoration
[1:01:27] Hallelujah that he promised that he
[1:01:29] would
[1:01:30] do and if he's doing it see what it is
[1:01:35] we we don't see the great signs and
[1:01:38] wonders like we
[1:01:40] should and like we
[1:01:43] would if we had the
[1:01:48] character you understand me
[1:01:53] because how does he say it
[1:01:57] uh without character if you if you're
[1:01:59] going to do all the Supernatural and
[1:02:01] stuff without character he said that's
[1:02:06] satanic and we don't need
[1:02:08] that if anything be done let it be Jesus
[1:02:13] Christ doing it through
[1:02:15] us hallelujah is that all right but
[1:02:18] we're bless seed I want you to
[1:02:21] understand that Hallelujah glory to God
[1:02:25] I would they be one that that's powerful
[1:02:28] to
[1:02:29] me that is powerful to me because Jesus
[1:02:33] said that in in John
[1:02:38] 10:30 that he and the father was one I
[1:02:42] and the father are one and God's whole
[1:02:47] purpose in our day is to take a
[1:02:50] bride and make her
[1:02:52] one now what we need to understand we
[1:02:56] already won by the
[1:02:59] seed and brother B said everything
[1:03:01] that's in we've got what it takes to
[1:03:04] make a Rapture already in the
[1:03:08] sea but we but we must learn how to
[1:03:12] yield to our conditions not to fight the
[1:03:15] conditions but yield to them yield to
[1:03:19] the pressure because the pressure brings
[1:03:21] out the quality of of what's in
[1:03:24] you Hallelujah
[1:03:27] you don't become a loser Hallelujah when
[1:03:30] you're under
[1:03:31] pressure but know that that pressure is
[1:03:35] placed there to bring the virtues
[1:03:37] out right if they L had to be
[1:03:44] squeezed to bring out the O uh
[1:03:49] opium what about
[1:03:52] us he said while I was with them in the
[1:03:54] world
[1:03:56] I kept them in their
[1:03:58] name those that thou gave
[1:04:01] me I have
[1:04:03] kept wait a minute
[1:04:05] then was he just talking about the
[1:04:09] disciples but those that you have given
[1:04:12] me I have kept that means he kept
[1:04:17] me he kept you we we didn't keep
[1:04:20] ourselves he kept
[1:04:23] us and none of them is what
[1:04:27] lost but the son of predition that the
[1:04:30] scriptures might be filled fulfilled
[1:04:33] excuse me is that right so Moses blesses
[1:04:36] his
[1:04:38] people and every Prophet usually blesses
[1:04:41] or
[1:04:47] curses Jeremiah had a special
[1:04:53] calling and so did Malachi for
[1:04:57] cuz Malachi 4 comes with blessings and
[1:05:02] curses Hallelujah but in when it when
[1:05:05] when it comes to the seed of
[1:05:09] God Moses blessed the Seed of
[1:05:13] Abraham and the prophet of God showed
[1:05:16] us that the Seed of Abraham in this
[1:05:19] day are those who are filled with the
[1:05:22] Holy
[1:05:23] Ghost and receive the message for their
[1:05:26] day Hallelujah is that right the lord
[1:05:30] gave brother brandham the king's
[1:05:33] sword Hallelujah nowhere else in the
[1:05:37] scripture has we seen the king
[1:05:40] Soul Hallelujah huj I just know that
[1:05:43] when
[1:05:45] Joshua met the
[1:05:47] angel he had a
[1:05:49] sword that's the only one I know of but
[1:05:52] I know that this William brandom
[1:05:56] whatever happened to that
[1:05:58] sword ended up in the hands of brother

[1:06:04] just had his own
[1:06:06] sword hallelujah or the angel that went
[1:06:09] that Joshua saw had his own
[1:06:13] sword but
[1:06:15] Joshua knew his
[1:06:17] calling come on somebody now if you had
[1:06:20] seen an
[1:06:22] angel more than likely you faint
[1:06:26] but Joshua knew his
[1:06:28] commission he was a
[1:06:30] warrior and he said who side are you
[1:06:33] on he is talking to an angel who side
[1:06:37] are you

[1:06:41] challenge come on somebody see when you
[1:06:45] realize who you are and you know the
[1:06:48] commission that you are that you have
[1:06:51] then you know that no weapon I go back
[1:06:54] to you Hallelujah No Angel no
[1:06:58] principality nothing as as as as as Paul
[1:07:02] says can separate us from the love of
[1:07:05] God and we must understand that if we're
[1:07:09] in the Capstone if we're in The
[1:07:11] Headstone we are in the love of God and
[1:07:14] nothing can stop that protection you are
[1:07:18] protected by the love of
[1:07:21] God hallelujah hallelujah that's your
[1:07:24] blessing
[1:07:26] hallelujah hallelujah is that right when
[1:07:28] Abraham went down to
[1:07:31] Egypt and that that King wanted
[1:07:35] Sarah and Abraham lied about it
[1:07:39] Hallelujah but now God had protect
[1:07:43] Abraham he had to protect Sarah
[1:07:46] Hallelujah because Abraham got himself
[1:07:49] in a
[1:07:51] mess he didn't know how to get out of it
[1:07:55] God had to intervene Hallelujah and when
[1:07:59] you find yourself in a mess you don't
[1:08:01] know how to get out of it God will
[1:08:05] intervene because you are
[1:08:07] blessed you are blessed you are the
[1:08:11] bless Seed of
[1:08:12] Abraham let's put it like this you are
[1:08:15] the Blessed seed of Jesus
[1:08:17] Christ Hallelujah he didn't have
[1:08:21] children in the natural Hallelujah but
[1:08:23] he produced children in the spirit
[1:08:26] glory to God hallelujah glory to God and
[1:08:31] you are
[1:08:32] protected because you are his
[1:08:37] inheritance the word had been given to
[1:08:39] the
[1:08:40] bride this word has been given to the
[1:08:43] bride the king sword the word right the
[1:08:47] revelation of the word yeah what would
[1:08:49] brother brandham do with a
[1:08:51] sword if he couldn't use it but but he
[1:08:55] had to pass it on it's the revelation of
[1:08:57] this
[1:08:58] message it is the sword that destroys
[1:09:01] the work of the devil hallelujah amen
[1:09:05] this is the word of
[1:09:07] Revelation is that right because this
[1:09:10] sword was the same uh how can I say it
[1:09:13] when it came to the Seven Seals and the
[1:09:14] Seven
[1:09:16] Thunders this was the king
[1:09:18] sword this is the word from the King
[1:09:22] Hallelujah and it was given to him in
[1:09:24] the form a book Hallelujah is that right
[1:09:28] the Bible is a sword it is God is that
[1:09:33] right that's the word of God it's
[1:09:36] sharper than the two-edged
[1:09:38] sword Hallelujah only one
[1:09:41] sword only one sword which is the king
[1:09:44] sword that can divide the soul and the
[1:09:47] spirit Hallelujah so it is the word of
[1:09:51] God which is the king
[1:09:53] sword that's not now in your mouth
[1:09:57] that's now in your heart but you must
[1:10:00] learn how to yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:10:03] Hallelujah because the king sword is
[1:10:06] only used by the
[1:10:08] king but through
[1:10:12] you is that right that same King
[1:10:16] sword you understand what I'm saying
[1:10:19] it's not only just to destroy or kill it
[1:10:21] gives
[1:10:22] life the word of L God gives life
[1:10:26] how can I say it do you think God just
[1:10:30] just made brother bandam just an
[1:10:33] example that we can just look
[1:10:36] at Hallelujah no no no no no no even
[1:10:39] when it comes to
[1:10:42] animals when they when they're training
[1:10:45] they're
[1:10:47] young they put them in
[1:10:50] positions and basically show them how
[1:10:52] they would behave in that
[1:10:54] position
[1:10:55] huah and that's what brother B was doing
[1:10:59] God was using him to show
[1:11:03] us the things that
[1:11:05] denominations don't know they can do
[1:11:08] Hallelujah we know that we have the
[1:11:11] ability to
[1:11:12] create not of not of our own
[1:11:16] accord but we know if God say say
[1:11:19] it we must say it Hallelujah the
[1:11:23] inspiration of this message
[1:11:26] Hallelujah as I said it places
[1:11:29] us back in Genesis
[1:11:34] 126
[1:11:36] 126 Hallelujah huj have
[1:11:39] dominion over the cattle Over the Sea
[1:11:44] over all the creeping things is that
[1:11:46] right brother spoke to the bull
[1:11:49] Hallelujah the bull had to obey he spoke
[1:11:52] to the bees the bees had to obey yall
[1:11:56] understand me he was a true Son of God
[1:12:00] that had come to a maturity Hallelujah
[1:12:03] waved over the
[1:12:06] people so that you and I must know this
[1:12:09] is where God wants us to be Hallelujah
[1:12:13] but just as God said to uh brother
[1:12:15] Brandon you got to you've got to be more
[1:12:20] mature you got to be more
[1:12:23] consecrated you can't play with the
[1:12:26] and expect God to use you Hallelujah and
[1:12:29] the even in the message the prophet
[1:12:32] tells us that we must have a total
[1:12:35] separation from all
[1:12:37] unbelief Hallelujah it is De God will
[1:12:42] use us in a great
[1:12:45] magnitude but it will never be an open
[1:12:51] show this is the word of Revelation that
[1:12:54] would give us the give the bride the
[1:12:56] victory in the love
[1:12:58] divine what are you talking about it was
[1:13:01] love that conquered the
[1:13:03] bull it was love that conquered the
[1:13:06] bees Hallelujah yall understand me that
[1:13:09] love must conquer everything for you
[1:13:12] Hallelujah this is the this is the
[1:13:14] headship this is the head stone
[1:13:17] Revelation that Love Will Conquer
[1:13:20] All Hallelujah right so just like I said
[1:13:26] even in the message Shalom paragraph
[1:13:30] 105 and brother said and we see in the
[1:13:33] midst of all of
[1:13:35] that the Glorious Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ promised for this day manifested
[1:13:45] itself and what he's
[1:13:47] saying is that God has manifested
[1:13:49] himself through all the
[1:13:52] ages but now through his ministry
[1:13:55] we can see that God has
[1:13:59] manifested manifesting
[1:14:01] himself through a son of man which which
[1:14:05] he promised would come before the coming
[1:14:08] of the Lord hallelujah he said now we're
[1:14:11] Witnesses of
[1:14:13] that Abraham's seed will always be able
[1:14:16] to hear the
[1:14:18] voice whatever
[1:14:21] Voice Hallelujah yeah I was thinking the
[1:14:24] other day just just Reminiscing on the
[1:14:30] Rapture and how brother brandham said
[1:14:33] this is so powerful to me I don't know
[1:14:35] that he said each
[1:14:38] angel will come
[1:14:40] up with his
[1:14:44] people hallelujah and I was just
[1:14:46] thinking the other day and I said you
[1:14:49] know it's so
[1:14:50] amazing that even though the graves were
[1:14:53] open they couldn't move move until Jesus
[1:14:57] moved those that were in the
[1:14:59] grave couldn't get up until Jesus got up
[1:15:05] y'all hear
[1:15:06] me and just like brother bam asked the
[1:15:10] angel will Paul have to answer for
[1:15:14] his and he and he said yes he said
[1:15:18] because I preached exactly what Paul
[1:15:21] preached you understand me so the
[1:15:25] Resurrection will be a resurrection of
[1:15:29] order hallelujah hallelujah and every
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:35] Angel the very
[1:15:39] voice that
[1:15:41] call oh my God I'm just feeling real
[1:15:44] good right now but my point
[1:15:48] is there's coming a
[1:15:51] resurrection and we'll understand why
[1:15:54] this voice
[1:15:56] was so important to
[1:15:59] us hallelujah let me move on we're
[1:16:03] living in a wonderful
[1:16:05] time I didn't even tell you half of what
[1:16:07] I was thinking but
[1:16:09] shalom shalom to you who have word word
[1:16:12] down in your
[1:16:16] heart chose before the foundation of the
[1:16:20] world to hear the word for this day
[1:16:27] I'm just feeling
[1:16:29] good see what it's in your heart you
[1:16:34] were
[1:16:35] chosen to hear the word for this
[1:16:39] day you you've heard what I said
[1:16:41] before Billy couldn't satisfy you or
[1:16:45] robers couldn't satisfy you none of the
[1:16:48] preachers of this day I mean you play a
[1:16:51] tape and none of them can compare
[1:16:56] it does something on the inside of the
[1:17:00] inside and it's
[1:17:02] uncontrollable how many times you
[1:17:04] listened to a tape and a revelation
[1:17:07] strike you and now now now you're
[1:17:10] weeping for the before the Lord there's
[1:17:12] such a joy and it's just you and God
[1:17:16] yeah oh I can't explain it but my point
[1:17:19] is you could have never made yourself
[1:17:22] hear this
[1:17:27] and when people don't like his
[1:17:29] voice it's not the sound of it it's the
[1:17:34] spirit behind
[1:17:35] it is what aggravates them and they
[1:17:39] don't
[1:17:41] understand God placed it that that his
[1:17:45] voice behind brother Brandon's
[1:17:48] voice because he
[1:17:50] knew that only the Sheep would be able
[1:17:54] to listen listen to that
[1:17:58] voice right think about it a preacher
[1:18:02] with no
[1:18:05] style you know he ain't jumping and
[1:18:07] shouting and carrying on he's preaching
[1:18:10] a
[1:18:11] message and only the Sheep of God will
[1:18:15] be able to hear his
[1:18:17] voice Hallelujah that seed of
[1:18:21] blessing people say y'all crazy
[1:18:25] cult y'all y'all don't know what y'all
[1:18:27] talking about I had somebody say
[1:18:30] everything you
[1:18:31] believe is wrong and I'm saying to
[1:18:34] myself okay then what what is right then
[1:18:38] tell me what's right I'm saying that to
[1:18:41] myself now but you know people don't
[1:18:45] understand you can't help
[1:18:47] yourself I love that see cuz nothing can
[1:18:50] burn it out
[1:18:52] you they can cut your head off and you
[1:18:54] still have
[1:18:55] it they can boil you in oil and you
[1:18:58] can't you can't boil it
[1:19:00] out it's so connected because you and I
[1:19:03] have become one with
[1:19:06] it you understand what I'm saying and
[1:19:09] and and don't get me
[1:19:10] wrong I think a a Holiness man should
[1:19:13] live
[1:19:15] holy but God got you covered even if you
[1:19:18] make mistakes God got you covered
[1:19:21] because you're the seed hallelujah
[1:19:24] hallelujah is that right and
[1:19:26] Abraham was counted
[1:19:29] righteous because he believed God
[1:19:33] hallelujah is that right I heard
[1:19:35] something powerful maybe I should have
[1:19:38] known this all
[1:19:41] along brother B was talking about how
[1:19:44] Moses Beed the children up on of Israel
[1:19:46] up on E Eagle's
[1:19:50] Wings
[1:19:53] Hallelujah and thought about
[1:19:55] it and he said
[1:19:58] Moses was that
[1:20:00] eagle that bore the children on his
[1:20:05] wings y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:20:07] about that I'm saying if you just hold
[1:20:09] keep holding on to the feathers of the
[1:20:13] eagle y understand me he's the one that
[1:20:16] takes
[1:20:17] us
[1:20:20] in I'm just
[1:20:21] saying I'm just saying when I heard dead
[1:20:24] I'm
[1:20:28] like and was not brother bam an eagle
[1:20:31] that's all I'm
[1:20:33] saying we hold fast hold fast hold fast
[1:20:37] we it's just a little while
[1:20:46] longer Hallelujah is that all right you
[1:20:49] said well wait a minute brother but it
[1:20:52] was Mo it was God in Moses
[1:20:55] was Moses was a man Moses made mistakes
[1:20:58] he got mad he got angry Hallelujah is
[1:21:01] that right Elijah got mad he got angry
[1:21:06] and brother bam said when he called
[1:21:08] those Bears to eat those kids he said
[1:21:09] that was not the
[1:21:13] Lord hallelujah what about when he said
[1:21:16] Let the Fire Fall he said that wasn't
[1:21:18] the Lord but because he was a prophet
[1:21:21] God had to honor
[1:21:22] him Hallelujah hallelujah it's a bad
[1:21:25] year for you
[1:21:28] ahead let me let me back it up Shalom to
[1:21:31] you who have have word down in your

[1:21:59] Years
[1:22:01] Hallelujah now I'm going come down to a
[1:22:03] personal
[1:22:07] thing and I think what we need to do as
[1:22:10] individuals
[1:22:12] because we we get we get thrown off by
[1:22:16] church people everybody that comes here
[1:22:19] is not you know I
[1:22:20] mean and I I believe I would love to
[1:22:23] think that all of us are bride
[1:22:26] so we have three kinds of Believers
[1:22:27] right I believe that I don't have to
[1:22:30] believe it I see it with my own
[1:22:33] eyes brother B says now listen now
[1:22:36] closely listen still coming from the
[1:22:38] message Lord one paragra 110 do as David
[1:22:43] did put your future in his
[1:22:47] hands he says
[1:22:49] how what am I to know what to do
[1:22:56] brother Bram put your future in his
[1:23:00] hand no matter what comes or
[1:23:03] goes there you go trust him he is the
[1:23:07] word now know David said he his time is
[1:23:13] in my
[1:23:14] hand trust in him all the
[1:23:18] time always trust in
[1:23:20] him he knew who hell he knew who who
[1:23:25] held the
[1:23:27] future David did that's the reason he
[1:23:30] could say
[1:23:31] this there is only one holds there is
[1:23:35] only one holds the
[1:23:37] future and that's God he holds the
[1:23:41] future let him hold
[1:23:43] you all right is that all right amen
[1:23:48] amen let's go to uh Psalms 22 1-8
[1:23:58] Psalm 62
[1:24:06] 1-8 God is good to
[1:24:09] us I might be getting off the rock a
[1:24:11] little
[1:24:12] bit but that was show of
[1:24:16] good I remember a dream I had when I was
[1:24:19] just a young fellow
[1:24:24] and in this dream I saw the Lord
[1:24:28] Jesus and the Rapture had taken
[1:24:32] place or or say it was in
[1:24:35] progress and I was standing inside the
[1:24:39] gate and Jesus was ahead of
[1:24:42] me and all these people came after
[1:24:46] me I can't even
[1:24:50] remember uh I just say it like this
[1:24:55] the people was over every nation seemly
[1:24:59] different nationalities I do know
[1:25:01] that and here I was as a boy I was
[1:25:03] playing this tamarine with seven
[1:25:07] tassels and these tassels were of Many
[1:25:11] Colors and as I was playing the
[1:25:14] tambourine that's why I play a tamarine
[1:25:17] now I didn't even know what a tamarine
[1:25:20] was and I played that tamarine because a
[1:25:24] vision or a dream it was a dream I
[1:25:28] had and as they came
[1:25:32] in I saw the gate
[1:25:36] closed and I was
[1:25:38] terrified because I didn't know the word
[1:25:42] but I stood there and I said oh I was
[1:25:46] thinking to myself he's not going to let
[1:25:48] me through or by him or in I forgot how
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:52] was but the moment I said
[1:25:55] that Jesus something snatched me and the
[1:26:00] next thing I know quickened me I was in
[1:26:03] front of Jesus
[1:26:04] Christ and he lifted me up in the air
[1:26:08] and he kissed me on my lips like a man
[1:26:10] with a
[1:26:15] woman and I woke up screaming and
[1:26:18] holling now I I had never experienced
[1:26:21] the Holy Spirit like that
[1:26:25] and at that point in time I didn't even
[1:26:26] know I was a
[1:26:28] Christian but I I I ran into my mother's
[1:26:31] room and I was screaming and holling
[1:26:34] telling her I saw Jesus and and and I'm
[1:26:37] going tell you that that he looked more
[1:26:39] like this that's why I knew that what
[1:26:43] all the other things I was seeing was
[1:26:44] not
[1:26:47] him my my mother got up after she
[1:26:50] settled down uh she said praise the Lord
[1:26:55] the Lord has called my son to
[1:26:58] preach that was the worst thing she
[1:27:00] could have ever said to me I never
[1:27:03] wanted to be a
[1:27:04] preacher and I walked out of my mother's
[1:27:06] room
[1:27:07] thinking I'll never go back to
[1:27:10] church because I do not want to be
[1:27:12] nobody's
[1:27:14] preacher well as you can see how well
[1:27:16] that
[1:27:18] works but I ran from God from that
[1:27:22] moment on I ran from God I didn't want
[1:27:25] to go to
[1:27:29] church uh anything like that and boy did
[1:27:33] I get a
[1:27:37] spanking by the
[1:27:40] time I by the time God finished with
[1:27:47] me I said Lord wherever you want me to
[1:27:50] go whatever you want me to
[1:27:51] do I'll do it
[1:27:55] I'm just saying these things I'm not I'm
[1:27:58] not trying to promote
[1:28:00] anything other than I know what brother
[1:28:02] Bram
[1:28:04] said about every leader has to give an
[1:28:06] account for the people for his
[1:28:12] people I didn't know that
[1:28:15] then but I know it now and I I I I tried
[1:28:19] to say something but he wouldn't let me
[1:28:21] say what I was what I'm looking at but I
[1:28:25] I'll tell you this it's closer than what
[1:28:28] we
[1:28:29] think and if you don't understand
[1:28:33] Grace you you you you might might miss
[1:28:37] it CU Satan is going to have you looking
[1:28:41] at your
[1:28:43] works and I'll tell you if that's what
[1:28:45] you're doing you need to go listen to

[1:31:25] right coming from the message Shalom
[1:31:30] 219 brother said how will people know
[1:31:33] Jesus
[1:31:35] Christ when they he sees him in
[1:31:42] you when they see Jesus in
[1:31:45] you for he says the works that I do
[1:31:48] shall you do
[1:31:50] also greater than this shall you do
[1:31:54] because I go to my father is that right
[1:31:58] that's how the world will
[1:32:01] know
[1:32:03] Hallelujah I'm going to shorten it I'm
[1:32:11] sorry you know I heard him say this
[1:32:15] today because i' I've myself have said
[1:32:19] this when God said Greater Works you
[1:32:21] shall do
[1:32:24] I said
[1:32:26] more but I was
[1:32:28] corrected on a message today when
[1:32:31] brother Bram
[1:32:32] said the Greater
[1:32:35] Works was more in the
[1:32:39] sense he
[1:32:42] created
[1:32:44] squirrels Hallelujah hallu
[1:32:48] Jesus was able to turn water into wine
[1:32:51] but he had
[1:32:52] something work
[1:32:57] with he multiplied the
[1:32:59] bread but he had substance to work
[1:33:04] with but in his this day he did
[1:33:07] something
[1:33:09] greater he created squirrels when there
[1:33:11] weren't no
[1:33:15] squirrels Hallelujah you see it was the
[1:33:18] same
[1:33:19] Jesus but the works became greater
[1:33:24] because the creation ability came back
[1:33:26] to the sun
[1:33:30] of is that right so
[1:33:35] understand he was able uh to do things
[1:33:39] that Jesus specifically did in this
[1:33:42] day and put it on record we're not
[1:33:45] saying he did do it but he promised that
[1:33:48] the works will be
[1:33:51] greater Hallelujah so that that really
[1:33:54] open my
[1:33:55] heart my mind in a way that I had never
[1:33:58] seen
[1:34:00] before CU often time we
[1:34:03] think that we need something a
[1:34:08] substance or we needed a commandment
[1:34:10] from
[1:34:12] God you can't do that on your own but
[1:34:15] when God speaks
[1:34:17] it he's saying you can do something
[1:34:21] greater you love the Lord amen he says
[1:34:25] now we see his word
[1:34:28] Vindicated we believe so if he
[1:34:31] Vindicated the word of
[1:34:35] today what is it what do I care about
[1:34:38] what the year
[1:34:43] brings what do I what do I care about
[1:34:46] the next
[1:34:49] year what do I care whether I live today
[1:34:52] or die today
[1:34:58] every word that he promised will be
[1:35:02] Vindicated
[1:35:04] everyone if he abide if if he is able to
[1:35:08] do it
[1:35:10] today after promising it 2,000 years
[1:35:15] ago if he's a th 100,000 years
[1:35:22] today Jesus will return to the
[1:35:25] Earth in a in a visible body for the
[1:35:29] church a
[1:35:31] redeemed the bride and take her out of
[1:35:35] here regardless of what
[1:35:38] comes goes Fashions say go
[1:35:44] on and people can wait on in total
[1:35:49] darkness and believe anything they want
[1:35:52] to believe
[1:35:54] but Jesus Christ will return
[1:35:58] again and I'm closing with that I had
[1:36:00] other but I'm going to close there but
[1:36:03] but let me say this to you by the grace
[1:36:05] of
[1:36:07] God when it comes down to the end of the
[1:36:12] road you're going to have to trust
[1:36:16] him with this last scripture
[1:36:20] Jude 22- 25

[1:36:29] God looking for the mercies of our Lord
[1:36:31] Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ unto eternal
[1:36:36] life and some have
[1:36:39] compassion making a
[1:36:47] difference and others say with fear
[1:36:53] pulling them out of the
[1:36:56] fire hating even the garments spotted by
[1:36:59] the
[1:37:02] flesh 23d
[1:37:15] verse now I'm going to read this last
[1:37:18] this verse 24 and I I trust that you

[1:37:41] savior be glory and
