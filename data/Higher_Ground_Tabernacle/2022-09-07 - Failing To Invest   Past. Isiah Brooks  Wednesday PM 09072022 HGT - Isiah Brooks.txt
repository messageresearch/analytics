to matthew 6 19 through 20. i trust you love the lord tonight he's worthy of all praise hallelujah you're there beloved i wish above all things that thou mayeth prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers matthew 6 19-20 lay not up yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust that corrupt where thieves break through and steal but lay up yourselves treasures in heaven where neither nor moth nor rust nor corrupt death corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal one more scripture philippians 3 we'll read the from the third chapter of philippians we'll read the 14 through the 16th verses and it reads i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if it any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal it even this unto you nevertheless where unto whereto we have already obtained let us walk by the same rule and let us mine the same things i'm going to read the same scripture philippians 3 14 through 16 by another version i want you to listen closely i will pursue as my goal the prize promised by god's heavenly call in christ jesus therefore let us us who are mature think this way and if you think differently about anything god will reveal this also to you in any case we should live up to whatever truth we have obtained i love that 16th verse in any case we should live up to whatever truth we have attained let us pray our gracious father god we thank you for your grace and your mercy lord we did not come here lord to be a pleaser of men but father god we've come oh god to hear from you and that we may speak whatever you would have us to speak forgive us for anything we may say oh lord that is not according to your will but i pray that you would give us grace to move completely out of your way that you would have full utterance here tonight we thank you lord jesus for your amazing grace because no man in himself is worthy to stand at this holy and sacred place but by your grace god and by your mercy you have a need to be here tonight and so therefore lord god we want to give our best our all our all to you and so therefore lord jesus have full course bless your people according to your divine will in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i'm sure that everybody here tonight understand investing because we all do it one way or another on a low level or a great level but when we invest we always put something in to get something more out of it that's why we teach our children how to read how to write how to do math and all these things because we invest in them we invest education and you can sometimes invest money and other things that you may invest but the purpose of investing is to uh gain to earn more than what you've previously had or started out with we know some great men of god i would say one in particular every time i think about job i think about how he was a great investor the bible doesn't tell us all that he did to gain the wealth and the riches that he had but one of the things that we do know is that he feared god he did what amen the psalmist say you know this is the beginning of wisdom to fear god and keep his commandment and so job was a fear of god he was a man of integrity and he invested his entire life into god so much so that all the villagers all the people around his area understood him as to be a holy man we know the tragedy the things that happened to job job had to be tested like we all do we will be tested what you love the most most of who you love the most and i think job was tested perhaps greater in a way greater than any man that i know outside of jesus christ himself but because he did righteous before god god prospered that man and that man always kept god as his focus he never looked at his wealth in so much so that when god took it from him he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord now job was not a man just speaking words but he meant those things from his heart there was another great man that was great in this world and it was the rich young ruler it doesn't tell us how wealth how wealthy he was but the bible said he was very rich he really got rich and he as as and and when when he went down uh when jesus went down the the list of things that a righteous man should do uh this rich young ruler says lord i have done all these things for my youth so so you understand if you do the will of god you will prosper doing the will of god whether you be a sinner or saint if you do the will of god you will prosper and god will teach you how to invest you all know that right he taught jacob how to do it and jacob followed the leading of the lord and he became a wealthy man so when you find the will of god and you walk in the will of god god will prosper you but we understand that these things on earth are great but we also know that they're about to perish you and i know that uh the world has gotten [Music] i would say almost 10 times worse than it was since 9 11. uh according to when if you judge america and what she looked like and before 9 11 she almost looked like a christian nation but now um we know she looks like nothing of the sort she has gone beyond uh deliverance this country will never come back and i know everybody's hoping that it will satan has a real trick up his sleeve but one thing i wanted to bring everybody attentions to is that in in this massive time of chaos we must understand why we're here uh god is ordained us amen to to be a light in this dark generation just the other day i was at the atm at my bank and i was uh uh withdrawing uh checking my balance is what i was doing and uh didn't realize there was another man behind me but i know he couldn't have been there long so when i got everything out and took my car started driving my car he bumped his horn and i thought maybe i left something in the machine or something so i got out of the car and he literally cursed me out and the more he cursed me the thing that came out of my mouth was wonderful i kept saying well god bless you god bless you god bless you and then i said sir i could not go i couldn't go no faster than the machine would allow me to well i was surprised and after i drove around the building a scripture came to my mind bless those that curse you i wasn't thinking that but the god in me that wrote it was the god who spoke out god bless you and when i went beyond the building i began to pray for the man and says lord he more than likely have had a rough day be merciful to him you see we are lady grace we're the ones who if there's going to be any grace god has ordained us to give grace and grace is unmerited it's not something you you earn it's something people give you because they desire to give you god gave us grace because he desired to give us grace there's nothing we did and have done oh god could do to earn his grace nor his mercy my subject tonight is failing to invest we have a powerful message and i'm not talking about my message i'm talking about the message of malachi 4. god sent us a prophet with a powerful message but instead of being concerned about the message we're more concerned about ourselves and we fail to see that we're in a time when the world is getting ready to fall even noah preach it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain and the scientist says but there's no water up there they couldn't see what god could see because everything is dimensional and i'm telling you now that the fire is about to fall hello the fire is going to fall amen and you and i must be aware that we do not know the time that is going to fall but it behooves us to make ready and to make sure that the treasure that we're building is building in heaven is that right that's what the bible says sexual affection on things above now that doesn't mean you can't become great in this world but i'm trying to tell you if you do it's going to be short-lived amen and you and i you said well brother because you don't know the day and hour but the messenger told us no we don't know the hour nor do we know the day but one thing for certain god gave us the season and this is the season that god is getting ready to sin the fire watch the political realm everybody's poking the bear right is that right you got china over here you got you got russia over there and everybody's forgetting about the purple curtain and they fail to see it's the purple curtain it's the wizard behind behind the the curtain the man behind the curtain he's the one that's operating everything nobody sees him nobody knows he's a he's been i know it because years ago i saw it in the paper i saw it on the news he called everybody together all of his businessmen and everybody together and they met there in rome and since then the world has been falling apart they wonder why certain people can't be touched it's because they've been ordained y'all understand what i'm saying god ordained the good and the evil and what they fail to see is that this is judgment people say oh yeah it's going to get better no no no no no evil seducers shall wax worse and worse and what we're seeing is a group of people that really think they're doing righteously when they're doing evil amen that's true amen you said that's not possible ask judas ask judas judas thought he was doing good when he was doing evil see you and i must understand that we're living in the parable of matthew 25 where there were five wise and five foolish foolish virgins they they did whatever they were dilatory they they just did whatever they wanted to do they did not take the calling seriously until it was too late like brother adam said in the days of noah before one drop of rain fell noah was in the ark and he says once the rain began to fall it's too late and see that's what people don't understand they don't understand once the council of churches begin to move amen it's too late yes sir it's too late and we fail to see that even then the door is shut cry all you want to moan all you want to that's all you want to but this is your time to invest hallelujah he talked about it there in matthew 25 but listen what he says in matthew 25 14-30 just bear with me for a moment for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his ser several ability and straightway took his journey then he that had received five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two listen this is where i'm going but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money come by the truth with no money and what people fail to see is what we've been doing around this message brother branham said you know we're not parakeets and he said we all you know what paragraphs do repeat just say without revelation just say what he said but even the message has a revelation behind it and you can not receive the revelation of the messages that william branham preached when you're carnal minded you can't read it like a book or newspaper or anything like that you have to have the revelation god has revealed to you what brother branham he said why do you think so many people have fallen away amen because they studied it in their minds they thought they could know god in their minds but the revelation i'm talking about can only strike the heart and that revelation when it strikes your heart it changes you hallelujah not in a bad way but in a good way you become more like him hallelujah right oh but he that had received one went and dig the earth and hid his lord's money and that's what people are doing that's what we've done instead of investing it out in the communities investing out everywhere you can invest it you know we did it we just kept it to ourselves we were afraid we were afraid we weren't even afraid if god would give us some revelation of the message we would be afraid of it why when brother branham said that the seven seals was like five rockets that went up in the air and out of those five rockets it exploded and five more came out of it what was he saying that the message that i have laid out on tapes and books are pr is progressive it'll constantly unfold unfold as it goes up but we're so afraid so we bury it and after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckon with them and so he that has received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou delivered unto me five talents behold i have gained besides them five talents more now listen what he says in the 21st verse he said his laws said unto him why would he say this now because it's got to be the end time he's working with the rapture he's working with god seeing your position just prior to the rapture the changing of the body he says well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joys of the lord huh you understand what i'm saying this is something god is doing now it is what we're supposed to be doing now and i think to myself one thing about the pentecostals they entered into the pentecostal anointing they got speaking in tongues they got shouting they got dancing they got all of those gifts that came with it because they entered into the anointing of their age what about this age the anointing of this age is to produce sons and daughters of god bone of his bone flesh of his flesh hallelujah walk like him talk like him act like and pray like him sing like him everything he did you and i are supposed to be doing now and the only way we can achieve that is to lay in the presence of the son brother said when he before went off the scene he said we're here basically he said the eagles are here the weed is here but it's just green and it needs to lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that don't mean lay in the presence of the sun when you come to church that's every day you should lay in that word lay in there if you don't need understanding you ought to ask god for the understanding lord show me in this message what you're trying to get me to see and understand that's why we don't see the joy there's no joy everybody expect the preachers to have all the joy no you are the joy ought to be hitting me from the pulpit here where is the joy yes we do go through trials hallelujah but even as the psalmist said weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning this sadness and everything it's just a temporal thing it's something we all go through at times but when you wake up and and pinch yourself the joy this is what you're gonna understand when satan can get you sad and he can see you singing the blues he just stole your strength for the joy of the lord is your strength he also then received two talents came and said lord thou delivereth unto me remember i'm telling you this now here it is these five wives and four or five foolish amen they went in and five wives went into the door there was only one door and that door is jesus christ he's the sheep shepherd of the sheepfold y'all understand me you got to go into him and he must come into you this is a this is a time of an invisible union but listen you can't tell me oh i jesus christ is my lord jesus christ is my husband jesus christ and i said where is he and there is nothing no proof in your life just a church member then how can i believe that he's connected to you if i don't see the size and he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they should cast out devils y'all know what i'm saying there's got to be vindication in this bride hallelujah and you should never stop until god approves you and say now here you are we've got to keep moving this thing is you know i know brother said in the last days we'll be slugging along but i'm telling you slug at least look you know if you're going to move slow move but move forward don't stand still listen what the problem is we're looking at too many things you know that's what happened to peter says lord if the you bid me come walking on the water y'all understand he is walking uh his circumstances they are under his feet he's lord of his circumstances hallelujah but the moment he took his eyes off jesus he began to sink and as you've heard before jesus wasn't a million miles away nor was he five feet away he was right there in armed distance because when jesus when peter says lord save me jesus reached out and pulled him up a lot of times we give up right at the time when he we almost there almost there hallelujah hallelujah his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things and i will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joys of thy lord and you know what the lord just showed me you know many times we don't like to be rejected and we don't tell people about the truth because we're afraid to be rejected hello if they did it in the green tree they're going to do it in the dry this message is not going to be received by the majority of the people we need to grow up and be mature hallelujah you got something good like i said down in iowa city all of a sudden you come out of your front your in uh your your house and in the front yard you got your and i said i don't do pink well you know but there's a big pink cadillac out in front of my car in my house and the man says this is yours guess what all of a sudden my my my uh thoughts about pink has changed i might paint it over later but that's my pink car you understand me and guess what for the moment i'm gonna ride around in it i'm gonna go to everybody's house and look what i've got free and the gospel is greater than a pink cadillac amen but see we lost that that ability to tell people about calvary because we want to talk about so many great mysteries people need to know what the cost what it cost them they need to know about jesus christ they need to know about the love of god y'all understand me if you can hook them with the hook them with that that bait hallelujah you can hook them you can roll them into the mysteries but they need to know that jesus christ is still alive they don't know it when we these deep things are all brother brooks listen let me tell you something even when it comes to baby eagles they don't get the whole piece of beef it's cut up however you want to say it right we are meat eaters but most of the time when i say these things i'm not talking about people who have been christians for a long time denominational i'm not talking about i'm to my sinners i'm telling my sinners who don't even know nothing about jesus christ that's what i'm talking about and sometimes you got to preach that to the people in this church amen because they don't know the grace of god still yet people still working by law and systems and stuff like that that's why they're so sad you come in here and you bring the blues in here it's the truth where's the joy nobody's investing i've told people i said we need a sunday school teacher where is it for years i've been crying out for the kids but they don't want to invest in the children everybody's too selfish and the children is what needs to be taught we need some adolescents to teach us some young people teaching they're going wild because nobody's taking the time to teach them oh he's got to be the pastor john pastor can't do everything folks need to invest you got time you got knowledge you got what it takes you ought to stop thinking about yourselves and thinking about investing paul called timothy his own son because he invested in him and what a mighty man of god timothy became enter into the joy of the lord 24 he then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art and hard man reaping where thou has not sown and gathering where thou has not strawed and i was what afraid and went and hid that talent in the earth brother brenham said if you don't know nothing but how the candle got lit tell the people how the candle got lit i was afraid and went and hid my talent in the earth so low there thou had that that is dying his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slawful servant thou knew that i reap where i shall not and gather where i have not strong he said you wicked call the man wicked for hiding the truth call them wicked thou orders therefore to have put my money to the exchanges how do you think i came to this message somebody in my organization dropped a few nuggets on somebody in my organization they came and dropped a few nuggets on me i took the same nuggets and dropped it on somebody else you know how many people left that church at one time 60 preachers deacons we had our older church already ready we just needed the message and we got it what was it somebody sold huh they didn't even have to come in our church they knew somebody there and they knew righteous and holy people who were thirsting for more god they dropped it on them we didn't even know what we was doing man have you seen this have you seen that in the script yet what hallelujah i didn't even understand a lot of things oh lord have mercy he said thou ought to therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received my own with usury at my coming what are we preparing for huh that's exactly right don't be afraid of it we are we're part of is coming but we're preparing for his coming hallelujah the time jesus comes every i won't see him this time but there's a time when he does come every i will see him but the bride of jesus christ she's moving and and she's being transformed and translated right now she's moving from this third dimension moving from the fourth and the fifth all the way up to the sixth because that's where she's getting her inspiration from amen is that right because when you've heard this message you've heard from your theophany amen hallelujah i feel like praising him it's you know it's going to be hard you and i we're in the worst age ever but the most glorious age brother said if he had a choice of picking the age that he would he would rather be in he said it would be this age hallelujah why because we are going to see the pride of jesus christ coming to full manifestation of him she becomes him or he becomes her however you want to put it but don't tell me it ain't happening i'm a witness isn't happening because he's changing me he said cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness what happened he missed the rapture there shall be weeping and dashing of teeth listen we can't even get people to clean the church nobody want to do anything free and god has done all the things that he could do for the sp these people right that's the truth everybody don't mind dirtying it up but nobody want to clean it i wish i had the whole church here to say that too maybe i'll say it again sunday you know the point is people of god you know what this is we know this is the lord's house but this is the temporal lord's house too i would look forward to somebody's coming in here and say you know what brother looks i i was like brother marshall bless his heart it's hard but anyway our um oh god yeah uh he would he would come and you know bring flowers even though the flowers would die he'd bring more flowers every time he kind of like the same way i am i can't do flowers and there's some people that can do flowers and they just bloom like crazy you know but uh then he brought in some plastic ones we have to worry about them dying on you right but nevertheless he was doing his best and god will reward him for that you know most of the people in this message have been a bit you know you don't have to become an organization to invest no no no i'll show you another little investor a fellow who had just a few fish and loaves of bread that's all he had and god took that little bit of substance and multiplied it guess what he made history not just here on earth but in heaven do everybody knows about him and god didn't even give him a name you know why i believe because all of us can invest like that and because they don't know what it is to get into the spirit of the message they don't people don't know what it is they don't know how to get into the spirit of the message you know and the true truth of the matter is you don't there is no way you can know that other that god reveals it to you but he can't reveal it to a person that's just counter-minded you know like you've heard me say the bible said put on the whole arm of god we we need to put on hold of our god the bible said we ought to you know cleanse ourselves daily and all these things if you don't do all those things you'll never be spiritual let me say it like this there is a flood and you've heard me say it again there's a flood of demonic forces that are now just not hitting america but hitting the entire world and god is angry you say he's not yes he is god is angry with this world his eyes are flaming fire right now listen people of god when you see how perverted this world has come and and and you know and trying to undo what god has already done let's get real every nation that did what we're doing they ended up in disaster it ended up in disaster look throughout history i tell you what i don't have time to go through it but you can go way back and every nation every tribe every country that perverted and especially when they knew better god destroyed them he didn't even spare israel look at it this way all too many people read the bible where it says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they will know that if they want to receive the holy spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then god would be duty-bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the holy ghost they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as a word say pray to god for revelation by his spirit that is the first step get in the spirit like me just you use another let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have read it it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for the spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and pray for and that will be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it is all over there is no other court of appeal god will fulfill his word or we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the act first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do hallelujah see that's why the devil defeats us we won't get in the spirit we're coming here like catholics and methodists and things like that hallelujah stiff like stiffs hallelujah you got to get in the spirit people say well i ain't that emotional well let me give you a little bit of this this heavenly you get some of this heavenly wine you'll be like the jews jumping out the

god can't curse his own he can't when god blessed you he blessed you right let me ask you a question did he bless jacob he did but did jacob suffer yes he did if god bless you it doesn't mean you're not going to suffer you're going to suffer he said if you read if you suffer with me you'll reign with me hallelujah but i don't want to be suffering as an evil doer let me suffer for the name of jesus christ hallelujah oh god you don't know how i'm praying i'm i came in here burdened only because i want to be more like him i feel like i'm about to lose my mind because i want to be more like him hallelujah i don't know what everybody else is thinking what everybody else is doing i'm just telling you that's where my heart is i see this message i know it's right and i know god keeps all his promises hallelujah i believe in god's seed or the seed of god and i believe is he is in me i'm one of them and i know he's anointed that he's a quick knit and i know right now i could i could see changes and many changes i i could not have i wouldn't have known was dead even when that man did what he did all i could say god bless you so god bless there was a time he would you know i might have said god bless you but my back and my neck would have been you know the hairs could have been standing up on me i'm just being honest and i wasn't angry i really felt sorry for the man and god god revealed that to me he said well brother i said lord what was that all about i said what did i do i did nothing the whole thing was staged by god i passed the test yes by god's grace i passed the test hallelujah also is god himself y'all understand he didn't use some somebody else to sow his seed he so he was the good man he he sold the seed before the foundation of the world his seed is not a habit or it it in otherwise perverted his seed will and shall bring forth of its kind and that's what you you got like god revealed to me we don't know what his kind is all we seen was jesus we heard of him we saw you know uh little by little by william brown we saw that but listen god is saying more of me amen must be in you more huh elisha was more how can you say i'm brighter than you no where's your joy amen i'm not saying you're not but i'm saying the devil is tricking you somewhere you know our focus is in the wrong place we're looking in the wrong area and then listen i tell you what even when i went to college when i went to school amen guess what jesus is on my mind people knew i was a christian i wasn't ashamed amen like i told you i got so filled with the holy ghost one time just on my test when god my mind went blank and god gave me gave me uh he brought it back to my remembrance and before i knew it i was speaking in tongues in class i didn't care i remember coming home and i was so excited but you had to step up to my porch right before i could get there the holy ghost hit me and i was out there i didn't care my neighbor my neighbor saw me he said boy i know you don't change but it wasn't me it was the joy of the lord we should never be ashamed of god no matter where we go don't be afraid to talk about jesus in public because they're not afraid to talk about their devils you ain't nothing but a holy roller hallelujah thank you thanks a lot when they call you one of those things let me go because i'm i'm having too much fun it's i'm serious when i have god is good to me see it's a carrier not talking about talking about the pentecostal world it had to be but when they went but when that wheat begins to grow like the church first was a carrier to jesus this is what i was trying to tell the people when the prophet of god went off the scene everybody said we got it we got it we got it but that's not what he said he said we were already green we were green you know that's what that's why we fought each other we weren't mature that's why we had our differences our denominational issues right green fought like children but now it's time to grow up it's time to be perfect mature right the time of maturity is here we have laid in listen you don't listen to the message every day and i know sometimes i i feel my grandkids sometimes because they wake up with brother brown on their own they they go to bed with brother brown every time daddy grandpa and you know i know i don't care i don't think about it sometime i do and i think well you somehow you're going to have to get it but the point is i don't care what you think about me i know i'm feeding my soul that's all i know and i know at what point in time he's going to manifest what's going in it's going in there and it's not going in there for nothing it's a purpose why do i hunger and thirst every day for more of him more of him more of him it's because there's a hunger there's a life in me that's calling for it hallelujah and one of these old days amen it's going to manifest itself i won't have to do nothing it will come forth hallelujah that's what you got to understand people if life is in there it's pulling for the word that's what it feeds on it feeds on the word hallelujah let me move on now but when he began to tell the truth let me let me go back but when the wheat began to grow like the church first was a carrier to jesus but when he began to tell them that the truth of god they separated from him now what's happening no cooperation why it has to be that way so that the wheat itself can lay before the sun he's at the s-u-n and and so the spiritual wheat can lay before the s-o-n to be turned to a golden grain of the word see made word god made flesh vindicated he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also the church that that that that believes on me the works that i'll do shall we do also the church that lives by the word rightly not through organization but in in the presence of the word the sun it becomes what a very a very same word that went down on the day of pentecost now doesn't malachi 4 teach us that before the great and terrible day of the lord shall come that that which will will take place how many knows that he will restore the hearts of the children to the father is that right and the faith of the original pentecostal fathers and in that day luke 17 30 i believe that believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of his this hour the the message reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son see what i'm saying you can put it anywhere you want to but he brought it back down to us hallelujah 8 35 give me 10 more minutes and i'll let you go you know i talk about think about investing and and you know i used to have this thing and i didn't understand what god was doing but when i was a christian you know when i got an early young christian i used to get jealous of the old testament things god said how they did all of this what i mean how god you know they're supposed to be new and hear these great men of god but i didn't know what god was doing i was ignorant of what he was doing but one of my one of my my uh favorite characters were was david he was a boy but he had the faith of a man and david amen used his experience and invested those experiences you see that's what make a great football player that what that's what makes a great uh uh a golfer whatever sport you might play you know your failures become stepping stones they become experiences and then you you begin to invest those those and reflect back and you you begin to invest your failures into in ways that the affairs have become victories hallelujah now david didn't i mean david didn't have a failure but the point is he used his his lion experience it meant to conquer the bear and he used his bare experience to conquer goliath it just kept mounting up and his his faith in god began to increase in such a way it meant that he wasn't afraid he had no fear that's where god wants us brother said where are all the little davids where are the little davids he wants us to be a army a people with no fear that's what god is raising up huh amen oh people of god you say oh we gonna be a mighty army yeah it's gonna be on this earth before you go there you got to conquer here before you go there i'm almost done hallelujah i love i love i love this is what i want to say to people you know when we talk like this you know sometimes people think you got to be a great warrior but let me say it like this you may not god may never use you to to do one miracle but he expects you to live the life that is your great the greatest of all victory christ in you so don't don't let the devil think you got to go out here and do all this no no days that are led by the spirit i want to bring a balance to this you led to do the things you do it's not your own mind i got to do this no it's god leading you to do it and oftentimes when god is leading you you don't even know he's leading you but you're in the spirit of it hallelujah the bible says all the prophets speaking of the coming of the lord of john the baptist they said every mountain and i this is why i want to tell you something this is what i want to emphasize because without revelation you would think that the coming of john the baptist would have come with a great earthquake what would say it just like the prophet said well that's what the people did and guess what they missed him upon this rock i'll build my church it has to come by revelation he'll say it but he hides himself behind the very words and then reveals it to the people his people in such a different manner john the baptist had had followers and he they knew he was somebody just to show you how they even had the resurrection wrong they said you know uh uh who do men say i the son of man am you know some say that yeah daughter lies something jeremiah one of the prophets see they had the they thought they took the they took resurrection as almost like it was reincarnation you hear me yeah they did that's what you know they had it mixed up just like they had the coming of the lord mixed up like brother said they thought he was going to come down with the lightning bolt the big o you know they just thought the coming of the law was going to be different and here he comes when the scripture already said riding on the on the on the coat of uh the back of a following ass y'all know what i'm saying coming in on a donkey and they thought he was coming in on a stallion but look every mountain will be brought down every low place will be brought up all the rough places will be made clear and what did them people think oh angels will come down and they'll beat the drums and the bands and what a time we have out there but what was it a little old fuzzy face prophet come out of the wilderness with his beard sticking out like one of these these fuzzy words brother branham know he can say it a big piece of sheep wrapped around him and leather girdles about half dressed preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand not even with shoes on standing barefooted mud squishing up between his toes on the muddy bank of jordan and that was what the bible called great amen what they were looking for hmm see what people don't is it always have to be this way god joined scripture together that only took a profit to break it break them in part you understand what i'm saying we thought we would thought john the baptist was the only the founding elijah we didn't know that elijah was coming again you know to the gentiles it took a profit to pull that out of the scripture y'all understand what i'm saying and that revelation didn't just just become a revelation it came a manifestation it was vindicated that what was what was preached and taught was true we say we must say it exactly like he said it i'm listen before you can get a revelation you've got to say it just like he said it i'm not saying it don't say it like he said it i'm saying there's a revelation behind everything he says that's all i'm saying i'm not telling you to twist nothing i'm saying you got to understand amen if you don't take it face value you won't get it no other way right yo you okay give me another one i think it's uh genesis the third chapter 17 18 verse 16. we'll talk about the serpent shall bruise his head and you know heal and you know and if when when did that happen huh you would have thought a serpent you know what i mean you would have thought but it took god to reveal that that was calvary see upon this rock i'll build my church and every revelation you get must come back to the euro theorem every one of them now i'm gonna let you go i'm gonna let you go brother i'm saying the the bible to be the bible is to be revealed by inspiration that's the only thing the revelation jesus told peter upon this rock this rock of revelation reveals who he is blessed are thou simon son of jonah's flesh and blood has not revealed this to you and i'm gonna say it like this and i'm just gonna close this because i got too much always but anyway that's why people struggle with who brother branham was they can't see they can't they see the man false they see his human humanity and they can't see they can't see that there were times that this man ministry almost typed and almost was the fulfilling of almost every great prophet in the bible and most of all they couldn't see it when jesus christ was standing in that human flesh not a second person the person god himself they couldn't see that they still don't even people around the message they still don't see because they don't understand what a true prophet is a true prophet has no seed of his own the only seed he carries is the it's the god seed and that's what he brings and people are still struggling and they couldn't understand when brother brown said no i am not he that's the same thing john said but did not john have the holy ghost y'all hear what i'm saying the problem of god this is what gets me he never ever tried to get glory for himself he always pointed to jesus christ and the things we've done with him he quit preaching because of what people did with him and tried to give the credit i called i better not say this but i called a well-known place not long ago maybe a year ago and i was talking with the people because they i know them and you know what they said yeah the lord uh how she said it brother branham did this but he want us to give the credit to jesus hello did y'all hear what i just said brother branham did this but he want us to say jesus did it is that cr what's wrong with people when brother said jesus himself never healed one person god himself i can't do nothing except the father show me i'm closing but you see what it is people don't when you when you can't see your position where you are now you keep looking back and trying to get the prophet he the prophet has done what he's supposed to do now it's on you and listen people god is gonna say what did brother branham do what did you do what did you do with what he left how did you invest what did you come what did you get out did you get more of you understand what i'm saying what did you do did you you know i don't i reap where i haven't sown you know my point is i got some friends of mine who has not even come to this word some of them come to church has come to church have me but every time i get a chance i sow a seed i do it whether you they like it or not because i know if there is anything in them it's going to spring up someday you love the lord don't be afraid about you know you know you witnessing tell us about it if it ain't just nothing nothing but a little nugget did you know you know what i'm saying i've heard i had a a friend of mine said man i sure wish i could love the lord like you do now that was a compliment that was really a compliment because i do love the lord and i wish he could love the lord like i do or even more so but my point is he saw something in me and i don't know what that is and what other than jesus christ that stan i'm not boasting on me i'm boasting on jesus christ people it did not the bible said that he'd be a well of water springing up into eternal life if you got so much jesus in you it's going to come up when you try to even keep your mouth shut it's going to flow through the cracks it will you'll be you you you somebody be saying something the next thing you'll be saying hey man they're gonna look they're gonna look at you at me you do it you don't even realize it right it comes out of you it comes out of you right we're blessed people i want to see the joy of the lord in this place we there's no reason listen people whatever you come you leave everything leave your weight leave everything out there come in here and if you don't even feel like it bring your sacrifice because i tell you what physically i was just really tired i had a lot of things to do today and and and i kept praying and everything i asked god
