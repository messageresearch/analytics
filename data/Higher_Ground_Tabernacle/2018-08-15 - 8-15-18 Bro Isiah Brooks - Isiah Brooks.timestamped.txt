[0:01] no more dying death or we are going to
[0:06] see no more dying there we are going oh
[0:11] no more dying there oh we are going to
[0:16] see the Amen Alleluia hallelujah Oh soon
[0:22] and very soon oh we are gonna see the
[0:27] king Oh soon and very soon we are gonna
[0:31] see the king oh soon and very soon we
[0:35] are gonna see the king Amen Alleluia
[0:40] hallelujah
[0:41] we are good all soon and very soon oh we
[0:46] are good all soon and very soon we are
[0:51] gonna see the king oh soon and very soon
[0:55] we are gonna see the Kings
[0:59] hallelujah hallelujah we are gonna see
[1:03] the king soon and very soon we are going
[1:23] to see the king amen trust the Lord all
[1:29] of us will be ready to do that without
[1:33] God where would we be
[1:36] it's so amazing me that there are so
[1:40] many people who don't even believe that
[1:42] God exists the saddest thing about it is
[1:46] it doesn't matter whether we believe it
[1:49] or not he exists
[1:53] there were many people in the days of
[1:54] nor didn't believe it was gonna rain it
[1:59] didn't stop God from making it rain God
[2:02] will make even the the the hardest man
[2:05] or the the atheists believe he's God
[2:09] because the Bible says every knee shall
[2:12] bow and every tongue shall confess that
[2:14] Jesus is Lord to the glory of God our
[2:17] Father I am grateful that God's mercy
[2:21] and grace has found us he doesn't have
[2:25] to make us bow we bow because we want to
[2:29] bow we bow because we realize he is God
[2:33] and he deserve all the praise he deserve
[2:36] all the glory as we stand let us turn to
[2:40] Corinthians 1st Corinthians 2:15 chapter
[2:43] the song goes great with with the
[2:47] message surely God is good to us
[3:19] as we read beginning at the fifth eighth
[3:25] verse now this I say brethren that flesh
[3:30] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[3:33] God neither doth corruption inherit
[3:37] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[3:41] we shall not sleep but we shall all be
[3:45] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[3:49] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[3:53] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[3:58] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[4:05] for this corruptible must put on
[4:07] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[4:10] immortality for so this corruptible
[4:15] shall have put on incorruption and this
[4:17] mortal shall have put on immortality
[4:20] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[4:24] that is written death is swallowed up in
[4:27] victory Oh death where is thy sting o
[4:33] grave where is thy victory the sting of
[4:39] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[4:42] the law but thanks be to God which
[4:45] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[4:47] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[4:51] brethren be steadfast unmovable always
[4:56] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[5:01] much as you know that your labor is not
[5:04] in vain in the Lord one more scripture
[5:08] and we'll let you be seated 1st
[5:11] Thessalonians the fifth chapter we're
[5:13] going to come from we're gonna read the
[5:15] first 10 verses but of the time and of
[5:19] the seasons
[5:20] you have no need that I write unto you
[5:23] for yourself know perfectly that the day
[5:26] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[5:28] night for when they shall say peace and
[5:31] safety then sudden destruction cometh on
[5:34] them as travail upon a woman with child
[5:37] and they shall not escape but ye
[5:40] brethren are not in darkness that that
[5:42] day should overtake you as a thief ye
[5:46] are the children of light and the
[5:48] children of the day we are not of the
[5:50] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[5:54] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[5:56] and be sober for they that sleep sleep
[5:59] in the night and they that be drunken
[6:02] are drunken in the night but let us who
[6:05] are of the day be sober putting on the
[6:07] breastplate of faith and love and for an
[6:11] helmet the hope of salvation for God
[6:14] have not appointed us to wrath but to
[6:16] obtain salvation by a Lord Jesus Christ
[6:19] who died for us that whether we are
[6:22] asleep we should live together with him
[6:25] wherefore comfort yourself together and
[6:28] edify one another even as also you do

[11:07] hallelujah that's all I want close to
[11:12] the Lord close to thee close to thee my
[11:20] subject on tonight would be just that so
[11:25] close to God just didn't want to say
[11:30] close to God I want to be so close to
[11:33] God because that were so in this you
[11:37] cannot describe how greater closeness
[11:40] that is it's just not being closest like
[11:44] so close like God so loved the world it
[11:49] actually puts more to that closeness
[11:55] we realized by God's grace that we are
[11:59] in a time where Satan is fighting and
[12:02] he's bombard in everybody's minds homes
[12:06] jobs you name it the devil is really
[12:09] striking everyone but you know God has
[12:14] given us something of the world just
[12:18] don't know anything about and God intent
[12:22] for these storms that are now rising his
[12:26] intent is to better you and God wants to
[12:30] see a people that has undisturbed faith
[12:34] the kind of faith that no matter what
[12:37] Satan tries to do it will not disturb
[12:41] you because you're so trusting God now
[12:44] we're living in time than we we know the
[12:47] Bible tells us that we ought not to be
[12:48] ignorant of these times because we
[12:51] realize amen that these times is just
[12:54] declaring that the coming of the Lord is
[12:56] close by God said even last week when
[13:00] the brother came as it was in the days
[13:02] of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah
[13:04] and we realized violence was in the land
[13:07] all kinds of things were happening and
[13:09] you and I know that this world has gone
[13:12] completely insane and the only people
[13:16] that has their sanity is those who are
[13:18] Christians yeah well there's a time our
[13:23] country did have a little sense and
[13:25] that's when we truly believed in the
[13:28] principles of the Bible but but but our
[13:30] country have strayed so far away from
[13:33] that they've taken it away taken up our
[13:37] way the Bible out of the school's out of
[13:41] the churches many people don't even
[13:43] carry their Bibles to church anymore
[13:45] but there's a time you know we were
[13:48] Christians were known because they
[13:50] carried their Bibles everywhere where
[13:52] they went
[13:53] now we're living in a time and like I
[13:55] said God said don't be ignorant I'm
[13:58] coming and then in though the devil may
[14:00] see it may seem like he's taking his
[14:02] time he really is because God has an
[14:06] appointed time
[14:08] but in this time you must understand
[14:10] that Jesus Christ died on the cross and
[14:14] he rose again that we may have power
[14:17] authority and you must understand that
[14:20] his whole teeth God the devil could
[14:24] never Amen stop the relationship but
[14:28] because of the breach because of sin he
[14:31] broke the fellowship but now because of
[14:34] the blood we can fellowship with God
[14:37] right we call a Redemption by blood
[14:40] right and fellowship by blood the whole
[14:44] point a man of God dying is to restore
[14:47] back him in his creation with the
[14:51] Creator to star by the creation with
[14:54] their Creator God always he wanted to
[14:58] fellowship and he doesn't this sin will
[15:01] breach you thus in a men would keep you
[15:05] from fellowshiping with God even though
[15:08] God will be with you he said I'll never
[15:10] leave you nor forsake you but did you
[15:14] know since there are people who can live
[15:19] so close to God that they have the
[15:23] ability to see things that other people
[15:25] cannot see yeah
[15:28] and sometimes when those people who are
[15:31] living close to God see things people
[15:36] but you see there is a position that you
[15:41] can have with God that God will show you
[15:43] and tell you things that he won't tell
[15:46] others that right you see John one of
[15:52] Jesus disciples was one of those John
[15:56] newfies the other disciples didn't know
[15:59] but God in the flesh of Jesus when when
[16:03] Jesus were to be portrayed betrayed amen
[16:06] Jesus told John who to betray it was
[16:10] none of the others disciples knew it
[16:13] amen and those disciples knew that John
[16:17] was a bosom buddy of Jesus and he said
[16:20] John go find
[16:22] that's what they said to John go see
[16:24] what Jesus who Jesus is talking about
[16:27] gee that's how it is and that's how it
[16:30] will be there be a group of people that
[16:33] will be able to see the coming of the
[16:36] Lord
[16:36] they'll be able to know he meant that
[16:39] he's at hand is that right with that
[16:42] resurrection began there will be a
[16:44] people that will be able to see those
[16:47] raised from the dead everybody won't see
[16:50] it just like in the days of Jesus when
[16:54] Jesus rose from the dead the Bible said
[16:56] the grave will open a meaning that was
[16:59] in the grave rose hallelujah and the
[17:03] Bible said that they were seen by many
[17:05] but everybody didn't see it
[17:09] hallelujah so will it be this
[17:11] resurrection it will be such a people
[17:14] that is so close to God God is going to
[17:17] tell his secret that right remember the
[17:23] time of second Kings assist chapter when
[17:27] Elisha amen was being surrounded by the
[17:31] enemy I believe in Assyrians and here it
[17:34] was gay gays or his servant was so
[17:37] afraid Amen because he said all master
[17:40] they're more him than us and in Elijah's
[17:44] and Lord open up your servants I let him
[17:48] see hallelujah that there are more of us
[17:52] calling is that right remember we are
[17:56] serving not just Jesus Christ he is Lord
[18:00] and He is Lord of hosts
[18:02] hallelujah he's the captain of our
[18:05] salvation you understand me
[18:07] hey man he's our better light he's our
[18:11] sword and shield
[18:12] he's our weapon tree he's I everything
[18:15] but you'll never understand that until
[18:18] you close to him when you with God and
[18:24] you close to God God will tell you and
[18:26] he keeps you straight you know God is
[18:29] the one that keeps the soul you can't
[18:31] keep your soul hallelujah God
[18:35] you're so is that right listen do you
[18:40] know that Enoch knew when he was going
[18:43] to be translated why you say that
[18:46] brother Brooks because he walked with
[18:49] God and he was found not is that right
[18:53] a man he was translated amen listen God
[18:58] God comes to him and he says Enoch today
[19:01] is your name is that right he told him

[19:11] and nobody could see that Abraham would
[19:14] have a son here was Abraham and Sarah 70
[19:17] or something years old they will all
[19:19] past menopause and everything else and
[19:21] God said you gonna have a son hallelujah
[19:25] one day I believe God said eat up I'm
[19:27] gonna do a new thing with you you gonna
[19:29] be translated the Prophet God said one
[19:33] day he not waived to his family said
[19:35] goodbye hallelujah amen and what
[19:38] happened he man he walked with God is
[19:41] that right and he was found not I
[19:43] believe the bride will know because the
[19:47] Bible said we are not ignorant we're not
[19:50] children of the darkness hallelujah but
[19:52] we're children of the light but in order
[19:55] to see him you've got to be him
[19:57] hallelujah
[19:58] let me say that again in order to see
[20:01] him you've got to be him hallelujah

[20:15] kind of closeness that will take a
[20:17] rapture by faith Enoch was translated

[20:48] and stinking is that right he had to die
[20:51] God raised him up from the dead and he
[20:54] died again
[20:55] hallelujah but this time we'll never die
[20:59] anymore once we are changed it meant
[21:02] from our the so nasty filthy flesh from
[21:06] mortality and mortality

[21:10] be swallowed up in victory what his
[21:15] victory because he died died because he

[21:25] confident amen in this victory he said
[21:27] own death were sustained whole grain

[21:33] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ

[21:43] save myself no more than I can hear
[21:46] myself but I know the Gila I had nosily
[21:49] redeemed my hallelujah I know the man

[27:28] love is not something in practice long
[27:30] years God his log did it all of us was
[27:38] wicked every one of us have done

[27:51] world he knew you you were part of him
[27:55] you didn't know it hallelujah when you
[27:57] use in the club and said pass me another
[28:00] drink you didn't know that inside of you
[28:03] was an attribute of God is that right
[28:06] till one day the voice of God found you
[28:10] and the Bible said my sheep hears my
[28:13] voice and astray that they will not
[28:16] follow hallelujah you see what I'm
[28:18] saying
[28:19] thank you heard me say you couldn't be a
[28:22] part of Billy Graham's group you
[28:23] couldn't be a part of all Robert's group
[28:25] because that's not the voice you heard
[28:28] from the beginning hallelujah you heard
[28:31] the great Shepherd hallelujah you heard

[33:24] have him be destinated us predestinated
[33:28] us unto the adoption of children by
[33:29] Jesus Christ to himself is that right
[33:33] he loved you God loves you and this is
[33:37] question-and-answers he loved you before
[33:39] there was a world he knowed your nature
[33:41] who watch this he knowed your weaknesses
[33:45] he knowed your habits he knows all about
[33:49] you what she was going to be and then

[34:49] little something something anyway Amen
[34:52] you look around and then God amen comes
[34:55] along and he shows you it ain't about

[35:08] there was a world he knew your nature he
[35:10] knew your weakness he knew your habits
[35:11] he knew all about you what was you going
[35:14] to be is that right hallelujah in that
[35:16] God so loved the world he gave His only
[35:19] begotten Son right and when he did that
[35:21] before there ever was a speck of light
[35:23] then you eternal with God huh
[35:26] his choosing you makes you eternal when
[35:30] you receive the Holy Ghost didn't you

[36:35] children of God
[36:36] we're not the great Elohim but we are
[36:39] all spring according to acts right
[36:42] offspring of God it's like a horse
[36:45] heaven our hearts a cow having a cow a
[36:49] dog having a dog you possess the same
[36:54] characteristics that's why they call
[36:58] them Christians because they act like
[37:01] Christ they walk like Christ
[37:03] supernatural followed them like Christ
[37:06] hallelujah is that all right was like
[37:10] Moses with Moses of God come on that's
[37:13] what the Bible said God said to Moses
[37:16] I'm gonna make you God to Pharaoh
[37:20] hallelujah and he was God to Pharaoh no
[37:24] matter what Pharaoh said he couldn't
[37:25] overcome Moses because God was in Moses
[37:29] it wasn't the flesh and blood of Moses
[37:31] but it was that same pillar fire that
[37:33] was in the burning bush that now stood
[37:36] in Moses hallelujah and that's what we
[37:39] need we need a pillar fire not on the
[37:42] picture we need win the pillar of fire
[37:49] which is God comes down and set within
[37:51] your heart you become part of him he

[38:21] that right you can't be afraid of the
[38:23] devil
[38:25] hmm don't you know
[38:28] zone law say that like Moses and like
[38:30] Elijah like those prophets who live so
[38:32] close to God till God just transfer
[38:35] himself right into them huh and they
[38:39] spoke not themselves but God take no
[38:42] thought what you should say cuz this is
[38:45] not you their speech
[38:47] come on that's the kind of closeness God
[38:50] won't not talk to you in your ear but
[38:53] talk to you from your heart you see so
[38:55] in dwell in you then you assault or
[38:58] surrender to him that he can say what he
[39:01] wants to say at any given time but he
[39:05] said don't add to it keep your mouth
[39:06] shut till he speaks another area it's
[39:11] the father that dwelleth in you he do it

[39:22] not your own you're dead
[39:24] so the words you're speaking is life so
[39:27] therefore when you speak the word when
[39:29] God speaks the word through you it must
[39:31] come to pass well because the word can't
[39:34] come back boy hallelujah
[39:37] if you die you take the blood out of the
[39:39] land and you embalm him trouble of it is
[39:42] a lot of them never been that got him
[39:44] bought you take the blood out of a man
[39:46] he's gone then the only thing you got to
[39:48] do is put another blood back in him and
[39:50] he's going to live again see you took
[39:53] his blood out and see now we'll put the
[39:56] blood of Jesus Christ and see and that

[51:16] all things through Christ which
[51:17] strengtheneth me hallelujah that means I
[51:22] was getting a little weak but God came
[51:24] along and strengthened me anybody know
[51:26] what I'm talking about there are times I
[51:28] meant even in your trying times seem
[51:31] like the time prolong look like it goes
[51:34] so long and you said oh god how long you
[51:40] gonna let this day and just when you
[51:43] think
[51:43] Amen that you bout ready to break God
[51:46] bring a word God give you something to
[51:48] give you strength and then you roll your
[51:50] shoulders back and you're ready to fight
[51:52] some more she does that's God a man you
[51:56] know and the truth of the other the
[51:58] truth is if the Bible says when you say
[52:01] you we that's when you be strong you
[52:03] ought to say that hallelujah
[52:06] I'm never weak I'm strong but because my
[52:10] strength is up the Lord
[52:13] unity come with God from God the power
[52:16] of God and when the believer the Creator
[52:19] see where the creation here on earth
[52:21] that God has created is united with God
[52:25] then there comes a unity and gives faith
[52:28] and when a man see that he's persistent
[52:31] nobody is going to shake him you
[52:35] understand me I can't help her to think
[52:36] about that early church when Peter James
[52:39] and John was thrown into prison and they
[52:41] went into prayer and they shook shook
[52:44] the jailhouse and and we don't know how
[52:47] far the jailhouse was from the prayer
[52:49] room but it shook it a man you know I
[52:52] want to see something shake I want to
[52:54] see the saints of God getting such a
[52:56] unity that my problem is your problem
[52:58] it's not that we're separating I don't
[53:01] have my problem is it's my problem no no
[53:03] no my problem is your problem and your
[53:05] problem is my problem that's the way
[53:09] it's supposed to be hallelujah is that
[53:11] the way it's supposed to be absolutely
[53:13] oh my see when we get there we will
[53:18] understand we'll understand each other
[53:20] and I believe then we began to see
[53:22] angels hmm the church was so on one
[53:26] Accord the angels visit that prisoner
[53:28] broke the prison chains huh when you and
[53:33] I get on a call like we ought to be on a
[53:35] car and that one Accord is loving one
[53:37] another hey you know this church is
[53:40] universal but if we can just get this
[53:42] little fellowship like that mighty
[53:45] things will happen in this place hmm
[53:48] see I want to see Matthew and I don't
[53:51] know about y'all but I I've got some
[53:52] things on my agenda you know I know I'm
[53:55] gonna see Jesus Christ
[53:57] I want to see some others too when I get
[53:59] there right and no more than likely I'm
[54:02] gonna see a few of them before I get
[54:03] there because we have that 30 or 40 days
[54:05] resurrection Jubilee so if you see me
[54:11] jerkin and you don't see nobody bout me
[54:13] you see don't you worry about it
[54:15] brother Brooks ain't crazy I'm seeing
[54:17] some things that somebody else is not
[54:18] seeing hallelujah if I all of a sudden
[54:21] walking down the street hallelujah so
[54:28] you're not maybe I don't know who gonna
[54:30] start seeing at first but I know I'm
[54:31] gonna be one of them
[54:35] that all right I want to see Matthew
[54:38] Mark Luke John Paul Barnabas oh I won't
[54:40] see them all but you know what I want to
[54:42] see Jesus most of all is that right you
[54:46] know one thing you and I got such a
[54:48] great thing going on the Angels don't
[54:50] have no idea of what we shouting about
[54:56] they never been lost they never had to
[54:59] be redeemed hallelujah then a sit back
[55:03] amen and watch us sing Amazing Grace how
[55:06] sweet the sound I don't know how far
[55:08] that's gonna reach throughout the heaven
[55:10] but I guarantee you the stars will be
[55:12] singing in and everything else with us
[55:15] hallelujah all I know is that one voice
[55:19] by the name of John he's a tall heaven
[55:21] heard me I can't imagine what that was
[55:25] like I don't know how he did it but he's
[55:27] a tall heaven heard me that was above
[55:30] that was beneath everywhere heard John
[55:32] say what glory oh my goodness I'm almost
[55:41] done see what we need to know is some
[55:45] kind of devil fights us and it's true
[55:47] because we forget you didn't do nothing
[55:49] to be saved
[55:50] absolutely not god save you say well I
[55:54] repented you wouldn't never repented
[55:56] that he until he gave you repentance huh
[56:00] hallelujah you know I cried at the altar
[56:02] all night long and then God giving you
[56:04] don't work yourself y'all understand me
[56:07] you don't work yourself in that way like
[56:08] you got them you gonna marry the Holy
[56:10] Ghost
[56:11] you know we crowd to the altar we're
[56:13] trying to yield to God
[56:15] it's yielding not begging them Oh God
[56:18] give me your Holy Ghost because the Holy
[56:20] Ghost as a gift you don't beg for a gift
[56:22] you receive again but oftentimes our
[56:25] faithful let us receive it pride or
[56:28] whatever the case may be
[56:29] oh god I'm just so unworthy as long as
[56:33] you say that and keep saying that you
[56:35] ain't getting that nothing you ought to
[56:38] know you're unworthy before you get on
[56:40] your knees
[56:41] this gift is not based upon worthiness
[56:46] no it's a gift cause he gave it to you
[56:49] he said if you repent which he gave you
[56:52] repent and be baptized in the name of
[56:54] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[56:55] your sins you shall receive the gift at
[56:58] all ago so when you give before God you
[57:00] say Lord I repented you gave me
[57:02] repentance right I've done that I've
[57:05] been baptized No okay now my gift I'm
[57:10] the one you promised to give it to I've
[57:13] done it hold him hold him there hold him
[57:16] there hold him there to that sweet peace
[57:19] of release come upon you hmm you O God
[57:24] to his word he got to give it

[57:45] when we crown him king of kings and Lord
[57:49] of lords people don't understand they
[57:52] don't understand
[57:54] some people think Christianity is a
[57:56] fairy tale some mine worked up in some
[57:59] man religion but what are these old days
[58:04] see I don't boast but I've seen the
[58:07] pillar fire you understand me my point

[58:36] faith it is by faith you are saved right
[58:40] by the grace of God you were saved and
[58:43] it's through faith and who gives you the
[58:45] faith to be say how do you know you've
