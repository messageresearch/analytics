[31:47] me in a bit I have no idea we really
[31:51] don't but you know the Lord knows where
[31:53] they are how he's found them before me
[31:55] for me before and I know he'll do it
[31:58] again
[31:58] not prolonging the time that was such a
[32:00] wonderful song thank you brother
[32:02] we just get right into the word of the
[32:04] Lord I want to start with second Peter
[32:06] the first chapter we're not going to
[32:08] break these things these are virtues
[32:10] down but I keep preaching on these
[32:13] because I really want everybody to
[32:15] really dig into that and ask God for the
[32:18] revelation of the hour what we need to
[32:20] do to make a rapture I believe that when
[32:23] we seek God in this manner we are
[32:26] seeking Him according to his perfect
[32:27] will and when you when you in the
[32:32] perfect will of God
[32:33] you can't help but to be blessed
[32:36] I just know that we're living in the
[32:40] last days the enemy is fighting
[32:44] everybody on him you know just amazing
[32:47] what what's happening
[32:49] as I said earlier even this morning if
[32:51] we really think that we're in a battle
[32:53] just hold fast cus you know we're just
[32:56] we're just dealing with the footman
[32:57] right now we are your weight to the
[33:00] horses and the chariots come but you
[33:03] know there's nothing that we have to
[33:05] fear because we trust the law I mean
[33:08] think about the thousands upon thousands
[33:11] of people that Israel had to fight and
[33:14] yet they won the battle with the handful
[33:16] because the Lord fought the battle for
[33:19] them and when I see God fighting the
[33:21] battle for Israel it's as well as wicked
[33:28] as they could be at times I gives me a
[33:31] little hope I know the God the Lord
[33:35] Jesus loved me and you know that's one
[33:38] of the things that I I know not that I I
[33:41] just love him but he loves me he has
[33:44] proven himself to me and I say it like
[33:46] that not just for me but for all y'all
[33:48] we should know by now that the Lord
[33:50] loves you if he had passed judgment on
[33:54] us we wouldn't be here today but thank
[33:56] God for His grace and His mercy as we
[33:59] stand let us turn there second Peter the
[34:01] first chapter and we're just going to
[34:03] read the second verse to the tenth first
[34:08] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[34:10] through the knowledge of God and of
[34:12] Jesus our Lord
[34:14] according as his divine power have given
[34:16] unto us all things that pertain I
[34:19] understand that word given not will give
[34:22] has given it it's already done given
[34:25] unto us all things that pertain unto
[34:26] life and godliness through the knowledge
[34:32] of him that have called us to glory and
[34:35] virtue whereby are given unto us
[34:37] exceeding great and precious promises
[34:40] that by these you might be partakers of
[34:43] the divine nature having escaped the
[34:45] corruption that is in the world through
[34:47] lust and beside excuse beside this
[34:50] giving all diligence add to your faith
[34:52] virtue virtue knowledge to knowledge
[34:55] temperance temperance patience and
[34:57] patient but early kindness excuse me a
[35:00] patience garland excuse me and
[35:02] godly brotherly kindness and to
[35:04] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[35:07] things be in you and abound they make
[35:09] you that ye should neither be barren nor
[35:11] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[35:13] Jesus Christ but he that lack of these
[35:17] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[35:20] and hath forgotten that was forgotten
[35:22] that he was purged from his old sins
[35:26] wherefore the rather brethren give
[35:28] diligence to make yourself your calling
[35:30] and election sure for if you do these
[35:34] things you shall never fall for so an
[35:37] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[35:39] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[35:41] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[35:43] here's Peter talking about these things
[35:46] and he says I love that car where it
[35:48] says here an entrance shall be
[35:51] ministered unto you abundantly not
[35:54] sparingly or scarcely but abundantly and
[35:57] that's exactly what God has done
[35:59] let us pray father we thank you for your
[36:01] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[36:03] being good to us there are no words to
[36:07] express our gratitude as we stand in
[36:11] your podium your holy place today I
[36:14] stand in all a little fella like myself
[36:17] Lord not even worthy to call upon your
[36:20] name but your grace has found me and
[36:22] placed me in this position and father as
[36:25] we stand here in your stead we pray Lord
[36:28] God this evening that you would speak to
[36:31] us Lord sanctify us holy let the fire of
[36:34] God come through our lips Lord and and
[36:37] burn everything unbelief whatever is not
[36:41] not of you out of us Lord that you may
[36:43] be glorified may your Holy Spirit Lord
[36:46] just in campus over floors Lord as David
[36:49] said let my cup my cup runneth over
[36:52] oh God and I just pray Lord that you are
[36:54] glorified tonight and that you have will
[36:58] receive our offering and our sacrifice
[37:01] is Lord tonight to your glory in Jesus
[37:04] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[37:07] seated as we were talking this morning
[37:12] of speaking this morning uh I I if we
[37:16] No if we could see the seals and what
[37:19] brother madam said about the four horse
[37:22] riders you got to understand when Paul
[37:25] said we wrestle not against flesh and
[37:27] blood but spiritual wickedness in high
[37:30] places to give you a better
[37:31] understanding on what we are working
[37:33] with brother Bentham tells us by God's
[37:36] grace that every time Satan would
[37:41] dispatch one of his warriors or his
[37:45] spirits to come back or come against the
[37:48] church God would always release one of
[37:51] his and we know when the Antichrist
[37:54] spirit was released amen in during the
[37:57] time of the emphasis age we know that
[38:00] God did a thing and he brought forth
[38:02] Paul who represented the lion and we
[38:05] understand by God's grace it was a
[38:07] battle between Antichrist spirit and a
[38:12] lion now understand Paul was not just a
[38:15] reformer but Paul was also a prophet so
[38:19] therefore God had at the beginning had
[38:22] to release a prophet that could see this
[38:24] Antichrist spirit because had not Paul
[38:28] identified it I don't really believe all
[38:30] of the others would have seen it as
[38:33] clearly remind you Paul was the
[38:36] messenger of the Ephesus age so as we
[38:40] listen to brother Branham these people
[38:43] listen to brother Paul because they
[38:45] realized that Paul had a special
[38:47] anointing on him and Paul basically
[38:49] wrote according it to historians and I
[38:53] believe it almost all of the New
[38:55] Testament and so we know that Paul the
[38:58] word of the Lord comes to the Prophet
[39:01] according to Amos 3:7 so you and I
[39:04] realized by God's grace that God
[39:06] dispatched this knowing thing where Paul
[39:10] his letters were telling the people to
[39:13] beware that when he would leave off the
[39:16] scene false prophets and and everything
[39:20] would come on the scene and how the
[39:21] Antichrist spirit would come posing as
[39:24] the Spirit of Christ and Paul exalt the
[39:28] people he said whatever you do you
[39:30] contend for the faith that means you've
[39:32] got to fight Amen to keep it alive and
[39:37] so we realize they meant that after this
[39:39] Antichrist spirit introduced the deed of
[39:42] the Nicolaitans that deed became a
[39:44] doctrine and all of a sudden when it
[39:47] became a doctrine it also became a
[39:49] murderer it began to in Smyrna I began
[39:52] to persecute all a men who disagreed
[39:55] with their teachings and so you realized
[39:58] amen
[39:58] all of this was based upon jealousy
[40:00] let's go back to Lucifer even in the
[40:03] beginning he was jealous of Micah and he
[40:06] was jealous of God it all jealousy and
[40:08] when you find a Christian that just
[40:10] don't like you and have no reason not to
[40:12] like you it's always jealousy it is a
[40:15] spirit of Antichrist it's not Christ
[40:18] that makes you behave yourself like that
[40:21] so and the Bible tells us that spirit of
[40:24] jealousy will also became a murderer
[40:25] right it will kill you if it's not with
[40:30] your words it would kill you physically
[40:32] so this Antichrist spirit has been
[40:34] running for a long time now it has been
[40:37] sealed up it had been sealed up nobody
[40:39] understood it and nobody knew what it
[40:41] was all about throughout all history
[40:44] from Genesis all the way up it was
[40:47] sealed up and you know brother Branham
[40:49] tells us that every he said from Genesis
[40:51] all the way up you can see the church
[40:53] ages every every every stage had at
[40:56] church ages and they had the same
[40:59] spirits they had the war against but
[41:01] they never knew what it was and so when
[41:04] when when the devil tried to come to the
[41:07] word and and I think about how now here
[41:09] it is the devil came to Eve and he
[41:12] talked to her he teaches her he's the
[41:13] Antichrist he's against the word he gets
[41:16] her to believe it it becomes a doctrine
[41:18] is that right they've performed this
[41:20] word they did what the doctrines they do
[41:23] and what did they bring forth death
[41:25] right and so now we find out they try
[41:28] this doctrine as I said well I'll cause
[41:31] you to produce something just like the
[41:33] word causes you to produce something the
[41:35] word causes you to produce life and and
[41:38] and and and the Antichrist causes you to
[41:42] produce a false doctrine
[41:44] right a false covering a false religion
[41:48] and so when Christ I love this because
[41:51] remember when when Luther came on the
[41:53] scene he was the intellectual he was the
[41:55] smart guy and he was able to see
[41:58] something different that it wasn't my
[42:00] works because remember amen the doctrine
[42:03] that gate that Adam and Eve received
[42:06] from this false Antichrist spirit
[42:09] produced works they thought that they
[42:12] could save themselves so they put a
[42:14] religion around them right but then here
[42:17] come God comes along like a man with the
[42:20] intelligence and says where are you Adam
[42:23] where are you and then he goes on and
[42:26] says now who told you you were naked
[42:28] right so at that time Adam and Eve that
[42:33] you know because we remember when that
[42:35] Devil came to them and gave them the
[42:38] word of a false word the Bible said when
[42:41] they did what he said then their eyes
[42:44] were open you see it was a false
[42:48] revelation it was a false understanding
[42:51] of the word but the box is now their
[42:54] eyes were open yes open to good and evil
[42:57] now they know they dealing with not only
[42:59] Christ but I Anti Christ but watch
[43:02] Christ comes along and he identifies
[43:04] them and he says who told you you see
[43:07] where it goes it now know this whole
[43:11] scene comes right back to the devil the
[43:13] serpent the devil told me so now and
[43:19] then you see the seals you see the you
[43:21] see they did the very word of God
[43:25] combating and man and then what did God
[43:29] do the same thing he did in this day we
[43:32] would not have seen the Antichrist
[43:34] spirit as closely as we see it now
[43:37] because we all were clothed with
[43:40] religion we all had our garments spotted
[43:45] we all were what would you say some
[43:47] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian whatever
[43:50] it was our figleaves
[43:52] but we had a prophet like jesus said
[43:54] unto adam and eve you got
[43:57] nothing this stuff that you got won't
[43:58] work it's not acceptable bow before God
[44:01] you need some blood and what did Jesus
[44:05] do amen did y'all know that the voice
[44:08] that walked in the cool of the evening
[44:10] was Christ and he comes along and he
[44:14] gives them a coat a lambskin with blood
[44:20] right now here over here they think that
[44:24] will be accepted because they were able
[44:26] to build religion and and it looks
[44:29] beautiful like Cain he had everything
[44:32] lined up in a row you know requires
[44:34] everything looked beautiful and they
[44:36] thought that it would be accepted but
[44:41] the only thing even in the beginning
[44:43] that was accepted is the blood of Jesus
[44:45] Christ and Luther found the key and said
[44:49] the just shall live by faith
[44:51] right it didn't stop the persecution it
[44:55] did not stop the false vine for growing
[44:58] it kept on growing and you and I know
[45:00] that what happened what which is what
[45:02] happening right now many boys and girls
[45:05] are finding other how can I say it just
[45:09] like they did in the days of Noah the
[45:11] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[45:13] that they were fair and they took upon
[45:16] them wives they didn't marry them and
[45:18] what did they do produce Giants and it
[45:22] was a plot in a scheme of the mother
[45:24] church to get her daughters to marry the
[45:27] sons of God what was it it was to make
[45:31] more of them y'all know that to be true
[45:34] so we realized amen what did it do it
[45:37] produced Giants now these Giants
[45:40] remember they always every time brother
[45:42] Branham referred to Giants is always
[45:44] intellectual Giants so you know now
[45:48] we're not a dealing with Goliath as far
[45:50] as a statue we're dealing with Goliath
[45:53] as intelligence amen to out with the
[45:58] devil you must know and have a
[46:00] revelation from the Lord right you
[46:04] listen that's what the prophets said
[46:05] when the bride of Jesus Christ come to
[46:08] identify the two spirits that
[46:10] works within the framework of church
[46:12] amen
[46:14] she will become an invincible army there
[46:19] is only two spirits in the framework of
[46:21] the church and that is Christ and the
[46:24] Antichrist and the Antichrist will
[46:27] always make you feel religious God don't
[46:30] want religious he want to see the blood
[46:33] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[46:36] you and it always always remember Amen
[46:41] that what happened was is that remember
[46:44] after Cain went out and started his
[46:46] organization and everything else ah you
[46:50] know who he started you know the front
[46:52] one of the first thing they did they
[46:54] they got into beautiful women read your
[46:57] Bible women weren't even mentioned until
[47:00] Cain see stop producing these beautiful
[47:02] women and it was all in the scheme of
[47:06] the devil down the road he knew that
[47:08] these beautiful women will become the
[47:10] sons of God saw wives right and remember
[47:15] the prophet of God said he said that
[47:16] when they went out and did that he said
[47:18] God never forgave them and you can
[47:21] preach this to your children all day
[47:23] long if God don't give them any ideas to
[47:25] hear and eyes to see they're gonna do it
[47:27] anyway you and I cannot say one of our
[47:30] children we can't say one we can't even
[47:35] save ourselves God is the savior
[47:39] salvation belongs to the Lord is that
[47:44] right and if God choose to give you a
[47:47] esau gain glory be to God what they were
[47:53] going to say Lord
[47:54] how come you give me a Jacob and Esau
[47:56] God does what he wants to do all we can
[48:00] do is have faith and believe for them
[48:02] but at the end of the day God knows them
[48:05] that are here so you and I must
[48:07] understand by God's grace amen there is
[48:10] a characteristic we I get more and more
[48:14] and more and more excited about what God
[48:18] has done and it's sitting right under
[48:20] our nose all God is saying in order for
[48:23] this cake to work
[48:24] follow the recipe right none of us can
[48:28] add one cubit to our statue but when we
[48:31] submit that is the key submit to the
[48:35] word and I'm gonna tell you something to
[48:37] release evil is painful especially if
[48:45] it's an evil that you love and people
[48:49] don't want to admit that they might
[48:52] still have some love for worldly things
[48:57] but God would challenge you but God
[49:02] never challenged you without giving you
[49:05] a reward when you overcome is that right
[49:10] oh yes he knows what you like he knows
[49:13] what you are addicted to and he tells
[49:15] you overcome it and what is it about
[49:20] that is that you and I must know that
[49:23] God will work with your will till you
[49:28] can't go - Lord - Lord Lord you know I
[49:30] really don't like doing it then you
[49:31] continually do it you lying to yourself
[49:35] hallelujah
[49:36] what you need to do is as Lord I enjoyed
[49:39] this my flesh enjoy this but your words
[49:42] sense and man does not live by bread
[49:45] alone but by every word that proceeds
[49:47] out of the mouth of God and my lord I am
[49:51] submitting myself as Christ submitted
[49:54] himself in the garden not my will but
[49:56] let thy will be done
[49:58] crucify me whatever it takes to produce
[50:01] the will of God is what we ought to be
[50:04] willing to do don't even think is gonna
[50:08] be easy not on you because of your will
[50:12] we have a strong will you know our worst
[50:15] enemy is our wheel but God knows of you
[50:20] surrender that you surrender in your
[50:22] being you surrender yourself to him and
[50:26] that's what God wants he wants
[50:28] submission is that right he tests the
[50:32] cane on his will he gave Cain an option
[50:37] tested came on his will and came refused
[50:41] to submit his will to God's will and
[50:44] there he was therefore he was outcast
[50:47] that's the serpent they know to do right
[50:50] yet they don't do it is that the truth
[50:55] did you know even I've said this before
[50:57] it blows my mind if I could say like
[51:00] that forgive me for slaying Lord but let
[51:02] me say it like this it really shakes me
[51:05] when I know that the Pharisees in
[51:07] inherit and all of them knew he was a
[51:10] messiah yet it was there where they
[51:14] didn't want to lose their kingdom they
[51:17] didn't want to lose their position in
[51:19] society can you imagine them being in
[51:22] hell and the demons are tormenting them
[51:25] all you thought you was a high priest oh
[51:27] you thought you was a king
[51:29] enjoy your kingdom let atonement what
[51:36] atonement admit they had Jesus right in
[51:39] position they had a place to be saved
[51:41] and they walked away from it right now
[51:46] you and I we have a place to make a
[51:49] rapture I believe every one of us in
[51:51] here saying I believe we have given our
[51:52] hearts and life to the Lord but we're
[51:54] talking about rapturing material Noah
[51:58] Noah's are saved but Enoch was raptured
[52:02] with all my rapture material and when
[52:05] Rattray material are those who will walk
[52:09] with God so a Lord how could I walk with
[52:12] God God and His Word is one and he's
[52:16] given us a word of the hour
[52:20] hallelujah and he's all but I can't
[52:24] perform it if you just believe it if you
[52:29] love it so much that you want to do it
[52:33] hallelujah if you never come to that
[52:36] place where you see you're doing it God
[52:38] will measure it up as a whole because if
[52:42] you have a willing mind that's what the
[52:45] Bible says a willing mind to do it right
[52:48] God will accept it
[52:54] but we must be aware of the Antichrist
[52:57] the Antichrist comes in so many
[52:59] variations he he's a smart character you
[53:02] better believe he years and he'll come
[53:05] along and he'll come and here take your
[53:07] worship away and people that sit there
[53:11] don't even know that they're being
[53:12] influenced by the Antichrist because the
[53:16] prophet of God said wherever Jesus is
[53:18] there's a lot of noise and we'll come in
[53:22] and you know the devil said well you
[53:23] know you don't feel like worshiping you
[53:25] don't even feel like raising your head
[53:26] you know the song leaders ain't singing
[53:28] the song I won't hear on them they're
[53:29] saying
[53:31] we'll do that we'll go through these
[53:33] mind battles and not even know you
[53:36] wouldn't even have a battle if the
[53:38] Lucifer wasn't there if the devil wasn't
[53:41] there to talk to you you wouldn't have a
[53:43] mind battle you would come right in here
[53:45] in worship God but whenever you find
[53:48] something resisting you worshiping God
[53:51] thank for a moment who is this it is the
[53:56] devil and they will he said now don't
[53:59] you worship God ain't nobody else in
[54:01] here worshiping who cares I'm like the
[54:05] woman at Jesus feet nobody in Simon's
[54:09] house was worship it but I came to
[54:11] worship
[54:12] see that's what we must understand I
[54:15] don't care nobody else's hallelujah
[54:17] praising God and thank you Jesus because
[54:20] I realize I'm working against an
[54:22] antichrist spirit that do not want me to
[54:25] worship God why wouldn't he want you to
[54:28] worship God because the Bible says in
[54:31] the presence of the Lord there is
[54:33] fullness of joy he does not he don't
[54:37] want you to have that joy and the Bible
[54:41] says it is the anointing that destroy
[54:44] the yokes if you get Jesus on the scene
[54:47] he can break your yokes
[54:49] whatever your problems are God will
[54:52] solve them but you need an anointing do
[54:55] to do that not just the word we've had
[54:58] the word brother branham when he came on
[55:00] the scene he just didn't have the word
[55:02] he
[55:02] the anointing he had the anointing of
[55:05] the word it wasn't the man who was the
[55:08] anointing that destroyed the yokes
[55:11] then we supposed to have a double
[55:13] portion that's something you gotta jump
[55:17] up and down all the time but you come
[55:19] into worship you come into worship you
[55:22] know you don't come in to say well I
[55:24] wonder wonder wonder what he's going to
[55:25] preach I need something deep today yacht
[55:27] you need is something to live you come
[55:30] to hear the word to live you can't
[55:33] forget about how deep it is when the
[55:35] word comes you all to say am i living
[55:37] that because God knows the menu he knows
[55:42] exactly what you feed you look at all
[55:46] the deep things that have been said and
[55:47] done and people still can't live it I
[55:50] want to live it if I don't know nothing
[55:52] but my ABCs let me live ABC y'all
[55:55] understand me it ain't about all huh
[56:00] see God chose us because we were kind of
[56:02] dumb on this you know me look dumb
[56:03] animals you know we should see Papa do
[56:06] you we don't we don't do nothing we
[56:09] depend on his leadership we depend on
[56:12] his guidance we I do I depend on him
[56:21] that's how the Antichrist comes in
[56:24] Antichrist puffs you up the Antichrist
[56:28] try to make you feel like you better or
[56:30] something greater you're not we ain't
[56:32] nothing hallelujah Paul tried to explain
[56:37] and he said everything I ever learned
[56:39] everything I thought I knew I count it
[56:40] down all I'm interested in now is
[56:44] knowing Christ in the power of his
[56:46] resurrection I want to know the
[56:47] excellency of his power I want to excel
[56:51] in it somebody I don't want to just sit
[56:54] here as a nominal Christian we've got to
[56:56] move on up hallelujah with the authority
[56:59] and the power of the word and when the
[57:02] devil comes to shake your kingdom you
[57:04] ought to say devil this keeneland cannot
[57:06] be moved it cannot be moved hallelujah
[57:12] you said what do you say the word says
[57:14] this kingdom cannot
[57:16] be Moo listen first Peter 4:16 says yet
[57:22] if any man suffer as a Christian let him
[57:24] not be ashamed but let him glorify God
[57:27] on this behalf hallelujah when somebody
[57:30] are you holier than thou and they want
[57:32] to persecute you because you are
[57:33] Christian you're not supposed to drop
[57:35] your head in shame
[57:36] hallelujah say you oh you know what we
[57:38] need to do start doing the truth you
[57:40] know I don't know what you call them
[57:41] steps but anyways shuffle a little bit I
[57:43] saw I saw video of the Jewish people how
[57:47] they celebrate this new this are the
[57:49] eighth day I've got to call it I can
[57:51] pronounce the word and they doing just
[57:53] like we do I look at them and they're
[57:55] doing all this ok that's where it come
[57:58] from I said oh Lord
[58:01] this is wonderful a man the only thing
[58:03] they do we don't do we don't get it well
[58:05] yes we do we do it their ego Maj but you
[58:08] know you look and you see that the
[58:09] worship is basically the same God when
[58:12] the Holy Spirit is among you it will
[58:14] cause you to act the saying do the same
[58:17] and the Bible says Emma for the time has
[58:20] come the judgment must begin at the
[58:21] house of God and if it first beginning
[58:24] us what shall the end of them that obey
[58:26] not the gospel of God you know what what
[58:30] people don't understand is that even at
[58:34] the judgment they're going to be so
[58:37] judged by the Queen of the South God
[58:42] working with women and women is a high
[58:45] trophy for God because they were
[58:48] deceived and brother ben said if a woman
[58:49] overcoming this age she gets twice as
[58:52] much as a man and guess what then God
[58:55] comes along and takes the Queen of the
[58:58] South and sets her there to judge a
[59:02] woman becomes a judge in the kingdom of
[59:08] God hello you say that
[59:11] maybe then who will you you liken unto a
[59:14] woman but the Bible said the Queen of
[59:17] the South will judge all these people
[59:21] who say they live too far and they could
[59:24] not make it to church when Queen of
[59:29] Sheba
[59:30] traveled throughout the devil desert
[59:33] hallelujah Amen pending dangerous when
[59:40] when she got the church guess what folks
[59:42] she did not fall asleep I know we get
[59:48] tired don't get me wrong I'm not talking
[59:50] about the faithful I hate to talk about
[59:51] that but some people come to church and
[59:53] they literally mark their chair at least
[59:58] it seems that way but nevertheless my
[1:00:01] point is she made it I don't know how
[1:00:05] tired she was but she learned I don't
[1:00:08] know how tired she was but she kept her
[1:00:15] enemy made you do that see you sir and
[1:00:20] why weak amen enough amen to understand
[1:00:25] that this man Solomon was not an
[1:00:27] ordinary man uh-huh
[1:00:30] and let me tell you something there's so
[1:00:31] many people in this message still
[1:00:33] believe that brother Branham was just an
[1:00:34] ordinary man he was more than a man if
[1:00:39] you handle him like our ordinary man you
[1:00:41] gonna look for mistakes that all but he
[1:00:46] was ordained of God anointed of God and
[1:00:52] the very words that God wanted us to
[1:00:55] hear in this generation he spoke them oh
[1:01:01] I almost late leap now but I'm you know
[1:01:04] that sealing but nevertheless you and I
[1:01:06] must understand it must be perfect hmm
[1:01:13] it must be
[1:01:14] in order to go to heaven you must be
[1:01:18] perfect is that right the Bible said be
[1:01:21] perfect but wait for your father which
[1:01:25] is in heaven is perfect how are you
[1:01:27] going to be perfect you can't do it you
[1:01:31] don't have the means to do it as the
[1:01:33] Prophet God said we were born failures
[1:01:35] but there is a Holy Ghost there is a way
[1:01:40] and the Prophet God said if God require
[1:01:43] you to be her perfect he must make a way
[1:01:45] for you to be perfect
[1:01:47] that's what Calvary was all about that's
[1:01:50] what the blood is all about and now we
[1:01:52] realize he meant that we're fishing on
[1:01:55] the bloody bleeding Word of God and what
[1:01:57] is happening we are now partakers of
[1:02:00] God's divine nature is that the truth
[1:02:04] you say although I have love yes you
[1:02:07] have love you came even have faith
[1:02:09] without love and when you have faith is
[1:02:13] because God has dropped his love into
[1:02:16] your heart and that love you see it
[1:02:19] gotta be the same half an Omega must be
[1:02:22] the same love in the foundation and love
[1:02:26] as the capstone is that right that's
[1:02:29] what the Bible says this same stone God
[1:02:34] has made that once was the caller has
[1:02:37] become what the head of the corner right
[1:02:40] so it bends God so loved the world right
[1:02:44] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:02:48] not perish so you've gotta have love in
[1:02:51] order to have faith because out of love
[1:02:54] come faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:02:56] and then at the end of the road
[1:02:58] God crowns it oh yeah he crowns that
[1:03:05] love it must be that way the seed of God
[1:03:11] is love is that the truth
[1:03:14] so if the seed of God is love it's just
[1:03:17] like any plant it grows up out of the
[1:03:20] ground it doesn't look like the same
[1:03:22] thing act a little seed it breaks
[1:03:25] opening a little stem grows up it
[1:03:27] doesn't
[1:03:28] like the seed it grows up with the
[1:03:31] leaves and the tassels and everything
[1:03:33] else but the life that was in that seed
[1:03:35] is in all those stages of growth and at
[1:03:40] the end of it the revealing of what it
[1:03:43] is
[1:03:44] what quit was placed in the ground is
[1:03:46] now will will be revealed at the
[1:03:49] maturing of the plant am I making sense
[1:03:52] so love had to be put in the seat it was
[1:03:56] a seed of love and when it was quick and
[1:03:59] that's why when you first got saved and
[1:04:01] gave your heart to the Lord you felt
[1:04:02] like you could love everything the
[1:04:04] butterflies were beautiful the birds
[1:04:06] sang beautiful everything saying why it
[1:04:08] was love but didn't love produce faith
[1:04:11] say produce aren't you furniture produce
[1:04:14] knowledge all the way up to brotherly
[1:04:16] kindness its maturing it's coming back
[1:04:20] to the original seed it's coming back to
[1:04:23] the thing that it was when it went down
[1:04:25] in the ground is that right and then at
[1:04:29] the end of the day you are totally loved
[1:04:32] full of it but now you've been living
[1:04:36] seed the Living Word manifesting
[1:04:40] everything that Christ is that right
[1:04:42] because Jesus Christ was the very seed
[1:04:44] of God whoo come on somebody see and
[1:04:49] that's that's where the Satan comes he
[1:04:52] brings in division Eve among the message
[1:04:55] people and they don't even see it well
[1:04:58] if you don't belong to my little message
[1:04:59] church then you ain't really a brother
[1:05:02] you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:05:03] people have they don't say it but they
[1:05:06] have this little spirit behind them and
[1:05:08] they don't even know where she I go to
[1:05:09] this brother's church and he's deep you
[1:05:12] know I'm saying I'm the old God deep
[1:05:16] deep there's nobody greater no deeper
[1:05:22] than Jesus could ever be jesus said love
[1:05:25] thy neighbor as thyself that's deep
[1:05:28] that's what you call deep
[1:05:35] now that's deep how'd you gonna love
[1:05:38] your neighbor as yourself but that's
[1:05:40] what Jesus said you must do hey man let
[1:05:43] me read that Matthew 5 38 48 he says you
[1:05:48] have heard that it had been said an eye
[1:05:49] for an eye and a tooth for tooth but I
[1:05:53] said to you that ye resist not evil
[1:05:56] no but whatsoever show but whosoever
[1:05:59] shall smite thee on the right cheek turn
[1:06:02] to him the other also people have never
[1:06:05] figured that out yet they've tried to
[1:06:09] say does he mean that symbolically does
[1:06:11] he really mean that he means exactly
[1:06:14] what he said somebody slap you in the
[1:06:18] face you do what you talk I see what I'm
[1:06:24] trying to say that's real love did not
[1:06:27] Jesus do it they smoked him in the face
[1:06:30] they spit in his face and at the end of
[1:06:34] the day he still say Father forgive them
[1:06:36] for they know not what they do he did
[1:06:40] not see the people himself
[1:06:42] he saw the enemy in which he was working
[1:06:45] with and you and I must start seeing the
[1:06:48] devil and not our brothers and our
[1:06:50] sisters right listen he goes on to say
[1:06:56] but I say unto you that ye resist not
[1:06:59] evil right don't resist it oh come on
[1:07:05] Lord I'm talking about the statue of a
[1:07:09] perfect man
[1:07:10] if Jesus ordered these things were not
[1:07:12] so supposed to resist evil I'm gonna let
[1:07:15] you walk all over me like that you think
[1:07:17] I'm a fool no you know how we talked or
[1:07:19] used to talk and my thing if we don't
[1:07:22] talk if we think it you know you must
[1:07:25] think I'm crazy just let you walk all
[1:07:27] over me
[1:07:27] right he said don't resist and you will
[1:07:32] cheat on what we don't see is that when
[1:07:34] we don't resist when we do what he says
[1:07:37] it's a growth like I told you growth is
[1:07:41] when you can it not it doesn't come in
[1:07:43] times they're easy as when you're
[1:07:45] challenged mmm
[1:07:49] Peter didn't fight oh no you're not
[1:07:51] gonna crucify me uh he didn't go through
[1:07:54] all of that Peter went on right to it
[1:07:56] and says hey let me tell you something
[1:07:59] I'm not worthy to be crucified like my
[1:08:01] lord haha crowd turned me upside down he
[1:08:06] did not resist the evil Christians we
[1:08:15] all need help we need some more growing
[1:08:19] and it's okay but this is what the word
[1:08:23] comes it comes to show us where we are
[1:08:25] so that we could better prepare remember
[1:08:27] I read the quote last week how it was
[1:08:30] through sweetness and meekness to me
[1:08:34] that that was just that was an atomic
[1:08:37] bomb in itself to know that I can whip
[1:08:41] the devil with sweetness and meekness
[1:08:44] that's what confuses him when he comes
[1:08:47] at you and all the sweetness and
[1:08:49] meekness he does either huh no that's
[1:08:51] too much love for me ah he can't handle
[1:08:53] it and if any man will sue thee at the
[1:08:58] law and take away that coat let him have
[1:09:01] that cloak also
[1:09:02] that's a big one whosoever it's the word
[1:09:07] the word and whosoever shall compel thee
[1:09:10] to go a mile go with him Twain that's a
[1:09:12] word that's a big one give to him that
[1:09:15] asketh thee and from him that would
[1:09:17] borrow of thee turn not thou away woo I
[1:09:21] want you to hear what I'm saying what
[1:09:23] the Lord is saying see you have heard
[1:09:26] that had been said thou shalt love thy
[1:09:28] neighbor and hate the enemy but I say
[1:09:32] unto you love your enemies bless them
[1:09:34] that curse you do good to them that hate
[1:09:37] you pray for them that witch's Paislee
[1:09:39] use use you and persecute you oh that's
[1:09:44] that's when you're not resisting well I
[1:09:50] say
[1:09:50] Lord send down the fire no that's not
[1:09:54] what we're doing it must be perfect we
[1:09:59] must be the exact example and reflection
[1:10:01] of Jesus Christ himself right listen
[1:10:07] that ye may be children of your father
[1:10:08] he said to all of this that you may be
[1:10:11] children of your father which is in
[1:10:13] heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on
[1:10:17] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[1:10:20] rain on the just and on the unjust and
[1:10:23] if you love them which love you what
[1:10:25] reward have ye he said if you love your
[1:10:29] enemy there's a reward for it do not
[1:10:32] even the public's the same and if you
[1:10:34] should loot your brethren only what do
[1:10:36] you do more what ye more than others do
[1:10:39] not even the publicans so but be eat but
[1:10:43] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:10:46] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:10:48] he basically said when you allow
[1:10:50] yourself to come to need let me tell
[1:10:52] y'all something now I really believe
[1:10:54] maybe I'm wrong but when the squeeze
[1:10:56] come these scriptures what I just read
[1:10:59] will come I will come alive because what
[1:11:05] did he tell it Peter Peter that's not
[1:11:07] the sword I want you to fight with if
[1:11:09] you fight fight with the fork sword you
[1:11:11] will die by the sword
[1:11:13] right this is not and what did Jesus do
[1:11:16] to show what he meant by it he took the
[1:11:20] man here put it back on him and he undid
[1:11:25] what Peter did took away the evidence so
[1:11:30] Peter couldn't get locked up you
[1:11:33] understand me and so what did he do he
[1:11:35] often in an hour of violence he brought
[1:11:39] peace that's Christianity it must be
[1:11:45] perfect
[1:11:46] help us Jesus I want to be that way it's
[1:11:49] all my heart I want to be just like that
[1:11:56] to me that's awesome to me that what a
[1:11:59] real that's what a real that's what a
[1:12:02] real Christian is a one who can
[1:12:05] withstand and withstand evil become the
[1:12:08] very standard no matter what Satan does
[1:12:11] he stands and and you know like the
[1:12:15] Prophet God's saying having that
[1:12:16] undisturbed faith but this come by
[1:12:20] prayer Romans 12 he says listen I
[1:12:26] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[1:12:27] mercies of God and I read that this
[1:12:29] morning that you present your bodies a
[1:12:30] living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[1:12:33] God which is your reasonable service and
[1:12:35] be not conformed to the world but be
[1:12:37] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:39] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:12:42] faithful
[1:12:42] how many acceptable and perfect will of
[1:12:44] God there it is again God must renew our
[1:12:48] minds he must change us remember I told
[1:12:52] you that Antichrist spirit will always
[1:12:53] lift you up and make you feel like your
[1:12:56] Lord and what you really are and us
[1:12:59] preachers we have to be careful we don't
[1:13:01] mind you said oh that's good I thank the
[1:13:03] Lord for you but if you're not careful
[1:13:04] amen that spirit will lift you when it
[1:13:08] comes to singers it's the same way oh
[1:13:10] you are nobody keeps saying like you all
[1:13:13] of that's good but if a person is not
[1:13:15] prayed up in a spiritual mind that
[1:13:19] Antichrist spirit will make you think
[1:13:21] you're something you know is that right
[1:13:24] but I Lucifer thought he was something
[1:13:27] God made him the most beautiful angel up
[1:13:29] there and he just thought he was number
[1:13:31] woman and all of that and look what it
[1:13:32] did what all of his children it's the
[1:13:34] same way you got to understand we're
[1:13:37] living in the age of Lucifer and all of
[1:13:40] his children is thinking about iPhones
[1:13:42] and I this and I said you know it's all
[1:13:44] I write and it's significance of
[1:13:50] something brothers and sisters you know
[1:13:52] because it's not a I it's him it
[1:13:57] all about him it's nothing about us all
[1:14:01] this that we do go for the glory of God
[1:14:04] and him only
[1:14:13] you love the Lord understand that these
[1:14:16] four beasts that I would go back to that
[1:14:18] understand of the four beasts that was
[1:14:20] right and became a pale horse it came
[1:14:23] into a place Amen that it began to
[1:14:25] arrive throughout all the ages right now
[1:14:30] watch this because this thing is coming
[1:14:32] alive again
[1:14:34] right now right now laws are in place
[1:14:37] and they can't just kill you and
[1:14:40] persecute you but don't forget the Beast
[1:14:45] is in its place and once all these laws
[1:14:49] are changed because remember the Bible
[1:14:52] tells us that he's going to change all
[1:14:54] the laws and the laws will be changed
[1:14:59] persecution will come on all who reject
[1:15:03] the Council of Churches and everything
[1:15:06] that's part of it what is that the
[1:15:10] manifestation of King the manifestation
[1:15:13] of Judas all of Satan's evil forces will
[1:15:18] come against what we call the bride
[1:15:20] brother Branham said it was those demons
[1:15:23] out of the river of Euphrates amen and
[1:15:26] he said when those you nervous of you
[1:15:28] came up though when that bottom that pit
[1:15:31] was open he said what happened those
[1:15:33] demons came out and it anointed who
[1:15:36] Hitler Mussolini right and Stalin and
[1:15:42] look at the gruesome things that they
[1:15:45] did to those Jews and it's coming again
[1:15:48] and he said when they love Hitler they
[1:15:52] came to the west coast and they occupy
[1:15:55] Hollywood that's why you see all the
[1:16:00] wicked stuff of Hollywood hell coming up
[1:16:02] out of Hollywood all of the perverse
[1:16:05] things and everything else comes out of
[1:16:07] Hollywood even your president comes out
[1:16:10] of Hollywood and let me tell you
[1:16:12] something people of God he might look
[1:16:15] like a Cyrus to you but let me say it
[1:16:17] like this at the end of the day he has
[1:16:20] come to do the work of Satan
[1:16:24] you might not agree with me but you're
[1:16:26] gonna see because no good thing comes
[1:16:29] from there don't get me wrong he did you
[1:16:35] know what what I'm trying to say
[1:16:36] Nebuchadnezzar was anointed - he was a
[1:16:39] real vessel of God he did what God
[1:16:41] wanted him to do but he was not a vessel
[1:16:45] of Honor Moses and Pharaoh Pharaoh did
[1:16:50] everything God wanted him to do release
[1:16:52] the children and everything else but he
[1:16:54] was not a vessel of honor right now
[1:16:58] we're dealing with Christ and Antichrist
[1:17:00] hmm and understand how president vowed
[1:17:04] himself to the Catholic Church so what
[1:17:06] you're gonna say about that so you and I
[1:17:08] must understand thank God for all the
[1:17:10] good things he's doing but don't get
[1:17:13] your eyes don't get mixed up he's come
[1:17:16] and he's beautiful it's a tool to help
[1:17:17] God drive us to our knees please slow
[1:17:22] for people God requires perfection we
[1:17:31] want to bear that in mind that there is
[1:17:33] nothing just Padraig talking can go in
[1:17:37] the presence of God nothing part way it
[1:17:39] must be perfect I worship everything hmm
[1:17:46] now in the god of eating God had Adam
[1:17:49] and Eve in the garden and they sinned
[1:17:51] and transgressed the laws of God by
[1:17:54] sinning disobedience and when
[1:17:56] transgression comes disobedience is the
[1:17:59] transgression of the law and the law of
[1:18:01] God him being holy just unadulterated
[1:18:04] holy therefore no spots of hardened
[1:18:07] holiness can ever stand in his presence
[1:18:10] so if sin came in the world by
[1:18:13] transgression then sin must be dealt
[1:18:16] with before the sinner can ever stand in
[1:18:21] the presence of God now
[1:18:25] there is no law there is no justice but
[1:18:28] law requires or justice requires a law
[1:18:30] and law when it is called on it projects
[1:18:34] justice now by the law no flesh is saved
[1:18:38] now that's the law cannot save us the
[1:18:41] law was just the thing that put us in
[1:18:44] jail but it was no redeeming power the
[1:18:47] law only showed us that we were sinners
[1:18:50] and condemned us that's what law is to
[1:18:54] do it brings condemnation or to show you
[1:18:58] you were mistake is so the law in itself
[1:19:01] could not say it could only persecute
[1:19:04] and God being holy and just he had to
[1:19:08] have a persecution he had to persecute
[1:19:13] the sinner because he had overstepped
[1:19:15] the boundaries of grace and had become a
[1:19:18] law breaking citizen then he must be
[1:19:21] dealt with and every law has a penalty
[1:19:25] for the penalty of transgressions God's
[1:19:28] law is death and it had to project death
[1:19:32] to turn the human race and all of the
[1:19:35] human race is under the penalty of this
[1:19:37] law and now when Adam and Eve have
[1:19:39] sinned and there was no way no other
[1:19:41] remedy that they could ever stand in the
[1:19:44] presence of God again except this sin be
[1:19:47] dealt with and no man can commit a sin
[1:19:50] of any type no matter how little or how
[1:19:53] big that individual sin has to be dealt
[1:19:57] with before the one who committed it can
[1:20:00] ever stand in the presence of the holy
[1:20:02] God come on somebody there's got to be
[1:20:07] somebody with the spirit of Hitler on
[1:20:09] them in our day and Hitler's
[1:20:14] idea was to make the Germans great again
[1:20:19] and the things that are being done now
[1:20:21] I'm speaking spiritually and the things
[1:20:24] that are being done now are the same
[1:20:26] things that were being done in Hitler's
[1:20:28] day there were some people wise enough
[1:20:31] to escape but I want you to know Hitler
[1:20:35] had a joint a covenant with the Catholic
[1:20:37] Church - I saw it on YouTube with a man
[1:20:43] say he's gonna be lawyer to them hello
[1:20:47] somebody
[1:20:47] so I'm just trying to tell you I'm
[1:20:50] bringing out spirits not people I'm
[1:20:51] letting you know what we're dealing with
[1:20:53] I've got German friends who didn't even
[1:20:56] know what Hitler had done to the wall
[1:20:58] was over because we're dealing with
[1:21:04] spirits and you and I must understand
[1:21:08] that brother Branham did not tell us
[1:21:10] that those spirits of the euphrates came
[1:21:12] to America for us to have a little
[1:21:14] knowledge they came to do a work and
[1:21:20] they come to do what brother Brennan
[1:21:23] said they were loosed on the bride they
[1:21:28] come to attack us and the saddest part
[1:21:32] about it when they think they got us
[1:21:34] we're going yeah amen ah it'll be the
[1:21:38] foolish virgins who would get the wrath
[1:21:41] of this generation that God would pour
[1:21:44] out his wrath - it won't be us Jesus
[1:21:48] escaped it Moses escaped it and so were
[1:21:51] we
[1:21:52] and when Adam and Eve had sinned there
[1:21:55] was no way no other remedy that they
[1:21:57] could ever stand in the presence of God
[1:21:58] again except this sin be dealt with
[1:22:02] no man can commit a sin of any type no
[1:22:05] matter how little or how big that
[1:22:07] individual sin had to be dealt with
[1:22:10] before the one who committed it could
[1:22:13] ever stand in the presence of holy God
[1:22:15] now you got to understand the bow said
[1:22:17] if you have broken a lot of the
[1:22:20] commandments you have done them all
[1:22:25] unbelief
[1:22:26] every sin there is and there is no way
[1:22:32] that you can sit there and tell anybody
[1:22:35] there is no I'd never do that yeah-huh
[1:22:40] the only way that you'll never do it is
[1:22:42] God keep you cuz he's the keeper of the
[1:22:44] soul but I tell you what you said you
[1:22:47] might not willfully do it but there are
[1:22:49] times people have had guns in place
[1:22:50] today it and somehow they will changed
[1:22:54] y'all understand me the only person that
[1:22:58] can keep you is God
[1:23:00] so therefore when Adam and Eve had
[1:23:03] sinned and had transgressed the law they
[1:23:05] were subject subject to death and the
[1:23:07] law had to execute had to be executed
[1:23:11] therefore it put the human race under
[1:23:13] the penalty of death now if we could
[1:23:15] only settle down for a few moments now
[1:23:17] you said I want to be I'm going back to
[1:23:19] the horse riders Satan comes to steal
[1:23:22] kill and destroy and that's exactly what
[1:23:26] happens when you see a church a church
[1:23:29] is a mother and she's supposed to be
[1:23:32] giving out life not death she's not the
[1:23:37] kill or steal but she's here to give
[1:23:41] people life that they may have it more
[1:23:43] abundantly she is Jesus Christ on earth
[1:23:46] today but look at the churches what are
[1:23:52] they doing they stealing from the people
[1:23:54] they're spiritually killing the people
[1:23:57] and destroying them selling their souls
[1:24:00] straight to hell but the New Jerusalem
[1:24:04] she is the mother of all living
[1:24:09] that's what this message come to do not
[1:24:12] to run people away not to make them feel
[1:24:14] indifferent not to Amen criticize them
[1:24:17] remember we came here to bring them life
[1:24:19] and if we're not giving life to the
[1:24:22] people amen we are missing the whole
[1:24:25] calling of what we're here to do mr.
[1:24:29] truth it is the Antichrist that brings
[1:24:31] death and this church is supposed to
[1:24:34] bring life that's why you and I must it
[1:24:37] meant climb the ladder that God has for
[1:24:39] us
[1:24:40] it is the only way we'll bring life if
[1:24:43] he is the fountain of life and we put
[1:24:45] took up that life we've become the
[1:24:47] fountain of life he said out of you out
[1:24:51] of your belly with flow rivers of living
[1:24:53] water
[1:24:54] where are the waters am I making sense I
[1:25:02] just want to say by the grace of God the
[1:25:05] Israelites just discovered this this new
[1:25:07] they just had a real red heifer boiling
[1:25:10] and y'all know about the red heifer I
[1:25:12] love it I love it I love it amen because
[1:25:14] I who just preached on that somebody
[1:25:16] here anyway I heard it somewhere but
[1:25:19] anyway I knew that message I've seen it
[1:25:21] but I been talking about the red heifer
[1:25:22] but the red heifer is what it is it is a
[1:25:25] female cow it's not a bull
[1:25:28] it's a heifer but how does a red heifer
[1:25:32] Amen types out Christ that red
[1:25:39] represents the blood is that right all
[1:25:47] right but why are you saying brother
[1:25:49] when I'm saying she was there when he
[1:25:53] went the cavalry she was there when he
[1:25:59] was struck when he got a lickin she was
[1:26:03] licking tushy but the Bible said I tread
[1:26:07] the winepress alone he says I but she
[1:26:11] was a part of the I see it wasn't Adams
[1:26:16] it was Adam and Eve was in Adam
[1:26:21] her name was Adam she was a part of him
[1:26:24] he was a part of her it was when God
[1:26:27] separated her she was to be weaker
[1:26:30] vessel but now she becomes him by way of
[1:26:35] Union hallelujah and she was bad that's
[1:26:39] why the prophet god said every victory
[1:26:41] Jesus Christ won you won Ventoux you
[1:26:45] were there that's why we will eat we the
[1:26:48] ones that were selected it meant for
[1:26:51] Atlantis here because we were
[1:26:53] there we were there Calvary and now amen
[1:26:59] this red heifer is a very significant
[1:27:02] part of the Jewish religion because he
[1:27:05] is also a sign of the returning of the
[1:27:08] Messiah
[1:27:13] until this bride get covered with blood
[1:27:15] I don't mean beaten blood I mean blood
[1:27:20] the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:27:23] understand me
[1:27:25] so you said what do you mean brother
[1:27:27] remember I preach not long ago when
[1:27:29] David amen
[1:27:30] wanted the Zion the Bible said
[1:27:33] nevertheless David took the stronghold
[1:27:35] of Zion the city same is the City of
[1:27:38] David did you know that Jerusalem Amen
[1:27:41] in Bethlehem all of them you know when
[1:27:43] when it came to them Jerusalem you know
[1:27:45] it uh it was it was it was it was it was
[1:27:49] it was occupied by the Japanese eyes did
[1:27:53] I preach that here I'm a preacher of the
[1:27:54] game if I hadn't but the jab you sites
[1:27:57] they were the offspring of giants and
[1:28:02] and in in this land where Jerusalem they
[1:28:06] also had a great valley and that valley
[1:28:08] was basically called the valley of death
[1:28:10] and in the way the Spain was set up the
[1:28:14] Jews ice a men are occupied the city
[1:28:19] that David wanted and he told who said
[1:28:22] he said whosoever whatever man
[1:28:24] that goes in and killed all of them even
[1:28:27] the lame and the blind the Bible said
[1:28:31] that David hated the lame in the blinds
[1:28:35] and his soul hated the daemon the blind
[1:28:38] but how can that be it's because it was
[1:28:41] a jab you sites that calls the lameness
[1:28:43] and the blindness so let's take it
[1:28:46] spiritually David wanted Jerusalem and
[1:28:49] you and I are Jerusalem but in the city
[1:28:55] of Jerusalem there not being a blind
[1:28:58] there not be any Lane let's take it all
[1:29:02] the way back what causes the blind and
[1:29:04] the lame the very Antichrist spirit that
[1:29:07] tewi is the cause of every blind in lane
[1:29:11] person and these giants let's go to the
[1:29:14] joins these Giants are intellectual
[1:29:16] Giants in the message that literally
[1:29:20] takes some of the quotes that brother
[1:29:21] Branham quoted and being what blind the
[1:29:24] people through their intelligence takes
[1:29:29] that very coat a man you know the hope
[1:29:31] out the Holy Ghost without sensation but
[1:29:33] they don't tell you about the life that
[1:29:35] you got to live how can you have the
[1:29:38] Holy Ghost ray if it doesn't have any
[1:29:40] sensation and you can't live it you
[1:29:43] still ain't got it
[1:29:45] give me the Holy Ghost with sensation if
[1:29:48] I got the life I don't mind without it
[1:29:51] without sensation and I live it that's
[1:29:53] all is about but now we find out that
[1:29:56] people what did the devil do to his
[1:29:58] shrewdness
[1:29:59] he brought death he brought a doctrine
[1:30:02] and now the people are naked again
[1:30:06] because you're naked if you're not
[1:30:08] clothed with the righteousness of God if
[1:30:11] you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:30:13] you are still naked and David said kill
[1:30:18] them all second Samuel v 7 through 10
[1:30:22] kill them all
[1:30:23] the men who captured the city I said
[1:30:26] Lord show me more he said in that New
[1:30:30] Jerusalem there'll be nothing that will
[1:30:33] defile the city that save David was
[1:30:37] shattering and typing out the New
[1:30:40] Jerusalem kill all you see that's what
[1:30:43] people don't understand these people who
[1:30:45] have been listening to these
[1:30:46] intellectual Giants what's happening
[1:30:48] their main their lame they can't even
[1:30:51] believe the gospel they're blind and
[1:30:53] what's happening now it is God the same
[1:30:56] David that's literally killing a Joab
[1:30:58] Joab killing everything amen often taken
[1:31:01] off everything that won't enter into the
[1:31:05] city of Jerusalem hmm
[1:31:11] my notes about joy at what his name was
[1:31:13] but some way I misplaced but I believe
[1:31:16] it means that Jehovah is God or Jehovah
[1:31:19] is our God something like that but what
[1:31:22] was your app doing he was actually now
[1:31:24] Joey I've messed up too but Joey was
[1:31:25] doing the will of God when he went and
[1:31:28] took took Jerusalem back from the
[1:31:30] Japanese ice hmm y'all didn't know that
[1:31:33] that Jerusalem used to be a Gentile city
[1:31:36] before it was the City of David hmm and
[1:31:40] now what's going to happen it's gonna be
[1:31:43] another gentle City a city with
[1:31:45] everybody there there'll be no Jew nor
[1:31:48] Greek is that right no Gentile barn are
[1:31:51] free
[1:31:51] hallelujah we'll all be there you said
[1:31:55] what brother bones what are you saying
[1:31:56] I'm saying this and all and all of us to
[1:31:59] make it up and I'm telling you I'm going
[1:32:01] through a lot of battles right now but
[1:32:03] now I have a better perspective on life
[1:32:06] because I realized that everything I'm
[1:32:08] going through no matter how painful it
[1:32:10] may be is to build character his
[1:32:12] character in me I am thoroughly excited
[1:32:16] about the finished product because he
[1:32:20] promised it God promised it he promised
[1:32:23] the finished product and I believe this
[1:32:26] seed that I have in me cannot stop
[1:32:28] growing it's perfect it's a perfect seed
[1:32:33] it's able to penetrate through through
[1:32:36] concrete walls humble yourselves
[1:32:44] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:32:46] that ye may be exalted into time casting
[1:32:50] all your cares upon him for he careth
[1:32:54] Karen continually cares for you be sober
[1:32:58] be vigilant before your Eva's because
[1:33:01] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[1:33:03] lion walking about seeking whom he may
[1:33:06] devour now we would have thought eight
[1:33:08] that the devil still had power but
[1:33:10] brother Adam said he doesn't he's like a
[1:33:13] lion with no teeth all he's got is a
[1:33:15] roar right
[1:33:17] he's a bee with no stinger he lost all
[1:33:21] of his powers be sober be village'
[1:33:24] because your adversary
[1:33:26] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[1:33:28] whom he may devour whom resist steadfast
[1:33:30] in the faith knowing that the same
[1:33:33] afflictions are accomplished in your
[1:33:35] brethren that are in the world but the
[1:33:38] God of all Grace who have called us unto
[1:33:41] eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that
[1:33:45] ye have suffered a while make you
[1:33:47] perfect is that all right did you get on
[1:33:49] my knee suffering huh it's worth while
[1:33:54] they're gonna be giving out rewards out
[1:33:56] there you know I don't know you said
[1:33:59] well they ain't gonna make me no
[1:34:00] different you gonna not feel so well I
[1:34:02] don't know how God gonna handle that
[1:34:03] with everybody getting the reward y'all
[1:34:05] know how it is when school time is over
[1:34:07] you know and you know they giving out
[1:34:09] rewards on just before you graduate a
[1:34:11] pass to the next grade and everybody's
[1:34:14] getting all these certificates and you
[1:34:16] hope that all the time you thinking I
[1:34:18] wish I'd have done better I wish I would
[1:34:20] have been more attentive I wish I
[1:34:22] wouldn't have missed those days I hate I
[1:34:24] was late cuz even a a perfect attendant
[1:34:27] certificate means something on that day
[1:34:32] and you feel left out when everybody's
[1:34:35] getting their rewards hey somebody help
[1:34:39] me here it's gonna make a difference
[1:34:41] everybody think we're gonna have on the
[1:34:43] same uniforms and the same clothing and
[1:34:46] that's not true you and I there will be
[1:34:50] a men not like the world system don't
[1:34:53] get me wrong but there will be places
[1:34:56] where prophets were set there will be
[1:34:58] places where the people who follow
[1:35:00] prophets will say there would be places
[1:35:02] whether whether the apostles and all
[1:35:05] that you know what I'm saying
[1:35:06] there will be ranking brother Branham
[1:35:09] said it we will all have ranking
[1:35:11] everybody won't have the same amount of
[1:35:14] crowns everybody won't have the same
[1:35:16] amount of reward but one thing for
[1:35:19] certain none of us will be jealous of
[1:35:21] the other we wouldn't care in that
[1:35:26] respect hallelujah like the Prophet God
[1:35:30] said even if I'm a doormat it's all
[1:35:32] right
[1:35:35] see because remember you know when it
[1:35:39] comes to our greatest joy would be Jesus
[1:35:41] himself like that man said don't be
[1:35:44] telling me about no roads in North crown
[1:35:46] I want to see him
[1:35:48] that's my don't tell me about no rose
[1:35:50] and ground I want to see him oh my god
[1:35:55] ah but the God of all Grace who have
[1:36:01] called us unto his eternal glory by
[1:36:04] Jesus Christ after that ye have suffered
[1:36:06] a wild make you perfect stablish
[1:36:08] strengthens and settles you to him be
[1:36:10] glory and Dominion for ever and ever
[1:36:13] it did say to you be glory he said to
[1:36:15] him be glory all the glory and honor
[1:36:18] goes to God I'm not finished with this
[1:36:19] subject I've had to preach more on it
[1:36:21] but because I want to bring some things
[1:36:23] out of saw out of Samuel Amen some
[1:36:25] things dealing with the same horse
[1:36:27] riders how he rode and stuff like that I
[1:36:30] as much as I can see through the
[1:36:32] scriptures I want to show you that this
[1:36:33] thing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:36:35] today and forever
[1:36:36] brother Branham said all that is laying
[1:36:39] in the Bible he said now I'm just
[1:36:41] touching the surface but I have these
[1:36:42] preachers come and they'll take it from
[1:36:44] there and show you so we he knew he was
[1:36:47] coming and he knew that preachers was
[1:36:49] and preaching was important to take us
[1:36:52] higher because the Bible said the
[1:36:55] fivefold ministry is here for the
[1:36:57] perfecting of the Saints and if you take
[1:36:59] that out of the Word of God I don't care
[1:37:01] who you are you are in danger
[1:37:05] you cannot chop the Word of God up and
[1:37:08] because now you're trying to say Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ is not the same he's always the
[1:37:14] same I even heard on on on the message
[1:37:18] on today I think it was the fifth seal
[1:37:21] but even well brother bear I'm saying
[1:37:22] our true prophet of God will not glorify
[1:37:26] himself and don't want to be glorified
[1:37:31] so who are you and none of us say ain't
[1:37:39] nowhere near him I heard him the other
[1:37:41] day how he was talking about he at that
[1:37:44] time he had about 2 million souls he had
[1:37:46] one to the Lord
[1:37:48] two million that's not it that's not at
[1:37:51] the end that was in the early stage of
[1:37:52] his ministry two million but like I said
[1:37:59] the other day everybody was no danger do
[1:38:02] two million and remember Amen when it
[1:38:07] when it came to Ruth Ruth came in at a
[1:38:10] time of gleaning and all she could get
[1:38:14] with I think about seven ears of corn or
[1:38:16] something like that but you see that was
[1:38:20] her measure good and faithful servant if
[1:38:25] God ordained you to just give two
[1:38:27] pennies good and faithful servants you
[1:38:30] understand me as long as we all reach
[1:38:33] his purpose for which he put us here for
[1:38:38] we've hit a hundred percent and our wars
[1:38:43] would be as much you said all not with
[1:38:46] God yes it is let's go back to the way
[1:38:48] God calculate thing he said at the
[1:38:51] eleventh hour I'm gonna give you a penny
[1:38:53] he said that the first hour I give you a
[1:38:56] penny right at the end of the day they
[1:38:59] all got pennies and the one servant said
[1:39:02] oh we don't work all days and how can I
[1:39:04] be unjust didn't I promised you a penny
[1:39:06] I gave you a penny if I promised him a
[1:39:08] penny and I give him a penny I'm just as
[1:39:11] just to him as I was to you it's my
[1:39:13] money
[1:39:15] it's my money
[1:39:17] I do with what I want to do with it
[1:39:19] thank God for what you got now you
[1:39:24] should get jealous
[1:39:26] we'll see Paul and them and do all of
[1:39:29] the things they do and I think to myself
[1:39:30] Lord what it is you know we barely see
[1:39:33] what you know and God said but you see
[1:39:36] you don't understand you you and I we
[1:39:39] live in the time that Paul them could
[1:39:40] live in you living in a time that
[1:39:43] William Branham couldn't live in because
[1:39:45] of the way he was built he would have
[1:39:47] had a nervous breakdown if he was to see
[1:39:49] what is going on on these streets God
[1:39:52] had to take him he wasn't built for this
[1:39:55] he could see it but he couldn't live it
[1:39:58] and have a peace of mind he saw in his
[1:40:01] day what he
[1:40:02] so and he wanted to run out into the
[1:40:03] woods and God said if you did that you
[1:40:06] gonna become a bomb it was - you can't
[1:40:11] do that see here that enlarges period
[1:40:15] Lord said not to fire is that the truth
[1:40:18] he did he stood behind that door and saw
[1:40:21] that lady with the purple hair the
[1:40:23] purple fingernails and everything Lord
[1:40:24] how can you put up with this see that
[1:40:26] was that Elijah's spirit speaking to it
[1:40:28] through him God saw there to say hey
[1:40:31] come on back here I'm gonna talk to you
[1:40:32] a little bit the same blood that's
[1:40:35] around this earth is bouncing your sins
[1:40:38] off just like it is hers is that right
[1:40:42] god corrected a prophet concerning a
[1:40:46] lady that looked like a prostitute
[1:40:47] you're no better than she is I'm
[1:40:50] protecting you
[1:40:51] my blood is covering your sins and then
[1:40:54] you want me to get rid of her you
[1:40:58] understand me a lot of time we don't
[1:41:00] understand how God loves his children is
[1:41:03] that right
[1:41:04] Jesus says that the Father loves us even
[1:41:07] as he loved him who seventeenth chapter
[1:41:13] of John amen so people have got we're
[1:41:17] blessed
[1:41:19] this ain't no hard way to go
[1:41:21] I really believe with all of my heart if
[1:41:25] I had like a year or so to go to live at
[1:41:28] the day of my death if it takes that I
[1:41:31] believe God will make I'll be perfect
[1:41:33] God will not allow me to fall asleep I'm
[1:41:36] perfect
[1:41:36] imperfect and so even to us you said
[1:41:41] well what do you mean God can give you a
[1:41:45] growth spirit a growth just like that if
[1:41:49] God can change your heart over the
[1:41:51] center while he's there on Calvary make
[1:41:54] him take him from being a murderer to a
[1:41:56] saint in the matter of a moment or two
[1:41:59] what do you think God can do for you
[1:42:01] none of us are worthy but God said he
[1:42:05] will complete that which he has begun in
[1:42:08] you that's what I hold God to because he
[1:42:12] promised me he was gonna complete me so
[1:42:14] I don't worry about it
[1:42:16] if deficits knock on my door why should
[1:42:18] I worry what we fearing it's gonna come
[1:42:21] anyhow if they go to confid you fear is
[1:42:25] not going to convert you and fear will
[1:42:27] not stop it from happening
[1:42:28] so you might as well enjoy Jesus people
[1:42:34] say enjoy him enjoy the fact that I'm
[1:42:37] getting ready to go home with God
[1:42:40] let's tan God is real and we must trust
[1:42:49] him
[1:42:50] you know God didn't put the salvation in
[1:42:53] your hands and I know sometime I preach
[1:42:55] it like it is but it ain't in your hands
[1:42:56] it's in God's hand but what I believe
[1:42:58] the Word of God is trying to produce a
[1:43:00] desire in you to love him so much that
[1:43:03] you desire to be perfect at whatever
[1:43:07] cost it doesn't make any any difference
[1:43:10] on the consequences I want to be perfect
[1:43:13] you know and I realized that in this
[1:43:15] message I think I tried to say that this
[1:43:17] morning we think that everybody in this
[1:43:20] message you see and it's not we figure
[1:43:24] because they call on the name of the
[1:43:26] Lord Jesus and they have a picture of
[1:43:28] the prophet of God if their church will
[1:43:30] no no no no no not even all the Catholic
[1:43:34] Church are the same not even all the
[1:43:36] Baptist churches are the same you know
[1:43:39] what the Church of the Living God our
[1:43:41] people not buildings and dude you can
[1:43:45] have a building looking and looking all
[1:43:47] fabulous and beautiful amen with all
[1:43:49] kinds of signs and types of pictures and
[1:43:52] things on the wall and it don't mean a
[1:43:54] thing if the preacher think he's our
[1:43:56] King
[1:43:59] y'all hear what I'm saying if the
[1:44:02] preacher thinks that he's better than
[1:44:05] the people that's an antichrist that's
[1:44:13] what the preachers
[1:44:14] and then what happened they began to
[1:44:15] lord over them hello yo y'all hear what
[1:44:19] I'm saying in this message
[1:44:21] we don't have Kings like that cuz we all
[1:44:25] kings and priests before God
[1:44:28] hmm we all sheep hey somebody help me
[1:44:33] here I always take brother branham's
[1:44:36] life as an example and when I say that I
[1:44:41] mean the humility that that man had
[1:44:44] never wanted to give honor to himself
[1:44:46] but always gave honor to the Lord Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ the humility that if anybody
[1:44:53] could have been puffed up in his age it
[1:44:54] was him nobody could do the miracles the
[1:44:59] signs and wonders that he did in his
[1:45:02] ministry nothing nobody Billy Graham
[1:45:06] Oral Roberts
[1:45:07] nobody in that age had the kind of
[1:45:09] ministry that he had if he wanted to be
[1:45:12] something great he could have been but
[1:45:13] you know what he said he said God will
[1:45:15] let me do it
[1:45:16] [Laughter]
[1:45:19] hallelujah he was a prisoner of Christ I
[1:45:23] love that I love that and you know if
[1:45:28] anything if I entered anything about
[1:45:30] brother Branham I I love and so it is
[1:45:32] that I want to live like he lived in the
[1:45:36] face of God if I if I cherished and
[1:45:40] coveted anything that would be it
[1:45:43] it ain't the hunting is not the fishing
[1:45:45] it's not the way he dressed young me or
[1:45:48] combed his hair okay nothing it's the
[1:45:52] Christ that I look and see that's what I
[1:45:55] get psyched about it because that Christ
[1:45:57] was in 2000 years ago that was just
[1:46:00] yesterday for us you love the Lord he
[1:46:03] had to be an example in that way people
[1:46:05] had to be for us to see Christ in him
[1:46:09] and what crisis and he says look I'm not
[1:46:12] the only pebble on the beach but this is
[1:46:14] what I come to do and understand they
[1:46:16] are more coming oh and who are the more
[1:46:19] you and I we don't have that same

[1:51:21] you can be a housewife and be perfect a
[1:51:26] farmer and be perfect just a ordinary
[1:51:30] person and be perfect so don't think
[1:51:34] that you got to have these supernatural
[1:51:36] wings on you or some kind of Batman cape
[1:51:41] you don't have that it's just you God in
[1:51:46] you most of the time when you're
[1:51:49] standing perfect most people don't even
[1:51:51] recognize you
[1:51:52] but God recognizes your perfection so be
[1:51:56] encouraged be encouraged everybody in
[1:52:00] the church is not ordained to do
[1:52:01] everything everybody have their portion

[1:52:08] portion in part is was just praying if
[1:52:10] the singing if it's just doing things
[1:52:12] around the church whatever it is just be
[1:52:14] perfect in what you can be and God will
