this morning those of you who could make it out we appreciate you coming thank you so much we ask that you turn with us too even though Matthew the fifth chapter and from Matthew the fifth chapter we'll ask that you turn with us to John 4 23. Matthew 5 my true psych and we'll begin reading at the sixth verse 6 says blessed are they which do Hunger and thirst at the righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the Purity for they shall see God turn with us now to Saint John 4 23. but the hour cometh and now he is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek it to worship Him seeking such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth he focuses one more scripture and then I have you be seated Colossians 3 and even the collusion Colossians 3 will read the 17th verse there whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you we thank you for your Amazing Grace Lord we love you this morning more now than we've ever loved you before I thank you for your presence here this morning there's a difference in this place and I am so grateful Lord that you are here as you see I pray that you're perfect and divine will be done to those who are hear us this morning wherever they may be thank you Jesus thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy toward us Lord without you lord Jesus where would we be but I'm grateful Lord that you chose us in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated as well yes there is a part of us that we yeah it's saddened uh because of our departure of our brother Orville I couldn't do that but I want to encourage the Saints this morning you did not fail in faith faith was there but we must understand that the purpose and will of God stands I saw a great transition in our brother Orville and I know he made it I was sitting in my seat and I was thinking I came to know the true Son of God I came to know a seed a bright scene in this day and I look forward to seeing him again my message is not on him this morning we still have the funeral to do because I have a wonderful and I know it's on Saturday uh I don't have the time as yet but that will be announced but I like to just a simple topic this morning the message of Salvation the message that's what we have on there are many Christians and I've said this for the last past weeks Christianity is the greatest deception to what we call Christians because everything that is considered Christianity is not Christianity no matter how it looks burn Parts come on no matter how beautiful it may appears no matter how organized it looks so so apparently if it's not according to the will of God did you it is not Christianity a message a massage God always sent a message when it was time to make a change even in the days of Noah God sent a messenger by the name of Noah and we understand Noah preached 120 years and I want you to listen closely out of all those years only eight Souls were yeah they heard a message of Grace the glass and yet only eight Souls God took a man by the name of Moses placed him in Egypt Moses brought a message and he brought the people out of Egyptians brought him into the Wilderness God fed the Manna From Heaven God gave them the meat of the words and only two Souls out of that generation heard the message of Salvation see to be a church member doesn't make you a Christian even to belong to what we call the message and because you go to a message you must be born again vote amen hallelujah hallelujah Jesus Jesus came in a Time Israel was he said total chaos they had such an organized religion to wherein that when Jesus came they didn't recognize him the god of Heaven and Earth The God Who created all things the god of the Jews were not even recognized and only a few hey was saved under his name while he lived on earth he just had a small follow him and prior to his death there was a man a thief yeah who caught the revelations and he says Lord when you enter into your Paradise have mercy on me now Jesus had preached everything and a half years and this man saw him recognize the words by the grace of God um we're living in this day God sent us Malachi 4. how many of y'all believe we're at the end times there is no longer what we call uh another Pentecostal movie because we are we're beyond that that's good news the age before us last devonu had brother Branham [Applause] did you amen the age we only have last news we only have the voice of God what did you Hallelujah we're in an age of troublesome doesn't age of earthquakes pestilence in all sorts of houses one thing for certain yeah I say this with respect there's nothing like having a child to pass on um to know you'll see him again hallelujah hallelujah see we are in a time where the judgment is striking striking the world and we need a hiding place and I'll say this tonight or this morning your religion won't make it you need something that's deep inside the Bible said that the names of the Lord is a strong Town it is a city of refugee and the righteous run in and it's used we who are believers those of us who are eating and drinking blood of the son of man we have an assurance because Jesus said if you drink my blood and eat my flesh you shall never die and what is saying what is Crusade the flesh what is the body it is the word of God and what is this uh the the the blood it is the spirit of God hallelujah so you need only not only the world and when you have communities in this setting of eating this flesh drinking the blood of the son of man company think about it we are now back in the time of Eden see you don't look at what you see your natural eyes they will lie to you if the word says we're in Edens that's where we are sit down who's that I put it better than that the Bible said we're now sitting in Heavenly places the only place that is a hiding place is in Christ free from all Creeds from all traditions foreign hallelujah hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying my God you and I need to know what communion is I'm coming just just bear with me I'm just kind of setting the foundation video said it like this God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace It Won't Be The Obedience of the people hallelujah that's in the message communion read it again because the number of Grace is fine right he said God ever sends his power to the church It Won't Be The Obedience of the people hallelujah and I don't know about you what I need is Grace this morning hallelujah thank you Jesus the Bible says if you hunger and thirst out the righteousness you shall be fears you can't just automatically hunger Hallelujah a dead man can't hunger Hallelujah yes you understand what I'm saying if you're hungry that means something's there Desiring something from God and holy God can satisfy this satisfaction Hallelujah there's nothing like hunger yeah you see a man that's hunger some people they even kill yeah to satisfy that hunger who satisfied there's nothing like a cry of thirst Hallelujah you can be so thirsty [Applause] well imagine a mirage Embraces there is no water hallelujah amen you understand me but God says he can fix it we must this journey is different nobody has ever walked this way before no church no church age is what I call a Enoch wall a walk where we will be translated no other Church age had this opportunity Hallelujah to step from Earth to Glory hallelujah hallelujah and the only way that you can change is to have the changes the god in you that can bring the transformation The God in you that could bring the change amen amen like the prophet of God says in the message communion he said it's not packing up hey it's unpacking laying aside in in the Pentecostal church we didn't know we were we were supposed to be packing we supposed to be unpacking we saw him that's right this is it does so easily beside us hallelujah that we might run with patience amen did not come to a group this message is an individual it didn't come to Enoch's family is the individual walking and you must Hallelujah you must come to know who you are you understand what I'm saying you must know within your heart don't vote that you are called to be bribe and when you come to understand your call to be brown you understand that you have been exposed to one husband and that's Jesus Christ Alone hallelujah hallelujah you know you don't hear the name of Jesus Christ but that name must be exhausted is that right he said if you exalt me I want this might sound like a Pentecostal message but I'm gonna tell you this is the kind of Pentecostal message that would preached on the day of Pentecost and if it worked then it works that is greater than the message of the Gospel the death barrier and resurrection of Jesus Christ for your information all the Patriots in the Old Testaments don't have never been anything without Christ Apostles of the New Testament everything without Christ song hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] and I'll say this to you what is it to gain the whole world to gain the whole world and lose your soul the whole time in the message communion brother William says communion is to talk to commune with something that you can speak to us a wafer cannot speak back um piece of bread say uh so really the real communion is the holy spirit speaking back from under this morning how many of us have the Holy Spirit well you can talk to him and he speaks back hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody the Pharisees could Out quote all of us when it comes to the scripture because they can tell you what Moses said it ain't quoting the scriptures there's nothing wrong with the quoting put everything in his proper place who is the author and finish Hallelujah there was a prophet that was born with the Holy Ghost his name was John it's anointed Jean and there was a prophet who was born with the word and his name was Jesus Christ and you had two prophets on the scene you had John was Anthony John you had Jesus Jesus Christ is that right but when Elizabeth heard the name of Jesus Christ John had a Revival why because Jesus was greater than Josh and if it was that way then God's way now Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost gender sentence please by calling on the name of Jesus I'm not being lonely no disease is that right that's the same way I'm just going to show you even when I'm jumping in my nose but even when John man I think June identified Jesus Christ the word if he don't slap out they said that only two of John's disciples amen what happened to the others see that's the same I don't see that man shows William Branham King William Brown and he identified Jesus Christ and how many people have stayed with jobs and amen Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's turns Brothers he kept saying building the house of God and when God opened the seals original [Applause] Hallelujah don't mean to get so excited but he's here this morning this morning hallelujah hallelujah now don't get me wrong at all new company I'm not looking for popularity popularity is not always right is that right I was thinking about zedekiah and Michael as as uh zedekiah is it like yes yeah and Micah he might meet y'all remember when the king wanted to dance shall we go up hey cartoon prophets and Michael said you know don't do that Hallelujah he even told us if God spoke to you Hallelujah did he need to speak to me I don't I don't know but if he spoke to me I see my palette this is my last time singing you see more down you and I down what was it 400 prophets yeah yeah amen it's not the majority hallelujah hallelujah you're going to see by the grace of God that everything that claims to be is not so cute you need to see God [Music] my husband is Jesus Christ a message of Salvation this kind of message get me in trouble so it's all the messaging my mom but I told the Lord whatever troubles I get here Jesus Christ is going to get me inspiration with Anna he said but a real you know the real believer that's really spiritual built up he reads his Bible every day how many did that cut out Hallelujah you're a Christian but you don't read the Bible you're a Christian but you don't commune with God you're a Christian but you haven't heard his voice y'all hear what I'm saying it's greater than Church going hallelujah hallelujah we have found ourselves trapped in a cage she will escape Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah it's the most acceptive age [Music] it's the darkest age it has an approved song and to escape it that makes you bright and pools Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the only God that talks back it is you can go and kneel before Buddha rip out you can even call on Allah you ain't getting nothing but Jesus if you call on him he will answer your prayers yes sir if you try to try to talk to any other girl in Saint Joseph oh San Jose and Saint Martin oh Sam Martin it becomes spiritualism amen I was telling somebody the other day in respect always speak to Malachi 4. I I managed she got because I myself have been guilty because I said oh my I wish that brother Brandon was here and the Holy Ghost said to me if he was what will he do and if he was here what could he do because he couldn't do nothing y'all hear what I'm saying you you never should put brother Branham whenever Batman in the place of the Divine healer who is Jesus Christ you kiss me man foreign situation [Music] [Applause] bust in them that he might see and that's what we need to do this they know that when when when when those years were old Heaven came down We're Never Alone Hallelujah foreign God speaks by the Holy Ghost having something here's what brother remember the anointing longness upon the church she is surely glees he said that is the meat Society Hallelujah is the meat and the dreams eat my body don't break my flesh emotions people don't want it is the real Holy Ghost either that or we've just gotten so lazy and since but you need to cry out Lord Make Me hunger make me thirst for your righteousness that is true this is a true law of God and thirst out the righteousness this is the thing according to Saint John uh 4 23-72 here John speaks but the hour cometh and now is you know that's Jesus right amen when the true worshipers shall worship the father spirit and in truth the father seeketh such to worship Demand right God is a spirit because I want us to see this those of us who are truly born again you're no longer natural men brunettes Hallelujah All God's Children that's what you're supposed to believe in the Supernatural one thing that God spoke to me during the time that or Orville was going through it God said to me ID nothing no situation in your current situation is hopeless to a True Believer all things are possible dude shows but even when you believe God can raise the dead you've got Christians [Music] in a mockery ways Hallelujah but let me tell you what you might consider too far Cirque when we stayed there to the end let me say it like yeah I still believe because I know that's because you're saying he's still going to get up here I don't believe we have much time there are things that we could say yeah but I I I saw something that I have to tell later on but there is no doubt in my heart I don't know what it was before he got sick I saw his end and his end was glorious you could tell that the peace of God hallelujah and my wife sang a song to him yes Jesus loved me he wishes you man and she said he started basically dancing in the bed but he wasn't supposed to do that see they don't know what they're talking about hallelujah hallelujah whatsoever you do in word or deed I'm here give thanks to God by him we give thanks to God by using the name Lord Jesus you give thanks to God and the father ever back by him I passed your degree imma said I gotta read yeah man Hallelujah and whatever you do in word or deeds don't power on do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him I've had somebody to tell me years ago that the Bible was obsolete how can that be the Bible is God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God yes how are you going to say that when Jesus himself referred to the Bible go and judge did you remember he said as Jonah was in the belly of the world they let Creeds elastics and uh Traditions blind them they did it in Jesus name they did it in William Branham and they doing it today oh amen this is what got me Saint John 14. jean-ship 19-21.

I'm gonna stop here there's so much more I want to say yeah maybe not I'll see what he wants me to do did you live well but that's starting at the third verse chapter 2 Corinthians you see where I'm trying to take you this morning I'm trying to get you to fall in love with Jesus Christ foreign but if our gospel be heard may see three yes see you know it is here to them that are lost listen to what he says in whom the God of this World Police and could you Don the Jews they're blinded the minds of them which believe not intelligence lest the light of the Glorious Gospel of cool Christ I thank you it's the image of God shine unto them all new and so when you're preaching the gospel that gospel You Preach supposed to reflect the image if it reflects anything but Christ it has to reflect Christ perfect decreased for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake who's preaching here say Paul that's that's preaching pepper Hallelujah and William Branham never preached himself he preached Jesus that's what he did amen hey he preached it like Paul Bridge yes sir amen and ourselves the Servants of Jesus saying new songs oh Jesus oh Jesus the true Mercy Seat uh coming from the message the Mighty God unveiled you 1964. now when the veil was rent at Calvary I mean The Mercy Seat came into plain view now but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood as they had took the blood it goes on Peter's song year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary of the mercy results with his Great Mighty stroke of lightning power Ave something lit the old Badge of veil from top to bottom and The Mercy Seat came into planes and it says to me so I called the real Levine genuine Lamb of God singing in plain view of Calvary okay paid the price himself Jesus Christ [Applause] oh but at last minute I thought the tradition the tradition of the church fathers in that day many times by their Traditions if they would have known the scriptures each peace would have come like the Chinese tags the Old Testament prophecy if they had been taught the scriptures as Moses said here that to do to this day they veiled it's still over their hearts is that right right because remember when Jesus came consciousness Moses disciples we're followers of Moses [Music] [Applause] and when you call yourself a brand of Mighty you're now a denomination amen you're doing the same thing they did we are of Moses hallelujah hallelujah no no Paul said some say I'm a cephas some say I am Apollos said no no no no don't even consider me consider amen hallelujah there's only one that died for you there's only one that rules for you Jesus himself [Applause] okay man he said it's still over their hearts we've done the same thing but this is God the suffering and the atonement experience don't be saying to him [Music] hold him in plain view there he is the mighty conqueror says he rent the veil in two come on amen John said I heard a lion you know I DJ if you uh uh and I look to see and when I turned he calls him she's doing it I saw the mercy scene I saw a lamb looked like it was slain from the foundation of the world
