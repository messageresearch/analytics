[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] i think it's uh
[1:07:12] all christians
[1:07:14] come to a place in their lives where
[1:07:16] they're tired
[1:07:20] you know we come down to the bottom of a
[1:07:23] valley
[1:07:25] you can look back to the times when
[1:07:27] you're on the mountaintops
[1:07:29] and you're just saying i'm just a little
[1:07:30] worn out
[1:07:32] just a little tired
[1:07:33] i need a refreshing of the lord
[1:07:37] but you know when we come down to those
[1:07:39] times
[1:07:54] he doesn't sit down and think well i'm
[1:07:56] just going to sit here and starve to
[1:07:58] death
[1:08:01] but no he does something about it no you
[1:08:03] fight you pick yourself up he goes down
[1:08:05] to the refrigerator
[1:08:07] where he can get a meal
[1:08:21] if he begins to get thirsty on a hot day
[1:08:26] he begins to feel fate he goes and gives
[1:08:28] himself a drink of water
[1:08:31] and he does that in faith
[1:08:35] as he begins to drink that water that
[1:08:37] strength will be renewed
[1:08:42] and even so is the same with the
[1:08:44] christians
[1:08:45] many are christians
[1:08:50] but there it says there in the book of
