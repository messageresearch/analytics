book of Isaiah in chapter 36. and verse it's good to see brother Billy all the way from Texas amen it's good to see him visiting you are still welcome in Des Moines Isaiah chapter 36 and verse 1. if you are there just say Amen if you're still finding your way there say help me Lord Isaiah chapter 36 and verse 1. now it came to pass in the 14th year of King Hezekiah that Seneca Rib King of Assyria came up against all the defense uh cities of Judah and took them let us go to Isaiah chapter 37 verse 11. how long is Egypt the first verse that we read King of Assyria is he had come to attack Israel and he took over Judah yeah and the king of Judah Hezekiah um he had nothing to do in American Affair he was scared either people because they were under an attack from Assyria king of Assyria he sent a letter to King Hezekiah on foreign threatening him telling him what he was going to do to him that's in verse 11. the letter says behold thou has heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shall thou be delivered please have the gods of the Nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and Heron and the razav and the children of Eden which were in telasa where is the king of Hemet and the king of Alfred and the king of the city of Hina and Iva us diva and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of The Messengers and read it is we can take our seats we'll continue once we are seated in the scriptures we are reading it is he wrote a letter and gave it to Hezekiah is a guess and he says all the cities that we have destroyed and he named each and every one of them and he says these ones they could not overcome us and Hezekiah knew of these is and uh sinach group said what I have done unto them that's what I'm coming to do to you is and he had a Written Letter yeah it was not a lie it was true but Hezekiah knew that he was a son of abrahamas Hallelujah he knew that he was tied into a covenant that Abraham God that God gave to Abraham Abraham the Covenant was unconditional you see God made conditional covenants with men before but men always failed so when God came to Abraham he says this Con Covenant is unconditional conditional it's not what you do it's a passport because the men always fail because but it is what I'm going to do it doesn't matter if you come through or you don't come through I will hold on to my covenants die seed shall possess the gates of the enemies that Covenant was for Abraham and all his seed that came after him that's why he was able to go after lot and kill those Ten Kings and redeem his brother back he was under that Covenant with God and everyone that came after Abraham was under that Covenant if they would call God to say God come to your Covenant God will always come through and this morning if you are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ he was being overcome by a kid by hands of received the letter from the hand of The Messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord and here's the car prayed unto the Lord saying oh lord of hosts God of Israel that dwells between the cherubimes Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made Heaven and Earth is which had sent to reproach the Living God it says this is not a lie but of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries and have cast their gods Into the Fire for they were not Gods but the work of men's hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them is was not praying to a god of wood you remember the promise of God that says if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he says I will hear from Heaven not only will he hear and remain dumb person but he will hear and answer that prayer and verse 20 he says now therefore O Lord Our God save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord even now only it was serve amen I'm speaking on whose report will you believe Hezekiah had two reports one from the Covenant with God and one with the Covenant from the one with the letter from sinach is saying what's true what God Said was true and he had to make a choice say whose report am I going to believe this morning you and I we have to come to a point where we make that choice when you have the doctor's report that says you are sick and you have the report from God that says you've been made whole that says by my stripes I have healed you have to choose which report to believe and you you have to Satan can bring you a report of Trials something that is true that you are going through and then there is God's report he loves which says many other afflictions of the righteous it doesn't end there it says but God delivered out of some of them not out of some of them but out of them does not matter what it is when you call God on the scene on his Covenant he has to come through whose report will you believe verse 33 deaf and Isaiah came back with a word from the Lord 37 verse 33 says therefore that says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria he shall not come into this city nor should an arrow there no come before it with shields no cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he returned and shall not come into this city says the Lord in another verse the Bible says that the enemy comes in one way and he flees in seven ways that's what happens when God is standing for you verse 35 the verse for I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant David why because decided he chose to believe the report of the Lord he counted what sennache has said as a lying vanity it doesn't matter all these Kings but when you come to me I'm an exception exception because I'm a Child of God because I am of the Seed of Abraham brother sister if you are a Seed of Abraham you are an exception Satan can come to you with a report and say this person said person had depression they lost their minds this person had anxiety and look at where they are at now you can stand and you say I am an exception I am a child of Abraham exception means what happens to others does not happen to you so you can say it doesn't matter even if there is evidence that it happened to all of them when it comes to me I'm Different amen because I am a son of God Hezekiah refused to be counted in all of these other failures he was under the Covenant of circumcision and that Covenant is Italians kept him Victorious you and me we are under the Covenant of circumcision in the New Testament the Covenant of circumcision is receiving the holy ghosts when you receive the Holy Ghost you are under that Covenant so you have to a right to refuse to be one of those failures you have to refuse to say whatever happened to them does not happen to me we serve a god of Precedence [Music] that example will help you solve your situation this is the example so if you are in a predicament look back into the word of God and say Lord you did this before I know you can do it again you can't do it for me Hallelujah because I I am an exception exception he made an exception for Sarah is well known that women that are 90 years old they cannot give birth but because Sarah was in the Covenant with Abraham God made an exception and he gave her a baby baby when Rebecca came Rebecca was also Barren to because um she couldn't give birth everybody songs when Rachel came the three Hebrew boys were thrown in the fiery furnace we've never heard of things not burning when they are thrown in fire but when the three Hebrew boys are thrown in the fairness they came out without even a single hair burn something something we made an exception and if you call on the Lord of presidents you say if you did it for Sarah you can do it for me if you did it for Rebecca and Rachel you can't do it for me if you did it for Joshua you can do the same thing for me if you did it for Daniel the three Hebrew boys you can do the same thing for me Lazarus was dead for four days she was already rotten but when Jesus came on the scene he made an exception he called him out of that grave he can do the same thing for you whatever you've been dealing with it doesn't matter how dead it is he will come through because if he did it before he can't do it again Hallelujah Satan never tells the truth any report you get from Satan is not true it does not matter how factual it looks like Satan has no ability he cannot tell the truth his nature is to lie so whatever Satan tells you the opposite is true when he tells you you're not a Christian you say I am a Christian when he tells you you're not an overcomer you say I am a boy because he has no ability to tell the truth so everything every report he gives you it's a lie the opposite it's true let's read this quote in expectations of paragraph 30. of expectations it says what if someone came up in the morning to your door they may seek a company an Express agent and throwed a whole basket full of rattle snacks and had your name on them and said here they are they are yours just like you know your symptoms are there if you receive them they are yours if a package comes to your door and that and it has your name on it is not misspelled but exactly as how you are called you have a right to say this package that you have sent me this is not mine it might have my name on it but I'm not going to sign for it you know they're there just like you know your symptoms is there for symptoms if you receive them they are yours but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them and he can say your names on them you say I don't want them I won't have them he can stand there and argue as much as he wants to you tonight but until you take them and sign for them they belong to the express company until you sign for them don't sign for nothing the devil brings you say there it is though I refuse to have it that's right take it back have nothing to do with if you won't testify that you've got it when you testify you still have your sickness the devil keeps it with you but you refuse to testify and say I won't have it no sir you go to the hospital the doctor gives you a diagnosis do not accept it that's a false report from the devil and foreign Hallelujah refuse the devil's report amen and God is always reminding us what he wants us to be and how he sees us he calls us a chosen generation he calls that set aside in Japan he calls us above and not beneath the lender not the borrower Royal peculiar the on purpose special Royal why does God keep on repeating all these things he is repeating us so we can know what he calls us when you know what God calls you to be yes you have to accept that for yourself it does not matter how much God calls you a more than a conqueror foreign matter how much he calls you the lender not the borrower if you do not accept it for yourself it ain't happening hey man cause you have to accept what the word is saying about you and many times we lose on promises we lose on God's promises because we don't accept that word for ourselves that's why God in his word is constantly reminding us pointing us to the word hey man let's go to Numbers Chapter 13 and verse 1. [Music] this is when uh God told the children of Israel to go over and take over in Canada and the Lord speak of Moses saying he is on and thou men that they may search the land of Canaan over the zombies which have which I gave unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their father shall you send a man everyone a ruler among them when the children of Israel left Egypt they were given a Promised Land here they were just before crossing over and Moses sent out these 12 Spies the promise of God said the land is yours you go and take it and we all know the story ten spies came with a different report this is the other two Joshua and Caleb came with a different reports let's go to verse 27 um and they've told him and said we came unto the land with the thou sentestas and surely it flowed with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it they brought back the evidence of the land is the grapes everything that God has said in his word they believed it is verse 28 says nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are World reveal some fortifier and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there news before I used to think that the 10 spies did not believe the word of God advance but when I read this again they believed it and they said for sure the land is there it flows with milk and honey they did not dispute what the promise of God said we go to verse 33 she was a little uh and here is what they say and there we saw the Giants the sons of Enoch on which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their side where did they get grasshoppers from come on they believe the promise of God but Satan added just one more element and they started seeing grasshoppers in this promise and they started seeing themselves as grasshoppers God never said you are grasshoppers hey man God had already told them that they are conquerors they're going to be Victorious and take it I am already What God Says I Am that's what you gotta say for yourself take God on his word he says you are going to get it claim that land claim that promise it doesn't matter how you you think you are not able to do it don't look at your own insecurities don't look at what you are not able to do you are not the one who gave the promise God is the one who gave the promise so he is responsible for making that promise come to pass when he told Abraham and Sarah that you're going to have a baby they were old and unable to conceived but they did not worry to see how is this going to happen Mississippi they were not responsible for the transformation of their bodies they just believed and stood on God's word so when God gives you your destiny when God gives you a promise stand on that promise and say Lord I'm calling you on the scene it is a fixed fight all you just have to do is show up and fight the victory is already yours so that's why Satan always tries to make sure we see the word he misconstrues the word to us the same thing he did with Eve he did not take away what God said he just added not enough and they forfeited the promise of God he is with these 10 spies he just introduced a grasshopper into the promise and they were ready to let go I said we cannot do this but we have someone like Jacob and like Joshua and Caleb means who can say God said so this is it doesn't matter how many Giants are in the land we are going to go and claim it and the word became flesh of 1954 foreign so if the Bible says let a mind that was in Christ being you I don't see that being ridiculous because when you take that mind that was in Christ and you put it in your heart and you think it will bring all of God's promises to pass amen paragraph 178 backups songs or something it says now if that same spirit that says Let There be like let's go remember is this it says Let There Be trees and there were trees and if that same mind that was in Christ being you is how much could it say let there be no cancer and it will be gone let the blind eyes and it will be so you know it's your thoughts so he took the thought that was in Christ you put it in yourself and you start speaking like Christ it helps to produce the exact things have to happen because you are calling on the Covenant God before we have to do to you if you did it in the beginning he did it the same thing with Jesus as well he's going to do the same thing to you too because it's that same mind that was in Christ in the exposition of the seven Church ages he says he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith is um takes that word into his heart and places it onto his lips why that is the same as deity speaking amen Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man I love that it is the same as dear to speaking because you took the mind that was in Christ you put it onto your you said the word of God face it is the same as deity speaking it is when you speak things have to happen Satan cannot stand before so it all depends you taking God and his word and putting it in your heart what you think of yourself is what you will be so Satan that's why he's always trying to change what you think about yourself that's always his technique brings the word um amen [Music] [Music] when you are sitting in your seat allows it is you can't see some things certain shows the brother who seated to this extreme left he cannot see this microphone because of where he is seated perspective but when you sit in the right spot you'll be able to see clearly so the Bible told us that let the mind that was in Christ be in you Allah so you stop thinking like yourself stop thinking what the devil wants you to think and you start thinking what Christ wants you to think because you will start having the perspective that God wants to have for your life for the calling in your life for your uh for your destiny when we see towards the hill God sees behind the hills that's why when Jesus was walking with his disciples and he got the news that his friend Lazarus was dead he told them that Lazarus is sleeping they had a total different perspective to them sleeping he was sleeping but to him sleeping was dead and he was going to resurrect so when you bring yourself to in the position where you can see things in God's perspective evil that'll be able to bring God's word to come to pass in your life amen amen and numbers 13 verse 30. Caleb is still the people before Moses let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it they said God said it is it doesn't matter how much our size is to those to to the Giants
