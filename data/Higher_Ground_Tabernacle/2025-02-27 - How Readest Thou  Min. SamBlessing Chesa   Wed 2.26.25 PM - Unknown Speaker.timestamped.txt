[8:03] your
[8:05] word you know any man who's educated can
[8:08] read the
[8:11] word but Lord it is only your
[8:14] anointing it is that action that can
[8:17] activate that word and make it
[8:21] alive oh God I pray oh God that you make
[8:23] this word live from the pages of the
[8:27] book right so that he resounds with Our
[8:29] Lives oh
[8:32] God so that we might say for sure the
[8:34] Lord spoke to
[8:37] us come and have your way Lord as we
[8:41] yield ourselves unto
[8:43] you saying Lord please come and have
[8:45] full
[8:47] preeminence in your son Jesus Christ
[8:50] mighty name we pray
[8:53] believing amen
[8:55] amen amen whilst we are standing let us
[8:58] open our um
[9:02] Bible's the book of
[9:04] uh Luke and chapter
[9:09] 10 verse
[9:19] 23 amen
[9:22] Luke chapter 10 verse
[9:27] 23e if you can switch the
[9:29] um translat this microphone to the
[9:31] wireless
[9:35] one and he turned him unto his
[9:41] disciples and said
[9:44] privately blessed are the eyes which see
[9:47] the things that you
[9:51] see for I tell you that many prophets
[9:54] and Kings have desired to see those
[9:57] things which he see
[9:59] [Music]
[10:05] and have not seen them and to hear those
[10:08] things which you hear and have not heard
[10:16] them and behold a certain lawyer stood
[10:18] up and tempted him saying Master what
[10:22] shall I do to inherit eternal life
[10:36] he said unto
[10:38] him what is written in the
[10:41] law how readest
[10:44] thou and he answered and said Thou shalt
[10:47] love love uh the Lord thy God with all
[10:50] thy heart and with all thy soul and with
[10:52] all thy strength and with all thy mind
[10:54] and thy neighbor is thyself
[11:05] and he said unto him thou has answered
[11:06] right this do and thou shalt
[11:11] leave may the Lord add blessings the
[11:13] reading of his
[11:15] word we take our seats amen I want to
[11:18] pay particular attention to verse
[11:23] 26 and he said unto
[11:25] him what is written in the law
[11:30] how readest
[11:31] thou so uh for a short while this
[11:34] evening you want to speak on how readest
[11:40] [Music]
[11:41] thou amen I don't intend to take too
[11:44] much of your time this
[11:46] evening in the church ages the prophet
[11:48] of God
[11:50] says it says blessed are you if you hear
[11:54] it and read it of this prophecy
[11:59] so there is a blessing in hearing the
[12:03] word and there's also a blessing in
[12:05] reading the
[12:08] word so if you have the grace to read
[12:11] and hear the
[12:14] word you get a double
[12:17] blessing amen amen and the word of
[12:21] God will be a blessing to
[12:24] you if you read it
[12:27] correctly because they many people who
[12:29] misconstrue the
[12:36] word misinterpret the
[12:39] word just like Satan came to
[12:43] Eve and he quoted the exact same word
[12:46] that was in the word of
[12:49] God but then he twisted
[12:52] it when you twist the word of God and
[12:55] you change it there is no blessing in it
[12:59] it doesn't have the power that it has
[13:00] cuz it's no longer the word of
[13:04] God so when you have the word of
[13:08] God it goes back to the question how
[13:10] readest
[13:13] thou how are you
[13:15] reading it's just like in the scripture
[13:17] we read when the lawyer came to Jesus
[13:19] trying to tempt
[13:24] him and Jesus saw that this young man
[13:27] was trying to tempt him
[13:30] and he asked him how readest
[13:33] thou so that's our title this uh
[13:37] evening hallelujah hallelujah so you
[13:39] know the message of the
[13:41] hour is a message it's not just words
[13:44] that
[13:46] written it is not just a
[13:49] message but it is a message that has
[13:53] power power to
[13:56] transform hallelujah hallelujah and it
[13:58] is not not meant for
[14:00] everyone it is meant for a special class
[14:03] of
[14:05] people in the church is the prophet of
[14:07] God
[14:08] says it says this
[14:12] prophecy is for a prophetic class of
[14:16] people so if if you are not in the
[14:19] prophetic class you will not hear
[14:22] anything because your ears are not
[14:27] tuned to to hear those prophetic
[14:33] utterances remember in the Old
[14:36] Testament when God
[14:38] spoke the people would hear
[14:41] thunder and the Thunder wouldn't mean
[14:43] anything to
[14:46] people but the
[14:48] prophet because he had his ear
[14:52] tuned to hear the voice of
[14:55] God he would hear exactly what what God
[14:59] was
[15:01] saying and then decoded and tell to the
[15:05] people hallelujah so you are a prophetic
[15:08] class of
[15:10] people your ears are tuned to hear
[15:13] prophetic
[15:17] utterances your ears are tuned to hear
[15:19] thus says the
[15:22] Lord when everyone else does not
[15:24] understand what that
[15:27] is you can hear
[15:30] and when you hear something resounds in
[15:33] you because you have been
[15:37] predestinated you have been set
[15:40] aside Hallelujah that's what the word of
[15:43] God calls
[15:44] us call us a particular A peculiar
[15:52] people peculiar means that you are
[15:55] special the prophet of God says your
[15:58] soul is worth more than 10,000
[16:03] worlds that's why Satan is after
[16:08] you because he knows your
[16:11] value there's a little story of this
[16:14] little
[16:16] boy he stumbled across his
[16:22] stamp and then he just assumed this temp
[16:25] had value
[16:29] and this little
[16:31] boy the only thing he wanted was ice
[16:36] cream and he took that collect that
[16:39] collected stem to the ice cream
[16:44] man and said I believe this stamp is
[16:47] valuable can I exchange this stamp for
[16:49] an ice
[16:54] cream and he exchanged it and he got his
[16:57] ice cream and went away happy
[17:01] the ice cream man took that
[17:05] stamp he exchanged it with something
[17:07] else that he
[17:10] wanted and that little stem moved
[17:13] different
[17:15] hands but eventually it
[17:20] landed in the hands of a man who knew
[17:22] the value of collected stamps
[17:29] this stamp was worth
[17:31] [Music]
[17:34] $500,000 and he went and cashed it in
[17:36] and he got that
[17:39] $500,000 but people all along the chain
[17:42] of line they were just trampling over
[17:47] it they were just valuing it like ice
[17:53] cream but it was worth much
[17:57] more hallelujah hallelujah so people in
[17:59] this world might not understand your
[18:02] value but but God knows your
[18:06] value that's why he calls you his
[18:09] son that's why he calls you his
[18:13] daughter that's why when you pray he
[18:15] hears your
[18:17] prayer Hallelujah he says if my people
[18:20] who are called by my
[18:22] name if they humble themselves he said I
[18:26] will hear from heaven
[18:29] because you are his
[18:31] people hallelujah and we his people are
[18:33] made Vessels of
[18:38] Honor amen so how how readest
[18:42] thou and we thank God for the
[18:46] word hallelujah hallelujah in this word
[18:49] it describes who we
[18:53] are from Genesis 1 to revelation 22
[18:59] they are full of
[19:01] prophecies full of
[19:04] promises amen am this is not just a
[19:07] historical
[19:08] book you can't read it as a historical
[19:12] book but you won't get value out of
[19:16] it amen but this book is a book of
[19:21] life amen amen Peg from cover to cover
[19:29] with a Timeless
[19:32] prophecies that spans from dispensation
[19:35] to
[19:37] dispensation remember Christ is the same
[19:40] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[19:44] forever so I'm reading Genesis 1 in the
[19:47] beginning God created the heavens and
[19:48] the
[19:51] Earth and he say let there be
[19:54] light I don't know how many years that
[19:57] was
[19:59] but if I need life in if I need light in
[20:01] my
[20:02] life I will go and call and say Lord you
[20:05] said let there be
[20:08] light and that word still has enough
[20:11] power to bring light into your
[20:15] life because when God
[20:17] speaks remember his word does not go
[20:20] back to him
[20:21] void but after it is accomplished that
[20:24] which he has spoken
[20:27] for only if you read the word
[20:31] right hallelujah hallelujah and Paul
[20:34] tells us that the things that are
[20:36] written in the
[20:38] Bible therefore are for an example for
[20:41] us so something that's an
[20:45] example if you've been in school you
[20:48] know your math teacher will work out an
[20:51] example on
[20:54] the on the B and say hey everyone copy
[20:56] this example
[21:00] and you take that example and go back
[21:02] with it
[21:04] home so that when you face another
[21:10] problem you look at the
[21:14] example like how was this Pro how was
[21:17] this problem
[21:20] solved the same way the problem was
[21:24] solved the the problem that you have
[21:26] will be solved
[21:30] so the things that are in the Bible as
[21:32] an example for you and
[21:36] me for you to know that if God did it
[21:41] before he can do it
[21:43] again hallelujah hallelujah if he's gave
[21:46] an
[21:47] example of Abraham and
[21:50] Sarah who had been Barren for 25
[21:53] years and he gave them the
[21:56] promise it is an example to
[21:59] you it's not only that God gives
[22:04] children but whatever situation you've
[22:07] been waiting
[22:10] for God can still bring it to
[22:13] you it is all how you're reading the
[22:18] Bible if you read about Moses uh God
[22:21] opening the Red Sea for the children of
[22:27] Israel it is an
[22:29] example for you to know that when you
[22:31] are between a rock and a hard
[22:35] place God will always come and open a
[22:39] way it's for you to know that God he a
[22:42] way
[22:43] maker he's a miracle
[22:47] worker he opens a way where there is no
[22:51] way and he opens a road where there is
[22:53] no
[22:55] Road and not only that that he will also
[22:57] destroy
[22:59] enemy so you don't have to go around
[23:01] looking for for water lakes for you to
[23:10] open but whatever you red SE
[23:14] is God can still open
[23:17] it because that's what he does he the
[23:20] same yesterday today and
[23:23] forever if he did it
[23:25] before he can do it again if he did it
[23:28] for them he can do it for you too
[23:32] Hallelujah it is all in the word how R
[23:36] is thou how do you read that
[23:39] word and we know the prophet of God
[23:42] talks about there being three
[23:46] Bibles the first Bible was the
[23:49] Zodiac where God put signs and symbols
[23:53] in the sky
[23:56] [Music]
[23:59] he created the universe and put the
[24:00] different planets in
[24:04] there and each and everyone he put each
[24:07] planet in its own
[24:10] orbit that was the first
[24:12] Bible but you see each and every of the
[24:15] stars and the planets that he
[24:19] put each and everyone knows to stay in
[24:22] its
[24:24] orbit each and everyone knows to stay in
[24:27] the place that God placed
[24:32] it you will never see the stars fighting
[24:35] for
[24:38] position saying no me I want your orbit
[24:41] come and take this
[24:44] one we are the stars the sons of
[24:48] God remember God told Abraham your sons
[24:51] shall be like the stars of
[24:56] heaven so we should never ever fight for
[25:00] positions and say I saw that one I also
[25:03] want it to be for
[25:07] me but stay in your
[25:10] lane stay what God called you to
[25:14] be because your anointing and your
[25:16] blessing is in the position God placs
[25:21] you hallelujah hallelujah and in the Z
[25:24] in this
[25:25] zodiac they had to have men who were
[25:27] trained
[25:32] and they used to call them
[25:34] Watchmen so if they wanted to know what
[25:37] was going
[25:39] on they had to come and ask uh Watchmen
[25:42] what of the
[25:45] night and the Watchman will be in the
[25:47] top
[25:49] Tower he looks the position of the
[25:52] Moon the position of the
[25:55] star how much light it is
[25:59] and he could tell what time it
[26:02] was and they were all seeing signs and
[26:04] they could read
[26:07] it but it needed a special kind of skill
[26:10] you needed to learn how to read the
[26:17] sky to read the Zodiac and it wasn't for
[26:21] everyone and we read about the three mag
[26:24] [Music]
[26:26] eyes the three wise men
[26:30] they were reading the book of
[26:33] Daniel and Daniel was writing about the
[26:37] Zodiac and they knew that these three if
[26:40] these three stars
[26:43] align it means that Christ the Messiah
[26:46] has been
[26:48] born and they studied it and when they
[26:50] saw those three
[26:52] lines they made a trip all the way to
[26:55] Jerusalem
[26:58] they uh they went to
[27:00] Bethlehem and when they um when they got
[27:04] there it was after 3
[27:05] years of traveling they were searching
[27:09] for the Messiah so that was the that's
[27:12] the first Bible the
[27:14] Zodiac and the prophet of God talks
[27:16] about the Virgin Cancer and Leo all the
[27:18] different
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] signs talking about the three different
[27:24] comings of the
[27:26] Lord amen
[27:28] amen and we move to the second the
[27:30] second
[27:31] [Music]
[27:33] Bible which the prophet of God tells us
[27:35] is the
[27:36] pyramid and also for the pyramid not
[27:39] everyone was able to read the
[27:43] pyramid the pyramid was was built in a
[27:46] meticulous
[27:48] way and it was accurate it has it was
[27:52] built to specific
[27:54] cubits amen amen and we know all the all
[27:58] the mysteries of the Bible are in the
[28:02] pyramid with all the different
[28:04] measurements breaking it down into
[28:05] different Mysteries what's in the
[28:09] Bible but you needed to study and and be
[28:13] well versed and be very much skilled for
[28:15] you to be able to read and know the
[28:19] pyramid and it has all the different
[28:21] seven steps leading into the king's
[28:23] chamber
[28:28] ing the seven Church ages until Christ
[28:30] comes unto his
[28:33] throne but not everyone was able to read
[28:35] the
[28:36] pyramid you'd have to wait for someone
[28:38] to come and explain it to
[28:42] you but we thank God we leave in a
[28:45] dispensation of the third
[28:48] Bible which is written in
[28:51] text you don't need a special kind of
[28:53] person to come and
[28:55] uh to tell you each and every one of us
[28:58] you can read your own
[29:02] Bible Hallelujah and you can read the
[29:05] mysteries of God from Genesis 1 to
[29:07] revelation 22 by
[29:11] yourself amen we thank God for
[29:14] that in the Bible we read about uh the
[29:17] unic from
[29:20] Ethiopia he was in his
[29:24] Chariot and he was reading in the book
[29:26] of Phillip I mean in the book of Isaiah
[29:30] and Phillip was at a
[29:34] convention and the spirit of God told
[29:36] him go over
[29:40] there and on his way going
[29:43] [Music]
[29:44] there he saw this un reading the the
[29:48] book of
[29:51] Isaiah and God told him get closer to
[29:55] him and when he got closer to him
[29:59] he asked him do you understand what you
[30:01] are
[30:02] reading the man didn't know what he was
[30:05] reading and says how am I going to
[30:09] understand if there's no one to explain
[30:11] this to
[30:12] me and Philip came and jumped into the
[30:16] Chariot and started explaining to him
[30:19] who Jesus Christ
[30:22] was and at the opening of the
[30:24] word at the expounding of the word
[30:28] this man called the
[30:30] Revelation and he says what forbids me
[30:32] to be
[30:34] baptized they saw a pool of water and
[30:36] both of them got
[30:40] in and the unic was
[30:43] baptized and when they got
[30:45] out the spirit of God took Phillip and
[30:48] took him
[30:51] elsewhere and he traveled like a
[30:55] thought amen this was in the book of
[30:59] so the same God who who wrote the book
[31:02] of
[31:03] Acts remember the book of Acts is the
[31:05] only book that is not punctuated with an
[31:12] amen it is like that so that the
[31:15] children of
[31:17] God the sons of God can continue writing
[31:20] the book of
[31:22] Acts because it is not the Acts of the
[31:26] Apostles but it is the book of the acts
[31:29] of the Holy Ghost in the
[31:34] apostles so if you have the Holy
[31:37] Ghost if you don't have it you need to
[31:39] ask for
[31:41] it so God can fill you with the Holy
[31:44] Ghost so you can perform the same
[31:48] acts so the Holy Ghost can perform the
[31:51] same act he was performing in those
[31:56] Apostles amen amen so you need to read
[31:59] the
[32:00] word and know what the word is saying
[32:02] about
[32:06] you and when you are reading there is
[32:09] there is you need to read in between the
[32:13] lines let's read on Israel and the
[32:15] church number
[32:18] two paragraph
[32:20] 54 the prophet of God says you know if
[32:24] you read the word right
[32:28] like this
[32:29] here it's all right but you sure miss
[32:31] the meanings of
[32:35] it the word is written between the
[32:39] lines Jesus said I've hided from the
[32:42] eyes of the wise and The
[32:47] Prudent and revealed it to babes such as
[32:50] we
[32:55] learn these theological seminaries are
[32:57] just like them priest was back
[33:04] there and the high priest and all of
[33:09] them that read the word but failed to
[33:11] see Jesus being the
[33:15] Christ
[33:16] so the Pharisees were people who devoted
[33:19] their whole life studying the
[33:25] [Music]
[33:26] word they knew the Scrolls from cover to
[33:34] cover and in the very word they were
[33:36] reading they knew that the Messiah was
[33:40] coming and they were preaching in the
[33:42] synagogue the Messiah is
[33:44] coming whilst at the same time the
[33:47] Messiah is just down the streets
[33:48] performing
[33:51] Miracles they missed the word because
[33:55] they were not reading in between the
[33:56] lines
[33:58] and it wasn't meant for
[34:00] them because the word Jesus says the
[34:03] word has been hidden from the eyes of
[34:05] the wise and the
[34:08] Prudence but it has been revealed to the
[34:10] predestinated the elected of
[34:13] God those who are willing to
[34:17] learn so Jesus was right in their
[34:21] midest and they are still waiting for
[34:23] him to
[34:25] come but he has already come
[34:29] and he was there walking performing
[34:33] Miracles they were busy criticizing and
[34:35] attacking
[34:36] him they didn't know the Messiah was
[34:38] actually
[34:40] coming someone knew he was the
[34:45] Messiah but they were not reading
[34:48] properly they thought he had come to
[34:50] fight and overthrow the Roman government
[34:58] but that's not what he had come
[35:00] for he had come to save you and
[35:03] me so those Pharisees and all who were
[35:06] reading the the Bible in a wrong
[35:11] way they missed him all
[35:14] together and they were saying he needs
[35:16] to be crucified because he's
[35:20] blaspheming but they were not reading
[35:22] right amen and every time you are
[35:25] reading the word right
[35:28] you need to see
[35:29] Christ Hallelujah huj in Christ is the
[35:32] mystery of God revealed the prophet of
[35:34] God
[35:35] says paragraph
[35:37] 121 he
[35:40] says he is the principal theme of the
[35:43] entire
[35:45] Bible if you read the Bible and don't
[35:48] see Christ in every verse in
[35:51] it go read it
[35:54] again hallelujah hallelujah if you can
[35:56] see Christ in every verse of the
[36:00] Bible then you read it again because
[36:03] you've missed
[36:05] something the Bible is
[36:08] Christ he is the word and when you read
[36:13] in the beginning God
[36:15] created there is Christ in
[36:18] there every from that to the Amen in the
[36:21] in Revelation
[36:27] is every word testifying of Jesus
[36:32] Christ amen so the prophet is telling is
[36:35] if you read the
[36:37] Bible and you read a verse and you don't
[36:39] see Christ in that
[36:41] verse you are not reading it
[36:44] right go back and read it
[36:46] right because Jesus is the principal
[36:49] theme of the
[36:52] Bible from Genesis 1 and
[36:55] 1 to revelation
[36:59] 22 and that's how you have to read
[37:02] it pure as it was
[37:05] given
[37:09] unadulterated in paragraph
[37:12] 130 he says and you inject something in
[37:16] there that does not make him the same
[37:19] yesterday today and
[37:22] forever if you add Creeds and dogmas in
[37:24] the word
[37:27] going to
[37:28] work so here we see the author is
[37:31] telling us how to read the
[37:36] word the word is telling us how to read
[37:38] the
[37:40] word for it to be effective in your
[37:45] life so how are you supposed to read the
[37:48] Bible when you read the Bible see Christ
[37:51] in each and every one of
[37:53] them if you have missed it go back and
[37:58] read
[37:58] it because that's where your blessing
[38:02] is hallelujah hallu so we know Christ is
[38:05] in the
[38:06] word because the the Bible tells us in
[38:08] the beginning was the
[38:10] word the word was with
[38:12] God and the Word was
[38:15] God amen amen and he goes on to say on
[38:20] that day you will know that I am in the
[38:23] Father the father in
[38:25] me and you are in me
[38:29] Hallelujah so when you are reading the
[38:32] Bible you are supposed to see
[38:35] Christ and you knowing that you are in
[38:39] Christ you are supposed to see yourself
[38:42] on the pages of the
[38:44] Bible because he is in the Father the
[38:47] father is in
[38:48] him and you are in him so Satan going to
[38:52] know he can't put your his dirty hands
[38:54] on
[38:55] you because you are he in
[38:58] Christ
[39:00] Hallelujah because um the word of God
[39:04] said in the beginning was the word and
[39:07] the Word was with
[39:08] God in the Greek original
[39:12] translation it says in the beginning was
[39:15] the Lo
[39:16] Ghost and the Lo ghost was with
[39:18] God and the Lo ghost was God and the
[39:22] logos is Jesus Christ so in the
[39:25] beginning was Jesus Christ
[39:27] and Jesus Christ was with
[39:29] God and Jesus Christ is
[39:32] God and that's in the
[39:35] word he is the
[39:37] word hallelujah hallu so you got to know
[39:40] I am in the
[39:42] word every time I read the
[39:44] Bible I got to see myself in
[39:47] it because I am in
[39:50] Christ Hallelujah when I read about
[39:53] Jesus
[39:54] Christ I shout amen because I know I am
[39:58] hid in
[39:59] Christ
[40:01] Glory that's the word read it
[40:04] right he comes to tell us how to read
[40:08] it Matthew Chapter 13 and verse
[40:13] 11 the disciples came to
[40:18] Jesus um 1310 let's start from
[40:23] 10 and the disciples came and said unto
[40:25] him
[40:28] why speakest thou unto them in
[40:32] Parables he answered unto he answered
[40:35] and said unto them because it is given
[40:38] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[40:39] kingdom of
[40:44] heaven but to them it is not
[40:48] given hallelujah amen so Jesus was
[40:51] teaching in
[40:54] Parables he was always telling stories
[40:59] and in those stories as much as they
[41:01] were
[41:03] simple they went as deep as they
[41:06] could and remember a parable is an
[41:08] Earthly story with a Heavenly
[41:16] meaning so in public Jesus would tell
[41:21] stories and they don't know what he's
[41:23] talking
[41:24] about but after the crowds had left
[41:28] he went in secret with his
[41:31] disciples and he started giving them
[41:35] Revelation and he started revealing what
[41:37] he was saying in
[41:39] public because he said this is not for
[41:43] them because it is not given for
[41:47] them but it is given to you to know the
[41:50] mysteries of the Kingdom of
[41:53] Heaven remember you are a prophetic
[41:55] class of people
[41:58] who supposed to hear prophetic
[42:03] utterances so when when you read the
[42:07] word you need that inside
[42:10] teacher that when you are by
[42:14] yourself he comes and give you that
[42:17] Revelation that each and everyone else
[42:19] does not
[42:21] have the Bible says God gave his
[42:25] son so that he could die for
[42:30] whosoever whosoever believes in
[42:32] him the world says he came to die for
[42:37] everyone no he did not he came to die
[42:41] for a special group of
[42:45] people and those people are
[42:49] whosoever those he didn't die
[42:52] for who refuse the grace that he gives
[42:55] them
[42:58] because that makes him that that make it
[42:59] seem like he's an unfair
[43:04] God many people struggle with
[43:10] predestination see God Is So
[43:14] unjust why would he choose before the
[43:16] foundation of the
[43:20] world who who his children the ones who
[43:23] were supposed to be in heaven
[43:27] and reject the
[43:29] others he said Jacob have I love and Es
[43:32] have I
[43:35] hated but God predestines by full
[43:41] knowledge so before you were
[43:44] born before he said let there be
[43:48] light he knew that you would accept his
[43:52] word and he knew those who would reject
[43:55] it
[43:58] and by his for knowledge and for
[44:01] knowing he predestinated
[44:04] you and you put your name in the
[44:07] book hallelujah hallelujah so these
[44:09] people whom it is not given
[44:13] to they don't understand
[44:17] it they won't even want
[44:20] it because they are not called to
[44:22] it but because you are called to it even
[44:27] if you don't understand it right then
[44:28] and then you believe it anyways because
[44:32] you know it is true because remember you
[44:35] and me we are not called to
[44:41] understand we are called to believe
[44:45] it and when Jesus was giving those
[44:48] Parables he starts saying he tells his
[44:50] disciples there was a
[44:52] man who had two
[44:54] sons one son decided to get his
[45:00] inheritance and the other one decided to
[45:02] stay the good
[45:05] boy and the one who was a rascal went
[45:10] away in the public they thought he was
[45:12] just giving a
[45:14] story but when he was giving the
[45:18] Revelation the disciples knew he was
[45:20] talking
[45:21] about and he was giving the uh parable
[45:24] of the prodal son
[45:28] says the son went away in a far away
[45:32] country he started messing with the
[45:34] wrong
[45:35] crowd lost everything he
[45:39] had became
[45:41] homeless and started leaving with the
[45:45] pigs and one day was he was leaving with
[45:48] the
[45:49] pigs he said and he
[45:52] thought he says but my father's servant
[45:57] they are eating better than what I'm
[45:58] eating right
[46:00] now I'm going to humble
[46:02] myself and go back to my father's
[46:06] house when he was giving the disciples
[46:08] the
[46:10] Revelation they got to know he was
[46:12] talking about
[46:15] them those who were
[46:18] predestinated and when this son realized
[46:20] it's time for me to go
[46:23] back he was homeless
[46:27] smelling bad old torn clothes
[46:35] probably he un
[46:38] camped and he decides I'm going
[46:42] home but when he was going on his way
[46:44] back
[46:46] home the story says the father saw him
[46:48] from AAR
[46:51] off the father was waiting by the
[46:55] gate he was waiting
[46:58] he was waiting for his
[46:59] son because he knew that one day one day
[47:03] one
[47:04] day my son would come
[47:07] back he has the same blood that's
[47:09] flowing in my
[47:11] veins and he was standing right there by
[47:13] the
[47:14] gate day after day cuz he knew his son
[47:18] was
[47:19] coming and then he saw him from afar
[47:22] off with his step and says that is my
[47:25] son
[47:27] Hallelujah and when the son came no
[47:30] matter how smelly he
[47:32] was no matter how bad he had
[47:36] gotten the father embraced
[47:38] him and says my son welcome
[47:42] home he was just telling a
[47:45] story but they didn't realize that he
[47:47] was talking about you and
[47:51] me remember the son did not lose his
[47:54] sunship when he went away
[47:59] he just lost the relationship with the
[48:02] father Hallelujah so you were a
[48:06] son you were born a
[48:09] son despite before you saw the
[48:13] light before you accepted Christ as your
[48:16] savior you were still a
[48:19] son the bad the evil that you did your
[48:22] sins does not take your sunship away
[48:24] from you
[48:28] but it is just
[48:30] repentance that brings you to the
[48:34] realization for you to know that I am a
[48:36] Son of
[48:38] God and you should know that at any time
[48:41] when your eyes are
[48:44] open no matter how much sin you have
[48:48] committed the father is always waiting
[48:51] for
[48:52] you he's always waiting with his arm
[48:54] stretched out
[48:57] welcome home my
[48:58] son welcome home my daughter it does not
[49:02] matter what you have
[49:04] done you will still my
[49:06] son don't let the devil bring
[49:09] condemnation on
[49:11] you you tell him I don't care what I
[49:13] have done in the
[49:14] past my past is my
[49:17] past I am going back to the
[49:20] father and when I go back to the
[49:23] father he's not going to make me stay
[49:25] with the servants
[49:28] I will stay in the house with my
[49:30] father because I am his
[49:33] son so he was talking to them in
[49:36] Parables amen amen so that's how you
[49:39] were supposed to read the
[49:42] word the author is telling you how to
[49:44] read the word of
[49:46] God see yourself in
[49:49] there every time
[49:51] you don't read the word right
[49:58] anytime the word is
[50:01] misinterpreted or
[50:03] misplaced it will bring mistreatment of
[50:10] people you have so many
[50:14] people who post Bible verses on their
[50:16] statuses each and every
[50:19] day and you be like oh that person is a
[50:22] Christian
[50:26] after you have spent two years posting
[50:29] those scriptures on your
[50:33] status how do you treat
[50:36] people because you can just be putting
[50:39] the word
[50:41] there but the word is not in you and so
[50:44] how readest
[50:46] thou remember the
[50:49] Pharisees they went and saw a woman who
[50:51] was committing
[50:53] adultery and they brought him to Jesus
[50:57] and they says we have caught this woman
[50:59] in
[51:01] adultery and they wanted to see how
[51:03] Jesus was going to
[51:06] [Music]
[51:07] act and they were using the scripture in
[51:11] Deuteronomy
[51:15] 22:22 that says if a person is caught
[51:17] committing
[51:22] adultery they supposed to be stoned
[51:27] and they brought the
[51:29] woman this holier than thou
[51:32] man but that was not the that was not
[51:35] the full
[51:37] word they were misplacing
[51:41] scripture and misinterpreting
[51:44] it the the word they were using the
[51:47] scripture they were
[51:49] using it says if a man and a woman are
[51:52] in adultery
[51:54] [Music]
[51:59] both of them are supposed to be
[52:01] stoned but due to their
[52:05] Prejudice and misinterpreting the
[52:08] word it caused them to mistreat
[52:12] her and they brought the woman only
[52:14] without the
[52:16] man and they said we saw
[52:19] her in the
[52:22] act so which means they saw the man and
[52:24] the woman
[52:27] but they let the man
[52:29] go and they caught the woman and he said
[52:32] you need to be
[52:34] stoned and then Jesus was there they
[52:38] were trying to test
[52:40] him and Jesus stood
[52:42] there and he says who he who doesn't
[52:46] have a
[52:48] sin throw your first
[52:51] stone throw your
[52:53] stone he knil down and he wrot something
[52:56] in the
[52:58] each and every person who came who just
[53:02] read one by one they all went
[53:06] away amen everyone went away within a
[53:10] few
[53:11] moments there was no one there Jesus
[53:14] came to the woman and
[53:16] said where are thy
[53:18] accusers there was none of
[53:21] them all of them had gone why because
[53:24] Jesus was using the same word
[53:28] but he was applying it
[53:30] correctly and the Word was
[53:33] Grace he says go see no
[53:36] more and it's just not go and repeat it
[53:41] again but when you apply the word
[53:44] right go and see no
[53:48] more hallelujah hallelujah so brothers
[53:50] and sisters you need to read the
[53:54] word the way God intended it for you and
[53:58] me that's the only way that word will
[54:02] have effect in your
[54:05] life in Hebrews chapter
[54:08] 9 uh
[54:10] 9:17 it says that a
[54:13] testament a testament is only of
[54:17] effect The Testament is only of effect
[54:20] when the testator is uh is dead
[54:27] for for a testament is of force after
[54:29] men are
[54:34] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[54:36] all while the testator
[54:40] leaveth so which means all the people
[54:42] who wrote those
[54:45] books those books were
[54:49] valued or they were of effect they were
[54:52] effective after the writers were dead
[54:58] amen so we know many
[55:00] religions there are many testators
[55:03] there who wrote the word who wrote their
[55:07] uh who wrote their
[55:09] word and after that they
[55:12] died but we know of one
[55:15] testator amen who wrote the New
[55:18] Testament he died but he didn't remain
[55:23] dead he got up and he is living in my
[55:27] soul Hallelujah so you know the test The
[55:32] Testament is only of
[55:34] effect when the testator is dead so the
[55:38] person who wrote it has to die
[55:41] first for that Testament to be
[55:44] effective so Muhammad wrote the
[55:48] Quran so the Quran is not
[55:52] effective wouldn't be effective until
[55:54] Muhammad died
[55:59] but here's the thing God wrote the
[56:01] word and this word is
[56:04] alive when you start reading the
[56:07] word the writer of the word will come to
[56:10] anoint
[56:12] you because remember he is the inside
[56:17] teacher so whenever you start talking
[56:19] about
[56:23] Jesus he comes right next to you
[56:27] remember those two men who were going to
[56:32] EMAs they were not just talking
[56:35] stories they were talking about Jesus
[56:38] and because they talked about
[56:40] him he came right there and he started
[56:44] revealing the
[56:46] word hallelujah so when you read the
[56:49] word when you start talking about the
[56:53] word the writer of the word comes
[56:56] to explain the the word to
[56:59] you and gives you the revelation of the
[57:02] word that you are
[57:04] reading that's why this is the only book
[57:06] that
[57:08] lives out of it flows
[57:13] life out of it is eternal
[57:17] life zo is the Life of Christ
[57:20] himself that's why each and every other
[57:23] religion is a false religion
[57:27] you can go read the
[57:29] Quran if we start reading the Quran
[57:32] right
[57:33] now Muhammad is buried in Saudi
[57:38] Arabia he's not going to come to explain
[57:40] you what's written in the
[57:42] Quran because he's dead and
[57:45] gone you have the
[57:47] Buddha they have their own
[57:50] Bibles but Buddha is not going to
[57:52] resurrect to come and explain that word
[57:53] to you
[57:58] you have Krishna over
[58:00] there they have their Bible when you
[58:03] start reading krishna's
[58:05] books he is not going to come and give
[58:08] you
[58:09] Revelation because it's a dead
[58:12] religion the only religion that is
[58:15] alive is the religion of Christ because
[58:19] he's the only one who
[58:21] resurrected and he can come and he gives
[58:23] you the revelation of the word
[58:26] Hallelujah huj so you talk about him you
[58:29] know he's coming and I can tell you this
[58:32] evening that he is in this place
[58:36] Hallelujah why am I saying that because
[58:39] the word of God tells
[58:40] me whereever two or three are gathered
[58:43] in my
[58:45] name he said I'm there in their
[58:47] minut so all you need to do is reach out
[58:50] to
[58:51] him and when you reach out to him you
[58:55] can touch him
[58:57] remember that woman who had an issue of
[59:00] blood all she did she just reached
[59:03] out and she touched the Hem of His
[59:06] Garment and she was healed
[59:10] immediately he was the word that was
[59:12] walking on two
[59:15] feet Hallelujah hallu so if you read in
[59:18] between the
[59:19] lines the Messiah the master will come
[59:22] and explain it to you
[59:26] and he will give you the revelation of
[59:28] it the prophet of God says every time I
[59:32] travel my wife my wife writes me
[59:36] letters you can take that the letter his
[59:39] wife wrote to
[59:41] him you're not going to see nothing
[59:44] there but when he reads it he probably
[59:47] already knows where she is seated when
[59:49] she's writing that
[59:52] letter and in one line
[59:56] there is so much that said right
[59:58] there but because you don't have a
[1:00:00] relationship with
[1:00:02] her you do not know
[1:00:05] nothing except for what is
[1:00:08] seen when you have a re when you have a
[1:00:12] relationship with the author of the word
[1:00:15] he will come and show you what's written
[1:00:17] in between the
[1:00:19] lines and he will reveal all the
[1:00:23] Mysteries that is in there Hallelujah so
[1:00:27] remember Christ is in the
[1:00:29] word and you are supposed to see
[1:00:31] yourself in the
[1:00:33] Bible hallelujah hallelujah there's a
[1:00:35] story of this young
[1:00:37] boy who went to visit his
[1:00:42] relatives so this boy used to live in
[1:00:44] The
[1:00:46] Villages he had never seen um he wasn't
[1:00:49] exposed to to to
[1:00:52] civilization and then whilst he was
[1:00:54] wandering around the and his
[1:01:00] property he just started walking
[1:01:03] around and he saw
[1:01:05] himself he saw himself looking at
[1:01:11] him he waves his
[1:01:14] hands the person who looks like him
[1:01:18] waving at
[1:01:21] him he jumps over to this
[1:01:24] side the person in the the person over
[1:01:26] there jumps over as
[1:01:28] well waves the other
[1:01:31] hand the person waves back he starts
[1:01:34] jumping up and
[1:01:36] down the person started jumping up and
[1:01:39] down as
[1:01:40] well he had never seen it
[1:01:43] before he was looking in the
[1:01:46] mirror he had never seen a mirror before
[1:01:49] but because he saw his
[1:01:52] reflection he went off running to his
[1:01:54] mama
[1:01:56] and he says Mama that is me I saw myself
[1:02:01] in the
[1:02:03] mirror Hallelujah each and every time
[1:02:06] you come to
[1:02:07] church you are coming to look yourself
[1:02:09] in the mirror of the
[1:02:11] word all the promises in the word of
[1:02:14] God you are seeing
[1:02:17] yourself and when you see yourself in
[1:02:19] the word you got to jump for joy and you
[1:02:23] say mama that is me in
[1:02:27] I know it is talking about
[1:02:29] me
[1:02:31] Hallelujah one person was given a spoken
[1:02:35] word and he started reading and he he
[1:02:37] brought it back to his
[1:02:40] friend say the book that you gave me is
[1:02:43] calling me a
[1:02:50] bazard voucher
[1:02:56] and he says the book that you gave me is
[1:02:57] calling me a
[1:03:00] voucher and he was
[1:03:04] mad not a c a
[1:03:10] voucher whatever voucher is and he said
[1:03:13] the book you gave me is calling me a
[1:03:16] voucher and the friend says that's
[1:03:22] surprising he says that's
[1:03:24] surprising because the same book that
[1:03:26] you're talking
[1:03:28] about just told me that I'm an
[1:03:30] eagle how readest thou the person saw
[1:03:34] themselves at the
[1:03:36] bazard so the word of God does not lie
[1:03:39] to
[1:03:40] you it just shows you who you
[1:03:43] are if you hold up a
[1:03:46] mirror it's not going to show you
[1:03:48] someone
[1:03:48] else it is just going to show you as who
[1:03:51] you
[1:03:52] are amen amen so this brother saw him
[1:03:55] self as a as an
[1:03:58] eagle because he was reading the word
[1:04:02] right amen and when you see yourself in
[1:04:05] the
[1:04:06] word you can see that God is talking
[1:04:09] about
[1:04:10] you and remember God uh in the in the
[1:04:14] verse we read
[1:04:15] earlier Jesus told these disciples that
[1:04:18] these
[1:04:19] Mysteries the mysteries of the Kingdom
[1:04:21] of
[1:04:22] Heaven are meant for you
[1:04:26] Hallelujah so when the Mysteries are
[1:04:29] revealed they are for a chosen
[1:04:33] people and your name is written in the
[1:04:37] book so your name being written in the
[1:04:41] book it's not written as a government
[1:04:46] name because your government name is how
[1:04:48] you are
[1:04:50] known when the Pharisees came to John
[1:04:53] the Baptist
[1:04:56] they asked him when the Pharisees went
[1:04:58] to John the
[1:05:01] Baptist they asked
[1:05:04] him who are you are you uh are you are
[1:05:09] you the prophet who supposed to
[1:05:15] come are you the
[1:05:18] Messiah and John didn't he says no no
[1:05:22] John could have said I am zechariah's
[1:05:25] son
[1:05:28] Zechariah was a priest he would have
[1:05:29] used these credentials and say yeah you
[1:05:30] know him my father is one of you I'm
[1:05:32] zechariah's
[1:05:35] son but he didn't give his name when
[1:05:39] they asked him who he was he said I am
[1:05:42] the
[1:05:43] voice of the one crying in the
[1:05:47] wilderness that was his
[1:05:49] name and his name that was written in
[1:05:54] Isaiah so when he was asked what's his
[1:05:59] name he gave the name that the Bible was
[1:06:01] talking about
[1:06:04] him he didn't say I'm John the
[1:06:07] Baptist he says I'm the voice of the one
[1:06:09] who cries in the
[1:06:11] wilderness he was identifying himself
[1:06:14] with the
[1:06:15] word he was identifying himself with
[1:06:18] what he had seen himself to
[1:06:22] be in the mirror of the word of God
[1:06:26] many people say we don't see William
[1:06:28] Bram in the
[1:06:30] word sure because his his name read from
[1:06:33] Genesis 1 to revelation 22 there is
[1:06:36] nowhere written William
[1:06:39] brandham but we call him malach
[1:06:42] 4 because that's his characteristics in
[1:06:45] the
[1:06:47] Bible so that's his
[1:06:49] name in the Bible what is your name your
[1:06:54] name is the mystery that is in the
[1:06:57] Bible Hallelujah so John was the
[1:07:01] word the V the voice of the one crying
[1:07:04] in the wilderness he was
[1:07:06] the he was that word made
[1:07:10] flesh walking on two
[1:07:14] feet William Bram was Malachi
[1:07:18] 45 walking on two
[1:07:21] feet you are the bre of Christ
[1:07:26] you are supposed to be the
[1:07:28] word the word made
[1:07:31] flesh Hallelujah huj so in the mysteries
[1:07:34] of the
[1:07:36] book your name is in there remember your
[1:07:39] name was written in the lamp's book of
[1:07:43] life before the foundation of the
[1:07:47] world there is a book of
[1:07:50] life that contains names of each and
[1:07:53] every one of those who ever lived
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:58] and in that book of life your name can
[1:07:59] be blotted
[1:08:02] out then there is a lamb section of the
[1:08:05] book of
[1:08:09] life that contains your name and my
[1:08:13] name those who are predestinated those
[1:08:16] who are called
[1:08:17] out and your name can never ever be
[1:08:20] taken out of the L Book of
[1:08:23] Life Hallelujah because Jesus said all
[1:08:26] of them that you gave unto
[1:08:29] me I will lose none of
[1:08:31] them so if your name is in the
[1:08:34] book written before the foundation of
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:37] world remember Satan can't do nothing
[1:08:39] about
[1:08:41] it because he wasn't there when it was
[1:08:45] written Hallelujah huj so if your name
[1:08:47] was in the book was written in the
[1:08:49] Lamb's Book of
[1:08:50] Life before the foundation of the
[1:08:53] world nothing can happen to to
[1:08:56] you Satan cannot do you no
[1:08:59] harm he can take you
[1:09:02] out because he's not the one who put you
[1:09:06] in hallelujah hallelujah so your name
[1:09:08] was in The lamp's Book of
[1:09:11] Life and when Jesus came to die on the
[1:09:14] cross he was dying for those name who
[1:09:17] was in the lamb section Book of
[1:09:22] Life when he was in that Garden of G
[1:09:27] and he says Lord if it was up to
[1:09:31] me I let this car
[1:09:34] pass and remember he had an
[1:09:37] option to not go to
[1:09:40] Calvary he could have just decided like
[1:09:42] never
[1:09:44] mind I'll will go live a nice
[1:09:48] life he grew up being a
[1:09:51] carpenter he could have opened a
[1:09:53] carpentry shop
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:57] go get himself a wife and get some
[1:10:01] kids and leave a nice life but while he
[1:10:05] was in The Garden of
[1:10:07] Gethsemane he saw the names of those
[1:10:09] that were in the
[1:10:12] book he saw
[1:10:14] you he saw me then he says
[1:10:18] nevertheless not my will but let your
[1:10:22] will be
[1:10:23] done and I will go all the way to the
[1:10:27] cross and he went via
[1:10:32] delosa suffered all the way for you and
[1:10:36] me and he shed his blood for you and me
[1:10:41] because he had to
[1:10:43] redeem all the names that were in the
[1:10:46] lamp's book of
[1:10:47] life so you can never ever be
[1:10:51] lost amen amen
[1:10:56] Paul in Philip chapter 4 verse
[1:11:01] one he says and I in treat thee
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] also through your
[1:11:10] fellow I probably copied it wrong find
[1:11:13] it you can find it and I entreat thee
[1:11:17] also
[1:11:20] Philippians and I entreat thee also
[1:11:25] true your
[1:11:30] fellow help those women which labored
[1:11:34] with me in the
[1:11:39] gospel oh there you go thank you and I
[1:11:41] entreat thee
[1:11:44] also true your fellow help those women
[1:11:47] which labored with me in the
[1:11:49] gospel with Clement also
[1:11:55] and with other my fellow
[1:11:59] laborers whose names are in the Book of
[1:12:03] Life how did Paul know that their name
[1:12:06] Clement's name was in the book of
[1:12:11] life because he was the messenger of the
[1:12:15] age he was the messenger of
[1:12:19] Ephesus so every time God brings in a
[1:12:23] new age
[1:12:26] he reveals
[1:12:28] Mysteries and when the mystery is
[1:12:31] revealed the messenger of the edge he
[1:12:33] catches
[1:12:35] it and the Mystery is not hidden
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:40] anymore and then he takes that revealed
[1:12:42] mystery and gives it to the
[1:12:46] people those that are
[1:12:50] predestinated so it's only those who are
[1:12:52] predestinated who have their names in
[1:12:54] the Lamb's Book of
[1:12:57] life so how did Paul
[1:13:00] know because he was the messenger of the
[1:13:03] age given that
[1:13:06] Revelation to catch the whole mystery of
[1:13:08] God for that gen for that uh for that
[1:13:12] age and who has believed our report in
[1:13:15] paragraph
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:18] 41 here the prophet of God says God in
[1:13:22] Jesus Christ's name
[1:13:25] I pray that you heal the
[1:13:27] woman Grant it save her from every
[1:13:33] sin forgive every sin that she
[1:13:36] did as she stood here before these many
[1:13:39] thousand
[1:13:42] people with their hands up and she
[1:13:44] believes and accepts
[1:13:48] you as uh you as her
[1:13:52] savior look at this we know at this very
[1:13:58] moment her name is written in the Lamb's
[1:14:01] Book of
[1:14:03] Life for she has confessed you before
[1:14:07] man how did William Bram know that this
[1:14:10] woman's name was in the Lamb's Book of
[1:14:14] Life because he is the one God sent with
[1:14:16] the
[1:14:19] mystery he's the one God revealed the
[1:14:21] mystery
[1:14:23] to so that he can tell the people of
[1:14:27] this uh Leia generation
[1:14:31] age to catch that
[1:14:33] mystery so the messenger of the age who
[1:14:37] is on Earth at the
[1:14:42] time he catches that
[1:14:45] mystery and that mystery becomes his
[1:14:49] ministry Hallelujah cuz remember in
[1:14:53] Revelation amen amen that the by the
[1:14:56] time the seventh angel begins to
[1:15:00] sound all the mysteries of God should be
[1:15:04] finished so all the Mysteries would have
[1:15:06] been
[1:15:08] opened and he will start preaching that
[1:15:11] mystery and in that
[1:15:14] mystery you will hear your name being
[1:15:17] called your name is not
[1:15:21] John is not written as
[1:15:23] Paul your name is not written as
[1:15:27] Jack that's not how you see your name in
[1:15:29] The Book of
[1:15:31] Life but your name is said in the
[1:15:36] characteristics so when you hear that
[1:15:38] mystery being
[1:15:40] said when you hear that mystery being
[1:15:44] revealed you hear your name being
[1:15:47] called something attach something in you
[1:15:50] attaches to
[1:15:52] it because you have been called for that
[1:15:55] age and you have been called to that
[1:15:58] Ministry to that
[1:16:00] mystery Hallelujah so the the will of
[1:16:03] God for your
[1:16:05] age is the message of the hour so the
[1:16:08] message of the hour is calling out your
[1:16:11] name come out of here my
[1:16:14] people you are seated where you are
[1:16:16] seated right
[1:16:17] there because you heard your name being
[1:16:20] called Hallelujah and those that he
[1:16:23] called
[1:16:25] he will never lose any one of them amen
[1:16:28] because that's his people hallelujah so
[1:16:32] how do you read read it the way God
[1:16:35] intended it for
[1:16:36] you and when he has revealed and called
[1:16:39] out your
[1:16:41] name you got to he to that
[1:16:44] call Hallelujah because your name is
[1:16:46] written in the lamb section in The Book
[1:16:48] of
[1:16:52] Life Satan can do you no harm
[1:16:56] Hallelujah let us stand upon our
[1:16:59] feet amen amen we thank God for the
[1:17:02] message of the
[1:17:04] hour that came to open our
[1:17:08] eyes and let us know that our names are
[1:17:11] written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:15] Life and that will never ever
[1:17:19] change remember the story of Mama eag
[1:17:27] she had her
[1:17:29] egg and the farmer took the egg and put
[1:17:32] it in their
