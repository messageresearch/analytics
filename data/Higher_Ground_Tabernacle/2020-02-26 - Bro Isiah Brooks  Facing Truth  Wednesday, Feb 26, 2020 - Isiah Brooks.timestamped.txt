[30:45] [Music]
[30:48] fathers good to us
[30:53] that is turned by God's grace to a
[30:57] passage of scripture proverbs 27
[31:04] proverbs 27
[31:15] and we're going to read the 19th verse
[31:17] of proverbs
[31:35] as in water face
[31:39] answer it to face
[31:42] so the heart of man
[31:45] to man
[31:48] one more Scripture
[31:57] st. John 16
[32:35] st. John 16 let us reason beginning at
[32:40] the seventh hour 12th verse
[32:43] 12 I
[32:45] have yet many things to say unto you
[32:48] but you cannot bear them now
[32:51] howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has
[32:54] come he will guide you into all truth
[32:57] for he shall not speak of himself but
[33:01] whatsoever he shall bear hear scuse me
[33:03] that shall he speak and he will show you
[33:06] things to come
[33:08] he should glorify me but he shall
[33:11] receive a mind and shall show it unto
[33:14] you all things that the father has are
[33:17] mine therefore said I that he shall take
[33:21] of mine and shall show it unto you a
[33:24] little while and you shall not see me
[33:26] again in a little while and yet you
[33:29] shall see me because I go to the Father
[33:32] let us pray father God we come before
[33:35] your Lord as humbly as we know how we
[33:37] thank you for being so good to us we
[33:40] thank you for this time of
[33:42] reverence and
[33:44] consecration Lord we thank you for the
[33:47] word we pray father that you give us
[33:48] grace tonight cleanses of all our
[33:51] unrighteousness Lord speak through these
[33:53] lips of clay may you O God open our
[33:56] hearts to receive in your name Jesus
[33:58] Christ your Divine Word in Jesus
[34:01] Christ's name we pray amen
[34:03] you may be seated
[34:08] just the other day I was thinking
[34:14] just reminiscing and thinking about the
[34:17] message as a whole
[34:18] whole
[34:20] and I thought about all of the things
[34:24] that we as believers have come through
[34:28] the various things that we have
[34:31] had a tendency to
[34:35] see that others that could not see I
[34:39] was thinking about the
[34:42] Hoffman head and
[34:47] I know that when I was a young man I saw
[34:50] Jesus Christ for the first time and that
[34:52] was in a dream all dreams are not true
[34:55] but I really believe that the dream in
[34:56] which I had seen was true because
[34:59] once I came into the message I saw where
[35:02] brother Branham talked about the halton
[35:05] head which was the closest
[35:07] image of him and just the other day I
[35:12] thought to myself because all these
[35:15] years I had thought in my head he was he
[35:18] had brown eyes and their brother branham
[35:23] said he had blue and
[35:25] you know you think to yourself
[35:29] how so many people take an image and
[35:33] that's all of the Christ they have
[35:38] God is more than the picture on the wall
[35:42] you see so many people look at things
[35:46] and I remember a man coming and telling
[35:49] me that I wasn't in the message because
[35:51] I didn't have a picture of the image of
[35:53] the cloud
[35:55] sad
[35:57] because what good with the image of the
[35:59] cloud I don't have it in here but I do
[36:00] have it in my office now look but even
[36:04] if I didn't have it the image of the
[36:07] cloud won't help me if it's not in my
[36:08] heart I
[36:11] think about the pillar fire were brother
[36:13] Branham said and so many people are
[36:16] offended by that I think because they
[36:19] don't understand that the picture is not
[36:21] a picture of brother Branham it's a
[36:22] picture of the pillar father
[36:24] they get it all mixed up but even having
[36:27] that in your house doesn't sanctify you
[36:29] it doesn't declare who you are and
[36:33] trinkets and things of that nature
[36:36] images are there that nature can deceive
[36:38] people to make them think that they have
[36:41] something that they do not have so I
[36:44] thought our Minister a little bit over
[36:47] on the topic because I've been dealing
[36:49] with a stir and vasti and things of that
[36:52] nature I love it and I feel like before
[36:55] it's all done I'll chew that gum a
[36:57] little bit longer but I wanted to
[37:00] say give a thought tonight
[37:02] because I had totally forgotten about
[37:05] that one scripture that I read about
[37:06] proverbs and one thing about some truth
[37:10] is you can't get away from it and
[37:12] when you looking into a glass or looking
[37:16] into water that that still it gives you
[37:18] a mirror effect
[37:20] when you look into that water you see
[37:23] your image and you can't deny it it is
[37:25] what it is and I think a lot of time
[37:28] Christians they want to fake it but one
[37:31] thing for certain you can't fake
[37:33] religion you can't fake fake
[37:35] Christianity no matter how we try as the
[37:40] scripture says as in water
[37:43] face answer is to faith
[37:46] that's you and this Mara this mirror
[37:51] this water of the word we'll always
[37:53] answer to your face
[37:55] whatever the image is it will reflect
[37:58] right back to you what it is and I like
[38:02] as it went on to say so the heart of a
[38:05] man answered to man our people like to
[38:09] say well you can't judge me
[38:11] but they don't understand what's in your
[38:14] heart is is reflecting
[38:16] to others on the outside and I think
[38:20] this is what people must understand
[38:22] what's in your heart is the reflection
[38:25] of who you are it's going to show itself
[38:28] as clearly as a mirror will reflect your
[38:31] image your heart is going to reflect
[38:34] your being and we look at this thing we
[38:37] said well people said well you can't
[38:39] just judge me by the way I appear what
[38:41] my look or the way I dress yes I don't
[38:44] have to judge you because your heart is
[38:47] judging you your heart is
[38:50] projecting what's only inside of you
[38:54] amen and so you say well why are you
[38:58] preaching on this because my subject
[39:02] tonight would be facing truth
[39:05] facing truth and oftentimes people don't
[39:08] want to face truth all the time people
[39:11] want to believe
[39:14] something about themselves that is a lie
[39:16] and the only thing that we can can judge
[39:20] us is the Word of God and it's going to
[39:22] plainly tell you who you are what you
[39:25] are where you've been where you're going
[39:28] it's nothing that you can get away from
[39:30] it is very the very mirror of God it
[39:34] will reflect to you who you are your
[39:38] actions the places you go the people you
[39:42] hang with
[39:44] reflects
[39:46] character
[39:48] what's only inside of you because your
[39:51] brother Brooks if we're living in the
[39:54] last days and one thing for certain we
[39:57] can't get away from it the way the Bible
[40:01] is true not one word of God will come
[40:04] back to him boy that's the truth and the
[40:07] Bible said that God cannot lie
[40:10] so if God cannot lie that means that
[40:13] this word is absolutely the truth
[40:16] you and I we fail to understand that
[40:19] sometimes even when we we
[40:22] how can I say fail to believe the Word
[40:26] of God in some way we're actually
[40:31] calling God a lie and the Bible said
[40:35] that God cannot lie I was talking with a
[40:39] brother today and we were at lunch
[40:41] brother Keith to be exact and we were
[40:44] talking he was telling me about some of
[40:45] the people up state the word really no
[40:48] like if they state to you something
[40:49] that's factual and you said really to
[40:53] them there you're telling them that
[40:56] you're not quite sure they're telling
[40:58] you the truth so it becomes somewhat
[41:00] offensive you know what I mean because
[41:02] why would you say really if they told
[41:05] you the truth the truth is real
[41:07] it is the lie that is the fake it is the
[41:11] lie that is that the imposter but truth
[41:13] is always real the fact truth is so real
[41:18] the Bible said it will make you free
[41:21] right it didn't say set you free it says
[41:25] make you free
[41:27] because truth is God
[41:29] outside of God there is no truth and you
[41:34] said what brothers why are you preaching
[41:35] these things because I don't want
[41:38] anybody lying to themselves I find out
[41:41] that so many times when we're preaching
[41:43] and and and and and even a brother
[41:45] branham said you know there's some of
[41:47] you are you should be up to the altar
[41:50] you should be repenting I can't believe
[41:53] that you raised your hand saying that
[41:56] you need God and then won't come up to
[41:59] acknowledge God see what was he trying
[42:02] to do he was trying to portray truth be
[42:05] truthful about it be real about it don't
[42:08] be a hypocrite be real about it but we
[42:12] find out that people when they need help
[42:15] they often times are embarrassed and
[42:18] don't don't they don't realize that
[42:21] embarrassment only comes because you
[42:23] have a pride level or a level of pride
[42:26] if you didn't have a level of pride
[42:28] you'll be like the woman with the issue
[42:30] of blood I don't care what it takes for
[42:33] me to get to Christ I'm going there
[42:35] you'll be like the woman that met Jesus
[42:38] at Simon's house
[42:40] determine to know the truth determined
[42:43] to face the truth she was willing to get
[42:46] in front of the word and she could care
[42:50] less what he said about her she just
[42:52] knew she had one thing in mind and that
[42:54] is what to be made free is that right
[42:57] she was willing to let the word call her
[43:00] anything and he could have I'm sure he
[43:05] had a list of things that he had that he
[43:07] could have said to her that perhaps
[43:09] would have embarrassed her but the Bible
[43:12] said he didn't open up his mouth why
[43:15] because God recognized Jesus recognized
[43:18] who that lady was and that she was sent
[43:22] to minister to him see that's what
[43:25] brother Branham said he said one thing
[43:26] about it he said God when it comes to
[43:29] worship he let you worship he will let
[43:32] you worship Him he will not hinder your
[43:36] worship
[43:38] even when you have
[43:40] your life is not right he will not
[43:42] hinder your worship because one thing
[43:44] about about Jesus if you get in the true
[43:47] true spirit of God it will cause you to
[43:50] repent
[43:53] it's more than a picture on the wall
[43:56] having pictures on your wall everywhere
[43:59] you go what difference does it make it's
[44:01] like having a cross around your neck
[44:02] that doesn't give you in a power
[44:05] the thing that gives you power is the
[44:08] Holy Ghost within that's the truth after
[44:11] which the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[44:14] you shall receive power and that is
[44:17] Authority and my thing is if that is
[44:21] true then the Holy Ghost in us is power
[44:24] its authority but let's not fake it
[44:30] that's not fake it
[44:32] i'ma read a quote here
[44:35] because you and I must understand that
[44:37] being religious does not necessarily
[44:40] make you a connected with Christ
[44:42] there are a lot of churchgoers there's a
[44:45] lot of church people but we need to be
[44:47] connected and the only way that we can
[44:49] be connected is by the Holy Ghost and
[44:51] the Holy Ghost is not a figment of an
[44:54] imagination it is real the Holy Ghost is
[44:58] God can you tell me how can God be in
[45:01] you and become powerless
[45:09] there's only one way that makes a
[45:13] God's Word void and that is the
[45:17] tradition of men
[45:21] tradition of N and you shackles God with
[45:25] unbelief
[45:27] because even in Capernaum Jesus wanted
[45:31] to do a lot of things
[45:32] when he was there amen in in in Nazareth
[45:36] the Bible said he couldn't do many
[45:37] things because of their unbelief
[45:40] so unbelief is one of those factions
[45:44] that can actually hinder God
[45:47] the prophet of God tells us that there
[45:50] are two
[45:53] factions in the earth tonight
[45:56] the believer and the unbeliever
[45:59] the one the Lord is coming to receive
[46:02] and the one that the Lord is coming to
[46:05] condemn and is coming and is coming will
[46:10] bless one and will curse the other and
[46:14] it's appearing so you got to understand
[46:17] Amen this is what we're talking about
[46:19] listen it's it's like oh
[46:22] I'm bride but saying you're bride
[46:24] doesn't make you bride
[46:27] bride is a condition is the place where
[46:31] God sets you
[46:33] and as we've said they've been
[46:37] throughout ages many who have become
[46:39] bride bride bride bride but they never
[46:42] measure up to be bride so they cancelled
[46:44] out
[46:47] you know not being
[46:50] connected with God is like having false
[46:53] teeth or false arm it works they work if
[46:58] you need them it's all right to have it
[47:02] but it's not connected
[47:05] it's not connected and how they're
[47:07] trying to connect teeth but it doesn't
[47:09] matter how they screw in they still not
[47:11] part of you
[47:13] nothing wrong with that
[47:15] but you and I must put on the fight I
[47:18] think we think that coming becoming a
[47:21] Christian he's supposed to becoming a
[47:23] church and just laying back and taking
[47:25] it easy in Zion this is a war we're in a
[47:28] warfare and if we forget we're in a
[47:30] warfare Satan will take advantage of you
[47:35] since when we take our pledge to Christ
[47:39] if we don't become part of him like a
[47:43] woman ought to become part of a man and
[47:45] a man part of the woman then we're
[47:48] artificial Christians I think I read
[47:50] this the last time we're not really
[47:52] you're really not married to the woman
[47:55] you might be lawyer and if you don't
[47:58] love your husband and him 60 or 70 years
[48:01] old and you don't love him as good as
[48:03] you did beginning then you really just
[48:06] raising his children that's the way the
[48:09] churches are too many today we're just
[48:12] thinking the name of Christian Church
[48:15] pretending to be the bride when it's
[48:18] artificially we're not connected with
[48:21] Christ in any way we're like an
[48:24] artificial tooth or artificial arm or
[48:27] artificial I see is something that
[48:30] artificial and we're just putting it on
[48:33] well you can't put on Christianity
[48:36] you've got to be connected with it and
[48:40] the church that's just artificial called
[48:45] the Church of Christ well them children
[48:48] men are not in there that's born of that
[48:51] same organization is only see they're
[48:54] not crisis children they are
[48:57] denominational children and not the
[49:00] children of Christ that's why some
[49:03] people can't leave their organizations
[49:05] and their denominations because they're
[49:08] born of another seed they're born of a
[49:11] denominational seed and they think
[49:14] they're the children of Christ when
[49:16] they're not because of the children of
[49:17] Christ are born of the word and by the
[49:20] word and will say amen to
[49:24] every word
[49:26] if the woman isn't connected with the
[49:28] man and trueness then it isn't her
[49:31] husband it's just a man she's taken a
[49:35] vow to live with and she took her own
[49:38] God she pledged to love him and she said
[49:42] she loved him and she didn't do it all
[49:45] the time the man is deceived but there's
[49:48] one thing sure friends we're not going
[49:52] to deceive Christ he knows his own but
[49:56] you see first decision made next
[49:59] engagement then promise and then the
[50:02] ceremony and that's when the bride takes
[50:05] the bridegroom's name she's no more than
[50:09] of her own name she takes the bridegroom
[50:12] name and then when the church has the
[50:15] ceremony makes their promises then she
[50:19] takes the bridegroom name then she is no
[50:22] longer a church of the world she's a
[50:24] Church of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[50:27] don't mean that by name I mean that by
[50:31] birth by nature by power of God y'all
[50:35] understand me is not a name the name can
[50:38] be like a picture on the wall
[50:40] it's got to be by birth it's gotta be by
[50:44] power it's got to be by nature it has to
[50:48] be a change in the individual that
[50:51] individual bears the name of Jesus when
[50:54] the Holy Ghost comes in because the Holy
[50:56] Ghost is the character of Jesus and at
[50:59] that time she is the church she is a
[51:03] bride of Christ
[51:04] everything else it's artificial
[51:07] until we make it right what is truth thy
[51:12] Word is truth
[51:14] truth of God in the heart see in the
[51:19] heart is that right he said you know in
[51:23] that day I'm in the father the father's
[51:25] in me and I am in in you in that day
[51:28] you'll know there ain't no guesswork
[51:32] it's a reality of knowing that crisis
[51:36] only is uh y'all better hear me because
[51:39] let me tell you something God will bless
[51:41] you
[51:42] just by saying the name of Jesus but
[51:47] because he are blessing you because you
[51:49] say the name of Jesus Christ doesn't
[51:51] mean that you eternally saved
[51:56] the children of Israel were blessed by
[51:59] God in the wilderness under the name of
[52:02] Jehovah he fed them he clothed them for
[52:06] forty years like brother Adam saying
[52:09] they didn't need no other position they
[52:11] had Moses
[52:18] captain disease-free and
[52:22] yet they died
[52:24] why because they were not connected
[52:28] they were artificial
[52:31] and that's the thing that I've been
[52:34] trying to tell everybody he can't be
[52:37] don't let Satan make you be a put on a
[52:41] put on Christian you know it takes a
[52:45] birth it takes a change of nature to
[52:49] produce Christ otherwise you're just
[52:52] putting on
[52:55] and I'm not trying to hurt anybody's
[52:57] feelings I'm trying to make us see what
[53:00] truth is are we going to accept the
[53:04] conditioning in that that we are
[53:07] standing in knowing that the raptures at
[53:09] hand knowing that the coming of the Lord
[53:11] is at head and we're still in a
[53:13] condition that we know we know we know
[53:15] that we're not rapture ready
[53:21] help us Lord that's all I'm all I'm
[53:24] trying to do is appeal to your soul and
[53:26] your spirit so that you can face truth
[53:28] and then do something about it
[53:30] what God is going to pull you through a
[53:32] to God ain't gonna make it just warn and
[53:35] make it happen no sir there's something
[53:38] you must do
[53:40] the first thing that God told illiteracy
[53:43] in church was to do what repent and be
[53:46] zealous to repent but where is
[53:49] repentance where is that
[53:52] we find that so many people don't even
[53:55] know what repentance is they think it's
[53:56] just oh I'm sorry no repentance has a
[54:00] zeal behind it a zeal to a change in a
[54:04] zeal to turn and a zeal to never do that
[54:07] thing ever again that's what we're
[54:10] Pintas is
[54:13] the truth of God must be in the heart
[54:15] she becomes a Christian Church the great
[54:19] Universal Apostolic Christian Church
[54:21] she's it becomes a part of Christ and
[54:25] when she does that she Christ this is
[54:28] what I like Christ injects into her his
[54:33] own spirit his old life hello God puts
[54:38] in you his own spirit that means yours
[54:41] had gone away with that like you used to
[54:46] have it's gone
[54:50] and people always says well it all
[54:53] depends on which dog you feed
[54:56] but somewhere if you don't feed the
[54:58] black dog he's gonna die
[55:01] you can't keep using that he was giving
[55:05] an illustration which one rules which
[55:07] one rules the black dog or the white dog
[55:09] and the Indians chief said well the one
[55:13] you feed the most - think about it if
[55:16] you continue to feed the white dog or
[55:19] the does regenerated person of your part
[55:23] the other one has to die
[55:25] death has to come somewhere and whether
[55:29] you believe it or not
[55:31] you can shake your head and you can do
[55:34] whatever you want to but I'm gonna tell
[55:35] you something God is calling for
[55:37] perfection
[55:38] now you can define what that perfection
[55:41] is but Jesus said without spot wrinkle
[55:44] or blemish
[55:47] don't get rich juice for the Flint is
[55:49] that right about you don't even make
[55:51] provision for the flesh
[55:53] and you not must understand by God's
[55:56] grace that when it comes to reality
[55:58] you say well I'm gonna displace is gonna
[56:01] always be sticky but guess what you are
[56:05] supposed to always rule over it if you
[56:08] keep saying within your mind oh well
[56:10] it's going to happen it's going to
[56:12] always happen but if you believe that
[56:14] you can truly die listen maybe I'm wrong
[56:17] but the Bible said that God is coming
[56:20] for a bride without spot wrinkle or
[56:23] blemish that doesn't sound like seeing
[56:25] his ruling
[56:28] it sounds like she is so in control that
[56:31] she has become literally the Word of God
[56:33] this flesh must become the word because
[56:37] the word became flesh we don't stop with
[56:40] this ninety nine and a half percent God
[56:43] won't say 100 percent
[56:46] you can't say you're a Christian if you
[56:49] do not believe that the life of Christ
[56:51] can make you perfect
[56:53] literally because it's got to be
[56:56] perfection in here so this thing can
[56:59] ever change
[57:00] can't change is not done until 100% is
[57:04] made manifest
[57:05] maybe I got it all wrong but that's what
[57:08] I'm pressing toward I'm pressing toward
[57:11] the high mark of the high calling in
[57:12] Christ that's why so many people gonna
[57:15] get left behind because they're they
[57:18] don't have the ambition they don't have
[57:20] the drive to go all the way with Christ
[57:22] they want to stay somewhere and stop
[57:24] somewhere and pick some flowers and do
[57:25] all this other kind of stuff and here it
[57:27] is the tidal wave is moving in
[57:30] yellow now we know most of us can't even
[57:34] a name a rebuke of flu and keep moving
[57:39] Yeah right it's true but now we got the
[57:42] corona virus
[57:43] it's in the state's now it's in Italy
[57:46] now and it's killing people
[57:49] if you do not have the blood of Jesus
[57:53] Christ it's the Holy Spirit it's not in
[57:56] you only when I see the blood that's
[57:59] when the plagues of Egypt was stayed the
[58:02] blood of Jesus was the thing that caught
[58:04] it and kept it from striking the true
[58:06] believers yes it was then because what
[58:10] we're at 1/3 exodus people you can
[58:13] expect these horrible things that happen
[58:16] but what are we doing the Bible said
[58:19] rejoice o heaven because the bride has
[58:22] made herself ready the bride has made
[58:25] herself ready and Parabellum said it is
[58:28] because she had to do something she knew
[58:30] it
[58:35] we must understand it's more than just a
[58:39] picture on the wall
[58:42] you must come to a revelation of who you
[58:44] are which faxing is part of the part
[58:48] that with God Christ come he's gonna
[58:50] condemn or the part that he's gonna
[58:52] bless and take up with him you decide
[58:55] that
[58:55] and I don't care about other people when
[58:57] I say that I mean people don't do what
[58:59] they gonna do it's all in your family
[59:02] they gonna do what they're gonna do but
[59:04] you must be determined to do what you
[59:06] must do
[59:08] because Jesus is brothers didn't believe
[59:11] and he was the Christ it never stopped
[59:13] him
[59:15] he moved on and because people who were
[59:18] there in a place where he was
[59:21] so we know this man it came from
[59:23] Nazareth it's not this Joseph is Mary
[59:26] son
[59:28] he could care less about what they
[59:30] thought of him he knew who he was he
[59:33] knew he was the truth and you must know
[59:37] you are the truth
[59:40] we are the truth I don't care what
[59:43] denomination what organization there is
[59:45] you and I because we have received the
[59:48] truth we have become the truth he said I
[59:51] sanctify myself that they them speed
[59:54] might be sanctified through what not
[59:56] true
[59:57] whoa clears and set aside I don't want
[1:00:03] to be a denomination I don't want to be
[1:00:04] an organization I want to have divine
[1:00:07] love as my captain
[1:00:10] I'm in the Empire of Christ Jesus
[1:00:15] when he's the head of it hmm Paul said
[1:00:20] Amen in Titus 1 1 through 3 he says Paul
[1:00:23] a servant of God an apostle of Jesus
[1:00:26] Christ according to the faith of God's
[1:00:29] healing he understands me there's a
[1:00:31] faith of God's got God's elect and the
[1:00:35] acknowledging of the truth which is
[1:00:37] after God didn't godliness truth is at
[1:00:42] the godliness you gotta be like God's
[1:00:49] not servants and slaves to sin
[1:00:52] but masters
[1:00:54] in hope of eternal life which God that
[1:00:58] cannot lie
[1:01:00] promised before the world began but had
[1:01:04] in due time manifested his word through
[1:01:07] preaching
[1:01:08] which is committed unto me according to
[1:01:11] the commandment of God in our Savior not
[1:01:14] just as Paul made that statement we
[1:01:16] Imbrium could have made the same
[1:01:18] because that same ministry was committed
[1:01:21] unto Him and he brought true
[1:01:24] in spite of all of the lies blood in the
[1:01:27] head right piercing or whatever they
[1:01:31] were two hitmen declaring it was Jesus
[1:01:34] it was the Holy Ghost and he said that's
[1:01:36] nonsense
[1:01:38] God is known through his word and no
[1:01:42] matter how many times people pretend to
[1:01:44] be something the word will clear it up
[1:01:47] every time every time every time the
[1:01:50] sanctified means to make holy set apart
[1:01:53] as sacred consecrate to purify or free
[1:01:58] from sin to cleanse the heart and this
[1:02:02] is what God said I sanctified myself I
[1:02:04] cleaned myself I could have done a lot
[1:02:06] of things I could have been married I
[1:02:07] could have done this but I did it I did
[1:02:09] it not so that you can see how
[1:02:11] sanctified I was in otherwise I had
[1:02:13] nothing connecting me to the world
[1:02:16] nothing connecting me to the world and
[1:02:20] that's how we must become have nothing
[1:02:23] connecting us to the world but
[1:02:25] everything connecting us to Christ
[1:02:29] is that Alright yeah
[1:02:34] even in the time when Jesus was trying
[1:02:37] to tell truth Pilate his father said
[1:02:39] well what is truth
[1:02:43] Jesus says he said are you a king and I
[1:02:47] love Jesus Christ response he said now
[1:02:50] say it you said I was and I want you to
[1:02:53] know for this purpose I came into the
[1:02:55] world now think about it even Jesus knew
[1:02:58] he came into this world as a king
[1:03:02] and what you and I must come and
[1:03:05] understand with the Holy Ghost in us
[1:03:07] revealing to us we came into this world
[1:03:10] as a king oh
[1:03:12] yes kings and priests the Bible says he
[1:03:17] made us that
[1:03:19] we don't have to grovel at the devil's
[1:03:21] foot feet we must understand God has
[1:03:25] made us a head and not the tail
[1:03:29] that's what he said
[1:03:31] this is now is one of those most
[1:03:33] powerful times for the believer and
[1:03:35] sinner
[1:03:37] he was as ever witness because the Dune
[1:03:40] time is close at hand and it's the most
[1:03:44] blessed time for the believer for his
[1:03:47] redemption is at hand and there's two
[1:03:49] faction as I read earlier in the earth
[1:03:51] today the believer and the unbeliever
[1:03:53] the one is coming to receive the Lord is
[1:03:56] coming to receive and the other one the
[1:03:59] Lord is coming to condemn think about it
[1:04:02] where are you
[1:04:04] let's find some water and put our face
[1:04:10] into it and let's see what the
[1:04:13] reflection is
[1:04:14] we must learn by God's grace that this
[1:04:17] Bible is your reflection
[1:04:19] read it study it because it will show
[1:04:23] you who you are
[1:04:25] and even if you're not what you believe
[1:04:28] in your heart that you are should be it
[1:04:30] brings space and room for repentance
[1:04:34] something that'll give you hope it is
[1:04:37] the only thing that I know that you can
[1:04:39] ingest and it really changes you from
[1:04:43] Earth to glory
[1:04:45] an eternal change oh
[1:04:52] my you think about it in that message
[1:04:55] the coming of the Lord second coming the
[1:04:58] Lord brother Branham talks about
[1:04:59] earthquakes in diverse places and you
[1:05:03] know he talking about America taking
[1:05:05] sides with the Arabs and telling us amen
[1:05:08] that how that even nature knows how to
[1:05:10] get away from the walls they can see the
[1:05:12] signs of the time and showing how God a
[1:05:15] man is trying to get everybody and he
[1:05:17] told us even in that message how that we
[1:05:20] were we were so arrogant and as a
[1:05:23] country and we thought nothing could
[1:05:25] happen to us we were we were all puffed
[1:05:28] up and that was the time Pearl Harbor
[1:05:29] strucker's we thought we were invincible
[1:05:32] we thought nobody would come our way
[1:05:34] just like we're thinking now
[1:05:36] it is a sign of the time it's showing us
[1:05:41] amen this is the hour this is the time
[1:05:43] when something gonna happen you said
[1:05:45] what do you mean why are we playing with
[1:05:46] Russia because God has ordained Russia
[1:05:50] to bomb us
[1:05:51] but we think we're graded in Russia
[1:05:54] thank God for a prophet who has told us
[1:05:56] we're not there far above us far ahead
[1:05:59] of us and one day they sending a message
[1:06:03] and that message is coming
[1:06:07] huh and at the same time we realize this
[1:06:11] is the time than the prize suppose to
[1:06:12] make yourself ready you don't make
[1:06:14] yourself ready at a time of war you make
[1:06:17] yourself ready at a time of peace
[1:06:20] help us Lord help us Lord because you
[1:06:24] see that the people are not preparing
[1:06:26] themselves if they were they would be
[1:06:28] here because the scripture says when you
[1:06:31] see that day approaching come together
[1:06:32] the more
[1:06:34] they don't have a revelation of that
[1:06:36] forget the bride
[1:06:38] the bride has a revelation
[1:06:40] and she knows where two or three are
[1:06:43] gathered
[1:06:44] I'll be in your midst so God even knew
[1:06:47] how many would gather sometimes and
[1:06:50] sometimes in this little fellowship we
[1:06:52] have two or three but it's nothing to
[1:06:55] get discouraged about it is the sign of
[1:06:57] the time people don't want truth they
[1:07:00] claim they do but so many people even in
[1:07:04] this facility amen becomes artificial
[1:07:07] Christians
[1:07:09] what are you
[1:07:13] merica was overconfident at a time and
[1:07:16] she least expected you know that look at
[1:07:20] Israel and and you say oh brother it
[1:07:23] bent over nation but still that country
[1:07:25] is still in the news everybody still
[1:07:27] want that little piece of land Wow it's
[1:07:30] a sign of the time God is raving those
[1:07:33] people up my fact that put us the same
[1:07:36] when it comes to knowing the word and
[1:07:39] here we say we got the Holy Ghost those
[1:07:41] people just got long and they studied
[1:07:44] that word they believed that word that's
[1:07:46] one thing I love about Israel there's
[1:07:47] strengthened faith they stand with what
[1:07:50] they believe may not be a majority but
[1:07:53] the little minority that they have has
[1:07:55] made history as far as I'm concerned
[1:07:59] you understand me the thing about it is
[1:08:02] there's no way to stop it
[1:08:04] you can't even stop what's happening
[1:08:07] it's moving it is moving fast
[1:08:10] it's moving at a rate right now it's
[1:08:13] gonna catch so many people undone
[1:08:17] because they were not willing to face
[1:08:20] truth and we know this Satan is a liar
[1:08:24] and he is the adversary that we're
[1:08:28] fighting you've got to stay in this
[1:08:31] Bible because if you're not in the word
[1:08:33] Satan will deceive you with the lie and
[1:08:37] make you believe it's truth yesterday
[1:08:40] we're living in
[1:08:42] hallelujah we know that perfect love is
[1:08:45] the only thing that's gonna get us in
[1:08:47] there
[1:08:50] anything about your revelation Paul said
[1:08:53] you can understand all mysteries and
[1:08:54] have not divided a calque charity he
[1:08:59] said it profits you nothing you don't
[1:09:01] even have a real covenant with God and
[1:09:03] we need help don't we
[1:09:06] we need that because without that if the
[1:09:10] gates won't open for you
[1:09:13] relevance said this is a modern Babylon
[1:09:16] the God who was just to pour out his
[1:09:19] judgment here has got to be the same
[1:09:21] judge just God today to pour out here
[1:09:26] his here and and as the Gentile age was
[1:09:30] issued in under righteousness and
[1:09:32] drinking and women and carousing Gentile
[1:09:35] dispensation is going to going out in
[1:09:37] the same manner why we are going out
[1:09:40] through chaos drinking and drunkenness
[1:09:43] and folks if we can't see that
[1:09:46] our world is so messed up
[1:09:51] call it right wrong and wrong right our
[1:09:54] little teenage children out there in the
[1:09:56] schools they started them off with spoke
[1:09:59] smoking cigarettes and there go from
[1:10:01] there to marijuana and many of the
[1:10:03] schools are permitting the children to
[1:10:05] smoking class I know because that's the
[1:10:06] way it was when I was at school now
[1:10:09] they're legalizing it like it's okay it
[1:10:11] ain't okay oh we're just using it for
[1:10:15] medicinal purposes
[1:10:18] it's a trick of the devil because that
[1:10:21] that little marijuana is gonna lead to
[1:10:24] something else bigger than that
[1:10:27] what all this other kind of medicine
[1:10:29] they have why don't they use something
[1:10:30] else it's the devil's trick because some
[1:10:33] greedy man want to make some big bucks
[1:10:38] and you think America can't care about
[1:10:41] you like a prophet of God said if he if
[1:10:43] they cared they would have never
[1:10:45] legalized smoking cigarettes or drinking
[1:10:49] you know what there's a time did you not
[1:10:51] know that sugar was one time against the
[1:10:54] law
[1:10:58] yeah sugar was poisoned
[1:11:02] still is and all of us are hooked most
[1:11:06] of us why they push you in your meat
[1:11:09] they shoot sugar in your bread they put
[1:11:11] sugar every nation is salt salt salt oh
[1:11:17] yeah I
[1:11:21] hope this is okay with you tonight why
[1:11:24] because my heart my heart I'm preaching
[1:11:27] not the sword goes both ways folks from
[1:11:30] the pulpit to the back of the door God
[1:11:33] speaking to me just like he's speaking
[1:11:34] to you
[1:11:36] but my thing is I don't want to be
[1:11:38] deceived I don't want to be left behind
[1:11:41] I don't want to say I followed this
[1:11:43] message and I can't cross over
[1:11:46] meat II couldn't cross over they had
[1:11:50] grieved God so much with their mom and
[1:11:52] Brady and this and that God says you
[1:11:55] won't enter into my rest first of all
[1:11:57] you don't even appreciate my leadership
[1:11:59] if I've said in all things give thanks
[1:12:03] mmm that's a revelation and all things
[1:12:07] give things
[1:12:09] is that right so let me let me let me
[1:12:13] move on to something else here just in
[1:12:15] the same because we got to understand
[1:12:17] like I was telling the other night how
[1:12:20] stubbornness it's such a factor among
[1:12:23] the people they they don't know that
[1:12:25] that that must die you know it's got to
[1:12:28] die you know and I used illustration how
[1:12:31] the Lord waking up in 3 o'clock in the
[1:12:33] morning to pray because you said I want
[1:12:36] to I want to pray more and then when he
[1:12:38] wake you up he said Lord can I stay a
[1:12:41] couple of more hours
[1:12:43] we are I've been guilty
[1:12:46] I've been guilty but what kept me in bed
[1:12:50] what kept me not hearing his call see
[1:12:54] and the thing that really got me I said
[1:12:57] it could have been just like the
[1:13:00] Chamberlain's when they went to the
[1:13:02] Queen Vashti and said the King calls
[1:13:05] and she refused to come you see how
[1:13:09] simple that is
[1:13:11] she refused to come and because she
[1:13:13] refused to come she was rejected a mate
[1:13:16] just by one of Billy Paul Testament
[1:13:19] testimonies he said brother Branham told
[1:13:22] him then when God Oh God wakes you up
[1:13:24] and you to pray he don't go back to
[1:13:26] sleep
[1:13:30] I've been times I've prayed it I'm done
[1:13:34] and I go back to sleep not a good habit
[1:13:37] rapture can catch you right in that
[1:13:39] moment
[1:13:43] it might speaking truth
[1:13:48] listen he goes on to say that his
[1:13:51] husband second coming he said that is
[1:13:54] the husband and wife which is a type of
[1:13:55] Christ in his church and when you go to
[1:13:58] church you may have the best views in
[1:14:00] the city you may have the highest deeper
[1:14:02] there in the city you may have the best
[1:14:04] pipe organs you may dress the best you
[1:14:07] may seem like a Mockingbird but all of
[1:14:10] that if you are kissing and flirting
[1:14:12] with the world the kiss on the cheek of
[1:14:15] Christ is a Judas terian kiss he doesn't
[1:14:19] want nothing to do with you he looks
[1:14:21] upon you your wedding engagement ring
[1:14:24] and he finds the tablets moved he finds
[1:14:27] love has gone it's a form we find lawyer
[1:14:30] T is gone you committed fornication with
[1:14:33] the world you go to dances and
[1:14:35] boogie-woogie and parties and watch old
[1:14:37] dirty television programs you are
[1:14:39] committing adultery with Christ on him
[1:14:42] as called as calling him your husband
[1:14:44] the Bible said say I'm rich I have need
[1:14:47] of nothing but he said you don't know
[1:14:49] that you're naked miserable blind poor
[1:14:52] and don't know it it's time we lit a
[1:14:54] candle and swept the house
[1:14:58] these little things that Satan put in
[1:15:00] our way and we think ain't nothing to it
[1:15:02] and the whole time you're committing
[1:15:04] adultery
[1:15:06] Amen on your husband Jesus Christ
[1:15:11] that's the truth
[1:15:16] when under the blood well hidden Egypt
[1:15:19] you know there was no danger the first
[1:15:22] thing you know these big black wings
[1:15:24] swept down toward the house he's seen
[1:15:26] the blood and just passed on over how
[1:15:30] marvelous see that's what I'm saying you
[1:15:33] got to make sure that the blood has been
[1:15:34] apply is that right you said what
[1:15:38] brother books I'm not a vasty well let's
[1:15:41] look at let's forget those kinds of a
[1:15:43] spirit I won't call Cain of Asti but she
[1:15:47] did represent a church you know Abel
[1:15:49] represented the church that was obedient
[1:15:51] and came represented the church that was
[1:15:53] disobedient and God told Cain exactly
[1:15:56] what to do in order to be accepted like
[1:15:59] God is telling us exactly what to do in
[1:16:02] order to be accepted Cain Abel had to
[1:16:05] bring a lamb and write a bloody lamb and
[1:16:08] you got to bring birth too but just like
[1:16:10] the Prophet God said is not literal
[1:16:12] blood anymore it is a life of Christ
[1:16:15] it's the characteristics of Christ that
[1:16:18] must be on this page because God is
[1:16:20] dealing with maturity now this is
[1:16:23] harvest I'm not planting reaping
[1:16:29] now remember this
[1:16:32] Christ for this church is a continuation
[1:16:35] of
[1:16:36] the book of Acts
[1:16:39] but the book of Revelation shows how
[1:16:41] that the Antichrist spirit would come
[1:16:44] into the church and defile it I want you
[1:16:46] y'all know what the file is
[1:16:48] define it how do you know it how do you
[1:16:51] know when it becomes if our making it
[1:16:53] lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:16:59] yeah
[1:17:01] and when we see that among ourselves we
[1:17:04] try to
[1:17:06] look in the mirror and say it is not
[1:17:08] there and the mirror says oh yeah that's
[1:17:11] you the water says face to face that's
[1:17:14] your face
[1:17:16] you understand me but nobody cares
[1:17:20] we allow ourselves to go right on
[1:17:23] but that's not what God is saying
[1:17:26] we're in the age of repentance when I
[1:17:30] ate that God is always calling for
[1:17:32] repentance people you want to be perfect
[1:17:34] at least be perfectly in a place where
[1:17:37] you repent because as long as you repent
[1:17:40] God can work with you
[1:17:44] lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes
[1:17:48] Satan revealing his works
[1:17:51] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:17:53] and the discredit their discrediting of
[1:17:56] God's Word right down to the time he is
[1:17:59] cast into the lake of fire he fights
[1:18:02] that he cannot stand it he knows that if
[1:18:05] the people get a true this what he said
[1:18:07] a true revelation of the true church and
[1:18:11] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:18:14] that she can do the greater works she
[1:18:17] will be an invincible army we have heard
[1:18:20] that over and over and over again but
[1:18:23] where is the true revelation is it in
[1:18:26] your head or in your heart
[1:18:27] because it must be in your heart in
[1:18:30] order for it to be effective
[1:18:33] has to be that's once you know you do
[1:18:36] something in your heart nobody can take
[1:18:38] it from you fight for your die forward
[1:18:42] right you live for it it can't be
[1:18:46] something that that's what I was saying
[1:18:48] sharing well up there I said you know
[1:18:50] what we have I saw we have you know the
[1:18:53] devil no he couldn't organize this and
[1:18:55] maker organizations but so he put our
[1:18:58] spirit he put a lesser spirit and we
[1:19:02] have grown up into this message spirit
[1:19:05] without the true revelation of who the
[1:19:07] message is
[1:19:08] we don't even know some of us have never
[1:19:11] met Jesus hey shad it's everywhere I'm
[1:19:15] not saying just it's everywhere he's not
[1:19:18] a shout he's not a dance he's not
[1:19:20] running up and down and out here you
[1:19:22] know all of that but all of that can be
[1:19:26] yours if he's in there it's a change of
[1:19:29] life a change of attitude is to know
[1:19:32] that you know that you know that God is
[1:19:35] on the inside a true revelation he said
[1:19:39] you would he said you will know in that
[1:19:42] day that I am in you not hope so not a
[1:19:46] pretense oh god I don't know how I'm
[1:19:48] gonna make it
[1:19:50] maybe that was said when you was first
[1:19:52] at the cross but after you got off from
[1:19:55] there you should know how you're gonna
[1:19:56] make it
[1:19:57] not by power not by might but by my
[1:20:00] spirit say at the Lord yet we grow up
[1:20:03] under that system that's why so many
[1:20:04] people falling away young people they
[1:20:06] falling away because they grew up acting
[1:20:10] acting in a way that the message is
[1:20:13] supposed to make you act
[1:20:15] no they just are so sweet and coming and
[1:20:18] look so pious all they look so heavenly
[1:20:21] but where's the life because we dislike
[1:20:25] just like Israel did we have done the
[1:20:28] same thing we fail to circumcise
[1:20:32] also the kids don't even know what
[1:20:34] circumcision is because most of the
[1:20:36] adults have failed to see
[1:20:39] what it was for them you said they
[1:20:42] couldn't have done their yeah Moses my
[1:20:44] god he got too busy and that's what
[1:20:46] happened to the message we got so busy
[1:20:48] being so deep around this place it
[1:20:51] mentor we failed to bring the kids to
[1:20:53] the principal if you're not circumcised
[1:20:56] only eighth day you were cast away
[1:21:00] and we preached the eighth day message
[1:21:03] and yet the kids are not even
[1:21:04] circumcised hmm may God help us
[1:21:09] it took a hot-tempered woman my name is
[1:21:13] Sephora Amen just circumcised and that's
[1:21:15] what brother Brennan said we need some
[1:21:17] charges like Zipporah we need some
[1:21:20] churches like that and then that's gonna
[1:21:22] circumcise the kids and God wasn't
[1:21:24] bluffing he was going to kill Moses
[1:21:28] that's why she rushed to do what she did
[1:21:34] God wasn't playing no games
[1:21:37] Danny ain't playing games now
[1:21:41] maybe I'm out of my mind but I can't
[1:21:43] help it I see something coming our way
[1:21:45] that is scaring me it just got to be
[1:21:48] shaken you know it's like like brother I
[1:21:50] said that that sheep he doesn't have a
[1:21:52] defense system but he knows when evil is
[1:21:54] approaching
[1:21:59] huh did you all know Amen that even
[1:22:03] insanity is a sign of the times listen
[1:22:07] look at your message for those who'd be
[1:22:09] insane yourself they fill it up even in
[1:22:12] my wife's
[1:22:14] in my family
[1:22:17] people are losing their minds why
[1:22:19] because they're not connected
[1:22:22] they knew how to act
[1:22:26] but how're we gonna know when it's real
[1:22:29] because they bad you gotta give him the
[1:22:32] word test how you gonna say you believe
[1:22:34] this message and you won't even study
[1:22:36] you don't see them studying you don't
[1:22:38] see them praying how can you say you're
[1:22:40] living there's nothing to feed on you
[1:22:45] how can you say something is living in
[1:22:47] you you and you know it ain't it ain't
[1:22:49] calling for food even a worm will call
[1:22:52] for food
[1:22:57] how can it be something's not right I
[1:23:00] think the devil has got a lot of people
[1:23:02] deceived and all I'm trying to say is
[1:23:03] listen let's face the truth
[1:23:06] we need to search ourselves and look in
[1:23:09] this as oh god where am i show me in the
[1:23:11] word where I am and Lord I know I'm not
[1:23:14] where it's supposed to be so I'm
[1:23:15] repenting for from everything I know is
[1:23:17] wrong and I want to be this dot another
[1:23:20] that's when God can work with you
[1:23:24] they know you said food a lot of
[1:23:26] preachers gonna be in hell because
[1:23:27] they're not facing truth
[1:23:30] it got this word has no respected person
[1:23:33] he said be ye holy for your father which
[1:23:36] is in heaven is holding holiness without
[1:23:38] no man should see the law the Holy Ghost
[1:23:41] is not something that just gonna make
[1:23:43] you feel good it's gonna change you it
[1:23:46] must change our other than other and if
[1:23:48] it ain't changing us we've got an
[1:23:50] impostor somewhere we need the real Holy
[1:23:53] Ghost the one that Peter James and John
[1:23:56] and all of them had we need that kind
[1:23:58] the kind that William Branham had we
[1:24:00] need that kind and we can't say all the
[1:24:02] bride gets a double portion and you
[1:24:04] can't even see one one portion of it
[1:24:08] one we got to have a double portion
[1:24:10] where is it then where is this Holy
[1:24:13] Ghost they're supposed to give us a
[1:24:15] double portion where we supposed to be
[1:24:17] doing twice as much as a
[1:24:19] people there's no more one-man ministry
[1:24:23] but as a body of Christ we supposed to
[1:24:25] be doing exploits
[1:24:27] am I wrong no I
[1:24:36] just want to be right God knows I do
[1:24:42] he said if they get a true revelation of
[1:24:45] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:24:48] the Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[1:24:50] desert with it withstand the Antichrist
[1:24:53] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:24:55] her he will be as definitely taught
[1:24:58] today as he went Christ with stood his
[1:25:02] every effort to gain power over him in
[1:25:05] the desert yes Satan hates revelation
[1:25:09] but we love it with the true revelation
[1:25:12] in our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[1:25:15] prevail against us but we will prevail
[1:25:17] over them you will recall that I
[1:25:20] mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:25:22] message that the Bliss book we are
[1:25:24] studying in the action is the actual
[1:25:27] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[1:25:30] church and in his works and in the
[1:25:32] future ages then I mentioned that it
[1:25:34] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:25:36] revelation or we will fail to get it
[1:25:41] y'all hear me not me and Men can give it
[1:25:45] to you they can you can preach the house
[1:25:47] top off but if God don't drop the
[1:25:50] revelation into your heart or what it is
[1:25:55] how can you say how can we say we got
[1:25:58] the whole ego and we fall to this
[1:26:00] powerless thing powerless and I'm not
[1:26:04] speaking to everybody because I know God
[1:26:05] is working in some of us but I'm talking
[1:26:08] to those who hadn't even seen a miracle
[1:26:09] I think has a testimony and it was
[1:26:13] brother Liz Paul that told me the other
[1:26:15] day which is struck he was just going
[1:26:17] through the scripture I hope you don't
[1:26:18] mind me saying this about that wedding
[1:26:20] you know garment and the man was coming
[1:26:23] I haven't forgotten it it just went here
[1:26:25] and he was caught in that wedding in the
[1:26:30] church without a wedding garment and
[1:26:32] Jesus oh how did you get in here how did
[1:26:35] you get in here and that's when I came
[1:26:37] to this message and I'm thinking that's
[1:26:40] right
[1:26:40] acting like they had it carrying on like
[1:26:45] they had it y'all understand me how did
[1:26:48] you get in here how did you how because
[1:26:50] when coming through the door you come
[1:26:52] and Jesus robes you with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:56] coming in the door but you mean to tell
[1:26:59] me you among the message and you don't
[1:27:01] either is that right and in that
[1:27:04] scripture he said the man was speechless
[1:27:08] thank you brother since you ain't
[1:27:11] preaching I might as well preach it
[1:27:19] you know what I'm doing
[1:27:22] he was speechless
[1:27:24] he didn't even have a testimony
[1:27:28] he didn't say oh oh Lord I came in by
[1:27:31] the blood Oh Lord you know nothing and
[1:27:36] and and what we gonna say in that day
[1:27:40] how'd you get in here you can't even
[1:27:42] tell me how you got saved
[1:27:45] you can't tell me Oh Lord I nailed it
[1:27:48] the crowd and I cried out to you and
[1:27:50] Lord you saved me I knew you see but he
[1:27:53] had nothing to give witness to his
[1:27:55] experience
[1:27:58] and God cast him out into outer darkness
[1:28:01] which is the tribulation period
[1:28:05] so you know it's got to be the message
[1:28:07] he's talking about because everybody
[1:28:09] else ain't called to the message
[1:28:11] it's the message of the hour that puts
[1:28:14] on the wedding garment
[1:28:16] so you it has to be people among our
[1:28:19] rink ranks that were actually
[1:28:22] denominations they're already done
[1:28:25] judgment has already struck in they they
[1:28:28] did Gabbar right but the message the
[1:28:32] people around this place than everywhere
[1:28:34] else that claimed they're in it and they
[1:28:37] came love they came forgive they can't
[1:28:39] pray they can't study they can't unite
[1:28:42] the Spirit of God is a uniting spirit
[1:28:46] is that right but what unites us the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost and if we're not being with
[1:28:52] United it means that the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:55] not there a
[1:28:56] true Holy Ghost will unite you to your
[1:28:59] brethren
[1:29:02] it won't care about nothing the house
[1:29:05] only thing it is yet by one spirit are
[1:29:07] we baptized into one body
[1:29:11] we looking at everybody and seeing what
[1:29:13] they have and what they don't have I
[1:29:23] will read this and i'ma stop
[1:29:26] brother brother said the whole the
[1:29:28] church is a whole lot like it was in the
[1:29:31] days of Esther Esther didn't like the
[1:29:33] like the Esther didn't take the
[1:29:35] perfuming of women she adorned herself
[1:29:38] with the modest apparel the hidden man
[1:29:41] of the heart and the King said put the
[1:29:44] crown on her head
[1:29:46] Esther was a type of the church today
[1:29:49] those who are ready to come out and
[1:29:52] adorn themselves with the sweetness of
[1:29:54] the Holy Spirit not the perfuming and an
[1:29:57] end dressing up of the world trying to
[1:29:59] compare them but that hidden man of the
[1:30:03] heart that's the wine see this guy here
[1:30:06] you know that hidden thing you know you
[1:30:08] got you got you know when people got
[1:30:09] hatred and all kind of stuff in their
[1:30:11] heart and I don't like this one and I've
[1:30:13] got all this building this in my heart
[1:30:14] I'm not saying you were brought you a
[1:30:16] bride but she one thing I know about the
[1:30:18] bride when she fell she gets up
[1:30:21] when she do wrong she makes right
[1:30:24] and I'm not talking about several months
[1:30:26] later
[1:30:28] I'm talking about immediately because
[1:30:31] the Holy Ghost ain't gonna let you rest
[1:30:33] until you make it right
[1:30:38] hmm
[1:30:40] Esther was to be chosen to stand before
[1:30:44] the king she didn't adorn herself
[1:30:47] them doing themselves with all of the
[1:30:50] things but she adorned herself with a
[1:30:52] sweet meek spirit
[1:30:54] that's the bride
[1:30:56] that's what the bride is adorned herself
[1:30:59] with with all of the fruits of the
[1:31:02] spirit following it and people y'all
[1:31:05] gotta say a lot so you think you got a
[1:31:08] right you do you got a right to do wrong
[1:31:10] and you got a right to do right and it's
[1:31:13] up to you I
[1:31:15] believe with all my heart the Lord is
[1:31:18] soon to come much closer than what we
[1:31:21] think and III just know that to be true
[1:31:24] everything is looking in that direction
[1:31:27] brethren I'm talking about the germ
[1:31:29] warfare and you know that this Corolla
[1:31:31] virus was actually formed and shaped in
[1:31:33] in a laboratory it's already been
[1:31:36] exposed that's where it started that's
[1:31:39] just the baby of it
[1:31:41] huh y'all say o or whether you say why
[1:31:44] do you say baby Elvis Presley that
[1:31:47] rock'n'roll you can laugh at it
[1:31:50] that was the baby form a rock and roll
[1:31:54] look at what we got now
[1:31:56] look at what we got now is no longer
[1:31:59] innocent it's vulgar
[1:32:01] wicked
[1:32:03] aggressive it ravishes you
[1:32:07] hello oh I was in I was over there in
[1:32:10] Guyana and I'm telling you the music and
[1:32:13] everything was so loud to my shirt was
[1:32:14] actually moving just like that vibrating
[1:32:17] it was like I had I was imprisoned by
[1:32:19] this noise and I everybody in the street
[1:32:23] is moving by the beat and all of them
[1:32:25] didn't even realize that all the
[1:32:26] movements they were making whoa made
[1:32:28] making movements like surfers
[1:32:30] and I'm telling y'all now by the grace
[1:32:33] of God and I believe with all my heart
[1:32:35] out I'll move on come Sunday to
[1:32:38] something different perhaps if the Lord
[1:32:40] allow me to but my heart is
[1:32:43] crying because brother man said a true
[1:32:45] minister of God
[1:32:46] would be telling the people and trying
[1:32:50] to show them the signs of the time so
[1:32:53] that they could make themselves ready
[1:32:54] that's what it's all about anything
[1:32:56] about all us we you know that's how the
[1:32:58] lot log captive the enemy captured us
[1:33:01] and and inhaled us almost in a you know
[1:33:03] in a space and time and all we was
[1:33:06] talking about is what brother branham
[1:33:08] lost and we were failing to see that
[1:33:10] when brother said the move is on the
[1:33:11] bride
[1:33:13] anything nothing wrong with nor what he
[1:33:15] did but what have you done what are we
[1:33:18] doing
[1:33:20] this is the script the scene has changed
[1:33:23] he's turned to carla and we still want
[1:33:26] to look this way when we need to be
[1:33:28] looking forward the Bible said onward
[1:33:30] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[1:33:33] with the cross of Jesus going on before
[1:33:36] we're marching forward
[1:33:39] with the same power same sign same ones
[1:33:42] these are the things that are supposed
[1:33:44] to accompany double Eva
[1:33:47] that's the head
[1:33:53] facing the truth
[1:33:58] you know I
[1:34:02] I
[1:34:05] talk to the Lord every day all day
[1:34:09] whether I'm on my knees or standing up
[1:34:12] whether I'm riding in the car doesn't
[1:34:13] matter I'm always talking he's hearing
[1:34:17] my heart
[1:34:18] words I can't express with my lips he
[1:34:22] hears it in my heart
[1:34:24] and all I know is that I keep saying
[1:34:26] Lord I
[1:34:28] feel your pool don't let me pull back
[1:34:32] don't let me pull it away from you but
[1:34:34] let me submit a yield to the pool that
[1:34:37] I'm feeling if I got to be the only one
[1:34:39] yeah just let me move with your pool
[1:34:43] because I know somebody in this age is
[1:34:46] gonna make it and I'm counting myself
[1:34:48] that's one you gotta count yourself as
[1:34:50] one you can't worry about what everybody
[1:34:52] else is doing people everybody else is
[1:34:55] here to distract you we got three kinds
[1:34:58] of believers believe it make believe
[1:35:01] you're unbelievable you don't know who's
[1:35:02] who
[1:35:03] and they don't you know if you look and
[1:35:06] you see that's a pattern Jesus that they
[1:35:09] say well where did you get all those
[1:35:11] scars he said it's the house of my
[1:35:13] friends it is where you get your scars
[1:35:16] in your house in your family
[1:35:20] that's what the scripture says in that
[1:35:22] day husband begets wives and children
[1:35:24] against mothers and you know how it goes
[1:35:26] that's no joke
[1:35:28] that's what they were living in but
[1:35:31] guess what in all of that you still got
[1:35:35] to love it
[1:35:36] you must recognize that we're not
[1:35:39] wrestling against flesh and blood but
[1:35:40] spiritual wickedness in high places it
[1:35:44] spiritual wickedness we're dealing with
[1:35:47] but I said like this how you gonna
[1:35:49] protect your family if the blood as an
[1:35:51] Indian been applied to your life
[1:35:53] you can't apply the token if you don't
[1:35:55] have it
[1:35:56] let us not deceive ourselves and I'm not
[1:35:59] just speaking to someone in particular
[1:36:01] here I don't know who I'm talking to all
[1:36:04] I know is is that Satan like a lion he's
[1:36:08] roaring now seeking whom he may devour
[1:36:11] this ain't no time to play it's really a
[1:36:14] time of seriousness
[1:36:16] when I was in New York I I preached a
[1:36:20] message
[1:36:22] the spirit of vasti
[1:36:25] because in the message brother branham
[1:36:27] don't preach on vasty by name but you
[1:36:30] know she's in there but I thought about
[1:36:32] the Rock and Roll Holly was in a baby
[1:36:34] stage and that spirit and Basti was in a
[1:36:36] baby stage look at it now she's a
[1:36:40] seasoned she sits on
[1:36:44] ten heels she has two daughters she
[1:36:48] stands as a woman without she says
[1:36:52] how hard the scripture goes I
[1:36:56] stand as a widow
[1:36:58] in other words I have no husband I have
[1:37:01] no aunt ship I have no ruler over me and
[1:37:05] and and it's not enough to say oh I'm a
[1:37:08] Christian doctors don't wanna be you he
[1:37:11] want to be your Lord
[1:37:13] that's the thing he wants to be your
[1:37:15] Lord he was to be your ruler he wants to
[1:37:16] be your mind let this mind be in you
[1:37:19] that was also in Christ Jesus he wants
[1:37:21] your mind
[1:37:22] he wants you to do away with all your
[1:37:25] will and we can only do that by the help
[1:37:28] of God the Holy Spirit the same one that
[1:37:32] called us to justification is the same
[1:37:34] one that calls us the same plication is
[1:37:36] the same one that leads us to the
[1:37:37] baptism the Holy Ghost is the same one
[1:37:39] that comes in it steps into our life
[1:37:42] Christ in you the hope of glory as rough
[1:37:47] as it may see
[1:37:49] people are breaking down
[1:37:52] and a
[1:37:55] [Music]
[1:37:57] lot of this insanity that we're now
[1:38:00] experiencing
[1:38:02] with people what what people to
[1:38:04] understand is that insanity comes in
[1:38:06] levels some people you can tell they did
[1:38:08] have in mind battles other people they
[1:38:10] have nine battles and and you'll never
[1:38:12] know and when I say mine battles I mean
[1:38:15] they're not really badly they've just
[1:38:17] given up that's insanity
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:21] insanity is no knowing you have a
[1:38:24] rescuer and you don't want it
[1:38:27] knowing that you can agree get help you
[1:38:29] got somebody that can help you out of
[1:38:31] the situation and you refuse it that's
[1:38:33] insanity and knowing that if you don't
[1:38:35] get that help you're going to die that's
[1:38:37] insanity and it's everywhere people know
[1:38:42] that only Jesus Christ can help them
[1:38:44] they know that he's Lord and God however
[1:38:47] they know people around this message
[1:38:50] amen and yet they still letting the
[1:38:52] world just pull on him and pull on them
[1:38:53] and pull on him and you heard me some
[1:38:56] lunch ago when I preached on on the left
[1:38:58] but I said you know what when he grabs
[1:39:00] his pray he grabs and then he drags them
[1:39:04] to where he taking them and when he
[1:39:07] kissed them to that place
[1:39:11] sometimes he would kill him and then
[1:39:13] he'll pull them up a tree for a later
[1:39:15] for later meal MA and that's what it is
[1:39:19] we that devil he slowly pulling you
[1:39:22] you don't even know it you think you're
[1:39:26] going if you're going somewhere but
[1:39:28] you're not going forward you're going
[1:39:29] back to where are these taking you and
[1:39:30] let's that's what sin will do
[1:39:34] whether we're to say destroy the demon
[1:39:36] or the demon will destroy you
[1:39:40] let us pray father God we come before

[1:39:46] mercy

[1:43:20] I want to say to the young people we
[1:43:23] sister years ago had a dream and in this
[1:43:27] dream we were all climbing this mountain
[1:43:31] and before we reached the top she said
[1:43:34] there was the young people started
[1:43:38] acting wild and crazy like they started
[1:43:41] running back backwards instead of four
[1:43:44] and she said it was that time that the
[1:43:48] rapture took place and every Church I've
[1:43:51] gone to and have been going through it's
[1:43:54] like the junk people in the message
[1:43:55] they're losing their minds they throw
[1:43:58] away everything they've been taught

[1:44:02] pull on them
[1:44:04] let me tell you something every girl out
[1:44:06] there is anointed with witchcraft how is
[1:44:10] it sister brother said that they would
[1:44:14] be so aggressive and then it would
[1:44:17] almost drive the sons of God crazy and
[1:44:19] that's what's happening it seems like
[1:44:23] people are not seeing that sighs at the
[1:44:25] time that that's what's happening right

[1:44:47] that darkness is to show the glory of
[1:44:50] the stars
