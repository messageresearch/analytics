all over me again [Music] [Music] oh i feel him all over me [Music] surely god is not dead glory to god we're just going to go right in on right on into the message i had a difficult time i don't know whether you can change the subject tonight if possible um he asked me what the subject would be i said come up here then that was just one of the things that i wanted to minister on uh but uh really the uh message would be the power of the revelation in you the power of the revelation in you if you would turn with me to romans the fourth chapter and the 17th verse good to see you sister velana amen always good to see you sir hallelujah as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and called those things would be not as though they were amen you love the lord amen let us pray our dear gracious father we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your loving kindness toward us none of us or god is worthy to even stand before us but before you but because of your grace because of your election and because of who you are and who we are to you lord we can stand because of your grace and the blood of jesus christ that redeemed us from the foundation of the world lord we thank you lord tonight for a wonderful time in you lord god it was it's been a blessing oh god to have you speak into our hearts throughout the day and lord we thank you lord we pray father god that you bless each and every heart that uh we would receive something that would draw us closer to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated in all that we think and do we know that nothing happens by chance god has a way of dealing with us and the bible tells us that his ways are past finding out so out throughout eternity it'd be very difficult for us to even come to know all of him i believe that throughout eternity we'll be learning and continually learning things that god has not shared with us in this particular place paul could only say eyes have not seen nor ears heard what the lord has in store for us and surely this is something that keeps me going when i compare the things that i have now to the things that god has promised uh the balance uh the way to be weighed in the balance is no equal we know that all that god has promised us is beyond anything we can imagine and we know that this life is not worth giving up god um that's if you could but if you are one of his you could never give him up and he could never give you up the power of revelation is it's only god can give that to you you can study the scriptures you can go to harvard yale or any of these great universities to study the bible and still come out as ignorant as you was when you first went in because the bible is not taught in the way of intellect this book can only be understood by the revelation in which god gives us it is such a powerful book yet uh it seems to be a threat to every generation that comes even from the beginning of time once the word of god was established on paper where we could read or comprehend the bible has always been a threat people don't care if you say god but even the name of jesus still make demons tremble and no matter how religious people are when you have a true revelation of who jesus christ is even those who say they know jesus don't want to hear you talk about him in the light of revelation the prophet of god tells us by the grace of god in the fourth seal he said now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation see well then now there is a power of the revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction stimulation that it vindicates it it proves it's called in the scripture as we want to refer to it as new wine we always refer to it like that these are drunk on new wine see all or or or spiritual wine i think the best interpretation would be it would be on spiritual wine as the natural wine reveals itself to stimulated power so does the new wine as it reveals the word of god which is spirit oh now there's that see the word itself is spirit you believe that yes because before it was ever written it was a voice and that voice was a spirit and people didn't have uh the word written as we have it now uh even in the jewish dispensation uh the word was written on on on on our parchment on uh skins of lambs and different things they didn't have paper like we have it now but even so the congregation was not allowed to read it or to handle it because it was so holy and think about that now just the rhema not the logos just the rhema the written word was so holy that only those who were anointed and predestinated as priests and uh uh were able to handle it and the high priest was the one who was really able to go in there and and look at the word of god in a way that even the other priests could not uh when we think about the power of the word in its natural state think about what it is in the spiritual aspect abraham didn't have a letter to read but he caught the mind of god spirit by spirit and abraham though he were in this dimension the bible said he looked for a city whose builder and maker was god in other words abraham was caught up into another dimension he was quickened abraham when he was abram was dead but when god quickened abraham god gave him a new name he stopped calling him abram because it but called him abraham and that word ham amen represents god in other words god gave abraham a part of his name and the bible said that abraham according to romans 4 17 he called he was quickened let me read it as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead you understand me god had to quicken abraham who was dead and then abraham began to call those things that be not as though they were see it's when you are quick and when that holy spirit quickened that life in you you change you lead this dimension or this dimensional way of thinking and behaving in other words you pass from death unto life though you'll be in the same body there's been a change in you that that old man has passed he's died and now he's passed away into another dimension and therefore that's the dimension he lives in that's why the bible says unto us that you know the kingdom of god it doesn't come by our observation you can't observe it you know it's not something physical it's something spiritual and we know it's not natural it's not meat or drink but it's joy peace and righteousness what in the holy ghost and so only those who are filled with the holy ghost are those who have the holy ghost amen can discern where they are they concern discern the signs the times the seasons you and i know that even in the world the way things are going we just on the break of world war three and we know that the prophet promised us one thing before one bomb drop we'll be gone so it doesn't matter you know what they are planning to do it's not our business but the bible says when you see this day approaching look up because your redemption draweth nigh see we are different people we are the aliens of this world we came from god and we go back to god we could never fit here because we have been designed we are a new creature we are special class of people we are people amen that that are born of god see and you know when it comes as i said the last time i preached i believed we were different dealing with this dimension and in this dimension we talked about time and how time becomes a prison house it becomes a trap you know and i was thinking about that today and i said you know time is something else it's just for a moment even this moment that we're speaking now is now passing behind us and now is in the past but with god it's you know and you know the only thing that traps time is memory and memory is spiritual you can't go inside looking for your memory it's not there in the natural and you and i must understand by god's grace amen when it comes to god we understand that these things like james says it's like a vapor this life is here today and gone tomorrow and if you ever seen a vapor it vanishes almost at the twinkling of an eye we're no longer bound for space and time and that's the thing that satan is trying to keep us from he's trying to keep us you know locked into this prison house and when you when you when you when you just looking at the natural and i'm coming to something here we know that we have our five senses but the prophet of god spoke on on another censor it's called sixth sense it is the faith sense it is that sense that's able to see in a different dimension it is a sense a man that is not regulated by time nor space hallelujah it cannot be imprisoned and as long as faith exists and faith is not a thing faith is god himself because the bible says by faith god created the heavens and the earth that's the will of god which is his faith no longer bound by space and time we are eternal and that's where we've got to believe we've got to believe that we are eternal paul believed it and when he was at nero's chopping block he was able to laugh in death's faith and said oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory thanks be to god that gives us the liberty the victory through our lord and savior jesus christ like i said yesterday is a moment something that is gone and how today is somebody else's yesterday and out yesterday is somebody's today it is this in another dimension and nobody can capture it there's only one person who knows how uh to do that because time is not a prison house time is not an element with god when it comes to eternity it is what it is and the only way jesus and god could explain themselves was to say i am and when the i am was here he was able to discern hearts he was able to go beyond time way beyond men and women's memories because in god's eye what you think has happened 30 years ago has been maybe a split second in our own time and the bible said he knows all things he has all power we can't we can't even comprehend it in the natural matter when we try to think about it we come into a brick wall because these things cannot be understood in a natural way it has to be understood in a spiritual way they laughed at israel for years because they could not produce a physical god you mean to tell me you your god is not we at least we have an image we've got something to show you but israel was on a different plane because they were the church of that day they could not live in that carnal state or in that valley amen all the other nations lived in they had seen the pillar of fire they seen what god could do they understood what god can do and they believed god and god even then counted as being righteousness and fulfill their requests the only time god would not move for them is when they allowed their thoughts to become like their neighbors thoughts when their spirit joined in with the fifth and the fourth dimension that's when god stopped dealing with them because in reality they had already backslidden see there are many people that come to church and they're already backslidden because their minds are not they're not sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and their desires are not coming from above their desires are coming from beneath that's what god sees he looks at your channel he looks at your connection that's how god judged you brother branham said it like this he said you know when a man received the baptism of fire now he didn't say holy ghost he set a fire that's what john said he shall come and he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and fire but people say well i got the holy ghost but where is your fire you must be baptized with fire hello somebody in this age that we're living in you must have the holy ghost and fire because that fire is the cleansing not of your natural body but it's the cleansing of your soul a place you can't clean clean he said you know when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there that's why i can't understand that for a long time i couldn't understand what john said the holy ghost and fire and understand on the day of pentecost they were baptized with the holy ghost and fire and that age is turned around again amen and we know their behavior we know that the authority they had they had so much authority that they were called christian at antioch because they did exactly what christ was doing they were completely sold out he said oh he said there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait till this earth gets her baptism and that's the thing everybody want a quiet holy ghost but where is the fire the fire must be because jesus said i would that you be hot or cold not lukewarm once we understand this revelation in us it begins to grow it begins to push out it begins to feel your being it begins to make and create god in you did you realize that you being a person as you are that you're not all together flesh your spirit and flesh not only that but jesus said that the bible said that we are in a miniature way gods but jesus said that he said if that was prophets and so forth to old testament that jesus were uh referring to said it's written in your law think about it think about a law a law is set there and when god makes a law it is a law cannot be broken without penalties and he said it it's written in your law that ye are gods now i don't know about you but if the law says i am if the law says you are believe the law amen that's the word and he caught and if he called them gods who the word of god comes to did not the word of god come to you not only to the prophet but god came to you god came to abraham god comes to abraham c amen god come then why not himself being the son of god when he makes himself equal with god now we are in an amateur way we are creators now you know that's true even in the fallen state this is why we can create automobiles and airplanes and all these kind of that's just in the natural but what about the spiritual sons of god do they know how to create and the thing is is that the book is open the word of god is unsealed that means all of the mysteries of jesus christ is laying there everything that he did we can do not in our own power but the power of the holy ghost and fire that's in us is the same jesus the same god because the bible said it was god in god the fullness of god dwelt in that body and all that was in god all that was in god he poured it into christ we've heard it all that was in christ he poured it into us but you see this could never work with the corner mind struggling with your identity it won't work you got to come to know who you are and that's by revelation you can say oh i am no no no it must be revealed to you who you are when it is revealed to you who you are you need to move with no fear heaven and earth will pass away he says now this word means passing from one form to another it does not mean annihilation see that's what we don't even understand when the bible says you have passed from death unto life we think okay some nothing really happened yes the old man died passed away and the new man is now changing from what one and one form to another but we take it as the religious part if i just confess the lord jesus christ with my mouth and believe within my heart i am a new creature you know what i'm saying that's the beginning of things but you got to come up higher you your mind must be elevated i don't know about you but i look at little david who was quick and he was a sheep boy a shepherd minding his daddy's sheep a prophet came samuel and anointed him somewhere god quickened this young boy quicken him to know who he really was because listen even at the age of 12 david was king had not yet been crowned but by man but god had crowned him and anointed him kings hallelujah so we even if you're not anointed yet if you brought your bride nothing can change that like i said the other day people say remember me lord i said god don't forget but when we say remember what are we saying god the word that you promised let it be fulfilled how can god forget he said i can never forget you i can't you engrave it in the palm of my hand hallelujah thank you jesus right now the words mean pass from one form to another it does not mean annihilated no annihilation the english word would mean pass away it's annihilated but the hebrew word or the greek word here does not mean pass away it means from passing from one thing to another i don't know about you i'm on a journey and listen the bible says i'm being changed passing away from glory to glory moving from one form to another who can believe that this vile flesh one day will be standing in the image and likeness of god hallelujah but it's god who changes like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly to look at the caterpillar you think that was impossible but you see the change wasn't from the outside the change was from the inside it was always in the caterpillar to be a butterfly hallelujah so is it with a christian and when you understand this message you'll come to realize you was not saved on any day you were always saved oh god i can't remember when i gave my heart to the lord god remembers you hallelujah is that all right it doesn't matter what you've fallen into you can be an adulterer a fornicator a drug addict if you belong to god the bloodhounds are after you and god it will find you out and think there's a thing that i love about it is he doesn't require us to do nothing but believe have a real faith in what he's already done what you gonna do amen when death comes you're going to throw out your list of do goods no sir i'm saved you're saved by the grace of god the blood washed away my sins nothing but the blood and i'm saved in him only because i'm accepted in the beloved in true reality there was only one man truly saved and that was jesus christ he was the only perfect man ever stood but oh the devil had only realized who he was he would have let him grow an old man hallelujah but god see that's how smart he is these these little peanut brain people think they smarter than god because they graduate from some kind of college are you serious the devil laughs at you when you think you're so smart because you know what he knows with all that education you're going to die and when you die everything you thought you knew perished with you huh the only thing that lasts forever is the character of jesus christ may god help us here tonight ain't nothing wrong with education don't get me wrong we need that for this dimension but we can always live beyond that huh i think about jesus he always walked in that that dimension with god always he was able to see a few fish and loaves spoken to and those loaves and fish had to obey oh my god think about it nothing was impossible he didn't scratch his head and say oh my god how i'm going to get out of this no sir the bible it tells us basically he had undisturbed faith and that's if jesus christ is in you jesus christ has undisturbed faith today you can't be double minded and call that jesus well i call that flesh but just like i said the other night when it comes to black dog and white dog or evil and good jesus said amen you either make the tree good or you make it evil in other words the black dog got to die or the white one won but you cut you can't have truth this is not the day of good and evil this is not the age for that leo the seal gave us that good and evil right the holy spirit fallen on two men one both of them prophets had one prophesied the other one interpreted one was of god and one was the devil out we're beyond that god is trying to get us to a place where it's all good hallelujah is that right understand the tree of life is jesus christ and if we're going to be the bride of the tree of life we must be the tree of life or the tree of life in us y'all understand what i'm saying i'm not saying we can do this in a natural way this is spiritual what i'm speaking paul used it he said if you want to read it now put it down you can read it later in titus 3 5 says paul is using the same word meaning regeneration of a man that man has passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's changed person he has been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated see that's what they understand the under the opening of the word the opening of the word god coming in the last day amen that message is supposed to change you that's why i keep saying to the church when we come to church we come to hear a word that's going to change us is that right it's the truth the message must change you little by little but still change you how many y'all believe you're in the rapture we're in the process of the rapture think about abraham and sarah as i said the other day abraham and sarah didn't go boo they were from old to young no sir it was a process as they move on their journey they began to turn that young it didn't happen in a day he not walked with god oh over a hundred years i believe it was he didn't change in a day he wasn't quicker than a day it was a process and so that's why we preached this message because the message is not supposed to intellectually just stimulate you it's supposed to bring a revelation in your heart to the place you come to know who you are oh my god and once you come to know who you are you become an invincible army hallelujah you might start off a little weak but as you grow you're going to get stronger and stronger and your faith is going to become more and more like god and after a while you'll find out the same jesus that stood on the face of the earth is now standing in the earth in you hallelujah god is so good same word you don't even know that you pass from life to them to death that there's been a change in you and if there's been a change in you that means you've been regen oh somebody help me i feel like shouting john right now that means amen that because you have been regen that means amen you're going to come into the image of god and he's going to make all things beautiful in your life in his time amen what does it mean the earth will be loose from the grips of satan it'll be loosed it'll be loose from politics it'll be loose from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of god to be established it here on earth but as long as it's in the hands of satan politics see satan the ruler of the earth he owns it it belongs to him but now he didn't say later he said but now christ has redeemed it meaning is now in the process of change and he's doing that even by us you let me tell you something do you think god is all excited about the new earth no the new earth he's excited about is you that's right amen he made all of this just for you just for me but you're the tabernacle of god you're the one that god has died for everything else comes secondary when you think god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son let me tell you something you know he died for human beings they were the fallen ones and once we become get back into our proper place then all of creation can get back in their proper place but the fallen sons is the reason why we have all of this but the bible said oh that the whole creation groans like come on boys you guys got to hurry up it's painful living like this oh the serpent she knows nothing but i can't even i can't obey him he's not my god that's how the earth talks that's why they bring forth thorns and thistles hey i don't care what man does he messes it up he's he can't listen he can't do better so he try to make it better and he high breathes it and it brings forth more death but you await the sons of god listen the sons of god is so powerful jesus turned water into wine come on oh y'all look at me see oh you know what we do we put jesus over here jesus turned water into wine let me ask you a question where is jesus now amen huh he turned water into wine he turned water into wine that means the same god that turned water into wine 2 000 years ago is living in you now oh when the squeeze come what we gonna do turn water into wine the bride is not going to suffer jesus suffered for us we might go through a little pressure something like colby but we overcame is that right many other afflictions of the righteous the bible said but god delivered them out of them all he didn't say you won't get afflicted he didn't say that but he said you will be delivered so we let this mind according to philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation watch the man who tries to make a reputation if jesus made no reputation all those who follow him are not trying to make a reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men see a true servant of god does not seek preeminence over the people and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto the death even the death of the cross let me tell y'all something you walk in this church corner minded you ain't getting nothing what i'm saying is getting on your nerve and after a while it's going to be out now he preaching too long you see yeah kind of mind can't understand what i'm saying spiritual yes you're getting something that's why we're supposed to come in here and pray and get out of that nasty atmosphere that we've had to live in throughout the day consecrate yourself when you come in here because if you come in here with attitudes you allow the devil to steal from you tonight and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross how many of us can do that well for god also highly exalted him this is what i love and giving him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that's one thing i love about the lord jesus christ he never let his flesh dictate to him on who he was even when flesh tried to say that he was a son and daughter of joseph he corrected them and said no ye not i'm about my father's business he understood who he was on the inside therefore he could perform on the outside that's the key when you know what you is what you are on the inside then you can perform on the outside hallelujah david understood it he said he anointeth my head with oil my cup runneth over now here was a young boy being anointed by samuel reminiscing on what happened that day he said my cup running over why because his daddy was ashamed of him but there's a father there's a god in high he he was not ashamed he said this all that you got no no there's one more go get him y'all see what i'm saying god doesn't go by the outward appearance he'd go for the inside hallelujah you can ordain a man a bishop elder whatever but if god ain't ordained him he ain't nothing david says no sir you understand what the anointing will do do you see what the it it moves you out of time you know because time not only makes you old but time makes you weak it weakens you i've been working all day hallelujah but there's no time with god in eternity there is no time you know i know brother brandon was caught up into something because he drove the speed limit and he would drive all night basically to get one place to another he had to be caught up somehow and i don't know whether you've had the experience you start singing and worshiping god it seemed to shorten your trip you know something about that i don't understand how it all works but it's true and when you get caught up in god amen somehow it gives you a strength it gives you power it really it just it it it quickens not only the soul but it makes the flesh obey how many times i've come in here tired because of time and i get under this anointing and i feel like a young man is that's the truth anybody know what i'm talking about when you're sick you don't even feel good and you get up and anointing all of a sudden you you yet the sickness leaves you i remember the time i sprang my ankle there i mean sorry i sprang my back there in in arizona and i couldn't even and i'm in a concert and i couldn't even holly and i had to walk up to the stage like this but oh my after the anointing hit me i got to dancing and shouting and everything else but when the anointing leaves in reality come back yes you remember where you came from but it's so amazing what the anointing will do i don't know why people don't want it people don't want it bad enough oh you're not gonna get me down there crying and screaming and hollering like somebody ain't got nobody no sense i'll tell you what whether you do it now you're gonna do it later get in your room somewhere talk to jesus the way you know how to because if you got to do it in front of people pride coming probably going to be right there but you need to find a place where you don't have to deal with pride right and get with god and let it listen the bible said don't even let him go until you satisfied is that right there the bible tells the preachers don't stop preaching and don't stop praying until god himself has come to zion we can't stop at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth not come on somebody then what did that make you when jesus christ has come into your heart in your life you take on his name because the bible said the whole heaven and earth is named after him that means you have the authority to make everything bow that which is under the earth that is when heaven that's under the earth on earth wherever it may be the authority is in jesus christ wherefore my beloved i'm finna go so let me hurry up because i'm going too slow wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my present only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and tremble that means something you've got to do you have to overcome your fears you have to overcome your unbeliefs hallelujah you've got to work and walk amen work and walk into this perfection that we're talking about even though you're perfect you still gotta move forward right you gotta you gotta prove that the perfection that god gave you is is there amen is that right and david proved he was king by the things he did by his love for god i mean this man was so spiritual even saul wanted him to be his his musical fella so i said come on in here you know i mean and this is man david played such a w in such a way amen they cast the devil's off assault a king now i ain't talking about the priest i'm saying a king we fight together and we would work we must work together see let me say it like this even though this is an individual fair yet and still in this day it is not because this is the age of gathering god is gathering his people uniting his bride by his word by his spirit that's the truth i remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts how many of y'all believe that for the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm formal and powerless now it's amazing how the new church the new testament church when they saw the man at the gate of beautiful they didn't say satan get behind me no they knew who they were they had identified uh identification and they perceived that means discern that the man had faith and what did they do they spoke the word that's right amen take your your bed and walk you understand me they didn't have to run to a bishop or nobody else is this right to do no they had so much god in them they understood they had his mind paul didn't say let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus paul had the mind of christ in him and we must have the mind of christ and how do you know that you have the mind of christ because it's your perfect desire to do the perfect will of god you may falter but you have the perfect desire to do the perfect will of god that's the truth see the antichrist would come into the church and defile it and make it what lukewarm sounds familiar formal sounds familiar powerless sound familiar so who is that that's causing churches among the message to be lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word that's what he does right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he can't not stand it he knows that if the people get a true what revelation of the true church amen not the baptist catholic presbyterian message the true church who is that you a revelation of you christ in you the hope of glory you and what she is what she stands for and she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army don't worry you don't do the gathering god does the gathering and he says well two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst if they get a true revelation of the two two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the anti-christ spirit satan will be powerless wait wait let me read this again because somehow when we read this quote we put it in the future and understand this was in 1962 i believe it was you understand me huh so you how can we put that in the past it's now it's now if we get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the anti-christ spirit satan will be powerless before her and this is the thing everybody in the message want people to stand still that's not the vision brother branham saw he saw a church marching forward onward christian soldier right she was moving and the revelations were moving with her as she fought the battles the revelations must move what you knew last year or two years ago it's something now moving and you and i must understand who we really are and understand him and there's changes being made in you and me whether you know it or not if you have been quickened if this message has been quickened to you changes are being made everybody has a different pace but guarantee you at the end of the day he said that he promised himself and us he'll never leave one behind not one not one everybody that's been ordained to make a rapture or translation we'll make it that translation hallelujah come on now he said you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus christ himself in the church and his works in the future ages and you got to understand that even as individuals each and every one of us must go through the seven church ages we must experience every one of those things as far as persecution and everything escaping the denomination and revel of the systems and all of these things and uh you know what i'm saying running sometimes for your life and most of these things happen within the family not just a student comparing verses with verses though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear now we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to er to hear and know what is he saying lay yourself open that means prayer folks prayer how are you going you still fighting with yourself when will god take over when will he have preeminence when we know this is the age of the capstone this is the age of headship christ the head of the church at what point in time will he have rule over our lives complete rule the bible said john was caught up into the revelation of jesus christ whoo he saw the coming of the lord and could only write it in simple form he saw our day understand when you see the dragon in revelation it's not literal the dragon is a symbol of people anointed talks about the ten kings and all the people whose anointed by these demonic spirits out of the river of euphrates look at hitler look at stalin mussolini three unclean spirits and where are we now those same three unclean spirits left there and went where hollywood and look what we're doing now replaying the hitler scene because everything they did back there to bring down the germans and bring them and i mean bring down you know they had to conquer the germans first did you know there were those who rebelled against him and they were all killed and then you had you know then the jews and all of that you got to realize what took place and they doing the same thing here everybody says rebelling you got a sentence you got a mark on you i don't know whether you all heard this but i saw this on the youtube myself where president biden even declared that we're coming into the world one world order he said and america must lead the people into it i'm like oh my god this kind of leadership we in trouble not me they but let's move on i'm almost done with this because i was expecting something different but at the opening of the seals every see at the open of the seal every born-again believer became a new mind a new mind his mind was now dropped in on us the very word of god that has been hidden his thoughts his reason for doing certain things he brought it down to us in the opening of the word and we saw his hiding how he hid from those who were of the intellect and began to reveal these things unto us who are we that we can see ourselves in christ who are we but we have one thing we know that they're coming a new earth they're going to be a real new earth but there's coming a new earth here yes and the new earth is now moving in right now you say how can that be the old one passed away the old man passed away and the new man is on the inside right eventually this will be changed and we expecting all all of a sudden poof but that's not the way abraham was changed that's not the way sarah was changed it was little by little that inside don't tell me you don't believe that her molecular structure her dna a man that was faulty and could not produce a child god changed it so much so she changed young but she also the the birthing system was changed don't you understand what i'm saying that's why amen when god gives you the holy ghost he changed the birthing system amen because as a carnal mind you couldn't receive him but he had to change something he had to give you strength like he did sarah hallelujah yes and it's still moving and guess what you're his secret now look how long jesus was on the earth 30 something years before they even realized he was here and then most of them didn't know it and the whole time god is working let's be the god let god be god in you that's that's what i'm gonna say let god be god in you matthew 14 27 31 says but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid no why would he preach a message like that and peter answered him said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the on the water i'm just going to show you something what faith can do and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus had not even yet been to pentecost but he had faith in god and that faith caused him to walk on water you understand well that's all i'm saying what's going to make a rapture for you your faith in the promised word he said come up hear the i came you got to come you got to come to a place amen in your mind that your mind is not thinking earthly it's thinking spiritually it's god's mind in you god's way of thinking and in that time you know what happens all things become possible that's what he said to them that believe but when he saw the wind bolster us he was afraid and began to sink he cried saying lord save me that's what kills your faith fear that's right see oh god i just i just hope i make it yeah look what you're afraid for because if you could make it by works you wouldn't make it because ain't none of us doing the work we ought to be doing thank god for being accepted in the beloved he did all the works for us who could make themselves holy like the bible says can a leopard cleanse himself from the stripes no you lick the more he lick the stripes the more brighter they become and immediately jesus stretched forth this hand and called him and said unto him oh thou what a little faith wherefore did thou doubt how many of y'all really believe you perfect be too slow with that response too slow some of you didn't even respond shame on you too i say it as a rebuke if god said you're perfect you're perfect you don't have to understand it you don't have to look at yourself because you'll never be perfect like that you could never be perfect you were born of failure your perfection comes from god and when god said job was a perfect man he was perfect but if you read job it doesn't look like he was so perfect god said abraham was perfect if you look at abraham it didn't look like he was perfect but in the eyes of god abraham was perfect huh and god did not lie in the book of hebrew the bible said abraham staggered not go to genesis he looked like he staggered to me y'all understand what i'm saying but in the eyes of god it's like paul says paul says we don't need works for faith that's the eyes of god holy thank god for his eyes but james said a man faith without works is dead that's the eyes of man but god says when he when he when he justifies you he glorifies you how many of us thought oh my god brother branham said he hadn't done anything at the age of 55 i think he was at that time he said i better begin to get busy i got to do something for god and i'm like oh my god if we talk about works then i don't know where you know you'll need a magnifying glass a magnifying glass to find me and i mean a powerful one who can do what he did it was god in him he was ordained to do it and whatever you do god will give you the same reward oh you shall oh brother that's not yes it is the 11th hour workers got the same pay the first second third whatever hour they got the same pain can you give me one more thought then i'll let you go it's almost dying but you know what you heard me say this before and i always think about the seals when i say this and how god say it was a half hour silence and i'm not saying this is it but i i will say this that uh everything that we see is already in shadow and type within the word it's in child and type it's always there we you know brother branham what what no it's already written you just got to find out where it's written and every time i think about silence and you heard me preach on this before silence doesn't mean nothing's happening can you hear the sign can you hear the moon what about the stars to us that's silence we can go out there all night stay all night with a uh uh scope and everything else and you'll never hear it now astronauts have instruments and they can pick up that sound but to us it's silence i think about it we'll be plumb crazy if we could hear what's going on in heaven the noise and all of that we'll never get any sleep but because it's silent we can sleep silence doesn't mean nothing's happening and the bible said there was silence in heaven but that doesn't mean nothing was happening because in that silence something was going on on earth the opening of the word was going on nobody could say anything nobody could give the thing away why because that lad those last mysteries had to be unveiled by an earthly angel a prophet not one of those angels that oh i know the secret they couldn't do it and i say this now it may look like nothing's going on in your life but that doesn't mean nothing's not happening because even with your creation even with what god is doing with you the devil has no idea what you're doing and how he's doing it but whether you see it or not you're changing and god sees the change even if you're looking in the mirror you can't see it i always tell people i said one thing about gaining weight you don't never see it until somebody say it boy you're getting big right but you're right there in the mirror you're seeing it all the time but it's silent [Music] and i'm saying all of these things to tell you that here in the book of esther the fourth chapter and i'm gonna go on with it i was gonna read but i'm just gonna say it a king asahura had not spoken to her it was a silence between her and the king and now she's required to go see him and it's a law you cannot go before the king unless he summons for you but there is an urgency haman the devil was getting ready to set up another holocaust just as he's trying to do now a time of urgency and here was uh you know mordecai saying to esther don't even think about it don't think that you're going to get away when you've been ordained for such a time as this if the bride don't pray if she doesn't seek god and pray not only for herself but for the foolish virgin how they're going to make it amen god has put this in our hands and we're being lazy about it not realizing it ain't about just you it's about all of those who comes after you and here was esther said she didn't get selfish she wasn't selfish she took the word and listen this is the mystery this is what i'm trying to say hear what the spirit of the lord is saying to the church she said tell them all the jews i'm going to be fasting for three days and three nights without food or water bread or whatever said i'm going and i want them to do likewise what was that what was esther saying i'm going to lay down before him i'm going to open myself i'm going to die and rot to myself the three days of fasting was like a death burial and resurrection and she said if i perish let me perish i'm going to see the king but she knew she had to die within herself she could not go before the king with hope faith and love drove her there knew the only way that she could stop haman she had to go to a higher authority and listen the only way you can stop this devil you got to go to a higher authority which is god himself and she she went before the king and you didn't hear me preachers because i love esther so much you know she put on that beautiful garment that the king gave her simple but yet holy and she says i'm going to see him can you imagine how the people you know they don't want you to have revelations of the word it's the law if you go to the king without him sumsing you you'll die and the same thing happening when the book is open but people don't want you to get understanding of it he don't you know because you understand that if jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever he can't change in his word can't either he can't make up a new story if he does it has to be the same as the first and esther was not just set in that book she's a book of redemption as ruth is too though the only two books that has women names to it what was it it was the the the salvation of the jews in one and the salvation of a gentile queen in the other y'all know what i'm saying maybe got it mixed up a little bit but you know ruth you know was the gentile and esther was the jew and you see what god is doing now he's driving the forces to what to what to drive us into our homeland which is the word i'm going to see him now one thing about it is the king never acted as if he did not expect her he wasn't shocked now everybody else would have been shocked right in other words she walked in and she broke the silence she broke it not only that when she walked in you can can you imagine when all the king's subjects they may have had a business meeting going on and when the king's subject saw her it automatically came silent now what's happening it was the bride coming esther was now getting ready to take her position she couldn't overthrow the king it was the king who had to place her in her position and the king said unto her don't you know you joiners with me you can have whatever you want to have i give you even half of the kingdom and elsa said no at this point in time i just want to do some fellowshipping i love this we used to sing a song in the pentecostal church lord i'm running lord i'm running i can't tarry and the verse would say something like this i'm so glad satan's mad and i'm so glad he missed the soul he thought he had it makes me laugh at the devil every time i think about that you know it's almost like when a lion catcher uh a buck or something he think he's got the book and all of a sudden the thing get loose he probably in his mind already thinking about how delicious it's going to be you know what i'm saying it's just what it is that's how satan is he he trapped us and thought he was going to capture us and you know devour us but that's not in the book and so we look at this thing you say well brother bruce what are you saying she had the authority given to her so much so she sentenced the devil and all of his children haman had to die all of his sons had to die she got rid of the serpent seed hello and you said what do you mean she stood in the breach mordecai stood in the breach for her she stood in the breach for her people what what about us that's right amen where are we standing those of us we must it's given to us it's ordained to us for us it meant to really stand in the breach we must listen i know we're all struggling you know we we need to overcome everything in the world you understand me not that we haven't you know the thing is sometimes we pick up things we shouldn't pick up or we pick up things we used to do and you know and and and it's because we we move out of that sixth dimension we move out of the presence of the lord we move and we'll we allow satan to draw us back but then god says repent you know i heard what brother brown said the other day and i'm closing i know i've gone a long time but you know what he said which really fascinated me when i heard him say he said most of the time and i may be paraphrasing it but that's what he said he said you don't even have to pray to be healed confess your sins he said that's all a person need to do if you've done wrong confession says and god will heal you then you can make your request amen you and i don't realize it i said like this i won't say you don't i'm saying we must allow god to continue to unfold himself in us stop trying to process god you can't do it you can't do it his ways is past finding out we need to say lord not my will but thine be done how do you think mary in a carnal mind could have ever understood what the angel said she says oh lord she thought about it how can i have a child and i've never known a man then he took her to another level this thing that's going to be of you is not of a man is of god is of the holy ghost hallelujah and his name shall be called jesus and he shall save his people from their sins and guess what she said not me no she didn't say it you know what she said be it unto me according to thy word she beared the reproach now nowadays that people don't care if you don't have three four five six babies out of where like they don't care matter of fact you all in the groove but back in that day it was a very shameful thing for a virgin to break her her seal and to become impregnated that was a very shameful thing right it was a curse when women wouldn't have babies now the world got it back because it's a curse when you have too many see everything is moved backwards flip flop because this is satan's eden but because it's satan eden that means the sons of god must be manifested the devil was manifested in god's eden and the sons of god must be manifested in satan's evil i know we it's so much more i wanted to say i really want to preach it but i know i have to be careful still yet but at the same time people i'm closing we can stand those of you who can we look at uh our day and how the message of the world is becoming alive to us it's becoming real it is to me i'm marvel at the message i marvel at the word because i'm seeing things i've never seen before and i i know it all comes back to you and me whatever god reveals is always something about what he expects and the potential he wants that's in us that he wants to see manifest even jesus before his first miracle understood what he possessed he even told us uh mary woman don't you know it's not my time yet so she he knew what he had [Music] and we're saying lord is it our time yet it's time if not now when look how our people's suffering i can't stand it now i'm pushing i'm pressing because i believe it with all my heart i don't know what god is going to do with me but there's something driving me there's something pushing me that something got me pressing because i believe i'm a son of god and i believe that has been revealed to me that i am and i believe that something's something's there and now it's not for me it's for the people of god i said god empower your people not just me all of us because when we unite when we unite we become omnipotent because the of the omnipotence in us we become all-powerful so much so he said if you say to this mountain be thy moon you think you're speaking figurative lee no it's reality it's what will be done [Music] you and i have we like to say well we've got a long way to go we do not have a long way to go that's time god doesn't dwell in time as such he's eternal and the eternal god is in me the eternal god is in you we need to just let go and let god we need to learn says lord give me grace to pray now if you don't forget how to pray lord teach me how to pray show me what i stand and need our lord god to fulfill your word at every junction you always had somebody waiting for their change and i believe our chain change has come it may not look like it it may look like this is a time of silence but it is not god is still doing what he promised he would do one thing about esther she was a secret and one thing about you you are a secret but at that moment in his own time he's gonna make all things beautiful heavenly father we come before you lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you've been better to me personally and i say that all the time because it's true but lord you told me something today and i repent from it you told me not to say i'm an unworthy servant because you've made me worthy forgive me father but i do thank you for the revelation i realize that as long as i say i'm unworthy i will always be but if you've made me worthy you counted me worthy i want to take that stance i want to stand for you jesus i want to stand for your word i want to stand for everything you say that we are hallelujah hallelujah father forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness all unbelief let your presence in your word live in us with all authority lord your lovely name jesus christ [Music] in his time here is [Music] lord please show me as you're teaching these that you do just [Music] time [Music] in your time [Music] thank you [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] lovely [Music] [Music] yes sir yes sir [Music] [Music] that you do just [Music] do [Music] foreign
