the eth verse you there fifth verse before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou cameth forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I are Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for thou shallal go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt

Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves we truly appreciate you Lord and father we ask oh God in your lovely name that you forgive us for anything we may have said or done today cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord and draw us nearer to thee bless us in the reading of your word and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen we're going to just start there by the grace of God there's a lot of things that uh uh Jeremiah is the biggest book or uh in in in in the uh Bible it has uh more chapters I believe than any um but what I uh of the Old Testament but I want to say by the grace of God uh the reason why we chose Jeremiah we've read it several times and we have found uh Jeremiah to be uh almost parallel to the time that we're living in and I do apologize I don't have my Bible with me I looked everywhere for it and couldn't find it but um I will work with what I have here tonight um so we when we look at Jeremiah uh we sometimes look at the Old Testament as as though it's history and it is history but brother bam tells us that man because of who he is he always repeats themselves somehow we just don't learn and if we followed the nation Israel you'll find out that uh Israel always got in trouble with god um I may yeah always get in trouble with God and uh so we realize by the grace of God that uh Israel we we look at them and we say well you know how how how how on Earth could they do what they do or why did they do what they did and um but they're human they were human just like we are and they made a lot of mistakes and even though they were God's chosen people God did not spare them matter of fact every time a nation or people especially Israel when they get to a place where their backsliding or is so great God always raise up a prophet and that Prophet as we know according to Amos the Bible tells us that the word of the Lord comes to that Prophet now that Prophet is a special kind of a man he's ordained a prophet he's uh been born a prophet he is a Prophet by God's making not his making not man's making his making um and Jeremiah is the name in itself means appointed by God it has a it also mean God is high and Jeremiah when he spoke uh to Judah and uh the other parts of uh Israel mainly Judah um it was about 30 to 40 years he prophesied and and told them what was going to come to pass now we realize by the grace of God God God had already told Jeremiah um I'm going to have you preach to these people and their hearts are going to be hard there there is it going to be in Repentance and when God was telling them that basically he was saying they have crossed the line there is no more salvation for them in in this way and it was very hard uh for Jeremiah cuz he he spoke from his heart heart that's why that's why he's called uh the weeping prophet he was passionate about uh what he was doing and um we realize by the grace of God this he was called by God in what 635 BC and that means before Christ and of course he was a prophet and he had that life to that God had already dained him to do remember I read that scripture that God told Jeremiah I called you before you were in your Mo your mother's womb one of the reasons why I want to uh also work with Jeremiah because I want you to see the parallel things that we're going to come in contact in this particular book so many things Israel is is doing and has done we as Americans we have done the same our sin is just as as great as theirs perhaps even greater because they were moving forward learning of God but in our day we've come to know the Lord Jesus Christ and yet and still we do the same thing now as I said Jeremiah known as the weeping prophet uh he he basically was a prophet to the southern Kingdom of Judah in the Old Testament and right before uh Judas ultimately fell to Babylon and was led away in captivity in other words because they did not listen to the Prophecies of of of Jeremiah uh and Jeremiah told them that God had raised up a Babylonian King and this King was going to come and conquer them but you see the people because they had been spoiled uh if I could say it like that because God had been so good to them it's almost like what the Book of Revelation says about leoa about our day we rich increase with good and have need of nothing so they had an attitude that God is we're the people of God we have the temple of God we are though there in Jerusalem and and and and and this is God's City God's holy place and nothing can happen to this place but you see it when it came to God God wanted obedience and always remember obedience is better than sacrifice because you and I we're dealing with a lot of demons nowadays in our day we're dealing with the Demons of the anal luian day we you know we going way back historically into into Noah's day and we could see what those demons calls uh uh the the kind of judgment they caused to come upon men so much so that God said he even repented that he made man and he destroyed every time we get to this Junction a junction of time God will raise up a Prophet The Prophet would prophesy you have some to believe and some don't won't you have some that are saved and some that will not be saved but but I want in our study of this Jeremiah you're going to see that harsh things came to some of these people because they fought against the word now it's pretty difficult for a a preacher to preach and then the people people that he preaches to uh purposely rebel against him everybody uh Jeremiah preached against uh they hated him uh even his family hated him and all he was doing was rebuking a backsliding nation and he was trying to hoping correction would come even though God said they wouldn't repent and I wonder is it like this now because remember brother brandham he preached a message indictment and he indicted the United States and he said they'll never have another Revival because they crossed the line of mercy and that's what we do not as individuals want to do cross the line of mercy God have mercy on whom he will God have Grace on whom he will but you know even so God has a line that that that we should never never cross cuzz once you cross that line there is no no room for repentance right so God knew and and I I I say it like this because I want you to understand God knew the kind of battles that Nehemiah was going to go through so one of the first things he told Nehemiah trying to build his faith building his confidence building his uh uh Assurance basically I knew you now God Of Heaven and Earth is telling NE uh Jeremiah did I say nemiah Jeremiah that I knew you before the foundation of the world and here in our last day we have received word of consolation and word of encouragement that God knew us before the foundation of the world now he's given that to you not just to you know say oh praise God he knew no you're going to need to know that because this is a vicious age and I'll say it like that that's the kind of age that Jeremiah had to work in a vicious age where people were all in their flesh and God was nowhere in their lives they they pretended they were church goers they went to church and right after church they did whatever they wanted to do and now God was calling them into judgment now listen he said I knew you before you were born I call you to be a prophet and I want you to understand that everything that you will preach I will be preaching it through you
