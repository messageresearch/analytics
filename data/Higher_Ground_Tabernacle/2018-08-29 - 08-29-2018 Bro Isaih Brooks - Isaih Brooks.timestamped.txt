[26:35] god is good
[26:39] all the time and all the time
[26:44] God is good we thank God for His grace
[26:50] in His mercy as we stand we're just
[26:53] going to get right into the word of God
[26:55] tonight
[26:56] I sometimes wonder why God uses me I
[27:22] don't know whether anyone else thinks
[27:25] like that sometimes out of all of the
[27:30] people in the world he chose me I still
[27:38] can't figure that one out I have to take
[27:43] what he says we were in him before the
[27:46] foundation of the world so that gives me
[27:51] no ground to boast other than on him and
[27:57] I am so grateful tonight to be a part of
[28:01] God in spite of all my faults and
[28:06] failures I know that he loves me and I
[28:12] appreciate that because see you can love
[28:13] God and that it has no promises but when
[28:20] God loves you
[28:22] it promises you everything revelations
[28:27] the eighth chapter we're living in such
[28:34] an age that we need to know that it is a
[28:38] dangerous time we're going to read the
[28:39] first five verses of Revelations the
[28:42] eighth chapter oftentimes we forget the
[28:47] day that we in this is a dangerous time
[28:53] revelation is eight one through five and
[28:56] when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[28:58] There was silence in heaven about the
[29:02] space of half an hour and I saw the
[29:06] seven angels which stood before God and
[29:08] to them were given seven trumpets and
[29:13] another angel came is stood at the altar
[29:15] having a golden censer and there was
[29:19] given unto Him much incense that he
[29:22] should offer it with the prayers of all
[29:25] the saints upon the golden altar which
[29:28] was before the throne take notice to
[29:31] this prayer that's being offered prayers
[29:36] of all the saints were offered so it's
[29:41] it's a needed thing in order for this
[29:45] scripture to be fulfilled it must be
[29:47] Saints praying so your prayers are
[29:52] needed and the smoke of the incense
[29:56] which came with the prayers of the Saint
[29:58] Saints ascended up before God out of the
[30:02] Angels hands and the angel took the
[30:05] censer and filled it with fire of the
[30:08] altar and cast it into the earth there
[30:11] were voices and thunderings and
[30:14] lightnings and an earthquake so if you
[30:22] let us pray father God we come before
[30:25] your Lord as humbly as we know how and
[30:28] we thank you for your grace and your
[30:30] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[30:34] us
[30:35] from cleansing us Lord from all about
[30:37] righteousness Lord our sins be many but
[30:44] I know father God you cleanse us and
[30:46] washes us every day thank you lord thank
[30:50] you for the blood of your dear son Jesus
[30:52] Christ that perfects us day by day bless
[30:57] your people now give us ears to hear and
[31:00] a heart to receive in Jesus Christ's
[31:04] name we pray amen you may be seated I
[31:09] like to just title this message before
[31:13] the third woe for those of us who may
[31:21] not know that we are right in between
[31:30] the second and the third in Revelations
[31:36] 813 it says and I beheld and heard an
[31:40] angel flying through the midst of heaven
[31:42] saying with the loud voice woe woe woe
[31:45] to the inhabitants of the earth by
[31:49] reason of the other voices of the
[31:51] trumpet of the three angels which are
[31:54] yet to sound now you and I know and
[31:59] understand by God's grace that two of
[32:05] the walls have already sounded where the
[32:09] venom goes on to say the third one has
[32:11] already and we know by God's grace that
[32:15] the everything overlaps it's a process
[32:21] things happen and you know a lot of
[32:24] times people don't even know what's
[32:26] going on but when you think about a woe
[32:29] it's not something that you get excited
[32:32] about is actually something dangerous
[32:34] coming and you and I must know that we
[32:42] are right in between it you know how can
[32:48] I
[32:49] said there was a time it was three
[32:51] minutes to midnight and I think we're at
[32:55] a place right at midnight just in a
[33:01] moment's time and what Satan is doing to
[33:06] all of us he's keeping us busy and when
[33:16] when you're too busy that word busy
[33:19] means burden under Satan's yoke because
[33:24] that's what it is you're so busy that
[33:29] you literally we forget the time we're
[33:32] living in and we forgotten that millions
[33:36] of people have already died under the
[33:38] first war in the second woke the first
[33:41] wolf for those of us who may not
[33:42] understand was World War one and Jesus
[33:47] said it at at the eleventh hour when he
[33:51] began to call people to the gospel
[33:53] that's when World War one was over the
[33:58] 11th month the 11th day of the month 11
[34:01] minute 11th hour everything was 11 11 11
[34:05] and to this day they don't even know how
[34:07] that world war stopped and Men declared
[34:12] that they would never go into another
[34:14] world war and I think it was like 30
[34:17] years later a second woe came and that
[34:22] wall was world war two now mind you were
[34:26] while one was stopped because God told
[34:30] those angel the full wind stopped
[34:33] because my servants have not received
[34:36] the seal and you and I know that we are
[34:41] not servants with children so God was
[34:43] working with the Jews we're right here
[34:47] at a time where the Jews and now the
[34:50] focus of the whole world even our
[34:55] president just said something about them
[34:57] paying a greater price or the the air is
[35:01] playing a greater price Jew
[35:03] Israel has paid a great price so anyway
[35:05] anyway we realized that there's a little
[35:08] stirring still going on when everybody
[35:11] thought it has settled down we know by
[35:17] God's grace through reading how that
[35:21] Israel is preparing for the coming
[35:24] Messiah now it's amazing how they're
[35:26] preparing and the bride is supposed to
[35:28] be preparing but understanding to the
[35:32] bride gets in her position Moses and
[35:35] Elijah can't come we're not only holding
[35:39] up the rapture but we're also holding up
[35:41] the prophecy of Moses and Elijah because
[35:44] they can't come once they come then you
[35:47] and I understand that the door to the
[35:49] Gentile is over whether Adam said
[35:52] they'll be crying and screaming the name
[35:54] of Jesus and won't get anything and you
[35:59] wonder how come that's so because
[36:01] remember now Jesus changed his name even
[36:06] in the Jewish dispensation they called
[36:09] him Jehovah but then Jesus when he came
[36:13] he said except you believe that I am he
[36:15] you should likewise die in your sin and
[36:18] he went on to say amen there is no other
[36:21] power there is no other name given under
[36:23] heaven whereby we must be saved but the
[36:25] name of Jesus Christ so calling on
[36:28] Jehovah wasn't the key it wouldn't fit
[36:31] the door and so all those Jews that
[36:34] believed in Jehovah in the way they did
[36:37] perished only those Jews who were able
[36:40] to cross over in that time of transition
[36:43] amen they they crossed over from law
[36:46] into grace and during that time him and
[36:48] they they began to believe in Jesus
[36:50] Christ and and the prophet of God and
[36:52] the historian Josephus said every
[36:55] follower of Jesus Christ heard what he
[36:58] said
[36:59] and when Titus came in 70 AD not one
[37:04] Christian was slaughtered in that
[37:06] massacre because they heard what he said
[37:11] you see the armies and camp about Israel
[37:14] Jerusalem don't you go down and get your
[37:16] stuff you keep moving everybody that
[37:20] didn't hear that ran into the rusyn I'm
[37:22] thinking they were safety and sheltered
[37:25] there in Jerusalem and God had turned
[37:28] the table and the place that they
[37:31] thought was a refuge became a deathtrap
[37:36] you and I must understand that's kind of
[37:39] like what our brother John sched was
[37:42] telling us our refuge is not in the
[37:45] shelter of what we call the message it's
[37:49] in the shelter of Christ Jesus being in
[37:51] you now the message is the one the
[37:55] message understand what I'm saying the
[37:57] message can take you there but because
[38:01] you read it and because you believe it
[38:03] doesn't make you safe right because
[38:08] understand that's how the Baptist's
[38:10] believe they believe but have you
[38:13] received the Holy Ghost since you
[38:16] believe even the prophet of God called
[38:19] his message the Holy Ghost message he is
[38:24] the one who gave us the entrance he key
[38:26] he's the one that God unlocked the keys
[38:29] of first Peters that had to your faith
[38:31] virtue acknowledge because we thought
[38:33] once we experienced the Holy Ghost we
[38:36] were done but we find out that when you
[38:39] received the Holy Ghost amen you are now
[38:42] just born and you've got to grow up into
[38:45] a statue of Christ that's why we finding
[38:49] people fall away because they they
[38:52] weren't completely sealed doesn't mean
[38:55] that didn't have an experience with God
[38:57] but some of them are still babies still
[38:59] justified never getting sanctified but
[39:03] if you don't get sanctified you can't
[39:05] have the Holy Ghost God can't see you is
[39:08] what I'm saying testimony
[39:14] he said my Christian friends a sinner
[39:17] friends whatever you do if you believe
[39:19] mean to be sent from God you seek the
[39:23] kingdom of God just as quick as you can
[39:25] and get into it
[39:27] but that's the only safety we have today
[39:31] the world's at the end of the age only
[39:34] in Christ are you saved so you and I
[39:40] must realize amen that there's I read
[39:42] that scripture according to revelation 8
[39:45] chapter because we know when the seven
[39:47] seals were open there was a silence in
[39:50] heaven there are things that brother
[39:52] Adam seen and he said I cannot interpret
[39:55] them yet throughout the the age of this
[39:59] what we called message men have tried to
[40:01] interpret the silence the silence is
[40:05] only God is the only one who can
[40:08] interpret that and if God didn't let a
[40:12] prophet see it and understand it he
[40:14] surely won't let you see it and
[40:16] understand it until that time comes so
[40:19] you and I must understand a men that
[40:22] went being men began to say oh I got it
[40:25] I got it brother well said even if you
[40:27] had a new name and you knew it a new
[40:29] name you wouldn't tell nobody the Holy
[40:31] Ghost wouldn't even allow you to tell it
[40:33] so you and I must understand him and
[40:36] that we're at a time when everything is
[40:40] being shaked shaken remember I told you
[40:43] how that when David even sought to tow
[40:46] the men I want you to go in there and
[40:48] conquer the Jeb's eyes and I want you to
[40:50] you know possess Jerusalem he said but
[40:54] when you go in I want you to kill the
[40:56] main right and I want you to kill the
[40:59] blind there'll be nothing that's going
[41:01] to defile the city and I really believe
[41:04] that's the hour that we're living in
[41:07] everybody who cannot walk straight with
[41:09] the word if you don't repent God will
[41:12] get rid of you those of you who say I
[41:15] believe the message but you allowing
[41:16] your eyes to be blind to the signs of
[41:19] the time God is gonna get rid of you
[41:21] because there is there will be no man no
[41:25] less
[41:25] nothing that will defile the kingdom so
[41:29] none of your bad habits that make you
[41:31] live hallelujah amen everything that you
[41:36] are you you possess that's not of God
[41:38] has to go is that right yeah that's what
[41:42] I probably preach you and I must come
[41:45] into a perfect statue of Christ but the
[41:48] devil God is so busy and while he has us
[41:55] busy we are neglecting one of the most
[41:59] important things that God has given to
[42:03] us to make it and that's prayer but the
[42:08] madam said I was talking on prayer or
[42:11] power prayer power of speech power of
[42:13] the Holy life amen
[42:15] he said that's what the Holy Ghost is to
[42:17] do some of you people walking along
[42:20] saying well I just can't quit drinking I
[42:23] just can't quit this the Holy Ghost
[42:25] comes to living you to make all these
[42:29] cans get away from you that's right make
[42:33] women stop cutting their hair make them
[42:35] quit wearing shorts and slacks no
[42:37] excuses make them quit tattling
[42:41] oh yes that's what it's for to make you
[42:44] a holy life it'll follow it'll it'll it
[42:50] will follow the instructions of the
[42:52] Bible every time y'all hear what I'm
[42:56] saying see a woman say it's just too hot
[42:58] I just have to wear these give me a
[43:01] headache if I let my hair grow but
[43:04] there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost
[43:06] it's there to make it so it's follow the
[43:10] word just exactly that's what the Holy
[43:13] Ghost is to do so when people don't
[43:16] follow the Holy Ghost exactly it makes
[43:19] it brings us to a question do they
[43:22] really have it or do they have an
[43:26] impostor something that's acting like
[43:30] the Holy Ghost because brother Baron
[43:33] said in his last days Satan will
[43:36] personate he impersonate
[43:38] every gift everything that the Holy
[43:41] Ghost can do he can impersonate except
[43:43] one thing and that's life
[43:47] once the Holy Ghost comes in you and
[43:50] give you light you know that's the Holy
[43:52] Ghost right see it is to make you make
[43:57] you man
[43:57] turn your hair from them have naked
[43:59] women and quit lusting after them in a
[44:02] church member see that's what it'll do
[44:04] it is to quit making you smoke and drink
[44:08] won't be a beach shot and to take that
[44:11] out of you it'll humble you when you do
[44:13] that that's what the Holy Ghost is for
[44:16] it's for a holy life that's right make
[44:19] you quit gossiping make you quit playing
[44:21] cards shooting craps and all these other
[44:24] things that you do around the corner
[44:25] it'll make you quit you're carrying on
[44:28] the way you're doing living unto you to
[44:30] you while a living untrue to your wife
[44:32] that's what I'm gonna do that's right
[44:34] it'll quit making it a quit making you
[44:38] want to marry someone else's wife that's
[44:40] exactly right that's what it is is to
[44:43] make you live a holy life that's what
[44:46] the Holy Ghost is powerful to set your
[44:49] affection on things above where God
[44:52] stands there see the mind of Christ is
[44:55] in you you can't help from seeing those
[44:58] things when you look at them you turn
[45:00] your head that's right is to make you
[45:03] you say oh I can't do it oh I just can't
[45:06] do it sure you can't but the Holy Ghost
[45:09] comes for that purpose that's what it
[45:12] did it comes to take it out of you all
[45:15] of them all habits and things that
[45:17] you're doing right what that's what it
[45:21] came for see you and I we can't do it
[45:24] but the Holy Ghost can do it that's what
[45:28] he came for is that right but like he
[45:30] said see sometimes we just too loose
[45:34] about things were too loose about it we
[45:36] we love this grace and we get loose
[45:39] about it is that right
[45:41] he said that's what's the matter we
[45:43] don't get seal so much we're too loose
[45:46] about things when the inspector goes
[45:48] through to inspect your life you see it
[45:52] if you're not just a little loose about
[45:53] things little loose about your prayer
[45:56] life little loose about that temper
[45:59] little loose about that tongue to talk
[46:01] about others
[46:02] he'll never seal the car some dirty
[46:05] habits some foul things some verga
[46:08] vulgarity mine he can't seal the car but
[46:12] when he found everything in place the
[46:16] inspector then he seals it dare to be
[46:20] anybody open that seal until the car has
[46:23] reached its destiny to where it's sealed
[46:25] for there it is touch not my anointed do
[46:29] my prophets no harm but I say unto you
[46:31] it'll be better for you that a smear
[46:34] stone was hanging at your neck and you
[46:37] were drown in the depths of the sea then
[46:39] even to try to a fin or shake a shake a
[46:43] little on the least of these that then
[46:46] seal see what I mean see so you and I
[46:49] must understand we're just too loose I
[46:53] believe all of us can say Amen we're too
[46:56] loose but God said if you want this you
[46:59] got to tighten up we got to be more
[47:03] serious about what we're working with
[47:05] because you and I must understand only
[47:08] brother madam said like this he said
[47:11] you're gonna either receive the mark of
[47:12] the beast are you gonna receive the seal
[47:14] of God is up to us
[47:18] hmm right we're now like I'm bringing
[47:23] this thing so you can see where I'm at
[47:25] where we are right at a moment's time
[47:28] from the catching away everything is
[47:32] moving in position
[47:34] the earth is groaning hurricanes coming
[47:38] on all kinds of ways and directions
[47:40] earthquakes is that right in depth you
[47:44] know they're so worried about mount st.
[47:48] Helen erupting because they say if it
[47:51] erupts it can literally cause another
[47:53] Ice Age whoo we don't have to be afraid
[47:57] about Mount Saint Helen she can't
[47:59] erupted her we leave
[48:03] per se but we want to be caught up in
[48:06] that number we don't have to worry about
[48:08] Russia bombing us Russia Kate a drop a
[48:12] bomb until the bride is gold so but all
[48:16] the creation is groaning and waiting for
[48:20] the manifestations of the sons of God
[48:22] we're here
[48:23] but we've been dilatory we've been loose
[48:26] and God says tighten it up he don't want
[48:31] us to fear but he want us to be
[48:33] concerned he really want us to be
[48:36] diligent about his promises and his
[48:41] achievements right he promised Abraham
[48:45] success he did and I'm gonna bless you
[48:48] Abraham but Abraham had to be mindful of
[48:52] everything God told him to do and you
[48:56] and I must be mindful of everything God
[49:00] has told us to do in order to make a
[49:02] rapture
[49:03] I believe we're saying but that ain't
[49:05] where we want to be there'll be a lot of
[49:07] people saying who these versions of me
[49:10] say but I don't want to be us be saved I
[49:13] want to make a rapture hallelujah listen
[49:17] what brother Byrne says he says how the
[49:19] pains birth pain struck the world in
[49:22] World War one she had a terrific pain
[49:25] because they had pause and gasps and so
[49:28] forth that almost could destroy the
[49:30] world and in World War two
[49:32] she struck another heart harder pain
[49:35] they had blockbusters and also atomic
[49:38] bombs she cannot stand another labor
[49:41] pain here he said she cannot the world
[49:46] cannot stand another labor pain will she
[49:49] get one absolutely so that's where we
[49:53] are people looking at Russia because we
[49:56] know Russia is one that's gonna send the
[49:57] bomb right people looking and they
[50:00] missing the whole whole political scheme
[50:03] you know of the other of the Catholic
[50:06] Church because she's controlling
[50:07] everything and people don't understand
[50:10] why do you think that these demonic
[50:13] powers have been loosed on the earth
[50:15] like like it has been
[50:17] you know we watch demons and you know
[50:19] look at dmoz and you know posters of
[50:21] demons and we think about some figment
[50:23] of somebody's imagination but people are
[50:26] inspired to draw these things and
[50:30] understand demons have to have an image
[50:33] to be worshiped by that's why the bob
[50:36] said don't make no graven image so when
[50:39] you have images I remember somebody gave
[50:42] my wife and I disfigure reen statues and
[50:45] and then you know they were lovely I
[50:47] love them but a brother with the gift
[50:51] came and said but there's witchcraft
[50:53] behind this I would have never guessed
[50:56] it and the figurines were expensive and
[51:00] he said if you don't believe what I said
[51:02] go somewhere privately break them up and
[51:05] see their reaction I broke them up on a
[51:08] Wednesday and one of the sisters stopped
[51:11] coming altogether and the whole time
[51:13] they looked at me with their faces
[51:15] balled up what was it their plans were
[51:19] spoiled you know and my thing is you
[51:24] know you know people dear Catholic
[51:27] friends that I have
[51:28] you know they pray to this one saying I
[51:30] pray tonight and it works that's why you
[51:33] got so many of them still there because
[51:36] they pray to these statues and they
[51:38] don't understand their demonic powers
[51:40] behind it that will make it happen
[51:43] I'm come on somebody but they think it's
[51:46] God hello
[51:51] they think is God but it's not God if
[51:54] you know your history if you go back in
[51:57] the Bible you'll find out that is the
[51:58] reason why God didn't like images
[52:00] because demons hid behind those things
[52:11] understand me now you say well what do
[52:14] you mean brother that's why we cannot
[52:16] bow to the image of the beast
[52:19] we can't we came back down to an
[52:21] organization or denomination because it
[52:24] is an image it's not God but it's an
[52:28] image and you know we we preach Catholic
[52:31] but it ain't just Catholic is that all
[52:33] of the Protestants have gone to the same
[52:35] thing see but you not have been so
[52:41] blessed because we can see we have eyes
[52:46] to see that there's only one God that's
[52:49] how the Catholic Church got that's how
[52:51] they got started understand the Catholic
[52:53] Church was a pillar Coster Church sure
[52:56] they were they were a real church in the
[52:59] beginning but after 1830 378 D 325 325
[53:06] ad Constantine during that time won the
[53:11] war and you know there communica cancer
[53:13] got together and all the churches got
[53:15] together and they literally kicked out
[53:17] according to Josephus they literally
[53:19] kicked out all the spiritual ones
[53:22] brother Adam say they had no business
[53:24] going down there huh all of the profits
[53:29] and everything what they kicked out they
[53:31] then began to kill off see what I'm
[53:35] trying to say is who you and I gotta
[53:37] escape we must escape we've got to
[53:42] tighten down we gotta focus
[53:44] cry out before God says Lord keep me
[53:46] help me focus draw me back to that that
[53:50] that way of see that way of sight y'all
[53:54] remember how we first started out we
[53:56] kept our eyes on Jesus but we've allowed
[54:01] all these things distract us and
[54:03] everything else and we're right at the
[54:05] next whoa peppers
[54:12] is that right T Eve Eve should have been
[54:16] this is what he said Eve should have
[54:19] been burned along with the serpent for
[54:21] their awful deed burn because remember
[54:26] fire is the Last Judgement the lake of
[54:29] fire is the last judgment of God and if
[54:33] that was the judgment in the ending in
[54:35] the at the end it should have been the
[54:37] judgment in the beginning but the only
[54:40] thing that kept Eve from being burned is
[54:42] because Adam stepped in and saved her
[54:45] and that's the only reason why we won't
[54:47] be burned because how Adam stepped in
[54:50] and saved us he said but when it comes
[54:53] to this world it's last this last Eid
[54:56] this last Church age he said there will
[54:59] be no one to stand for her why she
[55:04] kicked him out when he came knocking on
[55:06] the door she kicked him out that right
[55:12] he said but Adam intervene taking
[55:15] quickly to himself so that she was saved
[55:19] but when this satanic religion has gone
[55:23] the full course of the ages there will
[55:26] be no one to intervene and she will be
[55:29] burned with her seducers for the
[55:32] and her children and the Antichrist and
[55:34] Satan will all find their place in the
[55:37] lake of fire now you say why are you
[55:40] saying all of this because I want you to
[55:43] understand this literature this word has
[55:46] gone out and it can't come back boy God
[55:50] cannot lie hallelujah and the vision has
[55:53] been made plain the Bible said when the
[55:56] vision has been made pray let him that
[55:58] read it run not walk run because he
[56:05] won't always tarry
[56:08] hallelujah y'all understand me
[56:11] so we look at this thing and you say
[56:13] well brother Brooks what are you trying
[56:15] to say I'm trying to say it's so plain
[56:18] but we've missing it you know you never
[56:20] hear people to talk about this this this
[56:23] religion that sits on seven hills and
[56:25] baba says it was a beast with seven
[56:27] years don't seven heads were seven
[56:29] mounts in those seven hills and that's
[56:31] where Rome said and understand a man she
[56:34] has power over all the earth
[56:37] even now whoa there ain't a witch in the
[56:41] world that can outdo the witch is there
[56:44] they are the highest of all witchcraft
[56:48] yes sir buddy and you better believe
[56:51] Amen that when the Prophet God said all
[56:54] those demons came back down into
[56:56] Hollywood amen and what those Hollywood
[56:58] demons doing now is casting spells on
[57:00] people oh that was a good movie and you
[57:04] don't even know you've been possessed
[57:07] it's coming through the fourth time in
[57:09] China and you think amen his pleasure
[57:15] and the devil is laughing at you is that
[57:17] right brother Brad that's the devil's
[57:19] preaching machine and just like a
[57:23] preacher the world said he preached he's
[57:26] telling you the vision of God but the
[57:29] devil is telling you a vision of hell
[57:31] and all we see now is demonic power
[57:34] coming up as heroes and we're glorifying
[57:40] them and we don't even realize by God's
[57:44] grace that we are being entertained by
[57:47] devils and all they're doing is setting
[57:51] you up to make You mr. rapture is that
[58:01] all right it's the truth mr. truth some
[58:06] of the stuff they got down out now for
[58:08] toys for children out and scared of been
[58:10] a nightmare experience for me these kids
[58:13] are loving it huh and so they dress up
[58:18] women as princesses and everything else
[58:20] and they half naked one thing I do like
[58:24] about them that most of them do have
[58:26] long hair but you know you look at this
[58:30] thing and you say all Brotherhood's what
[58:31] are you trying to say I'm saying we need
[58:33] to tighten up if we want the virtues of
[58:36] God I'll speak I'm preaching to me to
[58:38] folks this
[58:39] is coming this way in that way and we
[58:42] want these virtues in us we must pray
[58:45] that God will allow these virtues to
[58:48] come and when the tests come to prove it
[58:51] we will pass the test ha ha I don't want
[58:57] to be left behind the Lord is my refuge
[59:01] we don't have a rock to run to no more
[59:04] hmm we don't have that there's not a
[59:08] mountain we can climb that's gonna allow
[59:11] us to escape the wrath that is to come
[59:13] how are we going to get out of this
[59:17] place he has given us the mystery he's
[59:19] given us the mystery or the revelation
[59:21] of the mystery to us for our age like he
[59:24] did in the days of Noah is that right in
[59:28] the second Exodus owner in from Egypt a
[59:31] man from Egypt on out of Egypt he gave
[59:33] them the remedy he gave them the that
[59:35] the formula put the blood on the
[59:37] doorpost and a little and you'll get out
[59:39] of here tonight
[59:41] see he's given us the remedy of making
[59:44] the heavens because you and I must
[59:46] understand no unclean thing will enter
[59:50] there in God a plan God don't care if
[59:56] I'm a preacher being a preacher does not
[59:59] qualify me for heaven but being sealed
[1:00:03] with the Holy Ghost qualifies me for
[1:00:06] heaven after your faith virtue knowledge
[1:00:10] temperance patience and that's where a
[1:00:12] lot of us fall right there godliness we
[1:00:15] don't even get to bluntly kindness but
[1:00:17] godliness acting like God living like
[1:00:20] God behaving like God it is right there
[1:00:24] with those the spirits get us all of us
[1:00:30] guilty brother but we got a we
[1:00:36] we got to get on our knees and pray
[1:00:37] we've got to ask God lord help us Jesus
[1:00:41] you say what would pray now see if your
[1:00:45] prayers are needed for the censors you
[1:00:50] understand me
[1:00:51] the prayers of the saints were placed in
[1:00:53] the sin serves so God expects us to pray
[1:00:57] there's a place for your prayer
[1:01:01] hallelujah and those senses amen words
[1:01:04] are all thus prayers of the saints and
[1:01:07] what God does when that angel grab that
[1:01:10] sister and He pours it out what does he
[1:01:12] do he is literally revenge' her of her
[1:01:15] adversaries for the devil amen
[1:01:18] treatments the way he's treated us and
[1:01:20] in causing us to behave the way we
[1:01:22] behave everything that we have fallen -
[1:01:26] lord help me God put it in a sensor it's
[1:01:30] needed if that means somebody gotta be
[1:01:37] praying
[1:01:37] Murilo brother I don't ask they ask a
[1:01:40] question when the foolish version y'all
[1:01:42] say this all the time the foolish
[1:01:44] virgins when they came looking for oil
[1:01:47] the wise virgin said to the foolish
[1:01:48] virgin you go pray up evidently that's
[1:01:52] what she was lacking she was lacking
[1:01:55] prayer without a prayer life your home
[1:02:00] is defeated already ain't no Bible
[1:02:04] studying if you don't pray that you're
[1:02:06] not gonna have no family time and no
[1:02:08] pilot studying you don't need pray
[1:02:10] you're not going to you feel like doing
[1:02:12] it but if you got an atmosphere a prayer
[1:02:17] it'll change everything some see uh
[1:02:29] I wrote in my little notes I said I will
[1:02:33] not fear the only way you can know not
[1:02:38] fear is when you have made your call in
[1:02:40] an election sure you will fear David
[1:02:46] said though I walk through the valley of
[1:02:47] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:02:50] I'm not gonna fear the things that Satan
[1:02:54] is is that right because the Bob said
[1:02:56] the thing you fear it's the thing that
[1:02:58] God will allow to come on you your fear
[1:03:01] brings it alliant even though it's wrong
[1:03:07] coming at you if he doesn't sense fear
[1:03:09] he is stopped he might come again but he
[1:03:16] gonna stop the first time because he
[1:03:18] expects you to fear everything feels a
[1:03:20] lion but when a man is being charged for
[1:03:23] a lion has charged him the worst thing
[1:03:25] you could do is turn your back cuz he
[1:03:27] said he know he's got you the thing
[1:03:30] you've got to do is stand still they're
[1:03:31] looking right in the face and let him
[1:03:33] know you don't fear because it's in an
[1:03:35] animal to fear man that's what the game
[1:03:40] one told me so it ain't my thoughts is
[1:03:43] what a game one told me he said you
[1:03:45] can't fear the animal because they can
[1:03:47] smell it the Satan can smell your fear
[1:03:52] and the more you fear Him the more he's
[1:03:54] gonna come at you I will not fear fear
[1:04:00] is a distressing emotion aroused by
[1:04:03] impending danger evil or pain wherever
[1:04:07] the threat is real or imagined the
[1:04:10] feeling or condition of being afraid so
[1:04:13] it doesn't matter whether it's reality
[1:04:15] or something imagine you still can fear
[1:04:19] is that right rather than say there be
[1:04:22] many people who live with certain
[1:04:24] diseases or what conquer the disease
[1:04:27] because they didn't fear if you don't
[1:04:30] fear cancer he can't he can't destroy
[1:04:33] you but it's only when you fear hmm
[1:04:41] one one two three says Amen hear my cry
[1:04:44] of God intend unto my prayer for the end
[1:04:49] of the earth will I cry unto thee and
[1:04:51] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[1:04:54] the rock that is higher than I see
[1:04:56] that's what we supposed to do when
[1:04:58] things are overwhelming what we supposed
[1:05:00] to go to God in prayer I think that's
[1:05:03] why he said things to bring us back to
[1:05:05] prayer most of us know that's true God
[1:05:08] will do whatever he has to do to get our
[1:05:11] minds and hearts back on him hallelujah
[1:05:15] and once we get back there he'll fix it
[1:05:18] for us from the end of the earth will I
[1:05:20] cry unto thee when my heart is
[1:05:22] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[1:05:25] higher than I but thou has been a
[1:05:28] shelter for me and a strong tower from
[1:05:32] the enemy hallelujah I was telling
[1:05:35] somebody to dance a which crowd for no
[1:05:37] witchcraft my god still is car
[1:05:40] hallelujah I'm not going to call
[1:05:42] something Amen like it's something
[1:05:44] greater than what I got greater is he
[1:05:46] that is in us and he that is in the well
[1:05:48] but if we don't put the prayer we don't
[1:05:50] get the prayer we're turning guarding in
[1:05:53] the moon is that right the pressure on
[1:05:57] Israel in order to escape Egypt they had
[1:06:01] to pray is that right
[1:06:03] God said I have heard the cry of my
[1:06:06] people that right and I have come down
[1:06:09] see when you hear when God hears your
[1:06:11] car God will come down and rescue you he
[1:06:15] is our refuge he is our strength
[1:06:18] he is our deliverer he is all in all
[1:06:22] there's somebody that's the way it is
[1:06:26] yes Lord he's been my strong tower is
[1:06:29] that right proverbs 18:10 said for the
[1:06:32] name of the Lord is a strong tower and
[1:06:34] the righteous run it into it and say
[1:06:37] hallelujah yes I run into the name may
[1:06:42] the name of what Jesus Jesus Christ is
[1:06:45] the only name hallelujah that every
[1:06:48] demon every devil the window
[1:06:51] amen earthquakes stole everything must
[1:06:55] bow to the name of Jesus Christ we don't
[1:06:58] have to fear but you don't you see we
[1:07:00] feel insecure when we're not praying
[1:07:04] we're not connected and therefore we
[1:07:07] feel insecure but brother Branham said
[1:07:09] like this he said the Holy Ghost comes
[1:07:11] to give you a charge hallelujah like a
[1:07:14] battery it comes to give you a charge
[1:07:16] and if you get on your knees if you feel
[1:07:19] weak if you feel weary hallelujah you
[1:07:21] need to plug up hallelujah
[1:07:23] till heaven amen so God can come down
[1:07:26] and give you a charge a little here no

[1:11:30] right he said there is a river the
[1:11:34] streams whereof shall make glad the City
[1:11:36] of God the holy place of the tabernacle
[1:11:39] in the Most High God is in the midst of
[1:11:42] her she shall not be moved
[1:11:44] God shall help her and that right early
[1:11:48] the heathen rages the kingdoms were
[1:11:51] moved he uttered his voice the earth
[1:11:54] melted the Lord of Hosts is with us the
[1:11:57] God of Jacob is our refuge he is mine

[1:12:11] of the lord from the west and its glory
[1:12:14] from the rising of the sun when the
[1:12:16] enemies shall come in like a flood the
[1:12:19] Spirit of the Lord should lift up a
[1:12:20] standard against it that's what God is
[1:12:22] trying to do right now lift up that
[1:12:25] standard how do you lift it up by prayer
[1:12:27] because when you pray your prayers like
[1:12:30] instance it goes up to heaven is that
[1:12:32] right when it reaches heaven God bottles
[1:12:35] it he puts it in the center why cuz he's
[1:12:38] got use for it touch not my auntie huh
[1:12:42] do my prophets no harm hallelujah God
[1:12:45] said it's better for a man to tired and
[1:12:47] they'll storm about his neck and cast
[1:12:49] himself in the sea then to touch one of
[1:12:50] these little ones is that right God
[1:12:53] loves you and God is going to revenge
[1:12:55] avenge us
[1:12:57] of our adversary you know I said Lord
[1:12:59] how do I pray how do I pray he said pray
[1:13:03] like David hallelujah
[1:13:05] then there was a man other God's own
[1:13:07] heart God you see my enemy you know who
[1:13:10] he is
[1:13:11] now we don't wrestle against flesh and
[1:13:13] blood like David did but we rationally
[1:13:15] get spirits and you need to call God as
[1:13:17] God destroy these enemies not people
[1:13:21] destroy the enemy I came battle but I
[1:13:25] can't see hallelujah but God you see it
[1:13:29] all ah break the yolks Lord don't y'all
[1:13:32] believe he can break up I think you know
[1:13:38] if you got faith that God can save your
[1:13:41] whole house he'll save your whole house
[1:13:45] uncles and cousins and everybody else
[1:13:51] God I'm depending on it and you ought to
[1:13:56] see where you're standing you are the
[1:13:59] voice in this last age but the bank said
[1:14:03] the bride of Jesus Christ is the blood
[1:14:05] of Jesus Christ by the Spirit he made us
[1:14:08] priests and kings for win next day know
[1:14:13] now but you apply you get in that
[1:14:17] position on your knees hallelujah don't
[1:14:21] be afraid approaching God that's to say
[1:14:23] that no he didn't call me but I'm going
[1:14:25] I'm desperate I got a situation here I
[1:14:28] done prayed and I had everybody fasting
[1:14:30] and praying now I'm going to see him and
[1:14:32] if I perish let me perish I'm going to
[1:14:35] see the king you have to have that
[1:14:37] attitude does ever say you pray like
[1:14:41] that you're gonna lose my mind that's
[1:14:43] what I'm trying to do I want to lose it
[1:14:45] so I can have here a man and when the
[1:14:51] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:14:53] Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:14:55] standard that's what God told me he said
[1:14:56] I made you that standard and every one
[1:14:59] of you has become that standard now you
[1:15:01] gotta live it the flood is coming you
[1:15:03] know what the flood does a flood moves

[1:15:24] will huh the Bible said this house this
[1:15:30] Kingdom will stand the greatest flood

[1:15:44] that right but the but it wouldn't it
[1:15:47] couldn't it couldn't it couldn't shake

[1:16:06] foundation is jesus christ if you build
[1:16:09] the house up on that rock hallelujah
[1:16:12] well the flood is coming and it is on
[1:16:15] now but if you are the standard for the
[1:16:18] saint you are the real genuine Christian
[1:16:22] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:16:24] hallelujah and jesus never lost a battle

[1:16:38] winner hallelujah and the Redeemer
[1:16:41] she'll come to Zion and unto them that
[1:16:44] turned from the transgressions in Jacob
[1:16:47] said the Lord as for me this is my
[1:16:50] covenant with them said the Lord my
[1:16:52] spirit that is upon thee and my words
[1:16:55] which I have put in that mouth shall not
[1:16:58] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[1:17:00] mouth of that seed nor out of the mouth
[1:17:02] of that CC said the Lord from henceforth
[1:17:05] and forever
[1:17:08] that's your battle just before the wall
[1:17:13] the last wall that's where we are right
[1:17:17] there feasts of the trumpets and
[1:17:19] everything else y'all know how that's
[1:17:20] placed there and we're right there at
[1:17:25] the coming of Moses and Elijah but God
[1:17:28] can't move to the bride gets in her
[1:17:30] proper place that means we got to cut
[1:17:33] off everything die to everything is your
[1:17:36] brother because I don't know how no you
[1:17:37] don't but if you can get the Holy Ghost
[1:17:40] like you all to hear the view the work
[1:17:43] hello
[1:17:44] and I think that's the problem we ain't
[1:17:47] got it like we ought to have
[1:17:52] we're afraid to say it but evidence
[1:17:54] evidence evidence the Bible said you
[1:17:58] know the tree haha by the fruit it bears
[1:18:01] hallelujah some of us don't have fruit
[1:18:05] so we need God we need more of God you
[1:18:09] say are you out of the scriptures no
[1:18:11] because the scripture says that there
[1:18:15] was going to come a day with a wheat and
[1:18:17] the tares what's gonna cry out for the
[1:18:19] rain is that what the Prophet said he
[1:18:21] said they're both be crying out and God
[1:18:24] is gonna send the rain hmm and that rain
[1:18:28] would fall on the wheat and the tale it
[1:18:30] is now but it will he said there be a
[1:18:32] last outpouring you know he said but
[1:18:35] would not let you see one thing about
[1:18:36] rain and can't change the seed it just
[1:18:39] makes it mature it just Germa ties it
[1:18:42] but see for us who are the seed of God
[1:18:45] it will bring us to the level that we
[1:18:47] need to be but let's not wait folks
[1:18:50] let's get before God says lord help me
[1:18:53] increase my prayer life change me O God
[1:18:58] change me and I'm not trying to tell you
[1:19:01] like I love the way my wife teach the
[1:19:03] kids how do you eat an elephant one bite
[1:19:06] at a time that's how you eat an elephant
[1:19:12] one bite at a time
[1:19:13] that's how you possess the land is that
[1:19:16] right jesus said in the Word of God how
[1:19:18] are you gonna possess it little by
[1:19:20] little right if you try to take it all
[1:19:23] at one time you're gonna faint
[1:19:24] little by little take what he gives you
[1:19:29] and move forward hallelujah I feel the
[1:19:35] presence of Lord here tonight I don't
[1:19:37] know what you feel it but I know he's up
[1:19:39] in this book idiot and I know that this
[1:19:41] message came straightly from heaven and
[1:19:43] I trust by God's grace you've been
[1:19:46] blessed because ain't no using us
[1:19:48] worrying what we need to do is pray
[1:19:50] brother Adam said those Hebrew boys did
[1:19:53] not even get an answer from God well he
[1:19:57] said they prayed all night and God never
[1:20:01] answered them but they were so convicted
[1:20:06] they didn't go on the feelings they said
[1:20:11] whatever even if you don't answer me I'm
[1:20:14] not gonna bow
[1:20:16] I don't feel him I'm not going bow
[1:20:20] if I don't hear him I'm not gonna bow
[1:20:22] cuz I know it is his intentions
[1:20:25] hallelujah it must have been a wonder to
[1:20:28] them because the battle was still on and
[1:20:32] they were still trusting God and as they
[1:20:35] were walking forward look like look like
[1:20:37] the fire was becoming more intense but
[1:20:38] they couldn't feel it see what it is
[1:20:40] when you in the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] you don't feel all that stuff it's only
[1:20:44] when you and your carnal mind you get
[1:20:46] the feeling air everything but they were
[1:20:48] so caught up i've been prayed up they
[1:20:51] didn't feel it but those old people
[1:20:53] those old men who were throwing them in
[1:20:55] the fire were dying left and right boom
[1:20:57] boom boom
[1:20:58] hey man and then when they got to a
[1:21:00] certain place they saw him the word
[1:21:02] himself huh that's the way we ought to
[1:21:06] be because the probably God said I meant
[1:21:08] that this this this uh fire in this age
[1:21:12] is heated up seven times more so of what
[1:21:17] they experienced the greatest and most
[1:21:20] evil is age ever and he chose you as a
[1:21:24] standard I'll take it I'll be like David

[1:21:35] this is my confidant and the Holy Ghost
[1:21:39] strike the word yeah
[1:21:40] and tells me you it's gonna be alright
[1:21:42] no weapon faulty we read these
