[25:20] know how
[25:22] Jesus please have mercy upon our souls
[25:26] we cry out Lord Jesus for our
[25:30] theophany Lord we cry out for our
[25:33] glorified body we cry out for the
[25:37] promises that you have made us and we
[25:41] believe with all of our heart that your
[25:43] promises are a blessed a service here
[25:47] tonight in a special way in Jesus
[25:51] Christ's name we pray amen
[25:53] you may be seated just to give a little
[25:58] note of background I like to first
[26:03] entitle this message a mission that is
[26:07] possible a mission that is possible and
[26:14] if I had a theme it would be faith is
[26:19] positive one thing I know about God the
[26:25] Bible says that without faith is
[26:29] impossible to please in faith in itself
[26:33] is a revelation given by God you can't
[26:39] pump yourself up to it you can't
[26:42] psychologically enter into it faith in
[26:46] itself is a birth it's something that is
[26:49] born given to you by a power that we
[26:53] call God
[26:57] when God calls men God gives them faith
[27:03] to believe think about all of the things
[27:07] that Abraham had to contend with
[27:13] perhaps Abraham didn't even know what
[27:15] faith was but when he heard the voice of
[27:19] God and however God talked with him
[27:22] automatically abraham believed
[27:27] understand that belief came from God
[27:31] that's why the Bible said if a man
[27:34] believed that they're there in God or
[27:36] there there's one God say he do it well
[27:39] because even God gives that revelation
[27:43] think about the thing when it comes to
[27:46] Abraham how he was adding a land of
[27:49] child deer where there was nothing but
[27:51] idol-worshipping he had no doubt seen
[27:55] perhaps thousands of God's and everybody
[27:58] claiming that their God was God but it's
[28:03] amazing how God can contact an
[28:05] individual and for some reason they have
[28:09] no proof he's God but they know he is
[28:17] that's how it was with Abraham because
[28:23] when it comes to faith faith it's like
[28:27] possessing of an actual force it's it's
[28:33] it's a being it's something that has an
[28:36] existence even though you can't touch it
[28:39] it exists for an example the Bible said
[28:44] the whole world was created by faith by
[28:46] faith it is a force it is existence in
[28:50] existence and you know the Prophet God
[28:53] said that faith in itself is God now I'm
[28:57] not talking about an intellectual faith
[29:00] I'm talking about a God faith a faith
[29:05] that could only be implanted into you by
[29:09] God
[29:11] when it comes to they think about it it
[29:16] is a force it is something that compels
[29:20] you like it did you know Abraham that
[29:24] called those things that be not as
[29:26] though they were faith is such a
[29:29] powerful force it literally gives you a
[29:32] vision of the reality or the thing that
[29:36] you want from God it becomes so real
[29:40] it's real more real than this natural
[29:44] world because you can't explain it yet
[29:47] you know it exists you know I think
[29:50] about Christopher Columbus how he
[29:53] believed and he don't even know why he
[29:55] believed but you got to understand that
[29:59] God anointed him to believe in something
[30:03] that no one else could see or envision
[30:05] and he knew that there was another land
[30:08] somewhere a man and he traveled by faith
[30:14] didn't have one ounce of proof and
[30:18] because he so believed it God allowed
[30:22] him to come into that land that he
[30:26] believed existed even though he had
[30:29] never seen it before
[30:31] see we believe in something that we've
[30:34] never seen before
[30:36] we know that there is a heaven we know
[30:39] that there's our God we know that there
[30:42] is a throne somewhere and we know by
[30:45] faith huh it's more than words on the
[30:49] page people because faith becomes your
[30:53] life you become it and it becomes you
[30:58] think about it now one thing about this
[31:02] Bible the Bible says faith comes by
[31:05] hearing and hearing the Word of God now
[31:10] it would make you think that you had had
[31:13] to have this written Bible before you
[31:17] can have faith but God is his word
[31:22] and when any man whether you ever be
[31:25] whether you able to read or not faith
[31:27] comes by hearing hearing by the word who
[31:30] is Jesus who is Christ and when Christ
[31:34] speaks you have to obey he said oh come
[31:40] on brother books let me say it like this
[31:41] brother Adam said that when God dealt
[31:44] with Isaac or Eliezer he also dealt with
[31:47] Rebekah he worked on both ends and
[31:52] Eleazar was going to find Isaac away
[31:55] so how did Rebecca know to water the
[32:01] camel and the man it was revealed to her
[32:07] by faith she heard from God hallelujah
[32:15] come on somebody the woman with the
[32:18] issue of blood it wasn't written it
[32:23] wasn't in the scripture but something
[32:25] said to her if you but touch to him and
[32:29] she believed it faith entered into her
[32:33] and she touched the humans calling she
[32:37] was on a mission and it was a faith
[32:39] mission a mission given to her by faith
[32:45] Abraham was on a mission a mission that
[32:49] was given to him by faith because
[32:52] Abraham had never met God before until
[32:58] after he believed and after he started
[33:02] into his journey it was then after the
[33:05] battle he met McKenna Dec he met a man
[33:10] he met a God in the form of a man
[33:15] hallelujah and because he believed when
[33:19] there was nothing to prove it that he
[33:23] existed
[33:24] he now came in contact with the thing
[33:27] that existed hallelujah and when he came
[33:30] in contact
[33:31] amen with the God that was one time
[33:34] invisible
[33:37] he fell down and made him ties and
[33:40] honored him hallelujah sheep that's the
[33:44] kind of a thing think does faith puts
[33:49] you in a mission because you got to
[33:52] understand that the Word of God is on a
[33:55] mission once it left God's mouth once it
[34:00] was spoken the Bible said it goes out
[34:03] and it doesn't return void it goes out
[34:07] and it accomplished everything that was
[34:10] spoken it gathers it up and brings it
[34:14] back to God
[34:15] see that's what faith does amen
[34:19] it is only reason why we're serving God
[34:21] because when he spoke us our names in
[34:26] the book it went out and it's been
[34:30] thousands of years more than we can
[34:33] imagine
[34:33] years how come on before Adam was
[34:39] created as a man on the earth God had
[34:43] already spoken is that right
[34:46] God had already in his mind created
[34:49] everything and he spoke that word and
[34:52] without thousands of years yet now since
[34:57] then and it's still moving it's still
[35:01] gathering it's still collecting because
[35:05] the word is on a mission and it cannot
[35:09] come back boy
[35:11] so that you can understand what I'm
[35:12] trying to say Isaiah prophesied a virgin
[35:17] shall conceive for hundred years I
[35:20] believe a more he meant it God through
[35:24] the mouth of a man spoke that word
[35:27] hallelujah and for hundreds of years
[35:31] it traveled hallelujah generations out
[35:37] the generations it traveled until that
[35:42] virgin what
[35:44] thousands of virgins were born maybe
[35:47] millions of virgins had come and gone
[35:49] but there was only one version that that
[35:53] word saw that fit the description of
[35:58] what it was sent out together hallelujah
[36:01] Hema and then that same fate that same
[36:05] world came along and grabbed Mary hey
[36:09] the thing I love about God is because
[36:12] God already knows your response when she
[36:14] hear the voice hallelujah and even
[36:17] though Mary couldn't scientifically
[36:19] explain because faith cannot be
[36:22] explained could not explain
[36:25] I mean how this thing was going to
[36:27] happen to her
[36:28] seeing that she knew no man she yet said
[36:32] be it unto me according to that word
[36:37] when faith struck that version
[36:40] Isaiah no matter where he was I believe
[36:43] he was shouting praising God amen I told
[36:48] you a virgin shall conceive you think
[36:53] about it now I'm coming down to
[36:55] something here because God has called us
[36:58] to be a bride and right now we are in
[37:02] the midst of Laodicea and God chose you
[37:07] to be here in this wicked age but God
[37:13] requires one thing from us and that's
[37:16] faith you've got to believe this if you
[37:21] don't believe it see you can't
[37:23] scientifically it ain't there for you to
[37:25] break it down and process it no more
[37:28] than it was for Mary she couldn't
[37:30] understand what and how God was going to
[37:32] do it but one thing the angel said unto
[37:35] Mary Mary this thing in you is out the
[37:39] Holy Ghost and it will bring it to pass
[37:43] see it's God in you bringing his word to
[37:47] pass you can't figure it out but he
[37:51] don't want negative thoughts from you he
[37:54] don't want or I don't know how I'm gonna
[37:56] make it he just does
[37:58] not wolf oh my I'm you know I didn't
[38:01] know a lot of things and sometimes I
[38:03] don't know and sometimes we speak things
[38:05] that we shouldn't speak I'm a reader
[38:07] caught in just a moment but God don't
[38:09] need you to say I'm a weak God don't
[38:13] need us to say you know any negative
[38:16] thing out of our mouth regardless to
[38:21] what it appears to be Abraham you mean
[38:24] to tell me you're gonna have a son you
[38:26] better believe it
[38:27] how come God said so I'm on a mission to
[38:32] prove that God's Word is truth
[38:35] hallelujah I know the mission you know
[38:38] the mission that God's Word is true and
[38:41] it cannot come back for it I don't care
[38:43] what it looks like if God can take a
[38:46] horse a hold on that was rored without
[38:49] shake hallelujah top is covered a deep
[38:52] hallelujah if God can said let there be
[38:55] light and light came to this planet like
[38:59] and come to this planet life can come to
[39:02] you God is powerful more powerful he can
[39:05] separate the darkness from the light
[39:07] hallelujah by the word of God he
[39:10] separates the darkness from the light in
[39:13] you by way of preaching hallelujah
[39:21] wherefore come out from among them he
[39:24] said God I can't do it God said you can
[39:27] hallelujah
[39:28] let go and let God have his way I was
[39:31] talking to a brother today
[39:33] you know the trouble with us we don't
[39:36] want to suffer we don't like it
[39:39] nobody likes suffering I don't like
[39:42] suffering but I think God forward
[39:44] because I know through this suffering I
[39:47] am being made perfect it is through his
[39:52] chest eyes meant that I know that I am a
[39:55] son I want him to correct me I may not
[39:59] like it but I know he's my father and I
[40:02] know my father will do exactly what is
[40:05] best for me y'all understand me how many
[40:09] y'all enjoy a whipping
[40:12] now thank your mama thank you daddy I
[40:15] appreciate it
[40:16] oh the pain covers all the appreciation
[40:20] it's after the beating you realize that
[40:23] he did it for you good and that is after
[40:26] you mature and understand why daddy
[40:30] spanked you oh my god that's how he is
[40:35] hey he's a better father than my natural
[40:38] father could have ever been is this okay
[40:41] see we must understand by God's grace we
[40:44] are on a mission and this mission is
[40:47] possible and I want to say it's a power
[40:54] how can I say it if the Word of God says
[40:58] that you and I are more than conquerors
[41:01] we're more than conquerors I don't care
[41:05] if you fail seven times in the day fall
[41:07] seven times in a day the Bible says a
[41:09] just man when he falls if he falls seven
[41:13] times in a day he gets up she is not
[41:17] even in our DNA to stay down you can't
[41:22] cry because faith the word says are you
[41:26] going to get up anything about you and
[41:29] me is about him it's about defeating
[41:32] Satan in his own Edom and you and I
[41:35] could have never done it the man is a
[41:38] mastermind God then garden is not
[41:41] babbling some chump hallelujah he fixed
[41:46] the the right thing peasant as an enemy
[41:49] but he wanted to show his enemy that
[41:52] he's still God God fights you know in a
[41:59] fair way you know God could have
[42:02] dispelled Lucifer even in the beginning
[42:05] before time he could have got rid of him
[42:08] but that was his opportunity so God did
[42:12] what he formed the creation and put
[42:14] himself in their creation and whoop the
[42:15] devil you hear what I'm saying and if
[42:21] God came into Jesus and defeated the
[42:25] even in hell he can defeat the devil in
[42:28] laodicea huh you are God weapon trained
[42:33] you and I've meet you and me we are gods
[42:37] amen we are the Angels that stood in
[42:40] that day and as we stood in that day we
[42:44] will and will and will stand in this day
[42:48] there is no defeating us say to know it
[42:52] and you need to you and I need to say
[42:55] okay I cannot be defeated hallelujah
[43:03] because Christ lives in me is that right
[43:08] oh he thought see God has shown us so
[43:10] many time
[43:11] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right when
[43:14] the when it looks like God was being
[43:16] defeated what happens he steps into the
[43:20] furnace is that right when Daniels
[43:23] looked like he was being defeated it
[43:25] looked like the devil was defeated
[43:26] what happened God steps in the picture
[43:29] so you gotta understand when the devil
[43:31] look like he's defeating you don't you
[43:33] worry is in the book God will always
[43:37] step in the picture he sets you up hello
[43:46] he set you up god yes he does
[43:53] he wants you to see how mighty of a
[43:57] warrior he is and he was your enemy to
[44:01] see how mighty of a warrior he is he
[44:06] said I got bad habits brother Bruce I've
[44:07] had him for a long time God before you
[44:10] knew him allowed those bad habits to be
[44:14] implanted in you oh god I didn't matter
[44:19] that no better I would have never chosen
[44:21] that it wasn't your choice in the
[44:25] beginning God allowed it to be if you
[44:28] have been a drunk of God saw you as a
[44:30] drunk if you have been a crackhead God
[44:32] saw you as a crackhead whatever you are
[44:35] but guess what
[44:37] before all of that
[44:39] he put his seed in you and me before the
[44:42] foundation of the world because he knew
[44:45] that God seed could defeat any darkness
[44:47] oh yeah oh oh a true seed of God can
[44:53] never be held down can never be stopped
[44:57] hallelujah is that all right in mark
[45:00] 9:23 jesus says unto him if thou can't
[45:03] believe all things are possible to them
[45:06] that believe it not just believe what
[45:09] continue to believe Oh Lord
[45:12] God I can't Holly wait to the storm over
[45:15] don't worry about how long the stormy
[45:17] you just have faith in God faith don't
[45:23] need proof our faith do not need proof
[45:30] if God said with the stripes you heal I
[45:33] am healed I don't need proof I don't
[45:38] need sighs but these signs will follow
[45:41] them they believe if you could just grab
[45:44] it and says it's mine
[45:47] it never quit you know it's a force this
[45:52] is the thing that will make everything
[45:54] come into your play will make everything
[45:57] humble yourself humble itself to you
[45:59] yeah at the name of Jesus every knee
[46:03] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[46:05] that he is Lord to the glory of who the
[46:09] Father and what is your name you bear
[46:13] the same name of your husband
[46:16] so everything as long as you in Christ
[46:20] everything I don't care what it looks
[46:22] like everything if you hold the faith to
[46:26] believe that is working towards your
[46:28] good it has to come down and bow itself
[46:31] to you it's really bowing itself to the
[46:35] name of Jesus Christ but he gave you
[46:37] that name heaven and earth bears that
[46:40] name we have no other Authority we have
[46:44] no other authority other than the name
[46:46] of Jesus Christ we don't come in our
[46:49] name we go in his name God cuz every
[46:53] principality must bow itself to that
[46:57] name Christ is the mystery he said but
[47:02] the thing of it is you're not saved
[47:05] about your organization by your
[47:08] denomination you're saved by your own
[47:11] personal faith in Jesus Christ
[47:13] that's all so it's between you and
[47:15] Christ alone you so you seek out the
[47:20] scripture and believe him with all your
[47:22] heart and he'll save you or heal you and
[47:26] if he doesn't keep his word than he
[47:28] isn't God and if he does keep his word
[47:30] it proves he's God
[47:32] so we believe him with all of our hearts
[47:40] hallelujah it ain't no ifs in it
[47:44] hallelujah oh I'm coming in just a
[47:46] minute I'm not gonna be long but listen
[47:49] think about it how difficult it would be
[47:53] if we had to save ourselves first of all
[47:58] we could never do it fallen man could
[48:02] never do it that's why God had to create
[48:05] a man who could do it
[48:09] hallelujah there was no angel holy
[48:12] enough to do it there was no Seraphim
[48:15] holy enough to do it the Holies of
[48:19] Holies had to come down to do it and
[48:21] that was God himself he was the only one
[48:25] that can literally free mankind
[48:28] hallelujah so let me put it this way he
[48:31] is the only one that could save you and
[48:34] he's the only one that can condemn you
[48:39] no one else can condemn you
[48:41] Paul says who just separate us from the
[48:45] love of God hmm even the Word of God
[48:49] says what weapon formed against you
[48:51] shall prosper see there is nobody that
[48:54] could stand against you in the judgement
[48:58] if God has justified you if God has
[49:02] called your holy no man there is no
[49:05] evidence and then that any man not even
[49:08] Lucifer his blood alone I love this oh I
[49:17] got so much in that blood I'm not even
[49:20] finished preaching at you I see things
[49:23] about that more so than I ever have in
[49:25] my entire save life but the man says
[49:29] dear God we are grateful to you tonight
[49:32] for the privilege of knowing Jesus
[49:34] Christ our Savior your son in the free
[49:38] pardoning of our sins and to know that
[49:41] his blood is sufficient that covers all
[49:45] of our sins and our iniquities they're
[49:49] so blotted out and put in the sea of
[49:52] forgiveness and his bride was staying at
[49:55] a wedding supper pure of the
[49:58] unadulterated to marry the son of God
[50:01] how we thank thee for this all
[50:04] sufficiency and the faith to know that
[50:08] we do not trust in our own merits but in
[50:12] his merits alone for what he did for us
[50:16] we are so grateful see you la if you
[50:24] trust in any merit of your own you still
[50:27] lost remember the parable lord have we
[50:31] not cast out devils in your name have we
[50:35] not been this debt in the other that was
[50:37] the problem because once you know Jesus
[50:41] you know it's no longer I he is a one
[50:45] that's doing it all so when you go
[50:48] before him with I he says no no no no we
[50:51] never knew you I never knew you you're
[50:55] not the eye on the eye right if you
[51:01] really know God you must come to
[51:03] understand everything we do it is by the
[51:07] power of the Holy Spirit and all glory
[51:11] goes to God hallelujah is that all right
[51:14] folks now coming in just a minute
[51:17] because
[51:18] you really love God you do everything
[51:22] you possibly can do to live according to
[51:25] his standard hallelujah
[51:28] hello everything and you must understand
[51:34] only God can do it if you live by your
[51:38] own methods if you live by your own
[51:41] practices hallelujah you see what I'm
[51:45] saying you delivered Oh God I overcame
[51:48] cigarettes did you really do it or did
[51:51] he do it for you see when God takes it
[51:54] from you then it is God who gets the
[51:57] glory but when it becomes human effort
[52:00] that's all it is
[52:01] Oh hallelujah
[52:05] yeah maybe I'm wrong but I have come to
[52:07] realize that there have been many times
[52:09] I overcame things by human effort and
[52:12] down the road I fell back into it
[52:14] because it was human effort but when God
[52:17] takes it he takes the wheel he takes the
[52:21] desire he takes every piece of that
[52:24] darkness and cast it out hallelujah is
[52:28] that right that's my James James talk
[52:31] about it when you're double minded that
[52:33] means you still got darkness in you a
[52:35] real Sun and throne of God when that
[52:38] Bible when that world comes into you and
[52:41] then they clean up the house like
[52:44] brother Branham said he said that cosmic
[52:46] light is pushed out and that eternal
[52:50] light takes over that's what we want we
[52:54] want God to separate the darkness from
[52:57] the light just like he did in it and
[53:00] even he took the that he's separated who
[53:03] did it that voice that's why people they
[53:06] don't come to church and they find
[53:08] themselves stealing darkness because
[53:10] it's by the preaching of the word that
[53:13] God speaks and then that word bring
[53:15] conviction and then God comes alone when
[53:18] the person is ready to repent though and
[53:21] he takes away the darkness and brings in
[53:26] the light is that right because Jesus
[53:30] said I don't have no darkness in me
[53:32] boom so we must become like him we must
[53:37] get to the place where there is no
[53:38] darkness you know I was telling somebody
[53:41] that what brother Brooks brother you
[53:44] can't even do what I'm talking about
[53:45] none of us has the ability to do it can
[53:48] any man add a static cubit to a statue
[53:50] the Bible says no you know how you get
[53:53] that done on your knees pray mmm and
[53:58] understand because you pray that don't
[54:00] save you you say by the grace of God but
[54:05] when you pray hallelujah
[54:09] right when you pray God hears the heart
[54:12] he knows how to the Bundys of the heart
[54:14] the mouth speaketh hallelujah and you
[54:18] cry out before God because you don't
[54:19] want to be like this because you know
[54:21] you have fallen creature and you're just
[54:23] trying to get back home hallelujah whoo
[54:25] I want that hole in this I wants new
[54:29] Lord I don't remember it but I want that
[54:31] hole in this I once had hallelujah Oh
[54:36] glory to God
[54:38] whoo Jesus help us Lord Mark 1436 says
[54:47] and I'm trying to put something in you
[54:49] tonight so that you know that all things
[54:52] are possible all things are possible to
[54:55] them that believe but you must believe
[54:58] you must believe your bride even if
[55:02] there is no proof that you are hey
[55:09] somebody should've shouted even if you
[55:13] don't bill
[55:14] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is a
[55:16] desperate had no idea she was gonna be
[55:18] queen but she was elected and chosen and
[55:23] guess what the word pushed her in
[55:25] position huh the word will push you in
[55:29] position
[55:30] it will bring you to the place that God
[55:33] saw you in a you is God he said God
[55:39] won't do that yes he will and it always
[55:42] never always easy Jesus had
[55:45] be born in Bethlehem God raised the
[55:48] taxes and told everybody you got to go
[55:52] back to your old Providence hallelujah
[55:55] and God could care less I won't put it
[55:58] that way left put it this way God saw
[56:01] that Mary was pregnant he could have
[56:03] took Mary on that journey a few months
[56:06] earlier but he took on that journey
[56:08] because he knew by the time she got
[56:11] there it would be on the right date of
[56:14] the right month that lambs are born and
[56:18] God in his mind said it so they had no
[56:22] idea what God was doing God didn't tell
[56:26] Mary when Jesus was gonna be born the
[56:29] only thing he told her is that when he
[56:31] is born his name would be Jesus
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:36] let me tell you something God I put you
[56:38] on a rough road before you get a real
[56:41] birth of the Holy Ghost hallelujah but
[56:43] at the end of the day you'll be so glad
[56:46] whoo God is gonna take you there because
[56:50] the Bible says so now I'm telling you I
[56:53] could never be curse can you ever
[56:56] because know the Bible according the
[56:59] book of Revelation said blessed is the
[57:01] man who hear it the which the sayings of
[57:03] this book we read at the site
[57:06] y'all I'm blessed and who God is best
[57:09] know making course ever Cain curse you I
[57:13] don't care what sickness that devil
[57:16] cannot cost you and if there is a
[57:18] sickness you must realize God is
[57:20] allowing it but do you want to hear you
[57:22] say thank you praise God in every
[57:27] situation thank you Jesus
[57:29] oh the devil say you've done evil that's
[57:31] why oh but thank you Jesus
[57:34] if I'm being chastised thank you Jesus
[57:37] if it's just a prank character thank you
[57:40] Jesus because Lord you the master of it
[57:43] all and I know I'm on a mission now that
[57:49] okay this is a funny thing
[57:54] my daughter had some medication and I
[57:56] don't know why she had it in mind
[57:59] Am I my bathroom my cabinet and her peel
[58:04] looked just like mine and I didn't even
[58:06] think to read it because all the
[58:08] medicine was in my bathroom and I wasn't
[58:12] certain white whether I took her
[58:13] medicine or not but I did take some of
[58:15] mine the heart for high blood pressure
[58:18] and I got in in their kitchen and
[58:22] started eating something and all of a
[58:23] sudden I got so sick whoo I ran to the
[58:26] bathroom in whatever was supposed to be
[58:29] there came up you understand what I'm
[58:31] saying God could have really let allowed
[58:34] this thing to affect me in a sense
[58:35] because it was serious stuff could allow
[58:38] that thing to affect me but you know
[58:40] what God did he told my body that ain't
[58:42] here
[58:43] that's not he it's him not really and my
[58:47] wife brought it to my attention say
[58:48] thank the Lord for bringing whatever
[58:50] that was you see in all things give
[58:54] things that's what God is looking for
[58:57] everything must remain positive y'all
[59:01] hear me somebody steal my car thank you
[59:04] Jesus
[59:05] hallelujah so whatever comes it must be
[59:09] positive because you can see the devil
[59:11] wants you to complain that's what got
[59:15] the children Israel in wilderness
[59:17] murmuring and complaining you get the
[59:19] devil in this time God don't look for he
[59:22] don't want a nagging and complaining why
[59:24] he will somebody that's submissive
[59:28] hallelujah and that's what God is
[59:30] required
[59:30] have you been guilty yes but the word
[59:34] comes to correct the word comes to set
[59:37] us free and all I could ask God to do is
[59:40] keep me along
[59:41] you were the keeper of the soul it's
[59:44] just okay hallelujah listen God requires
[59:50] us to receive car requires us to give up
[59:52] everything you cannot allow one little
[59:55] thing of this world to remain everything
[59:59] must go and many of us don't even know
[1:00:02] how to get rid of it don't worry Abraham
[1:00:05] was the same way he didn't know how to
[1:00:07] get rid of lot then god forced the issue
[1:00:12] Clark all the deters disturbance
[1:00:17] churches had a fall out but it was God's
[1:00:22] doing because the Bible said act like
[1:00:25] Abraham got rid of lot that's when the
[1:00:28] promise was made clear see as long as we
[1:00:32] hanging on to lot car came make it clear
[1:00:35] to you gotta separate is that right
[1:00:37] separate yourself from all the things of
[1:00:40] the world
[1:00:42] now when Jesus heard these things Luke
[1:00:45] 18 22 through 30 he said to them yet
[1:00:49] like it's now one thing sell all that
[1:00:52] thou had and distribute it unto the poor
[1:00:54] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:00:57] and come follow me and when he heard
[1:01:00] this he was very sorrowful for he was
[1:01:04] very rich one of the things I want you
[1:01:07] to understand is is that when the word
[1:01:09] of God comes to you and you feel
[1:01:11] sorrowful that is not a good thing to
[1:01:16] have because when you feeling sorrowful
[1:01:19] more than like you're not going to give
[1:01:22] it up my TV do you realize how much it
[1:01:31] cost it's the truth they get sorrowful
[1:01:36] cuz they can't give it up the devil
[1:01:42] gives you every reason why not to give
[1:01:43] it up I'm just using that as a scenario
[1:01:47] folks but my point is it could be
[1:01:49] anything if I get rid of it I'm gonna be
[1:01:52] bored where Jesus where is Jesus that's
[1:01:58] what that brother said you know I know
[1:01:59] I'm supposed to pray brother but I I
[1:02:00] just don't have nothing making me pray
[1:02:03] why should anything make you pray there
[1:02:07] should not be anything to make you pray
[1:02:08] you shouldn't have to be made to pray I
[1:02:12] totally say you know how God showed me
[1:02:14] about prayer I said listen you have a
[1:02:16] best friend you never get tired of
[1:02:18] talking with them you talk hours on the
[1:02:20] phone
[1:02:21] you'll call him he'll call you right I
[1:02:24] said
[1:02:26] is is talking to car if you knew him as
[1:02:29] a friend you could talk to him but a lot
[1:02:32] of people don't know him as a friend and
[1:02:34] think about the times we spend yanking
[1:02:37] our yakking and yakking with each other
[1:02:39] amen and then you very you hardly ever
[1:02:41] give God fellowship in conversation and
[1:02:44] that's what what Kaveri was all about
[1:02:47] Calvary restored fellowship sonship
[1:02:53] always remained fellowship is what God
[1:02:57] wanted and that's what the blood of
[1:03:00] Jesus Christ is all about that's what
[1:03:02] the Holy Ghost is all about fellowship
[1:03:05] and what we call communion
[1:03:08] communion is not here on the sunny yeah
[1:03:11] that's just symbolic but communion is
[1:03:14] supposed to be every day all day but you
[1:03:18] know what communion means one the bottom
[1:03:22] line of communion is one one bread one
[1:03:26] wine one body one spirit one church I
[1:03:32] don't care how you slice it it's still
[1:03:36] what mmm is that right
[1:03:40] what was the vision now you understand
[1:03:43] now the prayer of Jesus Christ cannot
[1:03:45] come back boy he said father I would
[1:03:48] they be one even as we are one
[1:03:52] hello is that right so let me say like
[1:03:56] this Jesus at Lazarus tomb says father I
[1:03:58] know that thou always here is my prayer
[1:04:02] huh he said Lord the only thing I ever
[1:04:06] requests of you in all of this victory
[1:04:09] is that they be with me wherever I am
[1:04:16] somebody help me just like you may have
[1:04:18] heard me say there's a difference
[1:04:20] between being in the kingdom of God is
[1:04:24] that right and the kingdom of heaven
[1:04:27] everybody who claim to be Christians are
[1:04:29] in the kingdom of heaven but there's
[1:04:31] only a selected group that's in the
[1:04:34] kingdom of God and everyone that's in
[1:04:36] the kingdom of God will be
[1:04:39] in the New Jerusalem but people who are
[1:04:41] in the kingdom of heaven there will be
[1:04:43] servants they'll be out of the city
[1:04:46] though they be saved feel like shouting
[1:04:53] John denied so you and I must realize by
[1:04:56] the grace of God this mission this
[1:04:58] purpose it cannot come back void if
[1:05:06] nobody believes you Brian
[1:05:08] you gotta believe it what evidence you
[1:05:10] have oh my god is that something is
[1:05:13] telling me that I am faith is what I
[1:05:17] have I'm gonna believe that just like I
[1:05:20] told her brother the other day I said
[1:05:21] the only person they could ever tell me
[1:05:23] and show me I'm not right is Jesus
[1:05:25] Christ himself nobody else trials come
[1:05:29] in they're coming first pressure is
[1:05:32] coming and it's coming persecution is
[1:05:34] coming and it's coming and when it does
[1:05:37] will anybody anything be able to
[1:05:39] separate you from the love of God
[1:05:41] absolutely not hallelujah amen Peter was
[1:05:46] so excited about leaving this land he
[1:05:49] said crucify me upside down is that
[1:05:52] right I don't think about this force
[1:05:54] this faith amen that force Paul RuPaul
[1:05:58] amen to say listen don't don't kill me
[1:06:02] now don't even set me free he told me
[1:06:05] that I had to go before the Emperor hmm
[1:06:11] I know Nero's waiting and I'm waiting on
[1:06:14] Nero you see it is a force it is a power
[1:06:19] it is God in you that makes you believe
[1:06:24] everything this book says do I
[1:06:28] understand at all absolutely not
[1:06:31] when the Bible said that the whole Holy
[1:06:33] Spirit picked up Ezekiel by the hairs of
[1:06:37] his head and carried into him into the
[1:06:39] heavens I don't understand that but I
[1:06:42] believe that's exactly what happened
[1:06:48] whoa you say well what do you mean what
[1:06:51] I'm trying to tell you now
[1:06:52] the power of God will make you live
[1:06:55] right it's going to force the issue it's
[1:06:58] not going to allow you to allow sin to
[1:07:01] continue in sin cannot reign in this
[1:07:04] mortal body the Holy Spirit is to reign
[1:07:07] in this body y'all hear me and if God is
[1:07:10] in you he's gonna force the issue when
[1:07:12] everybody else is gonna have peace
[1:07:15] he's not gonna allow you to have it till
[1:07:19] you deal with it it's just okay but
[1:07:23] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:07:26] him for he that comes to God must
[1:07:29] believe that he is God is any ideas or
[1:07:31] reward of them that did you seek Him now
[1:07:34] I think about this Hebrew boys brother
[1:07:36] met him said they prayed all night and
[1:07:37] then they have a breakthrough go I gotta
[1:07:40] have a breakthrough no God put you there
[1:07:43] God every battle that ever came against
[1:07:48] you God was in the midst of it he did it
[1:07:50] and he know that the challenge was would
[1:07:54] be great but he knew also that you would
[1:07:57] come out as a victory the victory he
[1:08:01] knew that was in you come on somebody
[1:08:03] now think about it God didn't say who
[1:08:06] you know I wonder will job really you
[1:08:09] know I don't know whether Joel would
[1:08:15] know God knew the outcome God knew that
[1:08:20] Joel was a man that he that could stand
[1:08:25] the test why would he say this man loves
[1:08:28] me ha and realize that love is the
[1:08:33] greatest force Allah because God is love
[1:08:37] Oh Lord I'm trying to love this brother
[1:08:40] you need a baptism of love you need to
[1:08:43] love the God that he is love to in Tony
[1:08:46] and that's what John said John said we
[1:08:49] don't need to teach you how to love God
[1:08:51] is love hallelujah what do you think
[1:08:54] we're fighting for with Tom on taking
[1:08:57] the land all of the hint I stammered
[1:09:00] eyes the Debbie's eyes all of the way in
[1:09:03] the land and we're fighting amen
[1:09:06] to cross over into divine law it's a
[1:09:12] battle it ain't just freely given to you
[1:09:14] but the Word of God said wherever you
[1:09:17] set your feet hey you can possess the
[1:09:22] land you and I are possessors of the
[1:09:25] land and don't you know if you stay in
[1:09:30] the will of God you will have total
[1:09:31] victory victory after victory it was
[1:09:35] when a can see it Israel began to lose
[1:09:38] the battle but as long as the a came is
[1:09:41] not there as long as a piece of the
[1:09:43] world is gone nothing is hindering you
[1:09:45] you win every battle no matter how long
[1:09:50] it take and if you being the same having
[1:09:52] the same God in you that Joshua has all
[1:09:55] you got to do is say son stand still I'm
[1:09:59] gonna whip this battle the devil is not
[1:10:01] gonna get victory over me I'm gonna win
[1:10:03] this battle keep the light coming law
[1:10:05] keep the revelation flooring on keep the
[1:10:08] power flowing hallelujah
[1:10:11] until I whipped the devil and make my
[1:10:13] enemy my footstool whoo God a brother
[1:10:20] shared this scripture with me today
[1:10:23] let's go to Colossians 3 please without
[1:10:28] faith it's impossible to please him for
[1:10:30] he that come to God must believe that he
[1:10:32] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:10:34] that diligently seek Him are you seeking
[1:10:36] Him are you seeking him that's him the
[1:10:40] divine nature is God did you understood
[1:10:44] I was telling us there you know when I
[1:10:46] was in Arizona I didn't preach but I was
[1:10:47] just sharing don't you understand the
[1:10:50] divine nature of that we talked about
[1:10:53] Paul says entering into the divine
[1:10:54] nature jesus said I am the vine you are
[1:10:57] the branches that the nature that flows
[1:11:00] through that is that as long as you
[1:11:03] connect it it's going to flow through
[1:11:04] you it's going to flow through you you
[1:11:07] will produce fruit it ain't him or not
[1:11:10] you will as long as the life of God is
[1:11:13] flowing through you you will produce the
[1:11:16] fruits of the spirit
[1:11:18] it has to happen that's the law whoo
[1:11:23] y'all don't understand but I feel like
[1:11:25] shouting see because I realize Amen that
[1:11:28] even in my shortcomings when I fail you
[1:11:33] know God just don't allow me oh my god
[1:11:36] I'm gonna hell don't even come to my my
[1:11:39] you know what comes to my mind

[1:11:46] spirit of repentance give me a true
[1:11:53] spirit of repentance don't let me
[1:11:55] continue repeating this over and over
[1:11:57] and over again no no no no no give me a
[1:11:59] to fear to repentance so that inter
[1:12:01] please you and you can get rid of this
[1:12:03] you can come down and let that light
[1:12:05] shine and get all of this nasty stuff
[1:12:08] out of me I'm not the only one that
[1:12:11] deals with it you can trust it if you
[1:12:19] wanna he'll show up and show out he will
[1:12:26] that's what flesh is for he's the devil
[1:12:30] that's that serpent part of you you
[1:12:33] didn't know that that's that serpent
[1:12:35] part of you and people say it didn't
[1:12:37] happen it did I'm living proof of it so
[1:12:40] are you
[1:12:41] you say what do you mean why because
[1:12:44] your greatest battle in this flesh is
[1:12:48] sexual because that's how I started
[1:12:57] so it in anyway Colossians 3 you know
[1:13:03] you don't have people don't have
[1:13:04] technology because I know it's true only
[1:13:09] really you can be a monk and you go have
[1:13:12] battles up there even when there's not a
[1:13:14] woman in sight oh yeah you said even the
[1:13:20] prophet of God had battles he put a
[1:13:22] cross in front of his car because he had
[1:13:24] battles that certain part was being you
[1:13:26] know but God getting rid of the serpent
[1:13:28] brothers sisters and then there is no
[1:13:31] sister Piper God is getting rid of the
[1:13:33] bird he's getting rid of the serpent
[1:13:35] giving us a real body
[1:13:37] we won't have to worry about him again
[1:13:41] I'm so happy about it if he then be
[1:13:44] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:13:46] which are above hmm where God sitteth on
[1:13:51] the right hand of God what think about
[1:13:54] that scripture seek those things that
[1:13:57] are above where God so let's go to
[1:14:00] heaven for just a moment the Bible says
[1:14:04] no unclean thing nothing that makes a
[1:14:06] lie
[1:14:07] nothing Amen that they will defiled
[1:14:10] that's what's up there all that's there
[1:14:13] is the virtues of God clean and holy and
[1:14:16] righteous and pure and all of these
[1:14:18] things I thought about said think on
[1:14:19] these things whatsoever is good
[1:14:21] whatsoever thing is lovely what
[1:14:22] everything is pure these are the things
[1:14:24] we're supposed to think on why because
[1:14:26] that those kind of thoughts puts us in
[1:14:29] heavenly places is that right set your
[1:14:33] affection on things above and not on the
[1:14:36] earth but if you've never been above
[1:14:38] what is it that you're going to set your
[1:14:40] affection on my affection God give me
[1:14:46] temperance your temperance patience your
[1:14:49] patience see those are the things that
[1:14:52] are above Lord most of all Lord I want
[1:14:55] to be crowned with your divine love
[1:14:57] listen this marriage will not be Mitch
[1:15:00] mix-matched bone of his bone flesh of
[1:15:04] his flesh whatever he is the Bible said
[1:15:07] whatever he is in heaven we are it on
[1:15:10] is that the way the mom said that we're
[1:15:13] here on earth so we got to understand
[1:15:16] that now this is not him
[1:15:17] this fresh is not him but the enemy the
[1:15:25] enemy the one who's been born again
[1:15:28] that's him
[1:15:29] and this child that's born in use of the
[1:15:33] Holy Ghost but understand it wants to
[1:15:35] grow into a mature man and I was going
[1:15:39] to go if you're not reading or praying
[1:15:41] and studying brother branham said the
[1:15:43] Holy Ghost feeds off the word fees he
[1:15:48] you feeding the Holy Ghost you use
[1:15:53] somebody for your dad in your life is
[1:15:57] hid we're with Christ in God old now the
[1:16:01] devil man with you he just told you just
[1:16:06] told you something your life is here and
[1:16:10] see the devil be attacking this flesh
[1:16:13] thing and he's attacking you but this
[1:16:16] flesh is dead yes right brother
[1:16:17] is that right it is dead it's condemned
[1:16:21] it's dead
[1:16:22] the real you is on the inside and that
[1:16:24] part of you was hid well in Christ and
[1:16:28] who is Christ God in spirit that's the
[1:16:32] blood that's the token that's the life
[1:16:35] and my life is here so you said what do
[1:16:38] you mean brother Brooks really you must
[1:16:40] understand that the only life that
[1:16:42] really counts with God is Jesus Christ
[1:16:44] as himself that's why you in him hidden
[1:16:46] that's the only way you can be accepted
[1:16:48] is to be in him we are accepted we're in
[1:16:51] the beloved so god don't see you if
[1:16:56] you're in Christ that's all he sees is
[1:16:58] Christ that's why you can be so
[1:17:01] justified as though you've never seen in
[1:17:03] the first place now I'm taking it to
[1:17:05] this level but you got to understand
[1:17:08] there's a true man of God or a sister of
[1:17:11] God amen if you're a true one your
[1:17:13] ambition is to please him every day to
[1:17:16] live as holy as your pop why because the
[1:17:18] Holy Ghost wants you to live that way
[1:17:22] anything dirt
[1:17:24] you confess you may cry why because you
[1:17:27] inside your true nature right is holy
[1:17:32] hmm he's like plunging a dove into mud
[1:17:36] oh but God protects us folks don't you
[1:17:43] realize if there was not a blood veil
[1:17:45] around the earth even your prophet would
[1:17:47] have died he wouldn't have made Kyle
[1:17:50] even him he thought he was all right you
[1:17:52] know naturally right there's a time he
[1:17:56] thought he was a god he didn't need a
[1:17:58] guy you gotta say yes you are yes you do
[1:18:01] I'm gonna show you your prophet and I'm
[1:18:03] allowing you to get lost
[1:18:04] so that you know that you need a guide
[1:18:07] without me you're nothing
[1:18:09] oh you gonna judge somebody come on
[1:18:14] behind the door and we'll show you what
[1:18:17] you need to stay humble why you need to
[1:18:19] show yourself in a place of humility

[1:18:44] representation there that lady got on
[1:18:47] the floor with her purple hair purple

[1:21:08] truth then sometime the devil well you
[1:21:13] know let me tell you what let me say
[1:21:15] like this sometimes and I it's the truth
[1:21:16] we'll find ourselves having more mercy
[1:21:18] and grace than God huh we want to have
[1:21:24] more pity we want to repent you can't
[1:21:26] say nobody ooh
[1:21:30] but what happens when a man or a woman
[1:21:33] died and you didn't tell them the truth
[1:21:36] don't tell me I've experienced it I
[1:21:39] almost told them the truth
[1:21:44] but I was so afraid they might not like
[1:21:47] it or may not like me
[1:21:49] and I still have that on my heart and my
[1:21:51] conscience because they died without
[1:21:54] knowing the truth and I had the truth
[1:21:59] horrible experience that will never
[1:22:02] leave you

[1:22:42] into the dinners office he told him
[1:22:44] about Jesus and I tried my best to tell
[1:22:47] people about Jesus now when they shut me
[1:22:50] off they shut me off it ain't my fault
[1:22:52] now but I'm gonna tell him I want the
[1:22:57] doctor to know I'm a Christian cuz I
[1:22:59] know he gonna think I'm crazy

[1:23:36] all these anger what wrath malice
[1:23:41] blasphemy filthy communication out of
[1:23:44] your mouth lie not one to another seeing
[1:23:49] that you have put off the old man with
[1:23:52] his deeds thought this was good and have
[1:23:55] put on what the new man which is renewed
[1:23:58] hello
[1:24:00] renew
[1:24:01] in the knowledge after the image of him
[1:24:04] that created him where there is neither
[1:24:07] Greek nor Jew circumcision or
[1:24:09] uncircumcision barbarian Scythian bond
[1:24:13] nor free but Christ is in all and in all
[1:24:20] we listen the real Holy Ghost has no
[1:24:24] problems changing you or me or you and I
[1:24:28] whichever way is right the point is God
[1:24:34] can do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:24:38] whatsoever we ask or think
[1:24:42] but like I said you got to believe it
[1:24:45] and one of the things that Satan always
[1:24:49] get us with is unbelief and it's true
[1:24:57] y'all know it works and I remember
[1:24:59] sometimes we could have greater faith
[1:25:01] for others that we can have for
[1:25:03] ourselves why is that oh I know God's
[1:25:08] gonna heal her I know God's gonna heal
[1:25:10] him but when it comes to us you know
[1:25:12] with the deficit say you ain't worthy
[1:25:14] for it and you just did this and that
[1:25:18] get up out of here you got to remember
[1:25:21] that the Bible says it all let's put
[1:25:23] away the message of this hour said we
[1:25:25] have been justified as though we've
[1:25:28] never done it in the first place so in
[1:25:30] the eyes of God I am in a place to
[1:25:33] receive whatever God says is for me it's
[1:25:40] given to you it is given you don't work
[1:25:45] for it it's given don't listen to the
[1:25:55] message law is I think it's 1955 so
[1:25:57] warning very powerful message
[1:26:00] it's just law l8w law powerful message
[1:26:06] whoo let us drop you're struggling a lot
[1:26:11] of times people we struggle blowing
[1:26:14] grace law in Greece or in Greece you
[1:26:16] know condemns us oh you didn't do this
[1:26:19] you didn't do that
[1:26:20] hello that little boy with the two fish
[1:26:22] and loaves of bread that's all he did to
[1:26:24] further all his life and God I counted
[1:26:26] it as holiness or righteousness winning
[1:26:30] the witan went into the holy ghost book
[1:26:33] of fame well that lady with two pieces
[1:26:36] two little mice that's all she had to do
[1:26:40] but we feel like we got to just be
[1:26:42] laying hands on the sick every day
[1:26:44] raising the dead opening the eyes and I
[1:26:46] see I have a battle and I've had a
[1:26:49] battle because I want to do something
[1:26:51] for God but jesus said you know that
[1:26:55] zeal let's put it this way I can't do
[1:26:58] nothing except the father
[1:27:00] show me so if God ain't showing you
[1:27:03] don't you worry about it hallelujah but
[1:27:07] God has his way I'm showing you some
[1:27:09] time he speak directly sometimes he put
[1:27:12] the impression on your heart sometimes
[1:27:13] he reveals something to you you didn't
[1:27:16] see no vision or anything but somehow a
[1:27:18] word of knowledge is in you and you know
[1:27:20] the person is going to be healed in he
[1:27:23] has various ways of speaking and when he
[1:27:26] speaks to you you know to do it and it's
[1:27:28] done you saw old brother Brooks we know
[1:27:38] when when I must have done something
[1:27:40] wrong let me ask you something Jonah got
[1:27:45] mad got angry with God did y'all know
[1:27:49] that Joe Lobeck got angry with God cuz
[1:27:52] Nineveh repented God even brought a
[1:27:57] Goergen and put it over him and shaded
[1:28:01] him from the Sun and when the gorge died
[1:28:03] he he got upset like he was the one that
[1:28:05] created it what attitude and yet he
[1:28:11] still was a prophet of God brother Aaron
[1:28:17] got up status in law you you all need
[1:28:19] explanation God don't owe you nothing
[1:28:22] and you know what the prophet of God
[1:28:24] said when I stop pouting that's when he
[1:28:28] came pouting like a child what was it
[1:28:32] six months something like that
[1:28:34] you understand what I'm trying to say
[1:28:36] what I'm saying is your attitude will
[1:28:39] either draw God nearer or push him
[1:28:42] backwards but he'll never leave you he
[1:28:44] said I'll never leave you nor will our
[1:28:46] first sake you all right
[1:28:49] I'm a coach on this he says now it is a
[1:28:51] strange thing that this is so much
[1:28:54] thought other people they say well I'm
[1:28:57] weak my faith is not very much I'm not a
[1:29:00] very good Christian that's just what the
[1:29:03] devil wants you to say Jordan you're
[1:29:06] just talking his language right now
[1:29:09] right then see you mustn't never say
[1:29:13] that don't never let your testimony
[1:29:16] become negative let it be positive all
[1:29:19] the time I am saying I have God in my
[1:29:22] heart I believe him with all my heart do
[1:29:26] you believe in divine healing with all
[1:29:27] my heart let your testimony always and
[1:29:31] your thoughts everything never permit a
[1:29:34] negative thought to come into your life
[1:29:36] if you can help it when it starts that
[1:29:39] don't entertain it well you say I can't
[1:29:43] help the thoughts from coming well that
[1:29:45] that'd be like the farmer that said he
[1:29:48] couldn't stop couldn't stop the birds
[1:29:50] from flying over his place but he could
[1:29:52] surely stopped them from roosting so
[1:29:55] that that's a good thing you see you
[1:29:57] can't help the thoughts when they come
[1:29:59] but don't entertain them just pass it on
[1:30:03] no sir
[1:30:04] Jesus is my Savior all things are mind
[1:30:08] by God I'm going to keep them I'm going
[1:30:11] to testify of them and God can only
[1:30:14] bless you as lovely this is the big part
[1:30:17] God can only bless you as you confess
[1:30:21] that he has done it for you right see
[1:30:25] the high priest of our confession is
[1:30:27] that right Hebrews 3 he says that he's a
[1:30:30] high priest of our confession he can
[1:30:33] only do for us as we accept it and
[1:30:36] believe it and confess it oh I just gave
[1:30:42] the devil a big black eye hmm he said
[1:30:47] well let let me tell you something I
[1:30:49] just found this particular quote it has
[1:30:52] been there all the time but what I
[1:30:55] needed it this is when it came right I
[1:30:58] don't hoarder perhaps I've heard it but
[1:31:00] today today it made a difference
[1:31:05] ello that's dad God is a good god there
[1:31:18] are there are and there is no reason we
[1:31:22] shouldn't miss a rapture with all of
[1:31:26] these promises and all we got to do is
[1:31:29] trust them trust God and believe God
[1:31:32] maybe you don't look right now you may
[1:31:34] be an ugly duckling or something like
[1:31:36] that maybe in this stage of life you
[1:31:38] look like a fish instead of a man
[1:31:41] however the promises of God are yay
[1:31:46] trust in people you gotta trust him you
[1:31:50] know it's just like Mary when when
[1:31:52] Joseph Joseph inspired by the enemy you
[1:31:55] know he he didn't know the promises was
[1:31:57] true he didn't realized that that that
[1:31:59] what Mary was saying was true God had
[1:32:01] not given him that revelation so he said
[1:32:04] I moonstone I'm not gonna bring make her
[1:32:06] a public show but I'm on stone or in
[1:32:08] privacy I'm gonna take her out there in
[1:32:09] stone and he was gonna do it had not the
[1:32:12] end of the Lord come to her Josephus
[1:32:14] says no don't kill her this really is
[1:32:17] true but you see what the devil want
[1:32:20] they want to kill her testimony
[1:32:22] that's why brother branham's really went
[1:32:24] against her in her testimony where she
[1:32:27] said you know at the temple your father
[1:32:30] and I we're looking for you she knew
[1:32:33] what she was saying she had to make a
[1:32:36] choice and at that time she denied her
[1:32:39] own supernatural experience with the
[1:32:41] angel hello and that's what we do
[1:32:45] sometimes let me
[1:32:47] tell you something amen god is my father
[1:32:50] and you know when Jesus got in trouble
[1:32:52] when he says I and my father are one
[1:32:55] you know when the bride's gets in
[1:32:57] trouble when she comes to that place
[1:32:58] where she can say I and my father are
[1:33:00] one that's not a mental thing that is an
[1:33:03] expression that has now made itself
[1:33:06] manifested when the squeeze come you see
[1:33:09] what I'm talking about it's coming and
[1:33:11] it's so close now things are just
[1:33:14] chaotic chaotic i don't even keep up
[1:33:20] with stuff no more yeah yeah is that
[1:33:23] right
[1:33:24] okay it messes with your mind let me
[1:33:27] stay like Peter did see Peter said no
[1:33:30] look at all these things going on in the
[1:33:32] Oh My look at that mist and he took his
[1:33:34] eyes off Jesus for just a moment and he
[1:33:37] began to sink keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:33:40] you don't need to know news cuz you
[1:33:43] ain't going to be here when it happens
[1:33:45] God gonna take you if you keep your eyes
[1:33:47] on Jesus see what I'm saying
[1:33:50] all the stuff is vexations it's
[1:33:53] distractions it has been for me maybe
[1:33:57] not for others but for me this is what
[1:33:59] it's been so I don't even look at it no
[1:34:00] more I don't I said Lord I gotta trust
[1:34:04] you I don't care if they just kill
[1:34:06] somebody at Walmart y'all understand me
[1:34:09] I wasn't there and you know what I go
[1:34:13] back to the thing that the Lord showed
[1:34:15] me and I know it was God he said when
[1:34:17] Noah was in the ark do you thinking nor
[1:34:20] was there wondering about who was out
[1:34:22] there drowning he knew everybody that
[1:34:28] wasn't in the ark was out there drowning
[1:34:30] was he saying oh lord have mercy God
[1:34:32] that already had mercy the word was
[1:34:35] their mercy and they failed to take heed
[1:34:38] to the word hallelujah there's no more
[1:34:43] revival in America the revival is in the
[1:34:46] bride that's it she spurned her day and
[1:34:50] everything is gonna get worse love
[1:34:54] fighting the Bible said as it was in
[1:34:57] Genesis in the days of Noah that's what
[1:34:59] we're living in
[1:35:00] right now men are multiplying violence
[1:35:04] in the land blood you name it that's
[1:35:07] what it is as it was in the days of Noah
[1:35:11] as it was in the days of lot and you
[1:35:14] know the two things great things
[1:35:16] violence multiplying the people right
[1:35:19] and perversion we hear and if we are
[1:35:23] here the bride is making herself ready
[1:35:25] and what was she doing what was she
[1:35:28] doing taking the ranch of some promise
[1:35:31] in spite of all of the laughter she was
[1:35:36] taking and holding on to that promise
[1:35:37] and as she held on that promise she was
[1:35:41] working keeping herself true to the
[1:35:45] promise that's all God expect for you to
[1:35:48] do keep yourself true to the promise let
[1:35:51] us pray father we thank you for your
[1:35:53] grace we thank you for your mercy we
