introduced by the Troy but uh I want to share testimony really real quick what happened yesterday before yesterday so today before I preach I called the brother because I was wondering why the brother was not coming to church anymore on Fridays when I called the brother he told me you know why I just don't feel like coming to church on Fridays you know for personal reasons well when he said that I thought that you know maybe because of me cuz I'm the one who pressures on Friday every Friday probably my you know my preaching is not benefit to any man you know I was a little bit weary without you know before it going to preach then I had that thought in my mind you know all the time the entire you know the entire afternoon I was wondering Lord what can I do so then when I went to prayer I wanted to mention that in my prayer but I felt like you know don't mission and then I kept on reading my Bible study and then I saw a text on my phone a sister which I don't know who she was I don't know where she lives she just texted me saying that brother I'm really impressed by your sermon the Lord has been blessing me when I hear you so that was like a comfort to me saying that you know God hears us and you know why I give this to someone decide you might be going through a try or you might be going through something but you wander yourself he's got real do you want real so you wonder you know is this possible does people love me or it's got real it's got even it's got to think it does God think about me you know I just want to tell you that God does you know the question that you have in your heart you know the thing that you you know your thinking about God you know God does here and God does answer so this morning and this noon you know when the brother will come you know you just have faith in God say that you know Lord this is my day I've been having this question I've been having this though for a long time that this is that they were I need my answer this is the day where I need to I need you know I need you to provide to my question I needed to provide to my need and if you come with that faith the Lord will surely you know give you the local surely provide to you so when the brother is coming we can sing he has made me glad [Music] he has made me glad every big lie I'll reread yours yes made me I will I will enter his gate replace me rain in my heart I will enter mirre yes I would say that she's the day that the Lord has truly made I will rejoice for he has made me glad [Music] yes make me glad yes picnic we rejoice Cory we and yes [Music] I'll rejoice maybe I'm glad that he did hey man it's good to see everyone here in the hospital it's morning coming out of the Saturday definitely appreciate all of you attending I don't believe I've actually ministered on any of the youth Saturdays we've done so far so it's it's nice to be here amen and I just wanted to just wanted to give thanks to all it's you that makes the service you know I've thought a lot or the recent months about how different each one of us are we all have our own different childhoods our own different experiences we're all created a little bit different you know all of us have our own little unique traits in our own unique ways that we think the things that we do it the reasons why we do such things when we come together all that uniqueness just kind of lives together in each one of us has something to add as our brother was saying you know it's so easy for us to get into certain mindsets of wondering you know well did I do this right or did I do that right or you know am I really a part of the group work am I really accepted here or am I really accepted there what does this person think me or that person think probably and the reality God is the one who made this choice a man and he chose us amen we live and move and have faith necklace Amen because no matter what the world thinks of us or what our position in this world ends up being we have a God in heaven amen he created this world as a temporary place but he has an eternal mindset a man so everything we see around us is gonna pass away one of these days amen all of our thoughts and our all things that concern us all the things that worry us all the we wonder well how is this gonna be or how is that going to be here or what about this relationship or that relationship with this person or my parents or my friends my brother all those things we wonder about our temporary a mint because God has an eternal relationship for everything that we think here on earth is temporary there is an eternal someone a manner that's what we're here to express on to tonight this morning is to express unto you the eternal a man so that you can put your thoughts your hopes your faith your dreams your beliefs on the eternal things amen and on the things down here on this earth because that's what gets that's what keeps us going that's what gives us faith to keep on moving to go through each every stage of our lives amen amen so let's just stand as we get into the word of the Lord I want to preach a message this morning called make your choice or entering into faith Amen so we'll go from Galatians chapter 3 every single one of us comes to a place in our lives where we we just we just have to make our choice amen and it comes to everybody at different times in their lives but but every single one of us if we are called to be Christians there we are come to that place reach one of us answers that call Amen you know and growing up in church is so much different than growing up in out in the world or out in a home of a non-believer because every single one of us we grow up hearing the gospel and we hear it from the day were born practically growing up to the church but there's got to come that timed where it's not your parents faith or they that where you make your choice where it is revealed unto you amen so let's read Galatians chapter 3 verse 6 and it says even as even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him righteousness no ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee Abraham shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham Amen now let's uh let's just stop right there and Bauer has a word prayer Heavenly Father we just approach unto you this morning a slore that as you said Lord where two or three are gathered in my name I'll come down and I'll be right there in the midst Laura thus more we came here in your name Lord to glorify your name to give you the preeminence father to minister to the people father to have respects unto the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we came in your name father so we asked Lord that you would answer your Gospel order and even though as brother Bram said that that you keep every appointment that you even leave glory a little bit early to get here on time and Lord I just want to thank you for being here Lord Laura we surrender our lives unto you and we ask father that you are the one that searches the hearts may you reveal yourself unto every single one of us right now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen I love the story of Abraham because Abraham was a man who didn't start off with a relationship with God amen he they he as he as God first began to reveal himself unto him that his relationship started right there amen and as God began to really introduce himself to Abraham Abraham just accepted it Amen he just began to accept it you know and every single one of us has that same just can I tell you a testimony about my own childhood and how I got started on this walk I grew up going to church amen grew up going to church every Sunday every Wednesday you know and and and it caused that that wondering is when do you become a Christian you know at what point do you actually become a Christian and and you know as you I remember my mom set me down on the couch my six or seven years old and she prayed a little prayer with me and went through the scriptures and at that point she called me a Christian a man because I had prayed this prayer with her you know and and six seven years old and and and that's that's how it got started you know but never really knowing exactly at what point I had no faith in that that prayer didn't cause faith to rise up inside of me yone later on in life I was going to little little children's meetings that we had and different things that we had and then when I was about thirteen my sister who was couple years older than I was got invited to into the the youth group they had four teenagers at our church and I was like 12 or 13 and the youth pastor kind of went up to my sister and he says oh I'd like you to join our youth group I'd like you to start coming to the services he looked over me he says you can come too you know there wasn't really a direct invitation to me he was inviting my sister you know and I didn't really have that faith that I was invited I was involved you know that I belong there and so I start attending the youth services there and and I end up going to a youth camp and listening to the preaching I have some reason I was standing in the very back at this youth camp they had some type of revival service there and probably three probably four or five hundred children there in the service and and I've some reasons I stand in the way in the back behind all all the the pews and everything and and huge auditorium lots of children and teenagers and and the man was preaching and what he was preaching really struck me and I probably 13 14 years old and and he gave an altar call for people to come up and give their hearts to Christ and as I listened to the altar call I was too scared to go up there I didn't want to go up in front of all those people and so I was just standing back there and and I just started praying right there where I was standing and I felt God changed come into my life I don't know I don't know how to express it other than that was really the beginning of what I could say I felt God I felt God's presence I knew who is there I knew who he was I that was the beginning of my recognizing of God's presence in my life I didn't receive that when I was 6 years old I didn't have that six seven eight nine I didn't have that when I was sleeping under the pews at 11 years old you know I didn't have that when I had listened to the sermons you know as a young ten eleven years old but for some reason when when I had that experience at 13 it changed who I was a man I went from a little boy that was riding his bike up and down the alleys and and playing in the yard to a boy that was reading his Bible and pray amen to to a boy they began to look to the scriptures trying to figure out who I was a man and then is that at that point that I began to listen to what the pastor was preaching a man that when I finally I started when the pastor start preaching I started actually paying attention to what he said and that's when my experience with Jesus Christ began amen as it moved on on I'd be getting my relationship with the Lord begin to change a man that's why what they I like about Abraham is how do you put your finger on Abraham's life to say this is the point that Abraham was saved where do you put your finger on Abraham's life to say this is the moment that Abraham became a Christian the Abraham became a follower of Jehovah the Abraham became one with God where where do you put your finger in Abraham's life a man you and I every single one of us you know growing up in church we all have to come to that place or Who am I in Christ who where do I where do I belong as my brother was testifying you know is just for I can't up here he's talking about how he was to preach on a winds door on a Friday night you know and and he just and and the brother wasn't sure that he wanted to come and listen so the brother automatically begins to think well maybe he does and he puts the blame on himself you know you listen to that testimony he starts to put the blame on himself and think well maybe the brother it maybe someone else was preaching it that brother would come you know and it's easy for us always to put the blame on ourselves in those situations but yet my brother was called to preach the gospel you know and everybody that is called to preach the gospel they enter into an anointing amen and when they Adrian behind the pulpit and God gives them even if they can they can walk out of the pulpit feeling like they're a complete failure but yeah God will have those words enter into somebody's heart because it's the preaching of the gospel amen but that same calling that calls a man to preach the gospel that same calling goes unto the children that are growing up in the church a man is God has a time put for you growing as a child here in this church God has a time for you to grow up in the gospel but as my as I testify you know my mom she set me down on the couch at 6 or 7 years old but God didn't meet me when I was 6 or 7 years old I had no experience with him my relationship with God didn't begin there Amen but but there was a day appointed for my relationship with the Lord to begin there was a day appointed when the revelation of Jesus Christ came to me to where all the sudden it wasn't just me listening to the pastor preach or me listening to my mom pray with me but all son knew is me and my Bible and God it was me praying to God I knew who I was praying to at that time now my faith wasn't really there at that time you know I was just stepping out into I had received you know I had received the 10 commandments I knew what all the lessons idler in Sunday school I knew I knew the thing that says don't do this you know you shouldn't lie you shouldn't do that I knew I knew about you know being spanked as a child I knew about correction I knew about don't do this or don't do that but now I had to leave that behind and enter into a relationship with God by faith there's a scripture I want to read here in Galatians chapter 3 just a little bit further down from where we read it's verse 23 and it says but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed so before on we're gonna go on to the next verse here in just a second but before faith came those that were they were kept under the law but they were only kept to a point to what faith would come into their life amen and faith is very simple it's believing in God amen you know that's one thing I love to do when I'm preaching is I like to take something that so many that has become just a how do you say a cliche or just you know you talk about faith so many times your mind doesn't quite graphs is exactly what it is amen but let me tell you if faith is just believing in God to the point that you believe in God more than you believe in the chair that you're sitting in amen that is the in goal of faith amen but that but it doesn't start off there amen it starts at this first revelation of Jesus Christ in your life amen the first moment that God starts tugging at your heart door wherever it may be you know I don't know it will be different for each one of you it'll be some day during a church service when we're all but when the Gospels being preached or we'll be at home one year when you're you're reading your Bible and all sudden the Scriptures start ministering to you there every single one of us has a different experience but there's got to be a one point in time where all of a sudden you're Lee the do's and don'ts behind and you're entering into the faith of the gospel yay God is beginning to reveal himself unto you a man that's no longer just your parents saying well you know don't do this because the Bible says so or don't do that because the Bible says so but now the God of the Bible himself is revealing himself to you a man that's a transition when children grow up in the church that's a transition that they have to make your there's a lot of children that never make that transition amen and they grow up and they still live underneath the law and then when they get older they just leave the church behind or they stay stuck there trying just obey the law without God you're on it so really it's a sad experience because it's not supposed to be that way amen the whole point of this is that you yourself would come to a point to where God is yours a man you have ownership of him he has ownership of you you two have been joined together amen amen so that when the trials of life come he's the one that you go to anyway you're right now you're growing up in your household you know and you're you know your parents they gave you your clothes they give you your food or you're going in college you and you're just starting off but there comes times when the deep desires of life or the deep trials of life start coming past you across your life you know it's where you know like right now and all your needs are being taken care of you knowing you and you know but you think but you have like the emotions of a teenager start coming into your life well here is the resource take them to God in prayer you know in the deep desires of oh I I'd like to have a relationship with someone you know or I'm thinking about a men or women you know or girlfriends and boyfriends and all those things and leaving and entering into the relationship years you know what God is your resource to take those in prayer if you have faith amen but God's relationship with you doesn't just stop there hey is he going to into the college years even like when all sudden now it's no longer your parents directing your life choices but now our life choices all to you you're the one deciding what am I going to do with my life and you're the one who now has to decide am I gonna follow the Lord Jesus Christ or am I gonna do my own thing amen making your choice entering into your fate entering into faith and then every single one of us has to come to a place where we make a decision are we going to enter into this relationship with God that will never end or are we gonna leave it behind there comes a dividing point every child that grows up in church comes to a dividing point where he must make his choice amen and I don't know what day in your life that will come but at some point God has to touch your hearts door to a point to where you leave your father and your mother behind and you enter into this relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen where you make your choice for the Lord and all of a sudden God becomes your provider amen he becomes the one that directs you into college he becomes the one that directs you into and to choose animate a man choosing a husband or wife and then you know and then later on in life you know when your friends are going through cancer you know when you're when you're when you need when you're need a good job you know when you're when you get sick and you're dying or you're or a depression comes across your life and God be the one that you chose back there becomes your resource to save you your weak to your resource to deliver you he becomes the one that you lean on the one that comes your healing power a man he becomes the one that cures your depression a man he becomes the one that that guides you through your choices in life so it's you're not alone when you have to make a choice he's the one that provides you with the spouse he's the one that provides you with a job he's the one that provides you with all you have need of upon life's journey amen and that's what caught us the benefits of making this choice for the Lord Jesus Christ amen so in Abraham was given this choice leave everything behind I have a I want you to follow my leadership and go to another land 500 miles away and I will show you every step of the way a man so Abraham came to a point where he had to make his choice amen he decided that the choice that short he decided that the the the promise that was offered to him was better than the things that he was leaving behind amen and every single one of us at some point is gonna have to make our choice are we gonna be constrained by the laws of the gospel are we gonna leave our own thoughts behind and enter into the relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ how are we going to follow his ways are we going to follow our ways but let me tell you when we if we make the wrong choice and decide to follow our own ways and follow our own paths we have nothing to lean on amen you're entering out into a world with no resources from eternity hey man but let me tell you when you fall when you when you follow the choice of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you God is the god of infinite resources amen he owns all the cattle on a Thousand Hills Amen he owns every tree in the forest amen he owns every building that was ever built a man he is the one that controls he can make Kings move in his direction a man he can he can move an entire business to operate according to his will amen he can he can move cancer out of a body he can he can a can provide you with a job he can do whatever if a man that is there has given his his life over to the Lord Jesus Christ has infinite resources amen amen the God that created the heavens and the earth has prepared a place for you in eternity a man right now you have the you know you think you have the next 40 50 60 70 years ahead of you amen but but all of us must grow old and die or go in the rapture at some point every single one of us and say when that time comes your choice is gonna pay off amen though the things that we suffer here in this life journey do not compare to the things he is laid up for us and or a man the same God that created the mountains that created the force that created the the pleasures that we have on this life amen is the same God that created a place for us to live throughout all eternity amen and the pleasure that he has created for us is the world cannot compare to me amen amen so as Abraham first made his choice he was he started a relationship with Jehovah amen he started a relationship with God they would go down throughout all history amen hey man let me tell you Abraham is still alive this day remember in the Bible a one time Jesus was going there he says Abraham saw my day he was glad and he rejoiced him amen amen if you remember the story that brother Branham told of blind Bartimaeus in the Bible he or I went through a few years ago and I listened to every single sermon brother Branham preached on blind Bartimaeus one after another and and it was really a blessing to me but the story of blind Bartimaeus goes kind of like this he grew up in the near the River Jordan in town Jericho and on the hills near Jericho and as he grew up as a boy he wasn't born blind but he could see when he was a child amen and so is he explored he saw the River Jordan he and he saw the fields and he knew and his mom would tell him these Bible stories amen and so and so his blind bartimaeus was growing up his mom would tell him you know you know that River Jordan when when your ancestors came over over here God parted the river in two and the people walked across on dry ground a man that God Himself spoke to the river and they walked her and also in the river just parted ways and and you know when the our people were able to walk across on dry ground a man that same God is still here today a man it is Joshua crossed over the river Jordan there after that that he met the angel to cut the the captain of the hosts of the Lord a man and that son is the one that led him and had him conquer thousands and thousands of the enemy amen and and as gently as Joshua came up to Jericho that they marched around and the walls were so thick they could ride a chariot upon it a man but as they marched around the walls for seven days God told them what to do and when they did it all of a sudden God spoke to the walls and the and they shouted in the walls came tumbling down and that same God is here today and blind Bartimaeus had all these Bible stories stored up in his mind from when his but his mother used to tell him and she used to tell him you know that that road that's going up right across Jericho there she says that's the same road that the prophets Elijah and Elijah marched down when they went back down to the Jordan and God parted the Red Sea for him again amen and as now blind bartimaeus ended up having a really sad childhood as he lost his sight amen then he lost his parents amen and he became just a beggar in the land amen in order for him to get his days food day by day you know he had to beg for a coin at the gates of Jericho there every morning a man he just had a sad life story to where it seemed like everything was going wrong you know and the very and the very God of Jehovah seems to have abandoned him you know in all the hopes and dreams he had as a child were now dashed now he can no longer see he has to have his parents there to guide him through life amen and he you know he gets married and he has a daughter and his daughter gets sick you know and Justin and his wife gets sick you know it just seems like everything is falling apart but he has a relationship with Jehovah where he trusts in the Lord and the Lord heals his daughter he trusts in the Lord and and the Lord heals his wife amen and as brother Ram told the story about how when his daughter got sick that he had these two little turtle doves they would do little tricks there at the at the gate so he had sit there begging and and he they sit there on a rock by the gate and as he sat there begging that these two little turtle doves would do tricks amen and and and and and and then people would stop they'd watch the turtle doves doing a trick and they'd enjoy it and they'd give him a little coin and those turtle doves helped him get money sing by his food day by day amen and and one day when his daughter got sick he said Lord you got down in his prayer and he is afraid that that his daughter would die and he said Lord if you will heal my daughter I will sacrifice my turtle doves to you a man then about two days later also and his daughter gets better a man they thought she was going to die but sudden she gets better and so he takes his two little turtle doves and he and he takes them up to the priest he sacrifices them as a sacrifice to Lord an offering to God amen the high priest would take them and and and and and they said and he says I'm and a little bit later his wife gets sick and so he and brother bran we tell the story about how he had this little lamb there would lead them kind of like a seeing-eye dog would lead would lead a blind person he had this lamb that would lead him through the city amen and keep him from stumbling and going to take him to the right place amen and that lamb was like a set of eyes to him a man is but when his wife got sick he went got down and he prayed to the Lord and he said Lord if you will heal my wife then I will sacrifice this lamb T to you and in honor of you healing my wife and sure enough the next day his wife began to get better a man is so he goes down to the to the temple door into the high priest and he I was offering up the that his his little lamb is a offering to the Lord and the priest says bartimaeus you cannot give up that lamb that lamb is your eyes and as the story goes on the hot Barmes said to him no I promised God that if God would heal my wife that I would give sacrifice this lamb unto Jehovah and the high priest said but but that lamb is your eyes you tell you what I will buy you a lamb and just so that you can sacrifice that lamb unto me amen and but and bartimaeus said but I never promised God just any land I promised god this lamb a man that lamb was the most important one of the most important things he had in his life well his most valuable possessions and he sacrificed it too it was the high priest said you cannot do this this is you know this is your everything this is about all you that you own and he says well and he says Oh high priest if I will give up my land God is able to provide me a lamb you know well as the priest says but that lamb is your eyes that lane was your eyesight that's the thing that guides you the thing that leads you but by tomorrow mayor said but oh I if I sacrifice this lamb God is able to provide a lamb for my eyes God is able to provide a lamb to give me leadership to lead me through the city to show me where I ought to go I promised God this lamb and so he sacrifices that lamb and all sudden his wife the woman that he loved begins to get better a banana so as he as he now he's lost his turtledoves and he's he's lost his he's lost his lamb a man all he has left is his family a man they have no food to put on the table a man he's blind he cannot see and then one morning his brother Brandon tells the story that he that he sleeps in and he misses the morning rush hour as people enter into the city a man and now he's not sure if he's gonna get enough money that morning to to buy food or not to put food on the table amen because everybody they come in in the morning during rush hour they give what little more a coin to the beggar that day and if you if the beggar isn't there then he doesn't get food for the day and he misses out so blind bartimaeus he wakes up laying around 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning and he and he had been dreaming all night about all the Bible stories his mom used to tell him and he began to wonder Lord aren't you the same yesterday today and forever don't you aren't you still alive aren't you still God don't you still reign why is it that we hear all these stories in the Bible yeah we haven't seen I don't see you Here I am I've I've lost everything that I own I've lost my eyesight and all I have left is my wife and my daughter and I but I cannot see I cannot work I can't provide for my family where is the God of where is Jehovah the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob where is the God of Elijah and he sat down on this little rock by the by the gate there and and nothing to beg with nothing to draw the attention of the people just a blind man sitting off off the on the side of the road amen and as he sits there maybe has think Lord this rock that I'm sitting on was shooken down by the power of Jehovah when the walls of Jericho fell a man Jehovah you are the one that put this rock here this rock was put here by by man but you are the one that shook it down and now I'm sitting here on a rock that is placed here by the power of Jehovah where is God I'm sitting here I've lost everything I hold dear in my life except for my wife and daughter and I cannot even provide for them and where is the God Jehovah see as you go on you're with your relationship with the Lord now you don't know what's going to happen to you in your life's journey but as you go on there might be some really sad things that happen in your life you know what knows what what our future beholds amen but one thing we do know is that the sky is the same yesterday today and forever amen and so as blind bartimaeus was sitting there on that rock he said Lord I'm sitting here on this rock there was shooken ship down here by the power of Jehovah I'm sitting on the same road that Elijah and Elijah walked down on the way to Jericho de prata pasul and the wit to open the Red Sea where is the god of power where is the god of Jehovah amen it all suddenly begins to hear the noise as Jesus is entering into the city amen and he asks the people what all this noise here of people yelling and different things and and all sudden says woman comes up to him and says that is the same one that proposes prophesied of the Abraham prophesied of the Adam prophesied of that Joshua prophesy this is Jesus Christ the Lamb of God they'll be slain for the sins of the world and he began to cry out and say oh Jesus our son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Christ was the Lamb that was provided for his own amen and brother brown he says that that here Joshua met that met Jesus Christ just fifty years it's just a few miles from there amen maybe a thought maybe five hundred years beforehand amen a thousand years beforehand or whatever it was judge is where Joshua met Jesus there before the captain of the Lord's host Amen but now he is passing by again in blind Bartimaeus day hey man he's passing by again right before blind Bar maces face Amen O God that he heard about that his mother had told him about is now passing by right there a man every one of us will receive that same thing when God first tugs at your heart door Amen though the moment that God ever first begins to tug at your heart store the God ever first whether it be here at church listening to a sermon or during a worship service or wherever it is that that first tug that you receive of your heart when God begins to reveal himself to you that is the same Lord Jesus Christ that created the heavens and the earth it's the same one that created this the metal that's in that post the same one that created the concrete that we're sitting on right now he's the one that's created the the door that we turn in this morning the metal that's made in that door he spoke all those things into existence you're sitting right now on a chair that was that it's made of materials that were spoken into existence by the Lord Jesus Christ six thousand years ago or however long it was ago Amen you're sitting on the very power of God manifests it in these last days amen and that same God is here to reveal himself to you a man who his revelation is to draw you into a relationship with himself amen and that relationship will never die let me tell you the relationship that God started with Abraham is still going on Abraham is still catching revelations of jehovah after revelations amen as he's entered into paradise a minute he's entering it God took him up into the heavens amen amen the revelations are still moving on and so is it with you as God reveals himself to you and your youth that revelation will never end that revelation will never die God has a greater revelation for you and every moment of your life God wants to reveal himself to you as a healer as a deliverer as one they'll set free one the well give you a wife one they'll give you a husband one they'll give you a job they'll give you a career that will give you a life is worth talking about amen to give you a life that can that others can only dream about amen to give you a life that lives above the things of the world to give you a life that lives about above just living here working for 40 50 years and then passing away amen to give you a life better than those things why because you know the infinite resource you know the God that is lives up in the heavens you know the God that owns everything amen that if God's wants you to be the king of the world he can place you there if God wants you the president of the company he can place you there if God wants you to preach the gospel over here he can place it if God wants you to travel across the seven continents God will take you there if God wants you to be a mother in the home and to give you beautiful children and a wonderful family amen where you and your husband live at peace in the home God is able to give that to you and when others are living in divorces and living in an abuse and living it in that but you yourself can trust in the Lord God Almighty amen just put your trust on your hope in him amen it will pay off in your life it pays off as you go on and on and on right now in your youth if you're if you're just if you're a teenager or if you're not even a teenager yet or if you're in your 20s you know you may not have every you know your the relationship continues on and on and on I haven't I don't know what it's like to be an old man yet I'm not there yet amen but but as life goes on I will get there amen I know it's like to trust God as a teenager I know it's like to trust God in my early 20s I know us I'd like to trust God in my 30s a man I've seen it and it's paid off let me tell you my testimony God has been with me every step of the way and the relationship I've now been serving the Lord for 27 years since he met me there at 13 years old amen and he has met me every step of the way he's always been with me when I've been depressed he's been there Amen when I bend down he's lifted me up when I needed a job he's given it to me when I needed a wife he provided for me Amy I went out when I when I didn't have enough money to put food on the table he gave it to me a man well my children were sick he's healed them well my life couldn't have children He healed her amen and when I needed a job he gave it to me supernaturally and throughout all my life I've seen God I've seen God I've seen the lame walk amen I've seen I've seen God do so many things that now I am at the place now where I believe that God can do anything amen I've seen God do so much a man in my own life that let no man trouble me I've seen the Lord Jesus Christ in action you can't talk against him I don't care what anybody says I've seen God in action my relationship has gotten to a point to where I've entered into faith amen I'm not living in doubt I'm living in belief I'm not living in doubt I'm living in faith there's no doubt in me because I just believe Amen I didn't get there overnight but Amen I've gone there from glory unto glory unto glory as you go up as you get older as you experience the Lord as you begin to put more things than you have a need in your life put it before God in prayer amen say Lord I am trust seen you for this you know you need when you have a the deep desires of your life oh I wish I had this oh I wish I had that you know when you're when you're only eight or nine years old I wish I had this toy or that toy or I wish I could go and play over here play over there you know well put it before God in prayer you know when you're a teenager and you and you wish have more freedom you know and and to explore and to do different things or to have more friends put in prayer a man when you want to know well where should I go to college where should i goes to go put it before God in prayer when you want to get married when you want to spout spirit before God in prayer God is able to give you something that when you grow older you'll look back and say oh that was the most perfect thing I could have had amen I have the advantage now I'll be able to look back in my life and I can I think oh my if I would have made a choice I would have chosen wrong but I put it before God in prayer and God made the choice for me and now I look back and I think oh my God made the perfect choice for me let me tell you when I was growing up there was a lot of girls all around me but God gave me one and she has been a perfect spouse unto me a perfect spouse unto me I couldn't I be scared to have wish for anything different I'd be scared to have anything there's nothing better out there for me God gave her to me she's perfect IIIi don't know what I'd do without but that's because God gave me gave her to me amen and and and and let me tell you that's my testimony amen but that ought to be your testimony amen and if you put that before God in prayer and trust in the Lord and never doubt he will see you through amen amen and so as a through throughout all your life's journey just when you're entering into faith you're entering into that relationship let me tell you by the time Abraham was an old man he got to the place where he believed in God so much that God could tell him anything and he just believed he just believed that's just that's just what yet okay God I believe okay God yes Lord I believe yes Lord I believe let me tell you that faith paid off Amen that faith paid off Amen God made him the father of Nations you know I was just reading the other day I think they said there are over of all the religions of the world there's multiple religions that point back to Abraham as their founder of all those religions the people that follow that religions they say it's about 60% of the people on the earth belong to a religion that point back to Abraham Abraham's faith paid off he became the father of Nations amen amen and so that relationship changed over and over and over and over again amen and so will it with you when you first make your choice and you trust in the Lord in all your ways and he will show you your past let's turn it of Psalms 25 I just here in closing when I was a young teenager probably 1415 years old I found Psalms 25 and I would pray these first five verses constantly I was always praying these first five verses to the Lord and this was my prayer I would psalms 25 1 it says unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul o my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let my not mine enemies triumph over me yay let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed which which transgress without cause and this this was these next two were my two key verses in my life at that age show me thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths lead me and I truth and teach me for thou art the God of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day and those two scriptures that verse 4 in that verse 5 those were the scriptures of my teenage years those were the ones that I rested on those are the ones that I believed in when I prayed when I when I kneeled down in prayer or wherever I was in my bedroom I was always laying in bed at night with my flashlight even sometimes I'd be praying those two verses to God that God would teach me his ways and show me his past he guided me in truth and teach me amen and a few if you know my testimony you know I I don't have anything more than probably a 5th grade education I didn't go to I quit school and I was about 11 years old a man and growing up you know always having that a complex of thinking other people were smarter than me you know I was watching my friends in high school and I never went to high school you know and I never went to middle school and watching my friends grow up I always felt that everybody else was smarter than I was you know and always thinking the air base was better than you and I always had a complex in my life you know and I always wanted to make sure that is never in a position that my ignorance would show you know that I always want to make sure that I had a way to prove myself that I was smarter than everybody else you know I'd read books and read that and always trying to figure out what I was missing out on that everybody else knew but me yelling and and and all of that and all that all those complexes and different things I had growing up amen and I constantly prayed Lord teach me all our ways and show me your pass and now I can look back and I look back where all my friends ended up and my friends they ended up in divorce Minh and an abuse and in this and in that and and different things that they ended up in and I can look back some of them gone into witchcraft and and vampire type stuff and just all the wickedness of this earth that you can imagine and homosexuality and I perverseness and pornography and I and I see where all my friends that scattered to the four winds I grew up in church with and yet here am I he taught me his ways he showed me his paths he guided me in truth and righteousness for his namesake and now I can say I trust in the Lord all the day long he kept me my prayers paid off let me tell you now I am the Abraham Amen I am the Abraham I am the one that entered into faith I am the one that turn into belief I am the one that God has not withheld anything from me as soap that can be your testimony as well that you trust in the Lord and never no I'm not saying that your life will be easy I'm not saying that you won't go through hard times I went through some rough times I got a five year period of my life that I was the most depressed person in the city pretty much but God brought me out but God saw me through a man God delivered me and brought me up out of that thing Amen my god he has been my God he's been my companion I have a relationship with him that no man can take away a man that's my testimony and now that is to become your testimony amen so pray these verses show me an Iowa Zalora teach me that pass lead me and I truth and teach me for thou art the God of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day and God will remember you the god that is tugging at your hearts door right now will remember you and he has a path for you to walk on it's for ordained before the foundation of the world God has a path for you to walk on Amen just keep trusting in the Lord just keep praying reading his word amen you're in the time of life where you're making all those foundational decisions that will affect you for the rest of your life amen amen God will lead you in your steps your steps will be ordered of the Lord amen let's just stand make your choice enter into faith a man that's the story of every young man that trusts in the Lord you are entering into faith you're entering in you're starting off your relationship with God you're learning those lessons they'll be with you the rest of your life and your 20s and your 30s and your 40s and your 50s 60s 70s if the Lord should tell you men you're entering into faith and you're beginning thing you're beginning habits of trust in Lord those habits and they will pay off as he go on livestream amen those that let me tell you it pays off the price that you pay now pays off in the future so when you get to those times in life where you have those rough times you have the God that can move heaven and earth on your behalf is on your side the God that can move heaven and earth belongs to you so in your friends that don't trust in the Lord go off the path over here and go off the path over there you march on and you can trust the Lord and never doubt he will surely bring you out a man why because you are the one that trusted in Jehovah you are the one that created that but you are the one that had faith in the creator of the heavens and the earth why because the one that created the heavens and the earth had a vision in his mind he created everything that we see and when you discover that vision and you all sudden realize that you are a part of that vision and you can walk in a way that no one else can walk because you're a walking in accordance to the vision you're walking with the vision and whatever Jesus Christ had in his mind when he was dying on that cross yeah it was your footsteps as you will walk through life those footsteps are the very thing that Jesus Christ think about what he was done amen and that is a promise giving it to you teaching me and aiways the lord show me your paths guide me in your truth and righteousness Lord for your name's sake because Jesus Christ hasn't passed walking so just trust in him make your choice enter into the faith Lord Jesus Christ amen you'll be a son or daughter of Abraham let's just pray Heavenly Father I just thank you Lord for these young men and women Lord starting their path Lord in life making their choices Lord and I pray for a father for every single one of them as they choose Lord to serve you may you give them that revelation Lord that you'll be with him all the days in their life it's the same voice spirit that brooded over the dark earth from the beginning is now brooding over their life and the same the same Holy Spirit that brooded over a dark earth and created a Garden of Eden now can create a Garden of Eden in their heart their soul let it be into them according according to your vision let it be or what you saw when you were dying on that cross let it be in their life Lord Lord be it unto us according to thy word O Lord we lay ourselves down upon the altar but Oh Lord we just sweet we trust we hope you teach us thy ways o Lord show us your paths guide his truth and righteousness Lord for your name sing through your salvation be with us all the days of our life let it be into us supportive they were lonely ass [Music] they were I believe as possible you believe as possible to choose Jesus Christ you believe it's possible that he'll guide you throughout all your life and when you make this choice do you look back throughout the route when the book of your life is written then you look back at your time you look back and see oh my god let me make that choice God or gain that choice for me God ordained this choice week Hey look back you say I'm glad that God or game-breaker when your testimony will be that the Lord Jesus Christ is with every step of the way he is with me all the days of my life in every chart test in every trial God was there holding my hand God was there revealing himself to me [Music] close out the service amen I hope you're a blessed hope you're entering in the face they meant it's possible just like blind Bartimaeus was wondering if the guy of Jehovah with still reveal himself in his day so he found out not only that he was passing by right that moment so is it true this day that the God of heaven is here to reveal itself in 2020 [Music] the prophet of God says so you are a product and five years for coming all the choice you're gonna make today getting to Bryce get it brother branham towles is that the age of accountability is just seven years old that's what you start knowing derived from the wrong so we don't really matter how old you are if you are just seven years old but when Jesus Christ was you know the disciples of Jesus Christ they were trying to stop the allottee the little kids to come pay him and he says don't stop them because the kingdom of God is theirs so we just need that simplicity color choice you are going to make you're going to be judged by that choice so many times you feel like God is talking your heart but the devil is always telling you to postpone oh maybe next service maybe next Sunday I like when he was talking about the story of blind but to be his the people were trying to hush him he would say Jesus Christ son of God have mercy on me he was trusted no matter how old you are no matter how what situation you are if you up if you feel something trying to rush you that's the devil he doesn't want you to get closer to God so just ignore that if you come to God you [Music] [Music] [Music] it's okay just probably sing the song then each and every one kneel down pray whatever you don't have to pretend to God you know we can all pretend trying to hide our pasta you know you don't want to show it to your friends or your people around you but you know God draws your heart so everyone just in your own way pray to God just pour out your heart to him you know what you need you know what you want God to help you with probably you in school you probably have a habit in addiction or whatever it is God is there to help you can take that away I surrender [Music] [Music] surrender [Music] all my [Music] I'm surrendering to God [Music] I surrender Oh [Music] my [Music] Savior [Music] seeing it [Music] sorry [Music] so [Music] my [Music] let's go quick Singh I surrender let him know that she was surrendering to him oh Jesus Oh [Music] [Music] yeah I surrender [Music] all to be my late it [Music]
