TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing let us pray father we thank you for this evening truly we are unworthy creatures and the more that I see that I am so the more that I see that what you require of us make me see Lord just how insufficient we are without you Lord Jesus Christ where would we be it is total grace Lord that we are able to stand and speak before you let your blood cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord and forgive us for all of our sins bless the service here this evening we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one of the brothers takes me a message on love and having a pure heart I thought it was wonderful because I know that only the pure in heart shall see God and you and I know by God's grace that the Word of God tells us the message of God is the message of love but we must understand tonight that we are in a battle brother Branham tells us that when those flying saucers that they began to see in the early fifties a fifties and sixties one of the things that he said they were in battle formation so when I took that thought and God gave me some thoughts on that because you and I must understand that we are in a battle Paul always he tells us to put on the whole armor of God the thing that is being attacked in this age more than anything is else is love because the devil don't care if you the other areas are not covered but he makes sure you don't get to love love is' god' love is' life i'm not talking about this foolishness that we call love there is the filial love and the agape love and that filial love brother Branham said to get jealous and kill a man over what of his wife but the golfy love is far beyond that here Paul is the angel of the emphasis age and the effort of the age is likened unto the age of perfection Paul preached perfection now that the things that Paul preached on perfection we are now enjoying it we're eating it up so that we will be perfected because we realize that perfection I'm being perfected is a process it is a process of the Holy Spirit but like all victories you cannot have without a battle the battles must come even in the early age though we don't fight against the enemy in which they how they fought against him just for the gospel of Jesus Christ their heads were being decapitated men burn at the stake that Oh horse-rider took own the image of the red horse and he began to splatter blood everywhere but the thing I loved about the early church is that they were not a shame and nor were they afraid they took on their position they they got in their formation and they went to battle it is said in the forest foxes Book of Martyrs that many of the early Saints ran to the Lions they didn't run from him because they recognized that they they had to die and they were willing to die because they had that ox anointing Paul amen when he says I bear in my body the marks of Jesus Christ but he said when the battle is over with one day we would preach the last sermon close the book for it's last time sing the last human pray the last prayer woo the battle will end for me someday the battle will end for you don't have to worry because then we will meet because a day the great High Priest the great High Priest of God our Lord Jesus Christ who will serve us communion sit down at the battle after the battle is over while it is time let us grab them folks let's grab lots and things that we can and try to pull them out of Sodom because we've got to do it I was thinking about message that I I want to be played here and that blushing prophet and when the brother Keith basically shared that message and had been a real blessing to me because it really puts everybody in their place we thank God for our apostle paul paul had a testimony said when he said i fought a good fight hmm i finished my course but this is the greatest part for me i have kept the faith i have kept the faith is that right he said because i have kept the faith there's a crown waiting for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day Oh may God be blessed tonight and may God grace and mercy be upon us that if we come to the end we should come to the end of our road before the wrap to take place we'll have that testimony that we have kept the faith we are living at a time where God has become history even among the message many people refer back to brother Branham and all the things that he has done that will work because his day is finished he can say to Paul and like he said I have finished the course and I kept the faith but brother Branham a man tells us that we ought to live God out of history we must make him real today see that's what the Prophet did he was able to take God bring him history and we knew the god of history his name is Jesus Christ it was many years later with our text reading tonight and subjects reading he's bringing him out of history and I'm gonna read these things when Elijah has seen the curse of the nation and was up on the mountain and for hundreds of years there have been no prayer answered in Israel can you imagine hundreds of years no prayers answered in Israel yet he lied to knew that there was a God of history that could come on the scene and he challenged the unbelieving world to stand in the presence of this God and see which one would answer by fire I believe we're living in a day like Elijah that the God who that is God let him answer by fire and the God who would protect the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace brought down the fire and consumed the sacrifice it was also not long after that when a man had died by the name of Lazarus and there was a god that still lived that could take Enoch home without even seeing death and yet take Elijah up on a chariot of fire and he was called on the scene in a dark hour of death and he acted the same way he would at any time yet he was God of the history but was raised from up from history to a present crisis you understand me in other words if he raised the dead yesterday he could raise the dead today whatever he did yesterday he can do it today if he can save you from death hallelujah he can raise you from death it was down that at Jericho she what let me back it up some him it was also not long after that when a man dies by the name of Lazarus and there was God that still lived that God could take Enoch home without even seeing death and take Elijah up on a chariot so what I'm saying he said listen death is in the hand of God hallelujah he can allow death to take you he can allow you to scape death hallelujah is that right and if you die he could raise you up it was down by Jericho Gate where a blind man sit by the road crying all hope was gone no doctor could do him any good his money was spent there was nothing left for him but to sit there and dream for a few days till death would be a sweet relief and one day coming down the road a God of history come on the scene in a present crisis see there's one thing we we fail to see it is God who allows the crisis to come into our lives that we may call upon the god of history why because he just doesn't want to be a God of history he wants to be a present help in time of your need hallelujah hallelujah it was in Jerry's house where the doctors had failed and turned that little girl back to die and death had come in and taking it bitter told and had taken the only child to home the little girl of 12 and stretched her out on a couch when a broken hearted little preacher had to forsake his denomination and all of his friends but he remembered that there was a God of history who could raise the dead and he went to find him hello when a crier come you need to go find it seek and ye shall find knock and it opens up unto you ask and it shall be given unto you he is still the same God hallelujah see we must understand that we're not working with an amateur God we're here to battle there's no time to cower down now we don't retreat if it means we get scars praise God we get scars there's nothing like a man who comes out of a war with scars he's got a history of wit whatever battles he fought in how he got this scar and how he got that scar I don't want to get to heaven without a scar when this God dwelling in the body called Jesus son of God when he was called on the scene and called up out of history the God who could raise the dead in the Old Testament brings life back to a dead baby through a prophet that God cannot die He is God for eternity that baby laying there in the bed stretched out and a little Jarius knowing that the shooter might got her baby back was that right in the Old Testament the shooter might got her baby back hallelujah that's what we can look at the Old Testament says Lord you did it for them you can do it for me hallelujah that God of history if he could ever be called into action he's the same God today searching through he had heard of some man man that claimed to have the power and that was Jesus of Nazareth who they all hated but he called him on the scene but he was the closest represent representative he could find of God at that day a God of the Living God and when he was called on the scene and the historical God was called up he acted the same way he did when he spoke to Elijah on the dead baby hallelujah he can't tell you something different if your circumstances are the same he must act in the same way today as he did yesterday is that right let me let me more say today brother his sister in the present day with uh twin crisis and when cancer is setting heating the world up diseases of all kind the same historical God that cleansed the leopard heal the sick raise the dead is the same God today waiting anxiously for his people he said waiting anxiously for his people to call on him or call him on the scene for action hallelujah and when you call on Jesus either so say Jesus you called him like Ryan by the Magus right Oh glory to God Jesus thou son of David hallelujah see you and I must understand that this god of history is not dead he cannot die he's still here and what he wants us to understand that when these angels came down these investigating angels they came down to spy out the land and they came in the formation of war formation of battle hallelujah it meant they would just follow you around but they had order from God go down and I want you to see and check it out now God knows but he plays this drama for his own sake right remember how it was in Egypt a lot of time we think that we go through these trials and God don't see how frictions God sees your future because you could not have them if God didn't let them happen happen like many of affliction of the righteous but God delivered them out of them all Hey and God saw Egypt in the third chapter of Exodus and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrow sometimes God can't get our attention until he brains the sorrow and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians that's what I love about it and I am come down y'all know something can you hear that and I have come down the Bible said that mighty angel descending out of heaven and he put one foot on the land and one on the sea I have come down and when it came down he come for one purpose to deliver us it is a battle we talk about all the demons amen we we basically give more glory to the demons than we do them that the mighty angel hallelujah but that force has no power over us we may stumble we may fall but the Bible said of just man though he falls seven times in a day he gets up we got that get up power hallelujah a man he says and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters but I know their sorrow and I'll come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land into a good land in a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the Canaanites he dies - Emma rights under the Paradise and the hivite and the jebusite now therefore behold cry of the children of Israel has come unto me so don't thank God don't hear your cry God hear your cry he said they have come down they have come up to me and therefore I have come down let us remember he's still here come now there and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou made bring forth my people and the children of Israel out of Egypt Moses says unto god I love this statement Who am I know that feeling ah I know that feeling I have that feeling pretty often Who am I that you would cause me to be a servant of yours in a time like this in the greatest age ever in the greatest battle ever this is the greatest battle because this is the last battle hallelujah that God will call you and I to fight Satan in his own Eden we don't have to worry about whether is going to happen or not it's already because happiness it's been spoken it has been ordained I was in 55 10 through 11 said 4 has a rain coming down in the stove snow from heaven and return it not dinner but water the earth and making it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater hallelujah you know God is in control all of that if God was hello cease don't you bad don't you bring fall they wouldn't have the power to do so it is God who sees the thirsty seed it is God who waters the seed is that right hallelujah so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things wherein to I sent it hallelujah if you are bride hallelujah you don't have to worry about coming making a hundred you are ordained to make a hundred you don't have to worry about amen will quit will I not make it you have been ordained to make it does it mean you gonna say scape fights and battles no sure God has placed us in the heat of the battle let me tell you some of the greatest battle ever is in your mind every thought is a spirit is either the Spirit of God or the spirit of the devil hallelujah and the Bible said girdle up the loins of your mind hallelujah got to recognize who you are in order to fight this battle you must know you are on the Lord's side hallelujah whose side are you on tonight you are on the Lord's side and as long as you can remember that and keep that in your heart you'll have the strength to fight you're here the strength to get up you'll know that you are a winner because Paul said we're more than compass through Christ Jesus how come brother Brahim gives us a victory you didn't know it you don't own it he gives us a victory that's why when the battle is over they take those crowns and they throw now they realize God gave them the victory hallelujah like you must understand your seat is already at the table there's a name on it hallelujah got your name only not somebody else's your name somebody sitting in your seat you say pardon that's my seat well how do you know what I see cuz it's got my name on it hallelujah it's reserved in heaven for you and I and when it's all over when God begins to wipe the tears away from my eyes you and I gonna look back and said it's worth it all it was worth it all amen listen when we don't we don't mention our flying saucers and things of that nature but you know what it's it's I saw no YouTube today somebody sitting with the news or whatever and and they were showing the Arctic and how it's making all these weird noises and all I could think about was the Bible said the earth groans hallelujah the earth is groaning is that right for sweet relief look at these tornadoes and hurricanes is tearing up everything what is it the world doesn't know it they call it the Class A Oh but the climate is warming warming of the climate or whatever they call it it's birth pains this world is ready to give way bring forth a new world hallelujah oh don't fret about all of those political feats God want you to see what's happening all he's doing is setting the stage up for the battle for the last final battle it is the stage being set up it's got to start somewhere hallelujah we wouldn't have known we were in the chapter of Revelation 13 had another prophet told us hallelujah we can't continue like going like a land with no land no more that we don't have the nature malaria we are a dragon and everywhere in the world you see dragon that means devil we're nation of the devil hello and we're no different than what Babylon was hallelujah they had the ups and downs and the powers that were rising and falling was ordained by God every bit of it and every one of them had to do what God wanted them to do what was he doing setting the stage hallelujah at the same time he was bringing judgment to Israel for failing to keep the word 70 years they had to be slaves but God promised him after 70 years I'm gonna bring you out anointed Azra hallelujah Lord did Nehemiah hallelujah what was he doing he God was the captain of the whole thing orchestrating everything to bring Israel back to her homeland and what is God doing now Israel might be battling all the time but what is he doing he's literally sizzling them in their rightful place a meant for this battle of Armageddon hallelujah and what is he doing to the bride he's squeezing he putting the squeeze on you he's given you more battles than you ever had in your lifetime but he knows you can press through it you are danger come it you are deign to fight this battle and come out as victorious amen is he gonna know it cannot be easy on you you and I are champions did you not know that brother branham tells us they meant these the bride who makes it out of this age we get the greater reward this age that emphasis this age oh it's worth it all so how you fall sometimes soldier come some short sometime we all do hallelujah but God Grace has been given to us you said what do you mean brother I am favored and so are you is that right that's what he said hallelujah Esther was favored and let me tell you something when it comes to getting to the king you must sometimes break some laws he said what do you mean Oh church or the laws it's not it's not lawful for you to do this without being summoned she says oh but if my parents let me perish I'm going to see the King see God will put press on you to see whether you'd be willing to be led by his spirit or led by the law man's Creed's and dogmas is what I'm speaking of not God's Word he said you see in the papers the other day where they required science requiring science the Pentagon to answer the flying saucers it was a myth it was something it imagined it was it was an intelligent they flew the battle they flew in battle formation they could stop they could start they could stop they could tell it was an intelligence they know it that people laughs they said flying saucers made fun out of it hallelujah and even if you tell people it was greater than that it wasn't just some scientific some people from another planet or from another world it meant discovering that there is life on this planet - but we're more superior hallelujah it was literally a joke investigating angels hallelujah in a flying formation hallelujah you say Oh what are you saying we're coming back in the formation - the Bible said we're coming back it meant riding white horses like I said you know with all the time people think well it's all over no when we go to heaven we come back down amen spent a thousand years on the earth and then we have another battle to go but you know what I'm thinking Jesus said before he comes there were besides and the heavens above did you notice before we start I got that mixed up yo y'all could put it right in place before he started destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because there's 6x affair I like that because you know and I know that's where the devil is hitting more he's hitting that area more than anything sex affair they were destroyed because of their sex affair hallelujah he sent angels down to investigate it angels had to come to the earth in the last few days they've been seen among the people I mean on his blood washed people who noted they've even stood and had their pictures taken that's right angelic beings have visited taking word back to the Father that sin had heaped up to the Stars can Hartley's shot hallelujah he talked about just the stars I bet he's talked about this here can hardly shine because of the seared hallelujah is it better betel nuts on the pulpit five times the moon the whole world is really like a drunken like really like a drunk man coming in at night and y'all know it's true right you know the world is weird really it's wobbling because of we've taken all the medals and all of the things out of it uh-huh he said one real earthquake that's why he's like an eggshell everything is just just and because of rebuilding this and building it it's just make it so we don't have the kind of intelligence hmm we're sure we don't have the kind of intelligence we claim to have where we gonna take out the sources are you know the Indians that lived in this country and all these other countries that did build all this kind of crazy stuff they knew what had happened somehow they must have known what happened in an illusion day you know history repeats itself if you if you think you could outsmart God by science investigating angels that right June says 1827 the Lord said because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know hallelujah you see it was just not just it'd been bad all alone but God sent a prophet hallelujah he walked as they angel down to Sodom and saw the condition says all Lord it's just like you said and it's getting worse hallelujah see a lot of time that people think that Sodom and Gomorrah was all about homosexuality that was true but it was all the other stuff too huh when you rich it increased with good and you think you don't need God you a sodomite who casada was rich that's why they God in all this trouble cuz they didn't you know that's the truth uh-uh somebody was talking I'm gonna call anyway he was it what dad excuse me anyways and why there's some people it's rich in sama Paul I said cuz God know who can handle it and who care I said all Christians are not rich and not all Christians are Paul I said but you know what those Christians who can't handle it God makes sure he gonna save them and I see here try you here try you and if you pass the test here give you more but if you see that your riches your blessing it's going to take you away from him you might as well know it ain't coming here just give you what you need you know what people tell you I don't care just give me what I need you know as I can make it you know I don't need to be rich I mean you know everybody like to be a little bit off but lord help me pass the test you know I told him I said could you know what you know I said that's what happens God give you a little something then you go acting stupid you know - sup it's - forgive me that's a bad word but I said you kids don't do something that's you know I even told a relative of mine I say just how God has blessed you and then you go do this help us Lord you know I you know a lot of times you know I'm gonna say did a lot of time at their times I've done that God blessed me with something instead of taking it and putting it toward the missions or something I go do something that's not meaningful or whatever nothing toward the kingdom and God spank you for that kind of stuff yeah so you have to you know you look at these things and you say well god help me help me help me but God is testing us to see how true we gonna be how faithful we're gonna be this is the war right this is a war and you heard me last Sunday you know the first voice to Eve after Adam was a serpent right and it is war she didn't realize she was in a war but the war had been initiated in heaven the Lucifer come down and places himself in the serpent disguise himself because you know the devil ain't gonna come to you says I'm the devil go pick that up for me and you know what if he said that you say you pick it up yourself you got hands but anyway my point is this it was there the battle began to rage and every since then it's increased you know and I know that the mind battles that we're having now is 100 or 1 to 10 I don't know how you want to say it but a few years ago we didn't have this and every year since I've been saying I remember you get a trial brother every now and again a testicle now is every day like God is like Joe before one tell finish telling the other I start their story somebody else is coming god is good to us anyhow he keeps his peace he gives us peace right Genesis 15 12 to 20 says and when the Sun was going going down now I want to say this to you because a lot of time we fail to see even though we in battle is the Lord's battle right but he has to give you a portion of it so that you can really appreciate heaven you can't go to heaven on a flowery bed of these doing all those saints in Smyrna and all the way up a being lost their lives and everything else and here we are in this Laodicea and I mean Laodicea and it's a time that you and I are fighting right now I don't know about y'all but I am fighting trying to keep on fire I hate the state of lukewarm yes I don't want to be cold and I hate the spate of lukewarmness so you got a fight to stay Oh fire hallelujah and when the Sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lower horror of great darkness fell upon him and you know the story how that God let him visit hell if you want to say in his sleep and while he was in his sleep and then he saw this altar he saw pieces being cut up and everything else and then this light that moved between the midst of the of the sacrifice and how God even in Abraham Abraham's sleep before he was even circumcised God comes right around if I could say it like that and show him I put you to rest while I fight your battle Abraham got up and the only thing he had to do is continue to fight those buzzards off those whatever they were and that's what Paul is saying contend for the faith don't let the road bread get a hold of this fight those brothers off and remember it is the sacrifice that gave you freedom it is his sacrifice that gives you rest it is his sacrifice Amen that delivers you from everything it is sacrifice is that right the Bible said that God said I can swear by no other I am totally for him I'm gonna make this thing happen hallelujah and my word is going out and it cannot come back boy those that are cursed because you remember now we're at a battle and we're battling those that are cursed by Isaiah 35 5:3 says for my soul shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon in dunya now that word means Edom and Edom means red and upon the people of my curse to judge you say who's the cars everybody who do not receive the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ they are the cursed the sword of the Lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats and with the fat of the kidneys of grams for the Lord have a sacrifice and bows Raju anybody know who that is and a great slaughter in the land of Edom do anybody know who that is as I said he came I'm gonna pose right you know and the unicorn should come down with them in the bullocks with the Bulls and their land should be soaked with blood and their dust meat fat with fatness for it is the day of the Lord's vengeance and the year of recompense for the controversy of Zion so understand and then this whole battle started when Lucifer said hi jealousy I will be like the Most High God I will ascend above the stars of heaven hallelujah and that those stars of heaven was literally the bride of Jesus Christ and Lucifer said I'm gonna sin and brother branham insane insane even he said everything he said he did it he even prophesied and the prophecy came to pass but he didn't even know that he was in the hand and a tool of God he was in the hands of God he's a tool of God that we might see it is God who reigns think about it when God that wasn't about said one age you're gonna take him and throw him in a lake of fire oh is this the man this the guy that caused all this trouble I'm just running to that a jury here Oh glory to the angel hallelujah in way of glory to the gut to God Amen you and I must understand we must not how can I see it if you love your brother remember the story the war was going on one of the brothers fell and the other guy picked him up somebody said leave him Libby's no he picked him up and carry the only shoulder and he says he ain't heavy he's my brother carrying a brother should never be heavy heavy in the midst of this war somebody help me here in the midst of this wall we ought to do everything we possibly can to make sure people continue to be saved we need the love of God to chase people we let them go and nobody's chasing them but God give us repentance God give us grace God give us mercy that we have the love of one another our duty is not to step down or to dump on one another but it's to lift one another up you don't have to one sense one person follow you know they're already down they need some words of encouragement is that Alright we're in a battle but it's not against the house of Zion we are battling everything that's not Zion in the spiritual you know everything that's happening in this world started with the religion what is true and what is not who is God and who isn't God right and you saw our Brotherhood it looked like Satan is winning the battle but did you know brother man who said it like that somewhat like that he said the Catholic Church would reign all the way through it or take God Himself to stop her that's how much power she's got all nations are under her hallelujah if she says stop the wall they stop it if she say stop the wall she starts it hey control bar she's got all the money all the go she's got the power nobody can stop her but Jesus Christ himself Heavenly Father people don't want to believe that but it's not just her the Catholic Church is it's all the promises do they all have drawn together and a powerful force and let me tell you this the only thing that could conquer this power is the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you receive the mark of the beast that's it people Oh Lord no I won't that's what the devil says he said let me tell you something you got a head around Joe you take that head around job and I'll make him curse you your faith and you know what that probably would have been possible but God told us that but you can do that but don't touch the oil in the wine you can you can Bellamy anyway but you better not mess with his life you understand me that is the only reason why we overcome it is the only reason why we cannot be deceived because the Bible said it will not deceive the very elect hallelujah that's the only reason because the word says so I am the father as we bow in that presence humbly as men and women our heart goes out in the deep sympathy of the sick and the needy and God in the midst of criticism and everything thou has taken us through every storm Lord and in that great day when we stand there we want to show battle scars that we've been on the battlefield I'm like yea our Lord we want to show the battle scars come on we can't just run from the battles we gotta face to him Josh can't run from him folks God has ordained these battles for you and me is that right Jew says when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints that means honesty fight dance America that's why the promise at all you got these these days of mister passing and your God is not the same any you know he cared what was he doing he was contending for the faith when he took that scripture Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he was contending for the vain if you've got that one revelation you'll understand the character of Jesus just by reading you understand he cannot change for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly being turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ it goes on to say in the time is at hand he says the time has come down for us to realize these things the time has come when God breaking the barriers down and the time has come that the devil is rising up like a wild lion going about roaring doing everything he can but the great battle is being set he said I wonder what it will be tonight and we could climb above the heavens of heaven and look at the great drama as his getting set together now fixing to come the pass of God and the devil coming down to a showdown I'm so glad that I am on the winning side I'm so glad that I follow the lamb because it said the lamb overcame dinner but he was a king of kings and the Lord of lords that's the time the time has come now for you to make a decision tonight what side you'll be on and I trust God you'll make the decision that you following the lamb hallelujah following the lamb I follow the lamb may God help us amen revelation 19 19 says and I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the throne owner on the horse and against his army and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and when and then that the worship His image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that said upon the horse which which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh hallelujah there's a supper there's a supper of the Lamb and there's a supper the great self of God amen to supper so you might as well do with the lamb supper right hallelujah amen of course the other supper won't be you feasting it'll be the birds the beasts of the field and you will be the meal huh God listen you see what I'm trying to say you can't stop this it's already around so I can hear the combine the sound of the company here you can't you can't worry you know but you've got to understand it's coming it's closer now than ever there will be a separation complete separation of the wheat and the tares and if the government is going to do it hallelujah just like it did it in Israel amen when they went down to Babylon he wasn't a whole lot of people they a lot of Jews that went down but God only talks about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel out of all those people they stood their ground may have been others I don't know but think about the few that stood alone and could say like Paul I have kept the faith let me tell you something when you keep the faith God will defend you he will fight your battles listen what he says for God has put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdoms over to the beast unto the Word of God until the Word of God shall be fulfilled so everybody every kingdom of this world may not even agree with the Catholic Church or the in communica Council but guess what God will put it in their hearts to do it they got to do it they can't resist it it is prophecy it must come to pass is that right think about all the preaching brother branham beard against authorization and denominations and everything else and guess what demons are carrying went enjoying the Pentecostal church together amen with the council as though he never heard it before he couldn't help it he was ordained to do so just like Judas hallelujah tell me Russia don't reign over all we don't reign over all there's one king that reigns over every body like that like Nebuchadnezzar I am running out in every one of them toes that's wrong wrong done dude do it as a nation it does is that a church every nation under heaven is - wrong no wonder they say who can make war with him he can say peace hallelujah every Catholic says it don't it don't fight and they don't fight that's all who was able to do what he can do nobody that's right so they wonder at the miracle he can do he can stop wars by the snap of his finger once boy then he can he have to say it stop that's all but you think he'll do it certainly not notice that sure that's sure they should kill one another they should kill each other his boy no arrow at first but his his great sword did he done his killing later and changed him white and white horse to a red horse the same exact devil with his sword what did Jesus say jesus said they take they that take the sword will perish by it don't fight back oh oh when the pressure come you can't fight back don't fight back all but I got this arm I got all these guns in my house oh you fight withers you're gonna be in trouble God won't back you you got to realize hey man God is gonna only back his word that Saint Peter who took a sword ain't meant to cut that man's head off walk empty-handed down there to get crucified upside down he didn't go to fight not in a way that they thought he fought him in spirit he went down as a soldier my goodness think about the scars hey man and now we know Peter as a conqueror overcomer hallelujah when they thought they were putting him to death it was really literally placing him in history hallelujah one of the greatest martyrs ever lived one thing for certain God showed us where he how he changed Peter right now remember he has he has got a sword he is going he is going forth a sword in his hand riding Red Horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagree with him hallelujah alright so when we think about this battle and the things that we're going through you and I must understand Amen that we've been ordained to do it and we've got investigating angels we've got God has already sent forth these things to show us and to prove to us that he's going to do what he said he's going to do now we're looking at all of these things and I was thinking the other day when I was thinking about this thought about Lord what would you have me minister and I'm at the end here because I want you to understand we cannot retreat but we need to set a little more fire to ourselves and the only way that can happen is that you got to ask God you got to pray more I got to pray more I'm I just I just just been I see I see it about a greater now than I ever have and I see more faith than me than I ever have but one thing I do know is I'm not a quitter I don't give up and I'm a table right some time that devil tells you you know you need to give it up you need to quit but if I quit what I'm gonna do where am I gonna go there's no place to go there's nothing that can satisfy you outside of Jesus you know I don't go I'm going that route already right I know he's the only peacemaker he's the only one that can come and call me down y'all know what I'm trying to say whether it be direct or indirect through a brother or sister God is the only one that that can work with me and handle me and you know I don't even know why you know how it is why it is but I'm gonna tell you something I have determined and I am determined to give God my best with what I have left give him my best but what I have left and I think everyone tonight we don't know when God is going to call our cars but we ought to be in a place determined like I says of engine your adversary and you and I need to be in that place where we're gonna say to God this is it I know who I'm fighting with I'm on the lam side I'm gonna place myself in this formation and understand folks we had seven great leaders see each age had a leader but we got seven seven angels brought this message seven warriors met brought this ancient message and you and I have all seven with authority to fight for us and with us and that great angel he's still here we need to start we need to get to a place where how do you go - no brother Brooks you'll know that the fire is getting greater when you learn how when you can't highly help but to witness to somebody the harder the fire the more witnessing you gonna do now they may not even receive you but you go to tell it anyhow because that's how I started when the fire was lit on the on the on those Jews they went to witnessing immediately you love the Lord blessed and they didn't care about themselves what they used to be where they came from who they were they talked about Jesus what Jesus had done for them I know it worth it then God is worth it to make is worth my daughter's is worth my living this word by giving [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
