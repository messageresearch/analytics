come with expectation we know that he's the same yesterday today he has not changed his hand has not changed either amen thank you for coming out on a wednesday night amen coming to the house of the [Music] amen but we came because of a promise jesus said wherever two or three are gathered right there in the midst and we put faith in that promise amen we know that he is here let's just uh open our bibles stand on our feet get right into the word of the lord we'll turn our bibles to first peter chapter five we'll read from the uh the eighth verse i'll speak a message tonight called they that wait upon the lord amen i know our brother preached a similar message recently and i think brother isaiah has touched upon it as well brother isaac and brother isaiah both and uh same time i think we were live streaming from arizona when when i heard our brother isaac preach on this message and and that same scripture from isaiah 40 had been on my mind for quite a bit and i heard our brother preach on it and brother isaiah came and touched upon it as well and then my mind that i wanted to preach on it and so the title tonight will be they that wait upon the lord amen but we're going to start from first peter chapter 5 the eighth verse it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion he walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered for a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you amen to be him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen i like that promise even though the enemy is going about be sober be vigilant resist him steadfast why because the same thing is it's not an unusual thing to you amen amen is the same devil he's gone about you seek all your brothers and your sisters amen but the god of all grace is the one that's called of us amen he's gonna after you suffer for a little while he's gonna make you perfect he's gonna establish you he's gonna strengthen you amen he's going to settle you amen now from there let's go to james chapter 4. just back a couple pages james chapter 4 verse 1. says from wits come wars and fightings among you come they not hints even of your lusts at war in your members you lust and you have not you kill and you desire to have and he cannot obtain you fight and you war yet you have not because you ask not amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer right there heavenly father we just approach unto you this evening lord on this day that we call wednesday lord but yet this is the day the lord that you have made lord and in it we will rejoice lord we give you all the glory and all the honor in it father lord all of us lord we've had our battles throughout the day though we've all had our struggles looked but we've come here at the end of the day lord knowing that that the strength of the lord has given us strength to overcome them all and lord it's upon you that we wait father that after all that we have done lord we've done all we've known how to do we've we've done all that we know how to do and after all that we just stand lord waiting upon you because you gave out the promise father that they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall rise upon their wings like an eagle lord and lord you shall give them strength lord and lord we're trusting in these promises father that we find in your word knowing that they are that there is not like the words of a man that might not have any backing behind him lord but your words have a backing that is as sure as the earth that we're standing upon lord that because you have put that word shallow there they that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strength we are putting all of our trust and all of our hope and all of our strength lord right there in that word shall knowing lord that you will come along after a little while and renew our strength we're trusting it lord we're praying all of our hopes in you father i pray you'll be a blessing to your bride tonight lord as the word goes goes forth in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen be sober be vigilant be careful look out your enemy of the devil he's going around he's looking for a loose spot somewhere anywhere he can find he's been by your house satan's been knocking on your door amen he's looking for a place where he can get in and battle you and the battle is as the prophet said the battle takes place in the mind back there in the garden of eden the the the the avenue of war was chosen the place where the battle for mankind was chosen that that battle would take place throughout from generation to generation that battle would take place in the mind of man and ever since sin that battle has been raging on and on and on and all of us are aware of it there is not one of us that can say that we didn't know that that's where the battle would take place we knew that was where the battle would take place we knew that when we started upon this journey that it wouldn't be an easy journey we knew that things would happen upon this life's journey that we wouldn't enjoy we knew that there would be times that would come upon our life's journey that that we would come to parts of battle so we might not win every battle amen but there would come times where we would stumble and we'd fall things would come and take place that we wouldn't enjoy where we get discouraged and we think lord how is it that you called me to this great high and holy calling and we could just see it so clearly in our mind the the perfectness of the calling the beautifulness the the the how precious it is the the holiest of holies that god has chosen to place inside the heart of man to where you get down into these places in prayer and you you just have these times of prayer where you just all of a sudden the peace that passes all the understanding watches over you and you also you see god high and lifted up and you know that they're that all things are the the god of all power has become your friend as jesus said i i no longer call you servants i've called you friends because a servant doesn't know what his master is doing but uh but our friend tells all amen and god in these last days has called us his friends because he's told us all that he is going to do through this message he has not left himself without a witness in this last day he has sent out the tapes he sent out the prophecies he's shown us what is going to happen in these last days he's called us his friends but for all of that the adversary the devil is still going back going around and the battle is still taking place in your mind amen but yet the saint peter there said there be sober be vigilant look out be watchful the battle is going to take place right there in your mind the enemy is going to come knocking upon your door he's he knows what your secret is he knows like like uh like what uh sam said he said their brother brandon was talking about samson he knows your secret he knows your weaknesses and he knows those are the areas that you have to keep bathed in prayer brother branham said because brother brad says satan has that one punch coming he's got a right to that one place he's got a right to come and punch you in that one place and it's coming it's a weak spot it's something there that he said and brother bran says you have to keep those areas bathed in prayer why because satan's coming and the battle is going to come it's not going to be easy but that's why god chose you but that's why god chose you because he chose a bride that that when the battle got hot and heavy that that that that bride would know how to come to him in prayer that bride would be one that would wait upon the lord because those that wait upon the lord they're the ones that are going to renew their strengths oh there's going to be many that the battle is going to come and they're not going to wait upon the lord there's going to be many that they're going to trust in their own strengths they're going to trust in their own dogma they're going to trust in their own religion they're going to trust in some moving of the spirit that came upon their flesh or some feeling or something else but there is a but there's going to be a bride that she is going to wait upon the lord she knows the secret of the lord jesus christ she knows the secret place why because she's met him on the backside of the desert she's met him in the prayer closet she knows who he is amen why because they've become friends i don't call you servants anymore i call you friends because i've shown you everything that's coming i i've given you the revelation through the tapes as you've listened to the message of the prophet as you've listened have you gone through the bible amen you've gone through all these things you've meditated upon the word of the lord and the revelation of the gospel of jesus christ has come upon you and when i saw that and when god saw that revelation open it up in your mind he says that's it i have called you my friend i've called you my bride and as you are waiting upon the lord all of a sudden here comes the strength of the lord amen you begin to rise up upon the wings of the eagle why because they that waited upon the lord they shall renew their strength i like that word shell that word shallow means a lot to me because if he said they that wait upon the lord might renew their strengths it just wouldn't have had the same promise to it but he says those that wait upon the lord shall you know i i i've had quite i've had a rough time these past few months just going through some own things in my own personal life and i've been beaten down i've gotten a little weak you know and i and as i've gotten a little weak i've turned my face towards the scriptures and i've turned my face towards this scripture it says they that wait upon the lord they shall praise god i needed that and i've been and oh i say for the last four or five months or so i've been taking that scripture to the lord in prayer i said lord you promised you said lord you said i would renew my strength you know what that means to me that there's a renewal coming i've placed that upon the altar of the lord where the blood of the lamb is where where where christ entered into the holiest of holies one time amen with his own blood to make intercession for us based upon our confession and i have confessed that i shall renew my strength because i have waited upon him amen even though my adversary he's going around like a roaring lion he's poking he's prodding he's trying to weaken us he's trying to do this he's trying to do this but yet i shall renew my strengths that word shell means everything to me because i know that the the renewal is coming oh i've had a battle we've all had a battle we've had a hard time coming we've had things that have come but they that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strength amen i was reading in the the book of daniel and i love the book of daniel if you could ever just one time put yourself in daniel's shoes because you know many of the prophets they grew up in a time where the temple was there and all those things but daniel grew up in a time where he was 500 miles away from the promised land growing up there and uh as a young man in babylon and hearing uh all the you know knowing where they had come from knowing the worship of the lord in the temple and knowing the promises of the lord in the promised land and yet for all that he's he's going to bed every night hearing the worship of the some foreign god off coming through the sounds of his window you know and hearing the bloodthirsty religion of the babylon babylonians and growing up surrounded by just all the foolishness of babylon and thinking lord i don't belong here you called me to a promised land you you called me to to to a place where i could bring my sacrifice to the temple door you called me to a place where i could bring my tithes into the into the holy place to that place where the pillar of fire came down over the holies of holies but lord what am i doing here in this babylonian system what am i doing here in this land where all these foreign gods are worshipped that that have no no no don't even exist all these false gods it reminds me of i hear people talking about sports and the super bowl and all these things and and they worship this and they worship that and and all the vulgarities you hear day in and day out and it just seems like you can't hardly find anybody that has the same vision that you do they see sports and the almighty dollar and i see angels and thrones and a heavenly kingdom it's like nobody's on the same page they don't seed eye to eye with us we've separated ourselves we've we've tried to keep ourselves clean from the world and we've we have a a heavenly vision we know that we didn't belong here like this cold weather that we've been having that they didn't have that cold weather in the garden of eden there's something in our flesh that cries out it's not supposed to be like this every time our we see with our minds something whether it be sinful or or of this fallen world and we think it's not supposed to be that way and that's the way that daniel the prophet daniel was he was there living in babylon all those year after year after year thinking it's not supposed to be this way it's not supposed to be this way god gave us a promised land amen hey i just want to turn over to uh i think it's daniel chapter 12. let's see if i can find it real quick one thing daniel had is he had access to the writings of jeremiah yeah daniel chapter 9 verse verse 2. i don't know where he had access to these scrolls or how he got hold of him but as he was reading the scroll of the prophet jeremiah he began to see something amen our revelation began to strike forth in daniel chapter 9 verse 2 it says in the first year of his reign talking about darius king of babylon king of the persians in the first year of his reign i daniel i understood by books the number of the years where the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he had accomplished 70 years in the desolations of jerusalem and i set my face unto the lord to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and i pray unto the lord and i made my confession i like that amen he made his confession there's something about revelation sometimes that drives you to confession amen you know when you he he he is reading there in the scroll and he began to understand that they were only supposed to be there 70 years and he and he began to count off the years of the reigns of each king and how long they'd been there and he's beginning to get to the realization that's been 69 70 years whatever it was at that time and he begins to look he's like oh my it's time for us to go back amen and when that revelation began to strike him that the 70 years were up the prophet jeremiah prophesied and says you're going down to jerusalem and you're going to be there for 70 years and now here daniel is reading the writings of jeremiah who's been dead and gone all these years and he's counting off the years and beginning to realize that it's time for the prophecies to be fulfilled amen and when that realization began to struck him look what his response was and so i got down on my knees and i began confessing i began crying out i began praying amen and it goes on down there and i'm not going to read this whole prayer but i want you to look over here at uh i think it's verse 18. just i just wanted to kind of give you a uh a glimpse of what his prayer was like in verse 18 it says oh my god incline thine ear and hear open thy eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplication before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies all the promises that god had given to the promised land was lying and waste jerusalem was lying as a burning heat they weren't fulfilling the promise of god for their day amen and these men he was beginning to time it's time for them to fulfill the promise and so he began to cry out and confessing and he says lord we're not caught they're not crying out lord because of our own righteousness we don't have any and so lord we're crying out for your great mercies we see what the promise says lord but when we look at our own flesh lord how can we do it we see what we what the promise of the hour says we should be but when we look down in our own selves lord lord how can we fulfill it amen he says in verse 9 oh lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake oh my god for thy city for thy people are called by thy name and he says while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and i was presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god yes while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel who i'd seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly he touched me my while he was praying while he was presenting while he was supplicated while he was bringing out his sins laying upon the altar crying out lord not my righteousness lord but lord i'm crying out for your mercies lord lord i see what the promise of the hour is lord but lord how can i fulfill it it's at that time that all of a sudden he was touched by an angel look what he says there in verse 23 what uh uh what then well you remember the angel says there in verse 22 sorry reading verse 23 he says the angel says to him at the very beginning at the beginning of thy supplications that commandment came forth look over at the look over at the next chapter of chapter 10 verse 12. and he said and he said unto me the angels still speaking to him fear not for from the first day that thou did set thy heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words the first day when you began to cry out to the lord well the first time you began to confess when you began to present when you began to lay your sins upon the altar when you began to catch the revelation of where we ought to be in this day where are we out to the children where the bride of christ ought to be in this day and when you begin to realize your shortcomings when you begin to cry out and and say lord i'm not rising up to the to the message of the hour i'm not in condition lord to to meet the promise of the hour lord when you begin to cry out for your shortcomings the very first day i heard your prayer and they that wait upon the lord they shall receive a time of renewing they shall renew their strength it's a promise it's got to happen it's got to happen oh we've had many mighty battles but let me tell you he's called us friends because he has shown us everything that he's going to do the seals have been ripped off the message has been given the book of revelation has been laid wide open we know that what we are waiting for we know that we're waiting for the rapture of the bride we know that we are that the the bride is going to make herself ready but if there is a promise of a bride making herself ready then there's got to be an ability given to the bride to make herself ready and that ability comes laying on your knees laying down your prayer amen is seeking the lord and he will send that renewal lord in our bride's revival amen amen it's been promised it's going to happen they that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strength it's been promised it's got to happen amen amen one thing i like about daniel when you read daniel chapter one it talks about the three young hebrew boys shadrach meshach and abednego and daniel himself and the four of them said that when they were chosen to present themselves to the king of babylon that they had to spend so much time being purified kind of like esther was they had to be purified before they went into the court of the king and so the the eunuch there he or the the the i forget what title he exactly had the man that was charged over them he he came to him and he put them in a special place there and he says i you're going to eat this special diet from the king of babylon and this special diet once you eat it after so long then you will then you will uh be ready and prepared to go in and and give service unto the king of babylon the king of persia and so when they began to look at the menu of the diet of the king of babylon and all of a sudden their heart said no no no no i can't eat this and they began to read the menu of all these things and their mind went back to the things that they've been taught as a child that thou shall not eat this thou shall not eat this to give honor unto the lord jehovah keep yourself clean from this keep yourself clean from that and when they went to go give service to the king of babylon they they went and they told the man that charged over and says we can't eat that and the man says you have to you have to partake of this if you don't partake of this what am i going to do when you present yourself to the king what am i going to do when you present yourself to the king and your and your faces are falling and you look weak and you're not eating from the king's table and they said we have a king that is greater than this king amen and he has given us a diet that is greater than your diet and it is to that king that we are going to serve as to that diet to the king jehovah that is the diet that we are going to eat of and there is nothing you can do to cause us to eat the diet of the king of babylon and it caused the man that charged over a lot of grief and he says what am i going to do i will be the king will have me killed if i try to present you to the king of babylon and he finds you weak and you haven't been eating from his table and so daniel and his wisdom he said try us let us eat from the from the diet of of the king jehovah amen of the god of jehovah that we serve let us try jehovah's diet for a little while amen just let us try jehovah's diet for these 10 days or whatever it was and then come and look at our faces and see if our faces are not brighter see if they don't shine see if we don't walk with a little bit upright step see if we don't walk with a little bit more confidence a little bit where we know where we're going and the king of babylon servant looked at him and says okay we'll try it and he didn't withhold anything from he said whatever it is whatever it is that jehovah said you shall eat i will give it to you you eat that and then after 10 days i'm gonna come back and i'm gonna give out the inspection and i'm gonna look and i'm gonna see what it what the what the what the the evidence or what the uh what the what the cause of this diet what the effect of this diet on your body will be as the ten days went on they faithfully ate the diet of jehovah for ten days and after 10 days the king of babylon's servant came up and looked at him and oh my they were walking their shoulders were rolled back there walking with a spring in their step in there their faces were shining and clean and and he said oh my this diet from this jehovah is all together a hundred times better than the king of babylon and so he allowed them to eat not from the king of babylon's table but from jehovah's table and we're living in a babylonian day mystery babylon is everywhere brother bran said don't you fear the iron curtain or the bamboo curtain or any of the curtains he says you fear that purple curtain you know there's so many things going on you say well i'm in the message but you know lukewarmness can get us tentacles around all over the place and none of us are immune to the the effects of the antichrist in this day amen you know you remember the story where brother brannon was walking through the woods one day and he was trying to cross a crick and he saw this looked like a sturdy log laying there and he grown across the creek and he went to go step on it and the rotten with the the log was rotten on the inside and he he thought it could hold him as soon as he put his weight on it it just crumbled under his feet and he began to fall down and he and he jumped back to the shore and he's like my look at this lock laying in the fountains of living water caused it to rot twice as quick and many people they'll sit on the church pews and they'll they'll rot twice as quick as someone out in the world there why because when they began to to to leave the table leave the diet of jehovah behind of prayer of dedication to the word of god of giving preeminence to lord jesus christ when they begin to no longer worship the lord jesus christ they they come to church and they got other things on their mind and they and they no longer have time in the morning to read their bibles they no longer have time in the mornings to to to to to to bow down in prayer they've left the diet of jehovah behind and now is coming the time not to present yourself to the king of babylon but the time is coming where we're going to present ourselves to the lord jesus christ and there's going to come a time in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the trumpet's gonna sound amen and then those that are ready are gonna go into a wedding feast and we're gonna the time is gonna prove who was waiting upon the lord and who had their strength renewed whose face was going to begin to shine whose shoulders are rolled back who's walking in faith why because they that wait upon the lord that even though the the enemy is going to come like a roaring lion he's going to poke you he's going to project he's going to try to knock you down to the ground but those that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strengths it's got to happen because it's been prophesied in isaiah 40 that it will happen amen and there's got to be somebody that's going to show up in the last days with their strength renewed flying like an eagle because it's been prophesied that it's going to happen but it's only going to happen to those that have looked at the diet of babylon and says i don't want to eat that amen looked at all these foolish movies and hollywood and all this different stuff and i don't want to partake of that i don't want to feed myself with all that instead they get ourselves down on their knees in prayer they open up their bible and they read their bible and they meditate upon the lord god their lord savior jesus christ because he has become their friend and he will reveal unto them the things that are going to take place amen amen daniel he began to realize that he was living in the last days of jeremiah's prophecy he's like oh lord forgive me lord i i know what the promise is but lord i'm falling short of what the promise is i want to keep myself clean i'm trying to keep myself pure lord you're you're you're the jerusalem is in ruins all of our people we're sitting here in babylon and we ought to be living in your land of all where all your promises are lord forgive us lord wash us bring us back to your promises because he was realizing that it was the time of the end amen and you know we're not in the end of 70 days but we're in the end of 70 times seven amen we're at the end of seven church ages and there ought to be somebody that's going to look at the promises of the gospel uh promises of a of a bride that has a lamp that's been trimmed that is brining the the shining brightly and she's gonna and she has been charged to shine light all the way from here to the wedding the wise virgins were given a duty to to well all 10 of them were all the wise and the foolish were both given a charge they were given a lamp and they are told use this lamp to shine the light from here to the wedding but when the call came out the foolish their light wouldn't shine anymore it's not they didn't have a lamp they had lamps they just wouldn't shine for and thy word o lord is a lamp unto my feet and a light into my path and everybody's got the gospel it's laying on a bookshelf in a thousand every household in america practically but who can get it to work who knows the author of it who's opening it up who's meditating on meditating on who is eating from this book amen that they can have themselves renewed amen amen who can testify i am the one that is rising up and riding on the winds like an eagle there's got to be somebody that's fulfilling this amen in the last days there's going to be somebody that is renewing their strengths who is it going to be it's got to be the bride of christ amen there's a prophecy laying there and woe unto us if we are not the ones fulfilling the prophecy amen so we ought to lay these this this diet this babylonian diet down and take the diet of jehovah of prayer of meditation of the promises of god amen amen why because they that have the prayer closet they that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strength amen i preached a while back a message called god's response to the cries of bondage and we took from it the children of israel after the forefathers died after abraham isaac and jacob and joseph all of them passed away they began to live there in egypt and goshen but after a while they began to be put into more and more bondage amen and as the bondage increased more and more and more that they got to a place that they just couldn't put up with it anymore and they began to cry unto the lord but you know the thing of it is is when god's people cry out to the lord it seems like they always cry out for a partial deliverance you know god's people when they cry out for deliverance they always seem to want just a partial deliverance they just want to be restored back to goshen or something lord just take us back to gosh and let us live in peace but you know god doesn't provide a partial deliverance if god is ever once gonna hear you if you get down on your knees and you begin like daniel presenting your prayer and you're getting along and crying out for the situations that you've got yourself into when you begin confessing all of your the times you've eaten of that babylonian diet now you try to give up some of that well i want to give up this part over here but i still want to partake of this i still want to partake of that lord i want to give this up but i don't think i'm ready to give this up yet you know when you begin crying out to the lord you know god doesn't provide a partial deliverance and so when you get god's attention and he looks at you crying out there for that partial deliverance that's not what he's going to send you no he sent them a moses that's right and moses wasn't interested in impartial deliverance no no he wasn't interested in just restoring them back to goshen or just give them peace in egypt so that they could enjoy their leaks and their onions and all the the delicacies of egypt oh no no he yanked them out of there he took them to a promised land they cry out for a partial deliverance which god does not provide amen so when we get out on our knees and we begin crying it may not be easy because god has an interest in bringing you to a total deliverance that everything would fall away you know when we come down and we come down to it and we get in those places like daniel was and we realize that the rapture is coming soon and we look at the condition of our lives and realize that we're not matching the need of the hour and we get on our knees and start praying god's intention is that you would come to a total and complete deliverance so we have come to the place where daniel stood there lord we're not coming to rely on our own righteousness lord but we're coming for our mercy lord we're just laying it down all upon the altar and i'm going to partake this daniel diet once more this diet of jehovah the diet of purity gospel purity amen a thinking man's filter amen lord i'm going to go partake of this once more lord and and then the bible says there in daniel that the very first day that he started crying amen god started listening amen we ought to put faith in our prayer that god as we are speaking as we are praying as we are confessing as we are presenting as daniel said there all those things to the lord that he is listening every bit and he has a walk for you to walk amen and it's but it's a walk of the bride of the lord jesus christ he says that the wise virgin rose up when the cry went out and she began to clean her lamp began to trim the wick she realized it was running a little low in oil but it's okay because she had another source of oil she knew where to go to refill her oil and that's what the wise virgin has in this last day that the foolish version doesn't is she knows how to get her oil refilled hey man so when the when the enemy comes like a roaring lion and he begins to feel like he's stealing your oil wait upon the lord you shall renew your strength the wise virgin's duty was to shine the light all the way to the wedding the gospel has to be working for you the word has to be alive in your life it's got to be a living word a living gospel then it's the lord jesus christ you gotta ought to have the testimony of what is god is doing for you now amen when you look on your life and you realize that all your testimonies are getting old you know you if you were to go and witness to someone all your testimonies are from two years ago three years ago four years ago five years ago and you can't testify anything that god is doing for you today wait upon the lord he'll renew your strength so you can testify that god has restored me and placed me upon the strong rock by his side amen let's just stand we read there in james 4. he said where are all these wars and fightings cut from among you where do they come from he says don't they come from the lusts that wore on the inside of you and we see people that are fighting and fussing and there's i see all the evidence of outside battles because there's a battle on the inside amen and when the battle comes to the inside it's because back in the garden of eden says that's where the battleground was chosen the battleground would be in mine but they that wait upon the lord the battle gets hot and heavy they shall remain and there will be a people in the last days whose strength will be renewed it's been prophesied they shall that's why you put the word shallow in there they shall rise up like nothing can keep an eagle down like a temporary storm might push it from heaven's heights as the song goes but that storm will pass it's got to pass because they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength be brought back to the garden of eden like the fall never took place never even took place it's a promise that's been given to us so be sober be vigilant [Music] maybe let's just bow our heads and word of prayer heavenly father we just right now in the name of the lord jesus christ like daniel in the book chapter 12 [Music] threw his windows open he'd been reading the prophet that went before him he began to realize he was living not just in the last days last minutes last hour he realized that he still had something to do now so he began presenting his supplication being praying and speaking confessing presenting his prayers before the lord and god gave the response and said as soon as you started praying all of heaven [Music] that overcoming power is on its way it might be might be fought and delayed a little bit here and there by the enemy but it shall come this is the prophet the bride of christ will be standing in the last days having done all lord it's prophesied to us we believe in it lord we don't rest on just our own righteousness lord lord what do we have we have lord we're trusting in you our flesh fails us all so many times lord lord we just say forgive us washes cleans us or let us get back up again be that bride of christ that proverbs 29 bride to the lord jesus christ all of [Music] thirty-one brides [Music] let us have that testimony that we waited upon the lord you renewed our strength and now we're flying like the eagle once more experiencing the overcoming power that was prophesied to be amongst the bride in the last days for we know where we stand we know who we are lord we let us we pray [Music] and they that wait upon the lord [Music] wonderful sermon amen those promises are true yes and amen amen let's sing a song [Music] you answered [Music] please [Music] shall return [Music] and not [Music] way [Music] my [Music] keep my eyes on me [Music] me [Music] me [Music] shall renew their strength [Music] shall oh in on me [Music] amen as we're dismissed [Music] oh your hopes up [Music] your hopes on things [Music] [Music] away [Music] oh [Music] oh why [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] me so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] you
