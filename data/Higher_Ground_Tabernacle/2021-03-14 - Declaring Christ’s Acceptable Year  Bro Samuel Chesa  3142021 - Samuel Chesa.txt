[Music] is [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] foreign in my life [Music] oh we all need that holy ghost on the inside because that's the only thing that can change is amen just before we read the scripture let us sing this song he says you made a way when our backs was against the walls he made a way he did the same thing for the children of israel they had a red sea in front of them and they had the army of pharaoh coming towards them but god made a way for them so if he did it for them he can do the same thing for you and me amen [Music] oh you made a way [Music] and we are standing [Music] backs were against the wall and it looked as if it was over [Music] there is nothing that's impossible and we are standing [Music] with your power [Music] that's impossible and we are standing here only [Music] and we are standing here only because you made [Music] let us open our bibles to the book of leviticus chapter 25 it's good to see everyone who made it to church this morning amen every time we come to church on a sunday morning commemorating the resurrection of christ hallelujah he's the only one who rose then shall thou cause the trumpet of jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make a trumpet sound throughout all your land and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family and open it up it only takes you the author of the word to make it known and for us to understand what you're telling us now we are gathered in this place in your house knowing you are a god that meets each and every appointment that he makes each and everyone came we came here lord expecting to hear from you i pray oh lord that you grant each and every heart's desire i pray oh lord that you answer each and every question so that when we leave this place we can say for sure the lord spoke to us for sure the lord was in this place and we'll forever give you thanks in jesus name we pray uh so just for a little while i want to speak on the subject declaring crisis acceptable here apart so in the bible where we read in leviticus chapter 25. god gave a commandment to the children of israel that on the 10th day of ever on the 10th day of every seventh month there was to be a day of atonement so once every year the high priest would walk in to sacrifice he walked into the holy of holies for an atonement for the sins of himself in the whole children of israel although law was in effect we saw god had already provided grace that he would forgive the sins that the people would have already made but now in verse 10 it tells us that in the 50th year it was a day of jubilee so on the seventh day of the on the tenth day of the seventh month of the 50th year it was a day of jubilee [Music] mode after every 50 years on this date the high priest would blow out the trumpet no matter how long they had been slaves trumpet of jubilee they would know it's time to go no matter what believe if someone committed a crime is secretary clinton they would sell themselves to to their creditors to the people that would have wronged the legion they would and their property their land that had been given to them from their forefathers was also was also taken away from them when the children of israel crossed into canaan and they were given this land if you had done wrong your land was going to take if you made it wrong it was taken so there were two types of slaves oh yeah if you do salt this lab this lava they were they were slaves that were the of the children of israel this and there were slaves that were not of the children of israel israel and now on this day of atonement when the high priest would blow this trumpet expeditionary only the slaves that were the children of the children of israel could go free solely those that had been free before but those that were not of the children of israel could not go so when we hear that gospel trumpet of jubilee it signifies freedom to you and me anyone else who is not a spiritual seed of abraham when they hear it doesn't mean nothing to them amen so when someone committed a crime or when they would get taken as a slave a loss you say they would lose their inheritance they would lose their property and they were owned by task masters and there was no court of law that could let them go free because it would it would uh it would attest that this person is a slave they are not a free person [Music] every person who would be bound they'll be at night they wouldn't sleep waiting for the daybreak of the of the tenth day because they knew that their past was over that their lives was about to change they were no longer to be slaves anymore amen those who had been separated with their families they knew they had to go back and they'll be counting down until that 50th year because they know this is my time for my freedom this is my time to get back my inheritance get that which i lost you but now you see you believe this was a choice it was not forced on people so when you hear the trumpet of jubilee you had to make a decision you had to walk out of that slavery if you were in the field you had to decide to leave that the instrument or whatever hole you were using if you refused to listen to the trumpet of jubilee that would make you a slave forever if your honduras love no trumpet of jubilee would ever be able to set you free if you if you refuse to get this to if you refuse to listen to this trumpet of jubilee amen amen grace is your inheritance promise to you and me for me on the cross of calvary to give you and me grace jesus christ the other time i talked about abraham lincoln's story of destroyed abraham lincoln there was a young man who was in the revolutionary war he ran away from his duties as a soldier and that's a very big crime concrete and he was sentenced to to stand in front of the firing squad and be killed but his friend went to see the president abraham lincoln and asked for forgiveness and say can you give pardon to my to my friend mr mison president abraham lincoln he signed a paper that says i president abraham lincoln i pardon you you are not to die came he faced the firing squad and he was shot and he died they tried to take uh them to the course of law to say why did you kill this man although he was pardoned by the president mercy has no effect on you until we accept so this was all typing oh the old testament was typing the new testament we have seen many instances where jubilee was shown in the bible he was right there and they were being tormented by the philistines and all his crops were being taken but then he realized and he said i am a son of abraham my forefather that i am not to be bound i'm not supposed to be a slave and he stood on that word of god and he walked out and killed 600 philistines with an ox god a resortie that you see see some uh philistine awake because even realize today was my jubilee he realized that this was the day he had to be set free he accepted it amen let us open our bibles to luke chapter 4 verse 17. controversy luke chapter 4 verse 17 it reads and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord what verse is that verse 19 to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book either and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down. verse 21 he says and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears so we realized that jesus when he was in the synagogue he opened the bible to isaiah chapter 61. the whole verse says to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn university but when jesus was reading this scripture he didn't read the whole scripture he just read to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled so he was only reading that part that applied to his ministry then in that day inaudible to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord jesus was coming on the scene to say this i am the real jubilee he picked up the scripture and read and then he laid the book down and say today this is and say today the scripture is fulfilled when he was to preach the year of jubilee now why didn't you read the rest of it because the other part pertains to his other comics they had no need to know that that was for another age but the age that he was and that's the reason he could say this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes today to praise the acceptable season season [Music] so jesus was saying this is my mission on coming down on earth i have come to set you free all the priests that had come in the old testament that had come to an end and um it says the acceptable year as we all know the prophet says the year of jubilee that's when all the slaves and prisoners as they were being taken prison syllabus and they were in bondage is it no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of jubilee when the trumpet sounded acceptable time the time of jubilee anybody no matter who you are no matter what color you are what denomination you belong to it doesn't matter what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound outside so when he read the scripture he says i am here to set all those that are in bondage give sight to the blind he came in as our kinsmen redeemer called amen that's why he died on the cross we are the closest we're the closest kid we were to jesus we are the closest king to jesus christ jesus and us we are all abraham's seed in galatians it reads for ye are the children of god by faith in jesus christ and if you be christ then you are abraham's seed it is according to the promise so the moment you accepted christ as your savior you became your kinsman allah [Music] so he was the only one who could who was able to pay the price of redemption for you and me to redeem us from the slavery that we were in he came to take away our sins to erase all of it live newly fashioned and he says you are justified you and me we are justified [Music] when he pay the price you say you never did it in the first place he put it back on the devil and said you are the one who made him do it he is not guilty so you can stand clean blameless and justified when jesus comes and he's when he came and he was preaching the acceptable year of jubilee to you and me that has no effect until you accept it god came down from heaven and he put himself in the body of jesus [Music] when he was on the cross of calvary with his last breath he cried it is finished it is finished that's when you were healed so it is already there you just have to claim it and accept it when he cried it is finished the devil thought he was saying he is finished before the foundation of the world was available and he was still lucifer and we know in the old testament before jesus died on the cross satan had power of death he went to satan's kingdom and he overcame and took the keys of death helen the grave and when he rose up on the third day he was victorious he said the whole the authority that adam had before he was returning it back to us because when adam fell he lost that power so when he rose victorious he was giving it back to you and me those that believe that jesus christ died for them you and me we are the bride of christ here is the tragedy if a man did not desire to go back and he wanted to remain there then his master would walk up to him and say you desire to still be my slave then if you say yes then they'll take them down to the temple took them before the people of vandalism as a public testimony and put his ear up against the post and they would make a hole in his ear [Music] and that person could never be free again there was no trumpet of jubilee that could set them free [Music] and it was a public testimony that this person is forever a slave that people are receiving the holy spirit you deliberately and willfully turn it down god has no more not under any obligation to ever speak to you no more and to reject christ and to turn him down after he is knocked at your door you're on the danger line of being bored in your ears when the word of god tells you to do something you don't want to do it why because [Music] why you are refusing the person refusing the trumpet of jubilee refuse this year people have a right to do whatever they want people want to do things their own way they choose people say you cannot judge me yes we cannot judge you but the word judges you wait someone says the word says that but my church says that this is you are not being set free you are bound by chains of your church but i have good news for you christ when he said it is finished that was a jubilee for you and me all we have to do is accept and move into it and say lord what do you want me to do what does your word say about me his mission was to preach jubilee to you submission doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil um so some people have willingly gone to the devil and say i want to be your slave to something selling yourself to addictions things you know that the world says that's not right people have sold themselves to be slaves but i have good news the jubilee didn't care whether you had sold yourself or it was circumstances to go steal but calls the cops on you afterwards but he is doing that so that he knows the moment you cross the line you will be judged by god but you just have to know if you resist the devil he'll flee away from you overcame satan by the word he eventually left him why because the word says resist the devil and he will flee away from you if you run away from every appearance of evil because the devil he wants to bind you he wants to get you in that place of an addiction he views on me don't sit down i've seen and you cannot get out of it eventually because the moment you start reading so satan wants to get you to be so busy with things it has all it has to do for you it has to set you free because god says i know the plans that i have for you the plans for you to prosper the prosperity it doesn't matter whatever situation you are in a situation the prophet of god said so if you are lukewarm brother that's a dangerous place you could stand the prophet did you decide that's the thing we get so accustomed to a nice easy life where we are lukewarm we are borderline one leg in one leg out um if we come to church and go back home that's good enough attend a few services that's then that's good enough you haven't even started christianity is a bondage the the system it is a sticky on isla god does not want that no no god doesn't care you either you come to church or not you were supposed to come to church because that's where he's going to meet you but that's not where it ends so after you hear the word what are you gonna do about it that have nothing to do with god but god does not want that in the house of the lord there is liberty it is the anointing that breaks the yolk that breaks the so when you come into the house of the lord you see this is my place to be free because jesus came to search you and me free we just gotta rise up and walk amen because he had already already has opened the way for us amen amen already called the prophet of god say christ defeated satan the prophet christ of everything he ever had um and he is nothing today by the bluff when he tells you we cannot have another holy ghost outpouring of the spirit we can have it today why because god rules and reigns today hallelujah so you and me we can live an experience of the living god because he overcame death hell on the grave the curtain that was on the that was in the temple it ran from top to bottom because the priesthood of aaron was no longer of no effect the priesthood of aaron who had was no longer of effect muscular sacrifice jesus christ now the high priest that starts by the feeling of our infirmities he was coming in to give us grace according to us he totally delivered the world from sin amen he delivered the church so there is no there's no need for us to leave underprivileged because he defeated the devil and took the principalities and powers the principles the devil doesn't have to dictate anything to us christ delivered us from all habits he delivered us from all talking he delivered deliverance total so the title deed that you had to your land when the when the trumpet of jubilee sounds is given back to you [Music] ever it doesn't matter how much buildings they had put on your land very importantly the trumpet of jubilee was giving you back the rights you had before the fault the trumpet did you believe zach did it before you lost what you had the trumpet of jubilees giving you your rightful possession no one can stop you the holy ghost that will make that person leave that squatter he has no right all you have to do is realize that the trumpet of jubilee is setting me free for total restoration hallelujah the prophet of god gives us a story of this crow called old johnny crow the prophet this crow was tied by a farmer so that the other crows could not come and eat the crops when they see this crawl tight they'll be scared and run away but one good man came and he cut off the rope the the rob that was tying this old crop but although this rope was cut boy he kept on walking in a circle in the place where he was he was uh tied and it was bound in physical martial we still want to stand in the place of being bound because he came to restore us to the position where we were before thank god for our jubilee it makes us realize our identity we are normal slaves but we're a child of god the singer said i am no longer slave to sin but i am a child of god but because he came to make you realize your identity i am not a slave to the things that used to hold me before slav i'm a child of god no depression can hold me back anymore no low self-esteem can hold me back anymore because i know i'm a child of the king i am not a nobody um you are a child of the most high god amen you got to walk in faith not in fear um faith is not uh and i think so la funny is worth a thousand worlds that's good that's why the devil is finally more hard to take you down you realize who you are that jesus christ paid his blood for you you know that you have a lot of value and that day that's when the devil lost it so you gotta stand and take your rightful place chase the devil away from your land you have each and every right to get it back it is time to rise and claim whether it healing and you've been falling sick that's your property when god says it's yours it's yours no one can first salvation is yours so when the devil tries maybe you have lost your financials you have lost your job yours the inheritance says that's yours you have the future of every rightful he said you shall be the head and not the tail and not beneath it inheritance it doesn't matter even if you're in school you're having bad grades we're important you go to the devil and you say the inheritance says i'm above and not beneath the power and also your loved ones you can also get them out someone was bound and they couldn't walk out a kinsmen redeemer would come and take him out if you have a loved one that's being tormented by cancer you can go redeem them to multiple concepts or high blood pressure that's not a fact it might not be affecting you but your loved one you walk to the devil and say you know that you don't have no right no more merciful i don't care whatever pretty name they might try and give it that's the task masters change it's only changed you don't have to care about that just go and claim it that's your inheritance he was sitting in a wheelchair for six to six years um but when he was prayed for he realized that this was my jubilee is because he accepted his jubilee so it doesn't matter how many years you've been in a situation you've been praying to god for over 10 years to say lord please help me and you have been failing to get out of it visit me up here this is jesus is in a sickness or whatever affliction [Music] it doesn't matter how long it has been doesn't matter what it is just walk and get going you have the right to enforce it because there is power in the name of jesus break every chain no oppression that can hold you back chains of sin [Music] all you have to do is your lost beloved ones for your loved ones we have lost their way you can still proclaim that jubilee to them whether it be i claim the blood of jesus on them because it is effective if you've worked on you it can also work on them whether it's your grandmother your grandfather husband god amen upon our feet it was because of his love that he set us free we were all sinking deep in sin because of his love he set us free amen hallelujah we thank god for his jubilee we thank god for his love sending his only begotten son just stand up and say those things that used to hold me they have no effect on me no more hallelujah let us sing this song love lifted me [Music] so oh i was sinking deep in sin from the peaceful troll very deeply stained within sinking to rise no more [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is [Music] song faithful loving [Music] service [Music] lifted [Music] me [Music] else [Music] he is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm [Music] nothing [Applause] [Music] let's take else [Music] [Applause] [Music] is nothing else [Music] hallelujah how many are glad and can say now i've been set free because god gave his son and his son gave his life nothing else could help because you saw us worthy but you came and blew the trumpet of jubilee inheritance and this afternoon
