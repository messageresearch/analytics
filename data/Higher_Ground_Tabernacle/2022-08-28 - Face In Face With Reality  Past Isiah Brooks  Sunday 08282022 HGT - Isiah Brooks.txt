we have a brother who can interpret for you this morning uh if you need interpreter service underneath [Music] as they get prepared you love the lord remember lucino um let us think let us turn to psalms 34. and from psalms 34 we go to first samuel 15. um uh before i uh close out my service this morning i have a few things i like to say to the church so avon i hope to god i hope that you're not in a rush the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit amen many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all literally first samuel 15 and samuel peter kansas we'll read the 23rd verse there john only of the events um for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king resistance we thank you for your amazing grace you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and forgive us for anything we may have said or done that has not been pleasing in your sight but we pray father this morning that you'll look beyond our faults and see our [Music] in your lovely name jesus christ reality it is very difficult for people to face reality and oftentimes it deform instead of facing reality reality they blame others for their shortcomings when we talk about reality lost to know that this thing exactly actually exists exist that my personality had the ability of swinging from left to right or from right to left in just a moment and it all depend on what was said to me what was done to me that would put me in a bad mood and to be in a bad mood it's not to be under the influence of the holy ghost uh perception but others have thought the same thing the message is not only the message god still a prophet prophet but we must understand that when william branham did come on the scene pilasko william he had the message of elijah denominationalism now i don't know how long you've been in the message like this what's coming to the message hallelujah so let me say it like this listen the bible says that the world will know that you are his disciples because of the love that you have one toward another example hallelujah but in galatians when the christians fought and when they went through all of these changes in corinthians where the prophecy is being made clear la prophecy andrew claire hallelujah you know this is going to be a tough message on some of you all if not all of you all it was a tough message for me so i i've got mine and now you got to get yours we're not living in darkness and we must come under we're not living in darkness and we must understand if this message is not changing is that the believers in the message many of us have not crossed over we're still wandering in the wilderness we're stealing our own cells and ourselves we're still murmuring against moses when the message have given us but the bible says [Music] we're the whole world will become will go totally insane only those who are the brides of christ hallelujah will remain in in their same mind for a long time but now that i see the attack my mentor when she believed 1965. he said the human brain is rodney and the reason why it's rottening hallelujah because everything is being hybrided from animals these are humans humans everything dude we're living in a perverted age hallelujah anyhow see what we must realize is that the holy ghost is the only thing that's going to get you through this shows you see your religion won't work you can come to church every day you can pay your tithe [Applause] you've got to have the holy ghost hallelujah and what's so frightening in sikhi people it's because many of the people in the message married the system of the message to somebody else come in contact with jesus i'm talking to everybody in here and because this religion has been passed on to you pascal many of you you have been brought up but it was the message system systems and the only way you're going to overcome this is that you've got to press through the system jesus christ yourself face to face fast with reality you need to examine yourself to see whether you pee in the face it's been a long time since i've seen broken and contrite spirits people weeping at the altar seeking the baptism of the holy ghost it's been a long time since i've seen people repent face-to-face reality reality if you don't repent you won't make it repentance is something christians do repentance but what is it when you're under the influence of witchcraft you're not yourself is that right so why and it comes right down to the fact that you're stubborn you feel like you got a right but that's what god is building a civilization god is building a civilization all about education hallelujah but understand what that can do will do for you my components you're not born again will make you think he had to let all because sometimes people look at me like they can do something very unfair god didn't give you a pastor who fears dreams there's not a person in here you might can whip me but like i tell people [Music] i don't think you want to try that sparkle see i've seen people do things that just turned out really bad juvederm we're building god is building a civilization of faith you understand what i'm saying listen let me tell you something a lot of times people call themselves christians and you're looking at what you call it tic tac i want to say top tick but take that what's that tick tock [Laughter] that's filth see the and all that is is transforming or deforming your mind satan is the prince of the of the air the most disappointed people there's only predictions in this entire world we'll be message people this is your time to make your call in an election sure no this is not some great revelation this morning i'm trying to work with you i'm trying to work with the inside of you right now you don't see the flood you don't see this place and you think it's normal it's not normal this is not a [Music] yourself into witchcraft they don't have the food hallelujah it ain't the one that flies on the broom you ought to be afraid of separating um on ballet it's that mystical thing that you can't see mr but [Applause] itself is certain made him step out of the will of god hallelujah right right amen god said kill everything to chosen and i'm telling you right now you better let the holy spirit in you kill everything kill everything that means your selfishness that means your temper that means that is not of god it has to die and your of inequity when you know to do good and you refuse to do it if my voice is in the foul let me tell you something it's only general you don't even have to have the holy ghost to know what right from wrong yeah i hope y'all enjoying this message because we need to examine ourselves don't let him make you think you got it all together when you don't um hallelujah you you know what i'm saying it's like gossiping people stealing you haven't overcome that no thank you y'all still carrying on normal there'll be no gossipers in heaven god's opinion backbiting and all that kind of stuff that's not even in my notes but the holy spirit is talking about parlor yeah it's true so why i can't hardly trust nobody because there are times i've talked about yeah when i see people coming up in their spiritual lives james said if you can write on this hallelujah you're naked when you came bride or this town was it news your religion don't mean a thing what a religion hallelujah people look at you say well i know a christian ain't supposed to act like hello this is a scientific civilization and that's what he has killed the people where it's a secular treaty you say i'm not dead but let me ask you something where is your joy amen you come in here with no joy why you don't have joy because the holy spirit is standing away from you muscular sentences he hasn't loved you but you've done too much of this it's not what goes into the man that defiles him comes out that defiles him look this dream and that's what he has killed the people with it's a sickie that's really jealous that's what he's killing us nutrition everything his own perverted to chosen to even take just so much of this just you see and mix it with this illuminati inhabit this and that is foreign you got to press through this darkness everything's perverted but the word and even when it comes to the words well first of all oh where am i you're not the only one you're not the first and you're not the last one hello can i read from job job job the third chapter beginning at the ninth verse come on people i'm not picking on you i need to help you she said my whole point is this i'm trying to make a rapture just say that and i trust that that's what you're doing is you're sick of julio god don't care about your personal feelings because first of all you're supposed to be dead to those feelings and when you feel when you find out you're not dead hello people can call me a devil all they want to do i know i'm not a devil she said she probably i'm not the one who's deceived you understand me god told peter get thee behind me satan and peter was not a spiritual man at the time um if the lord had said that to me i think i would have found a hold and dug it in because i would not have been able to interpret it no other way he just called me a death but peter knew that this man had the words to eternal life the message comes from the preacher's preaching and the preacher's preaching you need to repeat i want to be just like god in the very image the likeness of god the imagination i don't know what it takes to get there you don't know when you're going to die that [Music] it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb no here sorrow from mine what is job saying why could not i have died at birth he is depressed he is in a deep darkness it's midnight for job hallelujah and he's wishing that he was dead which i know he's sweating sometimes work experience without you've got to suffer in order to is [Music] the lord is my shepherd [Music] [Music] is he prepared it and all of us it does we get in this situation i just can't take it now no absolutely no no no no no no you gotta be tried got to put you on the potter's wheel he's got to form and fashion you he's got to put the pressure on you hallelujah you understand me he takes his hands and he mows you by the five-fold ministry of the presence of the party's will sometimes your life feels like you're going around [Applause] trying to make you into his image for me as an imager 11th verse says why did i not from the womb then had i been at rest see he had a rough time and none of us a person nobody in here person is he has had a more rough time are you a moment than joe jobber and we'll get in our rooms and we say why me lord do you want to make heaven are you bright somehow jesus didn't go to calvary he did not go into into the garden of gethsemane nepali don't don't don't get i can see my name asking the question he understood his purpose no you got [Applause] and because he's righteous he gave us his righteousness he gave me his righteousness amen the bible says holiness without love sanctity no man shall see god son lassen personally you see when it came to isaiah isaiah thought isaiah was all that um azaya izai she said you're okay anyway he was high and lifted up oh he said the lord was not this is only but uh uh ozius was yes that's what happens to a lot of us don't you get it wrong no no god is real you have been israel for 40 years and she was dead and didn't even know it in las vegas and yet you go on like you're living in the eyes of god you're dead until you repent amen [Laughter] i felt like brother diggs just now hallelujah god holiness is incomprehensible that's empty me don't don't sit good all the minerals and all the ingredients of the ocean hallelujah but we think if we understood holiness we would find and they covered their faces but we're standing up like something something there's a lot of people with long hair i like a long shift whatever you call alone long dresses the longer we went to the church every day still yet they went to hell because they did not know the lord jesus christ this ain't about religion the prophet did that give us religion the prophets you know what he brought with him jesus christ amen coming from the message thirst predication but when he got there in the temple that day lost stand in the presence of god is it daniel the voice of his own faces in [Music] let me tell you something i will never justify sin no sir no and i am never going to be one that's going to take sides with any of you asian people [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] those are not my words that's brothers brother we are we supposed to make excuses for each other [Music] read your message theology and stuff is face to face with reality reality that's the point when you come face to face with realities you'll i didn't play in this message he planned this you know what i'll stand with the christian any day and every day but i'll never stand with the sinner position against the christian contro and there he was face of faith with reality he is we love the lord what was he saying i'm face to face now i see calvary calver one thing that's sinner on the right says lord i'm [Music] and he says lord have mercy on me that if satan can get you divided your children are endangered and the reason why wives and husbands have i know y'all think that some of y'all do she's not your slave and they probably was love and if you really love her like christ loved the church let me hear some heavy voices amen all the brothers keeping quiet you gotta is that the bible mr bible what a challenge you see but husbands love your wives christ loved the church come christopher emily gave himself selfies you're supposed to love your wife treat it like a queen tell my wife i said you keep treating me like a queen and i do is your little thing i wish she was here to say amen just return and guess what when i do wrong he said i'm sorry since you've been married you walk around like she'll understand what my comes says she'll get over it or if i if i know she's not going to get over it no it's because women are not made like this they need to hear i'm sorry so after this morning go home and say i'm sorry i don't care satan was our slave master but you gotta thirst for reality they have our soft love yeah break through this denominational stuff hello you gotta break through your system of culture no it's not no the only thing that's 100 percent is the word of god i'm gonna get somebody upset you gotta break through that you know you see a man helping his wife too much they think he's assisted [Music] shame on you brothers if you think helping your wife is going to make you a sister within my prophet must have been won hello because he showed i ain't putting no but he did you literally stay destroyed i don't go that far i don't do the apron thing but i will help with the dishes put this on i'm like new that ain't happening let me move on but the point is middle poinker you're moving in a way that your children are learning from you and whatever they see you do it they're going to do bad habits and you gotta you gotta you gotta move through that it would defeat avon stevenson can i say it like this i came from a real rough family family hello oh some of y'all came through angels what for me they dealt drugs they had prostitution in yeah because that bad nature it's my family my family was in me i knew the only way to change it yes you must be born again the nature of christ otherwise all your family is going to come up in your life dude now if children has come up under that kind he talk about the system you see under that kind of teaching syllabus they have the nature of their parents we're under the words to say when i came to the message some of the things they taught me was not according to what malachi 4 said on a cohort but i would have never known if i hadn't studied for myself and i had to press through all of that in order to be the preacher i am now hallelujah you said what do you mean brothers supposed to be led hello and they looked at him he was crazy let him cast the first stone let's get that you need to make that sister to that confess you need to make her tell how it started to tell her that she need to give uh tell the church all she's done i'm so glad this is joy i'm not a sister you should fighting sir and i'm so glad it's true joy i don't go to that church because you've been don't say that they came from this is me whoo i just assumed some of y'all sleepy i'm almost done on somebody you know what i know y'all going to spend a lot of time out there out there under the sacred tree so i'm distracting i'm taking some of your time right now see the bible says according to saint john 9 4. jesus said i must work the works of him that sent me should i fail deserve a complete result for this it is day alone the night cometh when no man who can work you know what i'm trying to bring all of us to excuse come on i'm gonna move on do i wanna see let me read what brother adam says in the message thirst this is the reason why i'm saying peter did hallelujah have the holy ghost even though he was elected of god he literally failed and jesus said if you fight with the sword you will die by the species when paul heard about the rumors of wars and lost i know what prayer can do jesus christ prefer i know what confessing can do jesus call a confession and i don't know about you but god has given me something here in this church i know i have bride in this church hallelujah and i'll let nothing else stand in my way from doing what i know god wants me to do who felt good let me say it like this that means because this is what god saw in his vision we're i'm serious i'm very serious [Music] i don't have time for foolishness i know y'all think i'm so soft some of y'all but you have to say you've never seen the lion turn the lamb turned to a lion you haven't seen it but there's a lion in here sure is is that right that's all right he made us kings and priests lafayette during the white is sacrificial thirst la suave then i think somebody told me that over in congo y'all can sit for seven hours don't worry i'm not gonna keep your sabbath i just i said that they get a smile on your face i think david in the writing of the psalms must have been in it really that's when god says could you get down to when we fast many times to get ourselves in position to get ourselves maybe you [Music] many of us need to do at least a fast up to 12 noon god gets us in right corners they were going alone easy daily sir in the darkest hour they had ever seen all their hopes were gone they have been put out of the church um the synagogue some women [Music] um you know we all no no no no no no because when you die not only do you ride but so so does your clothing you see wasabi so that's nothing hello um i'm almost done okay we're living in the age of lust under converts the people are blind the jeans some of the sisters are blind so then because it comes out of hollywood hollywood wearing what they call skinny jeans nobody want to see that person when i first saw skinny jeans jeans trying to show his figure he said something's wrong like they said he got a little sugar in his coffee call me this was a cafe and when you see sisters lost sir where out god don't care how long they are apparent but you worrying you're dressed like you're a mermaid mermaid whatever that is a fish got your dresses fitting you like fish skin portable oh my god sometimes even in this church i have to look up definitely no i'm a red-blooded man no no i'm a man got eight children it's just humongous jesus and i still battle in the flesh hello y'all can look at me like i'm great i don't know but i you can't tell me you brothers sitting where y'all sitting in them sisters and you could no no no should i get real let's go i'm coming to face reality you can see the print of their undergarments ain't nothing holy about that that's a lovely spirit santa's foot you can't see it because you got lost staying with the brothers you're not excused about the exclusion that's why we don't like all that twisting i know ain't nothing wrong with moving a little bit but i was at i was that somewhere in that that one somebody was twisting so i'm like oh my god when i'm looking in the audience what is she doing that for and i know certain moves don't come from the holy ghost face to face with reality professor reality i'm trying to help us here just say the disease not trying to cut anybody down listen the devil got a hold on you the day you see my wife look like that you tell me

don't want me don't patron wake up and smell a coffee well until you make it right all of our actions every every attitude even in your mind so you don't have to deal with me with him and you need to
