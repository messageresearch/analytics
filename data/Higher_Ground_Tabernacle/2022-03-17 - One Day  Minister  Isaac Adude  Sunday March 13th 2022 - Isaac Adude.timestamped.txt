[34:25] of jesus christ amen amen
[34:28] amen let's turn
[34:30] to
[34:31] james chapter two
[35:00] even so faith
[35:02] if it has no works
[35:05] is dead being the lord
[35:07] amen yea a man may say thou has faith
[35:11] and i have works
[35:12] show me that faith without words and i
[35:15] will show you my my faith by my words
[35:18] amen there are believers
[35:20] that there is one god amen there does
[35:23] well the devil the devil the devil
[35:26] the devil will also believe and tremble
[35:30] but we doubt no o man man the faith
[35:33] without works is dead
[35:35] was not abraham our father justified by
[35:38] works
[35:39] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[35:41] the office amen
[35:45] how faith wrought with his words and by
[35:48] words was faith made perfect amen now
[35:51] verse 23 the bible says that and the
[35:53] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[35:56] abraham believed god and he was imputed
[36:00] unto him for righteousness
[36:02] and he was called a friend of god amen
[36:05] let's go to first peter
[36:08] chapter one
[36:12] read
[36:14] verse 3 to verse 9.
[36:18] first peter chapter 1 verse 3
[36:23] the bible says
[36:25] blessed be the god and father of our
[36:27] lord jesus christ
[36:29] which according to his abundant mercy
[36:32] has begotten us again unto a lovely hope
[36:36] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[36:38] the dead amen to an inheritance
[36:42] incorruptible
[36:43] and undefined and undefiled
[36:47] and uh
[36:48] and that faith another way preserved in
[36:51] heaven for you
[36:53] who are kept by the power of god having
[36:56] faith under salvation
[36:58] ready to be revealed
[37:00] amen marine he greatly rejoiced
[37:03] through uh don't know for a season if
[37:07] need be
[37:09] you are in you are in heaviness through
[37:13] through many four temptations
[37:15] that the trial of your faith being much
[37:18] more precious than gold that perishes
[37:21] though
[37:23] he betrayed with fire might be found
[37:26] might be found
[37:27] unto praise and honor and glory and the
[37:30] appearing of jesus christ amen whom
[37:32] having not seen he loved amen in whom
[37:36] though now you see him not yet believing
[37:38] amen you rejoice with joy unspeakable
[37:42] amen now verse 9 receiving the end of
[37:46] your faith
[37:47] even the salvation of your souls
[37:50] i'll read again the verse eight because
[37:51] i really love it
[37:52] he said if peter says uh whom having not
[37:56] seen he loved that's right in whom
[37:59] though
[38:00] in whom though now you see him not yet
[38:03] believing
[38:04] you rejoice with joy unspeakable amen
[38:07] lord amen
[38:09] amen you may see that
[38:13] the symphony i really have a really
[38:15] small uh
[38:18] but god's grace i'm wanting to bring
[38:20] and uh
[38:22] they tied at least faith piece of
[38:23] revelation
[38:26] and faith is a revelation i will start
[38:29] with the prophet uh and uh
[38:33] the message works his faith uh which
[38:36] what's his faith expressed in paragraph
[38:38] 105 the prophet says that now faith is a
[38:40] revelation from god
[38:42] now faith is a
[38:44] revelation there is where i want to stay
[38:48] there just moment it's a revelation
[38:51] that's right amen he has revealed it to
[38:54] you by his grace
[38:56] it's nothing you did
[38:57] you didn't work yourself up into faith
[39:00] amen you ever
[39:02] you ever have faith
[39:03] it's given to you by the grace of god
[39:06] amen and god reveals it to you
[39:09] therefore faith is revelation
[39:11] and the whole church of god is built
[39:13] upon the revelation
[39:15] amen amen revelation
[39:17] is a really strong uh a very important
[39:21] thing that the bride of christ needs to
[39:23] have amen amen because there is a
[39:25] difference between like i said i think
[39:27] last sunday or the previous one
[39:30] that there's a difference between
[39:31] knowledge and revelation amen in my
[39:34] knowledge if you have a knowledge amen
[39:36] you know that god is real and god you
[39:38] know works miracles that god you know
[39:41] promised us good things in the bible and
[39:43] you know god can do this god said if uh
[39:46] if you say to this mountain to be
[39:48] removed and that mountain will move i
[39:50] mean if you have that knowledge it's
[39:51] good
[39:52] but that knowledge when when when
[39:54] temptation comes or when difficult
[39:57] you meant that knowledge don't stay for
[40:00] no no
[40:01] you need a revolution yes it's a
[40:03] revolution he's an anchor
[40:06] when when you have that revolution you
[40:08] can't be moved
[40:22] know that this is really true amen it's
[40:25] like for example uh uh uh i also said i
[40:29] also gave this example
[40:30] that i have something in me like a
[40:32] treasure and i hide it somewhere and i
[40:35] asked the congregation to tell me what
[40:37] did i eat amen nobody will be able to
[40:40] tell me exactly what i eat amen until i
[40:43] tell somebody about the thing about the
[40:45] treasure that i had yeah and then then
[40:47] you will know exactly what was here it
[40:50] meant that telling that that's the
[40:52] that's the revelation amen i tell you
[40:54] and i reveal i'll reveal it to you i say
[40:56] for example hey brother frank uh i have
[40:58] a diamond here and i hide it's this
[41:00] place so if i go to if i go to the
[41:03] conversion where brother brother frank
[41:05] is there and i asked and i asked who
[41:07] knows uh what i hate amen brother frank
[41:10] will be the only one who will know
[41:12] exactly that that was hidden because
[41:16] because that word was revealed to him
[41:18] amen
[41:21] it's something that is given to us by
[41:24] grace amen it's something that we didn't
[41:26] fight for or something that we don't
[41:28] work out i mean it's it's given to us by
[41:30] grace amen it's like abraham we said
[41:33] that abraham was the father of faith he
[41:35] meant he believed he believed in god for
[41:37] 25 years when all when our hope was
[41:40] against him
[41:41] and that that man was given to him
[41:43] that's right amen
[41:45] says i mean if i want to jump uh in
[41:48] matthew chapter 13 verse 18 to 23
[41:52] that that that is jesus even giving this
[41:56] parable it says that hearing therefore
[41:58] the parable of the sower
[42:00] when anyone hears the word of the
[42:03] kingdom and understand this is not
[42:06] then cometh the wicked one
[42:08] and catches away that which was sung in
[42:11] his heart yeah this is he which received
[42:15] seed by the way of by the wayside
[42:18] verse 20 but
[42:20] he that received the seed into the stony
[42:23] places
[42:24] the same is he that heareth the word and
[42:27] enemy
[42:28] with joy receiveth he
[42:30] he has
[42:32] he not root
[42:34] in himself
[42:35] but dureth for a while
[42:37] for when tribulation or persecution
[42:40] arises because of the word
[42:42] by and by he's offended yeah yeah he
[42:45] also that received seed
[42:47] among the thorns
[42:49] is he that heareth the word
[42:51] and the care of the world
[42:54] and the the sinfulness of of of riches
[42:57] shook the word
[42:59] and he becometh unfruitful now verse 23
[43:03] but he that received seed into the good
[43:06] ground is he that heareth the word and
[43:10] understandeth him
[43:11] which also beareth fruit right amen and
[43:14] bringeth forth through some and on 104.
[43:18] and some 60 and some thirty amen amen
[43:20] these are the three uh i think the three
[43:23] types of of of people of the people in
[43:26] the church
[43:27] the prophet says that there are three
[43:28] types of men in the church that there
[43:30] are people who don't believe
[43:32] in no matter how you try to explain to
[43:34] them that god is real no matter how you
[43:36] try to explain to them that even that
[43:38] the word is real amen they just won't
[43:40] believe it you mean there are the second
[43:42] type of people it's those people who
[43:44] force themselves to believe even they
[43:46] try to understand the word so hard and
[43:48] they believe with the intellectuals amen
[43:51] and then the third type is those people
[43:53] who i mean they don't force to believe
[43:55] that that faith has been revealed to
[43:58] them that faith is revelation amen amen
[44:00] those are the people that that jesus
[44:02] said here that
[44:04] those who receive the seed into a good
[44:06] ground
[44:07] amen but now in order for you to have a
[44:10] good ground it's not something that we
[44:12] do or order we try to to work ourself
[44:16] out to do it even if you see a farmer
[44:18] even when he buys a land a medallion
[44:21] comes with many kinds of spaces yeah
[44:24] that land will come with snow or i mean
[44:26] with uh stones that that land will come
[44:28] with even all those things that he
[44:30] doesn't want to yeah but you'll see that
[44:32] the former will have to work on the name
[44:35] and to make it a group ground so that
[44:37] when you when it will start amen uh uh
[44:40] throwing seed that those sin will come
[44:42] and bring forth fruit amen amen it's the
[44:44] same thing with us jesus when he gives
[44:46] his word to us or when he gives him and
[44:48] his promises to us him and he has first
[44:50] to work the land yeah the land which is
[44:53] our heart amen
[44:56] to take away the unbelief he went to
[44:58] take away the death so that when he used
[45:00] his word amen
[45:02] directly to to a good ground and then
[45:05] that will work out and that will produce
[45:07] fruit it means the same thing that
[45:09] ezekiel says in his chapter 33 36 26 and
[45:13] 27
[45:14] it says that a new heart also will not
[45:16] give
[45:17] and a new spirit will not put within you
[45:20] amen and i will take away the stony
[45:22] heart out of your flesh and i will give
[45:24] you a heart of flesh
[45:27] amen and i will put my spirit within you
[45:30] and cause you to walk in my stomach
[45:33] and you shall keep my judgment and do
[45:35] them even here it says that a new heart
[45:38] i will give you and when he has first to
[45:40] work our heart and man he has risked to
[45:42] work even to do the work within us and
[45:44] take away the stony heart
[45:47] that heart that doesn't believe the word
[45:49] he might that that word that is always
[45:51] against the word amen he will give us
[45:53] this new heart amen to get along as the
[45:55] prophet said that he meant this new
[45:57] heart to get along with the word amen
[46:00] this new heart to have fellowship with
[46:02] the word and then after that he will put
[46:04] his spirit with him amen amen so that
[46:06] one is spirit amen will be in us amen
[46:09] and then the spirit will receive the
[46:13] that word
[46:14] even that will bring that word to action
[46:17] that will bring that word to be
[46:18] fulfilled amen in order for all of this
[46:21] to happen amen you have to be a part of
[46:23] god right amen you have to be a part of
[46:26] god you have to be
[46:27] in god's body in order for this uh
[46:30] revelation to be given to you like the
[46:32] prophet says that but a man has a soul
[46:35] and therefore
[46:37] that soul is a part of god
[46:39] and even in his fallen state
[46:43] yet it's the most greatest species of
[46:46] all the species of the earth
[46:48] he's the man
[46:49] and then get him in connection with his
[46:52] maker
[46:53] he becomes a
[46:54] superman almost because he's the son of
[46:58] god yeah he becomes acquainted with his
[47:01] maker
[47:02] with the creator of all things yes and
[47:05] when
[47:06] that man there acquainted with his uh uh
[47:10] with his maker becomes a part of his
[47:13] maker
[47:14] becomes
[47:15] becomes back into fellowship with his
[47:18] making
[47:19] every divine word becomes a living
[47:21] reality that's
[47:23] he believes it yes no wonder people can
[47:26] believe divine healing today they
[47:28] haven't got nothing to believe with you
[47:30] yes until god comes into the human heart
[47:33] amen is now much better than
[47:36] his reason he'll think it all out how
[47:39] can this be and explain it all the way
[47:42] but when god ever takes his position in
[47:46] the in the in the human heart
[47:48] all the reasonings fade
[47:50] away god becomes first amen amen
[47:54] amen god becomes first amen when god
[47:56] takes away all the all the doubt even
[47:59] when you put it when you give it goes in
[48:01] in our heart the way that the body is
[48:03] built
[48:04] amen there's uh uh
[48:07] the blood is built in three different
[48:09] parts
[48:10] amen there is uh uh
[48:13] there is a spirit
[48:15] there is a
[48:17] heart and then there is a soul
[48:19] amen in the soul that in the soul that's
[48:22] that is where where in the soul there is
[48:25] only two things that's right amen amen
[48:27] it's either death or faith amen amen you
[48:31] either dealt or you oh you have faith
[48:34] those two things cannot be together
[48:36] that's right amen amen that's what when
[48:38] you become a part of god even god will
[48:41] be in you right it will take away all
[48:43] the doubt you know all the god that is
[48:45] inside of you amen you will bring that
[48:48] faith it will bring that atmosphere of
[48:49] faith so that when it gives your word or
[48:51] when you hear the word of god amen you
[48:53] won't doubt it amen amen you won't even
[48:55] ask questions
[48:58] amen mary you meant probably she heard
[49:00] about him and how him and she read
[49:03] before how isaiah i meant give them give
[49:05] the prophecy of of a virgin that will
[49:08] conceive amen when isaiah give that
[49:10] prophecy i mean certainly none of them
[49:12] knew how that prophecy will come to pass
[49:14] sure amen but when did the angel came to
[49:17] mary amen mary only asked one thing
[49:20] to the angel amen how is it going to be
[49:23] amen the angel explain it to her that
[49:25] you will be covered by the holy spirit
[49:27] if i don't understand that after that
[49:29] mary didn't ask any questions
[49:34] amen because that faith was revealed to
[49:37] her she had the revelation of the faith
[49:39] and she directly believed what uh what
[49:41] the angel told
[49:43] it's the same thing with abraham even i
[49:46] mean he was older than him and he
[49:48] couldn't have a son even but when you
[49:50] heard the word of god even when you
[49:52] heard the promise of god that you will
[49:53] have a child amen abraham didn't didn't
[50:05] [Music]
[50:11] in other words abraham zeroed himself
[50:15] he was in target you know
[50:17] his eyes wasn't god's promise even
[50:20] that's why he had that's why he could
[50:22] have faith for 25 years and now you not
[50:25] have doubt amen amen because
[50:28] it's because god made because that faith
[50:30] was revealed to him
[50:32] but when our body becomes in tune with
[50:34] god
[50:35] becoming a part of him
[50:37] then our soul can pick up the power of
[50:39] the holy spirit glory to vindicate the
[50:42] presence of the lord jesus christ in all
[50:44] of his power and omnipotence amen he has
[50:47] risen from the dead
[50:49] he lives among us amen and he wants
[50:51] fellowship
[50:53] with his people amen
[50:54] his great majesty his glory is now
[50:58] spreading forth
[50:59] he's
[51:00] he uh uh he he's desiring to fellowship
[51:04] again with his people
[51:06] like he did in the garden of eden amen
[51:09] amen god wants to have god wants to take
[51:12] position in your heart
[51:13] amen that's where he wants to be because
[51:15] like like we said it last sunday amen
[51:17] the church will play with this amen they
[51:19] put jesus christ away they put him
[51:21] outside of the church amen now he's
[51:23] trying he's trying to get in he's right
[51:26] man even knocking into your door saying
[51:28] that hey open i'm here standing amen but
[51:31] when he comes and when he comes with all
[51:33] the benefits amen because they won't say
[51:36] that if you abide in me and my word
[51:38] divine even my word in you amen you can
[51:41] ask whatever you want but first before
[51:43] asking him and you have to abide in him
[51:46] word has to embody you amen
[51:59] [Music]
[52:01] will stand in your way even if you abide
[52:04] in him and his word inviting you even
[52:06] abiding amen means to dwell
[52:10] he also means to anchor amen amen
[52:12] immensely you know to be and want to
[52:14] have one body amen amen it's not it's
[52:17] like that the prophet says that for the
[52:19] third food to become induction amen the
[52:21] bride has to be in one of these ones
[52:25] then they will be able to speak the word
[52:27] and that word will come to be amen amen
[52:30] you have to be in that constant
[52:31] relationship with god amen it has to be
[52:34] a direct line when you go to god and you
[52:36] can speak and you know that exactly that
[52:39] god is here even god would listen to my
[52:41] prayer and everybody will give me the
[52:42] answer amen is that daniel even he was
[52:45] so god he was so in god he embodied god
[52:49] even that when that the bible said that
[52:51] when he set his heart to understand amen
[52:55] about the word he meant the bible said
[52:56] that the god sent his angels him and
[52:59] he's injured to come with with with the
[53:02] answer he meant to respray right and
[53:04] then when he set his heart to understand
[53:06] why because if daniel he brought it
[53:09] daniel about him christ even daniel was
[53:11] so in god amen in his word god's word
[53:14] was in him amen but he had no other
[53:16] destruction than praying and reading the
[53:18] word right amen but when it then when he
[53:20] understood that the judgment is about to
[53:22] come
[53:23] and he said it's hard to understand even
[53:26] about how many days was left how many
[53:28] weeks was left amen then the angel amen
[53:31] god the angel was sent with the nestor
[53:34] amen before he even opened his mouth and
[53:36] his answer was already sent amen because
[53:39] god knows our heart god serves
[53:43] amen god knows our desire god knows our
[53:45] prayers even god came here and then we
[53:48] serve a god who is different than an
[53:49] idol they may idols have mouths but they
[53:51] can't speak yeah amen i don't have ears
[53:53] but they can't hear have eyes but they
[53:56] can't see amen but we serve a living
[53:59] room
[54:02] answer to our prayers
[54:04] who can hear our prayers and get an
[54:06] answer yes
[54:09] we must focus our lives
[54:11] not what somebody else says yes but
[54:14] focus our lives to him amen
[54:16] and he is the word see amen if we get
[54:19] our lives in line with the word
[54:22] then the word in our life becomes the
[54:25] same
[54:26] amen if you invited me in my word in you
[54:30] then ask what you will
[54:32] it'll be created to you yes verily i say
[54:35] unto you if you say to this mountain be
[54:37] moved
[54:38] and don't doubt in your heart but
[54:40] believe that
[54:42] believe that
[54:44] what you say what you have said will
[54:45] come to pass you can't have what you
[54:48] have said oh my
[54:51] not what i say
[54:52] about what you say
[54:54] you can have it because you
[54:57] and he become the same amen because i
[55:01] believe the mind that was in christ is
[55:03] in you amen and the mind that was in
[55:05] christ was to fulfill the father's word
[55:08] amen which he was the word
[55:11] there you are
[55:13] then you and the word are focused in
[55:15] together you become a living unit of god
[55:19] amen our grace amen the mind that was in
[55:22] christ he meant he becomes you amen amen
[55:25] amen everything that you say him and
[55:26] you'll be like amen you'll be like in
[55:28] the creation amen when adam was naming
[55:32] naming the the animals amen everything
[55:35] that adam was saying even god the
[55:37] response was amen yeah even because adam
[55:39] was expressing him and the thought of
[55:41] them
[55:43] if you become in tune with god and your
[55:45] reactions
[55:46] will
[55:50] those people kissing in the church amen
[55:52] god was waiting there waiting for the
[55:54] prophet to pray to say something but
[55:56] when the prophet was up he said that i
[55:58] forgive you guys say that that is
[56:00] exactly what i wanted
[56:15] place in that position amen whatever god
[56:17] thinks amen we will be able to say amen
[56:20] our words will be god's thought amen
[56:22] amen our words will be god's thoughts
[56:24] amen that's why one amen amen that was
[56:27] why that's the reason why the word was
[56:29] given to us amen and faith demand was
[56:33] was designed
[56:34] amen to know the wills and the wants of
[56:37] god yeah even faith was given to us a
[56:40] man to know what god wants and what what
[56:42] the will of god is he meant that that
[56:44] was the purpose of faith amen it's like
[56:47] david even with his soldiers he met
[56:50] david after coming from a war event
[56:52] david was thirsty amen he wanted to
[56:55] drink that water from breath for him
[56:57] amen he just expressed his will yeah
[57:00] and those three soldiers took that wheel
[57:02] and that one became an ordinary yeah
[57:05] they went in and they fought and then
[57:07] they broke back the water back to david
[57:09] and that that is where every christian
[57:12] has to be women to look at god and see
[57:15] when god knows amen we know exactly that
[57:18] what god wants amen
[57:22] we take that will and then he became
[57:24] lucky like a commandment yes sir
[57:28] i can't i don't want to close my eyes
[57:30] until amen i have a place of worship for
[57:33] god amen it becomes a burden to us until
[57:36] we fulfill
[57:38] that desire
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:52] we preached the last time we met about
[57:54] the symphony
[57:55] amen to be indirectly in connection amen
[57:58] the leader and the musicians amen
[58:00] whatever the leader is guiding wherever
[58:02] the leader is guiding the musicians amen
[58:05] that's what
[58:06] he will play
[58:07] whatever god is saying even that's the
[58:09] thing that we will do amen wherever god
[58:11] wants us to be even that's where we will
[58:13] be amen whatever wherever god wants us
[58:16] to go that's what we do
[58:18] to give ourselves to me even to become
[58:22] [Music]
[58:49] waiting for noah to touch and then
[58:51] that's how we have to be amen like jesus
[58:54] amen his prayers say the lord not my
[58:56] will but that will lord amen to take
[58:59] away to kill ourselves we make sure that
[59:03] you must say that god takes control
[59:05] of the of us
[59:07] amen because it's the tower it's the
[59:09] tower that is a tower that needs to be
[59:11] inside of us amen to guide us to lead us
[59:13] he meant to warn us when dangers are
[59:15] coming amen to give us whatever we want
[59:18] it meant to be to take that will they
[59:20] meant to kill ourselves like paul said i
[59:22] kill myself daily amen my will amen so
[59:25] that god god god takes full control of
[59:28] me
[59:29] and when the prophet continues he says
[59:30] now now listen now listen real close to
[59:33] this remark
[59:35] faith now don't forget don't forget to
[59:37] get this now
[59:39] faith is designed to see what god wills
[59:42] and wants
[59:44] there there is no knowledge that can do
[59:47] that
[59:48] faith alone is designed and give to the
[59:50] human race
[59:52] to find out what the will of god is
[59:55] and you take your faith that you got
[59:58] and you don't focus with the word
[1:00:01] then leave it alone
[1:00:03] if you take the if you take your faith
[1:00:05] that you got and if that faith don't
[1:00:07] focus with the word just leave it alone
[1:00:10] you got the wrong faith
[1:00:12] but when your god but but when you're
[1:00:14] god given faith focus you
[1:00:16] with the word of god
[1:00:18] you're directly in line and zeroed
[1:00:22] oh my god help us this hour great hour
[1:00:25] that we live in faith designed to see
[1:00:28] what god wants
[1:00:29] how do you see it
[1:00:31] through the camera of his word his
[1:00:34] promise
[1:00:35] this is a full revelation of jesus
[1:00:37] christ
[1:00:38] amen there is a course i mean for uh
[1:00:41] engineers and and
[1:00:43] and and i'm pretty sure technicians also
[1:00:46] it meant that that when we study about
[1:00:48] the machine or
[1:00:50] a machine or a computer or a machine
[1:00:53] if all the parameters if all the
[1:00:56] settings of the machine goes wrong
[1:00:58] and then we call it to zero
[1:01:01] i mean to bring the machine back it
[1:01:03] meant to how the manufacturer it meant
[1:01:05] how the well the machine was
[1:01:06] manufactured amen immense and we've we
[1:01:09] zeroed ourselves
[1:01:11] amen when when things are going wrong
[1:01:13] and man when all the settings in of our
[1:01:15] lives amen they don't they don't they
[1:01:17] don't line up again with god's word amen
[1:01:20] we can come back to calvary amen that's
[1:01:22] the point that's the point of refuge
[1:01:24] amen that's the origin amen to zeroed
[1:01:27] ourselves amen we will see directly what
[1:01:30] god sees amen we will hear it directly
[1:01:32] amen what god wants amen one will become
[1:01:35] zero even when we go back to the origin
[1:01:37] amen to calvary amen that's where we
[1:01:40] want to be amen to zeroed ourselves amen
[1:01:43] like he made us amen like he created us
[1:01:45] amen like he wanted us like you want us
[1:01:47] to be it meant to be to depend on him
[1:01:51] he meant to depend on him amen to give
[1:01:53] us that ability even to enforce the law
[1:01:55] of god amen amen amen to the world amen
[1:01:58] to give us that ability amen to go and
[1:02:01] to claim whatever amen belongs to us
[1:02:03] amen to give us that ability amen to go
[1:02:06] and to claim amen because when he died
[1:02:08] on the cross amen like john described it
[1:02:11] john said that god said that it is
[1:02:12] finished amen everything that he ever
[1:02:15] promised to us amen was fulfilled right
[1:02:17] there on the cross even now it's our job
[1:02:20] now it's our time now to go and to claim
[1:02:23] amen whatever belongs to us and when you
[1:02:25] go claim amen you don't go to negotiate
[1:02:28] amen when you're claiming it's not
[1:02:29] negotiating it means it's way different
[1:02:32] claiming it's going with authority
[1:02:34] amen it's like david after coming back
[1:02:36] from the war amen his wives and and and
[1:02:40] and and all the the women of the of the
[1:02:42] of the land was taken and when david
[1:02:45] went to the enemy it meant to claim back
[1:02:47] what belonged to him amen david went
[1:02:50] there and then he didn't negotiate with
[1:02:52] the with the philistines amen but he
[1:02:54] went with the authority that he had the
[1:02:56] word of god that everything that i give
[1:02:59] you amen belongs to you amen he went
[1:03:01] with that word he meant to to to reclaim
[1:03:03] to claim back amen everything that
[1:03:06] belongs to amen when we see
[1:03:08] amen that we're going through the same
[1:03:09] time we mean even the same troubles it
[1:03:12] meant that every that the joy that we
[1:03:14] have for god amen it's been taken away
[1:03:16] from us amen the love of god you can't
[1:03:18] feel god anymore amen your connection
[1:03:20] with god is no longer there or is not
[1:03:23] how you want it to be amen you can go
[1:03:26] and claim whatever that belongs to you
[1:03:28] amen god will give it to you as long as
[1:03:30] you have faith amen as long as you have
[1:03:32] faith and where as long as you sincere
[1:03:34] amen it's like god said to the prophet
[1:03:36] he said that when you're sincere amen
[1:03:39] you can bind the serpent amen only if
[1:03:41] you're sincere amen it's only sincere
[1:03:44] the amen that can do the work amen when
[1:03:46] there is no other one there is no doubt
[1:03:48] amen that one faith is there amen when
[1:03:51] that faith has been revealed to you amen
[1:03:53] then you can bind the serpent amen then
[1:03:55] you can cast out the evils and and and
[1:03:58] and serve god
[1:04:00] i mean we have to enforce the law of god
[1:04:02] i mean like david did amen when his
[1:04:05] wives and and
[1:04:06] and the people of the city i mean when
[1:04:11] so it wasn't they were in captivity even
[1:04:13] he went there to claim them back
[1:04:16] and then he went there to claim them
[1:04:17] back james and paul even they gave amen
[1:04:20] in the bible two different point of view
[1:04:23] of faith
[1:04:24] even james explained faith as you know
[1:04:27] uh uh uh i mean uh justification jim
[1:04:30] said that you mean uh exactly explain
[1:04:32] faith amen like the
[1:04:35] uh uh the thing
[1:04:37] uh uh uh gems
[1:04:40] how can i say
[1:04:42] james said in the bible that faith
[1:04:46] is expressed by the works in other words
[1:04:48] james was saying that
[1:04:50] when you have faith
[1:04:52] the way men can see it amen men can only
[1:04:55] see your faith when their faith is with
[1:04:57] words amen when that faith is
[1:04:59] accomplished
[1:05:01] you know comes with words i mean when
[1:05:02] you show your word the works of faith i
[1:05:05] mean that's that is when amen men can
[1:05:07] see faith by the way uh paul explained
[1:05:10] he said that god amen god see him and
[1:05:13] god sees it
[1:05:15] amen in other words uh uh
[1:05:18] how can i say amen men see the works
[1:05:21] amen god sees the faith amen that's
[1:05:23] that's how the you know that's how they
[1:05:25] explained it amen men sees him and james
[1:05:27] when he was talking amen was talking
[1:05:29] about men's point of view amen
[1:05:31] about the works and paul amen was
[1:05:33] talking about amen what god sees him and
[1:05:36] god sees our god sees our faith amen
[1:05:38] because the works amen work is the
[1:05:40] weakness of faith amen work is the
[1:05:43] witness of faith you cannot say that you
[1:05:44] have faith when that faith doesn't have
[1:05:46] words amen what are you going to say
[1:05:48] what what how are you going to prove to
[1:05:50] me that you have you have faith i mean
[1:05:52] you have to show me those experiences
[1:05:54] amen you have to show me what god has
[1:05:56] done with you amen what is god what is
[1:05:58] what god has done to you amen it's a
[1:06:00] david when he went to seoul emma david
[1:06:03] just didn't go with simple words i mean
[1:06:05] but david went with experiences saying
[1:06:07] that hey uh god is with me and god
[1:06:10] always protects me it looks so i was
[1:06:13] there and
[1:06:14] you know with the sheep and this lion
[1:06:16] came in and god with god's help i killed
[1:06:18] that lion amen i killed that bear what
[1:06:21] david came amen with with experiences
[1:06:24] amen with the works of his faith amen
[1:06:26] that's the same way that you can cast
[1:06:28] the devil amen it's when you have when
[1:06:31] you come in with the faith amen amen
[1:06:33] when you try to remember amen about what
[1:06:36] god has done for you amen it's like the
[1:06:38] other day
[1:06:39] that when the prophet was praying for
[1:06:41] that blind man amen he prayed for the
[1:06:43] first time and the the men didn't they
[1:06:45] didn't recover inside even the prophet
[1:06:48] i mean the devil started to to bring
[1:06:50] like the bad thoughts and saying that
[1:06:52] hey god uh this time it won't work and
[1:06:55] god will not hear your prayer amen the
[1:06:57] prophet says that what what helped him
[1:06:59] and he started to remember amen what god
[1:07:01] has done for him and when he started to
[1:07:03] remember amen
[1:07:05] the experiences that he had with god how
[1:07:07] god healed him and other people amen
[1:07:10] that brought him and that that
[1:07:12] atmosphere amen that built up again his
[1:07:15] faith he meant and then he prayed for
[1:07:17] the second time he met that blind man
[1:07:19] recovered his side amen amen faith amen
[1:07:22] works is the weakness of faith amen the
[1:07:24] prophet says that so is faith
[1:07:27] that doesn't so he's fifth that doesn't
[1:07:28] produce works
[1:07:30] anyone anyone has a anyone has a right
[1:07:33] to doubt your faith your testimony
[1:07:36] now do you hear it
[1:07:38] before we start the prayer line
[1:07:41] if your faith doesn't produce works
[1:07:44] if it doesn't produce works with it
[1:07:46] you can't make anyone believe that
[1:07:48] you're healed
[1:07:50] say well i don't know
[1:07:52] why
[1:07:54] sure i got all the faith in the world
[1:07:57] prophecy that you don't because if you
[1:07:59] are or if you got faith
[1:08:02] then works is married to faith
[1:08:05] their husband and wife one identifies
[1:08:08] the other one amen you can't say to
[1:08:11] people amen amen amen you can't say to
[1:08:13] people that you got all the faith in the
[1:08:15] world even when you don't have the work
[1:08:17] that expresses it amen their husband and
[1:08:20] wife amen they are in perfect harmony
[1:08:22] amen you can't take the other and leave
[1:08:24] the other one and you leave the other
[1:08:26] one inside him and they have to be all
[1:08:28] together amen faith and works amen both
[1:08:31] of them working together
[1:08:33] amen it's god who gives us faith
[1:08:36] amen it's god who gives us faith by his
[1:08:38] grace amen is god who gives us that
[1:08:40] revelation of faith amen before god gave
[1:08:43] his promise to abraham even god had to
[1:08:46] work abraham's soul or abraham's heart
[1:08:49] amen so that when his promise will be
[1:08:51] given to abraham even abraham would
[1:08:54] believe in that promise amen abraham
[1:08:56] will have faith in that promise amen
[1:08:58] when you find yourself that you don't
[1:09:00] have faith in men you can go to god amen
[1:09:02] and god will quicken that faith amen
[1:09:04] that god will quicken him and that's
[1:09:06] sleeping faith inside of you amen and
[1:09:08] then you will have faith in his word
[1:09:10] amen because faith is a revelation amen
[1:09:12] the revelation is given by god alone
[1:09:15] imma revelation is a gift from god amen
[1:09:17] it's a gift that is freely even given
[1:09:19] forgiven given it's a it's a gift that
[1:09:22] is freely given by him
[1:09:24] amen because you will see that not you
[1:09:27] know before moses
[1:09:29] they didn't have the bible before moses
[1:09:32] but how amen amen how did those people
[1:09:36] even have faith in god's word
[1:09:38] amen before moses they didn't have any
[1:09:40] bible to read and to to know that hey if
[1:09:43] god did this with uh uh
[1:09:46] that did this with this this person
[1:09:48] before so i'm in the same situation so i
[1:09:51] can go to god and pray amen but those
[1:09:53] people he meant they had faith in god
[1:09:55] amen they believed in god you see moses
[1:09:58] him and he had faith in god he knew that
[1:09:59] god can open the red sea even he had
[1:10:02] faith in god why because that faith was
[1:10:04] revealed to him amen the word of god was
[1:10:07] revealed to me to him and he said that
[1:10:09] woman amen who was losing blood amen the
[1:10:12] prophet says that before her the bible
[1:10:14] doesn't recall or the bible doesn't say
[1:10:17] about the bible doesn't talk about any
[1:10:19] other woman who was losing blood before
[1:10:21] her even she was actually the first case
[1:10:24] of of a person losing blood in the bible
[1:10:26] it meant but she had faith he meant that
[1:10:29] if i touch the hem of his garment amen i
[1:10:32] know that i'll be here amen her faith
[1:10:34] was so strong amen she didn't care about
[1:10:37] touching the body of jesus she didn't
[1:10:39] care about hugging jesus amen but she
[1:10:41] only cared about him and if i touch one
[1:10:43] part of jesus image that includes even
[1:10:46] god's garment amen it's like those
[1:10:48] people amen even the shadow of jesus
[1:10:50] amen could give healing it meant as long
[1:10:53] as she had faith as long as you have
[1:10:55] faith even that woman had faith amen she
[1:10:58] didn't care about about her case being
[1:11:00] the first one in the bible even she
[1:11:02] didn't care about her case he meant
[1:11:03] being the first one that has ever been
[1:11:06] done in the bible image but she had
[1:11:08] faith and faith breaks all the barriers
[1:11:12] amen freak there is nothing that can
[1:11:13] stand against faith amen faith will
[1:11:15] break through amen if you have faith
[1:11:17] faith will break through amen it doesn't
[1:11:20] matter how big is the thing amen if you
[1:11:22] have faith amen you will him and your
[1:11:24] faith will seal through amen if it
[1:11:26] doesn't matter if your your challenge
[1:11:28] amen or or your your trial is is big
[1:11:31] like goliath amen faith is able it meant
[1:11:34] to cut goliath's head amen faith is able
[1:11:37] he meant to to to break him and
[1:11:39] jericho's wall even faith is able
[1:11:41] immensely to to overcome everything amen
[1:11:45] if you only have faith in god amen if
[1:11:47] you only have faith in god amen because
[1:11:49] abraham knew
[1:11:51] that his body was good it was good as
[1:11:53] dead
[1:11:54] but he considered not his body his own
[1:11:56] body he considered not the deadness of
[1:11:59] sarah's womb
[1:12:01] a young girl a young girl uh he had
[1:12:04] married his half-sister
[1:12:06] lived with her all these years
[1:12:09] and now she's 90 years old
[1:12:11] and he's a hundred years old but he
[1:12:14] didn't even think about that
[1:12:16] that didn't even come in his mind why he
[1:12:19] had focused all his unbelief out amen oh
[1:12:23] glory
[1:12:24] that's what the church shall do
[1:12:28] that's what each member of the church
[1:12:30] should do amen would focus out will
[1:12:33] focus out
[1:12:35] of you with focus out
[1:12:38] of your ordeal
[1:12:40] look only to that word
[1:12:42] he promised it
[1:12:44] god said so i got to be that way amen if
[1:12:47] you can focus in god's word amen if you
[1:12:50] can focus his promise him and he says
[1:12:52] that amen don't think about tomorrow
[1:12:54] because as i take care of the little
[1:12:56] bird amen i will take care of you amen
[1:12:58] he gave that word amen you just focus
[1:13:01] yourself in that word amen women put
[1:13:04] your focus in that word and you will see
[1:13:06] it through amen you didn't ask god to
[1:13:08] say to you know to give all those
[1:13:10] promises amen you never asked god to
[1:13:13] give all these promises but he gave it
[1:13:14] to his own free will amen as long as he
[1:13:17] gave it amen he will see it through amen
[1:13:19] amen you just have to focus him and like
[1:13:22] abraham he closed his eyes he's closed
[1:13:24] his ear amen from all the unbelief for
[1:13:27] all those bad thoughts that could come
[1:13:29] to him amen sarah sometimes could have
[1:13:31] come to abraham and start complaining
[1:13:33] abraham amen it's been 10 years but
[1:13:35] there is no son amen abraham had his
[1:13:38] focus amen on god's promise amen he knew
[1:13:40] that god gave his word amen and god
[1:13:43] god's word amen
[1:13:45] when god's word is given amen itself
[1:13:48] it's like it's that that word is already
[1:13:49] fulfilled even abraham had that faith
[1:13:52] him and he focused himself he meant to
[1:13:54] that promise amen if today he meant
[1:13:56] tonight amen we can focus ourselves amen
[1:13:59] whatever situation we find ourselves in
[1:14:01] amen we can focus ourselves into that
[1:14:04] promise of god amen that god will always
[1:14:06] take care of us that everything that we
[1:14:08] ask in jesus name amen will he will give
[1:14:11] it to us amen if we have faith amen you
[1:14:13] will you will see it
[1:14:15] and he said that cast all your cares
[1:14:17] upon him because he takes good care of
[1:14:20] you amen wherever you need whatever you
[1:14:22] need amen just speak the word amen it's
[1:14:24] like god told moses moses why are you
[1:14:27] crying amen moses why are you human
[1:14:29] crying amen just speak the word amen and
[1:14:31] then i will divide the red sea amen god
[1:14:34] is telling us why are we crying amen
[1:14:36] what are we why are we crying why are we
[1:14:39] even complaining about the situation
[1:14:41] amen why are we complaining about the
[1:14:43] hard time about the trials amen just
[1:14:45] speak the word amen just speak the word
[1:14:48] and then you will see the solution amen
[1:14:50] just speak the word amen you will see
[1:14:52] the healing amen just speak the word
[1:14:54] amen whatever you need your prayer amen
[1:14:57] you will see it being fulfilled amen
[1:14:59] plead your case at calvary amen because
[1:15:02] the crimson blood
[1:15:03] of christ amen paid all the debt amen
[1:15:06] and declares and declares you not guilty
[1:15:09] amen therefore you have now amen amen
[1:15:11] the authority amen that was given to god
[1:15:14] amen that that authority demon is given
[1:15:16] to you amen that you can go and claim
[1:15:18] whatever that whatever amen whatever
[1:15:21] that that belongs to you amen amen amen
[1:15:24] god didn't do it just for the sake of
[1:15:26] doing it and he deeded him and so that
[1:15:27] we can use it amen for so that we can
[1:15:30] use it and our joy be fulfilled amen
[1:15:32] that's that's what he promised amen
[1:15:34] that's what he said amen he gave us all
[1:15:36] those words amen so that the least of
[1:15:38] the believers even when they take that
[1:15:40] promise of god him at the entire entire
[1:15:43] hell him and is under them amen the
[1:15:45] least of believers they meant the
[1:15:47] weakest of all the believers even when
[1:15:49] they take the promise of god they might
[1:15:51] want to take the promises of god even
[1:15:53] the devil will be under them amen as the
[1:15:56] prophet says that then the least of
[1:15:58] these believers
[1:15:59] no matter how long
[1:16:01] or little or whatever you are the least
[1:16:04] of his believers
[1:16:06] as as in him as as all evil under them

[1:16:13] that right
[1:16:14] well whatever the head is the bodies
[1:16:18] with it glory
[1:16:20] where my head goes it takes my body with
[1:16:22] it and where jesus is the church is with
[1:16:26] him amen he don't get out of his word he
[1:16:30] stays in he stays in his word
[1:16:33] watches over it to make it manifest
[1:16:37] his church he's with him amen amen his
[1:16:40] church is with him wherever wherever the
[1:16:42] body is what i mean whatever the head is
[1:16:44] amen that's where the body will be amen
[1:16:47] however man wherever the body is amen
[1:16:49] that's where the body will be where the
[1:16:50] head is that's where the body will be
[1:16:52] amen whatever the head says amen that's
[1:16:55] what the body will do amen if the head
[1:16:57] says that you are you are an overcomer
[1:16:59] amen that's why the body with the body
[1:17:01] will have to behave himself as an
[1:17:03] overcomer amen jesus said jesus was the
[1:17:06] head of the body amen he said that you
[1:17:08] are overcomer amen he make he made you
[1:17:10] more than overcome amen you who are the
[1:17:13] body man you have to behave yourself as
[1:17:15] an overcomer
[1:17:17] and when you don't you have to stop
[1:17:18] complaining amen you have to stop a man
[1:17:21] complaining and crying amen even saying
[1:17:24] him and like brother books usually say
[1:17:25] that white me lord amen because the
[1:17:27] promise has been given to you amen a
[1:17:30] promise has been given to you you have
[1:17:31] to behave your servants and overcome
[1:17:34] amen like david when he was going to
[1:17:36] goliath him and david didn't go to
[1:17:37] goliath complaining hey lord amen how am
[1:17:40] i going to build this goliath look at
[1:17:42] how huge he is or or how big he is amen
[1:17:45] david had the word of god amen david was
[1:17:48] walking the goliath amen as an overcomer
[1:17:50] and my david was walking to goliath as
[1:17:53] if goliath was already dead amen that's
[1:17:55] the same way we have to work if we have
[1:17:57] to walk even walk amen amen with that
[1:18:00] with our shoulders aiming up in the air
[1:18:02] even saying that god's word is true amen
[1:18:04] whatever god says him and daddy will do
[1:18:07] amen having that faith with us amen then
[1:18:10] you will have him and then you'll have
[1:18:11] every all the answers of your prayers
[1:18:14] amen then you will see god fighting with
[1:18:16] your battles amen then you will see god
[1:18:18] amen amen leading you amen through

[1:18:22] through darkness amen amen god will be
[1:18:24] your light amen the word of god will be
[1:18:27] your life amen amen the word faith is a
[1:18:30] revelation now remember this christ is a
[1:18:33] true cross in the true church
[1:18:35] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:18:39] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:18:41] that antichrist spirit will come into
[1:18:44] the church and defile it
[1:18:47] making it look warm
[1:18:49] formal and powerless
[1:18:51] he exposes satan
[1:18:53] revealing his works
[1:18:55] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:18:58] and and
[1:18:59] and the discreting of his of god's word
[1:19:03] right down to the time
[1:19:05] he is cast into the lake of fire
[1:19:09] he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:19:12] he knows that the people he knows that
[1:19:14] if the people
[1:19:16] get the true revelation of the true
[1:19:19] church
[1:19:20] and what she is what she stands for
[1:19:24] and that and that she can't do the
[1:19:26] greater works
[1:19:28] she will be an invisible army
[1:19:31] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:19:33] spirits within the framework of of of of
[1:19:37] the christian of the christian church
[1:19:40] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:19:42] withstand the enter the antichrist
[1:19:45] spirit satan will be powerless before
[1:19:48] her amen he will be as he will be as uh
[1:19:52] definitely
[1:19:54] uh uh authority today as when cross
[1:19:57] withstood
[1:19:58] we've withstood his every effort to gain
[1:20:01] power over him in the desert yes satan
[1:20:04] hates revelation
[1:20:06] but we love it
[1:20:08] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:20:11] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:20:14] but we will prevail over them amen with
[1:20:18] true revelation in our hearts even the
[1:20:20] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:20:22] amen with true revelation on our hearts
[1:20:25] amen there is no immense sickness in
[1:20:27] hell amen that can stand against us amen
[1:20:30] with true revelation in our heart amen
[1:20:32] there is no amen hard times amen that
[1:20:35] can stand against us amen with true
[1:20:37] revelation in our heart amen there is no
[1:20:39] red sea that can stand against us amen
[1:20:41] with true revelation our heart amen
[1:20:43] there is no jordan reaver amen that can
[1:20:46] stand against us amen because with the
[1:20:48] word amen we will speak the word and
[1:20:50] those rivers will be divided amen we'll
[1:20:52] speak the word amen and we will walk on
[1:20:54] dry land amen satan
[1:20:57] hates revelation amen but we love it
[1:20:59] amen because we know that once we have
[1:21:01] that revelation amen nothing can move us
[1:21:04] i mean we know that once we have that
[1:21:06] revelation amen nothing can move us i
[1:21:08] mean it doesn't matter amen if if we
[1:21:10] have troubles it meant before us and and
[1:21:13] and the egyptians behind us amen even
[1:21:16] the red sea on the other side of the
[1:21:19] land amen we want fear amen because we
[1:21:22] know that we have that revelation and
[1:21:24] once we have that revelation our anchor
[1:21:26] it is in jesus amen nothing can move us
[1:21:29] amen our anchored is in him nothing can
[1:21:31] move us it doesn't matter how strong is
[1:21:33] the water amen we know that we won't
[1:21:36] move amen because jesus is there amen
[1:21:38] because jesus is in the boat amen jesus
[1:21:41] will come the sea for us amen we won't
[1:21:44] have to fear amen we don't have to fret
[1:21:46] amen jesus is there amen he gave his
[1:21:48] word amen and then he as the prophecy
[1:21:50] that he will not rest even until he sees
[1:21:53] that word being fulfilled amen he will
[1:21:55] not rest him and until we all decide
[1:21:58] amen amen is that revelation has been
[1:22:00] given to us amen we won't move amen
[1:22:03] because god is there and then in closing
[1:22:05] i'll read this word of the prophet he
[1:22:07] says that
[1:22:08] where did the dove come from
[1:22:10] up there in the wilderness
