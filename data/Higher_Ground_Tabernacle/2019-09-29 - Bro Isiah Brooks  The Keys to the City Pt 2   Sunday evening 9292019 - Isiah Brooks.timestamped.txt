[9:59] evening
[10:00] god is good to us amen as we stand which
[10:06] is going to go right into the Word of
[10:08] God
[10:21] we won't be long this evening but you
[10:24] know I want to start with the scripture
[10:28] according to first Peter we're just
[10:30] gonna do let's just read Peter first
[10:35] Peter first chapter 2 through 9 and then
[10:40] we'll go down to Ephesians 2 and 10
[10:43] first Peter 1 2 through 9 I know your
[10:48] brother John said he was coming so let's
[10:50] just pray that God give him safe trip it
[10:52] was raining pretty hard out there so
[10:53] pray that God would give him a safe trip
[10:56] up are you so good to us I know
[11:06] everybody get tired I do and I'm looking
[11:13] for the Lord to come at any given time
[11:18] he knows and that's the part that I love
[11:22] about the Lord nothing catches him by
[11:24] surprise and he's always there for us
[11:28] first Peter the first chapter will begin
[11:31] at the second verse amen elect according
[11:36] to the foreknowledge of God that the
[11:39] Father through sanctification of the
[11:41] Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of
[11:45] the blood of blood of Jesus Christ grace
[11:48] unto you and peace be multiplied blessed
[11:52] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[11:54] Christ which according to his abundant
[11:57] mercy has begotten us again unto a
[12:00] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[12:03] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[12:06] incorruptible and undefiled and that
[12:10] fadeth not away reserved in the heavens
[12:14] for you who have kept by the power of
[12:17] God through faith at the salvation ready
[12:21] to be revealed in the last time
[12:25] Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2:10
[12:37] yeah what a mighty God we serve mmm I'm
[12:42] so glad to be one of them I don't know
[12:44] what to do but so Ephesians 2:10 for we
[12:51] are his workmanship created in Christ
[12:55] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[13:00] before ordained that we should walk in
[13:04] them
[13:06] let us pray father we thank you for your
[13:09] grace we thank you for your mercy Lord
[13:12] and everything that you have done for us
[13:15] we pray O God that you'll bless the
[13:18] service in a special way forgive us of
[13:21] our sins and our trespasses that we have
[13:23] said or done anything Lord that have not
[13:26] been pleasing in that sight forgive us
[13:28] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[13:30] Lord there is nothing we could do as you
[13:33] as it was this morning we're totally
[13:36] dependent upon you speak through us Lord
[13:39] bless our hearts strengthen us in your
[13:42] name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may
[13:45] be seated
[13:55] as we said this morning we were working
[13:57] with the keys to the city and I like to
[14:02] say by God's grace there are so many
[14:04] people that have no idea they have no
[14:06] idea that we must go to heaven a certain
[14:12] way we can't get into heaven being a
[14:19] creature that doesn't belong there and
[14:24] by the fall it it's shut the door of
[14:27] heaven to us God as I said in the
[14:32] beginning had in his mind an empire I
[14:38] love that Empire it's good seem like
[14:41] Empire seemed to be greater than just a
[14:43] kingdom because in an empire you have a
[14:47] king kingdoms in kingdoms kind of like
[14:50] the way Jesus says in my father's house
[14:52] there are many mansions and understand
[14:55] that these mansions are also cities
[14:58] because you and I as an individual we
[15:01] are a city and the Bible said we are a
[15:04] city that set upon a hill that cannot be
[15:08] hid you and I must understand that this
[15:12] process of God that what God is doing
[15:14] with us our minds cannot even fathom we
[15:18] can't comprehend the glory like the
[15:21] scripture said that God has prepared for
[15:24] us and to think by God's grace that
[15:28] Satan has blinded the minds of the
[15:31] people where they would trade in
[15:34] something that's medial that something
[15:37] means that that's little of nothing for
[15:40] the kingdom of God think about how he
[15:47] saw traded in his birthright for just a
[15:51] little meal and every time I think about
[15:55] this meal that Esau did eat I think
[16:00] about oatmeal something of that nature
[16:05] of that caliber he traded
[16:08] in and you know why he did it because he
[16:11] did not comprehend he couldn't couldn't
[16:13] understand the importance of his
[16:16] birthright but the bride of Jesus Christ
[16:19] she may have come in like a shyster but
[16:24] one thing for certain she understands
[16:26] the importance of the birthright and she
[16:30] is willing to do whatever it takes to
[16:33] get it the thing that I love about God
[16:36] is that he never gives up on us even
[16:40] though we stumble even though we fall
[16:42] amen he's already got it in the word the
[16:47] gesture falls seven times in the day and
[16:49] get up he already knew he already knows
[16:53] every mistake we're going to make but at
[16:56] the same time he comes along and he
[16:58] justifies us even as the prophet of God
[17:01] said he knew man can't keep a covenant
[17:05] it started in the beginning we never
[17:08] have been covenant keepers and so God
[17:10] himself had to give us an unconditional
[17:13] covenant this is what I love about it
[17:16] because no matter how many times we fall
[17:18] and come short he said get up get up
[17:22] keep going and I love that I love that
[17:27] about the Lord Jesus we were talking
[17:30] this morning about characters and we
[17:33] left off with a few characters of the
[17:35] Bible and I believe with all my heart in
[17:39] this Bible represent you somewhere every
[17:43] character in here was just that was
[17:47] yesterday it's still today why because
[17:51] God will take the spirit but he'll lead
[17:54] the man I mean take take the man but
[17:56] leave the spirit and save them does the
[17:58] same thing he takes the man but he
[18:01] leaves the spirit so it's one of those
[18:04] things where Solomon could truly say
[18:06] there's no new thing under the Sun and
[18:09] you and I must understand we must find
[18:12] ourselves in the scripture I don't mean
[18:18] no harm but this might sound a little
[18:19] strange but you know I
[18:22] like I like the story you know a Rahab
[18:26] and I like the story of the woman at
[18:30] Jesus's feet you know to me those
[18:33] stories are just because in those scenes
[18:36] you see such an intimacy something that
[18:38] took place in an in the supernatural
[18:40] that most people couldn't see and in
[18:44] when you especially the woman that
[18:45] Simon's how she she entered into this
[18:47] this this dimension where she came to
[18:51] recognize who she whose feet she was
[18:54] washing and I think that's what happens
[18:57] sometimes we come to church and we
[18:58] forget we come to wash his feet we come
[19:02] to fellowship with him is that right and
[19:05] we sometimes fail to see that Christ is
[19:10] the one who has brought us thus far I'm
[19:13] getting ready to read something in just
[19:15] a moment because every time and I have
[19:18] been guilty I have been guilty I was
[19:21] listening to the message perfect
[19:23] weakness perfect strength and I was just
[19:26] I can't let me say it like this
[19:29] flabbergasting I was just I was like God
[19:33] where are we where are we where is this
[19:39] bride where is this bride because it
[19:44] must be a manifestation Jesus Christ
[19:47] wasn't just a word he was the
[19:49] manifestation of the word he was a very
[19:51] vindication of the word Malachi 4 wasn't
[19:54] just in the Bible as the word that word
[19:57] had to live it had to be formed in human
[20:01] flesh is that right it's like Mary she
[20:04] was the part of the scripture Mary was a
[20:07] part of the script a virgin shall
[20:09] conceive but it couldn't just lay there
[20:11] on the pages it just wasn't gonna be
[20:13] there just darling on the pages
[20:15] somewhere in time it had to make
[20:18] manifest and it did the bride is not
[20:21] some kind of being made up by some
[20:25] prophet as a man the bride is a reality
[20:28] and she must manifest the
[20:32] characteristics of Christ
[20:36] now we understand why the prophet of God
[20:39] said there's only going to be a few that
[20:42] make a rapture he didn't say a few
[20:45] besaid he said a few that will make a
[20:48] rapture because people are not with this
[20:50] this world has been designed to distract
[20:55] you
[20:56] right it's kind of like when when the
[20:59] self release and woman and when a when a
[21:02] boy fell sick and she said to the to the
[21:06] drivers he said whatever you do in other
[21:08] words don't let nothing distract you
[21:10] keep your eyes set and keep going until
[21:14] we get to the man of God I think that's
[21:17] what we need to do keep your eyes
[21:20] focused until you reach the destiny and
[21:24] your destiny is Jesus Christ you can't
[21:30] believe and when I say believe on him
[21:32] I'm not talking about on Christ by way
[21:35] of a denominational explanation because
[21:40] you see none of them are right they are
[21:44] all wrong about brothers why you saying
[21:47] you right I'm not I'm just saying all
[21:49] organizations and denominations are
[21:52] wrong because they add and take away
[21:55] from the word you so all you mean
[21:58] brother we see you can be a denomination
[22:00] in this message and if you are you're
[22:04] not going to produce what this word says
[22:11] I'm not saying all denominations and all
[22:14] organizations are going to hell I could
[22:17] never say that because once I was there
[22:20] I'd look at those places as being a
[22:22] place where God sometimes preserved
[22:25] people until they come to the truth the
[22:31] Bible tells us according to st. John 14
[22:33] if we believe on him as the Scriptures
[22:36] have says he that is identification
[22:39] believing on him as the scripture has
[22:42] said right now I must say something
[22:45] which is going to be quite harsh because
[22:47] remember E
[22:49] believe everything except when the devil
[22:52] taught interpreted one word wrong and
[22:55] she broke the scripture and it caused
[22:58] death to every one of us think about it
[23:01] what part of the word will we allow
[23:03] Satan to make us disbelieve because once
[23:07] you disbelieve guess what death sets in
[23:11] it's automatic it is an automatic my
[23:16] point is this how are we're going to
[23:18] come to perfection if we do not go the
[23:22] provided way we must go the provided way
[23:27] however God provides is the way we must
[23:30] go in order to have eternal life is that
[23:34] right we didn't know and we know for an
[23:38] example just how it is always is
[23:41] whenever there's our original there's
[23:43] always a copycat
[23:44] there's always something Amen that man
[23:47] will design to look like the very thing
[23:50] and winning and in reality it is not so
[23:54] what do you mean brother books you know
[23:56] in the days of Noah I wouldn't know how
[23:59] many people built boats thinking that it
[24:02] was going to work you see because you
[24:07] got to understand this thing was
[24:08] fascinating that this man will build an
[24:12] ark on top of the mountain where there
[24:15] is no water and he's keep preaching a
[24:18] lot of water is coming can you imagine
[24:22] the mockery and the jokes and everything
[24:26] that it would have taken place because
[24:28] of this thing but to see no one knew he
[24:33] heard from God and he knew no matter
[24:36] what mockery no matter how people made
[24:39] fun of him he had to speak to the
[24:42] pattern what sis didn't make to build
[24:47] such a huge rock with one door think
[24:53] about it what if something should happen
[24:55] how you going to escape you understand
[24:59] what I'm saying you know people made the
[25:00] market but you see no
[25:03] knew that he was this disart was
[25:06] salvation he knew that it was the only
[25:10] thing no matter how grand other boats
[25:14] may have been or how grand people may
[25:17] have built shelters he knew that this
[25:20] art was going to survive the storm that
[25:22] was coming and what I'm saying is he
[25:25] stayed with the word in spite of the
[25:29] pressure that was given to him he stayed
[25:32] with the word my thought is to say this
[25:35] as I was saying to other people I said
[25:39] how the scripture have laid there for so
[25:42] long you've heard some people preach
[25:44] about it the statue of a perfect man and
[25:46] all of these things and but how many
[25:49] people have emphasized fully that this
[25:54] is a must it's not a choice it must be
[26:02] so in order to enter into the city only
[26:09] the character of Christ will enter into
[26:13] the city and and my thing is this you
[26:16] say what do you mean it is a thing that
[26:19] God had excuse me has hidden and he's
[26:22] given to his own children his children
[26:25] it is because they are the only ones
[26:29] that can ever come into the perfect
[26:32] statue of Christ and when God comes to a
[26:35] you must be born again that is not an
[26:38] option the word lost shows that it is it
[26:46] has to be you don't have a choice there
[26:50] are penalties if this is not done and
[26:53] you say what do you mean what are you
[26:55] trying to get to just a moment because I
[26:58] want you to understand that when it
[27:00] comes to character cry you cannot do it
[27:04] no man can add one cubit to his statue
[27:07] right but my quick reasons why this
[27:12] means so much to me I used to be
[27:14] apostolic we
[27:16] - I used to dance we should speak in
[27:19] tongues run up and down the aisle see a
[27:21] miracle every now and again you
[27:23] understand me we thought we had it me we
[27:27] thought that was it
[27:29] right then you find over here people
[27:32] doing this and people doing that and and
[27:34] you just couldn't figure it out how they
[27:36] have the Holy Ghost they can do this and
[27:37] do that and still do that right then the
[27:41] message comes we didn't know we were
[27:44] naked we actually thought we were
[27:46] clothed and the message comes and he
[27:49] finds us naked right right but let's
[27:54] understand he said when the Son of Man
[27:56] come when he comes shall he find faith
[28:00] but he didn't it wasn't there everything
[28:04] we had was hybrid it had the appearance
[28:08] of the genuine but if he would hold it
[28:12] under the light it was kind of fit it
[28:15] looked like the real thing
[28:16] but it was manufactured not by God but
[28:22] by man and I fear that that's what's
[28:25] happening now in this message we have
[28:28] lifts it means persons this man is great
[28:33] and that man is great and they'll all
[28:35] get him for your convention and if you
[28:37] get him for your convention this is
[28:39] going to happen and it never happens
[28:45] they get excited they shout they praise
[28:49] God and they leave out the same way that
[28:51] came in and I don't mean no harm
[28:54] aren't we tired of that we want real we
[28:58] want real change we won't real word and
[29:01] the only way we bring real word is to go
[29:04] back to the real interpretation it
[29:07] doesn't matter how plain it may sound as
[29:09] long as it works
[29:13] but we've had the Philistines and
[29:15] they've come among us with the great
[29:18] swelling words and being more educated
[29:21] than others because they're more
[29:22] educated in others those who are
[29:24] illiterate and can't read or write and
[29:26] really pronounce words correctly or left
[29:29] on the own
[29:30] sideline and those are the kind of
[29:32] people that God can use is that alright
[29:38] see your life proves what you are that
[29:44] right and the Bible said by your fruits
[29:47] see people's well i i'm message and you
[29:50] know i'm a christian but they're no
[29:52] fruits you know love brotherly kindness
[29:57] long-suffering patience you know you
[30:01] have to almost push people to pray like
[30:08] i heard her brother say he he II thought
[30:10] the epistles was a brother he said he
[30:19] thought the epistles was brothers to the
[30:20] Apostles he didn't know that just shows
[30:29] you sometimes people because they don't
[30:32] know the Bible they don't know oh and if
[30:40] you trying to make yourself act sweet
[30:43] and humble and so forth then you are
[30:47] still outside of the kingdom now how
[30:51] many people we know that do that huh
[30:54] they act they act Christianity we had it
[30:57] you know even in Pentecost but we have
[30:59] it among us and I don't mean no harm
[31:03] because I'm a preacher I see things that
[31:06] other people don't see
[31:07] i I see it from the top level and you
[31:12] think to yourself these people are
[31:14] leading and guiding other people and
[31:16] they themselves need to be corrected
[31:19] who's going to correct him you know hear
[31:23] what I'm saying
[31:24] who's going correct them and the people
[31:27] don't understand these people is that
[31:29] the word the Bible said if the blind
[31:31] leader leads the blind they both fall in
[31:33] the ditch you know what we do we look
[31:36] over yonder instead of looking here
[31:40] that's why God has given us the message
[31:44] we need to read it we need to listen to
[31:47] it we need to bring it to the Bible
[31:49] hallelujah because the message make this
[31:52] Bible live hallelujah it is the
[31:57] revelation of this is that right in
[32:01] other words the New Testaments the
[32:03] revelation of the Old Testament and the
[32:06] message is the revelation of the new
[32:08] that's what it is they are the same
[32:13] they're showing to us that Jesus Christ
[32:15] is the same yesterday today and forever
[32:19] he does not change that's one thing you
[32:22] can hold about God he doesn't change and
[32:24] if God doesn't change that mean his
[32:26] character doesn't change is that right
[32:29] in an all to be compatible to God you
[32:32] must come up to the kind of character
[32:34] that he is God ain't gonna stoop down to
[32:38] your character you got to come up to his
[32:41] character as we said today
[32:46] you know this morning Esau and he looked
[32:48] like he was the better man but it was
[32:52] Jacob see it's what's in the heart that
[32:54] makes you who you are is that right this
[32:58] is what the message of show listen is so
[33:00] true so true I've seen so much and I
[33:03] can't get it out like I really want to
[33:04] but let me say it like this it is the
[33:07] seed of God in you that brings the
[33:11] change and that seed cannot live until
[33:16] you die how's it everything other than
[33:20] that you sure what do you mean you can
[33:21] have the Holy Ghost on your flesh you
[33:23] can shout and dance you can have the
[33:26] Holy Ghost on your spirit hallelujah and
[33:29] likewise and currently sweet daddy what
[33:32] God looking for he looking for those who
[33:34] are truly born again that means it must
[33:37] get down into the soul where the seed is
[33:41] once the seed is quickening it was
[33:43] German ties it'll grow up into Christ
[33:46] and all you have to do is feed it water
[33:50] it and the image of Christ you you don't
[33:54] change it it changes you
[33:57] it pushes out all the darkness in your
[34:00] life
[34:02] Hitler logo becomes a struggle because
[34:06] the life in you is the the life that
[34:09] battles fights the darkness and pushes
[34:12] it out brings it to the surface and
[34:15] pushes it out Jesus Christ is the same
[34:18] yesterday today and forever look look at
[34:21] look at the change in which God made
[34:23] with Peter huh that's why Peter can
[34:26] write add to your faith virtue this is
[34:30] the divine nature of God Peter didn't
[34:32] know what that was before the the day of
[34:36] Pentecost Peter was a fighter hallelujah
[34:40] Peter was a traitor he betrayed Christ
[34:44] come on that's real he did worse than
[34:47] Judas as far as I'm concerned he denied
[34:50] in three times
[34:51] Judas only had the one but it was the
[34:54] seed John that was only inside of him
[34:57] that made the difference he got a
[35:00] quickening he was up in the upper room
[35:03] where they were and however they died
[35:05] and riding up there and when the Holy
[35:07] Ghost came hallelujah Peter was never
[35:10] the same so he knew what was necessary
[35:14] for us to live this life and he knew he
[35:18] could right under the inspiration the
[35:21] divine nature of God the thing that gets
[35:24] me because they talk about the entrance
[35:26] and brother branham came in this last
[35:28] day and he preached the statue of a
[35:30] perfect man now what how many scriptures
[35:33] you how many preachers you hear
[35:35] constantly talking about that because we
[35:39] see that the bride of Jesus Christ is
[35:40] getting off course Holy Ghost hallelujah
[35:45] huh I want to tell you this it meant
[35:48] those Amen that's out outside of what we
[35:51] call how do we say the message you see
[35:56] more signs and wonders there than you do
[35:59] here you know why because at least they
[36:03] got what they have they believe it we've
[36:06] got the whole book
[36:10] we have the whole book that means
[36:13] everything in the book has potential to
[36:17] come alive Oh somebody help me here
[36:22] we've got the whole book but you see
[36:25] what hinders us is our old abilities
[36:28] because we think we can help God you
[36:32] can't help God see that's the thing
[36:38] every time you and I get in a position
[36:41] where we think we can help God you've
[36:43] messed up God needs somebody who really
[36:46] knows ain't no good God needs somebody
[36:48] that knows Amen that they can't do
[36:52] nothing without him that's what the
[36:56] pulse it ain't God that lives for this
[36:58] Christ that lives in me see Paul had
[37:01] come to that place he realized I can't
[37:03] help him he's the only one that could
[37:06] help but I need to be dead I need to
[37:10] come to a place where I have pushed out
[37:13] myself so that God can come in Oh help
[37:19] me Jesus I'm not gonna be long right a
[37:23] man she's the whole picture from Genesis
[37:27] to Revelation it's nothing wrong it's
[37:29] ellingham materializing so he can be
[37:32] touched feel and in the Millennium there
[37:35] is Eliam sitting on the throne see and
[37:37] that's right with all of his subjects
[37:40] around him that he protestin ated before
[37:44] the foundation of the world so you got
[37:47] to understand this whole thing is that
[37:50] now in this last day you are the Jesus
[37:53] Christ the world will see you are the
[37:58] Jesus Christ that the world would see if
[38:01] you allow your light to be here if you
[38:04] put it under a bushel if you cause
[38:06] you're like not to be seen then you are
[38:09] missing out on the opportunity in which
[38:12] God placed you here for
[38:14] we're not religion and we shouldn't wear
[38:19] a cloak of message but our word we
[38:22] supposed to be
[38:24] you understand me we don't need a
[38:27] religion we need action
[38:29] we need life we need the world of God to
[38:32] be live through us you and I should
[38:37] never stop until this happens we must
[38:40] allow that to happen and the point is is
[38:43] when you stop thinking you something and
[38:45] you can help you can help God we do it
[38:48] and if you're not careful you know even
[38:51] even as someone who can sing you think
[38:54] because you can do it look you know move
[38:55] your head and do a little something
[38:57] you're here you're gonna answer are you
[38:58] gonna make it better y'all know they do
[39:02] it if you not kept you'll do it you know
[39:06] sometimes you're on the piano whatever
[39:08] and whatever and I'm not I'm cracking on
[39:11] nobody I'm just saying we have to be
[39:13] careful that we're not trying to help
[39:15] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit must
[39:18] lead us and we're not supposed to lead
[39:20] the Holy Spirit that's all I'm saying
[39:23] and that's where we have fallen because
[39:27] even though even among our ranks we
[39:29] figure if we could set the message in a
[39:32] certain way and reach a certain climax
[39:35] the people going to get excited and God
[39:38] is gonna be happy with it
[39:39] no because the people get excited and
[39:43] because the anointing fall doesn't mean
[39:44] that God is satisfied woo somebody help
[39:48] me here is that right brother we know
[39:52] what David did he put the rock on a
[39:54] different cart and they were singing and
[39:55] jumping and shouting and praising God
[39:57] like the real Pentecostals and then the
[39:59] man touched and what happened
[40:01] it brought death see anything all of
[40:05] that can still be a deception when Jesus
[40:10] come back he gonna look for those who
[40:12] stayed with the word am I making sense
[40:17] now to be perfect right this is what God
[40:21] is trying to tell us in all of you to be
[40:24] perfect that seed I put in you must be
[40:26] German ties and there is a law you must
[40:32] die and rot in order to live where do
[40:36] you
[40:37] Dyanne rot on your knees somewhere where
[40:41] you can pray and you can ask God to kill
[40:44] you you become Abraham and Isaac
[40:50] hallelujah
[40:51] you're bringing the sacrifice where God
[40:54] can slay you and understand when God
[40:56] gets you to that place where you ought
[40:58] to be slain
[41:00] guess what he says I have myself a
[41:03] sacrifice he then gives you his
[41:07] sacrifice which is Christ himself hmm oh
[41:12] my you love the Lord when we are
[41:16] insufficient
[41:18] perfect shrimp I permit weakness
[41:21] ourselves then we are subject to you to
[41:24] God's Spirit as long as we think we can
[41:28] do it then we can't do it but when we
[41:33] get to a place where we know we can't do
[41:36] it then we yield ourselves to God and he
[41:40] does it so then if it's us trying to do
[41:45] it will fail but if we'll just yield
[41:49] ourselves to God then God can't fail
[41:53] there's only one thing that God cannot
[41:56] do and that's fail he can he can do
[42:00] anything else but failed he cannot fail
[42:05] so as long as we're trying in ourselves
[42:08] and depending on our own abilities there
[42:12] you go
[42:13] and so far well you see you see you said
[42:17] what what do you mean that's why Paul
[42:19] said I did not come to you with
[42:20] excellence of speech
[42:22] I couldn't used some of these great
[42:24] Greek words on you I could have
[42:26] spellbound you he said but I didn't come
[42:29] with that with man's devices I came with
[42:33] one thing and that is the power of the
[42:35] Holy Ghost see that is what the message
[42:38] is it is to release the power of the
[42:41] Holy Ghost what was all Elijah a John is
[42:45] supposed to be on Elijah but but Elijah
[42:48] had to die to himself
[42:51] he had to die in rot to get with he God
[42:54] and you and I must die and rot to get
[42:57] with what he had that's the truth
[43:01] there's only we trying in ourselves and
[43:04] depending on our own abilities and so
[43:06] forth well we'll do nothing
[43:09] but when we get to a place where we know
[43:12] we're nothing then God can use us the
[43:16] important thing of important things that
[43:18] we must master now remember this
[43:20] especially you young preachers and lay
[43:23] members alike there's one thing that
[43:26] we've got to master why did he say that
[43:29] why did God allow him to say that
[43:32] because he knew that's where the problem
[43:33] would be he knew that if we expect to
[43:37] fulfill God's desire in our life that is
[43:39] if we have to master the thought of
[43:42] human ability if we ever get to a spot
[43:45] where we think that we can do it with
[43:47] our own internal intelligence and our
[43:50] own ability we've got to master that in
[43:53] such a way that when we get rid of the
[43:56] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[43:59] use us all human abilities and you know
[44:04] we do we have to be really careful on
[44:08] that that we are literally when I'm when
[44:11] I message calm or when God gives us a
[44:13] message we're not trying to
[44:15] intellectually design it we're trying
[44:18] y'all hear what I'm saying you and I are
[44:20] not here to impress people we're here to
[44:23] bring the word whether they like it or
[44:26] not right we want to project the very
[44:30] thoughts and words of God that's it it's
[44:35] all you not deep enough I'll tell you
[44:37] what when you get as deep as the word or
[44:39] too deep
[44:40] are far deeper than the word can take
[44:42] you then let me know because one word of
[44:46] the word is deep this is talking about
[44:49] brother the Bible says we all heard me
[44:52] say this the other night universe one
[44:55] verse created the whole world and all
[44:58] the universe in the beginning God
[45:02] created the heavens
[45:03] in the earth one statement created
[45:06] everything in all of eternity all that
[45:11] has been created is resting upon those
[45:14] that verse think about it it's holding
[45:21] everything together because God said let
[45:23] there be and think about it if you and I
[45:29] are creators little creators made off of
[45:33] the great God Elohim think about it if
[45:37] we get in the mind frame that we're
[45:39] going to die out to everything that God
[45:42] that God wants us to die out to rot so
[45:45] that we can he can live with us can you
[45:47] and I can't even fathom the things that
[45:50] God wants to do with this little bride
[45:53] everybody said well you know we just I
[45:58] don't know we were word word word let me
[46:01] tell you something the Bible said my
[46:03] word is spirit and truth spirit and life
[46:07] not letter you understand me I can
[46:12] remember this thing backward and forward
[46:14] and it'll do me no good until it's
[46:16] living it is the Living Word that
[46:20] brother Branham is talking about right
[46:22] it is the Epistle you are the Living
[46:25] Word you're supposed to be the Epistle
[46:26] you supposed to be written in a read of
[46:29] all men you and me when somebody who
[46:31] can't read they should be able to see
[46:33] God in you and it could be eight is that
[46:37] right those people didn't know Paul but
[46:42] they saw Jesus and Paul and they really
[46:45] believe if I could just get under the
[46:47] shadow of him I'll be healed that wasn't
[46:51] just given football that's for the bride
[46:53] of Jesus Christ I'm almost done look
[47:03] what he says when we expect him saying
[47:06] this guy he's a great person this is a
[47:10] great person I'll just lean upon him
[47:13] that's displeasing to God when you
[47:17] do that there are no great wands among
[47:21] us hello all have sinned and come short
[47:26] of the glory of God and when we began to
[47:29] give man God's glory you're in trouble
[47:32] he is displeased that's why these great
[47:35] meetings never accomplished anything
[47:38] because we give him in praise and glory
[47:42] when it ought to be gone to God all of
[47:46] it not some of it all if you believe the
[47:51] message that's what he says perfect
[47:53] strength perfect weakness he said it
[47:55] displeased God when you do that we must
[48:00] learn or lean upon God and God alone we
[48:04] mustn't trust the ability of ourselves
[48:06] or any man we must completely yield to
[48:11] God no ability I don't care whose it is
[48:15] we'll never be a beautiful in the sight
[48:19] of God see it looked like God is using
[48:22] them but at the end of the day where is
[48:25] the change where's the change people
[48:30] wherever the prophet of God went to a
[48:33] meeting there was a change and that same
[48:37] kind of a change must happen in us we
[48:44] must bring change is that right that's
[48:46] what he said he said the bride of Jesus
[48:48] Christ has the ability to change the
[48:52] atmosphere think about how sweet it was
[48:57] here this morning I don't know where
[48:59] anybody was blessed but I know I was
[49:01] there was such an anointing such a sweet
[49:04] anointing here I don't even know what my
[49:07] sister was playing but I got connected
[49:09] and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just
[49:11] came over hmm I'm almost done I'm almost
[49:19] done this quote is the last because I
[49:22] want you to get over here understand and
[49:24] we're gonna make the city you cannot
[49:26] even depend upon yourself
[49:30] that right oh it's true I was the pastor
[49:32] in Lima Ohio and I didn't know this but
[49:36] the people said brother Brooks we so
[49:39] depended on you to bring the undaunted
[49:43] that's what they told me so even the
[49:45] Sony was an even when I it didn't go
[49:48] across when I was up there so leaning I
[49:50] knew when brother Brooks come it was
[49:51] going to happen who is brother Brooks
[49:55] and they were spiritually being depleted
[49:58] because they were looking at me instead
[50:01] of him that's why God moved me guarding
[50:05] on a chair his glory with no man and I
[50:09] always told us and listen don't put me
[50:11] nowhere where God will cause me to fall
[50:14] please don't do that to me because God
[50:20] will cause a minister to fall just to
[50:23] get the people's eyes back on him think
[50:26] about the people of God and being
[50:30] ministers follow more than one way you
[50:32] know it is not always sexually sometime
[50:36] they fall because they think there's
[50:37] something they begin to get lifted up
[50:40] and even though they could articulate
[50:42] and bring the Word of God you'll find
[50:45] out there's no power behind it huh cuz
[50:48] they're taking the glory that's supposed
[50:50] to be God's you can't do it I don't care
[50:57] if you're musician I don't care if
[50:58] you're singer I don't give you a
[50:59] preacher I don't care if your mother
[51:01] whatever you are when anything come
[51:04] good is God who did it and not you
[51:07] always give the glory back to God I'm
[51:11] almost done God has to get all of our
[51:14] abilities out of us before we can
[51:16] achieve his purpose you know sound
[51:26] easier said than done
[51:28] but God has to get all of our abilities
[51:32] now we understand where Paul says I
[51:35] count everything I've ever known as dung
[51:38] it's no good to me it's no good to this
[51:42] ministry I
[51:43] can't use it all I need is God right now
[51:47] right if he's got something for us to do
[51:53] and as long as we feel that we're going
[51:57] doing pretty good job out of it then
[52:01] we'll never be able to be used of God
[52:05] whoo I'm doing a pretty good job Hey
[52:12] that shows ain't nothing happening in
[52:14] your life there are no achievements
[52:17] because let me tell you something only
[52:19] God can make the flowers grow yeah you
[52:24] can pull all the kind of water you want
[52:26] on it and dung it and do everything else
[52:29] but if God don't give the increase it
[52:33] won't grow like I was saying the other
[52:35] day you know the rain comes to manifest
[52:38] to see that it's that is there and it
[52:41] also comes to bring maturity or whatever
[52:44] the seed is you love the Lord and I'll
[52:48] keep ministering on this because people
[52:49] if we're gonna make a heaven this got to
[52:52] change do anybody else know what I'm
[52:56] talking about I'm saying I got I got
[52:59] more changes more changes must be made
[53:01] in my life I mean y'all ready for heaven
[53:05] we can say that with our mouth but our
[53:08] lives gonna say something different we
[53:10] need all of Satan out of our lives
[53:13] is that right brother man don't say like
[53:16] this he said when the blood the power of
[53:18] the the fire of the Holy Ghost falls
[53:20] upon us
[53:21] it burns every demon out of us that's in
[53:26] the future home every demon out of us it
[53:29] doesn't mean you're not tempted but the
[53:31] fire is to kill every demon that's
[53:34] inside and from that the devil can come
[53:37] from the outside but on the inside is
[53:40] you're full of light
[53:42] let's tan to be like gee
[53:51] to be live G older
[54:00] [Music]
[54:25] once again
[54:31] [Music]
[54:39] [Music]
[54:47] all
[54:52] [Music]
[55:08] I'm sorry sisters I do scream sometime
[55:12] and I forget
[55:14] you appreciate everything you know
[55:22] people thought I believe with all my
[55:24] heart I just it's something happening I
[55:27] can't put the thing on it but I know God
[55:29] it's right now opening that door for
[55:33] those who want to change I believe that
[55:37] I believe that right now this is a time
[55:39] if you really want God to change you and
[55:42] to deliver you this is the moment
[55:45] because I believe down the road that day
[55:48] and that time is gonna be shut so this
[55:52] is the day this is the time God has been
[55:57] so good to us
[55:58] and it would be a shame for us to run
[56:01] this place and come short in the
[56:04] lateness of this day in this hour with
[56:06] God is bleeding it and sharing with the
[56:09] people and the Word of God is opening up
[56:11] in a different wave it's bringing us to
[56:13] avoid serious mind and more of a serious
[56:16] consciousness about what brother branham
[56:19] delivered he didn't come to tickle our
[56:22] minds and to give us this great
[56:24] revelation of things and what good is
[56:26] that gonna do us if we don't apply it if
[56:29] it doesn't
[56:30] this must become your life that's why
[56:33] the angel told John eat the whole book
[56:35] it means it must become
[56:37] your life and only God can do it
[56:44] we have you come sing brother one song
[56:46] and it would be
[56:51] everybody wanna be like oh that's all I
