exodus 20:3 beginning at the 20th verse will read down to the 30th everybody had it behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke if not but he were not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy

field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased inherit and in here in the lair let us pray father God we thank you for your mercy and your grace we thank you for being so good to us we pray Lord God that you would bless the service in a special way forgive us for anything we may have said or done Lord forgive us Lord God for any actions we may have done and have not been pleasing in our sight Lord we think of for bringing us through this day we thank you for your amazing grace and your blood that cleanses us from all unrighteousness and father we pray this evening that your perfect will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know I I realized by God's grace that we have been talking about wars we've been talking about battles and the things that we must go through we go through these trials and tests every day but at some point in time our battles must change we're not to have the same battle - Jesus calm if you watch the children of Israel when they came through the land they had different tribes I believe it was about seven or eight of them and they had commissioned that God commissioned him to destroy all of them and God says now if you don't destroy them they will become a thorn in your flesh so we realized by God's grace God commissioned him to overthrow the people of the land even though God had provided them the victory told Joshua wherever you plant your feet I have blessed it it's yours but just like the prophet of God tells us that we must fight for all everything God has promised us we must fight and we realize by God's grace that now our warp warp excuse me weapon tree and our warfare is not counted but the Bible said our warfare is spiritual right pulling down every thrown strong whole everything that exalts itself against the Word of God we supposed to bring it down under our feet we realize by God's grace that Israel fought and killed a lot of people and they destroyed a lot of people and and like we was talking with a brother today you know just how when one man was anointed how he can destroy so many and I believe by God's grace that the same God that they served we serve two because you and I must understand that they were serving God with them God was with them as we read I'll be with you wherever you go I'll be there I'll go before you I will be fought they find you even the Bible says you know no fire nothing shall destroy thee the word tells us them when even you cast into the fire I will be there with you but we realize Amen that Israel didn't always obey God and because of that they were overthrown my message tonight is now it's a time to overthrow your enemy brother Balaam said it in like terms if you don't kill the demon or destroy the demon that demon will destroy you we are in a warfare I wish we could say by God's grace that we we are now having this heavenly experience but that comes down the road you and I Amen by God's grace are in a warfare when you go to bed it's war when you wake up in the morning is war throughout today is war you're fighting Satan every day all day sometimes Satan attack you from places you didn't even know he was coming here he loves to ambush you sometimes when we are ambushed you know it takes us by surprise and we don't know how to act but you know you find out that when Israel was ambushed they called on the name of Jehovah when they did not know what to do the prophets and different ones they were put forth an altar which represented prayer they will literally take a goat or a bull or some kind of sacrifice and and literally burn it unto the Lord before and after and you and I because you know you got to realize Amen that's how prayer is in order to win this battle you got to pray before the battle starts and after the battle is finished think about it Israel was overthrown in the wilderness because they wouldn't stay with the angel everything that Moses tried to tell them to do you always had somebody with a creed or dollar something to overthrow the truth that's what the enemy is all about now it is about the Word of God and you and I must be watching that word carefully that we will not allow somebody's creed or Dogma amen to come and overthrow him in what we know it's true the reason why we don't see all the great miracles and all the great signs and all the great wonders is because somewhere there is some Creed's of men that is ruling over the word hello right so you and I must understand I better explain that in just a moment Jericho was shut in and God told Joshua you go over there and overthrow Jericho you know when you talk about overthrowing something it means to dispose as from a position of power to overcome defeat vanquish hallelujah to put an end to by force you understand me through throw our knock down to overturn topple right it means to knock down in to demolish overthrow is a wonderful word because when we overthrow Satan we supposed to finish him you understand me put him into a place where he can't come back hallelujah is that right remember when God through our overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah God said it'll never be again hallelujah and still to this day hallelujah there is no Sodom and Gomorrah it is but they are under the Red Sea under the Dead Sea is that Alright so we by God's grace even when we come to overthrow we come to overthrow we come to make this kingdom the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ so in order for us to do that we must overthrow the man who's sitting on this so-called throne Satan hallelujah proverbs 21 31 says the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the Lord in other words we cannot trust in anything else other than the Word of God in order to defeat this devil of this day hallelujah your emotions your feelings your thoughts your desires none of that can defeat Satan the only thing that can defeat Satan is the Word of God and brother madam said that was a great weapon tree that God gave us two things that defeat him and God gave us best the best of his of his weapon tree and that is the word and prayer hallelujah now we realize by God's grace amen God he does the things and he puts you in a place where it seems as if the enemy has the advantage of you and that's what makes us threat sometime that's what makes us nervous that's what makes us doubt hallelujah that God is able but God is more than able hallelujah He is God hallelujah do you believe the word sometimes we fail to see that God ain't gonna just overthrow your enemy all at one time hallelujah but the Bible said little and little will I Drive them out hallelujah y'all noise the truth of God did it like that Amen we'd be lifted up as if we did something hallelujah you should all know I wouldn't be lifted up rail remember when David went out and killed ten thousand Saul got jealous as if he was the one who killed a thousand and when they began to sing that song David killed ten thousand is Saul a thousand he became jealous he Hey David for no cause if he had seen that there was no way that David could have killed ten thousand that that was the same God that called Saul to kill a thousand hallelujah sheep but at that time amen day I saw had along some kind of creed I'm the king I'm supposed to kill more see and preachers do the same thing some time with somebody witnesses somebody and bring them all in the church like they do preachers get nervous they get scared and they don't understand that's the hand of God why should I get jealous if you God gives you souls the whole purpose behind you is in it for scenario folks you know it's just it's just that sometimes we get jealous about things that we shouldn't get jealous of it because Amen all the doings is of the Lord hallelujah is that right you couldn't win one soul to the Lord without God in it hallelujah now Samuel he says listen you know in 1st Samuel 17 47 and David is talking to Goliath because Goliath has threatened Israel and now David he's had experience with the bear he's had the experience with the lion and now he's dealing with Goliath but he wanted Goliath to know something he said an awl disassembly she'll know that the Lord sayeth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord and He will give you into our hands y'all understand me God don't care about you getting upset and being in a fight naturally he doesn't work that way if you think you're gonna beat the devil out of somebody he doesn't work that way God does not handle situation in such a way hallelujah God is spirit hallelujah and you and I must realize they meant that you and I if we're going to overthrow the devil we must do it in a spiritual way hallelujah is that right see that's the only way you throw him is by God's Way and God's Way only hallelujah that's okay David understood one thing and in Psalm 27:1 through 8 I love it he said listen the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear you and I have no business fearing the devil or no man who shall I fear we care about all these things you saying you know what Jesus told Pilate when he says I can put you to death he said no you can't he said and the power that you have is what my father's given you you can't do a thing your boss can't do a thing no one can do a thing without God allowing it it's all in God's hands hallelujah whom shall I fear you're not gonna have me in a way that I'm not gonna be able to sleep at night hmm the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid y'all believe the word with the enemy when the wicked even my enemies and foe came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell hallelujah is that right even when Jesus when they came to get him at the time of his crucifixion they want to just grab him and tear him apart and they all fell back was that there hallelujah don't host and camp about me my heart shall not fear the wall should rise against me in this will I have come home my love how I'm not going to shake I'm not going to tremble I'm gonna have confidence in this word hallelujah one thing I've desired of the Lord that will I see after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to be all the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple hallelujah this is what I for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his provision he not all I'm hoping in a time of trouble he says listen at the time when is it when the rapture comes at hand God's gonna hide me when God get ready to to destroy this earth he will hide me hallelujah I don't have to worry about it I'm trusting him and so what the battle is of the Lord I can't win no battle brother man said I can't heal nobody I don't happen he I came here but the healer is here hallelujah I can't win one battle but the one who wins the battle is here hallelujah it is time to overthrow your enemy instead allowing your enemy to always overthrow you the problem is we ain't playing like we are - and in your prayer you gotta press God with faith you can't come to God and hold God I just hope you do you work this situation out no sir the Bible said we supposed to go before his throne boldly hallelujah we supposed to bring forth our petition with God hallelujah who believe me when I lead the altar is finished I don't have to see it I don't have to smell it I don't have to taste it I don't have to feel it I don't need none of these senses here that you see I don't need to hear it I have a sixth sense and that sixth sense it's a faith in God it's God's faith that's able to call those things that be not as though they were see the devil don't want you to do that because you can prophesy and tell Adele no this is mine this is mine this is mine and all of this is mine hallelujah and you won't get one thing is that right Moses said I ain't gonna leave one hoof behind did he leave one hoof behind absolutely not one right why because he knew he came god he use him to overthrow ejup think about it man with the stick in his hand went down to Egypt as one-man invasion see we read about it but do we believe it just like I told somebody I said if you really believe north built an ark and there was a flood you have you got more faith than you know you have hallelujah none of us saw Jesus crucified but if you really believe that he is the savior of the word world you got more faith than you know hallelujah see faith is something that flexes itself all the time when he wants to faith is so simple you don't have to fast 40 days and get faith you don't have to you know well you know cry all night long to get faith hallelujah why are you sitting at the Hebrew boys they prayed all night long and at the end of the test God didn't even show up hallelujah but they say whether he he deliver us or not that's faith we're got not going to bow down to your image in other words I am going to trust his solution and whatever he's desiring for me I am going to trust him and nothing can deter me from trusting him hallelujah oh god help us here really remember it meant coming from Daniel 7 in which he says I believe back there before the interlude and instruction back in the days of Job and so forth that they kept the time by the stars and we understand Stuart listen the prophet of God goes on and say you know what calls the problem with this whole world being destroyed because Satan overthrew mankind this was his as well when he conquered Adam in the Garden of Eden he overthrew Adam and he became the god of this world hallelujah see when you is like a coup you you gather your people of interest and you go in and you thoughts and they take over and when you do that you literally taking over so that you can be in control hallelujah that's what we need to do with the devil because we are in control we are the ones exactly right and you and I must understand that God is looking for something out of us we were not born in here Amen - how could I say it to fear God has not given us a spirit of fear he ain't got nothing to do with what we see this is God's doing hallelujah this is God's doing and if you really believe that your bride hallelujah you need to take a stand hallelujah and stop resting on your senses these natural senses they lied to you but the Word of God is true God said if you ask anything believing in his name believing it it shall come to pass I believe that I believe that we can go on our knees in prayer and when our loved ones back hallelujah Abraham found out the sod Sodom had captured lot he didn't even think about the sins of lot he didn't even think about how lukewarm lot was his love a lot overthrew those who captured a lot and brought back all the goods that's the problem and we're looking at somebody's who did this and they that got you hate the judge none of us are it's whether idiots of yours or not and lot was the inheritance of Abraham who and we understand or back before the time that the world stood upright and then in in the sin of man the over then and then in the sin of man the overthrow of the world and it tilted and the flood came and therefore we have the great ice glaciers and so forth and all of the top and bottom the earth is full of ice we know that hallelujah what was it Amen man became so wicked and so evil God allowed their science to backfire what's happening now atomic bomb hydrogen bomb all of these things have been invented for what the destruction of man to overthrow them and who's doing it God hallelujah y'all hear me God said it's gonna burn how is it gonna burn anything God gonna drop down fire God gonna let the man start it he started he started the flood he will start the burning that's just how smart he is right and you got to realize Amen if God is gonna work with us we need to work with him hallelujah the Bible says in second Timothy 2 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for me and shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents that truth unthankful God knows that truth unholy without natural affection God knows that truth truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good church people traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God charge people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away hallelujah what are you saying everybody that names the name of Jesus Christ supposed to depart from iniquity everybody Amen that that claims the name of Jesus Christ supposed to have power in their lives these signs shall follow them that believe not him damn hallelujah is that all I turn away from the man who don't believe in miracles turn away from the men who don't believe in healings and all of the miraculous things of God turn away from that nonsense what are you saying that's what has overthrown a lot of people in the message because they call it Pentecost we're beyond Pentecost so we don't need speaking in tongues we need it one brother asked me say brother before you speak I said not only do I speak in tongues I got a gift for tongues I said but you know what if the atmosphere in right and ain't nobody calling for God to do nothing it ain't gonna work cuz I can't do it on my own I can jabber I can speak in tongues but I don't know what I'm sayin and why would I do that if I don't know what I'm sayin mmm there are time that God has given me interpretations mmm but that's God I can't do that on my own and I will not do it that but the saddest thing is if I'm that way who else is that way who else is suffering from somebody's Creed you know what they did say okay we put those gifts in the back room and I ain't never seen a back room yet name on top of it for the gifts hallelujah and you know what's so bad about that they look at brother Brandon said well you know he did that well but his gifts were mature there's a time he allowed all those things that take place in his service hallelujah but when he felt like they was ever but you and level that's when he said okay y'all do this before the service but to find out that the devil crept in and said we're not gonna do that because brother Branham put her in the closet or wherever he put him let me say it like this but we must have the wisdom that the prophet of God had you can't put a gift you know in a back room or whatever Amen without seeing it growing mature and ain't no use in speaking in tongues and ain't nobody there to interpret now you can get excited and speak in tongues and that's okay I know the difference I know when a man or woman is rejoicing in the spirit and I know when there's a message whoo hallelujah but you see you know I must understand by God's grace I mean you saw went to a Pentecostal church everybody spoke in tongues now one non person to interpret for speaking in tongues would what we supposed to do and that don't get me [Laughter] you understand me we must overthrow this Creed we must pray God restore the gifts but not only that we must say the Lord restore the life of the people cuz we don't want the gifts if the life is not here hmm we need a life change in this place not just in this place all over the message and because people who are so so awkward brother Bannerman this was I don't care about that it's what they're preaching because if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what they did then we supposed to be doing now did all everything stopped when he left but he knew most of it would go come to a season or in because people's faith is no longer the way it used to be God is not there number one God must become our number one that's the differ between us in Azusa Street God was their number one hallelujah what are you talking about creeds I mean any system or doctrine or formula or religious belief and we got it let me say it like that brother I've said it many talk about Amen song service being a half hour or 45 minutes don't you know if the Holy Ghost comes in here who gonna stop him he said God won't do that yes he will it was in the scripture Amen that that that's why they call that's why they have a saying among the Jews Jesus was a thief because he went and ate the man's corn on the Sabbath day that way is gone he healed on the Sabbath day he said Sabbath amen was it demand was to lord over the Sabbath not the Sabbath over the law over the man we had the Lord over these things we're free folks we are free there are no laws but love that's but reasonable to be free enough to understand when God is moving I've seen people interrupt the Holy Ghost and stop this and stop that and they don't know what they were doing even when I was in South Africa the Holy Ghost was moving we had a tent full of people in the nomination of people more than anybody and and then people were coming to the altar and everything else and this preacher who was a pastor a man came and he interrupted and stopped it me and the brother that was there amen uh-uh we cried we cried we prayed almost all night we talked about it hallelujah less than a year that man is dead so you don't interrupt God like that because of your own personal feelings jealousies and that's what it was he was jealous to see God move like that and he stopped it he tried to do the same thing in Durban and God wouldn't allow him so he left and guess what came out of that meeting a preacher who's now a pastor there in Durban Zulu Church hallelujah you understand me see when God is moving Amen is God overthrowing and when you tried to stop God from overthrowing the enemy you become God's enemy that's why he tell Peter said Peters he said say to get behind me why cuz you telling me you saying something that's not in the world it came to you that's the devil talking right now so he arrested that devil he overthrew him in a moment's time hallelujah is that all right you and I must understand Amen this if we're gonna if we're gonna be what God wants us to be in this message we cannot follow what other people are doing we must stay with what brother Branham said and follow the scriptures right to the end if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's who he is hallelujah oh we're in the bride with we're beyond all that and most of those people can't even right hallelujah I'd rather have a pillow cause to fly in here with everybody shouting in katsudon speaking in tongues and interpreting tongues and healings and whatever they call Pentecost I'd rather see that happening here Amen than anything then what they're following some intellectual stuff and I'll tell you what they put it together and it sounds good but how much how many times you left out feeling like you were Samson oh how many times you feel felt like when you left out of that service you felt like it was really changed see that the word comes to change you it comes to cause people to repent get on that altar and ask God to help them and cleanse them or whatever the case may be it comes to enlighten you to where you are and where you should be it's okay he said listen this is a good quote this is good call coming from Easter seal he's about that Creed that's always been right and wrong wrong trying to overthrow the right it started in Eden and it has because it come down through the ages it comes down to the enter into the national affair it comes down into the church affairs it comes down into the home life Creed trying to rule over rule or ruling ruin trying to overpower push out and we see that things working everywhere and it has had it always has the same thing trying to overrule or overrun when I came to this message there were gifts and power of God people everywhere Michigan you name it times when prep preachers was gonna go somewhere and and all of a sudden a town came forth and the interpretation comes as no it's not the will of the Lord for you to go now it happened and then when the preacher overrode that say he fell I'm a witness the hound through the sea you see him God is just real God talks back to you down through the Old Testament God in the days of the prophets back I got several of them written down there that I will not have time to get to but God in the days of the old prophets in the midst of everything like he did in the Garden of Eden when the true voice of God and the true worship of God was condemned and sent out and killed in the Garden of Eden and the voice of God hushed by the Creed's and jealousies has been that way in the church ever since trying to hush the true voice of God but if you hallelujah but if you notice as soon as the voice of Abel was silent in death God raised up self to take his place which was nothing but a pre Easter a pre resurrection or replacement until reservation came that's when that went for a while down to the Old Testament we find it going the prophets God kept his voice alive with the prophets they spoke the Word of God and they stoned them and as soon as they were stoned one and put him away God would rise up another one and they would've thrown that one and put away and God would raise up another one he always kept his witness alive down through the ages he kept his voice alive before the people and all the way from Eden huh see that's what I'm saying what if and I believe it what if God has called this little assembly that keep his voice alive that means we can't allow hallelujah foolishness and look around all but this is the way they do it and this is the way they do it and therefore we supposed to do it like we some kind of organization or some system it is a Creed I never forget it when I lived in Lima me excuse me Columbia South Carolina and we had a brother Amen all the way from Trinidad and he came in our church and he said what this don't look like a message Church I don't forget that one unless is Church supposed to look like it is you know these pitches on the wall makes a message church that's a clean that's nonsense God don't favor this church because we got paintings on the wall I don't care nothing about all that on the wall God cares about your heart what about those old saints of God they had to hide in caves you think they had the picture of Paul on the wall hallelujah y'all knows the truth but people that get offended if you want if they walked in here and then see a painting or something on the wall they say what this don't look like a mess his church nonsense that's a Creed until we overcome this nonsense we ain't going nowhere you and I got a die-in right like I read that quote unless anything dies in rot this is number the truth and I know they're gonna hear me if they listen to it here we are down there in Iowa City and we got all these things up on the on the glass and it's net and and the lady didn't see a cross she says it's just a Christian Church oh my god yeah it's a Christian Church she said well where's the cross is he because even a Christian Church should have a cross if you gonna have anything have a cross Oh y'all get it y'all understand what I'm saying there was nothing she could identify with by what all she saw she could not identify God with an ego she could not identify God with the picture with the vilifies she couldn't identify but she could identify the cross and I told that brother we need a cross up here help us Jesus I want to see God real people I'm not interested in you know being accepted I've been there already and everybody ain't gonna accept you people don't talk about you anyhow no matter how close you walk with God they're gonna talk about you why you have been ordained for persecution the Bible said those who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution hallelujah it's just okay he taught he could do it right let me let me let me let me move back up because he did it himself imma Moses he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out then you're going to be a failure like Moses was yeah and he thought he could do it and that's what's wrong with a lot of preachers they think they can change and transform the people themselves you can't do a thing if the word don't transform them nothing will you can use all your rules and all your regulations and all your law and ain't nothing gonna change them until God change them the only thing we can do is preach the word hoping and trusting that the word will take a place in their hearts but that's what Moses taught right you seen you remember David counted the people in God told David don't number the people why because David that thought by numbing the people amen that he had power to do what he was doing it never was David's power it never was the people it was God the battle is the Lord did not God say that anything about all our good deeds or anything like that it is God finding favor with God went out over and had married a wife and he got him a job herding sheep mmm any merit I just throw the priest a minute in he married his daughter and there was two children born to him and he got a common laborer job and a sheep herder and had herding sheep for 40 years because he failed to put God first 40 years he suffered and went through all of that 40 years because he failed to do God's will or put God first I think that's what happened that's the matter with the church's brother when it gets to a place that we put our church first instead of Christ we're going to right we're going right straight down you put them as an individual put your church first your social life first instead of your spiritual life you going to fail hmm you and I we got a right to this thing hallelujah we think we're crazy because we go to turn hallelujah I get jealous over Catholics 6 o'clock in the morning you find there y'all pack oh we cause people going to Mass don't tell me they do don't do it cuz I used to go to Mass 6 o'clock in the morning 12 o'clock at noon hallelujah and I mean it's just full of folks and then you got what we call the truth the message and hardly nobody shows up what's that what's that one thing for certain if going to church was savory they would be smaller than saved than us hey maybe we need to change houses 6:00 in the morning don't even try hallelujah you see what I'm saying what we don't understand is that the devil has overthrown a lot of us and people don't even notice it we almost like Labor's here we think we you know we rich we increase with good and we have meat or nothing oh how with the church once a week and I with the church amen where's the I with the church amen as if you paying God some dues it's all wrong I don't know I was gonna be preaching like this I wish I had a church fool hallelujah right he said unless a man die and rot in his own thoughts Christ can't get into his heart when you're trying to think for yourself now if I walk up to the altar and say I'm a fine fella I take you I pay my tithe I'll do this you got to dine right there right there to your thoughts now you can't flatter God and God knows that most of our promises ain't that belies as soon as he give us a break we return from it y'all know it's the truth that's why the Bible said it best not to even promise him that don't swear cuz you ain't gonna keep it use it for what the glow you saw a Lord God out of what do i what what do I have have you heard that message what's in your hand David only had a sling but he used it he used it and brother Graham said is just as real today and he's just that fanatically in the side of the world not only the world but on a lot of church members just as phonetic you see that's the thing when you really get serious about God even your own people thank you fanatical you're charged people all that ain't necessary mm-hmm Ike I don't heard that so many times it is necessary somebody said let me tell you something I think about those are Sarah films in and how they they crying holy holy holy Oh all day all day all day don't even get tired it probably said after they finished I'll come to almost whatever I don't know where there's a finisher but after a little oh let me say it one more time oh can I say it again oh you understand me because his holiness is so beyond what we can think of or fathom or or imagine to all you can say is that's the holiest of Holies I my income in my comprehension he's only but he it this there's a place he's holier than the holiness he said we might not even have a stick maybe you only sing a song you can testify something whatever you got do it use it for the glory of God no matter what it is if you can't sing you can't whistle can't testify just pass out tracts do something else let's get going ever what's in your hand use it for the glory of God God always had men who stick by him all the new young you see what I'm saying Israel army all backed up they got away from God that's the only reason why we all feel what he can do to us cuz we done got away from God hallelujah but David he was with him he he he said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want hallelujah see David understood amen I by God's help I will overthrow this position that Goliath says he's God right and David was so confident you know what he said he said listen I think Goliath said it but he took backed him up he says listen if my men if I win then you're you're gonna serve north as Dave you gonna serve my god but if you win then you can serve our God however they are basically saying whoever win must serve the will of God and David was confident oh Lord I don't know where they look no sure he knew it so much so he began to prophesy he said listen man imma tell you you're uncircumcised philistine you don't even have the Holy Ghost and I know what I got hallelujah and because I know I've been circumcised he said I am gonna take your sword and I'm gonna cut your head off with it and guess what David did after that he ran toward the devil he didn't run behind him he didn't turn his back hallelujah he ran and toward the devil and see that's what I'm saying you and I need to start running towards Satan within in our prayers don't run from him because you've got to understand devil has no power over us none the only power Satan has over us is what we give him he has none he was defeated at Calvary he lost his authority hallelujah and almost all his teeth he's just a lion with no teeth hallelujah a bee with no stinger has nothing over us and you and I must realize they meant that we do have the power if you have to say that to yourself every day I have the power and the authority over the devil I have the power and authority of the devil eventually you're gonna believe and once you believe it you'll become a David teach me Lord teach me that way or Lord lead me in the path plane path because of my enemies deliver me not all over unto other will of mine enemies for false witnesses I risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty you know what I had read that many times but I'm gonna tell you something nothing hurts as much as a bold-faced lie told against you when a lie and you know it's a lie and there is no way you can defend yourself I've been there a lie bad lie it's still going on among some people you can't stop them cuz some people love lies you didn't know that oh yeah watch them crazy magazines they got out there a Martian came in visit President Trump stuff like that people loved him they grabbed it they'd love to read crazy stuff they found an you have o in the desert oh my see people love that they see that Mexico I got to read this but give them the truth they won't have nothing to do with it so when allies told about you you know what you got to have a lot of people that's going to believe it and there's nothing you can do to change that you say that's not true it is true they believed all those lies about Jesus didn't it hallelujah see you don't have to worry wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen what dying heart wait I say on the Lord is that right listen that's what that's what David said he said I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living I had a hope I got my eyes focused hallelujah is that right Lord beloved behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God and that's what God wants you to be sons of God not just call he won't action therefore the world North us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and that's what we must understand that in that church in the beginning you had a false vine and a true vine and in this message you got a false vine and a true vine hallelujah that true vine will always believe in the power of the blood hallelujah he that true vine knows I don't care what Jesus my God said I am if it ain't so until the blood has been applied hallelujah amen you and I must understand this thing means something that we can work with our play with it's a real a reality because Jesus will talk back to you he said if you open your heart to Christ he will talk to you yes uh that's a quote coming from what is in your hand I'm a closed with this one second chronicles 34 one through seven I'm gonna read it and said Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign I ate your boy now and he reigned in Jerusalem one and third thirty years and he did what that which was right in the of God and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the God of David his father and in the twelfth year he began to prayer Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved image and the mountain images and they bit and they break down the ultra Balaam in in his presence and the images and what were on high above a man he cut down and the groves and the carved images and in the mountain images he breaking pieces and made dust of them and strode it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altar and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem hallelujah that's what we need to do burn some of them priests on the altars Oh merci they need a real or God help me so Lord and so did he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim you know if you preach their days even in messages you got started getting into people's lives preachers they don't you they're gonna call your wife beater or what was brother Branham mm-hmm they don't want white beat us hmm we don't we don't will we don't beat wives a real righteous person would love correction and so did he that city of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon even unto naphtha live with their Matt talks around about them now you got to understand the flesh do not like being corrected but the soul does hallelujah when you being corrected that there's a grievous moment but then you look at the fruit it produces afterwards and when he had broken down the altar and the groves and he had beaten it the graven image into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel he returned to Jerusalem and I'm gonna leave it right there my point is amen we are over throwers and we're not here to be Oh thrown it has been we are ordained to complete the mission of God and somewhere somehow we're gonna have to break through we're gonna have to get out of this this this this thing and when I say that you know I don't mean that we've got to attack anybody else I'm just saying we must get out of this little schism thing that we we we gotta be we get becoming too formal we becoming starchy we need to let the Holy Ghost come up in here and my point is this we don't we don't have to be beautiful singers let's give God all we got with whatever we got y'all understand me if you really want God to come on the scene you you join with me John let us join together and focus not focusing on the rapture the coming of the Lord and start thinking about what we must do to get back in line right because that bride got out of line and we need to get back in line hallelujah that we may see a catching away of the body of Christ I believe that with all my heart we must overthrow the devil in our lives whatever it may be I cannot do your job you can't do mine but I know the Bible say the prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah and if we just get down the praise that's what the song say when the people get down to pray huh they which are called by my name if they would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways he said then there hear from heaven and I will heal no man that's what we want that's what I want hallelujah less tan in the press Oh Jehovah God Almighty Chrissa be harsh on man [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] I don't know who I was going down to Iowa City I hope and pray that at least one night everybody would come brother Travis needs a ride on Sunday if somebody's going down he like a ride with you I told him I would make this announcement and I think for the eyes it made him announcement and then brother brother Stanford texted me to remind the people of course we don't know if you if you need to if somebody's gonna be here to take him and bring him back you can call brother Stamper and see what the details are would be we're trusting and we're believing that God is gonna do a mighty thing they've been invitations they've walked the streets and had passed out invitations and things like that to the people one of the ladies in the building herself said that she was going to be around so we're trusting that God is going to save some Souls we invited by the wand and other churches we don't know who always show up Friday night
