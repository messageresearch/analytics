[35:25] beautiful
[35:26] um
[35:27] and i think we should we we should you
[35:29] know every song that god brings through
[35:31] him that
[35:33] we can sing we need to sing it
[35:35] amen because it's not just for him it's
[35:37] for the church
[35:39] the fullness of the lord that's
[35:40] wonderful amen well i saw where he said
[35:42] he wrote it but i mean i want to make
[35:44] sure
[35:44] [Laughter]
[35:46] it was really it's really good you'll
[35:47] see i won't have to brag on it but i
[35:49] thank god for the inspiration that god
[35:51] gave him and for those who helped in
[35:54] whatever way you helped
[35:56] uh it's really to me as a masterpiece
[36:02] one thing i want to say by god's grace
[36:04] is that
[36:06] i was telling the brother the other day
[36:10] i take
[36:11] my leadership as a pastor i take it very
[36:14] very seriously
[36:17] i wish i was perfect
[36:19] one day i will be
[36:22] perfect in manifestation
[36:24] i'm already perfect because he made me
[36:25] perfect but i mean when it comes with
[36:27] that manifestation
[36:30] but i can assure you that everything
[36:32] that i bring as the word of god
[36:34] i try my best to make sure that it is
[36:37] the word of god
[36:39] and should i make a mistake it's up to
[36:41] you to tell me
[36:43] and make me know that i've done
[36:44] something wrong
[36:45] [Music]
[36:46] and i want to say to every young person
[36:48] always well
[36:49] i will never purposely deceive you or
[36:52] mislead you
[36:53] in any form of fashion
[36:56] god is my witness he stands as my
[36:58] witness today
[37:00] on what i'm saying
[37:03] by the grace of god i realized and i was
[37:05] telling that brother i said not only do
[37:07] i preach the word
[37:09] for my soul
[37:11] but i have children i have a family
[37:14] that even if they should come back to
[37:15] the lord they should follow
[37:17] the teachings and god knows i want to
[37:20] see all of my family say
[37:22] so
[37:23] i said all of that because it was just
[37:25] weighing on my heart sometimes we we
[37:28] have spirits
[37:29] and spirits have a way of accusing
[37:31] people
[37:32] you think sometimes you see things when
[37:34] you don't see hello i've been there
[37:38] uh by god's grace that's why i always
[37:41] test it first
[37:43] i had somebody say well brother brooke
[37:46] you you confessed too much you you
[37:48] you confessed too much no
[37:50] the bible says
[37:52] if you think that your brother has an
[37:53] art against you
[37:55] think it
[37:56] it's your duty to go to that person even
[37:59] if you're wrong
[38:00] it's okay
[38:01] because you'll be corrected
[38:03] is that right
[38:04] so i thank god for it's grace i had i
[38:06] had to say all of that
[38:07] uh to assure
[38:10] uh you uh
[38:12] and whoever else that whatever the enemy
[38:14] is bringing to your mind about me
[38:17] you know is truly a lie
[38:21] as we stand
[38:23] thank you musicians we really appreciate
[38:25] it
[38:29] i stand amazed on where god has brought
[38:32] me from
[38:35] and i can truly say as they always say
[38:37] he's brought me from a mighty long way
[38:41] i still got some distance
[38:42] [Laughter]
[38:44] but in my heart and mind it's my purpose
[38:47] to achieve
[38:49] the goal in which god said we would make
[38:53] so this is kind of like a part two i i
[38:56] preached this a little bit at in iowa
[38:58] city uh last sunday
[39:00] but i thought that it was
[39:02] something that i should bring to the
[39:04] church here as well
[39:06] i know everybody don't get a chance to
[39:08] look at the youtube because i myself
[39:10] can't say i'm totally faithful to doing
[39:12] it but i do it whenever i can
[39:15] and uh so we thank god for his grace
[39:18] saint john 15 we're going to start at
[39:19] the fifth verse there we'll read from uh
[39:22] the 15 the fifth verse to the ninth and
[39:25] then we'll go to saint john 4 23 and 24.
[39:34] you know i've been dealing with prayer
[39:37] and i think prayer is so wonderful and i
[39:40] think sometimes even fasting maybe god
[39:43] will give me grace to work with that
[39:45] because i'm learning i'm learning you
[39:46] know
[39:47] uh
[39:49] and uh because
[39:51] it is a beautiful thing to fast
[39:53] but you we must learn too fast to
[39:58] not increase faith
[40:00] be fast because we have faith
[40:03] and we also fast because we have a
[40:05] purpose we we need god to do something
[40:09] and
[40:10] [Music]
[40:11] for an example
[40:12] when david's son
[40:14] uh was sick the baby child
[40:17] and the prophet had already told him
[40:20] that the child was going to die
[40:22] it did not hinder
[40:24] david from fasting
[40:26] and praying and count calling on the
[40:28] name of the lord pre-adventure god would
[40:30] change his mind
[40:32] but we realized by god's grace that
[40:36] god did not change his mind and once the
[40:38] fasting was over
[40:40] david was
[40:42] pleased and they couldn't understand why
[40:44] david began to worship and start eating
[40:46] and
[40:47] they thought it should be just the
[40:49] opposite nothing wrong with fasting now
[40:51] don't get me wrong it literally brings
[40:53] you closer to god
[40:54] it's of the afflicting of your soul
[40:57] you afflict your soul so that you can
[41:00] get closer
[41:02] and feel his presence and know his will
[41:06] so anyway let's move on
[41:11] i'd like to entitle this message
[41:14] establishing your position in christ
[41:19] john 15 5-9
[41:21] i am the vine
[41:24] ye are the branches
[41:26] he that abideth in me
[41:28] and i in him
[41:30] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[41:34] without me
[41:35] ye can do nothing
[41:38] if a man abide not in me
[41:41] he is cast forth as a branch
[41:44] and is withered
[41:45] and men gathered them and cast them into
[41:48] the fire and they are burned
[41:51] if you abide in me
[41:53] and my words abide in you
[41:56] you shall ask what ye will and it shall
[41:59] be done unto you you believe the word
[42:02] hearing is my father glorified
[42:05] that you bear much fruit
[42:07] so shall ye be my disciples
[42:11] as the father hath loved me
[42:14] so have i loved you
[42:16] continue ye
[42:18] in my love
[42:22] john 4 23
[42:24] and 24.
[42:34] but the hour cometh
[42:37] and now is
[42:39] when the true worshipers shall worship
[42:43] the father in spirit
[42:45] and
[42:46] in truth
[42:48] for the father seeketh such
[42:51] to worship him
[42:54] god is a spirit
[42:56] and they that worship him must worship
[42:59] him
[43:00] in spirit
[43:02] and in truth
[43:05] let us pray
[43:07] father god we
[43:09] thank you
[43:12] you have ordained us
[43:15] to be your temple
[43:18] even though we gather in this place
[43:22] we know where the throne room is
[43:26] and father we thank you as we
[43:28] speak of you
[43:31] because your word
[43:33] according to saint john
[43:35] out of the mouth of your dear son you
[43:37] said he said father i would that they be
[43:40] one even as we are one
[43:42] and father the very glory that we had
[43:45] and shared together i pray that you
[43:47] would give this glory to them
[43:50] but father here tonight i say because
[43:52] you know uh the depths of my heart
[43:56] you know the depths of all of our hearts
[43:58] we're not glory seekers we're nobody
[44:02] but we just want to be the kind of
[44:05] vessel
[44:06] that will give you glory that will give
[44:08] you honor
[44:10] that would raise up your name
[44:12] as
[44:14] the savior of the world
[44:16] knowing that you are the same yesterday
[44:18] today and forever
[44:20] speak to our hearts
[44:22] commune in our hearts
[44:25] and may your glory be revealed in our
[44:27] hearts
[44:28] so that we would better understand our
[44:30] position
[44:32] in you
[44:34] granted this morning or to tonight as we
[44:37] thank you once again
[44:39] for living in us
[44:41] being in us
[44:42] and most of all hearing our prayer
[44:45] may our prayer be your prayer
[44:49] lord if we should error in our prayer we
[44:51] pray that you would make intercessions
[44:53] for us
[44:54] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[44:57] amen
[44:58] you may be seated
[45:04] i put it in my pocket because it kept
[45:06] falling
[45:13] that tape is not working
[45:19] hey
[45:21] yeah we have to get what's one of these
[45:23] things
[45:26] a rubber band will work too
[45:29] but you know god is so good to us
[45:33] remember we said we worked with teachers
[45:35] lord how to pray
[45:37] prayer is so important
[45:40] it's essential
[45:42] it's a communion with god and we
[45:45] understand that calvary
[45:49] bind
[45:51] the breach
[45:53] we know that calvary made it possible
[45:55] for ben and god
[45:57] to commune and talk with one another
[46:01] without any great sacrifices because
[46:04] he was that sacrifice
[46:07] he was the bridge
[46:09] that brought us back into heavenly
[46:11] places in christ jesus without jesus
[46:14] christ we are nothing we can't do
[46:17] nothing
[46:18] he
[46:19] as he said he he is divine and we're the
[46:22] branches
[46:24] in other words the life that's in the
[46:25] vine must be in us otherwise we can't do
[46:28] nothing
[46:30] even jesus himself who was a man yet god
[46:33] said i can't do nothing except the
[46:35] father show me
[46:37] same with us we are
[46:39] part of him
[46:42] he is the creator and by his grace he
[46:45] has made us little creators
[46:48] the scripture talks about abiding in him
[46:50] that means residing in him that means
[46:53] living in him walk in the spirit talk in
[46:55] the spirit whatever you do even paul
[46:57] says do everything in the spirit
[47:00] that spirit is not a human spirit it is
[47:03] christ
[47:04] the holy spirit
[47:06] so god intends for us a man to walk in
[47:09] his spirit that's the only way that he
[47:10] can be glorified
[47:13] the bible tells us also that if we are
[47:15] in him we will bear fruit that means you
[47:17] won't have to do anything the fruit
[47:19] itself will come through you
[47:22] it is his process
[47:25] it is the the life of the vine to
[47:27] produce fruit on the branches
[47:31] all we have to do is remain
[47:34] connected
[47:35] and abiding
[47:37] we look at this thing and
[47:39] jesus says in that ninth verse which i
[47:41] lie love of the 15th chapter as the
[47:43] father has loved me so i
[47:46] so have i loved you continue ye
[47:50] in my love now when you think about this
[47:54] love this is unconditional love this
[47:56] love is a love that god gave us before
[47:59] the foundation of the world the bible
[48:01] says according to saint john 3 16 god so
[48:05] loved the world that he gave his only
[48:06] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[48:09] him shall not perish but have
[48:11] everlasting life i love that word
[48:13] believeth that e.t.h means continue to
[48:16] believe
[48:18] and we're living in a time where
[48:20] everybody declare that they're
[48:22] worshiping god
[48:24] but the bible says in this hour which is
[48:26] what we call the last days
[48:29] jesus said you must worship me in spirit
[48:32] and truth the father seek as such
[48:36] what is the father the father is the
[48:37] holy ghost the father is the holy spirit
[48:40] however you want to say it
[48:42] the father is god
[48:44] god in creation
[48:47] and that's the part of god no man has
[48:49] seen
[48:50] the bible says no man has seen him he's
[48:52] a spirit
[48:53] it's like the wind you never see it but
[48:56] you can see the effects of it
[48:58] that's how it is with god you can't see
[49:00] him the spirit part of him
[49:03] but he can declare himself
[49:05] he can declare his presence
[49:08] by the effects
[49:11] right
[49:12] that's why when people were being healed
[49:14] and delivered the blind eyes being
[49:16] opened jesus said that's not me
[49:19] but my father
[49:21] and i come in his name
[49:23] that he might be glorified so is it with
[49:26] us
[49:27] there is no healing power in us it's god
[49:30] in you
[49:32] the hope of glory
[49:34] so we understand the hour has come
[49:37] spirit and truth
[49:40] and this is why it's so important to
[49:42] understand that god is one
[49:45] he told israel that god cannot lie
[49:49] god the lord thy god is one
[49:53] not three personalities in one person or
[49:56] one being because that would make god
[49:58] schizophrenic
[50:00] if you had three personalities in you
[50:02] you would be locked up in the crazy
[50:04] house
[50:06] except they'd be agreeing
[50:08] and if you had three persons in you now
[50:10] let me say it like this if you had three
[50:13] of parts of god in you like that which
[50:15] one started first
[50:18] see god is eternal so he never had a
[50:20] beginning nor ending
[50:23] when we say
[50:24] god is a spirit and this is why you know
[50:27] people don't understand you can use this
[50:29] body you can clap you can raise your
[50:31] hand you can do all you want that's
[50:32] praise
[50:34] but when it comes to worship
[50:37] only a few can really worship him
[50:41] and worship is not
[50:42] singing or dancing or shouting or
[50:45] praising god worship is
[50:48] living
[50:49] amen
[50:50] when you live for god
[50:52] that's the greatest worship
[50:54] you could possibly give god
[50:57] you know i looked and i think i've said
[50:59] this before when when i was in south
[51:01] carolina there was a young man that
[51:03] looked just like michael jackson
[51:05] same kind of hair same kind of
[51:06] everything and i don't know whether he
[51:08] could sing or not
[51:09] but but he was impersonating michael
[51:11] jackson and listen i said to myself well
[51:14] that's the greatest
[51:17] worship he could give to michael jackson
[51:20] to impersonate him to love him so much
[51:23] to you want to look like him act like
[51:25] him you know everything he did that's
[51:27] what you want to do that's god
[51:30] that's worshiping god you want to look
[51:33] like him you want to walk like him you
[51:34] want to act like him you want to talk
[51:36] like him you want to be so much like him
[51:39] like they were
[51:41] in antioch
[51:42] when they first called the christian
[51:44] call those people christians
[51:46] now we look at this thing and i'm going
[51:48] to try my best not to be too long every
[51:49] time i say that usually i
[51:51] take it too long
[51:53] but we have to uh
[51:55] how can i say it
[51:56] in in the world today in where we are
[51:59] today we have to change
[52:01] uh you know mentally what we think of
[52:03] god spiritually what we think of god
[52:06] consciously what we think of god solely
[52:08] what we think of god because
[52:11] most of us have been deceived
[52:14] yeah i'm not saying you deceive now
[52:17] but there was a time that every one of
[52:18] us was deceived
[52:21] and the bible said that everybody that
[52:23] came out of the laodicean age was
[52:24] deceived
[52:26] they were blind and naked and didn't
[52:29] even know it
[52:30] and then we come to the message and we
[52:32] find out that god is not uh no
[52:35] denomination or organization is the
[52:37] thing that you're supposed to be
[52:38] connected to
[52:40] the only person you're supposed to be
[52:41] connected to is god
[52:43] amen
[52:44] those systems don't mean a thing they
[52:46] cannot save you they cannot change you
[52:49] they cannot convert you all of those
[52:52] things comes only by god who is the holy
[52:55] spirit amen you understand me
[52:59] now we know by god's grace
[53:01] and we said that
[53:03] even the bible are pretty this way
[53:06] because i want to mix some of this in
[53:08] when the seals were open brother adam
[53:10] said it put us back into the place
[53:12] before the fall well before the fall
[53:15] there was no altar that's right amen
[53:18] before the fall there was no building
[53:21] amen before the fall there was nothing
[53:24] but relationship that they had with god
[53:29] and all we know that as far as on the
[53:31] record the bible said in the cool of the
[53:33] evening god would come down for
[53:36] fellowship
[53:38] i've had scientists have said that the
[53:41] dimensions were so connected to god in
[53:45] heaven or the earth in heaven was so
[53:48] connected that that that even adam and
[53:51] adam could listen to the angels sing in
[53:53] the morning
[53:55] i don't know how true that is but you
[53:57] see
[53:58] that's where god is taking us
[54:01] to bind heaven and earth again
[54:06] amen and everything you say no brother
[54:09] that came yes it is because the bible
[54:12] says in the prayer lord
[54:15] teach us how to pray
[54:17] and one of the things he said let thy
[54:19] will be done amen in earth
[54:23] as it is in heaven amen so heaven and
[54:25] earth is supposed to come together amen
[54:31] can you imagine
[54:33] going through all of this what is the
[54:35] purpose
[54:36] of all those saints who have died
[54:40] all the saints who've gone on
[54:43] who's desiring to come back to the earth
[54:46] for what
[54:47] because this is your original home
[54:51] this is where god created you fleshly
[54:54] you know what i'm saying
[54:55] this is where he breathed the breath of
[54:58] life in adam
[54:59] amen and god is going to recreate this
[55:02] thing
[55:04] you know renovate it as the prophet of
[55:06] god use he used the word renovate in in
[55:09] in in in the uh future home
[55:13] and god will renovate and he says listen
[55:15] this is what god must do for you
[55:19] you and me as individuals god has to
[55:22] renovate amen it's not enough to be
[55:25] justified it's not enough to be
[55:27] sanctified i'm saying i don't do nothing
[55:29] wrong well with that attitude you've
[55:31] already done wrong amen because the
[55:34] bible says amen that your sin your
[55:36] righteousness is as filthy rags that's
[55:38] right amen hallelujah the bible said
[55:42] even those who have not even sinned
[55:44] after the similitude of adam will be
[55:46] judged so you and i without the blood of
[55:50] jesus christ we're nothing but sinners
[55:54] but thank god for election
[55:57] thank god uh uh for predestination
[56:01] that god knew you
[56:03] he knew you before the foundation of the
[56:06] world he knew every trial every
[56:08] situation everything every fall every
[56:11] get up every lay down every whatever god
[56:14] knew all of that and guess what he still
[56:17] loved you
[56:20] god just didn't give us unconditional
[56:23] love his love has always been
[56:26] unconditional
[56:28] that's right amen
[56:30] there was no priesthood
[56:34] in the garden
[56:36] there was no traditions there was no
[56:39] easter there was no there was no
[56:42] you know
[56:43] what with that uh i want to say
[56:44] christmas but santa claus days none of
[56:46] that
[56:48] fourth of julys
[56:51] nothing
[56:52] the whole
[56:54] realm
[56:55] was based upon worship
[56:58] and serving god
[57:00] and manifesting god in the flesh
[57:04] because you see no man could see god
[57:07] but when god
[57:09] enveloped and dwelt in
[57:11] mr adam and mrs adam
[57:13] that that the whole creation even angels
[57:17] would be were able to see something they
[57:19] had never seen before
[57:21] because remember that spirit of god was
[57:24] always veiled
[57:26] even in heaven
[57:28] lucifer
[57:29] was the covering angel
[57:31] he veiled god
[57:34] so if anybody knew anything about god he
[57:37] did
[57:39] but even lucifer
[57:41] could never have a true revelation of
[57:43] who he was
[57:45] because only god gives revelation
[57:47] and if lucifer had known and had seen
[57:51] there was no other god he would have
[57:52] never desired to be one
[57:55] he didn't see it
[57:57] yet we come in a day where god is trying
[57:59] to produce not trying where god is
[58:02] producing and creating himself again in
[58:06] human flesh now this stumbles so many
[58:09] people
[58:10] that's why they couldn't see jesus
[58:13] it's always been christ ever since uh
[58:16] genesis all the way to the book of
[58:18] revelation always been christ christ is
[58:21] god the anointing there's only one
[58:23] anointing
[58:24] there's only one holy anointing let me
[58:27] say it like that and that holy anointing
[58:29] is elohim god
[58:33] amen
[58:34] that's why the bible says they that are
[58:37] led by the doctors of divinity
[58:40] no they that are led by the spirit of
[58:43] god what they are the sons of god why
[58:47] did jesus say why why why because that
[58:50] was the way adam and eve were in the
[58:52] beginning they were led by god
[58:55] adam didn't wake up and say you know
[58:56] what i'm just going to name these
[58:58] animals no sir he was led by god to name
[59:02] the animals and because adam and god
[59:05] were so connected the very thoughts that
[59:07] god had adam had this is why the bible
[59:10] says let this mind be in you that was
[59:13] also in christ jesus because the very
[59:15] thoughts of god was in him the bible
[59:18] said in him throughout the fullness of
[59:21] the godhead bodily
[59:24] he was a man yet he was god
[59:30] god of this evil age
[59:33] he says god own thinking
[59:35] god the great spirit in the beginning
[59:38] before there was a beginning he was god
[59:41] and did not did and did and did you know
[59:45] you were in him then amen this is like
[59:48] this is what really excites me because
[59:50] i'm coming to know who i am
[59:53] not isaiah clara's brooks's son
[59:57] i was god's before the world began
[1:00:01] hallelujah the bible said your name my
[1:00:04] name was written in the lamb's book of
[1:00:06] life before the foundation of the world
[1:00:11] that's before god started creating it he
[1:00:14] knew you is that right he told jeremiah
[1:00:17] i knew you before you was formed in your
[1:00:20] mother's womb
[1:00:21] come on somebody you need to whip the
[1:00:23] devil with this truth when the devil
[1:00:26] says you're lost when the devil says
[1:00:27] you're no good when the devil says you
[1:00:29] you won't make it you let him know
[1:00:33] i am a sheep and jesus said my sheep
[1:00:36] here is my voice and the stranger they
[1:00:38] will not follow that's what makes you
[1:00:40] different from all the people of these
[1:00:42] ages because you heard the voice yes
[1:00:47] everybody else saw a prophet
[1:00:49] we saw god behind the prophet like it
[1:00:52] did in israel they saw moses but there
[1:00:54] were two joshua and caleb saw god behind
[1:00:56] moses
[1:00:58] hallelujah one thing about the true sons
[1:01:00] and daughters of god you cannot hide god
[1:01:03] from them amen
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:07] there's no place to hide him amen
[1:01:11] as soon as he opens his mouth
[1:01:13] you know who he is
[1:01:15] you say what do you mean brother that
[1:01:17] woman at the world
[1:01:19] a prostitute
[1:01:21] she heard the voice of jesus
[1:01:25] and she didn't call him bills above
[1:01:28] but she was so connected with god
[1:01:31] because she had a gene seed on the
[1:01:34] inside of her that when that voice began
[1:01:37] to speak she knew something was
[1:01:38] different
[1:01:39] that's why we can listen to the tapes
[1:01:41] that's why we can understand the tapes
[1:01:43] it's not the private man but it's the
[1:01:46] prophet god who is jesus christ on the
[1:01:49] inside
[1:01:50] listen if you come to hear me speak
[1:01:52] you're not going to get nothing
[1:01:54] but if you come to hear god
[1:01:56] he'll drop a seed
[1:01:58] he'll give you something amen
[1:02:00] hallelujah listen
[1:02:04] see and then if they be so i'm trying to
[1:02:08] hurry the whole godhead bodily shaped up
[1:02:10] in the person of jesus christ and then
[1:02:13] when jesus died at the cross i died with
[1:02:16] him yes wait a
[1:02:18] minute how could i have died with him if
[1:02:21] i wasn't there
[1:02:22] but what you fail to see is that you
[1:02:25] were in him
[1:02:27] that's it
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] hallelujah
[1:02:35] my
[1:02:37] and then when jesus died at the cross
[1:02:40] i died with him
[1:02:44] for i was within him then
[1:02:48] is that right the bible said levi who
[1:02:51] was not yet born
[1:02:52] paid tithe in abraham so when abraham
[1:02:56] was paying tithes levi was with him amen
[1:03:01] you understand me i didn't know all my
[1:03:03] children
[1:03:04] they were with me
[1:03:05] i didn't have to wave a wand
[1:03:08] they were in me
[1:03:09] and when my wife and i union
[1:03:12] amen she became the bedding ground and i
[1:03:16] planted the seed but those seeds didn't
[1:03:19] all of a sudden show up they were with
[1:03:21] me even before i was born
[1:03:24] i don't know how god does it
[1:03:27] spiritually he knows where to place
[1:03:29] every seed
[1:03:31] in whatever body
[1:03:34] thank you lord amen
[1:03:36] it is what it is
[1:03:39] listen let me tell y'all something so
[1:03:41] that you understand at the end of the
[1:03:43] day you got to know jesus for yourself
[1:03:47] one thing that i happened before the
[1:03:49] crucifixion was that judas betrayed
[1:03:51] jesus
[1:03:52] don't think you're getting out of here
[1:03:54] and out of this world without betrayal
[1:03:58] somebody will
[1:04:02] what you're gonna do when that happens
[1:04:05] the bible even said their family will be
[1:04:08] against family
[1:04:09] brothers like your sisters and fathers
[1:04:11] against mothers and all of these things
[1:04:14] now what are you going to do
[1:04:16] this is why i keep telling you you got
[1:04:18] to know who you are
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] look beyond all of your faults
[1:04:24] look beyond all of your failures
[1:04:27] because that's not even what god sees
[1:04:30] all god see when he looked at you is
[1:04:32] representation
[1:04:34] he knew you
[1:04:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:40] so when like i always tell people you
[1:04:42] don't know who's sitting next to you
[1:04:44] you need to know who you see who you are
[1:04:46] right
[1:04:48] listen only jesus knew who judas was
[1:04:50] except when jesus told john
[1:04:54] and that's a revelation in itself
[1:04:56] is that right if jesus told john then
[1:04:59] then this jesus that we know will tell
[1:05:02] john again
[1:05:03] the bride will know
[1:05:06] [Laughter]
[1:05:11] like i said i know i got a storm coming
[1:05:13] it's okay
[1:05:14] but you know what i i'm he prepared me
[1:05:19] because i realize
[1:05:20] i have no burdens
[1:05:23] everything that
[1:05:24] would be and would have been a burden
[1:05:26] i'll cast them on him
[1:05:30] so we look at this thing and we know by
[1:05:32] god's grace when jesus died at the cross
[1:05:35] he said i i i died with him for i was
[1:05:38] was in him then for he was the fullness
[1:05:42] of the word manifested knowing that we
[1:05:45] would be manifested what later
[1:05:48] you understand me the bride is something
[1:05:51] or someone christ jesus manifested in
[1:05:54] this day it's not good enough to say i
[1:05:57] go to i belong to the message what's
[1:05:58] that
[1:06:01] no i belong to jesus christ amen
[1:06:04] hallelujah and he is the message today
[1:06:08] living it out of me and through me so it
[1:06:11] is with you
[1:06:12] if you are the message you have the
[1:06:15] revelation of the word of this day and
[1:06:18] is living through you it's not in just
[1:06:20] your head
[1:06:22] it's living through you
[1:06:26] knowing that we would be manifested
[1:06:28] later
[1:06:29] and we was at calvary with him
[1:06:32] we went in the grave with him and we
[1:06:35] raised with him and his resurrection and
[1:06:38] now we're ex
[1:06:40] ascended by his spirit to the throne of
[1:06:43] grace sitting together in heavenly

[1:09:09] a living saints that had raptured there
[1:09:11] was elijah standing there and there was
[1:09:14] moses and there stood moses
[1:09:16] the dead saints represented also both of
[1:09:19] them had quickening power
[1:09:22] whether one died or the other one didn't
[1:09:25] die they're all there
[1:09:28] the thing that they had the commonality
[1:09:30] that they had was that they all had
[1:09:33] quickening power

[1:09:37] they all was in christ and christ was in
[1:09:41] them amen hallelujah elijah had so much
[1:09:44] power on his bone a dead man was raised
[1:09:47] to him
[1:09:48] y'all understand what i'm saying it
[1:09:50] don't leave you and then the devil says
[1:09:52] see god doesn't left you he's a liar
[1:09:55] once you get the holy spirit on the
[1:09:57] inside of you god who said i'll never
[1:09:59] leave you nor will i forsake you the
[1:10:02] problem is you forget who's abiding in
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:07] god abides in you amen
[1:10:09] let me ask you a question when you get
[1:10:12] anybody been in a wreck or close to an
[1:10:13] accident you say jesus
[1:10:16] all of a sudden it literally turned the
[1:10:19] automobile or whatever
[1:10:21] it saves you and then you walk away
[1:10:24] you think you did that the bible said
[1:10:26] you are encompassed about what greater
[1:10:28] clout no uh great cloud of witnesses you
[1:10:31] have angels is that right the bible said
[1:10:34] he has built a wall of fire about you
[1:10:36] you don't need to be afraid it's almost
[1:10:39] an insult to god to fear satan
[1:10:44] huh you three authorities in your mouth
[1:10:48] lord i can't cross over i can't cross
[1:10:50] over yes you can the bible said it's in
[1:10:54] your mouth
[1:10:55] speak it and
[1:11:05] you don't have to beg him what are you
[1:11:06] talking about
[1:11:08] just meditate on it
[1:11:10] talk to him in the temple
[1:11:12] you don't have to tell the devil
[1:11:14] everything
[1:11:15] talk to him in the chamber
[1:11:18] you think god don't hear you
[1:11:20] he heard the pharisees when they called
[1:11:22] him the other bob
[1:11:24] he caught their thoughts then you think
[1:11:26] being a child of god god don't know your
[1:11:29] thoughts shame on you you don't have to
[1:11:31] tell the devil because when you tell the
[1:11:33] devil the greater the fight is going to
[1:11:35] be because now he's got his army
[1:11:38] against you resisting you amen
[1:11:42] you better hear what i'm saying
[1:11:44] learn how to pray right
[1:11:46] like i tell people when i want god to
[1:11:48] hear something i don't want the devil to
[1:11:50] hear i shut my mouth
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:57] and when i shut my mouth i don't have to
[1:11:59] worry about being deceived because he
[1:12:00] didn't hear it
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:05] only god knows the thoughts of the heart
[1:12:08] do you oh come on folks listen god is
[1:12:11] through god don't ever if
[1:12:14] if god can't solve your problems here in
[1:12:16] this dimension how do you figure you're
[1:12:18] going to get about the grave
[1:12:22] going to bring you up out of the grave
[1:12:23] your faith in god
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:31] you think about what the beating jesus
[1:12:34] got
[1:12:35] think about that beating you and i can't
[1:12:37] even fathom it we can't even comprehend
[1:12:39] it
[1:12:40] but but according to history they said
[1:12:42] they had beaten jesus so much
[1:12:45] he didn't even look like a man he was so
[1:12:47] swollen and out of shape
[1:12:51] from the beating and and everything and
[1:12:53] you know the devil you know he had one
[1:12:55] scripture
[1:12:57] thou shall not leave my soul in hell
[1:13:01] neither will you allow my flesh to see
[1:13:03] corruption
[1:13:06] he had that trust in that word
[1:13:10] yes sir amen
[1:13:12] to look what he looked like when he died
[1:13:15] how could anything come up from that
[1:13:18] amen but it was god who quickens
[1:13:22] amen and that's not bad see when he won
[1:13:25] the war over death hell in the grave
[1:13:28] everybody that died believing in him got
[1:13:32] up yes sir
[1:13:33] and like i said the other day we always
[1:13:36] think that don't say that grave was open
[1:13:39] at easter no it was not
[1:13:42] the bible said when he died and gave up
[1:13:45] the ghost
[1:13:47] the graves were open
[1:13:49] so he was open
[1:13:51] that means they got up
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:55] before
[1:13:58] his body was resurrected
[1:14:03] think about it amen they were quickened
[1:14:06] i don't know maybe i think i think about
[1:14:09] ezekiel when
[1:14:10] you know they ask the question can these
[1:14:12] dry bones live
[1:14:13] that army they have been dead for ages
[1:14:16] almost
[1:14:18] and god connected those bones and he
[1:14:20] connected that sinew and he connected
[1:14:22] that flesh and they stood up amen then
[1:14:24] all of a sudden a breath of wind came
[1:14:26] forth and the bible said they walk like
[1:14:29] an army march like an army
[1:14:32] uh uh
[1:14:33] listen they were destroyed or killed in
[1:14:35] the valley i don't know what the whole
[1:14:37] battle was all about but one thing for
[1:14:39] sure they had god and because they had
[1:14:42] god a prophet had the word to resurrect
[1:14:44] them amen
[1:14:49] jesus
[1:14:50] god let a man
[1:14:54] by the name of ezekiel
[1:14:56] speak to those bones
[1:15:01] a man
[1:15:03] y'all think that's powerful when when
[1:15:05] when joshua says son stand still
[1:15:08] but he was a man seeing her only look
[1:15:10] like they've been defeated in the valley
[1:15:13] and god raised them up
[1:15:15] and said the battle is not over yet amen
[1:15:20] you mean to tell me god can't fix it for
[1:15:22] you we used to sing that song let jesus
[1:15:28] fix it for you
[1:15:33] for he knows
[1:15:36] just what to do
[1:15:42] whenever you pray
[1:15:45] just let him have his way
[1:15:49] no matter what the problem is let jesus
[1:15:55] fix it for you
[1:15:58] yeah let jesus fix it
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:02] i always liked that part that last part
[1:16:06] it's real
[1:16:09] it's real
[1:16:13] god is so real
[1:16:16] i often think about how god told my mom
[1:16:18] not only will i be saved but i was
[1:16:20] coming into a greater message
[1:16:23] years after she was gone the reality
[1:16:26] came to me
[1:16:29] amen god god ain't held back by no
[1:16:32] dimensions
[1:16:35] this third dimension don't mean a thing
[1:16:37] to him
[1:16:38] the bible says he's in us
[1:16:40] above us he's with us he's through us
[1:16:44] he's right now here
[1:16:47] the angels of god are here heaven is
[1:16:50] here you set him in heavenly places
[1:16:52] right now in christ jesus
[1:16:55] he said you believe that
[1:16:59] he said we shall rise
[1:17:01] in him we become part of him the easter
[1:17:04] the revealed secret of god like it was
[1:17:08] then
[1:17:09] of life after death
[1:17:12] we are now alive who were once dead in
[1:17:15] sin and
[1:17:16] y'all understand me
[1:17:18] when you were quick into this message
[1:17:20] when god showed you the revelation and
[1:17:22] i'm not talking about your head i mean
[1:17:24] your heart at that time that's when god
[1:17:26] quickened you
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] you have passed from death into life
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:33] thank you lord
[1:17:35] yes
[1:17:36] he said we are now alive who are once
[1:17:39] dead in sin and trespasses the true
[1:17:41] easter seal has broke
[1:17:44] has broke death from around me and i'm
[1:17:47] alive what are you saying what was the
[1:17:49] seal it was thing that shut it up that
[1:17:51] kept it from being said
[1:17:53] and listen people every age had a seal
[1:17:57] what was the seal that sealed the truth
[1:17:59] was was the denomination and the
[1:18:01] organization's creeds and dogmas
[1:18:04] took the word of god put it on a man you
[1:18:06] can't be saved unless you be in this
[1:18:08] church or you be in that church it's all
[1:18:10] a lie there's only one church and that
[1:18:13] church is blood washed by the blood of
[1:18:16] the lamb that church is jesus christ is
[1:18:18] it listen oh i'm in the message oh my
[1:18:20] but it's the message in you
[1:18:22] see that's the point
[1:18:24] being around brother berlin's message
[1:18:26] being around this message does not save
[1:18:28] you that's more like being around moses
[1:18:31] did it save him
[1:18:32] no the revelation that quickened joshua
[1:18:34] and caleb
[1:18:37] that's the saving grace when you know
[1:18:40] you who you are and you stop trembling
[1:18:43] at the devil's voice
[1:18:46] you you you trembling
[1:18:50] you know and we can read we read it we
[1:18:51] read it read it read it we read it right
[1:18:53] there oh moses
[1:18:57] why christ speak we hear it
[1:18:59] but when it comes our turn
[1:19:03] we're like israel that ran away from
[1:19:05] goliath
[1:19:06] there must be davis here somewhere
[1:19:09] if you just got one revelation jesus
[1:19:12] christ it's the same yesterday and
[1:19:14] forever hallelujah one revelation god
[1:19:17] cannot lie
[1:19:19] one revelation whatever god says must
[1:19:22] come to pass
[1:19:23] hold fast to that you don't have to do
[1:19:26] nothing but wait
[1:19:29] you know when moses held that rod which
[1:19:31] was a representation of the word he
[1:19:32] didn't say waters back up back up back
[1:19:35] up no it was a word now fulfilling what
[1:19:39] god had already in his mind to do but he
[1:19:42] used moses to do it so is it with you
[1:19:45] every trial come to be everything satan
[1:19:48] comes and brings your way god has
[1:19:49] brought it to you for you to defeat it
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:52] god ain't got no cowards
[1:19:54] no cowards
[1:19:56] hallelujah oh and then when it gets
[1:19:58] rough oh my god we act like peter lord
[1:20:01] carried out not that we perish
[1:20:05] god's hell ye of a little faith
[1:20:07] where did you doubt
[1:20:09] i have fed you have clothed you i put
[1:20:11] shout over your house i've done
[1:20:12] everything i've given you help i've
[1:20:14] healed you i've kept you from being sick
[1:20:16] whatever the case may be i've been there
[1:20:18] for you where do you doubt him now
[1:20:24] what devil
[1:20:26] in hell can defeat jesus christ when
[1:20:29] jesus himself has defeated the death
[1:20:30] hell and the grave amen you just gotta
[1:20:33] wait on him
[1:20:36] like the brother branham said let go and
[1:20:38] let god
[1:20:40] yeah that's what's been defeated me in
[1:20:42] the past
[1:20:43] i love my children so much thinking i've
[1:20:45] given them up thinking i've given them
[1:20:47] up
[1:20:48] and then god gave me grace to give them
[1:20:49] up
[1:20:50] that don't mean i don't love them
[1:20:52] i love them i pray for them but i've
[1:20:55] come to recognize i cannot save them
[1:20:59] the word of god is the only thing that
[1:21:01] can save them
[1:21:03] but god gave me a promise you understand
[1:21:06] me and i stand on that promise that he's
[1:21:09] going to save all of them i don't know
[1:21:11] how he's going to do it it's not my
[1:21:13] business
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:17] my business
[1:21:18] he is just that he promised it amen
[1:21:22] so why should i worry and fret and oh
[1:21:25] lord you know what i'm saying
[1:21:28] we've got to give it up we got to
[1:21:30] release all that you know it caused you
[1:21:32] to get bald it caused you to get gray it
[1:21:35] caused you to wrinkles it caused your
[1:21:36] heart attacks it caused you what what
[1:21:39] what
[1:21:41] arthritis and all those things come by
[1:21:44] worry and stress
[1:21:46] amen and being faithless
[1:21:52] now ask i gotta ask you a question you
[1:21:55] know god tried you've got to try god as
[1:21:57] word the bible says no evil shall come
[1:21:59] nigh thy dwelling place
[1:22:02] and then when it comes we never think
[1:22:04] about that
[1:22:06] we we need to we need to think about it
[1:22:09] because if no evil comes you know
[1:22:11] he's going to come now your dwelling
[1:22:13] blades that means
[1:22:16] you know i heard something brother
[1:22:17] branham said the other day and i was
[1:22:18] just in god proving his word he says
[1:22:22] when when people get sick doesn't
[1:22:24] necessarily mean it was the devil
[1:22:27] he said god allow things to happen to
[1:22:29] draw you closer to him
[1:22:32] so let me put it this plainly
[1:22:34] usually when things
[1:22:37] happens in the house happens in your
[1:22:39] life personally
[1:22:40] and you don't know that god allows it to
[1:22:43] happen to bring you closer
[1:22:46] that's what it's all about this is
[1:22:48] rapture time this is translation time
[1:22:52] and god is bringing us closer however
[1:22:55] whenever however he choose to do it it's
[1:22:57] fine with me i don't care
[1:23:00] i'm just like yes sir
[1:23:04] job says though he slayed me
[1:23:08] i'll trust him
[1:23:11] do you think the devil is behind this no
[1:23:14] god is behind it the bible said he's the
[1:23:16] author and finisher of our faith
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:22] what do you think moses felt when he saw
[1:23:24] pharaoh coming at him
[1:23:26] but lord you told me you you know i'm
[1:23:28] going to deliver them and look like
[1:23:30] we're going to all die he probably
[1:23:32] wasn't the only one thought like moses
[1:23:35] have you brought us out here to die
[1:23:39] something affected him where he cried
[1:23:40] out
[1:23:43] and god said
[1:23:45] in my return shut up
[1:23:48] why christ speak
[1:23:52] we we as human beings we're so we do it
[1:23:55] we do it we just do it and the disciples
[1:23:58] did the same thing
[1:23:59] just after the revival
[1:24:01] jesus walking on the water
[1:24:03] they see him coming
[1:24:05] and they're afraid of him
[1:24:09] and today is the same day
[1:24:11] people are afraid of the holy ghost
[1:24:14] this is the time where the waters are
[1:24:15] just choppy and the storm is going crazy
[1:24:19] and now the holy ghost is trying to come
[1:24:21] and you know what i'm saying trying to
[1:24:23] see make you see who he is and and you
[1:24:25] know oh it's a ghost you know they're
[1:24:27] looking at listen that's what's
[1:24:28] happening in this message people are
[1:24:31] afraid of the holy ghost you know why
[1:24:33] because we want to control god
[1:24:36] you'll never control him
[1:24:39] you can't control god god controls you
[1:24:46] let go and let god be trust them folks
[1:24:49] that's what the vibes are trusted i love
[1:24:50] that scripture trust the lord with all
[1:24:52] your heart and lean out to your own
[1:24:53] understanding now i know i'm going much
[1:24:55] longer than i thought i would go almost
[1:24:57] an hour already but that's okay
[1:24:59] let let
[1:25:00] listen what brother bradley it's his own
[1:25:02] experience in it's it's the rising of
[1:25:04] the sun he says oh aren't you glad
[1:25:07] i'm so glad way back down yonder in a
[1:25:12] little
[1:25:13] old cold shed one morning the seals were
[1:25:18] broken
[1:25:20] and i raised
[1:25:22] i raised with him
[1:25:25] a new creature
[1:25:26] his quickening power
[1:25:29] he said the sun is up
[1:25:32] now you understand what he's saying he
[1:25:33] said the day
[1:25:35] that i god broke the seals in my life
[1:25:38] he broke the seals
[1:25:40] amen
[1:25:42] i began to see who he is the revelation
[1:25:45] of christ filled my heart
[1:25:47] he said that's when i was resurrected
[1:25:52] listen people oh you was resurrected yes
[1:25:54] i'm resurrected if i wasn't then how
[1:25:56] could i be in heavenly places
[1:25:59] it ain't the ending of it it's the
[1:26:00] beginning of it amen
[1:26:03] glory amen but you've got to be
[1:26:05] resurrected here
[1:26:07] life must come here first
[1:26:10] before this could ever change
[1:26:14] that's right
[1:26:15] we say oh i'm in the rapture do you
[1:26:17] really believe that if you are in the
[1:26:18] rapture that means you got the holy
[1:26:20] ghost
[1:26:21] because jesus said i am the resurrection
[1:26:23] and now my life
[1:26:24] and if that's in you you're already
[1:26:26] there there's no backing up amen
[1:26:31] it's the truth people i preach you the
[1:26:33] truth tonight
[1:26:36] the things what we need to do is stop
[1:26:38] listening we just remember i told you
[1:26:40] earlier it's your traditions it's what
[1:26:42] you've been taught it's deception
[1:26:46] if you don't see that this message has
[1:26:48] brought you a different word a different
[1:26:50] place in christ you're not in the
[1:26:52] organization you're not in denomination
[1:26:54] you're not in laodicea we're then where
[1:26:57] are you
[1:26:58] hallelujah
[1:26:59] amen you're in
[1:27:02] yes christ where is christ
[1:27:06] he's in you amen oh come on brother he
[1:27:09] said in that day you'll know i'm in the
[1:27:12] father the father's in me and i am in
[1:27:14] you that day what day this day that is
[1:27:17] the revelation of the hour that christ
[1:27:20] is now living in the bride and he's now
[1:27:24] manifesting himself in the bride form
[1:27:27] that's the revelation
[1:27:29] hallelujah
[1:27:32] glory to god
[1:27:35] that's why our father prayer and i'm
[1:27:37] almost done
[1:27:38] tying this in but that's why our father
[1:27:40] prayer was so important
[1:27:42] but you know what we did we did just
[1:27:44] like matthew 28 19. go you therefore
[1:27:46] baptizing everyone in the name of the
[1:27:48] father son and holy ghost and we
[1:27:49] repeated that for hundreds of years
[1:27:52] since nia council thinking that was what
[1:27:54] god said
[1:27:56] tell him what he said
[1:27:58] he said it but that ain't what he meant
[1:28:00] that was not the revelation behind
[1:28:02] matthew 28 19. the revelation behind
[1:28:05] matthew 28 19 was acts 2 38.
[1:28:10] you thought well i'm gonna believe what
[1:28:12] the disciples what jesus said over the
[1:28:14] disciples that means you're just as
[1:28:16] blind as a bat you don't have no idea
[1:28:18] who god is and you don't have no idea
[1:28:21] who those disciples were
[1:28:23] when people say i ain't gonna believe
[1:28:24] paul paul was a woman hater i'm yes and
[1:28:27] you don't believe paul the bible said if
[1:28:30] you don't believe him you're lost
[1:28:33] amen paul said except for man preached
[1:28:36] the same doctrine i preached let him be
[1:28:39] a curse
[1:28:40] it don't matter what you believe
[1:28:42] because the point is it doesn't stop the
[1:28:44] program of god
[1:28:46] you're going to have the believers the
[1:28:47] make-believers and the unbelievers those
[1:28:49] three is going to always be
[1:28:53] all right i tell you what it's so
[1:28:55] amazing
[1:28:57] and listen
[1:28:59] like i said when he began to pray and he
[1:29:01] came to pass that as he was praying in a
[1:29:03] certain place listen
[1:29:05] where in the scripture in the book of
[1:29:07] genesis well where where where where
[1:29:10] adam and eve had to pray
[1:29:14] is it there
[1:29:16] why would they pray
[1:29:18] prayer is communion
[1:29:19] prayer is talking to god
[1:29:22] they always talk to him god always talk
[1:29:24] to him
[1:29:26] hallelujah the altar came after the fall
[1:29:31] now if god has restored everything back
[1:29:33] where do you think we're going
[1:29:36] all the time amen god want to be in you
[1:29:39] all the time
[1:29:40] not just here in the building or
[1:29:42] you know it's amazing because god don't
[1:29:44] want to be an extracurricular activity
[1:29:47] god wants you all of you
[1:29:50] your mind your body your soul your
[1:29:52] spirit
[1:29:53] everything
[1:29:55] is even so on my show he said if you're
[1:29:58] a dishwasher if god called you to be a
[1:30:00] dishwasher be holy that's right whatever
[1:30:03] he's called you to do you can be a
[1:30:04] garbage man whatever but god can still
[1:30:07] use you
[1:30:15] you say no i don't believe that and you
[1:30:17] just like i corrected uh i won't say i
[1:30:20] just
[1:30:22] said it in the right way
[1:30:23] don't never say what you don't believe
[1:30:26] just say you don't understand it
[1:30:29] because when you say i don't believe you
[1:30:31] cutting off your grace what if it's true
[1:30:34] the thing you say you don't believe
[1:30:39] what you say but that ain't that can't
[1:30:41] happen yeah
[1:30:43] those those pharisees was was taught a
[1:30:46] certain way
[1:30:47] and because of their teaching they were
[1:30:49] blind it wasn't that god blinded them
[1:30:53] but it was the pharisees it was the
[1:30:54] doctrines of divinity it was their
[1:30:55] tradition he said yo your traditions and
[1:30:58] all of these things they're the things
[1:31:00] that blind you well my mama was this my
[1:31:02] daddy was this and this is the way
[1:31:03] listen god requires more from you
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:09] let's go to always god the bible will
[1:31:12] never leave himself without a witness he
[1:31:16] won't do it
[1:31:17] i'm almost done folks and it came to
[1:31:20] pass that as he was praying a certain
[1:31:22] place when he ceased one of his
[1:31:24] disciples said unto him lord teach us to
[1:31:26] pray as john also taught his disciples
[1:31:29] and don't get me wrong
[1:31:31] i'm not trying to tell you to make your
[1:31:32] prayer a traditional prayer sometimes
[1:31:35] you might cry sometimes you might scream
[1:31:38] sometimes you may holler sometimes you
[1:31:40] might be quiet however you're being led
[1:31:42] by the holy spirit hello
[1:31:46] amen that's how you pray
[1:31:49] how god leads you to pray
[1:31:52] amen but don't pray like he's way off in
[1:31:54] heaven somewhere
[1:31:58] you're denying the scripture when you do
[1:31:59] that
[1:32:03] the bible even says he's not a far off
[1:32:05] he's 90 where even in your mouth and if
[1:32:08] he's in your mouth that means he's in
[1:32:10] your heart amen
[1:32:12] amen
[1:32:14] are you not the tabernacle the bible
[1:32:16] says know ye not that you are the temple
[1:32:18] of god
[1:32:22] you are the holy place
[1:32:25] and if there be any holy ground you are
[1:32:27] the holy ground because the holy ghost
[1:32:29] is on your ground or in your ground
[1:32:31] however you want to put it and he said
[1:32:33] to them when you pray say our father
[1:32:35] which are in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:32:38] and this is where people say well you
[1:32:39] might as well you rise well you could
[1:32:40] well there's a trinity now he said ah
[1:32:43] where the father is the creator
[1:32:46] jesus the body was created
[1:32:50] anybody know that the bible said i have
[1:32:52] prepared myself a body who is the body
[1:32:56] jesus that's what made him a son there's
[1:32:58] no such thing as eternal son because son
[1:33:01] has a beginning this part amen that we
[1:33:04] call son has a beginning but the part
[1:33:07] that we call father is in us that has no
[1:33:10] beginning
[1:33:12] that's eternal that's who oh my god
[1:33:15] people amen
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] and when you pray say our father what
[1:33:20] was he saying i want you to understand
[1:33:23] you're praying to the creator
[1:33:25] hello
[1:33:26] that's why jesus didn't leave no idols
[1:33:29] that's right when you pray
[1:33:31] look at this and that's what they did
[1:33:34] even even israel made jerusalem an idol
[1:33:38] that's why they died
[1:33:40] that's why when titus came in
[1:33:42] in 80 70 they thought they thought for
[1:33:45] sure jerusalem was going to save them
[1:33:48] there was no power in that city
[1:33:51] jesus had already told him when he was
[1:33:53] on here he said listen i'm going to tear
[1:33:55] this down
[1:33:56] why they couldn't see it i don't know
[1:33:59] but let me say it like this
[1:34:02] that's why jesus was able to go into
[1:34:04] solomon temple and whip them out
[1:34:07] and guess what he said
[1:34:09] you din of thieves and robbers
[1:34:12] right
[1:34:13] he said he goes on his head don't you
[1:34:16] know
[1:34:17] listen
[1:34:18] my house
[1:34:21] shall be called the house of prayer
[1:34:25] he wasn't talking about solomon temple
[1:34:28] he was talking about his creation
[1:34:30] his house where he would abide
[1:34:33] his habitation will be called the house
[1:34:36] of prayer
[1:34:38] you say oh brother that has nothing to
[1:34:40] do with me yes
[1:34:42] brother branham said it like this when
[1:34:43] those foolish virgins came to ask the
[1:34:45] wise version give us of your all the
[1:34:47] wise versions say you go pray up
[1:34:49] that's what makes the difference
[1:34:52] the wise virgin has become the house of
[1:34:55] prayer
[1:34:57] praying without ceasing i never could
[1:35:00] understand that honestly for a long time
[1:35:02] pray without ceasing not understanding
[1:35:04] that your prayers should be on your
[1:35:06] heart well i don't ran out of things to
[1:35:08] pray when you have not you don't know
[1:35:09] what prayer is because there's too many
[1:35:11] things to pray for you'll never run out
[1:35:14] ever
[1:35:15] you're selfish that's when you pray and
[1:35:17] you don't ran out cause all you praying
[1:35:19] about is yourself
[1:35:22] god help this god help me there god do
[1:35:25] this for me and you want god to be your
[1:35:27] servant
[1:35:29] but he's jehovah jireh
[1:35:33] that's all we know him some of us that's
[1:35:35] all we know of him he will supply our
[1:35:38] knees
[1:35:39] what about his needs
[1:35:42] what about his need you think god
[1:35:44] doesn't have needs
[1:35:46] let me say it like as he did he does
[1:35:49] because jesus said i have need to go by
[1:35:51] samaria
[1:35:53] the converting of souls
[1:35:57] that's his needs and he puts us out here
[1:36:00] so that we can help what
[1:36:02] bring his needs to pass
[1:36:06] let me move on forgive us of our sins
[1:36:08] and i'm almost done
[1:36:10] because you see
[1:36:11] the blood is on the altar
[1:36:13] you say well what do you mean the
[1:36:14] prophet god said the bride of jesus
[1:36:16] christ is the blood of jesus christ by
[1:36:18] the spirit and so the holy ghost is here
[1:36:21] yes
[1:36:22] that's where you become a priest
[1:36:24] and this is where you become a king amen
[1:36:27] hallelujah a king rules
[1:36:30] and a priest omits sins or remit sins
[1:36:33] you know what i'm saying you say what do
[1:36:35] you mean this is what acts 2 38 is
[1:36:38] whatsoever you bound there to be bound
[1:36:41] whatsoever you remit it'll be remitted
[1:36:45] that's really a deep subject
[1:36:49] but you and i must understand that
[1:36:50] listen
[1:36:52] and i'm gonna close because there's no
[1:36:53] way i can finish this but let me say it
[1:36:55] like this
[1:36:57] when it comes to god
[1:37:02] i looked at the prophet of god and he
[1:37:04] constantly was saying i'm no prophet i'm
[1:37:07] no prophet
[1:37:08] and there are times he said you believe
[1:37:10] god's prophet
[1:37:12] but then people thought well he said it
[1:37:14] no that was god's spirit saying it
[1:37:15] through him
[1:37:18] and what we fail to see is that that's
[1:37:20] the way god we want to be so connected
[1:37:22] like that
[1:37:24] because many times brother branham had
[1:37:25] to go back home and listen to the tapes
[1:37:27] because he could remember what was being
[1:37:29] said or what had been said
[1:37:33] but we want to be that connected amen
[1:37:35] you say what do you mean even the bride
[1:37:37] of jesus christ lord when did we visit
[1:37:39] with the prison when did we give you
[1:37:41] clothing when did we feed you they were
[1:37:43] so connected to god they never thought
[1:37:45] about it
[1:37:47] amen but the moment you start thinking
[1:37:49] about it well if i do this i'm gonna get
[1:37:51] that
[1:37:51] that's your reward
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:59] can i read one more scripture and i'm
[1:38:01] gonna have to close this acts 17 27-30
[1:38:04] says that they should seek the lord if
[1:38:07] haply they might feel after him and find
[1:38:11] what him
[1:38:13] though it be not far from every one of
[1:38:17] us find him where is he in heaven where
[1:38:20] is he
[1:38:21] or where is god amen
[1:38:24] he's in you
[1:38:25] happily if you should find him for in
[1:38:29] him
[1:38:31] we live and move and have our beings as
[1:38:35] certain also of your own prophets have
[1:38:37] said for we are his offspring that's the
[1:38:41] word
[1:38:44] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:38:46] of god we ought not to think that the
[1:38:50] godhead is likened to gold or silver or
[1:38:52] stone or graven by the odds of man
[1:38:54] devices what is he saying stay away from
[1:38:57] idolatry
[1:38:58] don't form no kind of image of me
[1:39:01] you have become my image
[1:39:04] is that right divine nature
[1:39:07] right coming into the very image and
[1:39:09] likeness of god
[1:39:11] by his power by his strength
[1:39:14] he is the creator he's the one building
[1:39:17] the house and not we
[1:39:19] no no no no god in you the hope of glory
[1:39:23] the one beautiful thing and i love that
[1:39:25] god doesn't leave nothing incomplete
[1:39:29] nothing
[1:39:31] incomplete
[1:39:33] for as much then as we are the offspring
[1:39:35] of god will not see and that's what
[1:39:37] people say oh i'm wearing me a cross
[1:39:40] i got a picture of brother branham
[1:39:43] now i'm wearing me
[1:39:44] buckle belt a butt what's called a belka
[1:39:47] buckle on my belt
[1:39:50] that's nothing
[1:39:54] do y'all you know so y'all heard me say
[1:39:57] this before sometimes we put too much
[1:39:59] emphasis like a friend of mine and i'm
[1:40:00] going closer a friend of mine
[1:40:04] he bet this hindu and he began to
[1:40:07] witness to this hindu
[1:40:10] and his hindu at like okay you know
[1:40:12] because i guess the hindu wanted some
[1:40:14] money so he said the hindu was like okay
[1:40:17] uh uh uh
[1:40:18] you know he told me about you ever heard
[1:40:20] of william branham he said yeah yeah
[1:40:22] yeah yeah i heard we say y'all just like
[1:40:24] the hindus y'all worship eagles
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:32] oh
[1:40:34] yeah i mentioned this down and i was
[1:40:37] saying and one of the brothers like
[1:40:40] he said because in front of the church
[1:40:42] he said they got this great
[1:40:47] [Laughter]
[1:40:50] once you see that everybody that's a
[1:40:52] call
[1:40:55] right
[1:40:56] listen you're gonna have all these
[1:40:57] pictures hanging up in the and people
[1:40:58] are coming like where's jesus in
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:03] want to see this
[1:41:05] amen and how they're going to see him
[1:41:07] except they see him through you
[1:41:10] the atmosphere must speak jesus
[1:41:13] the worship must speak jesus everything
[1:41:17] that we do must be jesus isn't some
[1:41:20] image out there
[1:41:23] we are the temple of god
[1:41:26] they didn't understand jesus but they
[1:41:28] they had no idea that godhead was in him
[1:41:33] god had come down the earth
[1:41:35] indwelling a human man and jesus was not
[1:41:38] only the godhead but he was the mercy
[1:41:41] seat
[1:41:45] that's why he could he wasn't even dead
[1:41:47] yet
[1:41:48] but he was steady handing out mercy
[1:41:50] standing deadly handing out grace
[1:41:53] and only a few people caught it
[1:41:56] i don't know what the woman with the
[1:41:57] issue of blood had done but she said bro
[1:41:59] if i could just touch
[1:42:01] the human's garment i know i'll be made
[1:42:04] whole
[1:42:05] oh
[1:42:06] blind by the mayor's what would you want
[1:42:08] what are your needs
[1:42:10] you got to understand he was breaking
[1:42:11] every
[1:42:12] tradition you couldn't be healed in
[1:42:15] those days except you went to the priest
[1:42:17] and you had to bring your lamb and you
[1:42:19] had to bring your goat and you had to
[1:42:21] bring your dove but he was the true lamb
[1:42:23] of god breaking all traditions of the
[1:42:26] laws that's why they hated him how could
[1:42:30] this thing be
[1:42:31] amen they hated him so much they called
[1:42:34] him a devil
[1:42:35] and said you do these things by the by
[1:42:37] by the hand of bears above he said if i
[1:42:39] do these things by by the hand of a
[1:42:42] bears above then how are your priests
[1:42:44] bringing healing
[1:42:46] because they did there were those who
[1:42:48] really believe in their offerings and by
[1:42:50] those offerings they were healed
[1:42:52] god honored those laws
[1:42:54] was that bells above no it was god
[1:42:57] but they could not believe and that's
[1:42:59] what's wrong with folks now they cannot
[1:43:01] believe that god would come down and
[1:43:03] live in men
[1:43:06] amen and i'm not talking about jesus
[1:43:08] himself now i'm talking about you
[1:43:11] even even even among us we can believe
[1:43:13] that jesus died on the cross jesus rose
[1:43:16] again jesus was in william branham but
[1:43:18] we have a hard time believing that jesus
[1:43:20] is in us
[1:43:22] oh if the prophet was here then what
[1:43:26] tell me what could he do
[1:43:28] he couldn't do nothing he said if i
[1:43:30] could heal you i would but i have to
[1:43:33] wait on him
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:36] amen what is that he's tried to tell us
[1:43:40] he had no power of his own the power
[1:43:42] which he had was from god
[1:43:45] people of god don't you see
[1:43:48] where your position
[1:43:50] enclosing like i said
[1:43:53] until you see
[1:43:57] when elijah leaves
[1:44:01] till you see that elijah is gone
[1:44:04] until you see that
[1:44:06] you will never be able to take your
[1:44:09] position
[1:44:10] because as long as you don't see that
[1:44:13] the mantle cannot drop on you
[1:44:16] that double portion will never fall on
[1:44:18] you
[1:44:19] until you catch the revelation of your
[1:44:22] day in your position in christ this is
[1:44:24] the day of the bride this is the day of
[1:44:26] elisha
[1:44:28] we're not taken away from elijah but
[1:44:30] elijah has already fulfilled his
[1:44:32] position
[1:44:33] we the bride of jesus christ must
[1:44:35] reflect jesus christ for our day
[1:44:39] hallelujah glory to god
[1:44:44] and once we see that god want to use us
[1:44:48] in a different way more powerful way
[1:44:52] we'll still be looking back like unclean
[1:44:54] frogs
[1:44:57] we'll be praying on our knees wishing
[1:44:59] that elijah could come and talk to you
[1:45:01] and discern your heart
[1:45:03] elijah ain't never discerned a heart
[1:45:06] it was jesus christ
[1:45:08] who did all that discerning
[1:45:12] but what what what did people do they
[1:45:14] made an idol out of him yes amen
[1:45:18] that's why they weren't getting nothing
[1:45:20] huh and until you recognize who jesus is
[1:45:23] brother adam said like this he said one
[1:45:25] day they're coming a day they're gonna
[1:45:26] call on the name of jesus and won't get
[1:45:28] nothing
[1:45:29] you know why
[1:45:30] the protocol
[1:45:32] you don't even know who he is
[1:45:36] right
[1:45:37] remember the woman says oh thou son of
[1:45:39] david thou son of david he said yeah he
[1:45:41] was the son of david to the jews but not
[1:45:42] her but then when she said lord
[1:45:46] and you see how people are calling on
[1:45:48] jesus like a denominational jesus you
[1:45:50] ain't getting nothing
[1:45:52] when you recognize that jesus christ
[1:45:54] that have come in this day
[1:45:55] and appeared to us
[1:45:57] to bring us to a change a change of our
[1:45:59] body this message has come to change you
[1:46:04] from glory to glory this y'all
[1:46:06] understand me this message is a message
[1:46:08] that will rapture you amen it's what god
[1:46:11] will come back for
[1:46:14] people who have lived it believed it
[1:46:17] engulfed it
[1:46:19] so much so it brings about a change
[1:46:23] people say well uh
[1:46:24] it's eager to come back physically i
[1:46:25] don't know how he's coming in that way
[1:46:27] he's come
[1:46:29] but how he however we see it we'll see
[1:46:32] him amen you understand what i'm saying
[1:46:34] every i that ain't the time every eye
[1:46:36] going to see him
[1:46:38] did y'all know that the rapture is not
[1:46:41] the time every eye is going to see i
[1:46:43] know what hollywood has done but if that
[1:46:45] be the case then when was it how can it
[1:46:47] be a secret
[1:46:50] when jesus raised from the dead
[1:46:54] his disciples stood there and saw his
[1:46:56] ascension did everybody see it
[1:47:00] so much so he was he was lifted up into
[1:47:02] a cloud
[1:47:04] y'all understand what i'm saying the
[1:47:06] same kind of cloud that came the same
[1:47:08] took him up in the same kind of cloud
[1:47:10] that brought him back amen
[1:47:12] and people don't want to don't want to
[1:47:14] acknowledge that but it is the truth of
[1:47:16] the matter is he didn't come the way you
[1:47:18] thought he was going to come and he's a
[1:47:20] thief
[1:47:21] he's stealing away the hearts of the
[1:47:23] people and they're changing
[1:47:25] amen
[1:47:26] they're changing
[1:47:28] and after a while
[1:47:30] what what
[1:47:31] am i wrong what is the invisible union
[1:47:34] of the bride
[1:47:35] what is it when will it happen
[1:47:38] when she
[1:47:39] will transform from bride to wife
[1:47:43] when
[1:47:45] you better understand it
[1:47:47] it's a revelation

[1:48:02] but i can tell you right now he's
[1:48:04] changing me
