[0:03] [Music]
[0:10] take my head ball
[0:20] take my hand
[0:30] [Music]
[0:39] Oh No are you a man we're gonna get
[0:49] right on into the Word of God we thank
[0:51] your brothers
[0:54] hallelujah I think the last time they
[0:58] were coming I made a missed call I said
[1:00] we were snowed out of church and then
[1:03] the weather cleared up
[1:04] oh my goodness what have I done
[1:08] sometimes it's really hard to know what
[1:11] AIA weather I think I got it all must be
[1:15] oh it's on there sorry I thought I had
[1:20] it on sorry about that nobody but God is
[1:23] good to us and we surely appreciate the
[1:28] Lord and our brothers coming we're
[1:33] trying to finish up this message that we
[1:35] started on this morning for those who
[1:38] were not here we worked on the
[1:39] resurrection but revival and how this
[1:43] message came to us to revive us and to
[1:47] produce the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:50] when we think about where we are
[1:54] time is short and we we know by God's
[1:59] grace because brother Branham has been
[2:01] gone about 50 years I think and it was
[2:06] late in his hour and now it's later and
[2:12] we're closer to the coming of the Lord
[2:14] but we find out and in this time that
[2:20] people are now losing sight instead of
[2:24] pressing forward they getting dim in
[2:26] their eyes you know like an eagle who
[2:29] needs to be revived a whole friend of
[2:32] mine had a dream years ago and she told
[2:35] us that she was dreaming and just prior
[2:38] to the coming of the Lord the young
[2:40] people went crazy
[2:42] seemed like they began to do things that
[2:44] they weren't supposed to do her name was
[2:46] Carol sister Carol Williams and she said
[2:50] that it was at that time that the Lord
[2:53] did come and I've been watching I've
[2:56] been watching and that's where the enemy
[2:59] is really hitting striking younger
[3:01] people you know getting them to
[3:03] disbelieve this message and seem like
[3:06] when they go away they go wow you know
[3:10] that's why we need to always pray for
[3:12] our young people I thank God for our
[3:15] brothers coming up pressing it means so
[3:17] much to me to see you all and I tell you
[3:21] where we can we could do some damage to
[3:23] Iowa I told him I said we're gonna get
[3:27] down there and we're gonna do some
[3:29] witnessin and we're gonna come up here
[3:30] and do some witnessing but I was
[3:34] thinking even while they were praying I
[3:35] said we got this anniversary coming up
[3:37] we need to get us a little choir
[3:38] together I'm not a director it's been a
[3:42] long time I'm a little rusty but I can
[3:44] do it
[3:45] but nevertheless amen we need to gather
[3:47] together and really show the devil we
[3:49] mean business I don't believe a man in
[3:52] losing a battle I remember the time I
[3:55] was jumped when I was a little boy about
[3:57] three guys jumped me and of course it
[3:59] was my first time ever fighting you know
[4:01] outside of my brother and sister but
[4:03] anyway it was a real traumatic period in
[4:06] time for me at that time and nonetheless
[4:08] I did not win but what I didn't do my
[4:12] brother did even so I look at that and
[4:16] that's a lesson to me and what I can't
[4:18] do Jesus can't so I look at that and I'm
[4:22] thinking Amen how God is trying to get
[4:25] us to see even as brother Branham said
[4:28] God Jesus never preached a funeral
[4:30] session every time he came across a dead
[4:33] man he he the man was resurrected I
[4:37] think about the man I read read about
[4:39] this morning who never I supposedly
[4:41] didn't know Jesus but all throughout God
[4:44] stopped his funeral procession and told
[4:47] him to get up my what grace is that
[4:50] already dead and God raised him up but
[4:54] you know you look at these things and
[4:55] and I was saying by God's grace how that
[4:58] we need to refocus you know things that
[5:02] we find people doing and you know
[5:05] attitudes and as I
[5:07] saying we're now should be focusing on
[5:10] our mind and our thoughts on perfection
[5:13] I mean coming and growing on into the
[5:15] into the character of Christ and you
[5:19] know in all that we do understand that
[5:22] you're not battle free mm-hmm right amen
[5:27] brother man say you don't even know
[5:29] you've been in a battle until you get
[5:30] the Holy Ghost right Amen that's all
[5:34] they did in the Promised Land it was
[5:36] more than grapes there you know they had
[5:39] battles that was already how can I say
[5:43] it
[5:44] prescribed for them battles that was
[5:47] already cut out for them and God
[5:50] expected them to win every battle
[5:52] so is it with us now and I'm preaching
[5:55] an ending read the scripture I'm like
[5:58] why are you still standing but anyway
[6:00] let's go to the scripture hallelujah so
[6:05] you and I must understand and we're
[6:07] gonna start with Psalms 139 23 to 24 it
[6:11] says search me O God and know my heart
[6:20] try me and know my thoughts arms 139 23
[6:24] to 24 and see if there be any wicked way
[6:27] in me and lead me in the way everlasting
[6:34] almost gripped you'll want to read
[6:40] Philippians 3:13 and 14 and I'm not
[6:45] going to be a very long tonight I don't
[6:52] know how much time the brothers got on
[6:54] hand but we like to take the guys out to
[6:56] eat it that's all possible okay
[7:01] Philippians 3:13
[7:03] and 14 says brethren I count not myself
[7:06] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[7:10] do forgetting those things which are
[7:12] behind reaching forth unto those things
[7:16] which are before I press toward the mark
[7:20] for the
[7:21] rise of a high calling of God in Christ
[7:26] and my subject this morning was the
[7:30] resurrection revival let us pray Lord we
[7:34] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[7:35] we thank you for your goodness and
[7:37] everything you have done for us we thank
[7:40] you for what you're doing for us father
[7:42] you know how to keep us encouraged and
[7:45] father we're so thankful that you have
[7:48] been such a God that there is no other
[7:51] god like it unto thee everything else
[7:54] has become falsehood to us and therefore
[7:56] we focus on you and focus on your word O
[7:59] God that we may be pleasing in that side
[8:02] at the end of the day Lord we want to
[8:05] hear you say well done my good and
[8:08] faithful servant enter into the joys of
[8:11] the Lord bless each and every heart and
[8:14] this morning or this night keep us in
[8:16] your care as we fellowship with you in
[8:19] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[8:22] you may be seated we read the scripture
[8:26] this morning on Luke 7 12 through 13 and
[8:28] on I'll read it again now when he came
[8:31] nigh to the gate of the city oh there
[8:34] was a man carried out he owned the only
[8:38] son of his mother and she was a widow
[8:41] and much people of the city was with her
[8:45] and when the Lord saw her he had
[8:48] compassion on her and said unto her weep
[8:51] not and he came and they touched the bra
[8:54] buyer and they that bared him spit still
[8:57] and he said young man I say unto thee
[9:01] arise and he that was dead set up and
[9:05] began to speak and he delivered him into
[9:10] his mouth in to his mother and there
[9:12] came a fear on all and they glorified
[9:15] God saying that a great prophet is risen
[9:19] among up among us and that God had
[9:22] visited his people and this room of him
[9:26] went forth throughout all Judea and
[9:29] throughout all the region around about
[9:31] and I was saying on this morning this is
[9:35] the kind of response
[9:36] it's that we want and need from the Lord
[9:38] because you and I once was dead and now
[9:42] we are alive and you and I must
[9:45] understand amen this was not just a
[9:48] rumor it was factual that this man had
[9:52] been raised from the dead and whenever
[9:55] God does anything hallelujah it should
[9:59] cause a revival or it should electrify
[10:02] the people so much so they couldn't help
[10:05] but tell what went on is that all right
[10:07] and so I went on by God's grace and I
[10:11] began to show in the scripture what God
[10:16] was doing and the Bible tells us that
[10:19] even John when he was on earth how he
[10:22] before dying you know he was in prison
[10:24] now and now he see himself facing a the
[10:30] beheading of himself and he sent his
[10:32] disciples during the same time to Jesus
[10:35] and said ask Jesus he if he's the one or
[10:38] should we look for another and you see
[10:40] we find out that even in this message
[10:42] that's what has happened people have
[10:45] followed John and-and-and and now they I
[10:47] call it John's complex amen not that
[10:50] John wasn't a man but John had moved off
[10:53] the scene and now Jesus was on the scene
[10:56] and now John who was the very one who
[10:59] identified the Christ right he
[11:02] identified the Christ and now brother
[11:05] Branham says now he's in a position he's
[11:08] wondering is this the one right so Jesus
[11:12] did not send back and says oh I'll tell
[11:15] John I'm the one but he said I want you
[11:18] to tell John everything that you've seen
[11:20] you understand me because whenever
[11:23] Christ is in presence you're going to
[11:26] see the supernatural hallelujah he
[11:29] brings the supernatural to us and
[11:32] therefore that's how we know he is the
[11:35] one that's how we know this is the
[11:38] message hallelujah
[11:39] because of the super natural sign that
[11:43] follows in him right and jesus answered
[11:45] and said of in him go your way tell John
[11:48] the
[11:49] things you have seen and heard
[11:51] hallelujah how that the blind see the
[11:55] lame walk the lepers are clear is that
[11:58] right amen and when the mathematical
[12:00] thought came on the scene Amen what was
[12:03] happening the blind was seeing the lame
[12:06] was walking the lepers were cleansed the
[12:10] death heard hallelujah and the dead was
[12:13] raised hallelujah Jesus Christ the same
[12:17] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[12:20] that's why we follow this message
[12:23] because it shows the same side the same
[12:26] wonders hallelujah that Jesus Christ
[12:29] produced hallelujah she is a
[12:34] resurrection and we realized that when
[12:37] brother Elahi brother man was here the
[12:39] Bible tells us him he brother Branham
[12:42] tells us that Laodicea was completely
[12:45] black out
[12:46] that was no truth everything had become
[12:50] a lie hallelujah thank God for a prophet
[12:54] hallelujah why because what God did he
[12:57] gave us grace see this is the our grace
[13:01] hallelujah he could have resurrected the
[13:04] holiness in age but he didn't hallelujah
[13:07] but there was a choice group of people a
[13:11] special class of people that God could
[13:14] not leave out so by the hand of a
[13:17] prophet he drew that little light within
[13:20] the Laodicea name hallelujah and you and
[13:24] I was in the light Oh glory to God
[13:28] hallelujah what is it we have been
[13:30] chosen to see the resurrected Lord in
[13:34] our day is that right this resurrection
[13:47] I've never had this happen but
[14:11] somebody's going to catch what God is
[14:13] trying to you know and I tell you what
[14:26] we think about how God has predestinated
[14:29] us placed us amen
[14:33] in this Dark Age have you ever noticed
[14:36] Amen that in in in the dark kappa
[14:40] stock.com veil of the enemy I can't say
[14:45] the word right now okay
[14:47] tapestry uh-huh anyway y'all know what
[14:51] I'm saying
[14:52] it's like that the whole sky is dark but
[14:58] one thing about those lights they stand
[15:01] by themselves
[15:02] we call them stars hallelujah so what am
[15:08] I saying
[15:09] don't you be of light you still can
[15:11] stand even if it's by yourself and as we
[15:16] stand by ourselves together it's
[15:19] beautiful
[15:20] is that right Amen so you're not
[15:23] realized by God's grace amen that here
[15:26] he says him and let him know what I'm
[15:29] doing John so you can have your wrist I
[15:31] am the right one
[15:33] brother Bannerman in the message amen
[15:36] snow white dog he talks about the dog
[15:38] and how that looked teachin amen was
[15:41] designed to carry the message back
[15:43] overseas to where the war was going on
[15:46] and say when that dub again to fly he
[15:49] began to get hit and he got wounded and
[15:51] everything else he was bleeding but that
[15:53] dog made it home hallelujah
[15:57] who tried to stop this message from
[15:59] reaching those ones who it was me
[16:01] destinated fall but God by his own grace
[16:06] through a dog so the Prophet that you
[16:10] and I got it hallelujah we the ones he
[16:14] meant is here to receive what God has
[16:18] sent for us amen

[17:45] Lazarus after he raised from the dead

[17:56] justification sanctification baptism of
[17:58] the Holy Ghost and by God's grace the
[18:01] bride shows up what is it it's a rather
[18:05] action is that the truth
[18:08] that's what brother man who said he said
[18:10] when go
[18:10] amen produce Seth Seth was a
[18:13] resurrection of Abel hallelujah the
[18:17] Bible said when God self came on the
[18:19] scene then men began to praise the Lord

[18:24] praise Amen was reestablished it meant
[18:27] by that resurrection hallelujah and

[18:32] resurrection of emphasis hallelujah
[18:36] she's a resurrection the house will have
[18:38] become the Omega and all that we lost
[18:42] throughout the Dark Ages has been
[18:44] restored search me O God this is what I
[18:51] said you know we must focus on his
[18:53] coming that word focus means to
[18:56] concentrate yeah he'll concentrate on it
[19:03] let nothing disturb you right now I'm
[19:06] concentrating y'all know what I'm saying
[19:08] have you ever had a map problem or
[19:10] something you had to do and y'all know
[19:11] math math it's basically equations and
[19:14] remembering them if you can remember
[19:16] their equations you can do the math
[19:17] right and and you concentrate now y
[19:23] equals ax and you learn that formula
[19:26] because you know that formula is gonna
[19:28] bring you to the result you're looking
[19:30] for stick any kind of number in there
[19:32] and you go get what you're looking for
[19:34] at the end of the day if you know how to
[19:36] operate the follow Mila is that right
[19:38] that's what that's what Jesus had to
[19:41] tell us right you speak with the oneness
[19:45] you get the right other area remember
[19:50] said he's a he's a multiplier but he
[19:53] multiplies by one one-time anything is
[19:57] one one time one time one time one time
[20:00] one or whatever if you got five times
[20:03] one it still just kill you and I look
[20:07] and you see it gonna come up with the
[20:09] right number you think about how God
[20:13] comes along he says now I want you to
[20:15] understand how fast your profession
[20:20] don't let the devil make you think
[20:22] you're a hypocrite no matter what
[20:24] don't let the devil think that you're
[20:27] not a god and and don't let the devil
[20:29] make you think that you know you your
[20:32] foolish virgins you foolish virgin if
[20:34] you even think it as a bad thing as a
[20:39] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[20:42] how can God call you to this message and
[20:45] you can accept that that's foolishness
[20:48] ah because you're basing your salvation
[20:52] upon your works how good you are getting
[20:57] good brother BAM who said you're fails
[21:00] to begin with none of us is good is that
[21:03] right none of us are righteous the Bible
[21:05] said even our righteousness is as filthy
[21:07] rags the Lord said I tried to find a
[21:11] faithful woman I tried to find one out
[21:14] of cell mum and I didn't find not one
[21:16] [Laughter]
[21:18] and you know those those those women
[21:21] represents churches he said I didn't
[21:23] find 9 it ain't the church that saves
[21:26] you it's a blood of Jesus Christ
[21:29] it's the perfect one concentrate on it
[21:32] because if God a man can save you he did
[21:36] by His grace he can also present you
[21:40] faultless you see that's what makes us
[21:47] powerful when we realize there are no
[21:51] sins against us it literally stopped the
[21:56] devil from fighting your mind
[21:58] oh come on somebody because if God has
[22:03] placed his Holy Spirit in you the Bible
[22:06] says you cannot sin somebody help me
[22:12] here so that in itself produces the
[22:15] resurrection the resurrection and the
[22:19] life
[22:23] hallelujah what do you talk about when
[22:25] Jesus rose from the dead he was doing
[22:27] even far more than he did before first
[22:30] of all he was able to walk through walls
[22:34] disappearing just transport hallelujah
[22:42] he was doing all kinds of things and
[22:45] think about it people of God the
[22:47] greatest thing that Jesus did was to
[22:49] break himself up into a hundred and
[22:51] twenty people and feel them I'm thinking
[22:54] okay 120 people and you still got the
[22:57] power of Jesus
[22:58] what about it when he broke himself up
[22:59] some more amen to five thousand and
[23:02] three thousand and think about it today
[23:04] another new American number and he's
[23:07] still powerful
[23:10] that's the resurrection and you and I
[23:13] are supposed to produce children of the
[23:16] resurrection hallelujah how you gonna do
[23:19] that brother Brooks not by Billy
[23:21] Graham's message not by Oral Roberts
[23:24] message hallelujah but the children of
[23:27] the Resurrection comes by the message of
[23:29] William Branham hallelujah he's the one
[23:32] that's bringing the largest fire he's
[23:35] the one that rainy largest fire
[23:41] hallelujah when that fire fell on Mount
[23:43] Carmel halleluiah showed that God was
[23:46] still living that right about said it
[23:50] licked everything up consumed everything
[23:52] hallelujah that's what I want God to do
[23:54] as I present my body as a living
[23:57] sacrifice I want him to link everything
[23:59] up consume everything hallelujah that
[24:03] even the bear worshipers will know that
[24:05] God is God is that all right you think
[24:11] about it I say hey God amen saw Adam and
[24:14] Eve fall God could have brought his
[24:16] wrath but he didn't he brought his love
[24:19] he brought his grace and he came down
[24:22] and he he literally walked and found
[24:26] them because the Bible said he walked in
[24:28] the cool of the evening is in sin Adam
[24:31] where I doubt not God you know God knew
[24:33] where they were Hey
[24:35] that would have been nowhere on earth
[24:36] they they could have high hidden from
[24:39] God but he asked him where are you and
[24:43] we find out by God's grace amen Adam
[24:46] comes out of the Lord
[24:47] Oh
[24:49] because I was naked I love this portion
[24:51] right here and he says who told you you
[24:53] would that's the serpent seed right
[24:57] there a man not what told you what book
[25:00] you read who that same old thing that
[25:04] stood up like a man
[25:06] glory to God talk like a man look like a
[25:10] man but he was not a man
[25:13] hey somebody glory to God listen so you
[25:17] and I must understand Paul says listen
[25:19] I'm pressing toward the same mark you
[25:21] pressing toward is that right
[25:23] he's about brethren I count not myself
[25:25] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[25:28] do forgetting those things which are
[25:30] behind and reaching forth and those
[25:33] things which are above I press anybody
[25:37] know what pressing is if you ever played
[25:40] football or something like that you have
[25:41] your obstacle I I'll never forget those
[25:43] machines we had to hit you know like we
[25:45] was hitting a person you know and and
[25:47] then more powerful you hit that thing
[25:48] too many and you can move it you felt
[25:50] like your guy hands I had a little
[25:52] something and you hit those day and you
[25:55] run and you hit him you you couldn't you
[25:57] couldn't just go up there like a
[25:59] and just cuz the coat to get on you
[26:02] right you had to hit it and it you had
[26:05] to either be a good actor oh you just
[26:08] knew what she was doing because you
[26:09] really had to hit that thing hard and
[26:11] you hit that thing and you push it on
[26:15] everybody looking at you to see how far
[26:17] you can push it but all of that was
[26:22] practice so that when you hit somebody
[26:26] in the game you envision hitting them
[26:29] like you hit the Machine you're not
[26:33] hitting the person now cuz you might
[26:34] feel sorry you might have some empathy
[26:37] for it but you got to hit that man like
[26:40] you're hitting the machine boom and
[26:41] that's when you see everything moving
[26:43] far away because no man had that kind of
[26:47] power behind him like that machine so
[26:49] you said all brother what are you saying
[26:51] because that's what makes you a good
[26:52] tackle that's what that man is looking
[26:54] for he's looking for a man that has no
[26:56] fear that his training has took all the
[27:00] fear out of him
[27:02] that's what God is looking for is that
[27:04] right
[27:05] he said perfect love casts out fear that
[27:08] is the only way that you'll be able to
[27:11] see the resurrection move in your life
[27:13] because you're now trusting the Lord
[27:16] whoa hey God good to us I don't say
[27:21] anything and I trusted I I'm here to be
[27:26] a blessing to you brother Branham said
[27:29] sanctify us Lord fill us anew with the
[27:31] Holy Spirit make the Holy Ghost just
[27:34] reign in our hearts supremely that will
[27:36] walk forgetting the things that are in
[27:39] the past
[27:40] the muck and the mire that we once lived
[27:42] in we're pressed toward the mark of a
[27:45] high calling where our life can so shine
[27:48] and sweetness and humility
[27:49] till every passerby can say there's a
[27:53] Christian Lodge there on that heel that
[27:56] person that woman Amen that man is a
[27:59] real consecrated flower of God they're
[28:03] so sweet and so kind always loving and
[28:06] sweet and understanding granite father
[28:08] let us be salty that the earth might
[28:11] thirst again hallelujah is that our I
[28:14] you know I I somebody sent me the
[28:17] scripture and I said Lord I don't even
[28:19] know how I'm gonna put this in my in my
[28:21] message but I am I said lord I don't
[28:25] even know how you're gonna bring it up
[28:26] but in Jeremiah it touched me it said
[28:29] not this week it's at Jeremiah 15:16
[28:32] says thy words were found and I did eat
[28:36] them and thy word was so I was unto me
[28:40] the joy and rejoicing of my heart let
[28:43] let me tell you something nothing to
[28:44] give me the joy like the word hallelujah
[28:48] for I am called by thy name o God of
[28:54] hosts he said I did eat them and that
[29:00] word was unto me the joy and rejoicing
[29:04] of my heart and y'all know how ideas
[29:07] sometimes Amen you you you got a
[29:09] revelation from the Lord and you go try
[29:11] to share it with a brother y'all bubbly
[29:12] and everything else
[29:14] yes and they can't see it that is so
[29:17] disappointing because you all over well
[29:21] with it you're thrilled about it and you
[29:24] try to show them and they can't see it
[29:25] Oh Lord amen and then sometime you try
[29:28] again and maybe they might they might
[29:30] get it Amy you know we we look at this
[29:33] thing and I mean I'm having a good time
[29:35] I love the Lord and you know I we all
[29:40] make our mistakes but the best part
[29:43] about this walk is that you can always
[29:45] correct it there's nothing wrong with
[29:49] saying I'm sorry and forgive right
[29:58] coming for the message amen fundamentals
[30:00] of faith and I heard that you guys were
[30:03] talking about that this morning as I've
[30:06] said faith doesn't come by fasting faith
[30:12] doesn't come by praying reading a book
[30:15] then that assaults are enlightened some
[30:18] of us all of that's good fasting praying
[30:22] reading reading is a book but faith
[30:25] comes by a settled something that's in
[30:28] the human heart that tells you just as
[30:31] sure as you come to this church tonight
[30:33] when you come home you told your wife
[30:36] you'll be home after the service was
[30:38] over you do that unconsciously you just
[30:42] go out and get in your car and go on
[30:44] home now you could do not do it unless
[30:47] you have faith you could do it you never
[30:51] move from where you're sitting if you
[30:54] didn't have faith you couldn't raise up
[30:56] but you've done it so much and you just
[31:00] become so accustomed to those laws till
[31:04] it's a natural thing think about it
[31:07] everything we do is by faith something
[31:12] tells us when you know it's like riding
[31:14] a bicycle you know you're never rent
[31:16] rode one before but you something tell
[31:18] you I can ride a bike you know I
[31:21] remember one of my grandchildren telling
[31:23] me they could swim and they couldn't but
[31:25] in their mind they could swim
[31:28] and you know that's a good thing because
[31:30] eventually they will accomplish their
[31:32] confession
[31:33] my grandson we would go fishing and I
[31:36] wouldn't catch hardly anything but he
[31:38] said oh I'm gonna catch this and I'm
[31:40] gonna catch that and he did and you know
[31:43] I thought he was playing with me and
[31:44] roll his little thing out there and he
[31:47] said I'm gonna catch a big sore and song
[31:50] and net will come up but he keeps saying
[31:53] it and all of a sudden Here Come a big
[31:55] fish as a man that's the way I think I
[31:59] think the fish know mean somebody said
[32:02] they think it almost tail that you're
[32:04] nervous about where you hold your line
[32:06] I don't know but you know they do go to
[32:08] school with me stop but nevertheless you
[32:14] and I must understand Amen that God a
[32:18] man knows you and faith is more simple
[32:23] than we believe or see it's not
[32:26] something you have to be educated in
[32:28] there's not something Amen you have to
[32:30] push muscles to make it happen it just
[32:34] happens you know it's real there's no
[32:38] doubt there is no fear amen you don't
[32:41] even know when it's gonna happen but you
[32:42] know it's going to happen right that's
[32:45] it's something you can't explain but you
[32:47] know it right Amen so that's how it is
[32:50] and I you've heard me tell us I won't
[32:53] tell it you know but I'll tell you many
[32:55] of the things I have accomplished by
[32:57] having faith in God just believe in the
[33:02] scripture if I ask of anything and
[33:05] believe that I would receive it I want
[33:07] to get it right and you know most of the
[33:13] time I said like this or every time tax
[33:15] season comes I know my faith got to kick
[33:18] in and it watch
[33:24] [Laughter]
[33:27] hallelujah can I continue to read Amen
[33:30] he says now you could not do it unless
[33:32] you have faith you could you could do it
[33:34] you never move from where you're sitting
[33:36] now he goes on says now if we could
[33:39] through ourselves
[33:40] he said now if we could throw ourselves
[33:43] completely to God and to his will and be
[33:47] lost to our own thoughts and just let
[33:50] the mind of Christ being us then them
[33:53] same operations of the Spirit will work
[33:57] through us just as natural things does
[34:00] just the same thing because we first
[34:04] create because we were first created for
[34:08] the purpose to control to rule to praise
[34:12] God and to live for God he said that's
[34:15] the whole purpose Adam you room you know
[34:19] I concur you know subdue right whatever
[34:24] you see in the garden that ain't right
[34:25] change it that's what we were that's
[34:28] what we used to have it that's that's
[34:31] our purpose so when the Holy Ghost come
[34:33] he restores that hallelujah alright and
[34:39] it now Jesus said if you abide in me and
[34:41] my words abide in you you can ask what
[34:43] you will and it shall be given unto you
[34:46] if you abide in me and my word about in
[34:49] you now what's the father and his word
[34:52] is inseparable cause the word is his son
[34:55] and in the beginning was the word and
[34:57] the Word was with God and the Word was
[34:58] God and the Word was made flesh and
[35:01] dwelt among us God and his word is
[35:04] inseparable y'all get that that means
[35:07] this is God you can't separate it but
[35:11] say he's on the page but he's a spirit
[35:13] this world on the page is something that
[35:16] you can see and understand inseparable
[35:22] so when you use the word on anything you
[35:25] understand that's God they say I can't
[35:30] be changed you can't be changed if you
[35:31] want to be you say I can't be delivered
[35:33] you can be delivered if you want to be O
[35:37] therefore it is a faith
[35:40] that it might be by grace and to the end
[35:43] of the promise might be sure to all see
[35:45] not to that only which is of the law but
[35:47] to that also which is of faith of
[35:51] Abraham who is the father of all us all
[35:55] now you show why you work with faith
[35:57] down because remember when Peter name
[36:00] walked by the gate of beautiful and they
[36:03] proceeded that this man who was a
[36:05] impotent man who could be healed and and
[36:08] and Peter said to the man silver and go
[36:11] have I none but such as I have give I D
[36:16] rise up and walk right and you think
[36:23] well where he get his authority from
[36:25] because you and I must understand once
[36:28] you and I unite with the word we become
[36:31] the word we become the voice of the book
[36:35] is that right is that what brother
[36:38] branham words he was the voice of the
[36:40] book man we are the voice the voice is
[36:45] in the bride and so you and I must
[36:49] understand if you read this word and
[36:52] speak this word in faith it has to come
[36:54] to pass because every word was spoken by
[36:57] faith you say well what is faith faith
[37:00] is not a thing
[37:01] faith is a person when the person of
[37:06] Christ is in you you know God is gonna
[37:09] believe in his own word right he
[37:10] believes in his own word you know how I
[37:20] got to be careful I was getting attached
[37:22] to these brothers too attached they went
[37:24] in my heart over they they doing
[37:26] something to me but you know I love them
[37:28] I appreciate you keep doing something
[37:30] amen God is good to me it's just from
[37:33] when I was a young oh my god if I ever
[37:36] had wish for youth again it would be to
[37:38] preach this gospel I tell you what if it
[37:41] paid I don't devil up when I was a young
[37:43] boy we was on the street preaching on
[37:45] the street Amen seeing God deliver
[37:47] seeing God healed amen
[37:49] drug addicts and everything else I don't
[37:50] even know where they are I hope they
[37:52] still standing in
[37:54] hallelujah amen how at that old
[37:56] Apostolic Church they gave me a key to
[37:58] the church so whenever I warned the
[38:00] baptized morning noon and night I could
[38:02] go up there and baptized
[38:03] oh yeah we had a few little sisters and
[38:07] brothers we get on that prayer that
[38:09] tambourine it's saying and I preach Oh
[38:12] God have mercy God is so good to us now
[38:17] here the problem said faith is an
[38:19] overcomer
[38:20] it just is it just isn't a peacemaker it
[38:26] overcomes faith is the victory that
[38:29] overcomes the world what does it do what
[38:33] is faith faith what is to conquer
[38:37] conquer and victory is the same to
[38:40] conquer it means to beat down to
[38:43] override the hand call to throw into
[38:46] prison
[38:48] I always got drunk confident when I read
[38:51] it let me read this again it compass it
[38:59] caught to conquer means to beat now to
[39:04] override the hand cup to throw into
[39:07] prison that means that guy ain't got no
[39:11] chance whatever it is you better watch
[39:15] out faith coming right it means that the
[39:18] sin that was ruled you you rule it now
[39:22] it means you have have overcome it you
[39:26] whipped it you are greater than it well
[39:29] you're greater than it hallelujah mm-hmm
[39:34] a religious right now he says what which
[39:38] was first a sinner or savior a savior
[39:41] for Savior is more powerful than a sin
[39:44] which was first they heal all the
[39:46] sickness it couldn't be a healer less he
[39:49] was over the sickness
[39:51] it is a healer it can conquer the
[39:54] sickness and faith is the victory that
[39:56] overcomes every curse of the devil
[39:59] because faith is the victory faith in
[40:03] what not faith in your church not faith
[40:05] in your Creed
[40:06] not faint in some man but faith in Jesus
[40:09] Christ who made the promise that that's
[40:12] the victory what is it
[40:14] it is the victory say my arm is still
[40:16] crippled but faith but faith is is the
[40:19] victory
[40:20] I still feel sick but faith is the
[40:22] victory oh it caught overcomes the world
[40:25] when you can't climb it he says when you
[40:28] when you can climb into God by prayer
[40:32] until you see things conquered under you
[40:36] there is nothing that can hurt you then
[40:41] prayer you got to come in there climb
[40:45] into God hallelujah amen till you can
[40:49] see he says till you can see the things
[40:53] are conquered under you there is nothing
[40:56] that can hurt you then you overcome you
[40:59] got 50 miles of elbow room where the
[41:05] better got a way of saying it was he
[41:07] said you got 50 miles of elbow room
[41:12] sailing free then over to God is that
[41:15] all right people we're talking about
[41:17] this life of Christ you know we've seen
[41:19] it in William Brennan we know was there
[41:22] like I was telling somebody you know I
[41:24] met many people a man who was with the
[41:26] Prophet but only a few people had what
[41:28] he had y'all know what I'm saying you
[41:32] know a lot of them fussing and fighting
[41:34] and everything but I found those who had
[41:36] character I've seen them I've talked
[41:39] with them I fellowship with them and in
[41:41] my mind I'm thinking wow there's
[41:45] something that is something that some of
[41:48] the some some did catch it some did get
[41:50] it boom
[41:52] but listen we are the new generation I
[41:55] know what y'all looking at me like what
[41:57] you're talking about but nevertheless
[41:58] I'm still young generation I'm still
[42:03] with Joshua and Caleb hallelujah and
[42:06] we're going to comp in this land
[42:09] hallelujah I just hoped by God's grace
[42:12] because brother Brandon talk about their
[42:13] young people you know who's gonna take
[42:14] this message and sweep it - it's coming
[42:16] huh I used to say that all the time now
[42:20] another little group of young people
[42:21] coming up and I'm like yes Lord I gotta
[42:23] be in this because I do believe Amen
[42:29] that that's what the world is looking
[42:31] for now there's a movement going on down
[42:35] there in North Carolina area and they
[42:37] call it a new Azusa Street and guess
[42:39] what it's all young people so the devil
[42:43] know what the message is saying so what
[42:45] he's trying to do is produce a copycat
[42:49] hallelujah but there is a real group of
[42:52] young man like Joshua took over Amen
[42:56] across that Jordan he took them and they
[42:58] conquered the land hallelujah and that's
[43:01] what we're looking for we're looking for
[43:03] that group of people in this message
[43:05] that willing amen to conquer the land
[43:07] not a shame of this message not a shame
[43:10] amen and no they got some power
[43:12] hallelujah yes Lord people say this is
[43:19] what I love about Jesus nobody can take
[43:21] your position God has ordained you you
[43:28] know it's hard it's hard for a dead man
[43:30] to be revived it takes a supernatural
[43:34] element to make that happen
[43:36] right because a dead man came here he
[43:39] can't see he can't smell he can taste
[43:41] there's nothing about a dead man can
[43:43] even sense the presence of life ah
[43:46] but God is the only one that can open
[43:48] that channel and make it happen
[43:51] hey man y'all don't think about it how
[43:53] did that dead man hear Jesus say rise up
[43:57] my son Oh hallelujah
[44:02] ha Amen did Lazard hear Jesus say cuff
[44:06] all rotted as he will see the thing
[44:13] about it you don't hear with your ears
[44:14] you hear with your soul it's your soul
[44:19] and spirit that you here with this is
[44:22] just a house hallelujah is that right it
[44:27] was true now I've never seen this but it
[44:29] was told that brother a man had a glass
[44:33] eye
[44:33] well fake I and brother branham
[44:36] prepaying I purchased I don't know true
[44:38] but I heard that that man and a woman
[44:40] whoever it was were able to see through
[44:42] that fake I Oh hallelujah
[44:49] is that right I don't know whether it's
[44:51] true but I don't doubt it
[45:01] yeah God is she creator he can do what
[45:05] he wants to do the God have mercy of the
[45:10] world would have known it I've been
[45:12] showing them that fake out and I can see
[45:14] through I don't know but you know you
[45:17] look at this thing and you say oh god
[45:19] what would I say I'm saying all of these
[45:21] things people you don't see me laughing
[45:23] it's because I got a lot of joy right
[45:25] now amen
[45:27] I mama close in just a minute brother
[45:30] and said they used to take the gold
[45:32] before they had the smelter and the
[45:36] beader would beat the gold now listen
[45:38] what let me go back to faith just a
[45:40] moment cuz something struck me while I
[45:41] was reading that don't you know you
[45:43] would before this place he was perfect
[45:49] here so this place could never harm you
[45:56] because in either God you're perfect
[45:59] right before so if the Savior was here
[46:04] before the sinner then the Savior is
[46:07] greater than the sinner if you were here
[46:10] before you became a sinner you here is
[46:16] greater than the seller and that's why I
[46:20] really believe that the prophet of God
[46:22] said he says in turn week we paraphrase
[46:24] it he said when you have heard this
[46:26] message you have heard from your
[46:27] theophany do you realize what that means
[46:32] do you realize what that means
[46:35] see the devil the devil children don't
[46:37] have a day off in it but if you got to
[46:40] be happy your theophany is greater than
[46:43] this body
[46:45] you you came come shot people you can't
[46:48] because you were made greater than this
[46:55] hmm I don't know how what all we got to
[47:00] go through to get there but we're
[47:01] getting there
[47:03] hallelujah listen and now he knew that
[47:06] he talked about smithing and beating
[47:08] with gold and turning it over and
[47:10] beating and beating until it beat the
[47:12] dross out of it and how he knew that it
[47:14] got down to really good gold all the
[47:17] pure light and all the food goal and so
[47:20] thought was beat out of it but he said
[47:23] the betta could see the reflection of
[47:25] himself in it then he knowed he had
[47:28] cleaned it had he he had cleaned it
[47:31] listen my dear friend today when the
[47:33] Holy Spirit which is the beater
[47:36] everybody oh I got the holy food it's
[47:39] like God service joy but that whole ego
[47:41] still beat you that totally goes he is
[47:48] the beat-up will beat the church with
[47:51] the gospel to the reflection of Jesus
[47:53] Christ shines into the church now you
[47:56] may not want to say it like but I'm
[47:58] gonna say it Lord be beat me beat the
[48:01] gold hallelujah hey get all the fools
[48:05] gold out of me get all the pyrite out of
[48:07] me
[48:08] hallelujah haha because I want to see
[48:10] you see your reflection in me that's
[48:16] what I want
[48:17] ooh we got too much pyrite and copper
[48:21] and other things in us yet it must be
[48:23] brought out and the only the beater can
[48:26] do it a revival is what we need y'all
[48:31] know that's true I guarantee you I said
[48:34] like this the greatest enemy that you
[48:35] and all have you and I have is our wheel
[48:39] mmm you know if I wheel was dead we
[48:43] would never have to worry about
[48:44] temptations but we're tempted because of
[48:49] our will and that's what we need to say
[48:52] Lord destroy the wheel my wheel and let
[48:56] thy will be done
[48:58] right drain me oh god of my life and
[49:02] feel me with yours
[49:04] hey brother keep setting this to me the
[49:07] other day and you know I have different
[49:09] brothers that be sharing with me and I I
[49:11] really appreciate it any of you ever
[49:13] come across a good quote or good a good
[49:15] scripture just text it to me
[49:18] everybody else be taking this stuff you
[49:21] welcome to a minute I cuz I love it I
[49:24] love it amen
[49:25] many times I've gone by somebody else's
[49:27] text and and and it's like the Lord just
[49:29] speaking to me right there hmm that's
[49:33] good and a lot of lot of them from
[49:35] overseas don't even know me there's one
[49:38] chicks coming in from Guyana Trinidad
[49:42] rather I don't know who the person is
[49:44] they'd only have been named they got
[49:46] Trinidad and God speaks through them
[49:51] mm-hmm yeah you look like he lied to now
[49:55] you look at all in money you know what's
[49:59] going on in my life praise the Lord
[50:01] yeah that's when it hit me I always try
[50:04] to reply thank you ooh
[50:09] if you die you take the blood out of a
[50:13] band if you embalm him trouble over the
[50:16] years a lot of them never got in bond
[50:19] you take the blood out of the man he's
[50:22] gone
[50:22] then the only thing you can do is put
[50:25] another blood back in him he's going to
[50:29] live again you took his blood out and
[50:32] now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in
[50:35] see and that brings the faith of Jesus
[50:39] Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the
[50:42] knowledge of Jesus Christ
[50:44] the temperance of Jesus Christ the
[50:46] patience of jesus christ the godliness
[50:49] of jesus christ the brotherly kindness
[50:51] of jesus christ and the love of God
[50:53] which is Jesus Christ see he's ahead and
[50:57] controls you your your feet is the
[51:02] foundation faith amen controlled by the
[51:05] air takes what there you are there is a
[51:08] perfect man of God when he's pathetic
[51:11] Zess is these virtues ooh then God
[51:15] representing his bride as a bride a
[51:18] woman God representing his church as a
[51:20] bride and the way he brings each
[51:23] individual to it being his son to go in
[51:26] that bride he also has brought the bride
[51:29] through these ages hallelujah he'll
[51:32] bring this one complete church into this
[51:36] and so you and I must understand is the
[51:40] problem is that we can get a true blood
[51:43] transfusion diet our old DNA and get the
[51:50] DNA of Jesus Christ
[51:51] we'll be pretty good fellows right so we
[51:58] appreciate the goodness of the Lord what
[52:00] do we see and I don't know maybe I'm
[52:02] maybe I'm off somewhere maybe I'm off
[52:06] but I believe the message and brother
[52:09] Branham said at the end of the day we
[52:11] should produce a super church this
[52:15] message is supposed to produce a
[52:16] supercharged and I cannot be satisfied
[52:19] with religion y'all know what I'm saying
[52:22] and that's what the disciples they had
[52:24] done had religion all their lives and
[52:26] then when they saw Jesus they knew
[52:28] something was different about him and
[52:29] they followed him and Jesus didn't
[52:32] didn't pay him in coins but he says
[52:34] listen I'm gonna give you eternal life
[52:37] somebody help me so any fed them he
[52:41] taught them and you know I always think
[52:44] it's just so mysterious to me that men
[52:47] who never knew him would follow him and
[52:50] he didn't even have a house to take him
[52:51] to he had a house but he wasn't here yet
[53:03] amen and you think about the people of
[53:06] God how God has taken us places with
[53:09] following him there's no earthly house
[53:13] here he can take you to but there is one
[53:15] of coming and you and I know that we
[53:19] can't help but the following my sheep
[53:21] hear my voice and a stranger they will
[53:22] not follow now you and I've got it
[53:25] we're not the people we used to be now
[53:29] you know it maybe you're not where you
[53:31] want to be but you know you're not the
[53:33] person that you used to be you know a
[53:35] change is taking place in you hallelujah
[53:39] if it had not been you and be here
[53:42] listening to it like I try to tell
[53:45] people we ain't got no choir here and we
[53:47] don't have no great Oh y'all musicians
[53:52] not y'all but you know my point is you
[53:55] know this church like a lot of the
[53:58] things that will would with it would
[54:00] attract the outside world
[54:03] but the only thing we have is the word
[54:05] and the love that we have one toward
[54:10] another is that the right the Bible said
[54:12] they will know that you are His
[54:14] disciples because of the love that you
[54:16] have one toward see if you ain't got
[54:20] nothing but that you got the greatest
[54:21] thing right is that right that's what
[54:25] brother brother said he said I really
[54:26] have perfect love than any gift and
[54:28] that's the way I feel
[54:30] give me that and everything else will
[54:32] fall in place you love the Lord we have
[54:36] been called to bring this revival to the
[54:40] surface you hear people said I was was
[54:44] dead but now I'm alive and I once was
[54:46] bound but now I'm free if nobody can
[54:49] sing that song or should be able to sing
[54:51] that song like the bride hmm nobody you
[55:00] know I think off a brother Frank he
[55:01] always blesses up with a good song amen
[55:05] he's got a gift there too yeah
[55:08] on how to put into use service you know
[55:15] you look you look by God's grace and you
[55:17] thank God you know for all that God has
[55:20] given to us and we are so blessed but
[55:23] let us keep in mind I heard you but let
[55:29] us keep in mind
[55:32] amen that we are here for purpose it
[55:37] doesn't mean
[55:38] we're not going to make mistakes but in
[55:40] the eyes of God we make no mistakes
[55:43] right it ain't gonna be God gonna wait
[55:46] til you get perfect when you he's
[55:48] already perfect in his eyes you're
[55:51] perfect in his eyes you're faultless is
[55:58] that right that's what the scripture
[55:59] says there's only Jesus Christ they can
[56:01] present us faultless and then the
[56:05] scripture says we are accepted in the
[56:07] beloved so therefore you were as a
[56:10] person in yourself you're not accepted
[56:12] but because you are in him you are
[56:15] accepted that's all I'm saying
[56:18] I feel like a kid right now I am
[56:22] thoroughly and happy you know we yes the
[56:26] other day I full of most of my back I
[56:29] had some kind of muscle spasm couldn't
[56:31] hardly breathe and now everything is
[56:34] well so my body is rejoicing Wednesday
[56:39] night I came in here suffering you
[56:41] didn't know it but I was suffering but
[56:43] thank God today I am NOT and I know I
[56:46] give all glory to God a man you love the
[56:50] Lord I told you I wasn't gonna be long
[56:53] just just getting in and I just wish I
[56:56] could pull this thing out like I see it
[57:00] because whenever there's a resurrection
[57:02] there's always an explosion you know you
[57:06] think about when brother Branham healed
[57:08] or delivered that was the Russian got a
[57:11] little fellow that was hit by the car
[57:13] and how it literally changed the
[57:16] attitude of two nations who hated each
[57:18] other and all again they began to hug
[57:21] you know it was it was it was a revival
[57:25] something took place in the Swede and
[57:28] the church said we can serve a god like
[57:30] this see it changes and it was just
[57:34] because they're a resurrection had taken
[57:36] place the dead raised again and that's
[57:40] what we need to be looking for if
[57:45] they're going to be revived I remember
[57:47] now
[57:47] brother Brad was a preacher he was a
[57:49] powerful preacher but God gave
[57:51] him things to these attract the people
[57:56] and the bride of Jesus Christ we need
[57:59] things that to attract the people real
[58:05] things but only the way God is going to
[58:08] give us to it we gotta have a pure heart
[58:10] because the Bible said only the pure in
[58:12] heart shall see God so we're looking for
[58:15] God because it is all over I just can't
[58:18] accept what people are saying I believe
[58:20] that God is the interpreter of his own
[58:22] word right he will do it he won't do it
[58:27] hallelujah but I'm gonna keep believing
[58:29] he gonna do it and if he choose not to
[58:32] do it that's his business but I am
[58:35] looking for God to do something among us
[58:38] here you know I was sitting here
[58:41] wherever cuz I know that God is not set
[58:43] in here for naught and I'm gonna keep
[58:46] believing if I don't see not one move
[58:48] one thing move I was to company come
[58:51] amen
[58:53] right cuz I have the faith that he given
[58:57] me for this place in this position less
[59:00] than
[59:09] I realized one thing about him I see how
[59:11] he does things yeah he'll make sure he
[59:14] promised you something and he'll wait
[59:16] wait - the whole situation is dead and
[59:18] rotted to see whether you gonna give up
[59:22] on hope see whether you gonna give up
[59:24] and say it can't happen now the
[59:26] condition is too bad now I there's no
[59:29] way this can happen and then that's when
[59:31] God said what are you talking about all
[59:34] things are possible
[59:35] I'm the creator of all things right I
[59:39] could make this stone you say a stone
[59:42] cane yes he can I can make that stone
[59:45] hear my voice I can command that stone
[59:47] to cry and that stone will cry out
[59:49] that's don't appraise me all I gotta do
[59:52] is tell him to do it then that's faith
[59:55] if Jesus said I can make these stones
[59:58] cry out no I'm sure they couldn't
[1:00:01] comprehend it but don't you know that's
[1:00:04] the truth when God couldn't find a
[1:00:07] preacher to stop Balaam he chose a
[1:00:09] donkey and you think because that donkey
[1:00:15] would talk was talking Baylor would have
[1:00:17] fell to his feet It was as if he Eve eat
[1:00:23] heard the donkey talk before but you see
[1:00:27] that's how it is we could be so kind of
[1:00:29] minded we could be so blind to go to do
[1:00:31] a supernatural thing we won't see him
[1:00:33] nor hearing and then that donkey say
[1:00:37] we're all up you beat me and I've been
[1:00:38] faithful to you I'm trying to protect
[1:00:42] you don't you see that don't you see
[1:00:47] that angel with a sword sword drawn he's
[1:00:50] getting ready to tell you up and then
[1:00:52] you beat me like I told somebody I dare
[1:01:01] say I was doing my carpet cleaning my
[1:01:04] carpet and God did something today
[1:01:07] allowing something to happen to that
[1:01:08] carpet cleaner started smoking and when
[1:01:12] it started smoking I started praying for
[1:01:14] the Holy Ghost spoke to me and
[1:01:16] everything he spoke to me come to pass
[1:01:20] not just that some other things
[1:01:21] something that was spiritual took place
[1:01:24] and God healed it God delivered it
[1:01:27] I said hole or die I said Lord ah I want
[1:01:32] to finish this carpet Lord just let it
[1:01:35] run so I can finish it was so good to us
[1:01:46] I like that song oh-oh-oh-oh
