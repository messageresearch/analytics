[0:02] Glad to see our sister Liz.
[0:06] Glad nobody was hurt.
[0:09] That's the most important thing,
[0:15] God. Uh it's amazing how this morning
[0:17] God was telling us about these trials.
[0:20] They always come up and none of us are
[0:23] exempt.
[0:25] Some of us it just seems like it comes
[0:27] our way more frequently. But you know,
[0:29] God is not confused. He knows exactly
[0:32] what he's doing. And I believe with all
[0:35] my heart that scripture is true.
[0:37] Sometimes it's hard to swallow,
[0:39] especially when it comes to you
[0:40] personally. All things work together
[0:44] for the good because uh you know uh God
[0:48] uh knows that he knows how to work it
[0:50] toward our good. We're we're we're
[0:52] getting ready to embrace a rapture.
[0:55] and and and and and to me I that's what
[0:57] I see is a short quick work. It's
[0:59] painful but it's happening at a faster
[1:02] pace.
[1:03] Amen.
[1:04] And it's to draw us nearer, closer
[1:08] uh to God, you know, and and that's what
[1:10] we must realize
[1:12] if we could handle our trials
[1:15] uh like the Old Testament trial uh
[1:18] people in the New Testament, you know,
[1:19] when when things would come in a way,
[1:22] what they began to do was just worship
[1:26] to show Satan
[1:28] that he's got nothing here.
[1:30] Amen.
[1:32] And often times, you know, there are
[1:34] times it might be a sacrifice, but you
[1:36] can still give him the sacrifice of
[1:38] praise.
[1:39] So you worship God in the midst of all
[1:41] the troubles, and you'll see how God
[1:43] will bring this thing around. Amen. Glad
[1:45] to see you. I'm just so happy. If I need
[1:48] to help in any kind of way, let me know.
[1:51] God, first Corinthians, please.
[1:56] That's not where I want you to go. I'm
[1:57] sorry. Revelations.
[2:00] Revelations 10. You love the Lord.
[2:03] Amen.
[2:04] Amen. We appreciate I I I am I am I'm
[2:08] just uh uh I'm in a place and I can't
[2:12] explain it. It's like a
[2:16] a numbness. I'm I'm riding. I see what's
[2:20] happening and I've got no control of
[2:22] what he's doing, but I can see what he's
[2:24] doing.
[2:25] And I'm so grateful to what God is
[2:28] doing. It's kind of like I can't even
[2:31] explain what I'm experiencing in my life
[2:33] right now, but I can see changes being
[2:35] made in me from the inside out. Things
[2:39] that used to matter, things that used to
[2:41] have a weight uh just doesn't anymore.
[2:44] Uh my my aim and my goal is to see my
[2:48] life so transformed like him till he's
[2:51] so well pleased, he can say, "Come up
[2:54] hither."
[2:55] That's all that matters. That's all that
[2:58] matters. And each and every one of us,
[3:01] we ought to have that desire in us.
[3:04] Amen.
[3:05] You know, to to to desire that more than
[3:08] anything.
[3:10] Amen.
[3:11] It is Satan's job to try to stop us.
[3:15] But he cannot.
[3:16] As we said this morning, you're locked
[3:18] in the scripture.
[3:20] You're locked in there. You can't get
[3:22] out of it.
[3:23] Amen.
[3:25] You know, have you have you ever uh
[3:27] ridden a I'm sorry for holding you like
[3:30] this. Have you ever gotten on a a roller
[3:32] coaster? You know, you go all the way up
[3:35] to the top and you're calling yourself a
[3:37] fool.
[3:39] There is no way of backing up. You got
[3:42] to take the ride.
[3:44] You're locked in and you got to take the
[3:46] ride. And that's basically how it is.
[3:49] You're locked in and you got to take the
[3:52] ride. Whatever way that track that that
[3:54] the footsteps of right man, a righteous
[3:56] man is ordered by the Lord. Whichever
[3:58] way that thing take you, you got to go.
[3:59] You can't get out. You can't jump out.
[4:01] It's it's that you buckle down in it and
[4:04] you got to just And I learned one thing
[4:06] in all of that. And that used to be my
[4:08] favorite ride.
[4:11] But I learned one thing in that when you
[4:13] taking a ride like that, you don't close
[4:15] your eyes. You keep your eyes open. You
[4:18] face what's coming before you. All
[4:20] right? Cuz if you close your eyes, your
[4:23] imagination get the best of you.
[4:26] You love the Lord. Amen. Ah, let's
[4:30] Revelations 10, please.
[4:34] Revelations 10.
[4:37] Hope this is okay this evening. I just
[4:39] want to encourage you. I I I I just came
[4:42] uh this morning with a a little uh uh uh
[4:45] teaching showing us, you know, it is it
[4:47] is a serious time, but it is not a time
[4:50] to be discouraged.
[4:53] Uh uh uh it is a time, amen, to uh do
[4:57] your best as far as uh remaining in his
[5:01] presence because the seals were open
[5:06] not for us to just to be under the
[5:08] anointing
[5:10] but to be in his presence.
[5:12] There's a difference between the
[5:14] anointing and his presence.
[5:17] The prophet of God tells us about that.
[5:19] We'll get into it in just a moment.
[5:21] Revelations 10 1-4.
[5:25] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[5:28] from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[5:32] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[5:36] was as it were the sun, and his feet as
[5:39] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand
[5:43] a little book open. And he set his right
[5:47] foot upon the sea, and his left foot on
[5:51] the earth, and cried with a loud voice,
[5:54] as when a lion roar. And when he had
[5:57] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[6:00] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[6:03] uttered their voices, I was about to
[6:06] write, and I heard a voice from heaven
[6:09] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[6:14] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[6:17] write them not." Let us pray. Father
[6:20] God, we come before you, Lord, as humbly
[6:23] as we know how. We thank you for your
[6:26] amazing grace. Lord, we thank you right
[6:29] now for everything uh you are doing to
[6:32] us even though we may not understand it.
[6:36] You your first commandment, Lord, is to
[6:38] love the Lord God with all of our
[6:41] hearts, Lord. And you told us, Lord, not
[6:44] to lean unto our own understanding. And
[6:47] so therefore, Lord, we're locked into
[6:49] those scriptures, Lord. God, it is our
[6:52] bread for today. and we thank you for
[6:55] your grace, your mercy, and your love.
[6:57] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[7:00] You may be seated. Now, for those of us
[7:04] uh uh uh is brother Randy with you this
[7:08] No. Okay. So, I just want to say this.
[7:11] This is a time of love and affection.
[7:13] You want to call him, go by, I think
[7:16] that he could use that. All right. Just
[7:20] throwing it out. I'm not telling who to
[7:22] do what, but I think uh a word of
[7:24] encouragement would really if we be the
[7:27] body of Christ, a word of encouragement
[7:31] uh would be a real uh because you know,
[7:33] he's been really getting it. He's been
[7:36] one trial after another. Put yourself in
[7:38] his position and and and think about how
[7:41] you would be feeling right now. So just
[7:44] just want to just want to make that uh
[7:46] uh
[7:48] available and and want to make it make
[7:50] sure that you are aware of of uh our
[7:53] brother's trials and beside that you
[7:56] know not being able to come to church
[7:58] like you desire you know so just put
[8:01] yourself there and and maybe send him a
[8:04] text or call or something you know so
[8:07] anyway you love the Lord
[8:09] now we're living in a time as I said,
[8:13] "We we know and and I'm not going to try
[8:15] to be long, but I want you to realize
[8:17] where you're sitting, where you're
[8:18] standing." And we we some of us do, but
[8:21] I want you to understand that when this
[8:24] took place,
[8:26] John was said uh told not to write it.
[8:29] Seal it up. Seal it up, John. Don't
[8:32] don't make mention of what what was
[8:34] being said. And we know according to I
[8:37] think Daniel the 12th chapter uh God
[8:39] tells Daniel see the vision of the end
[8:42] time and he said in this time he said
[8:45] men will be running to and fro and
[8:47] knowledge will increase. Now that's our
[8:49] time
[8:50] right now we realize this is our time
[8:54] but during this time where knowledge is
[8:57] is to be increased he also said that
[9:00] there will come a message.
[9:02] Amen.
[9:03] Amen. There's coming something from the
[9:05] Lord that will bring deliverance to the
[9:08] people.
[9:09] Amen.
[9:10] As we said this morning, amen. Remember
[9:12] the the God of this evil age, Amen, is
[9:16] basically not only just Satan, but Satan
[9:19] science, right? Versing uh uh uh versus
[9:23] God's word. Now, as a believer, we are
[9:27] primitive.
[9:28] We don't go with the fashions. We don't
[9:30] go with the Hollywood uh uh uh
[9:34] flamingos,
[9:36] but we we stay simple. We we we don't
[9:39] need all of the extras. And and to the
[9:42] to the world, we are oddballs. We are we
[9:46] are fanatics. We are uh people that the
[9:48] world laugh really the world laughs at
[9:51] the gospel.
[9:53] They look at those who follow Lord the
[9:56] Lord Jesus as being uh simple. You know,
[10:00] they they make fun of us. They always
[10:03] have. They they make fun of us because
[10:06] they say, "The only reason why we came
[10:08] to Christ is because our lives were a
[10:11] wreck."
[10:13] And I've heard people say, "Well, I've
[10:14] never had to go through that, so why
[10:16] should I come to Christ?"
[10:19] But you see, that's the way they look at
[10:21] it. You know, you couldn't get no other
[10:23] help. So, you find yourself falling at
[10:26] Jesus' feet.
[10:29] I don't know how other people see it,
[10:32] but it doesn't matter how it came. I'm
[10:35] glad I fell at his feet.
[10:38] Now, we we see this uh Revelations and
[10:41] and and understand that this message is
[10:44] not something that you supposed to put
[10:46] on the shelf and allow it to collect
[10:48] dust. This thing is so important. Daniel
[10:52] couldn't speak of it. John couldn't
[10:55] write it or speak of it. He had to put
[10:58] it in simple form.
[11:00] Amen.
[11:01] But the Bible tells us according to
[11:03] Revelation 8 that this one that had the
[11:06] book that John was supposed to seal or
[11:10] did seal, this book was open.
[11:12] Amen.
[11:13] And the Bible tells us that it was at
[11:15] the end time that this book would be
[11:19] made known. the revelation of what Jesus
[11:22] Christ was doing would be made known in
[11:26] this last day. Hello.
[11:28] Hello. You're the ones who who's who's
[11:31] who God has chosen. Oh my.
[11:35] When all of the world throughout all
[11:37] ages couldn't put your their eyes on
[11:41] this or even understand it, God chose
[11:45] you and I to understand what he's doing.
[11:50] Thank you, Lord.
[11:51] Now, I'm I'm blessed.
[11:53] I don't know how you see yourself. You
[11:55] say, "That sounds a little puffed up."
[11:57] Well, all I know is I'm just repeating
[11:59] what he said about me.
[12:01] He says I'm blessed. I'm going to say
[12:03] I'm blessed.
[12:06] Right? But you see what we must realize.
[12:10] Amen. As I said this morning, uh that
[12:14] this thing comes and it comes with
[12:17] suffering.
[12:19] Now there is no way you can be a
[12:21] Christian without suffering.
[12:24] The Bible tells us to arm ourselves.
[12:27] See why? The Bible tells us the
[12:30] adversary,
[12:32] he's like a roaring lion
[12:34] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[12:37] didn't say see who he may bite.
[12:41] Devour. That means to take you all in
[12:44] and leave nothing left.
[12:47] Y'all hear what I'm saying? So, we're
[12:49] living in a day where our adversary
[12:52] choose to consume us,
[12:55] but he cannot.
[12:58] If he had the leeway, perhaps he could
[13:02] do it, but he cannot.
[13:04] Amen.
[13:05] Why? Because it's not the way the
[13:07] scriptures are written.
[13:08] Amen.
[13:10] The Bible says that not only did God put
[13:13] our names in the lamb's book of life,
[13:16] but the word of God also tells us, amen,
[13:19] that he engraved us in the palm of his
[13:22] hands.
[13:24] We find out that we can be no more lost
[13:27] than Jesus himself.
[13:29] Amen.
[13:30] Come on, somebody. So, we don't have
[13:34] no one to fear.
[13:35] Amen.
[13:36] Nothing to fear.
[13:38] Amen. As we said this morning, even
[13:41] though when we were preaching, we want
[13:43] you to understand, yes, you and I must
[13:46] live a godly life. Yes, you and I, Amen,
[13:50] must do inventory every day, almost all
[13:53] day, searching yourself, making sure
[13:56] that you're standing within the faith.
[13:59] Is that right?
[14:01] Cuz you want to make sure you kept under
[14:03] the blood.
[14:05] Now, as I said, this thing when God
[14:09] comes along, he does something. And it's
[14:12] amazing how God hides himself in the
[14:16] thunders.
[14:18] Because you got to realize, Amen. When
[14:20] God come down in Israel and he thundered
[14:23] from the mountain, they wanted him to
[14:26] shut up. The natural ear could not hear
[14:30] the voice of God. It was fearful. It was
[14:33] it was terrible. It was It scared him so
[14:36] bad. They said, "Moses, just tell him
[14:39] don't tell don't speak no more. From now
[14:41] on, we'll listen to you." Think about
[14:43] it. Then God comes along and another
[14:47] thunder comes around and and and here is
[14:50] it was you know at the uh uh baptism of
[14:54] Jesus Christ when God spoke some even
[14:57] said then it thundered.
[14:59] Right? Amen. So we realize by the grace
[15:02] of God, God voice is a thunder.
[15:05] Oh my.
[15:06] Hallelujah. Amen. So we realize, Amen,
[15:09] here it comes again. Amen. That that God
[15:12] comes around and there's a man by the
[15:14] name of Paul on his way to persecute the
[15:16] church. Amen. Here the Bible said a
[15:19] sound from heaven came and the men
[15:21] thought it thundered.
[15:22] They couldn't understand the voice of
[15:24] God. They couldn't.
[15:26] But guess what? There was an elected
[15:28] one. There was one by the name of Saul
[15:32] who God changed his name to Paul. Amen.
[15:34] Because he could hear the voice of God.
[15:39] Can't you hear the voice of God?
[15:41] That means you are chosen and elected.
[15:44] Amen. In this day to be able to hear the
[15:47] voice of God.
[15:49] Blessed is the man who heareth my
[15:51] sayings.
[15:55] Amen.
[15:57] So you say, "Well, why would you say
[15:59] that?" Because remember, Amen. Israel
[16:02] had gone through a lot of things in the
[16:06] desert. We realized that God came and he
[16:09] tried them. Is that right? He said, "I
[16:11] tried you in the wilderness for 40
[16:13] years. I tried you so that you could see
[16:16] what was in your heart." Hello. I'm so
[16:20] glad God just don't take me off the
[16:22] earth
[16:23] without showing me what's in my heart.
[16:26] Every man,
[16:28] every woman knows what's in their heart.
[16:31] Every now and again, you'll have
[16:33] something pop up that you didn't know
[16:34] was there.
[16:36] But if you search it out, you can find
[16:38] its origin when it got there.
[16:42] Amen. But it takes the Holy Spirit to go
[16:45] in and search that out in your heart.
[16:49] Amen. So that you can understand.
[16:51] Listen, I don't I don't know. I I I want
[16:53] my sins, Amen. to go before me.
[16:57] I don't want nothing catching me
[16:58] catching up with me at the at the River
[17:00] Jordan.
[17:02] Y'all know what I mean? I don't want
[17:04] nothing Amen. unconfessed. I don't want
[17:07] nothing un I want all my sins before me.
[17:11] No matter what you think about me, no
[17:13] matter what anybody else thinks about
[17:15] me, I need all of this to be out.
[17:20] Hallelujah.
[17:21] That is the day we're living in. We're
[17:23] living in a a day where the bride is
[17:25] made herself ready.
[17:28] Amen.
[17:29] Why didn't the Bible say God made her
[17:31] ready?
[17:32] No. See, there's a balance to it.
[17:35] The bride makes herself ready.
[17:38] She's got all the equipment she needs to
[17:40] wash and to cleanse herself with.
[17:43] Hallelujah.
[17:46] And it's by the washing of the water of
[17:48] the word. Is that right? is by God
[17:50] washing you and washing you on a daily
[17:53] basis. Come on, somebody. Not every
[17:55] other day when you come Wednesdays and
[17:57] Sundays and No, it's every day.
[18:00] Amen.
[18:01] At least that's the way it's supposed to
[18:02] be.
[18:04] Psalms 81:7, thou calleth in trouble,
[18:06] and I deliver thee. This is one of my
[18:08] favorite. I answer thee in the secret
[18:10] place of thunder.
[18:13] See, because when you say, well, God
[18:15] answers me in the secret place of
[18:16] thunder. Where is this thundering?
[18:18] Hallelujah. It's on the inside.
[18:21] Hallelujah. But if you can realize that
[18:23] this message is really the seven
[18:26] thunders.
[18:27] It's really Christ.
[18:29] Amen.
[18:30] Like I said, they say, "Oh, you
[18:32] following Brother Brandon? How can I
[18:33] follow Brother Brandaman? He wasn't here
[18:35] when I got here."
[18:38] I'm following the God that was in
[18:40] Brother Brandham.
[18:43] Amen.
[18:44] Huh? Those thunders of Christ is the
[18:47] voice of God in each age
[18:50] thundering out to the people showing
[18:52] them when nobody else could hear it.
[18:55] Showing them the secrets of the age and
[18:58] what they needed to do to escape that
[19:01] age.
[19:03] Huh?
[19:04] God coming. It ain't no great mystery
[19:06] like people make it all puffed up.
[19:08] Brother Bham said there was one thunder
[19:11] but in that one there were seven.
[19:14] Amen.
[19:15] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. And that
[19:18] thunder, listen, it shook heaven and
[19:20] earth.
[19:20] Amen.
[19:22] But in that, we now look and we see like
[19:25] like the brother brother said, it ain't
[19:27] the seven angels we're worshiping.
[19:31] No, sir. It's the God of the seven
[19:33] angels.
[19:35] Those seven angels was just the clothing
[19:37] of the invisible God.
[19:43] And we ought to be a happy camper.
[19:45] We ought to be so stirred up right now
[19:48] that even in the midst of Oh, listen.
[19:50] Come on, somebody. I I don't know what
[19:52] it is to bring a baby on the scene. But
[19:55] I I know when that doctor I watch my
[19:58] daughters, I watch my wife when they
[20:00] say, "Oh, this is a real thing now.
[20:03] This is not false labor. This is real."
[20:06] There's such a joy that overwhelms them.
[20:11] Even though they're getting ready to go
[20:13] through pain and sorrow, they're glad
[20:16] they now have come to the end of this
[20:18] thing. And they know in a little while
[20:21] it'll all be over.
[20:23] Sisters, y'all know. Can I get an amen?
[20:27] They have carried this baby for nine
[20:29] months,
[20:31] and it may not seem like a long time to
[20:33] you, but I can't imagine it, brethren,
[20:36] what that would be like.
[20:41] Amen. But at the end, you know that you
[20:44] know that's right normally starts around
[20:46] the seventh month. They getting they get
[20:48] a little impatient.
[20:51] They know they got a due date, but they
[20:53] thinking, "Oh, if this baby could come
[20:54] at least two weeks early. They want to
[20:57] have this child. Why? Not only because
[21:00] of the joy that is going to bring, but
[21:03] now it's a burden."
[21:06] Come on, somebody.
[21:07] Amen. And that's the way it is with the
[21:10] true believer. You carried Christ, but
[21:13] now it's becoming a burden. I want to
[21:15] see him. I want to see the full
[21:17] manifestation of what I'm carrying.
[21:20] Amen.
[21:21] Hallelujah.
[21:22] Come on, somebody. And the first thing
[21:24] it is when that baby is born, you know
[21:26] what you're looking at. You glad he's
[21:28] healthy, but you're seeing who he looks
[21:30] like.
[21:32] You want to see who he looks like. Amen.
[21:35] And that's how it is. We're looking at
[21:37] this thing. who says, "Lord, we're
[21:38] pressing now. We're in birth pains. We
[21:41] come to this time and right now we've
[21:43] got to keep pushing."
[21:45] Amen.
[21:45] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[21:47] Amen.
[21:47] You going to Cuz I'm going to tell you
[21:48] something. Whether you push or not, the
[21:50] contractions coming.
[21:52] Amen.
[21:53] Amen.
[21:54] Huh? That squeeze is on you right now.
[21:58] And you you you you're feeling
[21:59] uncomfortable. You're feeling the pain.
[22:02] You're feeling your suffering. But you
[22:03] know that this suffering what it's going
[22:06] to bring you are right now bringing
[22:09] forth. Amen. And birthing Jesus Christ
[22:12] himself all over again.
[22:16] Oh help us Lord. What is it? The world
[22:19] don't see it and we don't understand it.
[22:21] Do do we see this?
[22:23] Don't you see? There are two women that
[22:25] are that's impregnated.
[22:27] Satan has a wife
[22:28] just like Jesus Christ got one. That's
[22:31] brother Bham. He said, "That's right."
[22:33] He said, "And they both impregnated.
[22:36] They both are carrying seed.
[22:38] One is carrying the seed of God and the
[22:41] other one is carrying the seed of the
[22:43] devil."
[22:43] Amen.
[22:45] Oh yeah.
[22:47] And that denominational system is
[22:49] getting ready to bring forth its child.
[22:51] So you So what's happening to the bride?
[22:54] Hallelujah.
[22:56] We're getting ready to see Christ in his
[22:59] full manifestation.
[23:01] No more struggling.
[23:02] Hallelujah.
[23:04] Amen.
[23:04] It'll be Christ in you,
[23:07] the hope of glory, living his life
[23:09] through you and I. You and me. Is that
[23:12] all right?
[23:13] Now,
[23:15] we look at this thing. And so, you say,
[23:17] "Well, Brother Brooks, uh, as we were
[23:20] saying, you and I, we're the only light
[23:22] in this world. Can't you see why God got
[23:26] us dressing and looking the way we look?
[23:29] go out there in the world and see those
[23:31] hideous sights out there. They don't
[23:33] even look human no more.
[23:36] They don't. But you look so human and so
[23:40] you look so human till people look at
[23:42] you strangely.
[23:46] And that's God's contrast.
[23:48] Yeah. Amen.
[23:49] You are the light of the world.
[23:54] You are Oh, if we can get y'all to see
[23:56] that. Not just a church member, not just
[23:59] a member of higher ground tabernacle.
[24:02] You are the light of the world. God made
[24:04] you that way.
[24:08] Locked into the scriptures. I love that.
[24:11] The secret of place of the thunders. We
[24:13] didn't even realize. Amen. That in those
[24:16] thunders, Amen. seven church ages were
[24:18] sounded and every church age had a
[24:21] virtue to achieve.
[24:23] Amen.
[24:23] Hello. Amen.
[24:25] We didn't understand that in those
[24:26] thunders were echoing the very life of
[24:29] Christ, what he did through the seven
[24:31] church ages. And now you and I have come
[24:34] to a place where God wants to fill us
[24:37] with all of that.
[24:39] So we'll never fall nor be barren or
[24:42] unfruitful. Now I don't know about you,
[24:45] but that's what I want.
[24:46] I want all of that. Whatever I like, I
[24:50] want it. Amen.
[24:53] Hello. You know, we tired of just being
[24:56] human when we are sons and daughters of
[24:58] God.
[25:00] The Bible said we are a new creation.
[25:02] Come on, somebody. We may have been born
[25:04] a man. But when you're born of the Holy
[25:08] Spirit, you're born of God, which makes
[25:10] you nothing less than a God.
[25:12] Amen.
[25:13] Born of his spirit.
[25:15] Amen.
[25:16] Flesh and blood of the Lord Jesus
[25:18] Christ.
[25:20] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody.
[25:22] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[25:25] When we look at this and we understand,
[25:27] amen, that the trials are going to come,
[25:30] it's not going to get easier. See, and I
[25:33] don't I I don't want to paint a picture
[25:35] like, you know, we going to we we're
[25:36] going to paint this picture, you know,
[25:38] of uh prosperity. You know, some of us
[25:41] might prosper and and it's in the will
[25:43] of God that we would as our soul
[25:45] prosper. But I don't want you to look at
[25:47] the prosperity until after your soul has
[25:50] prospered.
[25:52] Once your soul has achieved that place
[25:55] where God wants you to be. Amen. You can
[25:57] ask God whatever and he'll grant it to
[25:59] you.
[26:02] Oh God, help us Lord. In that secret
[26:04] place,
[26:05] tell me this place is not secret. Not
[26:08] this place. I'm talking about this
[26:10] message.
[26:11] This message still is a secret
[26:13] because people are fighting it. People
[26:16] are denying it. Why? Because their eyes
[26:19] have not been open to it. They can't see
[26:22] it. And when you can't see something
[26:24] that's right there, it's a secret.
[26:29] Am I making sense?
[26:30] Like I said this morning. Amen. The
[26:33] Bible said if it was possible to fool
[26:35] the very elected, he said, "But it's not
[26:37] possible." You're locked into that
[26:39] scripture. That's the only reason why
[26:41] you and I cannot be deceived is because
[26:43] God determined in this age that you
[26:46] would not be.
[26:47] Amen.
[26:48] Now, my thing is if you're not deceived,
[26:51] then what does that make you?
[26:54] Because the Bible says, Amen. All whose
[26:58] names who are not written in the Lamb's
[27:01] book of life would be deceived.
[27:05] Amen.
[27:05] And if you're not deceived, that means
[27:08] your name
[27:09] Amen.
[27:11] Oh, if I could tell you, if I could let
[27:14] you I wish I could I wish I could give
[27:17] you revelation cuz I know what I'm
[27:19] saying. I just can't get it out. But
[27:21] when you're when you can really see and
[27:23] you know that you're not deceived. You
[27:26] listen, like I said, you are conscious
[27:28] of God's presence. You're conscious of
[27:30] him. You You're not looking for him
[27:32] every day. You know he's with you every
[27:34] day. All day. Oh, come on. You're
[27:38] conscious of him every day. There's so
[27:39] many people don't even know God lives.
[27:45] Don't even know he God's live that God
[27:47] lives.
[27:48] Hallelujah. God built us to have
[27:50] fellowship with him. Is that right?
[27:52] And that's what we're doing now. We're
[27:53] fellowshipping.
[27:55] Hallelujah. Glory to God. the the the
[27:58] the the the thing that we and I you and
[28:00] I must be careful of because we're
[28:02] living in the day according to Matthew
[28:04] 24:12 where the love of many shall wax
[28:07] cold.
[28:08] And you heard me talk about this a
[28:10] couple of weeks ago. Satan just blowing
[28:12] that wind,
[28:14] hard trials,
[28:16] people disappointing you, just blowing
[28:18] on you. And that whole purpose of that
[28:20] is to make you cold,
[28:23] you know, taking all your affection away
[28:26] from you. All right.
[28:28] Pray into a place, amen, that you don't
[28:30] trust anyone.
[28:33] Well, you know, the Bible said, "Don't
[28:34] put your trust in no man, but if you can
[28:35] trust God."
[28:38] Is that right? Listen, that's what Paul
[28:40] said. Follow me as I follow Christ.
[28:42] Amen.
[28:42] You can't follow somebody if you not
[28:44] trusted him.
[28:46] See, but you got to realize it's the God
[28:48] in him that you trust,
[28:51] not the flesh of a man. You know, so
[28:53] we're looking at this day where Satan is
[28:55] trying to sap the joy of salvation out
[28:58] of you.
[28:59] As we said, not that you can lose your
[29:01] salvation, cuz if you really got it, you
[29:03] can never lose it.
[29:05] But Satan can take your joy
[29:08] away from you and make it so hard. Amen.
[29:12] Just to come to church and just, you
[29:14] know, see that's your joy that's gone.
[29:17] Cuz I can remember the time. Amen.
[29:19] People were excited to go to church.
[29:22] Why? They had that had that joy still.
[29:24] But this is the age. And Satan just
[29:27] don't snatch it all at one time. He
[29:29] slowly creeps.
[29:31] He slowly moves upon you. Little by
[29:33] little, inch by inch. Amen. Taking it
[29:36] away from you. And you have no idea
[29:38] until it's gone.
[29:41] The love of many wax cold. Why? The
[29:43] Bible said because iniquities,
[29:46] iniquities,
[29:47] Christians seeing Christians do things
[29:49] that they shouldn't do.
[29:51] Christians who offend and won't make it
[29:53] right. You know, all kinds of little
[29:56] things. Those are just things that Satan
[29:58] uses. Amen. To just work on you, work
[30:01] on. And you know, one of the things we
[30:03] ought to we love to say because of our
[30:05] own pride or we don't want to confront
[30:07] anybody. Oh, it's all right.
[30:11] It's going to be okay.
[30:13] Oh, that's not bothering me. How do you
[30:15] know it's bothering you when you tell
[30:17] somebody else?
[30:19] Y'all hear what I'm saying? If you got
[30:21] to tell somebody something that's
[30:23] bothering you, it's bothering you.
[30:27] So, let's move on by the grace of God.
[30:28] That's not the emphasis. My my thing is
[30:31] this. We're living in a time, and you've
[30:33] heard me say this many times before. In
[30:35] 1962, Brother Brandham said, "Five stars
[30:38] align themselves." He said that was the
[30:40] birth of an infant church, a bride,
[30:43] 1962.
[30:46] He said heaven announced her coming.
[30:49] Hello. And he compared it to the birth
[30:52] of Jesus. He compared it, Amen. to Moses
[30:55] birth. All of those great men of God. He
[30:58] compared it to Jesus' birth when the
[31:01] three stars line together and made one.
[31:04] And here he says, "Now the bride is on
[31:07] the scene, right?" Because remember,
[31:10] she's already smitten out in 1957.
[31:15] Try and the nomination didn't want
[31:18] anything to do with the message. During
[31:20] that time,
[31:21] they had already ousted Jesus. They were
[31:24] fulfilling Revelations 3. I stand at the
[31:26] door knocking.
[31:28] Amen.
[31:28] If any man would open unto me, I would
[31:30] come into him and suck. It was during
[31:33] that time they had put Jesus Christ out
[31:36] the church and the woman Miss Leodia was
[31:39] ruling it.
[31:40] Amen.
[31:41] Am I making sense?
[31:42] So I'm saying from 62 to now, how many
[31:45] years it is and how many years it's
[31:48] going to take for this bride to mature?
[31:54] But it'll be a paradox.
[31:57] We've got to this this spirit is such a
[31:58] a age. This age is a is a spirit of
[32:01] laziness.
[32:03] But God know how to get it done.
[32:06] He said it's going to be a paradox.
[32:09] But he knows he knew how to put them
[32:10] Jews together, didn't he?
[32:12] Oh my. He put Stalin here, Hitler there,
[32:15] Ikeman on the other end, and they came
[32:17] together.
[32:18] Amen.
[32:20] God knows how to bring this little bride
[32:22] together.
[32:22] Amen.
[32:23] Come on, somebody.
[32:24] Amen. Now, you know, it's just it's just
[32:26] like some of the things, and some of
[32:28] y'all may have heard what Donnie Reagan
[32:29] is going through, and it's really really
[32:31] bad. But I'm going to tell you
[32:32] something. I'll stand with him.
[32:36] I'll stand with him. Why? Because we
[32:39] believe the same.
[32:40] Amen.
[32:42] There might be little things. Amen. I
[32:43] don't know what all he preaches, but I
[32:45] know he's a true man of God, and I know
[32:48] he's one of them.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:50] Hello, somebody. Oh, yes.
[32:54] You look at those things and and I'm
[32:56] going to tell you something. If I don't
[32:58] care what their doctrine is, I stand
[33:00] with them because they seeing the same
[33:03] thing. They seeing Jesus Christ the same
[33:06] yesterday, today, and forever.
[33:07] They might have a little twist, a little
[33:09] something because their eyes may not be
[33:11] 2020. I don't know. But at the same
[33:14] time, I know if they believe in this
[33:16] message, they're taking a stand against
[33:19] this adulterous generation and that old
[33:22] wicked Jezebel system.
[33:24] Amen.
[33:25] Hallelujah.
[33:27] Cuz brother said it like this. He said
[33:29] that squeeze will make us drop all our
[33:31] differences.
[33:33] You're going to be so glad to see one
[33:35] another a real Christian. You won't even
[33:37] ask him where do you belong,
[33:39] what church you go to.
[33:41] Amen. Cuz listen, you won't have one.
[33:44] They done put you out. There's no
[33:46] buildings.
[33:49] Brother say he they kill you.
[33:52] Kill you because you prayed for
[33:54] somebody. You're not part of the system.
[33:56] You don't have a right to pray. You
[33:58] don't have your degree in theology. You
[34:00] don't have a right to pray. You're not
[34:02] ordained of God. I wonder what they
[34:04] would have said to Jesus.
[34:08] H. So, we're living in the last days.
[34:10] Did you believe that?
[34:13] Listen, we we come and we hear wars and
[34:17] rumors of wars and and now America and
[34:20] all, you know, Putin and and and and the
[34:22] Ukrainians and and all of them fussing
[34:25] and fighting and and hear our country
[34:27] telling telling Russia, don't you know,
[34:29] whatever you doing, you better back it
[34:30] up.
[34:32] Get up out of there. Don't you mess with
[34:34] the Ukrainians. Oh my. You you can't
[34:37] Can't you see God setting the stage?
[34:40] Amen.
[34:42] God setting the stage for what? For this
[34:45] prophecy to be fulfilled. He said, "I
[34:48] turned around and all I could see was
[34:51] smaltering ash."
[34:55] And where did he say it came from?
[34:57] Russia. Now, what gets me is because the
[35:00] whole world think, "Oh, America so
[35:03] wicked. America so evil." Hello.
[35:06] Judgment struck the West Coast. It was
[35:08] judging not just uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[35:12] Los Angeles. He was judging the whole
[35:14] world because the gospel had already
[35:16] traveled from the east to the west.
[35:18] Amen.
[35:20] Amen.
[35:20] The whole world is suffering because
[35:22] they turned down Jesus Christ
[35:24] in our day.
[35:25] Amen.
[35:26] Floods and tornadoes, tsunamis. We've
[35:29] never heard of such hurricanes a mile or
[35:32] two miles wide. How you going to run
[35:33] from that?
[35:34] Amen.
[35:38] Hallelujah.
[35:39] People, you know, they don't forgot they
[35:41] went down there. Amen. God sent down all
[35:43] those that hurricane down there and and
[35:45] almost wiped out Louisiana and and they
[35:48] still as soon as they could possibly put
[35:50] the Marty Gro back in into function,
[35:53] they raised it back up. Devils.
[35:57] Truly devils. It's like Solomon Gomorra
[36:00] waking up and said, "Let's do it again."
[36:04] And that's what America is doing. Amen.
[36:07] It's what we see people, you know, a lot
[36:10] of time, I'm going to tell you
[36:11] something. Sodom, it it's it's it
[36:13] consists of all kind of perversion.
[36:17] Hello, y'all getting quiet on me now.
[36:19] But all of us were sodomites until we
[36:21] got saved.
[36:25] Hello. You were perverted.
[36:28] You were doing unnatural things.
[36:32] And that's what Solomon was good there
[36:34] for.
[36:37] It ain't just one group. The whole world
[36:38] was that way. Hey, y'all know y'all
[36:41] y'all looking at me like I'm crazy, but
[36:43] I know what I'm talking about.
[36:47] That's why I always tell people, you
[36:48] don't want to appear before God without
[36:50] the blood of Jesus Christ covering you.
[36:54] Can you imagine what that would be like?
[36:56] All your sins on display, no place to
[36:59] hide.
[37:01] But don't you worry about it. You won't
[37:03] be the only one in the group.
[37:06] There'll be a lot more. Plenty of
[37:08] people. Amen. With their lives
[37:10] everywhere. That's why I say it. It
[37:12] Thank God for the blood
[37:14] that washes away all my sins.
[37:18] Cleanseth me. Amen. From all my
[37:20] iniquity. Think about it.
[37:24] No other message can cleanse you.
[37:27] Amen.
[37:28] You say, "Well, praise God. We got the
[37:29] word." But let me tell you something.
[37:31] This might be the word for your day.
[37:33] Nah. Yes. See, see. See, that's what
[37:36] people don't understand. They get
[37:37] nervous when you say that, but it's
[37:38] true. The only persons that were saved
[37:41] in Noah's day was those who bore Noah's
[37:43] up. The only ones that came and were
[37:46] saved uh uh uh in in in in in the time
[37:49] of Israel were those who followed Joshua
[37:52] or Moses, however you want to put it. Is
[37:54] that right? Truly follow with their
[37:56] whole heart.
[37:57] Amen.
[37:58] Amen.
[38:01] So the blood on the doorpost and the
[38:03] lint. Now I'm I'm saying something here
[38:06] because I want you to understand God
[38:08] made promises and we holding to those
[38:10] promises. God told Abraham, he said,
[38:12] "Listen," he said, "you going to have a
[38:14] son in your old age." Abraham laughed.
[38:16] Sarah laughed. But did it stop God's
[38:19] promise? They were locked in there.
[38:21] There was no way to get out of it. God
[38:23] has spoken and it shall be.
[38:26] Hello. Listen people, you might say,
[38:28] "Well, brother Brooks, just what I got.
[38:29] I've got just a little bit of light on
[38:31] the inside." Don't you know that's
[38:32] enough to conquer?
[38:34] A little bit of light conquers. I don't
[38:36] care how dense the darkness is. Darkness
[38:39] can never overcome light.
[38:41] Amen.
[38:43] Hello.
[38:46] We don't know how small that pillar of
[38:48] fire started out.
[38:50] But let's suppose it was that small
[38:54] that proceeded out of the presence of
[38:56] God. Right? Look what it done. Well,
[38:58] look what it created.
[39:01] Look what that little light created. And
[39:04] you are a product of what the little
[39:06] light said, let there be.
[39:09] Amen.
[39:10] Now, if that little light can create all
[39:12] of this, what can that little light find
[39:15] in you?
[39:16] I don't care whatever darkness it is.
[39:18] It's an investigator.
[39:20] It's the true FBI.
[39:23] It'll go right into the death of your
[39:25] soul. Identify that demon and put him in
[39:27] prison.
[39:28] Lock him up.
[39:31] See, he is the true God. And you and I
[39:34] don't have to worry about Amen. Ah, see,
[39:37] because worrying is not an attribute
[39:39] anyway.
[39:41] Only faith. Faith in God. Faith in what
[39:44] he's done for you. Do we have it? Do we
[39:46] have it? Listen, I may not be doing all
[39:48] that I'm supposed to do, but he did it
[39:50] for me.
[39:51] My faith is in my sacrifice. My faith is
[39:54] in Jesus Christ's perfection and not my
[39:56] own.
[39:57] Hallelujah. He is faithful to complete
[40:00] that which he has begun in you and I.
[40:03] And I'm trusting that.
[40:05] Hallelujah.
[40:06] I don't have nothing else to look
[40:07] forward to.
[40:09] Come on, somebody. Like I was telling
[40:11] somebody the other day, don't you
[40:12] realize I think about dying every day?
[40:16] You know, not that I'm afraid of it, but
[40:17] I just want to be right.
[40:21] I don't want nothing tagged to be. Huh?
[40:24] And when you you know, I I'm not I'm not
[40:27] I'm not the elder in here, but when you
[40:29] start getting into your 50s, you can say
[40:32] I'm young and I'm young and I'm young
[40:33] all you want to, but your body is going
[40:35] to tell you something different
[40:38] inside you. just as young as you ever
[40:40] been. But your body still is is going to
[40:43] dictate to you what you can do and what
[40:45] you can't do. Right? I tried to override
[40:48] my body. I'm going to play this
[40:50] basketball and every time I play, I get
[40:53] hurt.
[40:57] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Rich said,
[40:59] "What point in time you going to know?
[41:03] You going to catch what God trying to
[41:05] tell you.
[41:09] I said, "Brother, that's so true.
[41:12] That is so true." I said, "What I got
[41:14] left, I won't put on reserve."
[41:18] Hallelujah. We'll hold this thing down
[41:20] till Jesus come. Come on, somebody. See,
[41:23] because that body has a has a germ of
[41:26] death in it.
[41:29] Your soul is new.
[41:30] Amen.
[41:31] Fresh.
[41:32] Hallelujah.
[41:33] Amen. And one of these old days, that
[41:36] soul is going to get tired of this old
[41:37] nasty mean flesh and say, "Straighten
[41:40] up."
[41:41] Amen.
[41:43] And we'll be changed
[41:44] from this old vile mortal body
[41:47] into mortality.
[41:49] I believe that. I believe the voice will
[41:51] speak from the inside.
[41:54] Cuz that's where he'll be.
[41:59] Oh yes, we hear a voice coming from
[42:01] heaven. But didn't Jesus do what? He
[42:04] heard the voice too coming from heaven.
[42:06] But where was the voice? This is my
[42:08] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased to
[42:10] dwell in. He was already in there.
[42:13] Amen.
[42:16] Already inside.
[42:19] Is that right? The change is from inside
[42:21] out.
[42:23] Help me, Lord. Help me.
[42:26] Can I go just a little further before
[42:28] going into communion? Amen. And I want
[42:30] you to know the Bible says now here
[42:32] here's where I'm working with. The Bible
[42:34] said, "For all nations shall rise
[42:36] against nation, kingdom against kingdom,
[42:40] and there shall be earthquakes in
[42:42] diverse places, and there shall be
[42:44] famine and troubles. These are the
[42:46] beginning of sorrows." Now, that was in
[42:49] 1962. Brother Brandham comes in the end
[42:51] time sign seed.
[42:54] [Music]
[42:56] He said this is the time seed is being
[43:00] produced. This is our our fertilized uh
[43:05] uh fertile ground. This is the ground
[43:07] that will cause us to grow when there's
[43:10] nation rising against nations
[43:13] and when kingdom is against kingdom and
[43:15] when earthquakes is in diverse places
[43:17] and famines and troubles. He basically
[43:20] this is the end time seed sign to you so
[43:23] you can know this is time to get up out
[43:25] of here.
[43:26] Amen.
[43:26] There's no time to waste. Come on.
[43:28] Amen.
[43:29] Amen.
[43:31] Zechariah I believe it says when the
[43:32] vision is made clear, let him that read
[43:35] it run.
[43:36] Amen.
[43:37] Huh? You got to run.
[43:39] Amen.
[43:39] He said that vision he said don't it t
[43:42] when it comes it will not wait on any
[43:44] one of us.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:47] He can't wait on you. Oh Lord, I'm
[43:49] coming.
[43:51] Luke 21:19. And I'm going to close on
[43:53] this. I just want to encourage you. I
[43:56] want you to understand, Amen. by the
[43:58] grace of God that you're living in a
[44:00] time of the secrets of the thunders.
[44:03] [Music]
[44:05] Huh? The secret of the thunders. God
[44:08] coming into you living its life. That's
[44:11] right. What brother said. He said, he
[44:13] said God wants you to live th those
[44:16] seven live lives.
[44:17] Those seven lives, those seven thunders.
[44:20] It's only one life, but he wants those
[44:22] seven lives to be lived,
[44:24] right? That patience, that
[44:25] longsuffering, that godliness, that
[44:27] brotherly kindness. It's not enough to
[44:29] say, "I got it." He wants it to live. It
[44:32] must be on display.
[44:34] Amen.
[44:37] That was enough just to shout about.
[44:39] Hallelujah.
[44:41] Amen.
[44:45] He goes on in in Luke 21:19.
[44:48] He goes on and says, "But when you see
[44:50] the commotions, uh, and he says, "In
[44:52] your patience, possess you your soul."
[44:55] The 21st chapter, beginning at the 9th
[44:56] verses, but when you shall hear wars and
[44:59] commotions, be not terrified, but these
[45:01] things must first come to pass, but the
[45:03] end is not by and by. Then said he unto
[45:07] them, "Nation shall rise up against
[45:09] nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and
[45:11] earthquake shall be in diverse places,
[45:13] and famines, and pestilence, and fearful
[45:14] sights, and great signs shall there be
[45:17] from heaven." And how many signs have we
[45:20] seen? Come on, somebody. Numerous signs.
[45:23] I mean, even so, God didn't even tell us
[45:25] how the telescopes that that scope out
[45:28] there in the in in the universe is
[45:29] taking all these kind of pictures and
[45:31] you're seeing the cross of Christ and
[45:33] you're seeing all kinds of things that
[45:34] comes right back to the Bible. Amen.
[45:36] They call him this nebula and this
[45:39] galaxy and this that. Amen. But all it
[45:41] does is bear witness that Jesus Christ
[45:44] is God.
[45:45] Amen.
[45:47] Then they came I forgot what they call
[45:48] that one with the allsee and eye. That
[45:51] is powerful.
[45:53] Hey, somebody. And God vindicates these
[45:56] things into heaven to let you know
[45:58] they're there. I am the one that created
[46:00] all things.
[46:01] Amen.
[46:02] Thank you, Lord.
[46:04] Hallelujah. Just trying to get people to
[46:06] repent even by way of science, but they
[46:09] won't do it.
[46:11] And the great earthquake shall be dished
[46:12] places and family and pestilence,
[46:14] fearful sights, and great signs shall be
[46:15] there. There be from heaven. But before
[46:18] all these they they shall lay hands on
[46:21] you and persecute you, delivering you up
[46:23] into the synagogue and into prisons and
[46:25] being brought before kings and rulers of
[46:27] my name's sake. Now, you know, the
[46:29] prophet of God tells us that, you know,
[46:31] they'll hunt us down like dogs.
[46:34] Right? Listen, they won't need no chip.
[46:36] Your body gives off enough heat for them
[46:38] to catch it.
[46:40] Right? I mean, you know, you think about
[46:42] where can I hide? Where can I run? There
[46:45] is no place. The only safe zone is in
[46:47] the word of God.
[46:50] In the word of God. Now, my question is,
[46:54] we're going to have to be so yielded to
[46:55] God. So yielded if God says, "Go pray
[46:59] for that man and you know you're going
[47:01] to be thrown in jail. You got to go pray
[47:04] for that man."
[47:06] We got to be so yielded that we're not
[47:08] afraid of what Satan can do. The Bible
[47:12] said, "Don't even fear man or fear the
[47:14] one that can destroy the body, but fear
[47:17] him who can destroy the body and the
[47:19] soul
[47:19] and then cast it into hell."
[47:22] See, that's where I we fear God, not
[47:26] man.
[47:26] Amen.
[47:28] Right? He says, "Settle it. Settle it
[47:32] therefore in your hearts not to meditate
[47:35] before what you shall answer." I love
[47:38] this. But I will give you a mouth and
[47:41] wisdom which all your adversaries shall
[47:44] not be able to gain, say, nor resist.
[47:48] Come on, somebody. They take my Bible.
[47:50] They take my recorder. They take my
[47:52] computer. I can't hear the message, but
[47:54] I got it on the inside.
[47:57] Hallelujah. Why? Because the bride
[48:00] becomes the message.
[48:02] Amen.
[48:02] Is that right? Brother Brandham says she
[48:04] is the fourth personage of Jesus Christ.
[48:11] Hallelujah.
[48:12] Smoke on that one. Chew on it is what I
[48:14] meant.
[48:17] Hallelujah.
[48:20] Amen. That's good. Hallelujah. That's
[48:23] wonderful.
[48:26] That you can see that God personage.
[48:29] That means you don't have a personality
[48:31] but he is.
[48:33] Amen.
[48:34] Oh, God ain't schizophrenic. He want one
[48:37] personality in you.
[48:40] Oh, help us, Lord.
[48:43] Think on it. Think on it. Right. And he
[48:45] shall he and ye shall be betrayed both
[48:48] by parents and brethrens, kin folks,
[48:51] friends, and some of you shall they
[48:53] cause to be put to death. Oh, it can't
[48:56] be. Yeah, it is.
[48:58] It's happening right now. Amen.
[49:00] Think about the families that have been
[49:02] broken up because some don't believe in
[49:04] the message anymore and some do.
[49:06] When that time come, you say, "What do
[49:08] you mean?" Those people that's gone will
[49:10] has been given over to a strong delusion
[49:13] to to to believe a lie. So, they'll
[49:15] never come to this truth again. Brother
[49:17] Brand like this. He said they're born in
[49:20] their ear and they'll never be able to
[49:22] hear the gospel again.
[49:25] So they aren't right becomes your enemy.
[49:28] Believing that they are right.
[49:32] You're the ones that's crazy.
[49:38] See, a lot of us, we don't realize what
[49:40] we're getting ready to face, but this
[49:42] thing don't really become painful till
[49:43] it comes to your own house.
[49:46] You can deal with sinners and nextoor
[49:48] neighbors, right? But when it's from
[49:50] your own house, Jesus, where did you get
[49:52] these scars?
[49:54] in the house of my friends. See what I'm
[49:56] saying? It was his own people. The Bible
[49:58] said he came to his own and they
[50:00] received him not. Right? They refused
[50:02] him. Thank God
[50:04] because they refused him and gave us
[50:06] space to come in.
[50:08] Hallelujah. Thank God for the wisdom of
[50:10] God. Amen. So don't be afraid. Uh you
[50:13] know, and I'm going to tell you
[50:14] something. You say, "Well, brother
[50:15] Brooks, you know, my family member,
[50:16] they've been telling lies on me." That's
[50:18] what they anointed to do.
[50:22] They anointed to tell lies on you. They
[50:24] was anointed to tell lies on Jesus.
[50:28] Don't get discouraged. That's glorious.
[50:31] The Bible said if you suffer for the
[50:32] name of Jesus Christ, blessed are you.
[50:35] Blessed. If they can't tell the truth,
[50:37] they got to make up a lie about it.
[50:39] That's real good. That means you're
[50:41] living it right.
[50:47] Jesus. Ah,
[50:50] he said, "When you see Jerusalem compass
[50:52] with armies, then know that the
[50:54] desolation thereof is nigh." Now, come
[50:57] on, somebody. They're everywhere. Is
[50:58] that right? And now everybody focuses on
[51:01] Jerusalem,
[51:03] that little piece of land over there.
[51:05] What? Why are they so afraid of the
[51:07] Jews? You know why? Cuz even the world
[51:09] know the Jews are blessed people. They
[51:11] are the most smartest, most intelligent
[51:13] people I ever known.
[51:17] You know why? Because God made them that
[51:18] way.
[51:19] He said you going to prosper.
[51:21] Wherever you place your feet, you claim
[51:23] it. It's yours. That's still
[51:25] hold.
[51:27] That's still hoes.
[51:29] So those natural Jews, we realize by the
[51:31] grace of God, they got a God. Listen, I
[51:34] their brains look like their brains are
[51:36] made different.
[51:39] I don't know how they do it. I don't
[51:42] know. I just don't know. And I think
[51:44] that's what it is. The world is just
[51:45] jealous of them cuz no matter where you
[51:47] put them, they prosper. They they in
[51:50] Germany, no matter where they are, they
[51:52] come up at the top. So they make fun of
[51:54] them. Say, you know, they make them
[51:56] stingy and tight crooks. But that ain't
[51:59] what it is. They just real businessmen.
[52:03] You see, but that's the lie the devil
[52:05] puts out on them. And they got people
[52:07] right now in the world hating Jews
[52:09] because they feel like the Jews are
[52:11] being unfair to the Palestinians. Hello.
[52:15] There's a man in my house and you want
[52:17] me to be fair with him? He won't get
[52:19] out. That's is my house.
[52:22] That's what they saying. This man done
[52:23] broke in my house and I got to treat him
[52:25] right.
[52:28] See the nonsense. The nonsense. It
[52:30] doesn't make sense
[52:34] because when I was over there in Israel
[52:35] and I'm I'm going to close. They said
[52:37] the Palestines is the same name as the
[52:39] Philistines and that's what they working
[52:41] with.
[52:45] H. We got rights. Rights. You done put
[52:49] up a tent in my backyard,
[52:52] squatting on my land.
[52:54] And you got rights. Yeah, I do, too. I
[52:57] got rights to quick kick you off my
[52:58] land.
[52:59] Amen.
[52:59] That's why I love Israel. Oh, they I
[53:01] love the way they fight. I just love
[53:03] that. I just
[53:04] I love that. They They haven't seen a
[53:06] move of God in a long while.
[53:09] But you know what? That faith is still
[53:11] there. I ain't never seen such faith in
[53:13] my life. Amen. Those people been ran
[53:16] from two true uh two and fro all across
[53:18] the world. Amen. Almost extinguished by
[53:22] by Hitler and starting all the rest of
[53:24] them. And they come back and they
[53:24] worshiping God like ain't nothing
[53:26] happened.
[53:28] With a pure heart, still believing that
[53:30] the Messiah is going to come. And we got
[53:32] people who call themselves Christians
[53:34] falling away like flies, not even
[53:36] believing this gospel no more. But look
[53:39] at the most sturdy Jews.
[53:43] I ain't talking about them renegades.
[53:44] You got renegades everywhere you go. But
[53:46] when you meet a real one, you got a real
[53:48] one.
[53:51] Hallelujah. That's true. Now, I'm going
[53:54] to tell you something and I'm going to
[53:55] close, but I was in the airport one day
[53:57] and there was a Jew and he had one of
[53:58] them little I don't know what's on them
[53:59] little boxes that they put on their head
[54:01] when they get to praying. It looks
[54:03] really funny, but they had that little
[54:05] he had that little box and he had his
[54:06] whatever he's doing and just doing right
[54:08] in the airport. didn't care about what
[54:10] nobody thought. I thought, "Lord, you
[54:12] can't even get a Pentecostal to worship
[54:14] you in the public anymore.
[54:17] This God didn't care. He had on this
[54:19] Jewish com little young fell. I mean, he
[54:22] was just displaying what he had. Didn't
[54:24] care whether Arabs, whoever was there.
[54:27] He was displaying. I wanted to ask him
[54:29] so bad, but I couldn't interrupt him cuz
[54:31] it just looked so good. It just looked
[54:32] nice what he was doing. And I wanted to
[54:34] know what are you doing?" You know, but
[54:37] he didn't care. Yeah, he did what he
[54:39] did. And I mean, he it must have been a
[54:40] whole hour. So, as long as I was there,
[54:42] that man was still doing that in that
[54:44] airport.
[54:47] And I said, we got Christians who won't
[54:50] stand like that in public.
[54:53] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[54:56] May God bless Israel.
[55:00] Oh Lord, here it is. I'm closing and you
[55:03] don't heard this before, but I just kind
[55:04] of threw some things together. You know,
[55:06] I thought to myself, I said, "Well,
[55:08] Lord, you you know, I've what's going
[55:10] on?" So, I kind of put some things
[55:12] together and I thought, "Lord," I said,
[55:14] "We really need an encouragement. What
[55:17] what what we need to see is that we have
[55:20] experienced in our day the appearing of
[55:24] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:28] His appearing. There's nothing left but
[55:31] his coming.
[55:33] We've seen him in the cloud. I don't
[55:35] care what they say about it. But you
[55:38] listen to all these me. I said, "There
[55:39] ain't no way a man can deceive and lie
[55:42] like that." I said, "You hear the heart
[55:44] of brother Brandon when he describing
[55:45] his his experience with the angels and
[55:48] the experience with the blast and the
[55:50] experience. How there there's no lie in
[55:52] that. Anybody that got a true soul can
[55:54] detect that." Amen.
[55:57] And you know the thing that gets me is
[55:59] that here we are under the the umbrella
[56:02] of this beautiful message. I don't know
[56:05] what God is thinking. Thank God for his
[56:08] grace though.
[56:11] Thank God for his grace because we I
[56:13] don't think we appreciate it the way he
[56:16] he desired to see it.
[56:21] Don't get me wrong, he understand the
[56:23] age we're living in too. The revival is
[56:25] over. Brother B said, "We'll be slugging
[56:27] along. We'll be pressing, pushing." You
[56:31] see what I'm saying? So God understand
[56:33] the age. The revival is over. Remember
[56:35] the brother said, "Brother B, why can't
[56:37] I pray like I used to?" You know this.
[56:39] He said, "Because the revival is over."
[56:41] And when you get into a real good prayer
[56:43] channel, you better thank God. You
[56:46] better thank God. Don't ever leave out
[56:48] of it. If you leave out of that real
[56:50] prayer ch channel, it's going to take
[56:52] twice as hard to get back there where
[56:56] you were. Don't let the devil make you
[56:58] move out of that channel. Stay there.
[57:01] Stay there. Now, Hebrews 2:3, and I'm
[57:04] closing uh and we'll start communion.
[57:07] How shall we escape
[57:10] if we neglect so great salvation?
[57:15] If we neglect it, if we don't tend to
[57:17] it, if we don't handle it the way we
[57:20] ought to, how are we going to escape if
[57:23] we neglect this salvation that God has
[57:25] given to us, which at the first began to
[57:28] be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
[57:30] unto us by them that heard him,
[57:34] right? How are we going to escape?
[57:37] Hebrews 12:25, seeing that we refuse not
[57:40] him that speaketh. Well, if they escape
[57:42] not who refuse him that spake on earth,
[57:44] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[57:47] away from him that speaketh from heaven.
[57:52] This ain't no joke. Honestly, I rather
[57:55] be out out in the world as a whoreonger,
[57:57] never be never ever hearing this message
[58:00] than to have heard this message and
[58:02] neglect it.
[58:05] I had rather never ever had a glimpse or
[58:08] a taste of it. Y'all hear what I'm
[58:10] saying? Because to whom much is given,
[58:13] much is required.
[58:15] And you and I can't imagine the souls
[58:18] that are screaming in hell. I think
[58:19] about that. screaming in hell right now
[58:22] who was under the ospice of this
[58:23] message, refused it, rejected or was
[58:26] negligent, knew the truth, was too too
[58:30] lazy to go forward,
[58:35] but sold out like Judas
[58:39] for some natural thing.
[58:42] God have mercy. How many people died
[58:44] with money in their pockets?
[58:47] died in their Cadillacs.
[58:49] Huh? Think about it. How many people you
[58:52] you know it's an illusion that oh like
[58:56] brother said when he was over in Canada
[58:57] and those women half-dressed with drunk
[59:00] and one was a son in school. Whoopee.
[59:02] This is life. He said I couldn't take it
[59:05] no more. He came and he grabbed her by
[59:08] her arm and says honey this is not life.
[59:10] This is death. And in the discernment he
[59:13] discerned she was a Sunday school
[59:14] teaching everything else. And when he
[59:16] told her she was he was a preacher, she
[59:17] tried to run.
[59:19] See what I'm saying? Oh, Lord have
[59:22] mercy. Whoopee. This is life.
[59:26] No. Satan deceived the world. And uh by
[59:30] the grace of God, you're not deceived.
[59:33] Amen.
[59:34] Not because you're so smart and
[59:36] intellectual or whatever the case may
[59:38] be. All
[59:41] of us, the Bible said none of us sought
[59:42] God.
[59:44] He sought us.
[59:46] You might have looked like you was
[59:47] looking for him only because he gave
[59:50] that in you. He put that in your spirit,
[59:52] but that was God drawing you, not you
[59:55] drawing God.
[1:00:00] And I am so grateful to be one in a
[1:00:03] million.
[1:00:08] Amen. We just going to pause.
[1:00:11] Stop preparing for
[1:00:15] communion service. We're glad to have so
[1:00:18] many.
[1:00:20] Amen. Usually it be thinner than this.
[1:00:24] Appreciate our brother Connie. Like I
[1:00:26] said this morning, he called us and told
[1:00:27] us he wasn't coming. Brother, it was
[1:00:29] cold this morning, but I appreciate you
[1:00:31] coming. I know what it is. I know what
[1:00:32] it's like. Sister Milani, you're looking
[1:00:35] good today. Praise God. Amen. I hope you
[1:00:40] don't mind, brother. Amen. But you know,
[1:00:43] God is so good to us. He is so wonderful
[1:00:47] uh to us. And you know, uh so we're
[1:00:50] going to ask uh our brother to come and
[1:00:52] give us a song. Uh you were you blessed
[1:00:55] this evening?
[1:00:57] You know, people, we we need uh we need
[1:00:59] encouragement, y'all. We all all of us
[1:01:02] know the kind of attacks we receive
[1:01:05] after we leave this service. It ain't no
[1:01:08] joke. Sometimes Satan comes with all all
[1:01:11] four claws. He ain't nothing but a beast
[1:01:14] anyway.
[1:01:15] All right. He comes with all of them.
[1:01:16] And if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:18] we'd be totally confused about it. But
[1:01:23] that's when you know you had a good
[1:01:24] service is when Satan comes and attack
[1:01:27] you. And you know what? Amen. This
[1:01:30] morning must have meant a lot to my
[1:01:32] brother
[1:01:33] because right after that, Satan says, "I
[1:01:35] ain't letting you go." He come right
[1:01:37] there with another fight.
[1:01:42] He told me this morning, you know, he
[1:01:44] said, "Brother, that was really good. I
[1:01:45] really enjoyed the message."
[1:01:49] And that's how it is with all of us. We
[1:01:52] all have our battles. But I tell you
[1:01:55] what, I thank God for every one of you.
[1:01:57] Those of you who've been reaching out to
[1:01:58] one another, I see y'all out there
[1:01:59] talking more. I love that. That really
[1:02:02] blesses my soul. You know, uh, you know,
[1:02:05] there it's been a while since I've had
[1:02:06] to stand in line to shake hands.
[1:02:11] Amen. So, that makes me feel good. Love
[1:02:13] the Lord. Amen. Is our brother
