told him at 12 but but the service should start around 11 30. but however you know we trusted everybody had come out it's mainly geared toward the young people but we really would like all of the elders to come as well mothers fathers sisters brothers grandparents everybody amen uh it'll be a blessing to you i'm sure um i'm looking forward to the weekend forward to the word of god we're living in a time that uh the word of god is precious a lot of people don't believe that we're in a famine but we are even among our own we find out that many of the people are suffering because they're not basically in tune with the word of god and what god is requiring for us to have and to be but as we stand let us turn we'll get right on into the word of god i'll try my best being that it's wednesday and that is wednesday i try not to preach too long but uh anyway not prolonging the time let us turn to first corinthians the 15th chapter we'll begin reading at the 13th verse first corinthians 15th chapter but if there be beginning at the 13th first but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain amen yea we have found false witness of god because excuse me yay and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith in vain ye are yet in your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in christ we have all men most miserable i left out something there but nevertheless god knows you love the lord let's read on down 20th verse but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruit of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all died even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the first fruit after they that are christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule in all authority and power let us pray our dear heavenly father we thank you this evening for being so good to us we thank you for being our all in all and we pray father that you would bless the service in a special way forgive us of our sins and our trespasses all things we may have done and said that have not been pleasing in your sight lord you are a holy god and in your sight lord we are so filthy without your holiness so we pray father that you'll look beyond our faults and see our needs and cover us lord cover us with your blood in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i wanted to entitle this message the resurrection of the lord jesus christ the sub-topic would be christ in you the hope of glory when we talk about the resurrection or speak of the resurrection we understanding stand that it is the rising or the act of rising from the dead resurrection doesn't mean a replacement it means to take the same thing that went down and bring it back up and when something is brought back up per se to bring back it is brought back for use something to be uh used to gain for example on the mount uh transfiguration we had moses and elijah now they have been dead for hundreds of years in this dimension but true true believers cannot die but when they stood there amen on mount transfiguration with jesus christ they represented the resurrection or the translation of the old and new testament saints and they stood with jesus because jesus says i am the resurrection and i am the life he is the only one that can produce a resurrection when we talk about uh being resurrected or the lord jesus christ being resurrected you know many people look at him uh as he was 2 000 years ago and they can't see him today and it's not something that just so happened uh jesus said that in this day there will be many who can who will not be able to see him he said but you will see him there is an elected group a group of people that god has chosen from the foundation of the world it's it's by the grace of god none of us merited it but we also know that when jesus rose from the dead the bible says 500 or more people saw him uh it's amazing because only 120 showed up at the uh upper room experience on the day of pentecost but you and i understand by god's grace that this resurrection now is is exactly taking place and it has uh gone on for about um i would say 2 000 years uh starting you know when it came to the early church and them falling into the ground the bible said if a seed die and he's not buried it's wasted but if it's planted and if it died if it's rot it'll bring forth more of its kind and that was the mystery of the church through the church ages that the early church would die the seed amen but as the time as time progressed amen that same life that went down in the ground would come up again and began to live in man again but in this day it's greater than it's ever been before because we know that the alpha has become the omega the seed that went down has now come to itself understand by god's grace that the the seed is the life that was in the stalk right and that stalk has to be completely dead and rotted out amen in order for that life to go into the seed and so we must understand that the pentecostal age or that age that we were brought out of has now died and erotic you say well brother looks look at all the what they're doing but if you can understand the purity of the word you can understand amen what god is calling for every church age had a mixture of some kind you know you had the uh uh luther's age was a little mixture with wesley and wesley age was a little mixture with the pentecostal age but in this age amen the seed comes to a pure state it leaves everything that was erroneous amen back into the pentecostal age and now it stands as a pure seed why because it represents the word of god you understand me so you say well what do you mean brother books let's say it like this we have come out of laodicea but has laodicea come out of us there are a lot of things that they did pentecostal people like things that they believed that seemed to be all right until malachi 4 came and then when malachi 4 came he was the voice of god he was a prophet of god that was able to identify the error that was in that particular age and he says now you and i who came out of that most of us some of us came right off the street but the age that we come out of was the pentecostal age and that age has to die all of his error in all of his erring ways has to die and this is why the word of god has come to us in such a pure form right we can't look at god as a trinity we can't look at god in in the light of three persons we can't look at uh the baptism and all of those things that that that was around us to erroneous during that time we must have to die we must die and rot to that in order to produce jesus christ because remember the bible tells us that he was going to produce a church without spot wrinkle or blemish that means none of man's stuff will be added to this word the word itself would produce the very christ jesus that died uh and rose again when we see by god's grace the spirit of the lord moving god has come to the this age where he has brought down the capstone and he has placed us in a mysterious age or an age that a lot of people cannot to this day see even in the message uh some people don't want to recognize the eighth day and some people don't want to recognize the bride age and you know they said it was only seven but brother branham said there were eight he comes along and says well let's put it this way he said that seventh was the completion but god brought us back to a holy convocation which was the eighth day which was the first day so if we're now in the first day what are we supposed to produce and by god's grace i want you to understand that there's a reflection there is something that god is doing in each and every one of us and being just ordinary christians will not work for this day there is a process there is something that god is doing amen and he's creating because remember the bible according to revelation the third chapter tells us that jesus christ was the beginning of god's creation right he created adam but now he's there's a second atom that's being formed and he's not being formed out of the dust of the earth but he's being formed by spirit and he's being formed by character amen you know his character he's now forming and shaping us into himself right hallelujah now let me read a few quotes so you can understand where i'm coming from the death and burial and resurrection of jesus christ wasn't just for us to celebrate like we do now with these uh great easter bunnies and eggs and all of these kind of uh strange things that the uh uh manufacturers have have have placed in there but if we're going to celebrate easter the best way of celebrating easter is not outwardly but inwardly because that's where the real easter is that's where the real resurrection is he said in that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you and he declared amen and lazarus to me says i am the resurrection so what what are we looking for brethren said when this spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential like if you ask me of an oak tree and i give you an acorn the life for the egg oak tree is in the acon now but you have to wait till it grow now he's talking about being born again right when you confess with your mouth believe with your heart at that point in time amen you pass from death unto life well that's just a seed that's just the beginning of something uh a marvelous happening in you and that's why paul said we must grow up into him in other words you must grow up into what we call the holy spirit all right so do we when you receive the holy spirit of god it's god's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and you're sealed by the spirit of promise of god into the body of christ when god looked down at calvary and seen jesus dying you heard what he said sealed with the spirit of promise okay right he not only he died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word of god for the age whether it's feet body head or whatever it is see christ was bleeding and dying and god looking upon him saw his resurrection and the church raised with him on easter amen now that's amazing to me because i don't remember it but i believe it with all my heart hallelujah now i by god's grace if you've got to believe it this way because it has nothing to do with your flesh you've got nothing to do with this it's all in the hands of god right amen and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it now we are going to all go our own separate ways we're going to have our own trials and our own disappointments uh are we going to have our personal pressures and all of those things but all of these trials work together for the good hey you don't have to understand it right i don't understand how you mix eggs and sugar and flour and all that good stuff and it comes out as a cake i don't understand it put some heat to it all i know is that it's real good when it's finished hallelujah hey you know i don't know the chemistry of it but i know if you mix certain things together you can come out with a good product and that's what god is doing with you and me it's what what he's doing and i'm appreciating that's why god said in all things give thanks now i'mma hurry up by god's grace because when jesus christ died when he died the bible tells us that the romans he was he was buried and the romans put a roman seal a stone in front because uh you said what they didn't put the stone but they put the seal of rome they wrapped it trying to make sure he wouldn't get out right and that's that's the practice of every organization and denomination they tried to seal the body of christ inside their tomb hallelujah but you see no seal no denomination no organization nothing can hold christ keep him back wrong tried to keep him and every church system crucifies him buries him and then bind him and then they seal him with their stone of unbelief hallelujah but you see one thing for certain they could have had all of the roman soldiers out there outside of the tomb pressing on the stone it still would not have been able to hold his body down hallelujah amen why because the word of god had already said i'll not let your your soul seek corruption y'all know how it goes and your fleshy corruption right he said i won't let it happen by god's grace and he did not hallelujah no seal could hold him that's what brother adam said no seal could hold him he'd come forth god broke the seal the seal of the tomb broke the seal of death broke the seal of hell broke the seal of the grave and came forth triumphant what did it wait a minute let me put my can i say this because i want you to understand what he said he broke the seal of death that's why two christians aren't afraid to die he broke the seal of hell that's why true christians are afraid to go to hell they cannot go hallelujah and he broke the seal of the grave you know it's amazing because we really don't go to the grave just the body the shell go there but as soon as we depart from the shell we go up hallelujah thank god for what we call easter the resurrection amen they couldn't destroy the body they but they they could never destroy the seal see god gave the church a seal then that could never be destroyed when they destroyed abel he raised up south when they destroyed one prophet there raised up another prophet they kept destroying but god give them something then that they cannot destroy it's the supernatural spirit it's the holy ghost itself and it's infallible and it's imperishable it cannot be destroyed it lives on and on and on and because he lives we live with him because we are sealed into the body of the lord jesus christ hallelujah that means once you're in there you can't come out he seals it up amen no way to ever be destroyed what so when the devil tells you that you're going to be destroyed you say no way no way no way to ever be destroyed cannot perish but the but has eternal life amen god's great ripping of them seals you see there was also a seal we call it the veil it kept us out of heaven but on the day of the resurrection when the day of death amen when they died it says it's finished the bible said amen he ripped that veil and twain from top to bottom hallelujah if he would have said from bottom to top we may have thought it was a man but it was god amen from heaven coming down oh my christ died at calvary how that he went up to that cross and i i want to go on now i was reading a little book and this is the thing that really excited me brother adam said he was reading a little book here not long ago that on to some kind of research somebody did some research and in this research he said i found something most startling i sat down and i laid the book down i raised up my hand and praised god and i got up walked and walked around a little bit sat down and read it again and i thought oh is that so that on this same hill where jesus was crucified adam died and was buried the same hill that jesus died on and was buried on the same hill where adam died he died on golgotha and was buried on golgotha and you know what he was raised from golgotha because when jesus raised from the dead all the old testament saints raced with him i thought what uh how appropriate this is whether it's right or wrong [Laughter] hallelujah amen we may not be able to prove it but how appropriate that would be god cannot change hallelujah that's why i get stirred up about easter i get stirred about the resurrection i get stirred about spring amen because i heard and i read some things where they said that that uh jesus died on the sixth and uh and if he did died on the excuse he said that uh and his birthday was on the ninth or you know and and you know um brother birthday is on the ninth i believe it is six or the ninth one of the two but anyway it's still april april it's the springtime and when people say well what brother around we got to do with it well amen that medium told him that his birthday was a memorial to jesus christ's birthday so they had the same birthday man that gets rid of december but nevertheless let's let's move on so what are you saying easter springtime god cannot change his ways resurrection must occur in the spring it cannot in the winter neither can it happen in the fall oh lord have mercy so we don't have to pray about lord not this side of not this side of the earth don't let my flight be in the wintertime hallelujah so you say well what do you mean brother see and i don't know i just i'm just going by what you know i heard this uh from some of the saints and they've gone on the glory now but they told me that brother branham told them that that the resurrection would take place one early easter now i mean you can't get it no earlier than the fourth i don't know but it's but don't get me i'm not prophesying anything i'm just saying i think we need to wake up and smell the coffee because it's in this time of plagues that's what he said in the time of plagues is when the resurrection will take place that's what he said hallelujah whoo he said but if there listen the scripture said but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen can you imagine that this would be it oh hallelujah y'all understand me if this was it how can you be happy with this i was telling somebody the other day i said it's getting so bad i hear myself get up at the chair and i hear myself go down and it's going to get worse your future it's going to get worse you know a close friend of mine uh died the other day and i was hoping it's just a strange thing i kept thinking about and thinking about it and i called one of the friends down south and i said well when sister reece died where if she should go home to be with the lord i said would you please call me so i because i'd like to come to the funeral well the funeral is saturday so i won't be able to go and just a few days later she passed 109 years old she wasn't sick she was worn out but she kept god i'm telling you that lady if you had seen her bible you would well i was powerful because she she knew her words she kept on it she loved the lord she she had a uh uh uh uh uh her husband was not wasn't a saved man i don't know whether he did get saved or not but i just know one thing you would have never known that later rolled her husband in church every time she could and you would have never known and you know how a man he got he was in a real wheelchair what happened he was getting ready to hit her and god struck him yeah he was so upset he was going to fight her about coming to church and she he went to strike her and he caught a stroke and was in that chair ever since and he took care of him like she was his baby you know it's amazing but let me move on you understand me when you say what do you mean brother brooks that was the life of christ that wasn't so ceres that was the life of christ you know and the bible goes on touch not my anointing that means women and men ain't just men hallelujah you love the lord listen the bible says and i'm i'm kind of uh moving in the fast pace trying to for as much as then as christ has suffered for us in the flesh i'm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh of the lusts of men but to the will of god god don't save us for us to live forever in this fleshly way of living we overcome us right and and and listen what he says now i want you to understand we all have our issues when we're under pressure don't forget my subject christ and you the hope of glory you know uh jesus christ uh the resurrection of jesus christ see a man under pressure this is brother brown is what he is when he's under pressure help us lord right his real see the true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all rallied stirred up then you see the real man come out if he's got temper it shows itself if he's meek and gentle it shows his self put him under pressure once and god puts all of his children on the test to see whether there are any flaws in them now you understand me as long as we got flaws we're going to experience pressure the bride of jesus christ is going to be flawless by the help and grace of god y'all look at me like i'm crazy but it's true the blood you can't you you're talking about god if god created everything he can definitely remove the flaws i believe that i just believe it i know it's true because i've seen a lot of flaws going they're not all gone but there's a lot of them hallelujah we make bad decisions right bad decisions are made when under pressure we forget god at the time we need him the most acknowledge the lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path hallelujah you think god gonna keep you from the fire no it is the fire that purifies you it is the fire that challenges you your character to see what what's in there that shouldn't be gold tried in the fire hallelujah ephesians this is why i love this because jesus christ the word of god said we need to put on the new man who is the new man jesus christ put on the new man he's not talking about wearing him on the outside with your flesh he's talking about the new man inside hallelujah we're created from the inside out not the outside in the inside out ephesians 4 23-24 says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind if you don't read your mind or your bible and if you don't listen to the tapes and if you don't you don't pray you'll never renew your mind your mind will always be carnal and he says and and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man with after god is created in righteousness and what true holiness you know what true holiness is the holy ghost i told you i'm not going to be long but but i'm coming to something turn with me to daniel please the third chapter and we've heard about daniel in so many so many ways and so we've heard him preach in a lot of ways but you know there's there's something that happened here in this third chapter that i trust god would give me grace to to show you tonight y'all remember in daniel when uh the image of the brass and gold and clay and iron and you know the image of the end time it was actually god showing daniel what the future was to be uh but when it came down to the iron and the clay those were gentile nations and um and those nations never did mix they tried to be but you know clay and iron don't mix and uh so we know what brother adam said about you know go uh uh the different men who who uh khrushchev and the other guy who uh they didn't mix but um but nevertheless let's move on reading from the 19th verse then with neville ganesa full of fury and the form of his vision was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was was want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the furnace of burning furnish now i want you to understand that this this king right now he's really a type of the church because he's lifted up he's prideful you think he ought to be worshipped and if you don't if you if you get what i'm saying even in this day you find out that churches want to be worshipped i'm a baptist i'm a methodist or i'm a great church you know and according to proverbs 7 you'll find out that the churches and then they sit on the corners and you know they invite people in you know and and they're serving them stolen waters you know yeah you understand they're feeding them they're deceiving them and the bible said that men don't even know that their way is leading down to hell and that's what we got today we've got all kinds of worship and all kinds of idolatry you know nothing no image not even a prophet's image should come into the in in in to block your vision of jesus christ hallelujah that's why john said i must decrease that he must increase and so it is in our day it is jesus christ and him only amen right and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the burning fire furnace then these men were bound in their coats their hosums and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning furnace therefore because the king commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego in other words the very thing they tried to bind them with and destroy them with is the very thing that came back to destroy them and these three men shattered right meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the fiery furnace the then nebuchadnezzar the king was uh uh stoned aston and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire and they answered and said unto the king true o king and he answered and said lo i see four men loosed walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god amen now when we look at this we you know we automatically see you know basically what has been given to us to see but brother branham says an astonishing thing uh that uh that that really caught my attention and i'll read it in just a moment because i want you to understand that these men brother brown said they prayed and they didn't get an answer god didn't come to their rescue there was no lightning bolt or any kind of feeling or whatever but they said within themselves if whether he deliver us or not we're not going to bow to the image in other words they were under pressure what happened to all of the other israelites and all of the other jews that were down in babylon evidently they they bowed but these one who had something they had a substance call it faith if you like they had something amen they were holding on to that wasn't visible to the eye until the pressure came you see what i'm saying in other words when pressure comes you everybody can look like a christian you know look look perfect but when pressure come that's when the real you shows up hallelujah and no matter how embarrassing he the real uv is he's coming through right amen because amen it is a carnal situation you're working with but when you're born again and there is a true life of god on the inside when the pressure comes now i'm telling you this you can you can have that beginning you can have that that uh you know uh like i said that promise you know the promise is sure he's gonna make you perfect amen but you must understand your trials come to make you perfect it comes to make you strong in the areas that you're weak in right if you suffer in patience you're going to keep having those trials until that patient is perfected and it will not be your patience it will be his it's something that you must die out to and let him live it for you christ in you the hope of glory now here it says in uh god's preparation he says we know king nebuchadnezzar dream dreams and daniel interpreted which set the whole gentile world see show it from the beginning to the end of it the second coming of christ and all a man's dream how king pharaoh dream dreams and joseph the interpreter told him what it meant but here it's amazing how god talked to these kings who weren't even christians they didn't believe in the faith they didn't have the faith but god used them to make a believer right and when we saw this great man with the big helmet on his head and brass and you know stood there as he as the image of of the future uh we didn't we didn't see the rapture in it we didn't see that we saw all that israel went through but remember there was a stone hewn out of the mountain and that stone came down from babylon crushing all of the kingdoms now i want to say this to you because a stone did come down and the way we have seen it perhaps is working in a different way all of the kingdoms are being crushed right now because the stone came down and now that the stone who is christ is in his believers amen you don't even know you're working something you don't even know you're doing something but god because of you is destroying all of the kingdoms right now now if you ain't doing it now when is he going to do it and almost every kingdom around is so they so disoriented they you know they they have this insanity going on to to destroy everything yeah it's true or even china come out you know a nuclear war hello you know you can't have one without destroying the world but you got those out there you know what i'm saying it's real y'all understand me we're not in there so we don't see really all the darkness that's going on we're standing out here we're looking at them and like that doesn't make sense but to them it makes sense because they are anointed with the spirit of destruction this is god's doing because they rejected the gospel now they are they are confused you remember that the story about the leopards they were they says uh why you know are we going to stay out here and die why should we stay out here and die right you know i think it was assyrians i can't remember which army it was but here god calls the noise at night and the army got to fighting and killing each other hallelujah and the lepers they walked in their eating right i forgot and this one man said ain't going dead it never happened he got trampled because he disbelieved hallelujah let me tell you something there's nothing too hard for god if god can pour the red sea raise the man from the dead hallelujah amen turn water into wine what is your problem it ain't god he's not the problem our problem is unbelief hey the bible said if you have the faith to believe you can speak to a mountain and that mountain has to move he didn't say it was going to move when you wanted it to but it must move if you really believe huh how can god in this day give a person eyes who didn't even have sockets and then ask the little girl what color you want see we because what it is we got to understand that same life that was in william branham has shifted he's moved up into the bride but if you don't have the faith to work it it will never be worked is that right that's the word when the storm came and the disciple was on the seat and they woke jesus up and said carrot thou not that we perish jesus didn't say nothing but one thing peace be still and then he looked at them and says oh ye of little faith in other words you had the ability i've given you to the author the authority to do it but you want it can't work without faith you got to believe it you listen if you have the faith to believe it will materialize why because you and i when our faith is not working with this dimension there's nothing that can hold it there's nothing that can stop faith nothing you believe that the bible says all those old testament saints died in faith thousands of years they probably didn't have enough ash to put in a teaspoon but when god got up hallelujah and he that that voice of the resurrection called amen all of those ashes potash whatever calcium no matter where they were they got back together but they died in faith believing in the resurrection hallelujah christ lives say how you know he lives brother he lives in me hallelujah see we look at the fourth man but i'm gonna show you what brother adam said the fourth man was about i'm excited because you got to understand christ is doing something and brother branham said that the fire that will the the uh the trial that will come in this last day will be seven times harder there were seven times so seven times what hotter is what seven times seven is what yeah 48 49. okay i want to make sure i said 49 too but i want to make sure anyway he said daniel and this is what you got to understand you've got a purpose in your heart that you're not going to defile yourself it starts with you it's i can't do it for you i got to do it for me daniel had purpose in his heart he wasn't going to defile himself with the world it has to start here and what did he do it saved his life the hebrews children the same way and every person that ever served god becomes an image of god was god expressing his own word through them you understand me daniel was an image of god the three who hebrew boys were images of god god expressing himself through them you are image of god this is what it's all about we are here to prove that the resurrection is real we're here to prove that the resurrection is real how else the world is going to know the bible said you are a light that it upon a hill that cannot be hid and he says listen don't put your light on the bushel don't hide it shine it glorify god that's right hallelujah he says because the hebrew children said our god listen because the hebrew children said our god is able to deliver us they had no revelation of it no more than that because we don't hear nothing about the miracles happening in their lives they were in babylon they were basically slaves they had no rights hallelujah see they had no revelation of it nor more than that but said however excuse me but whoever however we are not bow down to your image what was it this is a key they were expressing faith in the word of god and god expressed himself back and reflected and he was the fourth man that they seen in the mirror in there yes it meant that god was reflecting through those boys to the to the to until the the king says i see a fourth one but he was seeing supernatural what was in them was now reflecting in an image that he saw hallelujah and that's the kind of reflection god wants reflected through us that under pressure they'll see god in you and he'll stand there amen reflecting himself and god expressed himself back and reflected and he was the fourth man that they seen in the mirror in there god expressing himself through the living images hallelujah see what they do not understand he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so what i'm trying to tell you is that when that this is this is under the seals now this is this is some of that mystery so when god this pressure come on us the character will be just like his and whether he deliver us or not we know he's able when we do the we we go through the test you understand me you got to go through the test you must go through the test you've got to be tried hallelujah boy but when they see what they see huh oh you say brothers what are you talking about listen they tried to bore john they tried everything they could they thought he'd die out there on that island they tied him to the polls and i think they they pierced him because you know they tried to burn him he couldn't burn the fire would go back the fire's supposed to come this way if i said hi that's john that's anointed you understand me amen so they couldn't kill him so they pierced him and then when they pierced him amen his blood flowed out put the fire out and here come a dove oh the holy ghost flew out of him he had to be in there somewhere so you see god will never leave himself without a witness hallelujah that's right so you said oh god brother brown says until and i'm closing until the church of the living god that's called the bride of christ get herself connected with god like that she'll still wallow in the world in the mirror clay of sin until she's connected with god in such a way till her heart is so filled with glory and power of god until she can't see nothing else but christ that's right that's what we have to do that's the only plan the only program god has is to do a thing like that you've got to be not artificially took in you got to be born in not shook in or bring a letter to the church but to be born into the church of the living god by the regeneration by the power of the resurrection of jesus christ that makes you a new creature in him amen he said that straighten it up that's straightening it up that does it see yes sir you got we got to straighten it up we're talking about the resurrection we have to straighten it up somehow we've got to get down on our knees and say lord amen take it all i surrender all oh no matter what that is i mean take it oh you're just holding on to a little bit of something he can't do it you can't do it a little elevens were loving the whole lump and you know if you go to peter and he says if you come short of any of those you fall one time he said you'll forget you even saved you'll forget you were even saved that's how bad missing a step will take you into a place that you will even question your salvation we got to keep going moving on up hey if the president came in can fall a couple of times and get back up you can too he didn't stop he got right back i don't know how he felt once he got on the plane but one thing for certain he didn't have a you know he didn't have uh too much pride that he just laid there no he got up he kept moving y'all hear what i'm saying oh lord god is good to us you see those things and you don't understand even in those little things there's a spiritual lesson behind it and you and i are the we are the resurrection of jesus christ i don't know how else to say it the bible said they were first called christians at antioch why because they walked like him they talked like them the miracles followed they had loved one toward another all of those things were there and so much so when they saw those group of people they said that's just like jesus that's the same christ the way christ was right they could have been poor no they didn't look at the outward they looked at the character they saw the character that was being formed in those people and they called them christians wouldn't it be wonderful amen that you don't have to tell people i'm a christian or you got a sign on your back i'm a christian or a cross i got some of those shirts too but you know what that doesn't make you a christian no no more than standing in a garage makes you a car you know but that's we must understand by god's grace what god is doing for us listen people we can't remain remember i told you in the last few services you got to elevate your mind you got to renew your mind understand who you are and what you came to do we have a purpose what made brother branham brother branham malachi 4 he saw the purpose he fulfilled the purpose everything that he was supposed to do he did it right that's what made jesus christ the real jesus christ he did everything the scripture said he was supposed to do we're the bride we must do everything the bible says we're supposed to do and if we don't come there we're not so let's stand that reflection of christ in us is to prove that he's alive and well character we've got the word that produces character we must allow the character to be produced in us people is through we we think we've got to be yes we're human flesh but that's not us this is not us this is just a shell and you think about it you know i can remember the time you know when god ain't with you you know you you you're thinking carnal because you you profess to be a christian and i can remember the time when i was in south africa and they let that lioness out of the cage we were walking it they didn't tell me about walking sarah i knew sarah when she was a cub now sarah was a full-grown cat they were trying to teach her how to hunt they had starved her for about a month and so i was there just in time for them to let the cat out to go hunting but nobody told me everybody else to be honest with you when they opened that cage i ran i'm just going to tell you how it is and was i afraid yeah because the whole thing i'm thinking [Music] i'm thinking you know these people crazy why are they doing this to me and i'm running i'm the only one that didn't know and they thought it was a joke but then the you know brian jones started screaming at me like i was at fault i said what you didn't tell me first of all you give me this little piece of stick and i'm like what is this going to do to a lion i didn't know they gave sarah a stick to it i guess now we're part of the pride to make a long story short sarah started pouncing on some men and i'm i'm nervous now i'm messed up i'm thinking about my wife and all my children [Music] see i don't play with the devil you know my mama says don't give that devil an inch he'll take a mile so i've always had that guy in my mind i'm not gonna play with him like that and i was very angry i think that was probably one of the times i was the most i was just if you could have seen the spiritual i had steam coming out of my head and i i just just just was so upset i was nervous in my stomach and [Music] but it wasn't all over we're walking and sarah she goes and tried to catch this animal and she missed it and then gideon ratif goes up to the house to get a camera he's coming back with the camera and now sarah is in and brian jones is too far to catch her with distance but she's closer to to retie and i'm thinking oh my goodness this cat is gonna you know jump it and brian started running sarah sarah he got there just in time she was getting ready to go leap at him and now you can't imagine what i was feeling but one thing for certain i promised myself i'd never go back i have kept my promise but you know it's my thing is this i was a preacher i had the holy ghost you know but it it didn't kick in y'all understand me there was i was so overwhelmed with fear so i'm trying to tell you this it's not something you can do [Music] no god has to be there to stop that right brother was getting ready to shoot that bull but god stepped in see he has to step in every time and the lord showed me that there was a level of fear you know that i had i had never had it before never had a sense but i experienced it till you know you you you you get weak [Music] i don't know how it be it would be now that what god has given me much more than since then and uh but i want to be to a place where nothing moves [Music] those old saints when they were placed in the in their rome arenas they ran to the lines they didn't run from it you know it's just something we've got to come up to and you know from the pulpit to the door we got to let go and let god some of y'all know i'm leaving on the 9th of april and and i'm going to seek the lord in a special way pray for me that when i come back i have something to share [Music] i believe it's just that close i believe it's it's just that close this is not going somewhere to preach or to say no just a few people will know that i'm there and that you all the place will outstand so i can have some accountability but uh i just say maybe i'm out of my mind but i really have a strong pull in my life i have something that's moving me that just i can't explain it it just i fight to keep from being [Music] depressed if i want to say it that way because i see that we're not where we should be i'm looking for a supernatural church i don't care about everybody now i do care but y'all know what i'm saying and people going to do what they got to do let them do but not me i can't stay here because i believe with all my heart that the rapture is to take place and i just preach to you what god is requiring that's just not for you that's for me too and so i just desire your prayers please pray for me you know i've been preparation preparing myself the best way i know how and i owe it to the church and to myself myself first and then the church you know so pray for me um we're looking forward to this weekend brother jesse will be coming i thought but since i'm not preaching i'd give you a little thought on some things that god showed me and i i believe right now that the what we we're looking at is because of what took place in 1963 brother bradham said even he said that thing kept rolling and rolling going on going on further and further it didn't go off the earth it just went around right he talks about the seals when they were open and rockets going up everything is beginning to unfold and and you got to understand we're coming into a place a heavenly place where we're sitting in heavenly places thinking like god acting like god walking like god talking like god those are the things that god that pleases him now because this is what it's always been it's the replenishing of the earth with his seed and his seed alone that's what it really is let us pray father god we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us there are no
