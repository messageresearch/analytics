stuff over there at my home church yeah uh anyway let's just uh powerhouse known to us you know all of these things because you've lived issues and you recognize what we have need in our bodies also with our families lord you know what we pray for day by day but you understand let's amen amen thank you musicians okay if you get your bibles out it shows up in ecclesiastes for those who weren't here yesterday my name kentucky i go to church at church at the open door it's in indiana open door yeah and i bring greetings from our pastor it's nice to meet people in other places of like precious faith brothers and sisters i can never doubt that we have fellowship in the revealed word of the lord jesus for this hour uh if you go to ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 14 says i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him verse 15 that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god require it that which is passed [Music] i love i love it when i open the scripture and i see a statement like that [Music] so i actually had to pray over this and try to understand it like especially when i go to the book of like any books that paul wrote he uses these big words and they're trying to understand what he's saying and it's just like so hard to get it right then i have to go into the tapes and start listening to that and try to understand exactly what that means even though it's written in a very it's it's a very spiritual language spiritual if you read the bible it's it's it's heavenly honestly not just because it's english because i love english but it's just god if god condescended to put his his his own being his own substance into the written word coming from somewhere else but god put himself in there it's different because you can stake your life on that word right there it's completely different okay so here it says in verse 15 that which have been in the past and you're going to realize that i really love english because if you actually look at this from an english standpoint or whatever language you're reading in french he's using different tenses here he's the only one who can say one sentence and switch through three different tenses and it's totally true if you look at verse 15 it says that which happened in the past is now the verse and that which is going to happen has already happened and god needed what was in the past like what what is that even like no one else can talk like this if you look at it this way if you go and read your bible you look all the events in the whole old testament the new testament and you put it all together it all had to happen for you to sit here it had to happen exactly the way it happened okay so think of it every event happened here so god could put you in a certain place ready for the rapture so god could have you each individual sitting here okay if you want to go to ecclesiastes just go back to chapter one it's like two chapters before that it'll be verse nine it's another it's another tongue twister it sounds a little confusing verse 9 says the thing that happened is that which shall be seeking and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun verse 10 is there anything aware of it may be said in those two verses it said everything that's happening right now has already happened in the past or it's at least been said to happen now i like that word you just use declare it was declared to happen right here it's awesome so if you think about it god declares in his word that something's going to happen to us it's as good as done what he's saying what he's saying in these verses is that is as good as done it's already past tense because he said if you go to verse 11 there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be in remembrance of things that are to come right there how do you remember something that hasn't happened yet i just want to know how just think about that how do i remember an event that happened only been monkey japanese if i didn't experience it if you if you listen to their revelation of the word that was spoken in the past you hear a message that brother brandon preached called modern events are made clear by prophecy and therefore when you see them happen in modern day declaration you automatically remember that prophecy so you remember something that's still about to happen let me give you some examples you heard that in the last days there should come perilous times in matthew 1 [Music] you've never seen before jesus christ talked about them two thousand years ago jesus christ and he says as it was in the days of noah it is and therefore it becomes your memory whenever you see it happen in the future whenever you look at the newspaper and you see something else happen i remember that i shouldn't be worried about it you got it under control what does it say in romans 8 28 all things work together for good that them that love lord no matter how scary it is attacked no matter what happens i know it's working out for my god and god's gonna raise me to a higher place as a result just imagine those few scriptures can tell you all of that no one else can talk like this god can give you a promise a statement that's just so profound that whenever you actually think about it [Music] one sentence can talk about your past your present in your future uh come let us reason together 1955. i'm not sure do you incredible translate sentence so this brother is talking to brother branham and he wants to see a vision like brother branham i mean i would love to be able to do that can you imagine he tells these stories over and over again testifies about how those visions like they told the future they told people's past he would talk to a man and see what he did last night under the cover of darkness no one else said but god sold you and then god would transmit it to his prophet is and he would be able to tell us what happened over there it's just a beautiful it would just be amazing i think many of us would be in this brother's shoes and be like oof and here is god's vision just open it up and open say god now open my eyes that i can see you he every time you open the bible it was a jew you'd see a vision of god do you want vision speaking forth to you i love this last sentence and i'm not going to read it yet it's like you open the bible you see visions like oh look isaiah saw this way not only that but if you meditate meditate over the world then you see god's vision for you you're gonna see yourself written in there you're going to see what he promised you in there the last sentence he says is set with a humble heart that means don't a lot of people fail on that one point because they try to take it and run with it and do something a little different from what his word says and that's how they end up off on a limb somewhere now there's uh there is there's a statement that's in the bible that you may have seen whenever moses is in front of the burning bush moses goes up to him in in of course he has the whole i am that i am and all that and he commissions him to uh go to egypt and then moses has this question because you have to remember at moses's time maybe they only had the book of job but i don't even know if he'd read it but he didn't have anything to base anything to base his experience on experience all he was doing was standing on a mountain in front of a burning bush what to tell his brethren the israelites because they would ask who sent you and he didn't know god's name so moses asks an honest simple like to i'd like to focus on this because keep in mind we're talking about different tenses in whatever language you're speaking because all language has a concept of past present and future long concepts just read your school and no one else the reason it's capitalized at least from my perspective because not everybody can say those words and it has the same weight so i can write that down on a piece of paper and eventually it's not going to be true anymore i can't write i am on a piece of paper so it wouldn't be true forever that whenever he said whenever you go to the genesis chapter one it says in the beginning god created created the heavens and the earth and god says something like let there be this did you have the let's see that word way back then when he said it even if it took millions of years for that to come true memphis is amen and then that goes true for all of his word whenever he's talking about you and he's talking about me just think of it this way nobody in history has that much power napoleon bonaparte can say i was uh because he wasn't eternal if you go back and pass you have george washington washington he could say i am back there and it would be a lie right now if you go to one of those great philosophers socrates um i think he said i think therefore i am japan he doesn't think anymore in impossible and he's not anymore because he's dead and what he said doesn't really have any weight with me it's not as much permanent and unyielding as this word if you can get that revelation and realize god said i am and it has that much weight then you can actually say that for yourself i can say i am hello because he came down and died for me because he was is and will be because he's eternal and gives me some of that eternity present tense continuous because it's going to continue forever it's never not going to be a lie i can say i am because i was way back in the thinking of god before the foundation of the world maybe i have that eternal life living in me i'm not saying we can we can say statements like uh we can't prophesy ourselves unless it's in the will of god once that's what's but we can we can still take that part of him and apply it to our lives of that character that he has anything that he's building us towards we can apply that to our own lives in present tense okay i have another quote concerning moses 1963 look away to jesus and when moses drive close to it he said take off your shoes for i am ill the prophet says now if you would weigh that word i now let's go to isaiah chapter 53 if you still have your bibles chapter 53 verse 3. isaiah in chapter 53 he's talking about christ and uh it's interesting the way he speaks about it because isaiah was a prophet isaiah so all of these people that he's prophesying to at that point okay so it's interesting whenever you read what isaiah is saying about christ and you break it down sentence for a sentence you can do this throughout the bible actually then it only works in the situation that god is talking about in that word in isaiah 53 pay attention to the tenses now he is despised and rejected of men he's talking about christ about the christian hundreds of years before christ is born dissonant and we hid as it were our faces from him past tense he was despised so it seems like that the prophet isaiah is talking in past tense about something that hasn't happened that's where god wants you today he wants you to talk in past tense whenever you pray to him whenever you're seeking a promise from him the holy ghost past tense you're talking it's not something you don't even see manifested right now verse four it says surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows [Music] isaiah's day right there they were still living under the blood of bulls and goats but he says by his stripes so they're claiming that promise that god jesus christ has already died for them they had the revelation of that word at that time and they they had the revelation of it they could have applied it to their own salvation at that time it took the manifestation of that to happen for god to release the revelation on mankind that would happen in the new testament and that will stay until the end of time 1956. he's still talking about the same scripture he says he was wounded for our transgressions of our peace upon there is no negative at all in christianity and you think about how they had the who was the king was it darius i don't remember i think it was king darius the persian king his advisors have him uh have him trick daniel actually his advisors just tricked him because they made a law in their own law saying that since that king since that king is a king he was also uh he was also a representation of deity to them of exactly the way god should makes in history that's never going to fail because that's the way he wrote his word first peter 2 24. he's also quoting the same thing he said keep in mind keep looking at these tenses it says that we continue that we being dead to sins it's the second half of the verse being dead to sin should live unto unrighteousness unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed and at this point the israelites uh the people in israel the jews and the newfound christians yes finally had the revelation of what isaiah was talking about so long before they before he came on the scene 1953 the testimony of jesus christ and the only thing you have to do is not think about your senses or how you feel just believe what he said like that the scriptures cannot be broken whatsoever things you desire here is quoting mark you see when you pray believe you receive it it will be given to you but you got to think of it this way what he's saying in that quote is whenever you have faith in the word he says don't think about your senses faith makes you only think in present tense to claim your promises and what you pray for it also makes you think in future tense because you see stuff that's going to happen it makes you look in the past it's not written in the bible and you can't deny that it's true faith makes you think that way it stops becoming thinking it becomes believing just know it down in your heart you don't have to think about it that's what faith does for you john 5 24. you know john says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him everlasting life so this is all present tense if you're hearing my words whoever sent me you have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation in the future automatically so if you're on the fence about your own salvation just just take that word into your heart and think about that that god's already saved you if you're already just visible you're questioning your salvation by his stripes we are already healed we were already saved you don't have to you don't have to question it so much you just need to accept one more scripture about tenses because it's just fun to me go to matthew 17 matthew 17 10. it says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come in and jesus answered and said unto them keep in mind they're talking about john the baptist coming before jesus christ so they recognize that christ is already there among them but they're confused because they didn't see when john the baptist came up they didn't notice that there that the scripture had already been fulfilled he said in the future elias will come the future he's obviously not talking about john the baptist john the baptist was already you know about his ministry and he says in verse 12 but i say unto you that elias has come already the same scripture in malachi chapter 4. talking about two different men one and he says likewise shall also the son of man suffer then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist i don't think they understood that malachi 4 was coming they only understood the john the baptist even though god's word is eternal and it still has many things in there we don't understand that will happen there are many things in this bible i don't understand yeah i read through it the whole of last year and i came out very confused about many scriptures like in the old testament i read anything in here and i don't understand and i pray to god with a humble heart and i wait for that revelation to come that goes for things that i hear in the message and i don't understand yeah if i see brother branham in this scripture i accept what he said i don't know how many people here play chess i'm not going to ask you i love chester if you if you don't want to think about chess think about checkers there's so many different roles and and this is keep in mind this is god's perspective that we're talking about overall everything that he said will happen has already happened to the end in his perspective this little blip that i don't know six thousand years seven thousand years that the world's been around perspective just a speck in eternity to i was talking to the young people about the devil and what he sees and how he fought against god it started so way back when whenever the devil first decided in his heart to deny god's word god already knew when he created lucifer and he he didn't put sin in the heart of lucifer he just knew what lucifer would become isabel because god can't be a creator of sin that's something god would do so satan himself started playing a game the second he went against god's will i remember you to think about it as a game because if you play chess there are a lot of rules checkers or whatever it is okay so satan has been playing this game for thousands of years the oldest person in this room can't even be over 100 years old the devil the devil knows the word completely that's how he was able to try to tempt jesus completely and guess who wrote the rule book i don't who wrote the rulebook who wrote the rules who was the one who was writing the word so god wrote the wrong book and he can change the rules whenever you want just think about it the devil comes and he does his best to attack think of it this way the devil wants to attack you you have to get permission from god to try it out he has to ask god before he can take one of his pieces he can't just do what he wants to do even if it's according to the rules he's a complete loser from the get-go and he's still going to keep trying to play i want you to think of this this isn't actually a rulebook it's a playbook i'll leave the a playbook is in like if you're in sports and there's different plays that you're going to run to the christians it explains exactly the way god wants you to move explain god can change anything that he wants to in your life and follow it more of a playbook it's so sad for satan because god let him see it you know how insulting that is to him he understands just exactly how god wants to operate and what god's plan is we're going to lose in the end and yet he keeps playing may you continue kamehameha if it was me or you it's just common sense would say don't play that game just the the songs i wouldn't try to play a game against a grand master in chessy he's wiped off the earth god's will in his life has already been accomplished right now that god that he's just fulfilling god's will says being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ upon there christian you can just rest we have to not forget that now uh right now i have to switch it up frank because the devil is trying to stop me and uh i had all my sermon notes for all the sermons i've ever had on my computer and it was set up just perfectly you see like the buffet and then somehow everything got deleted last night so i had to do my best to try to figure out how to get it back and i'm still struggling with that but he hasn't stopped the working of god today a bunch of notes on my phone okay let's just look at a situation or two where um situation where god is letting the devil play the game but he's not letting him win the first most obvious example is whenever jesus christ was walking the earth the example brother branham said the devil had a celebration that day because he was going to calvary he had so many different scriptures in the word in his word saying jesus christ would come back to life he didn't understand the revelation of what god was going to do in that hour so god took christ and raised him back up out of the grave and he had a greater victory after that than the devil had had his entire career simply because he thought that the devil thought he was winning in that moment took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus christ saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preaches so these men are using the word of god to try to cast out evil spirits in a man actually multiple people probably verse 14 and there were and there were seven sons of one skiva a jew and chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered place and doing their best to believe in god efficiently and the message of paul the church age messenger and god said let the devil win this one but i want you to see what happens next verse 17 and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus if you look at that you would think fear fell on them all because the devil's so powerful seven priests who were christians and sons of skeva sacrifices many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and they counted the price of them and found that found 50 000 pieces of silver the devil is playing checkers and god's playing chess yeah so god's playing a game that's just a lot more powerful than what the devil is playing and in the end all of these people who were practicing witchcraft in that town begin to glorify god give their lives to christ many more people than what the devil had got out of this city so if you want to look at the two messages i brought to you this weekend yesterday i talked 1964 says so politics is one side of the fence defense and i'm on the other is it i said i voted once that was for christ that's right see you got a vote coming god voted for you the devil if you accept those things she was accepted [Music] [Music] [Music] and and if we're honest with ourselves we all are i don't see we need you to get the victory in our lives as we travel as we go from day to day entering the lord we're your servants lord jesus christ [Music] thank you man amen did you enjoy the word of god amanda's turn to our feet and sing the song draw me near amen [Music] so [Music] i have heard [Music] but i long to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] thou hast died oh draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to
