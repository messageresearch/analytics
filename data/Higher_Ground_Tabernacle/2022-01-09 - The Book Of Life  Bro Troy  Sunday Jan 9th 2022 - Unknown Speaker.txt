appreciate you joining in with the worship service because i am not a song leader as you can tell hey man without musicians it does make it a little bit harder so but you all did get to witness the very first time i've ever led songs so this moment will go down into history amen but you know sometimes we have to do things that we're not used to doing and uh that's okay amen and that's okay you know sometimes we all get into these areas where we do things that we're not used to doing but we do it in the service of the lord anyhow amen amen because we know that he is worthy amen you know i've never taken a rapture before amen but one of these days i'm going to take in a rapture even though i've never done it before amen amen but i know that when the the moment comes for me to take a rapture i know his spirit will come down and give me the ability at that moment in time where i need it amen and so is it so with every point of our christian walk when we have need of something his spirit will come down and give the ability for the hour that is needed amen amen amen let's open our bibles to revelations chapter 3. we're going to read from the sardis church age amen revelations chapter 3. let's start with the third verse and it says remember therefore how thou hast received and hurt and hold fast and repent if therefore shall not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shall not know what hour i will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out blot out his name out of the book of life but i'll confess his name before my father and before his angels amen let's just uh we'll just stop right there amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just approach unto you this morning lord maybe being few and number lord having just a little bit of an unusual service this morning but lord knowing that regardless of how the the the things that surround us with the music and the things like that might not be here this morning or our normal song leader lord and those things may not be here lord but but we're here father as a part of your bride of christ lord lord and you that made an appointment with us before the foundation of the world as your prophet told us that whenever two or three are gathered in in your name that that you would keep that appointment with us lord and we are trusting in that this morning father amen lord in our gathering this morning was not in vain lord lord know maybe in our bodies we don't feel a hundred percent lord but but we know that our gathering is not in vain lord because we have trusted in your promise and in your word and that we came here this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and trusting in your word lord we thank you for coming into this place lord amen i pray for everyone here and in under in divine presence father amen lord that you would anoint them lord lord strengthen the bodies that are weak lord the lord the the hearts that have gotten a little cold and stony this morning that you would soften them and revive them father for those that are just not in the spirit this morning lord that you would quicken their spirit lord quicken their mortal bodies to to respond to your presence lord this morning lord that when we walk out of this place that we won't say that we came to have a cold church service lord or a lukewarm church service father the lord became lord in the presence of all the mighty god and we are changed by you amen or because we know that your presence changes sins it always has father and we are trusting in you this morning lord lord we dedicate our lives we dedicate our our hearts lord and everything to you this morning lord have thy own way in the service today in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen sardis church age there you know brother branham said that all of those church ages preceding us they had their little portion of the spirit they had the portion that god gave unto them amen it was theirs as an inheritance something that they could have something they could hold on to they had a portion of the spirit that would get them through the age that they lived through amen they they had their trials they had their tests amen but they had the spirit of god that met them in that time that allowed them to get through to the end of their age and to be what god promised would be there was an overcoming to an overcomer to that age amen and so the spirit of god brought them to the end of their age and made them overcomers in the age that they lived in amen amen and then brother brahma also said that here in the last days amen here in the last stage in the laodicean age amen that we would have a portion amen of the struggles of those that went on before us amen we would have some of those start to seeing church age struggles in our day and we would also have a portion of that overcoming power in that day amen with a uniting of all those ages before us coming together amen to ahead in one age the laodicean h where we have the seven spirits of the church they are the seven spirits of christ we have all the trials of the ages going on before us everything coming to a head amen at this age here amen amen so when when when jesus is writing the church writing the letter here to the churches and he gets to the to the sardisian church page and he's speaking to them amen he said that that you have a few names that have not defiled their garments amen amen you know we have the same thing in our age we have a few that have gathered themselves underneath a message so that when the with the incomes that their robes will be clean and white amen that's what we're looking for that's what we're hoping for that's what we're striving for that's what all of our all of our repenting is for that's what our trusting in the blood is for is that when the day comes that when he speaks come up hither come up in a rapture bride that will look and our robes will be walking in white amen we'll be walking in purity maybe we'll be one with him i want to speak a message this morning called the book of life amen amen the story of life amen god has a a book that he has written amen amen and there's not a lot of descriptions of all that is if you you just look at it on the surface there's not a lot of descriptions of what that book has what that book has on the inside there's not a lot of descriptions in the bible exactly at all in that book when you just look at it on the surface but as you begin to dive in it begins to get a little bit clearer amen those folks there in the start our brothers and sisters in the sardisian church age they were told by our lord that in verse 4 it says you have a few names in cyrus which have not defiled their garments amen there's names there amen those names were predestinated to be in that sardisian church age they are they're our brothers they're our sisters we'll see them on the other side god chose them to be in that age amen he gave them a spirit that allowed them to overcome the troubles and the trials of their age amen amen amen amen and and when the spirit of god came upon them they lived out according to what the the the the design that god had for their age amen they lived according and they filled out what their name said they were going to be amen god has a predestinated walk for every child of god amen it's there it exists amen amen we don't always have the revelation of it right amen we don't always know about it we we don't maybe not have the revelation what god has in store for us or what god has store for the future you can go on for a while in one path and all of a sudden god can move upon your life and completely change your direction and go to an area that you never thought you would go amen amen god's got the ways of a christian believer are unique amen brother brown said that the the bride of christ will be a mystic to the world amen amen the world will look at us and won't understand us we'll go and we'll do things that don't make sense to the world amen we'll make decisions that are they're not according to what the world says we ought to do but we'll make decisions according to what the spirit tells us to do hey man it'll be it looks like complete nonsense to the world amen but we are led by the holy ghost amen amen we're not here to do what what this denomination says we ought to do we're not here to do what this person over here says we ought to do we're not here to to to do what the business world thinks we ought to do we're not here to do what hollywood thinks we ought to do amen we don't live our lives like according to like that but we have a walk that god has ordained for each one of us to live amen and there is a path that is laid before us amen we're going to walk that path by the power of the holy ghost we know that that path is laying before us amen we know that in our own selves we can't attain it amen we know that our own striving we can't do it we know that if we try to do it we would fail amen but when we yield ourselves to the holy ghost then all of a sudden that we just keep walking walk in the light as he is in the light amen and keep going forward keep moving forward and each decade of our lives is different than the decade before you know when you're a child your life changes every three years up until you're about 21 years old every three years is different completely different you take a child that's three his life is completely different by the time he's six by the time he's nine it's completely different again by the time he's 12 he's matured and he's morphed into something else every three years a child's life completely changes an 18 year old matures a lot from 18 to 21. by the time he's 21 he's changed and those those those 21 years that's that's that's seven sets of threes and each one is a complete change from one period to the next year now when you get to be an adult that begins to slow down and from there it goes by sevens and by by every seven years and throughout your adult life from 21 to 28 you change your life has changed you begin to think differently when you're 28 than you did when you were 21. you you you've made a transformation hey man when you get to stage 35 you don't really think the way that you did when you're 28 you've made another transformation hey man because there is it's it's constantly your life is changing every seven years you know you you're making a transformation amen you know and and god has allotted like he says i've allotted seven years 70 years to a man on the earth that's ten sevens amen each of us has our our our our numbers that are allowed to us now if by reason of strength you go beyond 70 years that's that's the bonus amen to to live here upon this life amen but god says i owe a lot unto you that 70 years but you know that god has a a a plan for each year of your life amen each period of your life and as you change from from one maturity to another maturity amen god has a different different idea a different plan for you at each step of your life amen you can go for a long time in one direction but then there comes a time where you have to change a corner amen and when you change that corner the spirit of god is there for you to continue on in the direction that you're moving now you might say well i never saw myself doing this but then you see the lord just seems to be leading me this way and he is i have never gone this way before amen as uh brother brandon preached a sermon called turning northward amen there was a time when they were marching around in the wilderness they are marching in circles in the wilderness in circles and circles and circles and and one day god sent them a message he says turn northward now is the time now is the hour turn change directions go north into the promises that have been set up before you because time and promise we're coming together amen amen amen turn northward and enter into the promises of the lord amen let's turn over to psalms chapter psalms 31 39 psalms 139 uh start with the 13th verse let's start with the 17th verse let's just read these together amen how precious also are the thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them let's go back and read the 16th verse thine eyes did see my substance being yet unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them amen there is god has his thoughts towards us there are thoughts that god has for you amen amen he thought them before the foundation of the world he had you in his mind amen before the foundation of the world he was thinking of you and what you have of not just you but your characteristics who you were what you would be doing what your emotions would be your particular makeup you know what what your challenges would be he he had those ideas in his mind and but not just the ideas of your trials of your life but also the glories of your life amen i mean not just the things that you would have to suffer through but the things that she the great moments of joy that he would bring to you amen after you suffered a little while that he would come together after that and you were sick you would he'd bring the healing when you were bound up he would bring the deliverance when you were troubled in your mind he'd bring the restoration amen how great are his some of his thoughts that even though he he knew that you would go down into maybe a dark place mentally for a while or physically for a while but there was a time that he would raise you up out of that amen and not just to bring you a deliverance here on this earth amen because his desires not just to leave us down here amen but that he who had had in his mind a resurrection to bring you up out of being just a a a an animal nature type person or a person with a uh the body of an animal but to be a person that is filled with the spirit of the living god amen a person that is filled with the creator himself amen amen amen how great are the some of his thoughts toward you who can who can see into the mind of the lord who can consider what he has for you amen who can who can know the the who can know in the future what god has envisioned for your life amen if he has a perfect vision for you we know that it's not a a small thing we know that it's not but god has chosen you to be the one to live here in the last days god has chosen you to live underneath this message amen god sent a powerful message in this last days to call out a people and he chose you to be the people that he called out amen amen therefore god has a great thought for you and your life amen we go and we live here and we we work our jobs and we think lord why do i have to toil in this or why is this so hard or or why do i have to live like this but but for all that god has a glorious thought of you and of your life amen god has a revelation of who you are who you are supposed to be and that revelation the spirit when that is revealed to you you walk in it step by step as you walk in the light amen you walk step by step as far as the light will shine amen and it will bring you to a place that you'll look back and say i never could have placed myself here hallelujah if i could have thought to put myself here i couldn't have done it if i could if i could have wished for the best for me it would still be underneath where i am amen because god put me here that's right because god did this for me yeah anyway sometimes we think well how did i get to this place well god does this from here sometimes we something happens to us that's of the lord like oh my i wouldn't even known to have asked for that amen amen hallelujah but god put us there hallelujah amen how great are the some of his thoughts amen how precious are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them amen if i count them they are more in number than the sand amen and when i awake i'm still with thee amen amen now you know the the even though remember in matthew 25 both the wise and the foolish virgin fell asleep the very time that they were supposed to be about their duty at the very time they're supposed to be shining light in the last days at the end time for the coming of the uh of the bridegroom amen the wise version too she also fell asleep but here it says but when i awake you're still with me amen when the wise virgin woke up she still had extra oil with her her lamp might start getting a little dim her lamp might have gone out but she knew he was right there amen to re-light again to refill her lamp to give her a refill oh he goes when she woke up he was still there amen amen that's inheritance to the bride of christ amen it belongs to us hallelujah it's something an inheritance is something you can put your hands around you can grab ahold of it amen it belongs to you you have the title assigned in your name it is yours amen it belongs to you and we have a title an inheritance of of being the bride of christ amen it belongs to you grab a hold of it it's yours amen you have an inheritance of a of a of a predestinated path that god has given you amen a path of peace amen not a of doubt but of belief a dot of fear but faith amen yeah that's your inheritance it belongs to you amen we can grab ahold of it we can say this is mine this brother man says that the faith has hair on his chest it believes it has a strength that that of all of its own amen it has a strength that says this is mine i believe in but it's not a wish you wash your faith amen everybody knows that that even though my mind says this but god's word says this and i believe god's word amen amen how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh god how great is the sum of them if i could add them up i can't even see what the total would be how great are the sum of his thoughts how precious are they unto me we think of his thoughts jesus says my thoughts i have to thoughts of peace a joy of a sound mind i have these thoughts towards you not not of trial and strife i have these thoughts to give you peace and joy in the holy ghost amen when the lord the lord says when i think of you i think thoughts of peace where i think of you i think of healing i think of you being whole god's desire god's thoughts is for us to be restored he has a restoration for us amen that's part of his thoughts amen and those thoughts belong to us as an inheritance amen so when we see something in our life that is falling short of the thoughts of god we go back and we say well what are the thoughts of god in this situation and you grab a hold of those these are mine this is my inheritance like caleb said give me my mountain he he knew that the mountain was there he knew that the inheritance was there he knew that it belonged unto him and there was a faith inside of him that reached out and said this is my amen it belongs to me i'm good i uh the the bride the the position my position is the bride of christ it belongs to me amen the healing in his mind he paid for it salvation is mine he paid for it amen he paid the price for me hallelujah last time i was here i was preaching on uh jonah about how about how uh jonah paid the fare to get on the boat to go to tarshish he was running away from the presence of god amen and there was a cost unto him there was a price that he had to pay to run away from the presence of god god said he should do this but instead he went and did this and there was a price that he had to pay for that and so he he dug down into his pocketbook and he paid the fare he paid the price to run away from god amen but god had already paid the price for him to go right back into the will of god amen amen so it doesn't matter how much price that we pay to get out of god's will the price that god paid for us to get back in the will of god is always greater god always paid the greater price because he gave his own life for us amen amen god paid the price for us to get right back on towards the thoughts of him you know in revelations chapter 3 and the start of seeing age there they were talking about the the book of life and uh he said there in verse four chapter three verse four in revelations it says thou has a few names and sorrows which is not defiled their garments they shall walk with me and wipe for for their worth now i already think about yourself how many times do the people say oh you know i'm not worthy of this i'm not worthy of that but but here god is jesus christ itself is looking at a portion of the bride of christ and saying they're worthy now if there's a promise to one portion of the bride there's a promise to the entire bride amen amen amen they are worthy amen amen they shall walk with me white for they are worthy verse 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name by the book of life but i'll confess his name before my father and his angels amen they the the folks there and sardis the our brothers and sister believers there they had their names upon the lamb's book of life hallelujah amen they had representation there amen when god wrote the book of life he he put their names there and they had representation now that the book of life is mentioned a few times throughout the scriptures moses spoke of it spoke of in the revelations peter spoke of it and and many others they spoke of it you know i think jeremiah or isaiah spoke of it throughout all the bible there's this book called life that that that men have been it's been revealed to them in a little bit it's been revealed to them in a portion of what it is they they they've had a small inkling of what it could be they're not too sure they know that the one thing they do know is they know that god has a book amen and and brother branham he he he said that when you oh if you were to open the book of life he says that there might be many books that have a lot of words in them that say this or that or this or that but he said well the book of life is not like that he says when you open the book of life the only thing that you see in it is names amen amen amen now i want you to if you think about a man that's going to write a book you know if if a man is an author amen he he when he writes a book he he has to make it he has some decisions he has to make hey man now the the motive for a man to write a book is because he has something in his mind amen that's why men write books because he has something that's in his mind amen when he has something in his mind he wants to take it out of his mind and to express it to the world so that the people that are in the world can can see what it is that this man had in his mind amen and then once he shares it with them those folks will have it in their minds amen and so he takes this thought and he puts it down on paper in a book and he begins to expand it out and expand it out amen he decides he has to decide what the beginning of the book is going to be then he has to decide what the end of the book is going to be yes and he kind of breaks up into chapters and he kind of gets a flow of it from the beginning to the ending this is what the book is going to be about and then he kind of breaks he takes each chapter and he widens it out winds it out and widens it out and by the end by the time he's written his book the book has completely expressed the thought that he had in his mind his thought has been completely expressed of what he had in his mind amen then he has a decision he has to to to to to give that book a title something that he can put on the cover stand and whatever title he chooses that title that's on the on the cover of the book has to express what's on the inside of the book so that if anybody wants to read this book wants to experience this book then they read the title of it that that title will kind of express what's on the inside of that book what's this book about amen and you can see the the title you can have the idea of that title in chapter one and chapter two in chapter 3 chapter 5 chapter 25 all the way through that book you'll see that title is woven through the entire book amen amen now our god wrote the the the bible says that there are two things that god did before the foundation of the world there's two things he did before before one blade of grass ever grew on this earth before the before the sun ever shined before the animals ever roamed upon this earth before anything like that there's there's two things the bible says that god did before the foundation of the world one is that he took a lamb and he slew it for the foundation of the world amen the other thing that he did before the foundation of the world is that he wrote a book called life and he put a bunch of names on the inside amen before one blade of grass now this this book called life he he he he he he now first of all you know he when you look at a book you have to kind of wonder is the man that wrote the book is he qualified to write about it and so when you think about the book called life well who wrote it well god wrote it well is god qualified to write about life amen well yeah he's the author of life he is not just the creator of life but he is like amen he is actually the only life amen he's the one that gave life hallelujah if there is life on this world it came from god amen he is the only one that can give life amen he is the life giver amen so he is well qualified to write the book of life amen and so if there is only and there's only one form of life that's the life of the lord jesus christ eternal life is jesus christ amen amen jesus christ is eternal life if he gives you eternal life he is giving you of his own life amen a part of him because that's who he is he is eternal life amen so when god decided to to to write a book about life he is writing about his own life amen he wasn't writing about somebody else's life because nothing else had life he was the only one that had life so when he wrote a book called life he was writing about his own life amen and that life is is is it's who he is it's how he thinks it's what he expresses it's what he wants to be it's the that life is who he is amen life is what you any person you say oh he lived for 70 years and then he died well what'd he do with his life what did he do and that he with his life he expressed who he was what his spirit was what his nature natural every man does that every woman does that she expresses he expresses who he is because the life that was in him they expressed throughout their age with all their life and then by the end they have you know like now they have the celebration of life ceremonies instead of funerals you know and then that's what they call them nowadays instead of a funeral why because they're celebrating the life that the person had amen and they and they and they remember what they did with the life that they were given every man and woman on this earth is given a portion of life to do whatever you want to do with it if you do it to serve god's purpose you're expressing that you have the eternal life of god if you do not serve god's purpose and you're expressing that that life doesn't belong to you and that life will be taken away from you that's right that which you seem to have will be taken away the bible says amen their names they blow it off not from the lands book of life but from the book of life amen so god when he wrote this life he wasn't writing about somebody's what wrote this book he wasn't writing about somebody else's life he's writing about his own life amen now how can the almighty eternal ever powerful god that is eternal that is infinite how can he express himself down here in this three-dimensional world how can he express himself to the human race how can he reveal his life upon the earth how can he reveal his life to us how could he write a book that would express his life so when he so when god began to write this book he just instead of writing a bunch of flowerly language or a bunch of deep thoughts or things like that or a bunch of doctrines or rules to live by he opened up the book and he just started writing names these are the names that are going to express my life upon the earth he started writing adam moses each name he wrote that that when that life when that name when that person appeared and was named over them your name shall be moses amen and moses as he grew up the spirit of a god was upon him to express the portion of god's life that he was here on this earth to express and now by by reviewing the life of moses we begin to see jesus christ showing up and we say oh moses was typing out christ when he did this oh moses was typing out christ when he did that and he began to see little expressions throughout his life that we see god and moses why can we see god and moses why because he had his portion on the land's book of life he was expressing the life of god upon this earth how did he do it because the spirit of god was with him the spirit of god was upon him the spirit of god was leaving him amen and as he lived you know to be 150 years old or however long he lived amen by the end of his days when his days upon this earth was done amen we look back at the years of his life and he was expressing the attributes of almighty all-powerful jehovah god through his living upon this earth his life journey is over but his but that spirit that was upon him was so powerful that men and women have been changed by that ministry the spirit of god has moved and moving and has left a trail out throughout all history amen and every time he lands upon someone you know as god wrote their name upon the lamb's book of life and then when that little that little being arrives on the earth amen and the spirit of god moves across their path also in this light shines the light of the gospel shines upon and they spring up and they begin bringing up their attributes of jesus christ they begin to see in joshua and joseph and moses and in mary and everywhere and then paul and peter they began to see expressions of jesus christ and all these believers because they were their names were written upon the life of god and god was expressing his life to the world through these men and women amen amen and he did not stop at the in a.d 30. he did not stop in 1860 he did not stop in ad-90 amen the book was written before the foundation of the world amen but there's still names that are upon that book that are being expressed even to our day amen and when you are born here upon this earth and when they cry out that name that you have amen that's given unto you amen and remember god has a new name for you that's it's in glory amen not a new name but it is a but that is not necessarily a new name for you amen but is what the the the perfection of what he expressed for you that name is this great sum of his thoughts towards you amen as so as david said in the psalms how great is the sum of his thoughts towards me though some of his thoughts is completely encapsulated in the book of life amen when you come upon this earth and you begin walking in the holy spirit you are walking in god's thoughts towards you amen you begin to do things that you didn't think you would ever do you began expressing things you didn't think you could say they may you be insane things you didn't think you could ever say you began singing things you didn't think you could sing i mean you could be in testifying testimonies you didn't ever get tested give testimony to you begin to be changed from image unto from glory into glory you begin to be changed into his image why because he wrote about his life and he has given you the solemn duty not just the duty but the opportunity to express the life of god upon this earth by the power of the holy ghost and he has how great is the sum of his thoughts those thoughts are there amen and the thoughts that he had for you from zero to three are different than the thoughts that he had for you from age three to six the thoughts he had from you from age 18 to 21 are different than the thoughts he has from you from age 28 to 31 amen or 28-35 each age of your life there's a different maturity in christ amen that you are to express the life of christ david says i was yo i was young but now i am old but never have i seen god forsake his his seed upon the earth amen amen god has his thoughts towards you they've got changed they're the they've been laying there since before the foundation of the world they think lord why am i here what is my purpose in the church what am i doing here you know you you if you just come here and try to to make your your so many thousand dollars a year and up until the day you retire and die well there's no point in that we didn't come here to do that amen we came here to express the thoughts that god ordained for us to express that we only do it by the leadership of the holy ghost again no one else can express your thoughts no one else can express what god wrote that you would express there is a portion of god that you are you yourself are here upon this world to express amen you here are you are the body of christ you are his head you know you are you are the portion of his body you are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone filleth his holy spirit amen and he has given you a portion of himself to express here upon the earth and he ordained it for you before the foundation of the world amen oh you might get into your your your moments like brother man talked about uh john the baptist says eagle eye got filmed over amen you know the same thing happens to the bride of christ they spend their time their dull moments you know they and they their their eye gets filmed over and they forget the purp the purpose for which they're here to express the very purpose for which they're here to to be upon this earth amen but god brings a revival upon them amen sometimes he'll bring trials on you sometimes he brings a desperation upon you because that desperation is how he gets you right back to where he needs to be amen brother rich he was talking about brother isaiah's sermon the other day about god brings stress upon you to get you to be where you ought to be at the first to to and to allow you to become who you ought to be amen we go through times our lives of great stress but it causes us at the end of that trial to be more than we thought we could be why because now we are expressing god's thoughts and maturity amen amen let's turn over to psalm 61 verse 3. i'm sorry isaiah 61 3. now we'll oh i should start with verse one here we're going to read the first or the third verse and just my thoughts on this was what is the motive and the purpose of these three verses what is god doing here it says the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meat he has sent me to brine up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to point unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for that spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord and here's the motive that he might be glorified that jehovah might be glorified amen amen amen because the spirit of the lord god cannot be glorified when when when the brokenhearted are are still broken-hearted amen amen god cannot be glorified while you're they're still in the prison amen amen when you are still captive to your sins god is not being glorified amen that's not the glory and when you're still they're bound in prison but it's when the those that are bound to prison when they're when they're the prison is open to them that's when god is glorified amen that's when the testimony comes when those that are sick amen are healed that's when the glory comes that's when god is glorified i was sick but god came and he healed me amen so the spirit of the lord god comes amen to what to bring people out from where they were to raise them up to a higher place why so that god might be glorified how is god can be glorified through the life of christ being expressed through you amen every every type of christ throughout all the old testament every person that we can look back and say moses was the type of christ or joseph was the type of christ every single one of them that we look at if we look at him closely they suffered because of who they were amen they suffered because they were types of christ as they were expressing the life of christ on the inside they came with great sufferings amen they were thrown into prison they were falsely accused they were sawn asunder they were they were driven from city to city because they were expressing christ on this world and it came with great suffering amen amen you know the bride of christ has her period of suffering and when we have our time of trial amen but when the trial is over we shall wear a crown amen when the end has come we shall wear a crown amen amen in the new jerusalem how why because how great is the sum of his thoughts towards us the things that he has thought about us is not for us to stay sick but for us to be healed not for us to stay bound but to be set free not for us to stay in prison but for the prison to be open that's the sum of his thoughts amen the sum of his thoughts is not for us to live here on earth until we retire he was about to take a body change to reign with him upon his throne the sum of his thoughts has us sitting there in heavenly places in christ jesus the th the sum of his thoughts has us living there in the peace of the almighty god amen i come to to to to give you rest amen amen i come that you ask abundantly so that your joy might be full these are the sum of his thoughts towards you i come that you might might have rest i come to you might sit with me in my throne and i and if i come again i will receive you unto myself amen amen that's the sum of his thoughts towards us amen amen just in closing i'm not i won't be long my voice isn't doing very good this morning and uh you know the healing power is coming i'm waiting for it amen let's turn over to first corinthians chapter two just here in closing it's funny because i just listened to a sermon just two weeks ago and i was surprised because i i never caught it before i heard brother branham coughing throughout the sermon and i was like oh he must have had a little cold or something when he preached that one that i'd never heard it before and then right after that i got this little cough and i said now i'm doing the exact same thing and i just thought that was a little the timing of it was so unique amen and we go through our hard trials in the nature and we in the natural we wonder well why does this happen to me in the natural but we're not here to look at the natural things of this world we're here to be spiritually minded amen first corinthians chapter 2. verse 9 says but as it is written eye hath not seen nor is the year hurt neither have entered into the heart of man the things that god has prepared for them that love him god has prepared something for you we haven't maybe seen all of it yet it hasn't all been revealed to us yet we all haven't caught the revelation of exactly what god has for us we maybe haven't seen a vision of it with our eye maybe we haven't you know caught the vision of it in our spirits amen but god has prepared something for us amen let's read the next verse verse 10 there and it says but god hath revealed them unto us oh so the eye hasn't seen the ear has not heard it it hasn't entered into the heart of man but now here in verse 10 but god has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god amen so as you get into the spirit of god then you begin to catch the revelation not just of the things of the nature but you begin to become a mystic to the world you begin to get heavenly minded and you begin to realize that the things that some of god's thoughts are you taught are great towards you and they are an inheritance they belong to you the title deed of your walk from here to the rapture the title deed of that walk already belongs to you it's yours and the holy spirit when it moves upon you it moves you to walk in the predestinated plan that god has for you amen he for ordained for you to walk in the presence of god before the foundation of the world it's yours amen he paid the price we pay the price to get out of his will but he has already paid the price to get right back in the will of god amen he's paid the price for you if you find yourself outside this will outside the spirit of god amen you find yourself outside of the will of god if you find yourself outside the walk of god the blood has been shed to get you right back to where you belong where you always were meant to be so that you can go back to expressing jesus christ here on this earth we were born for this hour we were born for this walk we were born to live this life the life of christ that god has given us right we're born for it's ours it's our inheritance the title deed pay the price for it amen hallelujah it's the size the arms of faith to take a hold of it and say lord i am going to walk in your presence i am going to walk in your spirit it's mine you paid for it i don't know lord maybe i don't know how to do it but i'm just going to walk in elias he is in the light amen and he'll show me the way amen amen amen let's just stand thy word is a lamp under my feet and a light unto my path amen amen amen amen
