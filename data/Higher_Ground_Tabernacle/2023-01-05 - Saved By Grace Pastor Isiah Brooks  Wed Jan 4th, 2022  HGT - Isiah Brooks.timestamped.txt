[0:00] where there's a bloody bleeding word of
[0:02] God that God has given to us and this
[0:05] unveiling of this message is given to
[0:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ Alone she sees
[0:10] it she understands it and she's moving
[0:14] forward somebody says the bride's
[0:16] Revival where the bride is in a Revival
[0:19] uh everybody that claimed to be bride is
[0:22] not but the true bride of Jesus Christ
[0:24] is in a Revival God is pulling on her
[0:28] and moving her into a position that
[0:32] she has no idea
[0:35] of where she's headed
[0:37] because we have not traveled this way
[0:41] before
[0:42] and we are a blessed people because
[0:45] we're going to see
[0:47] why those seals were
[0:50] sealed or locked
[0:53] and and there was they were locked for a
[0:55] purpose
[0:56] it was to keep away the very essence of
[1:00] God's inheritance from Satan because
[1:03] Satan comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:07] but mind you in every age God protected
[1:11] the seed of that age and he saved them
[1:16] all by grace
[1:18] and you and I must understand by the
[1:20] grace of God how powerful this is
[1:23] because when God said that he that begun
[1:26] the good work in you is faithful to
[1:28] complete it
[1:29] it proves to us that we are not the ones
[1:32] who are completing it it is God who is
[1:35] completing his his job his business this
[1:38] is God's business
[1:40] but we must understand
[1:42] that Grace and law cannot abide
[1:45] in the same place
[1:47] and when the seals were open so many
[1:51] things happened during that time that
[1:53] even the men of that age did not see all
[1:56] that God was doing but as we have
[1:59] traveled from 63 all the way up to this
[2:02] day we're beginning to see our
[2:05] inheritance and what was literally
[2:08] laying in the word of God all of these
[2:10] years and we couldn't even see it
[2:13] because God had our our eyes holding
[2:16] unto this day until this hour and this
[2:20] was given to a special class of people
[2:23] that God foreordained before the
[2:25] foundation of the world the world may
[2:28] have looked upon us as being scum and
[2:30] rejects but in the eyes of God he chose
[2:34] us to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:37] this thing that I'm talking about
[2:40] the seals were blocking
[2:43] it was the blocking of God for each age
[2:45] it was the thing that was hidden because
[2:48] you know Satan
[2:49] in his own mind was thinking he was
[2:52] getting the victory over God's
[2:54] inheritance and all alone God was
[2:57] defeating Satan on his grounds
[3:01] now when they were open we we they were
[3:04] open that we might see The Inheritance
[3:06] it has always been about inheritance
[3:09] when you go down into the Genesis you'll
[3:12] find out that the whole battle between
[3:14] Cain and Abel was about inheritance of
[3:17] the battle between Jacob and Esau it was
[3:19] about inheritance the battle amen
[3:22] between Judas and Jesus was about about
[3:24] inheritance if you look at it you'll
[3:27] find out that it's the devil who came to
[3:30] take the inheritance of of God's people
[3:32] The Inheritance away from them but he
[3:35] failed to see that that God saw the
[3:38] program way before it happened and the
[3:40] Bible said that God put our names in the
[3:42] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[3:44] foundation of the world you see what
[3:47] belongs to us could never become come to
[3:50] Devils of the devil right it's God who
[3:54] gave us these things it's our day and
[3:58] this is our time and I think that we
[4:01] need to do with all all that we have
[4:03] within us to redeem that time this is
[4:05] Lord here we are
[4:08] everything is moving
[4:10] and everything is moving by the power of
[4:13] God
[4:14] you know the Bible talks about the
[4:16] fullness and I haven't finished that
[4:18] message but I just started on at the
[4:20] until the cup of the the the fullness of
[4:22] the amorites
[4:24] and I I did do a little studying on the
[4:26] amorites and I found out they amorites
[4:28] uh was a mingling people they filtrated
[4:31] almost every culture and they were
[4:34] people who were a people of control they
[4:37] were people who would move into a
[4:39] situation and basically uh gain control
[4:43] and manipulate systems to their
[4:46] advantage
[4:47] and the Bible talks about it how you
[4:50] know the the fullness of the amorites we
[4:52] we fully didn't understand but what now
[4:54] we're seeing in the government and all
[4:57] over the world is that the amorites has
[4:59] taken their position and they have
[5:02] influenced everybody and this is why the
[5:05] enemy uh God told us uh Israel kill them
[5:08] all killed them all if you let them live
[5:12] they will become thorns in your flesh
[5:14] and so now we see by the grace of God
[5:16] that what this is all about that the
[5:20] amoritis is now in position where
[5:22] they're changing the laws manipulating
[5:25] even in the church World in so much so
[5:28] amen that this place and this place that
[5:31] we're living in is almost to a place
[5:33] where God's full full of judgment amen
[5:38] is about to fall
[5:39] is that right uh because you got to
[5:42] realize amen that these spirits that
[5:44] we're working with has already
[5:49] been ordained to do what they're doing
[5:52] Hallelujah but in the midst of all of
[5:55] this Darkness there still is God's
[5:58] Amazing Grace
[6:00] Hallelujah because there is no way to
[6:02] escape them
[6:04] amen they have branches they have names
[6:08] and we don't know who these people are
[6:10] but we can see them now
[6:13] amen some of them because they were on
[6:16] stage
[6:17] but where is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[6:20] let's move on
[6:22] we realize by God's grace so all of
[6:25] these things have been locked up into
[6:26] the word word and and and we understand
[6:29] that the The Inheritance it just seems
[6:33] like uh uh uh this is why the Bible says
[6:37] if the princes of this world knew who
[6:40] Jesus was they would not have crucified
[6:43] him amen because he was the very essence
[6:47] of the inheritance of God everything
[6:50] that was in him he was the title deed
[6:53] himself he was God himself he was a
[6:56] ruler of mankind heaven and in Earth and
[7:00] so we realized amen that when he died
[7:03] amen he he he broke himself up into 120
[7:07] pieces right little pillars of fire and
[7:11] he did something he had never done in
[7:13] all of history
[7:15] he filled
[7:17] mankind he changed their nature he
[7:22] created
[7:23] a new generation of people hallelujah
[7:27] and you know people thought it was about
[7:29] all shouting and dancing and all no no
[7:32] they shouted they danced because they
[7:34] were changed Hallelujah from All
[7:37] Creatures to new creatures Hallelujah
[7:40] and they began to identify and
[7:42] understand who they were because we were
[7:45] for a long time they saw the Messiah
[7:47] they saw the Messiah the Messiah was
[7:49] with them but something changed when the
[7:52] Messiah came in them Hallelujah and then
[7:56] they recognized their relationship with
[7:58] the Messiah amen they understood when he
[8:02] called them Brethren amen they
[8:04] understood amen His Amazing Grace and
[8:07] they understood
[8:08] that nothing could separate them
[8:11] from this love of God
[8:14] grace shall always abound
[8:17] you and I realize amen even in the first
[8:19] seal when when that white horse rider
[8:22] began to ride
[8:24] it looked like innocence
[8:27] it was so religious and
[8:30] but it was deadly
[8:32] because what the the white heart it was
[8:34] it was just the the anointing
[8:37] of what rode on that horse right it was
[8:42] a he had he had no bow he had a bow but
[8:46] he had no arrows and you see that's the
[8:49] way the devil does every seed must bring
[8:52] forth its kind
[8:54] you see what I'm saying and it was Seas
[8:57] of the devil that had already been
[8:59] planted within the church and that the
[9:02] same anointing that anointed amen God's
[9:07] seed anointed the other sea to bring
[9:11] forth of his kind
[9:14] religious
[9:15] is that right another Cain and Abel was
[9:19] born
[9:20] and it was religious and it looked so
[9:22] innocent but in his character it was a
[9:27] murderer
[9:28] y'all hear what I'm saying and what that
[9:31] little white horse and this is why I try
[9:33] to tell people even now that white horse
[9:36] is still riding among message churches
[9:41] and because what the White Horse did it
[9:44] removed the hardship of the Holy Ghost
[9:47] and made men the headship
[9:51] of other men
[9:53] and it was never to be that way God
[9:57] always wanted to be the head of his
[10:00] church Hallelujah is that right because
[10:03] the deed became a Doctrine and the
[10:06] doctrine became a man and then the Man
[10:08] became a murderer
[10:11] Hallelujah now mind you when you talk up
[10:14] when you think about the simple
[10:15] symbolism of all of that it was people
[10:19] that this anointed this anointing
[10:22] anointed
[10:24] that's right it was seeds that was
[10:26] already planted among the two Christians
[10:30] is that right and what did it produce
[10:33] murderers
[10:35] Brothers hating each other
[10:39] is that the Bible and the Bible said if
[10:41] you can't love your brother you are a
[10:43] murderer where is he taking that from
[10:45] all the way from Genesis Cain and Abel
[10:49] Hallelujah and you'll find that this
[10:53] thing has become such a religious thing
[10:55] and it's become so common
[10:58] and people are accepting it
[11:01] they're being can I say it like this
[11:04] what we call Christianity has become the
[11:07] deception to Christians
[11:11] I'll say it again
[11:13] what we call Christianity has become the
[11:17] deception to Christians
[11:19] Hallelujah because you can only be a
[11:22] Christian if you're born of the word
[11:24] amen amen amen hallelujah it's nothing
[11:27] but the truth a friend of mine was
[11:30] talking to me you know he had seen a
[11:32] movie and this movie was really bad in
[11:35] the sense that it the way it betrayed
[11:37] Christianity and I told him I said
[11:38] listen
[11:41] that's not Christianity
[11:44] that's a business called Christianity
[11:47] it's not Christianity
[11:49] Christianity produces Christ
[11:52] I said and what you see there cannot be
[11:56] placed within the word
[11:58] because Amy is that right the Old
[12:01] Testament New Testament saying says
[12:03] Silver and Gold Have a number such as I
[12:05] have give ID and now you see these
[12:08] people with rose roses and all of this
[12:11] fabulous clothing and you name it
[12:14] they've got it
[12:17] come on I said that ain't Christ
[12:21] I say just like our country poses as a
[12:24] country when it's no longer a country
[12:27] it's a business
[12:30] that's all America has become a business
[12:34] now they're saying it because that's
[12:37] what it really is
[12:39] it looks so innocent
[12:41] but look where it's going now
[12:44] even among our own ranks men are ruling
[12:48] other men
[12:49] ruling the church telling them who to
[12:52] marry tell them who you can't marrying
[12:55] all of those kinds of stuff
[13:01] it's the truth
[13:04] it's got so sad amen that you know
[13:07] people even in this message who are now
[13:10] in churches in America amen instead of
[13:13] paying their ties to the people the
[13:15] pastor in the church here they send it
[13:16] back home
[13:18] that's a system
[13:19] that's has nothing to do with the word
[13:22] it's wrong
[13:24] but men allow other men to rule them
[13:28] instead of letting the word rule them
[13:31] now that wasn't even in my notes
[13:34] but the point is
[13:36] amen we must understand what this grace
[13:39] is
[13:40] Grace is God's gift
[13:43] to give us eyes to see
[13:46] the difference between the system
[13:50] and His Holy Spirit
[13:52] y'all understand what I'm saying and
[13:55] they that are led by this
[13:59] you know the spirit of God uh they are
[14:02] the sons of God not they that are led by
[14:05] men
[14:07] you understand me oh come on somebody
[14:09] it's nothing but the truth
[14:12] it's so bad if this path will say oh you
[14:15] can't fellowship with those over there
[14:19] they won't do it
[14:21] and Jews said any brother who causes
[14:24] division is seemingly that that they
[14:27] have the Holy Ghost they don't even have
[14:30] the Holy Ghost
[14:35] Fellowship comes by the baptism of the
[14:38] Holy Ghost
[14:39] Hallelujah wherever he leads me I will
[14:43] follow
[14:44] because being right with God it does not
[14:47] always appear to be righteous
[14:49] and let me explain that to you
[14:52] the Pharisees were righteous
[14:55] is that right but Jesus was right
[14:59] huh God told him to go and watch let
[15:03] that woman wash his feet
[15:05] to the Pharisees that was not righteous
[15:10] but who was more right and it was Jesus
[15:14] who was being led by the Holy Spirit to
[15:16] allow that woman to wash her feet his
[15:19] feet is that right let's go to another
[15:22] place what about Jesus at the well
[15:25] talking to her to a Samaritan woman
[15:28] in the eyes of the viewer he would have
[15:31] looked unrighteous
[15:33] but he was right
[15:35] see what makes us different is that
[15:37] we're not concerned about righteousness
[15:39] we're concerned about being right
[15:42] wherever he lead me I will follow
[15:46] I do his will oh God I come to do his
[15:49] will it's not about whether you like me
[15:51] doing what I'm doing if I'm doing what
[15:54] God wants me to do I could care less
[15:56] about what anybody else is thinking
[15:58] about it
[16:00] amen This is Amazing Grace
[16:04] when God gives you Grace to hear his
[16:06] voice
[16:08] and to know that he's directing you and
[16:10] leading you to do
[16:12] what what you're doing
[16:15] is that right
[16:17] oh it's true
[16:19] is that right
[16:21] I think it was Paul they said oh Paul
[16:23] you can't go there
[16:24] but Paul said uh God told me to go there
[16:27] you see what I'm saying in the in their
[16:29] eyes even a believer was looking at it
[16:32] in a different way can I say it like
[16:35] this it's like it's like um
[16:37] when the disciples
[16:40] I think it was uh Matthias
[16:42] they chose Matthias it looked like the
[16:45] righteous thing to do
[16:47] they needed 12 and they only had 11 now
[16:50] so they voted
[16:53] cashed Lots and even though it looked
[16:57] righteous it was not right
[17:01] because it wasn't Matthias that was to
[17:03] be the next Apostle Paul comes along
[17:05] says I'm the one
[17:07] God chose me
[17:09] and so regardless and you know what you
[17:11] never hear anything else about Matthias
[17:14] Hallelujah but when God chooses you he
[17:18] puts you in a place where your gift make
[17:20] room for you
[17:23] and nobody can deny it
[17:26] amen hallelujah
[17:30] think about it
[17:32] those 10 spies they went to
[17:34] oh to spy out the land
[17:39] and they come back and say we can't do
[17:41] it
[17:42] let me tell you something this message
[17:43] will exceed extremely hard to you
[17:47] when you like the understanding of Grace
[17:50] and Grace is the unmerited love for you
[17:54] he chose you
[17:56] he ordained you Hallelujah this way is a
[18:00] harder way because you know what your
[18:01] biggest enemy is you you understand me
[18:04] you gotta fight this thing wants to
[18:08] appear righteous before God
[18:10] this thing and the Bible says amen that
[18:14] this thing is like filthy rash don't
[18:17] even put trust in your flesh you
[18:20] understand me this thing will fail you
[18:23] when you need it the most but God will
[18:27] never fail
[18:28] Hallelujah and Grace covers every
[18:32] mistake you make
[18:34] Hallelujah is that right do you really
[18:37] think that you were so holy and so
[18:39] righteous what because that's the reason
[18:42] why God gave you the Holy Ghost
[18:44] absolutely not it was God chose you it
[18:48] was God's favor toward you and none of
[18:52] us can boast on it
[18:56] nobody
[18:58] God accepted you
[19:00] why because he knew you before the
[19:03] foundation of the world
[19:06] Hallelujah this thing has nothing to do
[19:09] with time
[19:10] Hallelujah don't the devil fight your
[19:13] mind sometime oh God will I make the
[19:15] Rapture oh look at me I'm such in bad
[19:18] shape how can I make the Rapture hey
[19:20] you'll be in bad shape when the Rapture
[19:22] take place
[19:23] the only thing God is going to see is
[19:25] the blood he'll see his life in you and
[19:29] that's what takes you it's not this old
[19:31] sinful flesh amen
[19:36] Hallelujah
[19:38] that's nothing but the truth Joshua and
[19:41] Caleb said steal the people
[19:43] we're more than able to take it
[19:46] because God promised it to us and I
[19:48] don't care what the opposition is
[19:53] somebody help me here you see because
[19:55] what it was it was the people who
[19:58] described the Giants
[20:00] it was the people who described
[20:02] themselves
[20:04] is that right the Giants were just
[20:07] Giants
[20:08] but to the people that says we're like
[20:10] grasshoppers
[20:11] and and you and I must understand by
[20:14] God's grace amen what are you what are
[20:16] you what do you see yourself as being
[20:19] I tell you what Joshua and Caleb saw
[20:22] themselves just as big as God was
[20:25] Hallelujah you understand me and that's
[20:29] what we must begin to see we're just as
[20:31] big as God because God is in US
[20:36] man don't see yourself something less oh
[20:39] you I can't do it I can't make it but
[20:42] that was already established before you
[20:45] got saved that's why it took Grace the
[20:48] savior because there was nothing you
[20:50] could produce on your own that could
[20:52] Merit the grace of God
[20:57] in this last day we need to just just
[21:00] step up to the bat
[21:01] and stop thinking so carnal in our minds
[21:05] we need to be transformed
[21:08] by what the renewing this is what the
[21:11] message is all about this is not a
[21:13] Pentecostal message to make us feel like
[21:16] we can jump and shout all of that's good
[21:18] but it's beyond all of that it's now
[21:22] being filled with the character of
[21:24] Christ and and trusting his way of
[21:27] leadership above all
[21:32] Satan Weaponry one of his biggest
[21:34] weaponries is fear
[21:37] fear I'm not going to make it in fear I
[21:40] can't do it and fear fear fear you know
[21:43] we ought to question fear doubt feel
[21:45] like we doubt faith
[21:47] foreign
[21:49] doubts
[21:52] you know Satan where is fear
[21:55] right he always make you think and and
[21:58] that's that's the thing you know he he
[22:00] twists things so badly you know when you
[22:03] get sick the first thing he almost want
[22:05] to put on you is because of something
[22:07] you've done wrong
[22:09] he never tells you well you know you're
[22:11] sick because God wants some communion
[22:13] with you oh God wants fellowship with it
[22:16] he never tells you that you know you've
[22:18] gone through something because God want
[22:19] to get closer to your a God is building
[22:21] you into Perfection he never tells you
[22:24] that he'll tell you curse and remember
[22:27] when you did this remember when you did
[22:29] that and you said but you know what I
[22:31] may write
[22:34] see
[22:37] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost give what
[22:41] power and that power is Authority that
[22:45] power gives you end of a sound mind
[22:48] right we're not double-minded
[22:52] that's what the Bible said the
[22:53] devil-minded man is unstable in all his
[22:55] ways that means you got two Spirits
[22:58] working in your spirit your spirit in
[23:01] the devil's spirit
[23:03] Spirit of unbelief in the spirit of
[23:05] Faith they can't work together
[23:08] hallelujah it's like a tug of war
[23:12] Hallelujah but you've got to overcome
[23:15] that unbelief
[23:17] that double-mindedness and and put your
[23:20] put it under your feet
[23:22] you want God to bless you
[23:25] be tried and tested
[23:27] and still praise him
[23:30] yeah we we be tired trying to wonder
[23:33] what God is doing Just Praise Him
[23:36] and all things give thanks praise him

[23:56] and he knows the path in which he takes
[23:58] you
[24:00] it's the thief Satan himself
[24:03] that cometh not but to steal
[24:06] and to kill and destroy and everything
[24:09] that God has given you how much you've
[24:11] allowed him to destroy

[24:19] messages on New Year take that with the
[24:22] devil and stole from you

[24:27] land
[24:28] and God gave us this land
[24:32] if he wanted to leave us out there with
[24:34] all of the rock and roll and all of the
[24:36] uh seducing spirits and everything else
[24:39] he would have left us out there but he
[24:41] called us into a holy place a place
[24:44] where we could stay in that that
[24:46] fellowship with him amen and grow into
[24:50] him what do you want to become oh oh I

[25:00] ambition should be I want to become like
[25:03] him I want to be in His image I seek ye
[25:07] first I seek first the righteousness of
[25:10] God and if anything else be added so let
[25:12] it be but my whole heart is to be like
[25:17] him
[25:19] that's what I've been called for that's
[25:21] what you've been called to do it's not
[25:24] about being part of this when you know
[25:26] everything is going to perish
[25:27] Hallelujah and if God should Grant you
[25:30] riches thank God for the riches
[25:33] but your goal is to be like him don't be
[25:37] deceived
[25:41] what good it was to do there's people
[25:43] out there with all kinds of money and
[25:45] clothing and everything else and their
[25:47] perverts
[25:50] they they got so much they don't even
[25:52] know what to do with it
[25:56] the thief cometh but to to steal and to
[25:59] kill and destroy I come that they might
[26:02] have life and that they might have it
[26:05] more what abundantly
[26:10] oh Jesus
[26:12] now let me I wonder how you Define life
[26:16] you know the world Defined Life with
[26:18] partying in and this is life
[26:21] that's not life
[26:23] that's death then we need to find out
[26:27] what life is
[26:29] life is God
[26:31] as the president life is the Lord Jesus
[26:34] and if I could get abundance of him and
[26:37] me that's what I want I want an
[26:39] abundance
[26:40] of his life in me
[26:43] Hallelujah so much so that I can defeat
[26:49] Temptations
[26:54] Jesus defeated Temptations
[27:00] is that right and if that be the case
[27:03] the same holy spirit that was in him is
[27:06] in us and we can defeat Temptations
[27:14] Hallelujah talking about the seed of
[27:16] discrepancy we've got so much of it
[27:20] the prophet God says now we lived
[27:22] through Luther's age and we've lived
[27:24] through Wesleyan age and methods of this
[27:25] age all down Through the Ages and the
[27:28] Pentecostal age and each age is given a
[27:31] promise of the word did they fulfill
[27:33] their promise you better believe they
[27:35] did had not they done it we wouldn't be
[27:38] here today
[27:39] and the people of that age
[27:42] that listen the people of that age that
[27:47] manifested that promised word is the
[27:50] seed of that age y'all hear what I'm
[27:53] saying we're in the broad age if you
[27:56] don't manifest
[27:58] the word for this day you're not right
[28:01] you're not true seed because that seed
[28:05] of whatever age you're in or day to be
[28:08] will manifest yourself
[28:10] Hallelujah that's right
[28:13] it's the seed of that age according to
[28:15] what Jesus said right here they are the
[28:18] children of the Kingdom that's right
[28:22] that manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[28:24] operating through his children is those
[28:27] seeds of the kingdom of that age
[28:32] see so you can follow the message
[28:37] is that right and you can know the
[28:40] messenger
[28:41] but it doesn't mean your seed
[28:44] y'all hear what it was Joshua and Caleb
[28:48] they manifested the seed of their age
[28:52] and everything else that did not know
[28:54] what was it because the Bible said they
[28:56] had a new spirit they saw behind the
[29:00] veil of Moses and they knew that was God
[29:02] that was there
[29:03] they came in Union with it
[29:07] so they understood that the god of Moses
[29:09] wasn't dead
[29:11] it was he was still alive
[29:15] living in them
[29:17] and I love that testimony when they had
[29:20] conquered the land that says oh like
[29:22] Caleb said I'm I was young and now I'm
[29:24] old
[29:26] my inheritance I won my Mountain that's
[29:29] what I'm saying now I'm not I'm not I'm
[29:32] not satisfied with just church entity
[29:37] or even allowing I'm just not going to
[29:39] allow myself to be deceived by
[29:41] Christianity
[29:43] a system
[29:45] Hallelujah when God has broken the Veil
[29:50] and I can see Jesus
[29:53] Hallelujah
[29:55] Ephesians 2 4-10 says but God who is
[29:58] rich in Mercy for his great love
[30:00] wherewith he loved us
[30:03] even when we were dead in sin have
[30:05] quickened us together with Christ by
[30:09] Grace ye are saved and have raised us up
[30:13] together and made us sit together in
[30:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[30:19] that in the age to come he might show
[30:22] what in the age to come what age you
[30:25] talking about
[30:27] Paul is talking about this age
[30:30] right in the ages to come it moved it
[30:35] moved and moved and now we've come to
[30:37] the finale
[30:39] what good
[30:41] uh would we be if if if Jesus would not
[30:44] return
[30:46] hey
[30:48] what good would it be
[30:50] and the thing about it is every time he
[30:53] returns most people don't see it
[30:58] it's always been mysterious
[31:01] it always will be mysterious
[31:04] Hallelujah is that right it's nothing
[31:07] but the truth
[31:09] and God always gives us Mysteries to
[31:14] ourselves personally that others don't
[31:16] do not receive
[31:20] have you ever seen God say Abraham there
[31:24] is a city
[31:25] whose building maker is God where did he
[31:28] say it in the scripture
[31:30] huh by his revelation
[31:35] gave him understanding that there was a
[31:37] city
[31:39] how what Revelation he met the king of
[31:42] the city
[31:45] so he understood that there was a king
[31:47] there had to be a kingdom there had to
[31:49] be a city and the Bible said his whole
[31:52] life he's looking for a city whose
[31:55] Builder and maker was God
[31:57] you'll never find it where he spoke to
[31:59] Abraham that there is a city or whatever
[32:02] no it's not there but the revelation
[32:05] that we're not feasting on
[32:08] was given to Abraham
[32:10] nobody else could see it
[32:13] Hallelujah you know Abraham couldn't
[32:16] choose Sodom and Kamar he's looking for
[32:17] a city who's building making with God
[32:21] Hallelujah
[32:23] is that right
[32:24] and you and I meet we don't understand
[32:26] it but there are Revelations there are
[32:28] things there are Inspirations and things
[32:29] that God gives the believer that he
[32:32] doesn't give other people that's why we
[32:34] have a joy that's why we have a peace
[32:36] while everybody else is struggling with
[32:38] things and you say well I don't
[32:39] understand it no
[32:42] foreign
[32:44] this is the day we're living in
[32:47] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[32:50] listen
[32:51] even when we were dead in sin have
[32:53] quickened us together with Christ by
[32:55] Grace you are saved and have raised us
[32:57] up excuse me
[33:00] together and made us sit together in
[33:02] Heavenly places where in Christ Jesus
[33:05] where are you setting in Heavenly places
[33:11] that that's something something that's
[33:13] that's powerful to me where in the
[33:17] Christ Jesus I'm in him
[33:19] you're in him
[33:22] that in the ages to come he might show
[33:25] the exceeding Riches of his grace in his
[33:28] kingdom toward us through Christ and we
[33:31] who are Gentiles are to be forever
[33:33] rejoicing
[33:36] a wild Vine grafted into the real one
[33:42] Dogs We Were
[33:46] and yet God God's grace
[33:50] found us
[33:53] Jesus have mercy and you think well look
[33:56] at this time and this let me tell y'all
[33:58] something I want you to look around and
[34:01] you see all the people who are Islams
[34:03] and Muslims and Buddhists and all of
[34:06] this kind of stuff and then you say well
[34:07] I'm a Christian so you feel safe
[34:10] you feel safe because you can say I'm a
[34:13] Christian
[34:14] everything that called himself
[34:15] Christians are not Christians
[34:18] and what we call Christianity is not
[34:20] Christianity
[34:21] the Bible calls all Hall
[34:25] Mr Babylon the Great
[34:28] yes all of these churches
[34:31] and if you're not careful you'll be a
[34:33] part of that same system and the Bible
[34:36] said there's a cage of unclean and
[34:38] hateful Birds
[34:39] sound familiar
[34:41] even Among Us
[34:44] The Same Spirit of Cain and Abel
[34:49] killing your Brothers Without a Cause
[34:52] backbiting backstabbing and speaking
[34:56] evil of preachers and all that kind of
[34:58] stuff and none of that's God
[35:01] can't be
[35:05] is that right and brother Venom said if
[35:08] you can't speak something good about a
[35:09] person don't speak nothing at all that's
[35:11] something we must all learn
[35:18] killing
[35:19] even among ourselves
[35:25] watch the political move
[35:28] we have that even in this little
[35:30] assembly a little patch of pocket of
[35:32] politics
[35:35] and they think I'm blind
[35:39] but I see it moving
[35:42] but they've been ordained
[35:44] to do exactly what they're doing
[35:49] like they said I ain't scared
[35:53] because I realize who I'm following
[35:58] right let these people be the Bible said
[36:00] let them grow together
[36:05] see because I don't you know I I know
[36:07] who I am and everybody got to come to
[36:09] recognize who they are
[36:10] yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm
[36:13] saying let's move on by the grace of God
[36:17] exceedingly riches but I I wonder
[36:19] sometimes I don't even know I think to
[36:22] myself
[36:23] with all the mistakes I've made
[36:27] how in the world could I be
[36:31] and I'm so glad it wasn't my choosing
[36:35] he chose me
[36:38] I made understand once I get there
[36:45] you know why I love God because he's so
[36:47] patient
[36:48] he's been very patient with me
[36:51] he's been so long suffering
[36:54] I cannot tell
[37:00] by grace are you saved
[37:03] through faith
[37:05] did y'all know prayer don't save you
[37:10] fasting can't save you
[37:12] you are saved by faith
[37:15] by Grace amen
[37:17] through faith
[37:19] right
[37:20] and that can that not of yourself
[37:29] oh my God you didn't get this
[37:33] if nobody in school gave it to you
[37:36] and that not of yourself
[37:39] Hallelujah
[37:42] it is the gift of God
[37:45] not a Works lest any man should boast
[37:49] Amen brother you can shout a little bit
[37:52] if you want to
[37:56] Hallelujah
[37:58] for we are his workmanship
[38:01] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[38:04] which God have before
[38:07] ordained oh this is what I love that we
[38:10] should walk in them that's why we walk
[38:14] in them it was ordained by God
[38:18] Hallelujah
[38:22] excuse me
[38:27] but we find out
[38:30] this is a quote
[38:32] God
[38:35] gave the word for his defense our
[38:39] defense
[38:40] God gave his children his word for their
[38:43] defense
[38:46] we have no other defense
[38:49] than the word of God
[38:52] that is our defense
[38:54] there's no bombs no shelters no hiding
[38:58] place no arizonas or California or
[39:01] wherever it is
[39:03] only one defense we have and that is the
[39:07] word
[39:09] you think about Daniel
[39:12] had one thing that he was charged
[39:16] he worship His God he served as God too
[39:19] much he paid prayed three times a day
[39:23] Hallelujah Daniel didn't give his chance
[39:25] to himself a chance to make a mistake
[39:29] you understand me amen he constantly
[39:32] stayed in connection with God and listen
[39:35] we always see those stories and we hear
[39:38] him and we think that uh somehow God
[39:41] takes away the man element
[39:45] at some point he does
[39:49] but before Jesus went to Calvary
[39:52] the main element was still there
[39:56] and he says Lord I wouldn't this cup
[39:58] passed from me but nevertheless not my
[40:00] will but die and be done y'all hear what
[40:03] I'm saying and you can't tell me that
[40:05] the man element wasn't there with Daniel
[40:07] at the first
[40:09] but Daniel knew how to pray
[40:14] he knew how to keep the connection
[40:17] and God so loved the way Daniel
[40:19] conduction himself that he stood in the
[40:22] fire with in the in the Lion's Den with
[40:24] him
[40:25] y'all hear what I'm saying now let me
[40:27] say it like this the pillar of Fire
[40:31] stood within the fire
[40:33] and what is our inheritance today the
[40:37] pillar of Fire
[40:39] y'all hear what I'm saying he's here
[40:45] what was brother branham's defense
[40:47] he was preaching the word
[40:50] but when that pill of Fire
[40:53] Hallelujah when that angel came
[40:56] nobody no demon in the place
[41:00] would dare challenge him y'all hear what
[41:03] I'm saying that's all I'm saying that's
[41:06] our inheritance
[41:09] but not the pillar fire here peel a fire
[41:12] that's here
[41:18] Hallelujah and when you come into the
[41:20] presence of the pillar fire it will
[41:24] change you
[41:28] oh and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[41:31] Among Us which is Christ Jesus he is our
[41:34] only defense being in him we are safe
[41:39] let me tell y'all something I'm gonna
[41:41] say it again Christianity is the
[41:43] greatest deception to most Christians
[41:50] not even sin is imputed
[41:53] to the genuine believer
[41:56] I'ma read that again
[41:58] these are not the words of brother
[41:59] Bradham even those he's preaching it it
[42:02] was already written
[42:05] not even sin
[42:07] is imputed to a genuine believer
[42:12] did you know that
[42:15] he that is born of God does not commit
[42:18] sin he cannot sin sin is unbelief amen
[42:24] amen it is not even imputed why David
[42:27] said blessed is the man who God will not
[42:30] impute sin when you're in Christ you
[42:34] have no desire to sin
[42:36] let me you know what I'm saying so you
[42:39] can better understand me in your heart
[42:42] you have no desire to sin
[42:45] but you can't stop this thing that comes
[42:49] through your your head
[42:51] that's why the Bible said put on the
[42:53] helmet of faith
[42:55] the heaven of Salvation the breath y'all
[42:58] know what I'm saying and you see by the
[43:00] grace of God you understand amen that
[43:03] you it goes it's going to come as long
[43:05] as you in this monster
[43:09] it's going to come
[43:11] but it's your duty to fight it it's your
[43:14] duty to reject it Hallelujah and what I
[43:18] what I do know one good way to get rid
[43:20] of the the devil not only just to rebuke
[43:23] him but but sing a song or two
[43:26] amen
[43:28] worship God because when you start
[43:31] worshiping God the Bible say he inherits
[43:34] the praise of his people
[43:38] will change you
[43:41] did you know that
[43:43] he that is born of God does not commit
[43:45] sin can not sin see it's not even
[43:47] imputed
[43:49] it ain't even written down
[43:51] it's not even put on the books
[43:55] or David said blessed is the man who God
[43:57] will not impute sin when you're in
[43:59] Christ
[44:01] you have no desire to sin
[44:03] the worshiper once heard has no more
[44:06] conscience of sin you don't desire it
[44:08] that's why we keep crying out that's why
[44:11] we keep praying that's why we keep
[44:13] asking for deliverance because within
[44:15] our souls there is no desire to do the
[44:17] wrong things we want to do right because
[44:20] our father does right he is righteous he
[44:22] is Holy and this is why we constantly
[44:25] empty ourselves out confess our sins and
[44:28] and God sees those things
[44:34] now to the world you might be a sinner
[44:37] but to God you're not
[44:39] because you're in Christ
[44:41] how can you be a sinner when you're in
[44:44] the sinless one
[44:46] and God only see him who you are in
[44:53] did I just cut the head of the devil off
[44:57] right
[44:58] excuse me
[45:00] do you love the Lord
[45:02] give me a few more minutes
[45:04] this Amazing Grace
[45:05] it will always be amazing
[45:11] praise the Lord Hebrews 6 17-20 says
[45:15] wherein God willingly willing more
[45:18] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of
[45:22] Promise the immutability of his counsel
[45:26] and confirm it by an oath
[45:29] that
[45:31] by two immutable things in which it was
[45:34] impossible for God to lie
[45:37] we might have a strong consolation
[45:40] Hallelujah who have fled for Refuge to
[45:44] lay hold upon the Hope set before us
[45:47] amen like those Hebrew boys says even if
[45:50] he don't deliver us
[45:52] we're not going to Bow see they had a
[45:55] strong consolation they understood
[46:00] what God meant to them and God could not
[46:04] lie and they were more interested in
[46:07] God's will than their own
[46:13] Hallelujah who have fled for rescues to
[46:16] lay hold upon the Hope set before us
[46:18] which hope we have an anchor of the Soul
[46:21] both sure and steadfast which entereth
[46:25] into the within that Veil I was greed a
[46:29] moment or two today only because I
[46:31] thought about all of the souls
[46:35] that falls under Christianity
[46:38] every denomination
[46:41] and I know if they're going to be saved
[46:43] they got to be pulled away from the
[46:45] system
[46:46] it doesn't matter what system they're in
[46:48] they can't remain in the system and be
[46:52] saved because that system will is the
[46:55] mark of the beast
[46:57] and if you allow yourself to be
[46:59] entrapped oh I'm a Baptist or a
[47:01] Methodist Presbyterian whatever you call
[47:03] yourself if that's what you think saves
[47:06] you you're a law still yet
[47:09] we're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:12] the grace of God is that right and you
[47:16] can obtain that no matter where you are
[47:18] you understand what I'm saying but you
[47:20] don't stop there God has a word for this
[47:24] hour that you must come into you can't
[47:27] listen in a man woman Boy Child whoever
[47:31] you are if you'll not take all of the
[47:34] word
[47:35] you're guilty of the same
[47:39] if God said you must be repent and be
[47:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:43] Christ and your tradition says no
[47:47] oh I was baptized Father Son and Holy
[47:49] Ghost I was this way listen
[47:52] that ain't gonna work
[47:54] I don't know how you'll come up at the
[47:56] day but Rapture material will be
[47:59] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:01] Christ that's Rapture material because
[48:04] they see it in the word and they obey it
[48:07] and that's what I try to tell people you
[48:10] want the real Holy Ghost use the real
[48:12] formula
[48:16] Hallelujah
[48:20] is it different
[48:22] people look at uh let's say like Betty
[48:25] Crocker cake mix and then you can get a
[48:27] generic
[48:28] it ain't the same
[48:33] then you might mix it the same way but
[48:35] it's not the same ingredients
[48:37] it will not come out the same
[48:41] and and and then you know what I'm
[48:43] saying it's the truth
[48:45] so is the word of God
[48:49] do I look down on somebody no
[48:52] that that's not what I'm doing
[48:55] I used to be myself
[48:58] but what I'm gonna tell you something
[48:59] God brought me through
[49:02] from a Baptist from the Baptist to a
[49:04] Catholic from the Catholic to a
[49:06] Methodist from the Methodist to an
[49:08] Apostolic from the apostolic to the word
[49:12] I went through all of that
[49:15] all of that
[49:17] but I always could see something was
[49:21] wrong
[49:22] and don't you think if I could see that
[49:24] something was wrong then I could see
[49:26] that something is wrong now
[49:29] systematic worship God hated it even
[49:33] when Israel got to a place where they
[49:36] did all the rituals right but their
[49:38] heart was far from it
[49:40] he said it becomes a stench in my
[49:42] nostrils
[49:43] and it's the truth we don't have to
[49:46] stand up and say everybody stand up
[49:48] everybody clap your hands everybody do
[49:49] this that should never be
[49:53] when the Holy Spirit is moving God wants
[49:56] spontaneous worship
[50:00] like our brother say he like popcorn
[50:02] worship
[50:06] I loved it I loved it
[50:08] amen good it's nothing but the truth
[50:13] see he's interested in anything we do
[50:16] for his glory
[50:19] right and I don't think people are going
[50:21] to lose their rewards because they don't
[50:24] see everything that we see we got Penny
[50:26] nickels dimes quarters 50 cents and a
[50:29] dollar
[50:30] and God uses all
[50:35] he's God I don't know how he's going to
[50:38] do it I just know my position
[50:41] that's all I know but there's nobody
[50:44] that I know I will receive lost or
[50:46] unsaved
[50:50] but it's these preachers
[50:53] they're the ones that are going to have
[50:55] a foot race in hell
[51:00] he loves us
[51:02] His Amazing Grace his sweet he's sweet
[51:05] oh how sweet the sound
[51:08] that saved a poor Rich like me
[51:11] huh you love the Lord
[51:14] listen when a man stands and say he's a
[51:18] gospel preacher and said that the days
[51:20] of Miracles has passed that's the seed
[51:23] of discrepancy when a man stands and say
[51:26] that he's a minister a pastor of a
[51:28] church of somewhere and he does not
[51:31] believe that Jesus is the same in every
[51:34] detail except the physical body
[51:37] same yesterday today and forever that
[51:41] seed that's a seed of discrepancy when
[51:43] he say that Miracles and the apostolic
[51:46] age are passed that's the seed of
[51:50] discrepancy when they say there's no
[51:53] such a thing as Divine Healing that
[51:55] that's a seed of discrepancy
[51:57] and the world is full of it
[52:00] is crowds out and chokes out the wheat
[52:07] you understand me that's still that
[52:10] white horse rider
[52:14] and you say well Brothers what are you
[52:16] trying to say what I'm trying to say
[52:18] we're not trying to Major on a minor
[52:21] the most important thing is that God
[52:24] will form us here in His image and his
[52:26] likeness that's where we are right now
[52:28] coming into the statue of a perfect man
[52:32] all of these other things would follow
[52:34] it
[52:35] right these signs shall follow them that
[52:38] believe
[52:39] almost done second Peter 10 1 10-11
[52:44] second Peter 1 10-11 wherefore rather
[52:47] Brethren give Dylan to make your calling
[52:50] an election sure
[52:53] for if you do these things he shall
[52:56] never fall
[52:59] for such an entrance shall be ministered
[53:02] unto you what abundantly
[53:05] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[53:07] and Savior Jesus Christ
[53:11] nothing but the grace of God
[53:14] huh is nothing but the grace of God
[53:18] in Saint John 15 5 says I am the thine
[53:21] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[53:25] me and I in them
[53:27] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[53:30] for without me ye can do nothing
[53:36] and I'm just going to stop there
[53:43] people say well I was so inspired
[53:45] inspiration is good but inspiration is
[53:48] not always right
[53:52] David was inspired
[53:54] to bring the locker the Covenant back to
[53:56] Jerusalem and he knew that's where it's
[53:58] supposed to be
[54:00] but his inspiration gave him a
[54:02] revelation that was not according to the
[54:05] word
[54:06] and he calls a man to die
[54:09] had all of the preaching Hall you know
[54:11] went to the high class all of the big
[54:13] guys of the message you know is this
[54:15] right this right this right
[54:17] but you got to understand we have a
[54:19] message
[54:20] we have a word that we can go to if we
[54:22] have questions we can go through this
[54:24] message and find out the true answer we
[54:27] don't need a bishop to tell us who it is
[54:29] or what it is
[54:30] we've had a prophet for this day he left
[54:33] a message
[54:35] and so when we need to find out what's
[54:37] right and what's wrong we have a message
[54:38] laid out before us with the word of God
[54:41] you understand me
[54:43] but there's so many people that are
[54:46] being inspired and they think because
[54:47] they're inspired let me tell you
[54:49] something
[54:50] inspiration will lead you oh certain
[54:52] Inspirations can be so powerful it will
[54:56] lead you away from the truth
[54:59] those people that would Inspire to leave
[55:04] right it was an inspiration
[55:06] and they didn't even understand that
[55:08] they were fulfilling the word of God
[55:10] the seed that was in them was made
[55:12] manifest by their inspiration
[55:17] and you and I must understand that the
[55:20] inspiration is true it's always true in
[55:22] that sense but watch the word watch what
[55:25] is it what is what you're being inspired
[55:28] to do
[55:29] it has to line up with the word of God
[55:32] you love the Lord let's stand
