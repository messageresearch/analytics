breath my glasses are down on the floor but I've got joy like a river Hallelujah well you may be seated for just a moment we're so glad to have everyone here tonight you know I used to feel sorry basically for myself when people wouldn't show up for service but I reversed that I feel sorry for them uh what a beautiful day we appreciate our brothers from Norfolk Nebraska amen brother Michael for the John and brother Evan y'all can stand up I mean everybody can just see our brethren and travel amen you may be seated amen our brother one about brothers is uh from the Congo guess who amen but you're happy we're happy to have you here by the grace of God amen you know one thing I love about this message it's the only thing that can bring every nationality together as brothers and sisters and I just love that you you meet a Christian and you just welcome and welcome them into your family uh like I told our brother uh Mike you know feel free you know sometimes I'm I'm I may seem like I'm putting on a show but I I know one thing I come to entertain him and you know it's not to entertain no one else you know so I can act the way I want to and I can worship him the way I want to because I'm pleasing him amen you love the Lord I'm not going to take long but uh you know I think I'll thank God for our brother Gabriel to worry I'm I'm on my tongue is you know I mean it's anointed right now so I got to keep it from speaking uh but we we we're going to have our brother introduce his family but Gabe and I and his wife uh we go back for many years even when I was in Lima Ohio and you know we did a recording together and uh I still have some of those CDs I didn't bring them with me today but I'll bring some tomorrow uh if you will they're free for you if you want them you'll be blessed and uh we just thank God for all that God has done for us and I'm he's a he's a and I don't want to praise him uh because I realize it's the god that's in him uh but since he's been here I have been truly uplifted in my spirit just because of the words of wisdom that God speaks through him and uh I just know that he's a man that lives it and I appreciate him by the grace of God and we appreciate every one of you who have come out tonight I was expecting a bigger crowd but I figured because of the rain you know and I don't know where ever you know somebody will have an excuse me nevertheless I appreciate it we we come for the blessing you know I don't know about y'all but when I was a boy you know we I love to eat then so around dinner time I made sure I was at home right because I wanted my portion now I understand you my mama had a lot of children you know I got a lot too I got eight of them but nevertheless they didn't have to wait in line like I did and so I knew that if I didn't get there early and early enough that my food was going to be eaten it was going to disappear and nobody would know who ate it and so I knew that if I didn't get there so I didn't want the the ghost or whatever to eat my food I wanted to eat my own food so I would be there on time and that's the thing that's what people don't understand the ones that come early you get the bigger right so I appreciate our brother I can go on because I'm feeling pretty good right now they call that stimulation but uh we're gonna let our brother come if he would hi brother Gabriel and uh when we uh he has some singing and he's a great musician a great brother and we're going to have him come and uh his family I guess he introduced them uh don't mean to take up so much time I I always say I'm not going to do that I don't mind I was enjoying the spirit I could have just sat back there and enjoyed the the service um we got some people from the congoose my French is no longer any good but but I remember that praise God um I'm gonna have my family come on I'll just introduce him as he would come yeah that's my oldest son leading the charge you might not be able to tell but he is a one-quarter Indian so my father is from from India I'm half Indian and he's he's quarter Indian and so when he was born we wanted to give him an Indian name so we named him amen which means divine grace Sundar which means beautiful so his name is beautiful divine grace but when people from India see his name and then they see his face they don't think that's the right the right uh the right person he he was the whitest one of us all but this this is um and he's the oldest he's 12. there we go um yeah so he he's he's the oldest one he's 12. and then Isaiah's the next one Isaiah Gabriel

with those of like Precious faith and it is such uh honor to be here and they've been working on a song so um you all can go ahead and do your do the the song This is a song I wrote from the book of Hebrews um yes if you know the scriptures Hebrews 7 19 and I don't know were you going to introduce the song common I'll I'll let you go ahead and and do that and then I'll stop talking and let you guys go the song we're going to be singing is called better hope and my father actually wrote it but we're gonna be singing it now [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I thought I'd better hope we die [Music] today [Music] I answered living clothes [Music] [Music] [Music] enemies [Music] [Music] I'm better [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen amen we we might um come back to that song I'm not sure what

that in a bit later but the law made nothing nothing but the bringing in of a better hope did this next song's called a Grace it's called powerful Grace and the lord gave me this song laughs and sometimes we think about Grace as something to walk over something that's weak but the Lord was just putting this message on my heart that Grace is powerful the grace of God is powerful and this this was just a message that he put on this song and so I'm gonna sing it but we're not singing to entertain you like brother Brooks said we're singing unto the Lord and so if you get the tune of this song that's why we got the words up that you can just worship right along with us starts in the kidney it's just going to walk up the scale Grace how we're full marvelous [Applause] [Music] through his

amen amen amen thank you family thank you thank you praise God um amen if you wouldn't mind standing with me for the word would turn to Romans chapter 5 send greetings from the flock in Ann Arbor Michigan Little Flock assembly assembly and we greet you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we wish we could worship together um but they are praying for the meetings maybe they'll even be streaming it it's one Lord One Faith one baptism also about them and one Spirit you know one Spirit on his feet praise God Romans 5. therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God amen let's pray amen I'm a father about Lord we thank you that you are high and lifted up thank you that you are in us and we are in you and thank you merci then all your enemies are under your feet and thank you that we are your body and we are your feet and in the name of Jesus I take authority over every hindering Spirit every discouraging Spirit every Spirit of Darkness anything to chosen they would lift up itself against the name of you Jesus and I cast you down and I cast you out in the name of Jesus Lord we bless your name we lift up your name be glorified in the destroying of the devil tonight and getting glory in your church and the precious name of Jesus we pray amen amen amen amen amen amen so be it you say that's fine see you can be seated amen Amen brother Brooks and I are like uh family you know tell you a funny story and it's not to make you um laugh but sometimes we we hear things and it makes us um just feel more comfortable with one another result but he was pastoring in Lima years ago and I was visiting him and he told me a sister in his church was complaining to him and her complaint was that she brings in I'm sorry that he brings in all these no-name preachers she wanted some big name preachers and he brought in no name preachers no but what Jesus said when he came he said I come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name I'm reading from John 5 43. he said him or you received and then he asked a question how can you believe which receive honor one of another [Music] and sickness the honor that Cometh From God only in Psalm 20 I'm sorry in Psalm 34. David says I will bless the Lord at all times and his praise shall continually be in my mouth is my soul munam shall make her boast Suga the humble lumbler shall hear thereof he is and be glad o magnify the Lord with me so tonight meant to know I don't come in mind no name but I come in Jesus name the name above all names they rejoice and they are glad because my God it's high and lifted up in his name is and you should be glad tonight that my name doesn't matter but his name does his name matters his name matters because at the name of Jesus as it says community and Philippians 2 Don Philippines and verse 9 and 10. that God has highly exalted him and giving him a name that is above every name then at the knee at the name of Jesus of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and it says also USI and I believe it's uh uh Colossians that they will never be any name higher than the name of Jesus in this world is so in the name of Jesus there's Authority tonight yeah there's Authority tonight there's Authority tonight there's power amen amen amen so we started with this verse in Romans chapter 5. and when you read the Bible we recognize that what it says is exactly what it means exactly what it means and sometimes we don't read the Bible carefully so we read the Bible and we're feeling one way yeah and so we think the word of God says something different because we're feeling a certain way for instance being Ito can anybody tell me what tense that is anybody went to grammar school here what tense is this is present tense continuous it's not something for the future do you know what Justified means it means righteous how many feels righteous don't answer Justice how many feels righteous don't answer but answer it in your heart but this is talking about a present tense righteousness regardless of what we feel like it says we have no we will have but we have amen we have peace with God anybody ever felt it's like like God was angry with them there's an old song we used to sing yeah it's called he brought me out the masoti and it starts out is and remember this first verse is talking about somebody who's now born again and it says my heart was distressed Jehovah's Jehovah dread frown Calera is rap and low in the pit where my Sensei dragged me down fancy but then it says I cried to the Lord I cried to the Lord from the deep Mary clay who tenderly brought me out to Golden day there was a time yeah and I know I'm talking to everybody tonight so I'm talking to Believers and maybe some unbelievers I'm born again so maybe not born again and I don't know but I'll tell you this is it's the same word if you're born again and if you're not born again and it doesn't matter how long you've known about God he wants you to know him he wants you to know him and this verse in chapter five is talking about Fowler people Dijon who have been born again so if you haven't been born again it doesn't apply to you but I've got good news okay so what I said it first that's the bad news if you haven't been born again how many knows Romans 6 23. wages of what you earned some of us I heard Billy Graham say it this way one time he says people sow their Wild Oats all week that means not good to see and they come to church on Sunday and they pray for crap failure but that's not how it works whether you're dead in your sins or you're born again [Applause] foreign amen amen so we want to sow good seats and you know what the best seat is the word of God the word of God said apology so by the grace of God as a servant of God so in the feet of the word not in me I have the Holy Spirit but the life is in God and the life is in his word so if we just speak the word of God brings forth life that's what we're going to talk about amen so talking about faith a little bit and we're going to go back to that verse and look at the tenses Lord willing it might have been brotherless somebody asked me the title of the sermon and I found my experience I have a bad track record of titling the service because I write down my notes and what I think God wants to say is sometimes he flips not a different gospel but it's a little bit different so we're just going to let God say what he wants to say we're expecting from him amen God wants to show up and he's here he's here so in Ephesians 6 and 16. above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to clench all the fiery darts of the wicked is okay so let's go back in our um our story here when we read the word of God let's read what it says and examine that with our experience okay ready a quiz you know interrogation we all read the verse how many fiery darts on get through the shield of Faith um okay don't answer all at once but you could answer this in a few different ways you can answer it by what you've experienced experience you could answer it by how you feel um the things but the things that are not saying so if we want to know how many fiery darts get through the shield of faith we gotta look at what the word of God says about it and you know how many get through the shield of Faith somebody say it with me how many darts get through the shield of Faith sometimes we go through our week and we feel like oh the devil hit with me at the dark oh you know flesh that's how we feel and it could be what's happening because I don't know your life but I know what the word of God says and the truth is in the word of God it was available foreign in first John 5 and 4. for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world first John 5 and 4. for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith I don't care how you feel tonight not that I don't care about you but God wants our feelings to be directed by his word by the Holy Ghost that's what he that's her he wants for us tonight it doesn't matter if we feel like an overcomer can hurt us tonight there's protection available to us Victory available for us tonight now in Luke chapter 6 and 46. Jesus says and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say um in the Hebrew culture um they had a way of emphasize the the issue in the American culture I don't like to chew American when we want to emphasize oh we pound our fists oh we wave our arms that's how we emphasize in the Hebrew culture when they wanted to emphasize they wouldn't do it that same way they would repeat so when Jesus would say verily verily that was the strongest way he could say a point to you he says verily verily Jesus that's how they did it he's talking about people that are emphasizing G and sister that Jesus is Lord but they're doing something different so let's read on I don't even live whosoever cometh to me um and here with my Saints and do with them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built in house and digged deep it's wrong and laid the foundation on a rock yeah and when the flutter Rose Avenue the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not shake it before it was founded somebody say it was founded it was building this Foundation is a foundation was on the rock it is but he that heareth and there was like a man is that without a foundation built in the house upon the Earth means on the dirt in the Book of Matthew he uses the word bad foundations against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately and the ruin of that house was great now let's look at this portion of scripture on the outside um exterior you couldn't tell the difference they both built houses they both said Lord Lord when was the time of the difference known for the trials when the trials came when the trials came and some of us we walk in our life from one failure to the next uh are you not but the Bible says were to go from strength the only to force the strength on false from glory to God to Glory from Faith before to Faith that's what the word of God says amen amen so that's what we want this is so I don't judge anybody here tonight but as we're reading this is foreign tells us how to live in Victory and even if you've been born again that same old devil serves you they'll try to get you you continue to live as a slave even after you've been set free and God wants you to walk in the freedom of his word where the fiery darts everyone somebody say everyone stop by the shield of Faith Hallelujah yes yes and if you're not yet born again you can be born again today amen amen amen but what is the difference the difference is the foundation the difference in Matthew 16 and 17 you don't know Jesus was talking to the disciples firstly asked them who do people say that I am um they say some say this some say this something you know John the Baptists then he said who do you say that I am and Peter says you are the Christ son of the Living God and Jesus answers in verse 17 blessed art thou Simon barjona is for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee is but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock it is shall not Prevail against it we're in we're not in Ankeny anymore right what city is this uh what's that Windsor Heights Windsor Heights Windsor Heights when I came into winter Heights there was no gate of the city but in all days there were Gates and you may have been to a city where there's a gate in different countries there's borders has anybody ever crossed the border of a country has any has anyone here ever been to war yeah but you know if you know of wars did you ever hear of any War that's because where somebody picks up Hamas they're border gay and carries out to war and says this would be a good weapon it is to beat the enemy over the headwind so we have to understand the picture that Jesus is talking about because some people read this and this is what they think Jesus is saying he's building his church and the Gates of Hell won't beat it to death that's not what he said do you know when the gates of the city come into play videos are going to destroy that City that's when the gates of hell yeah so he's talking about a church not a surviving church but a Victorious church because when Jesus died and he rose is that all power in Heaven and Earth is and he poured that power into the church and it says that he's waiting at the right hand of God is enemies he made his footstool yes does anybody know who the Last Enemy is in First Corinthians 15. The Last Enemy to be destroyed it's this so this is talking about a Victorious Church the same life that was in Jesus he walked out into the church until the church takes away those Gates the Church of the Living God that's the church that doesn't understand the Mandate or the gospel evangelo and so Jesus said who's going to build the church and the Gates of Hell won't stop it will not Prevail against it so now we begin to understand why the thing the Devil Comes against most is the foundation is the foundation it says if the foundation be destroyed foreign be destroyed the devil will try to destroy the foundation he'll try to destroy your foundation and if you don't have a solid foundation in the old days maybe uh some of you have heard it it was an awesome time and it went like like this I'll just sing it hold the fort for I am coming Jesus answer still anybody ever heard that wave the answer back to Heaven by thy Grace we will I used to sing that song I used to like that song I hate that song I am not holding any farts the devil's trying to hold the gate say hell the job is he say he said do you know what holding a fort is about something about you camping out waiting for the rescue but Jesus already won the victory and he said he's the one and that Victory comes from the foundation so God doesn't care how your house looks like tonight and don't misunderstand me um it is important how we build simple important than how we build is what we have built upon the day will try every work the Apostle Paul said that the day will try it 'll be Tried by fire but the church WIll exist God has equipped to walk victorious in First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 12 you know it says this this you see now we have received not the spirit which is of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely the shoes given to us of God a few verses back is the Apostle Paul quotes from the prophets of the Old Testament and he said I have not seen you have not heard either have entered in the heart of man hath prepared for them they love him but those eyes Mrs you are talking about natural eyes those ears I'm talking about natural ears and so sometimes people uh the things that God has prepared for them to love him but they didn't read the next verse half all right somebody tell me what tense hath is so God has already revealed them by his word but he said you need the Holy Spirit it freely belonged to you it freely belong to you so I have the spirit of God in Me And even if you haven't been born again the spirit of God can still speak to you but he's going to speak to you one thing one thing and if you ask God to save you he's not going to do anything to save you he's going to send you to a preacher who's going to tell you about the finished work the things that are already done things through the Holy Spirit open our hearts tonight to the things that are already done Complete because we're not running away from Gates and we got a shield that stops every fiery dark amen amen and if you don't have that yet you can have it tonight and if you do have it the devil's tricked you out of using it you can have a shield of Faith how many knows the shield doesn't work unless you lift it up [Music] to me female Ephesians taking the shield of Faith it's useless something that is already done come on come on so just like I said God won't do anything to save you tonight except from pointing to the work that's already been finished but if you have been safe he uses the same thing to give you Victory and he tells you the same way um [Applause] these are different pictures but they're telling the same story in one picture there's victory yeah there's defeat yeah defense but God's desire for the church is Victory and so the devil tonight will want to destroy your foundation in first John 4 and verse 17 it says this is hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment um how many knows what boldness is if it's okay I'd like to say a few words we have some of you who are married here [Music] and he to get married you have to do something called a proposal and it works different ways in different cultures and some you might go to the father first is come in sir [Music] and you may sir I really admire you know Mr your family and your daughter and anyway but you're now bold sir I'm gonna marry your daughter nothing you do that's not how you go all right but this is boldness the day of judgment now answer this question in your heart when you go stand before the Lord will he say to you yes guilty or righteous foreign now there's some people yeah digital that have been in church a long time and they don't know the answer to that question is they're trying to pray you should say that they're trying to do everything that they can you just said to make up for what they did [Music] um when they get up there by some Miracles now I didn't write first John 4 17. Jesus he wrote it through John but that was the spirit of Christ in him from this place is our love made perfect now notice he's talking about a process but it's talking also from a starting point and he says from this starting place on oh the love is made perfect we'll read some more of that verse but I'm just going to break it down by the grace of God once again the word of God means exactly what it says so if he says from here means from right where he's saying right there I don't know how this will translate to French there's a word context the context if you take the text out of context the old context what do you have left and there's people that take the word of God yeah and they take it out of context and they don't read the whole thing and they twist it all around and make them say things that the word of God doesn't say what it says right here he's talking about a place by which we grow to Perfection but it's not the place that you start from not the place that you end from the place that you start from there's a place of baldness he found the place that you started you start knowing already the answer is when you stand Before the Throne of God if you don't know the answer to that God wants your foundation to be sure and that doesn't mean you're not born again when I was in my early twenties he's preaching on Grace and he was just sharing the simple gospel of grace and how did it works and how it takes the work off of you and I was hearing him preach and I've been a Christian a long time I have been born again filled with the Holy Spirit leading Bible studies with the young people on the campus of the University of Michigan Michigan but when he was preaching yeah and I was saying Amen to the word because he was just reading the word but after the service was over my feelings said this yeah I know there's Grace but that's too easy there's something more religious ideas religious ideas they weigh us down you sit outside they weigh us down when God wants us to walk now don't misunderstand it Grace is powerful Grace would change your life in the book of Titus it says the grace of God has appeared oh man we should walk holy Grace will change your life in the modern world people this is what they think race is not that he could ever die but it was his body right um but they think he died so that you don't have to feel guilty and so people preach this gospel tell them you don't have to feel guilty it is but he didn't come so you didn't feel guilty but he came to give you New Life new life universe right that isn't camping out at the Fort waiting for the next attack this is whether you know it or not the church's mandate degrees and Jesus the church has finished that mandate [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] but he fears the church because God is in his church it says these staggering words do you see astounding words I'm all off the notes now I said that could happen but God says what he wants to say it says only under who Jesus be glory is in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen amen amen do you notice when Jesus was introducing himself reintroducing himself to John in Revelation some of his Divine attributes and he said I am the amen amen in other words when I say it'll be done just as I said amen it'll be done just I said amen think about it in Ephesians 3 and 21. it talks about God getting Glory he boundaries but how does it say he would get glory in his church do you know what glory is something you behold this water bottle not that glorious a certain type of Glory as far as water bottles are concerned it doesn't leak right it's got a straw yeah when I put it behind here you don't know anything about the glory of the water bottle because it's not revealed in Romans chapter 8 it says that the sufferings of this present time how many are in this present time all of us are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US but what's the glory that shall be revealed in us that means God's Own Divine lives so that people know foreign [Applause] amen amen so when we think about Glory we got to think about how God wants to get Glory come on we can read all through the Bible people who wanted to give God glory but God wants to be glorified according to his Holiness his attributes to who he is right it's not just his power so it is his power it's not just his Mercy but it is his Mercy it's not just his justice but it is his Justice you know there's people that want to walk in the power of God but they don't want to walk in the Holiness of God that's not God but when God's glorious revealed when The Last Enemy is put under the church's feet you're also going to see God's holiness you're going to see his righteousness but you know how you're going to see it see the glory of the water bottle this is the silly examples Jesus is seated in heaven at the right hand of the father these are symbols because we know God feels all spaces and have our being in him it only so he's everywhere but how did he want to be glorified in Psalm 19. you know Psalms it says the heavens declare the glory of the Lord and they do you eat the phone but when God wanted to be glorified he wanted to show off who he is before the foundation of the earth there's one thing that he did yeah and you know what he did he flew the lion he flew the lamb so that he could have his dream home so that he could have his dream home so that he could have his dream home we don't serve a week so when he starts he finishes he finishes he finishes amen amen anybody ever tried to build something let's get going you get started you do something wrong oh I gotta undo that you should do it I'm an engineer sometimes I'm working on things to these shoes and I have to rip something out and redo it it's just uh software engineer sometimes I build things on my home I get it's almost done one thing's wrong gotta rip it out in my face start over there's other things yeah the shoes try to do just say do fail you want to do it and you're just not able to do it the way you want to do it I'm a musician musician and there's certain things that I can play yeah and there's certain things that I cannot yeah yeah but I can hear the music in my mind and I move towards it is but I can't play it yeah but God doesn't have any of these problems he's not confused he's not weak and he knows how to get the job done so he doesn't have to go backtrack the way that he designed so we can be assured that the Mandate that he has given us we are fully equipped equipped to carry it out amen you know I was thinking one time I was sitting at a youth camp a man was preaching yeah and how many knows the name of Williams how many knows he was a prophet the prophet in the gifts of discernment and healing that at least we haven't heard about you um since the book of Acts and anytime we see a man gifted like this [Music] um and he would pray for people and they would get healed and he could look into their life somebody would come as for prayer and if they had a secret sin is God would show him what it was and he would tell what it was away from the microphone so that they would know when you say if you deal with this is you'll um you'll get healed and it was God working through him William Branham didn't heal a single man brother did not heal a single man every man that has been healed from beginning but sometimes we did we get in these uh you know we were talking about boldness and sometimes we get to wondering we get to wonder am I okay am I okay and this this brother said yeah many of us if brother Branham was here right now he looked in your life that you were okay is it okay and if he walked in right now we'd all probably be pretty excited by the resurrection and if he looked at you and told you you were okay was it okay you'd be feeling pretty good but let's take it another level what if Jesus walked in the door now we're getting excited what if Jesus walked in the door burdens yeah acting out a little bit all right just one second we're gonna do a little drama it's impromptu all right we'll we'll go right out here okay so brother John and this drama he's gonna um be Jesus now come with me in your imagination right now and he's gonna walk in evandre and let's just do a drama together when Jesus appeared to the disciples on the road to Emmaus in The Book of Mark don't leave the mark it says they didn't recognize him because he appeared to them in another form in other words he didn't look like he looked spending time with them and I don't know why he did this but he did it so it wasn't like they're just looking at him and couldn't recognize him it says I believe it says their eyes were holding but in mark it tells us why they didn't see him because he was in another form so Jesus could walk in here tonight looking just like Brother John but I'll tell you this if you know Jesus when he comes in the room I don't know it's him and so I'm just asking you to come with me he's coming in another foreign okay thank you Glory Hallelujah Praise Your Name Lord blessed be your name Jesus we worship you now don't bow to him but [Music] all right go ahead and actually carry on for a little bit what you would do somebody would do this I guarantee you hmm [Music] we'd be hugging his neck we would be lined up okay thank you brother brother Brooks had more Liberty to help help with the drama here we might be dancing but we would be we would probably just be all just hanging on to him weeping and some of us been carrying burdens oh yeah there's something stacked up against us we thought about oh if I see you know if a mighty Prophet was here I would feel good but then if Jesus walked in I was just you owned them suddenly all those things you were you would just know you just know that it's okay okay and everybody would just I'm safe it's okay it's okay it's okay okay and I want to read something from John chapter 16. in this portion of scripture John 14 through 17. it's the it's the last sermon that Jesus gives to his disciples before he um is offered up for them it's before Gethsemane it's um after the what they call the Last Supper Judas is gone it's just him and his closest disciples and he begins to unfold what he's doing and he tells them he's leaving now you can imagine or if Jesus walked in the room and we just spent the disciples had spent three and a half years with him [Music] they had performed Miracles with him he took two fishes and Five Loaves and he didn't feed the people he gave it to them he gave it to them he gave it to them and he said if you feed the people and they went out and they fed the people they did that and and you know you can see how the the crowds responded when he did that they said this is the king they were going to make him a king he started preaching the truth to them but now it's just his disciples the plan to them and he's telling them I'm going away and you can imagine how they felt sorrow have filled your heart now remember what they had with him I agree all the time for three and a half years and he said because I said these things unto you yeah sorrow have filled your heart nevertheless nevertheless you know more I tell you the truth do you believe it it is expedient Expedia means better advantageous so there's what we think will be better and there's What God Says is better how many knows what God says is better it's better than what you think will be better and he said it's better that I go away it's better that I go away or even if Jesus would come here physically because he said himself it's better that I go away because if I go not away I will not leave you orphans he was talking about putting power in the church that could Advance towards the gates of hell thank you so we don't sing songs anymore oh the fort for I am coming a lot of people saying oh I can't wait till Jesus comes back and Rescues Me from this evil age but what he said is the life that I'm putting in my church will shine forth in this evil age to the point that all of the enemy's weapons there was crushed to Calvary we'll finally be put under the feet of the church of the church so we're talking about Victory we're talking about victory you know it doesn't matter how long we've been to church it doesn't matter how sincere we are and so the message of the Gospel tonight it's the same message that it's always been through all of the ages but there's something that happens at the last stage when we get in the time we're close to taking the last enemies and that's when the power is to Manifesto and you can know about it you can talk about it but talking about it and knowing about it it's not the same as having it and God wants you he sent me tonight to tell you that he wants every one of you to have boldness in the day of judgment where you can know from starting right now [Music] here it is our love made perfect [Music] chapter four we'll we'll read that that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world once again what tenses is the one that was that is and that is to come when he's talking about you here he says as he is right so are a lot of people read this verse but they haven't read the whole text but read the whole text he's talking about going to Perfection from a place of security he doesn't say as he is so will we be in this world but he says as he is so are we in this world and you may be listening to this right now amen but God doesn't lie so it doesn't matter what we feel the angel came to Mary and he told her something to sounded ridiculous and she said how can this be how do you mean he said the Holy Ghost will under overshadows is it is Amen to the word of God Amen and so whether we understand it in our flesh it doesn't matter but there's something in our spirit when it says as he is so are we in my experiences yes yes yes so are we so I can be bold so I don't have to wait to get to the gate and wonder they all what's he going to say but I can be both I can be bold the boldness it's the starting point the foundation from he tells you from the day you were born again best [Music] [Music] same hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest and when in scenes of Glory I sing the new new song it will be stand before the Thrones but it's a place of boldness it's a place of security security and when it says perfect love casts out all fears do you know what the fear is that God's Gonna damn you to hell in Romans 8 and 1. it says this is there is therefore now no no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus I don't know what it's like in French but in English when we hear the word condemnation we think it means feeling guilty but this word condemnation here comes from the Greek word katakrima and it means that the judgment is passed and the sentence is rendered and it literally means there is no damnation to hell if you're in Christ Jesus so you can see how you can grow from maturity because family he's put his life in you and that's the same life it brought him up from the grave and if you don't have it he wants you to have it today and he wants you to have it so bad amen that he despise the shame and for the joy as it says in Hebrews 12. that was set before him he endured the cross so that he could see his own life exploding explosions out of you I don't know all your names but God knows your name for you because he wants to see his life in there to take the gates of hell but he wants you to believe it that the devil can't get you out of his hands you don't have to worry that Satan's gonna pluck you out of his hands in John 14 when he said he was going to send the Holy Spirit he said I'll abide with you forever I'll never leave you nor forsake you didn't and the Epistle of Timothy is it says if we deny him when you're born again sometimes before you don't believe as you should but you never deny him you never deny him but it says if we believe not he abideth faithful how many has believed how they should neither one of us can put up our hands putting up the scripture you got it there okay if we believe not yet he abideth faithful [Applause] you can have a foundation tonight the devil's got nothing but bad news but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is nothing but good news if you're not saved the doors are open and if you are saved the holy spirit is open in our hearts right now things that belong to us and like I said about sincerity brother Branham said this absolutely like a doctor giving medicine he might give you or arsenic that's poison sincerely since salmon he might give you sulfuric acid you know and anything contrary to God's word I don't care what it is and how long it's been in existence and Peter give them an eternal prescription on the day of Pentecost he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this prescription is to you and to your children it's an eternal prescription amen like we read in the Psalms if the foundation be destroyed the tweets what shall the righteous do just the devil the Diablo first of all is trying to make sure if you say the people in the church don't have any foundations and there's lots of it going on I don't have to point it out but I guarantee if you've been in church you know about it that everybody that's sitting in the church doesn't have the life of God but it's not because there's not life and sometimes that could be us not if we've been already born again but I was raised in church and for people raised in church it's really hard on our flesh and hard on our pride to go all these years and see something in the word and admit to ourselves that we don't got it and I'm not trying to talk anybody out of their faith but God's speaking the hearts and I know what he's doing not saying I'm telling God what he's doing but the word discerns and that's why I say that I know it is and if you've been born again he's anchoring you right now it's strengthening you but if you haven't been born again he's convicting you and he's telling you [Music] you don't have to go in your house that on the outside looks like everybody else is wondering if this next storm is going to take you out of because when the foundation is there a foundation you can stand you can have boldness in the day of judgment you can know that you have it right now from that point you can walk no and even if you mess up you're in him he's not going to leave the devil can't pluck you out you've got a new heart so you don't want to leave you mess up the devil's gonna accuse you see but there's a blood me on song that speaks better things than evil when King killed Abel God came to King and he said your brothers Christ to me do you know what it was crying for who says foreign [Music] Hallelujah amen so you say brother how do I get that boldness I was telling that story brother Brooks was preaching and it was a good sermon I couldn't quote it back to you but he was preaching the gospel of grace but my flesh myself and the religious things that I had picked up I hadn't learned to walk in grace to walk in Freedom to work so every time I messed up try to make it up to God and I'd ask him did I really get your Holy Ghost and I heard the Holy Ghost is free but the devil's a full-time liar how many of those thieves don't care about laws that's why they call them the devil was a thief from the beginning a lion from the beginning [Music] so do you think if you're born again he's not going to tell you that you're not even if he's not going to tell you that you're going to hell I'll tell you that every day in your life and the devil's beating her up and she asked for prayer in my my heart she was she was struggling and she told me the devil was beating her up yeah and you know he's telling her these lies and she wanted me to pray for her that he wouldn't do that anymore and I told her privately but I said sis I can't pray that for you and that's not exactly what I said I'm paraphrasing but he's a liar and he's always going to do that I will pray for you is that God shows you the freedom that you have in him the victory that you have in him so when he's lying to you can't stop you I like to say it this way I can't stop the devil from attacking me but he can't stop me from defeating him and you might say who do you think you are it's not who I think that I am is who God said that I am not Gabriel Jesus church will not Prevail against it so I know you should say that he can't stop me from beating him because that's what Jesus said and I believe it and so going back to that that sermon I would hear those from time to time and we hear lots of preaching from well-meaning ministers but I'll tell you this is the law made nothing perfect it's Hebrews 7 19 if you're bringing it up the law made nothing perfect it was said but to bring it in of a better hope did and they want to know why the law made nothing perfect because we can't keep it it wasn't a problem with the law this is a problem with us and that's why he had to give you his own life where he wanted to be
