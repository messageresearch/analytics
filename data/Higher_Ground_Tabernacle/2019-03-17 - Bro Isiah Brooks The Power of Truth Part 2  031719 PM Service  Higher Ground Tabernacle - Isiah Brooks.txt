TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's treatment Lee look up your Redemption day the day our freedom sunnies me means heart a feeling for fear it'd be filled with the spirit with your lamps trimmed and please look uh your redemption isn't that same that's again old uh hey our redemption is near his hearts are feeling for Fears he filled with the spirit soul am trim and clear SOTA Jory damn Sony's me you love the Lord amen let us turn we're standing as we stand we'll go right on into the word praise the Lord try to finish up this evening what we started this morning by the grace of the Lord the power of truth there's only one truth and that's God's word amen you love the Lord let us turn to Psalms 33 please while we turning there I just want to say I think sometimes we we forget I forget that service starts in the morning at nine o'clock I am sometimes late so I know sometimes we will be late coming in but it's important and imperative that we try to start service at 9:00 and that means prayer prayer between 9:00 and 9:30 on Sunday mornings and of course that goes for Sunday for the evening services we I feel like we're getting slack and I won't say I am too I have myself but let's try to do what we need to be doing and if we want God to bless us and I know that's a ministry and everybody the whole church can be a part of me that hour half an hour early before service in to pray Psalms 33 and 4 for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth let us pray Lord we thank you once again for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and we pray father God that you will be merciful to us forgive us of our sins strengthen us Lord that will be what you would have us to be bless now the saints of God those who come out to the house of God tonight or just this evening we realize Lord Jesus we are a needy people and Lord we we come Lord God because we realize Lord this is the place that we should be you said Lord Jesus when we see that day approaching that we need to come together the more lord help us all that we may see the vision in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we started about the big picture I think sometimes we fail to see the big picture mainly because we were born sinners and most of us really don't think much of ourselves thank God for profit thank God for the word of the hour that God will bring us to a place that we will be able to see what this is all about when we read Genesis we would not have known we I know personally when God dealt with me when I would read Genesis without before knowing the message I just knew that God created Adam and Eve and Adam and Eve sinned and we became sinners never saw the full plan of salvation I didn't understand why it was the drama of Genesis that God when he created out of me what was that all about it took the message it took the revealed word to explain to us what that was all about and how that God in himself had the attributes of being a father and that Adam was his first son if you want to say created son and we didn't understand that Adam was the beginning of the human race and how that you know all of these things took place we didn't realize a man that we were you know I don't know about everybody else but I know even as a denomination denominational Christian I thought that salvation was something that you could really hope for it was never something that was sure you know because we made so many mistakes and people always made you feel like you almost had to work your own soul salvation out you really had to work it you know and you can't make mistakes and I remember when I was in the Apostolic Church how people one lady one girl said to me and she was weeping we had a system there was really manmade and that man-made system was that when we would fall or come short we had to go and confess to the bishop you know close to what they do in other organizations and she said but what if I sin and you know I can't reach the bishop and then I die am I lost I mean that was her mentality and it was not only hers but almost everybody there had this thought in my head I I we got a call the bishop quickly and get it right didn't that was era it was era it was erroneous amen to think like that but that's how men make you feel they take those things to control you with them you know and we find out by God's grace this message set me free it made me free to know that I have an advocate I have one that I can go to now if I sin against you then I'm supposed to make right with you but if I sin against God I'm supposed to make right with God and it was such a freedom that God had given me through this because you see that was just part of the picture when we talk about really coming to see what God did for us we didn't understand even so that we were part of him it took the reveal word it took the message of the hour to unmake us understand that the Holy Ghost and God was the same he understand me it's like you know oh I got the Holy Ghost but God was over here and I just had a hope that Holy Ghost like it was something separate from God and it took the opening of the word the revealed word amen to express to us that no there's only one Holy Spirit and when you get the Holy Spirit amen that is a Porsche a portion of God in you and that same portion of God in you has the ability to do the same thing that's what Jesus Christ says that he in Hebrews 13 and 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not hallelujah the power of truth will make you free hallelujah we did not know Amen that the Holy Ghost had three compartments or three places that he could land on we thought when you shouted you spoke in tongues and then you up and down you ow amen you had the Holy Ghost and you were saved you were sanctified and you was ready for heaven but we didn't know that man was a three Pashtu man we didn't understand that man had a how to court he had an inner court and he had a Holies of Holies and we didn't understand Amen that when the Holy Ghost would fall you wanted the Holy Ghost not to fall just on your flesh not to just fall on your spirit but you need a God in your soul it is the soul that God comes to redeem hallelujah and we didn't know that but we solve things we saw that there were people who could shout and dance and run up and down the house yet they could curse they could smoke they could drink they can run around with women and all these kind of things and you know what they still thought they were saved because they spoke in tongues because they said speaking in tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost you understand me see how the truth makes you free set you in a place of freedom because you realize that once you are sealed with the Holy Ghost you are sealed to the day of your Redemption we didn't even realize a man that sanctification was a real process we thought Amen once you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know you felt real good hallelujah clean up a little bit of your act but we didn't know it meant that it was the same Holy Ghost that justified you how many are justified it's the same Holy Ghost that gives you power to be sanctified now the saint of a guy sanctified it's not a a mental conception it is a reality that God cleanses you from the inside out and then he comes along and then what he feels you with his Holy Ghost now you and I know by God's grace we wanted to put everybody out put this way in our way of learning or teachings we thought that Romans nine ten you know if you if you confess with your mouth and 10 nine if you faites with your Mountain believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and you know it's made unto salvation that confession what we didn't believe we did not understand that that's where it began but that's really where it began and you know what it didn't matter what denomination you were in Oh Lord is that right remember the brother just preached brother Craig says did you notice he read a quote where brother Alan said when God healed people called them Christians he never asked what denomination they were in a Christian was a Christian hallelujah I mean it's just like the disciples when they ran up to those people amen who believed in John the Baptist they said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they didn't say you weren't believers they wanted to know have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe hallelujah amen then they said well what baptism were you baptized under oh I was baptizing in the Baptist doctrine huh John the Baptist right but there's no God then move on he's no longer allowing you're winking at that you must be baptized well in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it set them free is that right so you say what are you saying brother Brooks I'm saying the word of the Lord is right they could say wait a minute I know John was a prophet I was baptized under John and you can't tell me nothing well the children of Israel could have said the same thing when it came to putting the blood on the doorpost in a little I am a Jew don't tell me I've got to slaughter no animals and I don't have to put the blood on the doorposts in the little but you see what it was God's Word is truth God Word is light and God Ward is life and whenever God moves we must move with God God is a progression he never stays in one place even though he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah he's a God of the past he's a God of the present and he's a God of the future and he still is the same hallelujah see in this message he says we're we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock who would have thought that that's what it meant to be saved or to be a part of Christ to be wet locked but in spirit we are sons and daughters not just some not some other spirit but the Spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become sons and daughters not separate but the same spirit the same God the same person John in wedlock to the eternal is that all right one thing we do know is that God word is true hallelujah and those who are born of truth love truth and will do truth [Laughter] hallelujah I love that amen how that brother broke up broke that word down the earth last week and says you know how are you offended in me and showed that how how John the Baptist got offended had a a little nervous breakdown right because he did not understand he thought God Jesus Christ was coming to establish his kingdom right there he was going to sweep the threshing floor he was going to work it but eat John was not only looking in his day but he was looking in our day you see what I'm saying and then God Jesus Christ being compassionate says listen there is no greater prophet than John but go tell John he could have rebuked him like you ought to be ashamed of yourself you the one pointed me out now you asking that question he could have done that but he's full of grace and truth and he says no go tell John the blind see the lame is walking the Dom is talking right the captors are being set free let him know that I'm the one that's fulfilling the scriptures that have been prophesied hallelujah is that right because the Bible said Jesus Christ is prophecy hallelujah Lord y'all know what I said this morning y'all need to toss in some amens now even if the word is right the word is right you and I must understand him and when we draw on in heavily well out to the eternal God that's that's a part of him a part of God in flesh I become Brandon because of my father Branham you become part of your father in your mother but in the spirit we become in union with God is a part of God that's the reason that the spirit cannot die he that believeth on me has everlasting life and in that image that he is is on the earth and is in his likeness I raised him up in the last day not a spirit being but will have a body like God's glorious body Oh Lord normal medication normal pain normal sorrow see what we did not understand is that the perfect vision are in the perfect will of God was seeing us in our glorified state we came this way to suffer but then God turn that suffering into his glory somebody help me here see the devil thought that the perhaps we were suffice like a Joe if we suffer amen I'll get them to curse you Oh Joe if you die view it just that let him touch your flesh no no Joe has something on the inside that the devil couldn't touch why because God told him whatever you do don't touch the oil in the wine huh and that's the only reason why we're still protected because God has ordered the devil not to touch that sacred place in us may God help us tonight I'll raise him up in the last day not a spiritual being for we are having a body like God's glorious body the glorified body of the Lord Jesus Christ we raise up in His image and his likeness for I am the Lord and I changed not right that's Malachi 3 and 6 if we're gonna have this church and I talked about the unity this morning if we're gonna have this church full of God we can't be independent we must be unified this is not my work it's not yours it's God's and in order for God to really move in this church we must have a union right hello and this like I was saying this morning you know just like some of the people they had their arms folded you know and then sitting down and blocking God you know it wasn't that they were doing it on purpose but you see sometimes you lock yourself you don't even know what the devil is doing in this enemy come on somebody when we sit here and we all starchy that's not the Holy Spirit that's not the holy spirit that have a starchy not long ago some of the brothers from Iowa City and they probably hear me but anyway ain't calling no names but they were sitting on the net like they was in a lounge protocol you can't come before the king like that you're missing God you're looking at me but you missing God right he's got to be respectful if you don't you know if you don't if you're not respectful to the Holy Spirit how do you expect to receive anything and you know what is difficult for me when I have to talk like this but you know what God don't get me if I don't cuz when he showed me things I must say what he's saying nobody wants to become an enemy but if I can't become an enemy because I tell the truth then that's what it must be for I am the Lord I change not right and you and I realize a man that something has changed in this church it's not the way it used to be the zeal of God is not with the most of us hello it is I mean go and look back and listen to some of those old tapes and hear the joy and the unity we used to have where is it going everybody is because of selfishness everybody have their own agenda but God works in one Accord Ness when they got Israel on one Accord they defeated the enemy and when we can get this little fellowship on one Accord we are we we'll see Jesus that's the truth and the truth will make you free it'll set you free is that right it's just like brother branham said it you know you know let me say like this when you got prophecy and in speaking in tongues prophecy in speaking in tongues will not cross the preacher that's out of order it must wait to the preaching is over and then when that space come they can have it but it could be right the gift could be right but if it crosses the preacher it's wrong right so you and I must understand him and we must work together and it's supposed to be a line line line precept upon precept it's got to be like that only fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he have done for you and you and I must understand that the truth will make us free set us free whichever way you want to look at it but you're free where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and you and I need some Liberty in this place hallelujah people say well you don't try to pump me up I've heard brother Branham do it programs that raise your hands presents they clap their hands brother I think say hallelujah what was that you think they would have been running up and down the aisles because of the presence of the Lord but he had to prompt them to even worship help us Lord we like I was saying this morning we've got too much truth to be dead and still out of the millions of people in this world I don't know how many who really believe that Christians gone in the rapture been deceived by Lucifer yet you got the rapture immaterial the thing that's gonna make you have a rapture and we can't be excited while the journey is going on no sir the truth will make you free hallelujah there are no now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus why do you come here condemned when there is no condemnation hallelujah oh Lord the Bible according to 1st Samuel 12 24 says only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he have done for you 1st Samuel 12 24 or fear the Lord and that's the problem we don't feel him but don't reverse him like we ought to hallelujah but there should be a fear that should be a reverence amen this should be respecting men that we should have all come on somebody if I'm not careful I'll let it slip I've got I've got to move forward just as much as everybody else hmm serve Him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he have done for you is that okay now we know brother Branham is a true prophet let's we know he's Malachi for we know that God through him brought forth revelation 10 7 hello somebody Luke 1730 well we don't have no problem with that but you know what when we know that he is due we must allow us we must subject ourselves to the word that was preached whether we like it or not it may hurt but when it's truth you obey it first King 17 17 to 24 says and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him and she said unto Elisha what have I to do with thee o thou man of God I doubt coming to me to call my sins to remembrance and to slay my son now this is amazing because this lady she knows she's not perfect and she says did you come to to expose me to - to show my sins I'll recall them and to slay my son first of all she told Elijah don't give me no no no I'm okay the way I am me and my husband we live together we don't have a son but that's okay that's okay but Elijah says no I want to give you something and so he enquired and I think it was of the the servant said but one thing chief they don't have they don't have a child all right and so God gives this woman a child and brother and says around the age of 12 or whatever it was they were out in the field and he had a sunstroke and he died now this lady wouldn't it be better not to have a son then they have one and he died 12 he's just getting annoying hmm so you and I can empathize we can kind of move into the scriptures and see that this is a real painful situation even though all of the expressions are not there and he said to her give me that son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft and where he had bored and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said O Lord like God has thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I shall join by slaying her son now he's acquired little look but look how he's saying it he cried unto the Lord and says O Lord my god has thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son no we just gave her this child no you're bringing he saying evil and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the Lord and said O Lord my god I pray thee let this child soul coming to him again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came to him and he revived brother Brown said God did not even show Elijah what was happening he did not know and sometimes people think the prophets know everything God don't tell them everything God only tells them what he needs them to know at whatever time they need to know hallelujah and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the Lord as well so he was in desperation - he really wanted to see this lady blessed he didn't want to bring a curse into our house and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him into his mother and Elisha said see thy son liveth and the woman said to Elisha now by this I know thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord in the mouth is true hallelujah one incident well two gave her a son raised him from the dead and she says I know that's the point because you see when it came even to Joe Joe says I know my redeemer and God is going to let trials and tests fall upon you until you get the full picture you must know you must know he is truth he is life he is your substance he is your God he is your everything you must know he is your vajura he is Jewish alone he is your only rifle he is all in all you must know and God is going to bring you through those things but that's the whole thing he wants you to see the picture he's your husband he wants you to know him God could just drop it into your senses but there's nothing like experience nothing like it hallelujah Psalm 25 and 4 says show me thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths leave me in thy truth otherwise I wouldn't know which way to go but you must lead me into that truth and teach me this okay when you say teach me that means you gotta go through something but thou art the god of my salvation and on deed do I wait all da-ding that you don't hurry God you can't hurry God you just got to wait hallelujah hey man where this deliverance well as healing whatever it may be you got to wait on God is that right she that's the whole trick you got to understand that God does things according to his own will his own purpose and guess what he's really never late you know how that song say four days late but on time God never been late he's always been on time you may have been early but God has never been late right amen it's not when he raised Lazarus from the dead God knew he didn't even tell Jesus what to do until it was late if you want to put it that way already there by the time Jesus got to the two he had already lived in there for days but those are the times that when it seems like things are impossible that God makes possible he purposed it to look like it become oh it cannot happen what are you talking about yo God your husband your Lord your Savior makes it happen if you have faith to believe say to this mountain is that the word it is absolutely word straight to this mountain thank you Jesus that right she said I know I love that is that right Psalm 16:11 doubt will show me the path of life in that presence is the fullness of joy and at that right hand there are pleasures forevermore hallelujah hallelujah you know I love that because I realize Amen that you know this flesh you can't depend on it this flesh will fail you every time all you got to do is cross at one time and we'll see how much life is still in it here's somebody oh it's true I fight fresh every day I try to kill him every day he comes up I push him back down he comes up a knocking back down why because I don't want to live in the flesh if you live in the flesh you're gonna stop performing the deeds of the flesh right so the best thing you can do is keep him dead buried right so you can walk in the spirit calls it the walking in spirit is life right and the Bible says listen show me the path of life that has he shown it you know the path of life we preach the path of life is that right and in that presence is full full of sadness fullness of joy that but the way people bring it in here they like this Oh Lord them see y'all don't feel without sometimes being up here I see things I feel things I even hear things but I'm gonna tell you something by the grace of God I try to keep God channeled so I won't be distracted you know because I know the enemy but my enemy is not flesh and blood and spiritual wickedness a man leave me in that true teeth before teach me is that right but in the presence in thy presence is fullness of joy and at the right hand there are pleasures worth forevermore so the joy and the pleasure that you have in God is up to you if you stay in this presence it's unlimited y'all know maybe some of y'all may not know but when you go to a bar they put a limit on how much you can drink because they really want you to be able to walk out like you walked in and sometimes when they see that you have gotten over intoxicated they said no mo you may have the money to get it but they won't give it to you they cut you off not with God not with God stimulation he never cut you off you can be filled refill refill refilled you can get as much mini you know what I'm saying you can become so intoxicated with the Holy Spirit he'll never cut you off that's the truth if we're going to be drunk that would be drunk in the spirit and we can't be we can be our Joy's not based upon what people what people think you know none of us should be that way we should our joy is with Jesus and if we could allow our Jesus to fulfill us up then we'll be okay you'll be okay you understand me hallelujah in that presence is the fullness of joy at the right hand there are press this truth this truth will set you free this truth will take away your dead days your dead days and your dying day your sad days right come on you know the world when they get ready to get a little depressed or a little irritated you know what they do all y'all you want a drink yeah come on over today but we failed to do that some of us we failed to do that but he's right there waiting come unto me he's right there waiting this is truth I'm preaching Jesus is never out of reach he's always there he said don't even think I'm in the heavens on some faraway taking a trip he's a nun IV even in your mouth speak him and he'll show up hallelujah I feel like dancing right now let me do a little bit that felt pretty good but my thing is you and I must understand God is real the picture of this think about it we hardly ever think about it and I say we are to include myself but you know what I'm saying is we must work hard in prayer in fellowship to get us on one Accord as long as the devil can keep us divided by families and by distance he has us defeated think about this people of God God planted this church here and we will have to answer for every soul that was not witness to we will have to give an account because we are the light we're the light come on we're the light in this area God didn't set us here it meant for us to just come to church on Sunday mornings Sunday evenings where's the night no most of our works supposed to be darling out there and we were given a cow maybe nobody's come that's okay nor preached how many years 120 and all he got was eight souls but you know Noah had more members than that but as the time goes on church drops people stop coming he preached the same message brother Troy every time I look around he's gonna rain I don't heard that way message how many times you understand me that's the attitude of the people he ain't deep enough but all Nord needs to tell you to get in there off how deep do you want to go how deep can you get when the preachers trying to tell you you need to be born again and you need the purchase of Christ in you too God can seal you up that's the deep part of the message all the other things don't mean a thing until you get Christ in you but you ain't because you can't go in there Old Testament and type this out listen I'm going to preach what he tells me to preach well because I realize they meant that there are many preachers in this message we are not getting people to Christ there are people right now almost saying you don't need the Holy Ghost no more we're in the eighth day and we don't pass through this and we done done that and this and it's just a word hello I want somebody define the word to me the word the Bible said the word is not just letter only is that right Paul said I didn't come to you amen just preaching the word but I came preaching with power and demonstration that was vindication behind the word and if you have no vindication behind the wall it is not the Lord people got all the stuff going on and folks who are so gullible they've been moving right into it because they figure they gotta be deep to be saved Oh God is looking at a broken and contrite spirit that's what he needs he needs somebody Amen who repents as long it's me standing in the need of prayer it's the truth we need more Holy Ghost more spirit in here there's something wrong oh my god I could remember the time even when God first saved me I mean I went to church every day every time they had Church I was I was there you know what I'm saying people said I can go in the detail I'm not bragging on me but the Holy Ghost I knew I needed God I know I knew I needed that atmosphere to stand in this day when you don't get it the Holy Ghost and and you come here and you don't get none you leave out you don't get none and then you go out there to face the devil you already defeated especially if you don't have your own prayer life going on at home I have not yet seen a sad person who has a prayer life I have not seen a creature oh no it's a sign that somewhere your prayer life is not where it should be hmm is that all right because if you seek Him in the morning the Bob said he if you seek him early you you shall find him and that's how it is amen you see people they don't have the job because listen I'm telling you I know what God has been showing me truth you can't blame God for your condition whatever condition you're in it's all salt he has given you everything more than enough that's what the Bible said he is more than able to exceedingly give you a seemingly abundantly above whatsoever you ask or think is that true that's true boom hallelujah don't get me wrong we have our days of battling sometimes Satan just don't let let it come so easy he's always trying to steal your joy trying to take your peace hallelujah but you got to remember who you are hallelujah is that right I think what's cactus great they said when he thought he's smiling and whispered in your ear you a loser I'm gonna beat you and he kept saying that amen until the opponent believe it and when he saw in the eyes of the plummet he knew that all he does is bring the punch oh now he's done why because he had already defeated him in his mind and when the delica defeat you in your mind he knows he's got you already it's just ok but hold I was shaving in iniquity it's ended my his mother conceived me behold that desires truth where in the inward parts not here here in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know what wisdom who is wisdom but Jesus Christ when God gave Solomon wisdom he was giving Solomon the wisdom of Jesus Christ the wisdom of himself hallelujah and when God gives you wisdom what is he doing giving you the wisdom of himself because there is no other one wiser than God and even Solomon says I'm gonna give you the wisdom love God and keep his Commandments hmm behold our designs of truth in him upon and in the hidden parts now shall make me to know wisdom purged me from hit with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be later than snow huh purging is not easy every time I think I proper Janelle I see a scrubbing and a rubbing and a and some action to get it out of you come on so money did you know about God's grace amen in order for Locke to even get out of Sodom Ingemar the angels had to lead him by the hand get out of this place some time God just have to help us we know it we know it's right but some time God have to pull you out maybe I'm just talking about me but I'm gonna tell you something I've had some experiences with God and I'm not ashamed to say it because when God gives me victory I don't care how he has to do it as long as I have the victory make me to hear joy and gladness that the balls with doll has broken may rejoice hide that face from my sins blot out mine iniquity create in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me mmm this is a part cast me not away from thy presence God took came and cast him away take not thy Holy Spirit from me and God can take it if it's not in the soul if it's just on your spirit if it's just on your flesh but I'm said a person can have the Holy Ghost all this life and still go to hell why because it's just only flesh and on the spirit God needs to be in your soul where the Holies of Holies where the sheriff's rims look and the swept-back wings are there right restore unto me the joy of my salvation David says it so even in the condition listen this time and a man who's not under this inspiration but he knew he was saying he knew salvation had already come to his house but he somehow lost his joy and he says we're storing to me the joy of my salvation and behold uphold me with thy free spirit uphold me you up homie homie yeah listen Jesus said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and thou shalt cast it in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I said to you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them I'm gonna go back over that one therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that ye receive them not that you're going to receive them you received it right then when you asked you got it and ye shall have them right and when you stand praying here's the key because a lot of people don't understand why they prayers don't work when you stand praying forgive if you have aught against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses so it's when you don't you have something in your art against someone and you haven't made it right hello no matter what you do you tell the truth you make it right because that unforgiving and unconfessed sin is the only thing that a hinder god from moving in the way of your blessing or your prayer you love the Lord I'm almost done just just just bear with me I'm almost done I got one more scripture well we said this morning amen that it's the straight gate understand that this this truth everybody say they got truth but they're those who said well the church was built upon Peter the rock right and and and some said you know the church was built upon Peter some say the church were built upon you know the rod you know you your name is Peter now it's stone but it was not neither that it was truth the revelation see the book of Revelation Amen starts with that scripture where is it the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and we know that the true spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy is that right so the revelation of who Jesus Christ is because everybody says oh but he's the son of God watch it it's true but it's false if you believe he's the second person in the Trinity I got the Holy Ghost but it is true but it's false if you got the Holy Ghost and you think that the Holy Ghost is the third person in the Trinity it is not the Holy Ghost you possess because the Holy Ghost can only occupy you upon truth so if there is a spirit there that you think is all holy goes under the Trinitarian doctrine it is not truth because God can only vindicate truth and therefore there is an imposter this is the AC you understand me false doctrine will bring you false experiences it is that the it is the delusion of the devil right that's how the bunch that try the spirits to see whether they be of God if that spirit can acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh it will also show you that it is the oneness of God and that God in you listen if you just got the third person in you which is the Holy Ghost where is Jesus and the father jesus said him you got the son you got the father hmm and if I got the son and the father then I know I got the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost was what Jesus had that was that's what made him the son oh come on son when you and I that's true that's faith you know when people say well we don't need the blood you donate the blood watch it because it's true yes it's false we need the blood but it's the life of the blood we see you can't do away with the blood the blood was the lamb was slain with before the foundation of the world therefore the lamb was slain in the Garden of Eden therefore this lamb was slain on Calvary therefore the lamb while slain took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne it was a bloody lamb you cannot climb this ladder without the blood hallelujah it was the blood that gave entrance for the high priest as well as the priests you couldn't even get into the holy place without the blood and you definitely couldn't get into the Holies of Holies without the blood hallelujah and now you say what do you mean I'm saying it is the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of God it is the truth of God I don't care how deep your revelation is because all we in this when we done by yarn listen all y'all pillow coasters this net let me tell you something when somebody can produce what brother branham produce then you can talk to me [Laughter] then you can talk to me hallelujah because I'll know that the same God that was with brother branham's with you but no preacher I don't care who it is there is only one Malachi 4 and these preachers under Malachi 4 is only here to resound what he's already sounded when you see these people building kingdoms and things are there sell of their own that's not of God we're not here to separate the bride we're here to bring the unity and the only way we can have a unity is to have a unity of the Spirit and that all slick devil is trying to take the Holy Ghost away from us but that is the only thing that will unite us only thing it is what United them on the day of Pentecost it is the thing that will unite us when he returned hallelujah if that same spirit that being you that that was in Christ Jesus being you as it quitted his body it will also click the nose but you think gonna get you up Jesus Christ was the Lord himself but he need that quickening power to get up out of the grave and you're gonna need it too everybody gonna need it sittin up in these day and message churches for our Lord the teachers then killed the people took away the bride took away the the power of the word the power of the bride which is the Holy Spirit it got listen what have you dumb and uneducated hmm how you going to understand some of these deep things these preachers of bringing and let me tell you something the devil as sleek as a serpent is that right he's using the same coach I'm using it but you know what the devil can't do he can't keep it straight he's always twisted so y'all better study our word you better look in there and keep praying because I'm gonna tell you something people of God our greatest enemy you know as ourselves of course but understand the battle in Egypt was between brothers I said Egypt I'm in Eden the battle in Eden was between brothers the Battle of Jacob and Esau was between brothers the Battle of Calvary was between brothers did y'all know that Judas and Jesus was from the tribe of Judah they were brothers and your biggest battle in ain't the denominations out there they come in they are coming but you better realize the only spirit yet to be made manifest is Judas himself the 70 has already been manifested but the brother he's coming with his Judas Kiss he's coming guess what l.o.v.e you gotta love him just like Jesus love to us less than Oh Lord you've been so good to us let's pray father I feel you're 19 I feel your presence Lord you're so good to us Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves dear Heavenly Father there's so many things that are creeping around this message so many things that affecting the people of God so many people are being swallowed up a man by by the inspirations of those who followed Moses but Oh God have mercy upon us may we be a Joshua and Caleb Lord may we have a different spirit father may we see what's behind the veil knowing that our Lord out from you to do come our strength and our guidance there's
