[28:01] brother John last time he was here what
[28:04] a real blessing thank God for his
[28:10] amazing grace
[28:11] Dennis's 26 1 26 through 28 Genesis 1:26
[28:19] to 28 then God said let us make man in
[28:26] our image after our likeness and let
[28:31] them have dominion over the fish of the
[28:34] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[28:36] over the cattle and over all the earth
[28:39] and every or and over every creeping
[28:42] thing that creepeth upon the earth so
[28:46] God created man in his own image and in
[28:50] the image of critics of God created he
[28:53] him male and female created he them and
[28:59] God blessed them and God said unto them
[29:01] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[29:04] the earth and subdue it and have
[29:08] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[29:10] over the fowl of the air and over every
[29:13] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[29:18] let us pray
[29:20] dear Heavenly Father we come before your
[29:23] Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we
[29:26] thank you for your amazing grace we
[29:30] thank you for your presence father and
[29:34] we thank you Lord for your grace and how
[29:37] you give us even more grace when we need
[29:41] it bless each and every heart here this
[29:45] evening or this morning Lord as we
[29:47] approach a word there is nothing I can
[29:51] say to these people but I pray that
[29:54] you'll let your ministering spirit let
[29:57] your angel come down and speak to your
[29:59] people father break and destroy the
[30:02] yokes are the enemy heal and deliver
[30:04] Lord whatever that is needed Oh God I
[30:08] pray that your grace and mercy would be
[30:11] with us this morning have thine own way
[30:14] Lord and
[30:15] cleanse us and forgive us for any and
[30:17] everything that we may have done
[30:19] Oh God that has been displeasing in that
[30:22] sight let nothing Lord that I may have
[30:25] said or done or even thought hinder this
[30:29] service cleanse us from all
[30:32] unrighteousness Lord in Jesus Christ's
[30:34] name we pray amen
[30:36] you may be seated for a long time in our
[30:44] Christian journey we perhaps had our
[30:48] understanding or our thoughts of what
[30:52] salvation is and was all about but in
[30:58] these last days we have had a profit
[31:02] that God revealed his thoughts to and
[31:07] this profit was the very voice of God
[31:11] for our age we realize now that the
[31:18] prophet of God is going off to sea but
[31:22] the voice that echoed through his voice
[31:25] is still alive and we realized that
[31:31] salvation is a plan of God that we must
[31:37] realize that only God can do is that
[31:41] right the Bible says salvation is of the
[31:44] Lord you can't save yourself I can't
[31:48] save myself
[31:49] no one of not one of us can save
[31:52] ourselves but the question is what are
[31:57] we being saved from and you and I must
[32:02] understand that salvation as I said is
[32:05] of the Lord and therefore God is saving
[32:07] us from something when Adam and Eve was
[32:11] in the Garden of Eden before the fall
[32:14] they did not need salvation they were in
[32:18] perfect harmony with God it was after
[32:23] the fall the place
[32:27] salvation came into play first of all we
[32:32] realized by God's grace that Adam found
[32:35] himself in a place that he had never
[32:37] been before and Adam found himself naked
[32:41] and Adam found himself lost and when the
[32:47] voice of God came in the cool of the
[32:49] evening Adam Adam we're out now
[32:53] Adam was hiding because he also found
[32:58] that he was naked now before the fall
[33:02] Adam was naked
[33:04] but since sin had now come in Adam
[33:09] realized that his nakedness was not the
[33:12] way that he was to present himself
[33:14] before God because before the fall Adam
[33:19] was clothed in the glory of God he was
[33:24] robed in holiness he was clothed a man
[33:31] with the Shekinah glory but after the
[33:35] fall it brought in a separation between
[33:38] man and God we call it according to the
[33:43] prophets terminology breach there was a
[33:47] breach now that there is a gap we need a
[33:51] savior we needed somebody to bridge the
[33:55] gap some of the things that I saw in the
[34:00] scripture is that we realize Amen this
[34:03] morning that that that mankind had now
[34:07] Lord himself to a beast and though he
[34:11] were in the image of a beast he was not
[34:14] a beast because he had God on the inside
[34:18] and everybody that doesn't have God on
[34:21] the inside is nothing other than a beast
[34:25] but it was a God that we had on the
[34:28] inside that made us who and what we were
[34:34] and are and so
[34:40] evasion was not only just to pull
[34:43] someone out of the river but it was also
[34:47] to quicken him and bring him back to
[34:50] life
[34:51] you know how somebody is drowned and
[34:53] they still got that moment of time that
[34:56] they could be resuscitated that
[34:59] individual put their mouths on that
[35:01] mouth and pumps and you know the
[35:03] procedures that they do and it's all
[35:06] about bringing that person back to life
[35:10] because God said to Adam the day that
[35:13] you eat of this tree you should surely
[35:15] die Adam did die spiritually because
[35:19] realizing amen by God's grace when you
[35:22] are separated from God you are dead even
[35:26] the Bible tells us that as a woman if
[35:28] she lives in pleasure though she lives
[35:30] she's dead
[35:32] and so we realize Amen that we have been
[35:36] chosen as children of God to be in the
[35:42] very image and likeness of God this is
[35:43] what Adam the first Adam was all about
[35:46] and even though he was earthly he bore
[35:49] power and authority he he had dominion
[35:53] over the fish and the sea had dominion
[35:55] over all of God's creation everything
[35:58] that moved
[35:59] Adam had dominion but because a man the
[36:04] devil introduced unbelief he introduced
[36:08] doubt and when he any when he introduced
[36:12] doubt and unbelief to Eve Amen it also
[36:16] brought about fear all the attributes of
[36:20] death accompanied the fall of Adam and
[36:25] Eve and to be honest with you when we're
[36:30] born into this world we are recipients
[36:34] of their fall everything that Adam and
[36:39] Eve lost we lost one thing about Adam
[36:44] and Eve they had the opportunity of
[36:47] knowing what it meant to be ruler they
[36:50] understood the authority that they had
[36:54] but you know like many Christians they
[36:57] did not appreciate it enough to hold on
[37:00] to it my subject this morning is the
[37:06] creation of God in you the creation of
[37:14] God in you because God just didn't come
[37:21] to restore us to what we call a
[37:27] restoration of the first Adam because
[37:31] God bypassed that one because the first
[37:35] Adam was just the Lord over the earth
[37:42] but the second Adam was lord over heaven
[37:46] in earth so God comes to restore us and
[37:51] to bring us to a higher level of his
[37:54] creation a level that once it's reached
[37:59] you and I will never have to worry or be
[38:02] concerned about falling again because
[38:08] this world that God is now making an
[38:11] establishing he's doing it for a people
[38:19] that have been time tested a people that
[38:24] know good and evil but they choose good
[38:29] over evil see in the beginning Adam they
[38:34] didn't know good and evil and they chose
[38:37] evil over good but this second Adam
[38:42] the second creation is given good and
[38:47] evil and they choose good this is why
[38:51] Amen Jesus told them make the tree good
[38:55] or make it evil hallelujah and how can
[39:00] we make this tree good when we were born
[39:04] evil
[39:06] see God only God had the solution before
[39:11] the foundation of the world he put a
[39:13] seed on the inside of us
[39:18] hallelujah I thank God that he is a sore
[39:21] oh come on somebody because you got to
[39:25] realize that the seed in which God's
[39:27] soul was good there are bad seats but
[39:31] the Bible said the wicked one he sold
[39:33] those seeds but the good seed can never
[39:36] be transformed into a bad seed
[39:40] hallelujah God has a law that every
[39:44] seemeth bring forth of its kind is that
[39:48] right
[39:49] amen listen Robert God says in adoption
[39:53] for this may just choke you to death but
[39:58] did you know that mean that a sons of
[40:01] God are a mature gods how many ever know
[40:05] that how many knows that Jesus said so
[40:09] the Bible Jesus said did you did not
[40:13] your law say itself that ye are God's
[40:17] and if you are call them God which God
[40:22] said in Genesis 2 that they were God's
[40:25] because they were have full dominion
[40:29] over the Dominion of the earth
[40:31] he didn't say portion Dominion he said
[40:34] full hallelujah even he had four
[40:38] dominion over is that right commercial
[40:42] Ari
[40:42] not only did God give this second
[40:45] creation dominion over the earth but he
[40:47] gave us dominion over heaven is that
[40:50] right
[40:50] the Bible said cast down every evil
[40:54] imagination that exalts itself against
[40:58] the Word of God hallelujah so we have
[41:02] the ability to not only rule here but
[41:06] rule there but you got to be built up
[41:11] God ain't gonna use a child you got to
[41:15] go through something you got to go
[41:17] through a lot of tests you got to go
[41:19] through a
[41:20] other hardships hallelujah but you don't
[41:23] worry about it
[41:24] the victory is ours God has already
[41:27] given us a big tray ba because the power
[41:32] is in the DNA
[41:37] Alleluia that they listen he give him
[41:41] dominion over all things and he lost his
[41:44] God ship
[41:45] he lost his sonship he lost his Dominion
[41:48] Satan took it over
[41:51] but brother we are waiting for the
[41:54] manifestations of the sons of God who
[41:57] will come back and take it over again
[42:01] writing for the fullness of time when
[42:05] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[42:08] full sons of God would be manifested
[42:11] when the power of God will walk out
[42:13] hallelujah and will take every power
[42:17] that Satan got away from him
[42:19] come on sematic demon we're not gonna
[42:22] ask forward with taking it back
[42:24] everything that the devil stole from us
[42:27] we're taking it back hallelujah that's
[42:32] why the devil even he says he tries to
[42:35] fight you and in destroys you in the
[42:38] area of faith because he know that faith
[42:43] can move mountains hello faith can stop
[42:47] the Sun and I'm not talking about the
[42:50] su-lin I'm talking about the s/o in is
[42:52] that right faith can do create all
[42:57] things is that right the Bible said by
[42:59] faith God created hallelujah and when
[43:04] God was creating I was there you were
[43:08] there hallelujah but we need to elevate
[43:11] our minds we need to come up and realize
[43:17] Amen that God is beyond anything we can
[43:24] imagine
[43:26] one of the brothers and I his name
[43:28] brother Richard shared something with me
[43:30] yesterday and and I wasn't gonna
[43:32] implement it but I thought with the
[43:34] subject that God was giving me because I
[43:35] know that everybody every one of us are
[43:37] going through great battles and when
[43:41] you're going through battles you know
[43:44] that's when the sacrifice of praise must
[43:47] be it's difficult to praise God when
[43:53] you're in pain but you say give him the
[43:56] praise hallelujah
[43:59] is that right joke didn't have what we
[44:02] had but job said though he's lame I'm
[44:06] gonna trust him y'all huh yeah somebody
[44:09] help me here this morning
[44:11] Amen we got to come up because the devil
[44:15] is trying to bring us down but we are
[44:18] the resurrection hallelujah amen
[44:22] wherever he takes us we come back up
[44:24] y'all hear me it doesn't matter how low
[44:27] he dangerous we come back is that right
[44:33] it just went fall seven times in a day
[44:35] and the Bible said he gets up hallelujah
[44:39] I appreciate the Brethren who helps me
[44:45] out sometimes you know they people
[44:49] forget you know the pastor you know he's
[44:52] part / - and you know I go through my
[44:57] battles I have my test the fact I'm
[44:59] going through a lot of things I call it
[45:01] the flood it's okay to go through the
[45:03] flood when you realize who the standard
[45:05] is and you got to realize I understand
[45:08] it if God has brought a flood then I
[45:12] must stand
[45:13] did you realize what a flood is let's
[45:17] take let's take the tsunami that hit a
[45:19] man Japan what did it do everything that
[45:23] was in his way it moved it out of the
[45:25] way it disintegrated the like like an
[45:29] atomic bomb had hit the place everything
[45:32] that thought it had a foundation was
[45:35] moved out of the way right so what do
[45:39] you think happening to you you're doing
[45:43] things you know you shouldn't be doing
[45:46] because
[45:47] you test you allowing Satan to move you
[45:53] off your foundation where is the where
[45:56] is the standard God place us here to win
[46:01] the battles not to lose them and he put
[46:07] that test on you because he knew you
[46:10] loved him enough to stay so y'all hear
[46:13] me
[46:14] patience is in love love waits for
[46:18] everything
[46:19] is that right let me live it living let
[46:22] me go back to this flood because the
[46:24] Lord just showed me the other day
[46:25] because I've been listening the greatest
[46:27] battle ever fought was in your mind and
[46:29] didn't realize I was going through the
[46:30] greatest battle didn't understand that
[46:33] God was speaking directly to me at this
[46:36] present time and I thought to myself I
[46:40] said Lord you know how we do sometimes
[46:43] we let these battles in our mind we
[46:46] don't even realize that God is testing
[46:48] us
[46:49] we don't even know that these battles
[46:52] have come they have come to make us
[46:55] stronger and we just allow save them
[46:58] battle in our mind
[46:59] Oh nobody don't see me I just lost one I
[47:02] just lost - oh I yield to do this I
[47:05] yielded to death and you know not even
[47:06] thinking that because of your failing to
[47:09] overcome and to gain victory in these
[47:12] mind battles you're not moving forward
[47:18] because we say they just mind battles oh
[47:20] the devil devil is battling me but what
[47:23] are you doing with the battle what are
[47:27] you doing with the fight is that right
[47:30] it's not how big the like like the
[47:32] Prophet I said it's not how big or how
[47:34] small the dog is is how big the fighters
[47:37] in the dog Paulo lujah I cannot see
[47:42] myself surrendering to this world or the
[47:46] things of this world because I'm under
[47:49] fire
[47:55] hallelujah because greater is He that's
[47:59] in us than he that is in the world it is
[48:05] amazing how we want to quit on God when
[48:08] it's the devil that's doing us that way
[48:12] it is the devil who comes to kill steal
[48:15] and destroy don't get an attitude with
[48:20] God he's on your side
[48:24] the Bible says oh the depth of the
[48:27] riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
[48:30] of God how unsearchable are his
[48:33] judgments and his ways past finding out
[48:37] listen you can't judge God
[48:41] his ways are parents finding out I
[48:44] always tell people I said listen one
[48:47] thing for certain you wasn't a Jonah God
[48:50] didn't throw you in the belly of a whale
[48:54] hallelujah somebody help me here and God
[48:58] used oh because God made Jonah
[49:00] and God to use you because God made you
[49:04] if God want to send you to the fire
[49:07] who's going to stop him that's why the
[49:12] Bible said in all things give thanks o
[49:21] you who have known the mind of the Lord
[49:26] or who have been his counselor or who
[49:32] has first given it to him and it shall
[49:35] be recompense unto him again for of him
[49:39] and through him and to him and all
[49:43] things to whom glory forever amen
[49:49] hallelujah think about it when you and I
[49:56] must
[49:56] understand that God can do whatever he
[49:59] wants to do god don't care about how you
[50:06] look or how you think you look when he
[50:12] wants to use you he'll use you I think
[50:18] it was Seymour who had a cross-eyed or
[50:19] something it was something a bad about
[50:23] his appearance but you think that
[50:26] stopped that man from calling on the
[50:30] name of the Lord Jesus in a time when
[50:35] when when when Apostolic or holiness
[50:38] people were literally called crazy but
[50:43] there was something on the inside of
[50:45] Seymour that wanted God no matter what
[50:52] the cost
[50:53] that's the only way you're going to get
[50:55] him is when you want him so that there
[50:58] is not a price that the devil can give
[51:01] you nothing he can pay you to keep you
[51:05] from getting to God great is the Lord
[51:09] and greatly to be praised and his
[51:12] greatness is unsearchable now I want you
[51:18] to understand it's talking about the God
[51:20] that's in you his greatness is
[51:23] unsearchable now if he's in you your
[51:30] greatness is unsearchable but if we
[51:36] limit ourselves hallelujah
[51:42] sometimes amen you think out this way I
[51:45] think if God turned water into wine and
[51:50] the water has no soul what is just water
[51:56] and he did that for people at a wedding
[52:01] and most of those people perhaps was
[52:06] going to get tipsy and whatever law
[52:10] he turned the water in what he did a
[52:13] favor somebody help me then if I've got
[52:18] a condition that's more important than
[52:22] turning water into wine
[52:25] is there anything too hard for God
[52:33] somebody help me here
[52:35] when does God I'm skipping my notes but
[52:39] when does God becomes real to you
[52:44] everybody said he no God
[52:46] oh I worship God but is he real is he
[52:54] tangible can you get a hold of him when
[52:59] you need it
[53:00] can you talk to it and hear talk back
[53:05] it's God real don't you tell him that
[53:09] any what's the use of being a Christian
[53:12] if he ain't real somewhere down the road
[53:16] your faith must become sight is that
[53:22] right
[53:23] Abraham had never seen him before but he
[53:28] knew advice Abraham moved by his voice
[53:33] never seeing God before but because of
[53:36] him faith Abraham had faith in Putin it
[53:42] brought the invisible God to a place of
[53:45] visibility and one day the very God that
[53:49] Abraham was worshiping walked on the
[53:52] scene that's how real God is it happened
[53:57] with our own prophet the very god he
[54:01] believed in one day showed up as a
[54:04] pillar of high as the angel of the Lord
[54:08] somebody help me see God becomes real
[54:12] when he does things for you hmm
[54:18] David David was a shepherd boy scoring
[54:21] of his own daddy his dad was a
[54:24] shame of him right wanted to hide him
[54:27] away from Samuel Sammy said no you got
[54:31] one more hallelujah y'all hear me
[54:35] heaven Sammy said no there's got to be
[54:38] one more God tells me there's what I
[54:40] need to not see and that's what you must
[54:43] understand sometimes being an outcast of
[54:46] being the black sheep of the family is
[54:48] not so bad hallelujah
[54:53] you know mo you might be the black sheep
[54:55] in this family this earthly family but
[54:57] in God's eyes you're the chosen one
[55:01] hallelujah because all of us can relate
[55:03] to it amen how our natural families have
[55:06] treated us but when it comes to God like
[55:12] somebody says I got a seat at the table
[55:14] I got carried away there but dear you
[55:21] and I must realize Amen that our God is
[55:26] God when does he become real to you
[55:31] he said you know in that day I am in the
[55:35] father the father's in me and I am in
[55:37] you now if I got the God if you got the
[55:41] ins unsearchable God in you or you got
[55:43] the omnipotent in you then what what
[55:45] what what cannot be done do you have
[55:51] power over demons did God say tell you
[55:56] you have power over demons he said
[55:59] whatsoever you do in word or deed do it
[56:02] all in the name of Jesus car he didn't
[56:05] say figure it out
[56:06] he didn't say mathematically work it out
[56:09] he said if you have say if you can
[56:13] believe it it'll come to pass but the
[56:18] problem is we reason we allow Satan to
[56:25] come and reason you know it somehow God
[56:30] has so much patience with us and we
[56:32] think about how you know Peter walked on
[56:34] the water and then all of a sudden you
[56:36] started reason
[56:37] y'all note I'm sorry that's what we do
[56:40] we start out in the battle amen yo I'm
[56:43] coming devil and all of a sudden he
[56:46] flashes the waves in your face the water
[56:50] is hitting you the pressure and all of
[56:52] the things of life is coming at you and
[56:54] all of a sudden you're looking around
[56:56] like oh my god how is this gonna happen
[56:58] as soon as you do that you began to sing
[57:02] God is a God that can make the
[57:04] impossible possible
[57:08] huh he is the god I serve and you need
[57:12] to be the God that you sir
[57:15] hallelujah fear not little flock it is
[57:19] the father's good pleasure to give you
[57:20] what the kingdom don't worry about it
[57:23] Hebrews 1:10 says and our Lord in the
[57:28] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[57:30] earth and the heavens are the works of
[57:31] thine hand they shall perish but thou
[57:34] remain it and they that they all shall
[57:36] wax cold as death a garment and as a
[57:39] vesture sure I'll fold them up and they
[57:41] shall be changed but thou art the same
[57:44] no matter what changes around here God
[57:47] is the same and the years shall not fail
[57:52] but to which of the Angels said he at
[57:55] any time sit on my right hand until I
[57:59] make thine enemy thy footstool are they
[58:02] not all ministering spirits sent forth
[58:05] to minister for them who shall be heirs
[58:07] of salvation this is why we miss it
[58:11] because we look at brother Brooks and
[58:13] you out wish you could see my notes most
[58:16] of the time most of the time I'm
[58:18] speaking what he wants me to speak and
[58:20] we fail to see there's an angel standing
[58:23] right here speaking to me talking to me
[58:26] not just me every minister that's
[58:29] ministered are given as a gift from God
[58:32] as an angel that ministers to him not
[58:36] just a prophet but every preacher a
[58:40] ministering spirits and there are angels
[58:44] that know the future that knows the
[58:47] presence and that knows amen what took
[58:49] place in the past
[58:51] and they stand here as litsa fire up a
[58:54] men speaking to you and we'll go well
[58:58] know what that what not a good sermon
[59:03] and you fail to hear but the Bible said
[59:08] lost sheep here is my voice you know
[59:13] when you've been in the military a
[59:14] little bar one thing for certain they
[59:16] will build you up there were high q--
[59:19] and said oh you got to go at this thing
[59:21] and you got to do this even even in when
[59:23] it comes to sports it is that right you
[59:26] see any men before they get out there to
[59:28] battle they jump in and all oh whatever
[59:32] they say nowadays a man but the whole
[59:35] thing is to get them into the atmosphere
[59:38] a football or get them into the
[59:42] atmosphere whatever it may be is out I'm
[59:45] saying amen and folks that's what the
[59:48] preachers all about you and I are in the
[59:51] greatest battle right now that right the
[59:56] battles in your mind every one of us
[1:00:01] fighting hallelujah everyone up let's
[1:00:06] put this way got battles we got going on
[1:00:08] and what is it the battle between Christ
[1:00:11] and the Antichrist and the Antichrist
[1:00:15] will always tell you something contrary
[1:00:18] to the word is that right now you've got
[1:00:21] to determine if you don't know your word
[1:00:23] how you gonna know who's speaking to you
[1:00:25] hallelujah
[1:00:26] is that right because remember that
[1:00:29] devil use exactly almost all the words
[1:00:32] God said to admony almost everything but
[1:00:37] he change the meaning of it by adding
[1:00:40] one word y'all hear me I'm saying
[1:00:43] something to you because I want you to
[1:00:45] realize by God's grace
[1:00:47] you're not going to oh I got something
[1:00:49] for you this morning here you know we
[1:00:51] look at things and we fail to see that
[1:00:54] if one word broken
[1:00:56] brought us into this chaos we must
[1:01:00] believe the whole word
[1:01:03] and have faith in it you can't just love
[1:01:08] God when everything's going good you got
[1:01:11] to love God why because this is a
[1:01:14] marriage ceremony this is a marriage
[1:01:17] situation these are the devlins part
[1:01:20] situation and death would never do his
[1:01:22] part but I remember those vows for
[1:01:27] better for worse oh my god don't you we
[1:01:30] love the better I can go shopping but
[1:01:37] when the worst can't law I don't have it
[1:01:41] you see we have a hard time with the
[1:01:44] worst oh you thought your husband was a
[1:01:48] prince and he wasn't gonna have no
[1:01:49] mistakes he's human oh you thought your
[1:01:52] wife was gonna be perfect and she wasn't
[1:01:54] gonna have no mistakes she's human
[1:01:56] hallelujah and guess what brother Brown
[1:01:59] said he takes those two stones and
[1:02:02] rubble God elected you to rub each other
[1:02:07] together to smooth each other out colony
[1:02:12] and so you must understand
[1:02:15] we're stones and we rub against things
[1:02:19] hallelujah
[1:02:20] but God is robbing and moving all of
[1:02:22] those were pieces all of those sharp
[1:02:24] edges y'all know what the sharp edges
[1:02:27] are how many those with a hammer tools
[1:02:30] that we have with one another God see
[1:02:32] you gotta get rid of that you're not
[1:02:35] gonna have that in heaven you got to
[1:02:43] remember that you didn't come Amen just
[1:02:45] to be a church you come to conquer you
[1:02:50] were born a warrior hallelujah
[1:02:56] you know it's amazing how you know in on
[1:02:59] television they got all now I think they
[1:03:01] got a lot of superheroes now that are
[1:03:04] women with a natural type the spiritual
[1:03:08] say the knows he's being whipped right
[1:03:12] now by a woman
[1:03:16] all her the bride and you must realized
[1:03:20] by God's grace you can't become that
[1:03:22] until you train you know how you train
[1:03:25] you got all these pairs in the beginning
[1:03:27] but they remove the past the past got to
[1:03:31] go you got to feel that blow hallelujah
[1:03:36] you have to feel that pain well because
[1:03:38] that area needs to be strengthened I'm
[1:03:42] sorry God cannot spare us
[1:03:45] hallelujah we're gonna be rulers of
[1:03:47] heaven
[1:03:51] listen in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:54] he said now remember this Christ in the
[1:03:58] true church is a continuation of the
[1:04:00] book of Acts
[1:04:01] now we don't heard this quote so many
[1:04:03] time but how many of us have been
[1:04:05] fighting for it but the book of
[1:04:08] Revelation shows how the Antichrist
[1:04:10] spirit will come into the church and
[1:04:12] defile it by what way making the Word of
[1:04:17] God of none effect coming in here salty
[1:04:21] and cold coming here in all upset and
[1:04:24] everything else and you can't even give
[1:04:26] God worship
[1:04:28] he's a snicker hallelujah most of the
[1:04:32] time you don't even have problems until
[1:04:34] you about ready to come to church he is
[1:04:38] a slicker amen and you and I must
[1:04:41] realize amen his whole purpose is to
[1:04:43] make you lukewarm because he knows God
[1:04:46] attitude about being lukewarm right
[1:04:50] tsommo and it's a sad thing as a pastor
[1:04:54] and don't get me wrong I'm not talking
[1:04:56] to the people that really need help in
[1:04:57] cause but I have people calling me you
[1:05:00] know almost trying to tell me well you
[1:05:02] know imma use this as a scenario should
[1:05:04] I eat white bread or wheat that's just
[1:05:10] how ridiculous it gets eat a piece of
[1:05:16] each to satisfy you right but people
[1:05:23] don't understand by God's grace and then
[1:05:25] there are certain things missing God did
[1:05:28] not call me to be a priest
[1:05:34] is that right how are you going to come
[1:05:36] to know God if you don't get on your
[1:05:38] knees yourself cry out to God yourself
[1:05:42] but the truth is we need each other I'm
[1:05:45] not against about praying for one
[1:05:47] another but there are times and then you
[1:05:49] need to call on the name of the larger
[1:05:51] cell is that right you need to know him
[1:05:59] you need to know him so well that when
[1:06:01] he speaks you know it's him you don't
[1:06:05] have the question whether it be his
[1:06:07] voice you know his voice is this okay
[1:06:13] see this this making it lukewarm and
[1:06:18] falling powerless and I hate I hate it I
[1:06:21] hate seeing a powerless congregation
[1:06:25] that's those were my words see it
[1:06:28] exposes Satan revealing the works
[1:06:32] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:06:34] and the discretion excuse me
[1:06:37] discrediting of God's Word right down to
[1:06:40] the time you know here it is we got the
[1:06:42] coming of the Lord and we still battling
[1:06:44] on what we should wear and what we
[1:06:45] shouldn't wear trivial things hallelujah
[1:06:51] we ought to be a past what what is godly
[1:06:54] and what is not godly that right we
[1:07:01] shouldn't eat oh those of us Amen you
[1:07:03] know I don't mean to sound like I'm
[1:07:05] screaming but I'm really in a place in
[1:07:07] my life I want to see the supernatural I
[1:07:10] want to see God on the move I want to
[1:07:12] see not just in me I see God I see God
[1:07:15] in me but I'm talking about the church
[1:07:27] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:07:31] the lake of fire and said he is
[1:07:32] discrediting the church he fights that
[1:07:37] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:07:40] people get the true revelation of the
[1:07:42] true church and what if she is he didn't
[1:07:46] say what they are
[1:07:48] she is individually and what she stands
[1:07:53] for and that she can do the greater
[1:07:57] works she will be an invincible army
[1:08:00] hello why because he is unsearchable and
[1:08:04] if he's in you you unsearchable and if
[1:08:07] he's invincible you are invincible but
[1:08:13] we let our trials knock us knock it down
[1:08:16] oh woe is me woe is me with all this
[1:08:21] power you got even in your mouth did you
[1:08:25] know that the Bible says even lay on
[1:08:27] your tongue he says life and death is
[1:08:29] within right there hmm
[1:08:32] and you and I must realize that Satan
[1:08:34] want to keep us in that loose place cuz
[1:08:38] he knows that if we ever ever get out of
[1:08:41] his little box will expand he knows he's
[1:08:45] in trouble but don't you understand this
[1:08:47] it's already prophesied the word has
[1:08:51] already been spoken Alleluia is not him
[1:08:54] that will it know he that run it the God
[1:08:56] who shows mercy hallelujah don't you
[1:08:59] know God has already determined who you
[1:09:01] gonna be and what you gonna be
[1:09:03] hallelujah the devil lookin at you and
[1:09:05] he's a puzzle he's puzzled he doesn't
[1:09:07] know it meant because he sees all those
[1:09:09] weaknesses but see he underestimated
[1:09:11] Samson two and God had a surprise with
[1:09:19] him right now you look like you weak and
[1:09:23] you don't have nothing going for you but
[1:09:24] don't you worry all you need to do is
[1:09:27] get before God says Oh Lord once more
[1:09:30] well see what we fail to see is we
[1:09:34] always people always do do things the
[1:09:37] hard way
[1:09:37] the Bible says seek you first the
[1:09:39] kingdom of God and its righteousness and
[1:09:41] all these things will be at it but we
[1:09:43] want God to add all these things and God
[1:09:45] I'll get righteous then no no it doesn't
[1:09:48] work that way you get righteous first
[1:09:50] and God will add hallelujah is that okay
[1:09:55] Amen see what it is Amen by God's grace
[1:09:59] if the true revelation of the two
[1:10:00] spirits within the framework of the
[1:10:01] Christian Church that was so powerful
[1:10:03] that was so powerful how the mark of the
[1:10:06] beast and all of that is right there
[1:10:07] before us and right in our faces will we
[1:10:12] choose a church over the holy spirit and
[1:10:16] we do it it all depends on what the
[1:10:20] preacher who the preacher is hallelujah
[1:10:24] and we are believing over the word
[1:10:29] prevent him didn't preached no separate
[1:10:32] word he preached the same word God just
[1:10:37] elevated it magnified it even preached
[1:10:42] that a church is supposed to diminish he
[1:10:46] preached a message that will increase us
[1:10:49] bring us a minute to the heavens
[1:10:51] hallelujah is that right that's what he

[1:11:03] to be in the atmosphere how she supposed
[1:11:05] to go beyond the sound barrier you know
[1:11:19] there's a lot of ground to cover but

[1:11:27] world is appealing to us Oh Samson Oh

[1:14:14] they have no right not having they have
[1:14:17] no right having an iPhone hello it's
[1:14:24] hard for those of us who have the Holy

[1:14:52] everything else and you know and I'm
[1:14:54] here it is people having trouble with
[1:14:56] their marriages and everything else I'm
[1:14:59] now I'm looking that way because I don't
[1:15:00] want to see nobody spirit but my point
[1:15:06] is here's the brother telling me about
[1:15:08] his wife and everything else and he
[1:15:10] flips through his cards his pitches for
[1:15:12] God he had it violated my eyes and you
[1:15:20] know the Holy Ghost is funny
[1:15:21] the hold it goes to something else he

[1:15:33] say nothing I didn't have to say
[1:15:34] anything
[1:15:34] you busted boy God just got you you know
[1:15:39] and instead of say Oprah Bruce I'm so
[1:15:41] sorry he moved on like nothing she he's
[1:15:44] bound and he's wondering why he's having
[1:15:48] a problem with this marriage who help me
[1:15:51] Lord see I want you to understand that
[1:15:54] the only way Satan can get into your
[1:15:57] life is that you must open the door
[1:16:00] right because he come knocking don't
[1:16:03] mean you have to open the door and what
[1:16:07] door you opening you opened the door of
[1:16:09] your mind and the greatest battle ever
[1:16:12] fought he says is your mind that opens
[1:16:15] up the door
[1:16:16] or closes the door and listen to your
[1:16:19] conscience listen to your memory listen
[1:16:22] to your affections but when your mind
[1:16:24] closes itself to these things and let
[1:16:27] God the spirit of his word come in it
[1:16:30] blows the rest of the stuff out every
[1:16:33] doubt is called every fear is gone every
[1:16:36] sensation is gone every feeling is gone
[1:16:39] there's nothing standing there but the
[1:16:41] Word of God and Satan cannot battle
[1:16:44] against that no sir
[1:16:47] he cannot battle against that see it is
[1:16:51] what we we fail to see that that word is
[1:16:53] our fortress that word is our defense
[1:16:57] that word is our life hallelujah and if
[1:17:00] you are the Lord you are to be the word
[1:17:03] hallelujah is that right Oh every time I
[1:17:11] think about it remember I think brother
[1:17:13] brother he hit on the same thing I had a
[1:17:15] thought last week about that about that
[1:17:17] woman who's who husband was a drunk and

[1:17:34] out and looked through the window to see
[1:17:35] how she was gonna react Oh Lord whoo
[1:17:40] she's a real question she was not
[1:17:42] American woman and somebody I wouldn't
[1:17:47] want to be like American women y'all
[1:17:48] would be shaming yourself you better be
[1:17:51] thankful for what you got you don't want
[1:17:53] to be an American woman you know they
[1:17:55] even got a song I wasn't listening to
[1:17:57] that channel but I heard it somewhere
[1:17:59] don't marry an American woman if she's a
[1:18:04] Christian that's a different story is
[1:18:08] that Alright
[1:18:09] and she bowed down over there and she
[1:18:11] said must Jesus bear the cross alone and
[1:18:15] all the world go free no there's a cross
[1:18:19] for everyone and there's a cross
[1:18:24] did you know that there are times in
[1:18:28] your moom and life there are moments in
[1:18:30] your life you don't feel God feel God
[1:18:32] you don't feel him you don't see him you
[1:18:36] don't know what he's doing where he's
[1:18:38] gonna go what's the next move you have
[1:18:41] no idea and you got to just stand and
[1:18:44] the Word of God says when you've done
[1:18:45] all this day stand that right Moses who
[1:18:51] had done great exploits in Egypt doesn't
[1:18:53] great everything a man broke each up to
[1:18:57] their knees can y'all hear me I'm not
[1:18:59] whining and my English is okay in it
[1:19:02] anyway
[1:19:03] you come to a place and here's Moses who
[1:19:06] done all of these exploits in the name
[1:19:09] of Jehovah the great I am and all of a
[1:19:13] sudden God leaves him in a place where
[1:19:17] he had no directions God had already
[1:19:21] told him going to the Red Sea got there
[1:19:26] God said unto Satan let Pharaoh loose
[1:19:32] hallelujah and that's where he is but
[1:19:35] this was a flood but it wasn't water it
[1:19:38] was a flood of people and they knew this
[1:19:42] flood was coming to wipe him out but who
[1:19:44] was the standard Moses was the standard
[1:19:48] those people supposed to have been the
[1:19:51] standard seeing all that God had done
[1:19:53] but they failed Moses failed and began
[1:19:56] to cry out to God but God didn't tell
[1:19:59] him what next to do water one side this
[1:20:02] on that side he didn't have no idea
[1:20:04] and God said stand still but he didn't
[1:20:11] see he he knew that if I should stand
[1:20:13] still God gonna do something say a lot
[1:20:17] of time we don't stand still long enough
[1:20:18] you know I mean we want God to do
[1:20:20] something we moving and trying to fix it
[1:20:22] know how Moses was going to fix that
[1:20:24] situation their situation God puts in
[1:20:26] your life you cannot fix you can't
[1:20:33] Oh God can God can fix it he's the only
[1:20:42] one I know that could put Humpty Dumpty
[1:20:44] together again
[1:20:46] is that true if you break an egg can God
[1:20:49] put it back Missy y'all y'all don't even
[1:20:53] know cuz we never had to ask him but God
[1:20:56] if God needed to put an egg back
[1:20:57] together he can put the egg back
[1:20:58] together if God can fix you he can fix a
[1:21:03] name is all right but there was a moment
[1:21:10] Moses did not know God's next move but
[1:21:13] by revelation right see that's what
[1:21:16] happens when you don't wing when God is
[1:21:19] getting ready to move in such a way
[1:21:20] he'll come in a way and you don't know
[1:21:22] whoa the light turns off a revelation
[1:21:25] strike you and it comes from God and now
[1:21:28] you know next what to do is that right
[1:21:33] hold your rod over there and all of a
[1:21:37] sudden God roll the waters bad if it had
[1:21:41] been a Pentecostal man he'd have been
[1:21:42] jumping glory to God hallelujah
[1:21:45] but Moses stood still he raised that
[1:21:49] word let me say it again
[1:21:51] he raised the word did you know the rod
[1:21:55] represented the world he raised the word
[1:21:58] and that's what you need to do you need
[1:22:01] to raise the word put it into a level
[1:22:04] that the word it stands higher than your
[1:22:07] battle or your flood right because even
[1:22:11] God caused that River he said it was a
[1:22:13] flood that's what it was
[1:22:17] hey many Karger to us so you said all
[1:22:21] brother what are you saying I want you
[1:22:23] understand that God has winked at our
[1:22:25] ignorance he's allowed us to go and do
[1:22:27] so many but let me say like this can't
[1:22:29] you not see in the spiritual realm what
[1:22:31] God is doing everything is being shaken
[1:22:34] and for the last few years God has been
[1:22:38] shaken what we call this message he's
[1:22:43] shaking
[1:22:44] everything y'all hear me that's why your
[1:22:49] lives are being shaken you've been
[1:22:52] shaking am I gonna stay with this
[1:22:53] message I'm I'm gonna stay with God or
[1:22:55] I'm gonna leave God have mercy on whom
[1:22:58] we will and you know what a lot of times
[1:23:00] we don't even understand what God is
[1:23:02] doing sometimes God will shake you to
[1:23:05] the place where you Baxley it or you do
[1:23:07] something you ain't got no business
[1:23:08] doing only to show you you're not where
[1:23:10] you should be and God will grant to
[1:23:14] repentance when time for repentance when
[1:23:17] you're ready for it you understand me
[1:23:19] listen Moses had to be feared not stand
[1:23:22] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:23:24] which he will show to you today for the
[1:23:27] Egyptians whom you have seen today ye
[1:23:29] shall see them again no more forever the
[1:23:33] Lord shall fight for you I can't do it
[1:23:38] but the Lord what was God doing proving
[1:23:42] himself to the people showing his acts
[1:23:44] to the people so that they could know
[1:23:46] him and sometimes that's what God does
[1:23:49] he does things but he don't want us to
[1:23:51] panic and get out of control he wants us
[1:23:54] to get up get in control of the
[1:23:57] situation have dominion over your trial
[1:24:09] notice of the mudras wherefore quiet
[1:24:11] down unto me speaking of the children of
[1:24:14] Israel that they go forward but lift
[1:24:17] down up that rod and stretch out down
[1:24:19] hand over the sea and divide it and the
[1:24:22] children Israel shall go on dry down sea
[1:24:26] we read that but we don't see the
[1:24:28] spectacular we don't see the rate the
[1:24:30] reality of what just took place we see
[1:24:36] it but we don't see it see and we don't
[1:24:39] understand how greatness is because we
[1:24:41] weren't there we read it in as I know we
[1:24:43] imagine it like Hollywood put it up
[1:24:45] there but the point is this is something
[1:24:48] that only God could have done and that's
[1:24:50] where God is with us sometimes he puts
[1:24:52] us in situation that only God can help
[1:24:55] you can do it he's the only one that can
[1:24:57] do it
[1:24:58] man can't do it you can't do it I can't
[1:25:00] do it only God can do it and God wants
[1:25:03] to do it but without faith it's
[1:25:06] impossible to please God now I'm a read
[1:25:12] this and I'm gonna be done I had to
[1:25:14] finish this evening but you know what
[1:25:16] it's it's amazing
[1:25:17] mm-hmm Jehoshaphat was uh in second
[1:25:21] chronicles you don't have to turn there
[1:25:23] but he was under a situation where Moab
[1:25:26] and some of the other tribal people were
[1:25:28] going to you know attack attack Israel
[1:25:31] and you know Joe hog the fattened you
[1:25:33] you know they were you know they were
[1:25:34] really scared because of the multitude
[1:25:40] but you know what David you know he
[1:25:43] wanted his Jeb is like land which was
[1:25:45] Jerusalem and and and and you know it's
[1:25:49] amazing how let me just read it and
[1:25:53] Judas stood before the Lord with their
[1:25:55] little ones their wives and their
[1:25:57] children and upon jahaziel the son of
[1:26:00] Zechariah and the son of benaiah the son
[1:26:02] of GL and the son of Mantinea a Levite
[1:26:05] of the son of a SAP came the Spirit of
[1:26:07] the Lord in the midst of the
[1:26:08] congregation thank God for this period
[1:26:10] of the Lord and he said hearken ye all
[1:26:13] Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:26:16] and doubt King Jehoshaphat thus said the
[1:26:19] Lord unto you be not afraid nor be
[1:26:23] dismayed by reason hmm is that word by
[1:26:26] reason of the great multitude for the
[1:26:29] battle is not yours but gods to go down
[1:26:34] against them in that right sometimes we
[1:26:37] think there is no way that this kid I
[1:26:40] don't know what I'm dealing with too
[1:26:43] many Devils say don't be this mate don't
[1:26:48] be this lady tomorrow go you down
[1:26:51] against them behold they come up the
[1:26:53] cliff of the Zeen and you should find
[1:26:55] them at the end of the brook before the
[1:26:57] wilderness of Judea real
[1:26:59] and you should not need to fight in this
[1:27:02] battle search yourself stand still and
[1:27:07] see the salvation of the Lord with you
[1:27:10] Oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be
[1:27:14] dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[1:27:17] for the Lord will be with you you don't
[1:27:20] have to fight it he's gonna fight it
[1:27:27] ministry experience you and I have the
[1:27:31] most blessed people on the face of the
[1:27:34] earth
[1:27:35] because we got him hello do you think
[1:27:42] he's stuck on that picture that's just
[1:27:47] that's just a reflection I've seen the
[1:27:51] pillar fire there were over 300 people
[1:27:56] in South Carolina seen the pillar of
[1:27:58] fire listen what brother mom says and
[1:28:01] Angel the Lord even his picture hanging
[1:28:05] here on the wall
[1:28:06] has God science stomped everywhere what
[1:28:10] does he do
[1:28:10] stay with me stay right with the word
[1:28:13] amen
[1:28:14] it cuts every devil yes it does what is
[1:28:17] it the ministering spirit sent from the
[1:28:19] presence of God to anoint the speakers
[1:28:22] of the word that stay with the word and
[1:28:25] he conforms the word with signs
[1:28:28] following
[1:28:29] but Jesus is saying yesterday today and
[1:28:32] forever there he is
[1:28:34] how could we doubt when he when he's
[1:28:38] both scientifically materially
[1:28:40] spiritually every way that can be proved
[1:28:43] he proved it here now what were you
[1:28:46] saying
[1:28:47] he has already proved himself to be with
[1:28:50] this message oh lord have mercy
[1:28:53] amen and what is the matter it's in our
[1:28:57] minds we open our minds to the thing say
[1:29:03] well now I don't know where they could
[1:29:06] be or not
[1:29:07] maybe if I feel better tomorrow oh that
[1:29:10] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:29:13] see we open our minds we to doubtful
[1:29:17] things and and and and and remember
[1:29:20] every David I've got a script you know I
[1:29:23] go through that
[1:29:24] evening but David could not have been
[1:29:27] David had not there been an angel with
[1:29:29] him
[1:29:33] think about all other wise who did
[1:29:35] greatly Daniel Shadrach Meshach and
[1:29:39] Abednego it was angel or the angel of
[1:29:44] the Lord my point is the malli angel has
[1:29:48] come down with this message we have an
[1:29:54] angel but if we don't believe it if we
[1:29:56] don't use him amen but he's come to
[1:29:59] battle for us and the Bible said he put
[1:30:02] one foot on the sea and 109 and declared
[1:30:06] that time would be no more so you and I
[1:30:08] must understand we have come to as a
[1:30:12] manifested sons and daughters of God to
[1:30:16] prove that we are and that angel is here
[1:30:20] to vindicate the ministry that's what
[1:30:22] he's here for
[1:30:24] but God is creating himself we look at
[1:30:28] the statue of a perfect man and we fail
[1:30:30] to see that every one of those virtues
[1:30:32] are being tested right now every one of
[1:30:36] them and we're gonna either set in our
[1:30:39] minds we gonna conquer the land or we'll
[1:30:42] do like the bad spies we can't do it I
[1:30:46] can't live it that's what a lot of
[1:30:48] people when they left this message say
[1:30:50] it's too stiff it's too straight
[1:30:52] hallelujah I can't live it hallelujah no
[1:30:56] I can't live it you can't live it but if
[1:31:00] you get the Holy Ghost he will live it
[1:31:02] it is Christ in you the hope of glory it
[1:31:06] ain't about you eating about your
[1:31:08] strength and what you think you can do
[1:31:10] is God in yo who's living his life
[1:31:14] through you greater is he not me greater
[1:31:17] is He that's in me in you than he that
[1:31:21] is in the world but if you don't pray
[1:31:24] you won't stay you got to get before
[1:31:27] your knees and contact this Living God
[1:31:30] because he's here and he's waiting and
[1:31:32] won't to be contacted he's
[1:31:36] creating an army and the devil is doing
[1:31:37] everything he can and like like somebody
[1:31:39] said well you know I don't like saying
[1:31:41] he's a good adversary but he is kind of
[1:31:44] not so smart but he is he don't
[1:31:48] understand everything he does toward us
[1:31:50] really make us grow every little thing
[1:31:54] he try to bring us down just make us
[1:31:57] flourish he calls us that dead power to
[1:32:01] come we resurrection we're the
[1:32:02] resurrection
[1:32:03] we are the resurrection we cannot die we
[1:32:09] are the resurrection we're the
[1:32:13] resurrection of the of the church that
[1:32:16] failed after the day of Pentecost we are
[1:32:19] the resurrection and the only way that
[1:32:21] can be proven is that we must live the
[1:32:23] very life they lived with all of the
[1:32:27] signs and wonders following God is
[1:32:30] creating in you but first of all you got
[1:32:37] to have this mind you got to be willing
[1:32:40] to get rid of your own line how do you
[1:32:46] get rid of it the only thing I know is
[1:32:49] you got to give it to him he's not gonna
[1:32:51] take it unless you give it to him
[1:32:55] somewhere in your life you got to humble
[1:32:57] yourself and say god help me
[1:32:58] that's one of the things that I liked
[1:33:00] about meeting down there in South
[1:33:02] Carolina the brother said when you don't
[1:33:04] know what else to say you just say help
[1:33:10] with all your words your prayers and
[1:33:13] everything is you don't know what else
[1:33:14] to say to God all you could do is just
[1:33:16] get on your knees and say help me help
[1:33:18] me Lord help me help me help me and God
[1:33:21] knows every word in-between help you
[1:33:27] love the Lord can I get everybody right
[1:33:30] here to say help me that's it again help
[1:33:34] me

[1:33:37] it help me Lord you that felt good
[1:33:42] didn't it let's say it again help me
[1:33:44] Lord
[1:33:45] see if you really say that and you
[1:33:49] really mean it
[1:33:50] you can stop the Sun because that's what
[1:33:54] blind bartimaeus did right he screamed
[1:33:57] and holiday it doesn't matter how many
[1:33:59] of us are crying help
[1:34:00] but he sees the sincere heart and when
[1:34:03] you really said see and you need to help
[1:34:05] he will come on the scene for let's
[1:34:08] stand yes yes yes and you and I must
[1:34:19] realize that he is a present help in a
[1:34:22] time of need you and I must need also
[1:34:25] know that you're not alone even though
[1:34:30] the devil make you feel that way let's
[1:34:32] say with the word he said I'll never
[1:34:34] leave you nor will I forsake you and
[1:34:36] that's what you need to preach back to
[1:34:38] the devil sisters if you ever wanted to
[1:34:42] preach preach back to the devil
[1:34:44] brothers preach back to the devil that's
[1:34:46] one thing you can do preach take that
[1:34:48] word of God and give it back to the
[1:34:50] devil a lot of things that we need to do
[1:34:52] as I said you know we must understand by
[1:34:57] God's grace that every day is a new day
[1:35:00] you can't go up offer you yesterday
[1:35:02] righteousness you may have been really
[1:35:05] strong and powerful yesterday but you
[1:35:07] don't that doesn't care don't carry on
[1:35:09] over give us this day our daily bread
[1:35:12] you must pray and ask God to cleanse you
[1:35:14] and wash you every day right throughout
[1:35:18] the day if you don't you'll find
[1:35:23] yourself sinking you love the Lord
[1:35:30] I love him ah
[1:35:38] because he first loved me and 400 trees
[1:36:41] tree I throw this at you
[1:36:47] when David won Jerusalem all
[1:37:00] the blind and the lame was destroyed all
[1:37:10] of the blind in the lane was destroyed
[1:37:16] and that's what God is doing right now
[1:37:19] in the spirit that's what he's doing
[1:37:23] those who don't repent and ask for sight
[1:37:25] and those who don't repent and ask for
[1:37:27] healing there's a spirit that will
[1:37:31] destroy you because no no
[1:37:34] nothing that would have filed a city
[1:37:36] wait enter father God we come before you
[1:37:43] lord as homeless we know how we thank
[1:37:47] you for your grace and your mercy we
[1:37:50] thank you for being so good to us you
[1:37:54] are battle-ax surely Lord when the news
[1:38:00] came to JoVE about all of his losses
[1:38:05] even when it came to losing all of his
[1:38:09] children it was a tough situation but
[1:38:15] Jobe kept its integrity when father even
[1:38:20] when his wife began to speak for the
[1:38:22] devil and he looked at her as his woman
[1:38:27] you don't sound like my wife kind of
[1:38:30] remind me of what you said to Peter
[1:38:32] Satan get behind me because a man Jobe
[1:38:37] knew his wife and he knew that his wife
[1:38:40] was being influenced by a bad spirit
[1:38:44] Lord we need you this morning give us
[1:38:50] wisdom Lord and insight to know the
[1:38:53] difference between the voice of Christ
[1:38:55] and the voice of the Antichrist help us
[1:38:59] now Lord Jesus that will not surrender
[1:39:01] Lord to the system of what this message
[1:39:05] had become but will stay with the Holy
[1:39:09] Spirit that pillar fire
[1:39:13] when all of Israel had turned their
[1:39:16] backs on the Prophet and the things that
[1:39:19] had heard of the Prophet they let
[1:39:22] pressure systems and things get next to
[1:39:24] them to where in that they bowed but may
[1:39:27] this little group of people never bow to
[1:39:30] an image anything that would be an
[1:39:34] abomination to you Lord may we press
[1:39:39] forward that we don't become worship of
[1:39:43] our sales or worshippers of our children
[1:39:45] you know that we we won't get into a
[1:39:48] place where you know we feel like we're
[1:39:50] so free and that's what Satan does he he
[1:39:53] offer freedom to the believer in reality
[1:39:57] it becomes bondage helpless now that
[1:40:00] we'll see how slick he is and how he
[1:40:03] maneuvers lured us and those of us who
[1:40:06] are in heavy battle give us the faith
[1:40:10] Lord to stare give us a revelation that
[1:40:14] will be that standard Lord that we won't
[1:40:17] bend bow break we won't compromise laws
[1:40:20] if it means that we got to go along
[1:40:23] we'll go along but lord give us that
[1:40:27] revelation to stand in this wicked hour
