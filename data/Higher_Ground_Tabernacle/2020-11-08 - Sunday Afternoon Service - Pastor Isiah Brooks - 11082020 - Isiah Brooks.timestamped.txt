[18:05] he he has made me glad hallelujah
[18:08] nothing in this world can make me as
[18:10] glad as he can
[18:12] i'm so happy tonight to be here we'll
[18:15] get right on
[18:16] into the word of god what a blessed
[18:20] what a blessedness you know i was just
[18:24] thinking
[18:25] about that quote
[18:30] justified and i was just thinking about
[18:36] something i had never thought about i
[18:39] guess i heard another preacher said
[18:41] it just really stuck with me
[18:45] you know my inheritance have changed
[18:50] from the book of life to the lamb's book
[18:52] of life
[18:55] i didn't hear him say it that way but
[18:57] that's the way i thought
[18:59] and in the lamb's book of life you're
[19:01] justified
[19:02] as though you never sinned in the first
[19:04] place
[19:06] you know and you know it's like brother
[19:08] branham said uh
[19:10] you know i'm a christian and i can do
[19:12] what i want to do
[19:14] but you see the things that i love the
[19:16] world i don't want to do
[19:18] and if you're a christian and you feel
[19:20] like you can do whatever you want to do
[19:21] and then you do the things that you
[19:22] shouldn't be doing then
[19:24] something's wrong with your experience
[19:26] as we stand and i this is the kind of
[19:28] thing that i'm trying to get people to
[19:30] see
[19:30] not me i can't give you revelation i
[19:32] can't give you understanding
[19:34] but one thing for certain the bible said
[19:36] we ought not to be ignorant we ought to
[19:38] be ignorant of the times and the seasons
[19:39] that we're living in
[19:41] let us not close our eyes to the things
[19:43] that's happening and by the grace of god
[19:45] supposing it does delay a few years but
[19:47] at the same time you have made yourself
[19:50] ready
[19:51] remember when brother branham talks
[19:52] about this young girl she was already
[19:54] standing in the door
[19:56] waiting on jesus to come and that's the
[19:59] way i want to be i want to be standing
[20:01] in the door waiting for his coming you
[20:04] understand me we know he's come but
[20:06] there's another something happening that
[20:07] a lot of people
[20:08] don't see and the bride has made herself
[20:11] ready
[20:12] and so we must understand that when god
[20:14] came and he opened up the seals and
[20:16] everything else that was his first
[20:18] that was his coming but you see we
[20:20] didn't know that it would be done
[20:21] in almost like two parts but that's
[20:23] exactly what's happening
[20:26] you could call it it's appearing how we
[20:28] want to say it either way and
[20:30] we know that he's been here we know that
[20:32] god's grace through the prophet of god
[20:34] that was his appearing
[20:35] jesus christ showing himself the same
[20:37] yesterday today and forever
[20:39] and by the grace of god we understand
[20:41] that when he came again
[20:43] amen he came at a time when nobody
[20:44] suspected him to come
[20:46] even the prophet of god didn't even know
[20:48] he was coming but by the grace of god he
[20:50] did
[20:51] now he's among us changing our hearts
[20:55] changing our minds amen and and and
[20:58] literally
[20:59] transforming us into his kingdom
[21:02] i thank god for his grace as we stand
[21:05] let us turn to revelations the second
[21:07] chapter
[21:10] we come from revelations i was going to
[21:14] minister this i thought to minister this
[21:16] this morning but i just felt led to go
[21:17] the opposite way the other way
[21:19] and god has been good to us people of
[21:22] god there are so many people who are
[21:24] in this world right now and they have no
[21:26] idea what's going on
[21:28] yet we know because the bible said it
[21:30] will not take us as a thief in the night
[21:32] and this is the part that i love about
[21:34] it because he said because
[21:36] of god sent us a prophet that's the only
[21:38] reason now
[21:40] the reason why the denominational church
[21:43] is not in the light because they
[21:44] rejected the message for their day
[21:46] they rejected malachi 4. had they taken
[21:49] a hold of him
[21:50] they would be in much as much light as
[21:52] we are
[21:53] but it was already four days
