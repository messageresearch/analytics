that we might have a place Lord to come unto you Lord for this reason that we gathered at our homes that here the at the the church Lord wherever we are Lord we gathered here in this place Lord for

believe we'll see him tonight let's sing him in we've gotten the power in the name of Jesus amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the name of the Lord hallelujah God is good to us tonight I trusted by God's grace you are excited about the season no the people get excited about Christmas I'm excited about the resurrection we just celebrated last weekend Easter when I believe he stirs us something that should be within you every day because as we know by God's grace we do by by way of life we are shadows and types of the resurrection by dying at night we go to sleep and by waking up in the morning it's a resurrection and you and I know by God's raised in water these old days and I'm looking forward to the coming of the Lord where we will never have to return to such a mess Saders Eden he's really made a mess of this world and you know we won't have to worry about any pestilence any type of violence or sicknesses the one thing I love about this is that when God chose us he was not rolling dice he wasn't taking a chance and when he came to redeem us he did send some secondhand secretary or vice president or whatever attorney general he came himself and I thank God for the mercies and the grace of God I'm so happy to see that everybody is so happy tonight look at these great smiles on everybody I'm blessed I don't know about you but I'm blessed and in the midst of all the trials in the midst of all the tests amen I'm blessed that's the way I look at it I believe that if said Lazarus would would tell you how he felt there laying at the rich man's table no clothes bakes knowing his back yeah fighting over the food that drops off to the master's table but I don't believe he was a sad creature you see because when you got God on the inside there's a joy unspeakable there's something that goes on within you that you yourself cannot even explain it's a joy unspeakable and full of glory amen I'm trying to find a song anybody got a song amen oh when the saints go marching in or wind us a [Music] the [Music] he promised me he promised you and that's what we're standing on the promises of God you know one thing I know about the Lord the Lord love praise and I realized that praise praising the Lord would get you far more further worship and praise is where God indwells he inhabits the praise of his people and when you can praise God in the midst of all things you know I think about that woman and I'm not gonna preach check out a brother here it's gonna preach for us tonight but I always liken myself as that woman at Simon's house she didn't know what to say all she could do was crazy and once you begin to just worship Him the Lord responded every man every woman boy and girl about says let every breath that have praise the Lord let everything that have breath praise the Lord I trusted everybody has come here tonight in the right spirit because the Holy Ghost is censored and I wouldn't want to be the one to grieve him the Holy Ghost is sensitive to tonight tonight and and I know one thing for certain that when we come and we come in worship and in prayer God will answer your prayer he's just that way there's no way you're gonna pull on God and he's gonna push you away when you pull on God he responds to that pool he doesn't even care how how far you are away from him we have our brother Isaac of today tonight that's going to minister I appreciate our young brother I think him for the sacrifice that he's made to come and we just we're gonna pull on the gift tonight and I don't know about you I know there's some of us who are in the audience that and of course it's just a few of us but the Bible said where two or three are gathered in his name is that right brother Branham said it like this when they said to him and I just listened to the tape the other day today you know how people don't want to say Amen they don't want to make a lot of noise still friend starchiness is not of God but the man said how can you stand when they're making all that noise he said in response to them I really wouldn't know how to act if they didn't make the noise right because in heaven there's a lot of noise I believe in noise this is probably the most quiet place there is in hell they're screaming and hollering and in heavenly rejoicing in Holland I don't know about you but I am I'm rejoicing in Holland right now come brother we appreciate him once again and like I said I didn't mean to talk so much but I believe and I know I've seen God in such a mighty way in these last few weeks and months this core of our rock virus got everybody scared and nervous all this kind of stuff but Bobby tells me when you see this day and protein look up this is a time when we should be joyous you don't you can make it happen if you won't do but anyway brother come god bless your church it's it's good to be in the house of the Lord when people are afraid of the virus John builders when people don't know

that when God care merciful so vocalist could drive if you know he gave them the true other than the true garment you not do need love it up the harbor and we see also the of imitates cause the thing

know I was now forcing myself to fit into that picture issue for SEMA men the you know I was saying for I give for example I give an example a paroxysm you know we see brother Brooks how he likes to sing and books on you know what I was doing is that I look at him and I know that he has the Holy Spirit it's crucial physical location you know I'll say that you know if you have the Holy Spirit you have to be like him you shout and sing like him it was a village on Tiki and do all the gestures you know like if you're just community so what I was doing I was sure I was copying its crew chief physician see the cookie you know what air everything you know I would try not to copy everything is doing she seem I love the cookie to see you know to try to fit myself to make people believe that I'm also I am also filled with the word space we see the meal is your aqua but truly inside of me and more until you know I knew that you know something you know I was empty just a victory defeat you know it's like the Prophet when when you read the story of the stature of the perform and the prophets saying the calmly prophet Oscar food is it on as the children on path you know one is talking about virtue let's keep our develop it says that God had the virtue inside of you giv in virtually that's why when they were when that woman touch them for applicants cause it's fun love it you know that virtue you know had to came out of him sit virtue to be so silly but if you don't have the virtue inside of you looks even reproduce virtue and you're trying to imitate him you know somebody can touch you nothing we came out of you sorry it's like I have the Iver I have a baking a baby bank account to come watch G come punky or you know that has mine inside G de Letran and you try to fake also you that you have your bank account if the co see the purity you know when you go to run a check or you want to cash our money it looks a little you know if you have mine inside of you you will have more but if you don't have money it'll it will decline they pass on celebrity you know that's the same thing with the Holy Spirit she's like listen you know that's the same thing with God sound shows affect you if you don't have him inside of you so they about you anything you know that's enough you know you just acting cool that's why the Bible why we read in our first Corinthians it screams of all you know the Bible is saying that if I don't have charity liability decision they punish you know I can't do everything that the Bible says she prefer to school up you know I can have all the gift she prefer to lead on you know I can look holy she prepare it was you know I can walk holy she pretty much but if I don't have it inside of me is usually Palantir you know it's nothing see you know it's just I'm just acting Julie say could you know if we go to Genesis 25 or similar on janeshia petrovin sank you know we'll see the story of Isaac and and his family so Nora stop disaster for me we'll see how Jacob also in terrassa for Commercial Code when he tried to imitate his brother lost legitimate discipline you know he tried to fake you know showing his dad that he was in so they see the mantras on fertility is a you and he was blessed our little beanie but that blessing didn't do anything you know didn't help him at that time miscibility sooner yourself to do it because it didn't present himself you know he didn't show it any shorter it's dad we really really was good Department recently period more we read Genesis 25 new region isn't saying first when you want to prevent the user score 20 C or I can't jump that is talking about the birth the weekend jumped out 27:44 yearly Oh No chapter 27 will read verse of 15 to 20 to capital van said yeah chapter 27 they'll say verse 15 to 20 you know here is talking how everybody the Bible says and Rebekah took godly raiment of her eldest son is so which were with her in the house and put them upon Jacob her younger son ability on suitabie Capri live at Monday's I used some fishing nearly prevail Amazon Elif he met Roger cops on Fisk a day and we can jump to our verse 18 the Bible said and he came unto his unto his father and say my father and he said here Here I am now here am i and then he asked him who are there my son and even parademon pair exactly what she teaches and Jacob answer and Jacob said I say unto his father am I so that firstborn recouped upon justice is a so now we let let's have this verse in our mind you know he went to his father he insisted version is pretty little ever simple question was after we opposed in history who are you te true but now in this play here he didn't tell it didn't say who it was he seasoned about utility he said I was in so what it was Jacob that utility is a real oddity Jocko the Bible day they were verse 27 and Isaac said unto Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou has found a thou has found it so quickly my son and he said because the LORD thy God brought it to me exact DF is equal Jonah digitally Memphis is a couple upon we see little net on July 15 of the homo verse 22 you guys even do and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is Jacobs the voices Jacob voice but the hands are the hands of Esau Jacob's a Posadas action pair killer Tasha Edie la voie ill-afford Oh Jacob may limits only man desire Wow why because if we read earlier we will see that you know if you read before you know the entire chapter you see that Jacob had took the code of his brothers new design put blue on the wakisaka baby Prix du monde mm so if fake is identity I have a peer at this only don't so he took the identity of his brother Eli people donated some and she presented himself to his father please auntie Devon some pair for a blessing he was asked you know his father asked him who are you and he said was in so he some paranoid Monty kichu the DDT is so and then if you read after that you'll see that he was blessed disability but you see that though Jacob was blessed with a liver Mexico BT Billy I didn't to stop troubles from coming to him cylinder to be part he didn't know he had the blessing of his father no because in back in that time you see that the blessing of the Father was the most was something very important Oscar Austin is incentive the lead work will have been you know it was really important for a son to be blessed by a death City Ramona sister confess what Billy possum but though he had you know yet received nothing important but that didn't do anything to him energy Davi who sued us it shows important salafi you know if he probably he probably saw them to himself that you know after being blessed and my life will change it worked probably MonaVie possibly are present beneath my you know I will not have any trouble generally pretty to buy that didn't you know that wasn't what he was expecting a city positive certainty but if we turn to our Genesis 30 32 Isuzu doors in desert Thunder we are diverse 24/7 cattle to 28 discover and treat the Bible say and Jacob was left alone and their rest of the men with him until the breaking of the day nobility shock of them will I sell alone an omelette avec new school evade Aloha and one is so that he prevailed now against him he touched the the hollow of his tie and the hollow of Jacob's died was out of was out of joint and he rested with him when he knew people Evancho saddam live kappa alone boy children are in on watch other cops udemy bond agility and he said let me go for the day break it and he said I will not let the go except thou bless that I'll bless me if the less Malik on the wall so left is a couple upon thee gentle asleep oily kitchen maybe me and he said Antony in anything on to him what is thy name Alito no so we see that that's the same question sort of a column lament Castillo is also is again you know bid it was asked again the same question he posed ill mmm kissed you know the first time was when his dad asked him what was what what is your name la première for still owes could some family of a like you said he was a so now here's the second time asking launched acoustic is show Sukhois to know and the Bible say and II said Jacob the ability to punish a cop and he said the name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for for as a prince has their power with God and with me and has prevailed on oniy sariputra cop Methuselah plea Israel cultural ETA with Jew effect ISM iterative anchor you know there the first time what we read will see that it was a blessing also Lapointe follows cause of Allah city will be it was asked Jacob I was like what is your name duty like Chile to know if fakers identity they said that you know I was am in so repetitive intensity productivity is a and the second time he also wanted a blessing Allah to savour life you see presentable so now he noticed that the first time when effect is the identity he like whom articular follows it didn't stop trouble from coming to him it's not about utility blue he had his brother he had his brother coming to it to kill him Leviton some crack Tiffany Pollard you know he had all kinds of troubles around so now he has now another chance he knows you know now he's facing death he fast Alamo his brother now he's coming to him so heavily and it get again this other opportunity

becoming now more real till fits all sort of the level to the familiar and if we go back to the New Testament system I will see that a story of a man is only distort the norm it's found in Acts chapter 16 he lasted all the actors say sir we read the verse 27 to 31 in linear diverse events it just could continue i sat 16 verse 27 to 31 ACTA Caesar of 72 skirt on T the Bible says that and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out the sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners have been fed usually Olivia Olivia popular resolved that it not only be a lesson clearly present in city but poor cry cried with a loud voice saying dude that self norm for we are all here Mayport liadrin her fault the defeat point demands no some to CC then he called for a light and and springing and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas a lowly julian demanded the lumia on Capri sippy Tom oh is it a two-tone blow peephole it is less and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved utilities in your passport Sophie and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ police less depands your quality and thou shalt be saved and the house it was a loss of it was you know we see the story of this man on the world list what do you see Tom you know when I compare it to myself or you know people know special compound effect women you know when I feel compared to myself that was before before I received the Holy Spirit because I'm now I'm a new different I'm different now we see that this man this a good this keeper of the prison Nouveau kusa Julie you know he had Paul and Silas Alavi ball is sadasiva in the prison prison you know if you read the story you see that Paul and Silas were accused falsely you know simplicity saw Slovakia police audacity iqz for small and you know because uh I walk you through the story really quick is your family to destroy it Paul actually wanted to go to we wanted to go preach in Macedonia to as you I believe I know to be a leap Christian but God told him not to go preach in Asia but to go to Macedonia up Judea to DiPaola christianism it I know my city and what they were going they were received by a woman who you know welcomed them and give them food a la pelota veggies is a dealership and funky la vie and I believe in the way back is you quick to know you know another lady was behind them you know the family billion she was crying out loud that this man these two men are sent from God yeah clearly 0cp some sort of way about you you know they will show you the way of righteousness if not alone of what does you see I will show you the true way you know the way to God if what Oliver Polly felt you you know just to stop their maratona you know you see that this man this woman when we look at her we myself I can't find anything back with her La Scala got it from doom I mentioned building in front the man you know she was doing a great job you know it has been Paul and Silas to get more crowd so that they may bring the word F example caballo creo put the pole is less a you know Godzilla people knew her cause people were coming to her to tell and you know so that she may tell them the about their future about the thing they were going on a scale is oculus is it from Miss Olivia said from Polk so they knew that she was telling the truth a little savvy killed and by doing so Paul we have an easier you know work to do you know efficiency lap all the emphasis you know he won't have to go everywhere to cry to cry and to preach so that people may gather together together originally Pollak three sheep Oh Jean but the woman was doing the work for Mesa from physicists all right but now here's something Paul didn't see the work that the woman was doing was not effective is either but he saw the Spirit behind her may 11 a fat pork on the spirit behind her a polite sister stood out yes it is you know that's why I'm you know sometimes that you you win can we can have people around you know surrounding us what I prefer different Volvo to do you know telling you you know about things Paulo de Souza you know telling you that you you know you're doing a good job or whatevs autofit on both cough I know even coming to you and telling you what the Bible is saying you know just good you know but now we have to see the spirit behind the first man River Valley's pretty relatives you know poor dinner you know poor didn't need the glory for the bipartisan to grow you know by he wanted somebody if that woman was going to help her you know was with the good spirit [Music] you know that's what we have to be very careful about the spirit behind things we sometimes we do listen to songs we have to be careful about the spirit behind the song before news though this audition song Devon fair attention we watch videos we have to be careful about the spirit behind the video a new elusive only for the film at all you know you can see something looks holy river Texas keeper is something look scriptural Texas keeper is about the spirit behind that is bad Melissa pretty really like a force and we have to be careful about the affero Toshio and so we see that when podcast the spirit out of oculostaple ashes it is your master now was angry because that that woman was a business to him so method if a ship escaped from it even a theory and it kills Paul and Silas he like we suppose and they were beaten easy to copy and they put them in prison always a pleasure so now if I if we know if we protect the place of Paul and Silas it's an economic boon opposed to pull here they could have gone to God and say Lord you prevent leave out you put your senior I wanted to go preach to Asia she would really appreciate that swear I wanted to go that's where I'm you know I was going CC usually but look you will me here I'll catch my me easy and look look where I am now I didn't eat you know I was but I'm in prison now you show me I didn't even preach Judy Papa she and now you know I'm suffering I have all you know all those people mocking at me Amin oh to seem optimal and but you know Paul instead of doing that Apollo Ursula in starting out to praise the Lord it occupies a Louie listen you're witnessing Iacobucci at-the-money preaching in appreciate singing so train and this man that the prison the keeper of the prison is seized Julie easy you know certainly it was seeing what Paul was doing something more physical you know he's so that part through you know his trial alive people Tonto see suppose you know he was keeping praising God Louie listen yeah you know you know he was watching Paul's life he you know that's why you know sometimes when we leave when we leave you know where we with some work what I call the follows you know you know we might no matter what we're going through you know we have to keep praising God because we don't know who is watching us to listen patty new survey you know we might be an answer through our prayer through our trials we might be an answer for somebody else don't know the proven proven echo in the pond supported and we see now I hear at the prison is in the prison of reason you know an earthquake happened it happened uncomfortable detail it and Paul and Silas were loose a Paul is selectively be a you know they could have gone because they were free but they stay there may his honesty this man after the earthquake is atomically he didn't see Paul and Silas in a policy and you know he could have said to himself that you know now and the King won't accept me or the king will kill me because it will never believe that an earthquake happened appreciative Cole made no apology doesn't free Lou of imposter Park yeah you know I will be I would take their place because you know I would take the place Julian plastering because it will never believe that you know he will think that I'm the one who let them go first girl you walk one hey Kersey Mikey let me also go and try to copy what Paul and Silas were doing so let's want a copy of screw people you know you could have thought about that if people see us because it's so is pen cap on with Paul and Silas he saw how they were praising God with you he saw their prayer time left you know probably he was praying at 9:00 you know what every guy nepata call he could have gone and cop he starting out to manufacture while Paul and Silas were doing it really could be aloof a loofah suppose he could have gone to create his own religion valium you know based on what Paul and Silas were doing but this rule school policy that's physics but he understood that that wasn't going to help me not completely should indeed you know he understood that manufacturing something if I don't have it doesn't help he like completely cushy NEPA but he wanted to know the source of it Lucas that's why when is so Paul and Silas Gaddafi policy then he asked them sirs what must I do to be saved the opposite sir is

that's the same kind of faith that we have we need to have in Jesus if you lament for to devolve washes you know because he said he said the thing and he has to do it as long as you believe because the Bible said that he that started the work is faithful enough to finish it come on certify and you just have faith it should a koala for you know you know but that's what we're saying that imitating doesn't help us you know imitating doesn't help us to be more holy in matenda lose it bad for some you know we need to have the real one we need to have the real baptism of the holy spirit of all you
