[10:10] amen our sister Ruby amen wants to amen
[10:14] testify praise
[10:17] God as good as
[10:19] kids give an honor to our Lord and
[10:21] Savior Jesus Christ I just appreciate um
[10:24] the Lord on Monday morning um we was at
[10:27] home and um um all of a sudden was
[10:30] getting ready and everything brother
[10:31] Brooks had just left so I was getting up
[10:34] and getting ready and doing little house
[10:36] things and stuff and all of a sudden our
[10:38] alarm came on our smoke alarm that I
[10:41] thought and then I'm looking around I'm
[10:42] like oh Lord where's the smoke coming
[10:44] from and there was no smoke and then all
[10:46] of a sudden I heard carbon monoxide
[10:49] alert car and it kept repeating and
[10:51] repeating and I'm saying oh Lord because
[10:53] I know that's a odorus and it's a
[10:56] dangerous thing and it can kill you
[10:57] anytime instant killer so I ran and did
[11:00] some things put some clothes on and then
[11:02] ran downstairs opened the garage and I
[11:05] called the fire department they came in
[11:08] and they said it I don't know the
[11:09] numbers but they said it was a 15 and so
[11:12] they opened up the windows and told me
[11:14] you know they were believe in it it was
[11:16] coming from the furnace so the furnace
[11:18] was in the garage so anyway uh we had
[11:21] called uh they came and they did what
[11:23] they did and then just told us if if it
[11:25] comes back on to uh call them again but
[11:28] we called the Fest man and he found out
[11:30] and he said yes that's where it was so
[11:33] was a piece that had gone bad and then
[11:35] it was just put on my heart Saints for
[11:38] me to call Brother
[11:48] Sam it just shook me up because at first
[11:50] of all I thought it was smoke alarm and
[11:52] it wasn't and then when I found out what
[11:54] it was and it kind of alert it like
[11:56] alarmed me so and um I'm just saying
[11:59] because the Lord just really blessed us
[12:01] because we just got new smoke alarms I
[12:03] would say around the summer of last year
[12:06] which has the carbon monoxide alert on
[12:09] it all of them do not have it on there
[12:12] so I just advise you or ask you guys to
[12:15] check your your uh smoke detectors and
[12:18] see if it's on there because it's silent
[12:21] and you don't even know it's in there it
[12:22] can kill you instant and I just praise
[12:24] the Lord that we wasn't sleeping or
[12:26] anything that we were up and we heard
[12:28] the alarm arm and I just praise God for
[12:30] his mercy and his grace thank the Lord

[37:30] and open our Bibles in the book of
[37:37] Exodus we read chapter 23 verse 20 to
[37:41] verse
[37:49] 22 Exodus
[37:51] 23 20 to
[37:55] 22
[37:57] amen the Bible says
[37:58] that you
[38:02] ready Exodus 23 20-
[38:18] 22 the Bible said behold I sent an angel
[38:22] before thee to keep thee in in the way
[38:26] and to bring thee into the place which I
[38:29] have
[38:36] prepared beware of him and obey his
[38:39] voice provoke him not for he will not
[38:42] pardon for your transgressions for my
[38:45] name is in
[38:52] him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his
[38:56] voice and do all that I speak then I
[38:58] will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[39:02] adversary unto thy
[39:11] adversar amen let's go to Joshua chapter
[39:14] 5 we read verse 13-
[39:20] 15 13 to
[39:25] 15 amen and here it's where I uh I took
[39:29] my title
[39:31] fromen the Bible here says that and he
[39:33] came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho
[39:37] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[39:40] and behold there stood there stood a man
[39:44] over against him with his sword drawn in
[39:48] his hand and Joshua went unto him and
[39:51] said unto him are thou for us or for our
[39:55] adversaries
[40:08] amen and the verse 14 the Bible says
[40:11] that and he said nay but as the captain
[40:15] of the host of the Lord am I now come
[40:19] and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth
[40:22] and did worship and said unto him what
[40:25] sayith my Lord unto his
[40:38] servant verse 15 the Bible says and the
[40:41] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[40:44] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy food
[40:48] for the place whereon thou standest is
[40:52] Holy and Joshua did
[40:55] so
[41:02] amen let's bow our heads father God lord
[41:05] we come to you tonight
[41:07] father Lord as humbly as we know how
[41:10] father Lord we just want to thank you
[41:13] Lord
[41:14] for Lord thank you for the weekend that
[41:17] we
[41:18] had Lord we thank you for everything
[41:20] that you have done for us
[41:22] Lord Lord we just pray father God that
[41:25] that same spirit continue to be with
[41:28] us we pray father Lord that you speak to
[41:31] us this evening
[41:33] father Lord I pray that you take me out
[41:35] of the way father Lord and you speak to
[41:38] your people father and help me oh God to
[41:40] be so sensitive to the
[41:43] holy that I can only say what you want
[41:45] me
[41:46] to Lord I pray father God that you bless
[41:49] the heart that we hear your
[41:52] word and let everything be done in your
[41:54] name Jes to you be the glory and honor
[41:58] Jesus Christ name we
[42:00] pray you may be seated amen this evening
[42:04] we have a little subject that we wanted
[42:05] to share with
[42:08] you that we entitled it the captain of
[42:11] the
[42:15] host amen the captain of the host of the
[42:18] Lord here in Exodus 23 the Bible says in
[42:22] verse 20 that behold I sent an angel
[42:24] before the see
[42:29] amen and that angel will have to that
[42:31] angel will keep you in the
[42:35] way and bring you to a place that the
[42:38] Lord has prepared for
[42:41] you and and then and then if you read
[42:44] the verse 22 the Bible says that but if
[42:46] Thou shalt indeed obey his
[42:50] voice and do all that he
[42:54] speak then I the Lord will be an enemy
[42:57] unto
[43:00] en and the an adversary unto
[43:04] th amen so Joshua knew that word that
[43:07] Moses that God spoke to
[43:11] Moses amen he kept it in his
[43:14] heart amen every day every time he was
[43:17] walking amen every battles that he was
[43:20] fighting amen he always had that that
[43:23] that that word with him as long as I
[43:27] keep the word of
[43:28] God as long as I'm standing in the word
[43:31] of
[43:32] God angel of the Lord will always go
[43:35] before
[43:36] me and he will be the enemy of my
[43:39] enemies he will be the adversary of
[43:42] my so now here when he comes to Joshua
[43:46] chapter
[43:47] 5 the Bible says that Joshua saw a man
[43:50] who had his sword
[43:54] drawn Joshua himself being a
[43:57] warrior and then you coming you know to
[44:00] their I mean where they were and then
[44:02] you have your
[44:04] son in other words it's like a
[44:06] declaration of
[44:09] war I believe that Joshua did not go to
[44:12] that man with his SW kept
[44:16] behind when he went he also had his
[44:20] drawn because he knew that God will be
[44:23] the enemies of his enemies amen and he
[44:26] will be the adversaries of
[44:29] his so that's why he asked that man he
[44:33] asked him that are you for
[44:36] us because your faith will decide your
[44:38] faith will be decided on your
[44:43] end that's good for you but if you are
[44:46] against us amen I'm sorry I know that
[44:50] you will be
[44:51] defeated it doesn't matter how big you
[44:54] are will be defeated amen because God
[44:58] gave us a
[44:59] promise that his angel will go before
[45:03] us will fight our
[45:06] bottles he did the same thing with
[45:09] Pharaoh he delivered us he Departed the
[45:12] Red
[45:14] Sea all the Pharaoh's Army fell into the
[45:20] river because God was there before them
[45:24] and fighting all the promises
[45:27] that's what this is the thing that the
[45:29] the uh uh uh the other 10 spies fail to
[45:36] see when Moses asked them to go spy on
[45:39] the
[45:41] land amen Moses did not really ask them
[45:44] to go see you know how the odds were
[45:52] against am because the odds even though
[45:54] the odds were against him Moses knew
[45:56] that they will be
[46:00] victorious so the report of them being
[46:03] being like grasshoppers this is that
[46:05] that wasn't real that wasn't what Moses
[46:07] was
[46:12] expecting wasn't what Moses sent them to
[46:16] go mes sent them to go see if that
[46:20] promise that God
[46:24] gave if there be milk and honey
[46:28] flowing to tell them of the good of the
[46:33] land because they knew Moses knew that
[46:36] they will have that
[46:39] Landen but when they came back amen they
[46:42] saw all those big mens
[46:45] and amen they were all scared and Afraid
[46:49] amen they forgot that the angel of the
[46:51] Lord was
[46:54] always amen here here the prophet says
[46:57] it says that now listen closely
[46:59] now when the word test
[47:03] came when the word when the word test
[47:09] came when they went over and seen the
[47:12] opposition so
[47:15] great the greatest opposition they ever
[47:20] seen amen the the uh uh Amal
[47:26] was 10 times their
[47:29] size they said we look like
[47:33] grasshoppers their fences or their
[47:35] seties are wall till they can't uh uh
[47:38] they can't run a chariot around uh a
[47:41] chariot race around
[47:47] it man he says that two
[47:51] chariots man as hard as they can
[47:54] go
[47:57] as hard as they can go around the
[48:02] wall amen it says that he asked we say
[48:07] why their Spears are way
[48:14] out they're
[48:17] long and they're
[48:19] Giants we look like grass
[48:22] opers we can't do it amen and two men
[48:27] stood on that
[48:30] word and
[48:31] Joshua said wait a
[48:33] minute you two million people shut up
[48:36] just a
[48:39] minute we are more than we are more than
[48:42] able to do
[48:44] it see we are more than we are more than
[48:47] a much
[48:49] for amen what was there basing
[48:53] on God said I have given you the
[48:57] land amen it's yours amen it was the
[49:01] promise that God gave
[49:03] them and they knew that as long as they
[49:05] kept that
[49:07] promise as long as they were
[49:10] alive am as long as God was
[49:13] alive amen that promise will still be
[49:17] there amen and we serve an eternal
[49:20] God Amen and the guy who has no no

[1:27:01] confidence in him amen Lazarus was dead
[1:27:05] amen they all thought Jesus was not
[1:27:08] coming amen because when they needed him
[1:27:11] the
[1:27:13] most he didn't show
[1:27:15] up amen Lazarus was
[1:27:18] sick amen Jesus did not show
[1:27:21] up and it's not like Jesus was not aware
[1:27:24] of
[1:27:25] it the Bible said that somebody went to
[1:27:27] talk to
[1:27:28] him and he decided to go somewhere

[1:27:36] request amen he heard their
[1:27:39] prayers but he decided to take a little
[1:27:42] detour he decided to take some to go

[1:27:50] takes the greater test testimony it
[1:27:54] is longer it
[1:27:56] takes the greater impact that thing
[1:28:00] becomes four days

[1:29:11] matter amen as long as God has not said
