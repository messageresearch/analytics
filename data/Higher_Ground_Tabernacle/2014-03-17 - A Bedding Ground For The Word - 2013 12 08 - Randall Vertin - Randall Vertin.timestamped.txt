[0:00] good to see everybody here this morning
[0:01] by the grace of God everybody that was
[0:03] able to make it safely amen I don't know
[0:05] if anyone else is on the road or
[0:06] anything but just keep everybody in
[0:08] prayer you know I know things get
[0:11] strange once snow starts falling you
[0:14] think people ought to be used to it in
[0:15] Iowa but it seems like as soon as the
[0:16] snow comes out people kind of go a
[0:18] little crazy so I just know as soon as
[0:20] we walked out to our car this morning we
[0:23] heard police sirens going off so I just
[0:25] pray the Lord keep everyone safe and
[0:27] glad that everyone was able to make it
[0:29] here safely but the grace of God so uh
[0:32] we're going to try to get we're going to
[0:33] get right in the
[0:34] word let's just turn to Exodus chapter
[0:38] 4 just want to preach an encouraging
[0:41] message for you this morning just on
[0:44] faith because this is something we got
[0:46] to have in this hour you know where're
[0:49] every everywhere we turn our faith is
[0:51] being attacked whether it be in the in
[0:53] the government our faith is being
[0:54] attacked whether it be in your own mind
[0:57] you know or whether it be within this
[0:58] own this message itself you know it's
[1:00] being attacked from within so we we have
[1:03] to strengthen you know the scripture
[1:04] says that David encouraged himself in
[1:06] the Lord we have to strengthen ourselves
[1:08] we have to be at a place right now where
[1:10] we know what we
[1:11] possess and we can't let because the
[1:14] enemy is going to continue to do what he
[1:16] does because he doesn't change his
[1:18] tactics they've been he's been doing his
[1:20] thing for 6,000 years just like the
[1:21] Lord's been doing his so we have to be
[1:24] at a place where we know who we are and
[1:26] we have to know what we have in our
[1:29] possession
[1:31] and understand that what we have the
[1:32] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal so
[1:35] let's just read this little scripture
[1:37] here Exodus chapter 4 we're going to
[1:38] start at verse one said and Moses
[1:41] answered and said but behold they will
[1:43] not believe me nor hearken under my
[1:46] voice for they will say the Lord has not
[1:48] appeared unto thee now I have a question
[1:49] isn't that what people tell you all the
[1:51] time you try to give them this word and
[1:54] that's the first the Lord hasn't told
[1:56] you anything you know it doesn't seem
[1:57] like you got anything but I love what he
[2:00] tells him here and the Lord said unto
[2:01] him what is that in thine hand and he
[2:03] said a rod I can almost imagine him he's
[2:05] like he's probably Moses probably
[2:07] looking at it like it's a stick a rod
[2:11] and he says and he said cast it on the
[2:13] ground and he cast it on the ground and
[2:16] it became a serpent and Moses fled
[2:18] before it and the Lord said unto Moses
[2:21] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[2:22] tail and he put forth his hand and
[2:25] caught it and it became a rod in his
[2:27] hand that they may believe that the Lord
[2:29] God of their fathers the god of Abraham
[2:31] the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob
[2:34] hath appeared unto thee amen now let's
[2:36] just turn over to Mark chapter 4 as
[2:46] Wellen I trust everyone's in a good mood
[2:48] this morning amen it's the Lord's day
[2:51] every day is the Lord's day but this is
[2:53] the day one of the days we set aside to
[2:54] come together it ought to feel it ought
[2:56] to feel really good to be able to kind
[2:58] of take a break from the battles of the
[3:00] world that you're fighting out there
[3:01] this ought to be a place where you can
[3:03] as I say like you let you just let let
[3:05] everything out let it out just relax and
[3:08] enjoy the word of God so amen we're just
[3:10] going to read a little bit here and uh
[3:13] let's just start at verse 13 Mark
[3:16] 4:13 and he said unto them know ye not
[3:19] this Parable and how then will you know
[3:22] all Parables the swer Seth the word and
[3:25] these are they by the wayside where the
[3:27] word is sown but when they have heard
[3:29] Satan cometh immediately and taketh away
[3:32] the word that was sown in their hearts
[3:34] and these are they likewise which are
[3:36] sown on Stony ground who when they have
[3:38] heard the word immediately receive it
[3:40] with gladness and have no root in
[3:43] themselves and so endure but for a Time
[3:45] afterward when Affliction or persecution
[3:48] ariseth for the word's sake immediately
[3:50] they are offended and these are they
[3:52] which are sown among Thorns such as hear
[3:54] the word and the cares of this world and
[3:57] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[3:59] other things entering in choke the word
[4:01] and becometh unfruitful and these are
[4:03] they which are sown on good ground such
[4:05] as hear the word and receive it and
[4:07] bring forth fruit some 30 fold some 60
[4:10] and some 100 amen let's just bow our
[4:13] heads for a word of prayer dear Lord
[4:16] Jesus we just come to you father before
[4:18] your throne this morning Father we've
[4:20] once again gathered here before you Lord
[4:22] to hear your word Lord just to
[4:25] fellowship with you Lord Jesus we're not
[4:27] here just to hear the words of a man or
[4:29] to hear a lecture or something that'll
[4:31] tingle our ears Lord but we've come to
[4:33] fellowship with you Lord we've come to
[4:35] hear directly from the throne this
[4:37] morning Lord to hear what you would have
[4:39] to say to us father we're not here Lord
[4:41] to exalt ourselves we're not here to
[4:43] exalt any man any any other thing Lord
[4:46] we're here to exalt the name of Jesus
[4:48] Christ above all names Lord God you've
[4:51] saved us Lord you taken us from the the
[4:54] the Fowler snare Lord God you've taken
[4:56] us out of the places where it seemed
[4:58] like we couldn't have any place to turn
[5:00] but Lord your word Lord your Holy Spirit
[5:03] Lord your your word itself God has
[5:06] always been faithful to us Lord we love
[5:08] you and we appreciate you this morning
[5:10] oh God We Trust You Lord and we're
[5:12] looking towards you Lord the author and
[5:14] finisher of our faith Lord to speak to
[5:16] us and to encourage us this morning Lord
[5:18] we pray that you would just have
[5:19] preeminence in the service any Spirit
[5:22] contrary to you right now we bind it in
[5:23] the name of Jesus Christ we come with
[5:25] the authority Lord that you've given to
[5:27] your bride in this hour Lord to to
[5:29] trample upon those serpents Lord that
[5:32] try to infiltrate the place of God but
[5:34] we know our position oh God we know the
[5:36] authority that you've granted to us to
[5:38] have power over these things and we bind
[5:40] those in the name of Jesus Christ and we
[5:42] put them under our feet right now Lord
[5:45] come and speak to your people Lord
[5:46] Empower your people by the word of God
[5:49] this morning Lord to live overcoming and
[5:52] Lord holy lives Lord and we just thank
[5:54] you for it in the name of Jesus Christ
[5:56] we pray amen you may be seated amen good
[5:59] to see everybody still showing up by the
[6:01] grace of God I know the snow is you know
[6:03] it's it's I I'd tell my wife my wife
[6:05] likes snow L sister Lindsay loves snow
[6:07] and I I just can't I just can't handle
[6:10] it she she get the first time it snowed
[6:12] those few weeks back she had such a big
[6:14] grin on her face and I was about ready
[6:15] to cry but you know we just thank the
[6:17] lord for keeping everybody safe getting
[6:19] here and that the Lord will keep you on
[6:22] your way out
[6:23] amen right we just want to preach a
[6:25] message we just want to preach preach
[6:27] this over at brother Cam's church and I
[6:29] just felt led to kind of go we you know
[6:31] the Lord takes it whatever Direction he
[6:33] will but kind of start with the same
[6:34] idea we want to speak on a betting
[6:36] ground for the
[6:37] word because you you yourself are a
[6:40] betting ground we understand by by the
[6:43] word that in the beginning the the very
[6:44] Earth was a womb and this womb in it was
[6:47] placed all of these seeds in the ground
[6:50] and you yourself are a little Earth
[6:52] you're a little you're a little field
[6:55] and the word has been sown in your heart
[6:57] from the foundation of the world a word
[6:59] went forth and was placed In Your Vessel
[7:02] and it's now it's either growing it
[7:04] could be stagnant and that's why we
[7:06] wanted to read this scripture on the
[7:08] parable of the sewer because we
[7:10] understand that there were four types of
[7:12] ground there there was a there was a
[7:14] Wayside where the word was tried to be
[7:16] swn and yet it had no place to even gain
[7:19] any root whatsoever it just it just kind
[7:22] of bounced off as if it was a piece of
[7:23] concrete and and and I know we've all
[7:26] been in those situations you try to give
[7:28] the word to somebody and it just seems
[7:30] as though it just bounces off it doesn't
[7:32] have any place you people laugh at you
[7:34] they just look at you like you're crazy
[7:36] they they don't want to have anything to
[7:38] do with this gospel that you hold in
[7:39] your hand then we under and we're
[7:42] talking things that we all probably
[7:43] heard before but we just trust it'll be
[7:45] encouraging to you because we also
[7:47] understand that we have the the the
[7:49] thorny ground we have we have a place or
[7:52] Stony ground where it fell but it didn't
[7:54] have a place to gain root and and and
[7:57] and we've all I believe we've seen it in
[7:59] this church we've seen where where you
[8:02] give the word to a person and they
[8:04] receive it and it seems like it's
[8:06] starting to take hold but there's
[8:08] something there it just can't really
[8:10] seem to grab a root and as soon as
[8:12] something comes up they're offended and
[8:14] they turn away how many people have we
[8:16] seen in this church by itself that seem
[8:19] to come and they seem so excited and
[8:21] then and they just fall away and it's
[8:24] such a grieving thing to your heart to
[8:26] see but but it shows that there was
[8:28] something in that could that could
[8:31] accept the truth of the word but there
[8:33] wasn't any place for it to really gain
[8:36] root and we see that when the storms
[8:38] come they just blow over we've all seen
[8:40] those little plants they grow up and as
[8:41] soon as you know it doesn't have any
[8:43] place and it just topples over and and
[8:45] the root system only went but you know
[8:47] maybe a couple inches into the ground
[8:49] and that's what we see with a lot of
[8:50] people that accept the word for this
[8:53] hour is they come so far and they
[8:56] receive it really quickly but that is
[8:59] soon as maybe their families come
[9:01] against them maybe the people at their
[9:03] old friends can't accept it they it it
[9:06] becomes a social gospel to them and
[9:09] because they don't have what they
[9:11] consider a support system they can't
[9:13] take it anymore and they fall away we've
[9:15] seen to here but the really ones we want
[9:18] to focus on this morning are the last
[9:20] two we want to talk about the the ground
[9:24] where it fell among the Thorns because
[9:26] here we have a people it it's a ground
[9:29] that was able to receive the word Not
[9:32] only was it able to receive the word but
[9:35] it was able to grow it was able to shoot
[9:38] forth some branches here and there and
[9:40] it the the scripture never says that
[9:43] that word was ever was ever not able to
[9:46] grow but it was not fruitful and that's
[9:50] where we see a lot of people that are
[9:52] believers today is they the word's
[9:55] growing it's trying to grow but there
[9:57] are things in their lives choking the
[10:00] very life from that word that's trying
[10:03] to express
[10:04] itself and we see that in people's lives
[10:07] today they they're believers they
[10:10] believe the word they they haven't been
[10:12] chased Away by persecution they haven't
[10:15] been chased Away by their families or
[10:17] their friends or whatever else of the
[10:19] world that's tried to attack them but
[10:21] the the the thing
[10:23] within has sprung up and it's choked out
[10:26] the very life they they're they're
[10:28] shooting roting forth branches but
[10:30] there's something there that won't let
[10:32] them bring forth the fruits of the
[10:34] spirit there's something there that
[10:37] won't let them bring forth the very Life
[10:40] of Christ that's it's there in the seed
[10:43] that the life is there because it's
[10:45] growing but there's something hindering
[10:48] it and what does he say it's the cares
[10:50] of the world it's the it's the
[10:53] deceitfulness of riches it it's this
[10:56] running around to and fro trying to
[10:58] establish Lish a place here instead of
[11:02] establishing your place over Yonder in
[11:05] heaven Hallelujah instead of setting
[11:07] your affections on the things that be of
[11:10] God we've set our affections on the
[11:12] things of this world we want to have a
[11:14] nice car we want to have a nice place to
[11:16] live we want to have this and we want to
[11:19] have that not knowing the whole time
[11:22] that it's sucking the very life out of
[11:24] that seed that God put in
[11:28] you
[11:30] these things seem very Elementary but
[11:33] it's the reason I believe that we aren't
[11:36] seeing the power of God in our churches
[11:38] like we ought
[11:40] to because the word of God is true amen
[11:43] I think everyone here would it would
[11:45] admit that I don't think anyone here is
[11:47] going to say that the word of God is not
[11:49] true we all believe that then why don't
[11:52] we see the power why do we not see in
[11:56] Acts 238 Church
[11:58] here I'm not here to condemn us this
[12:01] isn't this isn't a message being
[12:03] preached to make you feel bad but what
[12:06] it should do it needs to encourage you
[12:08] because you have the goods in you this
[12:11] isn't about whether you have it or not I
[12:14] believe every one of us here has it you
[12:16] wouldn't be here if you didn't I don't
[12:18] believe that you've stood the test
[12:21] you've seen family members maybe come
[12:23] and go you've seen friends or people
[12:26] that you loved and cared about come and
[12:28] go but there's something in you holding
[12:30] you here you're still here the rest of
[12:34] the Bel the signers and all these things
[12:37] can come and go as they please there's
[12:39] something in you holding you
[12:41] here but now we've got to take it a step
[12:44] further it's not enough just to be in
[12:48] the message it's come time for this
[12:51] bride to become the message she can't
[12:54] just believe it she has to become
[12:57] it every bit of it every bit of power we
[13:01] don't see the power like we ought to see
[13:04] I really believe if the power of God was
[13:06] in this place the way the Bible teaches
[13:09] it that a demon couldn't come within
[13:11] miles of this
[13:14] place you know it Marvels me because you
[13:17] read the scripture and you see Jesus
[13:19] Christ whenever a demon even came within
[13:22] his presence it cried out and it said
[13:25] what have we to do with thee get away
[13:27] from us
[13:30] that's the way but see the devil has put
[13:32] it in our minds that that's not for the
[13:34] believer in this hour but that's exactly
[13:37] what it's
[13:38] for we are to be the very Life of Christ
[13:41] again on this
[13:43] Earth it's not about see we get so stuck
[13:46] on the works we get so stuck on what
[13:49] we're doing and and these different
[13:51] things it's not about the works per se
[13:54] it's the very life when your very
[13:57] presence because of your relationship
[13:59] with Jesus Christ is so powerful that
[14:03] people can't help but take notice that
[14:05] you've been with
[14:08] Jesus though you may be ignorant and
[14:11] unlearned they take notice just like
[14:14] they did in the book of Acts that you
[14:16] had been with Jesus there's something
[14:19] there they can't explain it but they
[14:21] know it's there that's the that's the
[14:24] power of Christ to the believer
[14:28] yes but it's a nielan spirit has crept
[14:32] back into the
[14:33] church because the people and I'm not
[14:37] saying just here I'm talking about
[14:39] everywhere you see it the people have
[14:42] placed the burning back into the
[14:48] pulpit they put all the burden of the
[14:51] preachers they lift men up to places
[14:55] they ought not to be and it's not about
[14:58] those men the men may have nothing to do
[15:01] with it just like Saul didn't even have
[15:03] anything to do with himself becoming
[15:05] King but the
[15:07] people could not accept the leadership
[15:10] of the Holy Ghost for
[15:13] themselves they say let a man lead us
[15:16] and it always comes back to that but
[15:18] that's not what God wants he wants to
[15:21] lead his children individually that's
[15:24] not to say we don't have pastors and all
[15:26] these things they're put there by God
[15:28] but has become such a place that you
[15:30] can't pray for somebody unless you call
[15:33] the pastor first Lord because you don't
[15:36] have confidence in the power of God in
[15:38] you
[15:40] amen the burden is not on brother Brooks
[15:43] it's not on some other brother and
[15:44] another Pulpit somewhere it's not on me
[15:46] or brother Troy whoever it might be the
[15:49] burden it lies with all of
[15:52] us amen the power lies within you it's
[15:57] not just within the ministry
[15:59] because the bride as a whole has a
[16:02] Ministry
[16:04] amen everywhere you go you're a light
[16:08] amen it's not just your pastor that's to
[16:10] be a light you're the light
[16:14] amen it's not just the minister the song
[16:17] leader the Elders of the church you are
[16:20] a light amen doesn't matter how young
[16:22] you are doesn't matter how old you are
[16:25] doesn't matter if you've never preached
[16:27] a message in your life every day day you
[16:29] live as a message to the world around
[16:34] you he's made us all priests and Kings
[16:37] that's not to say everyone has to preach
[16:40] everyone has to sing but you have a
[16:42] Ministry every day you live amen and
[16:45] there is supposed to be a power of God
[16:47] in you that could be undeniable amen so
[16:51] where is it am that's the problem it's
[16:53] the cares of the world has choked the
[16:56] life out of the people of the church
[16:59] they're so worried we're worried about
[17:01] everything else but
[17:04] God we're worried about our family
[17:06] members and it seems virtuous because we
[17:10] we love our family which is good like
[17:12] they say worry is not a virtue
[17:15] right if you don't have enough trust in
[17:19] Christ to put it in his hands and leave
[17:21] it then how are you going to trust them
[17:23] to make a Rapture amen you we've heard
[17:27] brother Brooks preach it but it's
[17:29] exactly the truth if God were to T and
[17:32] we were to
[17:34] die where's your where's your trust in
[17:36] then there's nothing you can do to bring
[17:39] yourself back to life at that
[17:40] point it has to be a trust in the all
[17:44] knowing all seeing all power
[17:46] Supernatural power of God it can't be
[17:50] based on what you think you can do you
[17:52] have to have confidence in what he can
[17:56] do it these things sound simp
[17:59] but these are the building blocks that
[18:01] many times people lose because they're
[18:04] so busy focused on what they've done
[18:08] what they've been able to accomplish
[18:10] it's not about what you can accomplish
[18:12] it's about what Christ can accomplish
[18:15] through you
[18:16] amen I mean who's to say there there are
[18:19] people I believe that'll make a Rapture
[18:21] whose only Ministry was to show up for
[18:24] every church service on
[18:27] time why because there Ministry may have
[18:29] been something as simple as encouraging
[18:32] that Pastor or preacher that every time
[18:34] they showed up God had someon there to
[18:36] hear the message it could be that simple
[18:39] and that could be what you what fulfills
[18:41] the ministry God's given to you you
[18:44] don't
[18:46] know I think we get so caught up in
[18:48] these things wanting to be something
[18:51] great the Holy Ghost doesn't make you
[18:53] want to be great the Holy Ghost makes
[18:55] you want to be
[18:57] small the Holy Ghost humbles you amen I
[19:01] just listened to the message what was
[19:03] the Holy Ghost given for and brother
[19:04] brandom said he said if you if you have
[19:06] a desire to be great he said you better
[19:08] check your experience with the Holy
[19:10] Ghost he said because the Holy Ghost
[19:12] comes to make you small amen and then he
[19:15] exalts you in due time it and that has
[19:17] nothing to do with it anyway if God
[19:18] doesn't exalt you who cares as long as
[19:21] he glorifies you with him in the End
[19:25] Amen it shouldn't matter we're so
[19:28] worried about all these little
[19:30] things let's turn to Hosea 10 just to
[19:33] give you a good scripture you see we
[19:34] built up we built up men we've done
[19:37] exactly what the Catholic Church did
[19:40] we're we're starting to do it at least
[19:41] we're in the throat now remember this
[19:43] won't become a denomination but the
[19:45] spirit of it is certainly present the
[19:48] nickan spirit is still
[19:52] there it's still fighting the people of
[19:54] God and what does it do what does that
[19:56] nielan spirit always do it wants to put
[19:58] man at the head instead of
[20:02] God Hosea chapter 10 and we're going to
[20:04] read verses 12 and
[20:06] 13 this scripture really just blessed me
[20:11] he said so do yourselves in
[20:13] righteousness reap in Mercy break up
[20:15] your fow ground for it is time to seek
[20:17] the Lord till he come and Reign
[20:19] righteousness upon you said ye have
[20:21] plowed wickedness ye have reaped
[20:23] iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies
[20:26] because thou did trust in thy way and in
[20:29] the multitude of thy Mighty Men now is
[20:32] that not what the churches have done
[20:34] they trust because they have these
[20:36] powerful preachers that they got
[20:39] something they trust that because they
[20:42] have this person whether it be
[20:44] denominational with your TD Jakes and
[20:46] your Joel oins and all these different
[20:48] ones that they exalt to such a place
[20:51] they think because they have these
[20:52] people they have something but unless
[20:55] you have Christ you have nothing amen
[20:58] and that's what they've lost just
[21:00] because you have a great ministry
[21:01] doesn't mean you haven't had experience
[21:04] with God it doesn't mean
[21:07] anything it's got to be a real Holy
[21:10] Ghost experience with
[21:13] God you can't have faith in God unless
[21:15] you've experienced him you can't the
[21:19] only way that you can believe that he is
[21:22] is that you've experience that he is
[21:24] amen Hebrews says he that has he he
[21:27] without faith it's impossible to please
[21:29] God for he that cometh to God must
[21:31] believe that he is how can you believe
[21:34] that he is except that you've
[21:35] experienced that he is amen anything
[21:38] less than that and you're going off of
[21:40] here say
[21:45] Amen if I said I believe in God because
[21:48] I've seen what God's done for brother
[21:50] Isaac that's wonderful but that didn't
[21:52] do anything for me I could believe in
[21:55] what God's done for brother Isaac all
[21:58] day long
[21:59] and I believe that's what people have
[22:02] done people see different ones that
[22:05] God's blessed and they latch on to that
[22:08] as though it's them now there's nothing
[22:11] wrong in taking
[22:12] encouragement and taking strength from
[22:15] the things that God's doing for other
[22:17] people but except you have the
[22:19] experience yourself it does you no
[22:23] good it's just like I'm starving and I
[22:26] see Brother Rich eating a big juicy head
[22:28] hamburger I say bless God I'm full now I
[22:32] saw Brother Rich eat a big juicy
[22:33] hamburger it doesn't work that way
[22:35] except I eat it myself amen and that's
[22:38] what we've done we we and I'm out trying
[22:41] to preach against the church but we look
[22:43] up here and we see brother Brooks and we
[22:45] get excited because he gets
[22:48] excited I've seen it we the the the the
[22:51] service could be dead until brother
[22:53] Brooks gets up here and then all of a
[22:54] sudden everybody gets into it what is it
[22:57] what we people trying to live of another
[23:00] man's
[23:01] experience but if you look at the
[23:03] foolish virgins that's exactly why they
[23:06] were foolish virgins because in the end
[23:09] instead of going straight to them that
[23:11] sold they went to the ones that had the
[23:13] oil first and tried to leech off of them
[23:17] amen they said give us up your oil and
[23:20] they said we can't do it go get it where
[23:23] we got it from amen and that's what you
[23:25] see in the churches is people trying to
[23:29] pull off an experience that's not their
[23:33] own and if you do that you will die
[23:38] amen you can mentally even work yourself
[23:41] up enough to make it seem like you're
[23:43] doing right because it's amazing what
[23:45] the mind can do now we don't believe in
[23:48] like mind over matter in the sense that
[23:50] you know those aren't the things that
[23:51] heals you but if you really get into
[23:52] those things you you can have people
[23:55] that'll starve themselves to death and
[23:56] tell you they'll swear to your face face
[23:58] that they're full of food because they
[24:00] their mind can deceive them and that's
[24:03] what's happened is the people have
[24:05] gotten to a place that they've they
[24:07] they've got it up here so much that
[24:09] they've convinced themselves they've let
[24:11] their mind override what their heart is
[24:13] trying to tell
[24:16] them and what the word's trying to tell
[24:19] them you got to look in the mirror of
[24:20] the word and except you line up with
[24:22] this word you don't have it the way you
[24:24] ought to have it yet it's just the truth
[24:27] of the matter this isn't trying to knock
[24:29] anybody down that because what the the
[24:31] point is is that it's in you to do it
[24:34] you have the the the the potential you
[24:37] have all the building blocks in you all
[24:40] you have to do is unleash it you have to
[24:43] be crazy enough to believe God when
[24:46] everybody else says you're nuts amen
[24:49] just like Moses everybody thought he was
[24:52] crazy when he led him to the Red Sea and
[24:55] there was no way
[24:56] out but there was a way it doesn't
[25:00] matter youd say I don't have the Holy
[25:02] Ghost yet I haven't seen this in my life
[25:04] I haven't seen that I don't care what it
[25:06] looks
[25:07] like you got to flee like Moses what is
[25:10] it that you have in your
[25:12] hand and hold it up before God and say
[25:15] this is all I've got this is what you
[25:17] gave me but I'm holding to what I've got
[25:21] amen amen we could go through all the
[25:24] scriptures on that we can talk about
[25:26] shamgar when brother bandam talks about
[25:28] him and how he slew all those things
[25:29] with an ox gold nothing but a piece of
[25:32] brass on a stick one little Revelation
[25:35] is all he
[25:36] had with that This Land is Our Land not
[25:41] the Philistines land and with that
[25:43] little
[25:44] Revelation he was able to do things that
[25:47] seemed
[25:50] impossible Samson did the same thing he
[25:53] had the Jawbone of an
[25:55] ass and he slew
[25:59] piles upon piles of men I believe in the
[26:02] scripture he says heaps upon heaps he
[26:05] slain a thousand men with the jaw in ass
[26:08] it doesn't make sense when a person can
[26:12] stand there in the presence of God in
[26:15] the church and people look down on them
[26:17] because they may not have all the
[26:19] victory they think they ought to have
[26:20] but there's something in them holding
[26:22] still Hallelujah the people may
[26:24] mock they may laugh but all you to do is
[26:28] keep holding to what you got amen don't
[26:32] give up on God he's still here amen he's
[26:37] still amongst his people right now hallu
[26:40] the bride's going to have her Revival I
[26:42] don't care what you think it looks like
[26:45] I don't care what the devil tells you it
[26:46] looks like the bride will have her
[26:48] Revival it's coming it's got to
[26:54] comeall and it's here it's in you it
[26:58] just got to be unlocked amen and the
[27:00] only thing that can unlock it is Faith
[27:03] that's the only thing that can unlock
[27:04] this thing because until you believe
[27:07] that it's yours it won't be yours that's
[27:10] right we've heard the thing said a
[27:12] million times you know if I hold out a
[27:14] million dollars and ask someone to come
[27:16] take
[27:17] it that tell you shikina this million
[27:19] dollars is yours and she just looks at
[27:21] me and says no it's not I'm like no it's
[27:24] yours take it and she says no it's not
[27:26] the only thing hindering her is her
[27:29] faith in what I've said if she'd say
[27:32] Okay poof she takes it now see and the
[27:35] devil right now is telling your mind if
[27:36] it was that easy I'd have everything I
[27:38] need to have but the thing is is that
[27:41] it's it's about trying your faith this
[27:43] is a trying time and and really God is
[27:46] looking to see how long you're willing
[27:49] to hold
[27:50] on how much are you willing to go
[27:53] through I I I'm telling you because you
[27:56] have it in you amen but how much are you
[27:59] willing to stand when everything seems
[28:02] lost are you still going to stand on
[28:04] that word amen when everything is
[28:06] falling apart are you going to stand
[28:08] still and see the salvation of God are
[28:11] you going to stand amen he that endureth
[28:14] unto the end shall be saved amen and
[28:17] that's what we're doing right now is it
[28:18] not we're enduring with everything we
[28:21] got you're hold it on but just keep
[28:26] holding it's the same thing with Jesus
[28:29] at the tomb of Lazarus they held on they
[28:32] held on they held on they kept calling
[28:35] Jesus call Jesus calling Jesus and he
[28:37] wouldn't
[28:39] come I know many of you right now feel
[28:41] like that you've been calling Jesus
[28:44] calling Jesus calling Jesus and he
[28:46] hasn't seems like he hasn't come but all
[28:49] you got to do is just hold on to that
[28:53] word it doesn't matter what the
[28:56] situation looks like
[28:59] your Christian Life may be dead maybe it
[29:03] seems like your Christian walk is dead
[29:05] and it's so bad you put it in a tomb
[29:08] just like Lazarus and you buried it
[29:09] behind a stone cuz you're so scared it's
[29:12] going to
[29:13] stink cuz you you know you know yourself
[29:15] better than anybody you know the things
[29:17] you battle you know the struggles you
[29:19] have you know the things now look I'm
[29:22] just being straight up with you I'm not
[29:24] going to I'm not going to sugarcoat
[29:25] stuff because everybody has been in this
[29:28] I've been in the experience where I
[29:30] thought I had something whipped for
[29:32] years and then the devil all of a sudden
[29:34] comes out of left field with that thing
[29:35] I thought I'd whipped and all of a
[29:37] sudden I was struggling again with it
[29:39] and I got to feel like I got to whip it
[29:40] all over again it doesn't matter you
[29:43] just keep holding on to that
[29:46] thing you got to respond just like Mary
[29:49] or Martha even
[29:51] now even now God will do whatever you
[29:55] ask amen that's the way it's got to be
[29:58] be for a believer in this hour because
[30:00] the deck is stacked against you amen
[30:03] it's I'm sorry it's stacked against you
[30:05] there' be more with the children of the
[30:07] devil than there be with the children of
[30:09] God but even now he's able to raise up
[30:14] people of God amen amen I may look crazy
[30:18] that's okay but I believe
[30:22] God I don't care what my situation looks
[30:26] like I know who I believe amen amen I
[30:31] don't care if my hand never seems like
[30:34] it's going to get healed I know my God
[30:38] Lives amen
[30:40] amen sister valand you may feel like
[30:42] you're going down down down but you're
[30:44] going up amen I don't care what the
[30:48] devil says you stand out of the
[30:51] word hallelujah if you got to go to your
[30:54] grave whoever you
[30:56] are quoting that word over and over
[30:59] again you do it
[31:01] amenallah who knows if God wants you to
[31:04] be a testimony for the one that didn't
[31:07] even see your request come to pass yet
[31:10] you held to the head of God
[31:14] am how powerful a testimony is that
[31:16] going to be see everybody wants the
[31:19] testimonies on this side but think about
[31:21] the testimonies on that side wo think
[31:24] about that you've been struggling with
[31:26] something your whole life maybe maybe
[31:28] you struggle with diabetes like our
[31:30] brother and all of a sudden I'm not
[31:31] trying to speak nothing on you brother
[31:33] but all of a sudden you know the Devil
[31:35] comes along and the Lord lets him take
[31:36] you away for whatever it might be maybe
[31:38] you have a heart condition and you
[31:39] struggled with it your whole life and
[31:41] you've been praying and believing God
[31:43] and all of a sudden God just lets him
[31:45] take you away with that heart condition
[31:46] no less you have a massive heart attack
[31:48] and die at the age of like
[31:50] 35 but you held on through the
[31:53] end what kind of testimony what kind of
[31:57] reproach will that bring to the rest of
[32:00] that world when you rais up at that
[32:02] throne and those people standing before
[32:04] you claiming trying to Puff their chest
[32:06] in the face of God and saying we believ
[32:09] you and you didn't come through and then
[32:12] you stand up and say I believed him till
[32:17] death and he didn't disappoint
[32:21] hallelujah what kind of a Tex I'm not
[32:23] trying to say that's going to happen to
[32:24] sister valer or whoever but I'm just
[32:26] saying see our mind said it's so wrong
[32:29] amen though he slay me I will trust
[32:35] him it doesn't matter what this world's
[32:40] got I know where I'm going when it's all
[32:43] said and
[32:44] done who cares whether you see it on
[32:47] this side or that I'd rather it on that
[32:50] side anyway cuz this word ain't got
[32:53] nothing for
[32:56] me you got to be willing to trust them
[32:59] all the way through
[33:03] though no doubt those Romans that watch
[33:07] those Christians die at the teeth of the
[33:08] lions were laughing at them saying their
[33:13] God could not even deliver them from the
[33:15] mouths of the Lions no doubt maybe some
[33:18] of them who had a little bit of fear
[33:19] were casting it out with the scripture
[33:21] with Daniel he said he delivered me out
[33:23] of the mouth of the lion and they go and
[33:26] die it looks
[33:29] crazy but the death of the Saints is
[33:31] precious in the sight of God when a man
[33:35] or woman can die whether it be dying to
[33:38] themselves or dying in the natural and
[33:40] going to the other side if you could do
[33:43] that with a faith in God God is well
[33:45] pleased with
[33:49] you but see if that's not your mindset
[33:52] see that's the thing and I believe
[33:54] that's what it takes when you get to a
[33:55] point and your faith
[33:58] I'm not saying who what is what I don't
[34:00] know but I really believe that many
[34:03] times God is waiting for you to get to
[34:04] that point in your faith till he comes
[34:06] on the
[34:08] seene because we're waiting to believe
[34:10] we're waiting to fully trust God we're
[34:12] waiting for the for the for the
[34:15] manifestation before we fully put
[34:18] everything into it you know what I'm
[34:20] saying it's like we won't do it until we
[34:21] see the down payment investment you know
[34:23] we got to see it but if we could just
[34:25] have faith in God no matter what amen
[34:27] what's going to
[34:28] happen you know I take comfort in the
[34:32] fact that a man of God like brother
[34:34] brandom who who God answered his prayers
[34:37] all the time could come and sit there
[34:39] and say if I prayed for a thousand and
[34:41] they died I prayed for a thousand
[34:43] tomorrow amen why because what happens
[34:46] here doesn't
[34:49] dictate the power of His word amen it
[34:52] just doesn't the world tries to tell you
[34:55] every day that it does but it does it
[34:58] amen unbelief does not hinder God it
[35:01] can't amen and we've let we've let all
[35:04] these these cares of the world come and
[35:06] choke us out we're so worried about this
[35:10] and about that and about what we're
[35:11] going to eat and I I I may have preached
[35:13] this here before but it struck me when I
[35:15] read the scripture where Paul said
[35:16] having therefore food and reignment let
[35:18] us therefore be content he didn't even
[35:20] talk about having a place to live no
[35:22] doubt when he wrote that the Holy Spirit
[35:23] quickened to him how Jesus said foxes
[35:25] have holes and birds have nests but the
[35:26] son of man have no place to is he won't
[35:28] even talk about having a place to live
[35:31] all he say is having therefore food and
[35:32] reignment let's be content amen and you
[35:35] have food and rment oh you say oh I
[35:37] don't maybe I don't have enough to eat
[35:38] oh yeah you do you got the word of God
[35:41] you got bread that no man knows of you
[35:44] got clothing clothe that is
[35:46] righteousness that no man knows of see
[35:48] we're so carnal we think because we lack
[35:51] in the natural something's wrong and I
[35:54] aome thought about that because
[35:56] everybody talks about oh but but David
[35:58] said you know I have not seen the
[35:59] righteous forsaken nor his seed begging
[36:01] bread and yet they he think then the
[36:02] devil say well what about Lazarus
[36:04] underneath the table the poor man
[36:06] begging the crumbs sound like he was
[36:08] begging his bread that's cuz you're
[36:09] carnal we're talking spiritual bread
[36:12] this natural stuff has got nothing to do
[36:15] with where you stand in the
[36:18] spiritual oh that that kind of hurt some
[36:20] people I think but that's the
[36:23] truth if you I don't care if I'm begging
[36:25] my bread I have me to eat that they
[36:28] don't know of I got I got clothing that
[36:31] they have no idea where it comes from
[36:34] that's what I've got and yet we worry
[36:37] about the carnal things he said he said
[36:39] you worry about this and that he said
[36:41] you compare yourselves one with another
[36:44] and and you just read what Paul's
[36:45] talking he said aren't you
[36:47] carnal why do we worry about these
[36:50] things it goes to show that our
[36:52] affections aren't where they ought to be
[36:54] amen it's a symptom because every time I
[36:58] listen to the messages and I hear
[37:00] Brother brandham give that phrase if you
[37:01] love the world or the things of the
[37:02] world the love of God is not even in you
[37:05] I don't know about you but that cuts to
[37:06] my heart every time because every time
[37:09] something comes to my mind it's
[37:10] something I haven't given up yet and I
[37:13] say oh God help me because if your
[37:16] affections are here here's where you'll
[37:19] stay that you're where your heart is
[37:23] that that's where you're going to
[37:24] be but if your heart is on things above
[37:27] amen oh it's so simple but it's really
[37:30] just about selling out it's see there's
[37:33] nothing wrong with having things you I'm
[37:35] not telling you to go out and give
[37:37] everything away and be poor just for the
[37:38] sake of being poor because you got to
[37:41] understand your motive makes a
[37:42] difference too if you're just doing it
[37:43] just to just to be because a lot of
[37:45] people have done that too they'll go out
[37:47] and do these things just to be seen just
[37:48] like a
[37:52] Pharisee say oh I don't have anything
[37:54] because I gave it all to God oh I'm sure
[37:55] you did it may looked like it but in
[37:58] your heart there was something just like
[38:00] ananas and Safa you it just becomes
[38:02] another one of those you did it for the
[38:04] appearance but your heart wasn't in it
[38:07] see that's where it comes down to but
[38:09] we're talking about we're talking about
[38:11] a betting ground for the word of God you
[38:14] are a betting ground for the word of God
[38:17] there is a word of God for you that he's
[38:20] prepared a bride that there's a bride
[38:22] making herself ready right now and that
[38:25] word's for you amen but you have to have
[38:28] your bedding ground your field has to be
[38:31] prepared to receive that
[38:34] seed and see we take these scripture
[38:37] when we read the parable of the so we we
[38:39] a lot of times we bring it to Salvation
[38:41] you know we we cut it off at the
[38:42] Salvation point but you got to
[38:44] understand that right now the word going
[38:47] forth right now is a
[38:49] seed and it's striking your field right
[38:53] now and the condition of your field when
[38:57] you receive I'm not talking about what
[38:59] I'm saying it's the word of God it's not
[39:01] about me but your condition spiritually
[39:05] when this word strikes that field will
[39:08] determine what it brings forth amen for
[39:11] you it may just who knows it could just
[39:14] be bouncing off the walls on the Wayside
[39:16] and the files will come pick it up it'll
[39:18] never do anything for some of you this
[39:21] message or this word going forth might
[39:23] bring a Deliverance in your life but you
[39:25] better be careful if your your heart
[39:27] wasn't Stony because give it a week or
[39:30] two and that Victory you thought you had
[39:33] will get taken away as soon as
[39:34] persecution
[39:37] comes now the place we're all at that
[39:41] thorny ground fighting those things now
[39:44] whether that your ground is thorny or
[39:47] not that's the main thing you're
[39:49] fighting whether your ground is that way
[39:51] I don't know that's between you and God
[39:54] but that's the age we're in we're in a
[39:57] thorny ground age we're in the age of
[40:00] cares of the world Easy Living
[40:03] everywhere the world is trying to tell
[40:05] you what you don't have and what you
[40:07] ought to have you got to have this car
[40:10] you got to have these clothes you got to
[40:12] have this phone this and that it's
[40:14] everything everywhere that's the spirit
[40:17] that's trying to engulf the people of
[40:19] God right now he's already got because
[40:22] like I said we've been here long enough
[40:24] most of us have been here long enough to
[40:26] know that the word is is Right amen but
[40:28] now he tries to get those cares of the
[40:31] world to come in those little foxes
[40:34] trying to spoil your Vine and you need
[40:36] to get that Holy Ghost shotgun and start
[40:38] blasting them out of there amen because
[40:41] because it's not see because the devil
[40:43] tried to always bring you back to square
[40:45] one right as soon as something happen so
[40:48] many times not all of us but many of us
[40:51] as soon as something happens in your
[40:53] life that doesn't agree with the word he
[40:54] cried to bring it back to square one
[40:56] you're not even saved
[40:59] he does oh you don't even have the Holy
[41:01] Ghost you ain't got this you ain't got
[41:02] that you ain't got this and all he's
[41:04] doing is trying to choke the life out of
[41:06] it he knows that if you could just take
[41:11] that sword of faith and start hacking
[41:13] away at those little weeds and Thorns
[41:15] that that thing would live because it
[41:17] wants to live amen it's here it's in you
[41:20] the word's there amen but the only thing
[41:23] you got to do is you got to clear out
[41:25] your Fields you got to make room for
[41:28] that that thing to
[41:30] live amen I hope that's
[41:34] okay
[41:39] amen see I love it because you think
[41:41] about Mary and Martha at the tomb of
[41:44] Lazarus and and and the first time Jesus
[41:48] came it seemed like Mary had the right
[41:50] thing and Martha wasn't doing the right
[41:52] thing but you see but it wasn't that way
[41:55] Martha had her moment where she was busy
[41:57] about the little things of the world and
[41:59] Jesus said you've been busy about many
[42:00] things but only one thing is needful and
[42:02] Mary's chosen the better part but then
[42:05] when you see the tomb of Lazarus when
[42:06] the rubber meets the road Martha had a
[42:08] little something too and see that's what
[42:10] the devil does he tries to come and how
[42:13] many of us how many of you had you been
[42:17] Martha in that situation and Jesus said
[42:19] she chose the better part you're busy
[42:20] about all these other things but this is
[42:22] the thing that's really needful how many
[42:24] how many people now would have just
[42:26] gotten desponded
[42:28] and say oh God the master said I'm not
[42:29] even doing the right thing that's what
[42:32] happens a lot of times in the church
[42:34] because the word comes forth and might
[42:36] tell you something and the devil's right
[42:38] in your ear to tell you you ain't got
[42:40] nothing you're useless it's garbage
[42:43] you're you're you're just a piece of
[42:45] trash but see Martha still had a little
[42:47] something cuz when that La when Lazarus
[42:50] died and the rber met the road she was
[42:53] there to run to Jesus and say if you had
[42:56] been here my my brother would not have
[42:58] died and how many of you have been that
[43:00] way you got situations in your life and
[43:03] Jesus doesn't seem like he comes right
[43:05] away and the situation just gets from
[43:08] worse to worse to worse everywhere you
[43:11] look around it's just getting worse and
[43:13] worse and worse and then when Jesus
[43:15] finally comes say Lord had you been here
[43:18] this mess wouldn't have
[43:20] happen but how many times do you follow
[43:22] up like Martha did but even now see a
[43:26] lot of times we get
[43:28] attitudes we we do we get attitudes
[43:31] because God didn't work on our schedule
[43:34] and now there's this huge mess most of
[43:37] the times that we made because we tried
[43:39] to stick our hands in it and fix it
[43:40] ourselves instead of waiting on God just
[43:43] like Saul if you would have just waited
[43:45] on Samuel to do the sacrifice and
[43:48] everything he needed to do he wouldn't
[43:49] have made the mess that he did but what
[43:51] do we do we put our hands in it we try
[43:54] to fix it ourselves we think we know
[43:56] what's going to happen
[43:57] and God comes he says why did you do
[44:02] that just like he said to Mary Mar he
[44:04] said he said I'm glad I wasn't here he
[44:07] said I'm glad I wasn't here so because
[44:10] there's a purpose behind it see it
[44:13] really comes down to
[44:15] trust these things are so simple but
[44:18] isn't that the problems that we Face are
[44:22] the simple problems see for I believe
[44:25] for all of us here Satan can't come to
[44:27] you and convince you this message isn't
[44:29] true you know the message is true but
[44:32] then what does it come down to it really
[44:35] becomes just trusting every day in
[44:38] Christ for
[44:41] everything every moment of every day
[44:45] living in such a way to where your life
[44:48] isn't your own
[44:49] anymore if if he told you to pack up
[44:53] everything you own and move to Hawaii
[44:57] or we'll make it not so pleasant move to
[45:00] Russia Hawaii many of you might want to
[45:02] go I mean who knows with the weather
[45:04] right now but but if you knew he told
[45:07] you but you're willing to do no matter
[45:09] what it takes to please him it's that
[45:14] simple but how many of us are in that
[45:16] spot where we could completely say we
[45:19] have completely trusted what God's doing
[45:22] in our life I believe most of us are at
[45:25] least a part way up that rock
[45:27] we're on a road but see everything has
[45:31] to be taken care of
[45:33] everything whether it be your family
[45:36] situations and to those I say just like
[45:38] Martha even now God's able to save your
[45:42] family God's able to give you the Holy
[45:45] Ghost even now God's able to heal you
[45:49] when it seems like everything's
[45:52] lost even now he's able to comfort you
[45:56] amen when you feel lonely when you feel
[45:59] like there's no one that cares there's
[46:01] always one that cares
[46:03] amen and I'm often I often get struck in
[46:07] my heart let's stand I'm not going to
[46:08] hold you any longer I want to keep it
[46:10] short I find lately that the Lord has
[46:12] just blessed me to try and keep things
[46:13] short that way it'll stick like they say
[46:16] short and
[46:19] sweet but you know I'm struck in my
[46:22] heart many times when I find myself
[46:24] leaning on anything that's not of God
[46:28] whether I mean it could be it doesn't
[46:29] even have to be anything sinful if you I
[46:31] mean it becomes sinful when you lean on
[46:32] that instead of God but in and of itself
[46:34] it's not for example you know it so
[46:37] listening to music can become something
[46:41] that could become a stumbling block
[46:43] because when God calls you to prayer you
[46:45] just go listen to some music because it
[46:46] soothes you it does this it could be
[46:48] something it seems so simple but you got
[46:51] to be able to hear the voice of God for
[46:52] yourself and you know when he's calling
[46:55] you I I love the way see I use brother
[46:57] Brooks's little quotes a lot because he
[46:58] says it in such a way it's so simple and
[47:00] I love it because it hits me at least
[47:02] I'm a simple guy and I think about it he
[47:04] said he said it don't even make sense
[47:06] you know something calls you to prayer
[47:08] and you're not sure if it's God you
[47:09] think the devil is going to call you to
[47:11] prayer you know things like that it's so
[47:13] simple but then we just ignore it but it
[47:15] always strikes my heart because I think
[47:17] I think about the Lord I say Lord you
[47:19] ought to be enough for
[47:21] me I I should not now this isn't against
[47:24] anybody here but I shouldn't need any of
[47:26] you you when I say it in this sense in
[47:28] in a carnal sense I we need each other
[47:31] don't get me wrong but when it comes
[47:33] down to your life I shouldn't need
[47:37] anything else but Jesus Christ amen now
[47:39] Jesus Christ is in you and he works
[47:41] through each one of you so we need each
[47:43] other in that sense but when I'm talking
[47:45] about if my and I preach this before
[47:47] here I if in my life I get a downtime
[47:50] and I'm feeling and I'm struggling or
[47:52] whatever and every time I get down I
[47:54] pick up the phone to call brother Keith
[47:56] I got a problem
[47:58] there's nothing wrong with brother Keith
[48:00] brother Keith's not the problem it's
[48:01] because I'm leaning on something else
[48:04] now there may be times when calling him
[48:06] would be the action the Lord wants me to
[48:08] take but if all it become it comes a
[48:10] habit that I need to call this brother I
[48:12] need to do this or I need to do that
[48:14] instead of seeking first the Lord Jesus
[48:17] something's wrong and that's what I'm
[48:19] here to tell us right now there is
[48:21] something this isn't to condemn anybody
[48:24] this is to make you know though that the
[48:26] power of God is here amen but if it's
[48:29] not being expressed the way each one of
[48:32] us know this is not all there is to it
[48:34] right there there's not all this this is
[48:36] not all there is to the Holy Ghost in
[48:39] This Hour this is supposed to be a bride
[48:41] age when this bride expresses a word so
[48:44] powerful that the world can't hold it so
[48:47] God just takes her away that's the power
[48:50] that's in the church right now in the
[48:51] bride of Christ but if it's not being
[48:53] expressed there's something wrong
[48:57] it's that simple because the word's
[48:59] right you say oh brother it's not going
[49:02] to happen till this specific time well
[49:03] you know if that's the case then we got
[49:06] to be crying out to God to get
[49:07] everything fixed so we're ready for that
[49:09] time I don't care what it is but if the
[49:12] power of God is not but here's the
[49:14] problem if God could express that kind
[49:16] of a Ministry through one man supposedly
[49:19] before the time as many people say well
[49:21] we just got to wait till the squeeze it
[49:23] the the the time's not right yet well
[49:25] then how could brother brandham do it
[49:28] answer me that qu how could brother
[49:29] Brandon oh he was a prophet the same God
[49:31] that lived in him lives in you amen I am
[49:35] so that that blows a lot of people's
[49:37] minds but it's true amen and if you if
[49:40] we as a whole are not living the kind of
[49:43] life that this word says we can live
[49:46] then there's something wrong and it's
[49:48] not with the word and it's not with the
[49:50] Christ in you because the Christ in you
[49:52] is this word it's perfect but there's
[49:55] something wrong whether it's a condition
[49:56] of the people whether it whether the
[49:59] time if it's not the time then God help
[50:01] us to know that it's
[50:03] not because I don't believe he'll hold
[50:05] that from us if if if he says it's not
[50:07] the time yet then at least we can have
[50:09] comfort in that but why is everybody
[50:11] struggling why is everybody crying out
[50:14] and not seeing what they need to see
[50:16] that's not my God cuz he's the same
[50:18] yesterday today and forever he's the
[50:20] same deliverer now as he was in brother
[50:23] brandom's
[50:25] day great than this shall ye de before I
[50:27] go under my father where's the
[50:30] greater that's my question where's the
[50:33] greater this isn't to condemn anybody
[50:35] this all we ought to be hungering for
[50:37] this stuff we got to have the power of
[50:40] God we have to have a Deliverance power
[50:44] and it's for you it's not just for
[50:47] brother brand it's not just for the
[50:48] brother Brooks it's not for me or
[50:50] brother Troy or whoever else it is it's
[50:52] for you amen you read the messages and
[50:56] watch how many many times brother
[50:57] brandham has to tell the people this
[50:58] brother's hands are just as good as mine
[51:01] he's filled with the Holy Ghost just
[51:02] like I am God hears his prayers just
[51:04] like he hears me yes brother brandham
[51:06] had a greater Ministry in that sense but
[51:08] that's because he had a purpose to
[51:09] fulfill the bride also has a purpose to
[51:12] fulfill and it's to show that the same
[51:15] God that lived in that man lives in
[51:21] you when Elisha came to the River Jordan
[51:24] after Elijah went up he did he held that
[51:27] mantle we're holding this mantle this
[51:31] word that our Prophet gave to us that
[51:36] Elijah dropped back to us when he left
[51:39] he left this word he may have left but
[51:41] the mantle that he carried this word
[51:44] remains amen now when elishah went up to
[51:47] Jordan he didn't say where be
[51:51] Elijah he didn't say where be the
[51:53] ministry of Elijah because that's what
[51:56] so many people are still looking for
[51:57] that they want Elijah to come back but I
[51:59] want to be like Elisha was where be the
[52:03] Goden of Elijah where is that power that
[52:08] I saw in that Prophet amen cuz he knew
[52:12] it was for him he was given the promise
[52:15] we were given the promise we've got it
[52:19] that's my question where be the god of
[52:20] Elijah he's
[52:22] here it's time to let him
[52:24] work it's time to cast aside your ideas
[52:28] it's time to cast aside your thoughts
[52:31] it's time to cast aside your
[52:34] desires amen because if your desires are
[52:36] his desires then they're
[52:38] satanic that's hard that sounds harsh
[52:41] it's the truth anything against the word
[52:43] is satanic anything against the desires
[52:45] of God so you better know where you
[52:47] stand and go with that we know where we
[52:50] stand we got the word we have that
[52:52] mantle it's time to use it and the other
[52:54] thing is it wasn't something
[52:57] that people didn't know about either now
[53:00] remember it's not going to be an open
[53:01] show that the world will see even if it
[53:04] was the world wouldn't see it because
[53:05] the media wouldn't do it
[53:06] anyway you know what I'm saying there
[53:08] could be Miracles going on here and
[53:10] there ain't no CNN MSNBC ABC CBS FOX
[53:13] News going to show up here and and and
[53:15] preach about how how amazing a miracle
[53:17] was done here that going to happen it'll
[53:20] be done in a
[53:21] corner to the world but that doesn't
[53:24] mean people aren't going to know the god
[53:25] of Israel is here everybody wants to
[53:28] think it's going to be some underground
[53:29] thing no no people that were around
[53:32] Jesus knew who he was and they knew the
[53:35] power was there it was just a secret
[53:36] from The World At Large because I tell
[53:39] you what the first thing that school of
[53:41] prophets said when Elisha came across
[53:43] the Jordan was surely the spirit of
[53:46] Elijah doth rest on
[53:49] Elisha it'll be
[53:51] known amongst the people that are around
[53:53] it at
[53:54] least the world that large I mean
[53:57] whether whether Obama knows about it or
[53:59] or whoever is a anchor at one of the
[54:01] news stations knows about it I you know
[54:03] that's fine by them but the people that
[54:05] are that are going to see it they're
[54:06] going to know because there's there's
[54:08] more to this brothers and sisters
[54:10] there's more to this and it's going to
[54:12] be unlocked by this people it's going to
[54:14] happen and I believe everybody here is
[54:16] going to experience it it's just it's
[54:18] just High time we got like one more
[54:20] scripture if I could I just going to
[54:21] I'll just say it for you you can look I
[54:23] believe it's in Proverbs 20 because this
[54:25] is what we got come to we got to prepare
[54:27] our fields to receive this word I said
[54:29] your condition of of your field your
[54:31] mind your attitude towards this word
[54:33] that's being preached determines what
[54:34] kind of crop you're going to reap from
[54:36] it it's not about me that's preaching or
[54:38] trying to get some great effect it's
[54:39] about what God's trying to tell you and
[54:41] what it can get if your field if that
[54:44] attitude hadn't been right how would you
[54:45] be saved right now but he came in a
[54:47] season when your field was right for the
[54:50] plant and that's the way it's got to be
[54:52] every time you got to be constantly
[54:54] plowing that field that's why he said
[54:55] break up your fow ground but right now
[54:57] it's a cold time it's a really chilly
[54:59] time in the world physical and and
[55:01] spiritual it's a cold time people don't
[55:04] want to hear this but the scripture says
[55:06] in Proverbs 20 it says said the sluggard
[55:08] will not plow his field by reason of the
[55:12] cold that's the way a lot of people are
[55:14] right now right it's so cold out there
[55:16] people just about giving up they don't
[55:17] want to deal with it because they don't
[55:19] want to deal with rejection they don't
[55:21] want to deal with how hard it is to pray
[55:22] through now but the Slugger and it says
[55:25] it says when when Harvest I'm just
[55:27] paraphrasing what it says when Harvest
[55:28] time comes he's going to have nothing to
[55:29] show for
[55:30] it and that's what you're seeing a lot
[55:32] of people right now it's so cold but you
[55:34] got to plow right through you just got
[55:36] to keep plowing and you if you don't
[55:38] faint you're going to reap a harvest and
[55:40] it's going to be you don't even you we
[55:41] can't even fa them what I tell you what
[55:43] he's talking about limbs being restored
[55:46] you know he's talking about dead being
[55:48] raised you know it's not about just
[55:50] those things that we looking for but
[55:51] that's part of the
[55:53] package right that's part of the pack I
[55:55] want the whole package I don't want the
[55:58] devil to be holding back any of my goods
[56:01] in layway it's all mine every promise in
[56:05] the book is mine amen and I want all of
[56:07] it amen and see the thing is I was just
[56:10] thinking about that in the back there I
[56:11] was reading about D I'll sorry to keep
[56:12] your standing we'll pray here just a
[56:13] second but I was thinking about
[56:15] David and how when David was crazy
[56:18] enough he had the audacity to believe
[56:21] that God would stand for Israel against
[56:23] Goliath his brothers got angry
[56:26] and you know what they thought about
[56:27] David they thought he was
[56:29] cocky they thought he was trying to make
[56:32] himself
[56:33] something and that's what happens to the
[56:35] people of
[56:37] God all of a sudden you see a person a
[56:39] brother or sister come in and and
[56:41] exclaim before the people how God's done
[56:44] this in their life trying like David was
[56:47] to Rally the people of God trying to get
[56:49] the people of God to see that God was
[56:51] with them and what do their brothers do
[56:53] what your brothers sisters do stand back
[56:55] you're just trying to you're just I know
[56:56] the naughtiness of your heart like like
[56:58] they told DAV I know the naughtiness of
[57:00] your heart you're just trying to stir
[57:02] stuff up you're just trying to make
[57:03] yourself some big thing no that's not it
[57:06] we're trying to Rally the people of God
[57:07] around this thing it's going to happen
[57:10] these things are so simple but it's the
[57:12] foundations that we're missing right now
[57:16] because these Miracles the Miracles the
[57:19] the the the power of God those are those
[57:23] are the foundational
[57:25] things
[57:27] if that some people that's hard to
[57:28] believe because it doesn't seem like we
[57:29] see any of it like we ought to but
[57:31] believe it or not those are the
[57:32] foundational things those are the things
[57:35] that are just kind of those are the
[57:36] things that ought to be just not to say
[57:39] in a bad way but they ought to be a
[57:40] common occurrence that's the foundation
[57:43] and then come the teaching and the
[57:46] maturity and the bringing forth but
[57:48] there the foundational things ought to
[57:49] be laid speaking in tongues raising the
[57:52] dead Healing The Sick all the the power
[57:54] of God dancing the spirit those things
[57:55] are to regular
[57:57] occurrences and then from there what
[57:59] does the word do the word comes to form
[58:01] and shape those things to put them in
[58:03] their proper
[58:04] places but I you know and this ain't
[58:06] trying to say anything bad to anybody
[58:08] but we got to have the foundation laid
[58:10] before we can go higher everybody wants
[58:12] the big Mysteries to bring us to a
[58:13] manifestation of the sons of God and we
[58:15] don't even have the foundation laid the
[58:17] way it ought to be CU if it were we'd be
[58:19] seeing these things because the word
[58:21] declares it to be so that's not a
[58:23] question that's the word you can take it
[58:26] up with acts if you want to talk about
[58:29] it because there ain't no real church
[58:31] but the acts Church bringing it back and
[58:34] then we're going past that but until we
[58:36] get there how can we move past that
[58:38] until we get to
[58:40] it people talking about being Beyond
[58:42] Pentecost and they haven't even gotten
[58:43] to Pentecost yet we got to get to it
[58:46] before we can go beyond it amen I'm not
[58:49] trying to be harsh I I feel encouraged
[58:51] because one thing I know is that God's
[58:53] true I've experienced it I've struggled
[58:56] went through my valleys everyone here
[58:57] has been through your valleys you've
[58:59] been I think about brother Keith and how
[59:00] one instant with his brother the Lord
[59:02] came to him and and brought him to a
[59:03] place of repentance with God it could
[59:05] take something like you just don't know
[59:07] what it's going to take but God's
[59:10] faithful I I've told you this I had to
[59:12] spend four years in Denver wallowing in
[59:14] my misery before God woke me up to some
[59:16] realities but you know what I wouldn't
[59:18] trade it for anything and I don't think
[59:20] Moses would trade 40 years in the
[59:22] wilderness and 40 years in Egypt for
[59:24] anything after he saw the power of God
[59:26] work in his life I it doesn't matter as
[59:29] long as you get there just hold on to it
[59:32] you're going to go through trials that's
[59:33] a
[59:34] promise he that liveth Godly shall
[59:36] suffer persecution that's a promise just
[59:38] don't be discouraged by it amen let's
[59:40] bow our heads in a word of prayer dear
