[38:41] [Music]
[38:51] hallelujah
[38:53] as we stand we get right into the word
[38:55] of god
[38:56] i didn't know i was going to sing but i
[38:58] just felt like it
[39:00] i think my brother put me in that mold
[39:04] when he started singing into the chamber
[39:08] i love that song and
[39:10] there's one sister who can sing it
[39:12] that's sister marilyn brown and
[39:15] she's about 90 something years old might
[39:17] be 100 now
[39:19] but she's got a voice like a canary
[39:23] and she sings the whole thing
[39:25] and she takes me from earth to glory
[39:28] that's all i can say
[39:30] and i know when i get to heaven and
[39:32] she's there by god's grace i know she
[39:34] will
[39:35] be there brother brandon even told her
[39:37] that he saw her walking the streets of
[39:39] gold
[39:40] what an assurance
[39:43] so i'm trusting when she get there she
[39:44] at least do me one song
[39:48] god is good to us
[39:50] and we are blessed people
[39:53] the bible says there's no condemnation
[39:57] to those who walk not after the flesh
[39:58] but after the spirit
[40:01] i can't tell you and i keep referring
[40:04] back to brother ben's message how god
[40:06] knows our weaknesses and how he cares
[40:09] that was a turning point for me and
[40:12] and ever since then i have been floating
[40:15] i've been just really
[40:17] happy in jesus
[40:20] throughout the day i have my trials like
[40:22] everybody else but i have a peace there
[40:25] is no fear
[40:28] that god is going to punish me or throw
[40:30] me away or reject me
[40:33] he loves us
[40:35] and he cares for us
[40:37] as we turn let us turn to colossians
[40:41] 2.
[40:43] we'll begin to read there we're trying
[40:44] not to be long by god's grace we know we
[40:47] spent a little time in singing
[40:49] glad to have everybody here tonight
[40:56] when it comes down to
[40:58] god doing great things
[41:04] um i don't know how to say it but uh
[41:09] i know that he he's he's faithful
[41:14] and
[41:15] i depend on him
[41:18] for everything
[41:20] knowing that he lives in me you know we
[41:22] we've always said it we've always quoted
[41:25] it you know with the tabernacle of god
[41:27] and the housing of god and god dwells in
[41:30] us but it's another thing when you begin
[41:31] to recognize it and i address him
[41:35] in the way he would want to be addressed
[41:38] because a king is a king
[41:40] and he doesn't want you to look at the
[41:43] audience and say o king
[41:45] he wants you to look at him and say o
[41:48] king
[41:49] and so in order for you to do that
[41:51] you've got to know where the throne room
[41:53] is
[41:54] and the throne room is within your heart
[41:57] excuse me
[42:05] and when you see and understand it it
[42:06] feels a little funny at first
[42:09] but after a while it becomes a reality
[42:16] i'm not prone to different things but
[42:19] i from that point on i've been seeing
[42:22] something
[42:23] that i cannot explain
[42:25] moving on the inside of me
[42:29] and i'm glad that god has been merciful
[42:31] to me
[42:32] i trust that god will be merciful to all
[42:34] of us
[42:35] we're we're trying and not just trying
[42:37] but we're moving toward the translation
[42:41] you know let us not stumble at his
[42:43] coming or how he's going to come and
[42:45] when he's going to come and
[42:47] we know that something has taken place
[42:50] and what has taken place will connect us
[42:54] in a way that he himself will interpret
[42:58] you understand what i'm saying
[43:00] and and that's what i'm looking at
[43:02] i'm not saying he's not coming i'm not
[43:04] saying you know there's not another
[43:05] event but i do know one thing that this
[43:08] event
[43:09] leads to the next
[43:11] and i want to be in order for us to be a
[43:13] part of the next event we must be a part
[43:15] of this one
[43:18] it's so easy to miss him
[43:20] because god always reveals himself in
[43:22] such a simple way
[43:23] to most of the people misses him you
[43:26] know and i don't want to miss him
[43:28] it's just i'll say it like this we've
[43:29] been in this message so long and
[43:32] let me read the scripture and let you
[43:33] sit down sorry
[43:35] colossians two beginning at the ninth
[43:37] verse
[43:38] it may sound like i'm being critical i
[43:40] am not
[43:41] i'm just saying i have been a part of
[43:44] things that i won't i want to
[43:47] uh
[43:49] and god is freeing me
[43:51] uh from the system
[43:54] or systematic worship
[43:57] colossians 2
[43:59] 9-10 says for in him dwell is
[44:03] all the fullness of the godhead
[44:06] bodily now do we understand that
[44:10] all
[44:11] all authority
[44:13] uh
[44:14] the prophet god said
[44:16] david was christ
[44:18] moses was christ
[44:20] abraham was christ
[44:22] and he says all of the fullness
[44:26] all that they were were compiled and put
[44:29] into one body
[44:30] and that was jesus christ
[44:34] and if that be the truth that means
[44:36] the bride
[44:38] is part
[44:40] of that godhead
[44:42] because she is a part of christ
[44:47] and ye are complete is that what he just
[44:49] said
[44:50] and you are complete in him
[44:53] which is the head of all principalities
[44:56] and power
[44:58] let us pray
[45:00] dear heavenly father god we come before
[45:02] you lord and we thank you for your grace
[45:04] and your mercy
[45:05] we thank you for being so good to us
[45:07] lord and
[45:08] we thank you lord for all that you have
[45:10] done for us
[45:12] you have done so many things
[45:14] and words cannot express
[45:16] our gratitude in your lovely name we
[45:19] thank you lord jesus christ we pray amen
[45:22] you may be seated
[45:27] when you think about the godhead it let
[45:29] me let me say like this
[45:31] it was the roman catholic church
[45:34] that divided the godhead into three
[45:36] persons
[45:38] up until then
[45:40] the godhead was one
[45:42] and that was the lord jesus christ
[45:46] whether we want to recognize it or not
[45:48] paul never wrote a sign on his back and
[45:51] says listen i'm part of the godhead
[45:55] because we must understand what godhead
[45:57] means
[45:58] it means divine nature
[46:01] it means the essence of the nature of
[46:03] god
[46:05] in the individual
[46:07] and paul said listen it's not i but
[46:10] christ
[46:11] that live in me so paul wasn't giving
[46:13] him his flesh any
[46:15] honor or glory but he was definitely
[46:18] telling you that the christ
[46:20] that died and that was crucified and
[46:22] that created all things is now the one
[46:25] who's living in my tabernacle
[46:29] see the nature of god when the nature of
[46:31] god is existing
[46:33] in a person it places him
[46:36] in the godhead because it's not the
[46:38] person is god in the man
[46:41] god was in christ
[46:44] god is in his bride y'all get it
[46:47] so a lot of time when you start talking
[46:49] about godhead many of us want to go back
[46:50] to the trinitarian way of looking at it
[46:53] and that's
[46:54] wrong that's wrong
[46:59] when paul talked about the godhead this
[47:01] is what he said
[47:02] that the fullness
[47:04] of the godhead dwelt in him
[47:08] is that right
[47:09] and brother branham comes along and
[47:11] tells us that we were with him
[47:13] before the world began we were with him
[47:15] we was in him we was his thoughts we as
[47:17] his attributes and now we come in this
[47:20] day to prove that we were amen
[47:23] and how you prove that is not you
[47:25] proving it it's god proving it through
[47:27] you by anointing you
[47:30] and accepting you
[47:33] i read the quote last week
[47:35] or sunday when i read this i talked
[47:37] about stephen
[47:39] and steven didn't do any great miracles
[47:42] but he did something that was phenomenal
[47:45] in the sense that he had such a life
[47:48] that it literally made those who did not
[47:51] have the life hate him
[47:53] and they stoned stephen but watch the
[47:56] christ that comes out of him
[47:59] the same almost identical words that
[48:02] jesus said on the cross father forgive
[48:04] them for they know not what they do
[48:06] others out of the vessel
[48:09] of stephen and says lord hold these
[48:11] things not to their charge see christ
[48:14] under the same pressure reacts in the
[48:17] same way
[48:19] and so you and i must understand that we
[48:21] can never make it to heaven in religion
[48:24] or with religion
[48:26] these are the things that jesus tried to
[48:28] explain to the pharisees and the
[48:29] sadducees of his day the religious
[48:32] so-called christians in their day
[48:33] because they were so interested in the
[48:35] systematic way of worshiping cleaning
[48:38] the cup
[48:39] or cleaning or washing the outside and
[48:41] leaving the inside filthy
[48:44] and jesus said no no no it's the inside
[48:47] out as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[48:50] he
[48:51] so we know how god is bringing us to a
[48:54] place
[48:55] and listen you're groaning don't think
[48:58] that you know you're groaning at
[49:00] something bad it's really good
[49:02] it's an excellent thing to thirst for
[49:05] righteousness it's an excellent thing to
[49:07] groan to be holy or to be righteous no
[49:10] matter how many times you fail no many
[49:12] times you fall amen there's something in
[49:15] you that's saying lord i want to be
[49:17] better do you understand what that is
[49:20] that's eternal life that's not a devil
[49:23] in you
[49:23] that's god in you that seed has been
[49:26] quickened in you
[49:29] this is where i believe the
[49:31] a lot of believers have misunderstood
[49:34] the message for their day
[49:36] uh
[49:37] because we fail to see that we must meet
[49:40] the criterias of this age
[49:42] and the age of this the the criteria of
[49:45] this age is divine love is to receive
[49:47] the capstone
[49:49] and you know this is what paul said we
[49:51] prophesy in part we we knew in part we
[49:54] prophesy in part but when that which is
[49:56] perfect it's come showing that god would
[49:58] bring a word that would bring us to
[50:00] perfection
[50:02] remember i read the quote the other day
[50:04] and i could read it to you now but i'm
[50:05] i'm pressed for time where brother
[50:07] branham said he he was not the one
[50:09] who who would forerun the coming of the
[50:12] lord
[50:13] he said but it was his message that
[50:15] would forerun the coming now i want you
[50:17] to think about that meditate on what
[50:19] he's saying
[50:20] because the message must live
[50:22] the message is not words on a page
[50:26] you understand me the message itself
[50:28] must live and brother adam said the
[50:31] message and the messenger is one they
[50:33] are one and so you saw what is the
[50:35] message that literally foreruns the
[50:38] coming of christ it comes in the form of
[50:40] the bride it comes in the form of
[50:42] rebecca
[50:43] because when eliezer stepped off the
[50:45] scene rebecca stepped on
[50:47] you understand me and she was the one
[50:50] who met isaac oh come on somebody so you
[50:53] must understand amen the message that
[50:55] four runs
[50:57] amen uh comes after uh
[51:00] malachi 4 is the bride of jesus christ
[51:03] she becomes the message like elijah to
[51:06] elisha you understand me see and this is
[51:10] where we
[51:11] we may have had it in our heads
[51:13] but unless you understand where you are
[51:16] in your position
[51:17] you'll miss it
[51:19] we have such a lack of understanding
[51:22] amongst the believers we believe that if
[51:23] we believe in a prophet if we believe
[51:25] and and i say these things because
[51:27] i have to say them
[51:29] and i'm not trying to cause
[51:31] controversies
[51:32] but my truth the truth shall make us
[51:34] free
[51:36] we're not to be like parrots and just
[51:37] say what brother branham say we must
[51:39] have the revelation of it see the
[51:42] message in itself is on books and tapes
[51:44] anybody can get it anybody can read it
[51:46] and you can see what people have done
[51:48] with it because they lack understanding
[51:51] of what it was being said you can see
[51:53] the camps that have been formed
[51:55] under the same message that we say we
[51:58] read in here but it's a lack of
[52:00] understanding this is not a time to
[52:03] fight
[52:05] no sir this is not a time to fight
[52:08] this is a time to grow
[52:11] this is a time that god has allotted for
[52:13] the bride of jesus christ to mature
[52:16] right remember god rebuked galatians
[52:19] says you you can't know
[52:21] because you're fussing and fighting what
[52:23] does this dispute come that's among you
[52:26] so your children
[52:28] and when you see people fighting in the
[52:30] message over doctrines and things like
[52:32] that they do not understand what this
[52:35] message has come for
[52:38] we lead that over to laodicea to do that
[52:42] but when we come into this message we
[52:44] come into a complete true brotherhood
[52:48] and brotherhood comes by baptism
[52:51] of the holy spirit we are baptized into
[52:54] one body by one spirit
[52:57] hallelujah i'm feeling pretty good
[52:59] tonight
[53:00] coming from the message easter seal look
[53:02] what brother says
[53:04] but he that understandeth
[53:06] he that knoweth his place in this hour
[53:10] he that heareth my word and believe on
[53:13] him that sent me half present ten
[53:16] eternal life
[53:19] when you understand your position and
[53:22] your place in this hour it's not oh i'm
[53:24] brian everybody can say that
[53:27] because everybody is saying that
[53:31] but to know your position
[53:33] would to be like esther
[53:35] to know that you're able to bring
[53:37] changes
[53:39] you're not just a figurehead but you're
[53:42] married to the king
[53:45] and the authority in which he has he has
[53:48] given unto you see that's what we must
[53:51] understand listen aren't you tired
[53:54] i said this the other day god is not in
[53:57] this deadness that we call message
[54:03] god is fire
[54:05] and he never took away the power of the
[54:08] holy ghost listen to the message east
[54:11] cecile brother brown said no no no don't
[54:13] you ever forget it we need the holy
[54:16] ghost and without the holy ghost you'll
[54:19] not make a rapture
[54:20] it's not it doesn't matter how much you
[54:23] have in your head
[54:25] is what you have in your soul what's
[54:28] radiating
[54:29] from your soul what's
[54:31] preaching and constantly controlling you
[54:34] it is your control power
[54:36] it is the things when you go get ready
[54:38] to do wrong it says don't do it
[54:41] it is the thing that when you when
[54:43] you're not certain of things it puts
[54:45] that funny feeling over you
[54:47] and the prophet god said whenever that
[54:48] comes whenever there's a little ounce of
[54:50] doubt he says when you want to do
[54:52] something he says don't do it
[54:55] because he the holy ghost is a sure
[54:57] voice it's a clean voice it's a voice
[55:00] that will uh tell you exactly what you
[55:02] need to do
[55:04] so you and i must understand he said he
[55:06] that understand he that understandeth
[55:08] his place when i saw this about shouting
[55:11] i i i tell you what i'm like there it is
[55:17] understanding your place
[55:20] but we got so many people looking back
[55:22] and we're working with brother
[55:23] brandlyn's place it ain't his place
[55:26] anymore
[55:27] it's the bride's position
[55:30] and people get upset let them get upset
[55:33] they got to get upset
[55:35] i wish i could say it rough enough for
[55:37] them to really think about what i'm
[55:39] saying because the truth of the matter
[55:41] is you got to move forward
[55:45] you can't stay where you
[55:47] look at what they've done and i don't
[55:49] want to call no names
[55:51] but now people are having revivals
[55:53] jumping and shouting and running and
[55:54] everything else just like the
[55:56] pentecostals
[55:58] casting out devils all that's good
[56:01] but jesus said don't rejoice in those
[56:03] things
[56:04] rejoice because your name is written
[56:09] and i'm not saying anything is wrong
[56:10] with those things we need those things
[56:13] this listen they pretty much put us to
[56:15] shame
[56:16] because we say we're the bride and where
[56:18] is it
[56:21] one thing we do know
[56:23] brother branham said the same anointing
[56:25] that anoints the wheat anoints the tear
[56:29] and he said in the parable he said they
[56:31] both praise god so something's wrong
[56:36] the anointing that comes with the word
[56:39] is supposed to strike you to an
[56:40] excitement
[56:44] this is not a classroom
[56:47] this is where god meets us
[56:50] as a church and there is liberty here
[56:53] but we've been so confined by doctrines
[56:57] and whatever you want to call it
[57:00] church order
[57:03] and and you'll find out that
[57:05] brother branham never instituted a lot
[57:07] of that stuff
[57:08] it was men who came after him
[57:10] that made books
[57:13] that bind us back up again
[57:19] do i know what i'm talking about
[57:21] absolutely i do
[57:24] and that's why people can't do they
[57:25] can't love each other they got so many
[57:27] laws you can't do this you can't do this
[57:29] you can't do this you can't do that and
[57:31] folks i think about jesus christ he he
[57:33] was he was under the same pressure
[57:36] you're going to let that woman wash your
[57:38] feet
[57:40] are you going to hang out with the
[57:41] publicans and sinners
[57:46] you see what i'm saying
[57:48] and that's what happens you can't even
[57:49] you can't even have or try to witness to
[57:52] somebody who's not a believer because
[57:54] somebody's going to think evil of you
[57:58] what nonsense is that
[58:01] let's move on
[58:03] am i right or wrong
[58:10] glory to god ain't god good let me
[58:12] finish this quote
[58:13] my word and
[58:15] and you know he he that heareth my word
[58:17] and believeth on him that sent me half
[58:20] president eternal life shall not come
[58:22] into the judgment but has already passed
[58:25] from death unto life
[58:26] then when this new eternal life dwells
[58:29] in you it is the potential of the
[58:32] earnestness of you being quickened from
[58:35] mortal to immortality
[58:38] what is he saying
[58:39] basically you're already in it
[58:42] it's already quicken you from death into
[58:44] life
[58:45] and once you come into life you can't
[58:46] die no more
[58:48] because it is his life
[58:50] and not yours
[58:52] but we don't see what we supposed to be
[58:54] doing the truth of the matter is we're
[58:56] supposed to be dying and rotting to all
[58:58] of our thoughts and ideas because i said
[59:01] last week amen when you let the eternal
[59:04] life push out the cosmic light
[59:07] the more the cosmic light which is this
[59:09] worldly
[59:11] light that that you were born with if
[59:13] the eternal light pushes uh this cosmic
[59:16] light out of you guess what happened you
[59:19] become him
[59:22] everything about you become eternal
[59:23] except this flesh and then one day he's
[59:26] going to make that right
[59:28] but don't you want to be just like him
[59:30] amen i don't care what it takes you said
[59:33] what brother what are you saying yes i'm
[59:35] still struggling
[59:37] but i see little by little
[59:40] i'm conquering the land
[59:42] by his grace
[59:44] i am an overcomer
[59:48] let me say that again
[59:50] when the spirit has found you
[59:52] the individual and has come upon you you
[59:55] see
[59:56] it is the potential of your eternal
[59:58] inheritance that god thought of you and
[1:00:02] made for you
[1:00:03] and made for you before the foundation
[1:00:05] of the world
[1:00:06] this that is your potential and you know
[1:00:09] what i'm trying to say
[1:00:10] the foolish virgin had potential
[1:00:15] so potential is good
[1:00:17] but the seed must be quickened it must
[1:00:20] be fire
[1:00:21] you must in this last day have all and
[1:00:24] extra oil listen now since i've seen and
[1:00:27] i'm seeing i'm pushing i'm pressing and
[1:00:29] i'm praying more than anything else
[1:00:32] you say oh i don't see you on your knees
[1:00:34] you don't have to i am the temple
[1:00:40] i've tried to do what they want us to do
[1:00:42] and i i say these things and i'm trying
[1:00:44] to awake all of us i'm not trying trying
[1:00:46] to preach a new message i'm preaching
[1:00:48] what brother branham intended us for us
[1:00:50] to see
[1:00:51] it's a shame
[1:00:52] this is why he said there's going to be
[1:00:54] only a few that make a rapture
[1:00:56] because a few people are going to
[1:00:58] understand their position and what they
[1:01:00] need to do in this hour
[1:01:02] this is not about church this is not
[1:01:04] about fame this is not about fortune
[1:01:07] this is about christ
[1:01:08] coming into the very image and likeness
[1:01:10] of christ and we need to focus on that
[1:01:13] amen everything else will take its place
[1:01:17] everything
[1:01:20] but look how many years brother branham
[1:01:22] had gone and let me ask you something
[1:01:24] what has been the great change
[1:01:27] tell me
[1:01:29] do you know any great ones
[1:01:32] no
[1:01:33] because first of all there aren't any
[1:01:35] but i fee i hear now that people are
[1:01:36] calling each other great and all this
[1:01:38] kind is that nonsense
[1:01:42] and because a man has a great
[1:01:44] deliverance a preaching i can show you
[1:01:47] some pentecostal preaching that can put
[1:01:49] circles around us
[1:01:51] but listen
[1:01:53] where is the change
[1:01:56] this is the message from the shekinah
[1:01:58] glory
[1:01:59] so god in the glory is supposed to bring
[1:02:01] change
[1:02:02] without your helping
[1:02:06] your emphasis
[1:02:08] is useless
[1:02:09] in the shekinah glory
[1:02:12] all you got to do is the prophet of god
[1:02:14] said lay in the presence of the son let
[1:02:17] god
[1:02:18] bake all the greenery out of you what is
[1:02:20] that staying before the word
[1:02:23] staying in prayer
[1:02:25] fast or whatever you need to do but lay
[1:02:28] there don't move let god take it all out
[1:02:31] of you and once he takes it all out it's
[1:02:33] done
[1:02:36] when we thinking about bringing forth
[1:02:39] true life of christ
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:41] we ought to be because that's what the
[1:02:44] life is supposed to be
[1:02:46] brother brandon was no fake
[1:02:49] huh
[1:02:50] before he was converted
[1:02:52] he tried to kill a few boys
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:56] but once he was converted
[1:02:58] his life changed
[1:03:00] all you saw was christ
[1:03:02] you understand me
[1:03:04] so conversion brings a change a change
[1:03:07] of attitude a change of way of thinking
[1:03:11] behavior
[1:03:14] it does and then you know what it
[1:03:16] doesn't happen overnight
[1:03:19] that's the thing
[1:03:21] it takes time and that's what we don't
[1:03:23] have much of
[1:03:25] we do not have a lot of time
[1:03:28] if not now i ask a question to the
[1:03:31] audience if not now
[1:03:34] then when
[1:03:37] what are we waiting on
[1:03:39] we waiting on russia to bomb or we
[1:03:41] waiting you know we everybody when
[1:03:44] kamala wore the purple oh they got
[1:03:46] excited but there was no change
[1:03:49] nobody got on fire did they
[1:03:53] when they bombed 911 uh the the the
[1:03:55] towers up there no nobody got excited it
[1:03:58] was just an emotion for a moment
[1:04:02] and the things that we think gonna bring
[1:04:03] about a change will not
[1:04:05] historical events
[1:04:07] being made clear by prophecy will never
[1:04:10] cause you to repent
[1:04:13] you might get excited but that's not
[1:04:15] what's going to bring you to repentance
[1:04:16] is believing the word of god hearing the
[1:04:19] word of god and saying yes lord
[1:04:22] i'm the one in need of
[1:04:24] prayer that's where the prayer the
[1:04:27] change comes
[1:04:29] we're always placing it in the future
[1:04:32] it's coming it's coming it's here
[1:04:34] you think that god opened this beautiful
[1:04:37] word oh my god open this beautiful word
[1:04:40] amen and for us just to sit back and say
[1:04:43] oh praise god we're going to make a
[1:04:45] pentecostal church out of it
[1:04:49] because that's what we've done
[1:04:51] we don't call ourselves bishops
[1:04:54] or elders
[1:04:55] but we got a hierarchy in it
[1:04:59] don't tell me it's not true i know it's
[1:05:01] true
[1:05:02] i don't want to be part of none of that
[1:05:04] i'm not a part of any of that
[1:05:08] but that's what's going on and people
[1:05:10] are so blind they can't see it
[1:05:14] i remember the one time a church came uh
[1:05:16] one of the sisters in my church she and
[1:05:18] i said this before many times she said
[1:05:20] she got mad with me brother brooks
[1:05:24] why you why do you always have those
[1:05:26] no-name preachers
[1:05:29] preaching for you
[1:05:31] you know what i said
[1:05:34] it's the no-name preachers who can still
[1:05:36] hear from god
[1:05:39] it's the no-name preachers who come to
[1:05:41] preach and they're not in competition
[1:05:42] with nobody
[1:05:44] because they want to surrender to the
[1:05:45] voice of god
[1:05:48] and she never bothered me again
[1:05:50] but she didn't stay to my church she she
[1:05:52] moved
[1:05:53] to a named preacher
[1:05:55] and that name preacher did what
[1:05:58] backstage on the message don't even
[1:05:59] believe the message anymore
[1:06:01] you understand me what is a name
[1:06:05] there's only one name that's supposed to
[1:06:07] be exalted at this hour and that is the
[1:06:10] name of the lord jesus christ him only
[1:06:15] and when you do anything out other than
[1:06:17] that you're in idolatry you can
[1:06:20] literally worship yourself
[1:06:27] is this okay i know it sounds like i'm
[1:06:29] fussing but i don't mean to sound this
[1:06:31] way i'm saying we're we're moving into
[1:06:34] maturity
[1:06:36] we want to put away all the childish
[1:06:39] he see
[1:06:40] and all that and they did this to me 10
[1:06:42] years ago and i never forgave get off
[1:06:45] get off that horse that horse is running
[1:06:47] you straight to hell
[1:06:52] you this
[1:06:53] how can you say you're a christian and
[1:06:55] you can't forgive
[1:06:59] christians forgive
[1:07:01] why because christ won't let you have
[1:07:04] peace until you make it right
[1:07:09] no matter what comes your way i don't
[1:07:11] care if they slap you in your face you
[1:07:13] still got to forgive them
[1:07:17] oh i feel like shouting here
[1:07:20] you look at these people and and and
[1:07:23] this is what uh everything is getting
[1:07:25] you know people oh we're having revival
[1:07:27] revival revival and you understand what
[1:07:29] i'm saying they're having a good time
[1:07:33] i've been to a lot of those revivals
[1:07:35] they they have a good time but let me
[1:07:37] tell you something i've witnessed a real
[1:07:39] true revival when i lived in lima
[1:07:42] god brought people off the street
[1:07:44] everywhere and they were changed
[1:07:46] they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:07:48] and i didn't have to preach to them any
[1:07:51] clothesline religion
[1:07:54] god by the way of the holy ghost taught
[1:07:56] those people how to dress
[1:07:58] we had people come in with purple hair
[1:08:00] and jewel in their nose and tongue they
[1:08:02] had britches that were so wide
[1:08:04] one leg was about that wide
[1:08:08] i didn't have to say nothing i just kept
[1:08:10] preaching the anointing kept falling and
[1:08:13] god kept changing
[1:08:15] and they stand today
[1:08:19] so i know it's real
[1:08:21] i've seen god amen preaching and the
[1:08:23] holy ghost fall
[1:08:26] one brother we call him cookie the holy
[1:08:29] ghost fell on him that sunday i think it
[1:08:31] was uh and he he began to sing in in in
[1:08:34] the spirit and everything else and i
[1:08:36] think what two weeks
[1:08:37] or less more or less uh he went home to
[1:08:40] meet the lord
[1:08:42] 30 years old
[1:08:45] i saw god clean him up i went to his
[1:08:47] house he had his own bar with all kind
[1:08:48] of lick and wine and
[1:08:50] the next time i go about all of that was
[1:08:52] gone i never told him what to do
[1:08:55] the holy spirit
[1:08:58] see i've seen it
[1:09:02] nobody can't tell me it's not real it's
[1:09:04] real
[1:09:07] i'm not declaring i'm where i should be
[1:09:09] but i'm trying to say i'm moving forward
[1:09:11] and i'm telling everybody come follow
[1:09:13] with me because i'm following jesus
[1:09:16] christ
[1:09:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:18] forever
[1:09:21] don't let nobody take your liberty away
[1:09:23] from you you feel like shouting you feel
[1:09:25] like dancing speaking in tongues
[1:09:27] whatever the case may be
[1:09:30] we're so afraid to let go and let god
[1:09:33] criticism going to come they're going to
[1:09:34] call you holy roller they're going to
[1:09:36] call you crazy i'm at the world no i'm
[1:09:37] coming at the church
[1:09:39] i'm telling my people here
[1:09:44] i want to see people get cut loose i
[1:09:46] really do but anyway let me read this
[1:09:49] quote you love the lord
[1:09:51] now i want you to understand y'all
[1:09:52] remember brother bob when he came to
[1:09:54] preach and he talked about he used that
[1:09:56] quote where brother brown said that even
[1:09:57] when jesus was on was the pillar fire he
[1:10:00] danced before the father
[1:10:03] now i don't understand that
[1:10:05] how can he dance then and won't dance
[1:10:07] now
[1:10:10] and people say oh you in your flesh what
[1:10:13] else i'm gonna be in
[1:10:19] hallelujah i'm going to shout in this
[1:10:20] flesh i'm going to dance in this flesh
[1:10:22] i'm going to pray in this flesh i'm in
[1:10:24] the flesh
[1:10:29] that's what he made me right
[1:10:31] now listen let's move on
[1:10:33] listen coming from the message easter
[1:10:35] seal he says there's only one life i
[1:10:38] want you to really hear what's being
[1:10:40] said
[1:10:40] there's only one life
[1:10:43] one eternal spirit
[1:10:46] one eternal life
[1:10:48] and that's god
[1:10:50] god alone is the eternal
[1:10:53] and then we
[1:10:54] being his children we are part of him
[1:10:58] that is the attributes of his thinking
[1:11:02] and the thought is expressed and become
[1:11:04] a word and this is what i love about it
[1:11:06] people that ain't that we've got to go
[1:11:08] lay hands on the sick everywhere and
[1:11:09] people got to go heal and heal the blind
[1:11:11] but his character
[1:11:13] that's what he said about stephen he had
[1:11:15] such a character he did no miracles but
[1:11:19] he himself was a miracle
[1:11:24] you know it shouldn't be where we got to
[1:11:25] wear a cross or or we're from a church
[1:11:27] here that draws and attract people it's
[1:11:30] supposed to be the character
[1:11:32] how many of you have drawn witches to
[1:11:34] you
[1:11:37] they come and they tell you they look at
[1:11:40] you and
[1:11:41] they know you
[1:11:43] hey that ain't you
[1:11:45] that's christ in you
[1:11:47] the light they see is not your light is
[1:11:50] eternal life
[1:11:54] and we've had that experience my wife
[1:11:56] and i
[1:11:59] but you know what
[1:12:01] i had a friend of an associate come to
[1:12:04] me i helped him in some things and
[1:12:07] you know what he said to me i'm coming
[1:12:08] to your church
[1:12:10] he said that to me today
[1:12:12] he said i believe god put me to get me
[1:12:15] together with you
[1:12:17] for more than one reason
[1:12:19] and i'm coming to your church he said i
[1:12:21] was raised catholic
[1:12:23] he said do i have to confess to you i
[1:12:25] say no
[1:12:27] and i told him what he needed to do he
[1:12:29] said oh i like it that way
[1:12:32] something is drawing him i didn't invite
[1:12:35] him to church
[1:12:37] he invited himself
[1:12:40] see that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:12:41] it's supposed to be something like a
[1:12:43] magnet people begin to see things in you
[1:12:46] you don't even know they're seeing it
[1:12:48] people are attracted to you you don't
[1:12:50] even know why but it's the christ in you
[1:12:52] it's not because they think you look so
[1:12:54] good
[1:13:00] you understand me
[1:13:04] and then we being his children we are
[1:13:06] part of him that is the attribute of his
[1:13:09] thinking and the thought is expressed
[1:13:11] and become a word then each individual
[1:13:14] in here that possesses this eternal life
[1:13:17] was before the foundation of the world
[1:13:21] in god's thinking you know there was a
[1:13:23] time when you would read this people
[1:13:24] would shout
[1:13:26] they were like
[1:13:27] hallelujah but what has happened is it's
[1:13:30] become an intellectual concept
[1:13:32] it's not even here yet
[1:13:35] because the word's supposed to bring you
[1:13:36] joy no matter where and when and how
[1:13:40] hallelujah i'm not going to be long
[1:13:43] i'm almost
[1:13:44] done the thought is expressed to become
[1:13:47] a word then each individual in here that
[1:13:50] possesses this eternal life
[1:13:53] was before the foundation of the world
[1:13:55] in god's thinking now i'm going to put
[1:13:58] every one of you on
[1:14:01] in a position
[1:14:02] how many of you believe
[1:14:04] that you are sons
[1:14:06] and daughters of a daughter of god
[1:14:11] raise your hand
[1:14:16] see what you know there's a point for me
[1:14:17] doing that
[1:14:19] my point is and you've heard me say that
[1:14:21] well why don't we just get about his
[1:14:23] business
[1:14:25] let's get about god's business you
[1:14:28] understand me let's read this word and
[1:14:30] says lord what would you have me do
[1:14:34] first of all he's not going to have you
[1:14:35] do nothing until you clean up your life
[1:14:39] because you're representing him
[1:14:42] you understand me and that's the biggest
[1:14:44] thing that we all need to do we need to
[1:14:46] get every little fox that's all the vine
[1:14:50] away from us
[1:14:52] and god is more than able to do it
[1:14:55] but most of us amen must realize that we
[1:14:57] must get away from all our selfishness
[1:14:59] we are so selfish
[1:15:04] it's true
[1:15:05] that's why people don't come to church
[1:15:07] they're selfish
[1:15:09] don't even see how the church need them
[1:15:11] to be here
[1:15:14] they don't see it do you think god
[1:15:16] brought you to this message to make go
[1:15:18] stay home i don't even understand it we
[1:15:20] only have two services
[1:15:22] now and wednesdays are almost empty
[1:15:27] sunday they come in and they come in
[1:15:29] late
[1:15:30] and then they give you these attitudes
[1:15:32] like are you going to preach all day
[1:15:36] where's the holy ghost in this
[1:15:39] people say oh brother because you keep
[1:15:40] preaching like that you ain't gonna have
[1:15:42] nobody bye-bye
[1:15:44] i will all have always have somebody if
[1:15:47] it's just jesus alone hallelujah
[1:15:52] no i'm not going to spare the rod i'm
[1:15:55] not going to baby people like i've been
[1:15:57] doing in the past i'm not going to do it
[1:16:00] everybody got to take care of themselves
[1:16:03] and you know we've got a word all of us
[1:16:05] can read we can write
[1:16:08] we can comprehend
[1:16:11] yet we come to church like chickens
[1:16:13] wanting the the preacher to feed you
[1:16:17] but i've been told that eagles feed
[1:16:18] themselves
[1:16:24] and you know we we come in this place
[1:16:27] and you know
[1:16:28] i know god sent me to des moines i don't
[1:16:30] have no doubt about it
[1:16:32] i've been through a lot of stuff too
[1:16:34] but let me tell you something one thing
[1:16:36] i'm assured of is that i'm supposed to
[1:16:38] be here
[1:16:40] now i don't know what all god is going
[1:16:42] to do but i know he gives i have to give
[1:16:44] an account for everything i say and do
[1:16:48] and i love your souls
[1:16:51] i love all of your souls
[1:16:57] i do
[1:16:59] god knows that's the truth
[1:17:03] if i tell a lie from the pulpit
[1:17:06] it's only by way of ignorance
[1:17:10] but everything i see now that god shows
[1:17:13] me i'm going to bring it
[1:17:16] because i want people to make a rapture
[1:17:17] we're not here to be churchy
[1:17:19] in the form of another little system and
[1:17:21] have the prettiest this and the
[1:17:23] prettiest that that's nonsense this is
[1:17:26] let it come if it want to come but if
[1:17:28] it's going to come that way let's make
[1:17:29] sure the inner man is prettier than the
[1:17:31] church
[1:17:35] then each individual in here that
[1:17:36] possesses this eternal life was before
[1:17:39] the foundation of the world in god's
[1:17:42] thinking it's the only way it could be
[1:17:46] because you're in an attribute that's an
[1:17:48] expression of a thought that has become
[1:17:50] a word and a word has taken life and
[1:17:54] it's eternal and it's eternal now this
[1:17:57] is the thing
[1:17:58] we cannot express listen
[1:18:00] do i have the lord yes you got it what
[1:18:02] you think you're feeding on
[1:18:06] what spirit in you that's feeding off
[1:18:08] off the word it ain't a devil spirit
[1:18:12] it's the holy spirit but what it is is
[1:18:15] that we've not allowed ourselves to
[1:18:16] continue to mature we've been children
[1:18:19] for a long time and this is not the hour
[1:18:22] to remain that way
[1:18:25] you got it
[1:18:26] but you got to fight like brother adam
[1:18:28] said and like joshua god told joshua
[1:18:30] i've given you the land but you got to
[1:18:32] fight for every inch
[1:18:36] no he ain't going to just drop it in
[1:18:37] your lap you got to fight for it
[1:18:40] you got to deny yourself and that's what
[1:18:42] the word of god said the bible tells us
[1:18:44] the ones who have ceased from sin
[1:18:47] will suffer in the flesh
[1:18:51] that's the
[1:18:52] truth your flesh isn't going to let you
[1:18:55] rest until it's out of breath
[1:19:01] listen
[1:19:04] that an extended that expression of a
[1:19:06] thought has become a word and the word
[1:19:08] has taken life and it's eternal that's
[1:19:10] the reason we have eternal life it's in
[1:19:13] in the same this is what gets me listen
[1:19:16] when he says in the same principle that
[1:19:19] the great son of god the redeemer we
[1:19:22] become sons and daughters of god through
[1:19:24] that same spirit by the same for
[1:19:28] knowledge of god
[1:19:30] this is why the bible calls he calls us
[1:19:32] jesus christ himself calls us brethren
[1:19:37] amen because we're baptized by the same
[1:19:40] spirit
[1:19:41] guess what he says my father is your
[1:19:44] father and therefore it's our
[1:19:48] father god even more i'm putting it on
[1:19:52] i'm really putting on christ this is
[1:19:54] what it's all about putting on christ
[1:19:56] putting the word whatever the word say
[1:19:58] we are that's what i am
[1:20:00] no condemnation why should i worry about
[1:20:03] my faultyness in the word of faultiness
[1:20:06] what what when the word of god said he's
[1:20:08] freed me from this guilt consciousness
[1:20:12] i don't have to do pentons
[1:20:16] i don't have to go through all these
[1:20:18] changes look what i've done i've done
[1:20:19] this and the devil makes you chew that
[1:20:21] on nasty gum over and over again you get
[1:20:24] down in the prayer and you go back in in
[1:20:27] under the blood or wherever it was and
[1:20:29] you pull it back up again so you can
[1:20:30] feel like you've had a good prayer by
[1:20:32] weeping
[1:20:34] and god said get up from there
[1:20:36] you didn't say nothing to me
[1:20:39] first of all you brought up stuff i
[1:20:41] don't even remember
[1:20:46] is he real
[1:20:47] he's real but we need to get real with
[1:20:50] the word
[1:20:51] you can't be a sinner and a saint
[1:20:54] and how can you be a sinner and a saint
[1:20:56] at the same time you can't but how can
[1:20:58] you be a saint if you still see yourself
[1:21:02] as a sinner
[1:21:04] it's your man your mind and the bible
[1:21:06] says let this mind be in you you'll
[1:21:09] never be happy you're going to
[1:21:11] constantly be stressed out
[1:21:14] because of the way you think
[1:21:16] is not the way god thinks of you
[1:21:22] we you know god tired of these little
[1:21:24] pity parties we have
[1:21:32] when it comes to
[1:21:35] messiahs i'm gonna read this
[1:21:38] we never consider ourselves as this but
[1:21:40] see this is too high for the
[1:21:41] pentecostals they can't fly this high
[1:21:44] this is all about eagles now
[1:21:47] this is all about eagles now i i hope
[1:21:49] i'm talking to all eagles tonight
[1:21:51] those who can stop this chicken strut
[1:21:54] that you've been doing all these years
[1:21:56] and fly like an eagle because this is
[1:21:58] what we need to start looking at these
[1:22:00] great things and applying them to us
[1:22:03] paul brought some things and pete even
[1:22:04] said was hard to understand
[1:22:10] but those understandings came to us
[1:22:13] by way of malachi 4.
[1:22:16] don't you understand you are the whole
[1:22:18] reason for the the the sacrificed lamb
[1:22:24] hallelujah it wasn't just this that
[1:22:27] sacrificed lamb wasn't just for adam
[1:22:29] alone
[1:22:30] but it was to restore eve back to her
[1:22:32] place
[1:22:33] and the lamb of god that took the book
[1:22:35] out of the right hand of him who sat on
[1:22:37] the throne was our lamb was our
[1:22:40] sacrifice
[1:22:42] and we must understand that the message
[1:22:44] has cleaned us and cleared us up but if
[1:22:47] we don't walk in it
[1:22:49] we walk not by sight we walk by faith
[1:22:53] a revelation that i am bride and i am a
[1:22:56] overcomer and i am victorious and i will
[1:22:59] defeat the devil i am the devil's
[1:23:02] adversary
[1:23:04] not that the devil is my adversary i'm
[1:23:06] his
[1:23:07] is that right because that's the way it
[1:23:09] was with legion leader said did you come
[1:23:11] to torment me before my time it was
[1:23:14] jesus who was the devil's adversary
[1:23:17] but until then legion was the whole
[1:23:19] country's adversary
[1:23:24] you think i don't know what i'm let me
[1:23:26] say it like this look just look look at
[1:23:29] just look at the outward appearance of
[1:23:30] people
[1:23:33] showing you if they had the holy ghost
[1:23:35] they were dressed differently and i
[1:23:38] i'm working with women now because
[1:23:39] brother adam said you know the
[1:23:41] condition of the church by the way the
[1:23:42] women dress
[1:23:46] you know i've seen the skirts get so
[1:23:47] short they're all above the knee
[1:23:50] what holy ghost is telling them to do
[1:23:52] that
[1:23:53] that's not
[1:23:54] i can truly tell you that's not the holy
[1:23:56] ghost
[1:23:57] that's a spirit of lust
[1:23:59] and whether they know it or not they're
[1:24:01] deceived
[1:24:02] something's on them that makes them do
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:05] and when i was in lima they started
[1:24:07] doing that stuff i asked those sisters
[1:24:09] why are you doing it now
[1:24:11] well well i said no no no no i said if
[1:24:14] it didn't matter don't shave your legs
[1:24:18] you want somebody to see your legs
[1:24:26] you know what they you know they laughed
[1:24:27] it off but i know i knew what i was
[1:24:29] talking about i told myself you know
[1:24:31] we're so privileged
[1:24:33] we're so privileged in this age because
[1:24:35] if we go back to the law
[1:24:37] a barely a woman was considered a
[1:24:39] prostitute
[1:24:45] huh
[1:24:46] bare-legged
[1:24:49] and that's why most women when they
[1:24:50] couldn't afford stockings they had
[1:24:52] dresses all the way down to the ankle
[1:24:56] i know what i'm talking about i'm trying
[1:24:57] to help us here look at the grace of god
[1:25:00] now
[1:25:01] it's no longer touch not taste not a
[1:25:02] hand or not
[1:25:05] it's grace
[1:25:06] my unconditional love for you
[1:25:09] that's what god has given to us fear not
[1:25:12] little flock
[1:25:13] it is your father's good pleasure his
[1:25:15] will to give you the kingdom
[1:25:17] i'm almost done this is my last one
[1:25:21] for messiahs
[1:25:24] the messiah
[1:25:26] paragraph 22 brother brown said then
[1:25:28] when god was made flesh
[1:25:30] and became the messiah
[1:25:33] then if we
[1:25:34] can yield ourselves to the anointed
[1:25:38] like he was
[1:25:39] we become messiahs now i want you to
[1:25:42] think about what i'm getting ready to
[1:25:44] say
[1:25:45] because the scripture says they cannot
[1:25:46] be completed without us
[1:25:51] then there's something about us
[1:25:53] that must be completed
[1:25:57] and the whole resurrection
[1:25:59] is waiting
[1:26:01] on us
[1:26:02] to understand our position
[1:26:06] and until we find our position and know
[1:26:09] who we oh my god my god my god and know
[1:26:12] who we are
[1:26:14] there'll not be a resurrection because
[1:26:16] we're holding it up
[1:26:18] understand by the grace of god even the
[1:26:20] prophet god said he was a man born out
[1:26:23] of season
[1:26:26] and and look at this
[1:26:28] as you heard me say
[1:26:30] last last sunday those tribes that were
[1:26:33] came over out of egypt came into the
[1:26:36] promised land and then decided to go
[1:26:37] back over to georgia
[1:26:39] what are we doing
[1:26:42] what are we doing in this message so
[1:26:44] much so they even cursed their children
[1:26:46] and god said because of what came out of
[1:26:48] your mouth so will your children be
[1:26:54] and you and i there's only a few people
[1:26:56] like joshua and caleb says no give me my
[1:26:59] mountain
[1:27:01] caleb said i might be an old man but i
[1:27:04] still got it
[1:27:06] and i still want it and i don't know
[1:27:09] about you amen i'm an old man as far as
[1:27:11] i'm concerned but i want my mountain i
[1:27:14] want this
[1:27:15] perfection what what god has placed in
[1:27:18] my hand i want it in my heart so it can
[1:27:21] reflect him i'm tired of me
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:25] aren't you tired of you
[1:27:28] i'm tired of me
[1:27:30] this got to die
[1:27:33] i want all of him
[1:27:36] whatever portion is for me i want it
[1:27:39] and not to glorify myself to glorify him
[1:27:42] this message is right
[1:27:45] whether we agree with it whether we come
[1:27:48] to understand it let me tell you
[1:27:50] something god has never left himself
[1:27:53] without a witness and somebody and i
[1:27:56] hope i'm one of those somebodies
[1:27:58] somebody is going to manifest jesus
[1:28:01] christ in this day
[1:28:03] it has to be
[1:28:05] he can't come he can't unite with the
[1:28:07] church that is not in his image and his
[1:28:09] likeness he can't do it
[1:28:13] what are we going to do continue to play
[1:28:14] church
[1:28:15] that's what we're going to do
[1:28:16] you we're going to settle for just
[1:28:18] coming to church preaching singing you
[1:28:20] know dismissal and
[1:28:23] no no no the church in the new testament
[1:28:26] was active
[1:28:28] active they were so led by the spirit
[1:28:30] philip says listen god told me to go
[1:28:31] into the desert i'm going oh you can't
[1:28:33] go the meeting just started no god told
[1:28:36] me i'm going and he did
[1:28:40] see that's the kind of leadership
[1:28:42] god wants to lead his people again he
[1:28:44] wants his bride to be submissive in
[1:28:47] every way not because we're controlled
[1:28:50] by man or some kind of walls or some
[1:28:52] doctrines and we're so afraid what the
[1:28:54] message people will say what can they
[1:28:57] say
[1:29:02] i consider myself a message person
[1:29:05] but not the systematic kind
[1:29:07] not anymore
[1:29:09] i'm not going to settle for it
[1:29:12] and by god's grace you pray for me and
[1:29:14] i'll be praying for you
[1:29:16] because somebody's got to make it real
[1:29:20] it just it it makes me want to cry to
[1:29:23] see what the prophet god suffered to
[1:29:25] bring this message and look what we've
[1:29:28] done with it
[1:29:32] makes me want to cry
[1:29:35] may god help us all
[1:29:39] or where wouldn't the squeeze come
[1:29:41] whether you listen like i told somebody
[1:29:43] i said i've gone to the grocery stores
[1:29:45] and i've got some pretty beautiful
[1:29:46] oranges amen they look so pretty outside
[1:29:49] and you squeeze them and no juice in
[1:29:50] them
[1:29:54] and to be honest with you that's what a
[1:29:56] lot of people in this believers have
[1:29:57] become
[1:29:58] dried up fruit but pretty on the outside
[1:30:05] y'all know that's true and ain't nothing
[1:30:06] worse than a dried up orange
[1:30:10] smelling good
[1:30:12] some of y'all have you ate the spirit
[1:30:14] you've ever had it like what is this
[1:30:20] i'm almost done
[1:30:23] let me read this then we then when god
[1:30:26] was made flesh and became the messiah
[1:30:29] then if we can yield ourselves to to be
[1:30:32] that anointed like he was
[1:30:35] we become messiahs
[1:30:37] little lights
[1:30:39] that's what the church is supposed to be
[1:30:41] lights
[1:30:42] little anointed ones that god that's
[1:30:45] god's church and i'm like where's the
[1:30:48] anointing
[1:30:50] i look for the anointing church when i'm
[1:30:52] preaching and it's just a few people
[1:30:54] that got a little something something
[1:30:56] i mean not all some got more than
[1:30:58] another you know what i'm saying but the
[1:31:00] reaction of the
[1:31:03] where's the anointing
[1:31:05] i mean you you don't even see something
[1:31:07] you don't even see humanity
[1:31:10] responding
[1:31:12] more or less the anointing
[1:31:17] he's standing light
[1:31:19] his standing light is the light of
[1:31:22] messiah
[1:31:23] you hear what he said oh mike did y'all
[1:31:25] hear what i just did you hear this i'm
[1:31:27] going to say it again let's put it this
[1:31:30] way his standard
[1:31:32] in this day
[1:31:33] is the messiah light
[1:31:36] the light of the messiah
[1:31:38] the anointing
[1:31:40] of the messiah on his people
[1:31:43] that's his standard
[1:31:44] that's the holy ghost
[1:31:46] for today
[1:31:48] hallelujah
[1:31:49] still got all of the things working with
[1:31:52] her the discernment the gifts everything
[1:31:54] we didn't die we steal the tree we're
[1:31:57] still the bride tree
[1:32:01] people say well that's for yesterday is
[1:32:03] that not denominationalism when they do
[1:32:05] that they cut god off by doing that
[1:32:08] that's just what all the other ages did
[1:32:10] prior to them
[1:32:13] is this not restoring
[1:32:17] and don't let a sister get all excited
[1:32:21] the only thing god said a sister can't
[1:32:23] have and that was to preach
[1:32:28] yes the line ought to be hot tonight
[1:32:33] because it's true we don't shut them
[1:32:35] down and we don't even know whether
[1:32:37] they're gifted or not
[1:32:38] because they ate
[1:32:40] just like everybody else afraid
[1:32:42] god won't use you and you're afraid
[1:32:44] if he can't get you to to work with the
[1:32:47] with the little thing how you expect for
[1:32:48] him to move you to higher higher heights
[1:32:51] anoints you
[1:32:53] you know to clap your hand or to jump up
[1:32:55] or to do whatever and you're afraid to
[1:32:57] do it well how do you think he's going
[1:32:59] to take you any further
[1:33:01] can't even trust you with that little
[1:33:02] emotion
[1:33:05] are you ashamed
[1:33:07] the word of god says there will be many
[1:33:09] who would be ashamed of him brother
[1:33:11] madam said he preached a message ashamed
[1:33:14] of him
[1:33:17] his standing light to light
[1:33:19] his standing light is the light of
[1:33:21] messiah
[1:33:23] risen christ
[1:33:25] in his people
[1:33:28] that's what people are so supposed to
[1:33:30] see
[1:33:32] risen christ everybody's got the right
[1:33:34] words but everybody doesn't have the
[1:33:37] anointing
[1:33:41] risen christ in his people the anointed
[1:33:43] ones carrying forth his light into all
[1:33:47] the church ages sometimes it's almost go
[1:33:51] goes sometimes it almost goes completely
[1:33:54] out
[1:33:55] then it comes back again
[1:34:01] oh my god
[1:34:03] because that's what i'm seeing it's
[1:34:05] almost out
[1:34:06] but he said then it comes back again
[1:34:11] god's anointed one god's messiah church
[1:34:15] if messiah means the anointed ones and
[1:34:17] means king
[1:34:19] then if church is anointed by the
[1:34:21] messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but
[1:34:23] still the messiah
[1:34:25] because it has his light reflecting his
[1:34:28] power reflecting his glory reflecting
[1:34:31] his dominion
[1:34:32] so it is messiah oh how it reflects him
[1:34:36] in his kingdom in his domain amen
[1:34:43] god is real
[1:34:49] okay
[1:34:55] romans 8 18-31 i'm gonna let you go on
[1:34:58] this
[1:34:59] for i reckon
[1:35:01] that the suffering of this present time
[1:35:04] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:35:07] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:35:10] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:35:12] creature waited for the manifestations
[1:35:14] of the sons of god
[1:35:17] for the creature was made subject to
[1:35:19] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:35:22] him who have subjected the same in hope
[1:35:26] because the creature itself also shall
[1:35:28] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:35:30] corruption into glorious liberty of the
[1:35:32] children of god
[1:35:34] for we know that the whole creation
[1:35:36] groaneth in travailleth in pain to the
[1:35:38] other unto now
[1:35:40] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:35:43] which have the first fruit of the spirit
[1:35:46] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:35:49] waiting for the adoption to the wit the
[1:35:51] redemption of our body now he said we've
[1:35:54] got the earnest
[1:35:56] but that urn is even with the holy ghost
[1:35:58] you're still groaning
[1:36:00] for what the adoption
[1:36:02] but what for a long time we thought oh
[1:36:04] we got the holy ghost it's it no no
[1:36:06] you've got to grow into it
[1:36:09] and he grows into you that's the
[1:36:12] scripture
[1:36:13] paul said grow in growing grow up into
[1:36:15] christ that's what he said
[1:36:19] for we are saved by hope
[1:36:22] but hope that is seen un that is seen is
[1:36:24] not hope for what man seeth why does he
[1:36:27] yet hope for but if we hope for that we
[1:36:30] see not then do we with patience wait
[1:36:34] for it
[1:36:36] i'm gonna wait until my change come
[1:36:39] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:36:41] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:36:44] should pray for see god is so perfect
[1:36:46] even when you don't know what to pray
[1:36:49] for or how to pray the spirit of god
[1:36:51] prays for you
[1:36:55] hallelujah i'm almost done i know some
[1:36:58] of y'all tired he that searches the
[1:37:00] heart knoweth what is in the mind of the
[1:37:03] spirit because he maketh intercessions
[1:37:05] for the saints according to the will of
[1:37:08] god
[1:37:09] and we know that all things work
[1:37:11] together for the good to them that love
[1:37:13] god
[1:37:14] to them who are the call according to
[1:37:15] his purpose
[1:37:17] here i am lord
[1:37:18] for whom he
[1:37:19] did for know he also did predestinate to
[1:37:22] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:37:26] that we might be the first born among
[1:37:28] many brethren
[1:37:30] moreover he did predestinate them he he
[1:37:33] also called and whom
[1:37:37] he called them he also justified and
[1:37:39] whom he justified
[1:37:41] them he also glorified
[1:37:43] so what shall we say to these things
[1:37:47] if god before us
[1:37:49] who can be against us
[1:37:52] let's stand
[1:37:59] ain't god good
[1:38:02] to give us so
[1:38:04] many blessings undeserving
[1:38:07] that's what we are
[1:38:10] we ought to thank him woo
[1:38:13] loving praise
