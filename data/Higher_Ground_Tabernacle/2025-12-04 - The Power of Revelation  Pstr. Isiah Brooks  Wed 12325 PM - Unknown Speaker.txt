Oh, I'm going in the rapture [music and singing] to be with my Lord. [music] Amen. Amen. Well, left my tamarine home. Just so many things have been happening today. The very message I was going to preach tonight &gt;&gt; has been erased. &gt;&gt; Gone. &gt;&gt; I can't recall the last time I've had that happen to me. And I don't know what I did wrong. &gt;&gt; But uh I believe God bless tonight &gt;&gt; as we stand. &gt;&gt; Give honor to everybody tonight. I need to see you, brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless everybody here. &gt;&gt; Sister Karen and the new one. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good. to us. &gt;&gt; No matter what we go through, God is in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with us to Hebrews 7. just got my phone back. It went dead on me. Different things happened, &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God, you know, we spent about five hours at the Amazon place trying to get my phone, the blessing, and all of that. I didn't have to pay for a new one. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I got everything free. So we thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; The subject uh tonight I want to minister on is the power of revelation as we turn to Hebrews 7 1-4. But this MZDC, king of Salem, &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, returning from the slaughter of the king, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being by interpretation king of righteousness, after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace, without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the son of God. Now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. Abrahamology. Amen. Let us pray. My gracious father God, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves. We pray Lord God that you bless the service in a special way. We give you honor. We give you praise. We give you the glory. We know that [snorts] all things are moving by your power. Lord, you know this day you've seen this moment. We pray, Father God, that you give us grace to move completely out of your way that you would have preeminence. If I have said or done anything, oh God, that have not been pleasing in thy sight, forgive us, oh God, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. When we think about &gt;&gt; Revelation, something that God reveals. &gt;&gt; You don't get it by intellect. Even though it may strike your intellect first, it has to go down to the heart because true revelation is revealed to the heart. &gt;&gt; Now, here was a man by the name of Abraham who had met God uh before but had never really seen it. &gt;&gt; But we realize something today that uh when it comes to God and Abraham, God had to reveal himself. See, you can't know God except he revealed himself. And that's why I think brother Brandham when he be he preached He talks about the the the the scripture according to Matthew. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock I'll build my church. And he said the rock was not Peter. And the rock was not just Jesus. It was a revelation of who he was. Revelation is important &gt;&gt; because not only did Abraham recognize who he was, but Abraham paid tithes. My question would be, why did not Abraham find a lamb, &gt;&gt; slay the lamb, and offer up a burnt sacrifice. In Abraham's revelation, he understood the battle had been fought and the victory was won. And Melzdc stood as the victory victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And instead of offering up a lamb, &gt;&gt; he paid tithe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. giving reverence and respect to GOD FOR all the redemption work he had done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He understood that his salvation came by the grace of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Abraham that won the battle. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD WHO WON THE BATTLE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And he MCZDC, &gt;&gt; he was the great warrior. &gt;&gt; He was the the the the the FORCE BEHIND THE SCENE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And it was revealed to Abraham. Now, you might not think this is great, but you got to realize Abraham came from a place Amen. &gt;&gt; LIKE INDIA everything with God. Now he sees God recognize who he's WORSHIPING and and in return what God had given him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation is amazing. I want you to understand, watch the scriptures, every victory &gt;&gt; was given given somebody revelation, right? If you go all the way back and able, let me go on on back 10. Let's go back. Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Eve was deceived &gt;&gt; and Adam was not. &gt;&gt; Adam willfully sin. &gt;&gt; Therefore, if a man sinned, he took a man for redemption. Even in the New Testament, THE GRACE OF GOD STILL stands with Eve. It says she was deceived. She was reviled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She didn't mean to do it in the first place. Revelation was given to a uh Adam &gt;&gt; concerning his wife. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He could have left her there. &gt;&gt; But he recognized one thing. &gt;&gt; That she was a part of him ever be complete without her. Even as Jesus Christ will never be complete without his bride. THE POWER OF REVELATION. WILL MAKE A MAN STAND UP TO A GIANT. The power of revelation bring down GET RID OF ALL OF THE ODDS. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'm saying? THE THE POWER OF REVELATION TO A REAL CHRISTIAN MAKES ALL THINGS POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE ARE NO FENCES. THERE ARE NO HINDRANCES. BECAUSE GOD SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING BELIEVE THAT YOU SHALL receive it unto you is powerful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother says this &gt;&gt; in adoption. Who was that man? &gt;&gt; Who was he? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 43. Who was he? He never had a father. He never had a mother. He never had uh when he began or he never did have a time he ever die. He met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the kings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just the slaughter of the people. Slaughter of the king. HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE DOING? He went out to get Lot. And I thought when I read this quote, I said, "Lord, we're falling short. We're not going out to get Lot. Lot is out there. AND LOT IS STILL A PART OF ABRAHAM'S INHERITANCE." That's right. To bring him where? BACK. AND HE slaughtered the kings which then kings had slaughtered. The kings had a slaughtered. &gt;&gt; I believe 10 or 15 kings and their kingdoms. But Abraham armed his servant and went after him, separated himself by night. I love this because this didn't happen during the daytime. This happened during the night time where you couldn't clearly see. LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. FAITH SEES NO GIANT too hard for God. You have to hear what I'M SAYING TONIGHT. BUT Abraham armed his servants and went after him AND SEPARATED HIMSELF BY NIGHT when he caught HIM IN THE NIGHT TIME. HALLELUJAH. OH, BROTHER. We work in the darkness now. Hallelujah. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WE ARE WORKING IN THE DARKNESS NOW. THE ONLY LIFE WE HAVE IS THE GOSPEL LIFE. BUT BEATING HIMSELF, but he separated HIMSELF AND CAUGHT HIM AND BROUGHT HIM BACK ON HIS ROAD BACK. HALLELUJAH. THERE NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER day as such. HALLELUJAH. IT IS A BREAKING OF THE DAY. But this breaking OF THE DAY IS OUR RAPTURING TIME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You love the Lord. It's something that God gives to you. &gt;&gt; You are chosen elected of God. God said it is given to you to know the scriptures to understand the revelation. For an example, the woman caught in adultery, nobody knew who he was. All her accusers. &gt;&gt; Had no idea who Jesus was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But somehow she caught a revelation. &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what revelation does. True revelation forgive you of your sin. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me EXPLAIN THAT. &gt;&gt; SO, HERE'S A WOMAN CAUGHT in adultery. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to kill her, &gt;&gt; but Jesus. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO WHAT HAPPENS? HE GOES THROUGH HIS COURT case when he came with the sentence. He asked her answer QUESTION ACCUSER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Who shall LAY IN THE CHARGE TO GOD'S ELECT? &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOUR ACCUSERS? Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? WHERE ARE YOUR ACCUSERS? &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE SAID, LORD, I have none. &gt;&gt; Y'all better hear me. AND AT THAT MOMENT and he SAID GO AND SIN NO MORE. &gt;&gt; SHE CAUGHT THE REVELATION. She destroy she destroyed destroy. HE DESTROYED HER.
