TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e the grace of God God knows and understands all um when when we read the scripture and Paul is talking about Revelation made known mystery and and those kind of things of course we like to hear those words or that mystery um but Mysteries when is revealed to you it it it it how can I say it it's like like the little boy uh looking in the mirror it identifies you it makes you know what you look like and your image um and and this is what the Bible does uh we uh who are the children of God and this is what brother random said he said that God wanted a family amen uh prior to that we didn't know that and you know I don't know about you but being in the denomination of churches uh you know it was always I hope I'm I'm I'm hoping that God will save me I didn't know it was a an assurance amen that God has assured us yes sir that we are saved and this is what Paul is doing here in the scripture he's not only identifying but opening it up that we are have and always been a mystery of God and his connection with the Gentiles but in reality it was always in the word I mean you take uh Ruth and Boaz you know what I mean you you you you go throughout all of the uhhh scriptures and you find these Gentile women which is represents the Gentile church or the Gentile bride and and how God grafted them in I guess one of the things that really um amazes me is when God goes to Jericho and he finds a prostitute amen and and she literally becomes an heir one thing about the wife which is beautiful is because once she is the consummation occurs she's she no longer has her own identity she and the man becomes one and he and she loses her name and takes on his and and that's what God is trying to tell us all along amen that we we loses our identity as a gentile people we're no longer Gentile we become as Jewish as God was am or God is now we understand that God is a different kind of Jew because his judism did not come by sexual activity amen he was appointed or anointed or however you want to say it uh just like uh God appointed SE uh the Bible said when God brought forth self then men began to call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was an appointed ordained seed of God and guess what the mystery of the whole thing is that in his seed you were there amen now we talking about a mystery because for how many years even when it came to the Jewish people God chose them to be the chosen one chosen people but instead of being clothed in humility they were clothed in Pride and the people that they were to be lights uh unto uh actually became their enemy uh really GLE that's why you get proales because people began to see God Among the Jews and then they join in with the Jews and became a Jew by ritual but here you become a Jew if you want to say it like this by birth amen uh we are the spiritual Israel right so anyway let's move on he said but which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that what the Gentiles should be fellow Hees I love that and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel amen think about people that had no uh real identity we were called dogs even by Jes Jesus and and that was our nature that's what we did uh but God by his grace grafted Us in and now we are a part of him in so much so we are called the brid tree that's amen so we must know by the grace of God that what we're now working with and I'm going to read a few things quickly but I want you to understand we're not talking about fundamental Church is that's right the Church of God is not a fundamental Church it has some fundamentals but it is a spirit fill church amen that's what distinguish you that's what distinguish me from all other things uh God uh uh bringing us into his body by one spirit amen and and Paul is exemp how can I say it um pushing this in the sense that you know if you take his writings when it comes to Corinthians and I I'll come to that in just a moment but Paul says you know I fear lest you would be beguiled like Eve was he said listen I I I want to present unto you unto Christ you as a Chase virgin and the only way you can become that is that you stay with the word I was talking with brother Craig today and I told him I said now why have we made this message so complicated it shouldn't be I said to put it in a nutshell Eve disbelieved amen Eve disobeyed and in order to be restored you must believe and you must obey amen simple the word of God it goes right back wherever she fell we must come back to it amen but in a positive way but we make it so fantastic I guess is the word it shouldn't be that way but let me read it what what I tried to quote here second Corinthians please 2 Corinthians the 11th chapter uh 3-5 always remember Ephesians was a mature Church she was not like Corinthians amen Ephesians according to the prophet of God she had all the gifts every one of them she had two and she even had a prophet amen but it wasn't her day and her time for a Rapture that's right you understand me because Malachi four was the last prophet to show himself on the scene amen Paul was the first amen and William brandom the seventh right y y'all understand what I'm saying and we understand that seven is completion so what what the prophet had to do or wasn't that he did it but God through through Visions through Revelation and things like that he had to show him the things in which Paul preached amen see because everybody could read those things where Paul preach and still yet get a different Revelation but God had to give him the correct revelation of what was preached hundreds of years ago so that this day this church could have the pure word of God Amen without any mixture that's right because y'all remember mixture is the thing that caused the problem in the beginning here Paul says the third verse but I Fearless any lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subti so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ and you know what he says so your mind amen because that's where the serpent went first he went to her mind before he could get her body he went to her mind that's right and before go the devil can get you to do anything wrong or negative he comes to to your mind and the moment you listen to him you've already fallen right is that right amen that's why Jesus said as a man thinketh in his heart amen that's right so is he right your mind your body and your soul are those three uh parts of you that you must fight to keep holy amen once you have achieved God in your soul it's wonderful but now your spirit has to be controlled Lord and your flesh had to has to be controlled Lord right you said what do we wait wait yes that's why the Bible said grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you will seal to the day of your Redemption though you be perfect in your soul God wants to you to be perfect in your spirit as well as your flesh amen that's why Paul says you Must Die daily amen now here was Paul a man full of the Holy Ghost but he understood the nature of the spirit and he understood the nature of the flesh yes it because you know what without the spirit and the flesh if we had just that perfect soul with the soul where the Holy Ghost is we'd be ready for a Rapture but God as he told Israel when it came to the Joshua conquer everything amen and that same Commission is given to us to conquer everything this is yours your body your soul your spirit is yours that's right God gave this to you it's not of the devil because even in the resurrection you're going to still look like you right but in a glorified way and Paul is saying to you it's given to you it it's not like you got a work for it you got to believe it and act upon it right for he listen but for if he that cometh preach another Jesus whom we have not preached that's that fourth verse or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him I'm going say I'm going to read that one again for if he that cometh preaches another Jesus you mean there's another Jesus yes and are you aware that Joshua is the same word as Jesus amen right and brother bandam said there was no greater warrior in all times as great as Joshua am now he's not including Jesus but you know he's working with Joshua because Joshua is a type of Jesus right because this is what the prophet of God said and I'm kind of jumping uh in in in in in my in my study but he said and I'll read it to you in just a moment he said what happened to that Pillar of Fire that was with Moses he said that Pillar of Fire that was with Moses turned into a man amen yes sir and that man was that angel of the Lord and and when that angel of the Lord when Joshua saw that angel with the sword drawn he said who side are you going to be on right understand Joshua's mentality yes he had an invincible mind Amen in other words nothing can conquer me because I am on the Lord's Side amen or the Lord is on my side and this is what he asked that angel come on somebody he said who are you whose side are you on right and then when the angel said I am the what Captain amen of the Lord's host now I want you to understand we've got the same Captain that's right in Revelation 10 I think it's the mighty angel that came down it's the same Angel amen it's God himself that's right he's here to make sure we conquer everything of the soul of the body and the spirit amen how you going to conquer your flesh your flesh has to die that's right y'all heard what I said the other night think about some of the things that you have been uh uh o you've overcome there is no temptation none that's what dead mean amen and God want us to bring this flesh under control where it's so dead no temptation that's what he said brother the pro brandom said the devil won't won't know what to do with you amen you'll be so yielded to the Holy Spirit the devil try every trick he possibly can with you and will not succeed amen because you have been you have allowed Joshua to conquer the land amen that's what I believe Hallelujah now now he says listen another gospel that means just a little bit of twist can bring death to you just a little bit and and I'm going tell you what I I I see a lot of people are not conscious of it but I I'm I'm going re reate this so you can understand we don't have time no sir for structural things how can I say it fundamentals we need God Amen we need the holy GH ghost we need God and and and the thing about it is we can have it all lined up in a row like like Cain did he was fundamental and brother BR said he worshiped God Amen but it wasn't what God required he required blood amen and no matter how we love this message quote this message think you know this message it will never the only thing that gives you power or authority is the blood of Jesus Christ that's right proven proven by the sons of ska when I preach the Jesus Paul preach you I preach the Jesus brother Brandon preach what you better know him amen that's right and he must know you cuz those demons know when you got it and when you don't right amen so we know we know we we listen I'm coming to this because I want this Ephesian is really and I can't say it all in just a little while but this Ephesian is exciting me you know why because I read Joshua amen and then I heard the message about on Joshua brother Ram says and he goes on to say that remember Jericho was shut up they were afraid so understand this the demons of this age they are afraid of you that's truth right there but we we we we afraid of them a lot of them we are no no no no they are afraid of us because they see the transformation that God has done in your life amen they can recognize like people amen that's and the word is gone out amen right don't even think those demons done for what brother Bram the Lord did through brother brandham amen that's right right in other words we saw what God did over in Egypt amen we saw what God did and now this ministry is greater Amen in the sense you got more than one man you got a body amen see the devil's scared the world is scared you don't believe me do you let me say it like this that's why all of the Council of church churches and everything the political realm the social realm everybody is coming to do what trying to destroy the bride what do you think this thing in in Israel happening what do you think that is amen they are afraid how can so many countries be afraid of a little country because they see God Amen and their inspiration is from the devil amen we can't be afraid no no no no no we got to be like Joshua Hallelujah Revelations 10 please the demon the demons trembles at the name of Jesus that's why the devil don't want us to get that Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you got Jesus that's right Hallelujah glory to God excuse me yeah you got it Revelations 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel any questions any thoughts okay we'll move on Revelations 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and and his left foot on the earth now here Paul talks about Mysteries and now here the scripture talks about Mysteries but now this book that once was sealed is now open amen and so therefore there's Mysteries coming forth and understandings that are coming forth to what not the Jew not at this present time but to the Gentile amen because what God is doing now and this is what I believe the Lord said to me not long ago go he said this is the hour of selection Lord you know everybody oh I'm bride I'm bride but right now this is the hour of selection amen is that right because everybody all the beautiful girls uh uh came before King aser all of the ones they got it from every Providence but there was one Esther and she was selected and right now this is what God is doing many call for few are chosen so keep that heart in in your mind amen and and and as we as our brother rich brought that scripture out I think it's Mark Mark 6:21 or something like that pray that God would count to worthy Amen to escape the wrath that is to come that's right it's coming amen right right so anyway let's move on and he cried with a loud voice as when a line and Roar and when he had cried even I mean seven Thunders uttered their voices you know people still still afraid of when you say seven Thunders they like wow where is he going with that people of God it's the word why are people afraid of the word I don't understand that anyway and when the seven Thunders it doesn't matter what others have done with it God interprets his own word amen even brother brandham said when it came to the Seven Seals don't try to interpret it it will interpret itself but we hardhead men we want to always jump in there and make it something that is not or satisfy the people's itching ears and all of that good stuff but you know what happens to that right at the end of the day they end up building a golden calf that's right right men worshippers instead of worshiping God and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there are therein are and the earth and the things that that therein are and the Sea and the things that the things that which are therein and that there should be time no longer listen but I love the but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound right remember the the book was closed the book was and now he says but listen there's coming a day those Mysteries will sound right so here it is and brother bandam says listen at the at the at the beyond the curtain of time he said well Paul have to stand like I stood and and the voice says yes amen then brother BR says I'm you know in other words I'm happy to hear that and then the whole redeemed crew because brother said I preach exactly what Paul preached and the whole Cru is I'm resting on that in other words I'm in heaven because you what you preached amen amen true I'm resting on that y'all understand me it's not like I'm going to get there and rest no no no I'm resting I'm not in hell I'm not lost I'm in this place because of what you preached amen so we can we can truly Bank on what Paul is saying because Paul even set a standard he said if an angel come and preach anything other than what I preached let it be a curse amen hallelujah glory to God so this Ephesians and this Joshua you put them together and you understand what this is not heaven amen we have been ordained to fight amen and because you say oh I'm circum circumcised I was justified yes Sanctified yes but now that you receive the Holy Ghost the battle is on Amen and now what is it you follow the orders of Joshua right remember aen did not Joshua said kill everything don't bring nothing back we don't want we don't need none of that and and aen did just the opposite guess what he died so it's so important to follow the message or the word of the Lord through the prophet it it's it's always going to be Bible folks you got to bring it back to the Bible it's always in the Bible amen but people think it's something different only because you didn't you never caught the Revelation and you never took what brother Ram said back to the Bible amen but it's in there Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah is that right even they thought some of the things like the Thunders or whatever he you was that was on the back side of the book he couldn't add nothing brother said one day you'll find out where it is written amen it's in there how long was Acts 238 in the Bible and Through the Dark Ages they lost it right amen right read it and read right over it but one day God required it cuz he was restoring so that's how God works now who is he building now he's not building a denomination matter of fact he's a he's gone out from them they they think they're alive but the Bible said a woman that lives in pleasure is already dead amen he's got a People that he's building and you you and me we are that people that Ephesians is telling us listen you are the mystery made known Hallelujah you're the manifested of the manifested word you're the one that God has hidden all these years you Gentiles God has chosen you to be bride and understand that your beginning was not in time it was before time amen Paul is laying it on but you see you have to be spiritual understanding amen because as the prophet said God couldn't give this meat to the Corinthians they were too carnal they were always fighting so how do you know when a Christian is carnal they're fighting fighting one another amen and most of the time it means nothing I said why are you fighting why are you going through through all these changes when it's all has to do with election and being chosen amen you can't put a person in heaven you can't take him out it is what it is you anyway let's move on you love the Lord I'm moving I'm I'm I'm taking too much time I'm sorry uh from the message the great warrior Joshua and I'm tying this into Ephesus because I don't Ephesus is a short book but I want to kind of make it last so we can see that ties right in if we don't understand that the inheritance that Paul says we have you say oh well God is giving it to you yes but you got to fight amen for every inch of it amen hallelujah yeah Paul say these wonderful things but you got to fight to obtain it it just doesn't come by reading the book of Ephesus or a chapter of it no he's telling you what is given to you you got to OB believe and you must obey that's how you get over amen that's how you become in the Statue of a perfect man obedience amen hallelujah you love the Lord listen in the paragraph 28 he says he's got a church tonight made up of all around the world he's got a lot things about it that's got to be iron out listen what brother says I can't iron them out I couldn't iron them out I don't know how to iron them out no other man can but that God's but that's God's business to do that he will take care of that it's not in the hands of man to do it but isn't that how we try to make it work amen no matter how many man made programs We rise up there ever there'll ever one fall just as sure as you raise them up but God himself will set up his program and his program is Jesus Christ as far as I know it is to be baptized into Christ and be led by the Holy Spirit free from condemnation and this is maturity this is maturity talking to brother today and we were talking about speaking squirrels speaking things in existence and I said well we concluded that that does not come by your way of thinking amen everything that brother brandham spoke to and it happened was inspired by the Holy Ghost that's right they that are led by the spirit amen you don't lead the spirit the spirit leads you amen and they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of God Amen and Joshua typed out the Holy Ghost amen leading the children of Israel and as long as they did what Joshua said do they won every battle amen that's right and as long as we do what the Holy Spirit tells us to do we win every battle even over this your body because this is your inheritance this is it you said well a let me tell you something the hardest thing to conquer is you amen that's right sir and only God can help you do that true the Holy Ghost is the only one can help you conquer this old man am and the devil knows every trick in the in the in in the book cuz he Liv with you long enough amen right he did the same thing to Israel once they came out of Egypt they thought they was all they way to you know to the promised land in which they were but all he had to do was stir up some of them old Natures fussing fighting complaining murmuring all of that until God said I'm tired of it see God don't like murmuring and complaining that's true that's what they that's why they were destroyed they did a lot of Filth they did a lot of things but it's listed that God got tired of there murmuring and complaining that's right I remember one time that I was one of my boys my baby was a one of them was a wher y'all know what a whiner is it's one of those little babies that'll sing a song like m m mama and he was standing in my door while my wife and I was trying to rest and I said oh I such was no Holy Ghost feeling either but such a holy such a feeling came over me I said I grabbed my wife I said if you don't get him in other words I'm coming out of this bed and an ain't GNA be fun so she stopped him and and I you know I love my I love my son I better not say that cuz he might be looking listening but you know it's just it was amazing how angry I got in such a split second and I could just liken God like that maybe not exactly like me but all you do is complain that what about this and what about that what you know and the Bible said then all things give thanks amen that's right all things you may not understand what you're going through but that all things give thanks will promote you you that's right that's your patience that's your faithfulness you can't be faithful without patience amen that's a quote you have to have patience to be faithful amen Joshua after seeing that good open that God open up the sea he said that settles it with me God opened up the sea before they left Egypt the Lord in the form of the pillar of fire that was whirling over the top of Moses and them standing there he said I will send my angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared hello and what we're saying what we're seeing is that he said I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you'll be also see he prepared had the promised land before they got there God then already told them about the greates and everything else the houses in the land yes and before we get where we're going he's already told us how glorious it's going to be Hallelujah but you got to fight and you got to believe the promise and you got to follow Joshua amen hallelujah who is Jesus Christ of our day and the Lord in the form of the pill of fire that was whing above oh Moses and them standing there he said I will send my angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared beware of him provoke him not see the the murmuring complaining beware of him provoke him not for my name can can you see it see uh for my name is in him right can you see it in other words grieve not the Holy Ghost sure it was Christ the anointed my name is in him Joshua seen him there like a man with the sword drawn and we see him today as a sin offering for sin the resurrected Emmanuel sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high making intercessions and bringing to pass anything we confess that he's done for us hallelujah see right the man I could see lift up his sword High says no I'm the captain of the Lord's host the the god of Israel the captain of the host who was the captain of the host Joshua reached down unloosed his shoes fell on his face before and said what would the Lord have me do see after he had been he was getting he was getting his position then you see after he had been he was getting his his position then he was to be the greatest military man that ever seen on the face of the Earth they'll never be a general like Joshua amen hallelujah and I'm going say it like this whether people want to believe it or not Malachi 4 was the greatest of all generals amen that's the truth Billy Graham or Roberts all of them couldn't compare the ministry could not compare because what God was doing he was bringing about another Exodus a crossing over if you want to say it that way that's right the word Joshua comes from the word Jesus mean Jesus or savior deliverer and so when he seen this man what was it it was the captain in other words the leader of the host of Israel and the that leader was none other than Christ himself and that was he F that's and what was was he seen in a pill of fire now the pill of fire had become a man he said I hope you know what I'm talking about he had become a man do y'all get it the pill of fire that was above his head in our day is now wearing the image of a man amen amen amen this is what he trying to get over to you not that the man himself but what God was doing Ephesians 3 7 and 10 I tell you what I would not want to be in the shoes of these people who have cut Malachi for off and call him a false prophet I would not want to be in their shoes you may not understand everything but if you got any spirituality about you know you should know no man could have done the things he did amen no man and the only man I know that superseded him was Jesus Christ himself amen and that's who was doing the work in our day not the man it was Jesus Christ in the man Hallelujah alah Ephesians 3 7-10 Where whereof I Was Made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints I love it such a great man but he humbles himself is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable Riches of Christ you understand his feelings he was one who helped and he stood there and cheered the people to kill stepen and brother bam said he never got over that God used him use that to drive him into doing the works that he wanted him to do Paul was killed about three times noted dead amen and he raised up amen three times ston and all kinds of stuff happened to him am and he kept kept going kept going kept going and then at the end of the day he wasn't satisfied until his head was chopped off so you see by the grace of God when when God is anointing you to do something a True Believer that's all the vision you have amen nothing else you don't have nothing else in your vision you just is there focusing on what God wants you to do amen and you won't allow anything to get in your way amen right unto me who the least and I love that as I said to preach unto what the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul understood who he was preaching to because he said I would want I I I I trust and hope my ministry will present to Christ a Chase virgin amen so he understood he was preaching to the bride of Christ in his day that's how come brother Brandon stayed so true to the word because he knew he was preaching to the bride of Christ amen of his day I must tie it in so we can understand why he said Ephesians parallel Joshua amen it's a battle but we like Caleb give me my Mountain Lord we have something in view that we definitely want and that is that full adoption where all Heaven and Earth will recognize you and Obey you according to his inspiration and to make all men see what is the mystery or The Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ one of the things that I have been meditating on is how is it going to be in in that City see we we're not on the outside we're in the city we're in the throne amen room and I I I just Tred to imagine sometimes uh you know not like I want to be served but can you have you ever felt the presence of the Holy Ghost so powerful and you hate to leave it and this is just a taste these bodies would not even be able to take the full impact of his Holiness sometime I get lost in that and and at the same time I recognize how unworthy I am amen I'm unworthy even to preach to God's bride this is this is this is nothing to play with and I know that and just to be uh who I am and I told the Lord today I'm going do everything that you ordained me to do amen like brother random said if I end up in hell at least I could say I did what he wanted me to do amen and they're going to have a hard time with me CU I'll praise him even then Lord amen amen they'll know I'm there brother that's right because the pro truth of the matter is what's real is real and whatever you are here is what you going to be there amen how you going to stop how you going to stop loving him either way how there's no way you know why because he's in you amen that's amazing to me I I you know that's kind of sound crazy but honestly I I think to myself sometime I said if I can't make Heaven I'd rather be burned Till There is nothing left left cuz to be left in Consciousness that you miss heaven and God and you'll never see him again or ever come into His presence that's far worse than a fire amen being consumed y'all understand me to me it would be best to be dissolved go into nothing amen if that makes sense because I tell you what just the idea of not being in his presence is torment enough listen to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery what Fellowship this is where where he says now now you understand you got to be a fellowship you you can't just not Fellowship that means you got to study it you got to read it you got to enjoy it you know when you fellowshipping somebody somebody he's feeding you like on the road to EMAs did not our hearts burn it was a feeding the message must fellowship with you you must fellowship with the word amen that's right which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ and this what we must understand people of God many people would love to hear and see what you seeing amen that's the and they cannot because they've not been chosen to do so and so when a person doesn't see this message you don't jump all over them your heart goes out amen you love them you understand me that's right reason being they're family amen foolish version is family amen they'll be there not only them but those who gave you a good drink of water lord those who feared you in the name of Jesus Amen they won't be B but they'll be there am that's what we don't we we we we can't be Pharisee about this thing we better say Lord thank you for your grace and your mercy anyway to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God manifold that means many folds amen he took it it took to save you a great adversary called the level God outsmarting in every way came down to his level and he still couldn't with him amen so you got to understand what this whole battle was about this battle that that Israel is fighting she's fighting the same Devils we're fighting they're concentrating over there because they know they coming here too y'all understand me and we know what this whole thing is about making a covenant making the stock market fall and crash and whatever more and putting us in a position of desperation cuz many of us are not desperate enough but I tell you what God knows how to do it amen and that is his manifold wisdom many times Satan will look at you like we defeated them now he did that way with jovah I've defeated joov car ah he's he's he's got he he's lost everything God said no he won't he won't curse me job began to bless God in in every situation because God knew he would amen God don't put you through a test if he he knows you're going to fail God only test you because he knows you're going to be a winner amen and like I said the other night patience waiting on God yes God said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always be there but you're always in all your patience you must always look look for the way of Escape you understand me because the Bible said with every Temptation God has made a way of Escape amen the door is open you just got to find the open door ask God to show you where that open door is so you can walk out of it in Victory let's stand no question question any questions comments I'm sure some of y'all deep thinkers can add something all righty that's that I don't I don't particularly want it to be a lecture I want it to be kind of like a school so if you read anything in Ephesians and there's a question bring that bring that yes sir I got a question re M and I saw Yes am see that right there that's what that's what that is yes sir yes sir amen everybody love the Lord amen let's have a word of prayer father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy in this hour of worship and praise we lord I pray that you will continue to open the book of Ephesians in a way that that it will open up the book wider than just the Ephesian just to show that that all the other scriptures prior Old Testament as well is a Vindication of the things in which Paul is instructing Us in Father we thank you for all that you do and all that you have done thank you for this blessed and wonderful day that you've given unto us and we pray that you give us safe travels home let no hurt H or danger come upon us in Jesus Christ's name
