appreciate the word this morning you love the Lord amen surely God is Worthy worthy worthy of all praise wonderful once again I GRE you all in the name of the Lord Jesus amen we thank God for the singing amen all right we are going to read again here uh let's start again here in the Book of James then we come back to Hebrews James chapter 1 verse 18 of his own will beg he us with the word of Truth amen that we should be a kind of first fruits of his own creatures amen may the Lord bless you you may be seated amen and we read again in the book of uh Hebrews Hebrews 3 that's where we read Hebrews chapter 3:1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus amen who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he would let me read it again for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who hath builded the house ha more honor than the house amen let's stop there for now amen amen so we are still speaking on fatherhood still still speaking on the house amen you know brother Brenham says uh the house of God shall live again amen amen amen and uh I believe that we are part of that house hallelu so uh we are trying to move on we'll try to move on tonight and uh won't hold you for too long since it's our communion service but uh we'll try to say as much as we can amen amen so we realize that uh uh the promises of God are true yes am amen and and God doesn't change his mind about his wi amen and we we have to look at things the way God sees them or the way God is presenting them to us uh and his ways are not our ways they are very different from our ways uh and we saw how uh the house can be uh more than just your children yes amen amen it can be more than just that amen like when when we look at the house of Moses the house of Moses was not just himself his wife and his children amen he he didn't just believe only for those he the Bible says by faith he forsook Egypt so he believed for the whole of Israel amen so it was not only for his wife and and Sons and no no no no no it was more than that and as I said this morning he even believed for their animals am we won't even leave a wolf right here in Egypt amen so uh we we these things are reaching for our learning I like what the prophet says in fundamental foundation for Faith he says sometimes we think how great Moses is how great these uh you know prophets are in the Bible he says they saw our day and embrace it am amen amen they Embrace these promises right here amen that's how that's what made them great amen so in short Moses saw this message he saw the third pool he saw all these things that's why he could speak the word then under the blood of animals amen so here it is and the day is right here so we we are not supposed to be afraid of nothing amen we we must claim it we must possess it amen now you know I I don't see things this straight this way sometimes I take something something here and something there but it all builds up I hope you you you understand me now amen now in this message restoration of the Bride tree there's something wonderful I found there brother Brenham says uh he talks about winter Easter because you see the the world has got the Northern Hemisphere and the southern hemisphere Easter time to you to you here in the northern hemisphere is Springtime for us it's winter time now he was speaking and he was in the northern hemisphere he says Easter is time of restoration amen but it's amazing when you take the Earth as a whole for us to have life we must also have death amen even in a chrisan in life for us to have life there must be death we die to self we die to our thoughts we die to our ways we die to everything that is us so that we can have the Life of Christ amen amen so when in the southern hemisphere is death you know the grass is dying the trees are dying and so on to you in the northern hemisphere is Easter it's spring time it's restoration time amen it's a resurrection time amen then the prophet says he says when the time comes when the time of of of of Easter come when the time of spring comes he says the flower claims that he's got a right to resurrect am he says then the law of God turns the Earth around brings it closer to the to the sun and the sun forces everything that the winter death killed to bring it back am amen amen but how does it start it starts with a flower claiming a so everything here is going to start with us claiming it amen confessing it amen then God will make everything he will even make our situation obey our confession what did the shite woman say it is well and it had to be well oh sorry this thing must be in the pocket yes death had to bring a son yes amen she said it is well the situation had to be well so a child of God we as a children of God even what we say we must watch it we must say the right thing we must think right things we must confess the right thing in the midst of all those troubles the woman said it is well amen a son is dead everybody's crying and so on but she said it is well amen hallelujah and it had to be well amen you look if you look at all the Christian songs they are positive they are positive all of them there's no negative Christian song you you can look at them all and very courageous amen and and the prophet says As we sing these things as we say these things we we we are confessing it even in our songs we are confessing amen that's good it's a confession amen and it's in the scripture amen you must even talk to yourself don't worry and talk to yourself about your debts and your problems and all that the Bible says talk to yourself in HS amen and Psalms so when when when we are even alone there's no virtue in worry amen so we have to say the right things even to ourselves amen amen so the flower claims the resurrection so that's why we are saying this things so that we should have something to talk about we should have something that we can claim and say this one is my promise is mine I believe it yes amen so what a man this Moses was amen now we we saw how he said those things I mean things were not looking good when he was saying that Israel was still slaves they they they were still I mean Pharaoh was still having an upper hand but he told him we won't even leave a ho here those things were not said when things were fine when they were when they were when they were out of Egypt and towards the Red Sea no they were still in boundage he said we are not leaving a wolf here we are not leaving our children here we are not leaving anyone here so he believed for them he beli for their children for their animals for everything amen that's that's that's fatherhood that's what a prophet means amen that's why we could find in the Book of Daniel Amen the Bible doesn't mention anything wrong about the life of Daniel but we find Daniel praying and confessing his sins and the sins of Israel yes amen interceding for the whole nation as a prophet so preaching is not just standing and telling people things he's also going behind the scenes and praying for them and praying for their children and confessing to God and interceding and coming between God and the people amen and having a bearing for the people amen so what a great man this Moses is and what a lesson we learn from him and brother sister we realize that they came out but I want to read something here for you from the prophet till brother bam came we had nothing to say uh this is found in the message Hebrews chapter 3 paragraph 137 and the pillar of fire was sent to Moses and Moses was sent to the children of of Israel I like that so uh the pillar of fire is sent to Moses and Moses sent to Israel so Moses saw the pillar of fire am they were not seeing the pillar of fire they were seeing Moses okay that's how it was even in the New Testament is like that Paul said follow me as I follow Christ so he's following the same Pillar of Fire that Moses followed and he said you follow me as I follow Christ so the pillar of fire appeared in the Old Testament and Moses wrote the Old Testament appeared to Paul you know on the on the day of Pentecost in the upper room uh the pillar of fire came divided himself amongst the people uh but when he came to Paul it was not part of the pillar of fire it was a complete Pillar of Fire coming to the messenger and he wrote the New Testament but the book was sealed amen all this while the book was sealed now when the pillar of fire returned and appeared again in this end time it was not to write the Bible the Bible has been written but it was to reveal amen the entire book and it became a new book okay so he came in this hour to manifest what has been written and to bring it to life and to make sure that we become the book you are what you eat amen when Ezekiel ate the scroll then the scroll disappeared then Ezekiel became the scroll himself amen you know uh uh uh uh uh back home the olden days the doctors would uh prescribe medicine uh sometimes tablets so then they had uh these little plastic uh bags that they would write on there on those uh take three times a day now this other man he understood it his own way so the doctor gave him uh tablets then he would just take them and hold them like that in the morning put it down afternoon he would do the same thing in the evening the same thing and his health was just deteriorating he went back to the doctor and the doctor looked at him now the doctor knowing what those drugs can do then what he saw and what he knows it was not telling up then he said where are the where are the tablets and when he gave them to him and he started counting there were 30 he gave him 30 and there were still 30 he said but no wonder you are like this he said no doctor it is Rich and take so I would just take them said no you need to drink them so you see so long as he's got the tablets and the tablets are not part of his body part of his system they can't help him amen amen we can have the Bible we can have the message we can have it in all formats so long as we don't take the thing and we don't put it in our souls so long as it's not part of you it won't help you amen so you have to feed on it until you become part of it until flesh becomes wet and wet becomes flesh amen amen then the prophecy is you can stand back and you see the word acting through you there comes a time is no longer an effort to do to to be a Christian the way just EXs through you amen now coming back to this Moses saw the pillar of fire the pillar of fire was sent to Moses Moses was sent to the people so everybody knew that there is a shorter route to the promised land but most Moses himself he also knew that he didn't take that road he took a longer road that goes all the way to the Red Sea H against his own better judgment but he was following the pillar of fire amen the pillar of fire has been sent to Moses and Moses has been sent to the people so Moses is following the pillar of fire they must follow Moses am amen amen I'm sure they were saying hey we wonder today what is really going on here we were supposed to come this way I mean even the sons of Jacob when they went to buy food in Egypt they didn't cross the Red Sea no there is another road but Moses didn't take that one why he was being led by God Amen so he followed the pillar of fire he not a knowing what here is is following the pillar of fire and I'm telling you as we follow the messenger of this day we are also following the pillar of fire am amen amen so they followed Moses and he led them all the way down to the Red Sea brother Brenham says there was a mountain this side and a mountain this side and a and the Sea before them and Pharaoh his heart is hardened he started coming after them he started coming after them when they looked there was just a cloud of dust chiots of fire and I mean Chariots of uh Pharaoh's Army and and and when they came closer and closer and it was not just ordinary men highly trained men and bow and arrows were I mean the bow and arrows you know they were drawn and Target was chosen and and the swords in the air and Spears and everything ready just to Smite and the people said to Moses Moses Moses they never said the pill of fire they said Moses why did you bring us this far we told you this thing won't work were there not better graves in Egypt you see they were seeing Moses they were not seeing the pillar of fire Moses is the one who brought them there but Moses the pillar of fire brought him there am so their complain was against Moses then he said hold your peace keep still the Egyptians that you see you shall see them no more and we know what happened there when Moses cried to God God said why cry speak and he had already spoken the word then God did something great he opened the Red Sea water became a wall to water it was not ice it was water he open the Red Sea not just for two three people no for two million people and their enal so it was quite a big place that got open amen and they walked on dry ground but what I like is this I think I went ahead of myself I should have read something here for you but it's not a problem we can read it yeah in paragraph 3 138 he says God loves to bring you in trouble so when Trouble Comes is not because we've sinned it's not because things have gone wrong and we' have done something wrong the devil will come and tell us those things but the prophet says God loves to bring you in trouble I tell you brother sister this message is not charismatic movement no no no no no no no yeah we we we we see the reality of things now here amen all the time we pray and pray and we want trouble to be away from us but the Propet says God loves to bring you in trouble amen he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it like we said in the morning amen those Brothers of Joseph they hated him and all that it was what he needed that was a blessing for him now here we read something else again God loves to bring you in trouble so while we are here it will be trouble after trouble trial after trial testing after testing the only thing that doesn't love troubles or love challenges is a river when a river flows this way and there's rocks and then it will turn it it will turn it will go this way find some soft spot and then go straight again and just like that but a Christian in it all we have to go through it so he brings us into trouble all of us will have something that we must fight for fight against all of us and you you know brother and sister it even comes to a point no one can help you no one can help you that's why brother Brenham he preached that message contest very few pages I think it's about eight pages or so and it's amazing okay he gave other examples but there's one example that he dwelt much on he says you know if you are a boxer you must know your opponent and whether he leans forward or backwards you know whether he he you know he stands with his foot in front or I mean right foot in front or south or or whatever you know and and all those things he said you have to know that you have to know his punches you know and then you also must train and so on now it's amazing he used that now in boxing you can have a trainer you can have a sparing partner you have all those but once you get in the dream you go in alone you are not going in there with your trainer you're not going there with your sparring partner and so on you go in there alone even the referee will tell you you are all by yourself you must defend yourself you must attack you must you you you must know that you are all by yourself amen am and a Christian you are all by yourself amen amen there Comes A Time you are in this kind of things and and you have to pray it through but says you are going to do some fighting and you're going to do it on your knees not with your feet on your knees amen amen so God loves to bring us into trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing you know March them right out into this place then sent Pharaoh after them see how God likes to do it he loves to display his power and love so it's not just troubles coming no he also wants to display his power and his love he doesn't gamble with the souls of his children no when he brings trouble he wants to flex his muscles now let's read something here let's read few things here let's read something here in First Corinthians I think chapter 10 read something there 1 Corinthians 10:13 there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to men but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that he are able but with uh but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that he may be able to Bear it amen so he brings a a trial a testing he brings you into trouble but he going to make a way amen he's going to make a way this thing is not coming to destroy you it is coming to take you higher amen you know like when the winds are blowing and they are very strong and the winds they keep all the beds from going higher and higher and they must fly low and some of them must just land but the Eagle at that time with those kind of wings goes higher and higher and higher the eagle can Master the wind amen amen so a Christian whatever comes our way God knows he's not going to destroy you though he has brought you into this trouble he has made a way right in the trouble hallu now let's read another thing here in in in something again in Luke 10 verse 19 Luke 10: 19 I it says here behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy amen and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen though he allows trouble to come but nothing by any means amen the devil has got many means but all those means of the devil nothing will hurt you by any means so power over all the power of the enemy amen so even when he brought Israel right down to the Red Sea it was to show them his power Amen to show them his love I tell you brother sister God doesn't want us to look at things as human beings but he wants us to look at things as supernatural beings amen because if we are going to look at things as average human beings we will be discouraged amen but when he brings trouble when he brings all these things we don't have to look at those things as human beings even here they were not supposed to look at those things as average human beings don't think think about Graves don't think about all those things God didn't say you are coming to a grave is is he promised them to take them to a land flowing with milk and honey amen amen so we see here what did he do open the Red Sea there was no time to build a bridge none of them had a sorrow a spear but God was going to do something that is so great amen and he opened the Red Sea and they were marching and what did the pillar of fire do he went right behind Israel amen and he went between the Egyptians the Egyptian Army and the children of Israel now all the strong all the the the the the the the the young they were right in front right at the the back as Israel was marching the old people were right at the back people who can fight for themselves the very weak of Israel was right at the back amen so the strongest of Israel were going to start with the very weak ones of Israel people who won't fight for themselves but God came between the very strong of Egypt and the very weak of Israel amen hallelujah he protected them amen so tonight it doesn't matter how weak we are amen no we don't trust in our own strength we don't trust in our own efforts amen but we trust in God he's a mighty man of battle and he has never lost any battle Hallelujah Lord I don't believe that he will lose it in any of our lives so what a great thing it was amen even in the times of of Peter he said Peter the devil sought you but I've prayed for you fighting battles that Peter doesn't know about I believe that even tonight he goes between us in a lot of things amen you'll never leave us he will never forsake us so they crossed over and when we when they were on the other side then I believe that God said Moses now come here remember what you said the Egyptians that you see you shall see them no more while the Egyptians were in the middle of the sea and their cherot wheels were broken and they were deep in M now it was time for them to be M dobers and they were deep in mud and they can handle the mud and so on then the sea came back to its position they were drowned and and you can imagine what a victory it was there is Taskmaster s and there is another Taskmaster s so they were all dead and floating right there God finished everything until Pharaoh never followed them again amen there was never a time again that pH Pharaoh came after them that's right amen so it was a wonderful thing how Moses held on for them to such a glorious Victory am amen the faith of Moses didn't just take them out it took them in he took them in so tonight let's just look at something again and we close now we find another father in The Book of Job by the name of job very wonderful father it's a very amazing book The Book of Job because there uh we find Satan coming before God maybe he had a list of names and he said to God ah this one says he's a Christian look what he has done this one that one and God said okay but have you ever considered my servant job and to see that there's none like him there's no one that is like him in that whole list of yours ah that one you made you have made a wedge around him it's good to know that Satan even knows that God protects his children amen the devil knows that yes he knows that that we are protected people we had a brother one time preaching to us uh he he was from Congo and he told us something you know that one time uh they had a president there in DRC uh Democratic Republic of Congo and uh by the name of mabutu it was then Z so ma one of his sons came to him he said H dead I want you to buy me this car you know and the father was very cross with him he sent him away and he was angry so he said okay maybe uh today you know he's not so happy something upset him I'll see him some other time so he came next day and father was happy and cheerful he started the subject immediately father became angry again so he was wondering but what's going on ah let me forget about him so he picked up a phone the phone and then he called the bank manager told him I'm the son of the president and I saw this car I want it in this carer and it must be delivered at this time and uh at such a day and he dropped the phone come that day the car was there so he went to the father and he said Dad come and see my then the father was happy said yeah you must do things like that you are a son of of a president not going around and begging and begging and coming to me begging for things you must know who you are I believe God also treats us the same way why cry amen hallelujah why cry amen when we look in the word here and we see all these promises here they all belong to you yes sir brother sister let me shock you regardless of what your life is like regardless of what you have done you have to believe it like Samson when Samson had failed and done everything wrong he still knew that he's a Nazarite and God told him God told the mother of Samson that you don't have to eat this anything that is from the vine you don't have to drink anything from the vine you change your diet because you are going to give back to a Nazarite I believe that's why in the message we had to change the diet we couldn't we can't preach Baptist Doctrine and Methodist and all those we had to change the spiritual diet because we must produce nazarites amen people who are consecrated to God so and and and God told the the the wife of Manoa this one will be a Nazarite from birth to death God knew that there's a Delila he knew everything about Samson but anything that will come will never change that he's not a Nazarite because he took a Nazarite vow he is born a Nazarite amen hallelujah so there Samson we know how he failed you know with hot and with Delilah how he lied to Delilah several times and and and uh but the grace of God was with him you know we fail God a lot of times and even when we fail him and we do these wrong things and so on he doesn't does it mean that we should carry on that way no no it's God's grace to us amen that must never become a habit no but it's just the grace of God you know and and the power of God was still in his life but after he told Delilah the secret and we know his hair was cut then he was out of the word the word was broken and the power left him then he was just an ordinary man pled his eyes out there he was kept captive by the very enemy he was born to destroy then they had this big time they are going to have this uh big celebration uh thanking Dagon for delivering their Enemy Number One Samson into their hands not realizing that this guy he comes from the tribe of den and that tribe of den the emblem of den is Eagle this one is a child of God he's an eagle he can renew his strength he's not down and out no then while he was there and and they they they brought him to make spot imagine the very thing that is supposed to destroy he must entertain it like that's what the church has become not the bride the church yes the very demons that The Church Must cast out and they they they must be under their feet those are the demons they entertaining in the church now amen now Samson he came and he can see them and there he's standing and uh he just as the little boy bring me between the two pillars and uh he still believes that he will have Victory if there was a man who was supposed to be discouraged the Samson he can't see them he can't see his enemy but there he comes between those two pillars he said Lord once more let me die with my enemies he knew very well this time for him to have Victory he must be prepared to die amen amen so a lot of things in our lives can't change until we die to ourselves amen amen when we are willing to come on the Altar and lay that Soul on the altar let the Holy Ghost Fire come and consume the second amen and God change the entire being of the human soul and and and make you a new creature in Christ am until the old things have passed away amen so to pass away it means to die also amen but Samson imagine brother sister standing there he said Lord once more I like the way brother Brenham said it Samson never thought about his failures but bam said he thought about the victories that he had that's the only way you can come back amen we we cannot think about how we failed and how the wrong things we have done once you think like that you can't get higher than that but if we can think of how many prayers we made and they were answered amen how many Souls we led to the Lord how many people we prayed for even as a church those testimonies we must never forget them yes as a Christian you need your memory you must be able to remember amen like if you look in the Psalms of David it's amazing he talks a lot even about victories that were won and he was not there you know he talks about the times of Moses and and and all those times and those victories and he was seeing about those things he was meditating about those things that's why he was the kind of man he was so God help us brother sister so the enemy also is presenting us his staff but we must look in the word that's where our identity is in the message why Christ speak the prophet say the difference between us and Samson is that Samson knew who he was and US half the time we don't know we don't know we don't know he he never thought of how he failed with he fell with Delilah and harot and and all those things and he's lying and all that no no no brother sister I can even say something again here you know you you take Jonah Jonah never obeyed God God said go to n Jonah is going his own way and the fish God prepared it he knew Jonah was going to go that way that fish was already in the sea waiting for him it was a ot looking fish amen you can't even find that one even today am that one was just prepared for Jonah so yeah they start sailing and they're going to Tes and then when they were far from where they came from and still far from where they are going then the Tempest started they throw chicken meat out the fish is not interested beef and all those things and the fish is not interested they offloaded almost the whole ship then the next thing they had to do throw Jonah out that's what the fish wanted am he didn't he didn't uh he didn't you know fist on Jonah no it swalled him amen that's not your shark that's not your killer wave no he just swallowed Jonah am when the fish swallowed Jonah you know and there he is now in the B of A Fish and uh floating and swimming in the in the in the vomit of the fish Jonah said all these are lying vities once again will I look towards the direction of the temple he never even thought I'm in this mess because I disobeyed God no he never even thought about his backslidings he said I I will once again look towards the direction of the temple you know brother brendam says in one of uh those messages when love projects He says you as a child of God you create a situation yes amen we don't just create an atmosphere we also create a situation so here is Jonah in the belly of a fish can we read that very nice very nice very nice let's go to Jonah chapter 2 it's a very nice thing there let's just read Jonah chapter 2 now verse one then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly he didn't jump up and down and pull here and pull there you know we we have what they call toy toing there in South Africa where you just jump on one feet and then you change hey no we never done such things that's a revolutionary you know dance no Jonah never done such things there no no no no no no no what he did he in the pale of a fish he prais to God now let's read verse 10 and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land he's in the bell of a fish he's not trying anything there he speaks to God and God spoke to the fish I like this scripture very much I tell you brother sister it's such an encouragement you know uh children when they are young they they they they they impersonate preachers they they are very spiritual and they but as they grow then Satan comes in and they go through changes and and you know this change and that change and as the prophet says after every seven years there's a change but you know I believe that if you took that child and dedicated that child to the Lord amen and you you you name that child Rejoice amen uh even when times like that comes she still Rejoice she's not the devil she's not a devil she still Rejoice you can speak to the God who created that child am like Jonah he spoke to the god that created the fish the fish has got a Creator so he spoke to the Creator and the Creator spoke to the fish so you can speak to God and God can speak to your boss at work amen yes sir God can speak to your wife God can speak to your children God can speak to these people they are a creation hallelujah amen so Jonah right in the belly of a fish he spoke to God brother Bram says and right in there the vomit went one side and right in there there was oxygen he lived in the bed of a fish for three nights and for three days and three nights because of prayer yes amen right in there he created a situation yes in a situation amen so when we are in a situation is not yet over am no that's why brother says God wants to see what you'll do about it so let's take courage amen so here is on these people they knew who they were Jonah never thought about backslidings and Samson never thought about all those things and that's why things changed so you and I it must be the same thing amen when things go wrong never ever dare say oh I think you know brother there's somewhere where I didn't do right that's why no no no no no no no God loves bringing you into trouble to show his power to show his love so that you can have a testimony also am so that you can have a song Amen after the Red Sea they were singing a song yes they had a song Moses sang in the spirit and they were all dancing and shouting and rejoicing so every trouble that they came in that they came across you realize that the message of that day met any condition amen when they don't have food God gave them food that message supplied food amen when there's no water the message supplied water amen so there's no need that that message didn't Supply it met every condition so now back to the Book of Job and uh we find that this book of job as I said the devil came to God it's amazing the devil is the enemy of God he started he he he caus a split in heaven yes he caused havoc in heaven and uh but God can still speak to the devil amen amen that's right yeah that Satan came to God and they were having a conversation and God said good morning Satan good morning devil where do you come from no you know I was in my business going up and down to and fro in that whole earth and so on okay and yet today some people are Christians they can't talk to someone huh and yet our father can talk to the devil and some of these people we think their seed is just G work we don't know it's not even a gift of discernment is just guess work gift of Suspicion but God knew this one is a devil am the prophet say you know when he talks about Cain in in all the days of our lives that message the prophet says when Cain brought that sacrifice it was not a right sacrifice fruits and all that it was not right he said but God loved him that's why he went to him to correct him to show him how to do it and God knowing very well that this is not my son this is a son of the devil but he still loved him I said my our father he does things in a different way and we are supposed to be like our father amen amen so the devil also visits God his own enemy The Very one who's going to destroy him he still visits him he still goes there and he knocks on his door and God opens the door so if I don't talk to someone I'm worse than the devil then because he's my enemy then I'm worse than Satan I'm worse than oh my God help us amen and these are the things that the enemy brings upon us if you look at it we were not meant to be that way when we were young we could mix with anyone yeah little children they don't know color they don't know all these things and and and and they don't know you know they they fast and fight now but and you give you give them a hiding now you spend them now and it's not long after you know few seconds they are on your lap again and you know and happy and and that's how how how we were that's how we were but as we grow we learn a lot of things we go to school we read a lot of books and and uh complexes come in and this and the other but is not supposed to be that way that's why this message came to teach us one more time to laugh and you know I I I I like the way brother Bram does things he he he brings it to us so simple he makes things simple he says you see uh if you see that your brother is just about going to get the ticket his meter is running low he says just top it up you know it's not only about cars and so on you know if you see there's a need there and a need there do something you know and uh be kind to someone and help here help there the prophecy is as you you are doing that it will grow to Divine love so you can start right in the home you know it's just right in the home you know I must be good to my children and I try to do something for my mom my wife and you know uh somebody in the church and and so on and and as you do those things it grows to Divine love then I realize my that's something it's not a difficult thing that you know it's not a difficult thing it's not a difficult thing a new convert comes in I I can you know try and do something for that one you know uh uh uh visit him pray with him and you know encourage him encourage her whoever she they are you know it grows and grows and grows to Divine love it's not a question of now I must see hey but they are not visiting me I must be visiting people even if they don't come to my home I must go to them amen you know and and you just continue like that and it grows it will never stay like that it will grow to Divine love where you are able to love and even love our bitterest enemy amen now you know like in the Book of Job the challenges of job it was not losing his Kettle and and all those things no no no no no no yes that was trouble but God loved bringing him into that trouble he allowed the devil to come and do all those things and job stood in all that he never sinned against God he just worshiped God but the greatest test of them all it was right at the end right in the for the second chapter of job where God now said to those people to elant and his friends I will never hear your prayers go to job he must pray for you only him will I accept imagine now he must come and intercede for this guys who were finding fault with him all these years amen that was the greatest test brother bam says it like this in adoption he says Grace is not I scratch you scratch my back and I scratch your back he says Grace is I scratch your B whether you scratch mine or not it doesn't matter I scratch your B then he goes F he says you smack me while he still hting and you say hey my back needs scratching so while I'm nursing the pain I scratch your back now that's something these people never said to Job we sorry he's still nursing the pain of all the words and and and all the things and so on and I mean one place job said for how long will these vain words continue you know you are miserable Physicians you know so they were not saying anything good they were not helping him no while he still hting he must scatch their back he must pray for them so it takes the grace of God to for us to do that amen and and I know you know it just takes us to heal and surrender the more we surrender the more God is taking us to that place yes for now it sounds like it's impossible no don't worry when God has put you to that spot he will allow a situation to come and you will do it exactly that way you will just do it the grace of God will be enough for you sufficient for you he won't allow a trial that is above your faith it will be something that you will be able to master so it was not a hard thing job was able to do it and I believe we can can also do it yes amen amen now job one other thing about him he had children braim says in few messages in that message God's approach he says there were worldly children but job offered an extra sacrifice for them as a father just in case they've sinned against God and they were together drinking wine having a party they all died
