[Music] [Music] the house of the lord [Music] genesis chapter 1 and verse 26. genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 genesis and god said let us make man in our image after our kindness after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female he created he and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over this fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the earth [Music] amen want to focus on the part that says and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air in every living thing that move it upon the i want to speak on this subject uh restoration of the abstract to the title amen this will sound more like part two of the sermon that i praised someone some time ago when we're reading in the book of genesis we realize god created man and he said let us make man in our image after our likeness you know amen the image that he was talking about it is not this flesh because the prophet of god tells us that this flesh is just an animal but the image that you god created you in the image that god created you and me he was talking about the spirit man the spirit man that is within you that's what god make like unto himself so we don't rely on this flesh because this flesh is not the real us but the spirit within us that's the real actual you is the spirit within you that god made after his own image did you have increased and after he created adam and give put the he he breathed the spirit man into the body and he was he was giving adam the authority over everything he had created when god finished creation he left a little bit for adam because he was in the same image as god was when adam say you are an elephant god said amen and that's what it was adam had authority over over nature he had authority over the atmosphere because that was the authority that was handed to him by god that's the dominion he was given domination it's a record of any property that you have that shows all the people that were handed to it throughout all the ages it says it contains all the historical transfers that ever happened in a property it shows the property's ownership as far as back then as it goes and the abstract gives you the authority to the title deeds gives you authority to exercise all the rights the title deed has and this dominion and authority that adam was given that was the abstract to the title amen but as we know in the book of genesis adam and eve sinned i don't ever be pushy and when adam and eve sinned we know adam will uh sinned willingly and when they sinned he lost the abstract to the title wanted to get a hold of it but god took it back into his hands and he was waiting for the right time to give it back into the hands of man because that's what it was created for you that was that's what it was meant for for the sons of god to use it so he was god was holding it back until man had it would only take another atom to come and claim it back and put back the authority in the hands of the actual people who needs it amen that's why when adam sinned what up god god gave a prophecy and said they shall be the seed of the woman that shall bruise the head of the serpent and there was none other than jesus christ amen and he said i'll put enmity between the serpent and the woman and the seed of the woman god beforehand he was already creating a way back for the title deed to get back into the hands of the sons of god [Music] the prophet of god in the british between the seven chage ages and the seven seals he says now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back right to its original honor amen god himself sitting on the throne with the title deed in his hands adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith so after adam lost the title did the abstract to he had no dominion over the things that god had given him to control he could not tell the the river to flow in a different direction because they had lost the title deed absolutely and that's when they started uh thorns and tissues started growing up i saw a grandiose and we snow started coming down what we're still struggling with today that was because of the fall because adam forfeited the title dead amen men were being ravaged by satan and god kicked adam and eve out of the garden of eden did you ever see adoring them amen and the earth was cursed nature was cursed because of men's disobedience because he was given rulership over everything that god had created amen so this sin accumulated a debt over this title deed accumulate debt in debt so for the title d to be returned back to the original owner a debt has to be paid a man who was worthy to come and pay this debt so that the title did could go back to the original owner for the title to come back into the hands of the sons of god it shows everything that was ever against the piece of ground has been stricken off so there was to be found a man who was worthy to pay that debt off so that the book could be handed back into the hands of man for all the 4 000 years of men's existence there was no prophet or no man who was worthy to pay this debt we have all the great prophets elijah moses isaiah jeremiah and all of them [Music] but no one was found worthy to come and pay that debt amen amen but god created a way back and his own son and called him jesus and he himself stepped into him and his son jesus had to come and pay that debt amen so he created him so he could come and redeem it back pay the debt off the the abstract to the title and place it back in the hands of man amen and we are told the prophet of god tells us that jesus was a hundred percent god and a hundred percent man he was not fifty he was not a fifty percent man and fifty percent god did the person comfortable but he was all god and he was all man he was all men so he could feel whatever you go through hey man he was old man so he could feel all the sicknesses you go through he was all men so he could understand the depression that you go through but he was god enough to deliver you out of them all amen there is nothing that god jesus could not relate to he even feels how he knows how it feels to feel to to feel rejected he was rejected by the very same people he came to save his purpose his mission was to come and redeem humanity but those same people he came to redeem they they decided to go for for a murderer and and they'd say kill him remember and he also knows how it feels to be rejected by god because when he was going to the cross when he was at the cross god left him that's why he said my father why hast thou forsaken me when he was in the garden of gethsemane he was crying lord if it was possible i would let this cup pass but because on his mind he saw you he saw that you needed to be saved if there was no cross you and me would have been in hell but because he had you on his mind he said nevertheless i will do it he was paying off the debt that was on the abstract to the title hey man when he was hanging on the cross and he cried it is finished he was saying father i've accomplished the assignment i have to pay the debt and now i can go and put it back in the hands of man amen so because he paid the debt you and me don't have to live under our own privileges we gotta walk into all the full promises of god we gotta walk into our full potential because you said it is finished and the devil the accuser cannot put it on you because you say you never done it in the first place so whatever he has on you is accused back to the devil and he came when he came to take that book and shed his blood he forgave the sins of all the sages when they were sacrificing bulls and gods the he forgave the sins of abraham that's why paul said abraham was perfect people gave the sin of david although we know what david did he mentioned but god comes and says he's a man after my own heart why because he wiped away all his sins away the sins of the thief on the cross the prophet of god says that men never went to church any one day he probably hello bye the sins of the old testament saints [Music] but he forgave that's why he was willing to pay the price so he paid for the sins that you were going to commit before you were even born so he cleaned them all out and he paid for the sins that you're going to do from today on onwards because you are a son of god there is no sin that can be imputed to you you accomplish amen so do not allow anyone to go with a long fish pole to try and fish it from the sea forgetfulness if god cannot do it what is men who is men that has the right to go and fish it out amen so long you are right with god hello just like you know that you are blameless you are sinless visitor because he chose you before the foundation of the world amen that's what he did when he came to pay for that debt [Music] so he took back that book he took the abstract to the title and he handed it back to man the first time we saw it in demonstration was at the day of pentecost where the holy spirit came down and filled all of the disciples and they left from their performing miracles it was given back to peter and all the disciples amen so it had to take that second adam a man who was not born was not was not born of many because we know that jesus was placed into the warm of mary he was if brother branham stayed if god used the egg of mary and the gene to to fuse the two to to make but he said mary had nothing contributed to it god pleased god pleased everything after it was already done into the worm of mary that's why jesus was neither jew nor gentile but we still have people arguing today saying some say jesus was was jewish something he was the son of god made by god himself amen so he came and he took back the abstract to the title and placed it back into the hands of man who no one else was worthy to do it but jesus himself we see in the book of revelations the prophet of god tells us that revelations is a book of symbols and we see everything already playing out there in the book of revelations and revelations chapter five verse one it says appreciate people and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside filled with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribal judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals seven seals thereof amen no one else was worthy but jesus christ himself it's just she's a christian amen so i was looking at this verse and says one of the elders said unto me and i realized those john represents the bride and those 24 elders john john was one of those 24 elders so he was seeing his theory when he was looking and seeing those 24 elders he was seeing himself he had a representation already in heaven before the foundation of the world he when he created the seraphim's cherubims and angels you were already there when he said let there be light you were already there with him when he created the whole universe you were there on the back part of his mind you're an attribute of god you just cannot remember because when you were born and came on this earth you had amnesia amen and if you're a bride you have the your name in the lamp section of the book of life [Music] for each and every one of us and when he died he went down to hell and he came and he overcame satan in his own kingdom amen and when he rose up he rose up triumphantly and he emptied paradise all abraham and david and all the saints of old were in paradise locked in there they couldn't come out but after he shed his blood after he acclaimed back the book he took them out they were all raptured and put them into the sixth dimension amen that's why the power of taking back the abstract and putting it back into the hands of men dead you say what does abstract mean amen and he was talking about sin and he said it's just like that drop of ink when you strike the bleach it's a common and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of jesus christ you did not become a son of god but you only came to a realization that you were a son of god its redemption means all legal possessions to all that was lost by adam and eve amen all the legal possessions means you possess everything that adam and eve lost so adam lost that abstract to the title men could not get back the authority the dominion that they had then jesus came and paid the debt to the abstract of the title oh jesus that redemption allowed authority to come back into you amen and we thank god for the prophet william branham amen he made us understand the contents of this book and he was of all the prophets he was the tallest of them all and his eyes could trace it all the way back from whence it originated so he's the one who came and told us about the abstract paul just had a snapshot of it and he said we were chosen before the foundation of the world but when william branham came on the scene with the full revelation of the world he saw the creation of the sun and the universe amen how before angels were even created we were there so because of that we know where we came from we walk around knowing amen and we thank jesus christ because he was the only one who was able to do it for us amen so it doesn't matter how you were born on this earth because when you were born in this earth you were born with amnesia you cannot remember what happened before the foundation of the world [Music] it doesn't matter where you were born where you were born doesn't determine your destiny it doesn't matter what your background is so long your name is in the book that you have already made when you become a christian and accept christ it shows that no matter what your father did your mother how much a human body is worth so the 16 elements that make up the human body in their quantities they amount to 600 dollars yes the flesh that you try to take care of so much it's only worth 600 dollars all the trying that you do and everything you do it's just six hundred dollars i'm not saying you should stop taking care of it now amen but god took those elements that are worth six hundred dollars and he created you and they say if we try to sell a human body and i believe no one is going to do this if you sell a human body it's worth half of a million dollars so god was able to appreciate that six hundred dollars to five hundred thousand dollars amen that's how much this flesh is worth but your flesh is worth more than that although it is made of this of this dust of the earth and the 16 elements paul told us that we are a temple of the almighty god you know you not that you are a temple of the almighty god god wants to use your hands god wants to use your lips he wants to use your feet amen so when you walk you gotta walk cognizant knowing that i'm a housing deity but much more than that is your soul worth i believe in conference brother branham said your soul is worth more than a tenth out more than ten thousand words that's why satan is trying to that's why satan is trying to distract you and get you for himself because you know he knows how much you're worth amen but never sell yourself short you gotta walk around knowing that i'm worth more than ten thousand words that's why jesus paid his blood for you because you are worth that much to him amen you are worth much more than the universe so don't let anyone else try to lower you down or walk down trodden amen but we thank god that our souls he saw them worthy to have that abstract it's not because we are smart or we are good in any way but it's because of amazing grace amen that he saw that you were worthy amen and it is our duty that we take that abstract and we use it in the way that god wants us to because we have a mandate with that book we are not just going to keep it and walk around with it we gotta use it because it was placed in your hands for you and me to use go and take that little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stand it upon the sea and upon the earth amen this was john he was being told go take that book from the hands of the angel just don't leave it dormant there but you got to take it for yourself and he was told to take it and eat it upon amen and by eating it we gotta leave what the word says for that abstract of the title to be in effect hey man that book was not meant for god to keep it was meant for you and me to use amen when he opened up the seals he gave it to john representing the bride which was you and me amen and through the hearing of the message through the hearing of the word you saw your name in that book you heard your name being called when you listened to this message it is not meant for everyone but those that god chose before the foundation of the world in each and every age there are people who hear the message of the hour yeah other people cannot comprehend what that is to them it's noise do you remember the days of paul when god spoke to paul the other people just had thunder but paul had a voice because he was meant for him so other people may not understand this message and it's just a lot of confusing things because it's not meant for them to understand but you and me we aim in each and every word of god because you just came to the realization by the listening of this word and you believed it amen jeremiah says god told jeremiah that i knew you before you were in your mother's womb so he was already in existence in god's mind before he was born amen and the world is waiting in earnest expectation for the manifestations of the sons of god nature knows that we have a rulership over us and romans 8 19 tells us that creature wait for the manifestation of the sons of god amen nature means having men talking to it because that was god's original plan amen and we know the title comes in with the deadpool ministries it was a sign that as you have seen him doing this giving back life to that little fish because the authority had been brought back into the sons of god so you and me we have the same power too to speak to nature to speak to our circumstances because we have the abstract to the title back in our hands so we don't have to work not knowing who we are so we have that inheritance that was our inheritance placed back into our hands amen the prophet of god talks about this analogy he says now our kinsman is handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original honor um it is is the title deed of redemption that's our title deeds he breaks the seals reveals and gives us the inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming the king's redeemer your if you have if your family had land for me and you happen to be in exile for for a certain reason and someone comes in and to stay on that they land their property and put things over there it doesn't matter how much appreciation they did to the land or how long they stayed there if you come with an abstract to the title that's written your name on it you have the right to tell those people to walk out of your land you have to you have the right to get the land restored back to you because your name is on the title deed amen the prophet is telling us that everything that god owned it's for us to use so you have the right to walk up to satan and say satan get out of here this is my land good health is yours about you got a right to walk to satan and say satan get away from my health this is my inheritance if you have a lost loved one that you want to claim the salvation you have the right to walk to satan and say satan let go because you have your god-given rights the holy spirit will enforce it because it is your name is written on the deed amen so no weapon formed against you shall prosper the bible says that's an inheritance so you're able to go claim it and say nothing that the devil said against me will ever prosper let us stand up on our feet [Applause] we thank god for the opening of the seals we thank god for the cross we thank god for protesting our salvation amen because we would have been lost but because he decided to come down and he was willing to shed his blood we are more than conquerors and we have the title deed back in our hand we can walk in back and tell satan to get off our property you can tell satan to walk away from your family because that is your inheritance you can tell satan to walk away amen we are thankful for the blood [Music] my profile you are more than enough for me jay over [Music] i've been set you are with me lord you supply all of my knees [Applause] you are more than enough so much more than enough you are more than enough for me jehovah jairus [Music] my provider you are more than enough for me [Music] [Music] i've been [Applause] [Music] you are with me lord you are more than enough so much more than enough you are more than enough for me or j oversight you are with me you supply all my needs you are more than enough so much more than enough you are more than enough lord you are with me [Music] you are more than enough so much more that enough you are more than enough oh you are more you supply all my needs lord you heal me oh lord you delivered me you are more than enough so much more [Music] lord you are so much more than enough [Music] there is nothing more that we can say [Music] you forgive all our sins and our iniquities [Music] [Music] i pray your father that you stretch out your hand to them lord just for them to realize that you already done it because on that day on calvary you said it is finished [Music] things that we cannot bear the shows give us the strength and the remembrance just to say it is finished because you did it for us
