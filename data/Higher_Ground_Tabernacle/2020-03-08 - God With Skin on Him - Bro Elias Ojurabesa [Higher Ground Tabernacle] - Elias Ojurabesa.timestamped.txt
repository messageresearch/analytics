[51:38] weekend you know it's kind of all over
[51:41] amen
[51:42] so it just just cities as the desert to
[51:45] the g-seven cost me we just add you know
[51:48] I want to return our scriptures Book of
[51:51] Luke chapter 4 if you see me talking to
[51:55] files just tell me slow down
[51:59] Luke chapter 4 verse 16
[52:07] you know the preaching of the word is
[52:09] not something you're gonna ever get
[52:11] comfortable doing you know you even if
[52:14] you didn't for years and years sometimes
[52:15] your nurse said him and he is like oh
[52:17] Lord iversity you know but if we can
[52:19] just let go of ourselves and let the
[52:21] Lord up as well you know and it will be
[52:23] done we strongly speak to us look forth
[52:27] 16 to 21 if you just say Amen I when it
[52:33] came to Nazareth where he had been
[52:34] brought up and as his custom was he went
[52:37] to synagogue on the Sabbath day and
[52:40] stood up for to read and there was
[52:42] delivered unto Him the book of Isaiah
[52:44] saw the Prophet Isaiah's
[52:45] and he had opened the book he found the
[52:47] place where it was written the Spirit of
[52:50] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[52:53] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[52:55] poor he has sent me to heal the
[52:58] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[53:00] the captives and recovering of sight to
[53:03] the blind to set at liberty them that
[53:05] are bruised to pretty acceptable year of
[53:08] the Lord and I closed the book and it
[53:12] gave it again to the minister and sat
[53:15] down and the eyes of all them that were
[53:17] in the synagogue was fastened on him
[53:18] when I have our seat I have one more
[53:22] Bible book I want us to read but one
[53:25] thing that really caught my attention
[53:26] and this massive just read was that from
[53:31] the time this prophecy was given by
[53:34] Prophet Isaiah's nobody nobody openly no
[53:40] prophet other than as a as a referent a
[53:44] scripture because he was not concerning
[53:46] them at all it wasn't meant for them and
[53:49] then Jesus came because he knew his
[53:52] purpose he knew his role in the world he
[53:55] had a revelation of his call in his
[53:58] ministry and he went directly and I read
[54:00] from that part he didn't finish it
[54:02] because he wasn't supposed to finish it
[54:05] he knew what his ministry was all about
[54:07] and acts three chapters except the three
[54:10] verse one
[54:23] and I love the book of Acts because it's
[54:26] the only book in the New Testament that
[54:27] I did not finish with an Amen because he
[54:31] still a continuous process
[54:32] he still being written program said the
[54:35] Bride of Christ is the conjugation of
[54:36] the book of Acts amen
[54:38] actually three one two six and now Peter
[54:41] and John went up together into the
[54:43] temple of the out and at the hour of
[54:44] prayer being the ninth hour and the
[54:47] setting man lame from his mother's womb
[54:50] was carried on the late daily at the
[54:52] gate of the temple which is called
[54:53] beautiful and axe arms of them that
[54:57] entered in the temple was st. Peter and
[55:01] John about to go in the temple axe and
[55:05] axe and noms
[55:07] I'm Peter fastened his eyes upon him
[55:09] with John said look on us
[55:11] he gave heed unto them expecting to
[55:13] receive something now this guy had an
[55:15] expectation and it was expected
[55:19] something just like I was supposed to be
[55:21] when we come to the house of the Lord we
[55:23] come to expectation you know where
[55:24] Isaiah Brooks were saying that is
[55:25] afternoon I said when I go to church I'm
[55:27] full of expectation and you don't get if
[55:30] you didn't receive you had an
[55:32] expectation but his expectation was not
[55:35] met you know sometimes we can get really
[55:37] comfortable in their situation their
[55:39] condition and the expectation is limited
[55:41] to their condition you know I've come
[55:44] across you know beggars in the street a
[55:46] tax for harms you know hey can I get a
[55:49] doll I just want to buy lunch and they
[55:50] offer them to buy food and I get mad at
[55:52] you you happen to put Aaron this guy was
[55:54] an accident for money was like can I get
[55:56] get some food down I was so money on buy

[56:05] to this guy he was pissed
[56:07] it took it was really married to big the
[56:09] breakfast and threw it in the trash
[56:11] I want money but you say one breakfast
[56:14] you know his expectation was not what
[56:17] they got eating it to eat but what it
[56:20] what it asks for what it was a spectrum
[56:22] was not what he was getting but what he
[56:25] was expecting it was not his need he
[56:27] needed deliverance and the same thing
[56:30] needs to eat but he was it was cut up in
[56:32] spirit of drugs and the same as this guy
[56:34] I can
[56:35] this guy being that guy I'll put it up
[56:38] that was a good bit of Aaron and his
[56:40] expectation was to get some money but
[56:43] they ain't got it
[56:44] the impedence said Silvan good I have
[56:47] none but as such as I am a give D in the
[56:50] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[56:53] and walk
[56:54] your expectation is always gonna be met
[56:56] by God you know the more expectation you
[57:00] have the more you get from God so
[57:02] tonight briefly I want to exhort us on a
[57:04] tongue on a topic God was keen on him
[57:07] you know God was keen on him you know I
[57:14] really cool why is getting that ready
[57:16] program sir there's nothing that would
[57:18] defeat Satan there's never been nothing
[57:21] on earth yet that would ever defeat the
[57:24] devil like the Word of God he said Jesus
[57:26] used it in this great battle he said it
[57:28] is written you know this is an image
[57:31] right I can access any one in the room
[57:32] tell me who this person is and then the
[57:35] best we can do the best we can do is try
[57:39] to figure out who has a shape of head
[57:41] and we start looking at how we can make
[57:43] all that guess we want because we this
[57:46] is not our image we didn't scare this
[57:47] it's not now my we have no preconception
[57:50] of what this is but the artist the
[57:55] person does make drawing the image knows
[57:57] what he's trying to accomplish it knows
[57:59] exactly who is trying to draw and this
[58:02] is what our out I would I would I would
[58:06] say God was in the beginning there was
[58:09] no face on him it was not a God he was
[58:11] just accept itself existing one and it
[58:14] longs for fellowship you bursted got a
[58:17] lungful fellowship so bad and he tried
[58:20] to figure out how to do it you know
[58:22] enjoy the creation he had he enjoyed
[58:25] everything but he just so longed for a
[58:27] mock for a bigger fellowship you wanted
[58:29] to fellowship he wants to feel what man
[58:31] was feeling and then that pushed him to
[58:34] create man he said in Genesis chapter
[58:37] chapter 1 he says and let us make man
[58:39] now on image chapter 3 excuse me and he
[58:42] created man in his own image but still
[58:46] there was no face on him
[58:48] the prophets of old the Saints of old
[58:51] didn't they know his voice you can tell
[58:54] this is God's talking but how can you so
[58:57] much fall in love with somebody every
[58:59] system so much without seeing their face
[59:02] you know you're just like a young
[59:04] mother's trying to get married I was
[59:05] trying to get married and I was praying
[59:08] to the Lord for you for you're a bride
[59:09] in and now you know people would give me
[59:13] more sort of advices and all that we
[59:15] were trying to like much make I'll go to
[59:16] conventions lay every sin that sister
[59:18] and you know I was sharing the words
[59:20] last night but that wasn't what I wanted
[59:24] that wasn't what I wanted because I
[59:26] believe there has to be a physical
[59:28] attraction it has to be a physical
[59:31] attraction you know and sometimes God is
[59:34] going to tell you suppose this is your
[59:35] this is your spouse it's well verdant
[59:37] for you sometimes it doesn't happen that
[59:38] way but there was no attraction you know
[59:41] a and this people know just man could
[59:44] only relate with God so far because they
[59:49] couldn't see him Moses would love to see
[59:51] God he said God can I see your face if
[59:54] he knew his presence he knows his voice
[59:56] like the back of his head but he wanted
[59:58] to see girls face and it's a god Kenny
[1:00:01] please put his keen on yourself I'm a
[1:00:05] spirit you can't see me you can't stand
[1:00:08] it and God God was passivated and the
[1:00:11] expectation of Moses and said okay go
[1:00:14] stand on the other side at the back of
[1:00:16] the rock and I to yourself and I'll
[1:00:17] reveal myself what Moses saw was this
[1:00:21] sketch he couldn't see this because
[1:00:25] there was no skin on you Moses could not
[1:00:29] see the face of God he saw the back of
[1:00:31] God and he almost was overwhelmed when a
[1:00:33] god of the mountain it was said Moses we
[1:00:36] don't want us don't look at us just turn
[1:00:38] your back and talk to us because it was
[1:00:40] so engulfed by the partial glory of God
[1:00:44] and you know in in Genesis chapter 2 God
[1:00:47] gave man his word and man was charged
[1:00:52] with the task to pull its keen on his
[1:00:55] word
[1:00:55] god I'd given man dominion over
[1:00:57] everything in the garden everything even
[1:01:01] Bream say they said I can imagine God
[1:01:04] accident am Adam to to name the animals
[1:01:07] because Adam was part of God so he could
[1:01:10] name the animals Algar one them to be
[1:01:12] named there was no one animal that Eden
[1:01:15] missed he actually named an alga want
[1:01:18] him to be named and they gave him
[1:01:20] dominion and power one of them to become
[1:01:23] an explorer the power has given to them
[1:01:25] Idol oh yeah I'm just gonna take my time
[1:01:28] tonight and you know we find out along
[1:01:31] the line because in Chapter three that
[1:01:33] even believe the word just like our
[1:01:35] husband deed
[1:01:36] just like many people come to church
[1:01:37] today be sick husband believes the word
[1:01:39] the sister believes the world but when
[1:01:42] it comes to the part of putting the skin
[1:01:44] on the world that's what the problem is
[1:01:46] the devil is fine with you quoting the
[1:01:49] world it's fun watching quotes in the
[1:01:51] sermon book that seals a nod and a shout
[1:01:53] all the mysteries it's fine but when it
[1:01:55] comes to the part of you put in the skin
[1:01:57] on that word he has a problem and and he
[1:02:01] failed in the book of Genesis chapter
[1:02:04] three are putting the skin on the world
[1:02:07] all that she needed was when it ever
[1:02:10] approached her to put a skin on that
[1:02:11] word and there was not gonna come with
[1:02:14] you cube based on what you don't know
[1:02:16] he's gonna use familiar places it's
[1:02:19] gonna lose you the things you know he
[1:02:21] knows we have comfortable yet we have
[1:02:23] confidence in the world so he's gonna
[1:02:25] use the word that's what it's going to
[1:02:27] use and that was very con is a chronic
[1:02:30] bastard that guy he projects is a
[1:02:36] conception of God to us because when he
[1:02:40] went to eat he said I've got not said
[1:02:42] God saw me I would go tell you not to
[1:02:46] eat of that tree because he doesn't want
[1:02:47] you to be like you
[1:02:48] that was his own conception of God but
[1:02:52] if you have known better because Brabham
[1:02:55] said in the cool of the evening the the
[1:02:57] the Lord would descend
[1:02:58] fellowship with Adam and Eve so she
[1:03:01] should have known better
[1:03:03] but she failed I putting the skin on the
[1:03:05] world but aware that you failed the
[1:03:08] second even fail because we have a
[1:03:10] commission to put his skin on God and
[1:03:12] the Word of God has been revealed to us
[1:03:14] in this last day to put a skin on God
[1:03:16] hallelujah
[1:03:18] the word has given to us today is not
[1:03:21] given toes to decorate ourselves I'm a
[1:03:23] grown up you got a message believe us
[1:03:25] you do not even miss a bit of ourselves
[1:03:27] you're gonna see the big pillar of fire
[1:03:29] the pyramids those things are ok but our
[1:03:32] just images what as the image is done to
[1:03:35] you so we have shelves or summer books
[1:03:38] and they will brag about how many summer
[1:03:40] books the avenir in here in India on
[1:03:43] their shelves and it's way more than
[1:03:45] that I grew up seeing ministers come to
[1:03:48] the police with suitcase of summer books
[1:03:50] and they will quote sermons after
[1:03:52] Salmons after Salmons after Salmons but
[1:03:55] where was the life you know if my men
[1:03:58] even read the story the programmer said
[1:03:59] about that guy that could not read it
[1:04:02] just got converted and his daughter was
[1:04:04] gonna have a party in the house if she
[1:04:05] was gonna carry on a warden I said daddy
[1:04:06] you all is crummy ok I need you to be
[1:04:09] quiet I'm gonna put you up in the Arctic
[1:04:10] and do say a word I'm gonna have my
[1:04:12] friends over you said ok it's fine he
[1:04:16] said I'm gonna take the Bible word for
[1:04:18] me cuz whenever either Bible you answer
[1:04:19] just scream but one other good time he
[1:04:21] said go ahead
[1:04:23] she thought she got a guy but true
[1:04:26] believer I would see God in everything
[1:04:29] she gave me she gave my dad I'm a drug
[1:04:32] graphic book
[1:04:33] y'all on the story and the guy was in
[1:04:36] the Artic just was flipping through the
[1:04:38] pages flip them to pretties
[1:04:40] and it screamed and you thought I was
[1:04:43] shocked like wow I didn't give him his
[1:04:45] Bible I have his Bible what made a guy
[1:04:47] scream he saw God in geography Alleluia
[1:04:51] he saw God in geography and I true child
[1:04:53] of God was see God in every circumstance
[1:04:55] never tries any trouble they go through
[1:04:57] they will see God in him amen problem of
[1:05:00] the people today is the lack of
[1:05:01] vulnerability to the word when the word
[1:05:04] is coming forth we start
[1:05:06] dividing the wood but not rightfully if
[1:05:09] I was to rightfully divided world we
[1:05:11] start divided with all that is for
[1:05:12] brother Paul that is for sister Nancy
[1:05:15] that is for Webber brother Sam that is
[1:05:18] what that sister that's for that brother
[1:05:20] and then people screaming shadow most a
[1:05:22] Matt they say Amen on your behalf
[1:05:24] because they knows something about you
[1:05:27] but the moment it was started striking
[1:05:29] that condition they keep quiet I don't
[1:05:31] see the church so many times away so
[1:05:33] many times and it gets the guests are
[1:05:35] comfortable their image was loud glory
[1:05:37] brothers preach they become from pooping
[1:05:39] on Bank on the public for the moment
[1:05:41] start talking about the condition just
[1:05:43] sit down get quiet
[1:05:44] where was the Amen that's right because
[1:05:48] people just did they prefer to
[1:05:50] rightfully divide a world for other
[1:05:51] people when the world is coming I don't
[1:05:54] care about my brother at that time I
[1:05:57] don't care about nobody at that time I
[1:05:58] gotta focus on me because he's talking
[1:06:00] to me
[1:06:00] I got a personal personalized a would've
[1:06:02] done for me and make it a reality
[1:06:05] because you know you know when my wife
[1:06:07] is talking to me
[1:06:08] I don't need y'all listening to what I'm
[1:06:09] saying with my wife when I'm talking to
[1:06:12] my wife nobody this is what I'm saying
[1:06:14] what anybody else is saying because this
[1:06:17] is for this message is for she has to
[1:06:19] personalize it
[1:06:20] that's why I do what I've got calls for
[1:06:22] separation and that's why before God can
[1:06:25] do with a man gotta separate that man
[1:06:26] first because of distraction Alleluia
[1:06:33] you know like I said our problem is lack
[1:06:36] of vulnerability Eve was vulnerable to
[1:06:38] the wrong thing she was vulnerable to
[1:06:42] what is suffering not to say instead of
[1:06:45] the word you know she was porous and she
[1:06:48] was she was the weaker weaker link that
[1:06:51] the devil could use but Braun said
[1:06:53] someone know he knew better than to
[1:06:54] approach Adam because Adam was part of
[1:06:58] God it wasn't part of God so he knew who
[1:07:03] to attack and the problem said as well
[1:07:07] I'm gonna hide myself a glass a he said
[1:07:09] um I said Adam did not fall so he didn't
[1:07:13] fall he knew what the word was but you
[1:07:16] have to stand in line in the gap for his
[1:07:18] wife because he knew that
[1:07:20] if he doesn't do that God is gonna
[1:07:22] destroy her because she was not part of
[1:07:23] him but in you go would not destroy him
[1:07:26] so he stood in the gap Alleluia
[1:07:30] no question - where does this kid ever
[1:07:33] at all it does not scare him we conclude
[1:07:36] his triplets evenly never call the
[1:07:37] scriptures to Jesus when he was on on
[1:07:40] the mountain it knows how to do it
[1:07:43] and that's why sometimes I don't like on
[1:07:46] social media or even in person I don't
[1:07:47] like getting myself involved in in in
[1:07:51] scriptural debates that's not what
[1:07:53] they're called us to do because we have
[1:07:56] so much intellectuals that would defeat
[1:07:57] our intellects they've studied the Bible
[1:08:01] back to back they know everything about
[1:08:03] it but the problem is that it's already
[1:08:06] knowledge form onto the light of God
[1:08:09] strike that seed in your heart it's
[1:08:11] gonna become a regular book so that
[1:08:14] garden comes to defend the word he
[1:08:17] caught us to become the world and Eve
[1:08:19] failed at that part of becoming the
[1:08:21] world
[1:08:21] Alleluia you know God given Dominion
[1:08:25] that was Genesis 1:26 given dominion
[1:08:29] over everything everything you know
[1:08:33] meaning that they had a right to do
[1:08:35] whatever they want if it if I don't
[1:08:38] return the money I doesn't like his view
[1:08:40] he can change his view Mountain move to
[1:08:42] the west I need to see under city song
[1:08:45] song sunrise he could do all of that
[1:08:48] that power you know and and and it was
[1:08:53] it was it was it was I believe God would
[1:08:55] wake up the money I mean you would watch
[1:08:57] us you know wake up in the morning just
[1:08:58] admire his creation so yeah you don't
[1:09:01] know the right thing son you exploring
[1:09:03] the pop given to you which is what God
[1:09:05] wants us to do God give them dominion
[1:09:08] Genesis 1:26 right quick
[1:09:34] my Bibles pretty near so I can't I have
[1:09:37] like I can flip the pages right
[1:09:44] yeah Genesis 1:26 he said then God said
[1:09:49] let us make my now only meeting our
[1:09:50] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:09:52] all the fish of the sea over the fowl of
[1:09:54] the air and the cattle and over the
[1:09:56] earth and over every creeping thing you
[1:09:58] intrepid thing that creepeth upon the
[1:10:00] earth and God couldn't man in his own
[1:10:02] image and he made of God clearly eat you
[1:10:05] know male and female created he them and
[1:10:08] God bless them multiply them I said and
[1:10:10] blessings and God said let them be
[1:10:12] fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:10:13] earth and subdue it
[1:10:14] so in essence God given Dominion control
[1:10:17] power over everything but if you look
[1:10:21] closely at a picture of what happened in
[1:10:23] Genesis chapter 3 Eve was deceived by a
[1:10:27] lower harder
[1:10:31] the shopping was also part of the
[1:10:33] Dominion that God gave them that was in
[1:10:38] lower order she was deceived by the
[1:10:40] lower order and she failed to you to lie
[1:10:44] the dominant God had given them rabbits
[1:10:48] is one shot she's a thousand two shot
[1:10:50] chased 10,000 if you like look at the
[1:10:52] ratio one thousand to ten thousand I was
[1:10:55] at possible because there's power unity
[1:10:58] and you failed like the women of this
[1:11:03] generation to ID under the headship of
[1:11:05] her husband she Club easily brought his
[1:11:09] suffering over to our husband but she
[1:11:12] didn't do that and that's the simple way
[1:11:15] it is today in our generation with even
[1:11:17] sisters in the church the Word of God is
[1:11:21] the absolute garden commanding man to
[1:11:24] listen to the woman you need now we have
[1:11:26] to balance it well what brother did he
[1:11:28] just say that that wasn't God's
[1:11:30] commandment there's no way in the
[1:11:31] scriptures that says listen to your own
[1:11:34] wives but you have to balance it it's a
[1:11:38] row the woman has to play
[1:11:40] she's an ALP me and what is the function
[1:11:43] for help me support you don't know it
[1:11:47] all well the other hand he also have to
[1:11:49] see that four out of the five senses God
[1:11:51] gave man he's in the head you could see
[1:11:55] you could smell you could taste equal
[1:11:58] year isn't a head and the once a man
[1:12:01] gives you the ring and again married he
[1:12:04] becomes a she
[1:12:06] by the same time if you have the speed
[1:12:09] of gonna you you won't walk around they
[1:12:11] all sing and the head of his also you
[1:12:14] have to listen to me you don't have to
[1:12:17] remind your wife your partner that once
[1:12:20] the see Christ you'll see that you
[1:12:22] submitted to the word Christ your head
[1:12:23] sheep they will follow suit so if failed
[1:12:26] at that point to hide under the headship
[1:12:29] of a husband and one see table as yet
[1:12:32] see there is no covering
[1:12:35] there's no carbon so she felt will a
[1:12:38] lesser order something God already given
[1:12:42] a dominion over I mean it was today I'm
[1:12:46] last same situation we follow two we
[1:12:51] have dominion over principalities of
[1:12:53] powers and powers in the name of Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ coming brother Paul I'm gonna
[1:12:57] show you something the Bible come on it
[1:12:59] got the law coming out in his creatures
[1:13:01] he said resist the devil what happened
[1:13:05] he didn't resist but he didn't I was
[1:13:09] gonna attack that one and all that is
[1:13:10] coming in the book of Job the look but
[1:13:15] the lot access said this is the devil
[1:13:16] where you coming from

[1:13:24] it doesn't take breaks he's a wonder it
[1:13:27] was going all over the place all over
[1:13:29] the place and once that guy sees that

[1:13:37] you what is it like to do what is this

[1:13:43] and it's gonna strike at the time you

[1:13:49] on Sundays I wish I were young we
[1:13:51] enjoyed the presence of the Lord and we
[1:13:52] like um I'm so blessed but that was
[1:13:55] waiting for you right on Monday morning

[1:14:21] we cannot outwit the devil because
[1:14:24] that's not what God told us to do we
[1:14:27] have to do what if did not do I don't
[1:14:29] know as she pushes which is the word of
[1:14:30] God and we use the word is given abuse
[1:14:33] our power our armor to fight the devil
[1:14:36] the devil and shall flee from you how
[1:14:41] many times this day we struggle from the
[1:14:42] spirits of lower order
[1:14:45] stop exercising our Dominion Alleluia

[1:15:01] spirits says Eve quoted the word - but
[1:15:05] she'll like the summit and our attitude
[1:15:11] our actions were the Word of God is
[1:15:13] gonna trigger in fact a reaction if
[1:15:16] disobedience caused the body change from
[1:15:22] from eternity into time
[1:15:27] and our attitude and our actions towards
[1:15:30] God through the wood is also gonna cause
[1:15:32] a body change he's gonna cause a body
[1:15:35] change either to destruction or to
[1:15:38] rapture Alleluia amen the body change in
[1:15:46] the beginning was the curse on to even
[1:15:49] Adam because of that disobedience but
[1:15:52] same body change and the bride its last
[1:15:55] day it's gonna be a blessing to us
[1:15:57] Alleluia the body change gonna be a
[1:16:01] blessing to us hallelujah so where you
[1:16:03] failed in the beginning this second heap
[1:16:06] the Bride of Christ will not fail
[1:16:08] Alleluia because she has received a
[1:16:10] revelation of the word of God and she
[1:16:13] has become the word she has yunxi able
[1:16:15] to put a skin on the girl in the Word of
[1:16:17] God for a day Alleluia one of the major
[1:16:21] challenge we're talking about is last
[1:16:22] night in in every age and dispensation
[1:16:25] is that we we we replace our culture and
[1:16:32] traditions we esteem it over the Word of
[1:16:34] God we always extend our culture and
[1:16:39] tradition by the Word of God
[1:16:39] this is how we did it back home some of
[1:16:44] us up and I in America decide we used to
[1:16:47] do back home that we did it and we
[1:16:48] forget that the absolute is the Word of
[1:16:50] God our culture and stay with the word
[1:17:03] Alleluia so we as team culture and
[1:17:06] traditions and our Creed over the Word
[1:17:08] of God now it's not a matter of what the
[1:17:11] world says anymore but a matter of what
[1:17:14] my pastor says the matter of what my
[1:17:17] church says and people go as far as
[1:17:19] saying that every church is autonomous
[1:17:23] what God is not the author of confusion
[1:17:24] is what is supreme
[1:17:28] and for the world to have its
[1:17:30] preeminence in us we have to accept it
[1:17:32] and after we accept it we have to
[1:17:35] believe it before the world can have
[1:17:37] this place in our life amen
[1:17:40] Acts chapter 3 verse 1 6 X 3 1 2 6
[1:17:56] I'm gonna go back that number way that
[1:17:58] earlier so on this fateful morning
[1:18:02] I can imagine Satan was laying in bed
[1:18:06] you know it wasn't sleepy because
[1:18:09] sleeping doesn't like to sleep but we
[1:18:11] just lay in bed time to strategize outer
[1:18:14] planets day and instigate against each
[1:18:16] other now which brothers gonna turn
[1:18:18] against a pastor and which aren't figure
[1:18:22] that out it was fine if many people was
[1:18:27] gathering at Pentecost he knew that was
[1:18:31] going on but he did none of the pores of
[1:18:34] the God read because it was not you he's
[1:18:37] not God he doesn't know what's gonna
[1:18:38] happen prior to happening that is what
[1:18:41] makes him a devil but God knowing what's
[1:18:44] gonna happen before it happens knowing
[1:18:45] everything from the beginning to the end
[1:18:46] it makes him God so it was fine we
[1:18:49] didn't eat it he had it out no problem
[1:18:52] but then when is Saudi effective what
[1:18:55] happened on Pentecost had a problem with
[1:18:57] that then he came back to this man okay
[1:19:01] and the last day I will put my spirit
[1:19:03] upon all flesh oh wow
[1:19:05] why did I allow this it was too late for
[1:19:08] him then he started gathering people
[1:19:10] around this book choir drunk started
[1:19:13] putting stuff in the mind of the people
[1:19:14] these people are crazy they lose in your
[1:19:16] mind by the same time this people could
[1:19:20] understand the languages of this other
[1:19:21] or the disc Jews were speaking
[1:19:23] Bible said they understood the language
[1:19:24] of these people they spoke different
[1:19:27] languages so it was it was confusing to
[1:19:29] them as well but he still try to stop it
[1:19:31] now which is what he does best it tries
[1:19:33] to stop the move of God well you can't
[1:19:34] stop it hallelujah he tried all that but
[1:19:40] but then after that they express it on
[1:19:43] the upper unchanged the people it was a
[1:19:46] reaction to what happened in the upper
[1:19:47] room and which is what we saw in Peter
[1:19:50] and John and when it saw that they knew
[1:19:53] that man he had a problem with that the
[1:19:56] devil was fine with you quoting the
[1:19:59] world like I said it's fine everything
[1:20:00] you do but when it gets the point of
[1:20:02] view putting the skin on the Word of God
[1:20:03] he has a problem with it Alleluia
[1:20:07] and I'm so glad this tonight that Kaveri
[1:20:10] give us power to impact life Alleluia
[1:20:13] and I can look at my son and I'm prey of
[1:20:17] prefer to live Holy Spirit over him I
[1:20:19] can look at my brother and impact life
[1:20:22] in any aspect of their life I can impact
[1:20:25] them in a great way that the doctor
[1:20:28] cannot because that is the essence of
[1:20:30] Calvary you know my product could be
[1:20:32] neither be only ghost and I could put my
[1:20:34] hands on my brother
[1:20:35] pray for the only ghost upon him and he
[1:20:36] receives he only goes Alleluia and you
[1:20:39] know and this is what the devil is
[1:20:40] having problem with there was family Joe
[1:20:43] Jesus alone when this is the night is 72
[1:20:47] disciples following he had a problem I
[1:20:50] can have these people equipping these
[1:20:53] people with power it was not fine with
[1:20:55] that I never would be 72 people when
[1:20:58] they became 12 instead a problem with
[1:21:00] that it's time to enter into one of them
[1:21:03] because it wasn't fine with it that's
[1:21:05] not what I wanted
[1:21:06] Alleluia we could see the extreme
[1:21:09] example you know a job when job was busy
[1:21:14] sacrificing for his children would I
[1:21:17] even know if the sins or not it was it
[1:21:19] was it didn't have not so much problem
[1:21:21] with that well job started testifying in
[1:21:24] his trial when he called the revelation
[1:21:27] or what it was going through I started
[1:21:30] testifying I know my redeemer liveth and
[1:21:32] is able to raise me up on the last days
[1:21:34] he had a problem with that he had a
[1:21:38] problem with that
[1:21:39] Alleluia and this shows the opponents of
[1:21:42] Revelation to man and my church I was
[1:21:45] talking not so long ago about entity our
[1:21:49] believers are losing the identity when I
[1:21:51] was growing up I keep some when I was
[1:21:53] growing up my dad I'm only 31 I grew up
[1:21:57] in church and I didn't have any
[1:21:59] experience but I loved going to church
[1:22:00] gospel play music now see my friends and
[1:22:04] I also gone to Sunday school because of
[1:22:05] the cookies out what they give out
[1:22:07] hallelujah the judge now I was I was
[1:22:11] gonna I was always excited because I
[1:22:12] know this unexpected Chad's gonna give
[1:22:14] us goodies I knew it my mom raised oh
[1:22:17] she taught us we had our children's
[1:22:19] books on the voice of God and all that
[1:22:21] we knew story of the prophet a prophet
[1:22:22] and although I know they always gonna
[1:22:24] have question about that you know I love
[1:22:27] that but then they had to come a time
[1:22:29] when actually my personal experience and
[1:22:33] that was the shaking our was trying our
[1:22:35] that was fine with me going to church he
[1:22:38] was family playing music in church and I
[1:22:41] was a pastor's kid as well you know if
[1:22:44] it was found with that and then I I've
[1:22:46] always been shoot it we don't we all
[1:22:48] went to school my brothers went to
[1:22:49] school in the same state as well
[1:22:51] relieved but I wasn't under one school
[1:22:53] far away from home because I wanted my
[1:22:55] freedom and I chose a major that no snow
[1:22:59] state very close so I stayed at so I
[1:23:02] wanted like four states away from all so
[1:23:04] the first time my parents followed me to
[1:23:06] school was my first day of school and I
[1:23:08] didn't see them after that because I
[1:23:09] didn't wanted to come because I just
[1:23:12] wanted to have my own experience in the
[1:23:14] wrong way and I was doing my thing going
[1:23:16] to school even my life I don't want to
[1:23:18] serve God I don't want to do nothing
[1:23:19] because I was fed up but the moment a
[1:23:22] revelation was struck the moment I add
[1:23:25] my own experience each hate my life it
[1:23:28] changed the way I saw stuff he's changed
[1:23:30] my desires brother are you perfect no
[1:23:33] I'm not I'm far from perfect I'm
[1:23:34] probably the worst sinner in this room
[1:23:37] tonight but the grace of God and a
[1:23:39] revelation of the word of God changed my
[1:23:42] mindset change my desires the friends I
[1:23:45] kept before I don't want them in no more
[1:23:47] Alleluia so revelation is very very
[1:23:51] important in your process of becoming
[1:23:54] the word in the process of people in
[1:23:56] skin on the world you first have to
[1:23:58] discern the world is this word for me
[1:24:01] like Jesus this is for what is this word
[1:24:03] for my day and what is the expectation
[1:24:05] of the world for me in this last day
[1:24:08] when you know that
[1:24:11] and they you have a revelation of the
[1:24:13] wood that is given for your day it
[1:24:16] changes everything about you it changes
[1:24:19] everything about you Alleluia look 18
[1:24:23] verse 8 it says when it Son of man
[1:24:26] cometh shall you find faith on earth and
[1:24:29] is because and this last is the love of
[1:24:31] man is waxing cold do they want to go to
[1:24:34] church don't wanna go to church science
[1:24:38] has made everything so easy for people

[1:26:49] gotta go to work they gonna make sure
[1:26:52] that okay we've seen this guy in church
[1:26:54] but it is life matching I'm going to

[1:27:05] church again Sarasota he travel now and
[1:27:07] after church do you know how many
[1:27:09] churches in Tampa I was like listen
[1:27:12] y'all I don't get it
[1:27:13] I said he's something that no churches
[1:27:18] in Tampa but my church is different that
[1:27:21] churches they can work on Sundays in my
[1:27:24] church we can't work on Sundays so we go
[1:27:26] to church and it's a bible-believing
[1:27:28] Church but everybody pretty scriptures
[1:27:30] like no sir II said we don't when
[1:27:33] instead of seeing our I was breaking
[1:27:35] nothing okay we respect that it's okay
[1:27:38] so one of my busses is the Miss honest I
[1:27:41] didn't know so when he started working I
[1:27:45] saw his truck at is this big Mason logo
[1:27:49] on his tow each sound like I haven't
[1:27:53] seen Mason its time before cries no
[1:27:54] business with them so did the sketch in
[1:27:57] who was like or they say didn't work
[1:27:59] Sundays I say yeah I don't want Sundays
[1:28:01] so you got a problem with that
[1:28:03] not really but it's not fair towards the
[1:28:06] rest of us they're working on Sundays I
[1:28:07] was like our religion is different it's
[1:28:11] that oh you're Christian
[1:28:13] I said yeah he said I'm a Christian too
[1:28:15] I was like our standard is different
[1:28:20] he said well are you missing least oh
[1:28:23] yeah oh yeah me see my brother I was
[1:28:27] like no I'm not your brother
[1:28:28] I said I'm a different mission it's what
[1:28:32] kind of missions after Jesus mission is
[1:28:36] that is what I believe
[1:28:38] it said well I want to go to your church
[1:28:41] say you're coming church with me I said
[1:28:43] I'll be great like I texted me an
[1:28:45] address and he looked up the church and
[1:28:49] I saw the website he said I'm not coming
[1:28:51] your church anymore what's going on John
[1:28:55] I'm gonna come to your church no more I
[1:28:56] said why see well it's not my kind of
[1:28:59] Christianity I said that's exactly why I
[1:29:01] can't work on Sundays Alleluia
[1:29:04] so we are alive as a match our testimony
[1:29:09] our revelation because if we have all
[1:29:12] this knowledge of the word of God and
[1:29:14] there's no life to back it up then it's
[1:29:17] a waste just like if she had a knowledge
[1:29:21] of the world she actually knew it she
[1:29:23] knew what God said she knew what God
[1:29:25] wanted she knew the expectation but
[1:29:27] there was no life to back it up because
[1:29:30] for every one who got would say Amen -
[1:29:31] for everyone go we jump and shout and
[1:29:33] rejoice for the devil's gonna trials
[1:29:36] Alleluia
[1:29:37] you know I could see Jesus looked
[1:29:40] through the banister of eternity and
[1:29:41] city's last days and I believe that's
[1:29:44] why he talked to these are posters the
[1:29:46] way talk to them before yeah he was
[1:29:48] taken up you know he shot a son of mine
[1:29:51] find faith on earth now people see faith
[1:29:55] as sometimes really ambiguous
[1:29:58] until I got a revelation about the grace
[1:30:01] of God I didn't understand what faith
[1:30:03] was myself many of us have all think we
[1:30:07] have faith the Bible says faith is the
[1:30:09] substance of things hoped for
[1:30:13] he's an evidence of the things unseen
[1:30:18] I mean fate is like me any girls were
[1:30:22] said Elias I want to do I want you to
[1:30:24] jump through this wall now is me
[1:30:27] believing without thinking about it that
[1:30:29] there's no well there's no door on this
[1:30:31] wall and I just jumped right through it
[1:30:33] because I know that EDA has promised to
[1:30:35] commanded me to jump through the waters
[1:30:37] gonna open your way for me put a door in
[1:30:39] the wall before I get to the wall
[1:30:42] Alleluia so Jesus not a concern because
[1:30:45] he could look what it was it was the
[1:30:47] Creator I can't believe what is gonna
[1:30:52] happen this last I don't of this kind of
[1:30:54] faith
[1:30:55] and you could read also seen some
[1:30:57] example Brown was talking about the last
[1:30:59] days it was I don't want to be there I
[1:31:02] don't want to wait to see if he could
[1:31:04] complain so much I've always gone on his
[1:31:06] generation the way did how much more now
[1:31:09] and I see people get really mad when the
[1:31:13] preaching of the word of God is going on
[1:31:14] they get really furious I simple to talk
[1:31:17] back to the minister because they had a
[1:31:20] problem with the word you can't be part
[1:31:23] of the word enough problem with the
[1:31:24] world no that's conflictual God don't
[1:31:29] work that way people get so so mad at
[1:31:32] the preacher why because the world is
[1:31:34] talking about their condition and they
[1:31:37] start up them to be repentant
[1:31:38] I'm the vulnerable to the work they
[1:31:40] can't I many of us today is putting the
[1:31:44] skin on the Word of God there's
[1:31:46] thousands and thousands of scriptures
[1:31:48] promises in the Bible about our our last
[1:31:50] day for the bride I'm only up there
[1:31:55] people for the water because I can't
[1:31:57] submerge em alive lead it up by the Word
[1:32:00] of God by the fire be always prayed and
[1:32:02] people around me won't benefit from it
[1:32:04] see one of the problems we have in this
[1:32:06] message because one I remember we're
[1:32:08] talking one time on why our churches
[1:32:14] you know it's not growing like we expect
[1:32:17] them to grow first we live in last day
[1:32:19] it's not gonna grow what I talking about
[1:32:24] I'm not expecting to grow because the
[1:32:27] crowd has to be trimmed and we've been
[1:32:30] losing a lot of people that's why I left
[1:32:31] with a living message at the same time
[1:32:33] you know I would get so confused and sad
[1:32:35] and depressed when people leave a
[1:32:37] message oh brother
[1:32:39] it was on fire he would preach a roof
[1:32:41] down and he left a message like that and
[1:32:44] yet it's cursed why are we getting
[1:32:47] discouraged why because we put so much
[1:32:52] expectation on that man
[1:32:53] it's not about a man is the word of God
[1:32:57] God could put a little child in here -
[1:32:59] pooping and God's gonna speak to branch
[1:33:00] out God spoke to a donkey and that
[1:33:05] Islamic the donkey a God and we made God
[1:33:09] out of man and we're very quick to
[1:33:11] spread rumors about people leaving the
[1:33:12] church but I've never had a war room
[1:33:15] about people joining the church I don't
[1:33:17] know one single rumor about God added to
[1:33:19] the church I want testimonies like that
[1:33:21] if gonna put your energy to complain
[1:33:23] about to deliver the message I want put
[1:33:25] your energy to go to to tell me also
[1:33:27] when people join the church when people
[1:33:29] get saved let me give the light of Jesus
[1:33:31] Christ when we get baptized I want to
[1:33:33] send energy on stuff like that I don't
[1:33:35] know yet
[1:33:36] amen Romans 8:19 I'm gonna write up
[1:33:40] shortly it says for the creation waits
[1:33:43] in eager expectation I'm reading the New
[1:33:46] International Version for the creation
[1:33:48] awaits an egg act stations for the
[1:33:49] children of God to be revealed
[1:33:54] I can go to different examples and a
[1:33:56] business creatures of this verse I just
[1:34:00] read
[1:34:03] when God gave man Dominion was the
[1:34:06] exciting thing to see you know you wanna
[1:34:10] okay what what does both of the creation
[1:34:14] why does krishna waits in eager
[1:34:16] expectation is son of chicken son of God
[1:34:17] you know got to be revealed why mean the
[1:34:21] trees can talk they ain't gonna mind
[1:34:25] but then the same scripture says that if
[1:34:27] man kicks quietiy rocks we shout there
[1:34:31] are creations of God and the purpose of
[1:34:33] the Christians of God is to worship God
[1:34:35] to bring glory back to him hallelujah
[1:34:38] look at how climate change will occur
[1:34:40] what is going around the world right now
[1:34:42] and so much cares and we act like
[1:34:46] reacting Brannon like as if somebody
[1:34:48] never told the body before it's nothing
[1:34:52] brand-new it's been said but Isaiah was
[1:34:56] shaken when I was last night this quote
[1:34:58] of brother Branham are we the right
[1:35:00] quick
[1:35:05] on what is going on right now you know
[1:35:10] who's got paragraph 8 but I Brown was
[1:35:13] praying said grant Lord that something
[1:35:15] will be said tonight or done that will
[1:35:17] cause the way words to turn to Christ
[1:35:18] for we believe and feel pressed in the
[1:35:21] spirit that the great the great the
[1:35:23] great judgments upon the lands in these
[1:35:25] last days plagues disease germs already
[1:35:29] bred up to be scattered throughout the
[1:35:32] nation's no doctor knew the doctor no
[1:35:36] even out to take a hold of it
[1:35:38] Oh God would have to believe in divine
[1:35:41] alien dead when nations are breathing
[1:35:45] germs together to pass them into bumps
[1:35:47] and millions died in ours over it that's
[1:35:50] exactly what is going on and then we I
[1:35:52] was at the airport on Friday and I was
[1:35:55] just laughing no it wasn't just because
[1:35:58] I was because I was nonchalant I wasn't
[1:36:00] but I saw people soak eating up like a
[1:36:02] sieve they can bypass these discs out
[1:36:06] there this lady she had a rubber gloves
[1:36:10] on she had surgical gloves or covers on
[1:36:15] her shoes ready pack of our distinctive
[1:36:21] wipes right on our suitcases like that
[1:36:23] she can wipe in everything I'm like what
[1:36:26] in the world is going I was gonna record
[1:36:27] I don't get in trouble I was just
[1:36:30] laughing I go to the bathroom opening
[1:36:34] the door with your elbows they thing
[1:36:38] they are covered no you know the only
[1:36:43] car we have today that is generous the
[1:36:45] blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:36:48] he said Max's sin says these signs shall
[1:36:52] follow them that believe the problem is
[1:36:54] that they have no faith they're not
[1:36:58] believe in science and wonders it's
[1:37:01] postponed to believers now I believe is
[1:37:03] seeking for size of honest
[1:37:05] as I don't send people go from meetings
[1:37:08] to meetings I mean it's a minister
[1:37:09] meetings after meetings after meetings
[1:37:10] go out all over looking for revival look
[1:37:15] for signs and wonders they would never
[1:37:17] get it
[1:37:18] and that was wasting their time because
[1:37:22] what you're looking for right is here
[1:37:25] it says science I wanna shape follow to
[1:37:27] believe is that promises established
[1:37:29] already it's established already all we
[1:37:34] gotta do is walk into it walk into it
[1:37:38] and as a problem of the people you want
[1:37:41] to be spoon-fed they want a pastor to
[1:37:44] really quote for them the one password
[1:37:46] read the Bible verses to them and send
[1:37:48] them text to read or really bad a
[1:37:49] certain Bible verse every day the one a
[1:37:52] pastor talk to your daughter that can't
[1:37:53] cook fish you won't talk Massa talk to
[1:37:56] the son that oz dreads on his head the
[1:37:59] one that passed her to come up them wash
[1:38:00] their car the one a pastor talk to their
[1:38:03] wife for keeping us dirty what are we
[1:38:08] doing what are we doing
[1:38:12] there's so much expectation on the
[1:38:14] ministry we have pastors dying by the
[1:38:17] day we have ministers struggling and
[1:38:20] dying because they bought too much
[1:38:21] there's too much burden on them and we
[1:38:25] Babel says this this desire to sin sell
[1:38:28] make off the spirit desire and you have
[1:38:32] to do your work your own part as well my
[1:38:36] son
[1:38:37] just like a crawling and I started
[1:38:40] moving all up so when I get him for work
[1:38:43] I'm very tired I said his name is alive
[1:38:46] so we call him EJ I said EJ what's going
[1:38:49] on buddy
[1:38:50] and it starts smiling and they would sit
[1:38:52] up I'm so tired
[1:38:55] because boys like that if you don't show
[1:39:05] that you one is help you won't do it for
[1:39:08] you because God is not for a Christmas
[1:39:11] just walk around us with this bag and
[1:39:14] say hey you you take what a wisdom you
[1:39:18] knowledge you take a new house you take
[1:39:22] discernment you I don't do it like that
[1:39:24] you have to desire it first and when he
[1:39:28] sees your anger is gonna give it to you
[1:39:29] Alleluia so if we don't make the attempt
[1:39:34] God won't give it to us and then we put
[1:39:37] so much expectation on pastors I can
[1:39:40] tell you stories on and on and on
[1:39:41] because I was so close to to the to the
[1:39:43] ministry when I was growing up now is it
[1:39:45] that is boy and I love stories I was
[1:39:47] just yeah I understand but growing up I
[1:39:50] played back to play them back my mom
[1:39:51] like what I've seen chart name was
[1:39:54] trying to borrow back the tide the paid
[1:39:55] on Sunday Pro pastor but that time
[1:39:59] opinion sunny collaborate back I will
[1:40:01] give you all the boy is real is
[1:40:06] happening
[1:40:13] I tell you what I see people expected
[1:40:18] fellowship everyday after Sunday service
[1:40:20] with a pastor and one pastor to pay for
[1:40:24] their food all the time
[1:40:26] you don't have to pay the abuse how many
[1:40:29] times out of the abundance of your
[1:40:30] hearth I said listen I'm gonna go to
[1:40:32] pastors today house today I'm gonna take
[1:40:34] him out to go eat whatever he wants I'm
[1:40:39] gonna be a blessing to my pastor today
[1:40:41] it doesn't happen anymore it doesn't it
[1:40:46] does not happen everybody expects
[1:40:48] everything from the pastor it's so bad
[1:40:52] that people only see pastor on
[1:40:53] Wednesdays on Sundays on the journey
[1:40:56] services or when they in trouble that's
[1:40:58] when they know the pastor's phone number
[1:41:00] what happens they would have been
[1:41:01] government a pastor I appreciate your
[1:41:04] ministry tonight god bless I'm really
[1:41:05] blessed just remote stay encouraged
[1:41:07] nobody does that
[1:41:10] so that tells me that you're selfish and
[1:41:14] a believer is not supposed to be selfish
[1:41:18] Christianity is a lively for others
[1:41:21] including your pastor your pastor is not
[1:41:25] always on a percent of fire it doesn't
[1:41:28] happen that way when I was in Middle
[1:41:32] School I saw his class captain my
[1:41:35] classification was a whole lot probably
[1:41:37] 120 students I wasn't right up those
[1:41:40] boys and I want to share this guys in
[1:41:42] class
[1:41:43] and when I was like 16 guys in class now
[1:41:48] so that's 26 27 you expect them to
[1:41:51] listen to me it's not possible I was too
[1:41:55] much job for me and I was playful so
[1:41:59] when I can get everything ready
[1:42:01] everybody right your class getting in
[1:42:03] trouble and we all get whooped hung get
[1:42:06] punished and the house somewhere it is
[1:42:08] in the house of God if you don't protect
[1:42:11] the ministry
[1:42:12] you're not gonna reap the fruits of that
[1:42:13] ministry as you ought to you know
[1:42:16] support the ministry younger eat the
[1:42:17] fruit of min strategy so also the Bible
[1:42:20] says bear each other's Borden
[1:42:22] that's part of the words for the patina
[1:42:24] but we're now it's about me me me me me
[1:42:28] me me
[1:42:29] I've not seen so much self-centered
[1:42:32] spirits in my labyrinth I moved to this
[1:42:34] part of the world and it's spreading
[1:42:38] because America is the number one seed
[1:42:41] of influence when it comes to anything
[1:42:42] in the world
[1:42:43] marriage sports fashion whatever America
[1:42:46] it is it is it is America because it's
[1:42:51] the power of the world is the capital of
[1:42:53] the world pretty much and it's all about
[1:42:56] me me me me me me so it's not as people
[1:43:00] getting married and I'm gonna have
[1:43:01] nothing to do with the X X and my family
[1:43:04] there's a road of people playing your
[1:43:06] life I can forget about a parent that
[1:43:09] raised you spend all the time to take
[1:43:11] care of you all your life I just leave
[1:43:13] with the answer and forget about them
[1:43:14] and just hey they'll be fine
[1:43:16] your parents are suffering but you keep
[1:43:17] changing your car and you're buying
[1:43:18] expensive stuff puts your parents
[1:43:22] madness is on and you're filing your
[1:43:23] mother so that your days may be long and
[1:43:25] that is the spirit that is its kind of
[1:43:28] culture we are embodying our children to
[1:43:32] not care about anybody except themselves
[1:43:35] I'm pretty I'm very glad I grew up when
[1:43:38] I grew up when I was a little child I
[1:43:39] saw so many things that happen the house
[1:43:41] of God
[1:43:41] I'm sick of putting on people's heart
[1:43:43] after service to go many started
[1:43:44] people's needs financially economically
[1:43:46] one not spiritually many times I've seen
[1:43:50] my mom cook early Sunday morning let me
[1:43:54] cook it for us know we have faster this
[1:43:57] money we I thought my cooking for she's
[1:43:59] gonna cook after church she's not bring
[1:44:01] the food to one family out of the blue
[1:44:03] I'm like mom and then we I find out
[1:44:07] later in the week when he could finally
[1:44:09] cause I say listen sister Tony I didn't
[1:44:12] know we do have food in the house
[1:44:14] how do you know we were struggling it
[1:44:18] wasn't just my mom several people in the
[1:44:20] house of God I sent people you did
[1:44:23] themselves too much to the Word of God
[1:44:24] to the Spirit of God that they built led
[1:44:26] by the spirit cause Bible says this sham
[1:44:28] led by the spirit and they shall be
[1:44:29] called sons and daughters of God and I
[1:44:33] see that were right now but so selfish
[1:44:36] so self-centered you won't have no value
[1:44:41] at all in the eyes of God
[1:44:45] they're gonna come late they doesn't
[1:44:46] complain is too hot you companies to
[1:44:48] code it complete the song good song was
[1:44:50] sung at a wrong key they observe
[1:44:53] everything excuse me and adds them what
[1:45:00] role did you play in the service today
[1:45:01] zero they didn't pray for the service
[1:45:05] they did come an expectation the
[1:45:08] probably commence petition was were
[1:45:09] wrong as potential what is wrong with
[1:45:12] people
[1:45:14] lack of the only ghost
[1:45:18] majority of them have the knowledge up
[1:45:20] here they will quote you the message
[1:45:23] they will tell you why your background
[1:45:24] proceed and they go tell your brand
[1:45:25] preacher of that sermon one is in
[1:45:27] alignment that I was in Tampa they know
[1:45:31] all of that but when they sure that
[1:45:34] comes when it's time for them to act the
[1:45:38] word they got a problem they wouldn't
[1:45:42] wanna be exhorted they don't want to be
[1:45:45] exactly don't want to correct it how we
[1:45:48] forgot so many times that in - feet all
[1:45:50] egos will be open to exhortation there's
[1:45:54] gonna be humble in minot Spirit of God
[1:45:57] with that on them they're very open to
[1:45:59] it no matter how long the beam of faith
[1:46:03] don't say what are you talking about my
[1:46:06] father was on the program in the
[1:46:07] ministry I was they came up with a
[1:46:08] Branham pride that is no liner with the
[1:46:12] word of God I suppose said he said
[1:46:18] humanly speaking of my apostle of
[1:46:20] apostles it was goodbye the best colors
[1:46:22] in the country he knew it he knew the
[1:46:26] word some of the things was fighting for
[1:46:28] against the church he could prove it by
[1:46:32] his theology but that's how far he's
[1:46:34] known it could bring him but the moment
[1:46:37] he had a revelation go to open his eyes
[1:46:39] and that voice cried to him Paul what's
[1:46:44] so excuse me
[1:46:45] why persecuted on me what wording was
[1:46:47] the Lord I was talking he knew it why
[1:46:52] because God Brandon in revelation at
[1:46:54] that time and sometimes try to take the
[1:46:57] role of the oldest spirit it's not about
[1:47:02] being disciples because many times bring
[1:47:05] people to church and we don't stay on
[1:47:07] our brother we don't stand on our sister
[1:47:09] that must bring them to church
[1:47:11] I'm establishment of the world oh we
[1:47:12] have a proverb little message amen amen
[1:47:14] my brother is fine no they're supposed
[1:47:18] to be disciples of each other our people
[1:47:20] are growing Christ a pea or sister grow
[1:47:23] in Christ and that's what the problem is
[1:47:26] today but one day I said once the
[1:47:29] revelation struck Paul is were changed
[1:47:34] it was humble that pride our ego was
[1:47:37] gone out of him because the knowledge of
[1:47:39] the word of God is only gonna pump you
[1:47:41] up
[1:47:41] Alleluia you know it's only gonna pump
[1:47:44] you up and that's why you see the way
[1:47:47] people actually church today hallelujah
[1:47:50] I'm gonna retire on up it said for to
[1:47:55] put the skin on the Word of God the word
[1:47:57] after the first quickened in you and
[1:48:01] then after that's gonna manifest it
[1:48:04] because if pregnant women cannot can
[1:48:06] hide the pregnancy no way you can only
[1:48:11] hide it so far
[1:48:13] well after why people gonna know you're
[1:48:15] pregnant that I start throwing up
[1:48:18] fashion show me symptoms of pregnancy or
[1:48:21] something's gonna happen in my own case
[1:48:25] before we got married said we're gonna
[1:48:27] wait like two years before we have a
[1:48:28] child
[1:48:29] someone might finish in nursing school
[1:48:31] now if I was gonna finish my masters the
[1:48:32] hardest stuff you know you know how we
[1:48:34] as human beings are this plant stuff
[1:48:38] you know 2018 December my life was
[1:48:44] pregnant I did not know it was my
[1:48:46] birthday so she flew me out to New
[1:48:48] Orleans with there four days we planned
[1:48:51] this trip she told me this was going on
[1:48:54] day 1 day 2 and on and on but when it's
[1:48:57] not for us to wake up she's still
[1:48:58] sleeping
[1:49:00] I need that tired I know it's a baby
[1:49:04] let's go look I'm so tired like what we
[1:49:08] already well rested she was I'm tired I
[1:49:10] was blind I didn't let it what does
[1:49:14] become flashing her I didn't know so we
[1:49:18] came out from our tree woods happy for 3
[1:49:21] straight lines I didn't know my wife was
[1:49:22] pregnant
[1:49:25] I did not know she go pregnant and begin
[1:49:30] up December January February
[1:49:35] and then in March it wasn't really shown
[1:49:38] that time those first three months some
[1:49:40] people are lucky shows right here some P
[1:49:41] doesn't really show and I was sitting
[1:49:44] there when I got back from night from
[1:49:46] from from from working I was sitting
[1:49:47] there just trying to follow the news and
[1:49:49] we were talking control my hand and she
[1:49:53] said I'm pregnant
[1:49:54] I have the blue are you gonna say just
[1:50:04] like that and she said how am I supposed
[1:50:06] to say I said our nose how long have you
[1:50:11] been pregnant I don't know it's probably
[1:50:13] three months about what I said up the
[1:50:16] bed because it was getting to a point
[1:50:21] where she couldn't hide the pregnancy
[1:50:22] anymore I got to tell this guy and she
[1:50:26] was scared because I said I wanted us to
[1:50:27] wait she definitely wasn't conceived by
[1:50:31] the oldest period it wasn't so like I
[1:50:39] was saying you can hide where your field
[1:50:43] if I put it if I get a big drum a metal
[1:50:46] drum and it's empty and I roll it down
[1:50:49] it's gonna make the loudest noise but
[1:50:53] when it's filled it doesn't make no
[1:50:56] noise and it's our kinda find people who
[1:51:00] are live in the world or people who have
[1:51:02] filled in church they make the loudest
[1:51:05] noise there's no everything they see
[1:51:07] everything is wrong because they are
[1:51:09] empty because emptiness makes the
[1:51:13] loudest noise says the Chinese proverb
[1:51:15] people are empty they are not filled so
[1:51:19] they have everything say about
[1:51:21] everything you got a problem with
[1:51:23] everything but a man that is filled
[1:51:25] that's different it says less when it's
[1:51:30] not in fellowship he's ready to
[1:51:31] fellowship you see the true color comes
[1:51:34] out because they join the fellowship but
[1:51:35] Bram's that we draw strength from each
[1:51:37] other just like the evil spirits
[1:51:39] congregate
[1:51:41] if if you have a gospel in church that
[1:51:44] gospel can only congruent that gossiper
[1:51:47] maybe maybe the Spirit of God asked that
[1:51:50] person is not manifested yet but they
[1:51:52] have it it's like a magnet so they been
[1:51:57] gravitate towards each other and spirits
[1:52:00] congregate I just like the way spring
[1:52:03] sweets conjugates we draw strength from
[1:52:06] each other where Brom said when we all
[1:52:08] gather in one place as believers he said
[1:52:11] he's all of us bringing our lake of fire
[1:52:13] I bring my liquor fire you bring your
[1:52:16] liquefy he brings a lick of fire
[1:52:17] everybody brings a lick of fire and it
[1:52:19] becomes a pillar of fire Alleluia amen
[1:52:25] for every step for every everywhere to
[1:52:28] go who put his keen on we're all a step
[1:52:30] away from my body change because the
[1:52:34] picture is a perfect man in search of
[1:52:37] the perfect man that's right there when
[1:52:41] you have faith great step closer to your
[1:52:43] body change you have verses you step
[1:52:46] closer to your body change you have
[1:52:48] knowledge you a step closer temperature
[1:52:50] get step closer day in day how the mouth
[1:52:54] become the Word of God the more public
[1:52:57] up of our closeness to our body change
[1:52:59] the Bible said and Enoch walked with God
[1:53:03] he knows so much that it was not he had
[1:53:07] about a change because there's no way a
[1:53:10] man is gonna walk with God and there
[1:53:12] won't be a body change is always gonna
[1:53:15] happen now and he a process of your body
[1:53:17] change you're gonna learn to love
[1:53:20] trouble there's no new adversary's
[1:53:24] because the adversary's don't want you
[1:53:27] anywhere near that body change just like
[1:53:32] people today they want the table they
[1:53:35] want a lot to pray a table for them than
[1:53:36] their enemies but they don't want no
[1:53:39] enemies
[1:53:40] Lord bless my business
[1:53:45] Laure do this for me lord I want that I
[1:53:47] want this full of the spirit I want a
[1:53:50] gift I want your word to be born in my
[1:53:53] life
[1:53:53] dad I died today now the accident forgot
[1:53:56] to bring for this big table of buffet in
[1:53:58] front of them but no one no enemy to get
[1:54:01] jealous of your table you you can't have
[1:54:05] the table daddy enemies you have to have
[1:54:07] the table and the enemies and the things
[1:54:11] that God is trying to motors and shape
[1:54:13] us and help us understand the opponents
[1:54:17] of enemies in our in our to walk towards
[1:54:21] become becoming a priest touch of the
[1:54:22] perfect man because you need those
[1:54:24] adversary's down the road to keep in
[1:54:28] your toes because if I make a food right
[1:54:31] now like the super Isaiah with us
[1:54:34] Saturday night was a chicken arm still
[1:54:38] if that chicken suit was made and I was
[1:54:41] left on the stove without a stove being
[1:54:43] torn out without no fire its of no good
[1:54:45] it don't get bad because the super could
[1:54:47] get comfortable no matter how cold the
[1:54:50] weather outside is he's gonna eventually
[1:54:51] get back but a little bit of fire wasn't
[1:54:55] know why it's gonna keep that soup not
[1:54:57] comfortable not part because the final
[1:55:00] decision that soup isn't that's to you
[1:55:02] it's not in the pot the furnace the
[1:55:04] destination is Umbria as is still McCann
[1:55:06] our stomach right that's the final
[1:55:09] destination so is so it's not it's not
[1:55:12] meant for this still to get comfortable
[1:55:13] in a pot so we all want to get
[1:55:17] comfortable now we get comfortable in
[1:55:19] the things of life and everything God is
[1:55:21] answering your prayers at work you're
[1:55:22] making more money you have a nice house
[1:55:24] you drive a nice cars you know you're
[1:55:26] able to save a lot of money everything's
[1:55:27] going smooth we get so comfortable that
[1:55:30] we you they want to go to church anymore
[1:55:32] we don't want to read the scriptures
[1:55:34] anymore because it cares of lies life
[1:55:36] I've taken over and I will miss now
[1:55:39] calling our purpose as believers to put
[1:55:41] it skin on God's Word because God did
[1:55:44] not give this world to just give it
[1:55:46] because it was bored I wanted to run him
[1:55:48] to this mouth God gave his word because
[1:55:51] you want us to become one with the word
[1:55:54] I was seen in each dispensation each
[1:55:56] eight God sending his ministers his
[1:55:57] servants his prophets to bring the work
[1:56:00] so that we can be quickened and become
[1:56:03] close and we'll be becoming one with the
[1:56:05] word hallelujah so putting skin on the
[1:56:10] water go we have to be transformed
[1:56:12] I would say be a transformed by the
[1:56:14] renewing of your mind it's not it didn't
[1:56:17] say renew your mind say the renewing is
[1:56:20] a continuous action I'll go it keeps
[1:56:22] going after constantly renewing your
[1:56:24] mind constantly renew your mind you know
[1:56:27] we see so many types of believers in
[1:56:30] church today the ones one of the images
[1:56:32] are over their houses and the cross of
[1:56:34] God the one across you know in the
[1:56:36] living room and this and that all over
[1:56:37] the place like I said this all this is
[1:56:39] like images the devil is not scared of
[1:56:41] that piece of wood you don't scared of
[1:56:45] that that's an image it's not scared of
[1:56:49] that it doesn't care about the moment
[1:56:54] the moment get a revelation of that I
[1:56:58] don't start walking around with this
[1:57:00] cross I don't get a big cross on my neck
[1:57:02] to walk around because I'm already an
[1:57:05] embodiment of that cross because this is
[1:57:09] just a piece of wood but that piece of
[1:57:12] wood reminds me of something that took
[1:57:15] place 2,000 years ago so I have my
[1:57:19] identity I Know Who I am I know what I'm
[1:57:22] capable of and when the enemy comes
[1:57:24] around like a flood the Spirit of God in
[1:57:26] me we raise our standard against them
[1:57:28] hallelujah
[1:57:35] many times in conclusion we try to shape
[1:57:40] the Word of God to suit our lives
[1:57:44] hallelujah we try okay this product what
[1:57:47] is not applied to us in this last day
[1:57:49] one problem said it it was in 1959 you
[1:57:54] know before the seals and you know I'm
[1:57:56] pretty sure but Braun was alive in this
[1:57:57] generation but I Braun would not preach
[1:57:59] against this for a brahmana pitch
[1:58:01] against that all we're trying to do is
[1:58:04] trim the word down to feed us have you
[1:58:09] ever seen a design a tailor
[1:58:13] goodbye an extra light suit I say but
[1:58:17] the Paul I bought you a suit come over
[1:58:19] here put his suit on and start cutting
[1:58:22] off the suit on brother Paul he doesn't
[1:58:24] work that way
[1:58:25] cuz that's nobody Paul sighs the risk
[1:58:30] must love that designer or that stylist
[1:58:33] is to go to the store
[1:58:35] he knows brother Paul sighs in a liberal
[1:58:38] power needs you know the style but
[1:58:42] because but a Paul is unestablished
[1:58:44] it doesn't have a choice did you scratch
[1:58:48] our stylist he knows what we need it
[1:58:51] knows what is what suits each and we
[1:58:53] knew every one of us so it's gonna bring
[1:58:56] us what we need according as we need
[1:58:58] them it's not like fathers or some
[1:59:02] fathers today that would go give their
[1:59:03] body the 16 year old Bentley's to start
[1:59:06] driving around for stunt car driver that
[1:59:11] that would have that child now mr.
[1:59:13] Chaddha the same thing God does with us
[1:59:16] you bring the servants these ministers
[1:59:18] around it gives us the world to help us
[1:59:21] trim out extra fats extra extra guts
[1:59:25] that we have so we can fit into that
[1:59:28] that out dress of the world that suit of
[1:59:31] the world so that when we put it on it
[1:59:33] looks perfect on us and I say whoo that
[1:59:37] looks good brother that's customary yeah
[1:59:40] I could see that why because if it suits
[1:59:42] you and that's the exact same way the
[1:59:44] Word of God is
[1:59:46] what what a God is for the Bride of
[1:59:48] Christ of Jesus Christ and then what we
[1:59:51] do that's why we see people who struggle
[1:59:52] with your makeup sanding eels and
[1:59:54] whatnot in church today it's become fact
[1:59:57] that they are not applying the road why
[1:59:59] do rightly they are not so dead trimming
[2:00:03] of the part of the world that they don't
[2:00:04] want to listen to and succumb to charge
[2:00:06] in their ills this is come check their
[2:00:08] makeups and then we will start pushing
[2:00:10] about it
[2:00:10] we're gonna keep preaching about it also
[2:00:14] their take up that comment of filthiness
[2:00:18] now put on a garment of the word that's
[2:00:20] designed for them hallelujah contrition
[2:00:24] Bible says perfect love casts out fear
[2:00:29] doubt verse of the scriptures needs us
[2:00:32] to put a skin on it perfect love cast
[2:00:36] out fear when you have fear scared of
[2:00:40] something perfect loss love is missing
[2:00:43] because once perfect love is there it
[2:00:47] can't it can't be in the simplest with
[2:00:48] fear fear is a liar
[2:00:51] God's not gonna speed a fib of love of
[2:00:54] power of sound mind somebody with a
[2:00:58] sound mind knows who they are and then
[2:01:03] this is why the devil talks to decided
[2:01:05] that they were of taxes if I call with a
[2:01:07] Paul and it's standing right in front of
[2:01:10] me and I give me very nice hot slap Wow
[2:01:14] what is your name you will tell me his
[2:01:17] name right away because instead of
[2:01:19] confusion he's gonna figure stuff out it
[2:01:26] can answer that question that point and
[2:01:28] that's I'd never taxes it establishes us
[2:01:32] now what we introduced that we
[2:01:34] stabilized we lose our identity we don't
[2:01:38] know we are anymore
[2:01:39] it gets so distracted by what is going
[2:01:41] around us you get us attracted by the
[2:01:43] fire the earthquakes the diseases and
[2:01:46] the pestilence
[2:01:47] I will meet the still small voice that
[2:01:49] voice that says I will not leave you or
[2:01:52] forsake you but I will come to you I'll
[2:01:54] be with you even unto the hand of the
[2:01:57] world
[2:01:58] amen also we see fear of people losing
[2:02:04] their kids in church today oh my
[2:02:06] goodness my child is not serving God
[2:02:08] he's gonna go to the 2l garden promise

[2:08:02] I'm gonna keep getting from him I don't
[2:08:04] have to ask anymore I gotta believe
[2:08:07] because he knows what I need when I need

[2:08:11] that statement and we got any car my
[2:08:13] wife was so upset the trouble has period
[2:08:16] I said it's okay baby it's alright we're
[2:08:20] in the first year of that period god
[2:08:22] bless us with three different cars
[2:08:25] I didn't have to steal I'd have to do
[2:08:29] anything illegal
[2:08:30] the same doesn't look down on this
[2:08:35] bra has no idea because it's not a
[2:08:37] matter what you do for a living it's all
[2:08:39] about God's blessing I'm on it
[2:08:42] Alleluia and God has been faithful
[2:08:46] we are not rich but we are confident in
[2:08:49] his provision that is modern able
[2:08:52] Alleluia so God wants us to have
[2:08:54] confidence in his word I have faith in
[2:08:57] his word even God had to believe his own
[2:09:00] word he says
[2:09:03] Evelyn earth will pass away but my word
[2:09:08] that's some confidence that's some
[2:09:11] confidence on the part of God that
[2:09:14] listen whatever I say is going to happen
[2:09:19] the Ricky Bobby's will try to talk like
[2:09:22] that but we cancel strikes them they
[2:09:25] can't say that anymore they can add that
[2:09:27] confidence anymore
[2:09:28] but my god it says it it's gonna be that
[2:09:32] way
[2:09:33] it doesn't matter how long he goes it's
[2:09:36] your trouble for got me going for so
[2:09:38] many years the trials may go on for so
[2:09:40] many ways for many years but guess what
[2:09:42] the Word of God will now fall to the
[2:09:44] ground without a admin it's gonna come
[2:09:47] to pass so in this last days this is a
[2:09:50] bride that's gonna put a spin on the
[2:09:53] Word of God as continually putting skin
[2:09:54] on the Word of God day in day out
[2:09:58] president was the mark of the I call in
[2:10:00] Christ Jesus
[2:10:01] so this bride will not fare well where
[2:10:03] he failed
[2:10:04] she would not stumble what ifs ambled
[2:10:07] because she's already part of the world
[2:10:09] and trust me this this bride don't look
[2:10:12] too pretty but she on snow had diamond
[2:10:15] on her beauty is the word Bible says she
[2:10:19] asked the bride has made herself ready
[2:10:21] she is clothed with the Word of God why
[2:10:26] because she asked confidence in now word

[2:12:06] called person town crier so it goes
[2:12:10] around that's any time of the day

[2:12:51] announce the old city that it's only the
[2:12:54] bride and there's a sudden day a sudden
[2:12:57] time sudden month all the verges in the
[2:13:01] city should get ready and be adorned
[2:13:02] putting your best clothes I don't care
[2:13:05] squish mother's three or four months and
[2:13:07] we put on our Christmas clothes get
[2:13:08] ready
[2:13:09] they all got ready
[2:13:14] and the Priya has got on his earth when
[2:13:17] did they came
[2:13:19] with the chariots and you know the ammo
[2:13:21] barriers and whatnot it only helps you
[2:13:23] were over him precedes it some went fine
[2:13:26] I was looking around and everybody was
[2:13:30] uh thought it goes with dancing and
[2:13:32] showing up and you know it was a nice
[2:13:35] all the wood beauty present but there
[2:13:40] was one girl who wasn't ourselves I'm
[2:13:45] both his wife doesn't wanted to go
[2:13:47] nowhere we were made if I see you dress
[2:13:50] up I'm gonna rip that dress off of you
[2:13:52] don't go nowhere but unknowing far she
[2:13:58] was a candidate to Oh Christopher she
[2:14:01] was predestinated to be the princes wife
[2:14:04] so she taught you the Masters wife to
[2:14:07] Elena are bad go outside a strip you do
[2:14:09] yard and do the dishes and all that and
[2:14:11] you know she was outside doing nothing
[2:14:14] but the priest knows what you wanted he
[2:14:18] knows what courage Tara teases bride
[2:14:21] must possess and the beauty of Hollywood
[2:14:25] and the fashion and his child and makeup
[2:14:28] on what now was not was not appealing to
[2:14:30] him
[2:14:30] I was just sister they tried to the same
[2:14:33] thing today you want to get marry so bad
[2:14:36] and I've done this up with makeups and
[2:14:38] whatnot and they just just look like
[2:14:43] like painted monkeys I mean the nails
[2:14:47] fixed their clothes like Keenan's me and
[2:14:51] it just worship in church in and you do
[2:14:53] respond to the word emotions and not
[2:14:56] content and they do hardens things
[2:14:59] because they want to get married so bad
[2:15:01] and then we won't went after truck to
[2:15:03] say complex to other single brothers on
[2:15:06] the visiting brothers in church
[2:15:08] desperation
[2:15:12] but that I've asked and I've never seen
[2:15:14] that help anybody because when you get
[2:15:17] home with that brother
[2:15:18] oh yeah why didn't I and the makeup is
[2:15:21] off I know that is Robert is gonna say
[2:15:25] he was deceived and all the extensions
[2:15:29] come off glory and it sees the patch on
[2:15:32] one side and you know the edges does
[2:15:35] missing he's out he's out
[2:15:41] glory to God so these people got some
[2:15:45] ready but it was like know what I'm not
[2:15:48] happy just like when the Prince of glory
[2:15:51] came down I was running to the street of
[2:15:54] Jerusalem and he wept it says when the
[2:15:59] Son of Man comes back shall you find
[2:16:01] faith and it was discouraged by what is
[2:16:05] so by the condition of the people
[2:16:08] Africa has adopted the traditional
[2:16:10] Pharisees and Sadducees
[2:16:13] it was lucky will I find faith it was
[2:16:16] troubling to him because one of the
[2:16:18] bride it was a longing for one so bad
[2:16:21] and that's why I left glory and his
[2:16:24] mission cannot be defeated it has to be
[2:16:27] completed he can't go back to finance a
[2:16:30] mission failed
[2:16:31] he has to go back to finance a mission
[2:16:33] accomplished
[2:16:35] so this prince was walking around he
[2:16:39] walked past audit all the J's bells in
[2:16:43] the street and it was lying impressed so
[2:16:47] it probably told his armor bearers you
[2:16:49] guys go back I'll be fine I just want to
[2:16:50] go I just won't be alone that's what
[2:16:52] respect is comment so you went he kept
[2:16:55] writing he kept writing but then
[2:16:58] somebody caught his attention down the
[2:17:00] street who sing it that's a beautiful
[2:17:04] voice that resonates who what is in his
[2:17:08] heart just like the statement of Rebecca
[2:17:13] related with what was in the heart of
[2:17:16] Eleazar because she was elected she was
[2:17:19] christened resonated see you can't give
[2:17:22] what you don't have you gotta have it to
[2:17:25] give it she kept singing but rather was
[2:17:29] singing give me the whole time religion
[2:17:31] was that Wow sounds good so he kept
[2:17:35] going kept going then wake up girls
[2:17:38] didn't want the voice sounded so sweet
[2:17:39] in his ears and it got closer she didn't
[2:17:43] know who she was she didn't know what
[2:17:45] was written about her she taught
[2:17:47] practice she was gonna be a maid for the
[2:17:49] rest of my life be a slave she didn't
[2:17:52] know that and she was just doing a theme
[2:17:55] she was too bashful
[2:17:57] I like young women today in church
[2:18:00] they're gonna be in your face like that
[2:18:03] what you gonna do exactly just like that
[2:18:08] don't know bashful but I see growing up
[2:18:11] I see to your younger sister on the
[2:18:13] church very bashful
[2:18:14] respectful how go my dad would mind with
[2:18:18] older brothers in church to visit people
[2:18:20] on Saturdays or go for evangelism or
[2:18:22] witness of shed Bible or pray for people
[2:18:24] in your house I like to go around and I
[2:18:27] will see the sisters come a couple of
[2:18:28] you guys welcome everybody go back
[2:18:29] inside
[2:18:30] not because they can't fellowship but it
[2:18:33] just has a much bashfulness
[2:18:36] unlike a sister these days and she was
[2:18:39] she kept doing what she was doing doing
[2:18:40] the dishes and the guys spoke to her
[2:18:43] what is your name she she stole a glass
[2:18:49] she told him is our name why you know
[2:18:52] how they didn't you know the Prince
[2:18:54] wants to get married and I ain't no a
[2:18:56] virgin I'm a virgin I kept myself all
[2:18:59] these years but my master's wife doesn't
[2:19:03] want me to go out there oh wow
[2:19:06] he saw the innocence in that voice she
[2:19:10] has not be corrupted by the doctrines
[2:19:13] and creeds and the traditions of people
[2:19:15] in that night day because the Prince
[2:19:17] asked to get married to a pure virgin
[2:19:21] bride here's the whole bow don't you
[2:19:26] have family not don't it's just me okay
[2:19:32] I want a bright and I want you to be my
[2:19:35] bride

[2:19:38] was doing what sir
[2:19:41] dang any right yeah me I know
[2:19:49] I just want you to say yes
[2:19:52] and that is what Jesus is expected for
[2:19:54] the people to say to the just yes say

[2:20:01] want your excuses it doesn't want your

[2:20:07] decision if I'm gonna go with him or not

[2:20:16] word out of the mouth yes okay all
