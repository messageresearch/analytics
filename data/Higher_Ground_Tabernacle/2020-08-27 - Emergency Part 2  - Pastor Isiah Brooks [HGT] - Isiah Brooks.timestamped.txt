[28:00] yes
[28:14] oh
[28:28] everybody
[28:56] oh
[29:10] um
[29:38] uh
[36:52] so
[38:16] so
[42:14] uh
[42:28] ah
[42:56] oh
[43:24] uh
[43:52] um
[44:06] god
[46:12] oh
[46:26] uh
[47:08] oh
[47:22] um
[54:26] i believe i left my water back there if
[54:28] somebody could give me some water please
[54:31] we were talking last time we ministered
[54:34] on the
[54:34] emergency and how urgent it is for us
[54:38] not only to
[54:39] see what god is doing thank you brother
[54:41] but become a part of what he's doing
[54:45] we know in the last days that many will
[54:47] fall short
[54:49] when it comes to the perfect will of god
[54:53] and the bible said we ought to be
[54:55] careful
[54:56] like in hebrews i think it's the fourth
[54:58] chapter we ought to be careful
[54:59] as we fall short of his glory of his
[55:03] coming
[55:04] you and i must realize that this is a
[55:07] serious hour
[55:09] but this is an hour that you're going to
[55:10] find yourself
[55:12] alone many times
[55:16] because that's what god wants
[55:20] out of you this is an individual affair
[55:24] and he's looking for those amen who will
[55:26] individually
[55:28] walk with him this is the greatest hour
[55:31] ever
[55:32] we know that this is the ending of it
[55:35] all
[55:36] a friend of mine who i hadn't seen in a
[55:38] long time
[55:40] uh called i called him and anyway we saw
[55:43] each other and called each other however
[55:44] you want to go
[55:45] with that and he said brother books he
[55:48] said
[55:48] he said do you really believe this is
[55:50] the end time or i say yes
[55:52] i really believe that this thing that
[55:55] we're going through now is ushering us
[55:57] into
[55:58] the coming of the lord and it's amazing
[56:01] because
[56:02] he being one that who's uh uh
[56:05] haven't declared himself to be a
[56:08] christian
[56:09] yet but he believes that
[56:13] the hour that we're now living is the
[56:16] end time
[56:17] and he has been following certain things
[56:19] on the news and things like that and so
[56:21] i tried to tell him some things even
[56:23] about
[56:24] what how it's going to end up this is
[56:27] the beginning
[56:29] somewhat of a new relationship with him
[56:31] and i trust that god will
[56:33] give me wisdom and unders to understand
[56:35] where he's at and what i need to do to
[56:38] minister to him to say all of those
[56:41] things
[56:41] we talked about uh the urgency and we we
[56:44] know that
[56:46] the urgency it deals with the seven
[56:49] seals
[56:50] and the un uh the uh uh the the seven
[56:53] thunders and the this end time message
[56:57] see william branham and when he came
[56:59] being the seventh angel message
[57:01] juror he literally came for the purpose
[57:06] that god would use him in the opening of
[57:09] the seals
[57:11] and the revealing of the seven thunders
[57:14] that was his main message and
[57:16] everything else he just pulled together
[57:18] like elijah
[57:19] and tied up all the loose ends but he
[57:22] left us with something
[57:24] and only the spiritual eye will ever
[57:26] catch we'll be able to catch it
[57:28] this seven message the seven thunders we
[57:30] we we look at uh
[57:32] thousands of people now that say that
[57:35] they're in the message
[57:37] but because they say that it doesn't
[57:41] say that it's true many could have said
[57:44] in the days of moses we're in the
[57:46] message of moses and
[57:48] we find out that the majority of the
[57:49] people that followed moses was lost
[57:53] and jesus christ being the same
[57:55] yesterday today and forever it's going
[57:56] to be the same
[57:59] you're going to find out as the day goes
[58:01] on
[58:02] and the coming of the lord gets closer
[58:05] you're going to find out that there'll
[58:06] be many people who would compromise the
[58:08] word
[58:09] and compromise their lives and
[58:13] really they can't not help it only
[58:16] the bride of jesus christ will be able
[58:18] to
[58:19] accomplish the purpose of god
[58:22] and it won't be her doing it's not
[58:26] by power not by might
[58:30] but by the spirit of the lord
[58:33] god himself is the one who's working
[58:37] this thing out is that right
[58:40] because paul said is not i that lives
[58:44] but christ that lives in me
[58:47] one of the most difficult things for us
[58:49] to do
[58:51] is to let go and let god
[58:54] our daily struggle is not with just
[58:57] satan
[58:58] and our greatest struggle is with self
[59:01] and self will and when god can get a man
[59:05] to deny his
[59:06] own will to serve
[59:09] god's his will then he knows that he has
[59:12] a great man in his hands let's put it
[59:16] this way
[59:16] paul said i am a prisoner of christ
[59:20] and and paul shows how he was such a
[59:23] prisoner because when god told him not
[59:25] to go a place he didn't go
[59:28] hallelujah even though his heart desire
[59:30] was to go a place he didn't go
[59:33] he served god according to god's will
[59:36] and not his own we realize by god's
[59:40] grace that we're talking about a meeting
[59:42] in the air
[59:43] we're talking about the the end time
[59:45] we're talking about how god is
[59:47] trying to get us to a place that we can
[59:49] be translated
[59:51] to me i think it's just such a slap in
[59:54] satan's face
[59:55] when satan wake up and realize that
[59:59] all that he fought for and everything he
[1:00:02] tried to establish
[1:00:04] has become to naught it becomes ruined
[1:00:09] and we realize amen that god
[1:00:12] is god and and he does things the way he
[1:00:15] wants to do them
[1:00:17] but in my studying i was just thinking
[1:00:19] about the rapture because that's what my
[1:00:21] whole goal is is not
[1:00:22] not to make a rapture only you know i'm
[1:00:25] not
[1:00:26] not trying to serve god to to miss hell
[1:00:29] i serve god because i love him i get
[1:00:32] disappointed in myself
[1:00:34] because i mean i fail him every day
[1:00:38] sometimes i look at myself and i think
[1:00:40] to myself
[1:00:41] how can god put up with me but really
[1:00:45] he doesn't have a choice because he
[1:00:47] chose me
[1:00:49] and when god chooses you he never goes
[1:00:51] back on his choosing it's
[1:00:53] it's a perfect choosing thank god
[1:00:56] because he
[1:00:56] know that if adam and eve had not fallen
[1:01:01] he knows that my earnest desire
[1:01:04] is to do his perfect will he knows that
[1:01:07] in spite of all my frailties in spite of
[1:01:09] all my faults in spot
[1:01:11] fight of spite of all my my failures
[1:01:14] he knows the inner man and he knows
[1:01:18] by his grace that this man who is so
[1:01:20] frail and this man who falls so often
[1:01:24] one day will not be that way amen
[1:01:27] because there is a power
[1:01:29] that's working on the inside
[1:01:32] and this power is his power
[1:01:35] conquering death conquering darkness
[1:01:39] conquering every demon of hell you love
[1:01:41] the lord
[1:01:46] anyway brother branham tells us that
[1:01:47] every song is inspired
[1:01:49] he talks about the psalms and he said i
[1:01:52] believe they were songs but i'm gonna
[1:01:53] read this little quote before i start my
[1:01:55] message
[1:01:56] brother balaam says amen in the message
[1:01:59] thirst
[1:02:00] any things that in the bible is inspired
[1:02:04] whether it's history whether it's songs
[1:02:07] whether it is it is whatever it is
[1:02:11] it's inspired jesus said have not you
[1:02:14] read what david said in the psalms
[1:02:17] and then i think psalms of course is
[1:02:20] songs
[1:02:22] and if songs are inspired of god which i
[1:02:25] believe they are
[1:02:26] and prophetic also i hope
[1:02:30] i am standing that day when this song
[1:02:33] comes to pass
[1:02:36] there is going to be a meeting in the
[1:02:38] air
[1:02:40] in that sweet sweet by-and-by
[1:02:44] going to meet you and greet you over
[1:02:46] there in that home
[1:02:49] beyond the sky such singing
[1:02:54] ever heard ever heard by mortal's ear
[1:02:58] it'll be glorious i declare and god's
[1:03:02] own son will be the leading one
[1:03:06] at that meeting in the air he said oh
[1:03:10] i want to be there at that time
[1:03:16] and that's why it's an urgency to me
[1:03:18] that's why it's an emergency to me
[1:03:22] the bible says make your calling and
[1:03:23] election sure
[1:03:25] make it sure don't we're not in an hour
[1:03:28] that we should be hoping
[1:03:30] this is the hour of no soul make your
[1:03:33] calling and election sure
[1:03:34] let me tell you something which a lot of
[1:03:36] people don't understand
[1:03:38] when the message caught you when it
[1:03:41] calls you
[1:03:43] when it opened to you and it made you
[1:03:46] see that this
[1:03:46] is the message and this message is none
[1:03:50] other than jesus christ
[1:03:52] in word form and when you caught that
[1:03:55] message
[1:03:56] and you realize to you it was a pearl
[1:04:00] it was something that you've been
[1:04:01] looking for and it is something that you
[1:04:03] know you could never give up
[1:04:05] you understand me you know that is a
[1:04:08] token
[1:04:10] if i could say it like this it's it's
[1:04:12] it's something that declares you to be
[1:04:14] bribed
[1:04:16] because you can't give it up and it
[1:04:19] can't give you up
[1:04:21] no matter how many people have
[1:04:24] and whatever interpretations they have
[1:04:28] it doesn't affect you because you have a
[1:04:31] personal revelation of jesus christ
[1:04:33] yourself
[1:04:35] something this message has done for you
[1:04:38] that no one else can do for you and that
[1:04:42] little
[1:04:42] something anchors you and that little
[1:04:45] something will
[1:04:46] cause you to grow into the full statue
[1:04:49] of christ
[1:04:50] which is a new birth
[1:04:55] think about it in the beginning in
[1:04:58] ephesus age
[1:04:59] people were birthed into faith
[1:05:02] they didn't know what what what we know
[1:05:05] per se
[1:05:06] now of course they had
[1:05:08] all of the statues the divine nature of
[1:05:12] god otherwise they could not have been
[1:05:13] called christians and they could have
[1:05:14] not
[1:05:15] have been doing what they were doing
[1:05:18] and understand by god's grace the thing
[1:05:20] that that irked or disturbed the world
[1:05:23] of that day is because
[1:05:25] these people had no particular dwelling
[1:05:28] place
[1:05:30] and you know they were roaming
[1:05:32] everywhere
[1:05:34] interrupting everybody pulling people
[1:05:37] out of churches
[1:05:39] pulling people off the street and these
[1:05:43] people
[1:05:43] disturbed the regular church system
[1:05:48] and they couldn't help it because it was
[1:05:51] christ
[1:05:52] in them causing them to do what they
[1:05:55] were doing
[1:05:57] now we we want to say it like this
[1:06:02] and identify masterpiece the prophet of
[1:06:04] god said you better have
[1:06:06] christ in you because that's the word
[1:06:10] eternal and that word is what will raise
[1:06:13] you
[1:06:14] up again you become part of that word
[1:06:18] and you identified with the word
[1:06:22] i wondered why he kept saying in
[1:06:24] different places
[1:06:25] that you must be a part of that word
[1:06:28] it means that every portion of the word
[1:06:32] every segment of the word whether it was
[1:06:34] from emphasis all the way
[1:06:36] up they had a part of the word that was
[1:06:39] that was their part and they had to live
[1:06:42] that part hallelujah and
[1:06:46] but when it comes to us the full word is
[1:06:49] now
[1:06:50] in our possession not just the part
[1:06:53] of food the full word
[1:06:56] now i want you to understand i'm not
[1:06:58] speaking intellectually
[1:07:00] here now because there's no way that i
[1:07:03] could grasp
[1:07:04] the entire book in my head
[1:07:08] hallelujah but there's the author
[1:07:12] there's the one who created this who
[1:07:14] spoke this
[1:07:16] right he's the one that i can have
[1:07:19] and i can have all of him
[1:07:23] not just a portion but all of him and
[1:07:26] i'm explaining that in just a moment
[1:07:28] when we talk about anticipation
[1:07:32] i don't know about you but i am in
[1:07:34] anticipation
[1:07:36] and i realize that in this time
[1:07:39] that we're waiting god is doing a mighty
[1:07:43] work in the believer
[1:07:45] so many people around this message
[1:07:47] cannot even
[1:07:49] see what god is doing
[1:07:52] and god will leave them in their folly
[1:07:55] because we are at a time that we must
[1:07:58] focus
[1:08:00] focus on one thing
[1:08:03] and that is the what if that is what is
[1:08:06] the will of god
[1:08:08] for my day and whatever that will
[1:08:12] is that's what i'm going to do
[1:08:15] now we can see and look at brother
[1:08:17] branham we can see what the messenger
[1:08:19] did and
[1:08:20] what god used him for and all of those
[1:08:22] things and
[1:08:23] we have no idea
[1:08:26] the the pressure and the things he
[1:08:30] had to go through in order to be who he
[1:08:33] was
[1:08:33] and to deliver this message knowing
[1:08:37] that 90 of the people that he was
[1:08:40] preaching to
[1:08:41] was in opposition to what he was
[1:08:44] preaching
[1:08:45] he stood alone because he had an anchor
[1:08:49] something anchored him and
[1:08:52] and and he couldn't get away from it he
[1:08:54] was like paul he was a prisoner
[1:08:57] he had to even speak amen things that he
[1:08:59] didn't want to speak
[1:09:01] but he spoke it anyway just to do the
[1:09:04] will of god and you and i must
[1:09:06] understand
[1:09:07] that that's where we must come to
[1:09:11] you know i can't you know have my will
[1:09:13] and his will too
[1:09:15] you can't be like eve i'm gonna have my
[1:09:17] will and his will too
[1:09:18] it won't work that's why he said we must
[1:09:21] die and rot daily we must die and rot
[1:09:24] when we talk about anticipation i am
[1:09:27] anticipating
[1:09:29] god to do a mighty work in me
[1:09:32] he's working now he's working but
[1:09:35] there's more of him to come
[1:09:37] this is what the the mystery somewhat of
[1:09:41] this
[1:09:41] the seven seals and the seven thunders
[1:09:43] is all about
[1:09:45] those seven thunders were for a special
[1:09:47] people
[1:09:49] anybody could read the seals perhaps and
[1:09:52] get an
[1:09:52] idea what it's all about but when it
[1:09:55] comes as i
[1:09:56] preached the last time about that scroll
[1:10:00] that seal scroll that part of the scroll
[1:10:03] that only the
[1:10:04] the the owner knew what it what was on
[1:10:07] on the ledger of it
[1:10:09] and we find out that god amen
[1:10:12] has something in that for us because
[1:10:17] those scrolls
[1:10:21] were then loosed call it the seven
[1:10:24] thunders if you like
[1:10:26] it was revealed it was unveiled
[1:10:32] and it's in there
[1:10:35] it's in there he said to israel we're
[1:10:38] going to possess this land
[1:10:40] again and what land you're talking about
[1:10:44] the land that adam lost
[1:10:48] not just it wasn't just for that day it
[1:10:50] was a word of prophecy
[1:10:53] not just for israel alone but all who
[1:10:56] believe
[1:10:56] all who receive all of sons and
[1:10:59] daughters of god
[1:11:01] god has promised we're going to possess
[1:11:04] that land
[1:11:05] and listen it won't be ragged it won't
[1:11:09] be void
[1:11:10] it won't be messed up like lucifer did
[1:11:12] it in the beginning
[1:11:14] it's going to be a beautiful place
[1:11:18] can you imagine no bills to pay
[1:11:22] no headaches no sicknesses no
[1:11:24] thunderstorms
[1:11:26] nothing of this world
[1:11:30] will would ever come up as a memory
[1:11:34] nothing all that we see all that we feel
[1:11:38] all that we hear all that we see and you
[1:11:41] and i know
[1:11:43] that the bible is right everything that
[1:11:47] god has prophesied
[1:11:48] has come to pass is that right
[1:11:51] he told noah it was going to rain it
[1:11:53] rained
[1:11:54] he told israel amen after 400 years i'm
[1:11:56] going to visit you
[1:11:57] and i'm going to bring you out of egypt
[1:12:00] he did it
[1:12:01] hallelujah he prophesied that jesus
[1:12:03] christ was coming
[1:12:04] he came he prophesied he would
[1:12:07] uh uh defeat satan death hell in the
[1:12:10] grave
[1:12:11] he enraged from the dead and he did it
[1:12:14] everything the bible promised
[1:12:16] he promised us malachi 4 and he came
[1:12:20] think about it thousands of years
[1:12:25] before malachi 4 came but he came
[1:12:29] so it doesn't matter how long it takes
[1:12:32] once god
[1:12:32] prophesied or speak a word it must come
[1:12:35] to pass
[1:12:37] hallelujah it cannot fail
[1:12:40] don't you say oh well lord i don't ask
[1:12:43] you for this and
[1:12:44] it's been a long a long time
[1:12:48] what is a long time
[1:12:52] abraham had to wait 25 years
[1:12:55] for his promise to come to pass
[1:12:58] but he never disbelieved the promise
[1:13:04] doesn't matter i'm going to see
[1:13:06] perfection
[1:13:08] i'm going to see christ in me fully
[1:13:12] i'm going to see the third pool in
[1:13:15] action
[1:13:16] he promised it so will you
[1:13:20] let me move on anticipation means to
[1:13:23] realize beforehand or foretaste or
[1:13:26] foresee
[1:13:27] or to anticipate pleasure to expect
[1:13:31] look forward to to be sure of
[1:13:34] is that right it's like anna and simeon
[1:13:37] they were anticipating
[1:13:39] the coming of the messiah and like i
[1:13:41] tried to tell people
[1:13:42] i said god comes in such a way we if he
[1:13:45] doesn't reveal it to you
[1:13:47] you won't see it everybody was looking
[1:13:50] for the coming of
[1:13:51] the messiah and anna and simeon saw it
[1:13:54] before anyone else
[1:13:56] hallelujah and then he goes on for 12
[1:13:58] years
[1:14:00] right and then they see him already in
[1:14:02] the temple what was he doing
[1:14:03] that little boy at 12 years old was
[1:14:05] confounding the wise
[1:14:07] hallelujah and he declared to even uh
[1:14:10] his
[1:14:11] uh uh mary and joseph who he was
[1:14:15] hallelujah he told him she said i'm
[1:14:18] about my father's business
[1:14:21] hallelujah y'all understand what i'm
[1:14:22] saying what was he doing
[1:14:24] somehow mary had forgotten who he was
[1:14:28] she forgot the visitation of the angel
[1:14:30] and god comes along
[1:14:32] and revealed it so let me say it like
[1:14:34] this how often
[1:14:37] what is it that people don't understand
[1:14:41] god has appointed time to reveal himself
[1:14:44] to you
[1:14:45] everybody don't get revelation at the
[1:14:47] same time
[1:14:49] it's in god's own time in his own period
[1:14:52] before he reveals himself to you
[1:14:55] and every time he reveals it to you it
[1:14:58] will be according
[1:15:00] it would be in a way that you can
[1:15:01] understand
[1:15:03] who he is how many of us would have seen
[1:15:06] him
[1:15:06] like anna and simeon there in the temple
[1:15:08] in the bay as a babe
[1:15:10] and they knew this was the messiah
[1:15:15] yet thomas and all the others
[1:15:19] walked with him for three and a half
[1:15:21] years and still didn't see
[1:15:23] who he really was and jesus had to pull
[1:15:26] the question out
[1:15:27] who do men say that i am huh
[1:15:31] that what do you understand what i'm
[1:15:33] saying people in the message expect for
[1:15:35] you to read this message
[1:15:37] and understand it perfectly
[1:15:41] even this message unfolds
[1:15:45] to individuals at different times
[1:15:50] hallelujah what are you going to say
[1:15:52] about paul
[1:15:53] who never saw jesus christ in the flesh
[1:15:57] hallelujah but he came out of the desert
[1:16:01] with a greater revelation than the 12
[1:16:04] that followed him
[1:16:06] hallelujah he came out and guess what
[1:16:09] he superseded all of the others
[1:16:12] in his revelation so much so that peter
[1:16:15] said
[1:16:16] paul speaks and right things that are
[1:16:20] sometimes hard to be understood
[1:16:23] hallelujah why because even paul didn't
[1:16:26] have just a
[1:16:27] intellectual revelation he had a
[1:16:29] revelation amen
[1:16:31] an inspiration amen that came from god
[1:16:33] that he visited god
[1:16:35] hallelujah is that all right visited
[1:16:37] heaven
[1:16:39] so you say well what are you saying all
[1:16:40] of these things because i want you to
[1:16:42] understand
[1:16:43] the message god whole
[1:16:46] creation everything had a three-fold
[1:16:49] purpose
[1:16:50] he had a three-pole purpose but his main
[1:16:53] objection
[1:16:54] his whole thing was to have preeminence
[1:16:57] over his oh
[1:16:58] all of his creation is that right the
[1:17:00] first thing he told adam
[1:17:03] adam i want you to subdue
[1:17:06] i want you to have preeminence of
[1:17:09] everything i have created for you i want
[1:17:11] you to have preeminence
[1:17:13] is that right that's what he said i want
[1:17:15] you to be god
[1:17:16] over all that i've given you i want you
[1:17:18] to have preeminence
[1:17:20] understand where i'm talking about if
[1:17:22] that was what was given
[1:17:24] to adam in the beginning it is the same
[1:17:27] thing that's given to us
[1:17:29] hallelujah this is what the opening of
[1:17:31] the word was all about
[1:17:33] you know even in all my preaching i
[1:17:35] still got people criticizing what i'm
[1:17:37] preaching
[1:17:37] but it doesn't matter i'm preaching to
[1:17:40] the bride of jesus
[1:17:42] and i'm preaching the portion of the
[1:17:44] word in which god has given me
[1:17:46] i'm not wrestling against somebody
[1:17:48] else's theology or somebody else's
[1:17:50] explanation of what they have
[1:17:52] that's not what i won't have to give
[1:17:54] account for that
[1:17:55] i must give an account only for what god
[1:17:58] is revealing to me
[1:18:02] hallelujah
[1:18:05] people let me tell you something brother
[1:18:07] branham said
[1:18:08] if you cannot live your revelation you
[1:18:11] have the wrong
[1:18:12] revelation
[1:18:15] hello of christ of christ
[1:18:18] if you can't have if you say oh brother
[1:18:21] that's why i was trying to tell the lord
[1:18:22] the other day i says lord you know i'm
[1:18:25] so tired of
[1:18:26] my foolishness
[1:18:30] you know what the problem is i gotta let
[1:18:34] go and let god
[1:18:37] my will must die in every aspect of my
[1:18:40] life
[1:18:41] i must rot and i'm willing to do so
[1:18:47] think about it now we're in a day and i
[1:18:50] don't mean to go so slow
[1:18:52] but we're in a day we hear people
[1:18:55] talking about the mighty angel
[1:18:57] revelation 10 1 has come down
[1:18:59] don't you know it's more to that than
[1:19:01] that
[1:19:03] it's more to that than knowledge and if
[1:19:05] he came down where is he
[1:19:08] who was he
[1:19:12] it was christ and that mighty angel came
[1:19:16] down
[1:19:19] and he's still here oh i got something
[1:19:22] if i could just put it to you the way
[1:19:23] god gave it to me
[1:19:25] it's going to be a blessing to you
[1:19:28] brother brown says just think of it
[1:19:30] an angel clothed in a cloud and a
[1:19:32] rainbow covered over his head
[1:19:34] while you know what it is that is put
[1:19:37] one foot on the land and one foot on the
[1:19:39] sea and lifted up his hand
[1:19:41] and swore that when them seven thunders
[1:19:44] utter divorce
[1:19:45] that time would be no more
[1:19:48] time will be no more everything is
[1:19:50] winding up
[1:19:52] everything is ending up and we've had
[1:19:54] this message
[1:19:55] since 63 and what have you seen in it
[1:20:00] y'all understand what i'm saying why
[1:20:03] because we developed a system
[1:20:06] instead of getting the people of christ
[1:20:08] we brought them to a system
[1:20:10] i keep saying that because we need
[1:20:13] christ
[1:20:14] we need the holy ghost it is the holy
[1:20:17] ghost
[1:20:18] that leads us the system can never get
[1:20:20] us to heaven
[1:20:21] it's an old trick of the devil
[1:20:24] no trick
[1:20:29] it's not just just just uh uttering what
[1:20:32] brother branham said because
[1:20:33] that's exactly what those pharisees and
[1:20:35] sadducees said to jesus
[1:20:37] well moses said
[1:20:40] huh and jesus had to correct him and
[1:20:42] says before
[1:20:43] abraham was i am huh
[1:20:47] he he was trying to get them to see
[1:20:49] something but they could not see it
[1:20:51] because they were blinded
[1:20:52] because the word said they would be
[1:20:54] blinded not
[1:20:56] boasting against israel they were
[1:20:58] blinded for us who the gentiles would
[1:21:00] come in
[1:21:01] now we're living in the same day same
[1:21:03] kind of day
[1:21:05] where the gentiles are blinded
[1:21:08] hallelujah
[1:21:10] blinded to the truth they want their
[1:21:12] systems they want their
[1:21:14] their their their their cane offering
[1:21:17] it didn't work then and it won't work
[1:21:19] now hallelujah
[1:21:21] think about it he said when them seven
[1:21:23] thunders utter their voices
[1:21:25] that time would be no more and if the
[1:21:27] ministry now brother branham
[1:21:29] he's working with something because he's
[1:21:30] trying to fill it out he's a prophet
[1:21:32] he's filling the pool and he's saying
[1:21:34] now and that's why he ministered
[1:21:36] is this the sign of the time so he he
[1:21:38] has a question mark
[1:21:40] because he's he's trying to figure out
[1:21:42] what this pool is what is god doing here
[1:21:45] well it's just the time he knows there's
[1:21:47] a portion of the word that has to be
[1:21:49] opened
[1:21:50] and he knows that and he's looking at it
[1:21:52] inside he's trying to get over to the
[1:21:53] people because
[1:21:54] so many super natural things are
[1:21:56] happening around this time
[1:21:58] and he's trying to get us to see now
[1:22:00] this is in 1962.
[1:22:02] this is what 2020.
[1:22:06] and you and i we we're still slugging
[1:22:09] along
[1:22:10] instead of looking into the word of god
[1:22:12] like he said
[1:22:14] laying in the presence of the son it
[1:22:17] ain't about reading
[1:22:18] it's about meditating on it it's about
[1:22:20] letting god
[1:22:21] take that word from your head and place
[1:22:24] it into your heart
[1:22:31] if the ministry of the mysteries of god
[1:22:33] is finished
[1:22:35] what if that is then seven mysteries
[1:22:38] coming forth
[1:22:40] you already said if the mystery of god
[1:22:42] if it's finished
[1:22:43] then what is those seven thunders coming
[1:22:46] forth what is it
[1:22:48] what if that is the seven mysteries
[1:22:50] coming forth
[1:22:51] or a humble little church like ours that
[1:22:53] the almighty has come and
[1:22:55] regarded the lower state of his people
[1:22:56] just to say what i don't think so it
[1:22:59] might be
[1:23:00] not be but if it is
[1:23:03] then time has run out did you think it
[1:23:06] be serious it may be later than we think
[1:23:11] now if time was running out then think
[1:23:14] about where we are now
[1:23:16] that's the trick of the devil i know
[1:23:18] it's difficult amen if you're planting
[1:23:20] tater potatoes to continue
[1:23:22] plant potatoes but if you have an
[1:23:24] assurance
[1:23:26] that when the raptor take place you can
[1:23:28] plant your potatoes
[1:23:30] in fact you can you can harvest and cook
[1:23:32] them too because you know no matter what
[1:23:34] you do
[1:23:35] you're going you understand when we talk
[1:23:39] about
[1:23:39] mnd the election of god and i love that
[1:23:42] because
[1:23:44] when i think about the election of god i
[1:23:47] realized by god's grace that
[1:23:49] he chose me there's no way that i could
[1:23:53] work myself into this bride
[1:23:56] and no matter how much i listen to this
[1:23:58] message day by day day by day
[1:24:01] if i'm not bright i'll never catch it
[1:24:04] i never understand it and it's so simple
[1:24:07] but everybody make it so deep
[1:24:10] so complicated you know what i'm saying
[1:24:14] and you know and that's the way the
[1:24:15] devil the devil showed
[1:24:17] uh eve science and god told eve they
[1:24:20] could have
[1:24:21] babies by faith but she wanted science
[1:24:24] she wanted the complicated way
[1:24:26] and she got it right so listen
[1:24:30] he goes on and says he says
[1:24:33] these stars falling into their
[1:24:35] constellation back yonder
[1:24:37] that angel coming and said as john was
[1:24:39] sent to
[1:24:40] wind up the old testament and to bring
[1:24:42] forth the introduction of christ
[1:24:44] a message will wind up the loose ends
[1:24:46] and we'll introduce the messiah
[1:24:48] just before his coming the message
[1:24:51] of the last days and i'm thinking now
[1:24:54] okay we're looking we're looking way out
[1:24:57] there
[1:24:59] right and here he's introduced the
[1:25:02] messiah
[1:25:04] and messiah came amen when you say oh i
[1:25:08] don't believe that
[1:25:08] you don't have to but my point is where
[1:25:10] are you going to fit
[1:25:13] what happened in 1963 in the bible
[1:25:16] it has to be there
[1:25:20] it's got to be there and it is there
[1:25:24] now i know some people well he's here
[1:25:27] and
[1:25:28] brother said there will be a corporal
[1:25:29] coming however he does it
[1:25:32] that's his business brother branham said
[1:25:34] amen god will
[1:25:35] interpret his own word but you can't
[1:25:38] dismiss the cloud you can't dismiss
[1:25:41] the seven thunders you can't do that
[1:25:43] that is the fullness of the message
[1:25:46] that is the thing that god hid from the
[1:25:49] foundation
[1:25:50] of the world and i'm gonna try to
[1:25:53] explain as much
[1:25:54] of it as i possibly can now there's a
[1:25:57] part that i'll never be able to explain
[1:25:59] brother branham couldn't do it himself
[1:26:01] hallelujah there's a part of that that
[1:26:03] only god will explain to you
[1:26:05] that's how intimate the relationship
[1:26:07] must be
[1:26:09] right now he's come in 1963.
[1:26:13] you see him you see him on earth
[1:26:17] and you see him in heaven is that
[1:26:20] y'all get it all right because in
[1:26:23] revelation 10 1 when the mighty angel
[1:26:25] was up there there was also the seventh
[1:26:27] angel down
[1:26:29] on the earth and that seventh angel
[1:26:32] was reflecting the mighty angel
[1:26:36] and what god was doing in that day he
[1:26:39] was
[1:26:39] introducing he was trying to show you
[1:26:42] the scripture says
[1:26:44] look up for your redemption darth 9
[1:26:48] when when all this chaotic stuff starts
[1:26:51] don't be so concerned with it
[1:26:54] look up at the cloud look up at the
[1:26:57] promise
[1:26:58] look up what at the head
[1:27:01] the capstone oh i can't i wish i could
[1:27:04] say it like i see it
[1:27:05] because i want you to realize it's more
[1:27:07] to it that's why the devil attacked it
[1:27:09] this year
[1:27:11] in this season right he didn't have
[1:27:14] nobody else's doctrine to attack
[1:27:16] but he attacked the cloud to say it
[1:27:19] ain't real
[1:27:20] it wasn't there it didn't happen
[1:27:24] and i want to tell everybody that says
[1:27:26] stupid stuff like that
[1:27:28] you're too late it doesn't happen
[1:27:31] and he done did it
[1:27:36] hallelujah and what people don't
[1:27:38] understand
[1:27:39] is that the word that he gave us
[1:27:44] was the very head the intelligence of
[1:27:47] god intelligence of god
[1:27:49] it was something that the devil never
[1:27:51] had
[1:27:54] hallelujah he said what are you saying
[1:27:57] brother brooke
[1:27:57] oh oh you let me hurry up let me hurry
[1:28:00] up
[1:28:01] but the whole point that he brought this
[1:28:03] for is that
[1:28:04] he came so that we can have preeminence
[1:28:09] now i'm gonna unfold by god's grace try
[1:28:11] to get to where i need to go
[1:28:13] because paul when he says i'm a prisoner
[1:28:16] of christ
[1:28:17] a lot of us don't even know what that is
[1:28:18] yet because we got too much will still
[1:28:21] living
[1:28:22] we all got to die we want to be a
[1:28:24] prisoner but the only way we can be is
[1:28:26] we must die
[1:28:28] and rock to our own will it is a process
[1:28:31] hello now you and i must understand
[1:28:36] the first thing was that that god wanted
[1:28:40] to do was to reveal himself
[1:28:42] to his people that was the main thing
[1:28:44] that he wanted to do especially after
[1:28:46] the fall
[1:28:47] that was part of the redemption that's
[1:28:49] why when he pulled
[1:28:50] abraham he abraham didn't know him
[1:28:53] abraham didn't even know who he was but
[1:28:56] god knew who abraham was
[1:28:58] and so god wanted to reveal himself to
[1:29:00] abraham
[1:29:01] and you can see through abraham's path
[1:29:04] through his way of going
[1:29:05] god revealed himself in so many ways
[1:29:09] jehovah jar and things like that those
[1:29:12] were just
[1:29:12] portions of god portions of his
[1:29:14] character that he wanted to
[1:29:16] his creation to see and that's the way
[1:29:18] brother brown said god wants his
[1:29:20] creation to see the fullness
[1:29:23] of himself what's all in him because
[1:29:26] you know when we get to heaven we don't
[1:29:28] want any questions
[1:29:30] i wonder whether he can do this i wonder
[1:29:31] whether he can do that
[1:29:33] it's here that he's proving he he's
[1:29:35] proving himself to us
[1:29:38] he is god and think about it
[1:29:41] he's trying to get you to see that you
[1:29:44] are too
[1:29:46] you are part of him that's what this
[1:29:48] whole thing is
[1:29:49] that's why we can't be part of a
[1:29:51] denomination or
[1:29:52] organization or any man's system we're
[1:29:55] free born
[1:29:57] we must stay freeborn
[1:30:01] the threefold purpose of god prophet god
[1:30:04] said first to express himself
[1:30:06] completely god in christ
[1:30:10] and the bible tells us that in jesus
[1:30:13] dwelt the fullness
[1:30:15] of the godhead bodily second
[1:30:19] to have the preeminence like this in his
[1:30:21] church
[1:30:22] which is his body the bride till he
[1:30:26] could have the preeminence
[1:30:27] to express himself through them
[1:30:30] did y'all hear what i said it's hard
[1:30:34] hey somebody help me here what it is
[1:30:36] brother branham when he talks about the
[1:30:38] third pool did you know the third pool
[1:30:39] you know he had three
[1:30:41] pools and three foes to his his ministry
[1:30:46] is that right yes that's what he did and
[1:30:49] we understood the third four what we
[1:30:51] call it oh it's the opening of the word
[1:30:52] opening of the word what is the opening
[1:30:56] of the word
[1:30:57] it's the revealing it's when the word
[1:31:01] that has now kept his mouth
[1:31:02] shut is beginning to speak
[1:31:06] right because you can't seal up nobody's
[1:31:09] word
[1:31:10] the only way you seal up a word is to
[1:31:11] seal the mouth
[1:31:13] you don't speak it and when daniel
[1:31:16] sealed up the book
[1:31:18] he sealed up the word there was nothing
[1:31:21] being spoken
[1:31:23] it was a secret and even throughout the
[1:31:26] ages
[1:31:27] these theologians they looked through
[1:31:30] the word they tried to
[1:31:31] unbreak to break the word but it
[1:31:32] wouldn't speak back to them
[1:31:35] why because they needed a prophet
[1:31:38] it takes a prophet it meant to unveil
[1:31:40] the
[1:31:41] the the written word to speak the
[1:31:44] revelation
[1:31:45] of what god has written that's what it
[1:31:48] takes
[1:31:52] and thirdly to restore the kingdom
[1:31:56] to its rightly position that fell by sin
[1:32:00] by the first adam
[1:32:02] back to where he walked in the cool of
[1:32:05] the evening
[1:32:07] with his people remember the cool of the
[1:32:09] evening brother
[1:32:12] amen right to walk in the cool of the
[1:32:15] evening i know i'm i'm i'm kind of on a
[1:32:17] teaching
[1:32:18] thing but it's okay because i want you
[1:32:20] to see that you can't stop where you are
[1:32:23] you got to press you got to press you
[1:32:26] got to keep moving
[1:32:27] don't let so many things occupy your
[1:32:29] life you got to press
[1:32:32] i realize satan's going to cause you to
[1:32:34] do he'll put things
[1:32:35] in your way so easily if you don't shut
[1:32:39] him down
[1:32:40] he'll have you wasting hours a day
[1:32:45] that's what he is he knows what god is
[1:32:48] trying to do but
[1:32:49] he doesn't understand god always have a
[1:32:51] backup system
[1:32:53] hallelujah because when god can't help
[1:32:55] you get you to do it he knows how to
[1:32:57] make you do it
[1:33:00] is that right ask jonah if you don't
[1:33:02] believe me
[1:33:04] right so we realize by god's grace he
[1:33:07] didn't doing what what does this word
[1:33:08] come thoroughly to restore the kingdom
[1:33:10] to his righteously position
[1:33:11] that failed by the sin by the first adam
[1:33:14] back to where he walked in the cool of
[1:33:16] the evening
[1:33:16] with his people talk with them
[1:33:19] fellowship with
[1:33:20] them and now sin and death hath
[1:33:23] separated them from his presence
[1:33:26] and his entire expression do you read it
[1:33:28] do you read it
[1:33:30] before the foundation of the world to
[1:33:32] express
[1:33:33] all of his attributes of what he was
[1:33:37] that's what it was all about god
[1:33:40] creating and expressing all of his
[1:33:42] attributes
[1:33:43] and you and i must understand what it's
[1:33:44] all about because you're part of it
[1:33:48] you are part of the expression of god's
[1:33:50] attributes
[1:33:52] and and he's not going to stop he can't
[1:33:55] fail
[1:33:55] if the word of god is in you it has to
[1:33:58] be made
[1:33:59] manifest and it doesn't matter god will
[1:34:01] put conditions
[1:34:04] on you to bring forth his expression
[1:34:09] hallelujah now see that's why it's
[1:34:12] urgent because
[1:34:13] we don't have time to play we really
[1:34:16] don't
[1:34:17] you know here was israel amen in the
[1:34:19] wilderness with moses and he's up on the
[1:34:21] mountain getting the word of
[1:34:22] word from god right the tablet's from
[1:34:24] god and the children of israel are down
[1:34:26] there
[1:34:27] playing
[1:34:30] and everybody that basically played died
[1:34:34] was that right that's the scripture the
[1:34:37] ones that
[1:34:38] that that moses threw the tablets and
[1:34:40] and and opened up
[1:34:42] and the earth swallowed them up is that
[1:34:45] right
[1:34:46] but even the remain of that generation
[1:34:50] still
[1:34:50] died and god never forgave them
[1:34:54] you can't disrespect this word and act
[1:34:57] like it ain't there
[1:34:59] you hear it preach and then you walk
[1:35:02] over it anyhow
[1:35:03] you can't do that and expect god not to
[1:35:07] judge you
[1:35:09] is that right you think about it when it
[1:35:11] comes amen to uh
[1:35:13] uh uh it can't he he probably thought
[1:35:15] you know
[1:35:16] he had been cross over and everything
[1:35:19] was all right
[1:35:20] take a few wedges and of silver and gold
[1:35:22] and uh garment and all that
[1:35:24] and then god judges him and god just
[1:35:27] doesn't judge him he judges the whole
[1:35:29] church
[1:35:30] thousands of souls i believe it was
[1:35:32] killed at that time because one man
[1:35:35] decided he wanted to steal
[1:35:38] right think about what's happening
[1:35:40] people that's why i'm so glad it's an
[1:35:42] individual walk
[1:35:45] hallelujah i'm so glad because if we had
[1:35:48] to rest
[1:35:49] on this church and and then and the
[1:35:52] sanctification of it
[1:35:53] we'll be in trouble y'all getting quiet
[1:35:57] but it's the truth
[1:35:58] we would be in trouble if my
[1:36:01] sanctification rested on somebody else's
[1:36:04] hallelujah or my holiness rested on
[1:36:07] somebody else's whether they would do
[1:36:09] right or wrong
[1:36:10] i would be in trouble thank god for
[1:36:13] grace
[1:36:16] now we find out also in this this
[1:36:19] the sixth seal now being open it was
[1:36:22] four thresh
[1:36:23] threefold purpose now here was the
[1:36:26] purposes
[1:36:27] did you understand what he said and i it
[1:36:29] took me a while to even understand
[1:36:31] the sixth seal being open and what
[1:36:33] brother brown says that it's the sixth
[1:36:34] seventh seal
[1:36:35] open under the sixth right
[1:36:39] and you gotta understand all of those
[1:36:41] seals have been openly opening
[1:36:43] during the church ages even when the
[1:36:45] church aged messengers and those who
[1:36:47] followed him
[1:36:47] didn't even know what was going on
[1:36:51] they followed him and those seals were
[1:36:53] being opened
[1:36:54] and god it was a mystery and you know
[1:36:57] it's the truth
[1:36:58] how did the that little church
[1:37:02] survived during a thousand
[1:37:06] years of reign of darkness
[1:37:09] by the catholic church but understand
[1:37:12] god has
[1:37:13] never left himself without a witness
[1:37:15] hallelujah
[1:37:16] god has never left himself without a
[1:37:19] witness
[1:37:20] i don't care what everybody is doing
[1:37:22] around this message
[1:37:23] you better put this thing into your
[1:37:25] heart and
[1:37:26] live it with all you got don't look at
[1:37:30] your neighbor
[1:37:31] if they're doing what they let them do
[1:37:33] it
[1:37:35] i love this thing when brother adam said
[1:37:37] there are some people that god won't let
[1:37:38] them do certain things
[1:37:41] i'm one of them there's certain things
[1:37:45] that trouble me that i find out that
[1:37:46] doesn't trouble other people
[1:37:51] the first thing was the sleeping virgin
[1:37:54] had to go through the tribulation period
[1:37:56] for purification she had to be purged of
[1:37:58] her sins and of her unbelief
[1:38:00] and rejected the message this she was
[1:38:03] done in tribulation period
[1:38:05] we see they wind up over here in
[1:38:07] revelation 7 between the 6th and the 7th
[1:38:10] chapter here
[1:38:11] that she had been purged and she had
[1:38:13] been given her roles now
[1:38:15] she is not the bride but it's the church
[1:38:18] the pure people that that didn't have
[1:38:20] the opportunity
[1:38:22] maybe to receive the message or in some
[1:38:24] way that they were
[1:38:25] blinded by these false prophets and they
[1:38:28] didn't get a chance and yet
[1:38:30] they're really sincere in heart and god
[1:38:32] knows their heart
[1:38:34] and their they are purged during this
[1:38:36] time now understand me
[1:38:37] we would have never known this
[1:38:40] had not those seals been opened we would
[1:38:43] have never known
[1:38:44] this i tried when i was in denominations
[1:38:48] to read revelations and i quit because i
[1:38:50] couldn't understand a thing
[1:38:52] only but blessed is he that readeth
[1:38:56] so i think if i can read it i'll be
[1:38:57] blessed praise the lord
[1:39:00] you notice that another purging time
[1:39:02] that's for the israel when she gathers
[1:39:04] that's the second fold god purges israel
[1:39:07] in the tribulation period
[1:39:08] out of the millions that's gathered
[1:39:10] there there'll be a
[1:39:12] selection 144 000 and they will be
[1:39:15] purged also god
[1:39:16] is purging israel that's another fold
[1:39:19] notice there's a whole earth
[1:39:21] is to be purged right purging of the
[1:39:24] foolish virgin persian of israel
[1:39:27] now purging of the whole world that's
[1:39:30] three right
[1:39:32] okay he says now persian there will be
[1:39:34] such thing that the moon the stars and
[1:39:36] all nature will be purged
[1:39:37] do you see what it is the earth is
[1:39:39] renewing herself
[1:39:40] being purged getting ready for the
[1:39:43] millennium
[1:39:44] hello so you hear what he's saying
[1:39:48] this is your opportunity god is purging
[1:39:51] you
[1:39:52] through the preaching of the word that
[1:39:55] you might wash yourself
[1:39:57] that he might wash you by the water of
[1:39:59] the word this is your cleaning up time
[1:40:02] so that you can be filled you see
[1:40:04] because
[1:40:05] it must have no spot of blemishes
[1:40:10] and that could only come by the word
[1:40:12] manifested
[1:40:13] and let me hurry up because i know we're
[1:40:16] tired here
[1:40:17] listen now notice on the opening of the
[1:40:19] seventh seal it is also
[1:40:20] a threefold mystery this one was
[1:40:22] speaking have spoke
[1:40:24] that it is the mystery of the seven
[1:40:25] thunders the seven thunders in heaven
[1:40:27] will unfold this mystery
[1:40:29] it will be right at the coming of christ
[1:40:32] because christ said no one knew when he
[1:40:35] would
[1:40:36] return hello so when you're looking
[1:40:39] at the image that's in the cloud that is
[1:40:42] the coming of christ
[1:40:44] it ain't all over yet but you got to
[1:40:47] understand what he's doing and i'm going
[1:40:48] to read a quote that i found that's
[1:40:50] going to really be a blessing to you
[1:40:54] it'll be right at the coming of christ
[1:40:57] right it has to be christ brother
[1:41:00] branham turn that to the right
[1:41:02] it was christ right
[1:41:06] and so anyway he said because christ
[1:41:08] said no one would
[1:41:09] would know when he would return so
[1:41:11] therefore there was a returning
[1:41:13] because it was christ now that's what he
[1:41:15] said
[1:41:16] right did you notice when the jews ask
[1:41:18] him uh
[1:41:19] that he said no when we compare the
[1:41:21] scriptures here with matthew 24
[1:41:23] the sixth seal the seventh seal was left
[1:41:26] out because you see
[1:41:27] christ said only himself would know not
[1:41:29] even the angels know
[1:41:30] one it was even written it was wasn't
[1:41:33] written
[1:41:34] even written you see they they they
[1:41:37] hushed nothing take place then angels
[1:41:40] don't know it
[1:41:41] nobody knows when it's coming
[1:41:44] but there be see seven voices
[1:41:47] what i'm trying to get y'all to see some
[1:41:49] things that have already taken place
[1:41:51] and we're still looking for it
[1:41:54] it's in your face but i had not
[1:41:58] seen exactly well oh my god i hold my i
[1:42:01] don't want to i don't want to quote this
[1:42:02] thing until i get to here
[1:42:04] i mean this is what you call
[1:42:05] anticipation i'm excited
[1:42:07] but see there are seven voices of these
[1:42:09] thunders and that will reveal the great
[1:42:11] revelation at that time so i believe so
[1:42:14] if we don't know it it will it won't be
[1:42:17] known till that time but it will be
[1:42:19] revealed in that day
[1:42:20] in the hour that is supposed to be
[1:42:23] revealed in
[1:42:24] so the thing for us to do is to be
[1:42:27] reverent before god
[1:42:29] now he's basically saying it's ooh it's
[1:42:31] open
[1:42:32] but i i want you to know there's a time
[1:42:35] in this thing for me to unfold it to the
[1:42:37] people
[1:42:39] that's what it's been
[1:42:45] everybody even in the message have tried
[1:42:47] to you know tell you what it is
[1:42:49] i can't even tell you what it is but
[1:42:50] i'ma let give you some something
[1:42:53] but i want you to understand it's an
[1:42:55] individual revelation that god has given
[1:42:57] you
[1:42:58] and it sets you free when you see by
[1:43:01] god's grace
[1:43:02] what this thing has done for me or you
[1:43:05] know it sets you free
[1:43:08] it doesn't mean that you don't have any
[1:43:10] more thoughts or failures but it sets
[1:43:12] your soul
[1:43:13] free because it's been revealed to you
[1:43:17] you know this is a message you know that
[1:43:19] was christ
[1:43:21] hallelujah you know that was a coming
[1:43:23] hallelujah
[1:43:24] and you know that the word that was
[1:43:26] brought to you was a full word
[1:43:29] if brother branham in his ministry tied
[1:43:31] up the loose ends
[1:43:33] that means everything that was loose out
[1:43:35] there he brought it and he compiled
[1:43:36] compounded and it became those pieces
[1:43:39] became a whole
[1:43:40] am i making sense
[1:43:47] we find that the sixth seal has been
[1:43:49] open to us and we see it
[1:43:51] and we know that this seventh seal
[1:43:52] cannot be broken to the
[1:43:54] to the public until that hour arrived
[1:43:57] now there's come
[1:43:58] some reason that god let this seven
[1:44:01] voices be thundered because
[1:44:02] it must come see we find that christ the
[1:44:06] lamb took the book
[1:44:07] in his hand and he opened the seventh
[1:44:10] seal
[1:44:10] but you see it's a hidden mystery no
[1:44:13] no one knows it now brother batman
[1:44:16] he talked about the seven seals and
[1:44:18] understand he's talking in parables
[1:44:20] he's working with parables because the
[1:44:22] intellectual won't get this
[1:44:24] but he don't want to point to himself
[1:44:26] but he's trying to work it so
[1:44:28] you can have an idea it must be a
[1:44:30] revelation to you of who he is
[1:44:32] and not because he says i am the seventh
[1:44:34] angel messenger
[1:44:36] and he could have easily said it because
[1:44:38] jesus said to that woman
[1:44:39] at the well i am he we know when the
[1:44:42] messiah come
[1:44:43] he's going to tell us of all these
[1:44:45] things he says i am he
[1:44:47] so he could have easily said it right
[1:44:51] and in terms he did say it but you know
[1:44:52] if you don't have a spiritual ear you
[1:44:54] won't hear it
[1:44:55] now there was some reason that god let
[1:44:57] this seven voices be thundered because
[1:44:58] it must come
[1:44:59] we find that christ the lamb took the
[1:45:01] book in his hand and he opened the
[1:45:02] seventh seal
[1:45:04] is that right now watch this this is
[1:45:05] what i was trying to tell you the fall
[1:45:07] the fall of it
[1:45:09] when jesus christ when christ the lamb
[1:45:11] took the seal
[1:45:12] took the book it was silenced in heaven
[1:45:17] but that same book the angel gave
[1:45:22] to john and it was no long
[1:45:25] no silence
[1:45:28] you understand me and john falls down to
[1:45:32] worship the angel
[1:45:33] and the angel says no get up john
[1:45:35] worship god
[1:45:38] in other words in this message there is
[1:45:42] no worshipping of men
[1:45:47] no worshipping of men this is not about
[1:45:49] a man
[1:45:50] this is about god and god gives a book
[1:45:54] amen to john and tell john you must eat
[1:45:58] it
[1:46:00] eat it all up because you're going to
[1:46:02] prophesy again
[1:46:04] and brother adam said that john
[1:46:06] represented the pride
[1:46:08] hallelujah she becomes a prophet because
[1:46:11] he's a prophet
[1:46:15] is the truth he didn't give her another
[1:46:17] book
[1:46:18] he gave her the book and that book was
[1:46:21] redemption
[1:46:23] that book also uh uh in the book was
[1:46:27] inheritance everything that redemption
[1:46:30] brought was in the book
[1:46:32] and john 8 and so therefore everything
[1:46:34] that belonged
[1:46:35] everything in the book belonged to john
[1:46:38] that's why
[1:46:38] paul said we're joiners with christ
[1:46:41] y'all understand me
[1:46:42] join us with christ that's the foe that
[1:46:45] was left out
[1:46:47] nobody knew we understood always sinners
[1:46:49] saved by grace
[1:46:50] but we are we never denomination could
[1:46:54] never teach you this that god's whole
[1:46:57] purpose
[1:46:59] was to make you a god a part of him
[1:47:02] that he could live through your life
[1:47:05] numbers that no man can number but it's
[1:47:08] still god working out his old salvation
[1:47:11] with his children
[1:47:14] hello i'm jumping
[1:47:18] listen brother adam says in christ the
[1:47:20] mystery of god revealed he says
[1:47:22] it is the bride that's the original tree
[1:47:27] the original spirit the revelation come
[1:47:30] from christ
[1:47:31] not denomination christ let me read that
[1:47:34] again
[1:47:34] it's the bride that's the original tree
[1:47:38] you understand me so it identifies you
[1:47:43] if you can believe this message he said
[1:47:45] not just with your head but if you can
[1:47:47] receive it
[1:47:48] that identifies you as the original tree
[1:47:52] and he said when that original tree
[1:47:54] bring forth a branch
[1:47:56] it will do the exact thing that the
[1:47:59] first
[1:47:59] church did hallelujah come on
[1:48:03] you say oh they're coming a time and
[1:48:05] people don't want to believe it i
[1:48:06] believe in all my heart
[1:48:07] i don't know how short a period of time
[1:48:09] it will be but there's going to be a
[1:48:11] mount zion showdown
[1:48:13] and she's going to show who she is it
[1:48:16] won't be by
[1:48:17] preaching because some of us can't help
[1:48:20] preach those people out there
[1:48:21] but when it comes to action and
[1:48:23] demonstration when it comes to the very
[1:48:25] life of christ
[1:48:27] he's going to show up the world who you
[1:48:30] are
[1:48:31] and then we'll go up with him
[1:48:34] satan has a question and and here is his
[1:48:37] answer
[1:48:38] christ is risen
[1:48:41] and has paid the price for our
[1:48:43] redemption what god
[1:48:45] what god in christ manifested he gave
[1:48:48] that flesh
[1:48:49] that the blood that in that blood might
[1:48:52] come the life and that flesh he redeemed
[1:48:56] and that god in this redeemed flesh
[1:48:58] could
[1:48:59] manifest the word for the day as he did
[1:49:02] in that day
[1:49:03] glory what was brother branham trying to
[1:49:05] tell the people
[1:49:06] look at me i'm nothing
[1:49:10] but look at my actions look what i'm
[1:49:12] doing
[1:49:14] i'm doing nothing but look what's being
[1:49:16] done
[1:49:17] and he was trying to get the people to
[1:49:19] see that this is jesus christ
[1:49:22] working as the son of man in my life
[1:49:26] and he's doing such a thing i have no
[1:49:28] control i'm a prisoner of his
[1:49:30] i i'm doing what he wants me to do
[1:49:32] that's that's the same thing
[1:49:33] jesus declared i can do nothing except i
[1:49:36] see the father
[1:49:38] do it and that's what brother i'm trying
[1:49:40] to say i don't give myself vision
[1:49:42] i don't have no healing power but
[1:49:44] because of the vessel i am
[1:49:46] it's christ in me he said basically
[1:49:50] i'm trying to tell you there's a
[1:49:51] fullness of christ in me
[1:49:53] it didn't make brother branham the man
[1:49:55] it was christ the fullness of christ
[1:49:58] he did exactly what jesus did and then
[1:50:01] he comes around and tells
[1:50:02] i got a quote where that same fullness
[1:50:05] is going to be in the bride of jesus
[1:50:07] christ
[1:50:08] we will no longer continue to be
[1:50:10] fragmented
[1:50:11] we'll be one unit can you imagine
[1:50:15] amen being able to not only know how
[1:50:17] each other's assault but to
[1:50:19] connect so much to our whole goal would
[1:50:21] be the same
[1:50:22] one mind amazing
[1:50:27] then we stand justified
[1:50:33] he said then he said he said then we
[1:50:35] stand justified in the presence of god
[1:50:37] as a drop of ink dropping into a tub
[1:50:39] full of bleach
[1:50:41] you'll never find that stain of the ink
[1:50:43] no more
[1:50:44] it went somewhere it'll never come back
[1:50:46] and when man is truly redeemed
[1:50:48] that predestinated seed that sees it and
[1:50:52] accepts it
[1:50:52] he said his sins are demolished it's
[1:50:56] gone
[1:50:56] it's separated it drops into the ink of
[1:50:59] the blood of jesus christ
[1:51:00] and it's never to be remembered now how
[1:51:03] many all know that
[1:51:05] we say we know it and every day
[1:51:09] we allow the devil to dupe us to make us
[1:51:12] think we're not going to make it
[1:51:14] when the blood of jesus christ is
[1:51:15] vanquished
[1:51:17] your sins are gone demolished
[1:51:21] right and you say well oh brother brooks
[1:51:23] what are you saying all i'm trying to
[1:51:25] tell you
[1:51:25] i know you've heard it before perhaps
[1:51:27] you have all i'm trying to tell you is
[1:51:29] this
[1:51:30] if the god of heaven don't show you
[1:51:33] where you are now
[1:51:34] you'll never know where you got to go
[1:51:37] i'm telling you if you think that we've
[1:51:39] got all these years and maybe we do i
[1:51:42] don't know
[1:51:42] but by what i am seeing and i am seeing
[1:51:46] that the lord can get
[1:51:47] take the rapture and make it happen
[1:51:49] right now and still be scriptural
[1:51:52] and we're looking for events we're
[1:51:54] looking for events
[1:51:56] when the greatest event has already
[1:51:58] happened
[1:51:59] is that right he declared it brother bam
[1:52:02] said
[1:52:02] when he turned his back to the audience
[1:52:05] and began to call people names out what
[1:52:06] was he doing
[1:52:08] showing that this was not a man's doing
[1:52:11] this was jesus christ on the scene
[1:52:15] the same one that was there in abraham's
[1:52:18] day
[1:52:19] is still alive oh
[1:52:22] my god and everybody missed it
[1:52:26] because you know what they were looking
[1:52:27] at the man
[1:52:29] they weren't looking at the man in the
[1:52:31] time that he was coming he tried to tell
[1:52:32] him
[1:52:33] okay in other words i couldn't be here
[1:52:35] except it be the days of noah
[1:52:39] in the days of sodom that's when the son
[1:52:40] of man will be revealed that's the days
[1:52:42] we're living in
[1:52:43] and so that in itself this is why
[1:52:45] somebody said well
[1:52:46] malachi brother venom was not malachi
[1:52:49] for
[1:52:50] you know like say what you want to say
[1:52:54] i have a i have an understanding of this
[1:52:57] word
[1:52:57] god interprets his own word now tell me
[1:53:00] who brother branham was
[1:53:02] by the interpretation you understand me
[1:53:05] by looking at all that he did he got to
[1:53:08] be in the bible somewhere
[1:53:10] it has to be there and the bible said
[1:53:13] when that spirit of elijah come
[1:53:16] amen the fire is about to fall
[1:53:23] look what brother says he said we stand
[1:53:26] justified in christ before him because
[1:53:28] we cannot he cannot pass judgment
[1:53:32] for he's already judged that body in
[1:53:35] which i
[1:53:35] am a part of he judged jesus's body
[1:53:39] he became sin that we might become
[1:53:41] righteousness
[1:53:42] his righteousness we're not just oh
[1:53:45] lord if you could just see it the way i
[1:53:48] see it
[1:53:49] amen you might think i'm blaspheming if
[1:53:51] i say it the way i see it
[1:53:52] but all i'm kind of trying to tell you
[1:53:54] i'm trying to read to you what he just
[1:53:55] said
[1:53:57] he cannot pass judgment but he's already
[1:54:00] judged that body
[1:54:01] in which i am a part of what how am
[1:54:05] i part of it here it is it's in me
[1:54:08] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:54:11] then
[1:54:12] what you say or ask the father
[1:54:15] anything in my name it be done see
[1:54:18] because
[1:54:18] it's there justified glory to god oh if
[1:54:21] i could just get the world to see
[1:54:23] that why there you are there is the body
[1:54:26] of christ
[1:54:27] living standing redeemed redeemed oh my
[1:54:31] hallelujah justify in the sight
[1:54:34] this is i'm coming to where i want to go
[1:54:36] we are justified
[1:54:37] we are his victory the church is his
[1:54:40] victory
[1:54:41] we come forth in his last days with the
[1:54:44] glorious gospel
[1:54:45] showing his victory he died for the this
[1:54:48] purpose
[1:54:48] we are we are proof of his victory amen
[1:54:52] hallelujah we are proof of his victory
[1:54:55] amen
[1:54:56] we see him coming down living among the
[1:54:59] church
[1:55:00] that's his victory shows that he
[1:55:02] couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:55:04] neither can they keep us that's the
[1:55:06] truth we'll
[1:55:07] already potentially arise because we're
[1:55:10] raised from dead unbelief in the word in
[1:55:13] his word
[1:55:14] from denomination and creed to an
[1:55:16] eternal word of the young did y'all hear
[1:55:18] he's
[1:55:18] potentially we're already raised
[1:55:22] raised from unbelief in his word and
[1:55:25] from denominational crease and
[1:55:27] to eternal word of the eternal god which
[1:55:30] is him himself working through us
[1:55:33] manifesting himself that he in the same
[1:55:36] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:55:39] and then
[1:55:40] here i go this is it i hope it hit you
[1:55:42] the way it hit me
[1:55:44] i hope it ain't one of those revelations
[1:55:45] you at all but my point
[1:55:49] i hope it hits you like it hit me then
[1:55:52] the word moves listen because we're
[1:55:55] talking about the capstone we're talking
[1:55:56] about the head
[1:55:57] we're talking about christ we're talking
[1:55:59] about those seven seals that he brought
[1:56:00] we talk about amen the authority and
[1:56:02] everything that came with that right
[1:56:04] the authority that came with it was the
[1:56:06] authority that the that the mighty angel
[1:56:08] had
[1:56:08] he put his one land on the sea and one
[1:56:11] right and one
[1:56:12] on land one foot on the land and one on
[1:56:14] the sea that means he possessed
[1:56:16] everything he possessed everything
[1:56:19] that book was a representation of
[1:56:22] himself
[1:56:23] it was the word he is the word he will
[1:56:25] always be the word
[1:56:27] you know that in heaven you ain't going
[1:56:28] to go there and you're going to find a
[1:56:29] little book
[1:56:32] god ain't up there flipping pages
[1:56:35] it's symbolic is that right brother
[1:56:38] said the book of revelation is the book
[1:56:40] of symbols it's symbolic
[1:56:46] jesus i am the bread of life we ain't
[1:56:48] going to heaven to eat him
[1:56:51] it's the receiving of the word
[1:56:57] and then the word moves on down into the
[1:57:00] body
[1:57:02] from the head i'm going to say that
[1:57:04] again
[1:57:06] the word moves on down in the body
[1:57:10] from the head so the head had to come
[1:57:14] and you have to be connected to the head
[1:57:17] in order for
[1:57:18] the power of the head to move down
[1:57:20] through the body
[1:57:22] hallelujah what is it the same word
[1:57:26] nothing can be added or taken from it so
[1:57:29] that same word
[1:57:30] moves from the head listen as he says
[1:57:34] how he says as the day comes close
[1:57:38] down into the body down into the body
[1:57:41] vindicating that they are one
[1:57:44] so as we move closer to the coming
[1:57:48] to to the rapture you're going to find
[1:57:50] out that that same word
[1:57:53] that was in william branham will be
[1:57:55] ministering
[1:57:56] oh you say that ain't scripture it is
[1:57:59] you got elijah and you got elisha
[1:58:02] and the bride of jesus christ is elisha
[1:58:05] she didn't get a different mantle she
[1:58:07] got the same mantle
[1:58:08] the same word the same god reflecting
[1:58:12] is that right because you got to see
[1:58:14] they say oh
[1:58:16] they were called christians at antioch
[1:58:18] where the lord jesus christ had already
[1:58:19] been crucified buried
[1:58:21] risen but his same spirit
[1:58:24] come downs on the believer hallelujah
[1:58:27] they can say william branham is dead
[1:58:29] but what they understand that the same
[1:58:31] spirit
[1:58:32] the same holy ghost the same god that
[1:58:34] was with william branham
[1:58:36] comes down to the believer and she does
[1:58:38] the same watch
[1:58:40] the same things that was done then
[1:58:45] hallelujah is that right because the
[1:58:47] problem of god said we're going to have
[1:58:48] a showdown
[1:58:50] janice and jambridge they live too
[1:58:52] hallelujah
[1:58:54] but one thing about the bride she has
[1:58:56] the ability to create
[1:59:00] that's part of the third pool that's
[1:59:02] what he was trying to tell you
[1:59:04] you and i are coming back to where we
[1:59:06] were before the fall
[1:59:08] back into eden where we will subdue
[1:59:11] all everything see the bride ain't gonna
[1:59:14] go out here like a coward she's coming
[1:59:16] out of here victorious
[1:59:19] oh lift up the gates and be ever lifted
[1:59:22] up
[1:59:23] oh see we're getting ready to
[1:59:26] it's a move of god that's moving and a
[1:59:28] lot of people don't see it
[1:59:30] hallelujah ah there's a move in the bush
[1:59:36] the mulberry tree there's a move and
[1:59:39] what people don't see it they they just
[1:59:40] don't see it but let me tell you
[1:59:42] something don't be deceived
[1:59:44] don't be deceived because when god
[1:59:45] called lazarus from the grave nobody saw
[1:59:47] what was happening back there
[1:59:49] hallelujah a rotted man hardly knew that
[1:59:52] same voice
[1:59:54] he may pull every element together in a
[1:59:56] matter of minutes
[1:59:58] hallelujah you understand me it doesn't
[2:00:00] take god it don't take god long to do
[2:00:02] what he needs to do
[2:00:04] hallelujah yeah is that the truth you
[2:00:06] take that little storm that wind that
[2:00:08] came through here
[2:00:09] that was the worst storm i ever
[2:00:10] experienced in my life i lived in south
[2:00:12] carolina and experienced
[2:00:14] part a part of a hurricane it didn't
[2:00:16] tear up like it did here
[2:00:18] you understand me it didn't take long
[2:00:20] did it again
[2:00:21] huh right now we're still seeing the the
[2:00:25] the remains of his fierceness
[2:00:28] hallelujah and i ain't gonna kill you
[2:00:31] i was caught in a casey's and i wasn't
[2:00:34] going out
[2:00:38] i thought in just a moment time i'm
[2:00:39] gonna see a whirlwind
[2:00:42] it was bad ah the only good thing i got
[2:00:46] out of that was some free hot dogs
[2:00:50] and then when i got out there to go to
[2:00:51] my car the wind knocked them out of my
[2:00:53] hand
[2:00:57] i said well lord i wasn't supposed to
[2:00:58] eat those
[2:01:00] you see what i'm saying so you look at
[2:01:02] these things your brothers what are you
[2:01:04] saying look what's it
[2:01:05] so that the same word moves from the
[2:01:07] head
[2:01:08] that's why the seals and these thunders
[2:01:10] that that god
[2:01:12] go listen i'm gonna tell you what you
[2:01:13] need to do go listen
[2:01:15] to christ is the mystery of god
[2:01:18] revealed you'll find out something there
[2:01:22] you'll see something there that has been
[2:01:23] hidden
[2:01:24] brother branham is telling you something
[2:01:26] that other fold
[2:01:28] of of of the third foe of the thunders
[2:01:30] what it was there to do
[2:01:32] it it was come to now enter into you
[2:01:36] to bring you you understand me you
[2:01:38] become the thunders
[2:01:40] it comes to enter into you and give you
[2:01:44] the
[2:01:44] the revelation of what it is to be like
[2:01:47] god
[2:01:49] the very thing that lucifer wanted
[2:01:52] he wanted the chosen bread y'all
[2:01:55] understand me
[2:01:56] he wanted to be like god because you
[2:01:58] know i don't know how he saw it but he
[2:02:01] adam come and adam is just like god
[2:02:04] and he killed that that scene but he
[2:02:06] didn't know that god was working right
[2:02:08] all the time in his midst everybody that
[2:02:11] died that was the seed of god
[2:02:13] god packed him to paradise hallelujah
[2:02:16] and then when he raised from the dead
[2:02:18] god took him out of paradise
[2:02:20] and put him under the heaven hallelujah
[2:02:22] and guess what
[2:02:23] he's getting ready to do it again
[2:02:26] hallelujah
[2:02:26] that same god hallelujah spoke
[2:02:31] is that right remember if you check out
[2:02:33] the quotes brother brahm said when
[2:02:35] when when jesus raised from the dead he
[2:02:37] said it was that mighty angel that came
[2:02:39] down like a fire
[2:02:40] and stood before the before the two
[2:02:43] the same mighty angel but yet the mighty
[2:02:47] angel was laying there
[2:02:49] you see what i'm saying what people
[2:02:51] don't understand when god
[2:02:53] came down when the mighty angel came
[2:02:55] down
[2:02:56] amen and that big stone rolled away
[2:03:00] hallelujah jesus was gone
[2:03:07] what and as that new testament started
[2:03:11] the end of the new new testament ended
[2:03:14] is that right
[2:03:15] because jesus told his disciples when he
[2:03:17] began to sin
[2:03:19] he said in like manner i will come again
[2:03:25] lord have mercy in life he didn't say
[2:03:28] just like it he said in like
[2:03:30] man it's going to be something similar
[2:03:32] the way i went up is the way i come down
[2:03:36] and he did it come down as the judge
[2:03:41] hallelujah oh my god amen
[2:03:44] and as that day get closer come down
[2:03:46] into the body
[2:03:47] down into the body vindicating that they
[2:03:50] are
[2:03:50] one they are husband and wife their
[2:03:53] flesh of his flesh
[2:03:55] word of his word life of his life spirit
[2:03:57] of his spirit see
[2:03:58] amen how do you know it bears the same
[2:04:01] record same fruit
[2:04:03] same word manifestation of christ same
[2:04:05] life same god
[2:04:06] same spirit same word same book amen
[2:04:09] same
[2:04:10] signs things that i do shall you
[2:04:13] also oh hallelujah what's he saying
[2:04:16] despite this thing it ain't all over yet
[2:04:21] the bride has a little day it ain't all
[2:04:23] over yet
[2:04:24] people say the bride is in revival but
[2:04:28] my goodness
[2:04:32] i'll be glad when when when maybe she is
[2:04:35] because i know i am
[2:04:38] and brother branham described revival he
[2:04:40] said getting the trash out of your life
[2:04:43] hmm this is the last i got more but this
[2:04:46] is the end
[2:04:48] he said no this vindicated word in his
[2:04:49] body in his very
[2:04:51] is his victory and the reason
[2:04:54] of his death see the death not in the
[2:04:57] spirit when he died
[2:04:59] he only died in the flesh his spirit
[2:05:01] went to hell
[2:05:02] and preached to the souls in prison that
[2:05:03] right his flesh
[2:05:05] only died then he raised it up again and
[2:05:08] quickened it
[2:05:09] quicken means made alive his flesh
[2:05:12] which was his body and that's the word
[2:05:15] has been laying dead for years but it's
[2:05:18] gradually beginning
[2:05:20] to come into the formation for she is
[2:05:23] standing upon her feet
[2:05:27] remember brother branham ties the same
[2:05:30] thought
[2:05:31] into ezekiel dry bones
[2:05:34] and dry bones when they came together
[2:05:36] got the sunu and all
[2:05:38] then she was standing her feet and the
[2:05:40] next thing was left was the wind
[2:05:44] and she says she's standing on her feet
[2:05:48] the next move is god is that all right
[2:05:54] okay let's stand i'll just stop there
[2:06:00] one more quote in closing he said i love
[2:06:02] you
[2:06:03] don't forget the commandments of god to
[2:06:05] you little children
[2:06:07] love one another love everybody right or
[2:06:10] wrong
[2:06:11] sinner or saint love them anyhow if you
[2:06:14] don't
[2:06:15] then pray god to help you because god
[2:06:17] loved the sinner
[2:06:18] and the nature of god is in you if the
[2:06:21] man is wrong love him
[2:06:22] anyhow don't partake of his cnc
[2:06:25] don't partake of his sins but in
[2:06:28] sweetness
[2:06:29] not in sourness and rebuke and sweetness
