surely god is good to us give that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you oh if your body back from the dead well did you well Oh [Music] right [Music] Oh well Oh that's hey man you love the Lord but get right into the word God is good to us oh praise the Lord we're gonna come from Jude right where we left off we'll kind of pick up don't you but we're just going to read the first and second verses of Jude Jude the first chapter [Music] first and second verse I'll wait to everybody find it jus the servants of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called unlike that preserved in Jesus Christ and called mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied now you can't get it no good in the net because when you are preserved it means to keep you alive or to keep in existence to make something lasting forever let's put it this way eternally so we thank God for its grace let us pray do you have any father God we come before you we thank you for your amazing grace Lord you have been so good to us we thank you for being good to us we pray father that your perfect will be done forgive us for any sins or shortcomings that we may have done thought may be in our actions cleanse us from all your honor all unrighteousness and God be glory to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated on this morning I started with the message preparing for a new world and I showed how that it was God amen in His grace and His mercy making this thing happen with us there's nothing that we could have done but is by the grace of God and the more we enter into this message more we enter into God's Word we can see that this preparation is a something that God has prepared he said I go and I prepare place for you the one thing I love about it is because it becomes more clearer to me when I see that I'm a part of God's replenishing there'll be a many people a man that won't be there because they were not in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and they are not in God's replenishing because remember the first Adam as we spoke this morning did not accomplish what God wanted him to accomplish even though the world had been had was replenished or they multiplied and they grew but we found out that those that were drowned amen indoors they were not seeds of God somehow they had been hybrid and it couldn't bring forth the original and so therefore remember now because the Bible said they married giving it married they were being multiplied and everything else so the true seed of God was not there the only thing that was left was amen the seed of Noah the Bible said he was perfect in his generation meaning that he was perfect in his gene he was the only one that had not mixed with the serpent seed now of course we realized that his sons had done so and that's how we understand how the serpent got on the other side of the flood but nevertheless you and I must understand that every kingdom everything must give way remember Amen when Noah preached that it was going to flood God destroyed every kingdom he took down everything in that day and of course we know amen Satan rebuilt his kingdom and he started with Nimrod right after the flood and he started with the resistance on a rebellion amen trying to do outdo God or to prevent God's Word from coming to pass you and I realized there's no way that we can stop the Word of God the Bible said as he has spoken it will come to pass and nothing can stop it is that right and we are now living in the kingdom understand we're living in this hour where everything is ending up where's that right when the seven seals will open and no stunt is uttered Amen there was a voice that came out of heaven that said time shall be no more showing that the ending of everything that had a beginning was at hand and so we see everything the animal kingdom and Kingdom you know you name it it's coming to an end the last one of the last kingdoms that will come to to the end is Satan and his kingdom the Bible said that old devil be thrown in the fire in the fire is that right all of his demons all of his piss apologies will be finally destroyed and then we will be part of the new heaven and the new earth hallelujah the thing that I love about it is that it started with Eve amen and it ends up with the bride she is that final focus is that right amen danger said unto John behold the bride the Lambs wife hallelujah and the Bible says she descended out of Evan come on somebody with the glory of God see she lost the glory of God in the Garden of Eden but in this new Eden in his new world she has gained the glory of God back with her and that's what we're moving into the glory of God is that right see that's why William Branham had to come that seventh angel he did not come to display himself he came to exercise or to manifest the glory of God everything he did was to glorify God and the bride of Jesus Christ is that right she come to glorify God this is why God got rid of or Daqi in in in Esther got rid of a vasty because she wanted to glorify herself instead of the king and when the King called her he wanted to show her beauty so that he could be glorified right not that she would be glorified so we're here by God's grace amen Annoying bait by God's grace that the only way that we can make this journey is that we must be born again and come into that statue of Christ in which God has given to us now we realize that our salvation is common it's simple it's not something complexed is that right let me take you back to Genesis remember the growth of Genesis started by seed that's as complex as it was a seed Dermott izing and coming to its fruition coming to a place of manifestation and it was all in the seed it was God who Dermott eyes the seed the light itself and you and I must understand if the seed is in you it will bring forth Christ it has no other way it can do nothing else but to bring forth Christ this is what I try to tell people I say you can play you can plant seeds you can plant a plum tree from the same different seeds okay same seed same plum red plum red plum red plum but each time that prom tree bring forth each plum tree will bring forth a different amount of fruit is that right one tree might bear it shelter to the to the to the tree is leaning with fruits the other one may just bear through whew amen and you know just able to keep his PO sure but then there there might be one that you know might not be bringing forth much fruit at all so you have to prune it to bring forth some but it's from the same seed understand these trees cannot compare themselves because they have the same blood they have the same origin they are from the same tree you understand me so that's how Christians are we're from the same tree even though some of us bring forth a variation of fruit we still are bringing forth our whatever God has ordained for us to bring forth is what we are bringing forth so I wanted to say because now we're preserved in Jesus so we understand the only way to be preserved is to be in him to be in Christ Christ in us right the hope of glory Christ in you because once you are in Christ he is in you right amen and you see you said what brother what are you trying to say let me let me say like this am i saying this is amazing brother Evan says amen in the message provided place of worship he said it must be God's choosing it can't be ours I thought you chose God no God chose you we have no choice coming he's already chose it somehow help me now hey God chose you he did not make a mistake he chose you you didn't choose him he chose you now what God chooses is right hey somebody what God chooses is right I can choose wrong you can choose Roe but God cannot God choose right after all it's he's the one that's being worshipped and he's got the place where he wants his worshipers to meet there and he must meet him there that's the only place that he stays only place that hear hear you from let us notice here the place I've chosen to worship me in I'll put my name in that place Oh let us research the scriptures for that place that he was has his name in now we have shadows and types all through the Bible we know that of different places where he met is the people but that's not the place that he meets here them today because they were only foreshadowing something coming up to the real place where he is to meet the people the place the church that peace is to meet in and there is a place there is a church that God promised to meet the people in this place and answer their prayer if they would just come to this place and worship Him now think about it he says now we find out that there is many claims that they have the place God's name is in their place he said but you see they put God's name in there there's a lot of difference between God putting his name there and somebody putting their name there his name there see we must remember that God said he would put see I have put my name I will put my name in this place and that's the place that I choose I have chosen the people should work that people should worship in other words I've chosen the place that they should worship and I have chosen the people who will worship you understand me so even though your worship see that's what I'm saying when God chooses a worshiper he chooses the right worshiper you understand what I'm saying God don't have to beg a real worshiper that he have chosen the worship because they must manifest the word and they must worship it's part of the choosing it's part of the choosing you and I what hey listen that that will be done in earth as it is in heaven is that right God always had worshipers in heaven he had agency that Seraphim cherubim Zandi you name it but he wanted worshipers in his own image do you think God could choose a worshiper who would not who will not an refuses to worship that's not going to the to the store and buying a toy that can that can shoot boring arrows and you get home in the toy won't work what do you do you take the toy back but see God doesn't make mistakes like that when God chooses the worshiper it is a perfect worship huh you understand me and the greatest worship you can ever give God is for God to live in you that is the highest form of worship is that right or is the truth if you're gonna worship Michael Jackson it's not just just singing his songs but it's to make up yourself like Michael you want to be in the image of Michael now that's just a scenario don't do that but my point is if you wanna worship God you want to be formed into the image of God so you can romp by him talk like him act like him praise like him everything you want to do just like him mm-hmm well Adam said the first child ever come was born in sin so it had to be that line a man that's born of a woman of his of a few days and what full of trouble he's born in sin that's the reason he has to be reborn again yeah if you know if anybody has any understanding you and I know we must be reborn we must have a new birth because there is no way we can make heaven like this right the reason that he has to be reborn again see by the spirit not by a spiritual thought by a spiritual birth see that regeneration reveal excuse me that regenerates him makes him a new creature the first man was born was born in sin then there had to be one come without sex now if sex wasn't the first thing then why did they have to have one in one in sex to redeem the whole human race why didn't he just bring one down the corridor and says here's the just one that that thinks right it had to come through the sex come through women because that's where it come in the first place through sex is that right that in other words that's why God had to bypass right the sexual act but he had to come by way of the woman right we need bypassed the sexual act because that's where the sin came in so he bypassed that so that the one that was to come could be a would be able to redeem all that was born in sex right you said all brother books I don't know well look at the world everything you go everything no matter no matter where you go everything that's advertised his sin it is centered around sex here's the just one that thinks right see right so through sex but brought robbing righteousness and through sex brought righteousness see God without an adulterer a duration without sexual desire brought forth Jesus Christ by Immaculate Conception by overshadowing Mary and creating in her this baby that come that come by sex the other would understand what he's saying every child from that point came by way of sex except this one and through that his holy blood redeemed the whole fallen racy so it has to be no other way for it in other words Amen Jesus Christ was not a c-section he had to come by way of sex you understand me every man that born of the woman is death bound he's dead when he's born hey it's the truth you know you you you know and I know it meant everything is you go older you realize that death has a hold on you and no matter what you want to do how much you exercise all of that is good but you still getting older you're gonna move slower right you don't even know you're moving slowing do you get grandchildren hallelujah and they just move and you think you can't how to keep up with them kicker whoo yeah but you and I must understand as far as I'm concerned i'ma try not to be here long you and I understand that we are living in the day of the prophecy or the prophecy of Enoch see we moved from Noah's day in that sense Enoch yet is to come and is now right the destruction of the earth not enough a man couldn't toll about Noah's day but he did he came to this day a day when the world was going to finally in right this is what we called the third Exodus right so the first Exodus was by blood by Noah excuse me by water right the second Exodus we know came by what a meant coming out of Egypt it was blood which it was a type of Jesus Christ right when he dropped the blood right now it comes out to the last exit which is the third Exodus and we exit by way of the rapture no hiding place no one could escape by going up over this word a man they escaped out of Egypt by going out and we escape out of this Egypt by going up but we must leave this place because the destroying angel is coming it's already in process remember an eleventh hour remember eight World War one amen the angel stopped did this struction of the world because though that there were Jews the servants had not been sealed by God and the bride of Jesus Christ had not yet been fully made manifest hallelujah and God cannot bring judgment on this earth fully until all whose names are written in the lamp of the life a man had been sealed away and Enoch according to Jews let me read that the Bible said Enoch also the seventh from Adam and this is the seventh church age he may prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints to do what to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all of their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against you and I have lived we are now living in an age where Hollywood radio TV churches you name it make mockery of Jesus Christ this is the day they mock God worse than ever they think it's funny they think he doesn't exist they think Amen that this is just some makeup yes they make they mock God in everything no matter what it is they this this is why harsh speeches and and and a profanity against God come on Jelani they prevailed as were they mama they complained listen they Walker that after their own lusts and all of these people still claim to go to church and many of them still say Oh God this is the day and Enoch type the rapture right and you and I know Amen that the Word of God says that our listeners as I read this morning let us be careful and is was it preserved because this is in Jude but juice starts off off with those who are preserved in Christ Jesus and called and then he comes down and he start breaking up said now don't be don't forget be remember now that God when he saved the children out of Egypt he also destroyed them that believed not see but they were preserved only the preserved was kept Joshua and Caleb was kept moses was kept you understand me listen and he goes on and says now remember those angels that that lost their first estate but left their own habitation he have reserved in everlasting chains and darkness unto the judgment of the great day and remember I told you this this morning I said Amen that this this not doesn't just start in in in Eden this start before the foundation in the world because these demons that revolted are the angels that revolted against God and now what we call demons and these demons are now inspiring men and women to do what they did in that other dimension right because the battle first started in heaven it came down to earth we lost the battle in he in Eden hallelujah we failed we broke the word and now the greatest battle ever fought is not an Eden is in your mind it moved from heaven down into Eden from even into your mind because what Satan found a way into the human race hallelujah he cannot destroy the true seed of God because the gene seed is in the soul but he surely can torment you in your mind but don't worry that seed amen the name of the seed has already been placed in the Lamb's Book of Life mmm God preparing us for a new world I'm so excited whoo no wonder Paul said if this Tabernacle be dissolved I have a building I've got one waiting on me I've got a trophy I got a trophy waiting on me from God that's what he says amen if this dissolve I got one up this is not my ending this is only my beginning brother rich it's only our beginning man think about it we got to go through this to go over there hallelujah so let it be hallelujah whenever gotta cut my way to get me over there let it calm whoo I'm a soldier now I'm like Abraham land I'm looking for that city whose builder and maker is God whoo by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for all have sinned is that right and any kept kept them in bondage by law hallelujah you can't do this if you do this that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong you break one word you're guilty of the law therefore you going to hell hallelujah but even in the midst of all that law God had grace is that right because Paul said we're sin did abound grace abounded more hallelujah and when the law was going on yes they tried to make it they tried to do it and when Paul recognized the grace of God he says listen out of all of that I was the worst of all sinners I was a chief of all sinners I did everything right yeah but he thought his righteousness could save him and God revealed to him your righteousness is as filthy rags you can't work it the sea works it it is God in you that's what about calling him the hope of glory hallelujah it is God in you that works this thing to his glory hallelujah if the devil only understood who he's doing he did us a favor when they crucified Christ hallelujah that was the best thing that could have happened when they buried him you talk about a man of war he knows how to fight right under the devil's nose and he's got the devil Amen working to his advantage hallelujah he preached a message he said now what Buster scorned after the body deposit loan but this coin got to go down it's got a dies gallery in order to come up and that devil heard it could not understand it hallelujah if he had understood that message he never would have touched Jesus hallelujah but here come God here come the devil with his imps and his demons amen and they did everything they can do to him but oh my when he gave up the ghost and said it was finished hallelujah oh you know what he was doing he was preparing us he was opening up the Gateway hallelujah to that new dimension hallelujah that new world the world with which we come from did you know that did you know that your theophany was there waiting has been waiting for some time is that right because brother Branham said when God created Adam he created us all all of us oh praise God so when God created Jesus Christ himself even all of us was there that spiritual being that was a quickening spirit amen we were in him is that right for the Lord is that spirit is that right the Lord is that spirit we are part of him that brother I'm said we're rotational for him so you got to understand having the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost is not your problem it's God's problem and God has no problems that means if God has ordained you together you gonna get it and the gates of Hell should not prevail because you know what you and I know where the place of worship is was that right jesus said if you call on my name you asked me for bread he said know I will never give you a serpent I never understood that brother when you asked for life God is not going to make you a devil if you ask for life God will give you life whoo glory to God is that Alright see one thing I love about it because God through what this whole book was trying to show us listen you can't do it I want you to understand I am the real Romeo I'm the one I'm the real true lover hallelujah I'm the one that searches for you you don't search for me I came looking for you because I've known you before the foundation of the world and understand that this city that we're building has always been my plan hallelujah this whole new world that's coming has always been my plan y'all understand me God works in three he had to have three he had to have a rise in the fall or rise in the fall all right you know him said he had to work in threes because three is perfection this is the third Exodus and this is a final one hallelujah and every name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life amen when God called us from the grave you hear what I'm saying see this is what Adam was supposed to do that's why brother mom said those children were supposed to be excuse me spoken word children and when I when God amen is that right because remember God God told us something that we didn't know he said Adam was all he was there before he was formed he was already made in the image of God which was spirit and Adam led those animals before he even was formed in the dust he led those animals like the Holy Ghost would lead us that's what he said it hallelujah and then God formed him out of the dust of the earth so that he could feel and be touched by the feelings by the infirmities or whatever he wanted to communicate with his creation fellowship with him he wanted to be able to touch the deer and touch the antelope and whatever more he want to become visible to his creation so that they could see him is that right the same thing God did he was spirit he is spirit but he wanted to be seen he wanted to be touched hallelujah he wanted us to know him and to understand him and this what's of what was of what was what the fall was all about hallelujah but the world to come was always in the mind of God it's not so I better create a new world no the original thing planned was always out there and redemption of that had to be made that's why I said this morning there will not be any babies no toddlers over there because Adam was formed out of the dust of the ground and he was not a toddler he was a man that was a pattern of God that when one would come from the dust it would be a man or woman somebody help me here this is why the second Adam became a quickening spirit he could not just have babies by sex but he's got to come back and call us like Adam would have called us from the dust of the earth we are now in existence we are not the orphanage commotion body we stand in that dimension right now well how do you know cuz brother owns a when he went behind the curtain of time we were there but we were in our theophanies hallelujah but one of these old days God will call us by name hallelujah and what is the name the name is the Lord Jesus Christ it is the only redemption name and the Bible said neither is there salvation in any other but there is no other name given them a man why we must be saying and I was when he call him callers like avarice Lazarus right he's not gonna call all these names it would take forever you're welcome with Jesus you're working with the Archangel he will call one name and the whole body of people who come from the dust of the earth because they died in his name they will rise in his name hallelujah he won't have to say this time lucemon let him go no sir why because this model will put on immortality well that the Alpha me will put on a glorified body hallelujah it will drop this old nasty thing we're now causing calling our house you see it's a beautiful plan and those of us who are making preparations that old colored man say I don't want no trouble at the river if I got any problem let me settle him now because when it comes for me to cross over I don't want no trouble at the river whew am I the only one feeling good Oh [Laughter] Lord it's a beautiful thing that that's why the scripture says he makes all things beautiful in his time hallelujah see what it is it's a finished product and brothers and sisters we must begin to think like this because the devil will hide the fact that you got the Holy Ghost by way of your doubt as long as he can keep you doubting that you have it you won't be able to use it you become fearful you don't I mean a year he stunt your growth hittin your he stunts amen the glory of God that would normally come out of you because what he does he looks and makes you look at your flesh and you forget your flesh is already condemned that old boy could never do nothing good hallelujah he real enemy hallelujah yes it is the holy is the spirit and the flesh that war gives each other amen and you can never put this amen convert it that's why God got to change it he can convert the heart he can give you a new spirit but the flesh cannot be converted it must die and rot somebody help me here see in order to put on Christ you got a dying rot hallelujah to your flesh and God will give you the grace to do it the seed in you is the conqueror the Christ in you is the Conqueror when he said you might he's a mighty Conqueror he's a mighty Conqueror why because he conquered death hell and the grave hallelujah and when he did that he conquered the effects of death held in the grave that's why we'll be changed because he not only conquered death hell and the grave but he conquered the effects of death hell and the grave hey somebody help me here see so you and I must understand is a finished product he lived he died he rose again a sitting into heaven has come back in the form that the Holy Ghost so it is a finished work with God Christ knowing no sin became my sin wait a minute hallelujah he became my sin and what is sin not cheating in lying and stealing sin is unbelief he became my unbelief that I might have faith is that right that's why the Bible said when we are weak he is strong he's home it's not your faith anymore he's relying upon is his faith he is relying upon know he became sin that I might stand in his place he took my place I was in him at Calvary when he died there I must die with him to live because the law and death is in the body you have to die to be reconciled to him whoo talking about a recreation I am so excited I'm excited now because now I see all the trials and tests I go through it's a part of God we creating me it's killing and killing the old stuff and bringing forth the new is that right brother Adam said the new the new being a new creation creature they're the Greek words saying new creation it's a new creation you have been recreated again from what you were to the image of the Son of God and a daughter of God it's just such an all it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a sinner can be made to become a Christian the greatest miracle in ain't opening up the blind eyes it's not delivering somebody from drugs is with a man and a woman becomes a Christian he said that is the greatest of all miracles hmm and what we find ourselves doing is grieving the Holy Ghost you think you don't have him because the devil say he ain't there and God says he is there and then you do things and all you do is grieving him because you're not believing that he's in you he can't leave you once he's in there the Bible said he said I'll not leave you never will I forsake you that's the word he can't once God has decided to come in he's there to stay he can't make a mistake oh I better get up out of here oh no once he comes into your heart he has bind bound himself bind himself to stay mmm is a dare you try to break that seal you can't come on somebody grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption argue with him not me that's what he says I'm reading it reading it alright you sealed unto the day of your redemption until the day that Jesus comes for you think of it you are then not yourself you are a new creature a Greek the Greek word means a new creation you've been recreated again listen what I'm gonna say here look what is being said here now he said the power of God comes upon you and you become created a new creature the power of God comes upon you which brings the whole physical being spiritual being and everything in subject to the Word of God not another way there's no other way so what are you trying to say sometimes it takes a while for God to bring a person to a maturity sometimes some people are faster than others that's just in the natural and it's that way in the spiritual some people right you said what do you mean well Thomas says I ain't believing it but he's seen all the other miracles the other ones did see right he saw them but when they told him in the resurrection time believing that man I'm more intelligent than that you know what I'm saying the only way I'm gonna believe this I gotta feel it I gotta put my hand and so God has to deal with people like that God gonna he won't lose one but whatever it takes to convince the person or the people and bring their faith level up to the place where God wants it to be God will do it right oh and yes what God said in Thomas you blessed he doesn't hold cursing Thomas you didn't even believe it no he blessed it Thomas you blessed now now that you see you can call me my lord my god but he said blessed is the man who have not seen yet believe see but you said what brother one better than the other all I can tell you they both blessed he's the way you want to look at it they both blessed one that see the supernatural is blessed and the one that doesn't see the supernatural whatever it takes to bring him bring him to the Blessed state so be it well them say God promised it and God is obligated to take care of it he puts everything back on God and I think you need to do the same thing put everything back on God right you and I must understand that I'm almost done with this but you must understand that what God is doing he's transplanting us right God could have killed everything in Noah's day including Noah and he could have started up with a new makeup from the dust of the earth but God took Nora from the old world and plant transplanted him into the new right amen because Nora was a royal seed right so what God is doing now amen and everybody that died from Noah all the way up that was believe us God preserved them you said well oprah's what do you say let me tell you something job is the oldest of all the books and Joel had a revelation of the lamb you understand me so they didn't have novels and everything else it was word of mouth they passed us this message this message on the blood of the lamb is what God is pleased with and here was Joel a faithful servant of the Lord recognizing he was a sinner and he needed a blood atonement hallelujah not just for himself but for his whole family and like I said this morning he's paid on that as cheap hallelujah constantly presenting to God those sacrifices burnt sacrifice Lord forgive me love if I've seen in any way forgive me life he kept praying not for just himself but for his children and because of the Ashi because of his prayer his children were saved he loves somebody even when they were out there partying is there anything too hard for God hallelujah I'm almost done in just a minute so what God does like I said this morning a man he transplant us he preserves us now he's got us in a place called under the altar we're in that 60 minute when we leave here we go and we right under the altar right under the weather seventh years but God has us preserved there and I want you to understand it's beautiful over there it's not a prison house it's a paradise hallelujah it's a beautiful place it's almost like the Queen's throne hallelujah the Queen's Chamber hallelujah is there waiting for those who die before the coming of the Lord hallelujah but when God get ready and he's calling the Bible said when that trumpet sound and when God called for those that is that right because you got to realize by God's grace Amen when Jesus comes as he called Lazarus he will call us hmm yes cuz you said where I don't know about listen the Bible said Lazarus was dead for days he's thinking right the Word of God fell in the ground and was in that ground for four days before God called Luther stinking stinking and luthor was one that brokers kind of free life struck us amen it was a just shall live by faith hallelujah y'all know how it goes and now this is the age where we come forth out of the grave and we stand there in grave clothes and gossiped loose him and let him go hallelujah but who said loose him it was Mary Martha it was the voice of the Archangel come on somebody and that's how it is it was the voice of the that said lose him come out of those organization come out of those denomination you are set free God is calling you to the marriage supper of the Lamb is that right cuz you'll find out the next thing that that the scene of Elijah was that he was sitting at the supper table with Jesus you and I must understand this thing is perfect it's perfect and right now God is now preparing of people that's why I didn't listen let me find that quote brother Branham said like this he said the bride is the only one that can see it the denomination's came in company and what's happening now is that all right they can't see it people he said God's great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it though none of the rest of them understanding but just those who are predestinated to understand it how God in Christ are one hallelujah they'll make him three every time yeah they certainly will but the bride of Jesus Christ knows that God in Christ is one a man the god of Jehovah the Old Testament is in Jesus Christ of the new hallelujah why she's married to him mmm hallelujah they can't even comprehend it hallelujah I'm a closed on this quote because what we are becoming we are becoming the perfection of the Son of man you understand what that is the perfection of beasts on a man not the one a the perfection of the son of man who is Jesus Christ I'm gonna read you the quote in just a minute I want you to understand amen we are becoming the perfection of the Son of Man this is why everything that is of darkness has to go and you and I it'll happen it is simple you ask not you have not you ask he'll give it mmm he will do it if you really are sincere God would do it but guess what in his time he makes all things beautiful oh no he huh see that's what people say what Saul said well your Saul says Samuel is not back in you know they said we'll make a sacrifice at me yet what was also well yeah let me do it see no Sam you said he'll be back you better wait Oh Samuel it's all messed up because he didn't understand it would have been far more beautiful he would remain King if he had only stayed obedient to the voice of the prophet in closing but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form three of them two angels and God himself you understand me so when brother Brandon was on scene and God moved that was God himself he wasn't all robbers he wasn't a Billy Graham three came down and God Himself came right right amen that was God the Bible said it was now he came down and he manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where Sarah was and told Abraham and Sarah what was what was thinking in the tent now you tell me God didn't have to do it but that prophet stood on that stage and he turned his back and he started calling people out by name where they were sitting and everything else that was not a man that was God he was trying to show us that a son of man but he showed that the son of man was on the scene and at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the Ministry of Jesus Christ himself the church here it is we'll come through justification through luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of Holy Ghost in the Pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the Son of man that when husband and wife hello will be the same self person God will be so manifested in his bride his church - they will both be the same they are one he said now you see where we had she'd this is what the message came for them and you see the son of man was not only just a prophet but he also had the ability of discernment every Christian that's really born of the message born of the word amen has deserved they got Christ how can you not have it in you this is not a one-man ministry anymore this is a body ministry and everything that was in Christ is that right he poured it into up the church he didn't say something he said everything this is what makes us a super Church this is what makes us a super race hallelujah because we're packing the blood of Jesus is that right the prophet of God said the bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit somebody help me here and we are coming into that perfection and whether you believe it or not the revival is on people looking for is on now we don't have much time and listen the Prophet God said it'll be so simple it'll pass right through you and you won't even know it it's happening now the real bride of Jesus Christ is thirsting for more righteousness and he said if you thirst and hunger for righteousness you shall be filled everybody else is partying everybody else is out doing whatever they're gonna do but the bride of Jesus Christ when the Bible said come together the more when you see that Day approaching she's coming to the dinner table oh you know yeah she's coming to wine and dine with her master hey man but everybody else is out there doing what they gotta do don't worry doin numbers in this age but you keep pressing will make it because he's outdated to be so it is in this age God would be glorified like never before hallelujah is that right he said I at one time you would call forsaken but no longer will you be called forsaken haha you will be called Beulah hallelujah oh man oh man that stand by the grace of God hallelujah he's preparing and he using us Oh Samson oh girl you know we think about all those great pic why don't you you know who you are you're the bride of Jesus Christ you're the vision that he's seen from the beginning the eve fell back there but this Jesus Miss Jesus will not fall she is the she is the woman that the first Eve could never be because this one is fortified by the word somebody help me she's a quickening spirit hallelujah she's born of his bone and flesh but she's just like him a minute right now she's maturing maturing when we were young and little and midden didn't look like it but now the closer we get to the coming of Christ is the more we're beginning to look more like him we began to think like him we want to be like him we want to walk like we want to talk like him everything that we desire we want to be just like him that's the sign of a true bride and you keep designed that God will fill your thirst because that's what he said he will do you love the Lord oh what a mighty God we serve woo how I love Jesus that's saying that song Oh
