[16:02] you for everything you read us law from
[16:05] the beginning Lord until the end Jesus
[16:08] Christ's name we pray amen
[16:10] I mean as we all know it's a first day
[16:19] first time to stand in to say something
[16:24] and let's open our Bible in the book of
[16:28] numbers the numbers 11th chapter verse 1
[16:39] in verse 2
[16:59] Amanda Bible says and when the people
[17:03] complained he displeased the Lord and
[17:06] the lower heard it and his anger was
[17:09] candle and the fiery of the Lord burn
[17:12] amount him and consumed them that were
[17:15] in the other most part of the camp
[17:17] let's turn our Bible to 1st Corinthians
[17:21] chapter 10
[17:33] you read the verse 9 to 13 the Bible
[17:42] says neither let us tempt Christ as some
[17:47] of them also tempted and were destroyed
[17:50] of the Serpent's neither murmur ye as
[17:54] some of mosul murmured and were
[17:56] destroyed of the destroyer now all these
[18:01] things happened unto them for example
[18:03] and they are written for our admonition
[18:06] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[18:11] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[18:14] standeth take heed lest he fall there is
[18:18] no temptation taken you but such as is
[18:21] common to man but God is faithful who
[18:24] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[18:27] that you are able but we're about will
[18:31] with the temptation also make a way to
[18:34] escape that you may be able to bear it
[18:37] amen let's pray Lord as a prophet was
[18:43] saying everybody can open Lord turn the
[18:46] pages of this book but no one can give
[18:48] although God explained it Lord we need
[18:52] you Lord to come and use us Lord Jesus
[18:54] Christ in Jesus name we pray amen you
[18:58] may be seated
[18:59] and as I was saying I thank everybody
[19:04] for coming you know wake coming here I
[19:09] serve brother buck steaks saying that
[19:12] you'll be the first one who were going
[19:14] you only have 5 to 10 minutes
[19:17] and guess what happened after that we
[19:20] got pulled over by the postman just
[19:23] right here and well we say well nothing
[19:27] happens God God knows why he happened he
[19:31] has so tonight we have a little subject
[19:36] that want to share it so do not complain
[19:39] when you try it or do not complain when
[19:43] you test it
[19:44] because we know as the prophet of God
[19:46] says that every question we have to pass
[19:50] the third temptations we have to pass
[19:52] through tests he said that every
[19:54] Christians when we believe when we
[19:56] confess and say that we believe in
[19:58] Christ Jesus Christ we have to pass
[20:01] through temptation God has to test us
[20:03] and he gave an example of one of his
[20:07] sermon I was listening I think yesterday
[20:09] he said that one day was a man he was he
[20:13] had a vision to build a bridge and
[20:16] everybody older
[20:19] all the people who knew about building
[20:22] bridges came to him and say you know
[20:24] you're not going to build any bridge
[20:26] there because there it's impossible for
[20:29] you to breathe there cause the sand is
[20:31] now good so it's not good and everything
[20:33] is bad but that meant stood and say you
[20:35] know I had the vision that I am going to
[20:39] build I am going to build a bridge right
[20:40] here and the prophet of God said that he
[20:42] had to test every instrument that he had
[20:45] that he was going to use he had to test
[20:47] every material has to test everything
[20:49] that it was going to use he said that
[20:51] it's the same thing with God that when
[20:54] God forgot to use you into his body
[20:57] forgot to use you for a certain purpose
[21:00] he has to test you to see if you really
[21:02] can stand he said that dumb man was not
[21:06] it was testing this thing not because of
[21:09] me but it was just think those are the
[21:11] materials that he was going to use
[21:12] because of his name he said that because
[21:15] when as I was talking to my brothers you
[21:18] know we're here I told them that God the
[21:22] man when someone built want to build
[21:25] something or he want to build a bridge
[21:27] or a house or something in engineer he
[21:29] has to make sure were that everything is
[21:31] doing is correct why because if it's not
[21:33] correct his reputation will be bad
[21:36] people with not give him anything else
[21:38] he said that's the same thing with God
[21:40] when he gives a word he has to try yes
[21:43] to test it when he gives a man when he
[21:45] put you into a service or you want to
[21:47] use you for something he has to test you
[21:50] to try you had to test you for powerful
[21:52] for the service the property oh my soul
[21:56] would cry hallelujah to God
[21:58] when I think that God puts in his church
[22:00] the best that he can find it the best
[22:03] that he can find God takes his children
[22:05] and test them with an acid test then he
[22:09] places them into a body of grass because
[22:11] they are tested they believe they went
[22:15] through the trials they had their faith
[22:17] and experience they are witness of ease
[22:20] they knew that they talk they know what
[22:22] they're talking about not just an
[22:25] intellectual conception but there have
[22:27] been born again of the precious Holy
[22:30] Spirit and time-tested and try until
[22:33] their souls are set like a flint tort
[22:36] recovery yes they are time tested they
[22:41] are weakness of his power
[22:43] and through that God is building a
[22:45] bridge from earth to glory that the
[22:48] wayfaring man may come on the highway
[22:51] sit down sit down under the tree in the
[22:56] cool of the day by time-tested materials
[22:59] those who take God at His Word no matter
[23:03] what the symptoms are no matter what the
[23:06] circumstances that God that doesn't
[23:09] stand in the way God has got time-tested
[23:12] material as witness and it faces it you
[23:17] know the Prophet is telling that when
[23:19] you go through the Bible's you will see
[23:22] every man of God or a vision of God has
[23:24] been tested where we read in numbers
[23:27] that they put numbers Moses wrote that
[23:31] this book he's talking about the tune of
[23:33] Israel we all know that it you know
[23:35] obviously you know of Israel spent our
[23:37] four hundred four hundred years in Egypt
[23:39] and they cried out to the Lord they say
[23:41] Lord come set us free they cried out to
[23:43] the Lord Lord please send the deliverer
[23:45] to set us free to let us go so that we
[23:48] may go I have noticed something that
[23:50] when the Lord answered their prayers the
[23:52] Lord sent to them Moses and they saw all
[23:55] the miracles that happened in Egypt they
[23:58] saw everything that God operates God God
[24:00] God all the miracles that God did and
[24:04] they saw how God has to add to divide
[24:07] the Red Sea so that they may walk but
[24:09] arriving in the desert there were tests
[24:12] by God God centimetres but instead of
[24:14] thinking of what God has still told them
[24:17] instead of thinking of what God did with
[24:20] them they began to comprehend against
[24:22] before they began to complain about what
[24:24] God did and we did we read here that the
[24:26] Bible says that God that didn't please
[24:30] God that displeased God why because God
[24:33] because God gave you something and you
[24:36] began to complain against him and the
[24:39] prophet of God said it's not good to
[24:42] complain and the Bible says that it's
[24:43] not good to complain against the Lord
[24:45] when we read I was reading one time in
[24:47] the book of Job I think the last almost
[24:50] the last chapter you see the Bible God
[24:52] told the the jobs friend it's all Easter
[24:55] let me say you when my son job was going
[24:58] through a hard time you didn't honor me
[25:01] with your words by you complained
[25:03] against me you spoke you spoke against
[25:06] me and now my rough is kindled against
[25:09] you so you have to go and repent so
[25:12] that's to say that complaining it's not
[25:14] good I looked at the dictionary while
[25:16] complaining means they say that it's
[25:18] mean it's the the when you not satisfied
[25:20] with something so when you complain that
[25:22] means that you're not satisfied with
[25:24] what God is saying or with what God is
[25:27] bringing you through but the Bible say
[25:29] that everything works well for those who
[25:31] believe in God so if God wanted you I
[25:34] wanted you to pass through a temptation
[25:36] if God wanted you to pass through a hard
[25:38] time that means that God knew why as my
[25:41] as my brother lease was saying they say
[25:43] that God always give us the best for you
[25:46] for example for you to pass through
[25:48] that's the best that God was given to
[25:51] you that means that when you have those
[25:53] things you have to trust God you have to
[25:55] be like sure you know we read the story
[25:58] of Job and we think that was easy for
[26:01] job chief to say those things but we
[26:03] realized that God was testing job trying
[26:07] to imagine something God was standing
[26:09] there and he called the devil they say
[26:11] you there what did you see my my son job
[26:13] right there did you see him you say yes
[26:16] I saw him but they say you know that man
[26:19] you can do whatever you want you won't
[26:22] you won't curse my name you we always
[26:24] stand for me
[26:25] and the devil told God they said you
[26:27] know what just take away everything you
[26:31] gave him and you will curse your name
[26:33] and stuff like that and the Bible says
[26:36] that God was trusting job and when the
[26:41] devil went to him the Prophet said that
[26:42] God when let done when God let the devil
[26:45] trust now to test job or to attempt job
[26:48] he said God was waiting for job to
[26:51] respond as God told Satan because God
[26:54] saw system that whatever you gonna do to
[26:56] him it will not curse my name so God was
[26:58] there silent was waiting to see what job
[27:02] will answer him or what job will say to
[27:05] the devil and we all know that job when
[27:08] did ever wondered ever came to me say
[27:10] the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh very
[27:13] breathless of it his name
[27:14] he said that should be the same the same
[27:16] answer we favorite Christian you know
[27:19] because is it that should be the same
[27:22] answer with every question when we
[27:24] Buster trials when we pass through
[27:26] temptation you know it may be hard that
[27:29] we cannot think you know you may be hard
[27:31] that way you think that you know life is
[27:33] not love well you know I will not live
[27:36] tomorrow or as you know something is
[27:39] going really bad and you think that you
[27:41] know tomorrow maybe we now wake up maybe
[27:44] as diseases or something else what you
[27:46] know just trust God he said it and he's
[27:50] going to fulfill it just trust his word
[27:52] that that's all he needs you need to
[27:54] trust is where the prophet of God said
[27:56] God don't need no education but God
[27:58] needs somebody a heart who we trust him
[28:01] so why don't you just trust his word why
[28:03] do you say you know when we look at this
[28:06] book of numbers I was reading The Book
[28:08] of Numbers and I saw that when God told
[28:11] the children of Israel to go to possess
[28:14] to go just by to the land to spite the
[28:18] land he said Moses sent spies to go
[28:21] there and when they came back they saw
[28:24] that the land was what God told them but
[28:27] one thing they saw that the head test
[28:31] before them they had things to overcome
[28:33] the head tests to pasture and you know
[28:36] many of them when they came back they
[28:38] said you
[28:39] I just quit I'm now going to do it no
[28:42] more I just quit I'm not going I'm not
[28:44] able to fight this test I'm not able to
[28:46] fight those men because they find the
[28:48] same that do demand that they had to
[28:50] fight you to fight was bigger than them
[28:52] and they will fight them and I love what
[28:56] the Bible says about Kelly the Bible
[28:58] says that Kelly steal the people because
[29:01] what he knew what God said God will
[29:05] fulfill him
[29:06] he knew what God said God will God
[29:08] before fear and with you read you read
[29:10] father you will notice that when Joshua
[29:13] also stood up Joshua repeat the same
[29:15] thing he said if God is with us we will
[29:18] overcome it if God is with us
[29:21] we will fight those people no matter how
[29:23] they are it's not us fighting but it's
[29:26] the Lord
[29:26] why because again he gave His Word and
[29:30] he has to fulfill it you know it's the
[29:32] same thing God saying that I will never
[29:34] give you a temptation or it's right that
[29:37] is that is beyond your abilities to
[29:39] overcome it so why don't you just trust
[29:41] God why don't you just say their Lord
[29:44] you say it and I just trust you I'll go
[29:47] to you and you say even though I gave
[29:49] your test that is now beyond your
[29:51] abilities I will be there to make a way
[29:54] of escape
[29:54] that's the Lord we have just to put our
[29:57] faith money we have just too pretty to
[29:59] trust him when and the Bible says that I
[30:03] was reading also the the the the story
[30:08] of the day in Hebrews children you know
[30:11] when they the prophet of God said the
[30:14] Hebrew children they spoke about the
[30:17] Lord in the city where they were they
[30:19] told everybody that you know we serve a
[30:22] God who is real and he does miracles
[30:24] things and the Lord wanted to test them
[30:27] about what they were saying because they
[30:31] said the prophet of God said because
[30:32] many people in the church we live with
[30:35] their mouth by in their heart they don't
[30:36] believe you know that's why God is
[30:39] coming to test you and to see if you
[30:41] really believe what you wear if you
[30:44] really believe what you say you know and
[30:47] he said that you know of Israel were
[30:49] there that he was stealing were there
[30:50] and
[30:52] the Lord put a test before them they had
[30:55] to worship the statue or that will be
[30:59] burned and they stood there they say we
[31:03] will not worship it because they learned
[31:06] they knew that the Word of God you will
[31:08] not have two or three gods before me
[31:10] there is only one God and they had to
[31:13] stand for the word of God because if you
[31:16] stand for the Lord the Lord will stand
[31:18] for you and they're still there and
[31:22] arriving when they respect what God said
[31:25] they say okay now you guys are going to
[31:28] be burned and so forever you guys are
[31:29] going to be burned and they came
[31:31] commanded you
[31:32] did you hear the fire seven times harder
[31:35] than he was and they were there walking
[31:38] and the prophet of God said that God was
[31:41] silent gods were watching them seeing if
[31:45] there will really keep the faith
[31:47] if they will really keep the faith and
[31:49] arriving there at that time
[31:52] and as he went the Gawain gods so that
[31:54] they kept their faith God came you know
[31:57] I was thinking that God came even before
[32:00] the answer why because realized the man
[32:03] who heeded the the defier themself the
[32:06] God killed but why God led them to go to
[32:09] them in the when God saw the trust when
[32:11] God saw their heart and he said now I
[32:13] have to come and I have to believe and I
[32:16] have to come to join my children because
[32:18] what it's my name it's not because of
[32:21] about my name they kept my name and I
[32:23] have to haunt it what I'm saying amen
[32:26] and uh okay I am all y'all wanted to to
[32:36] read the prophet or what you say we
[32:43] talked about the story of job the
[32:46] prophet I say he tried job and see what
[32:49] kind of to see and see what kind of
[32:52] reaction you will find in him but when
[32:56] it took his sheep and took his ox and
[32:58] took his camels and took his children
[33:01] and see God say I will see what job says
[33:05] now
[33:06] and he said the Lord gave and the Lord
[33:09] taking away let's say be the name of the
[33:11] Lord you say he found he found why he
[33:14] had to Satan he had a white herd why he
[33:18] had so Satan he had in job none like him
[33:21] on the earth you know it's the same
[33:24] thing that I give an example for example
[33:27] I am the teacher and brother Brooks also
[33:29] is a teacher I teach for example
[33:31] mathematics and I have my students I say
[33:33] you know I give them some exercises and
[33:37] I teach them out you to solve problems
[33:40] and itself to solve problems and all the
[33:42] exercise and brother Brooks games and
[33:44] say you know Isaac you know why I want
[33:46] to challenge your to your children to
[33:47] see if you're really if they really
[33:49] understand what you teach them and what
[33:53] I we do as teacher I would choose the
[33:55] best of my children to stand the test
[33:58] and I was telling when I would give him
[34:00] all the tactics and I would give him all
[34:02] the weapons and I would give him all the
[34:05] things that you can't do we can use to
[34:07] pass that test and try to imagine
[34:09] something I teach him for example the
[34:12] same thing that X plus one equals zero
[34:15] that means that x equals minus one and
[34:19] brother boosts comes and he gave him the
[34:21] same test and my team am i my student
[34:24] failed the test how would you feel you
[34:28] know it's the same thing that how God
[34:30] also can feel when he gives you the Word
[34:33] of God and you don't you know it's not
[34:35] because his word is not true by it's
[34:38] because you don't believe in this word
[34:39] that you felt it just and a prophet of
[34:42] God go farther it said if you don't
[34:44] believe the Word of God it's an insult
[34:46] to God and nobody wanna insult God
[34:50] that's why you know we have to believe
[34:53] it's him
[34:54] we have to believe in is where we have
[34:55] to wait upon the Lord the Bible says
[34:57] that they that wait upon the Lord shall
[34:59] renew their strength
[35:01] just wait just relax we'll go to God and
[35:04] pray go to him and pray wait upon him
[35:07] and is the one who will give he's the
[35:09] one who will give you strength is the
[35:11] one who will give you faith use the one
[35:12] who will do everything you know I I like
[35:16] the story of Job you know of
[35:18] object.observe
[35:20] you know Jacob after being with Lebanon
[35:23] after 11 left you know he sent his he
[35:27] sent his servant to go meet his brother
[35:30] and arriving there his servant comes
[35:34] back and they say you know what I'm an
[35:36] Easter coming with 400 men against you
[35:39] you know the Bible say that jrj kaffir
[35:42] but he tried as every man can do he
[35:46] tried to to find a way to fund the
[35:49] solution to the problem you know you say
[35:52] okay I'm going to divide my group into
[35:54] three groups so you go first if he meets
[35:57] you for example he will kill you and if
[35:59] you made the second maybe we'll forgive
[36:01] and then I will come myself do it
[36:04] and then you know the job be Jacob found
[36:09] out that that wasn't enough and maybe I
[36:13] was thinking maybe you heard a small
[36:15] voice in his horse saying why don't you
[36:17] try the Lord maybe you remember one of
[36:21] his his father sermon saying that trust
[36:24] the Lord why don't you go to him and the
[36:26] Bible say that George Jacob went to the
[36:29] Lord
[36:29] Jacob went to pray and he prayed he gave
[36:34] everything to God and he started to
[36:35] remember God you know to remember God
[36:38] what he's saying
[36:39] the Bible says that he be Jacob becoming
[36:42] began to say that Lord you promised my
[36:44] father that you will give him you will
[36:47] give him a seed that will be that will
[36:50] not be numbered so now look at my
[36:52] brother is coming to kill me so he began
[36:54] to remember they God you know you said
[36:57] this I didn't say I didn't tell you to
[36:59] say you said it and you have to stand
[37:02] for it and that's what Jacob did and you
[37:06] know what that was I think that was in
[37:08] the morning or in there in the day and
[37:10] then after that in the night the Bible
[37:14] says that Jacob met the angel and
[37:16] arriving there when he made the angel of
[37:18] God he fought with the angel and then he
[37:22] said he named that place opinion that
[37:24] means the God afraid I've seen God face
[37:27] to face and God preserved my life you
[37:31] know I looked at our word I say
[37:32] preserved
[37:33] laughs I say you know even though he so
[37:36] his brother could come and find him that
[37:38] we're not doing the hood because they
[37:40] say God preserved my life
[37:41] he made God face-to-face God preserved
[37:44] my life maybe you're going through a
[37:46] trial maybe you're going through a hard
[37:47] time
[37:48] maybe you going through or maybe you
[37:51] have problems maybe you you have many
[37:54] things to avoid many difficulties he may
[37:56] be financial you might be in your house
[37:59] or your children or yourself I don't
[38:03] know what else but God knows it
[38:05] God knows your problem God knows what
[38:08] you're going through and why don't you
[38:10] like jerko go to him
[38:14] remind him what he's saying you know the
[38:17] prophet of God said sometimes when the
[38:21] devil comes to teach and to attempt to
[38:23] you you say sometimes I remember what
[38:27] God say because he gave me strength
[38:30] you know if the same thing remind god
[38:33] what he's saying and it will do it it
[38:37] will honor you it has 200 the prophet of
[38:39] God said that before God pronounced
[38:41] something or before God send his word
[38:44] the prophet of God said God had to test
[38:46] the word that he's going to say he had
[38:48] to make sure that the word I'm going
[38:50] that they were that the word that I'm
[38:52] saying will not fail he had to make sure
[38:55] that the word where I'm gonna I'm saying
[38:57] we're not fair and the God the prophet
[38:59] of God said God has proven as proven
[39:02] that his word did not fail just meet the
[39:05] requirement that you know visit you know
[39:08] the Hebrew that they met the requirement
[39:10] they were prayed up they were waiting on
[39:12] the Lord and meet the requirement go to
[39:15] him it will me where it will give you
[39:19] solution you know he said in the word if
[39:22] you open to Matthew chapter 7 the Bible
[39:25] says let us really
[39:40] marriage up to seven verse 24 the Bible
[39:48] says therefore whosoever heareth these
[39:52] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[39:56] liken him unto a wise man which built
[39:59] his house upon the rock and the rain
[40:02] descended and the floods came and the
[40:05] winds blew and beat upon the house and
[40:09] he fell not for it was founded upon the
[40:13] rock you know think of this verse see
[40:17] what the rain means it's not trials it's
[40:22] not things that can come to beat up did
[40:25] you not try us it's not hard time that
[40:27] can come think that what the floods mean
[40:30] it's not trials it's not hard time that
[40:33] we can't have but if you if you you read
[40:37] the Bible says that if you if you're
[40:41] here and do the Word of God do what is
[40:45] saying you know you do what he says he
[40:49] said it's like a man that built his
[40:52] house on the rock and we all know that
[40:54] the rock is Jesus Christ so if you do
[40:57] you hear the word of God and you
[40:59] practice it you know you will be it your
[41:03] faith in Jesus Christ no matter what can
[41:06] come the one no matter the flood can
[41:08] come the rain can come temptation may
[41:11] come trials may come hard time can come
[41:13] you will now move your faith because you
[41:16] have anchored your faith in Jesus Christ

[47:08] want to say Lord heal Leicester's in
[47:10] Jesus Christ's name I pray believing
[47:12] amen also still standing let's just open
[47:16] our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 the
[47:22] first verse
[47:34] he reads now faith is the substance of
[47:38] things hoped for the evidence of things
[47:41] not seen
[47:43] amen we can take our seat tonight I want
[47:52] to speak on the subject Supreme fate
[47:56] amen
[47:58] going back to Hebrews 11 he says now
[48:02] faith is the substance of things hoped
[48:05] for the evidence of things not seen many
[48:09] times we go over this and not understand
[48:12] what it means because we have the
[48:15] conception that faith it's something
[48:18] that's virtual something out there in
[48:21] space but if you look into the
[48:26] dictionary and look for the meaning of
[48:28] the word substance it's something that
[48:30] you can touch just as sure as I'm
[48:33] holding this bottle that is faith amen
[48:36] and the evidence of things that we don't
[48:40] see we all know what evidence is it just
[48:46] means for sure that something is there
[48:48] amen um before I go forward I just want
[48:54] to thank the pastor for giving me this
[48:55] opportunity
[48:56] amen
[48:59] I just want to ask each and every one of
[49:02] you a question
[49:03] when you came in here to sit how many
[49:06] check you the edge here was gonna was
[49:08] okay if it was balancing well can you
[49:11] raise your hand no one did that was
[49:16] faith you had faith in that chair you
[49:20] didn't even hesitate before you set on
[49:22] it you knew that it was going to hold
[49:25] your weight Amen that's how simple faith
[49:28] is and the Prophet calls faith the sixth
[49:33] sense the sixth sense which stays in our
[49:38] soul and in our soul is either day is
[49:41] doubt of faith but we know for us
[49:44] believers there is faith
[49:46] I still remember when I was in a
[49:48] sixth-grade it was a Wednesday service
[49:51] after my dad had preached about faith
[49:54] the following day I went back to school
[49:57] and we were writing a test and in the
[50:01] test there was a question he says how
[50:04] many senses that does a person have and
[50:09] I remembered my dad had fries about the
[50:11] sixth sense and I wrote six I was so
[50:16] confident when I was writing my answer I
[50:21] looked at everyone else I knew they were
[50:23] gonna write five but I knew I had the
[50:26] ultimate answer amen we submitted our
[50:31] papers and then after our teacher
[50:34] finished grading it she called me out in
[50:37] front of the class it was a joke and I
[50:42] was mad I went back home I told my mom I
[50:45] said mom you heard what was being
[50:48] preached in church but this is what I
[50:51] wrote in school but I failed my test so
[50:54] she came back and she laughed about it
[50:56] and she told my dad then a later one
[50:58] explained Amen so this that is faith the
[51:04] sixth sense which shuts out all the
[51:07] other five senses Amen let's look at
[51:11] what the Prophet says about about faith
[51:14] how he explains it because many times we
[51:19] believe we think that faith is something
[51:23] that maybe a bishop or some huge person
[51:27] is supposed to have to be able to work
[51:29] out miracles raise the dead and we think
[51:32] that are just ordinary people we don't
[51:35] have faith or little but that's not the
[51:38] case as we said earlier on you said on
[51:41] your chair that was faith so let's read
[51:44] in armed blasphemous names
[51:51] well the Prophet talks about this i'ma
[51:52] try and read this slowly blasphemous
[51:56] names paragraph 143 the prophecies and
[52:01] the biggest part of our faith is mental
[52:04] faith by hearing the word it brings us
[52:08] to a mental recognition of God but if
[52:13] this coming from above
[52:15] oh brother if it ever strike this there
[52:19] is a godly spiritual faith then what
[52:23] does that faith do that faith recognizes
[52:26] only the word no matter what
[52:29] anything else says it only recognizes
[52:32] the word because in the beginning was
[52:35] the word and the Word was with God and
[52:38] the Word was God and the word is still
[52:42] God amen and the word was made flesh and
[52:46] dwelt among us and when the word itself
[52:52] is pouring into our faith our mental
[52:56] faith becomes a spiritual revelation so
[53:00] each and every one of us when we are
[53:02] born as humans the Prophet is saying
[53:04] here we have mental faith but we as
[53:09] believers we are not ordinary people we
[53:12] have believed the message a man and now
[53:16] he says with that mental faith that you
[53:19] are in born with when the word itself is
[53:23] pouring into your faith that mental
[53:26] faith becomes a spiritual revelation
[53:28] amen and that makes it supreme faith
[53:31] different from every other person's Amen
[53:35] because we are at different people a man
[53:37] called for a higher calling hallelujah
[53:40] Amen and I want to read another quote
[53:47] from proving his word paragraph 64 the
[53:52] prophecies you can only have faith as
[53:55] God gives you faith faith is a gift of
[53:59] God
[54:01] ever how religious you may be yet it
[54:04] must take you must have faith and your
[54:08] faith can only rest if you're a
[54:09] Christian upon the proven Word of God
[54:12] amen we hear they're here now that faith
[54:17] is a gift from God so you do not have to
[54:19] worry whether you have faith or not
[54:22] because God gave you the faith amen
[54:29] many times we fly and get in planes but
[54:33] we never ask the pilot are you sure we
[54:36] gonna get there we don't do that we just
[54:39] have faith we know they're gonna take us
[54:40] there but when you pray for God to heal
[54:44] you you're gonna have doubt we start
[54:47] doubting is he really gonna do this that
[54:52] just gets me to think what my brother
[54:53] was saying that we are not trusting in
[54:55] God and that's an insult amen we trust
[54:59] in worldly things but it's hard for us
[55:01] to trust in God this faith I was talking
[55:07] about spiritual faith he just didn't
[55:10] come from nowhere we can trace it back
[55:14] to Abraham who is known as the father of
[55:18] faith and there is no father without
[55:21] children amen
[55:25] they just don't call Abraham the father
[55:27] of faith and he doesn't have the
[55:29] children of faith let us look in
[55:34] Galatians chapter 3 verse 7 to see who
[55:37] these children are
[55:48] Galatians 3 verse 7
[56:05] know ye therefore that they which are of
[56:08] faith the same are the children of
[56:11] Abraham the person sitting next to you
[56:14] right now is the child of Abraham so we
[56:18] have faith in us passed down from
[56:23] Abraham when you repent when you become
[56:28] a believer when you accept Christ as
[56:30] your Savior but gene is attached to our
[56:35] DNA and it is genetically modified to us
[56:39] and we are now children of Abraham amen
[56:44] we were in his loins before the
[56:46] foundation of the world when Abraham was
[56:49] called by God we were in Abraham Amen do
[56:52] we believe it
[56:53] we had just told we are chilled we are
[56:55] Abraham's children amen
[56:58] when Abraham was given the promise when
[57:01] he was 75 years old we were with him and
[57:05] he waited for 25 years that's not a
[57:09] that's not a joke I'm not yet even 25
[57:13] but he had to wait on God amen but we
[57:17] were with him amen
[57:19] you know I remember some time ago I used
[57:28] to answer my dad's phone so my mom
[57:30] called this other time and I picked up
[57:33] the phone so I told whatever I said then
[57:37] I hung up I forgot to talk to tell my
[57:39] dad that I had that I had my mom had
[57:43] called and I had talked back to her so
[57:45] when we got back home my mom said but
[57:48] when you called you say this you say no
[57:51] I did not he didn't call she said yes I
[57:54] did so I was away when they were talking
[57:57] about it I came back I said you know
[57:59] that was me so my voice was so similar
[58:04] to him I couldn't help it why because it
[58:07] was in the genes amen
[58:11] it is in the genes I couldn't help it
[58:13] now we have the gene of faith whether we
[58:17] like it or not we have faith aim
[58:19] we just have to exercise it a man
[58:28] let's read James to verse 26
[58:54] it says for as the body without the
[58:56] Spirit is dead so faith without works is
[58:59] dead also that's why many times you try
[59:04] to pray for something you see it does
[59:07] not work you have the faith but it is
[59:09] lying dormant in you you just have to
[59:11] work it out you know I believe most of
[59:15] you may be brothers
[59:16] mostly at some point in time you used to
[59:19] go to the gym and work out you know you
[59:24] start working out you see some
[59:26] development happening you see some
[59:29] muscles coming up that's because you are
[59:31] working out if you don't work out
[59:33] nothing comes out amen so this is what
[59:37] we are being told here faith without
[59:39] works is dead so you have to exercise it
[59:43] you just cannot wake up one day you want
[59:47] to pray for a dead person to raise but
[59:50] you have never prayed for a headache and
[59:53] it and it went you cannot do that you
[59:57] have to work at amen and we are told we
[1:00:02] have to work it so that we we we get
[1:00:07] more faith amen
[1:00:08] I just want to read this quote the
[1:00:11] Prophet talks about that analogy Amen
[1:00:17] you say his genuine faith doesn't take
[1:00:21] no for an answer
[1:00:22] it's got hairs on the chest it's big and
[1:00:26] burly it speaks and everything else sets
[1:00:29] down that's all
[1:00:31] amen when God said you are healed just
[1:00:36] believe it that's sixth sense it shuts
[1:00:40] out all the other senses amen
[1:00:43] if your sense of feeling says no I'm
[1:00:46] still feeling I'm still feeling some
[1:00:49] pain faith says shut up
[1:00:52] amen when you're feeling tired faith
[1:00:56] says no shut up amen because faith is
[1:01:00] the boss amen
[1:01:01] if the old you know feelings raise up
[1:01:03] and say you don't feel any different
[1:01:07] you say shut up faith we'll sit down God
[1:01:12] took over and that's it now well your
[1:01:16] stomach still hurting shut up don't even
[1:01:19] feel it that's it
[1:01:21] amen thus sure is looking at what God
[1:01:24] said God said so so faith believes it if
[1:01:28] you can just hold on faith on a letter
[1:01:31] just faith take over it makes the rest
[1:01:34] of them look like little Dwarfs a man it
[1:01:37] just makes them sit down because he is
[1:01:39] the boss got great big brawny muscles
[1:01:43] and I tell you everything else all
[1:01:45] feelings and superstitions and little
[1:01:48] isms and things just sets down when
[1:01:51] faith takes over he's the boss that's
[1:01:54] just right Amen that was in expectations
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] we can see this with David in his own
[1:02:01] experience he just didn't come up to
[1:02:03] challenge Goliath no he did not
[1:02:07] at first he was in the wilderness
[1:02:11] herding the Sheep then a lion came down
[1:02:16] you know he's got his little sling he
[1:02:19] says let me try this it takes it let's
[1:02:24] go the lion is dead God gave him more
[1:02:28] confidence more muscles coming up a man
[1:02:33] he keeps on he's heading his sheep he's
[1:02:36] heading his sheep next time around a
[1:02:38] beer comes around he sees it he
[1:02:41] remembers but I've killed a lion before
[1:02:43] I can do it again a man he takes the
[1:02:47] slingshot put the stone in there he
[1:02:50] swings it and he lets it go and then the
[1:02:54] beer dies after some time when his
[1:02:59] father sent him with food to go give his
[1:03:01] brothers were in the army
[1:03:03] these brothers know nothing about the
[1:03:06] elite oh brother was you know the
[1:03:08] Shepherd in the desert them all soldiers
[1:03:12] and all that and then he comes up and he
[1:03:15] challenges Goliath he was not just
[1:03:17] talking from
[1:03:19] because he knew God did it before two
[1:03:23] times and he knew he could do it again
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] that's why he got up with courage in
[1:03:28] front of all the hosts of Israel and he
[1:03:32] went to challenge the Philistines he got
[1:03:34] the stone put it in his sling he
[1:03:38] remember he looked at that he looked at
[1:03:40] that giant and he said I'm going to cut
[1:03:42] off your head and I'll feed you to the
[1:03:44] fowls of the air you just don't say that
[1:03:46] unless you know what you're standing on
[1:03:48] a man he was standing on faith he knew
[1:03:53] God had done it before and he was going
[1:03:55] to do it again he took his stone put it
[1:03:58] in the slingshot swing it swing it he
[1:04:01] let go
[1:04:02] he knew the job was already completed
[1:04:05] and the giant fell down amen he just did
[1:04:09] not wake up to do that but he was
[1:04:11] working it out while he was in the
[1:04:13] backside of the desert amen many a times
[1:04:17] in homes you know we have little
[1:04:19] situations that come up you just have a
[1:04:21] little tummy ache
[1:04:22] you know just pray about it it's alright
[1:04:26] to take medicine it's good it's good to
[1:04:29] take it but sometimes just pray work out
[1:04:32] that faith it's going to come in handy
[1:04:35] amen you're trying to start your car
[1:04:41] sometime it's not working
[1:04:42] just try it amen that's how you get it
[1:04:48] that's how you get those burly muscles
[1:04:51] amen nothing will be able to stand in
[1:04:53] your way
[1:04:55] hallelujah and we are told by the Bible
[1:04:58] that faith comes by hearing amen
[1:05:02] and not by just hearing anything but by
[1:05:07] hearing the Word of God amen and how do
[1:05:12] we hear the word when we listen to the
[1:05:14] tapes you come every Sunday every
[1:05:16] Wednesday you come listen to the word
[1:05:19] being preached from here you are hearing
[1:05:21] the word and that is faith and the
[1:05:24] Prophet talks about this in the
[1:05:26] exposition of the seven Church ages he
[1:05:29] said so when a spirit born
[1:05:32] spirit filled man in faith takes that
[1:05:35] word into his heart and places it upon
[1:05:38] his lips why that is the same as deity
[1:05:43] speaking every mountain has to go Satan
[1:05:47] cannot stand before that man amen
[1:05:50] why because you heard that word you took
[1:05:53] it to your heart not just mental many at
[1:05:57] times we'd like to have a you know
[1:06:02] mental belief of the word you know we
[1:06:06] are mental message believers we don't
[1:06:07] take it to the heart amen
[1:06:09] it doesn't show in our lives you know we
[1:06:13] try and study and become theologians but
[1:06:16] in the heart day is nothing but this is
[1:06:19] not what the Prophet is saying you take
[1:06:21] the word take it to your heart a man and
[1:06:24] when you put it on your lips it is the
[1:06:27] same as deity speaking the Prophet goes
[1:06:30] on to say in the in the Patmos vision he
[1:06:35] say it's now man I was going to choke it
[1:06:37] but I'm now going to say it man is
[1:06:40] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:06:43] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:06:46] omnipotent did he not say in mark 1112
[1:06:50] whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:06:52] doubt in your heart it'll come to pass
[1:06:55] you can have what you say Amen what
[1:06:58] happens when to omnipotence meet when
[1:07:01] God and men comes together to
[1:07:04] omnipotence a man
[1:07:05] he says something's gotta shake a man
[1:07:08] hails gotta shake a man all the troubles
[1:07:12] gotta shake that disease that's probably
[1:07:14] troubling you gotta shake a man that
[1:07:17] depression that's robbing you is gonna
[1:07:19] shake a man whatsoever you'd say with
[1:07:22] that creative power of omnipotence of
[1:07:24] God knowing that he's promised it and he
[1:07:27] said it in his word it creates a power
[1:07:29] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:07:32] to pass Amen things that is not it makes
[1:07:37] them as though they are because to
[1:07:39] omnipotence have met there he stands oh
[1:07:43] isn't he wonderful amen
[1:07:46] you know in the beginning was the word
[1:07:47] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:07:50] was God
[1:07:51] amen when we take that word to our heart
[1:07:54] we are taking the person of Christ into
[1:07:57] us a man and we are having to omnipotens
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:01] we are having a man and we are having
[1:08:03] God a man and the Prophet is telling us
[1:08:05] when this to omnipotens me oh the
[1:08:08] reaction is explosive there is no hell
[1:08:11] that can't stand a man oh this is
[1:08:16] wonderful
[1:08:16] amen he says I was going to choke it but
[1:08:20] I'm going to say it because you and I
[1:08:22] today we had to know that that we are
[1:08:24] omnipotent amen oh and we know that some
[1:08:32] time ago in the history of mankind
[1:08:38] spiros were created a man and this was
[1:08:43] not just to have a very good story in
[1:08:46] the message or to decorate the message
[1:08:49] books or to just have a wonderful story
[1:08:52] but this creation of squirrels by a
[1:08:57] human carnal human of flesh and blood
[1:09:01] like you and me it was a sign to ask the
[1:09:05] people in the end times that if a man
[1:09:08] who is fully surrendered to God and just
[1:09:11] does this what we were told and take the
[1:09:14] Word of God to his heart put it to his
[1:09:17] lips it is creative power amen
[1:09:20] we know when the Prophet was hunting and
[1:09:22] he was inspired to speak the word and
[1:09:24] creates squirrels amen we know he
[1:09:28] created squirrels but that was not just
[1:09:30] done so we glorify a man but it was for
[1:09:34] that for us so that we know in these end
[1:09:36] times we are able to do it amen we know
[1:09:39] we are little gods you just meet some
[1:09:42] people they just have a good spirit
[1:09:44] around them you know you probably had a
[1:09:47] burden you just talked to them then by
[1:09:50] the time you leave you feel good that
[1:09:53] create of the creativeness of an
[1:09:56] atmosphere a man we are gods we create
[1:10:00] amen so this was to show that we with
[1:10:04] this message that we have we can create
[1:10:07] a man and we see that this is what was
[1:10:10] linked this is where the third pole was
[1:10:12] linked to it was the speaking of the
[1:10:14] word it was to speak and to go forward
[1:10:17] amen and we know that God gave us a
[1:10:20] covenant and he said the car my covenant
[1:10:23] with you is that you speak and I will
[1:10:25] perform amen and we know that we are the
[1:10:29] people to whom the rapture was promised
[1:10:31] amen through all the seven Church ages
[1:10:34] they were kept on the faith they were
[1:10:36] just waiting on this promise but we know
[1:10:38] that this generation will not pass a man
[1:10:41] it is us who's gonna receive it a man
[1:10:45] how can you have faith for the
[1:10:47] translation of your body if you can't
[1:10:50] have faith to get healed of a to date
[1:10:54] that can't happen
[1:10:57] we are the people whom the world is got
[1:11:01] to see a paradox something that has
[1:11:04] never happened before and we're gonna
[1:11:07] have the faith amen when we are ready we
[1:11:12] know rapture is a process and we are
[1:11:14] already going through it
[1:11:15] amen when it comes to the point when we
[1:11:18] have to get our bodies translated that
[1:11:21] faith will make the spirit burst out of
[1:11:23] this body and go back to where we came
[1:11:25] from
[1:11:26] amen Oh faith it is not something you
[1:11:32] have to crank or find somewhere because
[1:11:36] if we read in arm I believe its second
[1:11:39] Peter 2nd Peter 1 verse 5
[1:12:03] and he says and besides this giving all
[1:12:06] diligence add to your faith virtue add
[1:12:11] to your virtue knowledge and to
[1:12:14] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:12:15] patience and it goes on you see of all
[1:12:19] these seven virtues that make up the
[1:12:22] stage of a perfect man you have to add
[1:12:24] everything else what are we adding it to
[1:12:28] faith it says to faith and to your faith
[1:12:32] add virtue which means the faith was
[1:12:37] already there which is this gift God has
[1:12:39] given us amen we just have to work it
[1:12:42] out
[1:12:44] amen we just have to work it out until
[1:12:51] we get into the stage of the perfect man
[1:12:53] until we get to that point where Christ
[1:12:56] can look into us and it's like he is
[1:12:58] looking into a mirror and he's looking
[1:13:01] to us a man you know just like the those
[1:13:05] people will refine gold they take gold
[1:13:08] it's got all these impurities they bit
[1:13:10] it they bit it until they see their own
[1:13:15] reflection in it this is what Christ is
[1:13:18] doing to us in this age amen he's giving
[1:13:20] us these trials but with off with all
[1:13:23] these trials he given us he gave us
[1:13:25] faith to overcome them amen our brother
[1:13:28] he just read the description that say
[1:13:31] there is no there is no temptation
[1:13:34] that's uncommon to man amen which means
[1:13:37] for each and every temptation that that
[1:13:39] that God allows to come in our way God
[1:13:42] has already provided an open way he has
[1:13:44] given us the ability to go through it so
[1:13:47] God is just waiting for us to get to
[1:13:49] that point of maturity amen when he can
[1:13:52] see himself in us he looks at us and he
[1:13:55] looks like it looks like he's looking
[1:13:57] into a mirror he sees his own reflection
[1:13:59] the mrs. mrs. Jesus Christ amen we who
[1:14:03] carry his name and by that time when we
[1:14:06] get to that perfection we will burst out
[1:14:08] of these bodies and go back to where we
[1:14:10] came from amen and it always takes
[1:14:13] supreme faith to do that
[1:14:15] amen god bless you
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:02] oh the angels and heaven in earth
[1:15:07] oh what a mighty God I will Linda into
[1:15:17] oh I will listen go to pray I will say
[1:15:27] all that the Lord who and I will return
[1:15:33] oh ye had hallelujah he has been
[1:15:41] declared who now will regard for ye and
[1:15:45] baby
[1:15:47] I will I will I will
[1:16:29] oh yes baby Oh Eddie harder he has made
[1:16:38] me glad without you
[1:16:43] you've got a round of applause man
[1:16:52] supreme faith
[1:16:55] sometimes when you're preaching and you
[1:16:57] tell people that they are gods
[1:17:00] first of all you born again that's what
[1:17:06] makes you an offspring according to the
[1:17:08] book of Acts the Bible said we are
[1:17:10] offspring of him and in the book
[1:17:15] it tells us that ye are gods to whom the
[1:17:18] word of the Lord comes - we are not
[1:17:23] elohim which means self-existing one but
[1:17:27] we're part of him we are a piece of the
[1:17:31] rock I like it because you know when
[1:17:35] you're born again if I'm born a man a
[1:17:40] man would have a child it would be a man
[1:17:42] child if God would have a child it would
[1:17:45] be a god child that right and that's why
[1:17:50] people are so afraid to see the
[1:17:54] potential that God has in us that's why
[1:17:57] the Bible said it does not yet appear
[1:17:59] what we shall be but one thing for
[1:18:02] certain we will be just like him and
[1:18:05] when you say just like him that means
[1:18:07] the same I have enjoyed the Word of God
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:17] we have been doubly blessed tonight amen
[1:18:22] and I thank God for the gifts of God
[1:18:24] that's in both of these brethren as I
[1:18:28] said when when I preached I was supposed
[1:18:32] to preach as long as I could
[1:18:34] I thought I was gonna at least get a
[1:18:37] half-hour five ten minutes I was doing
[1:18:43] y'all have no idea I'm laughing now I
[1:18:47] know everybody wag their head they said
[1:18:50] no way he could be called a preaching
[1:18:52] better stick to singing but by God's
[1:18:58] grace I knew that I had been on the
[1:19:00] street see my pulpit was not here it was
[1:19:03] out on the street and so I knew that the
[1:19:05] gift was there like our brother Sam you
[1:19:09] say you gotta work it Amen I brother
[1:19:13] Basha plays the guitar it didn't happen
[1:19:16] overnight is that right
[1:19:20] I brother leave Paul he plays the piano
[1:19:22] I wish it was like Bing Bing Bing Bing
[1:19:24] but you gotta work it the gift is in
[1:19:27] them and you got to exercise it got to
[1:19:32] get those fingers just right and after a
[1:19:34] while you won't even have to look at the
[1:19:35] keys like my brother but while you're
[1:19:38] starting out you got to look at those
[1:19:39] keys and make sure those fingers are
[1:19:41] there right and it's so true every one
[1:19:45] of us are being tested and tried that's
[1:19:51] why Paul said we're more than conquerors
[1:19:53] through Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:19:56] both of those messages just so dumped
[1:19:59] tailed I appreciate it and they didn't
[1:20:01] talk to each other God talked to them
[1:20:05] and I am blessed and have been so
[1:20:09] blessed tonight amen you may be seated
[1:20:12] for just a moment
[1:20:13] I appreciate God for being so good to us
[1:20:20] in moments

[1:25:58] you can have all words cannot express
[1:26:13] our gratitude for what the Lord has
[1:26:16] spoken to our heart
[1:26:19] milto faith won't get you nothing but
[1:26:21] frustration but like the brother said
[1:26:25] when he drops down to the heart then we
[1:26:28] can endure the tests brother you know
[1:26:31] Joe was tested but Joe knew God and God
[1:26:36] knew Joe it's a wonderful thing that
[1:26:39] when God could say have you tried my
[1:26:42] serve and so and so he didn't curse Joe
[1:26:46] will be blessed him because at the end
[1:26:49] of the day job understood what was in
[1:26:51] him and Joe began to see that this trial
[1:26:55] is tested he went through brought him
[1:26:59] into a place that he would have never
[1:27:01] gotten to had he not gone through the
[1:27:04] test not prolonging the time but we want
[1:27:07] to remind everybody about the fellowship
[1:27:10] that we'll be having on Saturday around
[1:27:12] 3 o'clock our brother Vinson has
[1:27:14] graduated we went there and we witnessed
[1:27:18] his graduation he he's a doctor now it's
[1:27:29] ok he he could not have done it without
[1:27:33] Jesus I remember the times he couldn't
[1:27:37] understand what was happening Lord pray
[1:27:40] pray for me pray with me brother books
[1:27:42] that God give me understanding there
[1:27:45] were times and don't matter whether the
[1:27:49] instructor wasn't explaining it right or
[1:27:51] whatever the thing was but God opened
[1:27:53] his understanding I remember the time in
[1:27:56] my life when I couldn't remember I
[1:27:57] couldn't understand it I prayed in God
[1:28:00] roof opening and of course I was in
[1:28:03] Pentecostal church then I was at
[1:28:04] University South Carolina I begin to act
[1:28:07] like a realistic but nevertheless all
[1:28:11] I'm saying is we know that all of our
[1:28:13] achievements must go back to God
[1:28:16] everything we are all of us couldn't be
[1:28:20] scientists all of us couldn't be doctors
[1:28:22] all of us couldn't be competent or all
[1:28:24] of us couldn't be dentists you know III
[1:28:27] brother brother rich brought that to my
[1:28:29] attention one time he says you know what
[1:28:31] everything has been so ordained
[1:28:33] by God he got the number of teachers he
[1:28:36] need the number of doctors he need the
[1:28:38] number of musicians he need and all of
[1:28:40] these things work toward his purpose I
[1:28:45] have been blessed I don't want to leave
[1:28:47] but I know we have to we got our
[1:28:49] brothers from brother say let us not
[1:28:52] forget we it's a partner so bring some

[1:29:02] some you can put your own labor on it
[1:29:08] but what we want to fellowship and we
[1:29:10] want to just show our brother hits our
[1:29:12] appreciation I appreciate him he's been
