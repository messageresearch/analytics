hallelujah I had another message I wanted to um but the Lord cannot had me finish up on this morning so as we stand let us turn again to job 38. we're gonna read the third and fourth verse of job and then we'll go down to I believe it's the seventh verse is God is good to us girdled up thy loans like a man for I will demand of thee an answer and answered thou me where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare it dealer if thou Hast understand when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for job let us pray father we once again come before we thank you for your grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us Lord than we've been to ourselves in your precious name we ask these things in Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated that's why hallelujah hallelujah we'd like to entitle this message the revelation of perfection oftentimes we have been taught that our Perfection come by human efforts and by the way of the law yeah for hundreds of years they tried to perfect capable of perfecting the only person who can perfect us is Jesus Christ himself and this is why the blood of Jesus Christ was shared not only for the remission of sins but it was shared to present to present us Perfection only comes through the blood of Jesus Christ and by the blood of Jesus Christ he was a man by the name of job that God literally bragged on him even said unto Satan have you considered my servant so when God calls you perfect you are perfect but we must understand job's perfection foreign [Applause] that sacrifice would cover them so sacrifice and we know the story Joe's children he's on for the job was called out in the ACT Hallelujah all of them duties were killed he's at the tree but we find out that job never lost one because Hallelujah when God began to restore He restored job in such a mighty way and when it came to his children brother Brandon said it like this have you noticed God did not multiply Joe's children but God gave Joe you know Hallelujah here God says to Joe hello thyself like a man and answer me Hallelujah is that right right but I will demand where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth declare it if thou Hast understand that morning star the seventh verse the verses when the morning stare together and all the sons of God shouted for joy we say that what did Brother Branham say yes Hallelujah it was the answer to job's question because in that group that shouted job was there Hallelujah so you say well Brothers what are you trying to say something foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but you were sealed [Music] oh yeah is that all right I'm gonna read that quote like I read this morning I hope this is okay with you I won't be long tonight I just want to touch a brush up on something from Israel in the church in paragraph 92 paragraph uh no longer he said oh Calvary Calvary Jesus bled and died for me then he tore the soul of his own son Allah throw your body into the ground for three days and nights it rolls up if it was not possible his soul in hell [Applause] [Music] but now that the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] [Laughter] [Music] see if you can see your salvation you'll be so happy see any clear enough we're not seeing it like it really is worry about being lost but to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's not even possible Hallelujah [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah he tore the soul of his own son yeah he separated the Covenant and he throw the body into the ground it laid there for three days and nights for it was not possible that the Holy One shall see corruption neither will I leave all in hell so now don't y'all better hear what I'm saying cause I'm gonna come come with this again neither will listen to the word souls and his soul is a spirit that ascended into hell and he rolls down and pick up his body he gave him life and set it at the right hand glory and back the Holy Ghost as a covenant there you are don't fall short of this brother was trying to get us don't see somebody fall short of this brother without the baptism of the Holy Spirit hallelujah hallelujah you won't have to worry about getting to Heaven Hallelujah if there's nothing in here Supernatural yeah you can walk there and bump your head against you what if the spirit of God is in here the spirit of God inside was just so what you think about Jesus Christ so you're already judged this as you just of what just you think about Jesus Christ now here I'm coming now here he comes torn ribbon tour to Pieces his soul went to God God blessed him and then his soul returned back listen I'm saying and then his soul return back into the form of the Holy Ghost I'm gonna say it again in his soul what are you saying brother when you received value and the baptism of the holy ghost that comes to into every believer he's Sanctified clean up the Mind clean up the hearts leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there and when the Holy Ghost is given out the same Holy Spirit remember Jesus out of the Grave yeah and that's the Covenant yes the dovetails there and gave the body back to God the spirit came back to the Earth will have to be the same God together amen because you make yourself no basketball [Music] [Music] [Music] such as and there's and there's something and y'all know you can just breathe and calls to God it's your soul in here falling out to the heaven there you are who's that gives you a faith so like we don't let you become the Seed of Abraham you believe that God promised like abrahamas Abraham not at the promises giving praise to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm gonna say it again so when you got the Holy Ghost no matter what you go through you give praise to God hallelujah don't you understand Hallelujah that in your praise he dwells in your praise God it's a praise of his people hallelujah God inhabits juvy the praise of his peace we may make mistakes but nothing can stop this is there is [Music] [Music] yes we are do some I love and I'm looking at this this uh wonderful time the Bible said that Abraham was strong giving praise to God not a weekend but but strong Hallelujah he realized look on his God was God because on did you and that's what you've got to come see you is God age you can say the god of Elijah he is God the god of Isaiah he is God put your name in there [Music] exactly right exactly even Egypt ma'am I had to come recognize you and before we leave out of here immature foreign [Music] hello hello Justified us you knew that this is so weak never sinned in the first place because the Bride of Jesus Christ she made stumble she may fall but she gets up is it hard to get up say oh man it's in her to repent see on that hallelujah look what he says paragraphs man has always tried to save himself but it never has been in the New Testament by any works of Our Own by grace are you saved by God through faith that's the only thing that can save you it's Grace and remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is the truth sister [Music] as if God is out of control being out of control and God will never be out of control but what we need to be what we need to do we need to have a testimony blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah when you begin to praise God like that literally confuses now I don't know about you I trust all of us have the Holy Ghost because if we have the Holy Ghost there is no condemnation hey somebody that's what we fail to see the second new face foreign [Music] [Music] I do there is therefore now yeah no condemnation to them which are in Christ who walk right after the flesh pass along but after the spirit take him out soon let me say it like this there is no reason you should walk out of your house you should go to bed at night because there is no condemnation don't let the devil put that on you the Bible says we have been Justified [Music] [Music] Hallelujah from the law of sinners Hallelujah [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen there's only one way in the world to prove it this is that I've found among Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear say in prayer they are always afraid and when a little sickness strikes they are afraid he's on per minute I wonder sometimes before and now I'm alone with you what I'm trying to do tonight to drive that fear away you truly have the Holy ghosts at the speed of all time fear has no more dimensions [Music] won't you forget in that day of gross Darkness to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ is that right see that's what people are afraid not the anointed till my cup runs over here what God wants me to see hallelujah hallelujah you and I must understand this is God's word it is equity I'm just going to close quickly hallelujah hallelujah the election the devil knows Luciano he tried to make it rough on us but just like God knows them that are his and the devil knows those that are not here [Laughter] no matter what he tries he can go but so far is that right remember the devil said to Jesus Oh job is the way he is still got Hedges hallelujah hallelujah not just around me [Music] there's only been one man there's only been one man on the earth oh like that that knew he was before and that was Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah that was Jesus he said glorify me father when the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world that's your dream on Hallelujah he was the incarnated god he could move back there and know what it was it's seven seconds but our minds are blackened you soon but we were ordained it you know what predestinations the prediction of anything amen that's not skilled milk Hallelujah I believe that stopped you we better go over there just a moment you may not remember according to the Psalms according to Psalms and according to Proverbs it talks about wisdom and it tells us that we were there we were there in all of that wisdom Hallelujah this is not my beginning [Music] Hallelujah glory to God Roger the devil can't stop this job Hallelujah he messed up the devil messed up yeah when he let Jesus raise from the dead and he couldn't stop there foreign [Music] I'm jumping here that's okay so Daisy hallelujah hallelujah coming from in two minutes 57 but when the Son of God died to come back and adopt us into the family of music and now we are children of God the life from them he said the life from the blood the life now let me read this quote now we're going to the next part coming from entombment paragraph 60. he said the law having a shadow a normal he said oh when I think of that the law having a shout out normal the shoes he said look what the law offered why won't you really meditate on this meditate on what I'm saying look what the law offered turn over to the next chapter the 11th chapter of Hebrew he said look what Daniel done under the law look what he not done under the law okay look what Moses done under the law then if he was only living in the shadow of the atonement what ought the Christian Church do today with the reality of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ uh [Music] be sure to bring the best place and the helmet and the shield and all those things Paul liken it to the soldiers when the walls of the enemy comes throw up your Shield go out and meet him he didn't say run from him he said go out and meet him did not give you the Armor he gave you the army so you could fight resistance Hallelujah even on the job you know God gave you that job hello [Music] y'all better hear what I'm saying I don't care what devil it is I know every devil is afraid of Jesus I bet yeah we if God gave you a job I mean God will take it from you you know so let the devil come take it back partly well it must be the Lord's way if you didn't ask him how do you know if you didn't confront God about it the Bible says in all of your ways acknowledge Him He will direct your path did you first we we allow the devil to do things to us without inquiring of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then while we suffering because we did not acknowledge [Music] the Lord he didn't tell you to lead him Hallelujah God help us Lord is this okay and the wise of the enemy comes in through him now if the law could produce that I don't see that the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ the resurrection resurrection and spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ will now we ought to come to church with the highest of reverence we ought to the end of the church like real saints of God walk over them and take our position and keep our minds on Christ we ought to forsake everything of the world comes out and if you're really born again God now just a little bit this may cut now but you know there is a House of Corrections where your heart says what shall we say thee to these things you ought to have joy in your life Hallelujah but you know what Encourage Yourself where nobody called me encourage yourself you don't need nobody to have chance you can have church service at your own house God is there and all you got to do is call on his name call on his name so no how many of y'all been by yourself and you call on the name of Jesus even when John was in prison especially when you feel like you're in a place and let me say it like this God always make a way there's a Red Sea yeah God stepped in the fight hallelujah hallelujah a lot of time we don't see God foreign foreign I've come through a lot of things let me read this quote in closing Israel in the church Israel I'm closing this part of the service we get right into communion um [Music] I want to get on that election strong because it's the truth you did become a Christian coincidence because you become a Christian was that different before you was in this world before you were born God ordained Jews to be a Christian from the Garden of Eden from the foundation of the world oh you say is that right brother that's the truth God before there was ever you know anything there was a time he was the [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I believe thank you I believe they stop you it's like we better go over there just a minute turn over with me to Ephesians now I'm going to say this [Music] worshiping God Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but have you ever seen an old person they get up out of that chair like that he survives you like the cheers and that's a reality Hallelujah sometimes it's because of pain and sometimes it's because the motor can't go no faster oh my God hallelujah ain't God good to us it's time for our communion I love communion we haven't had it in a while about the grace of God we're here tonight and I want to assure you it's revocable and make ourselves we will cleanse ourselves amen physically and spiritually physically I want you to come cleanse yourself there be anything in your life what you haven't made right he confessed those things before God and uh God promised he would forgive you coming from the scripture according to First Corinthians will start at the 11th chapter beginning beginning at the 23rd verse about 23rd yes for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed says and when he had given thanks yeah please take so see this is my body for you
