[1:02:56] if you've got the holy ghost you've got
[1:02:59] the ability to pray

[1:05:30] and your mind open tonight and so all

[1:05:33] stretch to me

[1:05:36] bible i believe it to be the truth

[1:05:42] never
[1:05:43] talked to an angel no how do you know
[1:05:45] they're around because i believe that

[1:05:54] believe it don't you

[1:06:30] heart now i'm going to make you a
[1:06:32] promise

[1:06:42] that got to do with anything

[1:06:46] all right hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 and
[1:06:49] 7 and again when he bringeth in the
[1:06:51] first begotten into the world he saith
[1:06:53] and let all the angels of god worship
[1:06:56] him
[1:06:57] and of the angels he saith who maketh
[1:07:00] his angels
[1:07:01] spirits and his ministers a flame
[1:07:05] of fire i want to read to you out of the
[1:07:07] message called christ is the mystery of
[1:07:09] god revealed and this is um
[1:07:10] just one little quotation here i want to
[1:07:12] draw your attention to
[1:07:14] brahman said so my opinion the first
[1:07:17] thing that he made
[1:07:19] was angels let's pray together over the
[1:07:21] word can we
[1:07:22] with your heads bowed tonight if you'd
[1:07:23] like to be remembered in prayer
[1:07:26] just let it be known by the lifting of
[1:07:27] your hand tonight god bless you my hands
[1:07:29] right up with you
[1:07:30] as we talk to the lord a little while
[1:07:32] father we love you
[1:07:34] lord what a privilege it is to be in
[1:07:36] your presence
[1:07:38] god what great joy we get out of being
[1:07:40] able to assemble together again
[1:07:42] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:45] lord for a little respite of time
[1:07:47] father the church doors were vacant
[1:07:50] lord preachers had to stand at the post
[1:07:53] of duty and bring the message
[1:07:55] with invisible congregations gathered
[1:07:57] around them
[1:07:58] lord for so long it seemed like the
[1:08:00] church
[1:08:01] of the living god for these past few
[1:08:03] months has been completely alone
[1:08:05] but lord jesus as i look into your word
[1:08:08] tonight
[1:08:09] and this text laying before me i am
[1:08:12] sufficiently impressed that we have
[1:08:14] never been alone
[1:08:15] nor will he ever be alone but we walk in
[1:08:18] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:08:20] with a host of angels around us i pray
[1:08:23] father that as we look into the word
[1:08:25] tonight
[1:08:26] that you will come with thy great holy
[1:08:28] spirit that you'll anoint me standing
[1:08:30] here in the feeding place that
[1:08:31] what goes forth from here will be the
[1:08:33] word of god that will not be my idea or
[1:08:36] my
[1:08:36] thoughts or what i may feel or think
[1:08:38] about something but it will be
[1:08:39] the mind of the holy spirit then lord i
[1:08:42] pray that
[1:08:43] not only anoint me but may you go out
[1:08:45] there and anoint this body tonight
[1:08:47] the lord this little handful of people
[1:08:49] gathered in this room tonight
[1:08:51] lord may they be caught beyond this
[1:08:53] place into a heavenly realm
[1:08:55] where the angels of god and the holy
[1:08:57] spirit are dwelling
[1:08:58] lord jesus may we for a period of time
[1:09:01] be able to close our eyes
[1:09:03] to this outside world and open our
[1:09:06] hearts to that which lay before us
[1:09:08] in thy word we pray that you will bless
[1:09:10] it that you will manifest it that you
[1:09:12] will demonstrate it before us
[1:09:14] lord and in our hearts may we be
[1:09:15] receptive of everything you'll do from
[1:09:17] that word
[1:09:18] may the holy spirit fall on every need
[1:09:20] tonight every uplifted hand
[1:09:21] may the holy ghost i pray come now and
[1:09:24] minister to every heart
[1:09:26] whether it be physical emotional
[1:09:27] spiritual lord ever what the need might
[1:09:29] be financially ever what it might be
[1:09:32] may the holy ghost come tonight in the
[1:09:34] name of jesus christ we pray
[1:09:37] in jesus name amen and amen and all the
[1:09:40] saints said amen
[1:09:42] god bless you may be seated may the lord
[1:09:43] bless you real good
[1:09:45] now i don't want you to get nervous
[1:09:46] tonight what i'm going to bring to you
[1:09:48] is
[1:09:49] not going to be something so far-fetched
[1:09:51] that it'll be hard for you to comprehend
[1:09:53] as a matter of fact what i want to speak
[1:09:55] to you on
[1:09:56] and what i want to try to show you out
[1:09:58] of the word of god is something that
[1:10:00] really all of us have been acquainted
[1:10:02] with at some time in our life
[1:10:04] uh even some of the younger ones sitting
[1:10:07] around here tonight i'm sure that
[1:10:08] there'll be
[1:10:09] spots in their life even now that they
[1:10:12] can testify you know that
[1:10:14] the angels of the lord have encamped
[1:10:16] about them
[1:10:17] and have gathered around them indeed and
[1:10:20] i believe that you'll be able to see
[1:10:22] what importance this is to you and i as
[1:10:25] the body of christ and what it means to
[1:10:28] have such characteristics of the holy
[1:10:31] spirit around us as he is
[1:10:32] tonight in this way now one thing i want
[1:10:35] to try to get to you
[1:10:36] and you that's got your pencils and your
[1:10:38] papers i see you got your notes out and
[1:10:40] that's good
[1:10:40] i want you to write something down for
[1:10:42] me and i want you to write these words
[1:10:44] we do not worship
[1:10:48] angels i want you to write that down if
[1:10:49] you got your pencil in your paper
[1:10:51] we do not worship angels but
[1:10:55] we do give credit where credit is due
[1:10:58] now we could say well as a christian
[1:11:01] the bible promised us that he would be
[1:11:03] an ever-present help in the time of
[1:11:05] trouble and that's true
[1:11:07] but when we say that god is with us
[1:11:10] and that god watches over us and that
[1:11:12] god is
[1:11:13] taking care of us i want you to realize
[1:11:16] that brother branham taught us that god
[1:11:18] being omnipotent
[1:11:19] also makes him omniscient which makes
[1:11:21] him omnipresent which means basically to
[1:11:24] make it simple
[1:11:25] is that god dwells but god can't be
[1:11:28] everywhere at the same time
[1:11:30] all the time but because god knows the
[1:11:32] end
[1:11:33] from the beginning and because the holy
[1:11:35] spirit knows
[1:11:36] how to bless at certain times in our
[1:11:39] lives he knows when to show up
[1:11:41] he knows when to stay away he knows when
[1:11:43] to allow us to
[1:11:45] have prayers answered as we sung about a
[1:11:47] moment ago and when to let those prayers
[1:11:49] just linger in space for a while
[1:11:51] and god is so aware of our lives and our
[1:11:54] walk with him that
[1:11:56] nothing goes unnoticed i want you to
[1:11:58] understand that he knew the very
[1:12:00] end from the very beginning he knew what
[1:12:02] was going to take place
[1:12:04] way young before any of us ever even
[1:12:06] begin to think about
[1:12:07] what would take place in life and god
[1:12:10] knowing
[1:12:10] how everything would operate remember
[1:12:13] that the holy spirit
[1:12:14] as brother banham gives it to us in the
[1:12:16] revelation series and also in the seals
[1:12:18] he sets upon the throne of mercy and
[1:12:21] sets there
[1:12:22] and intercedes until every name that is
[1:12:25] under that lamb's book of life or on
[1:12:27] that lamb's book of life
[1:12:28] is splashed under that blood of jesus
[1:12:31] christ and brought to redemption
[1:12:33] so if the holy spirit is there then how
[1:12:35] can he be here and here and here and
[1:12:37] here and here and here will you say god
[1:12:39] is everywhere
[1:12:40] that's true and that's not true which is
[1:12:42] part of what i'm trying to bring to you
[1:12:43] tonight
[1:12:44] that the holy spirit has employed if you
[1:12:47] will
[1:12:48] a host of helpers and assistants
[1:12:51] to be able to carry out the works of god
[1:12:54] and to watch over the elect of god
[1:12:57] even though there are times that the
[1:12:59] holy spirit himself
[1:13:00] may not be felt that he may not be seen
[1:13:03] that he may not
[1:13:04] the presence or the manifestation of god
[1:13:07] may not be visible before us
[1:13:09] but because we are the sons and the
[1:13:12] daughters of god
[1:13:13] there are always present helps around
[1:13:16] the elect of god then you say brother
[1:13:18] ben
[1:13:18] well what about where where jesus said i
[1:13:21] will never leave you i will never
[1:13:22] forsake you yes that's true
[1:13:24] a part of god or the holy ghost lives
[1:13:27] inside of my heart and if i'm born again
[1:13:29] by the holy ghost
[1:13:30] the holy ghost is always there but
[1:13:33] remember
[1:13:33] the presence of the lord or as we would
[1:13:36] say the pillar of fire
[1:13:38] or the very august feeling of the holy
[1:13:40] spirit
[1:13:41] that isn't always around us and
[1:13:43] sometimes
[1:13:44] god himself will have certain
[1:13:46] responsibilities
[1:13:48] delegated out to this angelic community
[1:13:51] where you might be praying and asking
[1:13:53] for a certain thing
[1:13:54] and then maybe rather than the holy
[1:13:56] spirit deliver it himself
[1:13:57] he will send it down to an angel and an
[1:14:00] angel will deliver it to you y'all are
[1:14:02] looking at me like i'm from the planet
[1:14:03] mars or something but
[1:14:04] this is in the bible i'm going to show
[1:14:05] you after a while now i want you to
[1:14:08] think about
[1:14:08] what it means when brother branham said
[1:14:10] the first thing god
[1:14:12] made was angels now we know that in the
[1:14:14] mind of god
[1:14:15] there's this entire plan right
[1:14:17] everything that god's going to do
[1:14:19] he already got he's got it mapped out in
[1:14:21] his mind how that everything's going to
[1:14:22] be orchestrated how you and i
[1:14:24] are going to walk in the very will of
[1:14:26] god and be able to do so
[1:14:29] uh you know in whatever age or time that
[1:14:31] we would come and then we'd be able to
[1:14:33] come right to the spot
[1:14:34] of where god saw us in his mind before
[1:14:37] the foundation of the world no matter if
[1:14:38] you're 30 or 100 or
[1:14:40] like moses you're 80 or ever what you
[1:14:42] are amen whatever god planned for you
[1:14:45] brother keith
[1:14:45] that's what god intends to bring to
[1:14:47] fruition are you with me
[1:14:49] amen are you with me tonight now you
[1:14:51] notice that then the holy spirit then
[1:14:53] if in his mind he had a plan lay down
[1:14:56] then just like any good carpenter
[1:14:59] just like any good strategic planner or
[1:15:02] somebody that's maybe uh gifted at
[1:15:04] making plans
[1:15:06] i i i i probably sometimes in my own
[1:15:10] mind
[1:15:10] i wish the lord would just bless me with
[1:15:12] the gift of planting anybody ever feel
[1:15:14] that way
[1:15:14] but god is a great planter he knows how
[1:15:17] to lay everything out
[1:15:18] just in a certain way let me give an
[1:15:20] example what i mean when he created this
[1:15:22] earth the prophet of god said
[1:15:24] that he created all of the material that
[1:15:27] would be needed to make
[1:15:28] your glorified body i'm not talking
[1:15:30] about your flesh here but your glorified
[1:15:32] body
[1:15:33] and every glorified body of every saint
[1:15:36] of god that will receive a new body
[1:15:38] is already laying in this earth right
[1:15:40] now i don't care what condition she's in
[1:15:42] or how much satan's eden has perverted
[1:15:45] it and pulled out iron ore and pulled
[1:15:47] out gases and cosmic lights and what
[1:15:49] more
[1:15:49] everything that we have need of to make
[1:15:51] a glorified body
[1:15:53] it's already laying right here on this
[1:15:54] earth amen you talk about a new heavens
[1:15:57] and a new earth
[1:15:58] god ain't going to reach out there in
[1:15:59] outer space and create anew
[1:16:01] he is going to renovate and he's going
[1:16:03] to recreate and redesign
[1:16:06] this earth refashion it in the image of
[1:16:09] god of what he had in his mind of a new
[1:16:10] city new earth and he's going to use the
[1:16:12] elements of this earth to do so
[1:16:14] hallelujah it's all laying right here
[1:16:16] already and then brother bannon said
[1:16:18] that if you're a christian and you've
[1:16:20] got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:22] then he said everything that you have
[1:16:24] need of for this life's journey listen
[1:16:26] to me
[1:16:27] even the rapture has already come
[1:16:30] already inside of you when you receive
[1:16:32] the holy ghost
[1:16:34] amen it's already on the inside god is a
[1:16:37] great planner he already laid out
[1:16:38] everything you have need of
[1:16:40] you don't have to reach out here in
[1:16:42] outer space you don't have to wait for
[1:16:43] him to find a new tape in jeffersonville
[1:16:46] or some new preacher to raise up or some
[1:16:48] new sermon series to come forth
[1:16:50] you don't have to wait for a new church
[1:16:52] to rise up or some new evangelist to
[1:16:54] pass by
[1:16:55] everything you have need of is already
[1:16:58] here
[1:16:58] in the form of the holy ghost and the
[1:17:00] revelation of his word
[1:17:02] all i got to do is tap into it if i
[1:17:05] understand how to get in there and reach
[1:17:07] into that revelation and pull it into
[1:17:09] myself
[1:17:09] then i can make something happen oh you
[1:17:12] say we ain't supposed to make anything
[1:17:13] happen i believe the bible said
[1:17:15] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:17:17] and trembling amen we are supposed to
[1:17:19] make something happen
[1:17:20] god didn't lay all of these elements on
[1:17:22] the earth and just let them sit there
[1:17:23] and let them work for themselves
[1:17:25] he put man on this earth to be a teller
[1:17:27] and a keeper of the garden
[1:17:28] amen and then then of god the holy
[1:17:30] spirit then if he has given me all of
[1:17:32] the elements that i need
[1:17:34] amen then it is my responsibility to
[1:17:37] call on and work with what he has laid
[1:17:40] in my lap are you listening to me
[1:17:43] amen and if i don't reach in there and
[1:17:44] get a hold of it it ain't god's fault
[1:17:46] it ain't a preacher's fault it ain't the
[1:17:48] church's fault
[1:17:50] it's mine amen because if he's laid
[1:17:53] everything in my lap then i ought to be
[1:17:54] smart enough to use
[1:17:56] what god's laid in my lap are you with
[1:17:58] me all right now you realize this is one
[1:18:01] reason why
[1:18:01] the bible said then if you don't have it
[1:18:04] it's because you ain't asked for it
[1:18:08] the words amen in case some of you all
[1:18:10] forgot it if i don't
[1:18:12] have something it's not because god
[1:18:13] didn't give it to me already
[1:18:15] it's not because i can't possess it it's
[1:18:18] because i didn't ask for it
[1:18:20] i haven't worked with what god's laid in
[1:18:22] my life it's my responsibility then
[1:18:24] to reach into the promise of god and
[1:18:26] make it work for my life
[1:18:29] amen god can't read my bible for me
[1:18:32] god can't pray for me huh god can't come
[1:18:35] to church for me god can't pull those
[1:18:37] tithings out of my wallet and put them
[1:18:38] in the envelope and
[1:18:40] god can't do that for me i've got to do
[1:18:42] that i've got to work within the
[1:18:44] confines amen you say but that's wrong
[1:18:46] the holy spirit does it all i beg to
[1:18:48] differ brother
[1:18:49] why did he say in the book of james then
[1:18:51] if any be sick
[1:18:52] let him not god but him call for the
[1:18:55] elders of the church and the prayer of a
[1:18:57] righteous man avails much let him anoint
[1:19:00] them with oil
[1:19:01] why there's something for the church to
[1:19:02] do we are co-workers
[1:19:05] with jesus christ amen i am working with
[1:19:08] him
[1:19:09] and he is working with me i feel the
[1:19:11] holy ghost in this place tonight
[1:19:13] amen it's not him doing all the work
[1:19:15] it's not me doing all the work
[1:19:17] but we are fellow laborers together in
[1:19:20] christ jesus i work and he works he
[1:19:22] works and i work
[1:19:23] amen all right then if god has all of
[1:19:26] this laid out then there is a community
[1:19:28] of angels
[1:19:30] that watch over me oh my
[1:19:34] now let's begin to
[1:19:37] dig into this a little bit shall we now
[1:19:39] i'll just go ahead and give you a little
[1:19:40] preview
[1:19:41] i'm going to preach this tonight and
[1:19:43] more likely i'm probably going to preach
[1:19:44] more of it tomorrow
[1:19:46] so if you are bored i dismiss you right
[1:19:48] now
[1:19:50] because you got two more services of
[1:19:51] this to get through tonight and tomorrow
[1:19:53] now but if this will bless you i hope
[1:19:55] you'll hang with me even tomorrow
[1:19:56] morning
[1:19:57] as i try to show you the benefit of how
[1:20:00] how all of this works together
[1:20:01] for the economy of god so let's let's
[1:20:03] dig into what the angels of the lord are
[1:20:05] all about
[1:20:06] now first of all let's look again in
[1:20:08] hebrews chapter 1 there in verse 6.
[1:20:10] now notice that the bible talks about
[1:20:12] the lord jesus he brings the first
[1:20:15] begotten
[1:20:15] into the world how many knows that's the
[1:20:17] lord jesus christ amen he was the only
[1:20:20] begotten son of god or the first
[1:20:22] begotten into this world
[1:20:23] god the jews don't think god has a son
[1:20:26] we've got the revelation he does
[1:20:28] amen god does have a son god did have a
[1:20:31] son
[1:20:32] the son said i and my father are one and
[1:20:34] now the son
[1:20:35] and the father are the same amen it's a
[1:20:38] very simple revelation if you
[1:20:40] allow yourself you yield yourself to the
[1:20:42] understanding of it
[1:20:43] amen god is not two but god is one but
[1:20:46] in order for god to redeem man
[1:20:48] god had to create a virgin born body
[1:20:51] you say virgin born sure and if you can
[1:20:53] explain to me why it was virgin born
[1:20:55] i'll tell you what happened to garden of
[1:20:56] eden
[1:20:58] amen amen if you can understand why it
[1:21:01] was virgin born i'll tell you what
[1:21:02] happened between the serpent and eve one
[1:21:04] day
[1:21:04] amen it was sexual things amen in the
[1:21:07] garden of eden that caused the fault
[1:21:09] therefore
[1:21:10] jesus had to come born above sex
[1:21:13] amen now don't don't don't don't turn
[1:21:15] your set off on me out there
[1:21:16] amen stay a little while now remember
[1:21:19] jesus
[1:21:20] coming to redeem man jesus had to come
[1:21:23] in the nature of humans not in the
[1:21:26] nature of angels
[1:21:27] but he had to come in the nature of a
[1:21:30] man
[1:21:30] watch this then let all the angels of
[1:21:33] god he said
[1:21:34] worship him then all the angels
[1:21:37] he said who maketh his angels spirits
[1:21:40] and
[1:21:40] his ministers a flame of fire so now we
[1:21:44] know that
[1:21:45] of course the lord jesus was then not an
[1:21:47] angel
[1:21:48] but the lord jesus was a human being
[1:21:51] now then that means that the angels of
[1:21:54] god then
[1:21:55] are a part of god's economy but they're
[1:21:58] a different level or a degree
[1:22:00] of the plan of god now we understand
[1:22:02] that the angels of the lord were created
[1:22:04] for one purpose you know what that
[1:22:06] purpose was to serve you
[1:22:10] i know that sounds strange because you
[1:22:12] don't think of yourself
[1:22:13] as being royalty but if you ever get
[1:22:16] that old hog pin mentality out of your
[1:22:18] brain you're going to start getting some
[1:22:19] things with god
[1:22:22] i'm just going to let that soak a few
[1:22:23] minutes
[1:22:25] huh oh glory to god i'm a nobody don't
[1:22:28] you never call the queen of heaven
[1:22:30] nobody.
[1:22:32] amen oh this is your them quiet places
[1:22:35] that's your that's your that's that's
[1:22:36] your turn
[1:22:38] huh oh i'm a nobody don't never call
[1:22:41] that predestinated germ inside your
[1:22:43] heart of nobody
[1:22:44] that part of god that placed it in you
[1:22:46] and i know we look at our flesh and we
[1:22:48] say
[1:22:48] i am scum i am nothing i'm a gut why
[1:22:52] in the world would god fool with such if
[1:22:54] you're a nobody and a nothing then how
[1:22:56] come the holy spirit keeps dealing with
[1:22:58] you
[1:23:00] come on somebody because you're not a
[1:23:02] nobody
[1:23:04] you are a somebody oh my you are a vip
[1:23:08] a very important person y-o-u
[1:23:11] v-i-p that's what you are you are
[1:23:14] important to god
[1:23:17] and i want you to notice that when god
[1:23:18] creates these angels
[1:23:20] their one purpose is to serve the elect
[1:23:25] now we know that the first battle that
[1:23:27] ever took place
[1:23:29] did not take place on the earth
[1:23:33] but actually the first battle between
[1:23:35] good and evil
[1:23:37] took place in heaven between michael
[1:23:41] and lucifer because remember the being
[1:23:44] the creature
[1:23:46] that that that person that we called the
[1:23:49] devil
[1:23:51] was actually an angel created in heaven
[1:23:56] now you say to yourself how in the world
[1:23:58] can people be so deceived by religion
[1:24:01] i'm fixing to tell you if you listen to
[1:24:02] me
[1:24:03] if the devil was in heaven and if the
[1:24:06] devil was created
[1:24:08] to be everything that god was except for
[1:24:10] a creator himself
[1:24:12] don't you think the devil understands
[1:24:14] religious things
[1:24:16] this is why the devil is not a drunk the
[1:24:18] devil don't live in honky tonks
[1:24:20] he resides in religious institutions
[1:24:24] satan is the author of religion
[1:24:27] i notice i didn't say a relationship
[1:24:28] with god i said religion
[1:24:31] and there is a true religion i guarantee
[1:24:32] that's a relationship with the lord
[1:24:34] jesus
[1:24:34] but the devil is the author of many of
[1:24:36] these churches that we see around the
[1:24:38] world today
[1:24:39] sure he is you take these men and women
[1:24:41] that's got this idea that if you want to
[1:24:43] become a
[1:24:44] real authentic christian just walk up
[1:24:45] and shake a preacher's hand what in the
[1:24:47] world does that got to do with being
[1:24:48] born again
[1:24:50] that is not jesus moving inside of your
[1:24:52] heart putting your name on a book
[1:24:55] believing a certain creed in a certain
[1:24:57] dogma
[1:25:01] oh glory to god i'm a christian how do i
[1:25:03] know because if you've been born again
[1:25:05] of the holy spirit
[1:25:06] then you have a birth from heaven that
[1:25:08] sets you apart from the rest of the
[1:25:10] world i am not a christian because
[1:25:13] i pack brother branham's pictures around
[1:25:15] in my house i am not a christian because
[1:25:17] i pack a bible under my arm
[1:25:20] being in a church house doesn't make you
[1:25:21] any more of a christian than being in a
[1:25:23] garage makes you an automobile
[1:25:25] whoa come on preach to me amen to be a
[1:25:28] child of god means you must be
[1:25:30] born again of the holy ghost it must be
[1:25:33] an experience
[1:25:34] deeper than religion deeper than
[1:25:36] churchianity
[1:25:38] deeper than just associating with
[1:25:40] religious people
[1:25:41] it must be an experience with almighty
[1:25:44] god
[1:25:45] you got to meet the man one-on-one
[1:25:48] and you got to come to a place that you
[1:25:50] know him
[1:25:51] and even greater than that he knows you
[1:25:54] because if you don't then you're just
[1:25:56] playing church
[1:25:57] sure and you are a target for the devil
[1:26:01] satan loves those kind of people the
[1:26:04] devil is always looking for some of
[1:26:06] these folks
[1:26:07] that are willing to trade a relationship
[1:26:09] for religion
[1:26:11] and message people are famous for it
[1:26:14] so they are why do you think we got so
[1:26:16] much nonsense running around our ranks
[1:26:18] well be careful brother being you'll
[1:26:20] discourage somebody from the truth that
[1:26:21] they're the seed of god god himself
[1:26:23] couldn't run them away from the truth
[1:26:25] amen i think it's time we start telling
[1:26:27] some truth
[1:26:28] we walk around with our little silver
[1:26:30] spoon in our mouth acting like we're the
[1:26:32] elite of the elite of the elite we ain't
[1:26:34] nothing
[1:26:34] but a 98 cents pound of dirt that needs
[1:26:37] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:39] and a move of revival in our souls
[1:26:44] but i pack a picture of brother adam so
[1:26:46] so to the devil
[1:26:48] oh he can do that kind of stuff sure he
[1:26:49] can it can be religious just like me and
[1:26:51] you i'll ask you a question
[1:26:53] who started preaching to eve first
[1:26:57] so one of the first earthly preachers we
[1:27:00] have is the devil
[1:27:04] yeah hath god said he was preaching to
[1:27:06] her he was taking a text
[1:27:08] and preaching to eve
[1:27:12] he might have not been standing at a
[1:27:13] pulpit like this but he had his own
[1:27:15] platform
[1:27:16] sure he did tried to convince her
[1:27:19] against
[1:27:19] the true nature of what a christian's
[1:27:22] all about and that is having a
[1:27:24] relationship
[1:27:25] with god don't you understand the very
[1:27:27] reason that god told him not to eat of
[1:27:28] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:27:30] was it because god was looking for a
[1:27:31] reason to to hit him over the head with
[1:27:33] a lightning bolt
[1:27:35] a reason to correct him a reason to be
[1:27:37] mean to him
[1:27:39] god told him that because that was the
[1:27:40] conditions for having a relationship
[1:27:43] if you want to serve me in other words
[1:27:45] you've got to these are the parameters
[1:27:47] you've got to work within these
[1:27:49] boundaries if you want to serve me
[1:27:51] you want to love me you want to hear my
[1:27:52] voice you want to walk with me in the
[1:27:54] cold and the cool of the evening rather
[1:27:57] this is the way you got to do it how
[1:28:00] different it was when the devil come
[1:28:02] down
[1:28:02] and begin to talk to her very thing that
[1:28:05] he tried to do was convince her
[1:28:07] that god was hiding something from her
[1:28:11] do i feel the holy ghost now that's the
[1:28:13] way the devil likes to do you and i
[1:28:16] he likes to lead us to believe that
[1:28:19] somehow
[1:28:20] god's quietness is a sign
[1:28:23] of his lack of favor
[1:28:27] lack of concern lack of care
[1:28:31] well i don't feel it i don't see it oh
[1:28:34] in a moment may god like gaza open up
[1:28:36] your eyes to what's really around you
[1:28:38] i'm trying to set a stage for you so you
[1:28:40] can see something
[1:28:41] remind you of reminding you now that the
[1:28:43] devil was the first one to preach
[1:28:46] to angels he had a brightness that was
[1:28:50] greater than all the rest of him
[1:28:51] he had a beauty that was greater than
[1:28:52] all the rest of him he had an ability
[1:28:54] that was greater than all the rest of
[1:28:56] them
[1:28:59] and he began to preach this beautiful
[1:29:00] kingdom gospel we could do a whole lot
[1:29:02] better than michael around here boys
[1:29:04] all we got to do is set this up here and
[1:29:06] have a bishop with a turnaround caller
[1:29:08] and
[1:29:10] get some of the rest of these angels
[1:29:11] over here to form a choir and sing real
[1:29:13] pretty you know we got the best singers
[1:29:15] on our side anyhow
[1:29:18] get some of these boys over here to you
[1:29:20] know run the sound in heaven and
[1:29:23] deacon in heaven and play the music in
[1:29:25] heaven we got a better bunch anyhow we
[1:29:27] can make this thing
[1:29:28] a whole lot more beautiful
[1:29:31] and can you imagine this angels that had
[1:29:33] never smoked
[1:29:34] never cursed never lied never committed
[1:29:37] adultery never had a mean thought
[1:29:40] they listened at what the devil had to
[1:29:42] say
[1:29:43] and gave up their positions in heaven
[1:29:47] over the devil's lie and you thank you
[1:29:50] with your little canary
[1:29:52] brain is going to overcome a being like
[1:29:54] that he has been at the deceiving
[1:29:56] business
[1:29:57] for 6 000 years who do you think it was
[1:30:00] that talk hitler
[1:30:01] into amen and the holocaust who do you
[1:30:04] think
[1:30:04] it was that talked napoleon into
[1:30:07] conquering the world
[1:30:08] who do you think it was that inspired
[1:30:10] alexander the great
[1:30:12] amen you think you're going to wake up
[1:30:13] with a few message quotes in your hands
[1:30:15] and using brother batman's name on your
[1:30:16] lips you're going to get anywhere you
[1:30:18] better have the holy ghost
[1:30:20] you better have greater is he that's in
[1:30:22] you than he that's in the world or
[1:30:23] you're in trouble
[1:30:26] my flesh is a human being by myself i am
[1:30:29] no match for the devil
[1:30:30] come on somebody preach to me i am no
[1:30:33] match and neither are you
[1:30:35] but with jesus on my side i am the
[1:30:38] majority
[1:30:41] amen now notice this
[1:30:44] satan then falling from heaven
[1:30:47] remember this is isaiah 14. how at the
[1:30:50] fallen from heaven o lucifer
[1:30:53] now remember when these angels fall they
[1:30:55] do not lose their gifts
[1:30:59] let's just use numbers to explain this
[1:31:02] if you had say 20
[1:31:03] angels and all 20 angels had a 10 gift
[1:31:06] 10 being one of the highest then you had
[1:31:09] 30 more angels and they were eights
[1:31:11] and then you had 40 more angels and they
[1:31:13] were sixes and fives and ones and so on
[1:31:15] and so
[1:31:16] forth then when those angels fell from
[1:31:18] heaven they lost
[1:31:20] their estate they gave up their real
[1:31:22] estate
[1:31:23] in heaven but when they fell
[1:31:27] they didn't lose their number if they
[1:31:29] were an eight
[1:31:30] they remained an eight if they were a
[1:31:32] six they remained to six if they were a
[1:31:34] five
[1:31:34] they remained a five whatever they was
[1:31:37] they remained that way
[1:31:39] if the lord will help me i'll show you
[1:31:40] tomorrow morning that when the angel
[1:31:42] gabriel comes to see daniel
[1:31:44] remember that gabriel comes from heaven
[1:31:47] to answer the prayers
[1:31:49] of daniel and as that angel gabriel
[1:31:52] descends
[1:31:52] there was an a demon or another fallen
[1:31:55] angel
[1:31:56] that had more power than gabriel
[1:31:59] and gabriel could not overcome him until
[1:32:01] michael come and helped
[1:32:05] amen you see around us
[1:32:10] there's all kinds of activity
[1:32:13] we just don't see it i know this is hard
[1:32:17] maybe for you to fathom but let me give
[1:32:18] you a picture of what it looks like
[1:32:20] as we sit here in iowa there's all kinds
[1:32:23] of activity going on in new york do you
[1:32:25] see it
[1:32:27] how about chicago you saw them boys
[1:32:30] trying to pull down the statues just
[1:32:31] last night i think it was or today
[1:32:33] sometime
[1:32:33] and they had that big raiden and police
[1:32:35] out there throwing that tear gas they
[1:32:36] got that big war because trump told them
[1:32:38] leave them statues and things alone
[1:32:40] remember you see it on the news or read
[1:32:41] it in your
[1:32:42] phone or something there's all kinds of
[1:32:44] things going around
[1:32:45] i read a story today that there's the
[1:32:47] coronavirus is surrounding iran in a way
[1:32:49] they've never saw
[1:32:50] since the beginning surge activity
[1:32:54] is going on around you in this little
[1:32:56] place
[1:32:57] we call earth there are people that woke
[1:33:01] up in china
[1:33:02] and ate breakfast and put their clothes
[1:33:04] on did you all see it
[1:33:07] were y'all aware of it you mean to tell
[1:33:10] me that around you
[1:33:12] there has been multiplied tens of
[1:33:14] thousands
[1:33:15] of actions and behaviors and words
[1:33:18] spoken and emotions traded
[1:33:20] and money spent houses bought and cars
[1:33:23] started up and you didn't even know it
[1:33:27] well how in the world did the world even
[1:33:29] operate without you knowing all that
[1:33:32] oh come on now church so look at me that
[1:33:33] way what it goes to prove to us
[1:33:37] is that just because we don't see it or
[1:33:40] understand it doesn't mean there's not
[1:33:42] activity going on around us
[1:33:45] oh glory to god oh
[1:33:48] thank you jesus you know it's kind of
[1:33:51] like
[1:33:52] in an election they go into a room they
[1:33:55] shut the little curtain behind them or
[1:33:56] they put them off to the side and they
[1:33:57] go and they hit their little buttons and
[1:33:59] they vote for whoever they vote for
[1:34:00] you ain't got no idea whether or not
[1:34:03] that person went in there and done
[1:34:04] jumping jacks made three turns and
[1:34:05] walked out and didn't vote at all you
[1:34:06] don't know
[1:34:09] activity went on and you didn't see it
[1:34:13] i wonder friends if we could stop and be
[1:34:17] spiritual for a moment
[1:34:19] i wonder if we could ever get it placed
[1:34:21] in our minds
[1:34:22] that right now even in some of the most
[1:34:25] trying and difficult
[1:34:26] challenges of your life whether you saw
[1:34:29] it
[1:34:30] whether you didn't see it whether you
[1:34:31] felt it whether you didn't feel it
[1:34:34] there was activity going on around you
[1:34:39] god doing things that you didn't even
[1:34:41] know was possible
[1:34:43] praise be to god praise be to god
[1:34:48] now notice the angels that fell from
[1:34:50] heaven they become what anybody know
[1:34:52] tell me
[1:34:53] demons the very spirits that torments
[1:34:57] you on a daily basis
[1:34:59] they once resided in heaven holy
[1:35:02] holy holy is the lord god almighty
[1:35:07] never smoke never cuss never drank
[1:35:11] never done any of those things and the
[1:35:14] moment they fell
[1:35:16] god kicked him out of heaven
[1:35:19] praise god now let's look here
[1:35:23] notice that angels can take on a nature
[1:35:26] and a human form if you'd like to see
[1:35:28] this let's write down if you if you're
[1:35:30] writing this down or if you're
[1:35:31] looking at it later in genesis chapter
[1:35:33] 19 verse 1.
[1:35:35] notice the bible said there's two angels
[1:35:37] that went to sodom
[1:35:39] and lot sat in the gate of sodom and
[1:35:42] seeing them rose up to meet him
[1:35:44] bowed himself with his face toward the
[1:35:46] ground now brother bram explains to us
[1:35:48] exactly what took place he said he
[1:35:50] reached down grabbed the calcium the pot
[1:35:51] after the elements he went
[1:35:53] and said step in michael michael stepped
[1:35:55] in he went
[1:35:56] step in gabriel gabriel stepped in god
[1:35:58] picked up elements
[1:36:00] and stepped in a body himself now
[1:36:02] because lot was a heathen
[1:36:04] when he saw the two he said my lords
[1:36:08] but abram wasn't a heathen when he saw
[1:36:11] three he said
[1:36:12] my lord because
[1:36:15] heathens believe in more than one god
[1:36:18] amen to believe in more than one god is
[1:36:20] heathenism
[1:36:21] i don't care if you're a indian heathen
[1:36:25] african heathen or an american even
[1:36:28] north american heathen that gets the
[1:36:30] canadians too you see
[1:36:33] huh person that believes in three gods
[1:36:35] trinitarianism
[1:36:37] that's a catholic doctrine that never
[1:36:38] came from the bible
[1:36:40] god is one jesus could never be no
[1:36:44] eternal son
[1:36:44] as the catholics tell us he was born he
[1:36:47] died
[1:36:48] he rose again from the dead god is one
[1:36:52] amen now notice that when abram sees
[1:36:55] these men
[1:36:56] coming down the road hallelujah
[1:36:59] god is standing there embodied in flesh
[1:37:02] but these angels
[1:37:04] are also embodied
[1:37:07] oh praise god notice if you want to see
[1:37:10] a new testament picture of this in
[1:37:11] hebrews chapter 13 verse 2. now you can
[1:37:14] try to turn if you'd like but if you
[1:37:15] can't keep up then write them down at
[1:37:17] least
[1:37:17] watch us now he said be not forgetful to
[1:37:20] entertain strangers
[1:37:23] anybody know where i'm going for thereby
[1:37:26] some have entertained angels
[1:37:30] unawares now you know the way we are as
[1:37:34] holy ghost people as pentecostal type
[1:37:36] people and you know we
[1:37:38] we like the move of the holy spirit if
[1:37:39] we walked outside this church tonight
[1:37:41] and we saw you know a big ufo looking
[1:37:43] thing that comes
[1:37:46] it'd be all over facebook and go viral
[1:37:48] before midnight
[1:37:50] those unidentified flying
[1:37:54] objects and such right aliens from
[1:37:56] another planet some people think
[1:37:58] but i wonder if you know brother said
[1:38:00] the reason those angels come
[1:38:02] they investigate to see the condition of
[1:38:05] the world to report back to god
[1:38:08] what kind of condition the world's in
[1:38:11] god also the bible said that in the days
[1:38:13] of israel
[1:38:14] sent evil angels among the children of
[1:38:18] israel
[1:38:20] for the purpose of testing them
[1:38:23] you all didn't know your bible said that
[1:38:24] huh go look it up he did
[1:38:27] whenever these evil angels come amongst
[1:38:29] the people
[1:38:30] their mission then unawares is to sow
[1:38:33] discord
[1:38:35] but i also wonder if god don't sometimes
[1:38:37] send
[1:38:38] not unidentified flying objects but
[1:38:40] maybe god would send into the church
[1:38:42] house
[1:38:42] unidentified flying visitors
[1:38:47] maybe people that would come in and
[1:38:48] maybe god would allow that
[1:38:50] to be a check to our attitude
[1:38:54] praise the lord to see how we're going
[1:38:56] to treat a stranger
[1:38:57] or how we're going to behave to somebody
[1:39:00] that's not a part of
[1:39:01] our group i hate that expression we
[1:39:04] don't have a group we're a part of a
[1:39:05] collective of heaven
[1:39:07] amen we're christians full of the holy
[1:39:08] ghost we don't have a group or a
[1:39:10] collective or a club
[1:39:12] this ain't no club you're either born
[1:39:13] again or you're out i mean as far as
[1:39:15] children of god go
[1:39:17] right wonder how many times the lord has
[1:39:20] sent people into our lives
[1:39:23] just to check our attitude
[1:39:26] maybe somebody to your job to see how
[1:39:29] you'll react to them
[1:39:31] lord if it gets any quieter in here
[1:39:32] tonight we're going to have to call this
[1:39:33] an unidentified flying methodist church
[1:39:38] now come on now i want you to preach to
[1:39:39] me now i want you to think about what it
[1:39:42] is that you might be looking at
[1:39:43] remember god can send angels unaware
[1:39:48] you wouldn't even know they were here
[1:39:50] some guy just popped in off the street
[1:39:52] where in the world did he come
[1:39:54] from be careful what your gps tells you
[1:39:58] because it may be completely out of this
[1:40:00] or it may not even be registered on the
[1:40:02] gps where they come from
[1:40:04] [Laughter]
[1:40:06] might be a heavenly visitor oh you say
[1:40:09] well how could that be i want you to
[1:40:10] think of the hundreds of testimonies
[1:40:12] you've heard down through your life
[1:40:13] somebody be in the middle of nowhere
[1:40:14] needing gas and somebody just step up
[1:40:16] behind them out of nowhere
[1:40:18] what do you think that is i didn't just
[1:40:19] spook stories that end up
[1:40:21] on unsolved mysteries and those type of
[1:40:23] television shows
[1:40:25] it's the angels of god that encamp about
[1:40:29] the believers
[1:40:31] oh praise the lord now notice again
[1:40:35] in psalm chapter 8 verse 5 speaking of
[1:40:37] jesus again
[1:40:38] made him a little lower than the angels
[1:40:43] now i want you to notice that the
[1:40:44] difference between the angels
[1:40:46] and jesus was as far as the body
[1:40:50] and the bodily way was as an angel can
[1:40:52] be tempted
[1:40:53] in certain ways but an angel has no
[1:40:56] reproductive system
[1:40:57] there are no sex glands in an angel
[1:41:01] there are inhumans i read a study just
[1:41:04] the other day it was a peer-reviewed
[1:41:05] study from doctors and experts and
[1:41:06] people that did this kind of work
[1:41:08] and you remember when the prophet of god
[1:41:10] said for a boy not to kiss a girl on the
[1:41:12] lips because they crossed them sex
[1:41:13] glands
[1:41:14] now critics and different people
[1:41:15] throughout that's read this message they
[1:41:17] say oh it's a bunch of nonsense and
[1:41:19] trash you know what they proved just the
[1:41:20] other day
[1:41:21] they prove it when a man and a woman
[1:41:22] kiss that that those two individuals
[1:41:25] trade dna and up to 40 years later
[1:41:29] they can still find traces of that other
[1:41:32] person's dna in your mouth
[1:41:35] 40 years later don't tell me brother
[1:41:38] brahm didn't know what he was talking
[1:41:39] about
[1:41:40] when he was under that inspiration he
[1:41:41] was he was led by the holy ghost he knew
[1:41:43] what he was talking about
[1:41:45] now notice in matthew chapter 22 verse
[1:41:47] 30 jesus talking about you and i
[1:41:49] that in the resurrection we would
[1:41:51] neither marry
[1:41:52] nor be given in marriage because
[1:41:56] we would be as the angels of god in
[1:41:58] heaven now what does that mean
[1:42:00] it means that we will have no sex clans
[1:42:02] we will have no reproductive organs our
[1:42:04] bodies will be
[1:42:05] changed can you imagine never again
[1:42:08] having a sexual thought never again
[1:42:10] feeling the
[1:42:11] pressure of a sexual temptation all of
[1:42:14] that
[1:42:14] is taken out of your physical person
[1:42:17] you'll be more like the angels of heaven
[1:42:19] however you're not an angel some of
[1:42:22] y'all are trying to act like once now
[1:42:24] but
[1:42:25] put your halo away huh amen
[1:42:29] oh glory to god glory to god brother ben
[1:42:31] i'm a christian
[1:42:32] yeah i know i know you're a christian
[1:42:35] wrapped up in that old nasty good
[1:42:38] god-forsaken body of yours too and i've
[1:42:40] been preaching nearly 30 years i know
[1:42:42] what human beings are made up of
[1:42:44] sludge we're
[1:42:47] we're a walking compost of stuff come on
[1:42:50] don't you look at me that way
[1:42:52] passed down from our great great great
[1:42:54] great great all the way back in our
[1:42:56] generations
[1:42:57] that temper that impatience all
[1:43:01] of that pours right down inside of you
[1:43:06] so you just don't have your your temper
[1:43:07] but you got your great grandpappy's
[1:43:09] temper
[1:43:10] come on now well you got his nose in
[1:43:12] their ears and they're
[1:43:14] why not have all that too but an angel
[1:43:17] does not procreate therefore
[1:43:20] an angel has no progeny
[1:43:24] oh glory in luke chapter 20 verse 36 he
[1:43:27] said neither can they die anymore for
[1:43:29] they are equal
[1:43:31] unto the angels remember jesus now is
[1:43:32] referring to the flesh
[1:43:34] and are the children of god being the
[1:43:37] children of the resurrection that's what
[1:43:38] you and i are
[1:43:40] we are children of the resurrection my
[1:43:43] body is dying
[1:43:44] every day proves that the bigger my bold
[1:43:46] spot gets the more it proves i'm dying
[1:43:50] amen praise the lord you just hang on
[1:43:53] you young boys your day is coming
[1:43:56] thank god you've got the good genetics
[1:43:58] to keep all your hair thank god i've
[1:43:59] been able to keep every hair i've got
[1:44:00] thus far i mean everyone i've got
[1:44:03] not the ones i've lost but the ones of
[1:44:04] god now i want you to notice that the
[1:44:06] angels then
[1:44:07] are on a different category altogether
[1:44:10] so when the angels of god fell
[1:44:12] from heaven they fell and god kicked
[1:44:15] them out and god didn't even shed not
[1:44:17] one tear
[1:44:20] i'd like you to show me one place in the
[1:44:22] bible where god ever looked over the
[1:44:24] banister of heaven when the angels were
[1:44:26] kicked out
[1:44:26] and they become demons that god ever
[1:44:29] shed one tear for him
[1:44:34] but now let's change the scene let's go
[1:44:37] down to the earth
[1:44:39] where adam and eve are dwelling
[1:44:43] and eve gives her womb over to the devil
[1:44:45] for adultery sake
[1:44:46] has an affair with the serpent then she
[1:44:49] lives with her husband
[1:44:50] and in the womb of this woman are two
[1:44:53] seeds
[1:44:55] being conceived and birthed in the forms
[1:44:58] of cain and abel shortly thereafter
[1:45:01] now i want you to know the bible said
[1:45:03] that god did not reserve those angels
[1:45:06] unto anything
[1:45:10] once they fell he said get out
[1:45:15] but the moment that adam steps out from
[1:45:17] behind the word
[1:45:20] god goes running through the garden
[1:45:23] adam adam
[1:45:26] where are you adam do you remember in
[1:45:29] the bible when it said that
[1:45:30] in the days of noah that it repented god
[1:45:33] you know what that word repent means
[1:45:35] it means it grieved god till he cried
[1:45:39] when he looked at his fallen creation it
[1:45:42] actually brought god to tears
[1:45:46] that the man he had created had fallen
[1:45:48] into such a condition
[1:45:51] because you know he didn't preserve
[1:45:54] those angels that fell
[1:45:56] but he's been preserving me time and
[1:45:59] time and time and time
[1:46:02] and time and time and time and time
[1:46:06] again
[1:46:09] and he keeps on preserving me and he's
[1:46:11] going to keep on preserving me
[1:46:14] hallelujah because as his son i may be
[1:46:18] less
[1:46:18] perfect in the term of i can fall a lot
[1:46:21] easier
[1:46:23] i got all these conditions in my human
[1:46:25] body you'll never find an angel that has
[1:46:27] his great great granddaddy as anything
[1:46:31] angels were created in a certain level
[1:46:32] on a certain degree
[1:46:34] as we say a certain playing field if it
[1:46:37] was just
[1:46:37] my battles if it was just that then i
[1:46:41] might be you know might have an easier
[1:46:42] life to live but you realize
[1:46:44] you're not just fighting your battles
[1:46:46] you are fighting
[1:46:47] 6 000 years of your heritage
[1:46:52] of your genetics of the irish and the
[1:46:55] african and the
[1:46:57] come on you're fighting all of them
[1:47:00] generations before you
[1:47:01] all of that has been dumped into your
[1:47:04] lap
[1:47:05] you're not just fighting your own temper
[1:47:07] you're fighting 12 generations of it
[1:47:10] don't you see friends while the last day
[1:47:12] abroad is going to have to be a greater
[1:47:14] overcomer than any other group on the
[1:47:15] face of this earth
[1:47:17] amen the angels don't have such battles
[1:47:22] a human needs to sleep an angel has
[1:47:25] never slept
[1:47:27] never
[1:47:31] we have to eat some of us like to keep
[1:47:34] on eating
[1:47:37] we enjoy eating which i used to feel bad
[1:47:40] about that until i realized one day
[1:47:41] that's
[1:47:42] that's the blessed thing about being
[1:47:43] created a human even in heaven i'm going
[1:47:45] to be allowed to eat
[1:47:48] some of y'all ain't moved all night but
[1:47:49] you started moving on that one
[1:47:52] i am allowed to enjoy eating
[1:47:55] sure an angel ain't never had to stop
[1:47:57] and say uh
[1:47:59] hey boys when we're having lunch around
[1:48:01] here i'm hungry starved to death
[1:48:04] you realize that's what makes the devil
[1:48:05] such a powerful adversary the devil has
[1:48:08] never taken a vacation
[1:48:11] even while you're asleep he's pounding
[1:48:14] away at some sort of plan or some little
[1:48:16] scheme
[1:48:18] waiting for you to reach that spot are
[1:48:20] you with me
[1:48:21] the word that he can catch you when
[1:48:23] you're either weak or tired or hungry or
[1:48:25] some other kind of thing catch you in
[1:48:27] your weakness and then
[1:48:28] pounce on you makes a big difference
[1:48:32] between humans and the rest and angels
[1:48:36] an angel has never felt what it means to
[1:48:39] be pressured
[1:48:44] by worldly goods remember ladies see is
[1:48:48] a day of
[1:48:48] everybody having everything that's what
[1:48:51] makes the church so lazy
[1:48:52] we've had too much good singing good
[1:48:55] preaching
[1:48:56] soft pews nice climate makes us
[1:49:00] lazy we really don't respect what we
[1:49:02] have
[1:49:03] not like we should well friends come on
[1:49:06] be honest with me
[1:49:07] we don't respect our bibles nearly like
[1:49:08] we should we make coffee coasters out
[1:49:10] and all kinds of things
[1:49:12] the bible ain't no coffee coaster
[1:49:13] respect that book
[1:49:15] men's blood have been shed to give you
[1:49:16] that book
[1:49:18] right it's the infallible word of god
[1:49:21] this is god's quote book
[1:49:26] an angel has never had to stop
[1:49:30] and get a drink of water because he's
[1:49:32] thirsty
[1:49:36] the difference between us and them
[1:49:39] our frailties oh it looks like it would
[1:49:42] almost be pathetic
[1:49:45] notice again in hebrews chapter 2 verse
[1:49:47] 16 he said about jesus again
[1:49:49] he took not on the nature of angels but
[1:49:51] he took on him
[1:49:52] the seed of abraham
[1:49:55] now notice again that angels do not have
[1:49:57] infinite knowledge
[1:49:59] in mark chapter 13 verse 32 but of that
[1:50:02] day and that hour knoweth no man
[1:50:05] no not the angels which are in heaven
[1:50:08] neither the son but the father
[1:50:10] so the angels do not know the moment of
[1:50:12] the rapture amen
[1:50:14] even right now they don't know it
[1:50:17] in revelation chapter eight verse one
[1:50:19] when he opened up the seventh seal there
[1:50:20] was silence in heaven
[1:50:22] about the space of a half an hour you
[1:50:24] know why there was silence
[1:50:26] he tells us right here christ the
[1:50:27] mystery he said because the secret
[1:50:30] nobody knew nothing about it not even
[1:50:33] the angels
[1:50:34] understood it so when the mystery of god
[1:50:37] broke open to the bride
[1:50:39] all of heaven went completely mute
[1:50:45] they had never heard nothing like that
[1:50:47] before
[1:50:49] glory to god hallelujah
[1:50:54] notice in matthew 24 36 again in the day
[1:50:56] and the hour no man no
[1:50:57] not the angels of heaven
[1:51:03] so they don't have infinite knowledge
[1:51:04] and so if the devil
[1:51:06] was an angel at one time then then that
[1:51:09] means
[1:51:10] the devil doesn't have infinite
[1:51:12] knowledge about me
[1:51:14] as he tries to make you believe he does
[1:51:18] he tries to make you believe he knows
[1:51:19] everything about you
[1:51:22] hello well don't the devil try to come
[1:51:26] to you and try to act like he knows the
[1:51:27] very desires and secrets of your heart
[1:51:29] don't he try to play you
[1:51:31] like he knows more about you than god
[1:51:33] does
[1:51:34] you know it's the same thing he done to
[1:51:36] eve yeah if god said
[1:51:38] where in the world did he get more
[1:51:39] knowledge in god
[1:51:41] how does the devil know what god's
[1:51:42] thinking god didn't even reveal that to
[1:51:44] man much less than anybody else
[1:51:48] praise the lord now notice again in
[1:51:51] first peter chapter 1 verse 12.
[1:51:53] now let's let's turn if you've got your
[1:51:54] bibles first peter chapter 1 verse 12.
[1:51:57] now i want you to i want you to notice
[1:51:58] this i love this
[1:52:02] i hear simon peter is talking about how
[1:52:04] the angels of the lord
[1:52:07] the ministers of the gospel then was
[1:52:08] preaching of course and then he says the
[1:52:10] angels of the lord
[1:52:12] did this certain action when these men
[1:52:14] of god preach watch us unto whom it was
[1:52:16] revealed first peter 1 12
[1:52:18] not not of themselves so about the
[1:52:20] disciples now but unto us they did
[1:52:22] minister the things
[1:52:23] which are now reported unto you by them
[1:52:26] that have preached the gospel unto you
[1:52:28] with the holy ghost sent down from
[1:52:30] heaven that's always the best way to
[1:52:31] hear preaching
[1:52:34] you know these guys that come around
[1:52:36] they preach are good talkers but they
[1:52:38] ain't got no real revelation ain't got
[1:52:39] no anointing
[1:52:41] you know power points and all of this
[1:52:43] listen i got nothing wrong with the
[1:52:45] powerpoint but bring your power with
[1:52:46] your point please
[1:52:49] all right intellectual talks is not how
[1:52:53] the message was delivered
[1:52:56] it was delivered with the holy ghost
[1:52:58] from heaven
[1:52:59] oh i i'm going to show you something in
[1:53:01] a minute amen keep your socks on
[1:53:04] oh oh watch us now
[1:53:07] by them that preached the gospel unto
[1:53:09] you with the holy ghost sent down from
[1:53:11] heaven
[1:53:12] which things the angels desire to
[1:53:15] look into
[1:53:20] this word look means to stoop
[1:53:23] down to bend the head and the body
[1:53:28] to investigate or become acquainted
[1:53:32] with something
[1:53:35] amen so the day you got saved
[1:53:40] because the angels do not understand
[1:53:43] redemption
[1:53:44] nor can they understand redemption once
[1:53:48] an angel falls they're done
[1:53:52] the day you come to the altar and the
[1:53:55] holy ghost wonderfully and beautifully
[1:53:57] delivered you
[1:53:59] the angels of god which had followed you
[1:54:01] all the days of your life remember i'll
[1:54:03] read to you in a moment
[1:54:04] jesus said there is an angel that
[1:54:05] beholds my father's face for every
[1:54:07] single one of you
[1:54:09] i don't care who they are the minute
[1:54:10] that person takes the breath of life
[1:54:12] there is an angel of god commissioned to
[1:54:14] watch over them the day they take the
[1:54:15] breath of life
[1:54:17] that's scripture hitler had an angel of
[1:54:20] god watch after him
[1:54:23] oh he said that's crazy no it's not god
[1:54:25] is an
[1:54:26] equal opportunist savior
[1:54:29] he gives everybody a chance to get saved
[1:54:32] now once that person comes to the age of
[1:54:34] accountability
[1:54:35] and then they turn away god well then
[1:54:38] they turn away the angel that watches
[1:54:40] over them
[1:54:42] you reject your own protection when you
[1:54:44] reject heavenly things
[1:54:45] and you reject god you reject heavenly
[1:54:47] things and everything that goes with god
[1:54:49] amen
[1:54:50] that's why you hear stories of people
[1:54:51] that don't even serve the lord today can
[1:54:53] point back to earlier times in their
[1:54:54] life
[1:54:55] where the holy ghost would intervene and
[1:54:56] things would take place and they'd be
[1:54:58] saved
[1:54:58] and and and delivered from certain
[1:55:01] things maybe maybe
[1:55:02] death was coming their way and they'd be
[1:55:04] saved from it
[1:55:05] oh i knew at one time something took
[1:55:07] place of course you did
[1:55:08] because the angels of the lord watched
[1:55:10] after you to give you a chance
[1:55:13] to get right with god reject god you
[1:55:16] reject the angel and everything else
[1:55:18] that comes with it
[1:55:21] elvis had such in his life don't forget
[1:55:23] that elvis presley was a twin
[1:55:29] and brother adam said whenever you were
[1:55:30] getting ready to be born there was an
[1:55:32] angelic presence that got close to your
[1:55:36] mother that made her real sweet
[1:55:38] oh i know that's your little body your
[1:55:40] little spiritual being coming into that
[1:55:42] thing but don't kid yourself that's also
[1:55:43] the presence of that angel of the lord
[1:55:45] seeing you through to birth
[1:55:50] making sure that the other presley twin
[1:55:52] lived
[1:55:54] because he had a role to play
[1:55:57] oh my god well y'all ain't got an a-man
[1:56:01] cd made up in here do you and then
[1:56:03] i can cue you and get his a-man's going
[1:56:06] i may need it before this thing's over
[1:56:07] with come on now stay with me
[1:56:11] now notice oh my that the angel of the
[1:56:14] lord that watched over you all your life
[1:56:16] they watched you when you ran and drank
[1:56:17] and cussed and
[1:56:20] that's right but now here you are at the
[1:56:21] older getting ready to get saved
[1:56:24] they see the holy ghost fall on you in a
[1:56:26] way that you can't even explain it
[1:56:28] yourself
[1:56:30] and the angels the bible said the angels
[1:56:32] of god
[1:56:34] bent over stooped
[1:56:38] what is happening
[1:56:42] is taking place why does our faces look
[1:56:46] that way
[1:56:46] we'll never understand it oh no they
[1:56:49] can't
[1:56:51] because we who are born again and have
[1:56:54] been saved by the blood of jesus christ
[1:56:56] we understand what the touch of
[1:56:58] redemption looks like
[1:57:00] whereas they will never understand what
[1:57:02] it looks like
[1:57:05] my now listen to this angels of god are
[1:57:08] servants to the elect you remember me
[1:57:09] telling you that let's turn to matthew
[1:57:11] chapter 4 verse 11.
[1:57:13] don't worry i'm only going to keep you
[1:57:14] two more hours don't get nervous
[1:57:19] some of y'all didn't even respond i'm
[1:57:20] just trying to catch you sleep it's what
[1:57:22] i'm trying to do wake up wake up
[1:57:26] amen i'm just teasing now watch that
[1:57:27] matthew chapter 4 verse 11.
[1:57:29] now now watch here's jesus in a fight
[1:57:32] with the devil
[1:57:32] right now after the devil
[1:57:37] has hit jesus with everything he can
[1:57:40] he's failing but remember jesus is tired
[1:57:44] he is tired he is weak he is hungry
[1:57:48] he has been tempted with the world i'm
[1:57:51] not just talking
[1:57:52] about a corner of it satan said fall
[1:57:54] down i'll give you the kingdoms of this
[1:57:55] world
[1:57:56] he had the ability to do it y'all
[1:58:00] all he had to do was move on this nation
[1:58:03] and that nation remember the prophet of
[1:58:04] god tells us in a message called
[1:58:06] in sierra vista called victor day he
[1:58:08] said that really the nations that are
[1:58:10] controlled by the devil he said it's one
[1:58:12] demon that resides over another
[1:58:13] and a nation and a demon resides over
[1:58:16] another nation he said that when wars
[1:58:17] are caused on the earth
[1:58:19] it is because those two demons residing
[1:58:21] on those two nations got jealous of one
[1:58:22] another
[1:58:23] and started a war on the earth
[1:58:26] don't ever think that trump controls
[1:58:28] this nation or any other president
[1:58:30] the devil controls the united states
[1:58:34] oh you say you know you don't sound much
[1:58:36] like a patriot i got news for you
[1:58:38] i'm american from the top of my head to
[1:58:40] my soul or the soul of my feet
[1:58:43] i was born in this country i respect
[1:58:45] this country
[1:58:46] i will stand by this country right or
[1:58:48] wrong as an american
[1:58:51] just like you be loyal to your family or
[1:58:53] your nation i'd be loyal to this country
[1:58:55] until they cross the word of god and
[1:58:57] then i'm not loyal to them no more
[1:59:02] where they do right i'll amend them
[1:59:04] where they don't i stay with the bible
[1:59:08] and the bible said not canada
[1:59:12] not ireland not new zealand he said this
[1:59:15] nation
[1:59:16] would make an image unto the beast in
[1:59:18] the last day
[1:59:20] yes sir she's been sowed up by the devil
[1:59:22] already
[1:59:24] no don't you don't you never put hope
[1:59:26] and and this
[1:59:27] make america great again oh they will
[1:59:30] one day
[1:59:31] sure they will when the antichrist steps
[1:59:33] down he'll make manufacturing and
[1:59:35] everything to prosper
[1:59:37] you all think that this chaos we're
[1:59:38] seeing around us is a precursor to the
[1:59:40] tribulation you need to read your bible
[1:59:42] because the bible said before the
[1:59:44] rapture would come they wouldn't be
[1:59:45] crying chaos chaos and then sudden
[1:59:47] beasts
[1:59:48] they'd be crying peace peace and then
[1:59:51] sudden destruction would fall on them
[1:59:53] remember jesus comes in a dare an hour
[1:59:56] when nobody is looking for him amen
[1:59:58] everybody's wanting to be religious
[1:59:59] right now
[2:00:01] don't kid yourself this is nothing at
[2:00:03] all like what we've been prophesied to
[2:00:05] see
[2:00:07] god has released this virus on this
[2:00:09] earth he has a purpose behind it
[2:00:10] there is a reason the nations have been
[2:00:12] shook up
[2:00:14] it could be everything from a social
[2:00:16] experiment to communism to romanism we
[2:00:18] don't know what's behind it or it could
[2:00:19] be just a simple germ making everybody
[2:00:21] sick
[2:00:23] this is not what we are looking for the
[2:00:25] devil is not trying to deceive us
[2:00:27] by the coronavirus satan's already got
[2:00:31] many of them to see with the greatest
[2:00:32] virus he could ever have him plagued
[2:00:34] with that's unbelief in the word of god
[2:00:36] message people in all have fallen prey
[2:00:38] to it
[2:00:40] amen they needed an inoculation from
[2:00:42] calvary
[2:00:43] amen they did a blood transfusion by the
[2:00:45] holy ghost and then to heal
[2:00:47] our soul of unbelief against the word of
[2:00:52] god
[2:00:54] and yet satan is so in charge of
[2:00:57] everything
[2:01:00] he tells jesus fall down worship me
[2:01:05] and i'll give you all of it
[2:01:09] and jesus had enough understanding about
[2:01:11] his bible to know that one day he would
[2:01:12] fall heir to it anyways
[2:01:15] he wasn't about to take the devil's easy
[2:01:17] way out
[2:01:20] thank you lord for that thank you for
[2:01:23] being that kind of man
[2:01:25] thank you for being a man's man jesus
[2:01:29] oh thank you lord i don't know if i'd
[2:01:31] have been brave enough
[2:01:33] i don't know if i'd have been strong
[2:01:34] enough i don't know if i'd have had the
[2:01:36] willpower the ability thank god he did
[2:01:40] now watch here in matthew chapter 4
[2:01:42] verse 11 then the devil leaveth him
[2:01:45] that's a pretty good thing ain't it
[2:01:48] and behold angels came and
[2:01:52] what what
[2:01:57] ministered unto him
[2:02:00] oh so this was not just an old testament
[2:02:03] thing
[2:02:07] but the angels of the lord were
[2:02:08] commissioned to watch over jesus
[2:02:12] and minister unto him would you all like
[2:02:14] to know the meaning of this word
[2:02:16] i like to shout at what little shoe
[2:02:18] heels i wear off when i found this
[2:02:19] sister bruce
[2:02:21] but the word here that he uses for
[2:02:23] ministers diaconio which is in the greek
[2:02:25] to mean
[2:02:26] to wait at a table to offer food
[2:02:30] and drink at a table
[2:02:34] so glory to god so in other words these
[2:02:38] angels of god
[2:02:40] are like when you walk into a restaurant
[2:02:42] y'all
[2:02:44] and a waiter comes up and says hello my
[2:02:46] name is darren i'm here to take your
[2:02:47] order
[2:02:52] so these angels were created to serve
[2:02:55] you and i want to ask you a question
[2:02:58] if you're sitting there in the
[2:02:58] restaurant and you ain't had no drink in
[2:03:00] about 30 minutes
[2:03:02] are you gonna sit back here in the
[2:03:03] corner and say well hi
[2:03:05] they're just busy i guess if you're like
[2:03:07] most americans and most human beings
[2:03:09] you're going your blood pressure is
[2:03:10] going to shoot 200 over 445.
[2:03:13] hey amen you're going to jump up from
[2:03:14] there you're going to finger yourself
[2:03:16] around to anybody that'll listen
[2:03:18] and say get out of here i want more to
[2:03:20] drink well brother
[2:03:21] if that be the case then why don't we
[2:03:24] call for the angels of god
[2:03:26] when we're low on the holy ghost when
[2:03:28] we're low on joy
[2:03:30] when we're low on peace when we're low
[2:03:32] on victory
[2:03:33] why don't we call for the angels of the
[2:03:36] lord
[2:03:38] come and bring me a refill
[2:03:46] all of these helpers have been set
[2:03:49] to serve at your need
[2:03:52] they serve at the pleasure of the queen
[2:03:55] of heaven
[2:03:56] all right and yet we
[2:03:59] sit around like we don't have anybody to
[2:04:01] help us at all
[2:04:03] that's not true they've been
[2:04:06] commissioned to watch over us
[2:04:09] oh my listen to this rhythm says an
[2:04:11] angel of the lord he said
[2:04:12] my said we unworthy mortals have been
[2:04:14] brought to be sons and daughters of god.
[2:04:17] oh i get to shouting he says notice in
[2:04:20] that realm where angels can't even come
[2:04:21] you say angels yes sir
[2:04:23] but we are sons and daughters of god
[2:04:25] angels are servants
[2:04:26] amen the servant cannot go where the son
[2:04:29] and daughter can go
[2:04:31] the servant cannot enter into that
[2:04:36] relationship
[2:04:40] but i can
[2:04:43] with all of my sludge
[2:04:51] i can become
[2:04:55] one with the lord jesus christ
[2:05:01] where angels can only worship him and
[2:05:04] angels can only serve
[2:05:06] him i can have
[2:05:09] a relationship with him
[2:05:12] friends don't you understand what the
[2:05:14] world
[2:05:16] has tried to project to you
[2:05:19] even in their advertisements they're
[2:05:21] trying the world tries to get you
[2:05:23] to live like an angel with all these
[2:05:26] great powers of god
[2:05:28] you realize in world war one now this is
[2:05:31] just plain old bible in the book of
[2:05:32] revelation
[2:05:34] that there were the angels of the lord
[2:05:35] that was empowered and authorized by god
[2:05:38] to hold back the winds of war that's the
[2:05:40] four winds of the earth
[2:05:42] and on the 11th day at the 11th month
[2:05:45] and the 11th hour and the 11th week
[2:05:48] eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven
[2:05:51] second eleven minute ever what it was
[2:05:54] brother madam said that the entire world
[2:05:56] would have fallen to
[2:05:58] the it would have been completely wiped
[2:06:00] off altogether
[2:06:02] armageddon would have set out but the
[2:06:05] angels of god that had the four winds of
[2:06:07] the world
[2:06:08] and the four winds of war stepped out
[2:06:12] on the 11th month the 11th day and the
[2:06:15] eleventh hour
[2:06:16] and said stop
[2:06:19] and war one came to a mysterious cease
[2:06:24] and nobody understands what happened
[2:06:27] it was the power and the authority of
[2:06:30] them angels of god
[2:06:32] don't you understand the world tries to
[2:06:34] place in your hands
[2:06:36] through education through science the
[2:06:38] religion
[2:06:39] power
[2:06:42] but listen to me very very carefully
[2:06:46] i don't care how much power you attain
[2:06:50] if you miss that relationship you have
[2:06:53] nothing i said nothing amen
[2:07:01] paul even said so in first corinthians
[2:07:02] 13 though i have all knowledge all
[2:07:04] mysteries all gifts all this
[2:07:06] all that if i don't have love that's a
[2:07:08] relationship
[2:07:10] amen come on somebody if i don't have a
[2:07:12] relationship with god
[2:07:14] it means absolutely nothing
[2:07:17] i was telling my wife coming up the road
[2:07:19] you realize that's why people are the
[2:07:21] way they are
[2:07:23] society ladies has pushed women that's
[2:07:26] all you sisters for
[2:07:27] just a moment women and general not
[2:07:28] sisters so much but women
[2:07:30] has pushed women into a place of
[2:07:32] authority that they've never been called
[2:07:33] of god to be in
[2:07:38] and because they're not gifted nor do
[2:07:40] they have the ability to rule
[2:07:42] they have to harden themselves steal
[2:07:44] themself
[2:07:45] use education use prowess use psychology
[2:07:50] sink to the depths of every old ungodly
[2:07:52] underhanded
[2:07:53] method and sneaky trick
[2:07:58] when they should be at home taking care
[2:07:59] of a family
[2:08:01] sure working that's all right i'm not
[2:08:03] against a woman working but my god
[2:08:06] when she fell in the garden of eden the
[2:08:07] bible said he would be her head not the
[2:08:09] other way around
[2:08:10] i don't believe she should be no doormat
[2:08:12] either but there is an imagery that a
[2:08:14] woman should keep but ladies here says
[2:08:16] no you go out there and take your rights
[2:08:20] uh-huh what's it done pushes him into
[2:08:22] positions of great power that they don't
[2:08:24] belong in
[2:08:25] and they make a mess out of it same
[2:08:27] thing with men oh here comes your term
[2:08:29] brother just hang on
[2:08:30] amen when some men should not be
[2:08:34] authoritarians maybe just little simple
[2:08:38] things that maybe don't even have
[2:08:40] should just be raised in their family
[2:08:41] and go on to their job and come at home
[2:08:43] mowing the yard yet they become leaders
[2:08:47] and this and that through education
[2:08:48] science pushing them and elevating them
[2:08:52] into positions they don't belong in
[2:08:54] and what does it cause they have to
[2:08:56] either order to keep that position
[2:08:57] they've got to pull every underhanded
[2:08:59] trick in the book to keep it
[2:09:00] i don't care who they step on who they
[2:09:02] lie about who they cheat on let me tell
[2:09:04] you something
[2:09:04] i have been preaching since i've been a
[2:09:07] boy and i've
[2:09:08] never had to step on nobody to get a
[2:09:10] pulpit
[2:09:11] i've never had to pull an underhanded
[2:09:14] trick
[2:09:14] or play politics to have a ministry
[2:09:17] why i'm called to this so god opens up
[2:09:19] the door and the gift makes room for
[2:09:21] itself
[2:09:23] but what does society do try to treat
[2:09:26] humans like they're angels
[2:09:27] push them into power positions
[2:09:31] that they don't have the character to
[2:09:32] sustain
[2:09:34] amen well hallelujah
[2:09:39] right
[2:09:43] oh you sound very sexist brother ben
[2:09:45] against women well
[2:09:47] i'm not i don't hate women i'm not
[2:09:50] against women
[2:09:51] a matter of fact i think a woman can do
[2:09:53] anything in the bible that a man can do
[2:09:55] except for preach
[2:10:00] sex is sexist that's ladies talking but
[2:10:02] the bible said
[2:10:03] she's not allowed to do it
[2:10:06] and that means on facebook or twitter or
[2:10:10] youtube
[2:10:12] or any other place
[2:10:15] ah but i've got great knowledge you
[2:10:17] might even be smarter than your husband
[2:10:19] but if you've got wisdom not smarts but
[2:10:22] if you've got wisdom you know your place
[2:10:25] and that is to be a support to be a help
[2:10:28] mate
[2:10:30] oh god ain't none of y'all brought
[2:10:31] rotten tomatoes or rocks or daggers or
[2:10:32] something tonight
[2:10:35] what i'm trying to tell you is that if
[2:10:37] we're not careful the world
[2:10:39] system will push us into a mode of
[2:10:41] thinking that god never wanted us to get
[2:10:43] into
[2:10:44] not into all of this political push and
[2:10:46] oh we got to have big houses we got to
[2:10:48] drive fine cars
[2:10:51] and after you get all of that are you
[2:10:53] really happy
[2:10:55] you know there was a study conducted out
[2:10:56] of yale yale university in connecticut
[2:10:59] you know the big famous school ivy
[2:11:01] league
[2:11:03] they did a study on what makes people
[2:11:05] happy they found out
[2:11:06] that a person that began making a lot of
[2:11:08] money was no more happy
[2:11:11] than when they made a little bit of
[2:11:12] money they found out that when a person
[2:11:15] had a car
[2:11:16] a brand new fancy speedster some
[2:11:18] expensive deal
[2:11:20] their happiness lasted about that long
[2:11:24] and if any of y'all ever had a new
[2:11:25] vehicle or you've ever wrote in
[2:11:26] something that was practically new
[2:11:28] the first time you get a scratch on it
[2:11:30] or one of your kids throws an ice cream
[2:11:31] cone on the floor
[2:11:33] there goes your happiness
[2:11:38] they proved now this is science now i'm
[2:11:40] not talking about bible stuff
[2:11:41] i'm not about science they prove that
[2:11:44] what makes a person
[2:11:45] genuinely happy was a bit the ability
[2:11:48] to maintain a good relationship
[2:11:52] with their family with their friends
[2:11:55] people they loved
[2:11:56] and people that love them well if the
[2:11:59] scientists have enough brains to see
[2:12:00] that why don't we as christian as the
[2:12:02] christian church
[2:12:03] have enough brains to see that our
[2:12:05] happiness doesn't come from the degrees
[2:12:07] we attain
[2:12:07] or from the money we make or the jobs we
[2:12:10] make or how fancy our position becomes
[2:12:12] come on now
[2:12:13] but our happiness is based on our
[2:12:16] relationship with god
[2:12:24] career man career woman i want to be a
[2:12:27] career christian
[2:12:29] that's what i'm interested in i want to
[2:12:32] be a career believer
[2:12:34] i want to spend my life trying to
[2:12:36] achieve the top of the pyramid
[2:12:41] and i don't want to stop until i get
[2:12:42] there
[2:12:44] and i'll say it this way i don't care
[2:12:45] how many devils i have to step on
[2:12:50] i don't care how many devils i got to
[2:12:51] cheat to get there notice i didn't say
[2:12:53] christians
[2:12:54] devils
[2:12:57] right but an angel cannot enter into a
[2:13:01] relationship
[2:13:03] notice the thrust of satan's abilities
[2:13:06] i will ascend i will be like the most
[2:13:09] high
[2:13:09] i will build a kingdom i will do this
[2:13:13] isn't that the thrust of the world today
[2:13:16] that they'll tell young people
[2:13:17] and you should get an education sure
[2:13:20] learn how to do something sure please do
[2:13:23] learn how to do something more than just
[2:13:29] learn how to cook learn how to change
[2:13:32] the tire
[2:13:36] oh god some of y'all done went dead on
[2:13:37] me some of the older people don't know
[2:13:39] how to do that dude
[2:13:42] come on learn how to do things that
[2:13:45] matter
[2:13:46] things that build relationships
[2:13:49] right satan said
[2:13:53] i'm going to have the biggest kingdom of
[2:13:54] them all
[2:13:56] and that when all of that is said and
[2:13:58] done you know what the bible said about
[2:13:59] the devil
[2:14:00] that when he is brought before all
[2:14:02] humanity on the day of judgment
[2:14:05] the bible said we will narrow our eyes
[2:14:07] down into him and go
[2:14:09] is this the man
[2:14:14] this is the man that made nations to
[2:14:16] tremble
[2:14:18] so at the end of it after all his pomp
[2:14:20] and circumstance what good did it to him
[2:14:22] anyhow
[2:14:23] but if i'm standing there i've got a
[2:14:25] relationship with god
[2:14:28] i may not have authority i may not have
[2:14:29] smarts i may not have a position i may
[2:14:31] not be in the upper echelon
[2:14:33] but if i've got a relationship with god
[2:14:35] that is all that matters
[2:14:40] praise the lord oh
[2:14:43] listen to this in colossians chapter 2
[2:14:45] verse 18
[2:14:46] let no man begow you of your reward
[2:14:49] reward involuntary humility
[2:14:53] and worshipping of angels
[2:14:57] and we don't worship angels but we do
[2:14:59] give credit where credit is due
[2:15:02] an expectation someone said brother
[2:15:03] madam why don't you give praise to the
[2:15:04] holy spirit and say
[2:15:06] that's the holy spirit he said i had
[2:15:08] said brother i must be truthful
[2:15:12] he said he said he was sent from the
[2:15:14] presence of god he said when he comes
[2:15:16] it don't feel like the holy spirit when
[2:15:17] it comes the holy spirit makes me feel
[2:15:19] happy
[2:15:20] but when that comes it's a very sacred
[2:15:22] august feeling it's different but it's
[2:15:24] sent from god
[2:15:25] now brother branham the ministry of
[2:15:26] angels is back in the old testament
[2:15:28] that's heir that's wrong the holy ghost
[2:15:31] leads the church the man said he said
[2:15:32] that's right
[2:15:33] but there are ministering spirits sent
[2:15:35] from god
[2:15:36] special gifts to do what to do what
[2:15:40] what is the purpose of these men of
[2:15:43] these beings
[2:15:45] to guide us in a relationship
[2:15:49] with god amen
[2:15:55] maybe you've heard this so much maybe it
[2:15:57] doesn't strike your heart like it used
[2:15:59] to
[2:16:00] but friends what a pitiful condition it
[2:16:02] is for us as religious folk
[2:16:04] to come to such a place in our heart to
[2:16:07] where that we seek for anything
[2:16:09] outside of relationship you see it today
[2:16:12] in the world
[2:16:14] listen that people talk they're striving
[2:16:16] for everything else except for a deeper
[2:16:18] walk with god
[2:16:20] at the end of the day brother sister i
[2:16:22] don't care what you do in this life
[2:16:24] nothing matters unless you learn to put
[2:16:26] god first
[2:16:30] don't you realize that's what i'm
[2:16:31] talking about these angels of god with
[2:16:33] all their power all their position
[2:16:34] all their authority it means nothing at
[2:16:37] the end of the day
[2:16:42] he said that makes me happy when he
[2:16:43] comes but when this angel comes
[2:16:46] he said it's solemn it's sacred
[2:16:49] now notice here the greatest battle ever
[2:16:51] fought
[2:16:53] i'll just paraphrase this to keep from
[2:16:55] avoid reading too much tonight
[2:16:56] but notice that he said when a minister
[2:16:59] comes to the platform
[2:17:02] because angels are ministering spirits
[2:17:04] remember
[2:17:05] if they are servants their their their
[2:17:07] responsibility
[2:17:09] is to serve the needs of the body
[2:17:12] so when a minister comes to the platform
[2:17:16] an angel of god comes down
[2:17:19] to bring the anointing upon the gift
[2:17:22] in that man's life now friends i want to
[2:17:25] tell you something i want to share this
[2:17:26] with you and i hope you don't make me
[2:17:27] crazy
[2:17:29] but i i've sang and worshipped and
[2:17:32] you sat at that piano for a lot of years
[2:17:35] and i enjoy the presence of the lord
[2:17:38] i've i've you know i've been involved in
[2:17:40] music and
[2:17:41] and and played instruments for other
[2:17:42] brothers and
[2:17:44] come up to the platform and help pray at
[2:17:46] all their calls and
[2:17:47] worked and took up offerings and done
[2:17:50] all kinds of services in the church
[2:17:54] but for the last 30 years of my life as
[2:17:56] i felt it a few moments ago when i
[2:17:58] stepped up here
[2:17:59] and opened up the bible i felt it again
[2:18:01] and again and again since i've been a
[2:18:03] boy
[2:18:05] i stepped up to the platform and i can
[2:18:08] feel a presence of a being
[2:18:10] fall right in behind me what is that
[2:18:13] that's what brother bam said right here
[2:18:15] the angel of god comes down as a
[2:18:17] ministering spirit
[2:18:18] to minister to the lives of the body
[2:18:21] don't don't you understand friends
[2:18:23] that if you get a preacher or so-called
[2:18:24] preacher in this platform
[2:18:26] and that doesn't accompany his ministry
[2:18:29] don't you realize what you've got you've
[2:18:31] got somebody that knows how to read
[2:18:33] and somebody that may know how to speak
[2:18:36] but nobody that knows how to serve
[2:18:39] what is it about a preacher that god
[2:18:41] will pull him
[2:18:42] off of his notes
[2:18:46] what is that if that angel is your
[2:18:49] waiter
[2:18:50] glory and i've got a stack of notes
[2:18:52] sitting up here
[2:18:54] but you've got a need that ain't laying
[2:18:56] in my notes
[2:18:57] the angel of the lord will bring the
[2:18:59] anointing down that anointing will
[2:19:01] strike that gift
[2:19:02] i will leave those notes to be a
[2:19:05] servant to you why it's not my smarts
[2:19:09] not another man's intellect not our
[2:19:11] ability to read
[2:19:12] it's the angel of the lord
[2:19:16] that's in the camp
[2:19:20] that's why when a man steps behind here
[2:19:24] he better make sure he's met the pillar
[2:19:25] of fire before he does such a thing
[2:19:28] because i have seen it time and time
[2:19:30] again
[2:19:31] because god will represent this office
[2:19:33] up here and because god will honor this
[2:19:35] pulpit
[2:19:36] i've seen men who wasn't called step
[2:19:38] behind this desk
[2:19:39] the angel of the lord come looking for a
[2:19:42] gift to serve
[2:19:43] and because there's no gift there that
[2:19:45] guy get bomb foosled get confused
[2:19:48] stutter around never hardly say nothing
[2:19:51] make a mess out of it and walk away
[2:19:53] defeated
[2:19:55] amen but if a man of god is called
[2:20:00] just like here tonight now you don't
[2:20:02] know it because you don't know what i
[2:20:03] got laying up here
[2:20:04] but about eight different times i've
[2:20:06] left these notes up here
[2:20:08] and i keep veering here and there you
[2:20:10] don't talk about brother troy
[2:20:11] here and here and here and here and here
[2:20:13] you know why because your waiter
[2:20:15] knows that you may need a half more
[2:20:17] glass of this you may need more napkins
[2:20:19] spiritually speaking now you may need
[2:20:21] civil wear
[2:20:22] glory and he will lead the man of god
[2:20:25] anoint the man of god
[2:20:26] following the holy spirit to meet the
[2:20:28] need of the body that's sitting right
[2:20:30] there
[2:20:30] amen that's why
[2:20:34] we need gifted men not just men who know
[2:20:37] how to talk
[2:20:38] but gifted men because when a man is
[2:20:42] truly gifted of god
[2:20:43] the angel of the lord comes to that
[2:20:45] platform to anoint that word
[2:20:47] and if he is a true angel of god he will
[2:20:49] only vindicate and say what the word
[2:20:51] says
[2:20:52] because remember the apostle paul said
[2:20:54] in galatians 1 the we or an angel from
[2:20:56] heaven
[2:20:57] preached anything contrary let that
[2:20:58] angel or that man or whoever be accursed
[2:21:02] so the true angel of god it will always
[2:21:04] say what the word says
[2:21:06] you said brother be it does that make
[2:21:08] you anything yes a child of god
[2:21:10] with an economy of angels around me
[2:21:13] thank you for asking
[2:21:15] [Laughter]
[2:21:17] glory yes it makes us something that
[2:21:20] makes us royalty
[2:21:24] praise god this is why
[2:21:28] song leaders brother branham said for
[2:21:30] you to study just like the preacher does
[2:21:33] why what's the benefit well we just
[2:21:36] throw some song we've sang these songs
[2:21:37] 100 times
[2:21:38] everybody knows them let's just sing
[2:21:39] them that ain't it
[2:21:41] you're looking for the inspiration as
[2:21:43] brother knows
[2:21:45] looking for that little solemn something
[2:21:46] of the holy spirit that leads you these
[2:21:48] are the ones
[2:21:49] and every time you get right in the
[2:21:51] middle of them songs and you think well
[2:21:52] i don't want to sing that one this
[2:21:53] morning but you feel pulled to do it i
[2:21:54] know i've done songs before and how it
[2:21:56] goes
[2:21:57] i mean one time i remember i was getting
[2:21:59] ready to go
[2:22:00] entirely different i had it in my mind
[2:22:02] i'm going to sing that one i am not
[2:22:04] singing that one
[2:22:06] i had somebody come up and they sang a
[2:22:08] special i had it set in my mind
[2:22:10] all right here we go i'm going to sing
[2:22:11] that certain song and you know what i
[2:22:13] did i walked straight up to that
[2:22:14] platform and i sang the other one
[2:22:18] why not because of me the angel of the
[2:22:22] lord that's in the camp
[2:22:24] he knows the needs of the people
[2:22:28] praise god oh let me read you just a
[2:22:31] little bit of this
[2:22:33] he said that's right ministering spirits
[2:22:35] he said
[2:22:36] thy word is always confirmed in heaven
[2:22:39] oh my ministering spirit sent from the
[2:22:42] presence of god
[2:22:43] to be ministers no wonder he said they
[2:22:47] would be
[2:22:48] visited like a flame of fire
[2:22:54] now you think these angels aren't around
[2:22:58] but they're commissioned to watch over
[2:23:00] you
[2:23:03] you remember the story about the man or
[2:23:05] excuse me the two women
[2:23:07] that come before brother branham in the
[2:23:08] prayer line
[2:23:10] the one had a very very serious type of
[2:23:13] stomach trouble and the other one had
[2:23:14] cancer on a tumor hanging off her
[2:23:16] they come before brother branham and
[2:23:18] both of them are in real bad shape
[2:23:20] they both lived in the same neighborhood
[2:23:23] glory
[2:23:25] now remember these angels of god are
[2:23:26] commissioned
[2:23:28] to bring to you everything you have need
[2:23:31] of in genesis chapter 28 12
[2:23:33] the bible said that when jacob dreamed a
[2:23:35] dream he saw a ladder
[2:23:37] and the angels of god ascending and
[2:23:39] descending upon that ladder
[2:23:41] what were they there bringing healing
[2:23:43] joy deliverance all kinds of things to
[2:23:45] the body of christ
[2:23:48] so these two women come up before
[2:23:49] brother branham he says receive your
[2:23:52] healing and go
[2:23:52] on a few days later the lady wakes up
[2:23:55] one had the stomach trouble
[2:23:56] she's feeling hungry she gets up she
[2:23:59] scrambles some eggs
[2:24:01] ate that and tasted pretty good to her
[2:24:03] and she got a cup of coffee and that
[2:24:04] seemed pretty good
[2:24:06] made her up some sausage and some bacon
[2:24:07] and she just kept eating before long she
[2:24:10] realized
[2:24:10] i'm healed my stomach's
[2:24:14] alright i'm healed well she got excited
[2:24:16] about it and she ran down the street to
[2:24:18] go tell her neighbor friend about it who
[2:24:20] was in the prayer line just with that
[2:24:21] same night
[2:24:22] and she was shaking the bed sheet
[2:24:24] looking for that cancer that had fallen
[2:24:25] off her body
[2:24:28] brother badam said what it was the angel
[2:24:31] of the lord
[2:24:32] was passing through that neighborhood
[2:24:35] glory and it brought healing to the one
[2:24:40] and it brought healing to the other
[2:24:42] why they are servants
[2:24:52] i never will forget when i was a boy
[2:24:58] i was bullied quite a bit in school you
[2:25:00] can tell from looking at me i'm not an
[2:25:02] athletic
[2:25:03] i'm a musician you know i never was
[2:25:07] really somebody that did a lot of
[2:25:09] outdoor sports and let me tell you
[2:25:12] something when i played basketball in my
[2:25:13] backyard i was michael jordan i don't
[2:25:15] care what anybody says
[2:25:20] michael jordan that was my era my time
[2:25:24] and i never was you know one of those
[2:25:26] kind of guys like that
[2:25:27] i always stayed indoors and played music
[2:25:29] and things like that
[2:25:32] i was bullied quite a bit in school when
[2:25:33] i was a boy before i was even
[2:25:35] saved i don't mean a christian now
[2:25:37] before i was even saved of course i was
[2:25:39] raised in a message church and
[2:25:41] you know we went through all kinds of
[2:25:42] little things here and there and
[2:25:44] i was sitting at a desk one time in
[2:25:46] school
[2:25:48] really really discouraged upset feeling
[2:25:51] really really down and depressed because
[2:25:53] of how
[2:25:53] you know just just mean kids can be so
[2:25:55] mean
[2:25:58] and i somehow another i just felt my arm
[2:26:01] go
[2:26:02] like that underneath the desk
[2:26:05] and i just you know just kind of went
[2:26:08] with it
[2:26:08] my arm just kind of went like that under
[2:26:10] the desk and i felt a piece of paper
[2:26:12] under there
[2:26:13] i just pulled it out and many of y'all
[2:26:15] may not know this but years ago when i
[2:26:17] was a boy
[2:26:18] they used to have this chewing gum
[2:26:19] called bazooka chewing gum
[2:26:22] you know what bazooka is yeah they had
[2:26:24] that little comic strip wrapped up in
[2:26:25] the bazooka remember
[2:26:27] so them kids they'd pop that gum in
[2:26:28] their mouth and they'd shove that paper
[2:26:30] up underneath that desk
[2:26:31] and they always had like one of them
[2:26:33] chinese fortunes on the bottom of it
[2:26:37] now this sounds ridiculous to you but
[2:26:38] i'm going to tell you what the lord did
[2:26:40] i pulled that little piece of paper i
[2:26:42] remind you i was sitting there i felt my
[2:26:43] arm go
[2:26:45] and i wiggled and i felt that little
[2:26:47] piece of paper and i pulled it out and i
[2:26:48] looked down
[2:26:49] just that very day i've been asking god
[2:26:52] god are you even here are you even
[2:26:54] around me
[2:26:56] is there anything lord are you even
[2:26:57] around and i picked that little piece of
[2:26:59] paper up i looked down at the fortune
[2:27:01] and the fortune said
[2:27:02] quit worrying i've got angels around you
[2:27:10] now you may think brother ben that is
[2:27:12] the most ridiculous thing
[2:27:14] oh it might have been to you but to me
[2:27:16] it was god in a very subtle
[2:27:19] and simple way let me know you have
[2:27:22] never been alone
[2:27:24] and you will never be alone
[2:27:27] let me tell you something little bride
[2:27:29] in your darkest hour
[2:27:31] in your greatest hours of distress with
[2:27:34] all hell is breaking loose around you
[2:27:37] you are never alone
[2:27:40] god has always got somebody
[2:27:44] surrounding you
[2:27:47] to watch over your life
[2:27:54] angels given charge to watch overs
[2:27:56] according to matthew chapter 18
[2:27:58] verse 10.
[2:28:01] jesus said take heed
[2:28:04] that you despise not be one of these
[2:28:06] little ones
[2:28:09] by saying to you that they had in heaven
[2:28:11] they're there ain't there
[2:28:13] they're angels you know what i love
[2:28:17] when you go to number in the devils the
[2:28:20] bible said there are two hundred
[2:28:21] thousand thousand devils i can put a
[2:28:23] number on them
[2:28:24] but when i read in the book of hebrews
[2:28:26] what paul said
[2:28:27] paul said we are caught up in a mount
[2:28:29] zion with an innumerable
[2:28:31] host of angels around us
[2:28:34] i can number the devils but i cannot
[2:28:36] number
[2:28:37] the angels oh glory
[2:28:40] glory to god let me tell you something
[2:28:42] that's what i'm trying to tell you a
[2:28:42] little bride amen it is not what you see
[2:28:45] with your eyes
[2:28:46] but around you every day of your life
[2:28:48] amen remember
[2:28:49] there is more with you than there is
[2:28:52] with him out here in the world
[2:28:54] the wonder the bible says greater is he
[2:28:56] that's in me
[2:28:57] than he that's in the world we're
[2:29:00] surrounded
[2:29:03] we're surrounded my angel
[2:29:11] that gets me wanting to speak different
[2:29:12] languages
[2:29:14] i get to feeling that way i might break
[2:29:16] into french or congolese or some other
[2:29:17] lame someone dialectic
[2:29:20] ah glory
[2:29:23] always behold the face of my father
[2:29:28] which is in heaven psalm 911 speaking of
[2:29:32] jesus
[2:29:33] for he shall give his angels charge over
[2:29:36] thee
[2:29:38] to keep thee in all thy ways did you
[2:29:40] notice when jesus is standing there in
[2:29:42] saint john 1 51
[2:29:44] he said verily i say hereafter you'll
[2:29:45] see the heaven open
[2:29:47] and the angels of god ascending and
[2:29:48] descending upon the son of man
[2:29:50] the very thing that jacob saw in genesis
[2:29:53] 28
[2:29:54] here jesus in saint john 1 is
[2:29:56] identifying them same angels are
[2:29:57] standing right here
[2:30:02] when he was born who was it serenaded
[2:30:05] him into the world
[2:30:07] an angelic choir hosanna to the king
[2:30:12] amen now watch him hear
[2:30:15] in death luke chapter 16 verse 22 notice
[2:30:20] it came to pass that when the beggar
[2:30:22] died
[2:30:23] he was carried by the angels into the
[2:30:25] abraham into abraham's bosom
[2:30:28] the rich man also died and was buried
[2:30:33] notice no angels when the beggar died
[2:30:37] the angels were there to pack him home
[2:30:43] oh god come on somebody
[2:30:46] when the rich man died he died he was
[2:30:49] buried
[2:30:51] there was nobody to pack him why there
[2:30:54] was no longer obligated to serve him
[2:30:56] he'd done
[2:30:56] cross the line between mercy and
[2:30:58] judgment well the bible tells us what
[2:31:00] happened jesus tells him to sell all he
[2:31:02] has
[2:31:02] and come follow he didn't want to do it
[2:31:04] he walked away grieved because he had
[2:31:06] many possessions
[2:31:07] he goes on he gets richer and richer his
[2:31:09] stocks get bigger he gets more of a
[2:31:10] position more of a power
[2:31:12] all of a sudden he gets to the very
[2:31:13] pinnacle of everything he'd worked for
[2:31:15] and god speaks to him and said that's
[2:31:17] not your soul is required of you
[2:31:21] well why would god send angels down to
[2:31:23] entertain a person in death that
[2:31:24] rejected him in life that's right
[2:31:28] amen praise god
[2:31:31] but now notice in luke chapter 24 verse
[2:31:34] 23
[2:31:37] when they found not his body they came
[2:31:39] saying they'd seen a vision of angels
[2:31:42] saying he was alive here's the disciples
[2:31:44] come to the tomb and they see that jesus
[2:31:46] is alive
[2:31:49] well it wasn't old testament only
[2:31:50] because why didn't them disciples say
[2:31:52] hey y'all we don't believe in none of
[2:31:54] y'all that's old testament
[2:31:56] when they saw them angels they believed
[2:31:58] immediately
[2:32:00] who do you all think it was that got
[2:32:01] peter out of prison
[2:32:03] y'all been to walmart where the doors go
[2:32:05] right
[2:32:06] well what do y'all think happened when
[2:32:07] peter was in prison and then saints got
[2:32:09] to praying
[2:32:10] the angel of the lord walked in between
[2:32:12] them soldiers and he come to the door
[2:32:13] and the doors went
[2:32:15] peters walked right out of them things
[2:32:19] the angel of god invented power doors
[2:32:20] way before wally world ever thought of
[2:32:22] it amen
[2:32:25] hallelujah but now watch here even in
[2:32:28] death saint john chapter 20 verse 12.
[2:32:30] let's grab this one
[2:32:32] watch in the death of the lord jesus
[2:32:35] christ
[2:32:36] in the tomb glory
[2:32:39] and seeth two angels
[2:32:42] in white sitting one at the head
[2:32:46] and the other one at the feet where the
[2:32:48] body of jesus had lain
[2:32:50] why do you all reckon they was there
[2:32:53] remember
[2:32:54] psalms said he would keep him in all of
[2:32:56] his ways and also remember david said
[2:32:58] that he would not suffer that body to
[2:33:00] see corruption
[2:33:03] so the angels of god while jesus was in
[2:33:05] hell
[2:33:06] by the way of his soul his theophany but
[2:33:09] down there defeating the devil and
[2:33:10] taking the keys out of the devil's hand
[2:33:13] amen the angels of the lord was watching
[2:33:16] taking guard standing guard
[2:33:18] over the body of jesus christ
[2:33:23] as they proved the other day about
[2:33:24] coronavirus it has tentacles
[2:33:27] and those tentacles reach out and grab
[2:33:28] another part of the virus and that's how
[2:33:30] they go
[2:33:31] i imagine them angels of god stand there
[2:33:32] for coronavirus if one of them roman
[2:33:34] soldiers would have went
[2:33:36] and that coronavirus would have started
[2:33:37] toward the body of the lord jesus
[2:33:38] stretching his tentacles out that angel
[2:33:40] will pull that sort of like cry from
[2:33:41] here
[2:33:43] my one self could corrupt in that human
[2:33:46] body
[2:33:47] so them angels of god even in death
[2:33:53] we're standing right there
[2:33:57] wanted to head one at the foot
[2:34:00] guarding the body of the lord jesus
[2:34:03] christ
[2:34:04] what do you think they do to you
[2:34:07] why do you reckon the prophet said satan
[2:34:09] can't touch you
[2:34:12] until god has done
[2:34:15] oh come on somebody why do you think the
[2:34:19] devil can't touch you he's got a whole
[2:34:21] brigade to get through
[2:34:24] there are angels all around you all the
[2:34:28] time
[2:34:39] angels are witnesses let's go a bit
[2:34:41] further let's pick it in the morning
[2:34:43] watch this in
[2:34:47] luke chapter 12 verse 8 and 9
[2:34:50] also i say unto you whosoever shall
[2:34:52] confess me before men
[2:34:54] him shall the son of man also confess
[2:34:56] before the angels of god
[2:34:59] he that denieth me before men shall be
[2:35:01] denied before the angels
[2:35:03] of god imagine
[2:35:06] the prophet said even in this place this
[2:35:09] heavenly realm
[2:35:11] that when the cry went out in revelation
[2:35:13] 5 how
[2:35:14] is worthy you realize i found brother
[2:35:17] brahman said it the other day i had
[2:35:18] never read this before not that i knew
[2:35:20] of
[2:35:21] brother baby said the angels of god
[2:35:22] could have stepped forward and said i am
[2:35:26] remember angels had never sinned never
[2:35:28] smoked never cursed never drink never
[2:35:30] lied never done nothing
[2:35:31] they could have answered that call who
[2:35:34] is worthy to take the book and loose the
[2:35:36] seals
[2:35:37] angels could have said i'm worthy but
[2:35:40] you know why the prophet of god said
[2:35:42] on top of what i read with that he goes
[2:35:44] on to say the reason the angels of the
[2:35:46] lord didn't say anything
[2:35:48] is because that book didn't belong to
[2:35:52] angels
[2:35:55] they had no possession of the title deed
[2:35:57] they had no claim
[2:36:02] oh come on somebody they had no rights
[2:36:05] to that title deed of redemption
[2:36:07] so the angels never stepped forth to
[2:36:10] claim their worthiness
[2:36:11] because that book did not belong to the
[2:36:13] hand of an angel brother troy
[2:36:15] it belonged to the hands of the
[2:36:21] who believer worthy them angels knew
[2:36:23] better if one of them would have stepped
[2:36:25] out he said stay in your lane girl
[2:36:29] forgive me huh
[2:36:34] well i'm worthy i've never sinned i've
[2:36:36] never smoked yes but you're not a part
[2:36:38] of this redemptive plan either
[2:36:40] as an angel of god their name was not
[2:36:42] placed on this book before the
[2:36:43] foundation of the world
[2:36:46] it's placed on mine and yours was placed
[2:36:48] on there mine and yours was placed on
[2:36:50] there
[2:36:53] but they are witnesses
[2:36:56] interesting isn't it
[2:36:59] that in the very last day before the
[2:37:01] seals was going to come
[2:37:02] open what happens to brother brown
[2:37:07] let's take it in 1962 a message called
[2:37:09] reproach for the cause of the word
[2:37:12] he said there i was sitting i broke into
[2:37:15] a vision
[2:37:16] he said these little birds coming flying
[2:37:18] in a pyramid these doves come flying in
[2:37:20] a pyramid
[2:37:22] and then he said angels of god flying in
[2:37:24] a pyramid
[2:37:26] such a blast he said surely it would be
[2:37:28] the end of my life i came to myself
[2:37:30] standing in the room oh god
[2:37:32] he said nobody could survive the blast
[2:37:34] that come
[2:37:36] i said lord if this means the end of my
[2:37:38] life let that super feeling come and he
[2:37:40] said nothing happened he said but lord
[2:37:41] if this is the visitation
[2:37:43] of the angels of the lord and the
[2:37:44] loosing of the mysteries of god let it
[2:37:45] come to the light to pack him out of the
[2:37:47] room
[2:37:49] amen what was it that preceded the
[2:37:52] opening of the seven seals
[2:37:55] seven angels in the form of a white wig
[2:37:59] one
[2:38:00] descend upon sunset mountain remember
[2:38:04] the angels of god always appear
[2:38:07] when great supernatural things are
[2:38:08] getting ready to take place
[2:38:15] oh praise the lord
[2:38:18] let's read this and let's pick up a pick
[2:38:20] up in the morning presence of the lord
[2:38:22] jesus brother
[2:38:22] says in 55 here he said now there's
[2:38:25] minor angels
[2:38:26] he said perhaps that's the angel that
[2:38:28] comes with us he said that's your humble
[2:38:29] servant
[2:38:31] he said probably a minor angel when
[2:38:32] gabriel comes he said brother
[2:38:33] something's really on the road
[2:38:36] gabriel announced the first coming of
[2:38:37] the lord jesus
[2:38:39] and gabriel will announce the second
[2:38:41] coming
[2:38:43] of the lord jesus well
[2:38:46] you know how pentecost thinks about it
[2:38:48] apostolic and many of these people that
[2:38:50] have a
[2:38:50] wrong conception of the second coming of
[2:38:52] the lord
[2:38:54] planes will be falling out of the
[2:38:55] heavens trains will be derailing cars
[2:38:58] will be turning upside down no drivers
[2:39:00] like the left-behind series with jenkins
[2:39:02] and lahay
[2:39:03] they'll have piles of clothes laying
[2:39:05] everywhere but no bodies in them
[2:39:07] that's hollywood's idea of it
[2:39:11] but do you realize that gabriel could
[2:39:14] have blew his trumpet
[2:39:17] and there have been activity in another
[2:39:19] realm
[2:39:20] and we would have never known by the
[2:39:22] sound of our ear
[2:39:24] what gabriel blew how do we know that
[2:39:27] something's happened
[2:39:28] we see the manifestation of it here on
[2:39:30] the earth
[2:39:32] it tells if something is happening here
[2:39:35] something was happening over there as
[2:39:37] well
[2:39:39] when the seven seal book come open and
[2:39:41] brother brown returns to jeffersonville
[2:39:42] to preach the seven seals
[2:39:44] look at the activity that's taking place
[2:39:46] in heaven
[2:39:47] at the time of that opening of the book
[2:39:49] none of us knew what was happening
[2:39:52] but there he's standing there on the
[2:39:53] breach and he's getting ready to tell us
[2:39:54] about the opening of them seals
[2:39:56] and brethren you can feel it on the tape
[2:39:58] he said maybe i'm just feeling this way
[2:40:00] he said
[2:40:00] but but let let him come
[2:40:03] and take his book you know i was talking
[2:40:05] that way because there was a cry going
[2:40:07] out throughout heaven
[2:40:09] who is worthy who is why are they
[2:40:12] take his book and open up these seven
[2:40:14] seals
[2:40:16] there was activity in another
[2:40:20] realm i'll show you in the morning the
[2:40:23] lord helping us
[2:40:25] these angels of god that are witnesses
[2:40:27] you realize
[2:40:28] that's how they know what's taking place
[2:40:32] in the bride
[2:40:32] you ever wonder how do these preachers
[2:40:34] stay on the same way
[2:40:36] the same wavelength because these angels
[2:40:39] of god are having conferences with daddy
[2:40:43] they know what's being preached in
[2:40:45] kinshasa they know it's being preached
[2:40:46] in roseville
[2:40:47] they know it's being preached in ireland
[2:40:48] new zealand and europe
[2:40:50] in the uk in the united states and
[2:40:52] canada they are you think you're a good
[2:40:54] note taker in church
[2:40:56] y'all ain't nothing compared to them
[2:40:58] angels of the lord
[2:41:01] that's why you should always be mindful
[2:41:02] of your attitude toward the word
[2:41:05] because one of these days if you have to
[2:41:07] stand before god and give an account to
[2:41:09] being a rejecter of it
[2:41:11] you stand there all day long so oh i
[2:41:13] didn't just be careful because the angel
[2:41:15] of the lord will just go through his
[2:41:17] notes
[2:41:20] on certain certain day in july certain
[2:41:23] time
[2:41:24] certain preachers said dust and us and
[2:41:27] lord let me tell you what i observed
[2:41:31] is that true no i preached for you i
[2:41:33] prophesied
[2:41:34] all right roll the tape
[2:41:40] glory to god
[2:41:43] so if they take notes on things to
[2:41:45] report back to god
[2:41:50] i'm never going to get through it i'm
[2:41:51] going to start blubbering
[2:41:54] what do you think they do when you do
[2:41:57] the right thing and nobody sees it
[2:42:02] when you pray and nobody hears you
[2:42:07] when you believe god in the middle of a
[2:42:09] trial and nobody's there to clap you on
[2:42:10] the back
[2:42:13] don't you ever think that the angel of
[2:42:16] the lord is there taking notes
[2:42:19] you know the bible said the bible said
[2:42:21] that when we talk about him
[2:42:23] god keeps a record when we're sitting at
[2:42:25] the restaurant
[2:42:26] and we're talking about the lord god
[2:42:28] keeps a record on such and such day they
[2:42:30] were sharing the word of the lord with
[2:42:32] one another
[2:42:34] the angels of god follow you around
[2:42:37] and take notes oh they take the bad ones
[2:42:39] too but if you don't want the bad ones
[2:42:42] to be held against you there's a way you
[2:42:43] can do that
[2:42:45] he just writes it down oh they got mad
[2:42:47] they lost their temper. lord i'm sorry
[2:42:49] about that
[2:42:51] lifts his pencil over
[2:42:57] but see this type of eraser it erases to
[2:43:00] those never been done in the first place
[2:43:09] you know how it was when you was a kid
[2:43:10] you'd raise something you you shouldn't
[2:43:12] have erased it
[2:43:13] and you'd squint you'll look and hold it
[2:43:14] up to the light i'm going to tell you
[2:43:16] something brother there's not a light
[2:43:17] bright enough to ever call your sins
[2:43:19] back up
[2:43:22] hallelujah
[2:43:25] here stands daniel on the earth
[2:43:29] he is one of the literally
[2:43:33] one of the very few in all of israel
[2:43:36] that still believes god
[2:43:38] he starts praying lord
[2:43:42] reveal to me the end time reveal to me
[2:43:45] what's taking place we'll pick it up in
[2:43:47] the morning
[2:43:48] and there daniel begins bombarding
[2:43:52] heaven
[2:43:53] with his prayers about his people israel
[2:43:56] because imagine this prophet is looking
[2:43:58] out his window
[2:43:59] and watching tens of hundreds of
[2:44:01] thousands of his people
[2:44:03] bowing to his image
[2:44:06] remember it was daniel the prophet that
[2:44:08] they made the image of because daniel
[2:44:10] done great things in the eyes of the
[2:44:11] king and the kingdom set him up as a god
[2:44:14] heathen it's hedonism to serve more than
[2:44:17] one god
[2:44:20] and this little prophet throws his
[2:44:22] windows open and see them israelites
[2:44:24] down their bow
[2:44:25] no doubt it must have gripped his godly
[2:44:27] little heart
[2:44:29] and he probably started crying lord
[2:44:32] what is going to be for the people you
[2:44:33] see that's a real mark of a god-called
[2:44:35] christian
[2:44:36] they sigh and they cry for the
[2:44:38] abominations done amongst their people
[2:44:40] they see that people get in a condition
[2:44:42] i will never understand
[2:44:44] and i realize this is going on record
[2:44:46] and it could go around the world but let
[2:44:47] me bear record and say my heart now
[2:44:49] i'll never understand some of these
[2:44:51] cold-hearted preachers around the
[2:44:53] message
[2:44:53] that will never take a burden or be
[2:44:55] concerned about the direction the people
[2:44:57] of this message are going in
[2:45:00] and then when you preach it or say
[2:45:02] something about it they say don't tell
[2:45:03] the people about it it confuses them
[2:45:05] well who in the world is going to start
[2:45:06] telling the truth so they know what's
[2:45:08] going on around them then
[2:45:11] we put our big spiritual message
[2:45:12] blinders on and pretend like there's
[2:45:14] nothing to see wrong and
[2:45:16] everything and the message is all right
[2:45:17] it's not all right
[2:45:19] our churches are getting deader and
[2:45:21] colder and more stooped at idolatry than
[2:45:23] they've ever been
[2:45:27] and yet our preachers go to conventions
[2:45:29] after convention after convention
[2:45:30] and preach good feel-good sermons and
[2:45:32] talk about the bride's authority
[2:45:34] and where she's at and yet people in
[2:45:36] their veil churches
[2:45:38] don't even have enough victory to pray
[2:45:39] through to god to be able to have the
[2:45:41] victory to last a week from service to
[2:45:43] service
[2:45:46] it ought to do something to us brother
[2:45:48] keith
[2:45:50] like it did daniel when he looked out
[2:45:51] the window that day and saw them
[2:45:53] children bowing down
[2:45:55] it ought to grip our hearts
[2:45:58] when we see people come to church and
[2:46:00] they don't have enough joy to raise
[2:46:01] their hands
[2:46:03] they don't have enough joy to say amen
[2:46:05] they don't have enough joy to worship
[2:46:07] and when they do worship you can see
[2:46:09] them they're so under bondage
[2:46:11] they're just fighting through and
[2:46:12] they're just going through the motions
[2:46:13] and
[2:46:14] they'll raise their hands or they'll
[2:46:15] clap their hands but it doesn't really
[2:46:17] have that certain something behind it
[2:46:19] that shows that they're really free they
[2:46:21] can sing i'm so glad jesus set me free
[2:46:23] but they don't even know
[2:46:25] what the taste of freedom is like it
[2:46:27] grips the heart
[2:46:29] of any true child of god to look at our
[2:46:31] people
[2:46:32] and say what is going on
[2:46:38] when you call an altar call and people
[2:46:39] are too prestigious and
[2:46:41] righteous and self-righteous they don't
[2:46:43] want to come down here and pray
[2:46:45] they don't want to have somebody lay
[2:46:46] hands on them and ask them for help
[2:46:48] we're message people
[2:46:52] i wonder on that day what the angels of
[2:46:55] the lord are going to have to say about
[2:46:56] our many attitudes
[2:46:59] but daniel looked out he saw the
[2:47:02] condition of his people
[2:47:04] and he began praying oh god
[2:47:09] what will be the condition of this thy
[2:47:11] people israel
[2:47:13] and her future state daniel so moved
[2:47:17] the heart of god at the moment he
[2:47:19] started praying
[2:47:21] there was activity in heaven
[2:47:25] i'm trying not to let the kitty out of
[2:47:26] the bag but i got to say this
[2:47:29] when you start praying with that kind of
[2:47:30] sincerity
[2:47:32] no matter if you're riding down your
[2:47:33] road in the car you know
[2:47:36] and you don't even have the words all
[2:47:37] you can just
[2:47:39] anybody ever been there you just don't
[2:47:40] know what to say you just
[2:47:43] it's enough you know it's enough that it
[2:47:46] catches god's attention
[2:47:48] and the moment you make some little
[2:47:50] motion toward him just some
[2:47:52] little insignificant thing just to let
[2:47:54] him know
[2:47:55] god i need your help
[2:47:58] it causes activity
[2:48:02] in other realms
[2:48:09] listen to this again let me read to you
[2:48:11] one more time
[2:48:15] and whosoever shall confess me before
[2:48:17] men
[2:48:18] him shall the son of man also confess
[2:48:22] before the angels of god
[2:48:26] let's buy our heads together
[2:48:30] while your heads are bound tonight let's
[2:48:32] let's just think sincerely now
[2:48:35] about what it is that's amongst us
[2:48:39] lord jesus we love you so much
[2:48:43] god what a privilege it is to be in your
[2:48:44] house
[2:48:47] and heavenly father as we are gathered
[2:48:50] into this place
[2:48:52] we come here lord not because we
[2:48:55] at least i hope that our intention isn't
[2:48:57] to come just for the sake of coming
[2:49:00] but lord truly we come to the house of
[2:49:03] the lord it is for the purpose of
[2:49:08] being able to receive from the presence
[2:49:11] of god
[2:49:13] lord all around us there are angels
[2:49:18] powers authorities
[2:49:22] even this is what the bible said about
[2:49:24] even evil things
[2:49:27] and so we don't fight flesh and blood we
[2:49:28] don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[2:49:31] but principalities spirits powers
[2:49:35] and wicked things in high places
[2:49:40] now lord
[2:49:43] i said this the other weekend and lord
[2:49:46] when i said it it
[2:49:48] surprised me that the words come out of
[2:49:50] my mouth but i feel led to say it here
[2:49:53] and that is this for some of us lord
[2:49:57] that spend
[2:49:57] every day of our life feeling like we
[2:50:00] are alone
[2:50:03] god won't you let us be able to see
[2:50:05] today
[2:50:07] that we're never alone
[2:50:12] no matter what's going on around us
[2:50:15] no matter what's taking place around us
[2:50:19] no matter what kind of difficulties or
[2:50:21] troubles we might be under
[2:50:24] we are never
[2:50:27] alone
[2:50:30] now god i don't know the hearts of the
[2:50:34] people that are here tonight
[2:50:36] i know some of these folks preached to
[2:50:38] them for a lot of years
[2:50:40] i recognize most of the faces here
[2:50:44] but lord i don't know their heart only
[2:50:46] you know that
[2:50:50] but lord would you allow some of them
[2:50:54] tonight that really need this
[2:50:57] to be like gaheza when he stood there
[2:51:00] that day
[2:51:01] elisha got the word got the message
[2:51:04] across
[2:51:06] yeah he said there's more with us than
[2:51:09] there is with him
[2:51:10] when you opened up his eyes the
[2:51:12] mountains the hills
[2:51:14] valleys everything around was full of
[2:51:15] chariots of fire and angels of the lord
[2:51:18] oh god brother brandon said they don't
[2:51:21] go away on missions
[2:51:23] he said then camp about those
[2:51:26] that fear him now lord if they are our
[2:51:30] waiters
[2:51:32] then lord whatever we have need of
[2:51:33] tonight we call for the angels of the
[2:51:35] lord to deliver to us
[2:51:37] if it be healing if it be deliverance if
[2:51:40] it be faith if it be peace it could be
[2:51:42] joy
[2:51:43] whatever it is lord we want to call for
[2:51:46] the angels of the lord
[2:51:48] not a worship of angels but lord we
[2:51:51] worship you

[3:05:24] when you get behind the wheel of a car
[3:05:26] when you step through the doors of that

[3:06:12] the propaganda that the media is shoving
[3:06:14] down our throats
[3:06:16] we ain't got a hope in a world our only
[3:06:19] hope is to spend the rest of our life
[3:06:20] walking around and mask and sanitizing
[3:06:22] our hands every time
[3:06:23] [Music]
[3:06:26] none of this was a surprise to the lord
[3:06:29] none of it none of the world's
[3:06:31] conditions
[3:06:32] it's not a surprise to god and the
[3:06:35] minute we start feeling afraid
[3:06:38] always remember you're not alone
[3:06:44] let me tell you one more thing because i
[3:06:47] may not
[3:06:48] i may go a different direction in the
[3:06:49] morning i've just about got her done
[3:06:51] tonight
[3:06:52] got i got the log but i want you to
[3:06:55] think about something real quick
[3:06:58] remember when joshua was getting ready
[3:06:59] to march around the walls
[3:07:01] remember that remember the bible said
[3:07:05] be strong good courage be not dismayed
[3:07:08] lose heart
[3:07:09] as i was with moses i'll be with you
[3:07:12] remember when moses
[3:07:14] stopped up there before pharaoh
[3:07:18] he had a he had aaron at his side
[3:07:20] remember
[3:07:21] through down the staff so on and so
[3:07:23] forth like that
[3:07:24] when the death angel come through the
[3:07:26] camp they had the blood
[3:07:29] on the doors when they stepped out into
[3:07:31] the wilderness they had a pillar of fire
[3:07:33] by night they had a cloud by day
[3:07:36] and then he says i'll be with you joshua
[3:07:38] the same i was with moses
[3:07:41] when he's getting ready to march around
[3:07:43] the walls
[3:07:46] he's standing there and all of a sudden
[3:07:47] he's looking kind of off to the side
[3:07:49] perhaps
[3:07:51] and sees a man standing there with a
[3:07:52] sword
[3:07:54] full armor on perhaps joshua grabs that
[3:07:58] sword said friend or foe
[3:08:01] he said i am the captain of the lord's
[3:08:03] host
[3:08:05] don't you understand because the angels
[3:08:08] of the lord were commissioned to follow
[3:08:09] moses
[3:08:11] when moses left here you think the world
[3:08:14] knows how to hide waldo
[3:08:16] those angels hid moses body so good
[3:08:21] that the devil still don't know where
[3:08:22] he's been hit at
[3:08:24] they have disputed about the body of
[3:08:26] moses for years now
[3:08:29] they still don't know where he's at but
[3:08:31] they'll find him one day
[3:08:33] god will take that body from wherever
[3:08:34] he's hit and he'll drop back out here in
[3:08:36] this tribulation period
[3:08:37] he'll stand right before him for three
[3:08:39] and a half years
[3:08:41] but the minute god takes moses off the
[3:08:44] scene
[3:08:44] and joshua steps forward into his
[3:08:46] commission what shows up
[3:08:49] i am from the captain i am a captain of
[3:08:51] the lord's host
[3:08:53] oh it goes to prove they wasn't alone in
[3:08:55] the exodus
[3:08:56] he wasn't alone when he was on the
[3:08:58] backside of the desert he wasn't alone
[3:08:59] when the pestilence and the
[3:09:01] coronaviruses of their day and the
[3:09:03] plagues of their day and the bird flu
[3:09:05] and the hog flu and every other the cow
[3:09:07] flew and
[3:09:08] oh it'd be just something else the next
[3:09:09] thing they break open in a laboratory
[3:09:11] will be worse than this one
[3:09:13] but don't forget children of god don't
[3:09:15] forget
[3:09:16] this message was accompanied to us
[3:09:20] by the angel of the lord why do you
[3:09:23] think he set that prophet on a platform
[3:09:25] around the world and he'd say
[3:09:26] he's not two foot from
[3:09:31] why do you think that was given to us
[3:09:33] don't you think
[3:09:34] god didn't know in the last day that it
[3:09:37] would become such a dismal bleak time
[3:09:39] that every child of god would begin
[3:09:42] feeling alone
[3:09:44] why would he let us come all the way
[3:09:46] down to the end
[3:09:47] and let us fight this out by ourselves
[3:09:50] that's what i'm here to tell you tonight
[3:09:52] we've never been alone we will never be
[3:09:56] alone amen

[3:10:20] but i remember what the prophet said
[3:10:22] when a man is in the line of duty

[3:10:27] man that's going to hinder the work he's
[3:10:28] got before him
