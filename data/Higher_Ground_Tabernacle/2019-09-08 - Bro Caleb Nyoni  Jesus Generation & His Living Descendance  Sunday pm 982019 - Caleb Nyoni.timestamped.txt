[29:39] bob brannom was that's it
[29:43] problem was preaching in the message
[29:46] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[29:47] and forever he was he says mister
[29:51] setting right at the end of the seat do
[29:54] you want to get over that rapture like
[29:58] like a wound or something he says you
[30:00] think God can heal you of that rupture
[30:02] and make you well he says if you
[30:04] believed it you could receive it it's up
[30:07] to you whether you wanted to accept it
[30:09] or not you believe it at their heart but
[30:11] the brother did not respond then he says
[30:13] that didn't please the Holy Spirit he
[30:16] says the man ought to see it you see
[30:19] just a moment you gotta respond to it he
[30:23] says it left me it went to the audience
[30:26] I called the man and he didn't catch it
[30:29] you must respond just as soon as God
[30:32] called you
[30:33] God don't want you lingering he wants
[30:36] you to answer him so when the word is
[30:38] being preached you must respond to the
[30:40] supernatural if you don't get it someone
[30:44] who get it let us go to chapter number
[30:47] one of the book of Matthew I'll try to
[30:51] teach the Holy Ghost is in this place
[30:58] common scripture the book of the
[31:00] generation of Jesus Christ we are
[31:03] continuing from the morning service the
[31:04] son of David the son of Abraham and
[31:07] Abraham begat Isaac not Ishmael and

[31:43] david the king begat solomon of here who
[31:47] had been the wife of korea let us go to
[31:50] chapter number 53 of the Book of Isaiah
[31:53] Isaiah 53 verse 8 he was taken from
[32:00] prison and from judgment and who shall
[32:04] declare his generation for he was cut
[32:07] off of the land of the living for the
[32:10] transgression of my people he was
[32:13] stricken may God bless the reading of
[32:16] the word we may check our seats for a
[32:19] very few minutes I want to speak on the
[32:21] message called the generation or the
[32:23] Jesus generation and his living
[32:26] descendants we are the living
[32:29] descendants of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[32:31] before we get into our our talk this
[32:34] afternoon I want you to understand just
[32:39] in summary the seventy weeks of Daniel
[32:41] now before Jesus came there was a
[32:44] prophecy which was said that watch the
[32:48] person who comes on the 72 week that
[32:51] person will be called Messiah and that
[32:54] person will come and sit on David's
[32:56] throne and then we have a kingdom
[32:58] without end
[32:59] now when Jesus was born we see the
[33:02] japanagos were built time was moving for
[33:04] the prophets and prophesied in Isaiah
[33:06] had prophesied but I want you to watch
[33:09] this Jesus was born on week 69 when he
[33:13] was born on week 69 Jesus only preached
[33:16] for three and half years he started
[33:18] preaching at eight years old are we
[33:20] together he started preaching at eight
[33:22] years old and he only preached for three
[33:25] and a half years and the Bible says God
[33:28] put the spirit of slumber so that they
[33:31] don't see that he's the Messiah now
[33:33] remember the gospel only came to the
[33:35] Jews not the Gentiles we are the
[33:38] Gentiles that's why when Jesus was
[33:40] sending his disciples says go not in the
[33:42] way of the Gentiles go only to the Jews
[33:44] so the gospel only came to the Jews so
[33:48] when Jesus leads tamara's moving now
[33:50] remember we are now he was not 33 and a
[33:53] half God put the spirit of slumber
[33:55] so that he blinded their eyes so that
[33:57] they don't see that is the Messiah they
[33:59] took him to the cross and they crucified
[34:01] him
[34:02] now after crucified him he only lived in
[34:05] other words for half a week remember one
[34:07] week is equal to seven years so it's
[34:10] seventy by seven now after they
[34:13] crucified him now that's why we see the
[34:16] Gentile dispensation from poor to
[34:18] Branham now for you to understand
[34:21] seventy weeks I want you to understand
[34:25] if Jesus had lived up to this 70th week
[34:28] there was going to be millennium in
[34:31] other words ask the Gentiles were not
[34:33] going to enter there so he had to think
[34:35] about you and me that there's some
[34:36] brothers in America there are brought
[34:38] some brothers in Africa let me die for
[34:40] these people so and then he says the
[34:43] other train half years I'll pack them
[34:45] some way and Moses and Elijah will come
[34:47] and finish them and after months and
[34:50] Elijah only one 44,000 will be saved now
[34:55] getting to our our taught this afternoon
[34:58] we see boas was a man of wealth but was
[35:04] married amore by this widow but was was
[35:07] a mighty man of Valor he was a mighty
[35:11] man of integrity he was born in
[35:13] Bethlehem from the tribe of Judah and
[35:16] every beautiful girl would want to get
[35:19] married to Boas but he condoned so low
[35:23] to go and marry Ruth a more about his
[35:25] widow just like Jesus he condoned so low
[35:29] down from his glory to come and marry us
[35:32] the Gentiles we read of the four gentle
[35:35] women in the scripture who got married
[35:38] to four men from Judah but by virtue of
[35:41] marriage they came into Judah they came
[35:43] into Christ we read of tamo who was
[35:46] married from an ancestral relationship
[35:48] we read of Rahab the harlot we read of
[35:51] Ruth the more by the Sweden and we read
[35:54] of Bathsheba an adulteress all these
[35:57] four women they are the grandmothers of
[35:59] Jesus what kind of book that this is the
[36:03] third brother Branham says if you read
[36:05] your Bible and you don't find Jesus
[36:07] Christ come back country
[36:08] again because it was the intact theme of
[36:11] the whole Bible now we want to
[36:13] understand the generation of Jesus in
[36:15] Genesis 5 we read about generations of
[36:18] Adam Adam was the head of a fallen
[36:21] ruined race he was the head of a fallen
[36:25] creation he himself went to follow his
[36:28] adulterous wife to go and have the six
[36:31] head instead of producing the children
[36:33] by the spoken word but the Bible is
[36:36] clear that in Adam we all die he says if
[36:39] any man born of sex or born of a woman
[36:43] comes here dead in sins shaped in
[36:45] iniquity because we are coming in the
[36:48] animal realm of reproduction in Genesis
[36:51] 1:26 28 when God had created man men
[36:54] could talk to his father face-to-face
[36:55] because he was from thoughts to word to
[36:58] flesh but a man but of a woman goes from
[37:01] thoughts to flesh by passing the word
[37:03] so if one is born outside the kingdom
[37:06] you come in the animal realm of
[37:08] reproduction that's why I says except
[37:10] one is born by the spirit and war and
[37:12] water you cannot enter the kingdom of
[37:14] God when Jesus came as a redeemer he
[37:17] comes from thoughts you came from taught
[37:19] to wedge to flesh because he was Elohim
[37:21] to Melchizedek to Jesus that's why
[37:24] Hebrews 4 2 says his works were finished
[37:26] before the foundation of the world
[37:28] because he is in finite he knows all
[37:30] things
[37:31] so broblem says since the opening of the
[37:35] seven seals God is bringing man back to
[37:37] the world second Corinthians five it
[37:39] says any man in Christ is a new creation
[37:42] because a way was made through his death
[37:45] and resurrection so that we received the
[37:47] Holy Ghost and we have a new path and we
[37:50] are born by the spirit that's why Jesus
[37:52] says you must be born again we see Adam
[37:55] and Jesus didn't come by sex but every
[37:58] other human being came by sex and if you
[38:01] come by sex you come here behind the law
[38:03] of gravity holding you are down but we
[38:07] see Jesus broke the law of gravity when
[38:09] he rose on the third day he was
[38:11] appearing and disappearing but I says
[38:14] any man in Christ is a new creation old
[38:16] things are passed away all things have
[38:19] become new that's why we receive a new
[38:21] name
[38:22] new heaven new nature a new earth so in
[38:27] Adam we'll all die but because of new
[38:29] bed a way was made to disconnect from
[38:32] the first Adam and be connected to the
[38:34] Lord Jesus
[38:36] so the first Adam fell but Jesus the
[38:40] last Adam is the Lord from heaven who
[38:43] came with a quickening spirit to quicken
[38:45] us Alleluia
[38:47] to raise us up into the heavenly places
[38:49] taking us from reasoning into faith
[38:52] because we don't know by sight but we
[38:54] walk by faith if you want by sight
[38:58] Alleluia so we see brother Braun was
[39:02] working was moving to the and sin and
[39:04] sin world one time we went to the fifth
[39:07] dimension to the regions of the lost
[39:09] when he went there he went is a so day
[39:11] he didn't have there was no room for tea
[39:14] or fun but when he went to the sixth
[39:16] dimension there was another body waiting
[39:18] for him
[39:19] meaning that he was from above so we see
[39:22] Adam brought his descendants through sex
[39:24] but Jesus the last Adam brought his
[39:27] descendants through new bed being born
[39:30] again to an incorruptible seed in the
[39:33] morning we spoke about the promises were
[39:35] given to Abraham and his seed and we
[39:38] said that we are also in that lineage
[39:40] Branham is also a father of many nations
[39:43] amen
[39:44] so the Bible says no man in heaven or
[39:48] the earth was able or was waited to look
[39:51] at this book or to even take the book
[39:54] because this book is for those who have
[39:56] eternal life
[39:57] Saturn don't have it in our life he has
[39:59] temporal life and God has the title from
[40:03] all that he created we've seen
[40:05] revelations 5 Melchizedek king of
[40:07] righteousness King spirit Elohim king of
[40:10] kings the Most High God he went he took
[40:13] the book now we see at the end of the
[40:16] seventh age a slain lamp was coming
[40:18] kinsman redeemer and he took the book to
[40:22] open and to review those names there
[40:28] will be a super race
[40:30] who know their rights who know their
[40:32] inheritance and that's us so when the
[40:36] first when they infest the lab took the
[40:38] book in heaven but the book has to come
[40:41] here on earth so we sealed the NGO cried
[40:43] out with a loud voice and seven thunders
[40:45] uttered their voices revealing those
[40:48] divine mystery truths under them seven
[40:50] seals calling those names they do not
[40:53] cut out the denominations but you to
[40:55] gather the bride so we see there was no
[40:58] more genealogy after Matthew in the New
[41:00] Testament that's why I said we shall
[41:02] declare his generation then the book of
[41:05] Matthew starts by saying the book of the
[41:07] generation of Jesus Christ in other
[41:09] words the meeting is trying to present a
[41:11] case but only the true seed could be
[41:15] reborn amen seed could not it cannot
[41:20] quicken so all the dead in Christ at the
[41:23] last Trump we see time shall be no more
[41:26] for the Gentiles
[41:27] first Corinthians 51 52 the dead in
[41:31] Christ shall be raised is the same
[41:33] spirit that's what the Prophet says say
[41:36] it's the same spirit that raised Christ
[41:38] from the dead it will quicken you and
[41:41] raise you to the heavenly places
[41:43] this bodies for the law of sin but the
[41:47] Holy Ghost the quickening power problem
[41:49] says it will pull this body and he says
[41:52] this body already turned heavenly it cut
[41:56] it just come faster than I could even
[41:58] imagine it he pleased about quickening
[42:01] power but I'm experiencing quickening
[42:03] power right now so at the seventh age we
[42:06] see a prophet came to the scene and
[42:07] brought the new genealogy and he shows
[42:10] us from Jesus dying on the cross and
[42:13] raising and the Holy Ghost coming to the
[42:15] church in Acts chapter number one giving
[42:18] us new birth being baptized in Christ
[42:21] because he's the head of all creation
[42:24] from there it went to Paul in AD 53 from
[42:29] poor it went to Iranians from Iranians
[42:31] it went to Columba from Kalume by 22
[42:34] Luther from Lu that went to Wesley from
[42:36] Wesley it went to brother Branham in
[42:38] these revelations 10-7 in that book that
[42:42] Adam forfeited sudden
[42:44] to take the book and God says get your
[42:46] filthy hands you can't touch this book
[42:48] because this book is for all those who
[42:50] have eternal life
[42:52] it will gather the wheat not the cheese
[42:55] so at the end of the seventh age we see
[42:58] the book is the title deed of the family
[43:01] and that book in Revelations 10 the
[43:06] mighty Angier has he came with a book
[43:09] and told John he says John take the book
[43:12] he says what should I do with this book
[43:13] he says into the book so between the
[43:18] sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet
[43:20] between the second and the third war
[43:22] John is eating the book and prophesying
[43:25] again
[43:26] so Abraham died in 1965 December the
[43:29] 24th so from that time up until now John
[43:32] is eating the book so the genealogy of
[43:35] Branham who by his seeds must bring
[43:38] forth a race that Adam was supposed to
[43:40] bring forth by the Ted Pugh the spoken
[43:43] word the original seed to bring back the
[43:46] original faith that's what I believe Rob
[43:49] Ram says the true bride must know who
[43:51] she is and what she's raised up for so
[43:55] that she could do the greater works so
[43:57] and the last Trump we see Paul come with
[43:59] his children Columba will come with
[44:01] these children Martin who come with his
[44:03] children
[44:04] hallelujah pranam on camera these
[44:06] children but we were alive and remain we
[44:08] are a super race we are a super Church
[44:11] who shall declare his generation I am
[44:14] declaring his generation this afternoon
[44:16] we are a chosen generation we are a
[44:20] peculiar people
[44:21] we are not hoaxes we are not vouchers we
[44:24] are born Eagles who have been born in a
[44:27] Negro age by an ego prophets message to
[44:30] manifest the Living Word for our day
[44:32] quick and then lifted up from the
[44:34] mountaintop setting on the cleft of the
[44:36] rock where only Eagles there so we are
[44:40] egos we need to fly
[44:41] so let's fly where the caucus is let's
[44:45] fly when the open wedge is when the open
[44:49] book is Alleluia you are an ego brother

[53:05] you get by yourself and you can just
[53:07] pray you can get as ugly as you want to
[53:12] nobody can bother you right you can
[53:17] really have a Pentecostal revival down
[53:20] on your knees because it's needful if
[53:26] auntie years ago can stop the prophets
[53:30] plane make him walk nine miles that's
[53:35] not a short distance young instilling
[53:38] them saying he cares for all of us never
[53:43] think God doesn't care he cares for all
[53:46] of us it is the devil who makes us think
[53:48] he doesn't care but
[53:51] all of the millions of people in this
[53:53] life you have heard this message mmm you
[53:59] ain't got enough thing to do with it
[54:01] it ain't about your works it's about
[54:05] here's hallelujah but I realize one
[54:09] thing that you can't go no further
[54:11] without the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[54:14] Ghost is not a feeling it's not just a
[54:17] speaking in tongues you know those
[54:19] sensations are nice but at the end of
[54:22] the day you got to know you've been
[54:24] changed and that God has come into your
[54:27] heart and given you a different desire
[54:30] from the one that you used to have
[54:34] hallelujah I said in your heart
[54:36] amen where the ear is hallelujah I like
[54:42] that brother I won't forget it

[55:14] you desire hallelujah just the other
[55:19] night we only had eight but it was good
[55:20] I count the numbers folks haha amen
[55:25] because I realized that when God comes
[55:27] in the building you can get whatever you
[55:29] want but one thing God will not make he
[55:34] will not force you I like the response I
[55:39] was on my knees here and I was crying
[55:44] out to the Lord and the Lord whispered
[55:47] something in my ear it was when I
[55:51] responded is when something hit here and
[55:56] I felt like I had something solid just
[56:01] holding me and it still holding
[56:05] hallelujah but you got to respond and
[56:11] quickly you can't say oh well I answer
[56:14] him tomorrow tomorrow he's gone is that
[56:17] right oh yeah you remember songs of
[56:19] Solomon knocking at the door you took
[56:20] your time and now he's gone
[56:22] where's my beloved so you got to realize
[56:25] that when God comes knocking on your
[56:27] heart you say yes Lord Hey and leave the
[56:31] rest up to him yes Lord hallelujah
[56:35] what's that scripture brother and Jove
[56:38] give me that scripture please you may
[56:42] see it just a minute just a minute you
[56:44] know I appreciate the brother and I'm
[56:45] not trying to take over the service but
[56:48] I just know this scripture has really
[56:51] played I think it's 22 job 22
[56:54] I love the Word of God I can't get
[57:00] enough of it well I don't want it you
[57:04] know say feel my cup I'm waiting for it
[57:07] to run over because like the more I get
[57:10] too deep again it's the truth I'm
[57:16] running off it gets deeper and deeper
[57:19] and deeper and it goes up like this and
[57:22] it goes down like this and just get
[57:23] wider and wider right it's this what it
[57:28] says then he is gracious unto Him and
[57:33] saith deliver him from going down to the
[57:36] pit can you back it up some I think yeah
[57:43] his flesh is consumed a way that it
[57:47] cannot be seen and his bones that were
[57:50] not seeing stick out yay his so draws
[57:55] near unto the grave
[58:15] let's go to the 26 please he shall pray
[58:19] unto God and He will be favourable unto
[58:23] him and he shall see his face with joy
[58:26] for he will render unto man his
[58:30] righteousness he look at the pond men
[58:34] and if any say I have sinned that's it
[58:36] and perverted that which was right and
[58:41] it profit me not he will deliver his
[58:46] soul from going into the pit and his
[58:50] life shall see the light lo all these
[58:55] things work at God often time with man
[59:00] all God needs us to do is recognize when
[59:04] we're wrong admit when you're wrong
[59:08] admit when you've gone wrong in whatever
[59:11] way and says Lord your way is right my
[59:15] way is wrong
[59:16] forgive me Lord and God said God will
[59:20] deliver his soul from the pit hmm what a
[59:24] powerful scripture so you and I know
[59:28] that this message has come crying to us
[59:30] grace grace I'll tell you what I am so
[59:38] glad to be in the genealogy of Jesus
[59:42] Christ because I realized like brother
[59:48] Branham said he said this you ain't got
[59:50] nothing to do with it it's God who chose
[59:53] you if somebody helped me you don't
[59:57] choose God God chose you and the Bible
[1:00:01] tells me who God call he justifies and
[1:00:04] he not only justified he glorified none
[1:00:08] of us can live it like God can live it
[1:00:10] somebody help me here it is the Christ
[1:00:13] that lives in us that causes us to make
[1:00:17] a rapture we don't deal with law we deal
[1:00:21] with grace hallelujah if you think you
[1:00:26] go live so well that you go to
[1:00:29] make a rapture because of the way you
[1:00:30] live hallelujah
[1:00:32] I'm telling you about a man who told me
[1:00:33] one thing Paul said is not our that live
[1:00:36] but Christ that lives in me
[1:00:37] that's the perfection of God hallelujah
[1:00:42] our righteousness is as filthy rags and
[1:00:44] as long as we think that we can come to
[1:00:48] a place where we can please God in this
[1:00:51] flesh you are deceived hmm and guess
[1:01:00] what he purposed it to be this way so
[1:01:03] that you and I could have joy you
[1:01:07] understand me he became our sin that we
[1:01:11] might become the righteousness of God
[1:01:13] that's my faith if I've got the
[1:01:15] righteousness of God hallelujah
[1:01:18] I got joy I got peace not because of my
[1:01:22] righteousness his righteousness y'all
[1:01:25] understand what I'm saying listen the
[1:01:27] only thing that's different from us and
[1:01:29] those of the others is that when we got
[1:01:32] to the door they put a robe on us and
[1:01:36] that role was the robe of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:38] and that rope covered everybody who was
[1:01:42] invited whoa only the man who didn't
[1:01:46] have on the robe was kicked out
[1:01:49] hallelujah
[1:01:50] so what I'm trying to say is take the
[1:01:53] robe off and you still got the same man
[1:02:00] you know the Lord
[1:02:02] I appreciate the brother well that was a
[1:02:06] short quick word but it sure enough was
[1:02:10] good
[1:02:10] saying so God would bless I'm just
[1:02:13] trying to get us to see to anchor
[1:02:15] something take away the struggle he says
[1:02:18] come in to me and Rhett you got a press
[1:02:20] into that rest Hebrews says press into
[1:02:24] it that's the only time you gonna have
[1:02:27] to wrassle huh

[1:02:33] into that cuz this old mine gonna want
[1:02:37] us to be in a way trying to try to make
[1:02:40] our own self righteous
[1:02:41] don't get me wrong I'm not saying
[1:02:44] Christians don't live right Christian
[1:02:47] lives right because they want a real
[1:02:48] live right and because the Holy Ghost is
[1:02:50] making them live right
[1:02:51] it's to change God and you living
[1:02:55] through you ain't you live in if you
[1:02:58] live in you you got to die not it's God
[1:03:01] living in if you want to make a raptor
[1:03:04] you got to die in a right to your own
[1:03:06] thoughts to your own wheel to your own
[1:03:08] way
[1:03:09] you've got to die in rot in order for
[1:03:12] Christ to live in you if you're still
[1:03:15] the same of Jesus Christ in the gospel
[1:03:17] you are not dead when you get to a place
[1:03:25] that Jesus Christ is your all and all
[1:03:27] you've accomplished something and your
[1:03:32] accomplishment is that God you have
[1:03:35] allowed God to come into you hello you
[1:03:40] have allowed God you understand me
[1:03:44] because all he always putting it out
[1:03:47] there but you got to allow him like our
[1:03:50] brother say answer it Mary Mary Mary I
[1:03:55] don't know how it's going to be but be
[1:03:56] it unto me according to thy word I'm
[1:04:00] looking for a rapture people and this
[1:04:06] this one thing I do know if God said the
[1:04:10] word how many I believe the word the
[1:04:12] Bible said if we keep our minds dead on
[1:04:14] him he will give us perfect peace while
[1:04:22] I listen to the devil and you get all
[1:04:24] this stuff going through your head if
[1:04:26] God said if I keep my mind stayed on him
[1:04:29] here granting me perfect peace o truly
[1:04:32] when I when the days get bad and I'm
[1:04:35] having a rough time here I call a
[1:04:38] brother or somebody to help me pray or
[1:04:40] if I can't get in contact with them
[1:04:42] I pray y'all mean you don't say but I
[1:04:45] know that was I pray the devil won't
[1:04:48] stay I'm telling you your victory is in
[1:04:55] prayer
[1:04:56] he said well I don't feeling you might
[1:04:59] not feel it at the beginning but
[1:05:03] sometimes all you can do is say Jesus
[1:05:06] see some about that name you know Jesus
[1:05:09] Jesus sometimes that's all I could say
[1:05:12] he knew my heart but sometimes you know
[1:05:15] you are hurting so bad and you're going
[1:05:17] through so many things you say Jesus
[1:05:18] sometimes I say have mercy Lord
[1:05:21] lord have mercy give me grace Lord give
[1:05:24] me yarn before sometimes all I can do
[1:05:29] you know when you in pain you don't feel
[1:05:32] like no whole conversation you just want
[1:05:36] to say a few words that's how you you
[1:05:42] know i'ma tell you what I am I'm gonna
[1:05:43] tell you something I don't play with God
[1:05:45] I call it just like it is hallelujah
[1:05:50] you don't go to Gaza Oh Lord forgive me
[1:05:52] of my known and unknown sins you know
[1:05:59] what you've done you know where it is
[1:06:02] wherever there's there's a breach that's
[1:06:03] the only way God Satan can come in on
[1:06:05] you another thing too and I'm getting
[1:06:08] ready to close I don't know whether you
[1:06:12] know the brother has told you to speak
[1:06:13] it it's here the Bible said God ain't up
[1:06:19] there
[1:06:21] God is in here knotty even in your mouth
[1:06:26] hmm
[1:06:27] you don't have to feel goosebumps to
[1:06:31] speak it matter time many times you've
[1:06:35] said something under the inspiration of
[1:06:36] the Holy Ghost and you don't even know
[1:06:38] it until it happens and I tell people
[1:06:45] this today I said you know I told
[1:06:46] somebody the other day I said some of my
[1:06:49] children look like they're in situations
[1:06:50] don't it God won't be able to get them
[1:06:53] out I said you know that's the devil
[1:06:55] that's the devil that gives you that
[1:06:57] kind of vision that's the depth where
[1:07:02] I'm gonna get a vision you gonna receive
[1:07:05] that when God says he's already there
[1:07:08] for my deliverance
[1:07:09] God told me years ago he had given me
[1:07:12] all my children and every since then
[1:07:16] troubles and trials and troubles and
[1:07:18] trials and the devil want me to shake in
[1:07:20] my shoes sometimes I look like I'm so
[1:07:23] unconcerned because God has given a
[1:07:28] promise one day I'm telling you back to
[1:07:32] prayer one day I was on my knees not
[1:07:34] here I lived in Lima Ohio I think at the
[1:07:38] time my kids was young and I was praying
[1:07:42] I don't even know who I was praying for
[1:07:43] and what I was praying and here come the
[1:07:46] voice and God said I have given you all
[1:07:49] your children didn't even ask for it but
[1:07:53] he told me I have given you all your
[1:07:55] children and you know what he did he
[1:07:57] named every one of them in order you
[1:08:02] asked me to name him now see he has a
[1:08:07] way of doing it so Satan from that point
[1:08:09] on maybe the devil say see you shouldn't
[1:08:11] have said that over the pulpit because
[1:08:13] once I said over the pulpit it looked
[1:08:15] like he came after him but I'm gonna
[1:08:18] tell you something
[1:08:19] every time Satan tries to weaken me God
[1:08:22] always sends a word of encouragement
[1:08:26] folks hold fast to faith no matter what
[1:08:30] like you said not fear not hope but hold
[1:08:34] fast to faith whatever God says that's
[1:08:37] what he meant and that's just the way
[1:08:39] it's gonna be
[1:08:40] devil you can roll up all you want is
[1:08:43] that right that one more illustration
[1:08:45] it's anointing is up here that's what it
[1:08:48] is and I'm trying to get from under it
[1:08:50] but my point is this when that boy had
[1:08:55] the spirit of epilepsy and Jesus cast
[1:08:58] that devil out what happened that devil
[1:09:03] start it he took that boy and he stopped
[1:09:05] throwing them everywhere in our natural
[1:09:08] eye you know what we would've said oh my
[1:09:10] god it's getting worse Jesus just stood
[1:09:13] there like go ahead on an a-cup devil
[1:09:17] but you know you don't heard the word
[1:09:19] and you getting out today
[1:09:22] now and that's the way you have to you
[1:09:26] can't go by your eyes when you pray for
[1:09:28] somebody got cancer or whether case me
[1:09:30] someone's gonna feel it and you don't it
[1:09:32] ain't feelings it's the word it doesn't
[1:09:37] matter
[1:09:38] oh I'm a screaming get out yeah when did
[1:09:40] you ever hear brother branham talk to
[1:09:42] the devil like that God don't have to
[1:09:46] scream at the devil you know like he's
[1:09:48] death when you are confident and you
[1:09:54] know the word is right you just speak it
[1:09:58] leave devil and the only time the
[1:10:01] probably God scream that the devil was
[1:10:03] when he was talking to the whole
[1:10:04] audience I'd take him under my control
[1:10:07] and I command you know and that's what
[1:10:09] he was screaming because he was working
[1:10:12] with all one more thought and I'm gonna
[1:10:16] let you go I love this thought a
[1:10:21] generation of Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:10:26] says the whole family and the whole
[1:10:28] earth his name y'all heard me say this
[1:10:30] the other day neither is there salvation
[1:10:32] in any other there's no other name given
[1:10:35] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[1:10:37] but the name of Jesus Christ we are the
[1:10:40] body of Jesus Christ right if I'm
[1:10:43] walking down the road and say Larry
[1:10:46] because my name ain't Larry when God
[1:10:53] went to that grave is says Lazarus
[1:10:54] brother Balaam said he had to call him
[1:10:56] by name otherwise all of the grades
[1:11:00] would have been open hallelujah and when
[1:11:05] Jesus come back he'll call us by name
[1:11:09] but he ain't gonna call Isaiah Michael
[1:11:12] he gonna call us by our addictive metal
[1:11:15] and there's only one redemptive name
[1:11:20] he's got to take us back to Genesis
[1:11:23] because Adam female was Adam and Adam
[1:11:27] there was Adam and their name was Adam
[1:11:30] and when they got in trouble God didn't
[1:11:33] say Adam Adam he said
[1:11:35] Adam and they both turn and when God
[1:11:38] brings forth the resurrection he'll call
[1:11:41] one name and everybody that sleeps under
[1:11:44] and in that name he'll call the name of
[1:11:48] the Lord Jesus Christ or whatever his
[1:11:50] new name is they will have it and
[1:11:55] they'll get up oh let me get up
[1:11:58] hallelujah there get up God Engels a
[1:12:02] merry joke
[1:12:03] Genki no oh
[1:12:08] die in Christ I'm so happy about it
[1:12:13] is that right cuz you understand we have
[1:12:16] a mark - they have a mark which is the
[1:12:21] mark of the beast with the organization
[1:12:24] and nomination and is that right but we
[1:12:26] have a mark - and we have wet in our
[1:12:29] forehead the name of the Lord the Word
[1:12:32] of God is written in our forehead that
[1:12:38] Stan I'm have to go home and practice
[1:12:44] how to do that one I was telling
[1:12:52] everybody this morning I said my if I
[1:12:54] could just give that all that
[1:12:55] information like he did in that short
[1:12:57] period of time I'd be all right
[1:13:00] it was like page at the page at the page
[1:13:04] at the page and I so I was so blessed
[1:13:09] if you don't remember let me say like
[1:13:11] this we are in this rapture God is
[1:13:15] changing people right now the Holy
[1:13:18] Spirit spoke to me and I believe when he
[1:13:21] spoke he said the bride is in revival
[1:13:24] now the trash is being kicked out all of
[1:13:29] the world of desires has been kicked out
[1:13:31] hallelujah and when all is gone out God
[1:13:36] will come down hallelujah so understand
[1:13:40] we who are the bride we allowed amnesia
[1:13:43] to strike us to that right we forgot our
[1:13:48] purpose we thought all coming to church
[1:13:50] making people happy shouting and dance
[1:13:53] and speaking in touch just like a
[1:13:54] Pentecostals but we came to do one thing
[1:13:58] and that is to magnify the name of the
[1:14:00] Lord is that right and prove to this
[1:14:04] generation that Jesus Christ is still
[1:14:07] God
[1:14:11] that's what brother Ben did
[1:14:13] he proved that Jesus Christ was still
[1:14:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:14:19] he changed not and now the perfection of
[1:14:23] the Son of Man is in the bride of Jesus
[1:14:26] Christ that's what he says I believe
[1:14:30] that with all my heart
[1:14:32] I'm pressing with all my heart and I cry
[1:14:35] out every day Lord whatever you got for
[1:14:39] me whatever you need me to do
[1:14:41] make it happen Lord I surrender all to
[1:14:44] you I wanted out why because everything
[1:14:48] you think that you have is going to be
[1:14:50] destroyed hallelujah that that angel
[1:14:54] he's got that destroyed weapon in his
[1:14:56] head I'm like what's wrong with the
[1:14:58] people hurricanes over here fires over
[1:15:01] here earthquakes over here it seizes and
[1:15:03] it famines and laws and rules of wars
[1:15:06] and the people are like in a daze
[1:15:11] something's wrong
[1:15:13] something's wrong in the message amnesia
[1:15:16] in 64 brother Brown said if you remain
[1:15:19] in that amnesia it will take
[1:15:23] they got people of God see the hours
[1:15:27] that you live in everything is gonna be
[1:15:29] destroyed it doesn't matter how well you
[1:15:32] build it even how will you establish it
[1:15:35] it's going to be every Kingdom that the
[1:15:38] devil has set up got to come down hey
[1:15:42] man is that right brother that New
[1:15:45] Kingdom brother man we'll call it an
[1:15:47] empire I like that word Airmen Empire
[1:15:51] sound like you got some power behind you
[1:15:53] here yes sir
[1:15:56] and this empire that's being set up it's
[1:15:59] because we were there but it be ah hear
[1:16:02] me you give priests and kings now
[1:16:05] because she was priests and kings before
[1:16:09] hello somebody you're the bride now
[1:16:13] because she was the bride before in his
[1:16:17] mind and understand like I said God
[1:16:19] there's no babies in heaven there'll be
[1:16:23] no babies in the new world
[1:16:25] that's that babies came by the fall who
[1:16:28] they just so cute
[1:16:31] but remember when Sharon rose when
[1:16:35] brother madam saw her she was already an
[1:16:36] adult and she said daddy babies are not
[1:16:39] here see cuz why when the first Adam he
[1:16:44] was supposed to speak the word and bring
[1:16:47] forth children theophanies were already
[1:16:50] waiting hallelujah the fall came and
[1:16:54] guess what the Theophilus had to wait
[1:16:56] they gotta wait that's why Paul said if
[1:17:01] this building be dissolved
[1:17:02] I have a theophany I have a building
[1:17:05] over there why because we had to bypass
[1:17:07] our theophany to come into this place
[1:17:10] but they are waiting the angels are
[1:17:13] standing before the throne of God but
[1:17:16] there's a kingdom there's something
[1:17:18] coming even scientists know that there's
[1:17:21] another dimension they're trying to
[1:17:23] crack into it
[1:17:27] we don't crack into that dimension is
[1:17:31] where we come from one of these old days
[1:17:35] will walk right on through the wall
[1:17:37] somebody help me
[1:17:39] remember that first resurrection when
[1:17:41] you wind up a saints of God Rome's they
[1:17:44] rose and brother and said they were in
[1:17:46] me at the orphanage hallelujah

[1:17:51] city and once it's oh just Abraham
