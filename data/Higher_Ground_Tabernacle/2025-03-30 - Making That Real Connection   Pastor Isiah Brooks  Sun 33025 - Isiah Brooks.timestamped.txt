[43:06] working power in the preious blood of

[43:24] Amen. I've got a few announcements.
[43:26] We're going to have a baptism,
[43:30] our brother Diego, right? We'll be
[43:34] baptizing him in the name of the Lord
[43:35] Jesus Christ.
[43:40] Amen. We also have a prayer
[43:43] request for the Britain family, a good
[43:46] friend of
[43:47] mine. Uh they once lived in New York,
[43:51] but they're now live in York North
[43:54] Carolina.
[43:56] North Carolina on the 27th of this
[43:59] month.
[44:00] Uh e I who was only 21 years old
[44:05] uh was killed in an accident.
[44:10] We want you to pray for him. Pray pray
[44:13] for his family rather.
[44:15] Amen.
[44:17] Um God knows how to do things.
[44:21] We also want to pray for my best, one of
[44:24] my best friends,
[44:25] Brian Barnes. He's brother Stanley
[44:28] Barnes's
[44:29] son. He was in a collision last
[44:33] night. He's doing fine, but he total his
[44:36] car that he he just
[44:39] purchased. So, he's he's really um
[44:43] upset. He's a young man, too.
[44:46] I want to say to the young people,
[44:48] you can't think because you're
[44:51] young. Uh death and bad trials won't
[44:54] knock on your
[44:56] door. It seems like there's a spirit now
[44:58] that's moving in the land. So, I want to
[45:01] really, you know, encourage the young
[45:03] people, be watchful,
[45:05] uh be careful, but most of
[45:07] all, make sure you're prayed up.
[45:11] Amen. You may be seated just for a
[45:14] moment.
[45:15] Uh my precious that's one of the reasons
[45:17] why brother Gio is not here this
[45:21] morning. Of course this is a dear friend
[45:24] of his family
[45:26] actually brother
[45:28] Ivonne from New York basically raised
[45:32] this this young man in his
[45:35] church. So they are all grieving really
[45:39] hard because it came at an unexpected
[45:42] time. So let's just have a word of
[45:45] prayer quickly. You may remain seated.
[45:47] Father God, we come before you, Lord. We
[45:50] pray for the Britain family. Lord, we
[45:52] pray for the Barnes family as well.
[45:55] Lord, especially for the Britain's Lord.
[45:56] They have lost one of their children,
[45:59] one of their younger ones. Lord, I pray,
[46:02] Father God, that you comfort them in
[46:04] this time of bereiement. Give them
[46:06] strength, Lord God. And Lord, we'll be
[46:09] careful to give you the praise, the
[46:12] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[53:14] [Music]
[53:18] Hallelujah.
[53:21] [Music]
[53:25] Amen. I understand we
[53:29] have visitors from Colorado.
[53:34] Shalom and angel. Sir, shalom, sir.
[53:36] Angel.
[53:40] Okay.
[53:43] Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[53:46] God is good to us. Amen.
[53:53] I love that song.
[53:56] One time I was
[53:58] in Guyana,
[54:01] South America,
[54:03] and I was in a Muslim territory.
[54:08] And I didn't know
[54:09] that. And the speakers were quite loud
[54:15] and it made some of the people nervous
[54:19] when I began to say not Allah,
[54:23] not even Harry Krishna.
[54:26] There's only one living God.
[54:30] And those of you who were here on
[54:33] Wednesday night, we talked about the
[54:35] name of Jesus.
[54:38] that name that is above every
[54:42] name. Yeah. If you want to refine
[54:45] yourself in heavenly
[54:48] places, start talking about the name of
[54:50] Jesus.
[54:53] Even the prophet of God said when you
[54:54] talk about him,
[54:56] hallelujah, the angels, he even draw
[54:59] near to you.
[55:01] So I I I I love that name.
[55:04] uh the song. I I appreciate all the
[55:07] songs that went up before Zion
[55:10] uh before God.
[55:13] Uh and uh what can I say?
[55:17] I I really miss my brother um Gio from
[55:22] not coming. Uh but but I appreciate him
[55:25] calling me to allow me know allow me to
[55:29] know the reason why he couldn't come.
[55:34] I know we would have had a great time of
[55:36] fellowship with him. I did say by God's
[55:40] grace when the Lord allowed that door to
[55:43] open
[55:44] again. He is a
[55:47] businessman, a great
[55:49] business there in New York. And um so
[55:54] anyway, he uh has a busy schedule,
[55:59] you know, when you hire people and all
[56:01] that kind of stuff. But to meet him, you
[56:04] just never
[56:05] know that that is the kind of a person
[56:08] he is, a very humble man of
[56:13] God and um has a mind to help any and
[56:17] everybody that he know God would lead
[56:20] him to.
[56:22] As we as we stand, let us turn to the
[56:25] scripture.
[56:27] Thank you musicians for all that you
[56:38] do. the 11th chapter
[56:43] and we're going to read the 33rd verse.
[56:48] From Romans 11, we'll go to Isaiah 26.
[56:55] And from that uh particular scripture,
[56:58] we'll go to Ecclesiastes 3 and1.
[57:06] Romans 11:33
[57:10] Oh, the depth of the riches both of
[57:14] wisdom and knowledge of God. How
[57:17] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[57:21] ways past finding out.
[57:32] Isaiah 26
[57:43] and3 it reads, "Thou will keep him in
[57:48] perfect
[57:49] peace whose mind is stayed on thee."
[57:53] Amen. Because he trusted in thee.
[58:02] It is only when we lose trust in
[58:06] God when our minds become
[58:13] confused. But when you trust in
[58:17] God, you have the peace of
[58:21] God. Ecclesiastes 3
[58:24] and1 I say
[58:31] to everything there is a season and a
[58:35] time to every
[58:37] purpose under heaven.
[58:46] Let us
[58:47] pray. Our gracious father God, we come
[58:50] before you Lord
[58:52] as humbly as we know how.
[58:55] We thank you for your
[58:57] grace. We thank you for your
[58:59] mercy. We thank you for the love that
[59:02] you have shared abroad in our
[59:04] hearts.
[59:06] Father, forgive us anything we may have
[59:08] said or done even even this morning. Let
[59:12] our center focus be on
[59:15] you and your people. Give us the grace
[59:18] to move completely out of your
[59:21] way. Speak to the hearts of the people.
[59:24] Should I say anything that's wrong
[59:27] that's not according to your word? I
[59:29] pray that you would block the hearing,
[59:31] Lord. Father God, I pray that you would
[59:34] remove
[59:35] it because it is only my
[59:39] desire to preach what you have
[59:42] preached, what you have stated through
[59:45] the message of the hour. Grant it Lord,
[59:49] in your name Jesus Christ, we pray.
[59:52] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[59:57] For those of us who have uh not been
[1:00:01] here and for various reasons, some of
[1:00:03] you work and things like
[1:00:08] that, not trying to accuse you of
[1:00:12] anything. But what my uh desire
[1:00:16] is as the pastor of the church,
[1:00:20] um I'm trying to get the people uh to
[1:00:23] understand the word of God.
[1:00:27] in in such a way you would take a higher
[1:00:30] plane.
[1:00:33] Uh I I do believe that we are the bride
[1:00:35] of
[1:00:37] Christ and I do believe that the work
[1:00:40] was finished before the foundation of
[1:00:42] the world.
[1:00:45] We not we're not the only thing that we
[1:00:48] labor to
[1:00:50] do when it come to Christianity and that
[1:00:53] is to enter into his
[1:00:57] rest. I believe that you must understand
[1:01:00] who he
[1:01:02] is. You can't worship a god that you
[1:01:05] don't know.
[1:01:08] I mean, unless you're going to worship
[1:01:10] an idol, something brick or something
[1:01:14] metal or something, some some shrine
[1:01:18] somebody has
[1:01:20] built. But that's not how Jesus
[1:01:24] is. Cuz the word of God said that he he
[1:01:28] said, "Come unto me all ye that are
[1:01:31] laden and heavy laden.
[1:01:35] I will give you rest for your
[1:01:37] soul. He said, I want you to take my
[1:01:40] yoke upon
[1:01:42] you and learn of
[1:01:45] me. Now, when I listen to that word,
[1:01:48] learn of
[1:01:50] me. I I question in my mind, for what
[1:01:54] reason are we to learn of
[1:01:57] him? The Bible says, in the beginning
[1:02:00] was the word.
[1:02:02] The word was with God. Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] Right? And the word was God. The same
[1:02:09] was in the beginning with God.
[1:02:12] And all things were made by
[1:02:14] him and without him was not anything
[1:02:17] made that was
[1:02:19] made. It goes on to
[1:02:21] say that this word was the light of
[1:02:26] men. It was the
[1:02:28] revelation of what a man should be.
[1:02:32] In order to
[1:02:33] learn we of God, we must find out who
[1:02:38] Jesus is,
[1:02:40] who Jesus was,
[1:02:42] and what Jesus means to us.
[1:02:46] If you don't know who he
[1:02:49] is, how can you worship him? I mean, in
[1:02:53] a in an honest
[1:02:54] way, how can you praise
[1:02:57] him if you're not certain of him?
[1:03:02] uh you know we we must understand by the
[1:03:04] grace of
[1:03:05] God revelation is given to the bride of
[1:03:08] Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ. So I want to establish you in
[1:03:12] such a way by the grace of God that you
[1:03:15] will not doubt your salvation ever
[1:03:20] again. First of
[1:03:21] all first of all you didn't call
[1:03:26] yourself. God called you.
[1:03:30] We call it predestination.redestination.
[1:03:33] In other words, he made you who you are.
[1:03:37] He predestinated you,
[1:03:40] right? To be who you
[1:03:42] are. You didn't ask to be a
[1:03:45] son or a daughter of
[1:03:48] God. He chose
[1:03:50] you from the foundation of the world.
[1:03:55] Right? You were born a sinner in this
[1:03:58] world.
[1:04:00] You didn't know
[1:04:01] him. But God came to you.
[1:04:05] You didn't come to God. God came to you.
[1:04:09] And I want you to understand, in all of
[1:04:11] your faulty
[1:04:14] ways, God made provisions for
[1:04:17] you. Right? See, you can do all the
[1:04:22] righteous things you want to.
[1:04:26] But it'll never measure up
[1:04:29] uh to a place where you could purchase
[1:04:31] your
[1:04:33] salvation. Y'all understand me? It it
[1:04:36] doesn't matter how faithful you are to
[1:04:39] church, how faithful you are to your
[1:04:43] duties. That's not
[1:04:45] it. Your salvation
[1:04:48] hinges only upon the work of God.
[1:04:52] It's not what you do for him,
[1:04:55] but it's what he's done for
[1:04:57] you. Now, you must come to a
[1:05:00] place that you really believe that.
[1:05:05] You understand me? Because if you go
[1:05:08] about with
[1:05:10] works, you're going to continually be a
[1:05:13] a condemned
[1:05:16] Christian. Y'all better hear what I'm
[1:05:18] saying? Because none of us can work in
[1:05:21] such a perfected
[1:05:23] way.
[1:05:25] Hallelujah. Jesus himself was the only
[1:05:28] one that could could work in a perfected
[1:05:32] way. Is that right? The Bible said that
[1:05:35] Jesus said, "Father, everything you told
[1:05:38] me to
[1:05:40] do, I've done it." Amen. And none of us
[1:05:43] can say that
[1:05:45] today. It doesn't matter how long you've
[1:05:47] been a Christian.
[1:05:49] But none of us have lived it
[1:05:52] perfectly. Not on our
[1:05:55] own. This is why
[1:05:57] people don't understand
[1:06:00] Jesus. People see
[1:06:03] Christians, laboring to be
[1:06:06] righteous, and then they try to labor to
[1:06:08] be
[1:06:10] righteous and then they find themselves
[1:06:13] falling all the
[1:06:15] time. And so in their mind,
[1:06:19] They say I can't live a Christian
[1:06:22] life. I know what I'm talking about. My
[1:06:26] mother was a Christian. I tried to p her
[1:06:29] pattern her Christian
[1:06:31] walk. But every
[1:06:33] weekend, every vow I made during the
[1:06:37] week was broken.
[1:06:40] Hallelujah. I had no control of
[1:06:45] myself and I did not know that there
[1:06:48] were false spirits in me
[1:06:51] controlling me. Y'all understand me?
[1:06:57] So we got to come to understand not in
[1:07:00] our
[1:07:01] heads but in our
[1:07:04] hearts this where Jesus
[1:07:07] resides in your heart. If all you have
[1:07:11] is an intellectual revelation of this
[1:07:16] message, you're going to be a very
[1:07:18] unhappy soul.
[1:07:25] You got to
[1:07:26] believe that you are now sitting in
[1:07:29] heavenly places
[1:07:33] in Christ Jesus.
[1:07:38] That's very important
[1:07:41] because if you believe you're in
[1:07:42] heavenly places in Christ,
[1:07:46] your center of focus will be on Jesus
[1:07:48] himself.
[1:07:50] You will have a positive
[1:07:54] faith instead of a hope.
[1:07:58] Is that right?
[1:08:00] I mean it's like the prophet God
[1:08:02] described it.
[1:08:05] Electricity is around everywhere
[1:08:12] and we could say electricity electricity
[1:08:16] come and cut these lights on
[1:08:20] and you can say oh electricity
[1:08:23] electricity
[1:08:25] and though the electricity is
[1:08:28] there it's not going to move.
[1:08:31] You're wasting your energy. Can I say it
[1:08:34] like that? So that you'll know I'm
[1:08:37] talking about God.
[1:08:39] God is everywhere. We'll say amen. We
[1:08:43] say God is omnipotent.
[1:08:46] Amen. Amen. God is Jehovah.
[1:08:49] Amen. But there's a system.
[1:08:53] There's a way that you must tap into
[1:08:55] that.
[1:08:56] Right. Right? You know, we we know how,
[1:09:00] you know, when it when they when when it
[1:09:02] excuse me come to electricity,
[1:09:04] scientists had to find a way
[1:09:08] to bring that invisible source
[1:09:14] to the to the visible.
[1:09:16] Is that right? They say Benjamin
[1:09:18] Franklin,
[1:09:20] he was one that did that.
[1:09:23] Hallelujah. And while he was trying to
[1:09:25] make it happen, People thought he was
[1:09:29] crazy.
[1:09:31] So is it with a real
[1:09:33] Christian? We know the energy is
[1:09:37] there. We know the source is there.
[1:09:41] Hallelujah. But we must find that
[1:09:45] way to be in that
[1:09:48] position where it will come to
[1:09:52] us naturally supernatural.
[1:09:55] Can I say it like that?
[1:09:57] naturally supernatural
[1:10:00] because when you're born of God, when
[1:10:02] you have the Holy Spirit, you're no
[1:10:05] longer just natural.
[1:10:08] You become supernatural.
[1:10:10] And the reason being not is because the
[1:10:14] supernatural God is on the inside of
[1:10:17] you.
[1:10:20] Now we know
[1:10:22] that we are
[1:10:25] the chosen of God.
[1:10:27] Revelation 17:14,
[1:10:31] please see without the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:34] you won't be able to make the
[1:10:35] connection.
[1:10:39] It's like having a hot iron
[1:10:43] with a plug.
[1:10:45] And you want to iron, but you got to
[1:10:46] plug it up
[1:10:48] first before the heat comes into the
[1:10:50] iron.
[1:10:53] Can I say it like that? You and I need a
[1:10:55] real
[1:10:57] connection. It's not enough to be in a
[1:11:00] church or to be a church member. You got
[1:11:03] to make connection by the Holy
[1:11:06] Spirit. Is that right? You said, "Well,
[1:11:09] wait a minute, Brother Brooks. You see,
[1:11:11] let me say this about about the
[1:11:13] disciples.
[1:11:14] You know, the disciples were able to
[1:11:16] cast out devils
[1:11:18] in the
[1:11:19] name before they ever went to
[1:11:23] Pentecost. Even Judas was able to do
[1:11:26] it. So, we know that's that's not the
[1:11:29] full
[1:11:32] connection." Is that right? Why? Because
[1:11:35] Jesus said to them, "After which the
[1:11:37] Holy Ghost has come upon you, you shall
[1:11:40] receive power." That is the connection.
[1:11:43] And brother said that connection is the
[1:11:47] authority because none of us have it of
[1:11:50] ourselves. But once we put on the
[1:11:52] uniform of the Holy
[1:11:55] Spirit, all demons in
[1:11:57] hell and the angels of heaven
[1:12:01] must hear the voice of a son and
[1:12:03] daughter of God.
[1:12:06] Amen.
[1:12:09] Is that right? Oh, it's the truth.
[1:12:12] Daniel said he prayed 21
[1:12:15] days and I believe it was Gabriel or
[1:12:18] Michael, one of the two said, "We heard
[1:12:20] your
[1:12:21] prayer when you first
[1:12:23] prayed." Hallelujah. But I thought you
[1:12:26] pray to
[1:12:28] God. But you
[1:12:30] do. But God is the captain of the Lord's
[1:12:34] host. So when you pray to him, he
[1:12:37] dispatched the angels to fix your
[1:12:39] problem.
[1:12:43] That's the way it works.
[1:12:46] Position.
[1:12:47] We're not just
[1:12:50] down here coming out like a worm,
[1:12:54] but God has changed you.
[1:12:56] I want you to bride of Christ. God has
[1:12:59] changed
[1:13:00] you. Your greatest battle we know is in
[1:13:03] your
[1:13:03] mind. You must defeat your
[1:13:08] mind. Amen. Your mind will always make
[1:13:11] you
[1:13:12] fleshly if you're not if you're not
[1:13:16] truly born
[1:13:17] again. But when you truly got
[1:13:20] something, you have a battle every
[1:13:23] day. But I believe that the true
[1:13:26] Christian can be
[1:13:28] victoriously every
[1:13:31] day coming from position of a believer
[1:13:33] in
[1:13:35] Christ. 1955
[1:13:39] God by so sovereign election
[1:13:44] call you into this wonderful
[1:13:47] fellowship. You lost all your pride and
[1:13:51] everything. You lost all your
[1:13:55] dances big
[1:13:59] parties. Come come lovely into Lord
[1:14:03] Jesus. But God predestinated you
[1:14:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:11] to be a fellow citizen
[1:14:14] of the kingdom of
[1:14:15] God. That's right. Right. Amen. He said
[1:14:19] those who he called,
[1:14:21] those who he
[1:14:23] forneew, he justified.
[1:14:26] Is that right? Those who he
[1:14:29] forneew he glorified.
[1:14:32] So you got to understand
[1:14:34] When God see you when you see receive
[1:14:38] the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:40] you're perfect.
[1:14:42] Amen. Amen. Your carnal mind can't
[1:14:45] receive that.
[1:14:47] That has to be by
[1:14:49] revelation because your f your
[1:14:51] perfection doesn't come by your
[1:14:53] works. It comes by the blood of Jesus
[1:14:57] Christ. You can't get to heaven being a
[1:15:00] sinner.
[1:15:01] And you can't be half holy.
[1:15:04] Hallelujah. So, how am I going to be
[1:15:07] holy? How will I be accepted into heaven
[1:15:11] outside of the blood of Jesus? Is that
[1:15:14] right? Oh, come on. So, you understand
[1:15:17] me?
[1:15:18] Maybe we got some visitors in there that
[1:15:20] listen. In the Old
[1:15:22] Testament, when a man
[1:15:25] sinned, he brought forth a lamb,
[1:15:28] and that lamb had to be without spot,
[1:15:31] wrinkle, or blemish.
[1:15:33] couldn't be sick. It had to be a perfect
[1:15:36] lamb.
[1:15:38] And guess what? It was the priest
[1:15:41] that examined the lamb.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah. He turned that that fur
[1:15:47] over, went spot by spot, space by space,
[1:15:51] rather. And that lamb had to be perfect.
[1:15:55] He never looked at the man.
[1:15:59] He never looked at the woman.
[1:16:02] Who brought the lamb?
[1:16:04] Because it was a lamb that died in
[1:16:07] yourstead.
[1:16:08] Somebody help me here. If the lamb was
[1:16:11] perfect,
[1:16:13] you were perfect.
[1:16:16] Y'all hear what I'm saying? It was a
[1:16:18] lamb that that makes God able to forgive
[1:16:21] you because he died in yourstead.
[1:16:26] Oh yes, sir. That's why we preach Jesus
[1:16:30] because he is the perfect lamb of God
[1:16:34] and because of his blood.
[1:16:37] I stand perfect.
[1:16:40] Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] You stand perfect if you can receive it.
[1:16:46] The whole world was saved by
[1:16:48] Jesus. But the whole world will not be
[1:16:51] saved because they won't accept their
[1:16:54] perpetuation.
[1:16:58] You understand me? You got to have
[1:17:01] positive faith in here.
[1:17:03] You can't have hope like, "Oh, oh, come
[1:17:05] on, electricity. Come on,
[1:17:07] electricity." Electricity. Positive
[1:17:09] faith turns it on.
[1:17:12] Hallelujah. It's not a hope. It's a no.
[1:17:16] It is a possession.
[1:17:19] Right. That's what real faith is. I got
[1:17:22] it. I got it. It's something about this
[1:17:26] Holy Ghost. I can't explain it, but I
[1:17:29] got it.
[1:17:31] It's something I
[1:17:33] possess. Something you possess. I can't
[1:17:36] explain it. You can't explain it. But
[1:17:38] it's real. It's a real
[1:17:42] connection. Hallelujah. To the world. We
[1:17:45] look
[1:17:45] crazy. But that's okay.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah. I want to I always think
[1:17:51] about John the Baptist. I always think
[1:17:54] about who would have followed John.
[1:17:56] A half-dressed
[1:17:59] man
[1:18:00] half-dressed
[1:18:03] man eating bugs,
[1:18:06] locustes
[1:18:08] and
[1:18:10] honey. Amen. I've always been curious
[1:18:12] about that
[1:18:17] combination because it was real.
[1:18:21] And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:18:24] today, and forever.
[1:18:27] How many would have followed Moses?
[1:18:30] He was a murderer.
[1:18:35] How many would have followed him? Who
[1:18:37] would have followed David who was an
[1:18:39] adulteresser?
[1:18:44] You understand what I'm saying? God
[1:18:47] takes those
[1:18:49] nobodies. God takes those
[1:18:51] nobodies. God take the scum of the earth
[1:18:54] and make something out of them.
[1:18:57] Hallelujah. Is that the truth?
[1:19:00] Hallelujah. He had a
[1:19:01] reputation. Jesus did. And that
[1:19:04] reputation still stands.
[1:19:07] He hung out with the
[1:19:09] [Laughter]
[1:19:12] hoodlams. Oh my god. He hung out with
[1:19:15] the rejects.
[1:19:17] And I don't mind being a reject of the
[1:19:19] world.
[1:19:21] Oh, come on. Somebody think about it.
[1:19:24] He's just in the positive of of a
[1:19:26] believer position of a believer. Now, I
[1:19:30] don't mean to be belittling
[1:19:32] them. I respect that. But they're
[1:19:36] supposed to be up
[1:19:39] here. We supposed to be up
[1:19:41] here. Here they are way down here.
[1:19:46] But do you know what it
[1:19:48] is? Is hope instead of
[1:19:51] faith. Faith does the job right
[1:19:55] now. Hope hopes for
[1:19:59] it. But faith is the product.
[1:20:03] Faith really does it. See, we have a lot
[1:20:08] of hope, but not much
[1:20:10] faith. So, we want to change from hope
[1:20:14] today to positive
[1:20:16] faith. And there's only one way we can
[1:20:19] get positive
[1:20:22] faith and that's by positive
[1:20:25] thinking of positive things.
[1:20:30] Is that true?
[1:20:31] Nobody likes being around a negative
[1:20:34] Christian.
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:38] Always speaking negative.
[1:20:41] You you you you you you you got the
[1:20:43] report of all the things that going on
[1:20:44] in the
[1:20:46] church. This ain't right. This ain't
[1:20:50] right. And I'm going to tell you
[1:20:51] something. You ain't right
[1:20:53] either. If that's all you can do is talk
[1:20:56] about negative
[1:20:58] stuff. Hallelujah. God ain't negative,
[1:21:02] God is positive.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah. And when you under that
[1:21:07] negative spirit that is not the Holy
[1:21:10] Ghost. Hallelujah. If you say you're a
[1:21:13] son of God, if you say you're a daughter
[1:21:16] of God, why don't you change the
[1:21:19] atmosphere? Change the
[1:21:21] situation. Hallelujah. It doesn't take
[1:21:24] but one person
[1:21:27] with the
[1:21:28] faith of God that can change the whole
[1:21:32] thing.
[1:21:35] It don't take it doesn't take a group.
[1:21:38] But I'm telling you when you when you
[1:21:40] down here talking about all that
[1:21:42] negative stuff, you'll never come up
[1:21:44] here.
[1:21:46] Heavenly places is positive.
[1:21:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now only the
[1:21:51] whole world was full of electricity
[1:21:56] and you're setting out in a big dark
[1:21:59] field in the night time.
[1:22:02] Like I said earlier, you can call on
[1:22:04] electricity all you want
[1:22:07] to. But if you haven't you haven't
[1:22:10] designed a system to connect with that
[1:22:12] electricity and bring it to you in this
[1:22:15] dimension, you are wasting your time.
[1:22:20] Is that right? How many of y'all know
[1:22:22] how to spark a fire?
[1:22:25] You can have you can have two
[1:22:27] stones. You can have the
[1:22:30] equipment to spark a fire.
[1:22:33] But if you don't put faith in
[1:22:35] it and it takes faith, don't it,
[1:22:37] brother? Cuz sometime those rocks don't
[1:22:39] want to spark just right. Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] But you can't give up on it. You got to
[1:22:44] keep striking it.
[1:22:47] You know how it works.
[1:22:49] Amen. And then you're going to get some
[1:22:51] fire.
[1:22:53] Y'all understand what I'm saying? You
[1:22:55] can't just give up on God. Well, I'm
[1:22:57] just waiting on him. You got to do
[1:22:59] something.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. Just like they say, if you
[1:23:05] call on Jesus, he will answer prayer.
[1:23:09] I know that to be right. Hallelujah.
[1:23:12] Hallelujah. See, you got to understand
[1:23:16] if you're you're inside of Christ and
[1:23:19] walking, then all the things of the
[1:23:21] world passes
[1:23:23] away. All the great creeds that you had
[1:23:26] of this
[1:23:28] thing or that thing is all vanish away.
[1:23:32] You understand what I'm saying? You
[1:23:34] can't
[1:23:36] remain a
[1:23:38] condition of negativity
[1:23:41] and expect
[1:23:43] to be a powerhouse in
[1:23:47] God. Amen. You create your
[1:23:51] atmosphere atmosphere by being positive.
[1:23:54] I don't care what goes and what comes.
[1:23:58] Oh, you say brother books. Well, take
[1:24:01] Joe for an example.
[1:24:03] I was reading that to my grandson this
[1:24:05] morning and I think it was a Sunday
[1:24:07] school lesson. No matter what he kept
[1:24:10] what what what came his way, he lost his
[1:24:13] cattle, he lost his uh camels, he lost
[1:24:16] his servants. It was one thing after
[1:24:19] another. He lost his children. And then
[1:24:23] he
[1:24:23] declared, "Naked I came into the
[1:24:26] world and naked I leave.
[1:24:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:24:34] Amen. See, that's the attitude.
[1:24:37] That is the connection. When you have
[1:24:39] God, you know that all things work
[1:24:42] together. I may not understand it, but
[1:24:46] it's working for my good
[1:24:48] somewhere. Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] Yes, sir.
[1:24:53] When Keith
[1:24:55] passed, I gave his family the I think
[1:24:58] it's Isaiah
[1:24:59] 57 where the righteous perish and people
[1:25:04] don't understand
[1:25:05] why. But but the scripture said that God
[1:25:09] is protecting
[1:25:11] them from the evil that is to
[1:25:14] come. He laid them in their
[1:25:17] bed. But there coming a time he going to
[1:25:19] wake them
[1:25:21] up. Y'all understand me? And I I this
[1:25:24] might sound crazy, but I'll say it like
[1:25:28] this. Before God allow me to be
[1:25:31] lost. I'd rather he put me to
[1:25:35] sleep. Y'all understand me? I I don't
[1:25:38] love the world like
[1:25:43] that. Jesus, we all desire to go
[1:25:46] sometime,
[1:25:48] but it's only pro uh it's only God's
[1:25:50] will that we stay.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So when the
[1:25:54] things pass away, when everything
[1:25:57] vanishes away and your heart and mind
[1:26:02] become singular on Christ
[1:26:07] Jesus, that shows you have died to
[1:26:11] yourself and you're born again.
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:16] Help us, Jesus.
[1:26:20] Single
[1:26:24] singleminded. Y'all done met people like
[1:26:26] that
[1:26:26] before. All they want to do is talk
[1:26:28] about Jesus.
[1:26:30] And those the kind of Christian most
[1:26:32] people don't want to be around. Not even
[1:26:33] Christians. That's all you got to talk
[1:26:36] about. That's all I want to talk about.
[1:26:39] If I talk about something else, I'm
[1:26:40] going to go into negativity because this
[1:26:43] world offers nothing but negative stuff.
[1:26:49] Oh, come on. The Lord had to correct me
[1:26:51] even even when it came to the
[1:26:53] presidential
[1:26:55] election. Some say I'm this and some say
[1:26:57] I'm that. Hallelujah. Oh, and some
[1:27:00] criticize this one and some criticize
[1:27:02] that
[1:27:03] one. You better be careful because the
[1:27:06] Bible said in Jude, it's the evil ones
[1:27:10] that speak evil of the dignities.
[1:27:18] When you speak of evil,
[1:27:20] No matter who God put up there,
[1:27:24] God had a purpose.
[1:27:27] You can call, oh, look at Hitler.
[1:27:31] Was God using Hitler?
[1:27:34] Y'all say the devil did it. No, it was
[1:27:37] it was in the Bible. It was written in
[1:27:40] the word.
[1:27:44] Maybe his name ain't was there, but the
[1:27:45] spirit was there.
[1:27:48] Y'all understand me?
[1:27:52] Oh, y'all get quiet. I'm not glorifying
[1:27:55] Hitler. I'm glorifying God.
[1:27:58] Cuz God is the be God is the beginning
[1:28:01] and the end. He's the first and the
[1:28:02] last. Hallelujah. Everything moves by
[1:28:06] the power of God.
[1:28:08] Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] Which is God evil?
[1:28:13] when he went down to Egypt
[1:28:15] and he made the task
[1:28:18] masters put a greater burden on the
[1:28:21] Egypt on on Israel.
[1:28:23] No, he wasn't evil. But he knew that was
[1:28:26] the only way he could get them to cry
[1:28:30] out and sometimes you God put stuff on
[1:28:34] you because he knows that's the only way
[1:28:37] he going to get you to humble
[1:28:40] yourself. We're stubborn by
[1:28:43] nature. We take it takes God to humble
[1:28:46] us. And listen, really, you don't want
[1:28:49] God to humble you.
[1:28:55] Brother Brandham call that the tender
[1:28:57] hand of
[1:28:59] Jehovah. And if that was tender, I don't
[1:29:02] know what's coming our way.
[1:29:05] You love the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:29:08] Hallelujah. I'm I'm I'm saying by the
[1:29:11] grace of God and I can't I can't give
[1:29:12] you
[1:29:13] revelation. I can only preach to you
[1:29:15] what God wants me to preach to you. And
[1:29:18] perhaps by preaching what I'm preaching,
[1:29:20] there will come a thirst in you for a
[1:29:24] higher
[1:29:25] plane, Lord. I want to live closer to
[1:29:29] you. Right? You know what I heard in the
[1:29:32] word the other day? Cuz I thought the
[1:29:35] greater works
[1:29:37] were just limbs growing back. Limbs
[1:29:40] growing back.
[1:29:44] Arms and legs growing back. Oh,
[1:29:47] okay. I I thought you know those that
[1:29:51] kind of a miracle.
[1:29:53] Brother Brandham said it like this. He
[1:29:56] said the greater works is winning souls
[1:29:58] to Christ.
[1:30:01] Everything else going to perish.
[1:30:05] Right? That's what it says in
[1:30:06] Corinthians.
[1:30:08] Right? You can have prophecy. You can
[1:30:11] have faith to move mountains. You can do
[1:30:13] it all. Without charity, it it means
[1:30:16] nothing.
[1:30:18] Hallelujah. Charity is what? The Holy
[1:30:20] Spirit.
[1:30:24] So all your religious activity means
[1:30:26] nothing to
[1:30:27] God if you don't receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:32] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You say,
[1:30:33] "Well, Lord, I want it." Well, the Bible
[1:30:35] said, "Repent, be baptized in the name
[1:30:37] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:30:39] your sins, and you shall receive
[1:30:43] it." Hallelujah. I'm working with the
[1:30:46] riches of God. We're the most wealthiest
[1:30:48] people in the world, but you'll never
[1:30:51] ever know
[1:30:52] it. Hallelujah. You remember the
[1:30:55] story about this old lady who had a son
[1:30:59] in the military overseas.
[1:31:03] and he was sending her checks every
[1:31:06] month. She didn't know. She thought the
[1:31:09] checks were just pretty pictures, like
[1:31:12] postcards.
[1:31:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And one day, she
[1:31:17] came to find out that those checks
[1:31:20] weren't post cards. They were
[1:31:22] checks. She had all of this money saved
[1:31:25] up
[1:31:28] and didn't know it. See, that's how it
[1:31:31] is with a Christian. You got all of
[1:31:33] these riches, all of this money, all of
[1:31:36] this way of exchange,
[1:31:39] but you sit there like you don't know
[1:31:40] what it
[1:31:42] is. It's
[1:31:44] God. And the Bible said that God owns a
[1:31:47] cattle on a thousand
[1:31:49] hills. Hallelujah. There's none
[1:31:52] righteous than God. He owns heaven and
[1:31:55] earth.
[1:31:57] Hallelujah. And don't look at me like
[1:31:59] I'm crazy. The prophet of God said we
[1:32:01] ask for too little.
[1:32:04] We ask for too little. And the reason
[1:32:07] why we ask for little because we've got
[1:32:09] little faith.
[1:32:11] Hallelujah. You need to venture
[1:32:14] out. Get up a little
[1:32:19] higher. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:23] Oh God help
[1:32:25] us. Amen. Cuz you said, "Well, it hadn't
[1:32:29] worked." Well, you didn't. You quit.
[1:32:32] God don't quit.
[1:32:37] He may not come when you want him, but
[1:32:39] he's right on time.
[1:32:46] Y'all don't know that song.
[1:32:50] That's one of them runaway songs,
[1:32:53] but it's true.
[1:32:55] He comes, but he comes in his own time.
[1:33:00] That's where we fail to see it. Jo said,
[1:33:03] "I'm going to
[1:33:04] wait till my change come." Hallelujah. I
[1:33:08] done put in my order. I done put in my
[1:33:12] request. I know it's coming. I'm going
[1:33:15] to wait on it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:18] That's what That's the way. You can't
[1:33:20] doubt it. You got to believe it. And you
[1:33:23] know, you have to praise God sometimes.
[1:33:26] Even though it hadn't manifest itself
[1:33:28] yet, you got to praise God for it.
[1:33:31] Hallelujah.
[1:33:33] See, listen. God is the fountain of all
[1:33:37] grace and
[1:33:41] power and of all divine
[1:33:44] wisdom is in God. So therefore, knowing
[1:33:48] that he is the only creator there is,
[1:33:54] only only creator. He's the only living
[1:33:57] God.
[1:33:59] There is no other creator but God.
[1:34:03] Satan cannot create at all.
[1:34:06] He only perverts what's been
[1:34:09] created. But God is the only creator.
[1:34:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me tell
[1:34:16] y'all something about my old mama.
[1:34:19] I bring her up sometime because she
[1:34:21] taught me a lot of things. We were poor
[1:34:24] and my mother grew up as a a a single
[1:34:27] mom and there were there were times we
[1:34:30] didn't have food, but one thing my
[1:34:32] mother was a praying
[1:34:34] woman. And whenever God showed her
[1:34:36] something, she didn't keep it to
[1:34:39] herself. She said, "Junior, I know
[1:34:42] you're hungry, but God going to bring us
[1:34:44] some food before the day
[1:34:46] out." I say, "Yeah, mama." I did. I
[1:34:49] believed her. I believed her. I opened
[1:34:51] that back door just going out to
[1:34:54] play. And on our back porch at that
[1:34:58] time was three big old bags of
[1:35:01] groceries. Maybe that don't affect you.
[1:35:05] But you had to be mean to understand
[1:35:07] what I'm talking about. Hallelujah. Here
[1:35:10] it is. My mother. And to this day, we
[1:35:12] never knew who said it there.
[1:35:15] We have no idea who brought the
[1:35:17] groceries.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. You know, some of y'all
[1:35:22] worry about paying bills. What's wrong
[1:35:24] with you? You worry about it. Talk to
[1:35:28] God about
[1:35:30] it. Hallelujah. But so many we we so we
[1:35:33] we we can't be proud too proud to bend
[1:35:36] the knee. You got to get still with him.
[1:35:39] You got to make the connection. And when
[1:35:42] you can make that connection that you
[1:35:45] can get off of your knees with peace in
[1:35:47] your heart, you wait on God cuz it's
[1:35:51] coming.
[1:35:53] Hallelujah. Amen. I know what I'm
[1:35:55] talking
[1:35:56] about. I'm not talking about something I
[1:35:58] don't know. I'm talking about something
[1:36:00] I have
[1:36:01] exercised. I'm preaching to you
[1:36:03] something that I know and I know that
[1:36:06] God will do it for you,
[1:36:08] too. Amen.
[1:36:10] Oh yeah.
[1:36:13] Hallelujah. I done asked y'all many
[1:36:15] times, how many of y'all have ridden in
[1:36:17] a car with a the needle unpass the
[1:36:22] E? I keep on
[1:36:25] going
[1:36:27] praying and it takes me where I need to
[1:36:29] go. It's been a while, but I have a
[1:36:34] testimony. And I'm telling you
[1:36:36] something, people of God, you got to
[1:36:38] understand this is a supernatural being
[1:36:42] living on the inside of you. And all he
[1:36:45] needs is that real faith to make that
[1:36:47] connection.
[1:36:54] Can I tell you one more thing? One more
[1:36:56] testimony. It's not even in my notes,
[1:36:59] but my wife, one of our first houses we
[1:37:03] bought, it was almost like a scam. It
[1:37:05] was so bad.
[1:37:08] When we moved in that house after we
[1:37:11] moved in, we found a lot of
[1:37:14] problems. So, we left
[1:37:17] it. And you know, when you leave a
[1:37:19] house,
[1:37:21] uh uh uh it goes on your record,
[1:37:25] but I needed a new house. I needed
[1:37:26] another house.
[1:37:28] So I said, "Lord, you know, I'll take
[1:37:31] care of this,
[1:37:33] but I need you to block these people."
[1:37:37] That's what I said. I need you to block
[1:37:39] that that uh what that
[1:37:41] report so I can get me a
[1:37:45] house. I said, "Lord, you do that for
[1:37:47] me. Once I get my my new house, I'll
[1:37:51] make sure I'll take care of this one."
[1:37:55] My wife is a
[1:37:56] witness. They they search all of
[1:38:00] the reports, everything, they couldn't
[1:38:03] find a thing.
[1:38:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They couldn't if
[1:38:09] if I had not called them to tell
[1:38:12] them, they still would have been lost.
[1:38:16] Y'all hear what I'm saying? I'm telling
[1:38:18] you, telling you the truth.
[1:38:22] I had to call the
[1:38:24] people and then when I called them they
[1:38:27] searched it and found it
[1:38:30] and yes for seven years it was on my on
[1:38:32] my credit report and then you know after
[1:38:35] seven years it disappeared
[1:38:42] y'all look
[1:38:44] I'm just telling y'all something folks
[1:38:47] I'm telling you what my God did for me
[1:38:50] and I know my He'll do it for you, too.
[1:38:56] He'll do it for you, too. Hallelujah.
[1:39:01] Therefore, he created by his
[1:39:04] word. He sent his word. So all the
[1:39:09] seas that he had placed upon the earth,
[1:39:12] he formed those seeds by his own
[1:39:14] word. For there's no nothing else to
[1:39:18] make the seed out of. He had placed them
[1:39:23] and they were beneath the water.
[1:39:26] And he said, "Let there
[1:39:28] be." Now, let me say it like this. Let
[1:39:30] me just bring it like this. We were
[1:39:33] beneath the water. And when I say
[1:39:35] beneath the water, we were beneath the
[1:39:37] people. We were mixed in with
[1:39:40] everything.
[1:39:41] But when God called us,
[1:39:46] when he How come you know that this
[1:39:49] message is
[1:39:51] right? It ain't because you studied it,
[1:39:55] but there was something that made you
[1:39:57] say,
[1:39:58] "Amen." Hallelujah. You may not be
[1:40:01] living like an
[1:40:02] angel, but you know that you know that
[1:40:06] you know that this is right. Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] and you do your best to live
[1:40:12] it. Are you doing your best to live it?
[1:40:16] Because you've been ordained to live it.
[1:40:20] Hallelujah. And right now, we need to
[1:40:22] make that
[1:40:24] connection. And I'm I'm I don't mean to
[1:40:26] scream, but I can't hardly help it.
[1:40:29] We've been we're being led by the same
[1:40:30] pillar of
[1:40:33] fire. That led Moses.
[1:40:36] Somebody help me here. Yeah. the same
[1:40:39] pillar of fire.
[1:40:41] But listen to this. Moses was called to
[1:40:45] be the deliverer.
[1:40:49] Hallelujah. Is that the truth? Had not
[1:40:52] yet met the pillar of
[1:40:53] fire. So he tried to do what he was
[1:40:56] ordained to
[1:40:57] do without the pillar of fire. Y'all
[1:41:01] better hear what I'm saying. So is the
[1:41:03] message believer us. Many of us are
[1:41:06] trying to do what we've been ordained to
[1:41:10] do without the pillar of fire.
[1:41:15] You can't do
[1:41:16] it. What did Moses
[1:41:18] produce? A dead man. And that's exactly
[1:41:22] what happens to us. We know it's the
[1:41:25] truth. We try to make it
[1:41:28] happen. Oh, but it'll never happen until
[1:41:31] you make that real connection.
[1:41:34] Hallelujah. You understand what I'm
[1:41:37] saying? When Moses met the burning
[1:41:40] bush, it was there. Moses realized what
[1:41:44] was in the bush is what he was
[1:41:48] lacking. Y'all hear what I'm saying? And
[1:41:51] that pillar of fire is nothing but the
[1:41:53] Holy
[1:41:54] Ghost. Glory to God. And if the Holy
[1:41:58] Ghost can make a bush
[1:42:01] holy, what about you?
[1:42:06] can make the dirt that Moses stood on
[1:42:09] holy. What about you? Hallelujah. It
[1:42:13] ain't the dirt, but it's a holy God on
[1:42:16] the dirt.
[1:42:18] Hallelujah. Y'all better hear what I'm
[1:42:20] saying. That same
[1:42:23] covenant, God came to deliver us. This
[1:42:27] is the third exodus.
[1:42:29] Come on, somebody. And that pillar of
[1:42:32] fire has formed himself into the
[1:42:38] word. That's why we needed Malachi 4.
[1:42:42] That's why we need Revelation 10:7. We
[1:42:45] needed a Moses for
[1:42:48] our body who could hear the word of
[1:42:51] God. It doesn't matter what people say
[1:42:54] about us. You've got to come to a place.
[1:42:57] You've got to make that connection.
[1:43:00] You know, you know that you've been
[1:43:03] chosen by God. You know that. But you're
[1:43:07] lacking the power. You're lacking the
[1:43:11] strength. You're lacking that
[1:43:14] connection. God told Moses, "Take off
[1:43:17] your
[1:43:18] shoes. The ground you standing on is
[1:43:21] holy." That mean Moses had to humble
[1:43:24] himself. You better hear what I'm
[1:43:26] saying. He had to humble himself.
[1:43:29] And I say this to you. In
[1:43:33] order for God to make it work for you,
[1:43:36] you got to humble yourself.
[1:43:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my God. Amen.
[1:43:44] I don't usually get the actual, but I
[1:43:47] had to just now.
[1:43:49] I want you to understand by the grace of
[1:43:51] God, we we we're not worshiping a Moses,
[1:43:56] but we worshiping the one he saw in the
[1:43:57] bush.
[1:43:59] He said, "Who who shall I say sent me?"
[1:44:03] He say, "Say say I am sent me." I am
[1:44:07] that I am. Hello. And guess what? He's
[1:44:11] still I am. You say, "Well, what do you
[1:44:14] mean I am? I am in brother Brooks. I'm
[1:44:18] in Brother Isaac." Y'all understand me?
[1:44:21] I am in Sister Rachel. I am in her. I'm
[1:44:25] am in you.
[1:44:28] Can you imagine how many names he would
[1:44:30] have if he used all of us?
[1:44:33] So all he could say was I am
[1:44:38] you love the Lord. God chosen place of
[1:44:42] worship.
[1:44:44] You know it doesn't matter. Let me say
[1:44:46] it like this. When it comes to Malachi
[1:44:49] 4, it's a
[1:44:53] revelation. People can't see it. And
[1:44:57] don't don't blame them. You can't make a
[1:44:59] person see.
[1:45:01] Yeah. Yeah. You can't make them see. You
[1:45:03] can't you just That's the way it works.
[1:45:06] But if they truly born of God,
[1:45:10] they even might get upset a bit, but God
[1:45:12] will bring them to
[1:45:15] it. You see, they prove that
[1:45:17] scripturally.
[1:45:18] Saul said, "I'mma kill them all."
[1:45:21] Saul said, "I'mma kill them all.
[1:45:25] and he would have, but that wasn't his
[1:45:28] connection. It wasn't what God wanted
[1:45:31] him to do. He did
[1:45:33] it. But one day, God made a
[1:45:36] connection on the road to
[1:45:39] Damascus. That light came
[1:45:42] down, that same pillar of
[1:45:45] fire. And Paul said, "Who art thou,
[1:45:48] Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus.
[1:45:52] I'm Jesus who you persecute. Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] But when did Paul persecute Jesus?
[1:45:59] When he persecuted his people.
[1:46:03] As you have done to the least of these,
[1:46:06] you've done it unto me.
[1:46:08] Hallelujah. So God's chosen place to
[1:46:11] worship is Jesus Christ.
[1:46:15] Excuse me.
[1:46:17] We don't have shrines.
[1:46:21] We don't have holy places.
[1:46:25] It ain't in the mountain.
[1:46:27] It ain't in Jeffersonville.
[1:46:30] Amen.
[1:46:31] Amen. Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:46:35] Because we worship the true and living
[1:46:38] God and he's everywhere.
[1:46:43] Y'all understand me? The Holy Ghost God
[1:46:46] will give the Holy Ghost to whomever he
[1:46:48] want to give it to.
[1:46:51] You and I have been blessed
[1:46:53] because not only did God give us the
[1:46:55] Holy Ghost,
[1:46:57] but he began to lead us by the pillar of
[1:46:59] fire.
[1:47:01] Hallelujah. Is that right? That's the
[1:47:04] only name God has given for
[1:47:07] salvation. That's what he has named the
[1:47:10] family in
[1:47:11] heaven. And when it's on earth,
[1:47:15] it's Jesus Christ.
[1:47:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you happy to
[1:47:19] be in the family of Jesus Christ?
[1:47:24] Amen. Oh church,
[1:47:27] oh people, sinner
[1:47:29] friends, don't trust in nothing else but
[1:47:33] Jesus Christ. Don't trust in any
[1:47:37] preacher. Oh, I better I better say that
[1:47:39] again. Don't trust in any preacher.
[1:47:44] I don't want you trusting in me. I want
[1:47:46] you trusted in the word.
[1:47:48] Hallelujah.
[1:47:50] Don't trust in any preacher. Don't trust
[1:47:53] in anybody else to save
[1:47:57] you. How much the anointing is all over
[1:48:00] a person? That person cannot save you.
[1:48:05] Hallelujah. Is that right? Even the
[1:48:09] prophet of God couldn't save you. Only
[1:48:11] Jesus Christ saves.
[1:48:14] Trust not any any church,
[1:48:17] any creed,
[1:48:19] any denomination.
[1:48:21] Trust only in Jesus
[1:48:23] Christ. For he is the light of the hour.
[1:48:28] Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] 1965, the chosen place of worship.
[1:48:33] Hallelujah. How you going to argue with
[1:48:35] that one?
[1:48:38] Amen.
[1:48:40] Hallelujah.
[1:48:42] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] God got a time for all things.
[1:48:49] He's got a time
[1:48:52] that we plant corn.
[1:48:55] He's got a time that we plow corn.
[1:49:00] Then at the
[1:49:01] time we'll harvest
[1:49:04] corn the spring rain comes
[1:49:10] the drought through the
[1:49:11] summer the fall rains the
[1:49:18] snows you just can't say I plant my
[1:49:22] wheat
[1:49:25] today and tomorrow go out and harvest
[1:49:27] it.
[1:49:29] God has time for
[1:49:32] season. He has season for his word.
[1:49:36] Hallelujah. He has times when the
[1:49:38] scriptures here were it
[1:49:41] said and the presence of the Lord was
[1:49:45] there to heal the
[1:49:47] sick. That's when Jesus was ministering
[1:49:52] too at the presence of the Lord was to
[1:49:55] heal the
[1:49:56] sick. Maybe at another time, the
[1:50:00] presence of the Lord wasn't there to
[1:50:01] heal the sick. Hallelujah. And we find
[1:50:05] out that God works everything
[1:50:09] seasonally.
[1:50:10] Did y'all hear that?
[1:50:13] And now when Moses, what failed to find
[1:50:18] was the time limit of
[1:50:21] God. Then when God reveals himself to
[1:50:24] him in a burning
[1:50:26] bush, he found out
[1:50:28] then that the very thing that was what
[1:50:32] was in burning in the burning bush was
[1:50:35] the thing that he
[1:50:37] lacked. He said and I think that hold a
[1:50:40] lot with us
[1:50:42] today that many times we try to do the
[1:50:45] program
[1:50:46] ourselves and fail to get what was in
[1:50:49] the burning bush.
[1:50:56] the direct
[1:50:57] revelation of the will and the time of
[1:51:01] God. So, let me let me say this and I'm
[1:51:04] not going to be too much much longer.
[1:51:07] We love to dance.
[1:51:10] We love to shout.
[1:51:12] We love to praise God.
[1:51:15] But Pentecost had all of that
[1:51:19] and more of it.
[1:51:22] That's right. You can you can go look on
[1:51:24] the YouTube and you see them folks
[1:51:25] carrying on.
[1:51:29] Hallelujah.
[1:51:30] But after all of
[1:51:32] that, I wonder what they live like.
[1:51:37] It's the life.
[1:51:41] And I'm going tell you, there are people
[1:51:43] in Pentecostal churches
[1:51:46] that are living better than what we live
[1:51:49] by what? The Holy Ghost. Cuz God don't
[1:51:53] God don't God don't um people think,
[1:51:55] well, uh we if it ain't in our church,
[1:51:59] it ain't happening.
[1:52:01] You you deceived.
[1:52:04] God don't care wherever you repent
[1:52:08] when you call on the name of J. Let me
[1:52:10] ask you something. Was brother Brandham
[1:52:11] in a message church when he got the Holy
[1:52:14] Ghost.
[1:52:17] He wasn't even Pentecostal.
[1:52:20] Amen.
[1:52:22] It's wherever you are.
[1:52:24] Oh, y'all getting quiet on me now. That
[1:52:27] just show if you believe that the only
[1:52:28] way you can get the Holy Ghost is be in
[1:52:30] here, you
[1:52:31] are a denomination.
[1:52:42] Man did that. Listen to the message.
[1:52:46] Brother Bradom never said nothing like
[1:52:47] that.
[1:52:50] We did that.
[1:52:54] Instead of letting the shock pull from
[1:52:56] us, we pull from the
[1:53:01] shock. If I'm wrong, you can tell me.
[1:53:04] more. That's what happened. We don't
[1:53:06] love people who's of a denomination or a
[1:53:08] different denomination cuz we feel like
[1:53:10] they lost who they lost.
[1:53:14] You don't know that.
[1:53:17] You don't know who they
[1:53:20] are. I once was
[1:53:22] there. Did I Was I saved then? You
[1:53:25] better believe I was. You know why? My
[1:53:28] salvation didn't come by church.
[1:53:33] My salvation came by the
[1:53:35] word. And before this world began,
[1:53:41] I had mine.
[1:53:45] Y'all understand me? It tears down every
[1:53:48] man's
[1:53:52] theology. Amen. Jesus does.
[1:53:56] Amen. Amen. I'm almost done. People, you
[1:54:00] love the Lord. Amen. I was going to read
[1:54:02] a few things, but I'm not. I'm just
[1:54:03] going to say this by the grace of God.
[1:54:06] Moses, God taught Moses something. He
[1:54:09] told Moses, "You're going to be God unto
[1:54:11] Pharaoh."
[1:54:14] And he
[1:54:15] was. It wasn't a man, but was God in the
[1:54:18] man. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:54:21] When you when God is in you, you become
[1:54:24] the God of this
[1:54:26] generation. I know it's hard for you to
[1:54:28] comprehend it in your mind. I'm not
[1:54:30] saying it in your mind. I'm saying in
[1:54:32] your heart.
[1:54:35] Right? You think about Listen, I don't
[1:54:37] know whether y'all realize it or not,
[1:54:38] but there's somebody praying because a
[1:54:42] lot of these bad storms that were
[1:54:43] supposed to hit
[1:54:45] us. It did not. You know why? There were
[1:54:50] people like me, Brother Rich, and some
[1:54:52] others who were praying that they
[1:54:54] wouldn't
[1:54:56] come. And they didn't come. Now, you
[1:54:59] don't have to believe it, but I believe
[1:55:01] it.
[1:55:04] There was a time I was rushing
[1:55:07] and I needed to get to a place a certain
[1:55:10] time and while I was
[1:55:13] moving, I would tell those red lights,
[1:55:17] "Change,
[1:55:19] change,
[1:55:20] change." And they did.
[1:55:24] Now I probably can't do it again because
[1:55:25] I'm not in a need. But at that time I
[1:55:28] needed to be on time where I was going.
[1:55:31] And those red lights changed for me. It
[1:55:35] was smooth sailing. Y'all understand
[1:55:38] what I'm saying? I believe the word
[1:55:47] you gota That's what God was showing
[1:55:49] Moses.
[1:55:51] God could have just defeated Pharaoh.
[1:55:54] But God gave Moses a
[1:55:57] stick. And Moses had to put his rod his
[1:56:00] his faith in the rod that God gave
[1:56:03] him. Y'all understand me? God took
[1:56:06] something real simple.
[1:56:09] And in the eyes of a of of a king like
[1:56:13] Pharaoh, Moses look stupid.
[1:56:18] A stick.
[1:56:20] You going to conquer Egypt with a rod?
[1:56:24] All my shepherds, they got the same kind
[1:56:26] of
[1:56:28] rod. Hallelujah. But this was a
[1:56:31] different
[1:56:32] one. This one God gave me.
[1:56:37] Hallelujah. And he was teaching Moses
[1:56:40] how to be God to Pharaoh. Oh, come on,
[1:56:44] somebody. So that's what God is doing
[1:56:47] now. Teaching you how to be God in this
[1:56:51] generation.
[1:56:52] not to be a coward.
[1:56:56] Y'all looking at me like crazy. There's
[1:56:58] only one God and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:57:01] Christ, but you're part of him. So much
[1:57:05] so, he called you by his name.
[1:57:10] Thank you, Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:57:14] So, you got to have positive faith.
[1:57:18] I'm just going to shut down here. But
[1:57:21] you know this this the Bible says
[1:57:23] according to Psalms 103,
[1:57:26] bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:57:29] and all that is within me, bless his
[1:57:32] holy name. And then it goes on to say,
[1:57:35] don't forget about his
[1:57:37] benefits. There are benefits in
[1:57:40] Christianity. You hear what I'm saying?
[1:57:42] There are benefits in
[1:57:44] Christianity. Go down the list. He
[1:57:46] health all your diseases.
[1:57:51] All your diseases he heal
[1:57:55] benefits. Read
[1:57:58] it. Your salvation.
[1:58:02] Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] That's what the salvation been given to
[1:58:06] you to enjoy.
[1:58:10] Amen. Had it right. What you want? Let
[1:58:13] me tell you something. Had it right
[1:58:14] could have said anything. Right. She
[1:58:17] wanted the souls of her children. Did
[1:58:18] she get it?
[1:58:21] You say God can't create money. Brother
[1:58:23] Brandham said he would have.
[1:58:30] Hallelujah. If she had asked for it, she
[1:58:34] would have gotten
[1:58:35] it. And if it stands for
[1:58:38] her, it stands for you.
[1:58:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. Don't ever limit God.
[1:58:48] Enjoy your salvation.
[1:58:51] Be
[1:58:52] positive. When somebody speaks something
[1:58:54] negative about you, you kind of hit that
[1:58:57] thing with the
[1:58:59] positive. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:59:01] devil brought something to my mind. I
[1:59:03] think it was this morning. I said, "You
[1:59:06] demon out of
[1:59:08] hell. We talking about a devil fleeing.
[1:59:13] He recognized I knew who I was and that
[1:59:16] thought was my
[1:59:19] thought. You put the devil on the run
[1:59:22] when he brings thoughts that you know
[1:59:24] that is not
[1:59:27] your hallelujah. Don't be nice to him.
[1:59:31] He's your
[1:59:33] enemy. Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] Amen.
[1:59:37] You talk to him like you know who you
[1:59:39] talking to.
[1:59:43] Hallelujah. Don't be
[1:59:46] ringing. This is my
[1:59:50] house. Hallelujah. This is my house.
[1:59:54] This is my house. And you got to talk to
[1:59:56] him like you know it
[1:59:58] is. You have the
[2:00:01] authority. Enjoy the riches of Christ.
[2:00:05] Enjoy the riches of
[2:00:07] Christ. Amen. Let's stand. Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] Enjoy it, people.
[2:00:14] Let's come up higher. Let's start
[2:00:16] enjoying
[2:00:19] Jesus. All the promises he's given us.
[2:00:24] Hallelujah.

[2:06:02] Lord, Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[2:06:04] this service,
[2:06:05] Father. Lord, the word, Father, that you
[2:06:08] give us this afternoon, Father. Lord,
[2:06:11] you knew, Father, that's the word that
[2:06:13] we wanted to hear, Father. You knew,
[2:06:16] Father God, that we were supposed to be
[2:06:18] reminded, Father God, of all those
[2:06:20] things, oh Father, Lord, the benefits we
[2:06:23] have in God. That's why David said that
[2:06:26] I have never seen a righteous being
[2:06:28] forsaken, Father, or his generation
[2:06:30] begging for bread. Lord Jesus, you say
[2:06:32] that you take care of your owns, Father.
[2:06:34] The ones that are the ones that have
[2:06:36] been given to you, Father, you have not
[2:06:38] lost, not even one, Father. Lord, that's
[2:06:42] why we come to you, Father, as needed
[2:06:44] people. Father, Lord, if we ask
[2:06:46] everybody in this room, Father, all of
[2:06:48] us, we do have need. But Lord, we
[2:06:51] believe that you are the Jehovah Gyra.
[2:06:53] Lord, if you were able, Father, to
[2:06:55] create, Father, a lamb out of nowhere,
[2:06:58] Father, in a place where a lamb wouldn't
[2:07:00] be found, Father, for Abraham, Lord, we
[2:07:03] believe, Father God, that you can
[2:07:05] create, Father God, solutions, Lord, for
[2:07:07] our problems, oh God. Lord, if you could
[2:07:10] create money in the belly of a fish,
[2:07:12] Father, when you and Peter needed it,
[2:07:14] Father, Lord, we believe, Father God,
[2:07:15] that you are the same yesterday, today,
[2:07:18] and forever. Lord, the woman, Father
[2:07:20] God, who was losing blood, Father God,
[2:07:22] just by touching the hem of your
[2:07:24] garment, Father, she was able to receive
[2:07:26] her healing, Father God, we believe, oh
[2:07:29] Father, that if we are sick, Father, in
[2:07:31] this place, Father, this moment, oh God,
[2:07:34] we believe that you are still the
[2:07:35] healer, Father. Lord, and you can touch
[2:07:38] every one of us, oh Father, and make us
[2:07:40] well, oh Father. Lord, Lord, we believe
[2:07:43] in you, Father, because we knew, we
[2:07:46] know, Father God, that because you gave
[2:07:48] your word, your word will have to
[2:07:50] fulfill the purpose for which you were
[2:07:52] sent. Oh, Father. Lord, that's why we
[2:07:54] come to you, Father. Lord, we can't go
[2:07:57] to someone else, oh Father. We can't run
[2:07:59] to anybody else but you, Father. You are
[2:08:02] the rock of ages, Lord. You say, "Come
[2:08:04] unto me. You are heavy laden. I will
[2:08:06] give you rest." Lord, whatever we need,
[2:08:09] Father. You said that there is a
[2:08:10] fountain open in the house of David,
[2:08:13] Lord, for everybody who who who wants
[2:08:15] water. Lord, we thank you, Father. Lord,
[2:08:18] we ask you, Father God, to bless our
[2:08:20] pastor, Father. Lord, that you keep on
[2:08:22] opening the word to him, Father. Lord
[2:08:25] Jesus, that you bring him to revelation
[2:08:27] to revelation. Oh, Father, Lord, we
[2:08:29] pray, Father, that you bless his family,
[2:08:31] Lord. We pray that you bless this family
[2:08:33] of higher ground, Father God. Lord, help
[2:08:36] us, Father, to be united, Father God, to
[2:08:39] walk, oh Father God, in one accord,
[2:08:41] Lord, to be one body, Father, taking
[2:08:43] care of each others, Father. Lord, we
[2:08:46] thank you, Father. Lord, we also pray,
[2:08:48] oh Father God, that you forgive our
[2:08:49] sins, Lord, you forgive our iniquities,
[2:08:52] Father, you forgive our transgressions,
[2:08:54] Father. Lord, those who need the Holy
[2:08:56] Spirit, oh God, Lord, we pray, Father,
[2:08:58] Lord, that you fill them with the Holy
[2:09:00] Spirit, oh God, help us, Father. Help
[2:09:03] us, oh father, to have a great week,
[2:09:05] Father. A week, Father God, full of
[2:09:07] testimonies, oh Father, that we can come

[2:17:39] month and a lot of people have a lot of
[2:17:40] stuff going on.
[2:17:46] So in two weeks we'll come back with a
[2:17:47] report with how much we would have
[2:17:48] collected for
[2:17:53] March. And like we said
[2:17:56] earlier, if we don't reach our target,
[2:17:58] we might have to come back for a
[2:18:04] meeting. To recalibrate our goals.
[2:18:09] Amen. So if you hadn't please um
[2:18:17] And when you do it for the building fund
[2:18:19] contribution, please write in the
[2:18:21] description what it is
[2:18:30] for so it can be correctly
[2:18:36] appropriated. And just at this current
[2:18:38] time our cashup is disabled.
[2:18:46] But we're we are trying to get it fixed.
[2:18:49] So for now, our methods are zel and
[2:18:56] cash. So once that's um sorted out, we
[2:19:00] we'll just send out a message and
[2:19:04] u that is it's back up and functioning.
[2:19:09] And uh we'll get a Sunday school report
[2:19:11] from brother John. And for Sunday
[2:19:17] school Sunday
[2:19:21] school, right? So for today we did um
[2:19:24] for the the adults we studied the book
[2:19:27] of
[2:19:28] Job one. We were supposed to go over
[2:19:32] chapter 2 as well, but basically we
[2:19:34] studied
[2:19:35] on remaining faithful to the Lord
[2:19:38] despite
[2:19:40] adversities. And the homework for the
[2:19:42] adult Sunday school is going to be to
[2:19:45] read the book of Job one and chapter 2,
[2:19:47] the entire chapter. So make sure you
[2:19:49] emphasize that to the kids. It's the
[2:19:51] entire entire chapter. Job chapter 2 and
[2:19:55] chapter one. And for the young kids, um
[2:19:58] they the lesson was to kindness
[2:20:02] always to always be kind like like the
[2:20:06] good Samaritan story and the homework
[2:20:09] for them is to call the page about the
[2:20:12] lost sheep that will be given at the end
[2:20:14] of the church. So they'll be given those
[2:20:19] pages and in attendance for the young
[2:20:21] kids uh it was nine kids and
[2:20:26] Thank you for the parents who make sure
[2:20:28] their kids did an act of kindness last
