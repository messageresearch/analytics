within us in your Mighty son's name Jesus Christ hallelujah amen even just look at your neighbor and say are you grateful to be in the house of the Lord this morning I mean it's good to see each and everyone was able to make it a man whilst we are standing let us know our Bible to the Book of Leviticus Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8. Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8. the Bible says and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shout out cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land then verse 13 says in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession on position amen may the Lord in the scripture that we read God was giving a commandment to the children of Israel he was commanding Moses he says 50 years on the 10th day of the seventh month of the 50th year which was a day of atonement he said the high priest should go and sound the trumpets and throughout the land and when that trumpet is blown when the trumpet is every person has to go back to their position every person who was bound had to go free students because when the children of Israel crossed over from Egypt into the promises Joshua allocated them their possessions according to their tribes he gave each and every one of them their allocation but during the years some people would lose their possession some people people would lose their land because of a debt I caused during that when they failed to pay their debt they would become slaves so when you fail to pay your debt I don't come from paper for that you would become a slave exclav you work without getting paid or your land is taken but God had already made a way back made a provision for Grace you'll be able to claim back what was wrong in the 50th year you'll be able to go back and you would go free those chains that were binding you would bind you know foreign foreign [Music] [Music] tafami and you have to work for them in the field without getting paid and you don't have your freedom even if your children would suffer for your deaths and you would give it over to the person whom you owed a person amen amen but we thank God for he is amazing we thank God for making a way back hallelujah hallelujah because in the 50th years the high priest go around and blow a trumpet that was called a trumpet of Jubilee what the trumpet meant was you can go free what happened in the past 49 years it's being erased the prophet of God says the Lord he says many had many hundreds of years has passed but the same God that has sent the jubilees in them days is still the same God who sends jubilees today all the people that have been captured and was in captivity they come an acceptable year and when the trumpet sounded all the ones that were in captivity those that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price they could absolutely Go free if they were holding season you were in the fields you could drop that instruments because the Jubilee trumpet has sounded amen amen it doesn't matter what you are what's troubling you it doesn't matter what situation you're holding on situation when you hear that Trump is sounding Jubilee right there too it has no hold on you in return and Jubilee He says it says somehow other individuals lost their inheritance that was given to them by God and they came as Jubilee after 50 years every man that had lost his inheritance by some means to Tom Kevin if he was a Freeborn and the true blooded Israelite situative Remo and israelit no matter who held that possession they had to go back to him and now we know the Bible the natural Israel types as the spirit naturally Israel natural and Daughters of Abraham all the promises God gave to Abraham it's for his seat his natural seed Israel and his spiritual seed you and me it says so you gotta stand and say I'm a child of Abrams I'm standing on that promise so long I'm a child of Abraham I gotta go free so long I'm a child of Abraham those chains cannot hold me back hey man amen and it was pretty phenomenal that the trumpet of Jubilee city was sounded on the day of atonement back in the in the Old Testament the day of atonement was the tenth day of the seventh month and only the high priest could walk into the holy of holies once a year and he would walk in with the Basin of blood and he sprinkled the blood on the on the golden um on the on the gold instruments that are in the Holy songs this act of going in on the day of atonement was so that the sins of the children of Israel could be forgiveness everything that they had done the high priest was representing them to God so he would go in into the your sins are gone [Music] it's only his blood it's used [Music] and the high priest was given that mandate to appease God to appease God so that he would be reconciled back to his people will go to Luke chapter four verse 17 verses Jesus had gone to the synagogue and every time they went to the synagogue the priest would give the scroll to people to read and chapter 4 verse 17 says and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet is and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor image he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering this day he went to find the place that was talking about him
