[14:05] Wednesday's message was hard it was
[14:10] tough it was the perfect will of God and
[14:13] really this message is kind of gonna be
[14:15] kind of part two of Wednesday's amen but
[14:21] this is the direction the Lord wanted to
[14:22] go so let's just open our Bibles let's
[14:25] open up to Exodus chapter Ezekiel
[14:27] chapter 14 we'll read again the
[14:31] scripture from last Wednesday we just
[14:38] want to be right Saints amen this it's
[14:42] worth it amen it's worth finding the
[14:45] right way amen amen
[14:49] this is the Scripture we read Wednesday
[14:51] night says Ezekiel chapter 14 starting
[14:55] with the fourteenth or with the first
[14:57] verse and it says then came certain of
[15:02] the elders of Israel unto me and set
[15:04] before me and the word of the Lord came
[15:07] unto me saying son of man these men have
[15:11] set up their idols in their heart and
[15:13] put the stumbling block of their
[15:15] iniquity before their face should I be
[15:18] inquired of all by them therefore speak
[15:22] unto them and say unto them thus saith
[15:25] the Lord God every man of the house of
[15:28] Israel that setteth up his idols in his
[15:31] heart and put us the stumbling block of
[15:33] his iniquity before his face and cometh
[15:36] to the Prophet I the Lord will answer
[15:39] him that cometh according
[15:41] to the multitude of his idols amen that
[15:44] I may take the house of Israel in their
[15:46] own heart because they are all estranged
[15:49] from me through their idols a man let's
[15:53] just bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[15:56] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[15:59] for your precious word father Lord it is
[16:01] our desire to be exactly the state that
[16:05] you had in your mind when you died on
[16:07] Calvary father Lord whatever it is that
[16:10] you paid for when you died on Calvary we
[16:12] desire that in our lives Lord we want to
[16:15] our goal is to attain by your spirit
[16:17] father every single thing that you have
[16:20] purchased Lord the the whole inheritance
[16:22] father not lacking in any one thing but
[16:25] a perfect bride Lord that is waiting for
[16:28] her husband Lord without spot without
[16:30] wrinkle Lord and it's in that atmosphere
[16:33] and in that thinking Lord that we read
[16:35] these scriptures are smart and father
[16:36] Lord I pray Lord that you would search
[16:39] our hearts father to be any wicked way
[16:42] inside of us just point out Lord and
[16:44] we'll all repent of it we'll make it
[16:46] right Lord but because lo we want to be
[16:49] right father Lord if we do right we
[16:51] think right Lord we follow the
[16:53] leadership of your Holy Ghost Lord we
[16:56] know they'll come out right
[16:57] and we thank you Father for all things
[16:59] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[17:03] a man and you can be seeing a preacher
[17:06] message called hardness of heart fallow
[17:11] ground and a seared conscience amen amen
[17:15] as we read Wednesday you know the
[17:19] children of Israel the elders of Israel
[17:22] they were living in Babylon they've been
[17:25] placed there for their sins when this
[17:27] scripture was written and pray been
[17:29] maybe 14 15 years since a guy into
[17:33] captivity they were living there in
[17:35] captivity there 500 miles away from
[17:36] their place of worship 500 miles away
[17:40] from the temple that Jehovah gave them
[17:42] 500 miles away from where all the
[17:44] sacrifices and the priesthood and all
[17:47] those things there there are a long ways
[17:49] off from the things that God it's set in
[17:51] order and the ways that God had placed
[17:54] from it
[17:54] amen God had given them a land by His
[17:58] mercy in His grace and said this is the
[17:59] land I have promised you this is where I
[18:01] want you to live this is where I want
[18:03] you to worship me this is where I want
[18:05] you to meet me face to face and this is
[18:07] the land I want to meet you in but their
[18:10] sins and their iniquities had taken them
[18:12] out of the land that God had provided
[18:14] them their sins and their iniquities had
[18:16] taken them away from the place from the
[18:19] orders from the habits God had set up
[18:22] things them clean had setup had set up a
[18:26] habitual sacrifices habits seasons and
[18:31] and and and holidays to end times they
[18:35] could keep the place clean all these
[18:37] things were done for a purpose they are
[18:39] done after our pattern that the children
[18:41] of Israel as they worship their God that
[18:44] there were sings that there was a
[18:46] procedure set in place that the people
[18:49] would stay clean amen
[18:51] by the by the constant sacrifices by the
[18:54] constant meetings of the Lord of
[18:56] gathering together underneath the
[18:58] Passover once again every year every
[19:00] year recognizing all over again the
[19:03] blood sacrifice recognizing what the
[19:05] lamb had done for them
[19:06] amen recognizing the glory of God and
[19:08] him and his majesty
[19:10] as he was high and lifted up in the high
[19:12] and the holiest of holies amen and as a
[19:14] man was dedicated to to take the
[19:17] sacrifice and to cut into a place upon
[19:21] the mercy seat there for their sins
[19:23] amen as they had that the Word of God
[19:26] inside that inside the Ark of the
[19:28] Covenant those tablets of stone written
[19:30] with God's own finger a man they revered
[19:33] that and they placed the blood there if
[19:35] there's anything if they have done
[19:36] contrary to what was written upon those
[19:38] stones that the blood placed on mercy
[19:41] seat would cover that over a man so so
[19:44] that their sins could be forgiven but by
[19:46] going into captivity they lost all of
[19:48] that all those systems all those all
[19:52] those things that Jehovah himself had
[19:54] put in place to keep them clean so they
[19:57] could visit with him face to face
[19:59] everything they've been put in place so
[20:01] they can meet Jehovah it all bits up the
[20:04] way now the here there are 500 miles
[20:06] away and as they go to bed tonight they
[20:08] here the worship services going to
[20:11] another god amen they could hear the the
[20:14] priests as they got as they could hear
[20:17] the foreign gods revival going down the
[20:19] street
[20:19] amen of all the babylonian ish gods you
[20:23] know of all the babylonian ish worship
[20:25] services all the all the things that the
[20:28] the worshipers of the gods of Babylon
[20:30] would do in the streets and in the and
[20:33] the foreign temples now those things are
[20:35] constantly in their eyes and in their
[20:37] ears and how can they stay clean Amen
[20:42] how can they keep their ways how can
[20:45] they keep keep going away the Jehovah
[20:48] require they've lost all of that amen so
[20:52] in the when the elders of the house of
[20:54] Israel a Wednesday they come unto the
[20:57] prophet and they want to approach unto
[20:58] the prophet and find out what should we
[21:01] do
[21:01] we know that we've lost something that
[21:04] we should not have lost amen we know
[21:07] that we've done something what should we
[21:08] do and they want to approach under the
[21:10] Prophet to find the way back to find out
[21:14] what is the way back to Jehovah amen but
[21:17] when they approach under the Prophet
[21:19] because they because they're because
[21:20] they're placing everything upon somebody
[21:23] else
[21:25] amen instead of looking inwardly at
[21:27] their own selves of their own natures
[21:29] they're going to go unto the prophet and
[21:31] the Prophet is going to answer all of
[21:32] their problems they're going to go and
[21:35] choir the Prophet the Prophet will
[21:36] acquire the Lord and he'll tell them
[21:38] some sweet thing that they can listen to
[21:40] but when they approach under the prophet
[21:42] Ezekiel he says the Laura comes them
[21:44] unto them now thus the elders of the
[21:47] house appeal to come and they sit down
[21:48] before the prophet just like it says
[21:50] we're all sitting here this this morning
[21:54] so they come and they sit down and and
[21:57] the Lord all sudden comes and brings a
[21:59] word so as they're sitting there God is
[22:01] talking to his property and saying these
[22:04] men are approaching unto you thinking
[22:06] that they are going to be able to talk
[22:08] to me through you but yet they've
[22:11] approached unto you with the stumbling
[22:12] block of their own iniquity and all
[22:14] their sins as before their face and and
[22:18] the Lord says should I even be inquired
[22:20] of at all by them when they
[22:22] even take care of this amen
[22:25] these are the same men they would like
[22:27] to approach right into the holiest of
[22:29] Holies if they could a man they'd like
[22:32] to go right into the holiest of Holies
[22:33] but what they don't realize is that what
[22:36] was in the holiest of Holies was the
[22:37] Word of God inside the Ark of the
[22:39] Covenant amen the whole purpose the
[22:42] whole thing their worship ringing tortes
[22:44] was the Word of God they've been placed
[22:46] inside that Ark of the Covenant
[22:48] amen God's stones he'd written with his
[22:50] own finger of the commandments of the
[22:51] Lord amen but when they but when they
[22:55] approach unto the prophet of the Most
[22:57] High God they have all the things that
[23:00] they've done contrary to what was
[23:01] written on those stones standing before
[23:04] their face amen blocking the way to
[23:07] Jehovah amen and the Lord says should I
[23:10] be inquired of them all at all he says
[23:12] therefore because they came this way
[23:17] because they didn't take care of it
[23:19] first because they thought they could
[23:22] approach unto Jehovah and meet me
[23:24] face-to-face with the sins still in
[23:26] place I will answer them according to
[23:29] their sins that means they're coming to
[23:35] the house of judgment with no cover amen
[23:38] and no one wants to be in that place
[23:40] none of us wants to go unto the judgment
[23:43] house of the Lord Jesus Christ to go
[23:45] into the judgment house without the
[23:47] blood of Christ covering our sins amen
[23:50] and the only way we can ever have the
[23:52] blood of Christ to cover all of our sins
[23:54] is that by the Holy Spirit of the Lord
[23:57] Jesus Christ to go down on to the inside
[23:59] of the heart
[24:00] amen to search the heart out a man and
[24:04] to find those things that are contrary
[24:06] to him and when the certain when the
[24:08] Spirit does the searching amen and when
[24:10] he does the identifying amen then when
[24:13] he and when he can fix you then you can
[24:16] make a proper repentance of your sins
[24:18] Amen but if the Holy Spirit cannot
[24:20] identify those things if there's some
[24:25] preventing the Holy Spirit from
[24:27] identifying those things then we
[24:29] approach under the Lord with our sins
[24:32] still remaining then we are approaching
[24:34] into judgment not unto the Prince of
[24:36] Peace a man we want where our goal is to
[24:38] approach and see his face in peace but
[24:41] instead we see his face and anger how
[24:44] can we when our sins remain amen so just
[24:48] here I only go through a few scriptures
[24:50] here as I said the title the message to
[24:53] this morning was hardness of heart the
[24:56] fallow ground and the seared conscience
[24:59] so let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 3
[25:09] Hebrews chapter 3 start with the seventh
[25:12] verse start seven wherefore as the Holy
[25:31] Ghost saith today if you'll hear his
[25:35] voice harden not your hearts as in the
[25:38] provocation in the day of temptation in
[25:41] the wilderness when your father has
[25:43] tempted me and proved me and saw my
[25:46] works 40 years wherefore I was grieved
[25:49] with that generation and said they do
[25:51] alway err in their hearts they have not
[25:54] known my ways so I swear my wrath they
[25:57] shall not enter into my rest take heed
[26:00] brethren lest there be in any of you an
[26:02] evil heart of unbelief and departing
[26:06] from the Living God but exhort one
[26:08] another daily while it is called today
[26:10] lest any of you be hardened through the
[26:13] deceitfulness of sin for we are made
[26:16] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[26:18] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[26:21] unto the end Amen amen the warning there
[26:25] the warning wasn't just coming from st.
[26:29] Paul but the warning there was coming
[26:31] from the Holy Spirit himself amen as the
[26:34] Holy Ghost saith today if you hear his
[26:36] voice harden not your hearts
[26:38] a
[26:39] man all of us you know we rejoice in
[26:41] this message we rejoice in the things
[26:43] we've been given by the prophet of our
[26:45] day we want to approach unto the prophet
[26:48] william branham approach unto his
[26:50] message approach unto the tapes and
[26:52] learn what they have to say but if we
[26:55] approach under those tapes and we find
[26:56] something in there those tapes that we
[26:59] just can't seem to approach unto a man
[27:01] something that we just don't want to
[27:03] obey something that we can't see or we
[27:05] always you know brother BAM says this
[27:07] and we always seem to go over here and
[27:08] do this then we are and we don't repent
[27:12] of that we are hardening our hearts why
[27:15] because because as we come to the
[27:17] Prophet as we come in what the Holy
[27:19] Ghost is saying for our day and then we
[27:21] go and we go and we do something
[27:22] contrary to what the message was then we
[27:25] are hardening our hearts amen and how
[27:27] can we have rest he said there that your
[27:31] father's tempted me and proved me saw my
[27:35] works for 40 years wherefore I was
[27:38] grieved with that generation said they
[27:40] always do err in their heart and they
[27:41] have not known my ways so I swear my
[27:45] wrath they shall not enter into my rest
[27:47] amen and the rest when he rose is the
[27:50] rest of the Holy Ghost amen
[27:53] no way we can seek the rest of the Holy
[27:56] Ghost is that when the voice of God
[27:58] comes when the voice of God comes and
[28:02] tells us something that we ought to do
[28:04] amen then we ought not to harden our
[28:07] hearts against what the voice says Amen
[28:11] we ought to be quick amen quick to obey
[28:14] what the voice says amen to search our
[28:17] lives out and say Lord if there is
[28:19] anything contrary I don't want to why
[28:22] because we don't want God to be grieved
[28:23] with us amen I think every father every
[28:27] mother in here knows what is like for
[28:30] your children to grieve
[28:32] amen when you give out the word this is
[28:34] what I want done and you give out I want
[28:36] you to do this this and this and when
[28:39] you come home and the everything was
[28:41] done in half way nothing was done
[28:43] wholeheartedly
[28:44] you know nothing was done with intent of
[28:46] obedience hey man that's the key there
[28:50] if if you're gonna or we going to Oh
[28:53] the law of wait obey the Lord either
[28:56] with the intent of going of in medians
[28:58] or we're gonna obey the Lord with the
[29:00] intent of getting by with as much as we
[29:02] possibly can and we know what we know
[29:05] which one of those two will be accepted
[29:07] in his sight amen only following the
[29:10] word of the peace of God through
[29:12] obedience through a desire to obey the
[29:15] Lord Jesus Christ and his entire work
[29:17] can we actually approach under this Holy
[29:20] Spirit amen both we approach unto the
[29:23] Lord with a to see how much we can get
[29:26] away with maybe maybe you know I don't
[29:30] know if this is actually a really
[29:31] actually a sin or not it's in that gray
[29:34] zone I don't know if I can get away with
[29:35] this or not I'm gonna do this or this
[29:37] even though you know the word says this
[29:39] but maybe it doesn't actually mean that
[29:40] how are we ever gonna approach and have
[29:43] the revival of the Holy Ghost day by day
[29:45] on the inside when we oh we our own
[29:48] children will testify Amen how they can
[29:51] grieve us how much more do we grieve the
[29:54] Holy Ghost when we try to get well away
[29:57] with as much as we possibly can amen and
[30:01] Sue by doing that you put in your heart
[30:04] amen and when a man hardens his heart
[30:07] then God cannot do anything with that
[30:10] amen God can I lead that man God cannot
[30:13] come down and bring the revival the the
[30:17] relationship with the Lord stops right
[30:19] there why because you have grieved the
[30:21] Holy Spirit and you have hardened your
[30:23] heart you've sealed it away from the
[30:25] Word of God growing and so on the inside
[30:28] of your heart amen the word of the God
[30:30] is a seat and weight goes into your
[30:32] heart if your heart be prepared
[30:34] it will grow up and produce everything
[30:37] that gospel says amen amen brother
[30:40] Brahim said that the the true church
[30:43] will write a book of Acts behind it amen
[30:46] every true church will write another
[30:48] book of Acts behind it amen and well how
[30:51] do they do that why because the word
[30:52] grows it's not by their own desire eenz
[30:55] it's not by their own askings it's not
[30:57] by their own workings but it's by
[30:59] allowing the Holy Spirit and the word to
[31:02] grow inside a heart that has been
[31:04] prepared a man it does not happen in a
[31:07] has been hard it will not happen when a
[31:09] man has constantly consistently
[31:12] disobeyed the Word of God disobeyed the
[31:14] the revealed word for this hour and that
[31:17] the Word of God cannot grow in that
[31:19] therefore the book of Acts cannot be
[31:21] written in that heart amen why because
[31:23] the heart has been hardened and the seed
[31:26] which is the Word of God will not grow
[31:30] amen
[31:31] so in a heart now what do we do when a
[31:33] heart has been hurt amen you know Jesus
[31:37] said we said when it came and asked him
[31:41] about divorce I said you know you you
[31:44] Moses allowed that through the hardness
[31:47] of your hearts but from the beginning it
[31:49] wasn't so but because of the hardness of
[31:53] your hearts Moses he Moses wanted to go
[31:56] the straight and narrow but he hit the
[32:00] road block and that road block would not
[32:02] move all that Jehovah said all the his
[32:05] prophets said that road block would not
[32:07] move and Moses had to go around it amen
[32:10] which was not but from the beginning
[32:12] divorce was not so a man what and what
[32:15] caused that that road block was the
[32:17] hardness of the heart amen and every
[32:20] single one of us has the potential for
[32:22] having a road block in your life where
[32:25] all sudden God wants to go through and
[32:26] do this he hits the roadblock and you
[32:29] cannot go any further in your walk with
[32:30] Christ amen and you cannot go any
[32:34] further why you've stopped upon your
[32:36] spiritual life's journey
[32:38] why because you can know because the
[32:39] Holy Spirit wants to go this way and the
[32:41] Holy Spirit won't always make a detour
[32:43] for you amen you know you think well
[32:46] long ago the permissive will of God
[32:48] sometimes God would just leave you you
[32:51] want to all want to just do the
[32:52] permissive will say the perfect will
[32:54] I've got the Holy Spirit we'll just take
[32:56] us fight a man and then where will you
[32:59] be you'll be off wondering how do I get
[33:01] back to where I used to do how do I get
[33:04] back to when I first met Christ I wish I
[33:06] could worship God like I used to I wish
[33:09] I could serve God like I used to I wish
[33:11] I could be a witness I wish I could
[33:13] fellowship with the believers I wish I
[33:15] could fill a ship because you know
[33:17] because hardness of heart will break up
[33:19] true fellowship
[33:20] amen you cannot properly fellowship this
[33:23] is like when I had leprosy in the Old
[33:25] Testament amen when a man had leprosy he
[33:28] had to separate himself from the camp a
[33:31] man if he saw somebody there was clean
[33:33] he had he had to yellow i'm unclean i'm
[33:37] unclean stay away from me i'm unclean
[33:39] why because the leprosy caused
[33:41] aspiration a man when you harden your
[33:44] hearts then a multitude of sins began to
[33:46] rise enough a man and the Holy Spirit no
[33:49] longer has the ability to convict you of
[33:50] all your sins amen so therefore the sin
[33:53] remains not taken care of by the blood
[33:55] amen and so near in your hole your
[33:57] spirit is crying out like like leprosy
[34:00] it's cry your spear is crying out stay
[34:03] away from me stay away from me
[34:04] I'm unclean I'm unclean I'm in clean you
[34:07] cannot have true fellowship with the
[34:09] believers amen and as the Bible says
[34:11] iron sharpens iron you lose the benefits
[34:14] of all those things why because your own
[34:17] heart has been hardened and you're now
[34:19] unclean amen amen amen you know when
[34:24] when Christ rise let's turn over to mark
[34:26] chapter 16 real quick I do have a lot of
[34:30] scriptures so I hope you all like the
[34:32] Bible mark chapter 16 we'll read from
[34:39] the fourteenth verse I want you to let's
[34:48] just think about it right around the
[34:51] time of Jesus's ministry what all their
[34:56] desires their hopes and dreams were you
[34:59] know as they were with all the way their
[35:02] nation was put under bondage to the
[35:04] Romans and and they were looking for a
[35:06] messiah and all of a sudden and their
[35:08] Messiah shows up on the scene amen the
[35:11] gospel is being fulfilled all all all
[35:14] the promises of the Old Testament are
[35:15] being are coming to fruition and they're
[35:17] seen Scripture after scripture after
[35:19] scripture being fulfilled and here's
[35:21] their Messiah three and a half years the
[35:24] disciples they walk with them and they
[35:26] and their see miracle after miracle and
[35:29] they're realizing that this their Lord
[35:31] Jesus Christ can do anything at any
[35:34] amen they didn't they hang out with him
[35:36] and they're being protected
[35:37] amen they're being washed over Jesus
[35:40] Christ is watching over his disciples
[35:42] and there is a joyous time those three
[35:45] and a half year period of time was a
[35:46] joyous time to wear the everything they
[35:49] had neither was taken care of by Jesus
[35:51] hey no matter what they need if they if
[35:53] they needed food he could multiply the
[35:55] food they go watch as the sick were
[35:57] healed and as a revival the Pharisees
[36:00] would come and and try to do this to him
[36:02] do that to him and they would just
[36:04] somehow escape and everything was taken
[36:06] care of why because their proximity to
[36:08] the Lord Jesus Christ how close they
[36:10] were
[36:11] amen as long as they stayed close to the
[36:13] Lord Jesus Christ he took Aaron they
[36:15] knew they he was their Messiah amen and
[36:18] what confusion it threw them into when
[36:21] he died upon the cross amen even though
[36:24] it says there in the Bible that there
[36:26] came a point in time the last year was
[36:28] life where he began to tell them this is
[36:30] what's going to happen this is what
[36:32] we're looking forward to this is what's
[36:33] going to happen and yet they were but
[36:36] the problem was is their heart was still
[36:38] hard no matter how close their proximity
[36:43] was to Lord Jesus Christ their heart was
[36:45] still hardened to believe that he was
[36:48] the sacrifice for their sins to believe
[36:50] all and he was telling him I am gonna
[36:52] die I am gonna be put it to death on the
[36:54] cross and all those things their hearts
[36:56] was hardened a man so when he died and
[36:59] he adult given them the promise I will
[37:03] rise again amen let's read mark chapter
[37:06] 16 fourteenth verse says and afterward
[37:12] he appeared unto the leaven i Sisko the
[37:16] ninth verse it says now when Jesus was
[37:20] risen early the first day of the week he
[37:22] appeared first unto Mary out of whom he
[37:25] cast Seven Devils and then going to
[37:27] verse 12 after that he appeared in
[37:29] another form unto two of them as they
[37:31] walked and went into the country and
[37:33] they went and told it under the residue
[37:35] neither believing they then verse 14
[37:40] afterwards he Jesus appeared under the
[37:43] leaven as they set at me and up in them
[37:45] with their unbelief and hardness of
[37:47] heart
[37:48] because they believe not which had seen
[37:50] him after he was risen everything that
[37:54] they had hoped for and dreamed for for
[37:56] these three and a half years was coming
[37:58] to fruition but because of the hardness
[38:00] of their heart was preventing them from
[38:01] seeing a man they were living in the
[38:04] time of the fulfilled scripture this
[38:06] ship in a time of rejoicing and joy and
[38:10] and the glory of God and and all those
[38:12] things and everything think about what
[38:14] the where they were living how many of
[38:16] us right now would like to go back and
[38:18] live be right in that moment in time oh
[38:20] my how many of us if if for $1,000 we
[38:26] could go back and live out that day with
[38:28] the disciples who would sign up or
[38:31] there's ten thousand dollars who would
[38:33] sign up a man we could borrow we could
[38:35] do everything I have to make payments on
[38:37] it the rest of our lives but it would be
[38:39] worth it justice just to be there to
[38:41] experience that may be a joy as a joyous
[38:44] day but they were missing out on that
[38:46] because of their hardness of their
[38:48] hearts hey man when they first see
[38:51] Christ after his resurrection his first
[38:54] words have to be words of rebuke why
[38:56] because their hardness of their hearts
[38:57] was preventing them from having
[38:59] fellowship one with another and
[39:01] fellowship with him amen and the same
[39:04] thing happens in the Church of the God
[39:07] when the hardness of our hearts prevents
[39:10] us through our uncleanness from having
[39:12] fellowship one with another and
[39:13] fellowship with him why our spirits as
[39:16] we walk through the church are crying
[39:18] out like a leper
[39:20] I'm unclean I'm unclean stay away from
[39:22] me I'm unclean amen amen
[39:28] now let's turn over let's let's look at
[39:31] the fallow ground for a while you're
[39:32] familiar with that Amen let's go to
[39:39] hosea chapter 10
[39:45] familiar with the fallow ground that's
[39:46] the ground farmer he wants to go plant a
[39:50] seed but the ground has been sitting
[39:53] there during the cold winter season it's
[39:57] it's baked by the Sun maybe through the
[40:00] dry season or whatever it is and the
[40:03] ground has now been hardened and there
[40:07] is no way for them to get back to get
[40:12] back to get back to the point where seed
[40:17] can be sown until first they break up
[40:20] the ground amen
[40:22] so let's read here Jose a chapter hosea
[40:24] chapter 10 will will read the twelfth
[40:28] verse it says so to yourselves and
[40:31] righteousness reap and mercy break up
[40:36] your fallow ground for it is time to
[40:39] seek the Lord till he come and reign
[40:41] righteousness upon you amen
[40:45] so what's he saying here he's saying
[40:47] it's time the time has now arrived it's
[40:50] time to seek the Lord a man I think
[40:52] ain't all of us can agree it's time to
[40:54] seek the Lord a man we we know we we
[40:57] don't know actually how close it is to
[40:59] the time of the end we know that as
[41:01] close we've heard the prophecies for the
[41:04] last 50 years 60 years we've seen how
[41:07] what was come to pass we've seen it all
[41:09] come to hat we know that it's time to
[41:11] seek the Lord what does he say they say
[41:13] that it's then if you're going to seek
[41:15] the Lord you have to so yours to
[41:16] yourselves and righteousness so you can
[41:19] reap in mercy who would like to reap I
[41:20] think about reaping in mercy in the last
[41:23] day who at the very last day before the
[41:25] coming of Lord Jesus Christ was still
[41:27] like to start right reaping mercy amen
[41:30] waitwait or on the day of the rapture
[41:32] who would like to reap some mercy amen
[41:35] the merton the rapture is mercy Amen is
[41:39] the fruition of mercy but order to wreak
[41:41] mercy you have to sow in righteousness
[41:43] amen in order to sow in righteousness
[41:45] you have to break up the follow ground
[41:47] amen your car your heart cannot be hurt
[41:51] Amen let's let's turn back to Jeremiah
[41:55] chapter 4
[42:02] it is time to seek it's time to seek the
[42:05] Lord tell he come and reign
[42:07] righteousness upon you a man because the
[42:12] rains gonna come but cane your heart
[42:14] receding Jeremiah chapter 4 verse 1 and
[42:21] it says if that will if that will return
[42:26] o Israel saith Lord return unto me if
[42:29] that will put away thine abominations
[42:31] out of my sight then thou shalt not
[42:33] remove and I shall swear the Lord liveth
[42:36] and truth and judgment and righteousness
[42:38] and the nations shall bless themselves
[42:40] in him and in him shall they glory for
[42:44] thus saith the Lord God or thus saith
[42:47] the Lord to the men of Judah and
[42:48] Jerusalem break up your fallow ground
[42:50] and so not among the thorns circumcise
[42:54] yourselves to the Lord and take away the
[42:57] foreskins of your heart you men of Judah
[42:59] and inhabitants of Jerusalem bless my
[43:02] fury come forth like fire and burned
[43:03] that none can quench it because of the
[43:06] evil of your doings amen so break up
[43:09] your fallow ground and don't sow among
[43:11] the thorns where Jesus said they sowed
[43:14] amongst the thorns and as soon as the
[43:16] series of growing was grown up the
[43:20] Thrones because of the cares of this
[43:22] life choked them a man their heart was
[43:25] hardened towards the gospel but was
[43:27] alive towards the world
[43:29] amen therefore the thrones the thorns
[43:32] they are there sown in the wrong spot
[43:35] even what do you say what's the answer
[43:38] here the answer is break up your fallow
[43:40] ground amen break up what is breaking up
[43:44] the fellow ground it's getting to a
[43:46] position in your life where you can
[43:50] receive the full word of God amen
[43:56] getting into a position that's where you
[43:58] get down before the Lord and you and you
[44:00] you say Lord I'm not where I ought to be
[44:03] amen I'm not in a condition to receive
[44:05] your word I'm not in a condition for
[44:09] your word to come and be sewn in my life
[44:11] amen I know what the
[44:13] gospel says I know what it says about
[44:15] about overcoming life in the spirit I
[44:18] know what it says about a bride a spot
[44:21] or wrinkle but yet my life is not in
[44:23] imposition to fulfill those scriptures
[44:26] then you guys from ground breaking to do
[44:28] Amen when you when you can look when you
[44:31] take an honest look at your life and
[44:33] then you look at the scriptures to say
[44:34] she'll be without spot and without
[44:36] wrinkle and you look at the scripture
[44:38] and says that she will those that are
[44:41] led by the Spirit amen amen
[44:44] you know and all those scriptures about
[44:46] the leadership of the Holy Ghost I mean
[44:48] you look at your life and those and you
[44:50] can identify those scriptures living and
[44:52] moving in your life amen then your your
[44:56] ground has been your heart amen and it
[44:58] cannot receive the word therefore you
[45:00] gotta break up your fallow ground are
[45:02] you gonna do you got to humble yourself
[45:04] before God and stand repent and say Lord
[45:07] I've completely ruined your plan of
[45:10] salvation for my life I've completely
[45:13] ruined because the path of salvation for
[45:16] us is for our spirit to move out of the
[45:19] way and make room for the Holy Spirit to
[45:22] come and live through our lives
[45:23] amen but he will not do that if the
[45:26] ground cannot produce the Word of God
[45:27] amen if you cannot reproduce the Word of
[45:31] God and all of his promises in your life
[45:33] then your ground has been hardened amen
[45:35] and you must come back here and submit
[45:37] yourself before God and break up the
[45:39] fallow ground amen amen
[45:44] break up your fallow ground and so not
[45:46] among the thorns circumcise yourself to
[45:49] the Lord and take away the foreskins of
[45:51] your heart amen amen
[45:54] now let's turn over to first Timothy
[45:57] chapter 4
[46:14] start with the first verse here is a
[46:23] holy spirit given prophecy for our day
[46:27] so it's worth looking at amen and
[46:31] following 2nd or 1st Timothy first
[46:35] Timothy chapter 4 verse 1 now the spirit
[46:39] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[46:42] days or in the latter times some shall
[46:45] depart from the faith giving heed to
[46:48] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[46:51] speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
[46:54] conscience seared with a hot iron amen
[46:58] so according to the Holy Spirit what he
[47:00] is prophesied then in the last days
[47:02] there'll be people they'll be in the
[47:04] faith they'll believe in the message of
[47:07] their hour a mean they'll be believing
[47:09] what the Spirit says for this day and
[47:11] the whole sudden a seducing Spirit is
[47:14] going to come across their path a man
[47:16] and that spirit is going to tell them a
[47:19] lie it's going to tell them to do
[47:21] something contrary to the word they
[47:23] meant it's gonna tell them - you can you
[47:25] can get away with doing this you can get
[47:28] away with doing that I know the word
[47:30] says this but this spirit is going to
[47:32] come and try to seduce you that even
[47:34] though the word says this you can go off
[47:37] over here and do this a seducing spirit
[47:41] what is it doing its seducing you away
[47:43] from the word just like the devil
[47:45] seduced Eve away from the word amen Eve
[47:48] Adams bride was seduced away from the
[47:51] word that he gave her now Christ has a
[47:54] bride and there's that same spirit is
[47:57] here to seduce you away why so he can
[48:00] make you fall away ripe for the rapture
[48:03] the same way eat it amen and so the some
[48:07] sheldon's now some that are in the faith
[48:09] in the last days the Holy Spirit
[48:11] prophesized so it's gonna come to pass
[48:12] no matter what the some shall depart
[48:14] from the faith giving heed to that what
[48:17] they're doing giving heed their obeying
[48:19] seducing spirits and the doctrines of
[48:23] devils
[48:23] amen what are doctrines of devils it's
[48:26] when the devil comes and he gives you a
[48:28] scripture or he gives you something that
[48:31] that looks scriptural that gives you an
[48:34] excuse not to obey the full Word of God
[48:36] a scriptural reason a scriptural
[48:40] twisting to not obey the full Word of
[48:42] God that's when you take a scripture you
[48:44] say well I can do this because of this
[48:49] wit but when you know in your mind that
[48:52] the rest of the scripture is not in
[48:53] agreement with how you are Satan is
[48:56] twisting the Scriptures amen it's a your
[48:59] own personal pet doctrine
[49:01] amen amen it's just like saying well
[49:05] well David got away with doing this with
[49:07] Bathsheba therefore I can get away with
[49:09] doing this with Bathsheba that is a
[49:12] doctrine of the Devils it's a seducing
[49:15] spirit that's telling you to do
[49:16] something contrary to the gospel amen
[49:20] amen and then in this prophesied that
[49:24] that will come to pass in the last days
[49:25] therefore it's going to happen
[49:27] that means we ought to watch out for it
[49:29] amen
[49:30] and then those in once the once that
[49:32] happen see you get down to verse two
[49:33] you're speaking lies in hypocrisy amen
[49:37] I'm your conscience seared with a hot
[49:38] iron what is that it's when you're you
[49:40] know that were hypocracy it means an
[49:43] actor amen some of us acting out of play
[49:46] amen it's like coming to church and
[49:48] acting like you're worshiping God when
[49:50] your heart is crying out I'm unclean I'm
[49:53] unclean I'm unclean amen you come to
[49:56] church day in dare you say you sing
[49:58] these great songs that we sing of
[50:00] worship towards Christ but you're not
[50:02] taking care of the things that are in
[50:04] your heart that's hypocrisy you're
[50:06] acting like a worshiper of Jesus Christ
[50:09] but your heart is far from him amen and
[50:12] Jesus said get you away from me your
[50:15] heart you are far from me I never knew

[50:32] hands on the sick they're speaking lies
[50:33] when they when they when they when they
[50:35] try to fellowship with a believer
[50:37] why because they're testifying that
[50:39] they're living united with Christ when
[50:41] they're actually living United with the
[50:44] devil
[50:44] amen why because they gave heed to the
[50:47] seducing spirits therefore their
[50:48] conscience gets seared with a hot iron
[50:53] amen the their conscience that was their
[50:56] conscience it's where the Holtz has a
[50:58] place or he can come into your heart and
[51:01] convict you and tell you you shouldn't
[51:05] do that you shouldn't do this that's
[51:08] wrong you you did caught you you
[51:10] disagree or disobedient to the Lord amen
[51:13] what's he doing he's convicting you
[51:14] I want to Satan do the seducing spirit
[51:17] comes with a hot iron when you're
[51:18] disobedient to that conviction and he
[51:21] Sears that place with a hot iron
[51:23] now you can't feel the Holy Spirit
[51:24] you're past feeling amen you know no
[51:29] matter how many times the Holy Spirit
[51:31] comes to convict you now you can no
[51:33] longer recognize the conviction of the
[51:36] Holy Spirit your past feeling you've
[51:39] given over to Satan and the seducing
[51:41] spirits now you can no longer be in
[51:43] obedience to the Holy Spirit amen that's
[51:46] when you start keeping sin upon sin upon
[51:48] sin amen it's just like when Satan when
[51:51] he when he convinces you to go to the
[51:53] first inch there's a thousand more
[51:55] inches past that one Amen that you can
[51:57] go down and when you get that you get to
[51:59] that thousand since you look back and
[52:01] think all I did was that and but look
[52:04] what it led to
[52:05] why because you gave in to the seducing
[52:07] spirit amen amen
[52:14] let's turn organize a chapter 42
[52:30] Isaiah 42 will read from 22nd verse it
[52:44] says but this people but this is a
[52:49] people robbed and spoiled they are all
[52:52] of them snared in Holts they are all hid
[52:54] in prison houses they are for a prey and
[52:57] none delivereth therefore a spoil and
[53:00] none saith restore who among you will
[53:03] give ear to this who will hearken it
[53:05] here for the time to come
[53:07] who gave Jacob for a spoil in Israel to
[53:09] the robbers did not the Lord who against
[53:12] who we have sinned for they would not
[53:15] walk in his ways neither were they
[53:17] obedient unto his law therefore he hath
[53:20] poured upon him the fury of his anger
[53:22] the strength of battle and has set him
[53:25] on fire round
[53:26] o yet he knew it not and it burned him
[53:30] yet he laid it not to heart
[53:33] think about that God is pouring out his
[53:35] upon him the fury of his anger the
[53:38] strength of battle and set him on fire
[53:40] roundabout but yet he didn't know it why
[53:44] didn't he know it his conscience had
[53:45] been seared with a hot iron it again
[53:47] even his eyes have been blinded he can
[53:50] no longer see what his spiritual
[53:51] condition is he's in danger of hellfire
[53:54] amen
[53:56] this man is in danger of going to hell
[53:58] but yet he won't allow himself his eyes
[54:01] of inviting he can no longer see this
[54:03] man is in a bad place
[54:04] amen amen the because God can no longer
[54:10] get through him even even has the
[54:12] strength of battle up on him that means
[54:14] the Devils are raging all around the
[54:16] walls are broken down amen unclean
[54:20] animals and going into the holy place
[54:21] you know Satan could come in and do
[54:23] anything he wants in your life and you
[54:25] don't even realize how bad off you are
[54:27] and how close you are to the separating
[54:29] life amen
[54:31] that's a bad place to be in amen you
[54:35] know it's just like we had preached a
[54:36] mess
[54:37] a while back called worshipping the
[54:40] enemies gods you know and when Joe Hova
[54:44] brought them into the promised land he
[54:45] said I will break I'll bring out I'll
[54:48] kick out the enemy little by little I'm
[54:50] gonna drive them out land as you take
[54:52] footsteps he I will give you possession
[54:55] and little by little the gods be driven
[54:57] out but it but if they remain they will
[54:59] be a snare unto you they bent and you
[55:02] know because the enemy he is gonna seek
[55:04] to give glory to his own if the enemy
[55:06] makes inroads into his life he's gonna
[55:08] seek to give glory into himself amen and
[55:11] so and so you'll have the as we said the
[55:15] enemies worship services going on your
[55:17] life as the enemy is now using you to
[55:19] give glory unto himself you who were
[55:21] bought with a price and then you were
[55:23] just like Samson Samson Samson was risen
[55:28] up to destroy the Philistines and God
[55:32] gave him great power and might to
[55:34] destroy the Philistines but he became
[55:36] ensnared by the very thing that he was
[55:39] risen up to defeat amen and we're here
[55:42] to defeat Laodicea
[55:44] we're here to overcome all the wiles of
[55:46] the enemy amen we're over here to
[55:48] overcome everything that Satan would do
[55:50] in this day all the lukewarmness but yet
[55:52] how many of us are ensnared right now in
[55:55] lukewarmness
[55:55] amen God roses up here in Des Moines to
[55:58] be a church or the Most High God be
[56:01] overcomers in our day to be the to be
[56:04] those in the City of Des Moines area in
[56:06] this area to where we've been we're set
[56:09] here to be those that overcome lukewarm
[56:11] as a man and everything that's mentioned
[56:14] in Revelation chapter 3 amen but if we
[56:16] who were sent here to overcome
[56:19] lukewarmness become lukewarm then how
[56:24] can there be a witness in the city the
[56:27] very thing we're risen up to defeat all
[56:29] sudden became a snare to us Amen wife by
[56:32] the lukewarmness by the cares of this
[56:34] life amen they were when they went to
[56:36] the promised land they were given
[56:38] several respond four distinct
[56:42] responsibilities or three distinct
[56:45] responsibilities one was you shall make
[56:48] no covenant with them or their gods
[56:52] you shall make no covenant with them or
[56:55] their gods a man in our day we should
[56:57] make no covenant with with the
[56:59] temptations of the enemy amen ooh when
[57:02] you when you make the decision when
[57:04] Satan comes in tempts you and you say
[57:06] I'm going to ignore the word I'm gonna
[57:09] go obey this temptation that you're
[57:11] making a covenant with the enemy you're
[57:13] striking hands with the enemy you're
[57:15] you're you're shaking hands with the
[57:17] enemy while ignoring what the Word of
[57:19] God says amen and we look back at them
[57:22] and think how could they do that to
[57:23] their promised land
[57:24] maybe it's so easy for us to look back
[57:26] at them and say how could they do this
[57:28] how could they do that why couldn't they
[57:30] listen to Moses why couldn't they listen
[57:31] to Joshua and yet we come and we do the
[57:34] same thing in our day why because we
[57:36] shake hands with the enemy
[57:40] amen amen the second one is they shall
[57:44] not live with you lest they make you sin
[57:46] against me amen that means you watch
[57:49] what comes in your house amen you watch
[57:52] what comes in your house how do things
[57:54] come into your house they come into the
[57:55] house by people to visit you amen they
[57:58] come to your house buy by the spirits
[58:01] and the members of your household they
[58:03] come into a buy by television or by
[58:05] internet or by cellphone these are the
[58:07] things that come into our house you know
[58:09] and and we and so we have to be on guard
[58:12] over these things that if they're coming
[58:14] into our house we watch like oh I
[58:17] recognize that that was contrary to the
[58:20] scripture our houses are supposed to be
[58:22] a house of peace a house of rest a house
[58:24] where God's Word has the preeminence
[58:27] amen remember the threefold purpose that
[58:30] in the Christ the mystery of God is a
[58:32] real brother and said the three full
[58:34] purpose of the manifestation of Jesus
[58:36] Christ in this hour was one to manifest
[58:39] Jesus Christ perfectly a perfect
[58:44] manifestation of Jesus Christ in this
[58:46] hour that Christ might be revealed in
[58:48] his fullness and when the second was
[58:50] that once Christ is revealed that he'd
[58:52] have the preeminence in the bride amen
[58:56] that wants Christ is fully revealed that
[58:58] Christ will have the preeminence in
[59:00] every step of our lives amen and the
[59:03] third of the three
[59:04] purposes was to restore Eden that that
[59:07] Eve go back to her original position or
[59:10] fellowship with her husband the second
[59:12] Adam Amen that the bride can go back to
[59:15] her original position of fellowship with
[59:18] the second Adam that Christ has a place
[59:21] of fellowship where we ought to be a
[59:22] place where we ought to dwell there's a
[59:25] final purpose of current the revelation
[59:28] of Jesus Christ on this earth is that we
[59:30] could be restored back to that place of
[59:32] fellowship amen but when the enemies are
[59:34] in the land when we're not taking care
[59:36] of our households we are we are going
[59:39] into bondage contrary and being
[59:41] handcuffed so we can't even approach
[59:42] unto the purpose that God has for this
[59:45] hour
[59:46] amen he says and and the he also said if
[59:50] you serve their gods they will be a
[59:52] snare unto you amen
[59:54] and you must obey the Angels voice
[59:57] whatever messenger sent to you you must
[1:00:01] obey his voice those are the three
[1:00:03] things that God gave them when they came
[1:00:05] into the promise and he shall make no
[1:00:06] covenant with them or their gods you
[1:00:08] shall not they shall not live with you
[1:00:10] less they make you sin against me and
[1:00:12] you shall obey the Angels voice amen
[1:00:15] that's the that when they went into
[1:00:17] their promised land
[1:00:18] those were the conditions that they went
[1:00:20] in under amen when we enter into the
[1:00:23] Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:26] those are the conditions that we enter
[1:00:28] into amen that we will obey the voice of
[1:00:30] the angel amen we will watch what comes
[1:00:33] into our homes amen and we all and we
[1:00:36] will make no covenant with them or if
[1:00:38] they're gods they shall not live with us
[1:00:40] amen otherwise it will be a snare into
[1:00:43] us amen
[1:00:54] you know one thing for sure no Egyptian
[1:00:57] slaves are going to enter into his
[1:00:58] promise linked a man slavery's by the
[1:01:01] viola a man let's turn over to Romans
[1:01:05] chapter 8
[1:01:38] we'll start with the first verse there
[1:01:46] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:01:49] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:01:51] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:01:53] amen who would like to be in that
[1:01:56] condition amen no condemnation
[1:01:59] nothing can condemn you nothing can be
[1:02:01] found your life cannot be touched by
[1:02:04] anything why because you are completely
[1:02:06] under the law how do we get there
[1:02:07] amen we have to be in Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:11] the only way to be in Christ as we fill
[1:02:13] with his spirit amen
[1:02:15] he and us us and him amen and then once
[1:02:18] we're filled with the spare what do we
[1:02:19] do we don't walk after the flesh the
[1:02:21] desires are /wel we walk after the
[1:02:24] spirit amen
[1:02:25] there's gotta be some loose and there's
[1:02:27] some learning that goes with that amen
[1:02:29] you can't just walk in the spirit on day
[1:02:32] one there's a learning process you know
[1:02:34] as you you you stumble here you stumble
[1:02:37] there you walk in the spirit but one
[1:02:39] thing you do there is no excuse amen
[1:02:43] day in day out what does the spirit do
[1:02:45] and when you feel the spirit get grieve
[1:02:46] you're like Oh Lord make it right
[1:02:49] Oh Lord make it right why because you
[1:02:51] don't want your conscience to be seared
[1:02:53] hey man you're doing your ground to be
[1:02:55] hard amen amen for the law of the spirit
[1:03:00] of cry life and Curt Jesus for the law
[1:03:03] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:03:06] have made me free from the law of sin
[1:03:08] and death let's go to verse 4 that the
[1:03:11] righteousness of the law might be
[1:03:12] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:03:15] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[1:03:17] are after the flesh do mind the things
[1:03:20] of the flesh but they they're after the
[1:03:22] spirit the things of the Spirit for be
[1:03:24] carnally minded is death but to be
[1:03:27] spiritually minded is life and peace
[1:03:29] sometimes I think that we don't put
[1:03:30] enough strength on the the word death in
[1:03:33] these scriptures you know what is death
[1:03:37] he's not talking about death of this
[1:03:40] body he's talking about eternal
[1:03:43] everlasting separation from our guy
[1:03:46] and sometimes we just go over these
[1:03:49] scriptures so quickly but he said that
[1:03:51] to be carnally minded his death
[1:03:54] separated from God carnally minded yeah
[1:03:58] we the Holy Spirit is not optional you
[1:04:02] know I grew up with that sense in my
[1:04:05] life that the Holy Spirit is optional
[1:04:06] you know that you know I don't know if
[1:04:08] that's how it was preached but that's
[1:04:10] how I received it when I was living in
[1:04:12] denomination you know you you grow up
[1:04:15] you get baptized you confess your sins
[1:04:18] if you want some more power in your life
[1:04:20] you might consider getting the baptism
[1:04:22] of the Holy Ghost maybe he'll make you
[1:04:25] speak in tongues you know that was
[1:04:29] that's how I grew up but let but let me
[1:04:31] tell you the Holy Spirit is not optional
[1:04:32] it's not optional we have to have the
[1:04:35] living moving breathing presence of the
[1:04:39] Lord Jesus Christ in our lives we have
[1:04:41] to have the Holy Spirit and with his
[1:04:43] evidence of the hoist Baron was the
[1:04:45] evidence of the horse spirit as it makes
[1:04:47] you an obedience to the word it drives
[1:04:49] you toward the revealed word for this
[1:04:51] hour amen
[1:04:52] the Holy Spirit of God will drive you to
[1:04:55] the revealed word for this hour that's
[1:04:57] the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:05:00] so when you when you when you find
[1:05:01] yourselves living contrary to the real
[1:05:04] Word of God for this hour and how can
[1:05:06] you say I am living day by day in the
[1:05:09] spirit and when especially when you know
[1:05:11] that to live contrary to that is death
[1:05:15] amen amen
[1:05:18] let's go down to the 13th verse for if
[1:05:22] you live after the flesh he shall die
[1:05:24] but if he through the spirit do mortify
[1:05:28] the deeds of the body ye shall live amen
[1:05:32] so if you just go through life casually
[1:05:35] half Hazzard Lee and live after the
[1:05:38] things of the flesh you're going to die
[1:05:39] it's going to happen that's a prophecy
[1:05:42] of the scripture amen you live through
[1:05:44] this life halfway just living according
[1:05:47] to the flesh you're going to die but if
[1:05:49] not not if hear it now watch you could
[1:05:53] take this if you take out the spirit out
[1:05:54] of this verse you you you could live
[1:05:57] through this and mortify the deeds of
[1:05:59] the body and learn
[1:06:00] how to be a good person you're still
[1:06:02] gonna die but if he through the spirit
[1:06:06] amen that's what that's why you have the
[1:06:09] open channels a mint you have a place
[1:06:11] where the Holy Spirit can come and
[1:06:12] convict you your hollow your Hut your
[1:06:14] fallow ground has been broken up a
[1:06:16] mangaka Rania's righteousness down upon
[1:06:18] you and through the spirit your
[1:06:20] mortifying the deeds of the flesh why
[1:06:22] because the Holy Spirit has a pathway
[1:06:24] that he can come and talk to you amen if
[1:06:27] that pathway is blocked up then you
[1:06:28] can't fulfill the scripture amen but but
[1:06:32] in the only way that we're gonna live is
[1:06:34] is if we do fulfill the scripture why
[1:06:36] because we all have to mortify the deeds
[1:06:38] of the body the only way we can do it is
[1:06:40] through the spirit amen that's the only
[1:06:43] way to life
[1:06:44] Paul says ye shall live if you do this
[1:06:46] if we don't do it we'll die it's the
[1:06:49] only way to life amen
[1:06:52] verse 14 for as many as are led by the
[1:06:54] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:06:57] only the sons of God are going to heaven
[1:07:00] if you're not a son of God you're not
[1:07:02] going to heaven only the sons of God are
[1:07:04] going to heaven amen and so to be a son
[1:07:07] of God you have to be led by the Spirit
[1:07:09] of God and that requires an open channel
[1:07:12] a man without the open channel you
[1:07:14] cannot be led by the Spirit amen
[1:07:18] verse 15 for ye have not received the
[1:07:21] spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:07:22] you've received the spirit of adoption
[1:07:24] whereby we cry Abba Father there's a
[1:07:28] spirit that wants to come into us that
[1:07:31] makes us a dog brings us to adoption
[1:07:33] Amen that's where we're no longer
[1:07:35] waffling we're no longer we've gotten
[1:07:38] good at mortifying the deeds of our
[1:07:40] flesh amen therefore and when you get
[1:07:42] good at mortifying the deeds of the
[1:07:44] flesh through the spirit you get good at
[1:07:46] obeying the spirit you're good at
[1:07:48] walking in the spirit
[1:07:50] you've learned how to walk in his
[1:07:51] channels walk in his ways walk after his
[1:07:54] righteousness then he can come forth and
[1:07:56] put you and place you in the kingdom
[1:07:58] this is where you sit this is where you
[1:08:01] stand this you're given a portion of the
[1:08:04] Holy Spirit where you can act you live
[1:08:07] you move you have your being and him
[1:08:08] you've been placed in the kingdom all of
[1:08:10] heaven is behind your words that come
[1:08:12] out of your mouth amen when you lay it
[1:08:14] your
[1:08:14] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:08:16] amen the book of Acts will be written
[1:08:18] behind your life why because you've been
[1:08:20] adopted into the kingdom amen and if a
[1:08:25] thing comes upon this life here we cry
[1:08:26] father father I need this is where I
[1:08:29] need why because you know where your
[1:08:30] sustenance comes from amen
[1:08:34] verse 16 for the spirit itself beareth
[1:08:37] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:08:39] children of God and if children then
[1:08:42] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[1:08:44] Christ if so be that we suffer with them
[1:08:47] we shall also be glorified together amen
[1:08:51] well how did how did Christ suffer he
[1:08:54] suffered 33 years being tempted by the
[1:08:56] devil amen and then he finally his body
[1:09:00] was crucified on the cross what do we do
[1:09:03] we suffer we suffer through the
[1:09:04] temptations amen temptations are going
[1:09:07] to come but we have to suffer with
[1:09:09] Christ through the temptations amen and
[1:09:12] crucify our own flesh and die with him
[1:09:15] as he died on the cross amen
[1:09:18] that's how we have mortify our body hey
[1:09:21] man let's go back a couple chapters to
[1:09:23] Romans chapter 6 just hearing as we get
[1:09:25] it ready to close I hope this is clearly
[1:09:35] a Saints Amen hardness of heart break up
[1:09:41] the fallow ground and a seared
[1:09:43] conscience Romans chapter 6 verse 1 what
[1:09:51] shall we say then shall we continue in
[1:09:54] sin that grace may abound god forbid how
[1:09:58] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[1:10:00] longer therein know ye not don't you
[1:10:03] know know ye not that so many of us were
[1:10:07] baptized as were baptized into Jesus
[1:10:09] Christ were baptized into his death
[1:10:12] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:10:14] baptism into death that like as Christ
[1:10:18] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[1:10:21] of the Father even so also we should
[1:10:24] walk in newness of life amen Sawyer we
[1:10:27] did well
[1:10:28] what do we do so many of us as were
[1:10:30] baptized who in this room was baptized
[1:10:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] amen when you were baptized in the name
[1:10:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[1:10:39] testifying I am dead to sin I am dead to
[1:10:43] the things of the flesh when Satan comes
[1:10:46] to tempt me I'm gonna say no that's what
[1:10:49] we testified in baptism and what God and
[1:10:52] God said that where two or three are
[1:10:54] green touching any one thing what you
[1:10:56] bind on the earth I'll bind it in the
[1:10:58] heavens amen so went or in the water or
[1:11:01] green that you are dead to your sins
[1:11:03] you're dead to the past you're dead to
[1:11:06] the way you used to live God says what
[1:11:08] you bound on the earth I'll bind in the
[1:11:10] heaven and I'm gonna say my Holy Ghost
[1:11:11] down to make sure that you come follow
[1:11:13] through with your word amen so therefore
[1:11:16] just as much as we died with Christ
[1:11:19] through baptism amen we'll be rised up
[1:11:22] from the dead by the glory of the Father
[1:11:24] just like Christ rose up now how did
[1:11:28] Christ right Christ he rose up he was
[1:11:30] shining he meant he he rose up he went
[1:11:32] up into heaven amen he rose up in the
[1:11:35] glory of the Father all all of his body
[1:11:37] amen was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:41] he walked up and walked out and he went
[1:11:42] up to heaven amen and the same glory
[1:11:46] that was upon Christ to quicken his
[1:11:48] mortal body as the same glorious to come
[1:11:51] into us it is the living moving
[1:11:53] breathing holy spirit amen amen amen
[1:12:00] amen now if we be dead with Christ we
[1:12:04] believe that we shall also live with him

[1:12:11] 11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[1:12:15] dead to be dead indeed to son to sin but
[1:12:19] alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
[1:12:22] Lord
[1:12:22] it's our duty amen that's that's why
[1:12:26] we're here
[1:12:26] amen if we're doing something different
[1:12:28] we're doing it wrong amen and and we
[1:12:33] cannot look forward to the life of
[1:12:35] Christ amen verse 12
[1:12:38] let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:12:41] mortal body
[1:12:42] they should obey it in the lusts thereof
[1:12:44] neither yield ye or members as
[1:12:46] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[1:12:48] but yield yourselves unto God as unto
[1:12:52] those that are alive from the dead and
[1:12:55] he members and your members as
[1:12:57] instruments of righteousness unto God
[1:12:59] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:13:04] amen amen let's just stand
[1:13:15] amen we we're trusting in the slain lamb
[1:13:18] Saints amen but the Lord has caused us
[1:13:23] to walk after righteousness how does he
[1:13:25] do it by the leadership of the Holy
[1:13:27] Ghost amen but if any of us has a
[1:13:29] hardened heart a heart whose ground
[1:13:34] cannot receive the word of the Lord or a
[1:13:38] seared conscience where God cannot
[1:13:40] convict us amen and you how can you go
[1:13:44] to heaven I mean it's serious Saints
[1:13:48] Amen it's not something to play with
[1:13:51] you know sin is not innocent amen sin is
[1:13:55] not harmless amen it's not to be played
[1:13:59] with a man as brother Brown says you
[1:14:02] know two men were has stagecoach from
[1:14:06] one town to the next town and and then
[1:14:08] second town was up in the mountains and
[1:14:10] the one man said I can get you up there
[1:14:13] as faster than anybody I can get within
[1:14:15] an inch of the of the of the of the side
[1:14:18] of the trail and not fall off and and
[1:14:20] I'll get you there faster than anybody
[1:14:22] else here and the other man says you
[1:14:25] know you know I may not be as fast as
[1:14:27] the other man all right but I believe in
[1:14:29] playing it safe I maybe I could do as

[1:14:37] make sure that all the way up we're
[1:14:38] gonna make it there we're not going to
[1:14:40] fall off because the goal is to make it
[1:14:43] there amen and that's our goal is not to
[1:14:45] get there trying to see how much we can
[1:14:48] get away with how much soon we can do
[1:14:49] but our goal is to see how close to
[1:14:51] Christ we can get how much we can live
[1:14:53] by His Holy Spirit
[1:14:55] the only way we can do it is if we've
[1:14:57] broken up the fall ground amen only way
[1:14:59] if we've if we've broken up our hardened
[1:15:02] heart amen if our seared conscience can

[1:17:46] challenge of the hour you're living

[1:17:50] than that you're living in the Laodicean
[1:17:52] age contrary outside the camp contrary
[1:17:56] to what God has promised for this hour
[1:17:58] amen and then it's time for us to stop

[1:18:27] them from their wickedness amen I'll set
[1:18:30] them free I'll come and restore I will
[1:18:32] restore saith the Lord God always has a
[1:18:34] way back amen but always takes us to in
[1:18:38] the midst of our blindness in the midst
[1:18:40] of our prison chains to first turn our
[1:18:42] eyes towards God and can repent of our
[1:18:44] sins and say Lord I've done wrong lord I

[1:18:58] a day where we can get by on a dry diet
[1:19:01] confession a mint we're not in a day
[1:19:04] where we can get by with just a dry diet
[1:19:06] confession amen
[1:19:08] repentance as a gift from God and amen
[1:19:11] and it can only be given by God amen we
[1:19:14] cannot make ourselves repent we can try
[1:19:17] we can set ourselves in position but
[1:19:19] ultimately for
[1:19:23] repentance is only given by God a man we
[1:19:26] cannot make ourselves broken but we can
[1:19:29] put ourselves upon the altar amen and
[1:19:32] he'll allow him to break us allow him to
[1:19:35] mold us break me melt me mold me mold me
[1:19:38] into your image all we can do is humble
[1:19:41] ourselves before Jehovah to see if maybe
[1:19:44] you have mercy upon us for what we've
[1:19:46] done to his word amen and that's that's
[1:19:48] what we do is you knows we take his word
[1:19:50] so flippantly amen we play with death so
[1:19:57] flippantly but what and what says that
[1:20:01] he will actually come back to us amen if
[1:20:05] we leave the grace and mercy of God and
[1:20:08] walk out to the things of the devil who
[1:20:11] says that God will actually come back to
[1:20:12] us and revive us again when you walk
[1:20:15] into death how do you know that you'll
[1:20:17] come back life you know uh I write a
[1:20:22] story a few years ago and I'm just gonna
[1:20:23] give it out here I had I had never read
[1:20:27] dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde you know I don't
[1:20:30] know if anybody here has but you always
[1:20:33] hear about dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde so I
[1:20:35] thought well I'll just read that story I
[1:20:37] was shocked at the allegory that it was
[1:20:42] because this this this man mister mr.
[1:20:47] Hyde I believe his name was found a
[1:20:51] scientific concoction that could
[1:20:54] separate when he took it he could
[1:20:56] separate the good part of him from the
[1:20:58] bad part of him
[1:20:59] and he could go and he could whenever he
[1:21:02] drank this this this medicine this
[1:21:05] concoction he could go and live on the
[1:21:07] evil side of him and do everything that
[1:21:10] the evil side of a poem to do and then
[1:21:13] when the concoction wore off he'd go
[1:21:15] back to being the respectable righteous
[1:21:17] mr. Hyde and so by day he was there he
[1:21:21] was a respectable righteous mr. Hyde but
[1:21:24] by night he'd go and he'd drink this
[1:21:26] concoction his whole body would be
[1:21:28] transformed into this hideous a
[1:21:31] demon-possessed man and he'd go out and
[1:21:34] do all these wicked things but and he'd
[1:21:36] go
[1:21:36] and he played both sides of it he was a
[1:21:38] hypocrite but after a while as he did
[1:21:42] this time after time after time he began
[1:21:45] to have a harder time coming back and so
[1:21:49] he's like I'm never gonna do it again
[1:21:50] I'm not gonna do it again I'm not going
[1:21:52] to do it again you know and he swore off
[1:21:53] but after about a year of swearing it
[1:21:56] off all of a sudden he's like oh I'm
[1:21:57] gonna try it again but he found out he's
[1:22:01] kept having a hard time coming back a
[1:22:03] hard time coming back to righteousness
[1:22:06] and then all of a sudden one day he was
[1:22:09] the righteous respectable mr. Hyde was
[1:22:11] sitting in a park and he looked down and
[1:22:13] he had changed into the unrighteous
[1:22:16] version of himself without drinking the
[1:22:19] concoction at all and he tried
[1:22:23] everything he could do to come back and
[1:22:26] and after her days and days of trying he
[1:22:29] came back but every once while he would
[1:22:31] revert back he no longer had any power
[1:22:33] in himself to be righteous or evil he
[1:22:36] was just like a man a swinging gate in
[1:22:38] the wind and no power himself to stay
[1:22:41] wherever he was and the end of that man
[1:22:43] was death he ended up dying himself he
[1:22:48] died in unrighteousness and wickedness
[1:22:52] yoen and a Christian can only play with
[1:22:55] sin so long before it comes to the point
[1:22:58] in time where you yourself will no
[1:23:00] longer have the ability to come back you
[1:23:04] think oh I can repent on my sins all
[1:23:07] I'll do this for now but I'm going to
[1:23:09] repent next week and I'm gonna make it
[1:23:10] right I'm gonna make it right I'm gonna
[1:23:11] make it right but but you're like a gate
[1:23:13] swinging in the wind you don't actually
[1:23:15] know if you can't make it right because
[1:23:17] repentance only comes from God
[1:23:18] repentance is a gift from God himself
[1:23:21] and when you and if you can't if you you
[1:23:23] do not have the assurity that you can
[1:23:26] meet God face to face again what if he
[1:23:29] has hidden his face from you amen none
[1:23:32] of us when you play with sin you're
[1:23:33] playing with hell you're playing with
[1:23:35] death amen and none of us has the
[1:23:38] assurance that we can make it back if we
[1:23:41] go out fight beyond the separating line
[1:23:45] amen as much as we preach predestination
[1:23:48] as much as we preach all these things
[1:23:50] though these other scriptures remain
[1:23:52] true and cannot be trampled upon amen
[1:23:56] the these scriptures remain true and
[1:23:58] cannot be stepped upon amen we have to
[1:24:00] make sure we do not play with the death
[1:24:03] do not play with sin why because none of
[1:24:05] us has the assurance that if we play
[1:24:07] with the devil long enough we notice has
[1:24:09] the assurance of where we can come back
[1:24:11] to a man god bless you let's sing that
[1:24:23] song create in me a clean heart and
[1:24:42] renew the right spirit within me and
[1:25:01] renew the right spirit within me not
[1:25:10] away from thy presence O Lord take not
[1:25:19] thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me
[1:25:30] the joy of thy salvation and renew the
[1:25:38] right spirit within me
[1:25:47] Oh Oh hand into the right spirit within
[1:26:00] me created me O God and renew the right
[1:26:16] spirit within me
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] pass me not away from thy presence oh lo
[1:26:31] take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore
[1:26:41] unto me the joy of thy salvation and
[1:26:50] renew the right spirit within me
