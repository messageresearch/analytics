rapture yes and let nothing stop that i like that i'm sure god is pleased with it too i am living from glory to glory since jesus came into my life my body's been healed and my soul redeemed since jesus came into my life yes cause i'm living [Music] from glory to glory from glory to glory [Music] from glory to glory [Music] all because jesus he came into my life [Music] just i am leaving from glory to glory and i've got a story to take [Applause] how he brought me from glory to glory yes yes i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes [Music] and yes i've got a story [Music] glory to glory oh yes i am from glory to glory all because jesus he came into my life [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh yes i am and i've got a story to test how jesus bought me from glory from glory to glory yes i am glory to glory he came into my life all because he came into my life [Music] yes hallelujah hallelujah and that is the only way it can be done is afterwards when jesus comes into your life as we stand thank god for the word thank god for the songs that have gone up before the lord hallelujah when the saints go marching in i gotta be in that number tell you what that's right never quench the holy ghost when he comes let go and let god have his way because you got to understand that when when an anointing comes on you to worship that's god that's god choosing you can i dance with you hallelujah and when he comes in like that let him go let him go let him go the devil said you're going to fall will fall and roll with it they call us holy rollers anyhow amen people i thought people didn't do that but they do i've seen it with my own eyes and looked like they'd be enjoying themselves yes sir we we're too we're too timid too shy to something i don't know but you know what people heaven is watching us and uh let's just turn to second corinthians please glad to see everybody here appreciate your coming amen by god's grace we just know that god is good to us and we in these last days we looking at the soldiers in this war many wounded soldiers soldiers who are hurt some are out of commission but you never stop praying for them you just you just believe that they're going to return uh on the battlefield amen second corinthians the fifth chapter we're going to start at the 17th verse therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things that are of god who have reconciled and to unto himself by jesus christ let's read that again and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation to with the god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation that's powerful now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ stead be reconciled to god for he have made him to be sin for us hallelujah who knew no sin that he might be made the righteousness of god in him that we might be made the righteousness of god in him let's pray heavenly father we so thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy hallelujah we thank you for being so good to us in spite of these times in these days lord where the battle is intense but father you said that you would keep us that you would shelter us and that you would present us faultless before the throne of god and lord we trust these words we are not able to produce a life of our own but let the life of christ live and reign in us and lord will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i am just going to ask someone to get me some water i left mine back there we're dealing how can i say it i thought i'd just give a little message of grace tonight we've been talking about reaching a higher plane coming to a place where our minds are elevated in a level that god can do with us as he designed to do with us but you must understand that no matter how much bible you preach or how much bible you hear it must be mixed with faith amen the bible said he that cometh to god must believe that he is god and that he is a reward of those that diligently seek him god didn't bring christ to the earth to die for our sins and to raise from the dead just to have some type of drama in history but there was a purpose and we've been talking about that purpose and that is to produce its own kind to bring forth godly men amen men in the image and likeness of god even so much that jesus christ calls us brethren meaning that we've been born of the same mother and father who is jehovah himself i like to give you an understanding that our lives are not to be lives of chance something that is random but we must all begin to focus on why we are here uh i have i remember the time when uh i used to try to be a salesman i tried to be a salesman for amway i tried to be salesman for you know culligan waters and you name it vitamins and herbs and all that kind of stuff and all i could say is that they got a lot of money from me because i realized amen that i could never give them a hundred percent being that i was a christian i could not give them what i knew belonged to god see only christ is supposed to be first in your life everything else is secondary and i couldn't mix it because several times i would go to these meetings and they tried to mix christianity with color gun or mix christianity with amway and and i knew something was wrong with this because my god has never been that right he's a word but we but these people were so sold out to what they believe in matter of fact it in their services it was like a church service it was a religion that they had formed around this product and and so god showed me that but the thing that i like about it was that these people were sincere there was a many people who became multi-millionaires because they gave their all 24 7 to this particular product and i thought to myself you know just thinking they were representatives they were so sold on this product that it was very difficult for you to convince them that it was not worth the money because they could care less how much it cost they figured that this product is worth it and you need to buy it they were representatives they were salesmen and they were good at the diplomacy they were diplomats for it they were able to [Music] get in your spirit they were able to convince you that they were right that's how i got there they made me believe i was a salesman even when i wasn't one and my wife is she worried that's right the truth she knew i wasn't and she tried to tell me but i had to go through several products before i came to recognize i'm not a salesman but it's not like with christ because only christ knows what heaven is like and we are representatives i know that even you know liz paul didn't realize that god was using him tonight as a as a witness to the message in which i'm going to preach because in everything we do we're supposed to wreck uh represents what's going on in heaven father not my will but let thine be done and they're rejoicing over there they're singing they're praising god is that right and they ask jesus father teach us how to pray and he says let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen and truly in this day we who are brides supposed to be the happiest people on the earth and the only reason we're not as happy as we should be is because somewhere we have allowed the word to drop under unbelief an ambassador he's an accredited diplomat not some kind of guy that's just out of school but he's sent by a country or he's an official he's an official uh individual that represents his country paul said we are all ambassadors that means we come from a different place we're going somewhere but while we're here we are on a mission amen hallelujah we're on a mission of reconciliation by the scriptures of god told us amen that christ reconciled the world unto himself and then he sent ambassadors see you can't be a witness unless you've been there you understand me and the only way you can really believe that you're there you've got to believe the word that's right is that right i always go back to when brother adam said i saw you over there that's my revelation i can't give it to nobody else but that's my revelation the saddest thing is we fail to see that we're free he whom the son is set free is free indeed we allow our conscience to condemn us in a daily basis when christ has already set you free because the bible said he whom the son is set free is free indeed there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah now i just read you the scripture and the bible says and telling us amen to which god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself what not imputing their transpasses against unto them it didn't mean that we were not transparent but he said he will not impute that means charge you so every time the devil tries to put you down with a charge you tell him i am free by the blood of jesus christ i am free and you must realize by god's grace you are a representative this is the gospel that you and i supposed to preach to the world to tell them that jesus christ paid the price amen he paid it you owe nothing all the debt has been paid but you got to walk in this liberty hallelujah you must walk in this liberty never say you a hypocrite no i could never be oh yeah yeah i could never be a hypocrite you could never be a hypocrite why because you are accepted in the beloved and christ jesus is not a hypocrite he can never be a hypocrite and as long as you in him you can never be a hypocrite oh people of god is the lies from the devil that satan places on us and keep us from our freedom from our liberty and from witnessing to people to let them know the joys of the lord because the bible said the joys of the lord is your strength hallelujah he strips us by stripping us from our joy and your joy is taken away when you forget what christ has done for you amen hallelujah we're on a journey we're on our way to a new city when the saints go marching in hallelujah it's not that i want to be in that number he's already told me i'm in the number you are in the number hallelujah glory to god is that right we failed to tell people the good news of this message a lot of times people don't even understand that god has moved on and this is a great thing that you and i are experiencing that god can justify us as though we've never sinned in the first place now you've got to believe that right in order to make a rapture you've got to believe that you must believe every word that has been spoken hallelujah because this was not given to you by a man or from a man this came from god through a man hallelujah and only god knew what the unwritten word was nobody else's teaches this hallelujah nobody else just teaches this to understand that we have an unmerited favor and an unmerited love from god hallelujah we didn't know that an unconditional love it ain't what you do it's what he's done for you and a lot of times we fail to see oh i gotta work it i gotta work it you don't have to work it it will work you yes sir god changes you and as long as you're in the way you'll never be changed hallelujah glory to god hallelujah you'll never see a tree bragging on the apples look at all my apples i got more apples than you that tree has nothing to do with how many apples comes on that tree it is a predestinated elected thought of god that makes each apple tree bring forth its fruit and every apple tree has a number of fruit that it will bear and then it dies you understand me you say well oh brother brooks what do you mean you better thank god this is free you better thank god that you don't have to work it you better thank god amen that god has set you free amen you better thank him you know brother branham tried to tell us and every time he thought about god he started getting happy and running around trees and you know their show that he showed that you know he was standing i saw him standing up on a pulpit a podium now how did he get up there i think brother liz could have jumped up there tonight yeah i'm i'm telling it all the camera may not have seen it yeah that was him amen and it's a good thing it's a good thing don't ever let it die don't ever let it die don't worry about your neighbors and what they think about it it's between you and god he chose to dance with you hallelujah think about it if jesus was in the flesh right now we want to dance with you amen we just i can't do that because everybody looking forget it who cares i've been waiting for this touch and this refreshing for a while hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying i'd love to see everybody in this church amen become like popcorn popping up because of the anointing so on fire you just pop and pop that's where it used to be and jesus don't change we change we we're the ones that get all sophisticated and you know we're the ones that get in this mood that you know holiness is being steal no that ain't holiness that's dead starchiness is an offense to god did y'all know that being starchy is an offense to god amen read your message you'll find out representatives chosen to act on the behalf of another now god did not sent us here to blend in because light and darkness have no fellowship we're of two different worlds hallelujah and so therefore you say well lord i've been doing wrong so you're not the only one peter james john william branham everybody has done wrong nobody i said nobody was able to loose to see us to open the book or to look there on amen hallelujah what are you saying brother brooks we're in the same boat it takes the blood of jesus christ to set us all free and he has why should i be sad well lord i can't overcome just hold on you're not the overcomer he's the overcomer hallelujah hello somebody but don't forget it never comes when you think it ought to it comes when he knows it's going amen everything is an appointed time oh you say well what do you mean remember those two neighbors one had a guard on the neck and one had this thing with their stomach and they went through the prayer line with brother branham and and god told both of them no by calling by name told them where they would live y'all remember amen brother battle went hunting amen i think jack moore whoever it was amen and and uh and and the man let him you know uh use the land to hunt but he wanted to know who told or what told that man the name of those two women and what their ailments were he wanted to know and brother brown said just just wait right here and think about how come that water didn't come down that pole and and i'll tell you when i get back who told me told you yeah it's you amen what's his name would it be brandon yeah that's brown well that's me y'all understand me i'm paraphrasing but the point is he won and he brought an infidel to christ a man who did not even believe in god he didn't go into some deep theological stuff he took the very things of nature to convince the man that god is real sometimes we think we we think too oh this man got the doctor divinity who cares he knows greek i know english and i know god amen who cares about greed they all argued even in that time which greek word was right they're still doing it upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him now i'm saying all of these things to you today because i'm going to tell you something it takes a strong faith to handle the word the hand of the sword it takes a strong faith when all around you got evidence that you are a failure and it takes strong faith to believe that you're more than a conqueror that's true you understand me and that word says you are more than a conqueror hallelujah and you got to understand if that be the case yes we're like under the seventh seal like gideon you know it talks about that you know here was gideon amen and he's among the midianites who call which is called strife and y'all know how that go and we realized by the grace of god and then god had to convince gideon that he was more than a conqueror that he was a mighty man available and let me tell you something we are here now yes sir amen hallelujah and it's all right to say lord give me a sign but you know in the message they said don't do that that's too pentecostal well gideon didn't care he had gotten a visualization from the angel and he still asks for a sign lord y'all understand me these intellectual folks makes me mad because you know what they do they do just like those midianites they bring strife between the believer what is and what is not and then they try to elevate themselves but if you ordained by god you have a right to ask your father amen help me lord i've been in this strife i've been among the message i've seen them fight here and fight there they they they grieve in the holy ghost and if god be with us where be the miracles amen oh you shouldn't ask for no miracle come on where is it i don't heard what you did through william branham i want to see god do it today amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes now come on people every one of us young people y'all need to see god real not just in preaching you need to see him amen hallelujah that's the problem people are not seeking god in such a way that god can manifest himself hallelujah i am but i'ma tell you it's been a battle it's been a battle but i will not give up because i know god is real hallelujah i'm a representative hallelujah and so are you how can i sell my product if i don't know it works hallelujah but jesus christ works he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not he's real hallelujah i've seen him work miracles even in my own life you say god is dead no god cannot be dead i'm i'm the very image of him i'm i'm what god made because without him i wouldn't be the way i am i've seen god change me hallelujah psychology couldn't do it mind over matter couldn't do it nothing could do it but jesus did it once and for all hallelujah don't let the devil keep keep you kicking you down and making you long-face it and like oh god of the rapture takes place i'm gonna be left behind there is no such a thing of being left behind if you bride god cannot leave bride up behind y'all understand me if you are bride and you must first believe that you are yes amen if you are bride walk like it talk like it act like it hallelujah is that right when you really believe the word and i'm gonna tell you something you become an invincible army nothing can defeat you it's only when you let down the bars right amen i don't know about you but god is moving in my heart and in my life to form and shape me into his very image and likeness i'm not ashamed to say that i'm not afraid to say it i know god is doing it brother books do you make mistake plenty of them plenty of them hallelujah as long as this flesh is here you're going to make mistakes but that's not what god is working on he's working on the inner man he's producing character on the inside of you not this wonder these days this will be redeemed but right now your flesh has not been redeemed it's working for god what yes your your flesh is your enemy amen hallelujah and your flesh is working for god satan is using it but he doesn't know understand that the life that's in in you the more pressure he puts on you the better the man inside becomes hallelujah come on somebody there is no such thing oh i just feel like turning around turn it around to where amen where are you going to go how can you serve the devil who's afflicting you where are you going to go i've seen so many people getting trapped and now they don't even know how to get out of it saying so god let me tell you something don't let the devil fool you you get in the trap they know so it ain't easy getting out hallelujah oh yeah nothing but the truth god is good all the time is that right how many all believe this first corinthians 15 49 says and we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenly how many all believe that i believe i believe that i received that hallelujah you know you get people and they just carry on and bless it be the god of william branham bless it be the god of william branham blessed be the god of isaiah brooks yes y'all understand me blessed be the god of isaiah brooks amen amen when moses went up on the mountain god said to him i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob hallelujah amen but when god told moses said he'd already introduced himself i am the god of abraham and jacob right so so wait a minute i am the god of william branham is that right you can put his name there but then moses comes along and says lord who shall i say who should i say sent me and god didn't say tell him i'm the god of abraham i said no he said what i am hallelujah that's what you must understand you become god's i am amen he sends you you're the reconcile the world christ in you reconciling the world to himself you amen showing the world that there is another level of existence and that existence is in god in christ hallelujah i heard brother branham said i today i heard i was listening to him he said he said i feel so good i feel like i could jump to the seventh dimension i never heard him say that i'm like i'm coming too hallelujah that's right because that's where we belong if you overcome this world i will grant that you will set in my throne even as my father i've sat in my father's storm hallelujah you understand me that's a position amen hallelujah i believe that i believe that you love the lord hallelujah i hope i can find what i'm looking for here see that's god's purpose that's one of those scriptures out of oneness that's god's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family adam and eve right and the only way they could be one with the family or with god because god's nature was in them so that made them with god's nature in them see then with each of the others in god they become all one now let me stop there because sometimes when we think that we got god's nature in us we've got to be a superman raising the dead and healing the sick and the eyes of the blind open that ain't for everybody hallelujah amen remember you know one sister say brother branham says uh uh i said i pray and fast all the time and i i need teach me how to cast out devil he said that ain't your calling your calling is to fast and pray yes amen see everybody don't you you can can't you see the mess this would be if everybody had the ability to think you know to do things oh my goodness that's what jealousy and envy and strife and is that right look at the corinthians church on the least of all gifts when it came to tongues everybody wanted to speak in tongues and prophesy and all of the stuff hey you know paul says okay this is all right for you to desire that but you see that's not given to everybody that's right amen amen we must find our slot our position and be content with it because you know what the devil thinks he'll make you think you're not a christian because you're not laying on those hands on the sick and casting out devils and seeing miracles and you're the biggest miracle you're the greatest there is no greater miracle than to see a soul saved don't let the devil put those things in your mind like that because he's done it for me but you're the one who's testifying to all nature that god is real hallelujah you know you can meet a muslim and they can call you down and say well you know how can you prove god is real you know jesus didn't rise from the dead because that's what they think they think they said jesus took some kind of mandarin weed right and he went to sleep and i think it was like heartbeat one minute or an hour once some hour whatever the case may be right hallelujah but you failed to see amen they failed to see that he did raise from the dead have you ever thought about why the world hate the name jesus and i hate to say it message people do too they don't say they do but you know they stutter and then to talk about jesus and don't even realize the spirit that they're under hallelujah but there's only power in only one name and that name is the name of jesus christ well it's true hallelujah i was somewhere uh well here and the brother says well let me let me read a quote because i don't want nobody to get mad what that's nonsense preach the inspiration of god how you learn about it i used to worry too because there were people saying you ain't preaching the message until you give a quote hallelujah i don't quote because people want it i quote because i'm led to do it you understand me hallelujah exactly right he said now now understand what i'm working with all of my children have different gifts but yet they have the same blood all of them can't see you understand me now daddy can sing they say but everybody can't sing like daddy y'all understand what i'm saying but because they can't sing doesn't mean they're not myself my daughter or my son that's right hallelujah now think about it now this might sound a little i can do some baking i can do some cakes and things like that most of y'all know that and now they know it all over the world but nevertheless i have a daughter who outshines me she never went to school but she can do such hard work and and the cakes are delicious i didn't have to teach her that it came by way of the bloodline amen y'all understand and i'm trying to tell you something you know we get on ourselves because we're not always witnessing is not always talking that's right witnessing is living it the best witnessing you could do is to live a holy life in the face of sinners you'll make them thirsty if you are salty you understand me it ain't always i got to tell them you don't have to tell them and don't tell them until jesus moved you to tell him that's right amen why the bible said don't cast your pearls upon the swines there's a reason for it amen every child of god must be led by god hallelujah it's not because i feel like it it's because god is leading me you we look at the scripture and we see well brother books what are you trying to say if we're going to represent god we need to live it amen amen hallelujah how many of y'all believe you you bearing this earthly i said that but if god is saying there's another world and that you to be born into it y'all know why i'm talking about this we're talking about a rapture we're talking about a changing of the body but we must first understand that before the change of this natural body the changing of the inner man must change first god ain't going to put this wonderful new man and keep him in a dirty vessel hallelujah and god is not going to take his holy spirit and put it in a dirty vessel amen hallelujah is that all right you say well brother brooks i make mistakes we all make mistakes but i'm gonna tell you something before you got the holy ghost in your soul there was a fire cleansing you and brother said once that that seed is quickened the womb is shut but it does not stop the devil from anointing your spirit and your flesh oh i got the holy ghost you got it sure i believe that hallelujah well you know just like a lot of people thought well you know people couldn't get the corona if they had the holy ghost that's nonsense people die you mean to tell me that true saints of god can't die from cancer you're going to die from something and guess what that cancer that takes them out that's a demon that flesh ain't no good understanding it's your enemy am i making sense but we must see what i'm trying to get us to see is that we must break through a break from ourselves in order to tell somebody else about christ you can't witness a good witness if you don't have the joy of the lord yourself oh don't you know about that see what it is we have come to a place where the intellectual part of this message is not doing the doing its job you understand what i mean by that i'm not saying it's not good it's excellent it's powerful but without the holy ghost it can't live amen the holy ghost makes it live folks and you and i need that i don't care i don't care you need to stay with god until you convince that you got it and if you do have it guess what it's going to bring about changes changes in your life that you won't have nothing to do with glory hallelujah is that all right i had a friend tell me that and i know he did he loved peanut butter and then he got the corona and that corona changed his taste buds so much so that he can't hardly stand to smell peanut butter now if the demon can bring a change what about the holy ghost you understand what i'm trying to say give god the chance let go and let god this is going to end and it's going to end sooner than most of us think oh lord help us jesus talking about a new world i don't know about you everybody talking about a new world order i'm talking about a new world order too but it ain't going to be here hallelujah you love the lord you know the thing about it is i think we come to a place you and i must understand there is nobody good my good pastor oh my pastor i know y'all don't talk about me like that but still yeah i've heard people talk about their good pastors ain't nobody good he falls just like you false he gets up just like you gets up right and you and i must understand that christ must be real question and answer he says so christ in your heart that's real christ and the holy spirit christ means anointed one and the holy spirit is that anointing you are the one that's anointing anointed seed and it's christ and you anointing you but let me go to this to keep the anointing oil flowing you've got to have prayer you understand me prayer must be an important part and you can't tell me the devil don't fight you in prayer because he fights me hallelujah he always wants to cheat god and he teach god by way of prayer you understand me by you not praying so you and i must understand it doesn't matter if i can shout dance speak in tongues roll all over the floor all of that is good but brother said don't depend on that hallelujah he said the holy spirit is a being it's god god in you the person god that's lit your whole entire being and how many of us feel that way even if you don't feel that way now i'm sure at some point in time you did everything was lit up and you know what the problem god says the only thing that can stop that is when you got flues that are clogged inlets and outlets that you've allowed satan to clog up your your sensitive part that spirit part of you envy strife forgiveness whatever it may be right clogging you up and now you don't feel the presence of the lord the way you used to and i'm gonna tell you something folks the bible tells us to separate ourselves from all unbelief sometimes when you see people talking all that negative stuff you need to tell them because if you don't tell them that a negative atmosphere will affect you hallelujah you love god amen let's move on by god's grace i'm trying to find something jumping probably all over it i'm used to my ipad amen you love god amen let's uh let's go to uh one more scripture i i didn't plan to keep belong but i wanted to really encourage you because i needed it today if that makes sense i needed it today myself and through this message god encouraged me and he made me see that i didn't come here amen to be part of a lodge or club i came to represent heaven and if every day if any day passed by and i'm not representing heaven i'm failing my work i'm failing my job y'all understand me it doesn't matter anymore whether people like you that doesn't matter it's like oh you know and i used to go witnessing a lot more than i do now and when people see me they say oh here come the jws y'all know what jws are jehovah witnesses because they're the only ones that see you see out there and that's that's a call but at least they believe in what they believe enough to knock on people's doors and get the door slammed in their face right you got to give honor to them at least they believe in what they believe enough to get out there what about us you know in the message we try to make excuses well it's over when when you better think god is not it ain't over god's still saving souls is that right and brother brown said when that last one comes in it might be a book or tape y'all understand that that means amen he doesn't have to do nothing but have the faith in that word and brother said the rapture takes place that's what i was trying to bring out about enoch enoch had nothing to do but to walk with god that's all you have to do and you think that's easy not in this age every demon out of hell amen is fighting you on a daily basis to keep you from walking with god and that means staying within the word amen no lust of the eye no lust of the flesh no pride of life staying in that word with humility i was trying yeah he he you know and people don't know the importance of humility humility is wonderful but nobody wants to humble themselves to it but humility is wonderful amen that's what brother adam said he christ defeated satan with sweetness and meekness i can't get over that quote sweetness and meekness now you better do it now that's not christ it's amazing how we want to handle other people but when god when it comes to us we want people to handle us in a different way hallelujah they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god turn with me to hebrew please hebrews 12. and i'll let that be i'm not going like i said i'm not going to be long this is a wednesday but i just wanted to give a word of encouragement something to set you free hallelujah because i know the devil and the devil is always accusing the saints of god always making you feel like i gotta work it out work it out work it out no he wants to work it out of you [Laughter] he wants to get it all out of you so that he can see some joyful faces right oh it's terrible it's terrible when everybody looks sad you know everybody happy amen god got it all in control before i forget that song i sang tonight would be a good one for you sister i ain't going to call your name but it would be a good song for you hallelujah yes the grace of god what i said second korean hebrews i'm sorry hebrews 12th captive look at this scripture wherefore beginning at the first verse wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin with that so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us we've got people who have witnessed uh think about it we call ourselves abraham's seed and the bible said abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker was god his whole life was looking for that city now he was distracted but it did not stop him for coming to the place where the city was my face brother said the very place abraham's finally he finished ended his journey he said he did not even know but the city was standing above him a different dimension but it was there hallelujah he went through a lot of things but he got there and you and i we're looking for a city whose building and maker is god oh not one made out of brick and mortar but a celestial body a celestial city that god himself and god only can make witnesses like daniel i know he's real hallelujah i saw him come through when i was in the lion's den those are people who says i know he's real y'all understand what i'm saying uh other hebrew boys they can say it when i was in the fiery furnace i know he's real witnesses we've got people from genesis to revelation huh oh adam couldn't even say he told me i was going to die and and i did spiritually but the grace of god flew a lamb and set me free i know he's real see we've got too many people who know he's real to ever doubt that he's real right think about it people it is a real situation that we're working with and you know what god didn't leave us 2 000 years ago no sir he brought a malachi 4 a representative an ambassador from christ to show that the city was real not only did he show us the power of the city but he showed us the king of the city the man who sent him is now sending you to do the same works they'll do the same works that's what the bible says the same words amen the same things the same power the same everything but you know what we've had too many many nights around us people calling strife and you know we you know want to tell you something people that's why brother ram said it it's going to be such a few that make a rapture we we too we're too busy and i'm going to tell you something the media and all of the stuff makes us even more busier we got enough stuff but we want to learn what everybody else is doing right and it just causes problems within your own spirit it causes problems i'm not saying it's all evil no it's evil and it's good you can find some good out there but the point is when you see like even in this little church if there be any rumor of evil moving you need to stop it and don't let anybody move you should be because that's the spirit of the mennonites it's here to call strife and when strife is uh among us is that right the bible tells us amen when when when we war against us each other every evil work is present every evil work and so we must fight to keep the unity of the spirit in this church you understand me you gotta fight we should never allow anybody to speak evil of your pastor your deacon your trusty or the musicians nobody i don't care if they're a door keeper this is your house now there are things i can say to my wife that nobody else better not say and there are things she can say to me nobody else can say all right can you imagine somebody come up to wife let me let me tell you about your husband make sure you got it filmed you understand me because you and i must understand amen every man will protect his own and the bible says a wise woman buildeth her house this is a church this is a church likened unto a woman and you must understand it's your duty to make sure that this fellowship is built correctly amen it's your duty let's move on one more looking unto jesus right let me let me let me move back here wherefore go to the cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beside us and let us run with patience patience patience patience patience the race that is set before us i think we forget that word patience [Music] god do it for me and do it quickly show me anywhere he ever did anything quickly huh even with gideon god could have wiped out the many nights but god put gideon through all of that i want to say stuff but that ain't the right word all of those trials because he knew what it was going to take for gideon to really become a believer it took gideon for real to hear the enemy talk about how great god was his own god they're back in the enemy camp selling telling telling talking to each other about how great gideon god is now if the sinners know it it's about time for us to wake up looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god when you think your suffering for consider him that endures such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be weary and thanked in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as into children by sons my son despise not thou the chastity of the lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him now and i'mma close on this because sometimes we think oh the devil is no no sometimes god is rebuking and we need to find out which it is when you know you've done wrong and something wrong goes around come around don't worry about it just say thank you jesus and hallelujah anyhow because it's all for your good everything's working for your good but a real son and daughter of god will never run away from him they run to him whenever they chase right even the bible says look look look look at they have they haven't been the worst king amen that israel ever had and i rebuked him and abe ahab repents before god look at him god is a real stubborn person when they don't want to repent but may god have us help us because god knows how to make that happen amen you love the lord i just want to give a word of encouragement i'm working on a a real good message for sunday and i trust the lord allow me to speak it if it's his will um i'm not going to tell you what it is but it i trust that we have a good service i mean i know this sunday will be a holiday and people are going to go off and do what they got to do and and um i'm not gonna charge them i'm not you know we've been locked up by kobe so long we all need a break sometimes but uh so anyway but i trust that they come i've got by god's grace some things that i've been working on and studying and trusting that the lord will bring it to a place where i can pull it all together it's not my thoughts they're his thoughts but i believe that it'll be a blessing to the bride of jesus christ and i i'm gonna keep working on this higher plane here the spirit of your mind right the spirit of your mind let this mind be in you we've got to come to because i'm going to tell you something if you don't allow god to bring you to this place satan is going to make havoc out of you hallelujah you ever seen a mice being caught by a uh a cat ever seen it and the cat will play with the mice slap him everywhere do whatever he wants until he's ready to eat him and that's the way the devil does if he catches you he gonna play with you and throw you up against the wall and do all kinds of stuff to you and then he will devour you if somebody don't come rescued that's what the devil does i've seen people who who come to christ god deliver them from drugs and alcohol they can all kinds of stuff and they forget where they came from all it takes is one pause is that right that's exactly what brother adam said said oh nell she paused for a moment thought about how it was in that old life to dance on that floor the next thing she knew she was in somebody's arm not realizing and i didn't read that quote but i wanted to read it there's influences from both sides either from heaven or hell and she did not understand that that influence was not of god until she got on the floor and you can't tell me that nell knew she had a demon i don't believe she did but she knew she needed to repent brother bill brother bill right it was when god when he began to pray is when nell realized it wasn't just her feelings there was an influence of a demon that had her go do that and he occupied her until brother branham cast the demon out you love the lord understand that every influence whether be of god or whether it be of the of the devil amen the purpose for the influence is to find a doorway into your spirit let's stand thank you lord amazing grace always be my song of praise for it was great that i'll never know just how [Music] beyond all of my thoughts and saw i need [Music] i shall only [Music] to the cross where jesus died oh me how am i the last [Music] he looked beyond all my faults and saw my needs i share [Music] my foreign [Music] play [Music] [Music] encouraging amen message i appreciate it brother amen appreciate the lord amen amen amen let's um i think brother you have a song special that you would like to sing amen come on up and then we'll close with amen oh okay you got that amen god bless you um on my way i was at church today and then on my way back home oh god just put this song in my heart if not for grace and then and then um on my way coming to church i was just singing this uh in the car and i just just i'm just i don't even have words because i'm just very thankful for the grace of god in my life and um and then i came late to church so that's why i didn't sing that earlier but when brother brooks mentioned um that he was gonna talk about a message of grace i just i just was like yeah this this was guy just putting this song in my heart to sing and i'll just sing that i i didn't practice so if i mess up on the keyboard where would i be you only know i'm glad you see through eyes an empty place [Music] see [Music] is surrounding me i thank you [Music] i know amazing grace was love [Music] amazing grace i once was is an empty place [Music] sing lord i thank you amen amen i don't know if we know this song i don't think we have it but it's old song lord i thank you thank you thank you all the days of my life amen oh lord i thank you thank you thank you lord i thank you thank you thank you lord i thank you all the days of my life lord i thank you thank you thank you lord i thank you thank you thank you lord i

the days of my life once again oh lord i thank you thank you thank you lord i thank you thank you stay here lord i thank you all the days of my life oh lord i thank you thank you thank you you thank you thank you lord i thank you for all the days of my life amen praise the lord god bless you amen brother friend yes [Music] i don't want anybody to think that my wife is a mean woman or something i used her for an example but she's never had to defend me like that and i trust by god's grace we'll never have to do that you know sometimes we are we we can be sensitive to things and you know i try my best not to use anybody for an example because it kind of puts them on the spot so forgive me if i did wrong there but anyway let us pray i thank god for the services we thank god for all of you who did come out to the house of god i trust the word was a blessing to you i know that i needed encouragement myself today i go through trials just like everybody else you know but when god comes down and shows you exactly why you're having the troubles that you're having again you begin to understand you're not putting god first sometimes we think we are and then god has to show you you're not putting me first there's a will there that you're performing and it's not mine and this is what god revealed to me and he showed me by god's grace that i'm an ambassador not only just me but all of us are and each moment that we get the chance to tell somebody about our place we need to do so and show them that it's free of charge there's no fees of interest when you get in you approach the gate the price has already been paid and so i thank god for this amazing man thank you for the song brother i appreciate that god is good let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and i know lord god if if i don't know anything i know one thing that grace is the key grace is what gave us election and election is what give us grace and father we just pray that you bless the hearers of the word tonight whether it be by way of the youtube or the internet however they may be listening to let them know that the pipe hallelujah the price has been paid there is no guilt that we should bear of our own because of christ you have set us free of the guilt consciousness and thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord to know that there was only one perfect man and that was you christ jesus and that our lives are healing sheltered by your blood bless each and every heart as we travel lord going to our destinies our place of rest we pray that lord that you give us all good night sleep and good night rest for those who care and father we thank you for all that you do for us to now and forever in jesus christ's name we pray as we are dismissed amen [Music] so [Music] you
