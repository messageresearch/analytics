the church service with you this morning and amen enjoyed ourselves here yesterday evening always enjoyed coming by amen des moines is just fellowship with brother brooks and the church here amen brother brooks and i go way way back a long time ago amen while he was still in okay all right all right good i've used interpreters before so amen if you have your bibles and you want to read with me we're going to be reading in the first chapter of job this morning amen amen we'll try not to run out of battery tonight like we did last night amen greetings from fort smith arkansas salutation the fourth myth arkansas and the eagle lighthouse tabernacle eagle eagle lighthouse tabernacle eagle lighthouse.nicole hey man amen and some of the other brothers have been down to worship with us in our annual meetings and they've always been a blessing to us amen let's read from job chapter one beginning in verse one through verse five there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and his chewed evil [Music] his substance also was seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred shi acids and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east descent and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually economy job appellation [Music] amen may god add his blessing to the reading of his word amen does anybody have a is their homeland liberia no no one in the congregation all right we we hope to go back to liberia for easter and we certainly covet your prayers amen this morning i want to speak to you some of the characteristics of job certain characteristics job is of course a much discussed character in the bible [Music] and we often talk about job's three friends i mean i remember job actually has five friends in the in this book and we're going to discuss his five friends and some of the hidden attributes of job amen now we know that job is mentioned only one time in the new testament and that's in the book of james chapter 5 verse 11. and the scripture says behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord and that the lord is very pitiful and tender and of tender mercy james 5 11. um amen we take the the greek word for job and we know that it means the cry of woe amen but we go back to the book of the hebrew understanding of the word [Music] and it means is hated um is hated amen despised unlike me i mean sometimes the way i feel satan feels towards me amen is that as satan hated job i mean he despises us that he sought to stop job's life in the lord amen but god had a plan for jesus amen i know that you are familiar with the book of job and in these 42 chapters there's 12 divisions of the life of job you don't see and like in the first chapter of the book of job amen it introduces job and as the position of high priest for his family position you see what job is doing he's he's he's busy interceding for his family and that was the position of the high priest in the old testament he was a go between between god a righteous god and a sinful congregation and the high priest would offer the blood amen that would be a buffer between the wrath of god and a sinful people we find the same thing in the book of revelation amen because in the book of revelation john tells us that there is a message of grace and peace from god and we find out that those seven church age messengers brings to the bride of jesus christ not a message of defeat not a message of weakness but a message of power or vice versa amen and a message of the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] hallelujah amen it's not just a bunch of laws and we're going to talk about some of them today remember this message of the hour amen is a message of grace and peace that god wants us to have of ourselves [Music] uh now the power that i'm looking for amen it's not the power to create a another literal world remember the gospel message that brings me out of the ranks of sin that takes me from being what i was in the world again son of god and as being a king in my that you don't rule over me i'm taking my position as a ruler over usually can you say amen for the message of the hour amen so we begin to see why job is hated by lucifer amen is because his position of priesthood is going out every day offering a burnt sacrifice amen for his children just in case amen now you say well that that sounds like it's so simple bro amen but let's read what brother branham said about it in 1962 in a message absolutely absolutely brother brown said joe know that he had done jehovah's bidding can you say amen i want to have faith in what i'm doing too i've all fought on scripture you know how i can have faith in what i am doing because it's not my message right amen it's god's message amen i have faith in what i am doing because another said do it say amen somebody else had already said do it okay can amen so brother ben said and he had faith in what he'd done but of course jehovah required it and we can just do that jehovah required a burnt offering for his sins and sacrifice and job not only for himself but for his children can you say amen oh i wish that's all he required today brother adams it's less than that just faith in his words amen any divine promise in the bible [Music] [Music] absolute is the word of god amen so it's about the same thing isn't it if the prophets you are absolute and his absolute is the word of god and that makes the word of god [Music] satan makes his two appearances before the throne of god and you know why he's there amen it's recorded in job chapter 1 verses 6 through 8. both of these are the same thing but we're just going to read job 1 6 through 8. now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them now this does not say that satan and jesus christ are brothers that's not what it's saying at all and the lord said unto satan whence cometh now satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in all the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that fear is god and destroys estrus amen now here god is bragging on job can god knew amen and he wrote them on the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world amen there's nothing that comes into your life that is a surprise to god he might not be talking about job's present life as job was offering these daily sacrifices he looks at the end of job's life amen and he knows the end of job's life is better than the first video and that's where we want to get to isil amen you remember isaiah 46 10. and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand [Music] depends on what god has determined it to be deep do you have a determination you're going to have a part to play in parties amen but when god called your name it wasn't a mistake so that you will surrender yourself to god that's what he's doing in job's life he's the secret faith now there's the first three friends of job i won't call their names amen because it's just too difficult for me to speak amen but they hear about job's suffering amen you remember them called job's comforters right they hear about how much job is suffering he's lost his sons and daughters he's lost all of his riches the confidence of his wife why don't you curse god and die amen must be that job is expressing a great deal of confidence and amen what's been taking place amen so job's visitors come and they don't even recognize who he is loving his sons and daughters he's been brought so low amen there he sets on that heap of ashes everything he has has been taken from him amen and his friends don't even recognize who he is they begin to weep when they realize that it's him and without speaking to him they spend seven days and seven nights in total silence just think about the situation now get a vision of what it looks like this man that god has bragged on and this man that was once rich and happy that even his friends are weeping for him [Music] and there he sets on that airship elijah amen we might go through seven church ages and not really see the depth amen of what god has in store for us amen but the holy ghost is going to bring us an understanding amen this message is not going to remain just amen something on the shelf amen this message of the hour the messiah is revealing jesus christ and in the last days and then we know what's going to happen with her amen now some of you young people don't don't ever get discouraged with a message amen don't ever say i can't do because of the message of the hour the message of the hour has some of the greatest things for the bride still to come out the glory of god amen it's not a dead message by me small it's very much alive you see only amen as christ steps out of revelation and reveals himself to his bride and she rises to the occasion of receiving her seed word according to revelation chapter 12. you want to make the devil made i do hey man you want to stir him up amen you know why it's because we are living the life of jesus christ he does it through the bride of jesus christ brother said she is him amen i'm talking about you you are him personified in this and he goes out to destroy us but in the rapture god takes the bride out of here to her place for three and a half years amen amen but because we're bringing forth that life amen after job's friends come and they have this conversation with joe have you said conversational job amen job begins to get a message of despair about himself he begins to say curse it is the day that i was born amen some of this why am i suffering some of these things amen and these three friends if it wasn't me do not recognize who job is or what is taking place in the life of job and as job begins to hear these negative reports it begins to reflect on his nature amen now i'm going to say some things about job that we might not have heard before amen job begins to curse the day that he was born some of his underlying characteristics of character begins to be revealed all of job's three friends all they can say to him job you are a secret sinner amen satan never talked to you like that that's cause i don't satan never tell you you've done something that god ain't going to forgive you for it amen satan never tell you something amen that you're a wicked person he's looking at the present time he don't know the revelation that's waiting out there and he's trying to condemn your present life he don't know that god has something greater for you hey man he don't know that there's a new birth amen he don't know that there's a justified experience where god takes everything you've ever done and not only hides it under the blood of jesus no sir he does more than hide it the blood of jesus christ amen makes your sin hallelujah as if it never was in the first place amen that even god can't remember it satan remembers it and you remember it amen but god don't remember him all the power of god amen we look at these things we see job's three friends amen and how he has executed the office of high priest faithfully for his family the sovereign amen and then satan's great desire to cause job to fail come on fight the job and then it's three three friends offer him no comfort at all amen you remember what paul said in galatians chapter three verse eleven paul said but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for i see those three friends coming down to talk to jobs it was now we know that and i'm going to say something here but just wait till the end before you make a a judgment on it amen but it never took away the guilt of sins god with abraham god tried covenant after covenant after covenant with abraham and with adam and with noah and all of them and all those covenants failed to save amen now all three of those things that i just mentioned could never bring the refreshing of the holy ghost into the lives of the people and when i think of job's friends those three friends i think of him not able to bring job any comfort at all job needs answers he needs results amen but these three friends come and offer him nothing but a man condemnation oh i'm glad for a message of grace amen and we'll call this man job's fourth friend amen eli who is younger than those three original friends that come down amen and as as he begins to talk with these men he shows a great deal of respect for their age while all these three friends are condemning job and seeing all these harsh things and causing uh calling job a secret sinner and all that amen eli who just sets back patiently apart amen he's just waiting for them to finish their conversation just like the bible says the law came by moses amen comes by jesus christ do you believe that amen so these three to me amen represent the law situated and what the law could not do amen the message of grace and peace accomplished it completely what these original three comforters is [Music] he waits for moses while they're doing all that they know to do hello but elijah the younger friend [Music] the man says out of respect i didn't speak especially but now that you've done your speaking i mean let me talk listen can you say amen room for my message hallelujah justification makes way for sanctification sanctification makes way for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost makes way for the holy ghost himself amen amen so out of respect eli who waits for the other three to come to the end of their conversations and they say job there's no reason for us to continue talking to you whatever whatever we say to you hey man you don't pay any attention to us [Music] amen now comes elijah and the first thing he lie who does amen as he turns to the three friends of job the three friends that could not help him i've got a message for you you know in other words elijah begins to rebuke those three friends hallelujah i'm glad i've got someone on my side i'm glad the holy ghost is raptured this is amen and some of these things are important but the most precious things in our life is not our homes it's not our cars it's not our careers can you that eternal seal of god so eternal because once that seal is made on the soul that soul is sealed unto the day of redemption is careers hello get your diplomas don't forget the holy ghost glory to god look what god has given us at this good journey hallelujah amen but there's something else that we got to deal with with job yeah he's done the required thing yeah uh because he knows all that god required no one can accuse job of failing to do what god required amen every born-again son and daughter of god wants to do what god requires [Music] there's a letter on your pastor's desk that i was reading a few moments ago amen about some of the things that some preachers preach about things that makes no difference at all amen but you know god never gave his word without giving us an understanding of it amen we know about deuteronomy 22 5 excuse me we know about deuteronomy 22 5. which talks about those who are abomination through cross-dressing um amen now that's not just the law god didn't just bring that out of the heavens and give it to moses just to make a law journal but the hebrews are coming out of egyptian captivity they've been called taught all kinds of precepts and they're in route to the promised land and when they get into the promised land they're going to find many traditions of the egyptians there and they're going to find worship of baal right worship of esther and the fire god moloch they're all in canaan and the way that these people worship their deities amen worship of false gods is an abomination to god it's amen we are we the the preachers the amen are teaching the people and as they come out of their offices to bring the people into a worship of the false gods and god is guiding his people to the promised land a man in his condition and when you get into the promised land don't do the things that the heathens are doing you understand why god says the apostle paul picks up on it also amen and he leaves instructions with timothy amen about modest apparel right amen it's not laws amen it's what god wants to guard his people from being overtaken of the spirit of the world amen that's the exact reason you have the conflict in the world today and the preachers are offering to people a compromise amen because of the spirits that's in the land that job needs a revelation it is impossible to please god we need a revelation hello the message that grace has for the law amen romans 8 3. for what the law could not do what job's first three friends could not do school and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son do you always you remember what jesus christ is now is god robbing himself in flesh amen because the law couldn't do what god needs done amen now he's going to rebuke jobs as good as the burnt offerings were for jobs they still only had a shadow of good in them they were good right it's what god required it was good but it only had a shadow of grace in it because god's always wanted to express his grace hebrews 10 1 shows us that god always wanted to express his grace for the law having a shadow of good things to come that's good do you hear that yes had a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things that representation in other words it showed what god wanted but it couldn't do it and paul continues to say people continue can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year sacrificing so all the law could not have been darkness there has to be a certain percent of light in the darkness to make a shadow but they could find nothing to help him amen and he even turns toward those three friends and rebukes them because they did nothing and support a man of jokes just like a bunch of criticism telling you how bad you are but the message of grace amen says he overcome for you all you've got to do is get in him he's already overcome like this i think and you have or not condemns but corrects uh job's character flaw in 1965 amen brother bran preached i have heard but now i see me and he says an eli who came down and rebuked him eli who comes down and rebukes job for being selfish hallelujah job had a way figured out that he could do it all and brother branham says the way what job was doing was accusing god and so forth see accusation right now listen brother branham continues in the same sermon and then at that time it was an inspiration struck him inspirational and then inspiration struck the prophet talking about job he found the job and he raised up easily and he said something i know my redeemer and in the last days you will stand up on this earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself job is coming into a relationship now not with himself remember not with his own works not with his own sacrifice amen but he's coming into a revelation that god is greater than him amen and who is bringing job into this revelation i mean job don't remember god that god is greater than all the drip you're going to do amen oh my word where is brother brooks this morning amen the scriptures just continue to show job show how job continues to charge god with being unjust lazy but elijah recognizes that there is nothing unjust with god at all i mean we're going to read a few verses just before i end from the 33rd chapter of job verses 14 through 19. amen what has happened in the life of job don't let me do the job elijah is going to show him this has been god's grace to bring you to a closer relationship with god job 33 beginning in verse 14. god speaketh once yea twice yet men perceiveth it now watch the way god speaks in a dream then he opens the ears of men along the lord don't deserve this more and sealeth their instruction that he may withdraw from man his purpose and hide pride from men preserved amen elijah is just telling the reason amen that these things go on verse 18 he keepeth back his soul from the pit [Music] the reason god allows things to happen amen is not for judgment not to his people amen but to make sure they escape the pit messiah amen actually up to verse up to chapter 38 god himself now begins to talk to jokes now he's had those three friends amen which shows elijah the deep grace of god amen and let job know job you're not a sinner because these things have happened to you it's just god's unquestionable way to bring you into a faith relationship with him i can say amen to that i can say amen when i was 20 years old amen having promised god that if he would let me come back to america when i was in the united states army in europe american europe when the mayor of the city where i was stationed was threatening to put me under the jail not in but under the jail i cried out to god and i said god if you'll just let me get back to america [Music] amen on thanksgiving night 1969. instead of saying and i'm going to get you can you say amen so in chicago illinois chicago illinois thanksgiving night 1969. god laid me on a hospital bed just like the prophet said he would come amen and the call went out to my family and my brothers that was in the military if you want to see your baby brother alive and he knew how to bring this vessel to a place on february 1 1970 i cried out god i surrender [Music] amen god begins to have his own conversation with him many sermons are taken from these chapters and it's actually brother branham's introduction amen to the pentecostal message [Music] there's that little black preacher there in indiana way back then you know amen stands up and begins to preach where were you joe hallelujah amen and that little preacher turns around and says you ain't got enough room in this pulpit for me to preach i feel the same way this morning hallelujah and you know what the end of job is listen to this job humbles himself to repentance [Music] and not only does job humble himself to repentance whatever he lost in the beginning amen god never takes unless he gives more no jun [Music] in the end amen now listen as we we're going to close in just a minute of course there's a lot of questions now about joe's children where were they now i know if you read the scriptures amen it says job had other children seven sons excuse me it says job's sons and daughters were restored now watch brother brown didn't just pull that thought out of the out of the clouds [Music] history speaking jewish history amen a book about the jewish faith only called the pseudopigriography don't don't worry about it amen it says that the actual writing is that when job turned and looked into the heavens amen he saw those seven sons and three daughters waiting on him amen now the camel and the lambs and all right they were restored amen but we're just going to stay with the prophet's message and say because job had inspiration now amen he didn't just have hope he had inspiration he turned and looked he said and he saw his sons and daughters that had been taken hallelujah waiting for him in the heavens don't list you now tell me church amen what can be better than your family being saved the most important prayer i'm praying today amen i claim salvation in the name of jesus christ i claim deliverance in the name of jesus christ i dream healing in the name of jesus christ whatever god has to give me i claim it in the world knowing that satan [Music] this morning amen would you stand and give the lord a round of applause to priests amen
