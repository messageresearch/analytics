TRANSCRIPT
========================================
eighth verse but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead for I was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and I died and the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do I not but what I hate that I do that do i if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more than I that do it but saying that dwelleth in me well I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find that for the good that I would I do not because evil which I would not that I do excuse me now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in a law that when I would do good sin as II is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the law the inward man but I see another law and my member warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death for I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we think you for being good to us Lord we pray this morning that you would give us grace move completely out of our let me move completely out of your way and let your perfect divine will be done here this morning and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated thank you sir simple message kill the wheel there will die will be done in earth as it is in heaven my theme is kill the wheel when we talk about a wheel we we talk about that conscious part of us that makes decisions or make a deliberate action it's the power control of the mind that that is over all of your actions when we talk about the will would talk about power of choosing one's own action if that would make it clearer to you you can either have a strong wheel or you can have a weak will it is the act process of using or certain one's choice I really like that because we realized that when we were made God made us free more agencies in other words God gave us will and we understand Amen according to the prophet of God that's one of those things that God will never take from you we realized they meant one of the things that I saw within the scripture is that sometimes God will force you to make a decision he will make you a place you in a place where you will have to decide your will versus God's will when I was thinking about that I thought about Egypt there was a children of Israel there and they had to make a choice at the end of the day even though they were God's people they had to make a choice whether they wanted to remain as the Egyptians as remain in Egypt and be destroyed or whether they would want to go with God when Moses came and told them that you must put the blood on the doorpost and a lentil didn't matter amen on what their past history of DNA was God had brought forth the law through a prophet and that law had to be obeyed or either your firstborn was going to die so God forces us amen to a decision but he still makes it your will you can either refuse God or accept it when we come to circumcision we found out that circumcision among the Jews was very important every male child was supposed to be circumcised on the eighth day now you have a choice you can either circumcise or have your child circumcised on the eighth day or not but understand your decisions will always suffer consequences amen for we understand that that circumcision on the eighth day was a shadow and a type of house circumcision that's why perfect circumcision could not come in the seventh age it had to come on the eighth day we call that they are celebration Oh when we when we come to that decision we understand it's a holy convocation now we realize by God's grace that also when it came to Mount Carmel Elijah had a decision of the people had to make a decision whether they were going to stay with bail worship or whether they were going to follow Elijah God always forces your hand you can truly say I am a believer Lord I love you but God at some point time is going to make you make a decision we find out that even in Moses Moses when he was out in the wilderness and of course he had Dathan and Cora fighting him he's taking the word in which Moses had had preached and you know making their own revelation out of it and at a point in time Moses brought the people to a decision and he said who all is on the Lord's side you come over here we find out that there are many of them who decided to come to the Lord but at that time it was too late and the earth swallowed them up because they made a decision to follow bail and in worship I know God's when we talk about decisions often time we understand your will this is why you've got to be careful on what you choose to do because whatever your choice or your choices are they will suffer consequences even when it comes to marrying there's always your will there present your will to marry someone and it think about all of the do's and dont's you know now they've taken out will you love him during the time when he's rich or poor or better forwards or sickness and help oh yeah yeah yeah you know but understand those times are going to be tested those same words that you making in the season with and swearing to you got to understand that these things will have consequences God will try you and the reason why I brought all of this up is because now we're coming to a time where our will will make manifest right our will will make manifest whatever you choose to do you know brother Branham said it like this that God sealed us he wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of Life because of our decision our choice the choice that we made before the foundation of the world and if you made that decision then you would make it now when we talk about decisions you and I know that every decision that we make will progress us not degress us you understand me when we make decisions for God in our decision is aligned with God's will it will promote us it will make us go forward never backwards because God does not retreat and I'm taking it slowly now this morning because I really want everybody to understand this is so important to me that I can get this thing over to you because God showed me something and it's rabbi revelation and I don't know how to explain what I what I've seen but by God's grace I trusted if we could see the importance of your will it is something that children have we have to we have to guide them when they're young because sometimes being a child they don't know how to the right choice sometimes children look at flames of fire and they think it's all beautiful and they want to touch it but but and their will is to do so and then you say hey don't touch that that's hot right we're trying to teach them how to to make choices and and make them sis ibly and sometimes that child may think well mom don't know what they're talking about our daddy and but I'm gonna try this thing anyhow it right that's the way it works when you when you when you misplace God's will if you take God's will and place it beneath your own will God will allow you to do your thing if I could say it like that and you're going to suffer the consequences hallelujah is that okay understand in the beginning and I'm gonna go back to Lucifer because you got to understand that in the time of Lucifer Lucifer was the first of all angels to develop his old will before Lucifer's thoughts were manifest before God all of the angels in heaven obeyed the will of God we don't know what all they did we don't know what all God commanded them to do but we do know it was Lucifer who first thought within his heart outside of God's will I will ascend I will do this I will do that and remember whenever you choose to do anything outside of God I will be there your selfishness will manifest itself every time you make a decision outside of God's will that was the problem with Lucifer he was selfish he cared nothing about no one else then and he cares nothing about no one else when we talk about Amen Lucifer we understand him and he is the reason that we are in this condition now because what he did in the Garden of Eden he persuaded Eve that her will was more and then Tages for her than God's will and so what did she do she literally was seduced by the devil and understand you understand me every time you choose to do what you want to do you have been seduced that's the way it started out that's the way it will in and we find out Amen that what did the devil do what did he do People of God he took his own will and he brought it into humanity and then in his not creation but in his in his perversion he made man in a way that he would from that porn or battle with his will versus God's will is that right absolutely because here we find out that in the Garden of Eden there was Cain and there was able Abel was a son of Adam Cain was a son of the devil right and in that fallen state is still in Adams will transferred to his son was to do the will of God even in the fallen state but in that state we find out that Lucifer son who was Cain sought to do his own will even when God told him what to do he is your brother bring me a lamb but because in his own will he thought his will was greater you understand me and that's the way the devil deceives us he makes us think that what we're doing is the right thing to do when in reality is the wrong thing to do right now watch this because when Kay disobey God he was sealed with disobedience you understand me in other words his seed will never have the ability to obey mocked by the own kind King moxie that's where authorization in the nomination started that's right right there was the seed of denominationalism when it broke away from the word and decided to do its own thing and expect a God to accept it God didn't accept it then God will accept it now y'all understand me God does not accept your will brother I don't know who who sang was that you brother Frank who sang a song all right I enjoyed it amen and so that's what it is see what we say I got a dog it doesn't mean just dying is dying to your will because it is your will that makes this thing live hallelujah is that right Paul said I know I'm born again I got the Holy Spirit but I still got a will and there are times I will to do right I find myself doing wrong there's times I do wrong and I want to do I want I just decided to write he said I had to come to grips there's two things happening here there's a law of the fresh and there's a law of the Spirit which one I'm going to obey hallelujah that's it but you know in the midst of all of this I thank God for God's grace the Bible said by one man who was Adam by one man sin entered into the world and many of us was lost and by one man's disobedience we became sinners but God being a just God being a righteous God being a holy God wasn't going to judge you because of your condition huh is that right brother balancing that the sinner is that judge because he's a sinner he said it's only the Christian that is judged because he can't sin in other words God I'm gonna look at you said but you were peeing and you're wrong no you were born a pig that's the way brother and illustrated you're born a pig you're not going to be judged for that but when you've been transformed from a pig to a man and then you begin to do piggies things now you're gonna be judged but because your nature has changed is that Alright cheat the mystery of this whole thing and you know Paul says listen you know God has given me the understanding of what this fallen man thing is all about and he says that I had the mystery and I thought to myself I said see when God revealed to me the will I can't explain it but I was sitting there talking to her brother from South Carolina talking about the wheel and I said is that not right I said it's my wheel that has got me in the condition that I'm in now is that right remember even when it comes to the gospel the Bible said whosoever will let him come see it still goes back to your will because that's the way Lucifer started Lucifer fell because of his will his will was to no longer serve God his will was to do his own thing right and we're making sense now and there's a laws against you there's a greater law than all the laws and that is the law of Liberty which is Jesus Christ himself now think about this Lucifer thought within himself this is what I'm going to do and I think to myself how did he deceive 1/3 or 2/3 of the Angels when it was found in his heart you know what he did he preached it he preached to the heaven and guess what God set back and watched it don't you know God could have thought why why should I let this go on but no he had a purpose behind it he knew that a third of however mean it was people it's controversial but anyway it doesn't matter but for years we have demons we have fallen angels who listened to Lucifer and they are now in a state where they can never repent but they made the choice hello they made the choice to follow Lucifer and right now you make the choice every one of us make the choice on whether we're gonna serve God or serve the devil don't let the devil make fool your deceive you what this is what I want to do hallelujah oh no no no no if it hadn't been him there in the beginning you would not have wanted to do evil he brought evil into God's economy help me somebody listen what he says in Isaiah 14 it says for thou has said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides and or not let me tell you all something there are so many people in this message who really think they got the Holy Ghost and they don't have it and there are those who have it but they stopped at a certain place in their lives and they can't go any further because of their will and you got a die right some of us feel that temperance oh we don't know how to beat em print some of us you know we quick to get angry we quick to get shouts we quick and you listen the Holy Ghost is a dove there's got to be a ceiling a complete statue of a perfect man we use or will be on Pentecost yes we are beyond Pentecost because Pentecost were babes they received the Holy Ghost but they were just babes hallelujah now we've got a message that brought by Malakoff all that's supposed to take us to a perfect love oh I got the quotes forward folks I've got the quotes but the problem is is our will I'm not saying you're not saved but we came to this message so that we can make a rapture it's up to you to be dolla Tory it's up to you to be slothful it's up to you you'd make those decisions not to study not to read not to pray you make those decisions God does not make those but every decision we make to be slothful every decision we make not to pray has consequences am I making myself clear we want to stay in the will of God listen I want you to understand your adversary is real hallelujah the Bible says in these last days men will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God hallelujah and exactly we think oh we got to be going to this football game it is bad that's not it those little things that you find pleasure in over God but thou has said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North Sea God brought me here to produce or help produce a bride for the rapture I did not come here to be a church church preacher I didn't come for fame if I had the same I would have start state among the top ten or whatever they call them I'm not interested in that I'm not interested in in being wealthy I don't care about those things my interest wants is to make do whatever I can do with the message that God has brought right because remember brother Brent said we are messengers of the message we are preaching the same message he preached and people of God you and I must understand this is not just a chart for us to look at and admire it is a place we must become and only way we can get there is that like the brothers say we must die to our will you should die let me tell you something you think dying to yourself is easy leather have you ever seen an animal get hit by a car you see how they struggle and fight to live that's just what your flesh does the moment you make up your mind to died at Christ is the moment your flesh is going to cut up hallelujah you gonna see it rage and wanna do love what you used to do it was doing hmm that's when you know you on the right track that's when you know that you just took a knife and you stuck it right in the heart of your flesh don't go don't worry let the devil that kill the flesh kill that we lotta lujah so that Christ may live in you that's what Paul said Paul said does not I that little is Christ that lives in me you got to die thank you for being led by God listen he said I was upon the mount of the thought of the congregation in the sides of the North I will ascend above the heights of ever did not brother branham in Satan Eden said this scripture has been fulfilled everything that this devil said he is now far feeling he is the head of the church I didn't say right I said the church and how did he get there by selfishness he wanted to be listen his whole purpose which was to rule over God's people and I'm gonna tell you something right now y'all think that he's the devil the devil he's smart he's over his throw is over there in Rome hallelujah I'm gonna tell you something that ain't what he's fighting for he's fighting for the throne of your heart that's the throne he wants the same throne God is fighting for to get on he's fighting to get on your heart cuz he knows that if he can get your heart he's got you that's where your thoughts everything proceeded out of your heart and if he can keep your heart wicked you are a worshipper of the devil there's no easy way to say it either your heart is gonna be pure set afire by the Holy Ghost oh it's gonna be unclean by the devil right he was you just like God wanted you as a tabernacle he wants you as a tabernacle never came do nothing without a tabernacle is this okay I know this is a different kind of preaching this morning but I have to bring it this way because I'm trying to get you to see something you are now pushed to a place being forced to make a decision you will not be the same after this morning you're being forced to make a decision which way you going to go hallelujah see selfishness is when you devoted to or caring only for oneself and all all of us are guilty especially when we offense I want or where there get over it that's not the Bible way the Bible said if you offend your brother you go to your brother if you don't obey that you obeying the devil and there's for all of us where they gonna hurt my feelings that'll hurt your feelings you're the ones in prison and let me tell you something I always tell you and I'm gonna tell you again you've got to know who you are and I'm gonna tell you something no son the devil can ever defeat a son of God is that bold enough I've meant for it to be bold because I want us to realize people we out of the word I don't care it's not right for me to say for people of God God has ordained this little fellowship right here I don't believe God sent all of us here just to be a little Church I could have stayed in Lima some of y'all could have stayed wherever y'all were to do whatever y'all wanted to do but when God calls you and pull you together it's for a purpose it's not here I'm not I don't care how can I say it it's not that I don't care but my point is other message churches are gonna do what they're gonna do I'm not concerned with that because I know I've been commissioned to do something here they're gonna do it and at the end of the day we're all joined together but we must do what we've been called to do and God doesn't put you here like a light for you to hide it if we don't do nothing else in this community we ought to witness this message people God will hold us responsible this is okay you say oh no brother books I would never betray God I will always do his right I want you to know Lucifer saw God face-to-face if I could say it like that and betrayed him it's not okay Judis talk write to him face-to-face but Judas was not gonna follow the will of God he couldn't he was a born a serpent and so therefore he had to do what he had to do that's why Jesus said unto Him go do what you got to do think about all of the people that came in face to face with brother Branham saw the great miracles the signs the wonders they saw all of that and walked away they made a decision brother madam said there was over 400 preachers and pastors that were going to come down from our Chicago to get baptized he said they never showed up what happened to them they could not produce no more than what was in them and that's what happens when decisions are made you are you are now expressing what's on the inside come on somebody Ananias and Sapphira said well Lord I've been faithful let me tell you something hundred nine and brother Graham said they're coming another time where Ananias and the fire is coming we're gonna have that over before this this rapture takes place they're coming another time of Ananias and the fire and I'm like what did they do wrong what did Aaron eyes in the fire do wrong they allowed their will by their will and they didn't have to do it there was no pressure on them like the Apostle said why did you come in you lied to the Holy Ghost all you had to do you could have sold all your stuff and kept all your money nobody put any kind of pressure on you but what you did wrong is that you sold this amount and you reported that this amount is what you sold and that's all you had and you lie and guess what that was a death sentence what was it it was their own selfishness that got them into trouble and it was not even required it was not a mandate it wasn't something that God said you got to do it was there it was supposed to be in a free will offering y'all understand me that's how I will get in the way people I will is so simple it's just so if if you got to die Paul says listen I want you to understand I have to die daily this flesh lives every day and I have to kill the wheel of the flesh every day I'm at war with myself like brother Graham said your greatest enemy is you it's not the devil yo your will that you have to fight every day am I gonna stay with the word Oh am I going to just do what I want to do well I just don't even feel like coming to church today and the Bible says come together the more when you see that day approaching one thing I love about Jesus like I said he was the only one that could pull us out of this brother he was the only one that could pull us out of this we needed a man of xscape we needed a way of escape amen from our own wheel-like I was teaching this morning from first Peter where Christ said be ye holy for I am holy how you gonna be holy brother branham said the only way that you could be holy it's by the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as a holy mountain there's no such thing as a holy man there's no such thing as a holy church except the holy God is there and that's the only way you ever be holy you'll never get it by human effort and don't you know it balls down to your own will whether you receive it or not but the man who said God his desire is great far greater than yours to give you the Holy Ghost but he cannot give it to you if your will is not willing to die to everything you got a wheel to die no Lord is that right even when Christ was getting ready to do the great work he did for who you and I he had a will even though the word said he was going to do this this this this and this he still had a choice father I would to discuss for me but not my will but thine be done hallelujah Oh people I'm about ready to shout because I want you to understand amen I know now I know now that my progress in Christ is based upon whether I'm willing to die or not and that's yours if y'all want to see this church get on fire you want to see the power of the pillar of fire come through I don't see it I've seen it God knows I've seen it more than once so much I mean you've seen my way you weren't there and you weren't my eyes but I've seen the pillow fight I've seen the pillow cloud when I was in India dot yeah I saw the pillar cloud before I knew what it was but let me tell you something seeing that still don't make me heaven-bound Israel saw it build a fire pillar cloud millions of them died why they weren't willing to fall to the will of God and how brothers do I know that I'm in the will of God when you stop murmuring and complaining Oh knock knock somebody's at the door you this morning right see that's what I'm saying we could murmur and complain and we forget every decision that God makes for us it's right I was just reading something about 9/11 how certain people survived because certain things happen in their lives one lady missed the bus one lady high-heeled shoes to getting a herd of feet and she stopped and went into the store got some bandages to put on whether we're head rubbed together and because of that one man it was his turn to take his child amen to the nursery if all of these things had not happened every one of those persons would have died don't you understand the frustration they were going through I've got to be on time I got to be all the time this is why was I so stupid wearing these heels off you know and honey why couldn't you just you know I know it's my turn to take the baby but can you take the baby this morning no you see one said and we fail to see that if we just wait and watch god I can't tell you how many times I could remember the time there in Texas I was with brother McGarry David McGarry the pastor there and something happened we were late getting on the highway and as soon as we got to the highway we saw this car pile up had not we've been held or detained we would have been right in the midst of that instead of getting frustrated with God that's why the Bible said in our patience possess ye household things look like they're going bad but at the time God is not protecting you from something hallelujah it's the truth that's why we ought to say Lord not my will but thine be done because when God makes decisions from you for you you're the one that's going to benefit from he wants us to be happy in his decisions that's the problem Israel they weren't happy in God's decision God took them out in the wilderness and they didn't even realize why God took the man but the Bible finally says God brought them into the world of Mister to be tested you are brought to your disasters and your things that goes in your life the things that go hey why I see my God is on in control God is not eating the picture and here is God he's right there testing you trying you and what are you doing are we saying father not my waiver let 9 be done are we murmuring and complaining you're so funny because then after we find out we were wrong in our judgment and God is now blessed as we think Oh God is so good to me he's been trying to teach us that all along huh why am I having such a hard time you know what I'm saying because you had things in you that you didn't know was in there and God is now I'm making a fire bringing and instead of complaining you ought to say thank you Jesus I didn't know I was selfish I didn't know I was this I didn't know I was that oh but God take it from that's what God is looking for people that's going to do that I believe your leadership I know you have you are the leader right and maybe that's what Lucia was thinking the old God don't I've been sitting here all I've been doing all these yarns saying holy holy holy I don't know what he was thinking but one thing for certain when he made that decision to to a sin without God prove approval to a sin he messed up now y'all is that okay so you understand what I'm working with I'm working with kill the will come to the place where Jesus says Lord I know the pain is coming you know I just went through I'm and I'm here in the garden I'm praying Lord I know you know the bomber said he eats prayer was over him and it was so on fire and then that literally his sweat was like drops of blood do y'all think he was just saying a prayer our Father no no no he was really pressing he was really travailing cuz he knew this was the most important act of all the acts on earth this was the most important one this one will not only saved me but it was saved all of my that right remember I said on Wednesday night I said understand to the Jewish people to kill a man is to kill a universe why because of all of the seeds that's in him you just stopped hmm think about it think about one man Adam is the it is and one woman Eve is the reason for all of this numbers of people that have been born on the earth that we can't even number because I've chart don't even go that far people that came from a man and a woman one tree produce all of this think about it Brooklyn said when God created this earth he could eat it suns and moons and stars in world in the world in the world he said who told you you would be staying here this ain't the only place we gonna occupy when Cena's done way with now the corner william branham and you and i we look at this thing and it didn't he said he said now if you favorite a little I will give you I will make you ruler over ten cities ten cities think about it if all the redeemed had ten cities how are they gonna all sit on this earth just just just to give you thought or what the devil is trying to do you must make a decision is it not worth to suffer here now and make heaven like I was telling the book that the children this morning I said if you knew that the world was coming to an end and it was going to blow up with fire and everything else and there's a boat you can get on but you love this world so long so much but you don't know how long it's going to take before it blows up and you'd rather stay here or you rather go that's the choice you're making are you making a choice of death or life Lucifer made the choice of death I have indeed made the choice of death hallelujah what choice are you making it's about your own will whether we love this pleasure more than we love God in Satan will give you the amount of pleasure that you desire to have listen Deuteronomy 4:29 I'm not gonna be too much longer I didn't realize that discipline in this long but if thou but if from Vince now seek thou shall seek the Lord thy God thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if I'll turn to the Lord thy God and shall be obedient unto his voice you turn to the Lord and be obedient to his voice now you said what are you saying brother words let me say it like this in the message what is the Holy Ghost brother Brennan tells the people about the Holy Ghost what it is and then he goes on and he says now tomorrow night we're gonna do this we're gonna tell you how to get it he says come prepared he says sanctify yourself he said get rid of all of the bad stuff you've been doing and thinking in this and then go listen to it he said you gotta clean yourself before you can approach God in order for God to fill you because God is not gonna feel unclean that's him and he says listen people be prepared because we gonna come here and we gotta pray all night if we ought to pray until Easter what whatever the holiday was he said we'll pray but you know what I heard in the prophets voice I heard desperation he's desperate for the people because first of all he starts off he says now this message the messages in which I'm gonna preach tonight is different from all the rest now I want you to understand people this man know that getting the Holy Ghost is a matter of life and death it ain't just believe in the message the devil believes the message that is nothing but a Baptist doctrine hello anything and anyone can dress right I mean come on how many y'all will especially the women let's say like this how many you all would have the faith to be dressed up like a Muslim and all those gods and this is just so funny because they got all of this and they got their eyes looking that's the most evil part right there right it's your eyes that causes your will to change it's what you see Oh y'all ready y'all say that in Scripture where the Bible says that II saw that the fruit was good ooh so you got to understand people of God you said well what do you mean I'm almost done people because I got to break it up anyway when we talk about pleasing the Father Jesus said I do everything I do I please the father whatever he wants me to do I please the father and you think as a man he wasn't tempted he was try think about it I read this little booklet a long time ago it talks about Jesus how he stayed with Mary Martha and Lazarus and them that they were really friends in it and everything else and and and and then when Larry got sick the call came to Jesus Lazarus is sick he hurt do you think if my best friend got sick I would not go see about him or close friend Jesus didn't have a house he stayed with Mary Martha and Lazarus according to history and we find out a man that that these people they know that was feeling okay why won't he come okay send another call to him tell him Amen that you know he's washed now eat this looking not looking good and yet Jesus couldn't why he couldn't do nothing except he saw the father doing it huh a little bit of time when his mama said Oh Mary says get Jesus whatever he say do do it and he filled up the water and the wine and all and he says woman what are you trying to do give me to do things before my time as his mother he'll beta but understand by God's grace it meant God had a season and he had a time to express himself and do you think that here Jesus was standing right there and he couldn't move until he got the word Lazarus is dead he says now I can go is that right is that not what brother Branham did too when it came to that little boy he went in there he had the seen the vision told a man what his wife looked like where they lived and everything else and what the little boy would be wearing and everything and how we'd have the milk around his mouth right and here God sent him there amen and he went before the vision and he pray for the boy instead of the baby getting better he got worse y'all do read our messages right the baby got worse Wow it wasn't that the baby wasn't to be here but the Prophet got ahead of the vision so now he had to wait four hours to the grandma came through the back door and she had to sit here and lean in and I had had to be here and then once everything was in his place he said just said the Lord see that that's what obedience is a waiting for the vision waiting for God to move when God moves in you move right that's the scripture the calls when the Ark people couldn't move into the ark move once the are true the people move so you understand its lead letting God lead us is letting God regardless I'm gonna give you one more illustration before I close on this session I don't know what David seemed or what he saw I know David did something he he killed a bear and they killed a lion and and David knew that he had no power within himself he was a boy he killed a lion and a bear so he contributed that to God and he knew it was God so he had a will and as it will was in in accordance to God's will when he saw Goliath bolstering and carrying on like that he went for it but brenell-- said how many y'all would have would fight a lion and he says I wouldn't unless God told me to do it no man in their right mind is going to charge a lion right so my point is you look at all these things and and you look at how God led David he followed him how did he feed him you know this is what the scripture scripture the Lord won't me up on when I awaken and the Lord spoke to my heart the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and he made me incorporate this into my message because they it wrote that under the inspiration but what David was saying I'm a sheep I'm not smart enough to have my will wherever he lead me I'm going to follow and though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death higher yeah yeah I will feel no you and so we realized Amen that because he trusted in his leader hello trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways and he share what direct your path no you don't direct it he does it and so when we allow God God showed me the essence of that scripture this morning I'm like Lord I've never seen it like this before I've read it it's beautiful poetry I've seen a little something in a little bit and it says now the Oh rod and their staff they comfort me right that means when I feel a little discouraged instead of drawing up my own opinion about things I'm gonna get a word because it's gonna comfort me it's gonna keep me in line it's gonna keep my mind I don't have no other mind in the Shepherd's mine and whatever the scheppers want to do with me Lord let it be aren't we tired of our own decision getting us in trouble I am I don't know what to do I I I'm at a place right now I'm just I'm happy I'm sad I'm sad and I'm happy I've got all kinds emotions running through me right now but I surely appreciate the revelation of the word because I realized by God's grace you think about brother branham how he had to come under the same law had to teach him how to not have his own thoughts right he got spanked how many y'all know that yeah he did I think was Indian Africa one of the ones that ain't of the Lord told him not to go to and he went to the wrong road the one that he wasn't supposed to because of the preachers and that's when he caught that amoeba and he said I almost died because God was angry with me and also remember the time when he told God is that you owe me an explanation he said God separated himself from me a whole month until I finished pouting yeah you don't hear people talk about those things but let me tell you something he was a man and he had to learn his obedience too he said and then once I stopped pouting God told me why he took the girl anyhow he said if I had not powder God would have probably told me in the first place oh I got so much let me tell you something people of God it is best to kill your will everyday when you feel like you don't want to get up praying you pray God get me up to pray when you don't feel like fasting or something if God say fast fast let him know I'm not strong in this but if you can care of me I'll be okay whatever he wants you to do do it it's very very very very rewarding afterwards you love the Lord I'm telling you I know I'm happy today because that brother didn't know what I was going to preach no brother Frank didn't know and God knew and God gave me encouragement through his song same kind of song I surrender and let me tell you some people it is God's will to for us to prosper in the natural and the spiritual but he doesn't want us to love it love this stuff more than we love him he little or less Tana I've kept you awhile forgive me but I'm trying to get something out to you I'm trying to get you to see Amen that we need to check God on everything we do sometimes we go places we do things and we just because we feel like we want to do it and we never think about is it God's will for us to do it father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how I'm trying Lord only if I could show the people what you've shown me open that window for them that they can understand how powerful the will is and how it must die there is no choice Lord if they want to make heaven they must die today well if they want the fullness of your Holy Spirit they must die we need to hear Lord the same thing Jesus heard that you were pleased to dwell in us and father we need a testimony and everything the father's told me to do I have God help us now give us grace give us understanding Lord because we must come to that full statue of Christ help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray I have know some of you I don't know whether some of you believe all that's been said we do have to come to make a rapture I've got a quote right here I guess I read it read it this evening we're in a different time we're being forced to make a decision we're forced a mentor to pay attention to what is written in the word for our character to to grow into what Christ warned us in guarding or listened out by the proverb and said it's don't only be a few it means believers it meant those who make a rapture it's going to be a few people and understand in the mark of the beast brother Branham said if you don't receive the mark of God you receive the mark of the beast you and I are forced to get more God and I don't know about you I love all of you but it's not one person in this place I wouldn't want to be left behind because of that you should feel the same way I love people of God I love my family night I wouldn't want them to be left behind because of me you understand and an in vice versa nobody to blame we can't do like law Adam did Adam the woman you gave me you know the woman the serpent you did but in in all if God really you narrowed it down deception or no deception you made the choice oh Jesus ah sorry oh you here I will love and trust he his prayers he owe to the my bliss a let's say it again I surrender ah all ah so that we can better understand all of the promises of God have been given to the elected of God and the elected of God those who are to make a rapture it's not if they're going to receive the Holy Ghost they receive it and they all come to a divine statue of love not if they do it is the promise of God but even so in the promise of God God works things according to his will for an example Jacob our love and Esau I hate and they both had to go through what they had to go through Jacob had to do what he had to do but he still was God's choice and at the end of the day God staged it - Jacob had to leave his father-in-law's house and go back home whether he wanted to or not he had to because that's where the promise was to be you understand me God forced his issue he got so comfortable over there with his father-in-law God is not so you've got to be over here but lord I gotta face Esau but what about your father-in-law he understand me and God forced the issue and made him go back home and now he realized now I'm in danger now because Esau is there and if I've got to have more than what I got this man he hates me and he's gonna kill me right and so he goes on and he comes to say there's only one solution to my problem prayer there's only one solution to your problem and that's prayer it is there you surrender and why do you think God said he wrestled with the angel because it didn't come easy and I'm gonna tell you something as anyone when in the natural who's had a baby those birth do not come easy you go through a lot of wracking pain before the birth comes you know God so just trying to get you to understand as long as we gonna take relaxing and think God gonna pull us through a hole to get us where we need to be brother I don't say that ain't gonna happen God ain't fooling you to no home or I'm predestinated and now you know yeah but because you predestinate it doesn't mean that you're gonna bypass any god's sufferings to get you there not my will but thine be done let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we've heard your word Lord I know by your grace or Satan fought me with this fought me personally Lord and it want me to bring forth this message Lord in myself I look at me as just being such a failure but I know Lord God with you I am a winner and father you said even when I believe I see myself as being weak I have become
