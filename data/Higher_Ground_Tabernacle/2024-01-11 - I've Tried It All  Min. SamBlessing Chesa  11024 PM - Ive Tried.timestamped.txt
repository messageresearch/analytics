[38:37] issue of blood 12
[38:41] years let's start from verse
[38:49] 24 and Jesus went with him and much
[38:52] people followed him and thronged
[38:55] him
[38:59] and a certain woman which had which had
[39:01] an issue of blood for 12
[39:05] years and had suffered many things of
[39:08] many
[39:11] Physicians and had spent all that she
[39:15] had and was nothing
[39:19] bettered but rather grew
[39:22] worse we'll continue reading as we take
[39:24] our
[39:25] seats
[39:28] I want to speak on this uh title I've
[39:31] tried it
[39:36] all amen I don't believe I'll take too
[39:38] much of your
[39:40] time amen
[39:43] amen and when she heard of
[39:47] Jesus came in the press behind and
[39:50] touched His
[39:53] Garment amen we all know the story of
[39:55] the woman with the issue of blood as we
[39:57] call
[40:01] her she had suffered for so
[40:04] long and the Bible in verse 26 tells us
[40:07] that she had spent all that she
[40:11] had she had sold all her
[40:16] possession amen so that she could get
[40:19] healed I believe she went to find the
[40:22] doctors that her money could
[40:25] afford
[40:28] she tried all of
[40:30] them but none of them could give her a
[40:35] solution none of them could heal
[40:38] her but she hadn't encountered one
[40:43] doctor
[40:45] Jesus amen amen and the Bible say she
[40:48] has spent all that she
[40:50] had not just her
[40:53] money but emotionally she had spent all
[40:59] she was
[41:01] drained and she had tried all that she
[41:05] could but instead of getting
[41:08] better she got
[41:11] worse amen amen but one particular
[41:15] day I believe she heard of
[41:19] Jesus and the good news that was
[41:21] happening in in her in her
[41:24] City and she said let me go and find out
[41:27] for
[41:30] myself amen she said if Jesus could heal
[41:32] all of
[41:35] them Open the Eyes of the
[41:38] blind what about
[41:40] me amen amen and everyone was around
[41:47] Jesus the Bible says everyone was
[41:49] thronging against
[41:52] him and this woman she was
[41:55] frail
[41:58] she was F she was
[42:00] weak amen but she had to press her way
[42:04] through she was pressing her way through
[42:10] men people who were
[42:13] strong at all
[42:16] cost I'm reaching to
[42:19] Jesus when when she heard of
[42:22] Jesus came in the pr behind and touched
[42:25] His Garment
[42:29] for she said I may touch but his
[42:33] cloth shall
[42:35] be another in Luke it
[42:38] says h of His
[42:42] Garment that was
[42:44] Faith she was believing that I I don't
[42:47] need to talk to
[42:49] him I don't need him to lay his hands
[42:54] on I can just read Reach Out And Touch
[42:59] the my 12 year long
[43:02] situation 12 Long
[43:06] disease this will be the end of
[43:09] it amen amen and verse 29 says and
[43:13] straight
[43:15] away the Fountain of her blood was dried
[43:19] up she felt in her body that she was
[43:22] healed of
[43:24] that the moment she reached
[43:28] out that ever flowing blood
[43:32] stopped why because their faith had
[43:34] reached out and touched the
[43:38] master all what the doctors had failed
[43:40] to
[43:42] do the master was able to do
[43:45] it so it is her
[43:48] faith that made her
[43:50] whole hallelujah hallelujah we know
[43:53] every time Jesus healed a
[43:55] person
[43:56] you would say your
[44:00] faith so everything it lies within your
[44:04] faith amen what are you believing
[44:08] on have
[44:10] faith faith is not an
[44:13] imagination faith is not in I think
[44:18] so is I know
[44:20] so amen amen who do you have your faith
[44:25] in whatever you have your faith
[44:31] in some people have faith in
[44:35] medicine there nothing wrong with
[44:38] medicine you know what's healing
[44:41] you not that
[44:43] medicine it's the faith that you have in
[44:48] that have you ever had a situation or a
[44:54] problem and you know that if I just go
[44:56] talk to my
[44:59] friend I know I'll be
[45:02] fine your friend doesn't need to give
[45:04] you an
[45:05] answer but you just
[45:08] talking you feel that heavy burden
[45:13] leave what is that that was your
[45:17] faith amen amen some people place their
[45:20] faith in
[45:22] medicine some put Faith in their friends
[45:27] but I put my faith in
[45:29] Jesus amen because he is the one who has
[45:32] never ever
[45:34] failed he says cast your cares upon
[45:38] me and he will take it away from
[45:41] you and he can set you free it doesn't
[45:45] matter how much you have
[45:47] tried you can say I've tried it
[45:51] all I've tried all the solutions I can
[45:54] think
[45:58] but I got a question for you
[46:00] this have you tried
[46:02] Jesus if you try him you won't come back
[46:08] empty and the prophet of God tells us
[46:10] that faith is a
[46:13] revelation so God has to reveal to
[46:17] you to believe in
[46:20] him and when you have that
[46:23] Revelation God's revelation never
[46:27] fa amen amen so faith is a
[46:32] revelation and faith comes by
[46:35] hearing hearing the word of
[46:38] God the more you listen to the word of
[46:42] God the more faith you
[46:45] have and the more you use your
[46:48] faith the bigger it
[46:52] grows and the Revelation you get cannot
[46:55] be taught
[47:00] only given by
[47:02] God can find that Revelation in biology
[47:08] T you cannot find it from anyone
[47:12] else but you can only find it in the
[47:14] word of
[47:16] God when you place your faith in the
[47:19] word of
[47:21] God God is
[47:23] obligated to make his word come to
[47:27] pass because he not a man that he should
[47:31] lie a son of man that he should
[47:35] repent and he has a reputation of never
[47:39] failing so if you call him at his
[47:45] word this is what your word
[47:48] says I believe
[47:50] it he will come through for
[47:53] you I've tried it before
[47:56] he has done it for
[47:58] me amen amen verse 30
[48:03] says and Jesus
[48:07] immediately knowing in himself that
[48:09] virtue had gone out of
[48:12] him turned him about in the
[48:16] press and said who touched my
[48:21] clothes and his disciple said unto him
[48:24] thou see the thronging thee and say thou
[48:27] who touched
[48:31] me why did he lose
[48:35] virtue because it that woman who was
[48:38] operating the
[48:41] gift the prophet of God tells us
[48:44] that when Jesus was using his gift he
[48:47] would not get
[48:51] weary but when someone else was drawing
[48:53] from
[48:54] it
[48:57] that
[48:59] gift he was growing
[49:02] weary why was
[49:04] that drawing her
[49:07] life was drawing healing from
[49:11] him and he felt The Virtue leave
[49:16] him he is
[49:18] asking who touched
[49:21] me the disciples looked around looked at
[49:24] him crazy
[49:28] of people
[49:30] here pushing against
[49:32] you and you're asking who
[49:35] touched he said no it's a different kind
[49:39] of
[49:41] touch this felt
[49:44] different it was a touch of
[49:47] Faith amen so a touch of
[49:51] faith is different from a regular touch
[49:56] so how are you reaching to
[50:02] Jesus that special tou of
[50:06] faith and your situation will never
[50:10] be amen verse
[50:12] 34 and he said unto her daughter thy
[50:16] faith had
[50:18] made go in peace and be hold of
[50:22] thy amen amen she didn't say I have made
[50:26] you
[50:28] whole the faith that you
[50:31] have that's what has healed
[50:33] you so whatever you
[50:37] want whatever you're praying
[50:40] for the faith that you have within
[50:44] you is what's going to reach out and
[50:46] bring it to
[50:50] you amen amen because faith is that six
[50:54] sense
[50:56] that quietens down
[50:59] everything that goes against the word of
[51:03] God Amen so the faith that you
[51:06] have is what you need for whatever you
[51:09] have
[51:12] desire amen if Jesus did that for the
[51:14] woman we are reading
[51:20] about what about the Jesus who's in you
[51:23] this
[51:24] evening
[51:28] able to do what he said he will
[51:30] [Music]
[51:32] do amen God allowed her to stay in there
[51:36] for 12
[51:39] years she didn't she didn't leave her to
[51:41] stay in for one
[51:44] year if she stayed for one year it was
[51:46] just going to be a minor
[51:51] sickness it was going to be a minor
[51:54] inconvenience
[51:57] but God waited for it to stay long
[52:01] enough prove that he is
[52:04] God what man cannot do God can
[52:09] do what other doctors cannot
[52:15] do why someone wrote a song and say
[52:17] reach out
[52:24] and
[52:26] as he passes
[52:28] by amen he is never too busy for you and
[52:33] me why because the Bible tells us he is
[52:36] the high
[52:39] priest feeling of
[52:43] our amen amen he was touched by the
[52:46] infirmity of the sick
[52:50] woman spent all that she
[52:53] had and she was trying her last
[52:56] option he says I'm going to the
[52:59] master let me Reach Out And Touch
[53:03] him that's what we do all of
[53:05] us amen many times we try everything
[53:10] else and then you want to go to God
[53:15] last why don't you try to flip it
[53:20] around first before you try
[53:23] everything cuz he's the only one with
[53:28] guarantee am sometimes he puts you in a
[53:32] situation he can take you
[53:36] out and prove that he is
[53:38] God cuz sometimes if he lets you to get
[53:40] too
[53:44] comfortable you
[53:46] forget that he is God no longer need
[53:49] have the need of
[53:51] him you have all the money that you need
[53:56] you have all the health that you
[53:59] need and you're going to tell yourself
[54:01] what do I need
[54:04] God that's why Jesus said it's hard for
[54:06] a rich man to get through the eye of a
[54:12] needle because you have the
[54:15] comfort of your riches you have
[54:19] everything at arms
[54:21] length but if you are son of God if you
[54:25] a daughter of God once in a
[54:29] while it Ruffles you up a little
[54:32] bit he removes that Comfort a
[54:35] bit so you have to know and
[54:39] realize things goes
[54:41] left God is trying to tell you
[54:46] something closer to
[54:49] him he is more than
[54:53] willing take you out
[54:56] amen amen don't let anyone stop you from
[54:59] reaching to
[55:03] Jesus this evening you did not let the
[55:05] snow stop
[55:09] you you went through those
[55:12] roads you say I'm getting I'm going to
[55:14] get into his
[55:17] presence it just does not have to be in
[55:19] this
[55:21] building even when you at
[55:24] home
[55:25] just reach out to
[55:27] him don't let anything stop
[55:30] you don't let your cell phone stop
[55:34] you don't let your friends stop
[55:37] you don't let your wife your husband
[55:40] stop
[55:44] you because how does God speak to
[55:46] us he speaks to us through his
[55:50] word that's why Satan gives us so many
[55:54] distraction
[55:55] because he's stopping you from reaching
[55:57] out to
[55:59] him because he knows the moment you
[56:01] listen to that
[56:04] word your faith is activated you feel
[56:09] something and you cannot stand before
[56:12] you so that's why he gives you that
[56:15] distraction you can realize that it's
[56:18] Satan who's trying to stop
[56:21] you go ahead
[56:23] anyways
[56:25] she she crawled in in between their
[56:31] feet said nothing is going to stop
[56:35] me and she went and she grabbed
[56:38] it and the Bible says
[56:43] immedi her problem was
[56:45] solved she was healed she had to get to
[56:49] that Fountain of
[56:52] Life David talks about as the Deep
[56:55] panted for the
[57:00] water it says when the deer has been
[57:02] Hound by those wild
[57:06] dogs and it's
[57:09] bleeding that deer knows it's going to
[57:11] die unless it finds
[57:16] water so it will try at all
[57:19] cost to reach to that River of
[57:23] water
[57:25] as soon as it gets into the
[57:28] water bleeding will
[57:30] stop will know it can leave
[57:33] again amen you and me we can recognize
[57:37] this
[57:38] evening whatever you are going
[57:41] through whatever you are struggling
[57:44] [Music]
[57:46] with run to the Fountain of
[57:50] Life Run To That River of
[57:53] Life and he will stop your
[57:57] issues he will stop your
[57:59] problem amen amen what men call
[58:04] impossible God calls
[58:06] possible that's why the theme of The
[58:08] Prophet Ministry was only believe all
[58:11] things are
[58:15] possible not
[58:21] some up to
[58:23] you all
[58:27] means but as far as the dictionary tells
[58:31] me all means
[58:33] everything so if you just
[58:36] believe all things are
[58:39] possible amen amen believing creates an
[58:44] atmosphere atere where Faith Can
[58:47] Works amen amen so if you believe you
[58:51] are creating that
[58:53] atmosphere
[58:55] where God can make everything possible
[58:57] in your
[58:59] life it's just like an
[59:04] egg if you just put it out there nothing
[59:09] happens but if you put it in a special
[59:12] specific kind of
[59:17] heat something will start happening
[59:19] within
[59:20] it and it's able to
[59:23] hatch
[59:25] because it's in the right
[59:28] temperature it's in the right kind of
[59:32] atmosphere so if you believe and you
[59:34] come in the presence of
[59:37] God that's the atmosphere where all
[59:39] things are
[59:42] possible the
[59:44] atmosphere all his promises can come to
[59:48] pass amen amen you can say I don't have
[59:51] faith but you do have faith
[59:55] when you came to
[59:57] sit how many people before you said you
[59:59] chat to see if your chair wasn't going
[1:00:02] to
[1:00:08] fall you did not you had faith in
[1:00:12] your that is Faith you believe those
[1:00:15] four legs were not going to
[1:00:20] back so if you can believe in a chair
[1:00:23] why can't you believe in God
[1:00:28] in Blasphemous names the prophet of God
[1:00:32] says it says patience and so
[1:00:37] forth 142 there's a mockery of
[1:00:40] it a pretending to
[1:00:44] be he says that's a nature given
[1:00:50] Faith nature given
[1:00:53] virt
[1:00:56] Temperance all these things are nature
[1:01:01] given so the faith that you used to see
[1:01:04] at your chair where you
[1:01:07] seated that's nature given
[1:01:10] faith it say and the biggest part of our
[1:01:12] faith is mental
[1:01:16] Faith by hearing the word it brings us
[1:01:19] to a mental recognition of
[1:01:23] God
[1:01:27] but if this coming from above
[1:01:33] 144 he says if it ever strikes
[1:01:37] this there is a Godly spiritual
[1:01:42] Faith so when the word of
[1:01:45] God is applied to your nature given
[1:01:50] faith that becomes a Godly spiritual
[1:01:53] faith
[1:01:55] then what does that Faith
[1:01:57] do that Faith recognizes only the
[1:02:02] word no matter what anything else
[1:02:07] says recognizes the
[1:02:10] word amen amen in the beginning was the
[1:02:13] word and the Word was with
[1:02:17] God and the word cannot be
[1:02:22] shaken app apply the word of
[1:02:26] God to your mental
[1:02:28] faith that nature given
[1:02:31] Faith that's Godly spiritual
[1:02:36] Faith so you do not need
[1:02:39] much only
[1:02:41] believe all things are possible amen
[1:02:45] amen and faith will make you do crazy
[1:02:50] things I believe when people were
[1:02:51] looking at this woman they were
[1:02:52] wondering what are you doing
[1:02:57] why are you crawling in this
[1:03:00] crowd only she knew what she was
[1:03:04] doing the Revelation was given to
[1:03:10] her so when God tells you to do
[1:03:13] something doesn't matter what anyone
[1:03:15] else
[1:03:16] say or how you would look to people
[1:03:19] around
[1:03:23] you as he
[1:03:26] say cuz when he gives you that
[1:03:29] Revelation it has an expected
[1:03:34] end amen amen it makes you do things
[1:03:38] that people consider AB
[1:03:43] normal and when you take your faith and
[1:03:45] you put your faith in God's
[1:03:48] word God is going to come through for
[1:03:52] you in God's covenant with Abra in the
[1:03:55] prophet of God
[1:04:00] says he says and he said it's it's also
[1:04:04] written and he took the father's word
[1:04:07] and defeated Satan right on his
[1:04:11] ground he took the father's word and
[1:04:18] defe what did he do he was proving to
[1:04:22] the weakest of Christians
[1:04:26] that you can defeat Satan
[1:04:30] anywhere any time on the plain word of
[1:04:35] God just take it and say th says the
[1:04:41] Lord it is
[1:04:42] written amen amen Jesus despite him
[1:04:47] being the
[1:04:49] word despite all the power that he
[1:04:53] had you overcame Satan by saying it is
[1:04:57] written have you ever noticed sometimes
[1:04:59] when you're going through a mind
[1:05:05] battle God drops a scripture into your
[1:05:09] heart do you think that is that is your
[1:05:13] Victory say it back to the
[1:05:16] devil say it is
[1:05:19] written amen shall not live by bread
[1:05:23] alone it is written by his stries I am
[1:05:28] healed amen it is written that I am not
[1:05:32] the
[1:05:33] tail but I am the
[1:05:35] head it is written that I'm more than a
[1:05:39] conqueror say it back to the
[1:05:42] devil and the word
[1:05:45] says the word of God that word that you
[1:05:48] are repeating
[1:05:50] out can defeat Satan anywhere
[1:05:55] at any
[1:05:57] time any
[1:05:59] place does not matter where you
[1:06:01] are speak that word that says the
[1:06:06] Lord and things are going to
[1:06:09] change because when God's word goes
[1:06:12] out the Bible says it does not go back
[1:06:15] to
[1:06:18] him until after it has accomplished that
[1:06:21] which he has set it
[1:06:23] out
[1:06:26] you take God at his
[1:06:29] word he has no option but to come
[1:06:34] through amen amen in hear his voice the
[1:06:37] prophet of God
[1:06:40] says
[1:06:42] 154 nothing is going to bother
[1:06:47] you don't be scared to take God at his
[1:06:50] word says just relax
[1:06:54] have faith and
[1:06:57] believe he's watching over
[1:07:00] you or I like this part you'll
[1:07:04] disintegrate anything that tries to
[1:07:06] bother
[1:07:08] you or it might attack
[1:07:11] you but it cannot harm
[1:07:15] you hallelujah hallelujah he'll
[1:07:18] disintegrate
[1:07:20] anything disintegrate that tries to
[1:07:23] bother you
[1:07:25] have you ever gone to a car
[1:07:29] junkyard you see all the different parts
[1:07:31] of cars in different
[1:07:36] places they so mixed up you cannot tell
[1:07:38] which
[1:07:43] one
[1:07:46] disintegrating so the word says you'll
[1:07:49] disintegrate
[1:07:52] anything
[1:07:55] exactly that's what he will
[1:07:56] do Isaiah he said no weapon formed
[1:08:00] against
[1:08:02] me shall prosper it might try to
[1:08:06] work but it's not going to
[1:08:10] succeed why because he will disintegrate
[1:08:14] it amen amen it will not harm
[1:08:18] you it might attack you but it's not
[1:08:22] going to prosper
[1:08:24] he says for all things he permits
[1:08:27] it amen amen it says all things work
[1:08:31] together for them that love the
[1:08:37] Lord can come to you unless God allows
[1:08:44] it you remember
[1:08:46] job Satan had to go ask for
[1:08:50] permission say can I go touch J
[1:08:56] and God
[1:08:58] said go but don't touch his
[1:09:01] life he the first time Satan came to
[1:09:05] God he says do you think God is that job
[1:09:09] is going to
[1:09:12] stop because you have a hedge around
[1:09:18] him this was not God saying
[1:09:21] that this was Satan saying
[1:09:25] how did Satan know that there was a
[1:09:30] around because initially he tried to go
[1:09:33] without
[1:09:35] permission and he could not get
[1:09:38] through and when he
[1:09:41] failed when he turned around and went
[1:09:44] back and says there's a hedge
[1:09:48] around I cannot touch
[1:09:50] him then God permitted him
[1:09:54] so nothing can touch
[1:09:56] you unless God permits
[1:09:59] it no trial can come to
[1:10:03] you unless God permits
[1:10:06] it no sickness no
[1:10:10] disease unless God
[1:10:12] permits and by the time he permits
[1:10:15] it he already know that you're going to
[1:10:19] overcome he knew that job was not going
[1:10:21] to curse
[1:10:22] him
[1:10:24] that's why he allowed
[1:10:26] Satan he says go ahead do whatever you
[1:10:29] want and job stood
[1:10:32] firm if God knew that job was going to
[1:10:35] curse
[1:10:41] him you are going
[1:10:43] nowhere but because he knew Job was
[1:10:46] going
[1:10:49] to Fai in
[1:10:52] my
[1:10:54] so whatever you come
[1:10:57] across sneak away past
[1:11:02] God God has allowed it to come to
[1:11:05] you you already know you're going to
[1:11:07] overcome

[1:14:26] ark with the last kind of wood you would
[1:14:29] expect to build an
[1:14:33] ark that was the most ridiculous idea
[1:14:36] people had
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:40] heard building an with a of
[1:14:46] w according to people just going to get
[1:14:49] in the water suck in the water and
[1:14:52] Dr
[1:14:55] but God is a master
[1:14:58] strategist did not try to reason out
[1:15:01] with
[1:15:03] God
[1:15:06] word I'm doing
[1:15:08] that started laughing at
[1:15:11] him science cannot even prove what you
[1:15:14] were
[1:15:16] doing but he knew the voice that he had
[1:15:20] heard that's why you were not supposed
[1:15:22] to listen to people
[1:15:26] God tells you to do
[1:15:28] something you do it it doesn't matter
[1:15:32] what your thoughts even
[1:15:34] say what anyone else
[1:15:37] say because he knows how he's going to
[1:15:39] take care
[1:15:41] of so he only needs
[1:15:44] you take God in his
[1:15:46] word do what he says you
[1:15:49] do and then you will have successful
[1:15:52] results
[1:15:56] the same people you are
[1:15:59] criticizing when you
[1:16:02] prosper they're going to come
[1:16:04] around and they'll start cheering
[1:16:08] you how many have ever how many have
[1:16:12] ever when you are starting
[1:16:14] out everyone is mocking
[1:16:17] you that doesn't make
[1:16:21] sense that's ridiculous
[1:16:24] but after some time when you
[1:16:28] prosper they turn
[1:16:31] around we knew this boy had
[1:16:35] it knew you could make
[1:16:38] it and they'll start cheering
[1:16:41] your that's why you're not supposed to
[1:16:43] listen to
[1:16:45] people listen to What God
[1:16:48] Says after Noah buil the
[1:16:51] Ark people were laughing at
[1:16:54] are the ones who ended up coming on the
[1:16:56] door
[1:16:58] knocking and they wanted to get in that
[1:17:01] AR that they were saying
[1:17:04] will but Noah stood
[1:17:07] firm stood on what the word of God was
[1:17:12] saying so God only needs
[1:17:15] you you and you
[1:17:17] alone whatever he tells
[1:17:20] you go ahead and do that
[1:17:24] in
[1:17:26] perseverance it says I don't know what
[1:17:28] he can do by a
[1:17:31] denomination he says I know what he can
[1:17:34] do with one man that will surrender
[1:17:35] himself completely
[1:17:40] to all he needs one
[1:17:43] person that's
[1:17:46] you then he is
[1:17:50] perseverant nothing is going to stop him
[1:17:54] amen amen God only needs
[1:17:57] you and when he tells you what to
[1:18:00] do go ahead and do it in the Bible many
[1:18:04] people did ridiculous
