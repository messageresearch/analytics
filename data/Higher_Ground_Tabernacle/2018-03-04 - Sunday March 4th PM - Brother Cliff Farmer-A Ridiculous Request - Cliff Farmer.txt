know the original praise the Lord I sing that one the original life amen his life amen amen and his bride let's just start with the original see God's attributes were manifested through its pride in this man [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you brother man you loving this evening well I'll probably be short-winded tonight I don't have enough voice to be long-winded so but I'm thankful to be able to give my voice for him yeah good to see you brothers from Iowa City just want to say one more time we sure appreciate getting the opportunity to come and speak to you and appreciate for the Isaiah having confidence in us tough enough to ask us to come you know I told someone I said it it's good when a brother has enough confidence to ask you to come but then when he can come and and when you can come and he can leave town and trust you you know that's I kind of like that so tonight if we could let's just turn to Luke chapter 8 and it's got a very simple thought on my heart this evening something Lord is laid on me let's tell him brother Jon today as we we left the church here I said I have no idea what I'm preaching tonight not a clue and got in the car we went back to those days and packed up we got in the car and I said I still don't know what I'm preaching tonight so kind of opened up my notes and I so well I guess there's the answer so it's what the Lord is kind of laid on me Luke chapter 8 verse 40 and it came to pass when Jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him and behold there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house for he had only one daughter about twelve years of age and she lay dying but as he went the people thronged him and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stopped you can be seated I want you to kind of hold yet that place in the scripture we're gonna continue on but I just I want to kind of dramatize this story but you see what's what's happening here Jairus daughter falls sick you know as any loving parent would be they they took her you know they prayed for they took her to the doctor and there comes a point where the doctor can do nothing else and and you know I've been there my daughter she had a infection that was in her eye and and we were at the hospital Children's Hospital out in North Carolina and the infection was actually going behind her eye and they they told us they said we've we've been putting the IV in and it's not working and they said you know they said if this infection gets behind her eye it could go to a brain and kill her and you know as a parent when you get to this point you you're falling apart you know because I realize there was nothing that I could do there was nothing that the doctor could do and the only way out was if Jesus come on the scene and so here's Jarius knowing that doctors done all he can do daddy's done all he can do Namah has done all she can do and so he has one excuse me one way of escape and that's to get to Jesus if I can tonight I want to title this a ridiculous request a ridiculous request so Jairus runs and he finds the group of people around Jesus and as you could imagine faith was building in Jerry's heart if I get to Jesus everything will be okay if I can just get to where he's at if I can just tell him what's going on everything will be all right and as he gets to Jesus he sees that there's a little woman that comes behind him verse 44 said and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stopped and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter they when all denied Peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throwing thee and pressed thee and thou sayeth who touched me and I'll just show you if you take those words back in the Greek Jesus asked who touched me and Peter says every one is touching you but it's two different words to describe the word touch when Jesus said who touched me if you go back in the Greek the meaning of the word is who latched on to me and Peter says Lord every one is touching you but if you take that word in the Greek it says every one is brushing up against you and Jesus is saying no I know every one is rubbing up against me but someone latched on to me oh let me tell you tonight I don't want you to rub up against the Holy Spirit I don't want you to just feel his presence tonight but if you can latch on to Jehovah Jireh if you have a sickness tonight latch on to it if you have much repair Tony tonight latch on to him he said someone somebody has touched me for I perceive that virtue is going out of me she latched on to him so hard that it turned him in his tracks she latched on to him and when everyone else was grabbing ahold of him and latching on to him but they were not latching on in a spiritual way they had touched His garment but nothing had happened but a little woman with faith said oh if I can but touch the hem of His garment I want to share this for you this is the third pole in operation because there was no scripture promising then if she touched the hem of His garment she'd be made well there was no prophet that had ever said if you touch the hem of His garment you'll be made well but my faith and by the spoken she made her own promise and in her faith brought it to pass tonight make your own promise you say brother I don't know it seems ridiculous it's time to ask God for ridiculous things and when the woman saw she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto Him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately watch this here's Jarius trying to get to him and before he can even get to him a testimony service starts of what's already going on can you imagine the faith in the man I know my daughter's gonna be well now I know everything's gonna be back and he said daughter be of good comfort that feat that's made the whole go in peace Jairus is next in line he's ready to ask the scripture says while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him my daughter is dead trouble not the master what a turn of events what a change here ease his faith is built he's ready he's already one touch the miraculous happened and he knows his daughter's not dead yet and then someone comes and says look I know you've come this far I know you had faith and I know that you believed you was going to get to him in time but your daughter's dead quit bothering Jesus because you see it'd be ridiculous brother Mike to ask Jesus to come pray over something that's too far gone but there's nothing too far gone with Jesus when he walked down to the tomb of Lazarus he had been dead beyond the point of coming back remember because he'd been dead for days the earth the skin worms was already devouring him but the same God that called for 16 elements out of the earth to form the body of Alan of Adam's cheese Lee could call the 16 elements out of an earthworm back to create Miller Bantam said his knows that I already fell in but the power of the spoken word spoke over a ridiculous request and calls a man being eaten to stand back up and live well he hid speak he said my daughter's dead troubling off the master I think many times we hear the same words by the devil we've prayed and we've prayed and we don't see a way out and then we hear it quit bothering him quit asking him he's not going to do it quit praying quit having faith for your family it's not gonna work quit believing your wife will live this one day quit believing your children all serve God one day and he just whispers this stuff in your ear he tells you these things why he's saying don't trouble the master it's too far gone and I like the next verse it said but when Jesus heard it and we could in the service right there but when Jesus heard it everyone else has had their say so the doctor has said what he thinks about it the psychiatrist has said what he thinks about it the mayor said what he thought about it the runner came and said what he thought about it but when Jesus heard it oh let me tell you don't think for a minute when all the other negative testimonies are coming forth when all of them the negativity is being preached when when everything is is looking bad and everything wrong has been said Jesus has heard it but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only but good lord I was believing but now she's dead if you're not believe only but lord there's no way now he was talking to the waymaker about how there wasn't away he was talking to the one that part of de Red Sea about how there was no way to get across the sea fear not believe only and she shall be made whole and when he come to the house he suffered no man go in and save Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept now watch this he's already went out of his way to come back to the house now now the the healer the raiser of the Dead the the leper cleanser is in the house and everybody's still crying and he suffer no man to go in at Steve and all wept and to weld her but he said weep not she's only dead she she's not dead but sleepeth I want you to watch this next one and they laughed him to scorn now here's what we find out is that they're laughing didn't change anything but you understand it gets to a point to where everything looks so hopeless that when you speak faith you get laughed at when you speak that I believe God will still raise up the dead you're laughed at when you speak I believe I'm part of the rapture you're laughed at when you speak when the doctor said we give you up there's no more hope you get laughed at they all laughed but what's this they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead the reason they laughed him to scorn is because of how smart they were they knew look look Jesus we're not guessing about this we know we put it into terms sir this is the heart monitor it's flat you know I know whether she's alive or not okay you're smart you think you know we had a brother in our church just I don't know three months ago something like that he was sitting back near the back my dad was preaching and the brother just collapsed and we had a brother that was an EMT ran up to him and took his pulse he said he's dead few brothers went back and gathered around him and they laid his hand on him a cold for breath to come back in his body and a man looked up and he said what's going on he still the racer of the dead he still the owner of that line denies a brother was telling me he was overseas and he said he had preached that God was still the opener blinded eyes and he said a little woman come up for prayer and said you said it I believe it she said now you pray for me and he said I looked and I went oh boy he said I preached it but I didn't really know if I believe that or not but her faith remember jesus said your faith but her face she said you preached and I believed and he said I laid my hand on her and as I begin to pray she began to scream and her eyes come open he is still the same God today they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead but what's what he done and he put them all out you got to put people out sometimes when people are just negative you just got to put them out when people keep texting you negative thoughts you got to shut them off when people call you you got to hang up on them when people are constantly feeding you a negative report sometimes you got to just put them out they said he pulled him out and took her by the hand and called saying made a rise and her spirit came again and she a row straight way and he commanded to give her meat watch this not only did he raise her from the dead but now she is so made well don't give her milk but give her meat again when God does a job he doesn't the best when God gets finished with you you'll be ready to eat meat again and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done ridiculous a ridiculous request ridiculous to ask the master to pray for a dead one but the ridiculous was fulfilled brother branham said in 1954 he said God couldn't make sea serpents crawl out of the lake out there so big that would mash Chicago down if he seen fit to do so he said that sounds like it's mythical but he could do it he could create he said he can speak life into existence or he can speak out of existence he's God and we underestimate his being and his ability we underestimate God don't underestimate we underestimate I told the church here a while back and I don't mean it to be funny but Taco Bell you know they used to have the little saint you know then it's gonna put Godzilla in a box you remember and the Taco Bell commercial said I think you need a bigger box and I'm going to tell you if you're going to try and lock God in a box of humanity and our way of thinking you better get a bigger box because he is beyond our ways I I was telling Billy rich today at lunch the scripture said his ways are not always and his ways are past finding out you know sometimes we wonder why does things happen in our family let me tell you something there was a young boy at our church and he was serving God he was doing great he was singing I mean he was getting up and testifying and something turned and he ran right out and went to live for the devil and we thought wow what what what happened well he got hooked up with this girl that was just worthless you could tell by looking at her she wasn't worth shooting well about three months after he'd been dating her he brought her to church and you know she said I don't want nothing to do with those kind of people about two months later they just visited again and she was a little eased up about the church well about a month later they were sitting there and the power of God began to fall and I begin to call an altar call and I watched that little woman and that little boy get up and almost literally brother Isiah run to an altar and now that little girl is about one of the best preachers we got in town there was a sister saying the other day that's been raised in this message she said I know I don't live everything in the message but that don't make me a heathen she said hey don't live in a teepee and say you ain't in India now she's witnessing to her family she went back and told her mother she said you're going to live this message or my children won't stay in your home we don't understand what God's doing sometimes but there was a little seed out there and somebody had to go get her I don't understand that I can't explain it listen I can't explain time or either the way we look at things that shouldn't have happen God misjudged that one in our eyes but somehow it's written in the Holy Scripture because God's ways are past finding out we underestimate him it's what the Prophet said he should we underestimate him I told you I'm titling this a ridiculous request the word ridiculous means deserving ridicule silly or unreasonable see sometimes we have prayer requests that are unreasonable sometimes we're asking God to do things that there's no human reasoning that would tell you this can be done is that true they got to thinking you know there was a man one time he was sitting down by the walls of Jericho a little Bartimaeus you know he had done everything he knew to do and he had done like a lot of us do see he had a lamb and he his wife got sick and he said well Lord if you're Hiller I'll give you this see a lot of times we try to bargain with God Oh Lord I'll do this if you'll do that so the Lord heals us wife he gives up the lamb and he still got two turtledoves his daughter gets sick and he goes you know the story he goes and he says Lord if you heal my daughter I'll give you these turtle doves but then there come a point where there's no more seeing I'll ahem there's no more doves to make money and now Bartimaeus needs healing but there's one problem bartimaeus has no bartering tools he has nothing to offer God but he was tending there one day and he heard a noise and he remembered the scripture of his father Abraham when he was about to sacrifice Isaac he heard a noise and everyone else was hearing a fan crown but bartimaeus was hearing he is RAM in a thicket and boredom s beginning to scream Jesus I would say if you want something from him tonight don't be ashamed of scream Jesus those next doing those badness anointed people and met that a spirit and all that people said bartemaeus be quiet we don't do this in church they said please be quiet and he said Jesus listen don't worry about what the person next to you thinks about it don't worry about what the people that might walk by the building will think when they see you stagger out drunk in the spirit just scream Jesus it's ridiculous to think that Jesus was gonna walk over there and hear his voice above all the others but the scripture said that Jesus walked to him and he said bartemaeus arise now this is what the scripture tells us the scripture says that Bartimaeus throwing his coat to the side follow Jesus in the way well if you look back in that day and time to be a beggar you had to be a government-approved beggar and they gave you a special coat that says I got a problem oh you can go to a doctor and he'll tell you you you you need disability you can go to a doctor and tell you you got a mind problem but if you want to hold on to that you'll never get your healing so for Bartimaeus to wear the coat he had to hold on to the idea that I will be blind I will never get better but when sight come to his eyes he said Jesus I will cast my garment to the side because Bartimaeus was saying I will never be back here again I want to tell you something I used to wear a coat of lust but one night at an altar I got up and I casted my going to the side and I still look at that altar and say I'll never never never never be there again I'll never go back to where I was God have mercy I want to bring you out of the Bible now I got a precious friend down in Joplin Missouri we had a hernia operation he went to the doctor and I had the operation and something went wrong and they kept him in the hospital and kept working on him and kept working on him ended up they ran up a $95,000 hospital bill they still couldn't fix him so they sent him to Springfield Missouri and they finally got him taken care of but they run up a hundred and ten thousand dollar bill I'll never forget me and brother John here another brother in the church we were passing through and we we met with him and he said brothers honey prayer said I thought I had insurance and I had none he said now I got $200,000 in hospital bills that I've got to pay and I said brother Eric we're gonna pray he's a pastor of a church I said we're gonna pray and the Lord is going to take them hospital bills away well he called me about a month later and he said brother quit if you're not gonna believe this he said the joplin hospital sent me a letter and said because we messed up on the surgery we are riding off every bill you owe nothing so this this was his testimony he said brother cliff now all I've got to pay he is a hundred and ten thousand I said nonsense I said if he could get rid of ninety five he'll get rid of a hundred and ten a month later he called me on the phone he said brother you're not gonna believe this I said yes I am he said that hospital sent me a letter and said we have decided to deduct or bill to $900 I'm telling you the god of history has been raised up once again he's not a God that used to work miracles he's not a God that used to heal the sick but he's an alive present God today you all may have heard the story brother James Miller he was down in Nicaragua and a truck flipped over paralyzed him you know the story so brother Tim Hayden from Mountain North Carolina told me he supposed if he said the Lord told me to drive to Arkansas to pray over that man's feet that he could walk again and so as he was getting into the town there where they're at he said the Lord laid it on his heart to buy him a pair of shoes and he said well all right so he he said I walked into a store he said I didn't know what size he wore I didn't know what color he liked he said but I I walked past the aisle there and he said a certain pair of shoes stood out to me and he said I want that pair of shoes - brother James's house and he told sister Miller he said I've come to pray for him and he said I bought him a pair of shoes and he said when she opened up the box she began to cry she said brother this was the exact shoes he was wearing in the wreck and we lost them down there let me tell you somebody god I spoke to brother James after that and he was still sitting in the wheelchair and he said let me tell you something and he slapped his legs he said these legs are liars I am healed he said he said these feet they lie to me he said I'm already healed he said I don't know how long it'll take but I will rise from this chair I said brother with that kind of faith God would have to raise you you [Music] remember the story brother Billy Paul said he was standing there in the line he said that little that woman brought a little girl up in prayer and said she didn't have eyes not that she was blind he said didn't even have eyes in her sockets and he said that brother Branham this story stands out to me so much said brother Branham said we're going to pray for you and he said brother Branham begin to pray for eyes and he stopped praying and he said honey he wants to know not brother Branham wanted to know so you think sometimes little bitty matters don't matter to God but he said honey he wants to know what color you want she said I heard blue is nice brother Billy said I'll never forget he said daddy said bow your head but I couldn't he said I watched a blue light come down out of heaven and enter into her face and he said the most beautiful set of blue eyes you've ever seen was falling in her head I told this story in North Carolina brothers tear communes come up to him and he said brother cliff I want to share something with you he said I've met her and he said she still got the most beautiful blue eyes you've ever seen let me tell you he can still do it tonight brother branham this is a lengthy quote but you'll understand now where I got my title will abandon said I heard it say again you are hunting and you need game how many do you need and I thought now I don't want to overdo this that's the problem we shortchanged God well I know what he's saying speak the word but I don't want to over speak you can't he said I'm just going to ask for three three squirrels I want young three red squirrels I want them he said then speak about it what do you want tonight speak about it what do you need tonight speak about it you say brother I just been depressed speak about it my family I need my family to serve God speak about it quit asking and start speaking he said then speak about it and I said I'm going to get what's the way he turns it not I want he said I'm going to get three young red squirrels and he said which way will they come you're the one talking now you tell him how you want it you want healing tell him how you're going to get it brother we got at some point we got to start using I mean let me step away from this for a second when I first became an assistant manager I'll never forget I walked into my boss's office and I said hey I it was like the first week I was in management and I said this says needs a manager signature I hand it to him he goes you sign it I don't need to and I said but it it's you know I mean I was wearing the name tag that said manager I told everybody I put it on Facebook that now I was a manager and he said you sign it I said but it says it needs a manager signature he goes yeah well you are one see I think that's what we do a lot of times we go well I'm a believer and and then it says someone needs to sign the check so my family can be we go well we walk around the search going I wish somebody could sign this you said you as a believer you said you were the Bride of Christ you said you were the Queen of Heaven you sign for it he said which way will they come I thought well I've went this far there's something talking to me here just the same as you hear me talking and God in heaven and this Bible over my heart knows that's true and I said well I picked out a ridiculous place this is where I got my message an old dry lamb hanging out there about 50 yards where my rifle was shot in I said the first one will be right there and there he was it's that simple he said I rubbed my eyes I turned back my head and I thought I don't want to shoot a vision so I looked around again and there set the squirrel I thought of shelling my gun aim and I could see his black eye I thought maybe I'm sleeping and I'll wake up in a few minutes I'm dreaming about this eye level down shot the squirrel that dropped off the limb and I thought well should I go over and look for it he said and there at late I picked it up and blood run out of it a vision don't bleed you know so I picked it up and it was a squirrel I got real nun all over I bet he did oh let me tell you it would do us good to get real numb all over I know that we're beyond Pentecost but let me tell you something it would do you good to stagger out of the church once a lot listen I'm talking about praying for people brother you know what I'm talking about you pray for people until you walk out of the church and you're walking sideways and you finally just lean up against the building because you can't do nothing they nothing like it you know the problem most people they never got to that spot there was a brother in our church he was telling our pastor he said I don't I don't believe in all this speaking in tongues he said I just don't think there's any need for it and I think you guys are going too far but they've said that's all right so a few months later brother Dave was preaching a meeting and he took this brother with him as his driver and he said I prayed and said Lord I'm asking you to let that man speak in tongues all over that place he said the Spirit of the Lord chopped down that man began to speak in another tongue and rattled and rattled and rattled he said when we got back in the car he said I'll agree one said I don't know about all these people speaking in tongues let me tell you if you ever get in there you'll know about it all right [Music] he said I looked around and said God that was you he said thank you for this now I'll go and he said but you said now watch what he says here but you said do you doubt what you said not you doubt what I said to get out what you said remember what I said earlier you've got to make your own promise if I can touch the hem of His garment I'll be you make your own promise tonight let me tell you something if you decide tonight that if you come up and touch this red carpet you'll be made whole you'll have to do it but it ain't a promise in the Bible no it's your promise you write the book he said well he said you said you'd get three now where will the next one come from I thought well if I'm dreaming I'm gonna continue on so I picked out an old post over there a tree that was wrapped up with poison ivy you never get a squirrel in that it's ridiculous and I said the next one will come out of that poison ivy and there said a young red squirrel looking at me I set my gun down and rubbed my eyes and turned around again and I thought berry scent turned his head sideways I shot the squirrel and then I started to go home but said you said you said three I was preaching a youth meeting in Florida here a few years back and this young man come up for prayer seeking the Holy Ghost brother Brooks and we prayed over him and I'm gonna tell you he didn't get it I knew that and he said brother I don't know what to do I said I'll tell you what to do I said when you get out of church tonight I want you to call home so I want you to tell your parents that you got the Holy Ghost at the youth meeting in Florida yes look at me I said yeah he said why I said because brother Branham said your body has to line up to your testimony I said this meeting ain't over it was a Friday night I said it ain't over I said so what we're gonna do is we're gonna I said everybody you talk to now tell them you got the Holy Ghost you tell your mom and daddy you got you call whoever you can and tell them you got it and I said if you'll believe it then before you leave here God will have to make your body match your testimony and I'm here to tell you before that boy left Florida he had received the Holy Ghost we gotta start speaking it do you doubt what you said I said no Lord I don't doubt what I said watch now I don't out what I said for your confirming there was this one scripture that stumped me not if I say but if you say not if Jesus said it but if you say it yourself and I thought somehow I've broke into that channel and I know he's here because I'm almost beside myself now here I love it he said I thought I will make this one ridiculous sure enough the prophet of God said if he's going to let me speak like this I'm gonna make it crazy I'm gonna make it remember ridiculous I'm gonna make it deserving of ridicule I'm gonna make it unreasonable I'm gonna make it silly she sometimes there's things that we want but we think that's silly ask it anyway well I don't know Berkley if it just it's so small and it's significant speak it anyway frankly if it seems too far speak it anyway my children is too far gold speak it anyway not healings through Fargo speak it anyway and I said now I want you to listen to the detail of this I said there red squirrel come down off that hill come right down this way right by me go out sit on that limb look down there at that farmer and here he come down the hill went right out sat and looked at the farmer and I shot him Satan said to me you know what the woods is just full of them now and I sit there till twelve o'clock and not another thing happen to show that God is the very creator of heaven and earth yes God's the Creator but William Branham was the one speaking tonight he's the healer but it's up to you to speak it tonight he is the revealer but it's up to you to speaking tonight he's the deliverer but it's up to you it's time to ask for the ridiculous I want to read you a scripture here Matthew 8:28 and when Jesus was come to the other side into the country of the Girt Girja scenes there met him two possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus thou son of God art thou come hither to torment us before the time and there was a good way off from them and heard of many swine feeding so the devil's besought him the devils are now praying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go now you might ask why am I reading that well it's very simple scripture said if you ask anything in my name I'll do it and even when demons asked him in the right attitude he had to meet their requests if God would meet the prayer request of the demons in the body of Legion how much more would he answer the request of the bride of Jesus Christ they said send us through the herd in Jesus name any sinner and then he brought healing to that body let me tell you something he wants to do it for you tonight you might know this story I'm trying to close now I'm just gonna wrap it up but there was a sister there was a sister that went through the prayer line and the meaning of brother Tim proves Church for her son that was not serving the Lord you probably know this story y'all know what I'm talking about you know what brother she went up for prayer for her son that wasn't serving the Lord and she said I'm asking the Lord to bring my son home well this prayer line goes on and on and on and this boy was out taking a nap and they said pretty soon the Deacons heard something crashing through the woods and he had a real nice pretty truck and he had drove that truck through ditches through the woods they said the truck was trashed by the time he got to the church because church had lasted a little long and he woke up from his nap and nobody was home and he called and he couldn't find nobody and he thought the rapture had taken place and while that prayer line was still yet going he was driving through fields because he couldn't even see the road he was crying so hard and they said the Deacons carried him through the prayer line and he received the Holy Ghost right there in that prayer life let me tell you you know we pray like maybe in the five years it'll happen but before she could get out of the prayer line her son was in the line behind her we serve a mighty God [Music] I'll give you some ridiculous requests I told the church in Iowa City about my dad he was born crippled doctor said he'd never walk again but he was sitting and only believed in 1961 in Chicago brother Branham called out my grandpa he said you're sitting back there he said your name's farmer you're praying about your son's feet he said he's healed in the name of the Lord you ought to hear my dad tell that story they told him that he would never wear anything but special built shoes and when he tells it for those
