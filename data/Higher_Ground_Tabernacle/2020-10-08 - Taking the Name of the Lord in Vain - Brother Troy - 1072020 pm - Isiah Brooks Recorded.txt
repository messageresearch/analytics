that when this life is over when this life is done that we can say lord i gave my life for you lord as much as you gave your life for me i have returned it lord lord i might not be able to do much i don't know what all i did do lord but one thing i do know lord is i submitted my life to the lord jesus christ amen you know as jesus himself prophesied he said many you're going to come to me and they'll say lord lord didn't i do this didn't i do that oh but there was one there was a humble one that would stand up and say lord when did we do these things when did we do these things and he said when you were led by the holy ghost to do this when you were led to do that and you gave your will over to me that's when you did those things for as much as you did unto the least of these you did it unto me amen let's just uh stand in honor of the word of the lord it's good to see everybody here this evening amen i didn't come here for any tradition i didn't come here for any other reason but i came here because jesus said that wherever two or three are gathered in my name all the way on down throughout all history down through the ages wherever two or three are gathered in my name i will be right there in the midst amen hebrews 13 8 when he comes he'll be the same yesterday today and forever amen so let's turn our bibles to exodus chapter 20 seventh verse i want to speak a message entitled taking the name of the lord in vain exodus 20 verse verse 7 familiar verse and it says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain amen i just want to read that one more time thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain anyway now let's turn over to uh matthew chapter 25. matthew chapter 25 verse 14 and it says for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and he gave one into one he gave five talents to another he gave two to another one and to every man according to his several ability and straight away he took his journey and then he that had the five talents went and traded with the same and he made another five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained another two but he that had received the one went and digged in the earth and he hid his lord's money amen now let's just uh stop right there bower heads and word of prayer heavenly father we just approach unto you this evening lord knowing lord that you keep every one of your appointments father and you made an appointment to meet with us this evening and in honor of that appointment and that appointment that calendar meeting that you gave unto us lord we come tonight and lord in honor of that lord we bow our heads and we pray we listen to your word and we say lord be it unto us lord according to thy word whatever it is it seems pleasing unto thy sight father just speak it lord and we'll say yes and amen and i am joining my hearts with these here in the congregation father the lord whatever it is that you would say out of your word we say yes and amen to your word so lord we just humbly open up our hearts to you say in whatever seems good in your sight father let it be done unto us according to thy word in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen you know the ten commandments as we read there in the beginning it's a very familiar scripture that there that we read was the third commandment thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain and you know many you know all as we learned growing up as it was spoke to us as we grew up as children that that was talked about you know swearing or you know or or saying the name of the lord in vain not to say use the name of the lord as a swear word as me people you know you'll hear people say oh my god and different things and it always makes me cringe when you hear people say that you know because we were taught as children don't do that you know don't take the name of god don't let the name of god be taken flippantly you know but as jesus said as he took the ten commandments and they took about the adultery he says but whosoever looks upon a woman you know never mind just the actual act but i want to take it a step further take it a step higher that whosoever even looked upon a woman as he took the commandment and he took it a step higher so i just wanted to take this commandment here the third commandment and i want to take it a step higher amen amen about taking the name of the lord in vain because taking it beyond just taking it as a swear word for all of us that have called ourselves christians in this last day that have called ourselves the bride of the lord jesus christ that somehow the word of the lord in this last layout of cnh where many are going to go down into lukewarmness many are the bi as the bible said in revelations chapter 3 that in the last days many will be lukewarm darkness will be upon the church amen the church will become a cage of every unclean and hateful bird in the midst of those last days there will be someone that will be called an overcomer amen amen there's going to be someone that's going to overcome these things there's going to be someone that's going to overcome lukewarmness there's going to be someone that's going to overcome the foolishness of this age the deadness of the churches the churches that live in sin uh the churches that live in the evil spirits that are roaming amongst the churches freely they're not being rebuked they're not being chastened amen but there will be a bride of the lord jesus christ they'll rise up and say unto thy word lord i clean amen it's unto those that the spirit of the living god is coming in this last day amen upon those he's knocking upon the heart's door and it's upon those they opened up their door and they said lord come on in and the word of the lord spoke to that bride and said in acts chapter 2 verse 38 he said you know they said what shall we do when peter was was preaching that great sermon after the day of pentecost and they saw the power of god was released to the church and everybody came and they said what shall we do and peter looked at him and he gave out the prescription dr simon peter wrote out the prescription for sin and disease and he says repent that's right amen repent everyone be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved you shall be saved from your sins amen that is the prescription to go on down through the ages amen he was the doctor he had the he knew what was wrong with the people amen jesus had taught him well and jesus gave him he says uh unto you i give you the keys of the kingdom and peter went right out and with those keys he unlocked that door and says whosoever repents in the name of the lord jesus christ receives is baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they will be saved and ever since then ever since then that's been the general orders the general orders they shall be saved but let me tell you whosoever goes down into baptism they go down into their waters and as the pre as the minister calls out over them in the name of the lord jesus christ i baptize you into the name of the lord jesus christ and the bible says and they rise up out of the waters and they walk in newness of life they are taking the name of the lord jesus christ upon them revelation says his name will be written upon their foreheads we're living in the days where everybody is going to receive a seal amen the one will receive the seal of the holy ghost amen because it's an inheritance to all that are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ the others will receive the seal of the mark of the beast amen why because that is the inheritance of those that receive why because there are two spirits that are living in the church there is a spirit of the living almighty god and there is the spirit of the beast and the from the ages old amen and those two spirits someone will receive one some will receive other some will be marked with the holy ghost some will be marked with the with the mark of the beast amen but to those that are sealed with the holy ghost they receive the seal of the lord jesus christ they're taking up the name of the lord but let me say unto you right now if you're taking up the name of the lord don't look look back look back to this commandment right here don't take the name of the lord in vain that word vein there means empty empty you took it up for no cause you grabbed the name of the lord and you went running but you ran aimless you took the name of the lord but nothing ever came to it you took the name of the lord in baptism but where is the fruits amen god is coming back for a church and he has a right to the fruits amen as jesus says that the husbandman had the right to the fruits amen amen the the the one that owns the garden has a right to come and inherit the fruit remember jesus one day he was walking and he the bible says that he began to get a little hungry amen he began to get a little hungry and he walks up to a fig tree you know and he was there when fig trees were created amen he was the one that spoke fig trees into existence he is the one that wrote the dna of the fig tree and it went down on generation after generation after generation bearing fruit and bearing fruit and bearing fruit and this and this fig tree that he's walking up to is the great great great great great great grandson of the original tree amen he walks up to it and he had a right to partake amen of the the fruits of that fig tree hey he walks up and he starts parting the branches and he look puts this branch up over here and he looks the whole tree over and there was not one speck of fruit on the whole tree hey man he looks at that tree and he curses that tree and he says let no man partake of you from his north now forever let no man ever partake of you ever again and the disciples they saw that and like that's pretty bold it's a bold statement you know why were you getting angry at the street you know and they go on about their journey and the day gets grows long and they back and and now it's getting late in the day and they're going back to where they're going to sleep that night and all of a sudden they pass by this tree and they see it it's all wilted the leaves are drying up and falling off and the disciples says master that tree that you cursed just this morning is already dying and jesus says take note every branch amen every tree that my father plants will be pruned if it bears not fruit it'll be cast into the fire but if it bears fruit it will be pruned so it might bear more fruit amen why because god has a right amen to come and enjoy the fruits of his bread to come and enjoy the fruits of his church amen and woe unto those that are taking the name of the lord in vain they took they went down into baptism they received the word of the lord with gladness remember the the parable of the uh the stony ground the seed that went into the stony ground the jesus said those are the ones that they receive the lord with gladness they hear the word of the lord they accept they're happy they're excited they're enjoying like my what a great message my what a powerful look at the signs so-and-so is healed so-and-so was delivered amen the presence of the lord came down and this person who had this problem for 20 years was delivered and never took another uh drug again never took another drink again and they were delivered in an instant amen they had cancer and they were healed and where and we rejoice in those things but all of a sudden then they go off and they never actually bear fruit why they are so excited to see the presence of the lord they're so excited to see the acts of jesus christ and living in the church they're so excited to see all these things but then all of a sudden you look at their lives and where did they go where are they where are they there's been people here that have danced in the spirit amen there's people here that have seen the signs they've seen the wonders they've seen people healed in this very congregation but where are they at they received the word with joy but where did they go amen all of a sudden they will they the bible says they had no roots amen they had no root why and god has a right to to to to to to enjoy the fruits of his bride but now where did they go they're no longer bearing fruit why they took the name of the lord they went down to the waters of baptism they rose up but they never walked in newness of the life of the holy ghost they they never walked in the newness of life the holy spirit can never live in them amen remember brother branham said that the the the book of acts wasn't necessarily the acts of the apostles amen it was the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles amen and that's so it's supposed to be every true church is supposed to write another book of acts behind it amen why because if the holy spirit is living amongst the church the holy spirit wants to move the holy spirit wants to act why because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen as we said there sunday you know the talking about uh uh jesus said wherever you on down throughout history amen i wherever two or three are gathered in my name i will be right there in the midst amen wherever you are gathering two or three gather them together in my name don't take my name in vain now but gathered truly in my name i will be right there in the midst of them amen and then as saint paul wrote there we gave the little parable about saint paul he was writing the uh the letter to the hebrews and he maybe paused there for a few days and went to pick up his pen and had his little table there and his little lamp and he sits down and starts writing hebrews chapter 13 and he writes the first verse the second verse and just as his hand is moved by the holy ghost and he's writing led by this the bible says that men of old led by the holy ghost wrote the scriptures and as he's writing there he writes the seventh verse down and he kind of pauses sets down his pen and all sudden the holy spirit speaks to him and says tell them hallelujah let the people know write it down so that all the ages will know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so he wrote that great scripture hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen we got and we we gotta believe in that amen we gotta accept that we gotta let the holy spirit move across that scripture brood across that scripture just like the uh the holy spirit did uh uh back when the world was in darkness amen holy spirit in genesis 1 moved over the dark over the dark waters and as he was moving brooding over the dark waters all of a sudden land began to come up amen then trees begin to sprout amen and so the same thing with the holy spirit will be against you allowing the brood over your life amen then signs wonders amen life the holy ghost amen begins brooding and brooding he's brooding over you was he rooting because he has a right to partake of the fruit of your life so but don't take the name of the lord if you're going to come upon this life journey count the cost the lord jesus said count the cost amen count the cost of coming upon this way but let me tell you it does pay off it does pay off amen let's just turn over our bibles to book a joshua chapter five you know the book of joshua is a great book they've been traveling for an entire generation they left egypt under the mighty hand of jehovah amen it's uh joshua 5 verse 1 we're going to read from they left egypt out of the mighty hand of jehovah he took them out of there delivered them signs and wonders amen they saw so much how could they doubt saw so much how could they not believe amen they saw they saw a god in action i i don't know about you but just seeing you know and even as a minister some of the things i've seen god do it's it's it's just you never get over it the first time i saw someone get healed by the laying on hands it shocked me not that god would do it but that god would do it through me and when i saw it i began to realize that it wasn't about my abilities it wasn't about my power it wasn't about my strength it wasn't about how worthy i was or how good i was or how how good of a life i'd been leading but by allowing the word of god to go into action putting trust in his word amen and just letting the word work just giving god a chance to act sometimes we just need to give god room to act in our lives amen we try to do so much on our own so much on our own but let me tell you put put put god to the test lay your prayer upon the altar i let god lord i'm just going to trust in you on this lord i just i know i could do this lord i know that maybe i have a right to do it in my own strength or something like that but lord i just want to see you in action i just want to see you in action in my life and let it be a beautiful thing to you amen because when all life when life's journey is over some of the greatest things in our life is when god acted on our behalf amen amen amen you know some of the greatest prayers or answers of prayer i've ever got ever had were not the ones that i fasted and prayed for but just the ones where i said oh lord i need this just now and god just answers i didn't fast i didn't pray i just said one quick prayer and all of a sudden i also knew maybe the day or two later you think oh my he just did it but i didn't have to try i didn't think you know like the bible says before you even think to ask i will answer amen joshua chapter 5 they've been going to the promised land now or through the wilderness for 40 years and they're finally coming into the land of promise amen god has led them out of the mighty hand they parted the red sea and now they've just seen the jordan part amen and come to this verse here after they cross over the river jordan and it says in verse 1 and it came to pass to when all the kings and the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until they were passed over that their heart melted you know i don't blame him they thought that jordan was protecting him but all of a sudden when god just took it out of the way their heart began to melt i don't blame him amen their heart melted and neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel how would you like to go to battle against the children of israel just now watching god march before them i think i'd just run the other way i'll go find me a new home somewhere else i'm heading to egypt their heart melted so here they are at the pinnacle they're entering into their inheritance the pinnacle of their journey and what does god tell them to do next what is the next step all power of god is behind them they're living in victory and everything is is behind them and they're getting ready to march in and take over all their enemies and what's the next step verse 2 at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins let's go on down to uh verse seven and it says and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and when it came to pass that when they were done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp until they were made whole and then the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off of you this is the day that the reproach of egypt was rolled off of them amen you know when mary when moses and miriam were dancing on the red sea shore after they came out of egypt the approach of egypt was still upon when moses stroked the hit the rock in the wilderness there they were and the water came out and two million people were able to drink in the middle of the in the middle of the desert with water and all that approach of egypt still upon them when the man was coming down from heaven approach of egypt was still upon them think about that if they would have all died right there in the wilderness and never went a step further they would have said the people would say well there are the people the slaves of egypt the left egypt saying their god would deliver them and there they are dead under the sand rotting in the desert floor egyptian slaves let me tell you no egyptian slaves were going to inherit that promised land they had to leave that slavery behind amen no egyptian slave was going to inherit that promised land amen and until they crossed the river jordan they were still just escaped slaves why because they had no inheritance it doesn't matter if they crossed the red sea it didn't matter if the man had fallen didn't matter that they had drank from the water in the wilderness it didn't matter if they had seen the pillar of fire up on the mountain top didn't matter they had followed moses all the days of their life amen let me tell you until they crossed the river jordan until they were circumcised the second time their approach of egypt was still upon them why they had no inheritance and let me tell you the only inheritance that we have this day is the life of the lord jesus christ on the inside that is our inheritance i don't care if you say that i repented i don't care if you say that that that that i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but if you just take the name of the lord in vain it's an empty an empty name to you nothing's ever come of it you can't point to anything in your life that god has ever done for you then let me tell you you do not have an inheritance amen you're just an egyptian slave but let jesus christ come down amen bring the answer fill you with his holy spirit fill you with his with him why because it's got to be the life of christ jesus christ is coming back not for your life he's coming back for his life in you amen he's coming back to see himself in you amen but if he comes back and he can't see himself in you many or many are going to say unto me lord lord i did this lord lord i did that but i'm going to say unto you they will not enter into my kingdom amen but it's those that did the will of the father amen the will of the father is to receive the holy ghost the will of the father is the keys that were opened on the day of pentecost when peter said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the life of the lord jesus christ amen it's not a badge on your shirt it's not a it's not oil it's not just a dove it's not just a doctrine of the of the lutherans it's not a doctrine of the methodists it's not a doctrine of the pentecostals amen the the the the catholics say when you take the holy eucharist you got the holy ghost they have to say when you believe you got the holy ghost the lutherans say when we lay our hands in confirmation class upon you you we are confirming that you have the holy ghost the pentecostals say that when you speak in tongues you got the holy ghost but let me tell you it's none of those things it's not a doctrine it's the life of jesus christ who is the same yesterday today and forever and he will come down on the inside of you and he will live himself out of you otherwise you're just taking the name of the lord in vain that's right amen amen amen amen taking the name of the lord in vain there's not for no reason took the name for nothing took the name be and nothing ever came of it you took the name of the lord upon you you talked about him and all that but his life never shined out of you my let your light so shine before men amen you gotta have something that god has done for you amen it takes a total surrender saints god's not coming for a halfway church amen jesus says count the cost well i tried that christianity but you know just never really seemed to get anything out of it amen until you can trust in the lord god with all of your all of yourself amen jesus said i call you friends not servants amen because a servant doesn't know what his master doeth amen but a friend with a friend he shares all things and let me tell you jesus christ in this last day has shared with us all things he's told us what day we're living in amen he sent us a prophet amen he sent us he he wait he laid wide open the book of revelation to us he showed us what was going on in this last day he opened up the seals amen he showed all the mysteries amen and now we can say i know where i stand amen i know like you all know my testimony i grew up in church i knew i was lukewarm but i didn't know what to do about it i knew i was just a lukewarm christian but i didn't know what to do and i cried out to god for years lord i'm lukewarm and i don't know what to do i don't know how to get out of this i don't know how to be delivered lord i'm a lukewarm christian lord help me god gave me the answer to this prayer when he gave me this message amen amen at the pinnacle of their journey as they're getting ready to enter into the inheritance he said sit down not not stand up go fight the enemy sit down cut off the excess flesh amen and that's what we'd all do the the new testament calls it the circumcision made without hands it's the circumcision of the holy ghost when the holy spirit comes and begins to scour you out because to clean out your life amen amen amen you you've repented of your sins you've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you submit yourself to the lord to god and all sudden he begins to point out things in your life point out things in your life what is he doing he's making room for the holy ghost foxes have holes the birds of the uh of the air have have nests amen but but the son of man has no place to lay his head jesus said but let me tell you after the day of pentecost that's when the headship of jesus christ came down amen that's when the headship began coming down when he had a place to lay his head he had a place for the holy spirit amen when when noah let the dove go out of the ark it came back he let the bird out of the ark and it came back he let the bird came out of the ark out of the ark and it came back but all of a sudden the bird brought back some branches the bird brought back some signs of life amen and then he let the dove out one more time and it never came back why because i found a place to rest and so is the holy ghost it goes out and it looks he's looking for a place to land he's looking for a place where he can land amen and let it be you amen if he can find a place in you amen a willing heart amen amen you know how the temple was built in the uh back in the time of solomon they took up a willing heart sacrifice amen let those he said he didn't put out a new tax upon the people he didn't say gave everybody 20 or give 30 percent amen but he says let there be a willing heart sacrifice let people bring in of their of this and bring in of that amen bring in they brought in willingly and laid down their offering willingly amen so we got to do in order to be a temple of the holy ghost in this last day for the presence to come down upon our lives amen we don't well i gotta be obey this commandment oh i gotta obey this commandment let me tell you the ten commandments amen in this day they're not they're not just commandments but they're invitations amen not not just that oh thou shalt not murder but you don't have to be in a murderer the holy ghost can take that away from you not just yeah do you thou shalt not commit adultery but you don't have to be an adulterer amen it's an invitation coming into the presence of the lord be delivered from the adulterous spirit be delivered from that lying spirit it's not if you try this if you try that but let the holy ghost it's an invitation come into the lord let the ten commandments bloom out of you like a uh like like fruit on the vine amen amen not just commandments but invitations you don't have to be a sinner anymore you don't have to have that sinful nature inside of you amen god says i will come down and i will bring you into newness of life amen something that's recognizable amen let me tell you the book of revelations talks prophesies in the last days there will be a bride of christ upon the earth amen in the book of genesis we found out that we are god's creation amen when we come down to abraham's time we found out that we are god's people amen and we come down to jesus time he says i gave you power to become sons and daughters of a god we went from the creation to the people to the sons and daughters they get to the book of revelation and it says there is a bride of the lord jesus christ the relationship with god and man has been unveiled and unveiled and unveiled it's like a roman candle going off and it opens up and then it opens up and it opens up oh we thought we thought we were just his creation oh we thought maybe we were just his people oh we thought maybe we were just his sons and daughters but no we are to be the bride of the lord jesus christ amen and let me tell you a horse marries a horse amen a dog marries a dog a man marries a man but who is jesus christ going to marry that he's got to marry someone that is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone it's like adam adam adam uh was told be fruitful and multiply i want you to be fruitful and multiply but he looked at himself he says lord am alone why was he alone because god was alone and he was made in god's image oh lord how can i be fruitful how can we how can i multiply and god says well let me just show you a little parable here and all of a sudden the animals start coming by and god tells that i want you to name all the animals and he starts naming the animals mr and mrs horse mr and mrs donkey mr mrs elephant and he sees them all in pairs man and woman female male male female but he looks to himself and i'm alone how can i be fruitful how can i multiply i'm alone and the bible says that he god brought all the animals by adam so that he could see what adam would name them and he named them but let me tell you he didn't call any of them bride not one of those animals did he call bride he just gave him their names that's not my kind that's not my kind that's not my kind amen then but then what what what what could happen he finished naming all the animals and how can he how can adam how can adam fulfill the commandment of the lord how can i do it i get to see adam now how can i do it he told me to be fruitful and multiply he told me to be fruitful and multiply i see the animals here but i'm not an animal i'm alone like god is alone how can i do it and god all of a sudden takes adam and he puts him to sleep and he reaches down into adam's side and he pulls out part of adam and out of adam he makes a bride oh he didn't take out of the animal race he didn't take out of the the plants or the birds or the land creatures he took he reached down on the inside of adam because on the inside of adam there was something amen the god had hidden there amen something that was in adam all that time it was in adam all that time amen the female part was there all the time amen god took it and he separated out of adam took the half out of him and created another half amen and the one became two amen and one and once there was two what happened adam wakes up and once there's two he joined them back together and it became one the one became two but then when he wakes up the two became one amen but then there one day there came a second adam amen now i think about it here is adam he finds out the eve coming he looks at her he says oh my this is now flesh of my flesh this is bone of my bone she came out of me but now she is mine she came out from me now she comes back into my arms this is now a woman this is my wife amen he loved her he cared for her he adored her she was the only one for him there wasn't another one there was no one else he could look at she was the only one for him that was his bride amen and when she fell into sin amen could he just go out and say lord i want you to get another feminine spirit out of me and i want you to get another rib out of me no he says lord i will redeem i will claim and he walked into sin the bible says knowingly he said the bible says that the woman was deceived in the transgression she didn't realize she didn't know and she was deceived into it but adam walked out willingly amen he had a choice shall i stay with god or do i walk out away out of the presence of god to be with my wife and he walked into sin knowing it was death to stay with his bride amen they were cast out of the presence of god cast out of eden amen lost their inheritance lost everything but he got to keep his bride but god said i will restore saith the lord on down through all the all the ages i will restore saith the lord because he had a slam the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world they began testifying testifying abel began it abel showed the the the type of it when he slew the lamb amen abraham slew the lamb moses slew the lamb they kept testifying there was a lamb slaying before the foundation of the world and all sudden one day god comes down in the form of a lamb amen the lamb of god that was slain for our sins amen and god sent himself his spirit in the in a body of flesh called jesus christ sent him down to the earth amen the earth said we don't want him he sent himself to the earth and there said we don't want him and the earth put him back up in the heavens on the cross amen and what and what this was the second adam hey he came to claim the second bride who had fallen and sent amen as as the second adam was there crucified on the cross hanging between heaven and earth amen that roman soldier went up and pierced his side and out of his side flowed water and blood and then jesus cried into thy hands lord i commit my spirit the three things that came out of jesus on the cross is water blood and spirit and now those three things are created a bride of the lord jesus christ amen we're washed in the water of the word amen we're cleansed by the blood of the lamb and then all of a sudden the life the spirit the holy spirit comes into your life it creates a bride of the second adam flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen oh we're no longer a son and daughter of mr and mrs seer of mr mr oduday amen mr mrs sweaty mr and mrs smith we're no longer that but now the bible says we've been given power to become sons and daughters of god and let me tell you jesus christ he can't marry the human race amen he's gotta marry someone that has his spirit amen has his likeness his flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen and so we have been transformed ephesian sets amen transformed we walk forward in newness of life amen we've been given power to become sons and daughters of god amen as paul said we are flesh of his flesh as he is quoting adam we are flesh of his flesh we are bone of his bone we have been created now to be the bride of the lord jesus christ amen but don't take the name of the lord in vain let his life come down inside of you let his life transform you and don't give up until you see the difference amen what god has to do something oh they always talk about the evidence of the holy ghost is this the evidence of the holy ghost is that but let me tell you the evidence of the holy ghost is when god comes and does something for you that you cannot do yourself amen when god changes you into his likeness amen amen when you begin to accept the word for what it says when you say yes and amen to the word why because your word become one amen because he was the word and we are his bride that's when you begin to actually bear the fruits of the vine amen that's when he when he walks by as the husbandman walks up to the fig tree and he starts looking in the branches looking to see what's bearing in your life what is there a fruit here also he doesn't have to look far all right because oh there's fruit on this branch over here there's fruit on that branch over here there's fruit up at the top there's fruit at the bottom there's fruit all over why because you're living the life of the lord jesus christ amen but for the tree that was not bearing any fruit amen it had a testimony of life it talked about life amen it's it's leave said i have life but it had nothing that could bring forth of its kind and god said let everything bring forth of its kind bring forth of its kind that's what genesis said let everything bring forth of its kind amen without the seed life the seed is in the fruit it's not in the leaves it's in the fruit amen and it's got to be something inside of you that brings forth something that looks like jesus christ so the seed that went into the earth in the beginning amen the seed that went into the tomb on calvary amen this the christ that went into the tomb that's what has to we we go forth and the death of baptism we rise up in newness of life amen but don't take that name in vain don't take it as an if don't let it just be an empty thing well i was baptized 20 years ago but you know i haven't really ever seen anything come on have you as paul said but have you received the holy ghost since you believed paul found walking and i forget where he was but he he found certain disciples he found some disciples that knew the word and he says well um disciples of john the baptist and he's like well you seem to know the prophecies you know a lot of this you know the doctrines but let me tell you have you received the holy ghost since you believed and in acts 19 these disciples said we didn't know there was such a thing for us we don't know about tell us about this doctrine oh let me tell you it's not a doctrine it's a life amen it's something that's going to come inside of you something you can't do yourself amen it's that pillar of fire that led the children of israel has now come down inside of you amen amen you know when brother bran was preaching the adoption series he says if a farmer comes to you his crops are burning up and he asks you for rain you ought to give it to him and there ought to be something inside of us that knows that we where our prayers go when we pray amen where does your prayer go when you pray do you know amen so many people say i just feel like my prayer just goes to the ceiling then meet god amen and don't let him go until he blesses you amen grab ahold of him amen grab a hold of him he who prays to my father in secret my father will reward openly jesus said amen the greatest reward is the baptism of the holy ghost jesus says whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do so that the father might be glorified in the son mark 16 these signs will follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils people are baptized let devils live all over inside their life amen you won't even cast out the devil in your own life let alone someone else amen in my name they shall cast out devils heal the sick they say oh that was for another age gone past jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has not changed amen a desolate vineyard god has you know the the husbandman has faith in the seeds that he plants these farmers out here they have faith that the they when they plant a seed of corn in the ground they have faith that that corn is going to grow up with more corn and that corn is going to look exactly like the seed that went into the down on the ground in the beginning amen so is it supposed to be that the alpha should become omega the first church should become the last church amen and so the same seed that went into the ground the church that died on the day of pentecost the church that died in the first church age the jesus christ the way in the tomb came out and was resurrected the church went into the tomb during the dark ages and died under the catholic rule in the 1600s hundred thirteen dollars nine hundreds whatever amen the church went down to the ground and died amen by she rose up martin luther said come up out of here a little bit and then john wesley said let's raise it up a little bit higher amen the pentecostal says let's go up a little bit higher all right let me tell you about we're not living in those ages we're not living the lutheran's age was all right amen wesleyan's age was all right they had their message amen the just shall live by faith martin luther says and i say yes and amen john wesley said we've got to have methods of holiness we ought to live a holy sanctified life and i say yes and amen the pentecostals marched out in 1906 and said yes we got it the just shall live by faith yes yes we gotta live a clean life that's right but let me tell you there's got to be a power of the holy ghost and to that i say yes and amen but now let me tell you we're living in the last dates we're living in the day of the rapture amen we gotta get these foolish things behind and we gotta live a life of the holy ghost because let me tell you the the rapture is is that one of these days the holy spirit is gonna leave this earth behind amen the holy spirit the bible says he who lets will be taken out of the way amen and there's going to be a three and a half year tribulation why is the tribulation going to be here because the oil of the holy spirit won't be in the earth anymore amen the blood let me tell you the whole earth is enjoying the blessings of the holy ghost the blessings of the holy ghost amen the sun rises amen the rains come they fall on the just and the unjust amen the the the churches enjoy the rain the homosexuals enjoy the rain amen the the buddhists enjoy the rain the hindus are enjoying the rain they're all in rejoicing winter reigns amen they and they're they can rejoice in those things but let me tell you one of these days all those blessings are going to be taken away why because the one that gave him in the beginning has been rejected amen he's been rejected in this last day amen but there's going to be some that will receive him the holy ghost has come back to the church in this last dates amen he's i am putting my life back in the church amen it died back in the dark ages but i'm raising it up again age after age until we come to this day in revelations chapter 3 the laodicean h the last church amen said i'll be lukewarm it'll be lukewarm they'll have uh they look like they're living but they're dead amen and all those things amen by all sudden revelations chapter 4 i saw a door open in heaven the church ages were over revelations chapter 2 and 3 was the church ages we get to revelations chapter 4 i saw a door open in heaven now let me tell you one of these days i'm going to see a door open in heaven and like enoch i walk with the lord he walked with the lord year after year after year after his last son was born his son was born in methuselah and all of a sudden he began walking with the lord and all those years he just walked walked and walked and walked and all of a sudden one day he took a step on his walk and his step didn't hit the ground and he just began walking right up higher instead of taking the same old path he took the king's highway and ended up in heaven there was like where'd he go he's gone he's gone amen so is it gonna be so with the bride of the lord jesus christ we trust in him we trust we're clinging to that holy spirit his life not just clinging to him but his life is springing out of us we see the evidence of the holy ghost inside of us it's the evidence of the life of the lord jesus christ living his life through us just like he's returned back to the earth again amen amen solomon stood there he he knew he was ordained to build that temple he knew he was ordained to build it and when he is done building it he says well i'm going to dedicate this tip of the lord and he stood up to the pulpit and he says this is a fine building nice stones we got the gold we got the sacrifice but just now we need to invite the presence of the lord jesus christ into this place because let me tell you i don't care how good the structure is it's nothing until the presence of the lord came in and solomon just bowed his head and he began to pray and he said oh lord i pray father over this temple let this temple be known as a repository of the presence of jehovah let this temple be known that if anybody anywhere has a problem if their land is burdened it won't bring up the crops if the enemy is coming if they've fallen into sin let them turn from their wicked ways let them come to this house let them have respect unto the name of jehovah and repent of their sins and you god will hear them and furthermore solomon said and furthermore i ask if a stranger comes to this land let him be a i am right or a hittite or anybody if he comes to this land and he has respects to the name of jehovah and comes and offers a sacrifice at this house the house of the holy ghost then let you lord hear from heaven and give him what he desires and where is the temple of the holy ghost in this state it's in the bride of the lord jesus christ so let anybody come to this last day bride and i don't care who they are let them know let all that all the nations know that the bride of the lord jesus christ is the repository of the holy ghost upon the earth and i don't care what their needs are upon this life's journey if they're sick if they're defeated if they're burdened if they're bound amen just let them come and have respects to the name of the lord jesus christ and let me tell you i have not taken that name in vain i know what that name is capable of i've seen it in action i know the power of the holy ghost i know the power of the blood of the lamb i know what that name is capable i have not taken it in vain amen i know what the power of that name is and i can let anybody come to me i don't care who they are how dirty they've been what they've done just let them come and have respect unto that name because i know what that name can do just here in closing i'll never forget that man that was healed in ohio and i know i testify this often but i was just a new minister and i went out there to preach and that man was a visitor to the church wasn't even a christian he'd just been invited to the church he i asked i preached the message as a new minister i can't imagine that the message is all that good but it wasn't me god it doesn't matter the format god's able and after this service i made an altar call if anybody desires prayer you're welcome to come up and i'll pray for you and this man he comes up and he's walking like this trying to get to the altar throwing his feet in front of him couldn't have a cane couldn't feel anything from the waist down and had a neurological condition for 12 years couldn't feel anything below his waist he could walk but he didn't really know where he's throwing his feet just threw him in front of him and walked lost his job years ago gained weight depressed and he came up wasn't even a christian and he camp he looked at me and he says i've had this for 12 years and i'm sick of it and i looked at him and all of a sudden in my mind i just began to see the woman that had the issue of blood for 12 years and the they came to jesus and i just laid out my hand me and a couple other brothers laid our hands on and i said lord as you healed the woman that had the issue of blood i pray this man has come up here i pray that you would heal him just now in the name of jesus christ he wasn't a christian but he had respects to the name of jesus christ he was healed before we go back to his pew delivered amen couldn't walk up two or three stairs the next weekend he helped a friend move up three flights of steps went back to his job that he lost 10 years back got his whole job back went back to see him a couple years later he didn't even look like the same person lost all of his weight and it's just a completely new man christian now serving the lord that's the god we serve he is still the same yesterday today and forever and he says wherever two or three are gathered in my name i'll be right there in the midst of them so right now tonight i tell you have respects unto that name come and god is able to deliver you god is able to heal you god is able to save you he's able to fill you with his holy ghost and you're able to walk out of here in newness of life i believe it i believe that all things are possible and to them that believe i believe that he is the same that he has not changed and i believe that he is coming back soon for a church that has not spot that has not wrinkled and when uh when the angel said to john i come look i want to show you something and then john comes up into the heavens and he says i saw i saw a bride descending out of heaven amen amen without spot without wrinkle amen having the glory of god upon her amen but let me tell you we don't have to wait till that that day you can be without spot without wrinkle right now you can have the glory of god upon you right now amen it's possible it's not just possible but if we don't do it we're just taking the name of the lord in vain for no reason we took the name of the lord for no reason we got baptized for nothing if the life of christ never comes and lives inside of us amen let's just stand god has a right to fellowship amen he called us for fellowship and he deserves that fellowship amen he created us for fellowship amen we got to fellowship with him so let's just fellowship with him just right now just for a second heavenly father i just thank you lord for these these kind people father come and listen to me so long a week day night lord probably worked all day maybe tired lord but yet here they are they listen to tently lord for this long message lord i just thank you for it father lord i just pray father for all of us lord we want to have respects unto your name lord we don't want to we don't want to just come and be baptized for nothing lord we don't want to come and cry out to you for nothing lord we don't want to just pray to you for nothing lord but we want to see the evidence of the lived resurrection lord because you are not dead you're not in some tomb somewhere but you are risen amen and you have risen lord and now you are sitting upon the right hand of the father lord and i pray lord that you have not left yourself without a witness but you said that as you are ascending lord paul said as he was ascending he gave gifts unto men he gave some pastors some evangelists some teachers amen why it's for the perfecting of the saints to preach this holy ghost message amen now you've come in this last day you said oh there will be many in the last days they'll be lukewarm there'll be many that that think they're hot when they're actually cold there'll be many that that think they can see but they're actually blind amen there'll be many of us saying to me lord lord we did this uh we served here oh we we we performed miracles we did signs we did wonders but let me tell you they didn't have his life [Music] but his bride stepped up and she said lord when did we ever do these things he says oh as much as you did unto the least of these see the holy spirit was just in them they didn't have to try to act the holy spirit acted through oh lord i pray let it be unto us according to thy word you gave peter the keys to the kingdom and he marched out on that day of pentecost the birth of the new church he said repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ you have respect unto that name you'll be filled with the same holy ghost that brooded over a dark world back in the beginning that caused that dark world to come this paradise of life life is covering the entire earth the whole world is filled with life from the deserts to the oceans to the jungle to the air to the dirt lord i pray let it be so with your bride lord she is filled with the life of god on the inside doesn't even know that half time that she's serving you because it's just the holy ghost living your his life out of it let it be unto us just like that father we surrender lord our lives to you tonight in the name of jesus christ god bless you i hope something was said that was a blessing unto you amen we're not we i didn't come here to be lukewarm i didn't come to this day to live a halfway christian life if i can't be everything this gospel says i should be and why did i start i didn't come to start halfway and not finish but i came to live this gospel out amen and like like a gideon said of old and he is living there in the promised land but not enjoying any of the promises he was living in the promised land hiding from the enemy he would grow his crops and the enemy would come and steal and they would starve until the next season and they grow their crops and the enemy would come and through the land steal them again and one day as he was hiding his crops in a little building hoping that maybe he'd have just a little bit of food left for the year [Music] that angel came to him and said oh thou mighty man of valor and he says lord you might call me that [Music] but i want to ask you if god is with us then where are all of his miracles if god is with us then why am i living in this promised land in bondage if god is with us and i have this bible right here and all these printed promises printed on the pages yet they can't seem to come off the pages and live in life i see healing but where is it i see deliverance but where is it lord i see all these things where is it at lord i need it i want to see it i want to see the holy ghost living and alive in my life lord you promised it lord i'm calling your promise lord where is it at because when christ comes back to the earth i'll be holding up this word saying lord i've seen the evidence of the land it's a good land i've partaken of the fruits i've seen eight and the grapes and all the good fruits of the land i have lived it out i've seen it in action in my life all the promises of the book to me are mine [Music] a bride descending from god out of heaven having the glory of god no spot no wrinkle no blemish by the blood of the lamb and the word of her testimony revelations 12 says heaven and brother can you come if anybody desires prayer i will pray with you
