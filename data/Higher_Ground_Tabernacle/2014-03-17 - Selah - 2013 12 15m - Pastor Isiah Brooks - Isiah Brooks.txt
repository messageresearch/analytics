TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to be coming from two passages of scripture here this morning we're coming from St John 1 and one which is a familiar scripture and then we'll ask that you turn with us to Philippians 4 and 8 St John 1:1 and Philippians 4 and8 St John 1 and one we know should by heart in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen can't get it no simpler than that amen Philippians 4 and8 and it reads finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever Things Are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things amen I am a temple of God Amen full of praise full of power is that right amen amen Men full of Glory think on these things let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Father for being our provider you have been more to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord we are just humble creatures we come in Your Name Lord God in Thanksgiving with Thanksgiving thank you for your Grace and your love we ask these things this morning that you would bless strengthen us Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated uh for those of you I I I don't know whether uh you know our sister uh Grace amen she won't be back into February she's now visiting on her on her on her uh winter break there in school she's visiting her relatives in Baltimore so if you don't see her she's not getting slacked she just not here by the grace of God and she'll be uh going to church up there in Baltimore so let's pray that God will bless her and strengthen her uh while she's there I just like to entitle this message this morning CA think on these things s e l a h you'll see that in the song psms uh when it's not in the Psalms there is a place called CA which means Rock so but in the Psalms amen when you see the word CI it means to pause or to think on it uh because uh it's it means it's so good amen and and you've heard by the grace of God many times amen when it gets really uh good brother Brown will scream out don't miss this amen so it's something that God wants us to know when you see that word ca he wants you to meditate on it he wants you to get to a place amen that the word of God just doesn't go into your head or as they say uh uh in one ear and out of the other amen but he wants you to really look at this thing because amen is important now the word of God is important and we should know know this but we want you to realize amen where we are and I'm by the grace of God I pray that God will bless this morning that you'll be able to see and understand amen that we're not something that happened by chance but we are the very thoughts of God expressed now we're still dealing with thoughts this morning we don't want to let this go until amen we've chewed everything out of it because I want you to real realize amen that your thoughts as the prophet of God said is is is it sounds out louder in heaven than in earth right and I showed you amen the last time I was here as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen so we realize amen that when we are changed we're not changed amen just in our head alone but we are changed amen beginning Amen in the very holies of holies now watch this because amen the prophet of God brings it out and he tells us amen that you know when the world was justified amen under the water baptism there Amen in Noah's day it still didn't change anything right amen as soon as Noah got off the ark sin prevailed is that right amen and we find out you said well just the blood the blood in itself has the power to change amen but if it doesn't go down to the soul of a man amen it brings no change the blood amen was shed what over 2,000 years ago amen and it was dropped upon the Earth but it still brought forth thorns and thistles Hallelujah but we're living in a time of transformation when God will come around and and not only just uh uh make the outward appearance look good but he's come to change you from the inside out and this is the age that God has come when the veil has been rent and God can walk in right into the Holiness of of the the the place in your heart and make it the holies of holies amen now I want to say this that uh we ought to understand that how would I say it in the beginning was God and God was a spirit but understand this Spirit thought amen and the Bible said he spoke amen but what understand this this the speaking amen was the very Mind Of God his thoughts being spoken amen and when we we think of speaking we think often time our lips must move but often time we speak when our mouths are shut that's why God said that he is a discerner of the very thought and intents of the heart because amen your speaking inwardly is the thing that God would judge you by and that's why God said you always should uh the prophet of God said you always should always say what you're speaking and speak what you say in other words don't let your words be hypocritical don't speak nice things when you're on the inside you have a evil intent amen so listen a word is a thought made manifest God had to think it before he could make it a word hello now you said what brother Bo what are you saying let me put it this way you see with your mind you think with your mind because really amen all this house is this body is just an Avenue for the spirit that's in you to express itself right right these physical uhh part of you is not the Thinker amen it's The Man Behind that's operating the machine amen y'all hear what I'm saying it's like a computer it has all the abilities Amen to function and to operate but it needs a mind behind it amen like your body that's why when your spirit is gone there's nothing to operate the body so you and I must understand by the grace of God that when God is when you're thinking and when your words are being expressed mean you you got to understand you can have your mouth shut and God can still hear you amen so God had to think it before he could make it a word then he spoke spoke the word and it materialized amen now the same one that sent the Lord Jesus here by his spoken word I like that the same one amen that sent the Lord Jesus by his spoken word amenallah is that all right it materialized and became the Son of God Amen understand it was the spoken word Let There Be amen the the word went out and it materialized amen and we call it the Son of God Amen now God can't do it no other way amen when God spoke it amen guess what when he spoke I don't know how he does it all I know that when he spoke Jesus Christ I was there amen Not only was I there and you there but you were in him amen hallelujah when God created Adam he created all of Adam's kind one shot in one seed amen amen is that right like they said you can count the apples in the tree but you can't count the trees in the apple one seed brought forth all mankind amen y'all know what I'm working with am mean so you got to realize by the grace of God that in Jesus Christ was every seed that God was going to make manifest amen not one more not one less but all of this was a thought it your little mind can't even fathom this so you might as well believe it amen one thought sent Jesus Christ to the Earth and not one part of God's word ever faled amen whatever God thought him to thought him to be is what he was and what he is today amen same with you amen hallelujah amen amen think on it I want you to think on this because listen as I said you and I are now in a place where we God can show us how powerful the mind is we've come through the eye age which is the prophet age but above the prophet here is the Mind see that's why the prophet could say like Jesus said I can't do nothing until he shows me amen because amen he couldn't see it it was the mind that saw it and the mind amen uh connected to the body and the body saw what the mind was seeing and declared it thus say the Lord amen see and you and I must understand that's the way God wants to operate with us amen second Corinthians please you see the fall brought mortality the resurrection brought immortality and now we're living in the age where the fall brought death and pain and all of these things but in the midst of all of this the word of God said God never left himself without a witness amen hello somebody I don't care how dark it is at night God still got witnesses all of the stars of heaven and said he lives see God never leaves himself without a witness now we look at this thing and the Bible says let's turn there quickly you you probably there already the word of God said cast down is that right it says cast down every cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God what is the knowledge of God the knowledge of God is the very thoughts of God on page Amen on paper however you want to put it on sheep skin but nevertheless it is the thoughts of God now understand this as I said last time I spoke the thoughts of God has always been in here but it took prophets come on somebody like Amos 3:7 God cannot do anything except to reveal it to his servant a prophet so it takes a prophet to catch the thoughts of God because they are designed in that way amen hallelujah Moses how how did Moses know what happened in Genesis except amen he caught the thought he understood by thought by the the revealing of God by way of thought amen now some of y'all might not think your thoughts are real but your thoughts are real if your thoughts were not real your thoughts would not be judged you can sit right here in this place and travel in your thoughts amen hallelujah and you can do evil or wickedly in your thoughts sitting in your chair amen amen that's true amen hello y'all understand what I mean let me say it like this your thoughts travel your thoughts are not limited to your body amen hello your body is just a channel for this Earth this world but understand the spirit man is eternal amen hallelujah so you must understand amen that if your thoughts wasn't a part of you or wasn't the real you you wouldn't be judged by judge for it hello somebody come on somebody that's why the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen because you can sit right here and you can think and you can act it out In Living Color nobody will know it but you and God Amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen now your those same thoughts can take you to Heavenly places amen I'm about to shout here tonight amen because God said think on these things see that's why the Bible tells us hold up wait here ponder it think about it you'll be translated if you you can go there W you can go there I know it down the road if you don't hear what's being said now you know in a bit you know because you got to realize by the grace of God it's it's effective now listen what the prophet said in wisdom and versus Faith he says what your thoughts are is what you are no matter what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are you might go along and act like a nice fell but in your heart you're in adulterous or whatever it is that's what you are your thoughts so let me say it like this it doesn't matter what you appear to be to me amen it's what you are in your heart amen your thoughts are what God is what God is looking at or is what God is hearing hello somebody that's why the Bible said be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind amen your thoughts must be transformed it m they must be changed amen y'all hear what's being said here I want you to think about what I'm saying because God is saying listen I'm here to change you amen not just a outward appearance but on the inside amen so that you can see amen that you and I can connect because remember I told you as long as your thoughts connect with God you're all right amen it's when our thoughts wander it's when our thoughts go into places that God wouldn't dare go into is when you become disconnected with God hello somebody amen now I want you to understand because a lot of time people think amen that you know you can just uh how can I say it you just going to have this metamorphous change but I want you to understand the prophet preach a message about trans transforming being transformed and the power of transformation and if you look into that message if you hear that message you'll see that in that changing there you got to go through something you go through something he goes on and he talks about how it was in the beginning in the message power to of transformation he says listen he said it it it it's been a a it was dis earthy let me let me back it up here it says the world without was without forming was void and there was nothing but just a darkness of chaos what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but way into the darkness Yonder without light or anything and churning of the water that's wondering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a terrific mass of something lost like it was couldn't find its way and that's what we become when we become wondering Stars away from God just without hope without god without just turning around out in darkness is not knowing when we where we're going and God took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden amen so let me put it this way if God did that to you to the Earth he can do it to you amen amen but there was a process yes amen though Justified sin was still there in the heart yes amen uh come on somebody those Sanctified sin was still there in the heart but the only thing that could bring you to a complete birth is the Holy Ghost and without it Hallelujah you won't make a Rapture amen amen there must come a real fire baptism in your heart amen hallelujah y'all can when I say heart I mean in your mind and your heart because your heart's mind is what God judges You by whatsoever is in the heart will come forth if God is setting on the throne of your heart only Holiness only righteousness will come forth but if the devil is on there that's why the Bible said he don't share his throne sweet and bitter water can't come out of the same Fountain can't happen don't make any difference how religious and let me tell you something around this message the devil will make you religious is is as as Rel religious as you want to be but that's not salvation is that okay casting down casting down all of these reasoning but look he goes on to say if there very if the very Holy Ghost has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you amen H come on somebody what kind of a church you said a brother I'm not there yet but that don't mean you can't get there amen but it was God that orchestrated every birth amen it was God who brought the flood it was God who brought the blood and it's God who brings the fire am Hallelujah a complete Redemption plan Hallelujah that God's want to do in you but you see you must let him is that all right because the word let means to give way huh and that's what happened if the earth I don't know how they heard his voice but they obeyed it Hallelujah and it brought forth a the Garden of Eden amen because it obeyed the word of God it done the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a Garden of Eden ooo by the word of God see a lot of us we don't even realize what this mean to us we think this this is just a book hallelujah it's more than a book and I'm going to show you that in just a moment it's more than a book to the believer is more than a book amen amen you love the Lord amen I want you to think about what I'm saying because remember I told to you by the grace of God how that the thought scientists have come up where that uh uh thought is faster than sound it's faster than light it it travels between 500 to 750 milliseconds whatever that is all Paul could say was like a twinkling of an eye but you must realize if it's really faster than that because you can die now and be in heaven and brother Brom said it was 5 five billions of years away now I know he says it's dimensional it all depends on which way you travel but we realize by the grace of God if science had to get there it'll take the them a long time but he said think about it when you die just in a matter of a second or so you there amen so if you can travel billions of miles in a second can anybody calculate that for me oh I got something hey I hope y'all don't mind cuz I'm going to take my time this morning you see why because you see when God places you in a Revival nothing can stop it amen I'm going to tell y'all something see when we were there in in uh in in Alaska we didn't get a chance to go to uh a place called chac uh and and my wife and I and and it was it was it was trying uh yes but nevertheless amen here we were at an airport called bethl we're at a at a at an airport amen and now we're thinking we can't take our flights out and and and we're going to be stranded here at the airport we find out around 6:00 you guys got to go we didn't have nobody to communicate with there was nobody answering phone calls and you know anyway we ended up at this hotel didn't want to go to this one because we had already been told that drunkers and everything hang out at and I'm like Lord God knows don't want to end danger my life but God has something there for us hallelujah when we got to The Breakfast Table this this this uh this man who was a Eskimo he comes and he's talking and he says you know he began to talk about the Lord he saw us praying and he said you know God led me to the book of Isaiah he said the chapter two but I'm not going to give y'all that one but he said the Lord sent me to the book of Isaiah I said my name is Isaiah he said well maybe it's for you and this man began to tell me some things by the grace of God and and I was encouraged but lo and behold before we get a chance we had to go back to the airport this man told me that God told him to find me and this man began to tell me things my wife as well things to her that's so encouraged me it was just the answer to my prayers things that he said amen definitely uh how can I say it it it with all of the prophecies and things that went forth here goes something against in building upon what God has already told me amen and and you know it so encouraged me because I realized had I taken the plane to chac I would have missed my messenger you know what he said to me God showed him this was a Divine appointment now y'all don't have to believe it but all I know is that God hides himself in Simplicity and God can speak to anybody he wants to so I'm look looking at this thing and I'm saying well God you know you want people but I realize amen that God I don't care how many people we could have a thousand people in here God will never be able to operate until your faith operates it y'all hear what I'm saying he couldn't even do Mighty Works in capernium because they didn't have the faith amen and if I preach if God see so what are you worried about I'm not worried about what nothing I'm looking for God to anoint your faith amen now faith comes by hearing but still God has to anoint it amen hallelujah so let me move on he goes on and you know talks about always staying with the word he said check out your motives and your objectives if it is according to the word of God if it isn't if it isn't leave it alone see but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then that's see you hold to that now we've been preaching you're bride you're Christ you're the word you're this you're that and how many of us are holding to it amen holding to it till God brings it to pass because you can't do it amen none of us could do it amen all the prophets of age couldn't do it amen it didn't matter what Covenant God brought he had to bring a covenant unconditional because man no matter how much he tried he was a failure to begin with so God had to bring a unconditional Covenant hallelu I'll do it Abraham and he swore by himself he'll do it amen and God is not a liar amen so what do you wor I'm resting on the truth of the word hallelujah if he said he'll do it for me he'll do it amen that's what the prophet of God said Abraham when you going to have this baby and how you know I know I'm going to have this baby how come because God says so hallelujah how do you know brother Bruce you're going to make a Rapture I know because God says so hey come on somebody y'all looking at me like I'm crazy this morning but we got to understand Hallelujah that the power of God is trying to anoint you even this morning but if you don't open up your heart amen he's like knocking at your door if you don't open up your heart he can't come in and S with you amen he's been knocking for a long time Hallelujah but God said he'll never live himself without a witness hallelujah hallelujah you look at this thing you said oh brother Brooks you you you know you you maybe I'm out of my mind but it's a good thing I'm so glad to be out of my mind right now amen because right now I realize what he's doing you know he's washing me you may not understand it but the word is washing me and if you let him wash you he'll wash you from your thoughts it's your thoughts that's crippling you amen hallelujah it's your thoughts amen that's why he told in the word of God he said I want I want you to know my thoughts concerning you my thoughts concerning you that you would have an expected end amen hallelujah God's thoughts concerning you that you would have an expected in I accept his thoughts amen concerning me he goes on and says you know we're the ones that get in a hurry God never is in a hurry amen see what I'm saying that's where we mess up oh God do it for me and do it now God does it when he wants to do it but in your patience possess ye your souls when God said that's why when God said let there be light it never said how long it took for it to make manifest but it did it happened Hallelujah come on somebody look at this thing the when when it comes to the rapture we look at it it should have been over a long time ago but God is still longsuffering he was longsuffering for seven Church ages and he's longsuffering on the eth amen hello somebody amen and God is moving her little by little by little by little in your heart if you can see it amen amen now listen what's going to happen to you if you thrown into the fiery furnace the prophet of God said this age will be seven times harder in which it is now some of us amen think you're not going to go through nothing but the prophet of God said Just remember last week I brought it out to you amen just like that little girl amen who screamed and she screamed and she screamed amen because the lights were turn out and that little fell amen that young man says oh oh don't be afraid little sister I know a man who can turn on the lights Hallelujah and he said that was liken unto the bride because the darkness will be will come just that quick like somebody switching the light switching the light and he says she was scared oh I ain't scared yes he said she was scared until he she heard her little voice be don't be afraid little sister amen there's a man who can turn on the lights Hallelujah the bride will be comforted in that hour she'll know oh my and listen he brings it out little by these little words he's saying there he said he allowed the Hebrew boys to go right to the edge of it right to the edge of it not the beginning but right to the edge of it right to the almost the revealing because if you hear and they reveal the Antichrist you missed the Rapture Hallelujah when he comes out in full force and make himself known and you're here you miss the Rapture but God will take you almost to the edge of it you can't buy or sell you can't eat like you want to and do things like you want to every door is shut to you you're the insane person you're the lunatic hallelujah oh but God ain't going to send my the bride through Great Tribulation no she will not he said but she'll suffer but she'll overcome amen [Music] am you know he goes on to say in this message power transformation he talks about the Hebrew boys and he says our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace nevertheless we won't bow to the image because it is the against the word amen I don't care what it is we're not bowing to it amen because is against the word is that all right that's right he all together if he slay us he'll raise us up again is that right he let them walk right to the edge of the great furnace of it and dropped into it before it seemed like he even paid any attention you think you're having a hard time in breaking through or knowing that God is there when that light switches off Hallelujah come on somebody it's your thought that's what you're going to be thinking then hallelujah but if you don't know the word how you going to think the word amen amen hallelujah God thinking through you amen hallelujah you said God can't do it he did it through the animals come on when they were supposed to uh get on board the ark amen Noah didn't have to go hunt for them God sent them amen and let me say if God can talk to the animal he can talk to this one amen hallelujah oh glory to God that's right remember I brought out Enoch being translated with God translated translated translated because what he walked with God he lived with God he fellowship with God he communed with God is that right he commune with God he communed with God when the last you commune with him he communed with God he broke bread with God he didn't have to walk on on the road of emus Hallelujah he broke bread with them he didn't have to sit at a table with natural bread he broke bread with them and that same Jesus Christ is breaking bread with the bride of Jesus Christ on a daily basis amen is that right give us this day our daily bread he breaks it for you he opens the word of God to you on a daily basis if you commune with him Hallelujah then your thoughts become his thoughts his thoughts become yours amen you one in mind let this mind be in you that was in Christ Hallelujah is that okay so we look at these things you and I must understand what God is trying to do for us amen he wants us to think about we haven't been thinking about these things like we should we worried about our bills and our our family Affairs and oh what's going to happen here and what's going to happen there that's the trick of the devil God want you to think on him if you're in the Cliffs of the rock don't worry about the storm the storm will take care of itself but like I said you got to prepare for war in a time of Peace the bride have made herself ready is that right how she made herself ready by the word of God hallelujah she began to think like the word hallelujah act like the word do like the word she is the word amen oh y'all don't believe that Hallelujah amen let me move on see we look at speed sometime you know I don't know whether when we how fast we think it get to God when we do something wrong faster than you could imagine amen and it gets to God faster than you can than you can think of when you do something good it's fast too but listen let me let me read I hope y'all don't mind me doing this but let me read this coming from uncertain psalm he said why my Jesus came from Glory quicker than a thought can get there to him that's just how much that's this is how fast this is he said you know e Einstein proved that if two forces are coming fast enough they could pass right through each other and never never bother each other if two cars were coming down the road and they were both going at the terrific speed faster than sound just billions of miles per second they probably pass right through each other without hurting one another at all he proved that by forces striking together you see we are such Earthbound people till about all we think about and can think about is always time and space but when we leave this world we'll go into where there is no time amen now think about it the scripture said time will be no more amen hallelujah why because we broken into a Eternal age but we need to startop thinking eternally amen see the problem is we're thinking like men we still think about time and space that's what hinder Miracles amen we think it always a miracle and a Healer healing is a process of course but a miracle can happen is as quick as God can get there amen and how fast is that see we can think of 50 m per hour and 100 miles an hour and 2,000 M an hour and 10,000 miles an hour that don't even start when we think of Eternity Jesus after he had been glorified received his glory of glorified body raised up from the dead and had ascended on on high to the father come back in a few seconds later with such a terrific speed till he come right in before the disciples through a wall and never even moved the wall and yet with a body that could stand there and eat flesh fish and bread amen Hallelujah come on somebody that speed coming through you well that was his resurrection body but what about the body who walked on the water amen amen huh what about that body that called Peter and said Peter you come what was it Peter didn't think on his thoughts he thought the word come and that word was God's word and all Heaven and Earth had to obey it even the sea it was only when Peter got his thoughts off of Jesus amen that's when he sang when he his thought became Earthbound and when he be his thoughts became Earthbound he became Earthbound come on somebody let me tell you something the laws of God is sure and you don't even have to be a Christian to operate amen there are people Amen in all kinds of religions actually operating the laws that are here come on somebody and you know what they catch up with them by meditating on Words you say they brainwashing mean you better let the word brainwasher cuz that's exactly what all of us need we need a real brainwashing by the water of the word because your thoughts are not lining up with God that's most of us ain't happy like we ought to be is that right come on somebody it's true you're allowing your thoughts to fail the Bible said in the presence of the Lord amen there's fullness of joy amen amen so when the fullness of joy ain't there that means you ain't in the presence that's right because I don't care what kind of thing situation you going through a me you well I'm going through a hard time well you didn't see the Hebrew boys weeping and they were headed for the fire you didn't see uh Daniel mourning and crying out Save Me Lord you know with all that kind of stuff y'all hear what I'm saying when he was being thrown into the fire I mean through the Lion's Den there is a there is an element there is a world there is a at atmosphere you and I can live in and the devil won't be able to touch us come on somebody you said that can't be that's the truth amen the prophet of God said Jesus had undisturbed faith and if he had undisturbed Faith his faith is our faith so it must be undisturbed hallelujah amen oh help us Jesus help us it's a growing period it's a washing period it's growing but let him let him take you there amen hallelujah he goes on and says quick as you can confess wrong he can run the devil out and bring himself in woo now the process oh I got to fast and pray for 30 days before he can come in just as quick as you confess it you can get the devil out and Jesus can come in amen amen right he can run the devil out and bring himself in just as fast as you can have enough Faith to believe it hallelujah amen come on somebody but of course as I said we are in Earth uh earn people and we can only measure inches miles and so forth it was once quoted what if a little baby in the womb of its mother could think if it if it would happen to say well you know uh uh they tell me it's just a few days and I'm going to be born woe is me they tell me that outside there there's so much room and there's a sun that shines and people walk about where will I get my living I derive my living from right inside what will become of me woe is me when I'm born well then after he's born he'll never want to go back again amen hallelujah huh that's right the way we try to think and multiply that by B millions and trying to compare Heavenly things with eternal things amen Earthly things excuse me is so much greater amen ask me do I want to go back I tell you straight up no sir amen amen we just got a few voices in here is the these people in that's making noise here y'all don't they're the only one that can make noise if y'all made noise y'all wouldn't be paying attention to somebody else is making noise amen I don't mind the noise I want the noise but I want you to hear as well though amen oh Lord help us Lord as I said you hear with your mind or excuse me see with your mind is that right you why would you say that cuz your eyes can see something and misinterpreted is because your mind misinterpreted it your eyes see exactly what it is but your mind says ooh right your mind and mean you can see something Innocent but your mind can misinterpret it y amen amen hello somebody amen and you can see something that's perfectly bad and your mind can think it's good amen it's how you thinking it's how you allowing the thoughts of God y'all hear what I'm saying is how you allowing the thoughts of God to flow through your service your your your being Hallelujah listen the Devil comes to steal kill and destroy amen he's here to bring distraction so therefore if you listen or hear or see distraction you guess what you're distracted amen and you can't get what God trying to get give you y'all hear what I'm saying now I'm looking at this thing listen Philippians 2:5 is that all right as I said we see with our mind Jesus always addressed the Pharisees and teachers of his day of what they saw him to be in their mind hello when he went down to Simon's house guess what Luke 7:39 if you want to be there hold on to Philippians Luke 7:39 he it goes on they spake with within him he spake Simon spake within himself and God heard him and that's when most of us talk we speak mostly inside we give people what they want to hear but we speak mostly inside and that's what God hears come on somebody and sometimes from the pull pit I can hear it cuz and God are one when the anointing of God is here I'm not alone so sometimes your thoughts come up and you think I don't hear I hear it cuz God hears it amen now say vice versa if you in the spirit you can hear me Hallelujah you don't believe that Peter and Paul walked to they were there at the gate of beautiful Peter they perceived that he had Faith Hallelujah come on somebody what was it they caught it by thought amen most of the time you catch a person's being by thought you perceive they need God you hear they need God come on and a person can say one thing and your Holy Ghost will say oh oh d ain't right amen amen because you're walking in the spir oh Lord and walking in the spirit is walking in the mind and the thought of God Philippians 2:5 you know what I'm working with this morning your mind not that I want to enter in I don't want you to have my spirit or anything but I tell you what you need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Spirit and you you know we got to we we look at this thing and and you know it's amazing because you'll go places and you're preaching or even in here maybe I'm not as deep but you know what I know I'm it's true and you know as long as I stay make keep it true it we'll be okay amen now look at this Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen huh who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God Amen but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made like made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also highly exalted him and give him a name which which is above every name hello let me put it this way let me move on that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in Earth and things under the Earth let me say it like this if you are truly sealed with the Holy Ghost you are the walking name of Jesus Christ you are the living name of Jesus Christ amen hello if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost you got the very character of Christ and the character is what makes the name amen hall hallelujah and wherever light is Darkness tremble amen you don't have to fear Darkness amen when you are the light amen is that the Bible ye are the lights of the world I'm enjoying this now I'm going to bring something I ain't going to be too much longer CU I'm going take this and take it to the next service but I I'm going you know because we we've been how can I say God got to wipe all of this away can I put it this way and this thought was brought to me by a brother in conversation good is as evil as evil so let me explain that to you because the knowledge of the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was it all evil or was it is it all good well it all depends on how you're looking at it because I'm going tell you something that good was not God the only good is Goden so that good was a falsehood it appeared to be good because it talk taught that good was science amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying that good got e even trouble cuz that good wasn't God God has never been a hybrid tree he was the Tree of Life see what I'm saying so what happened was we find out when that good oh come on listen when that that rich young ruler came up to Jesus he was good he had done everything good he did all the moral things all the things religious thing everything that look good see that's what I'm saying your religion can look good good yet you can still be evil y amen y'all hear what I'm saying because you see that good ain't what God looking for amen the good he looking for is God oh my see because that good brought in scientific discoveries amen after the fall they went into science they went into music they listen and now even today that same good which is called music just one of the things got people thinking that they're good because they can sing gospel and yet they're evil amen see what I'm saying these inventions and all of these things let me tell you something there will be no airplanes there will be no no no motorcycles or no bicycles or no none of that thing none of it will be there there'll be no drug stores is the drug stores good y'all hear what I'm saying y'all hear what it is in the in the science realm but the science is the thing that's e evil amen amen science in itself has become the god of this world one of them it won't be no drug stores there even though drugs helped you but the same drugs you take is part good and evil amen yes so you see that is you know that kind of good will not work amen you're being good oh I go to church I've been Pious I I don't get upset up that don't mean a thing you must be born again that's the good God's looking for amen there's a lot of people in denomination can wrap you around their finger when it come to being good that's why Paul say you can be good you can have faith to move mountains you can give all your goods to the poor and you can have this and that he said but it don't profit you nothing if that charity isn't there if that love isn't there if that Holy Ghost is not in your soul think on this think on what I'm saying this morning amen because there's so many people think because they're not running the clubs they're good did I bring the point clear I'm trying to get to one thing and I'mma leave it there this is it and I'll start this evening coming from the power transformation he said you people that follow these tapes our brother here now you heard me preach on the serpent seed and that cannot be denied that was opened up in one of those Seven Seals it was hid now if children has come up under that kind under that kind of a teaching that's what their parents was they have the nature of their parents now let me pause to this because somebody might want to be critical and said well you know he talked about the serpent seed before the seals were open or what we thought y'all understand what I'm saying see because you might be dealing with time but God deals with eternity Hallelujah now you got to understand this the prophet of God said he said Moses and Elijah is the Sixth Seal and if he if they were the Sixth Seal then who is the seventh see because you said well Jesus Christ is the seventh yes Jesus Christ with the six but he needed a man amen hallelujah so he was the Visible man because he was the opening oh the opening came by waying through him amen now I'm telling you this because a lot of us you don't want to believe it but yes Christ is but you see who was able to enter seduce Christ we wouldn't have never known that the same anointing that falls on us is the same anointing that falls on denominationalism he said but the rain falls on the just and the unjust and he comes and he tells us of the seed what seed you are why you can't do this and why you can't do that because what's there come on somebody we wouldn't have never known that but then he goes on and talks about now if you under this now he talks about the seventh seal this is good to me it was here now if children has come up under that kind see under that kind of teaching that's what their parents was they have the nature of their parents the denominations and so forth they have to believe that see they believe that they they believe that because they're born under the p that parent but today we're not born under that parent amen our parent is the Worden that's my punchline Hallelujah that's my punchline because if our parent is the word the only thing that the word can beget is the word amen amen see and the world see I was born under God too so if I was born under God and you born under God then I parent is the word amen so how can we be Flawless H unlaw put it that way we we're not talking about this now amen but the perfect man must be made perfect amen because this man that's on the inside is created and made by the word amen amen amen now there has to come forth must come forth God orain see there had to come forth must come forth God ordain it so that there must come forth the Seven Seals must be open it was supposed to be done in this Ley and age and I think Beyond any doubt a Shadow of Doubt now I just stopped right there but he's saying things and if you're not understanding he it it'll bring a confusion to you because amen you got to realize amen this was done in 65 the SE were open 1962 brother random said the birth of an infant bride 1963 he said the heralding of the birth of an infant bride y'all hear what I'm saying the Stars declared Jesus's birth the SC the Stars declared Miss Jesus's birth amen y'all hear what I'm saying and now how many years now 50 years now come on how long it's going to take for us to mature come on then the word of God comes and brother brand said you know the bride is what he's he gives her stage in life she's green he says at that time she was green the life is there but she's green she's got to lay in the presence of the son and be ripened amen hallelujah so it ain't if the bride is coming she's here amen and don't you think if she was Green in the 60s she ought to be about right but now something got to be turning in your heart and if it's not turning in your heart you better get to somebody's altar amen you better get down somewhere amen because the life is changing us now Hallelujah the last part to change is your body amen but that inward man is changing right now it's growing it's maturing and he talks about a True Believer he said they come back to the word that's what makes them a Believer amen they might strive but they come back to the word hallelujah amen hallelujah is that all right amen see how the serpent seed went off into science education cities and music and great things and education and Science and so forth but the seed of the righteous ones he said they come back to the word and he explains that Eve doesn't have a seat and of course there's a lot more other stuff in there but um by the grace of God while science is working in in it in its greatness there's a little simple Kingdom that's working in its greatness Hallelujah come on somebody and that little kingdom amen is the kingdom of God and that Kingdom is a faith civilization amen let's stand I'm that's where I'm going to stop because it's the inside that God is hearing and seeing you know it's what you really what's really happening in your heart is what God is judging you know and I'm going to say this by the grace of God people of God we must understand by the grace of God that God is trying to get something over to us and I'm going to tell you what it is your thoughts have not been right our thoughts have not been right can I include myself and if God is saying that that means he's saying you got to wash it stop thinking like men and start thinking like Gods amen now if he's the head and I'm his body you don't you know that means when you call me Jesus or when you call me Isaiah you calling all of this you see all of this all of this not just my head you seeing all is is is me y'all know what I'm saying if I'm the body of Christ then when you call on it him It's All of Me Amen brother Randon was late for a flight he was running trying to get on it God says keep walking let me ask you that this how many of us would have done it yeah see that's how in tune he was to the voice of God keep walking he could care less about his plane at the time he heard his voice a sheep hears his voice you keep walking right now he's going and you've heard me say this a many times he's going into a bad neighborhood did y'all know that brother bam was going into a bad neighborhood or what was considered a bad neighborhood in the dark and now he's singing amen I'm so glad to see say I'm one of them whatever his feelings were wherever his thoughts were only God knows but all I know is the man began to sing I'm so glad to say that I'm one of them he sees this auntie amen this auntie amen laying over across the fence like that oh I can Envision her I can see her right now rag around her head come on somebody amen yes sir and he's walking by and she said good morning Parson now listen she didn't doubt what she had seen God by thought or Vision however you want to put it by dream cuz she was praying right and God drops this thing in on her and she believed it y amen and she so believed it she got off her knees and stood there doesn't say how long she was there but the Bible the brother said D was on her back amen so she been there a while am and she knew he was coming amen that's what she said I know you was coming I like that I like that English amen he said how you know I'm aost you see what I'm saying God thoughts meeting together something got to happen when I'm nipotent meets unip something has to happen and we looking at this thing God trying to talk to us and we said you know how many times you've called the thought of God the devil and you done the wrong thing and then you realize it was the right thing to do cuz you wasn't in tune with God y'all hear what I'm saying you wasn't in tune with God and then what God does he comes right around and and this this this young man was think about it he said oh he said he had her pray and he knew she had me been with God before she knew how to pray yes amen she didn't stutter she knew who she was talking to wasn't no rosaries or some Cross or something she knew she was talking to God Amen y'all hear what I'm saying now if that woman way back then can be so in tune with God what about us amen and she was in the Pentecostal age amen what about you what about me amen and and the the saddest thing is we don't even know the we don't know the connections we don't know here it is science has told you in order for me to you know I got a cell phone now and I can call Brother Isaac brother Keith or you know but I've got to get on that I mean here I am right and if they're at home and I'm here you know I can scream all I want to and can't but there's a number I can die that are connect right up to you come on somebody supernaturally in a moment's time they ring and I can hear your voice and while I'm talking I can almost see you brother because I know how you look y'all know what I'm saying so is it with God you hit the right channel it rings up Heaven God talks and you talk amen the natural types is spiritual right you want to talk to God sometime amen you know a lot of time we don't want to talk to God till we need something sometime we call each other because we just want to hear each other voice I call my I say I just want to make some connections want to see how you're doing you're doing okay you know that kind of a thing we don't have to call God what you just think he's a grocery store Aaron boy y'all hear what I'm saying you know how children do their parents but my point is this people of God it's got to get closer it's got to get more sincere and you got to start watching everything you say up there yes amen the Holy Ghost in you if real Holy Ghost it'll check you when you're wrong yes amen it'll make you repent it'll make you confess Hallelujah if you're a true seed of God soon as something this old flesh get out of line that Holy Spirit will make you do it just right there I heard somebody say to me one time all you do man all you do is say I'm sorry I'm sorry you I'm wrong on this I'm wrong on that I ain't nobody going to trust your ministry I said you know what I said that's true I said but God I don't have a Ministry it's his ministry and my point point is to keep it right amen and if I find myself off on something then I'm supposed to make it right oh but what about what I don't care what you think about me judgment starts at the house of God Amen in here this where my judgment starts in here so you look at this thing you say well brother you know let me tell you something there's going to be so many people standing at the white Throne judgment because they was concerned about what somebody else thought about them people this relationship is between you and God Amen you and God Alone amen and let me say it like this is between you and God so why should you care about what other people think about you you got to get closer to God you got to see God for yourself think about it you can die or fall dead right now am and if it was to happen how many of us would be ready right now think about it what were you thinking before you got here and what you thinking while you've been here amen amen people are so reled religious you know they religious they they they looking at everything and I'm going to tell you something you know one thing I I tell you truth I I do I get so zerious for God sometime I've seen people go places and games and everything else and they can make all kind of noise and then when they get in the house of God they're so silent y'all have more noise out there than you have in here and God is talking to you but he can't hear you I mean you ain't saying nothing you know my my point is what is it that makes people do that makes makes them uh do what they do when it comes to God and that they can talk to any and everybody and and they can all everywhere games and wherever else you go I I don't understand I'm I'm so confused at that you know and I do I do understand some people you know sometime you have to listen real close to understand but those of us amen who can understand there's no excuse when you're not responding back to God he didn't give your lips there to stay still there lips he gave them lips sacrifice of praise supposed to come through your lips he likes he can hear from the heart but he likes them lips that's why he oh Lord help us Jesus help us Jesus help us you love love the Lord you love the Lord when we see what God is doing oh I wish I could I tell you what I just know where I'm going I know where I'm going you know I fear no one and nothing but God that's where I'm at in my life and when it comes down to to us as individuals you got to know God for yourself I went to a church and I'm closing I said people really believe that be still when I say believe it they look at it be still and know I'm God if that be the case if that's the kind of Silence that God wanted you would have never heard nothing on those tapes that brother Brandon would have made him be still and I tell you what I get so spiritually jealous sometimes when I can hear all that worship and praising and amen and on those tapes and then I come to a church that's supposed to be living see you can't shout if you ain't got no Victory you can't praise God if you ain't got no Victory but if you got Victory it's going to come out it's going to show by the grace of God you said well listen I'm going to tell you something a sinner can praise God huh y'all yes Sinners praise God a sinner can't worship him cuz you got to worship Him in spirit and truth but the Bible said let every breath have that everything that have breath praise God brother said when that aost was was healed she looked back as to say thank you sir anyway you love the Lord let's pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love we thank you for everything you've done for us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves without you lord Jesus we are nothing and Lord we're gracious to you let
