[0:00] amen I won't even attempt to uh follow
[0:03] behind that amen we'll get through the
[0:06] preaching and we'll get some more of
[0:07] that singing how about that amen I tell
[0:10] you it's a thrill for me to be here
[0:13] today and to have my wife with me and my
[0:16] friends brother Dave and sister Sharon
[0:17] bratus and uh they've been friends from
[0:21] way back old
[0:22] friends amen I've known them probably
[0:24] pushing 20 years now and they've
[0:26] actually known brother Brooks longer
[0:27] than that and so we snuck them out here
[0:30] and brother Isaiah knew I was bringing
[0:31] some old friends he wasn't sure who it
[0:33] was so we were happy to amen surprise
[0:36] him amen there's no friends you know you
[0:38] can make new friends brother Bram said
[0:39] but there's nothing like old friends
[0:42] amen but I'm happy to be with all of you
[0:44] my old friends from eternity amen
[0:47] hallelujah amen amen I tell you we had a
[0:50] a place in the mind of God long before
[0:51] we were ever in this place amen and I
[0:54] just appreciate that in the Lord and uh
[0:57] I I'll give you a secret confession I've
[0:59] always wanted to come here and uh I've
[1:02] always known brother Brooks was uh in
[1:04] Iowa and I've always coveted an
[1:06] invitation and just waited on the Lord
[1:08] to do it and so amen I was real thrilled
[1:11] amen I didn't have to pray much when he
[1:13] asked
[1:15] me amen because it was uh it was
[1:18] something I'd wanted to do for a long
[1:19] time love brother isai have known him
[1:21] from long time known him uh brother
[1:24] Isaiah has I don't know how y'all out
[1:26] here in Iowa understand it but he has
[1:28] quite a name among the Saints where I
[1:30] come from around North Carolina where I
[1:32] was raised brother Brooks was almost
[1:34] like a superstar amen and we uh even to
[1:37] this day even down in South Carolina all
[1:39] the saints know him and love him so I
[1:41] told him uh he was asking me yesterday
[1:43] about next time we come out I said NE
[1:46] wait next time first there's going to be
[1:48] a you coming to South Carolina before we
[1:52] next time come back here so if y'all
[1:54] don't mind we're probably going to
[1:56] Barrow him sometime early part of next
[1:58] year amen we have to ask is boss Lord
[2:00] will let him on alone amen servant of
[2:02] the Lord don't get to choose that amen
[2:05] amen he he's not even supposed to try
[2:07] now see y'all don't imagine that kind of
[2:09] a life as as as just leoty as just you
[2:12] know Christians you just love God be
[2:14] humble serve the Lord God's got a
[2:16] Rapture building and uh that's what
[2:19] brother Bram said said just go on serve
[2:20] the Lord be humble when the Lord's ready
[2:22] for you to know something he'll make
[2:23] sure but you know his servants are in a
[2:25] completely different category they don't
[2:28] they don't get to make any choices you
[2:30] can put do choose whatever you want you
[2:33] can live wherever you want do whatever
[2:34] you want be whatever you want a servant
[2:37] of the Lord can't make any of that he
[2:38] don't get to decide where he lives he
[2:41] don't get to decide what he does amen he
[2:42] don't even get to decide what he says
[2:44] amen he don't get to decide what to
[2:46] preach he don't get to decide how to act
[2:49] or even how to react he's a slave to the
[2:52] Lord Jesus Christ amen and the shest
[2:55] quickest way for him to get in trouble
[2:57] is to start calling his own shots so I
[2:59] app appreciate brother Isaiah he was
[3:01] willing to come out here and serve the
[3:03] Lord in his Vineyard and it's a
[3:05] beautiful place I can see why he come
[3:07] amen it's been beautiful we've been
[3:09] driving around and having a lovely
[3:11] lovely lovely time so I appreciate all
[3:14] that singing I was thinking man who
[3:15] needs instruments amen when you got that
[3:17] kind of singing so you're a lovely group
[3:19] of people and uh just greet you in the
[3:22] name of the Lord from my home Church uh
[3:24] in Buford South Carolina I'm the
[3:27] assistant pastor there and uh some years
[3:29] ago I used to be the pastor and some
[3:31] years ago I resigned and the church
[3:33] elected Jesus as the pastor and so now
[3:36] I'm just on my office I told the
[3:38] trustees I said get me a new sign I said
[3:41] I got to have one that says Jason
[3:42] Watkins assistant pastor and they
[3:44] thought I was kidding I come back a
[3:46] couple weeks later I said Hey where's my
[3:47] sign they said were you serious I said
[3:50] of course I was serious so now if you
[3:53] come visit me I have a sign on my door
[3:55] says Jason Watkins assistant pastor and
[3:57] I'm just the Lord's assistant amen amen
[4:00] so that's all we're going to try to do
[4:02] today and it's a Sunday and so I uh
[4:05] brother Brooks told me I could just
[4:06] relax and be myself amen amen so we're
[4:09] just going to try to look into the word
[4:10] of God Matthew chapter 6 while you're
[4:13] standing so I don't keep you standing
[4:14] too long we've got another service in
[4:16] the afternoon so I'm going to divide
[4:18] this sermon into two parts and uh we're
[4:21] not going to weary you today we'll go so
[4:23] long I got a segmented portion I'll a
[4:25] lot myself and be real studious and then
[4:28] we'll hit a pause button and and then
[4:30] we'll uh pick it back up in the
[4:31] afternoon service so make sure you come
[4:33] back for round
[4:34] two amen I tell you you you know uh the
[4:38] Lord is good and it's good to be in the
[4:41] house of God Amen and uh you know I here
[4:44] recently I we had a really bunch of nice
[4:47] set of meetings and and we had a really
[4:49] nice men's meeting and my my my got home
[4:52] my wife asked me she said well she said
[4:54] you have a good turnout I said oh yeah
[4:56] fantastic I said most every brother was
[4:58] there she saidwell most he said who was
[5:00] and I saidwell there was two or three
[5:02] that would didn't make it she said uh
[5:05] she said uh why didn't they come I said
[5:07] well I know exactly why they didn't come
[5:10] now it's probably not the reason they
[5:12] think they probably got some other
[5:14] perfectly to them legitimate reason
[5:16] something I had to do I had to do this I
[5:18] had to do that not even implying
[5:20] anything you know bad uh I said but but
[5:23] the real reason I said there's a certain
[5:27] brother and another certain brother and
[5:28] another certain brother and she said
[5:29] well why wasn't that brother there and I
[5:31] said well because the reason he wasn't
[5:33] there is cuz he needed it the
[5:36] most and that's why and the devil knew
[5:39] that and the devil just ran something in
[5:41] front of him he said well I guess I need
[5:42] to do that I guess I won't go she said
[5:44] what about the second I said he needed
[5:46] it the second worst and then the other
[5:48] one needed it the third worst and that's
[5:50] why they weren't there amen amen cuz see
[5:52] the devil is smart you know you yeah you
[5:55] don't try to match wits with him you
[5:57] just want to stand on a revelation amen
[6:00] praise the Lord so don't let anything
[6:02] deter you amen so uh we we we're going
[6:06] to look at this thought and spread it
[6:07] into two parts and the second part is is
[6:10] as important maybe more so probably I
[6:12] would say part two would be more
[6:14] important to Believers than part one
[6:16] will be although that might that might
[6:19] change as we get going we'll see how the
[6:20] Lord because I don't know it's just up
[6:22] to the Lord amen but I know this is what
[6:24] he wanted me to take and I've take part
[6:27] of this material at home I haven't got
[6:28] to take all of it that I'll cover in
[6:30] both parts uh probably go back home and
[6:34] finish up uh so we'll get into some
[6:36] fresh stuff here maybe in the afternoon
[6:38] service all right Matthew chapter 6 uh
[6:40] let me just read a few quick verses here
[6:42] and we'll let you be seated let's catch
[6:45] verse Matthew chapter 6 verse 22 and
[6:50] 23 verse 22 the light of the body is the
[6:55] eye if therefore thine eye be single thy
[6:58] whole body shall be full of light but if
[7:02] thine eye be evil thy whole body shall
[7:05] be full of Darkness if therefore the
[7:09] light that is in thee be Darkness how
[7:12] great is that Darkness let's
[7:18] pray well lord it's so good to be here
[7:23] and I thank you for life liberty and the
[7:27] pursuit of thy kingdom Lord Lord I I
[7:31] I've I've just followed you out here
[7:33] Lord that's all I've done I there's
[7:35] nothing special about the man it's you
[7:38] Lord that's the great one Among Us and I
[7:42] I've just followed you up here behind
[7:44] this desk and you're the speaker I'm
[7:45] just here to assist you Lord that's all
[7:47] I'm that's all I'm here for that's all
[7:49] my part is I'm just here to assist you
[7:52] whatever you want to say now Lord we
[7:54] humble ourselves and we uh we the Bible
[7:57] tells us to Humble thyself
[8:00] so we do that Lord we I bring myself
[8:03] into sincerity now before you for we
[8:06] must be very sincere Lord now take your
[8:09] word and break it to the people Lord
[8:12] feed it to us as the bread of life we
[8:15] commit it now to you Lord I Have No
[8:18] Agenda Lord truth Has No Agenda Lord
[8:21] It's just full of love and it just wants
[8:23] to help but it has truth that's that's
[8:25] the wonderful thing about real truth is
[8:29] that it has no agenda of its own it just
[8:32] it's just a it just is a tool in the
[8:34] hand of God so Lord I I I don't know any
[8:39] of these people I know perhaps the
[8:41] pastor and his family in a small way but
[8:44] Lord I'm just here to be your assistant
[8:46] now so it's committed to you Lord we
[8:49] commit it to you in Jesus name amen
[8:52] praise God you can be seated friends God
[8:54] bless you
[9:01] amen
[9:02] now I I I want to by the help of the
[9:05] Lord uh we will go in just a few moments
[9:09] and we will read where we read from
[9:12] Matthew but we're going to take uh
[9:15] Luke's version of it that goes into a
[9:17] little bit more detail and will help
[9:19] illustrate the point that I want to make
[9:21] today now if you're while you're but
[9:23] I'll get to that shortly while you're
[9:25] seated if you'll turn with me to the
[9:26] Book of James chapter 1
[9:30] and I want to just read uh a few uh
[9:34] maybe one verse here and then we'll
[9:36] catch some others and we're going to put
[9:37] up a a PowerPoint slide just in a moment
[9:40] and I'm assuming we have that brother
[9:42] it's all going to work fine okay good
[9:44] we'll get to that just in a moment let
[9:46] me read this verse and then we'll put up
[9:48] the title
[9:52] screen James chapter
[9:56] 1 and let's begin reading
[10:01] reading in verse two let's just begin at
[10:05] verse one James a servant of God and of
[10:08] the Lord Jesus Christ to the TW tribes
[10:10] which are scattered abroad greeting my
[10:14] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[10:17] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[10:20] that the trying of your faith worketh
[10:23] patience but let patience have her
[10:26] perfect work isn't it amazing the the
[10:28] apostle has to tell you to do that so
[10:31] he's saying he's giving you what a
[10:33] benefit it is for to to have patience
[10:36] but he he's he's describing that
[10:38] patience has a work to do it's not just
[10:41] a a a a feeling of contentment it's an
[10:44] actual uh something that comes from God
[10:47] that he's using in your life and it has
[10:50] to be
[10:51] exercised like faith has to be exerc
[10:53] remember these things are tangible
[10:55] elements now maybe not in this realm but
[10:57] like faith is a sub
[11:00] faith is a substance faith is not just a
[11:02] figment of your thought see there is a
[11:05] human faith that is the right mental
[11:07] attitude toward every promise of God
[11:09] Amen but faith is the mind of Christ
[11:11] perfect Faith you understand so it's not
[11:14] something new perfect Faith isn't some
[11:15] new doctrin amen it's not some new
[11:18] teaching the the we've had perfect Faith
[11:21] Fai perfect faith is in the atonement
[11:22] it's in Salvation it's what saved you
[11:25] you say well but what about the
[11:26] operation of the things that we we
[11:28] believe that the should be doing only
[11:30] thing that's had God hasn't brought had
[11:32] to bring us a new doctrine that's right
[11:34] the only thing that's had to happen is
[11:35] for 50 years we've been maturing and
[11:37] growing and laying in the presence of
[11:38] the Sun and so it's the it's the body of
[11:41] Christ that's been the one changing
[11:43] perfect faith has always been there
[11:45] ready to use you understand so it it's
[11:48] all based on your spiritual maturity
[11:51] don't get it in your mind God's got a
[11:54] something he's got to bring some great
[11:55] anointing some super Faith some new
[11:57] teaching that's right it's right here
[12:00] right now there's nothing else coming
[12:02] God just needs you to prepare yourself
[12:05] and slip into that channel and it works
[12:07] yes sir amen see it works works it works
[12:11] uh it's working overtime I can tell you
[12:13] that right now uh and and and it's
[12:16] working all over the world so you know
[12:19] don't be looking for some pie in the sky
[12:21] somewhere now is the time you know be
[12:24] about the father's business you're fully
[12:26] equipped am you're fully anointed am
[12:29] prophet of God said when the when the
[12:31] word of God is open for any age he said
[12:33] an anointing comes down and anoints that
[12:35] word for the hour see so we're not I
[12:38] don't need to wait on something it's
[12:40] here Among Us it's just our sincerity
[12:43] before God our dedication and I tell you
[12:46] it's our separateness from the world and
[12:48] this world is all about blending
[12:50] everything together and the holy
[12:51] spirit's all about separation you know
[12:53] be a separate sayith the Lord all right
[12:57] how'd I get on that so but he wants you
[13:00] to let it have its he has to tell you
[13:03] let it let it have its work in you
[13:07] because you I want to I want to really
[13:10] get this across to you today how much
[13:12] your human element is involved in this
[13:15] because Paul says in the book of
[13:17] Philippians it's amazing he says it just
[13:20] like James let this mind which was in
[13:23] Christ am in other words allow it from
[13:26] the Greek it means to permit you have to
[13:28] do that am see he says to the Colossians
[13:31] in the third chapter let the word of God
[13:34] dwell in you richly see you have to
[13:38] allow that you have to permit that Jesus
[13:40] is a gentleman he's not going to come in
[13:42] and force it upon you I want to today
[13:45] say Lord humble me and that I may let
[13:47] the mind which was in Christ work in me
[13:51] that I that the word that is in me May
[13:53] dwell in me richly see so it's not you
[13:58] know Paul said to the to the
[14:00] Thessalonians uh speaking to speaking to
[14:03] people who had been born again and
[14:05] filled with the Holy Ghost for probably
[14:07] many many many years and yet Paul is
[14:09] saying to them I want you to know all
[14:11] the mystery and all the fullness that
[14:13] you be filled with all the fullness amen
[14:16] they had already been born again for
[14:17] many many years so there's always this
[14:20] this thing of of adding to your faith
[14:23] and growing and you'll you'll succeed if
[14:26] you faint not amen so Paul said I'll
[14:28] have no pleasure to those who draw back
[14:30] it's pressed forward toward the mark
[14:33] don't stop pressing you mustn't stand
[14:36] still you mustn't stand still because if
[14:38] you stand still you slide
[14:41] backwards see all right I'm almost
[14:43] getting into tonight's the afternoon
[14:45] service this morning all right so we're
[14:48] just trying to uh find follow the mind
[14:50] of the Lord but I know he's got a
[14:51] structure to it so let me let me be a
[14:53] little more careful here all right so if
[14:58] any watch this verse four again but let
[15:00] patience have her perfect work that you
[15:03] may be perfect and entire wanting
[15:05] nothing so you people say why can't I
[15:08] get to that Perfection well you got to
[15:10] you got to let something happen yes see
[15:13] amen if any of you lack wisdom these are
[15:17] Christians see these are born again
[15:19] people if any of you lack wisdom let him
[15:22] ask of God that giveth to all men
[15:24] liberally and up Brath not and it shall
[15:26] be given him now watch him CAU verse six
[15:30] but let him ask in faith nothing
[15:33] wavering see now this is going to go
[15:36] down into the area of if our heart
[15:37] condemns us but if our heart condemns us
[15:41] not then we can have faith towards God
[15:43] see for he that wavereth now he's going
[15:46] to speak about an unconverted person for
[15:49] he that wavereth is like a wave of the
[15:52] sea driven with the wind and tossed for
[15:55] let not that man see that unconverted
[15:57] man who wavereth he doesn't even have
[16:00] faith see let not that man think that he
[16:03] shall receive anything of the Lord watch
[16:06] verse eight a double-minded man is
[16:10] unstable in
[16:14] all his business his marriage his
[16:19] Parenthood his relationships his
[16:21] friendships his finances his
[16:24] character his career his his church
[16:28] attendance his prayer life his witness a
[16:31] double-minded man is unstable in all the
[16:35] circle of life around
[16:37] him
[16:39] see now all right let's put up our title
[16:43] slide
[16:44] brother and if this works and if it
[16:46] doesn't I told him if it doesn't work
[16:47] that's fine we'll go without it now I I
[16:51] am on purpose chose me and I thought
[16:53] that's better than using any of
[16:57] you the double mind Ed man it's amazing
[17:00] you'd say you know what's the difference
[17:02] between those two photographs well you
[17:03] could not you could not tell the
[17:05] difference looking at it that's just
[17:06] trick photography it's actually the same
[17:08] image divided and brought together so
[17:11] while no matter what you think that
[17:13] that's the identical same image both of
[17:15] those are the same there's no
[17:16] discernable difference that you can
[17:18] actually see see and a lot of times uh a
[17:21] lot of times it's not hard to really
[17:23] look like a born again Christian and on
[17:26] the outside you almost can't tell the
[17:28] difference say man I know that brother I
[17:30] know that sister and then a little while
[17:32] down the road you'll find out that even
[17:34] they didn't have what they thought they
[17:35] had amen see so now next slide we take
[17:40] this scripture and I want to zero in on
[17:43] James CH 1 ver8 a double-minded man is
[17:48] unstable in all of his ways now clearly
[17:52] here is a prerequisite to eternal life
[17:54] next slide Jesus speaking from John
[17:57] chapter 3 Jesus answered and said unto
[18:00] him verily verily I say unto thee except
[18:02] a man be born again he cannot see the
[18:05] kingdom of God see now that that's
[18:08] exactly why uh you know no man speaking
[18:13] by the spirit calleth Jesus a cursed
[18:16] that's right amen so there it's
[18:17] impossible then to look at any truth in
[18:21] God's word and say I am born again but
[18:25] then deny the word because you cannot
[18:28] separate Christ from his word see now
[18:31] the devil wants to do that that's that's
[18:34] why in the early church history the very
[18:38] first heresy the very first thing that
[18:41] that Satan attacked the church with was
[18:44] to was to mystify the relationship
[18:48] between Christ and the father and that's
[18:51] the very first thing he be to attack and
[18:54] and even that's where John says the
[18:56] spirit of antichrist is already at work
[18:58] in the Church see and that's why he
[19:00] would say anyone that will not that will
[19:03] not confess uh what Jesus really is is
[19:06] the
[19:06] Antichrist that he's come in the flesh
[19:09] and that's an antichrist see he was
[19:12] contending with gnosticism which began
[19:14] to Cloud that relationship because the
[19:17] devil knew that if you can't if you
[19:19] don't really understand the relationship
[19:21] that Jesus as a man had to God if you
[19:25] don't understand his relationship to the
[19:27] father you can't really really quite
[19:29] understand your relationship to the
[19:32] father so you understand Jesus was the
[19:35] first born among many Brethren so
[19:37] there's a pattern to be seen he's the
[19:39] beginning of a new
[19:41] creation all right so now so now we and
[19:45] I'm not going in that direction today
[19:47] whatever uh but I but I just want to to
[19:50] establish that you know you you you
[19:53] you've got to be born again when the
[19:56] when or you can't see the things of God
[19:58] that's what Jesus is saying to to a
[20:00] scholar he's speaking here to Nicodemus
[20:02] who's a scholar when the Greek
[20:04] philosophers came and they said to to
[20:08] the one disciple I think to Andrew or to
[20:09] philli and he says sir we would see
[20:12] Jesus and Philip tth Andrew and they go
[20:14] and tell the Lord know Lord here's some
[20:16] here's some Greeks come here Lord these
[20:18] Greeks they want to they want to see you
[20:20] and it's amazing that Jesus his
[20:24] reply doesn't even make sense it's like
[20:28] did he not just hear what someone said
[20:29] to him here's these Greeks they want to
[20:32] see you and Jesus looks at him and says
[20:34] except a corn of wheat died abideth
[20:38] alone what what what's that supposed to
[20:41] mean what Jesus is trying to get them to
[20:44] understand you're here to see me but
[20:46] unless you die and are born again you
[20:48] really can't see
[20:50] me see you're looking at me you think
[20:53] you see me but really unless you come
[20:56] through regeneration you really can't
[20:57] see me amen you're here in wisdom and
[21:01] you're trying to see me in wisdom and
[21:02] I'm giving you the first principle
[21:04] except the corn of wheat die it is
[21:05] abideth alone see and so you you've got
[21:10] to die and be reborn and then you can
[21:13] see Jesus Christ so you know we people
[21:17] and today oh it's such a fondness uh
[21:19] ever you know various people in the
[21:22] denominational world or the Evangelical
[21:25] or the charismatic you know it it's all
[21:27] about well you know I I love Jesus you
[21:30] know I don't need a message I just want
[21:32] Jesus and I said well you know there's
[21:33] no difference between Jesus and his word
[21:35] amen it's all the same thing say well
[21:39] you know I just want Jesus and I say
[21:41] well which
[21:42] one and they say well there's only one I
[21:45] said not according to St Paul St Paul
[21:47] spoke of another Jesus that would come
[21:51] and and this other Jesus would be
[21:53] worshiped like the real one that's right
[21:55] but actually Paul was showing them that
[21:57] he would be a false
[21:59] representation it'd be a watered down
[22:01] gospel a compromised truth and it would
[22:03] be mixed with man-made Theory and it'd
[22:05] be a false
[22:07] Jesus see so you got to make sure you've
[22:11] got the right Jesus and the only right
[22:12] one is the one of the word am
[22:16] Hallelujah so you can't make any claim
[22:19] to Jesus nor can you hold him
[22:21] responsible to give you eternal life if
[22:23] you refuse his word per I don't care
[22:26] what you have accepted historically I
[22:28] don't don't care what your mind you
[22:29] might have accepted that historical
[22:30] figure that died 20 centuries ago you
[22:33] might accept that and say I know he was
[22:35] the son of God well so do the
[22:38] devil see I know he died and Rose so
[22:41] does the devil see but there's got to be
[22:44] you've got to know the Jesus today
[22:46] because that same Jesus is alive today
[22:49] in his word and that's why this same
[22:52] this same Apostle James would say if we
[22:54] walk in the light
[22:56] as he's in the light amen
[22:59] see then then the then we we have
[23:02] Fellowship one with another and the
[23:04] blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin
[23:09] now so it's a it's a prerequisite now I
[23:12] want to I want you to think about this
[23:14] double-minded man because I'm suggesting
[23:17] to you today we're going to first look
[23:18] at him in a way of being
[23:20] unconverted and then we're going to look
[23:22] at a version of a double-minded man who
[23:24] is actually born again but he's got a
[23:26] he's got some issues and that's where
[23:28] we'll get to in the afternoon perhaps so
[23:31] today let's look at the unconverted and
[23:33] I want to make this uh very very clear
[23:36] and established you know so that you
[23:38] know where you stand amen all right and
[23:40] and you can identify Yourself by the
[23:42] word of God now let's go to where uh
[23:45] Simon Peter uh speaks of what Jesus is
[23:48] saying here in John 3 Simon Peter picks
[23:51] up in second Peter a servant and Apostle
[23:54] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[23:57] obtained like Precious Faith with us
[24:00] through the righteousness of God and our
[24:02] Savior Jesus Christ so it's very clear
[24:04] he's talking to born- again people amen
[24:06] amen next watch what he says to Born
[24:08] Again people giving all diligence add to
[24:12] your faith see that faith that
[24:14] Revelation that bought you and changed
[24:16] you am add to that now here's what
[24:19] happens when you don't add and when you
[24:21] don't grow and when you don't mature
[24:24] remember he would go on to say uh yeah
[24:27] we have it in verse 10 so walk down
[24:29] verse n but he that lackthe things what
[24:33] that virtue that knowledge that
[24:35] Temperance that meekness amen that love
[24:38] that you were supposed to work onen God
[24:40] didn't bring you and save you the Lord
[24:43] Jesus didn't find you at an altar and
[24:45] save you and say okay you're saved see
[24:48] you in heaven no no see you on the other
[24:52] side no he's got a job for you to do
[24:55] he's trying to equip you you're here for
[24:57] a purpose everything God does is Purpose
[25:03] Driven there's a purpose behind it but
[25:07] he he look at this believer that lackthe
[25:09] things he's blind cannot see a far off
[25:12] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[25:14] from his old sins it's not an
[25:16] unconverted man it's a man who hasn't
[25:19] been diligent watch wherefore the rather
[25:22] look who he says
[25:24] Brethren he's speaking to Brethren
[25:26] wherefore the rather brethren give
[25:28] diligence that's the problem give
[25:31] diligence to make your calling and
[25:33] election sure for if you do these things
[25:36] what adding to your faith adding to your
[25:38] virtue adding to knowledge if you do
[25:40] these things you shall never
[25:43] fall so an entrance will be ministered
[25:45] to you he goes on to say see so so
[25:49] remember making your calling and
[25:51] election sure is found in second Peter
[25:54] not Acts chapter 2 it's not about your
[25:57] new birth it's in second Peter chapter 2
[25:59] it's about your
[26:01] maturity amen all right all right let's
[26:04] look uh and beside go on down uh let's
[26:07] look at Paul uh saying the same thing in
[26:09] Galatians 2 I am crucified with Christ
[26:14] nevertheless I live it's an amazing
[26:17] statement nevertheless I I'm crucified
[26:20] but I'm alive I live but actually not I
[26:24] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[26:27] which I now live In the Flesh in the
[26:29] flesh as a man I'm not glorified yet but
[26:33] the life I live in the flesh I live not
[26:37] not in faith in the Son of God but by
[26:39] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[26:43] and gave himself for me in other words I
[26:45] have his life I live it I have his life
[26:48] in me I have the faith of the Son of God
[26:52] the faith of the Son of God is the life
[26:54] of
[26:56] God watch him go on and Ephesians
[26:58] chapter 3 next
[27:00] slide that he would Grant here's what I
[27:03] was referring to I think I said
[27:05] Thessalonians uh it's actually Ephesians
[27:08] that he would Grant you according to the
[27:10] riches of his glory see according to the
[27:14] according to how much money he's got in
[27:15] the bank he that you be strengthened
[27:18] with might now he's got a quite a big
[27:21] bank account amen according to his
[27:23] riches and Glory I'm going to tell you
[27:26] that's why Jesus could say and if you
[27:28] could accept it nothing shall be
[27:30] impossible to you hallelujah
[27:33] hallelujah to be strengthened with might
[27:36] by his spirit in the Inner Man his
[27:39] spirit in the Inner Man his spirit in
[27:41] the inner man that Christ May dwell in
[27:44] your hearts by faith that ye you born
[27:48] again people you're already Born Again
[27:50] by the Holy Ghost being rooted and
[27:52] grounded in love may be able to
[27:55] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[27:58] breadth and length and depth and height
[28:00] and to know the love of Christ which
[28:02] passeth knowledge that ye might be
[28:05] filled with all the fullness of
[28:10] God so you know it's not just you were
[28:13] born again now it's time to grow it's
[28:15] time to mature because God is looking
[28:18] for a church in Victory now here's the
[28:21] problem that we come back to next slide
[28:24] actually go to go to the next one here
[28:27] we come back to do it again here's the
[28:29] original warning a double-minded man is
[28:33] unstable a double-minded man is the
[28:35] opposite of everything we just read amen
[28:37] see there's no faith there's no strength
[28:39] there's no Victory there's no fullness
[28:41] there's no overcoming he can't really
[28:43] get going because he's really never got
[28:46] started yeah you see so he just goes in
[28:49] circles now watch what James goes on to
[28:53] describe this man again lest you wonder
[28:56] is there an application to it of of of
[28:58] the unredeemed here's his further
[29:00] application in James
[29:02] 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses so I'm
[29:06] guessing this is UN unborn this is not
[29:08] born again again people he adulterers
[29:11] and adulteresses know you not that the
[29:14] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[29:17] God it's a good question would you say
[29:20] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[29:22] the world is the enemy of God yes sir do
[29:25] you think that the scripture saith in
[29:27] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us
[29:29] lusteth to Envy but he giveth more grace
[29:33] wherefore he saith God resisteth the
[29:36] proud but giveth grace to the humble
[29:38] look what he says here's the command
[29:41] submit yourselves therefore to God see
[29:45] he's speaking to adulterers and
[29:46] adulteresses this is who Peter was
[29:48] speaking to and he said repent amen
[29:51] repent he says James says submit
[29:53] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[29:56] devil and he will flee from you draw
[29:58] nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you
[30:02] cleanse your hands you Sinners and
[30:05] purify your hearts you're
[30:09] double-minded this is what Peter said
[30:11] repent it means turn around go the other
[30:14] way amen
[30:16] see uh now watch what Peter comes back
[30:19] to again Peter's going to call them
[30:20] unstable souls in the next
[30:23] slide and shall receive the reward of
[30:26] unrighteousness as they that count it
[30:28] pleasure to write in the daytime spots
[30:31] they are and blemishes sporting
[30:33] themselves with their own deceiving
[30:34] while they Feast with you having eyes
[30:37] full of adultery that cannot cease from
[30:40] sin beguiling unstable Souls see James
[30:45] calls him an unstable man Peter calls
[30:48] him an unstable Soul a heart that have a
[30:53] heart that have exercised they have
[30:55] exercised with Covetous practice is
[30:58] cursed children which have forsaken the
[31:01] right way and are gone astray following
[31:05] the way of balum the son of Boer who
[31:07] loved the wages of
[31:10] unrighteousness so I think we're drawing
[31:12] a picture for you today all right now
[31:16] let's look at this next slide for its
[31:18] terminology the
[31:20] double-minded all right so dius is the
[31:25] Greek rendering of it and it count it
[31:27] actually comes comes from two words uh
[31:30] it means twice and then it means Spirit
[31:33] or mind now it it watch this now so it's
[31:36] twice minded twice Spirit double-minded
[31:40] or
[31:41] doubtful now in James 18 referring to
[31:44] the doubter or
[31:46] waverer which corresponds to another
[31:49] Greek word in a general sense as an
[31:52] unstable person James 4:8 such a person
[31:56] look at this such a person suffers from
[31:59] divided
[32:01] loyalties on the one hand he wishes to
[32:04] maintain a religious confession and
[32:07] desires the presence of God in his life
[32:10] on the other hand he loves the ways of
[32:13] the world and prefers to live according
[32:16] to its morals and
[32:19] ethics now I I've seen this kind of a
[32:22] person in my experience in my Ministry
[32:26] I've I've you you you've you've no doubt
[32:28] seen it too you are and even today we
[32:31] find a lot of people forsaking the way
[32:33] of Truth amen and going after the false
[32:35] doctrines of of of baale and and and
[32:38] Boer as as the Apostle says and what
[32:41] ends up happening what what kind of a
[32:43] man is it that can sit under the truth
[32:47] and I've seen them sit for 10 12 15 20
[32:51] years and sit right under the truth
[32:54] because why they they love the presence
[32:57] they want to be in the presence of God
[32:59] they they they they have a human desire
[33:02] because they know its truth and that's
[33:05] that's a tormenting thing and and you
[33:07] say well why do they sit there because
[33:10] watch and this is this is the real key
[33:13] in their mind their human mind their
[33:17] human Spirit remember your body Spirit
[33:19] soul in the spirit is memory reasonings
[33:23] conscience amen affection
[33:26] imaginations in their human spirit in
[33:29] the mind of their human Spirit they are
[33:32] convinced of the truth yes
[33:35] doctrinally but in their soul they've
[33:38] never been converted and so they still
[33:41] have the nature of the world that
[33:43] desires the world and there's always
[33:44] this tug yeah there's always this
[33:47] conflict they can't leave it because
[33:49] they wouldn't be able to sleep at night
[33:51] because they know it's true they can't
[33:53] argue the message of the hour not with
[33:56] this anyway amen I I had a meeting one
[34:00] time in a and a and a and a and a
[34:02] Baptist Theologian he was a actually had
[34:04] a a big Bible school and he challenged
[34:07] me on some of the teachings of the
[34:08] message and and we decided to have a big
[34:10] open discussion in front of both of our
[34:12] churches and and and I and and I has
[34:15] told him and I began to talk to him
[34:16] about serpent seed and he said that he
[34:18] said we'll take that subject and I said
[34:20] fine we'll take the original sin and he
[34:22] said I'm going to I'm going to take my
[34:23] Bible and he said I'm going to prove you
[34:25] to be an idiot and I said sir I'm just
[34:27] going to warn you and I said it's the
[34:29] only warning you're going to get if you
[34:30] plan to contend with the serpent Seed
[34:32] doctrine you better bring something
[34:33] different than your
[34:36] Bible amen because the Bible teaches it
[34:39] from cover to
[34:40] cover and I said you're going to need
[34:42] something different than your Bible
[34:43] because you're never going to contend
[34:44] with it using your Bible you better
[34:46] bring a different book he didn't like
[34:48] that too
[34:50] good uh because there's no way the Bible
[34:54] the Bible the disciples knew it the
[34:55] Pharisees knew it am the Pharisees
[34:58] looked right at Jesus when when when he
[35:00] began to talk about that hey hey hey
[35:02] we're not born of
[35:04] fornication see and people theologians
[35:07] today say oh well they were just
[35:08] referencing his questionable birth
[35:10] nonsense look at look at Jesus next
[35:11] remark they said look at their next
[35:13] remark they said we be not born forn
[35:15] born of fornication we have one father
[35:17] even God because see they knew what
[35:19] Jesus was
[35:20] implying they could read between the
[35:22] lines Jesus said you're of your father
[35:24] you do his Works you're just like your
[35:26] daddy and they said Hold On second we
[35:28] know what you're talking about nobody we
[35:30] have only one God and and that we have
[35:32] only one father and that's God so even
[35:34] the even the Pharisees knew about the
[35:36] original sin the early early church knew
[35:39] about it I was in India and I saw a
[35:41] sculpture that was 4,000 years old and
[35:43] it was it was not a sculpture it was a
[35:45] carving inside of a inside of a rock and
[35:48] it was literally handcarved it was 4,000
[35:50] years old and it it depicted the
[35:52] original sin to a te head to toe the
[35:55] whole Doctrine was carved in stone 4,000
[35:59] years old so the Ancients certainly knew
[36:03] what had happened amen and it's just
[36:05] people indoctrinated today won't open
[36:07] their mind and let the word you know get
[36:09] so indoctrinated they can't see anything
[36:11] else but we realize that that you don't
[36:15] you you have this struggle and you see
[36:17] them today fleeing away then if you'll
[36:19] notice what's always the response then
[36:21] they turn around and attack the
[36:24] message now you say my that don't make
[36:26] any sense it actually makes perfect
[36:28] sense because you have to understand
[36:31] these people got to sleep at night so
[36:33] how are they not going to go insane
[36:35] knowing that they've doomed themselves
[36:37] they have to turn around and discredit
[36:39] it they actually have to convince
[36:42] themselves it's
[36:43] wrong they have to attack it because it
[36:46] doesn't make sense I've said many times
[36:48] that uh one evidence of an evil spirit
[36:51] anointing you is you'll do things that
[36:52] don't make sense you'll do things that
[36:53] are insane because why would you spend
[36:56] all your time resources and energy and
[36:59] and YouTube and the internet and and
[37:01] you're attacking you I I I was saying to
[37:04] one man who had a family member and I
[37:06] said you know it's amazing how your
[37:07] brother's doing that I said he he was
[37:09] Among Us for 12 years and I said he
[37:13] knows we love the Lord he knows we're
[37:15] good people why would he attack us why
[37:18] would he not spend his air time
[37:19] attacking Rome amen or attacking
[37:21] Mormonism or attacking Jehovah's Witness
[37:23] or attacking something that he knows is
[37:26] full of idolatry why would he attack us
[37:29] it doesn't even make sense it's not even
[37:32] logical see and so it just shows you
[37:35] know it's an evil spirit but actually
[37:37] they succeed they convince themselves
[37:40] and when they the Bible says when you
[37:42] resist the truth you hold it you try to
[37:44] stop it you try to suppress it that the
[37:46] Bible says God will turn you over to a
[37:48] reprobate mind send a strong delusion
[37:50] you'll believe a lie and be damned by so
[37:53] they actually end up being not
[37:56] Hypocrites they actually have become
[37:58] deceived by the spirit of delusion and
[38:00] they begin to actually believe the lie
[38:02] see so it's a oh it's a sad State it's
[38:05] it's it's not a state for any believer
[38:07] to be in if you're here today friends
[38:09] don't be
[38:11] double-minded don't sit here and be
[38:13] convinced if you've been for years in
[38:15] this church or any church let me the
[38:17] spirit of the Lord has so burdened my
[38:19] heart with this thought and I want to
[38:21] say it to you today as I said it to my
[38:23] own church don't sit in a message Church
[38:26] week after week after month after year
[38:28] after decade and you know it's the truth
[38:31] but you you will not surrender your soul
[38:33] to Christ don't be double-minded let God
[38:37] let the mind which was in Christ be in
[38:41] you humble yourselves draw nigh and
[38:45] he'll draw nigh unto
[38:47] you amen amen oh my I tell you friends
[38:52] it's it's it's so beautiful draw nigh un
[38:55] God cleanse your hands purify your
[38:58] hearts amen repent amen see you don't
[39:03] have to live that way it unstable this
[39:06] word unstable the next word means
[39:10] unstable from the Greek it means
[39:13] unsettled again it's two words it's the
[39:16] Greek word not a Greek word meaning not
[39:18] and another one meaning to settle
[39:20] meaning unsettled
[39:22] unsteady unstable it refers to
[39:26] instability it is synonymous with a
[39:29] different Greek word which means one
[39:32] that cannot be
[39:35] restrained
[39:37] untameable listen let me just say to you
[39:40] men and women grit your
[39:43] teeth summon all the human willpower to

[41:42] mama told me it's right I know my daddy

[41:49] you I went and got a hold of God and I
[41:50] said I want to know and I begin to study

[42:19] Carolina and it just made a perfect
[42:21] circle almost like a almost like
[42:23] somebody had planted it like that and
[42:25] you could just you could walk through
[42:27] that when you walked in you were inside
[42:28] of a laurel room and you couldn't see
[42:30] through it in it over it or under it and
[42:32] I would sit in there and the sun would
[42:33] come right down in there I'd open my
[42:35] bible oh my I'm tell you what I began to
[42:38] question the one day I began to went in
[42:40] there and I was praying about the Holy
[42:41] Ghost and I said Lord oh this I need the
[42:44] if it's the Holy Ghost I need I don't
[42:45] want to just be a a head case I don't
[42:47] want to just be mentally convinced I
[42:49] want to have the power I my all my
[42:51] Heroes all the men I read about was
[42:53] missionaries and great men of God I
[42:54] didn't read comic books and things like
[42:56] that I read about I read about Hudson
[42:58] Taylor and I read about David Livingston
[43:00] I read about I read about these Great
[43:02] Men I said Lord someday I want to serve
[43:04] you and I tell you what friends I was
[43:05] praying is the honest truth I was
[43:07] praying I was on my knees on the ground
[43:09] and I had my Bible open before me and
[43:12] I'm praying and a wind whipped through
[43:13] there which was almost impossible
[43:16] because it was a ringed wall and a wind
[43:18] and and I felt my page I could hear my
[43:20] pages
[43:21] going and I didn't want my pages to tear
[43:24] so I just put my hands there while I
[43:25] finished praying and I said Lord I just
[43:27] want this power of God and when I opened
[43:30] my eyes I looked down my eyes fell
[43:32] directly on but you shall receive power
[43:34] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[43:36] you and you shall be a witness unto me
[43:39] hallelujah oh I remember it like it was

[43:45] and and even even from then I still had
[43:47] growth I still had to press I still had
[43:49] to press and I'm still pressing today

[43:54] just here to warm a Pew or or say I

[44:00] message Hallelujah I don't want to be
[44:02] unstable I got a wife to lead I got a
[44:05] church to lead I had children to raise
[44:07] it's no time for instability Brothers Oh

[44:12] need to see a stable mom they need to

[44:17] Mom and Dad know how to pray and know

[44:21] want a spiritual church have spiritual
[44:24] families cuz a church is just a
[44:26] collection of amilies
[44:29] hallelujah oh
[44:32] my so it's untamable it's one that
[44:35] cannot be restrained next slide I want
[44:38] to look at these in parallel verses the
[44:40] first one I want to look at is James 18
[44:43] where we read uh where you remember in
[44:46] James chapter 18 A double-minded man is
[44:47] unstable in all of his ways from the
[44:50] Amplified it's this for being as he is a
[44:54] man of two minds hesitating dubious
[44:58] irresolute he is unstable and unreliable
[45:01] and uncertain about everything he thinks
[45:04] feels
[45:06] decides look at it from the New Living
[45:09] Translation their loyalty is divided
[45:12] between God and the world and they are
[45:16] unstable in
[45:18] everything they
[45:21] do that's all I have on the PowerPoint
[45:24] now let's turn to Luke 11 in your Bibles
[45:28] now let me take it from this angle from
[45:32] the gospel of St Luke chapter
[45:36] 11 all right how long have I been out
[45:38] here I need to set a
[45:40] timer let me see I haven't set my watch
[45:42] back okay so I've okay I think I've been
[45:45] going about 30 minutes is that about
[45:47] right I think so all right I just wanna
[45:50] I don't want to overtax you I I think
[45:51] there's a great value in not over taxing
[45:54] the people's minds I won't I don't want
[45:55] you just to get so sponged you don't
[45:57] remember this all right so now Luke
[46:02] 11 um and let's look let's look at this
[46:05] is the exact same thing that we read
[46:07] same story same account that we read in
[46:09] Matthew chapter 6 only we're reading
[46:11] Luke's rendering of it and in Luke 11
[46:14] let's start at verse uh 20 uh um I have
[46:19] U 22 let's see something's not right
[46:22] here
[46:25] um I've got a wrong scripture
[46:28] somewhere let's see why that
[46:32] is amen yeah I'm in the complete wrong
[46:35] spot okay I know what I need to do stand
[46:37] by and let me make a quick adjustment
[46:40] find my place I went from one one
[46:42] section to another and I had it in my
[46:45] mind that that's what it was all right
[46:47] Luke Chapter um 12 I'm sorry yeah Luke
[46:51] chapter 12 I said Luke 11 so exactly
[46:53] Luke chapter 12 all right now
[46:58] and um
[47:01] let's it should have been right
[47:08] standby is that
[47:10] correct yes you're you're you're right
[47:13] okay yes you're correct thank you
[47:15] brother it is chapter 11 I had so very
[47:17] good so it's 33 all right and I see that
[47:20] now that's what I had and I told you a
[47:21] different one all right now Luke I see
[47:25] what I did now in my not when I put it
[47:27] in my iPad so let's begin at verse 33
[47:30] Luke
[47:31] 11:33 that's what it is thank you
[47:33] brother all right no man when he has
[47:36] lighted a candle putteth it in a secret
[47:38] place neither under a bushel but on a
[47:42] Candlestick that they which come in may
[47:44] see the light the light now watch this
[47:47] verse 34 the light of the body is the
[47:51] eye therefore when thine eye is single
[47:55] thy whole body also is is full of light
[47:58] but when thy eye is evil thy body also
[48:02] is full of Darkness take heed therefore
[48:06] that the light which is in thee be not
[48:09] Darkness now that's almost impossible to
[48:11] comprehend until you read the next verse
[48:13] If thy whole body therefore be full of
[48:16] light having no dark
[48:18] part all right the whole shall be full
[48:22] of light as when the bright shining of a
[48:25] candle doth give thee light all right
[48:27] now so the light of the body is the eye
[48:32] if therefore thine eye be single thy
[48:36] whole body shall be full of light now
[48:38] interestingly this word single goes
[48:41] right back and I'm connecting it now
[48:43] today right back to this double-minded
[48:46] condition and in fact is that word
[48:48] literally is is ha loose from the Greek
[48:51] and it's used of the eye uh as not
[48:55] seeing double so Jesus is saying if
[48:57] you're not seeing double okay if your
[49:00] eye is single all right and it actually
[49:03] it goes on to mean something this word
[49:05] single means without
[49:08] duplicity it's a derivative of hotus
[49:12] which means without guile
[49:15] sincere
[49:17] genuine pure amen so it's not
[49:20] double-minded it's not it's not a uh a
[49:24] condition of a man where you know he's
[49:26] convicted vinced in his human mind that
[49:28] it's truth but his nature watch watch
[49:31] what he's saying watch what Jesus is
[49:32] saying the light of the body is the eye
[49:35] if therefore thine eye be single the
[49:37] whole body shall be full of light in
[49:38] other words you know you're you're when
[49:40] you're born again you're nature is
[49:43] changed in the soul and therefore it
[49:46] changes your entire nature so you're not
[49:49] halfway born again you either are are
[49:51] all are all are not amen see so so that
[49:55] that's what the the the the it's trying
[49:58] to get to the light of the body is the
[50:01] eye now I'm going to paraphrase the
[50:03] scripture by by your leave today don't
[50:05] throw a brick at me because I'm this is
[50:07] exactly you you can see if you study
[50:09] this out it's perfectly right and I've
[50:11] got a number of quotes brother Brandon
[50:12] is going to support this so in Luke 34
[50:15] the light of the body is the eye now
[50:17] just let me say it to you in in in this
[50:20] way so the the light of the body is the
[50:23] eye that is to say the light of the body
[50:28] describes the condition of the eye
[50:30] because the eye is your desires amen the
[50:33] eye is your desire represents your
[50:35] desires see all right now now now watch
[50:38] Jesus said if you love this world are
[50:41] the things of the world see if your
[50:43] desires are for the world it's CA you're
[50:45] not born again now the flesh desires the
[50:48] world but the Inner Man the in man
[50:51] doesn't want the world that's where the
[50:53] greatest battle ever fought is say oh
[50:56] well then I've got got a right to to
[50:57] just to just go on with battle brother
[50:59] brand said no the idea is not to keep
[51:01] battling the idea is to finish this
[51:03] battle and win this war and bring the
[51:05] body under
[51:07] subjection so the light of the body the
[51:10] light of the body is the eye that's to
[51:12] say that the light of the body is
[51:14] describing the condition of the eye that
[51:16] is also to say the nature of the spirit
[51:19] if I'd say it to you like this if I
[51:22] would say the light of the body is the
[51:23] eye that's the same as me saying the
[51:25] nature of the Spirit shows the condition
[51:28] in your soul because the soul is the
[51:30] nature of the
[51:32] spirit see the human spirit is Fallen he
[51:35] he's just as evil as the flesh you have
[51:38] five inlets five Outlets you understand
[51:40] you have five inlets In the Flesh and
[51:42] five outlets in the spirit all right so
[51:44] you take things in through your inlets
[51:47] but in your spirit from your memory your
[51:48] conscience your reason your affection
[51:50] that's why you speak that's why you do
[51:51] that's why you go that's why you do this
[51:53] or don't do that you're driven by that
[51:56] amen and and if you have an unconverted
[51:58] nature there is no battle if you have an
[52:01] unconverted nature and you're not
[52:03] convinced of the word mentally you don't
[52:04] even fight anything your your flesh your
[52:07] spirit and your soul all agree and you
[52:08] just go the way of the world but when
[52:10] you're born again in the soul that's
[52:12] when a Warfare
[52:14] starts see and the and the sad part is
[52:18] people is people won't they won't let
[52:21] that happen and and and yet their mind
[52:24] become they hear the gospel they start
[52:25] coming to church and then they hear the
[52:28] truth and their their mind becomes
[52:30] convinced of it you say well brother
[52:33] Jason wouldn't they at least be a better
[52:34] person if they at least knew the truth
[52:36] even if they weren't converted no
[52:37] they're
[52:38] worse that's according to scripture and
[52:40] brother Bram also said that brother Bram
[52:42] talked about Gathering stones and he
[52:44] said what do you do you gather a bunch
[52:46] of stones from the world and you put
[52:47] them in a church and he refers it right
[52:49] back to the Old Testament this Gathering
[52:51] of stones that's like bringing people
[52:53] into the church and teaching them the
[52:54] ways of right and wrong Paul said look
[52:56] at there was a time when I didn't know
[52:58] anything about lust and I was pretty
[52:59] good but once I found out that I'm not
[53:02] supposed to cover it now I got problems
[53:04] am and brother brandom said you'd have
[53:06] been better off all you're doing is
[53:07] piling up Stones he said you'd have been
[53:09] better off to just leave them out there
[53:10] in the field amen see because then then
[53:13] they just wouldn't have known then they
[53:14] could at least plead
[53:16] ignorance that's what the the when Jesus
[53:18] said to the to the Pharisees in the
[53:21] temple and he started talking about full
[53:23] of this is full of dead men's bones you
[53:25] polish the tombs and and and and uh and
[53:28] and you're blind your blind leaders of
[53:30] the Blind and the Pharisees saidoh are
[53:32] are we blind also and Jesus said
[53:34] interesting thing he said now he said if
[53:37] you were blind then You' you'd have
[53:40] somewh you could say he said but because
[53:42] you say you see your guilt
[53:45] remains see so no you're you're you're
[53:48] you're you're you it's not that we don't
[53:50] want to witness the truth because what
[53:53] you've got to offer them is so glorious
[53:55] but my message message today in this
[53:57] morning service is primarily to us as
[53:59] Believers to say friends don't sit here
[54:02] year after year unconverted amen you'll
[54:06] never tame that flesh try as you might
[54:09] you'll cry you'll weep you'll you'll
[54:11] have brother Brooks lay hands and pray
[54:13] for you but until you surrender and let
[54:16] the Life of Christ come inside that oh
[54:18] and then then you're talking about Joy
[54:21] you're talking about Victory you'll have
[54:23] Victory all the time even if you stop in
[54:26] your flesh you'll have Victory because
[54:28] your flesh stumbling won't count
[54:30] anymore Hallelujah doesn't count blessed
[54:34] is the man whom God will not impute
[54:36] unrighteousness
[54:38] to see so I mean it's a it's a it's a
[54:41] it's a it's a deal you can't
[54:44] refuse all right so so he says so the
[54:49] light of the body is the eye it's like
[54:52] it's like if I they have a word for that
[54:54] I forget the term they use it's
[54:56] hyperbole but U but it it it's similar
[54:59] to hyperbole where you're you're you're
[55:00] making a sideways statement to make a
[55:02] point you're trying to illustrate a
[55:03] point in a backward way uh like as if I
[55:06] would say here today the the beauty of a
[55:08] church is its character so I'm I'm I'm
[55:11] just I'm making a description based on
[55:13] this on this wording so Jesus is saying
[55:15] the light of the body is the eye so the
[55:19] condition of the Soul what he's
[55:20] literally saying is is the condition of
[55:23] the soul is made manifest clearly by the
[55:27] desires of the Mind in the human Spirit
[55:30] see because if you love the world or the
[55:33] things of the world it demonstrates that
[55:35] the love of God which which the the
[55:38] Bible says the love of God is shed
[55:40] abroad into our hearts by the Holy
[55:43] Ghost see remember friends love love's
[55:46] not an emotion amen that's right that's
[55:48] just a human thing see the Bible doesn't
[55:51] say God has love the Bible says God is
[55:56] love love see so love is a person so so
[56:01] the the when you when you're when you're
[56:05] the the the condition of your eye your
[56:07] desires uh the light of the body is the
[56:10] eye is is is the way that God judges the
[56:13] condition of the Soul because it's made
[56:15] manifest by the desires of the Mind in
[56:18] the human spirit so the eye is what you
[56:22] lust after that is to say it's your
[56:24] desires so if you're born again from the
[56:27] soul it being a new nature changes the
[56:31] desires of the Mind in the spirit of a
[56:33] man it controls that your whole desires
[56:36] become different you no longer desire
[56:39] the things of the world this flesh will
[56:42] still enjoy it and if you if you neglect
[56:46] if you feed this flesh it'll overpower
[56:48] you it doesn't mean you're not born
[56:50] again brother brandham said you'll do
[56:51] wrong as a direct quote you'll willfully
[56:53] do wrong it doesn't mean you're not a
[56:55] son it just means the rod of of
[56:56] Correction is on the
[57:00] way I'm glad see so it it changes the
[57:06] desires of the mind and and it and you
[57:10] have to you can't neglect Paul said how
[57:13] shall we escape if we neglect not
[57:17] disbelief he didn't say how shall we
[57:20] escape if we disbelieve so great a
[57:21] message he said how shall we escape
[57:22] Believers how many Believers we got how
[57:25] shall we escape Believers if we neglect
[57:28] so great a Salvation you know what the
[57:30] answer is you
[57:32] won't you won't Escape you won't get by
[57:34] with that you'll find yourself in shame
[57:37] and disgrace and stumbling you'll find
[57:39] yourself crawling up to an altar and and
[57:41] and crying out to God to forgive you oh
[57:43] I'm going tell you something friends God
[57:44] is ready to operate perfect love and
[57:46] perfect faith in a perfect people
[57:48] brother Brandon said you watch a perfect
[57:50] God keep a perfect promise a perfect
[57:52] word to a perfect people hallelujah
[57:55] who'll believe it
[57:56] imperfection and I want to be I want to
[57:59] be some of those
[58:01] people therefore watch this therefore
[58:03] when thy eye is single look thy whole
[58:07] body is also is full of light see
[58:10] because you're born again by the spirit
[58:13] of God the token brings your whole body
[58:17] under subjection to the word Amen
[58:20] brother brandham says in God's provided
[58:22] place of worship if the spirit that's
[58:25] raised Jes Jesus from the dead dwells in
[58:27] you it will Quicken make alive your
[58:31] mortal bodies because it's already
[58:34] life and when it comes into your body it
[58:37] brings your whole body subject to it
[58:40] subject to what the word of God if it's
[58:44] in
[58:45] you watch but when thine eye is
[58:49] evil see when you're not converted in
[58:52] the soul when all you've got is a
[58:54] convincing in the in the human mind
[58:57] of the doctrines and the validity and
[58:59] the truth of the
[59:00] teachings when you're listen Satan is
[59:03] Satan is a believer in this
[59:05] message Satan believes the Bible he just
[59:08] refuses to obey it that's that's that's
[59:11] that's also a direct quote brother
[59:12] brandham said Satan's a Believer brother
[59:14] brandham said direct quote Satan's not a
[59:16] make believer he actually believes it
[59:19] but he's not converted he said brother
[59:22] brandom said in one place Satan knows
[59:23] the will of God he just refuses to do it
[59:25] see so it's it's a choice because Satan
[59:28] has a soul so he made a choice so when
[59:31] thy eye is evil when thy soul is
[59:33] unconverted thy body also is full of
[59:36] Darkness your whole body everything H so
[59:39] so so you're not born again watch this
[59:41] you're not born again in this condition
[59:44] when your eye is evil it's speaking of
[59:47] an unconverted person though you though
[59:49] and this is a hard saying but though you
[59:52] may have had the Holy Ghost on your SP
[59:56] spirit and on your flesh for years
[1:00:00] amen absolutely yes sir almost at times
[1:00:03] you'd almost think brother brandham is
[1:00:05] is redacting things that he had said
[1:00:07] early in the ministry because he comes
[1:00:08] late in his ministry 64 and 65 and he
[1:00:11] said you say oh I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:12] he said oh that don't mean nothing
[1:00:14] that's right that don't mean you're
[1:00:15] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:00:16] thing you're going to heaven he said you
[1:00:18] can have the Holy Ghost every day of
[1:00:20] your life and go right to Hell see now
[1:00:22] he's not changing his Doctrine he's just
[1:00:24] simply trying to illustrate you that the
[1:00:26] Holy Ghost can fall on your flesh the
[1:00:29] Holy Ghost anointed Elvis Presley amen
[1:00:32] it can fall on your spirit you can fall
[1:00:34] under the anointing that doesn't mean
[1:00:36] you're
[1:00:37] converted but when it strikes the soul
[1:00:40] when a when a light flashes across a
[1:00:42] gene of God it comes to life Hallelujah
[1:00:46] and you realize that you weren't just
[1:00:48] you didn't start you didn't become a son
[1:00:50] you realize I've always been a Son of
[1:00:53] God hallelujah
[1:00:58] see you're you have access then to the
[1:01:01] presence of God that's why God had to
[1:01:02] send us a prophet to to bring the token
[1:01:05] because because the way that the
[1:01:07] teaching had been lost down Through the
[1:01:09] Ages and God couldn't just restore it
[1:01:12] through Luther Wesley and Pentecost it
[1:01:14] had to come back to the Mighty God
[1:01:16] unveiled it had to be the full unveiled
[1:01:18] word and God had to bring a prophet
[1:01:21] because God was bringing listen friends
[1:01:24] God sent a prophet to bring you into his
[1:01:26] presence amen that's right see it takes
[1:01:29] a prophet that's what the office of a
[1:01:31] prophet does a prophet brings you into
[1:01:34] the presence of God Amen see that's
[1:01:36] that's that's the office of a prophet
[1:01:38] that's why that's why that's why Jesus
[1:01:40] came as son of
[1:01:42] man he came as a prophet he came to draw
[1:01:44] people into the presence of God when
[1:01:46] they walked into his presence they were
[1:01:47] in the presence of God Amen see that's
[1:01:51] why when the rich man came to him the
[1:01:52] Rich Young Ruler and he said good master
[1:01:55] and brother Bram illustrates it so
[1:01:56] beautifully said good master and brother
[1:01:58] brandham says notice Jesus said why do
[1:02:00] you why do you call me good you know as
[1:02:03] well as me there's only one good and
[1:02:05] that's God is that who you're saying I
[1:02:08] am keep keep keep coming with that
[1:02:11] Revelation you've called me good now
[1:02:13] just come on a little closer you've got
[1:02:15] a problem in your life you love riches
[1:02:17] see I I love you as a man but you've
[1:02:19] called You're you know that I'm God you
[1:02:21] know I can help you that's what Jesus
[1:02:23] was saying to him see so so a prophet
[1:02:27] comes to bring you into listen friends
[1:02:29] the whole world Listen anybody is
[1:02:33] suceptible to God's blessing
[1:02:36] yes there's there's things give and
[1:02:38] it'll be given to you press down shaking
[1:02:40] together running over uh you know you do
[1:02:43] good and God will say even if you give a
[1:02:45] cup of cold water amen so many people
[1:02:48] you pay your tithes and and into the
[1:02:50] house of God and your offerings to the
[1:02:52] Lord and I don't you don't even have to
[1:02:54] be born again to be blessed for that
[1:02:55] I've known I've known men who were not
[1:02:57] born again who knew that secret and paid
[1:02:59] their tithe and God blessed them they
[1:03:02] weren't even
[1:03:03] Christians but they honored that word
[1:03:05] say that's almost like cheating well you
[1:03:07] know talk to God about it it's a promise
[1:03:09] he put in the scripture anybody's
[1:03:11] entitled to his blessings listen to this
[1:03:14] anybody's entitled to his anointing the
[1:03:16] anointing the rain falls on the just and
[1:03:18] the unjust amen Benny hen can get under
[1:03:21] just the same anointing you can you
[1:03:24] understand there can be anointing that
[1:03:25] can fall on lots of people but but but
[1:03:28] but the only way you can't act but
[1:03:30] that's not his
[1:03:31] presence because in order to get his
[1:03:34] presence you've got to have
[1:03:36] blood and that's why God had to bring a
[1:03:39] prophet because we had to have a
[1:03:40] bleeding word the message of the hour is
[1:03:43] a bleeding word and it gives you
[1:03:45] uniquely
[1:03:47] presence it gives you access to the
[1:03:50] presence of God oh friends I'm not just
[1:03:52] here to have his anointing I enjoy his
[1:03:54] anointing want his Blessing today
[1:03:56] tomorrow and every day but I need his
[1:03:59] presence I need a word that will give me
[1:04:02] access to his presence amen and that's
[1:04:05] why when they reject this message they
[1:04:07] have no access to his presence they can
[1:04:10] get his anointing they can get his
[1:04:11] Blessing but they can't have his
[1:04:12] presence it takes a prophet that's right
[1:04:15] to do that that's why Moses was a
[1:04:18] prophet that's right Abraham was a
[1:04:20] prophet Noah was a prophet that's why
[1:04:22] Noah could build the ark and it was
[1:04:25] safety for the people because he was a
[1:04:26] prophet amen that's why that's why
[1:04:28] listen friends that's exactly if you
[1:04:29] think about it when you think about
[1:04:31] Moses now here you've got Aron who's a
[1:04:35] priest now is he godall priest yeah is
[1:04:39] he is he thus sayith the Lord priest
[1:04:40] absolutely Aaron and his sons that's
[1:04:43] directly scripture he had thus saith the
[1:04:45] Lord he was actually in the priesthood
[1:04:47] but did you know Aaron could not walk
[1:04:48] into the presence of God without blood
[1:04:50] if he didn't have blood he dropped dead
[1:04:52] didn't mean God didn't love him God
[1:04:54] loved him dearly but if he walked in
[1:04:55] there without without blood he dropped
[1:04:56] dead see but you know that God Called
[1:05:00] Moses in and out of the pillar of cloud
[1:05:01] and never took blood with
[1:05:03] him Moses never one time slew a lamb
[1:05:05] walked into the pillar of fire Moses
[1:05:07] never one time had to go into the he
[1:05:09] never had to have blood you know why
[1:05:10] because the ministry of a prophet is a
[1:05:13] Ministry of atonement yes sir amen the
[1:05:15] ministry of a prophet is a Ministry of
[1:05:18] atonement amen and so Moses is able
[1:05:21] being a prophet He's Able just to walk
[1:05:23] right in and out of the presence of God
[1:05:24] and disappeared into that cloud and
[1:05:27] never died Hallelujah and when he you
[1:05:29] notice when he says to Mo he says to
[1:05:31] Moses go back down there and make sure
[1:05:32] nobody comes on this mountain yes sir
[1:05:34] tell them don't break through unto me
[1:05:35] I'll have to slaughter them and Moses
[1:05:37] said Lord you know we we build a fence
[1:05:39] we there's nobody can get up here we
[1:05:41] build we built a big barrier around it
[1:05:43] and the Lord said Moses go back down
[1:05:46] there and tell them don't come into my
[1:05:49] presence and Moses goes to go down he
[1:05:51] says and Moses when you come back bring
[1:05:54] Aaron with you and when he brought Aaron
[1:05:56] with him he didn't bring blood but Aaron
[1:05:58] didn't die because he was with Moses
[1:06:01] amen and he walked he walked Aaron right
[1:06:03] into the presence of God oh are you glad
[1:06:06] for a prophet are you glad for the
[1:06:09] presence I say Lord I'm so glad for this
[1:06:12] message today it gives me access to the
[1:06:15] presence of
[1:06:18] God so brother brandham said see so so
[1:06:23] when thy eye is evil
[1:06:25] body also is full of Darkness so brother
[1:06:28] brandham says in God making his
[1:06:30] promise you never did see a black white
[1:06:33] bird at the same time you never seen a
[1:06:34] drunk sober man at the same time you
[1:06:36] never seen a sinner Saint at the same
[1:06:38] time see you don't see that you're
[1:06:40] you're on one side of the fence God
[1:06:42] keeps his word he's give us the word for
[1:06:45] pattern I love that he's give us the
[1:06:48] word for pattern see so you don't have a
[1:06:51] sinner Saint he's either born again or
[1:06:53] he's not born again so that's why Jesus
[1:06:55] said if your eye is single your whole
[1:06:57] body's full of light but if your eye is
[1:07:00] not single if you're double-minded then
[1:07:02] your whole body is full of Darkness amen
[1:07:04] you're you're nowhere you haven't even
[1:07:06] got started your whole life is still
[1:07:08] zero I don't care how many quotes you
[1:07:11] memorize your life is zero I don't care
[1:07:14] if you can memorize the whole Bible I
[1:07:16] don't care if you're a preacher I don't
[1:07:17] care if you've been in the message 50
[1:07:19] years and went around the world if
[1:07:21] you're not born again your life is
[1:07:24] zero Hallelujah
[1:07:26] yes Hallelujah brother brandham says
[1:07:28] from adoption part three he says
[1:07:30] remember last Wednesday night Christians
[1:07:32] sin but a sinner cannot sin that's right
[1:07:35] see watch a sinner doesn't sin no see
[1:07:37] because he's a sinner he's just a sinner
[1:07:39] to begin with that's all here he said
[1:07:42] take the back of this book and I'll just
[1:07:44] use my Bible he says take the back of
[1:07:46] this
[1:07:46] book he says watch watch this he says
[1:07:50] how much of this is black he said it's
[1:07:52] all black it's not part black it's all
[1:07:55] black how much of it's black it's all
[1:07:58] black there's just no white to it it's
[1:08:01] black uh you say this much here no no it
[1:08:04] ain't it's the whole thing's black it's
[1:08:06] all black that's the way a sinner is see
[1:08:11] he's just condemned to start with what
[1:08:13] about it what about if he commits
[1:08:15] adultery we don't condemn him for
[1:08:16] committing adultery we condemn him
[1:08:18] because he's a sinner amen if he was a
[1:08:21] Christian he wouldn't do that see that's
[1:08:24] right if he's been changed he won't do
[1:08:27] that because he's a sinner that's what
[1:08:30] that's what makes him do that because
[1:08:33] he's a sinner so so you you you've got
[1:08:37] this situation where we've got to come
[1:08:39] to terms with that today we've got to
[1:08:41] come to terms with this fact friends and
[1:08:43] stop living this double life and I may
[1:08:46] only be preaching to one or two people
[1:08:48] here today but I know this meant a lot
[1:08:50] to me it meant a lot to my church and
[1:08:52] God told me to preach it here today amen
[1:08:55] give up that double life don't just sit
[1:08:57] here and be convinced of the truth
[1:09:00] because you're nowhere with that you're
[1:09:01] just tormented and you're tortured and
[1:09:04] eventually the devil will get you listen
[1:09:06] you can run but you can't hide he'll
[1:09:08] find you he'll track you down he knows
[1:09:10] your
[1:09:11] weakness but I'm here today to tell you
[1:09:13] you can be filled with the life of God
[1:09:16] you can be full of the Holy Ghost you
[1:09:19] can have your nature changed and it's
[1:09:20] not hard to
[1:09:22] do we've made the Holy Ghost so
[1:09:25] difficult and so hard it was never
[1:09:26] complicated in the early church the the
[1:09:29] the the the the the prescription has
[1:09:31] always been the same repent amen amen
[1:09:35] and people don't get it because they
[1:09:36] don't
[1:09:37] repent and then they have to take this
[1:09:39] long way around and then they have to go
[1:09:40] a long time in various degrees of
[1:09:42] sanctification and slowly prove
[1:09:44] theirself and finally God will take them
[1:09:46] drag them through this ditch and and and
[1:09:48] listen God has two two methods of of
[1:09:50] fixing you the Bible says either that
[1:09:53] that either that rock which is Christ
[1:09:56] either you'll fall on him and be broken
[1:09:58] or he'll fall on you and grind you to
[1:10:02] powder oh let me tell you something
[1:10:04] friends I'm glad it's that way cuz this
[1:10:07] old guy here would have just kept on
[1:10:08] running but I tell you man I I I finally
[1:10:11] one day I stepped up on that rock and I
[1:10:13] said Lord I'm done running I just uh put
[1:10:16] the cuffs on me now oh I just want to be
[1:10:19] full of the spirit of God don't you
[1:10:21] friends that's the kind of life you want
[1:10:23] to
[1:10:24] live see see you want to be you want to
[1:10:28] be a real Christian you want to be have
[1:10:30] a have a real power and then then you
[1:10:32] know we we we talk about you know and
[1:10:36] and people can make it hard and I don't
[1:10:38] know I don't know why it ever how it
[1:10:39] ever got that way maybe because of the
[1:10:41] way it had to be restored and it came
[1:10:42] through three Church ages and and we got
[1:10:45] portions of it restored back and then
[1:10:46] the restoration of the gifts and then
[1:10:48] that became cloud and then well what is
[1:10:50] the Holy Ghost and then it's the new
[1:10:52] birth well is it something else and is
[1:10:53] it something different and how is it
[1:10:55] that it falls on you and it's on your
[1:10:57] body it's on your spirit it's on your
[1:10:58] soul listen friends uh the baptism of
[1:11:01] the Holy Ghost is the Life of Christ
[1:11:02] Living inside you you have a gene of God
[1:11:05] that comes to life it's two omnipotence
[1:11:07] meat it's the it's the anointing of the
[1:11:10] holy spirit that falls upon a gene of
[1:11:12] God because you allow it amen you allow
[1:11:16] it and you say Lord I I Repent of all my
[1:11:19] entire life I'd no longer if you listen
[1:11:22] people don't get the Holy Ghost and they
[1:11:24] sit in churches for years and the reason
[1:11:26] they don't get it is because they don't
[1:11:28] fully
[1:11:28] repent that's it they repent 99% but if
[1:11:32] you leave one thing God will know that
[1:11:34] God knows your heart you can't fool him
[1:11:37] that's why I've seen some people come up
[1:11:38] and they struggle for years just to be
[1:11:40] sealed in the Holy Ghost and then some
[1:11:42] people come up and in a moment and it's
[1:11:44] over and they never look back and I mean
[1:11:46] they're you say how did that happen
[1:11:48] because God knew when they repented they
[1:11:50] meant it they meant it they Lord I'm
[1:11:54] done I'm done if you're done today with
[1:11:57] the world the Holy Ghost is for you you
[1:12:00] can be born again I don't care how long
[1:12:02] you've been here you can step into
[1:12:04] eternity today Hallelujah and and and
[1:12:07] and it's a and it's a Heavenly places
[1:12:09] with Christ Jesus oh my brother brandham
[1:12:12] says he says you know says there in the
[1:12:15] breach he said what does it do he says

[1:12:19] chasm Great Bridge across the chasm you
[1:12:22] had no way to get over to Christ but now

[1:12:28] and puts him on the other side of the
[1:12:30] chasm in the presence of God sitting in

[1:12:54] bridge it does away with the chasm and

[1:14:22] through your heart I I I I you know
[1:14:26] there I heard a story one time kind of
[1:14:28] an amusing story where a doctor and a
[1:14:30] lawyer they came to an old camp meeting
[1:14:33] Revival and they were buddies had been
[1:14:34] buddies for years and the old Preacher
[1:14:37] Man just was preaching for who wouldn't
[1:14:40] have it and he gave his altar called and
[1:14:42] man both them guys hit the old sawdust
[1:14:44] Trail brother Brooks they went up there
[1:14:46] and they fell down and the doctor was
[1:14:48] screaming out to God and the lawy you're
[1:14:49] screaming out to God and you know what
[1:14:51] within within within probably five
[1:14:53] minutes the doctor just stood up and
[1:14:54] said I'm free
