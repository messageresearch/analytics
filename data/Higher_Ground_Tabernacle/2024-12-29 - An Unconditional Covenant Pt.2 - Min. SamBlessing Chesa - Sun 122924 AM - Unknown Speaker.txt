========================================
[Music] Holy Name once again amen oh all I want to do is [Music] loveing so glad I feel his love for [Applause] me oh Jesus Paid the price of redemption oh all on the cross of [Music] calary so every day my heart will praise him I know I'll never be the same oh all I want to do is love him love is oh Holy Name hallelujah amen let's sing we'll open with prayer amen I just want to before pray want to give a a testimony amen how the amen the mercy of God and how the Lord just watches over us and you know I don't know if you remember brother Brandon giving the little story story about about that brother that was not a very good Hunter and uh but he needed the food so brother and him went hunting together and uh he wasn't a good Hunter so he didn't expect to get much but uh throughout the day he got us fill of whatever squirrels or whatever and he was walking home with his squirrels and he was crying and smiling and praising God because he was a bad Hunter but God gave him what he needed amen was able to so I felt like that this a this this weekend I um I'm not a car mechanic but sometimes I try and I get over my uh uh I do things that I probably couldn't do as a mechanic and I had my whole thinking I'm a mechanic I go on YouTube and I take apart my whole bumper on my car because I need to change the lights and uh of course you're following a guy on YouTube that kind of knows a little bit more than you but not that much more than you and I get this thing off and when I get this bumper off a bunch of pieces fall out and I don't know where they go and so I'm I'm in a I'm in a pickle I don't know what to do so I I go and I change the lights like I wanted to but now I need to put the bumper back on and all these extra pieces that I I didn't know where they went and uh I just asked the Lord for a little help because I'm um I'm I'm one of those people that um if a if I have a round Peg and a square hole I'm G to make it fit so putting this thing gently in there is not my strong point amen but uh I picked that up and I just put the bumper right up against it and hit that side hit that side and it all went in I my my wife was says someone was helping you because there's no way she knows me enough there's no way you could have done that and the extra pieces I just happened to look into YouTube and all of a sudden the guy has that piece in his hand he says it goes right here and I'm like well there you go I just put it there ended up I used everything that came out went back in I'm like praise God and I knew like that Hunter I'm not a mechanic and I knew the Lord was was was there so I just want to thank the Lord for that amen amen uh he's he's uh he's uh he's merciful and he's uh he didn't have to bless me amen but he he does and I just thank the Lord for that the other thing I was I was with brother Keith on last Monday I was with brother Keith we were talking just having Fellowship in the morning and and and uh I get we both get in our cars to leave and I back out behind brother Keith and I looked and there was no car so I backed out and all of a sudden when I backed out this car just went zooms right behind me and I almost hit it it was by the grace of God I didn't hit it and then brother Keith starts backing up while I'm still behind him because he thought that was me that left it was that car he starts backing up and all of a sudden I didn't know what to do he's heading towards my car my bumper he's heading towards my car and I'm like I didn't know to go forward go backwards I didn't know what to do and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit must have spoke to brother Keith and he Slams on the break because usually his his little he has a new enough car where it beeps when there's something you know in the back there that's that you're going to hit usually gives you a little beeping it didn't give him any beeping the Holy Spirit was his beeper and he just pressed on that break and we I don't know how close we were but he unrolls his window and I'm like in shock he's like that's the Holy Spirit just watching over us so I just again want to give glory and praise to our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah brother Keith you mind opening with a word of prayer amen hallelujah you love the Lord amen amen he doesn't have to do all these things for us amen and I just thank the Lord and and give him glory gory and

and mercy [Music] brought me through Amen Let Us stand upon our feet as we open the word of God just turn around to your neighbor and shake your their hand say are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen let us open our Bibles to the Book of Genesis chapter 17 want be verse 1 [Music] and9 the Bible reads and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I'm the old Mighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou sh be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham but thy name name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations I have made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their Generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger oh the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations may the Lord add blessings to reading of his word you might take those amen this morning we want to speak on a subject an unconditional Covenant that will be a part two we started part one um the past Wednesday Amen in the Bible that we read in the verse we read we see God coming to Abraham and he is saying I will make a covenant between me and you and I will multiply thee [Music] exceedingly and this Covenant he say this Covenant is not only between me and you but it is between you me and your seed that comes after you Hallelujah and the Covenant means a promise or it means a contract amen so God came down to give Abraham a covenant or we can say he came to give Abraham a contract that was saying it is for you and your seed and he said I Will Bless thee exceedingly when we look at Abraham Abraham did not ask for this Covenant he did not ask for this promise but God rich in Mercy he's the one who came to Abraham and he said I'm making this Covenant with you when we look where Abraham comes from Abraham was a heathen he worshiped Idols he was not morally a good person it's not because he did anything special but it was because of God's Amazing Grace he came and he predestinated him from the heathens from those Idol worshippers and he took him out and he say I'm making a covenant between you and me an Everlasting Covenant and throughout the whole Bible we see God made made a lot of covenants with the children of Israel but some of these covenants were conditional amen some of these conditions he said if you do this I will deliver you if you do that I will bless you but if you do not adher to what he said then you fulfill the Covenant then you f the blessing God promised the children of Israel he says I will take you out of the land of Egypt and I will take you into Canaan but whilst they were in Canaan they started murmuring and complaining and God says because you have murmured and complained [Music] you shall not see this promise you are not going into Canaan but your children will so they fulfilled the promise because it was a conditional Covenant so God saw that if I make a covenant with man that is 5050 that say I'll do this and you do that man has been proven all the time to fail their part and every time they fail their part they ful they fulfill the [Music] Covenant the Covenant is n effect but when it came to the Covenant of Abraham God said listen this Covenant has nothing to do with you this Covenant is all me because I know if I make you to take part in this Covenant you are going to mess it up so he said it is on me and the Bible says God swore by none greater but himself because he was the greatest there was and say I am making this Covenant with you so it does not matter what you do my Covenant will stand with you it doesn't matter how much you sin my Covenant will stand with you it does not matter what your children do but this Covenant that I'm giving you will stand because it is all on me Hallelujah and the prophet of God talks about this Covenant and he says it's a Covenant of Grace so God came and gave a Grace Covenant to Abraham and he says no matter what you do my grace is sufficient for you Hallelujah it doesn't matter how far gone you are my grace is enough to come and redeem you and my Mercy is enough for you that's why we sing your grace and mercy brought me through if it wasn't for Grace where would you be if it wasn't for God's mercy where would you be so God came and he gave Abraham a Grace Covenant but whilst they were still in the Old Testament they slew a [Music] beast and that was and that was part of the Covenant amen you see in the days of Abraham they were in a polytheistic religion where the people worshiped many gods they worshiped the sun god they worshiped the moon God they worshiped nature they worship their Idols so when you come and you say God we know God means an object of worship so they were worshiping everything and anything so when you said God God meant anything everything but God wanted to make himself known that's why he came and he called Abraham out and that's why he said I'm making a covenant with you so he could attach his name on Abraham and he SE that came after in all throughout the Bible we hear the children of the children of Israel praying they say the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that was his ENT identification to separate him from all the other gods that's why he called him out and he performed exploits with Abraham so when people ask who is that say it is the god of Abraham it is not an idol it is not the sun it is not the Moon it is the god of Abraham and the prophet of God tells us that all the children of Israel the children of Abraham they walk the same Journey that their father Abraham walked Hallelujah so if I walk the same Journey that Abraham walked I know I have a covenant with God I know I have a Grace Covenant with God and the same way he put his name on Abraham my father he put his name on you so you can be identified as your God so he is identified as your God when people see you walking they say it is his God when they see you living right they say it is impossible for people to do this but they can do it because he worships he worships the god of Isaac he worships the god of Richard he worships the god of Frank amen he wants his name to be identified with you so you got to walk cognizant of the fact that you are just not an ordinary person but you have been predestinated and you are walking in God's covenant and when he gave them a covenant he also gave them a name Covenant he called himself Jehovah Jehovah means becoming becoming that's what Jehovah means becoming what becoming Blank That's the name he gave the children of Israel he says my name is becoming when uh Moses went to the burning bush he asked he says when I go who am I going to say sent me and he said you tell them I am when you ask me what's my name I'll tell you my name is Sam but he said my name is I am he's waiting I am who I am that I am what was that for I am whoever you want me to become to you Hallelujah whatever you need him to be he is I am to you not I was but I am because he is the same yesterday today and forever that's why he gave them the name Jehovah Jehovah F in the blank when they needed Providence he says I'm Jehovah J I am your provider Hallelujah when Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac he said I am your provider and he provided a lamb when the children of Israel were sick they called on Jehovah Rafa he says I am your healer when they were getting into battle he says I am your banner Jehovah sh so he gave them a covenant name and because he gave them a covenant name God never ever breaks his Covenant he always comes through when you need him and he is always right on time and his children that he attached his name to throughout the Bible he does not call them ordinary but he uses special words like chosen he says you are called a chosen generation you are a peculiar people hallelujah pecul does not mean you are special than other people but it means when you go through things you don't go through them like them because you are peculiar you are special and when special people God's peculiar people when they call on the name of the Lord he always going to come down Hallelujah God will suspend nature for his own people when God created the Earth he says let there be light he put the solar system in place and he put all the seasons in place that's a process he put to nature but when it comes to his people God will make things different he can suspend nature he can stop the normal flow of things he can change processes of things for his peculiar people why because he has a covenant between you and me Hallelujah because he calls them his own when the children of Israel were coming out of Egypt they were faced with a red sea we know that water cannot separate you cannot put water next to water and you can draw a line that's that's a rule that God put that's a nature that God put wherever water is it has to mix but when the children of Israel was standing between a rock and a hard place God said I'm suspending nature he made a way between water there was water here and water here but the water could not mix he had to stop nature to deliver his children Hallelujah why because it was a covenant people we look at Joshua God put in a nature he put a process that the son come comes back around after 24 hours and when the sun says the moon comes out that's nature that God put when you say let there be light that's how he said it but when the children of Israel were fighting and Joshua was standing right there and he saw that they were losing the battle he stood and he decided to Define nature but because he was a son of the Covenant God had to respect his word and he stood there and he say sun stand still and for 24 hours the sun Stood Still in that place there was no Sunset while God was suspending nature for his Covenant children Hallelujah so if God could suspend nature for Joshua he can suspend nature for you too Hallelujah he can perform a miracle in your life amen amen glory we know the three Hebrew boys we know fire is supposed to be hot but when the children of God the children of Covenant they were about to get into that fire god separated the heat from the fire and that fire did not burn them it burned their tormentors and it burnt the chains that were binding them Hallelujah God will suspend nature for you they will tell you that cancer cannot be healed because that's what they think nature is but God can't suspend nature for you and he can deliver and he can heal [Music] you nature says an old woman cannot give birth but with Sarah God suspended nature she was Barren and she was old she had two things working against her suspended the natural flow of things because you are in a covenant you are going to give birth and Paul tells us that everything that's in the scripture in the Old Testament is for us as an example Hallelujah an example is for you to see that if God did it before he can do it again if he open the red se he can open my Red Sea you don't have to go around looking for Lakes to open but you know the Red Sea that you were going through and he can open that Red Sea you can say I'm not looking for a baby but your dead situation God can bring life to it because he can suspend nature you can say I'm not qualified for that job because they'll tell you we need 10 years experience Hallelujah cuz that's the nature of things for you to qualify for a job you need to have enough expertise for that job but I serve a God who can suspend the natural flow of things you can be hired for a job that you are unqualified for because you are a covenant child amen he keeps his Covenant he does not fail Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6 the Bible says even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness Galatians chapter 3 and verse 6 G therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached therefore the gospel to Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed going back to verse seven he says they which are the of Faith the same are the children of Abraham if you are of Faith you believe in God you are a child of Abraham don't let Satan tell you nothing else so every promise every Covenant that God gave to if you are in the faith it applies to you when he says I shall bless thee exceedingly you push your name there because you are Abraham's seed through faith when he says thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy through faith you believe and put your name right there because that Covenant and that promise applies to you amen amen in Abraham's Grace Covenant the prophet of God say his paragraph 39 and Abraham never received this promise whilst he was in whilst he was in circumcision under the law but when he was under grace before circumcision ever was issued therefore it's not it's not nothing that we could do to Merit it that's right it's God's grace that gives it to us by faith Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness the law is what men wanted not what God wanted amen so Abraham received the promise way before he was even circumcised he received Grace way before he was even taken out of the child the ends so we see this is a work that happened before the foundation of the world you were predestinated for ordained Sanctified and Justified whilst you were on the back part of God's mind that's when God gave you that Grace so you just came to a realization that this is what God did for you but it already happened before you was born God told Jeremiah before you were born before you were formed in your mother's womb I knew you where was he he was on the back part of God's mind Hallelujah and that's when he got that Grace and it's nothing that you can do to Merit it but it's his Amazing Grace he gives to us by faith and like Father Abraham did you get it by believing God Amen Galatians 3 verse 16 the Bible says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as for one and to thy seed which is Christ Hallelujah this is a covenant he made Abraham and the Paul is telling us that the seed he was talking about was not Ishmael or Isaac Isaac was just a shadow but this seed that was being promised which was the Covenant was to be made with was Jesus Christ and the verse 29 says and if ye be in Christ then ye are then are ye Abraham's seed and airs according to the promise so you have been made abrah seed through the promise through Christ so the promise that God gave Abraham did not end with Abraham and it came through Christ that's how it came to you and how did this Covenant become Grace because in the Old Testament we read about law and we start seeing Grace in the New Testament but it's not that Grace wasn't already there in the Old Testament Grace was already there that's how Abraham was saved that's how he was predestinated so to enact this Covenant you know when you make a contract when you sign for your car when you sign for a lease they give you a contract and you have to sign that contract amen amen so that contract is you signing and the issuer of the contract is also signing it so God when he made a covenant with Abraham he he was the issuer of the contract and Abraham was the recipient so after God made a covenant with Abraham he told him to go make a sacrifice and Abraham went to make the sacrifice as an [Music] enactment signing the this contract which was the Covenant that God made with him and in the orientals back in the um in the ancient times when they were signing a contract or making a covenant they would slay they would slay an animal and they would skin it and after skinning that animal they will take the skin and tear it apart [Music] perly because when you cut it perfectly you can easily take another part of another animal and you can bring it but they just tore it naturally and however way it tore one will take the other [Music] piece and the other person would take the other piece and they would go their separate ways amen let's say if I tear this paper this was not perfect and the only piece that can come and fit in here is this piece no matter how many pieces you tear 200 pieces of paper there is no other piece that can can come to fit in perfectly you only have to take this piece and bring it into perfectly dve tail so when they were making a covenant they would tear skin animal skin one goes their way one goes the other if they happen to have a dispute dispute or when they need to bring back up the at effects of the Covenant they made even if the person who made the Covenant died and it's come down Generations after they would come together the other party bring that piece and the other party brings the other piece and they have to confirm it by putting the pieces together and if the two pieces do not match it means there was a discrepancy in the Covenant someone is trying to be fraudulent but when they Feit perfectly then they know that this is the exact person that the Covenant was made with amen amen and in Jehovah jar the prophet of God says now Jesus became that sacrifice the sacrifice that Abraham made was a shadow and a type because it was a Grace Covenant it was a shadow and the type of Christ the ultimate sacrifice and the enactment of the Grace Covenant in the New Testament was the death of Christ on the cross of Calvary so the prophet of God is saying now Jesus became that sacrifice and he went to Calvary and God tore him apart on Calvary he tore his Soul and Spirit from his body and he raised up his body on the third [Music] day amen so on the cross of Calvary when Jesus died and he said it is finished the prophet of God is telling us that was God tearing his son apart he separated the body from the soul and from the spirit while his body lay in the grave he was in Hell overcoming death hell and the grave and Satan he had been torn apart and the prophet of God says and he raised his body on the third day and set it on his right in his own right hand so when Christ ascended he went to sit on the right hand side of the father and we know the right hand means Authority so he went to sit on the throne of the father on and he had Authority that's one piece and he sent back the same spirit that was upon him to work in his church to call Abraham's seed so he tore apart Jesus on the cross of Calvary the body ascended to be on the right hand side of the father and he sent the spirit back to the church that was the Grace Covenant he was making with his people and he sent back the same spirit that was upon him to work in his church Church to call Abraham seed you see as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the confirmation confirming it amen so that was the Grace Covenant God was making with us when he tore apart his son he said I'm giving you the Holy Ghost and I'll take the body which went to sit on the father's right hand and he made that Covenant with you and me that is the reality of the Grace Covenant that he was having with Abraham Abraham seed that Grace is for you that no matter what you do my grace is sufficient for you Hallelujah huj whatever you have gone through he says I will still come for you amen and in Jehovah J paragraph 53 he says now the church that professes to be a Christian Church will have to have the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ for at the resurrection of the the church Christ and his bride will come together and dve tail they have to fit so on the Resurrection Day when Christ comes for his bride and the Holy Ghost does in the bride they have to match Hallelujah and it cannot be any other peace except for the exact same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost that he gave to the first church and he says the Bri and it will come together and it has to dve tail the writings and the promises of God will be made fulfilled there so it cannot come together unless the same spirit that was in Christ is in you and me hey man if you can to have the next quote please the next part of 53 paragraph 53 says so it cannot come together unless the same spirit that was in Christ is in you and me so whatever Spirit you have if it is not the holy ghost that is not going to match up with Christ because it has to be the exact same amen anything else will not work and he says and then if that same spirit is in there it will do the same works and live the same kind of separated life and do the works that he did Hallelujah that's why he said Greater Works than these shall you do why because you have the spirit of Christ in you Paul says it is not I that live but it's Christ who lives in me amen the prophet of God tells us that what was in God was poured into Christ and what was in Christ was poured into the church so the same spirit that was in God it was living in Christ and then on the day of Pentecost that same Spirit he poured it into the church and we know that church is not the building but church is a people church is a called out people and this morning I'm looking at God's church I'm looking at God's called out called out of denominations called out of the systems of this world and he chose you to put his name on you so he could put his spirit in you and he is the one who is doing the works in you so Greater Works that he is doing that you are doing it's not you who's doing it but it is him who's doing it in you Hallelujah when Peter was when Peter was um walking on the along the Gate of beauer they had been filled with the Holy Ghost they had gotten that other piece of that inside of them amen they saw that lame man and they said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you and that lay Man's legs straightened up and he started walking Hallelujah why because they had that piece of the Covenant they had that part of Christ in them the same spirit that was in Christ had been in them Hallelujah in the resurrection of Jesus the prophet of God says now remember his Corporal body is the high priest that's sitting Before the Throne of God the Corporal body that Christ store on the cross of calvary and he took to have it on his right hand that's why the prophet is saying the Corporal body is the high priest that's setting Before the Throne of God with the blood making intercession his Spirit called the holy spirit is here living with us in our spirit doing the same things carrying the ministry that he started and he said I will be with you to the end of the world things that I do shall you also until the end of the world what was that he was making a covenant with you and me he says I will never ever leave you I will never forsake you because I am within you and my Covenant with you shall never fail Hallelujah so we thank God for his Grace Covenant because we know he never fails you might fail but he will not fail because he is known to be a covenant keeper God has a reputation to keep and his reputation is to never fail he never failed before so why is he going to start failing on you Hallelujah when you kneel down to pray you say Lord I know you've never failed so I know you're not going to start failing on me he gave a covenant he says if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he says I will hear from Heaven Hallelujah we don't serve a deaf and damn God but we serve a God that hears so when he hear he answers your prayer so every time you kneel down to pray know that God has a covenant with you right there he says humble yourself and if you pray he say I will hear from heaven and I will heal your land Hallelujah you don't have to fret you don't have to worry because he is a covenant keeping God in the Old Testament he gave them a covenant and he says you are Jehovah I'm I'm Jehovah to you fill in the blank when they needed whatever they needed they called Jehovah Rafa when they needed Providence they said I'm calling Jehovah so they had to think what situation am I in they have to think what am I going through if they were going through troubles they'll say I'm calling on Jehovah Shalom I need peace but today you don't have to scratch your head thinking to say which name should I call him on because remember Jesus is the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament so you don't have to scratch seeing which one should I call which name should I call but when you call on the name of Jesus you have called it all Hallelujah some singer said I call him all that because he is all that to me whatever I need I call on the name Jesus if I need Jehovah I say Jesus when I need healing I say Jesus when I need peace I call on the name Jesus because Jesus is Jehovah of the old and he is My All In All oh someone said he's water when I'm thirsty he is bread when I'm hungry he is my Bridge Over Troubled Water he is my lawyer in the courtroom he is the doctor in the sick room he is my all that because that's what he is that's the Covenant he has with you and me that he never ever fails when he had the Covenant with Abraham he came back at a later time and he says is there anything that is impossible with my God after after Sarah failed to ad her to the Covenant God asked a question he says is there anything that's too hard for the Lord hallelujah and we know that this was God in flesh God was asking a question and we know God is omniscient so why would God ask a question to something he already knows is because in the first place Sarah was asking the wrong question because when Sarah received the promise is it possible for a barren woman an old woman whose womb has dried up to have a to have a baby and the answer is obvious no it's not possible she was asking the wrong question but God was coming telling her the kind of question to ask and the question was is there anything that's too hard for the Lord hallelujah and the answer to that is obvious nothing is too hard for my God because we know the dry wom of Sarah it was quickened up and she gave birth to Isaac amen because there's nothing that's too hard for my Lord so when you are going through your situation don't ask the wrong question don't ask the question what the doctor is telling you say in this predicament I'm in in this depression I'm in can anyone who's going through what I'm going through survive this the answer is obvious no they cannot survive it but you ask the right question anything that's too hard for the Lord whatever you are going through whatever situation is there is nothing that's too hard for my God so you ask the right question because what is impossible with man possible with God hallelujah Glory when the when Gabriel came to marry she he said you shall have a baby and she says I don't know no man how can this be the angel said there is nothing that is impossible with God she said look at your cousin Elizabeth she's old she is Barren she has two things working against her but because there is nothing that's impossible with God she's already six months in so if God could do it for Elizabeth Mary said if God could do it for my cousin I know God can do it for me Hallelujah so you got to come up and you stand and say Lord if you heal that brother I know you can heal me too if you deliver shadra Mish and the B I know you can deliver me too if you open the womb of SAR if you open the womb of Rachel and I know you can open my womb to it doesn't have to be a physical womb but God can still Quicken you because he is a never failing God he keeps his Covenant so Seed of Abraham Seed of Abraham is there anything that's too hard for the Lord tell your say no no no there's nothing that's too hard for my God hallelujah so whatever you are going to ask the right question because that question already has an guaranteed answer and when God was asking that question he's telling you that there is a possibility that your situation can change when he walked up to that lay man he says will thou be made whole it's not because he didn't know if he could be made whole or not but he was asking him a question do you want to be made whole so when God is asking a question he's telling you that there is a possibility that your situation can change whatever state you are in it can be transform if you are sick there is a possibility that you can be healed if you are in lack there is a possibility that he can provide for you is there a possibility yes there is a possibility because there is nothing that's too hard for my God who is a covenant keeping God hallelujah let's stand upon our feet let's give the Lord a clip of Praise amen oh just turn around tell your neighbor again say there is nothing too hard for my God there is nothing too hard for my God we are getting to the end of 2024 with that realization that nothing amen it's too hard for our God because we are a covenant people [Music] and he never fails it amen amen as we getting into prayer let's sing we've been made
