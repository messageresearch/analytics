[0:01] Amen.

[0:07] so. I said let the redeemed say so.
[0:12] Amen. Are you glad to be a Christian?
[0:14] Amen. Glad to be saved.
[0:17] Sanctified. Amen. Filled with the Holy
[0:20] Ghost.
[0:21] Amen. God is good. Amen. That's what the
[0:25] song says. He's good all the time. Amen.
[0:28] Now, I'm not good all the time. And
[0:31] guess what? You ain't good all the time
[0:33] either. And I ain't always faithful.
[0:36] Think about that. I ain't always
[0:38] faithful.

[0:41] regardless, he's always faithful.
[0:45] Amen.

[1:19] Amen. You could be seated just for a

[1:24] myself why I'm going to do this to come
[1:26] up behind Isaiah Brooks and sing a song.
[1:29] Oh, could could just be
[1:34] Amen. But the reason I felt to sing this
[1:37] was strictly because I've never been
[1:39] here before. Amen. And I I've known
[1:41] Brother Isaiah. He's known me. He
[1:42] remembers me probably a lot uh further
[1:44] back than I remember him. Man, remember
[1:47] my dad traveling up and ministering for
[1:48] him there when he was in Lima. and
[1:50] certainly appreciate his ministry, not
[1:52] just through the uh what I've behind the
[1:54] pull pit, but also through song. He's
[1:56] been an inspiration, amen, to many many
[1:59] many many believers. Amen. You don't
[2:02] have to to you could go almost anywhere
[2:04] and mention the name Isaiah Brooks and

[2:10] for this invitation to come and Amen.
[2:13] And good to be here with you. My name is
[2:14] Brother Matt Watkins for those of you
[2:16] who don't know me. Amen. from Buford,
[2:18] South Carolina there, where my dad is
[2:19] the pastor and he brings his greetings
[2:21] and he was just here and told us so much
[2:23] about you all. Amen. And how good of a
[2:25] time that he had. And I have h four
[2:28] children back at home. Lovely wife and
[2:30] four kids, two boys and two girls. Our
[2:33] four and no more.
[2:37] Amen. Four is the number of
[2:40] deliverance. That's right. Oh, brother
[2:43] Isaiah's got us all beatated. Eight.
[2:46] Told him. And I said, "Boy, I thought I
[2:47] had a lot, but I I ministered somewhere
[2:49] one time and I had a Nissan Xterero,
[2:51] which was a five-seater car, and
[2:53] ministered for a brother, and we were
[2:55] having our fourth child." And the pastor
[2:56] told me, said, "Brother Manny," he said,
[2:57] "there's not a big difference between
[2:59] two kids and three." I said, "Really?"
[3:01] He said, "No, not really any difference
[3:03] at all." He said, "But there's a big
[3:04] difference between three and four." I
[3:07] said, "Oh, no." He said, "It's about as
[3:08] big as a
[3:09] [Laughter]
[3:12] minivan." And then the light bulb
[3:14] clicked.
[3:15] Amen. But uh we're certainly glad to be
[3:18] here with you and I'd like to sing this
[3:19] song because I guess if I could uh not
[3:21] take the time to give you my testimony,
[3:23] this song would be my testimony uh in in
[3:26] just a song. Amen.
[3:40] When you get to
[3:43] heaven after the trumpet
[3:49] sounds, if you decide to look me up,
[3:55] waste your
[3:57] time looking
[3:58] [Music]

[4:05] manion and you won't find me

[4:31] through the
[4:32] [Music]
[4:35] storm. I want to touch the hands that
[4:39] touched and completely changed my
[4:46] heart. I want to hear him speak the
[4:51] words that brought such peace to
[4:55] me. So just find

[5:12] gates, there be so much to see.
[5:19] And I'll
[5:21] behold manions tall and stroll down
[5:26] golden
[5:28] streets. Though the splendor will be
[5:33] amazing. There's only one
[5:37] attraction for
[5:39] me. Just find Jesus.
[5:45] There I
[5:48] be. Want to see the unseen arms that
[5:54] held me through the
[5:59] storms. I want to touch the hands that
[6:03] touched and completely changed my heart.
[6:10] Want to hear him speak the words that
[6:15] brought such
[6:17] peace to

[6:39] Give the Lord a hand clap of
[6:42] praise.
[6:46] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand to our feet.
[6:49] Let's all stand. Amen.
[6:52] Is that your testimony?
[6:55] My It means so much to me. Amen. Just
[6:58] find Jesus. I want to see the hands that
[7:01] held me through my storms. Those
[7:03] unseeded hands when you couldn't hold
[7:05] you, somebody was keeping you.
[7:08] when you were about to give up,
[7:10] something kept holding you. Amen. Are
[7:13] you thankful for that? I believe that's
[7:14] the testimony of any Christian. Amen. If
[7:17] you have your Bible, Amen. We'll just go
[7:19] straight to the word this morning. And
[7:21] again, we uh we're just so thankful to
[7:23] be here and thankful for brother Isaiah
[7:25] giving us this opportunity to come and
[7:27] speak. Amen. We'd like to look over uh
[7:30] into the book of 2 Samuel. If you have
[7:32] your Bible, we'll just turn there this
[7:34] morning.
[7:45] Amen. Just praying for the Lord for
[7:47] direction. Amen. Throughout the uh the
[7:49] coming days, knowing this uh this
[7:52] service would would come and and just
[7:54] wanting to to minister something that
[7:57] would be relevant to you, relevant to
[8:00] your life. Amen. And and you know, I
[8:03] could say this and I've said it many
[8:04] places that anything that brother Matt
[8:07] would preach would be really
[8:09] good.
[8:11] Hello. And it ain't because I'm a good
[8:13] preacher. It's because the word of God
[8:16] is so good. And anything I could bring
[8:19] out of here would be good because it's
[8:21] rich. You believe we have a rich word.
[8:23] And it's a deep, deep, deep well, a
[8:25] bottomless well that we can draw from.
[8:28] Amen. But I don't just want to preach
[8:30] something that would be good. Amen. And
[8:32] and not to come to impress anybody, but
[8:34] just to come and say something that
[8:35] would be specific in season. Amen. Right
[8:39] now, like Solomon said, a word fitly
[8:41] said, a word fitly spoken at the right
[8:44] time in the right season accomplishes
[8:46] the purpose that God has. You believe
[8:48] God has a purpose? You believe he has a
[8:51] purpose for these meetings, for this
[8:53] church, for your life, for your family?
[8:56] Amen. And I believe that his word, he
[8:58] says that cast your bread upon the water
[9:00] and it won't return unto you void, but
[9:03] it will accomplish the purpose that he
[9:06] intended. Amen. And so we just uh trying
[9:09] to be led of the spirit here and and um
[9:11] and and just pray that Lord would lead
[9:13] us. And so if you have your Bible, 2
[9:15] Samuel, Amen, chapter
[9:27] 11. Amen. Thank you, brother, for
[9:30] confirming what I would minister this
[9:32] this morning. You didn't know that last
[9:34] night when you said it. Amen. But just a
[9:36] minister waiting and being pulled in
[9:38] different directions. Amen. 2 Samuelap
[9:41] 11:1. And I'd like to preach to you on a
[9:43] time of war.
[9:46] A time of war. And it came to pass,
[9:49] verse one, it says, "And it came to pass
[9:51] after the year was
[9:53] expired." And no, notice we're going to
[9:55] come back to this here. So, just focus
[9:57] on what it says here. There's a lot uh
[9:59] going on, and we'll catch you up to
[10:00] speed at where uh the writer is at in 2
[10:03] Samuel 11 when he brings this. It says,
[10:05] "It came to pass after the year was
[10:07] expired, at the time when kings go forth
[10:10] to battle." So this would be springtime.
[10:13] Nissi meaning the beginning of months.
[10:15] This was uh we have seasons of winter,
[10:17] summer, spring. This would be spring
[10:20] that the Bible says it was a time when
[10:22] kings go forth to battle that David sent
[10:26] Joab and his servants with him and all
[10:29] Israel and they destroyed the children
[10:31] of Ammon and besieged
[10:33] Rabba. But David terried still at
[10:37] Jerusalem. My how many times I have
[10:40] looked at that part of that verse and
[10:42] just
[10:43] pondered and thought to myself what what
[10:47] was happening in this man's life man who
[10:50] the Bible writes so much about you could
[10:52] almost preach David's life in
[10:54] dispensations because it happens and and
[10:56] chronologically the the the the events
[10:59] that take place and the scripture
[11:00] records David from the time he's a
[11:02] little boy and we read about David and
[11:04] Goliath and David's ascension and and
[11:06] then his ascension to where he goes goes
[11:08] and he becomes an employee of King Saul
[11:10] and lives in his courts and sees many
[11:12] things growing up and then God takes him
[11:15] and then he ascends to the throne and
[11:17] then there's the rebellion and Saul
[11:18] trying to kill him and he takes the
[11:20] kingdom and and he has many great
[11:22] victories and then his life uh moves on
[11:24] down to different uh junctions if we
[11:27] could call it that. And this is a time
[11:30] here when the Bible says that is a time
[11:32] of war. And it says that David sends
[11:34] Joab. And it says, "But David terried
[11:37] still at Jerusalem. And it came to pass,
[11:40] verse two, in an evening tide that David
[11:43] arose from off his bed, walked upon the
[11:46] roof of the king's house. And from the
[11:48] roof he saw a woman washing herself, and
[11:50] the woman was very beautiful to look
[11:52] upon." David sent and inquired after the
[11:55] woman. And one said, "Is not this Ba'ath
[11:58] Sheeba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife
[12:01] of Uriah the Hitittite." David sent
[12:04] messengers and took her, and she came in
[12:06] unto him, and he lay with her, for she
[12:09] was purified from her uncleanness, and
[12:10] she returned unto her house. The woman
[12:13] conceived and sent and told David, and
[12:16] said, I am with child. David sent to
[12:19] Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the
[12:20] Hitittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
[12:23] Move on down to verse
[12:25] 15. And he wrote in the letter, saying,
[12:27] "Set Uriah in the forefront of the
[12:30] hottest battle, and retire you from him,
[12:32] that he may be smitten and die." Came to
[12:36] pass when Joab observed the city that he
[12:38] assigned Uriah to a place where he knew
[12:40] that valiant men were. men of the city
[12:43] went out and fought with Joab, and there
[12:45] fell some of the people of the servants
[12:47] of David, and Uriah the Hitittite died
[12:51] also. Ecclesiastes, if you have your
[12:53] Bible, just turn there
[12:56] over to the book of
[13:04] Ecclesiastes, chapter
[13:07] 3, Ecclesiastes 3. Amen. Am I restricted
[13:11] by time this morning, brother Isaiah? Do
[13:12] we have something after this? Okay.
[13:15] Amen. We don't put God in the box
[13:18] because he'll break right out of it.
[13:21] Amen. Chapter 3 verse one. To
[13:25] everything. Somebody say everything.
[13:27] Everything. To everything. There is a
[13:31] season and a time. To every purpose
[13:35] under the heaven. Amen. A time to be
[13:38] born and a time to die. time to plant
[13:40] and a time to pluck up that which is
[13:42] planted. Time to kill and a time to
[13:44] heal. A time to break down and a time to
[13:47] build
[13:48] up. Ver chapter uh I'm sorry, verse 8
[13:51] says, "A time to love and a time to
[13:55] hate, a time of
[13:58] war and a time of peace." We'll read
[14:01] that again. A time to love and a time to
[14:05] hate. a time of war and a time of peace.
[14:10] Amen. Let's just bow our heads this
[14:11] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just
[14:15] surrender ourselves as best we know how,
[14:18] Lord Jesus. We're so aware, Lord God, of
[14:21] our own human weakness and our own human
[14:24] frailty, Lord, in the inability that we
[14:26] have to complete the task that you've
[14:28] laid before us. For God, I could speak
[14:31] many words this morning and it might
[14:32] would go to the level of the flesh,
[14:35] Father, or even strike the emotion of an
[14:37] individual, Lord. But we need to reach a
[14:39] realm that's much further than that this
[14:41] morning. We need to touch the soul of
[14:44] clay, Lord. And so we come, God,
[14:47] knowing, Lord Jesus, that that's an
[14:49] impossible task for us. So we do all we
[14:52] know how to do, Lord. We humble
[14:54] ourselves and we surrender Lord and we
[14:58] relax in your presence this morning and
[15:01] we ask dear God that your word which is
[15:03] quick meaning that it's alive sharper
[15:06] than any two-edged sword and Lord it can
[15:08] divide us under and pierce straight to
[15:11] the very soul of a person Lord and you
[15:13] know why you would direct a servant to
[15:15] minister Father and to go into this
[15:17] direction Lord so I just commit that to
[15:19] you Father may you speak tonight Lord I
[15:22] I've realized Lord Lord, over time that
[15:24] the words of man, Father, they they can
[15:27] only go so far, Lord. For maybe I would
[15:29] preach this morning for an hour long,
[15:31] Lord, and and and people would rejoice
[15:33] and enjoy it, Lord. But even in just a
[15:35] couple uh months time, maybe every
[15:38] person would forget every word that I
[15:40] spoke and maybe only remember my
[15:42] subject, my scripture, Lord. But if you
[15:45] would speak a word this morning, oh God,
[15:47] and if your mouth would open and you
[15:49] would speak, Lord God, Father, I pray
[15:52] that and I believe it would have an
[15:53] eternal an eternal value, oh God, it
[15:56] would have an eternal benefit, Lord
[15:58] Jesus. So we ask, Lord God, that you
[16:01] would come and feed our thirsty souls as
[16:03] we raise our hands and surrender. And we
[16:05] come say it to you, Lord. We're thirsty
[16:07] for your word. We're hungry, oh God. May
[16:11] you give us the bread of life, Lord
[16:12] Jesus. For it alone can satisfy and
[16:15] quench the thirst of a believer, God. I
[16:18] pray that you would just take complete
[16:19] control now, control of this vessel, the
[16:22] hearer, the speaker, Lord. And may it
[16:24] all be for your glory, Lord. We ask it
[16:26] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be
[16:34] seated. Amen. we would we could lay a a
[16:37] foundation in this and come to such a
[16:39] simple point that I believe is
[16:42] universally we would accept this and and
[16:45] and it's such a foundational truth and
[16:48] that is that you cannot hide from God.
[16:52] Amen. You know it's an amazing thing but
[16:54] the Bible says in Ecclesiastes chapter 8
[16:57] and you don't need to turn here. I'll
[16:58] just reference these scriptures. It says
[17:00] because sence against an evil work is
[17:03] not executed speedily. Therefore, the
[17:06] heart of the sons of men is fully set in
[17:08] them to do evil. And what Solomon is
[17:11] saying here is that just because sence
[17:14] is not passed immediately does not mean
[17:18] that sence is not coming. But we know
[17:21] with the law of God, time takes its
[17:24] toll. Amen. And while the Bible says
[17:27] that whatsoever a man sws, he shall also
[17:29] reap, that doesn't mean that we'll reap
[17:32] what we sow the very next day or the
[17:34] very next week. But many times with God,
[17:37] it can take months. It can take years
[17:40] for a seed to come to harvest and for
[17:42] you to realize any manifestation of the
[17:45] seed that you plant. And that's what
[17:47] Solomon is saying. He says that because
[17:49] sentence is not executed speedily,
[17:51] therefore the heart of a man almost
[17:54] thinks, well, you know, I guess I got
[17:55] away with it and, you know, I guess it's
[17:57] okay and and I guess I've slipped by and
[18:00] you know, I guess I guess I'm not going
[18:02] to pay for what I've for what I've done.
[18:04] But God says, don't be a fool. God will
[18:07] not be mocked. Whatsoever you sow, you
[18:10] will reap.
[18:12] And I believe sin is one of the most
[18:14] relevant subjects we could preach on.
[18:17] Though some might would water it down
[18:18] and say, you know, that's something
[18:20] that's so foundational and we need to
[18:22] stay away from that subject and move on
[18:24] into deeper things. I believe sin while
[18:26] you're in this flesh will be a relevant
[18:29] topic throughout your life
[18:32] because because we know that we're
[18:33] forgiven of sin. But Paul said within me
[18:36] lies a law that in my members while I
[18:39] want to do good, while the soul craves
[18:40] for good, there's in my members
[18:43] something that's waring against my
[18:44] flesh.
[18:46] And I believe that sin is one of the
[18:48] most awful things. Yeah. The effects of
[18:51] sin in someone's life and the effects of
[18:53] unconfessed sin in someone's life.
[18:56] Numbers 32 says this, "If you will not
[18:58] do so, behold, you have sinned against
[19:00] the Lord. And be sure your sin will find
[19:05] you out." Amen. What is a what an
[19:09] amazing picture that the Bible paints of
[19:12] almost the fugitive that goes on the run
[19:15] and he begins he he you know you take
[19:17] the man and he commits some crime and he
[19:20] goes on the run from the law and and he
[19:22] runs for years and you know he may he
[19:24] may get away with it from the local
[19:26] authorities and and cover up the
[19:28] evidence and you know you watch that man
[19:30] as he begins to go on the run. He
[19:32] changes his identity and you know he
[19:34] might try to get a new social security
[19:36] number and he changes his hairstyle and
[19:38] maybe grows a beard and he's trying to
[19:41] erase the identity of his guilt and you
[19:44] know he runs and he runs and he's a
[19:46] fugitive on the law but the Bible says
[19:48] your sin will follow you and your sin
[19:51] will chase you and your sin will
[19:53] investigate you and be sure you it'll
[19:56] find you and if the law can't find him
[19:59] they'll turn it over to the FBI and then
[20:01] they'll turn over to greater
[20:02] authorities. And you know, the man may
[20:05] have a sense of false freedom. He may
[20:07] have a sense that he's free and he has a
[20:09] new start in life. And you know, he can
[20:11] just start all over. But the Bible says
[20:13] one day your sin will haunt you and it
[20:16] will chase you and it will always be
[20:18] behind you. And the Bible says if your
[20:21] if our hearts condemn us not, then we
[20:24] can have faith and ask whatsoever we
[20:26] want. But the problem with sin and guilt
[20:29] unconfessed is that our hearts condemn
[20:32] us. Therefore, it's impossible to have
[20:34] faith.
[20:36] Amen. Isaiah 59:12 says, "Behold, the
[20:39] Lord's hand is not short that it cannot
[20:42] save, neither is his ear heavy that it
[20:45] cannot hear." I'm thankful for that.
[20:46] Amen. But your iniquities have
[20:50] separated. Notice this. Your iniquities
[20:53] have separated between you and your God.
[20:56] and your
[20:58] sins have hid his face from you.
[21:03] That he will not hear.
[21:06] I couldn't imagine anything more
[21:08] terrifying than for God to hide his face
[21:11] from my life. As the Bible says, what's
[21:14] the problem? His ears not heavy. His
[21:16] hands not short. But the problem is is
[21:18] that your sins have hidden God from you.
[21:21] And he can't see you. He can't hear you.
[21:23] He can't act for you. He can't operate
[21:25] for you. He says, "Because your sins
[21:27] have separated, you say, "Well, I'm born
[21:29] again. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost."
[21:31] The Bible says, "Grieve not the Holy
[21:34] Ghost, whereby you're sealed to the day
[21:36] of your redemption." So, there's
[21:38] actually things as a Christian that we
[21:40] can do in our life to literally grieve
[21:43] the presence of God away that he won't
[21:45] hear our prayers, that his presence is
[21:47] not there, that we're not the same. And
[21:50] God says, "Your sins have hidden his
[21:53] face from you." Job 34 says, "His eyes
[21:56] are upon the ways of man, and he seeth
[22:00] all his goingings. There is no darkness,
[22:03] nor shadow of death, where the workers
[22:05] of iniquity may hide
[22:07] themselves." So this sin and secret sin
[22:11] causes this effect in the beginning to
[22:13] hide from the presence of God. We notice
[22:16] this is one of the first attributes in
[22:18] the fall. When Adam falls, the Bible
[22:20] says that fear and hiding was one of the
[22:23] first attributes. Notice that by sin
[22:26] naturally, he was not taught this. He
[22:28] was not told this. He didn't read it in
[22:30] a book. But sin immediately brought a
[22:33] guilt on the conscious of the believer.
[22:35] And it caused that person to hide from
[22:38] God.
[22:40] Adam, Adam, where art thou? I was afraid
[22:42] and so I hid myself. And so sin causes
[22:46] us to hide oursel from God. Unconfessed
[22:49] sin causes us to shut in, to go into the
[22:52] darkness, to turn off the lights, to
[22:54] stay away. And it causes to push us out
[22:56] of the presence of God.
[22:59] But it's so amazing that this is the
[23:01] automatic response of a believer when he
[23:03] sins. The automatic response is to hide.
[23:06] The automatic response is to shut away.
[23:08] The automatic response is to run and to
[23:11] move away. But it's amazing to me that
[23:13] God says in the book of Hebrews, "Let us
[23:16] therefore come boldly
[23:21] unto the throne of grace."
[23:24] Now, when so many times people have this
[23:26] scripture so backwards of what the
[23:28] Paul's even speaking of, we think, you
[23:30] know, I come boldly, you know, brother
[23:31] Isaiah, after I've read my Bible and
[23:33] I've prayed for hours and I'm feeling
[23:35] spiritual, I'm coming out of revival and
[23:38] then I can march boldly and bust open
[23:40] the doors to the throne of
[23:43] grace. Do you realize that is not the
[23:45] context at all of what Paul is saying?
[23:48] Listen to this. He says, "Let us
[23:50] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[23:53] grace that we may
[23:56] obtain mercy
[24:00] and find grace to help." Hallelujah. In
[24:05] the time of need.
[24:07] Oh, when God is saying, "Come unto me."
[24:10] When the devil causes sin and the devil
[24:13] causes a hiding and tries to push you in
[24:15] a closet and turn the lights out and
[24:17] stay away and run from God, God says,
[24:20] "Come boldly unto my throne because
[24:23] there's forgiveness." Hallelujah.
[24:27] If we sin, we have an advocate with the
[24:30] father who is faithful and just to
[24:32] forgive us and cleanse us
[24:36] from
[24:37] unrighteousness. But that is exactly
[24:40] what happens through sin is sin wants to
[24:42] push us away. That's why homosexuality
[24:45] has been termed in the closet because
[24:48] there was a reason that person went in
[24:49] the closet because they were ashamed of
[24:52] something something in their life. They
[24:54] wanted to cover something in their life
[24:56] they wanted to you know to try to hide
[24:58] away. Listen there is no there is
[25:00] nothing I believe as a Christian we
[25:03] should be the most transparent people on
[25:06] planet earth.
[25:09] Hallelujah.
[25:11] I believe that honesty and let me just
[25:13] slow down less I I just skip right over
[25:16] this. The heart of what I'm trying to
[25:18] minister to you. One of the greatest
[25:20] victories, listen close. One of the
[25:23] greatest victories God can bring forth
[25:25] in your life is honesty.
[25:32] One of the greatest victories that God
[25:34] can bring for a believer that will give
[25:36] them freedom to go forward is total
[25:41] transparency and total honesty before
[25:44] God and all men and all women.
[25:49] You know, I believe we should be the
[25:51] most transparent, honest people because
[25:54] there's nothing to hide.
[25:56] You know, I I I get leery and you know,
[25:59] you can almost become uh uh suspicious
[26:02] of a person. You ever get around people
[26:04] and you feel like you can never get to
[26:05] know them,
[26:07] feel like you can never really get to
[26:08] know who they are and never really get
[26:10] to know who they are as a person. You
[26:12] know, that always me. I like to see a
[26:14] person and to to meet a person who I
[26:17] know who they are and they're not afraid
[26:19] to show who they are and be themselves.
[26:23] You take a man who's an actor and he
[26:25] tries to be somebody else, there's a
[26:27] reason. It's because there's a shame of
[26:29] who he is.
[26:32] But I believe that as a believer and as
[26:34] a servant of God and as Christians, we
[26:36] should be an open book. You say, "Why,
[26:39] brother Matt?" Because we have nothing
[26:41] to hide. Because we're all sinners saved
[26:44] by grace. Because we're all wretched and
[26:47] vile and corrupt and outside of God's
[26:50] mercy. And outside of God's grace, we're
[26:54] nothing anyways.
[26:56] Hallelujah.
[27:00] I believe that honesty, total honesty,
[27:02] when you can look at your husband and
[27:04] you can say, "There's nothing I'm
[27:06] hiding." When you can look at your wife
[27:08] and there's total honesty and to say,
[27:10] "There's nothing." You can look at your
[27:12] pastor and your church. Then you can
[27:14] look at God and have faith to ask
[27:17] whatsoever you want. Amen. Amen.
[27:21] I believe one of the greatest victories
[27:22] God could do for a believer is to work a
[27:25] victory and total honesty.
[27:28] Renouncing dishonesty in the former
[27:30] things of a hidden life. We are not
[27:32] living a life that is in the closet as
[27:35] Christians, but as believers, we love
[27:38] the light. We're children of the light.
[27:42] We love exposure. We love to be exposed
[27:45] before God to say to our sermon here
[27:48] this morning. Cain's unconfessed sin
[27:50] turns him into a fugitive
[27:53] and it shall become thy master. His sin
[27:57] takes him away to a vagabond. A fugitive
[28:01] and he becomes a wanderer. A wanderer
[28:03] are those who really have no direction
[28:07] in life.
[28:08] They continue going in circles searching
[28:11] for old landmarks trying to find their
[28:13] rightful place. But there's an
[28:15] unsettlness inside that person and they
[28:17] can never feel secure or stable in
[28:20] anything. They're unstable in
[28:22] relationships. They're unstable in
[28:23] churches. They're unstable in
[28:26] marriages. In in every aspect of their
[28:28] life, they're
[28:30] unstable because there's a wondering
[28:32] heart.
[28:35] Sin causes this wondering sin cycle. You
[28:38] know what a sin cycle is? It's that
[28:40] cycle where you go commit a sin and then
[28:42] you repent and then you go commit that
[28:44] same exact sin and then you repent and
[28:46] then you go commit that same exact sin
[28:48] and then you repent and then do I need
[28:50] to keep going.
[28:52] What are you lacking? You're lacking
[28:54] what the prophet of God called a vday.
[28:57] A victory day to where you have victory
[29:00] over that cycle. And you can say it's no
[29:03] longer I that liveth but Christ that
[29:05] liveth through me.
[29:10] Sin has this searing conscious searing
[29:12] effect. As the Bible says that in the
[29:14] latter times Timothy some shall depart
[29:17] from the faith giving heed to seducing
[29:20] spirits and doctrines of devils speaking
[29:22] lies and hypocrisy having their
[29:24] conscience.
[29:29] Amen. Amen.
[29:32] Seared with a hotter.
[29:34] This is what the effect of sin does in a
[29:37] believer's life. I'm not talking about
[29:38] an unbeliever because they don't sin. As
[29:41] the prophet of God said, they are sin.
[29:44] Christians are the only ones who can
[29:45] backslide. Christians are the only one
[29:48] who can come out of fellowship with God.
[29:50] Christians are the only one who can
[29:52] grieve away the presence of God from
[29:53] their life. And sin has a searing
[29:56] effect.
[29:58] As the song says, sin is a captive. It
[30:01] binds it. It puts chains on a person.
[30:04] This is what the devil wants in your
[30:06] life. He knows he's not going to get you
[30:08] to walk away from the faith. But if he
[30:10] can wrap you around with chains of
[30:12] bondage and a weight of sin, what is the
[30:15] heaviest burden and weight that a person
[30:17] carries? The consciousness or the guilt
[30:20] of their past. Many people accept the
[30:23] forgiveness of God, but they can never
[30:25] forgive themselves. You take a person
[30:27] who doesn't know how to hug. You ever
[30:29] met a person who doesn't know how to
[30:30] hug? Brother Isaiah, it is one of the
[30:32] most awkward, uncomfortable moments I've
[30:34] ever had in my life.
[30:39] Ever hug somebody who doesn't know how
[30:40] to hug? It's sort of like when we don't
[30:43] know how to embrace what God is giving
[30:45] us. We don't know how to take grace and
[30:48] accept it for ourselves. Oh, we forgive
[30:51] have the forgiveness of God, but do we
[30:53] forgive ourselves?
[30:57] Take a person who doesn't know how to
[30:58] hug and you go to hug them. Boy, it's so
[31:00] awkward. And they go to hug and and you
[31:02] know and and then they they embrace and
[31:04] sort of like almost like a robot. Yeah.
[31:09] Nobody ever had that happen.
[31:12] You walk away and you go, "What was that
[31:14] all about?"
[31:16] But you ever meet somebody who knows how
[31:18] to hug, man, they just grab you and
[31:20] embrace you because they're not
[31:22] uncomfortable embracing. And so many
[31:25] people when grace is preached, they
[31:27] almost don't know how to receive it.
[31:30] You know what you ought to do? Give up.
[31:34] Surrender. Amen. Hallelujah.
[31:38] But many people are bound by the
[31:39] consciousness of their sin. That's what
[31:41] I'm preaching to you this morning is
[31:42] that Satan has people bound by the
[31:45] consciousness and the guilt. The Bible
[31:47] says the worshipper once purged is free
[31:49] from the consciousness of his sin.
[31:52] Meaning he's free of the guilt of his
[31:54] past because God gives him a revelation.
[31:57] You're justified as though you never did
[31:59] it in the first place. Hallelujah.
[32:02] Hallelujah.
[32:05] Hallelujah.
[32:07] Many people I heard a man talk about one
[32:09] time the spirit of a python. That python
[32:11] takes its prey and it doesn't have a
[32:13] venomous bite, but what it does is it
[32:16] constricts the spray to death. It wraps
[32:18] its coils around that victim. And with
[32:21] every breath that breathes in, it gets a
[32:24] little tighter. And every breath that
[32:26] breathes in gets a little tighter. This
[32:30] is like the grip of sin. It gets a
[32:32] little tighter. A little tighter.
[32:36] After a while, you come to church like
[32:38] this.
[32:42] Let's raise our hands and praise the
[32:43] Lord.
[32:50] You become anemic, become pale. But God
[32:54] is here to break the grip of the python.
[32:56] My Bible says, "Whoever the sun sets
[32:58] free is free indeed."
[33:01] Hallelujah. Whoever the son sets free is
[33:04] free.
[33:06] Oh my. We got to get to our sermon. The
[33:09] sin of David and Ba Sheba. Turn back to
[33:11] 2 Samuel. If you have your Bible, just
[33:14] keep it open there. We're going to deal
[33:15] with that for a minute.
[33:16] 2 Samuel 11:1. This sin with David and
[33:20] Ba'ath Sheba, I love hearing the Bible
[33:22] how the Bible so clearly. They've made
[33:24] movies about this and Hollywood's
[33:25] created films. It's amazing to me
[33:27] whenever Hollywood creates a Bible
[33:29] account like David and Ba'ath Sheba. The
[33:31] entire movie is focused around the act
[33:33] and the sin that took place. Yet the
[33:35] Bible spends one verse talking about it,
[33:38] but it spends chapter after chapter
[33:40] after chapter telling us the consequence
[33:43] and the collateral damage of that one
[33:46] sin. See, the Bible never wants to
[33:49] glorify sin or cause us to lust for
[33:51] things. But the Bible says that these
[33:53] things were written for our examples to
[33:55] the intent that we shouldn't lust as
[33:56] they lusted and fall as they fell. 2
[33:59] Samuel uh chapter 11, notice what it
[34:02] says here. It came to pass after the
[34:04] year was
[34:05] expired at the time when kings go forth
[34:10] to battle. This season is so important
[34:13] when David, the Bible says this is a
[34:17] time of Nissi, the beginning of months,
[34:20] the year's expired. It's springtime. You
[34:22] say, "Why is that important, brother
[34:24] Matt?" Because you see, for a king, you
[34:26] don't just go to war and start a
[34:28] campaign any time in the year. Amen. But
[34:31] as a king, David knew that there was a
[34:34] time in the year when there was a time
[34:37] of rest. As Solomon says, there's a time
[34:39] of peace. There's a time of rest. And
[34:41] David knew he had as a king, it was
[34:44] necessary that he had the ability to
[34:47] discern the season he was living in.
[34:50] Because if he failed to discern the
[34:52] season, he would be at peace when it's a
[34:55] time of war. And he would try to go to
[34:57] battle when it was a time of peace. But
[34:59] you see, for the king, it's important
[35:02] that he has the ability to discern the
[35:05] season that he's living in. You see, you
[35:08] don't start your campaign at war in the
[35:10] middle of summer. Especially not in
[35:12] Buford, South Carolina, when it's 100°
[35:14] and 130% humidity and there's bugs and
[35:17] there's snakes and there's every kind of
[35:19] spider you can imagine. You don't take
[35:21] your men to war during that time because
[35:24] the season is not in season to go to
[35:26] war. Amen. You don't start your war as
[35:29] Napoleon tried to do. You don't start
[35:32] your war in the time of winter when
[35:34] there's no fruit and there's nothing
[35:36] growing and everything's dead because
[35:39] why? You take your men to war, there's
[35:40] nothing to eat naturally and they
[35:42] expire. They die in the wilderness.
[35:45] But there was a specific season and I
[35:48] want you to focus in on this this
[35:49] morning. There was a specific season
[35:51] that came around to when a king could
[35:54] just feel something change and he feels
[35:56] the atmosphere and the barometric
[35:58] pressure outside sort of drop. A cold
[36:00] wind sort of blows through. He sees
[36:02] those flowers starting to bloom and
[36:04] those neon colors coming and that king
[36:06] suddenly his hands start to shake. He
[36:08] looks over at his shield and his sword
[36:10] and he says, "Captains, I think it's
[36:13] it's about getting time.
[36:16] We've been in Jerusalem long enough.
[36:18] We've been here in a in a time of peace
[36:20] long enough. We've been here relaxed,
[36:22] doing nothing long enough. I think that
[36:25] feeling of war is starting to come
[36:26] around. And David began to rally. This
[36:29] was early in his ministry. He he began
[36:31] to rally his troops and begin to to get
[36:33] out and start doing exercise and and
[36:35] start doing war games and and
[36:37] skirmishes. And what was he doing? He
[36:39] was preparing his men because the season
[36:42] of war was coming.
[36:46] And it was an important time when war
[36:48] came because other kings came to battle
[36:51] and they they encamped against Israel.
[36:54] And it was important for that king to
[36:55] discern the season he was living in.
[36:57] Amen. You know, I'm a hunter back home.
[36:59] That's one of my passions in life. And I
[37:01] can tell you this, any hunter knows I
[37:03] don't have to look at a calendar to tell
[37:05] to you to tell when it's hunting season.
[37:07] But there's a certain feeling that that
[37:08] happens. There's a certain Are you with
[37:11] me this morning? There's a certain
[37:12] breeze and certain feeling that you feel
[37:15] and you start longing for the the woods
[37:17] and start longing for those times. And
[37:18] if you do not, you wouldn't know what
[37:20] I'm talking about. But this is what it
[37:22] was like for a king. He felt the season
[37:24] was changing. He feels the winds of war
[37:27] blowing. He sees the chaos and the
[37:29] turmoil and the negativity around the
[37:32] kingdoms. And David says, "I think it's
[37:35] time to war. And David starts praying,
[37:38] "Teach my hands, Lord, to war. Teach my
[37:41] hands, oh God, to war."
[37:44] But what happens to David in this
[37:47] time? The Bible says, "When that season
[37:49] comes around,
[37:52] David stays at home." And the Bible says
[37:55] in verse one, came to pass when the tim
[37:58] time when kings go forth to battle that
[38:01] David sent Joab and his servants with
[38:03] them and all Israel and they destroyed
[38:05] the children of Ammon and besieged
[38:06] Rabba. But David, David, why? Why,
[38:09] David? I ask the question every time I
[38:12] preach this sermon, why David? Why? What
[38:15] was happening in your life that was so
[38:17] important? Yeah. What was happening in
[38:20] your life that distracted you to such a
[38:22] place that you failed to discern?
[38:24] There's enemies gathering around the
[38:26] kingdom, David. There's enemies and
[38:28] they're sayings and they're making
[38:30] accusations against you. It's not a time
[38:32] to be at Jerusalem, David. It's a time
[38:35] to grab the sword.
[38:38] Oh, are you hearing me today, friends? I
[38:41] hope I wake and pinch your conscious
[38:42] this morning. We are not in a season of
[38:46] peace.
[38:47] This is a time of war.
[38:50] This is a battle. This is a an
[38:52] atmosphere of war.
[38:56] This is an atmosphere where there's
[38:58] negativity and dissension amongst
[39:00] believers. This is an atmosphere. The
[39:02] Bible Brother said this would be the
[39:04] greatest battle ever fought. Oh, I used
[39:07] to think I knew what that meant 10 years
[39:09] ago. Now I realize I know what it means.
[39:13] that the greatest battle would ever be
[39:15] fought would be right here in the mind
[39:17] to where doubt and and fears that the
[39:20] devil starts attacking our mind through
[39:22] the airwaves and the internet and things
[39:23] we read and things we hear about it. And
[39:27] now the age of the war is not what we
[39:29] wrestle against flesh and blood, but
[39:31] it's principality, spiritual wickedness
[39:34] in high places.
[39:37] And it's a time of battle. It's a time
[39:39] of war. It's a time of fussing. It's a
[39:42] time of dissension.
[39:44] Yes. It's a time of negativity.
[39:47] Never did we realize this would be the
[39:49] greatest battle ever fought. This is
[39:51] exactly where Christ had to win the
[39:53] battle at Calvary. The Bible says he was
[39:56] crucified on Goltha, which means the
[39:59] place of the skull.
[40:02] Imagine that the greatest victory he
[40:04] would have would be the place of the
[40:07] skull. Yes. And what was the victory?
[40:12] What was the victory? The victory was
[40:15] over himself that he could say, "Not my
[40:18] will, not what I think, but your will be
[40:21] done, oh God, not what I want, not my
[40:23] dreams or ambitions,
[40:26] but I surrender my human will to a
[40:29] divine purpose."
[40:32] And this is exactly what's happening
[40:34] today, friends. The battle is the place
[40:35] of the skull. And this is where so many
[40:38] people because they don't have the
[40:39] fortitude of the Holy Ghost inside the
[40:42] soul. Yeah.
[40:44] Doubts and fears. Oh, we got to move
[40:46] past this.
[40:50] This is a time of war, David. It's not a
[40:52] time to be at home streaming.
[40:56] Hello, somebody.
[40:58] It's not a time to be in the stream.
[41:00] It's a time to be in the river.
[41:03] Hallelujah. Amen. It's a time to be
[41:05] under the fountain.
[41:08] It's not a time to be a Jerusalem,
[41:10] David. Lazy, spiritual, lukewarmness.
[41:14] It's not a time for that, David. Your
[41:16] men are dependent upon you. Your family
[41:18] is dependent upon you. Your wife and
[41:22] your children are dependent upon you,
[41:24] David. Oh, who's on the Lord's side
[41:26] amongst you?
[41:30] David, it's not a time to be in
[41:32] Jerusalem, Dad. A time when dads go to
[41:35] battle. A time when moms go to battle. A
[41:36] time when pastors and ministers hold the
[41:39] bloodstained banner of Christ.
[41:43] It's not a time to compromise.
[41:45] It's not a time to go back and say,
[41:47] well, you know, let's get away from the
[41:49] principles of the message and move to
[41:50] the Bible. What do you think the message
[41:53] is? It is the person of the Bible. It is
[41:58] Christ.
[42:02] Oh, it's a time to loosen up and you
[42:04] know and lack standards and you know
[42:05] those things aren't so important
[42:07] anymore. Friend, let me tell you, it's a
[42:09] time to get back to the ancient
[42:11] landmarks. It's a time to get back to
[42:13] the word. What is the cure for sin? Get
[42:17] back to the word.
[42:24] Oh my, I'm pulled in so many directions
[42:26] this morning. Pray for me.
[42:30] The Bible says it was a time when kings
[42:32] go to war. Wasn't a time to stay home.
[42:34] But David, you decided to stay home.
[42:39] This is so different from the David that
[42:40] we read about. This is so different. And
[42:43] we're going to get into this maybe the
[42:44] next service that we preach. so
[42:45] different from the from the David that
[42:47] we read about just years and before when
[42:50] David grows up and he and he's there and
[42:52] he's in Saul's house and God is showing
[42:55] David things and and David moves from
[42:57] there into the field and and there's a
[42:59] great challenge against Israel, this
[43:01] Goliath, this great giant and the giant
[43:04] screaming out and saying, "Send me a man
[43:07] that'll war with me, that'll fight with
[43:09] me." And David has faith and courage
[43:11] inside of his heart.
[43:14] David says, "Who is
[43:16] this uncircumcised Philistine
[43:20] that's defying the armies of the living
[43:23] God?
[43:25] Who is this? For today I'll slay you and
[43:28] I'll cut your head off with my sword,
[43:30] with your
[43:31] sword." What was this confidence and
[43:35] this faith that David possessed? Was
[43:37] David just uh disrespectful? Was he just
[43:40] speaking out of turn? Was he a smart
[43:42] elo? No. This was speaking out of
[43:44] David's own life experience because
[43:47] David had tasted of the Lord and David
[43:50] had tasted of his power and David had
[43:52] tasted of his possibility that there's
[43:54] nothing impossible
[43:56] for God. David says, "Who is this
[43:59] uncircumcised Philistine?" You see,
[44:01] David has this faith and this courage
[44:04] and David has this strength to stand
[44:06] before Goliath. But God, long before God
[44:10] puts a Goliath in your life, are you
[44:14] listening this morning? Long before the
[44:16] Goliath comes, there's an ascension to
[44:20] Goliath. You see, there's other battles
[44:22] that God has to send you through before
[44:23] he puts you with Goliath. You see, long
[44:27] before the Goliath comes knocking on
[44:29] your door and says, "Hey, let's fight."
[44:34] Long before that in David's life, Yeah.
[44:37] David fights a lion.
[44:39] David fights a bear. And David says,
[44:42] "One time, there was a lion that came
[44:43] out to destroy God's flock, and I slew
[44:46] him with my bare hands." Now, could you
[44:49] imagine if you were David and God put
[44:52] you in this circumstance to where there
[44:54] was nobody watching, there was no
[44:57] newspaper, there was no newspaper
[44:59] articles or clippings to give you
[45:01] evidence that this ever took place. All
[45:03] you had was the testimony of David.
[45:06] Yeah. And this is exactly what God
[45:10] allowed. God was not going to allow
[45:13] there to be any witnesses of what took
[45:17] place. There wasn't going to be anybody
[45:19] watching. There wasn't going to be
[45:20] anybody testifying. But David was going
[45:23] to fight the lion. Very different than
[45:25] Goliath where there's people and there's
[45:27] there's there's the army and there's
[45:29] Saul, there's the king, there's his
[45:30] brothers. But with the lion and the bear
[45:32] before Goliath, David's all by himself.
[45:38] Could you imagine with Isaiah, if you
[45:39] were David and you tried to tell this to
[45:41] Saul, oh, there was a time when when
[45:43] when you should send me king to fight
[45:45] Goliath because there was a there was a
[45:47] time when when a lion came to devour the
[45:50] flock of God and and a bear came another
[45:52] time and with my bare hands.
[45:56] Really, David?
[45:58] With your bare hands.
[46:01] really bare hands. Are you sure you're
[46:03] not exaggerating that?
[46:06] Who was there, David? Well, you imagine
[46:09] if I showed up here this morning, I got
[46:11] here this morning to church and and I
[46:13] told brother Isa Me and Brother Isaiah
[46:14] showed up and we were two hours late and
[46:17] y'all been singing and praying and
[46:18] singing and praying. Finally, me and
[46:19] Brother Isaiah and brother John show up
[46:21] and I get up here and I say, "Friends,
[46:23] I'm so sorry we're late. You'll never
[46:24] believe what happened. We stopped down
[46:26] at the at the the Exxon station there to
[46:28] get gas and out come from nowhere.
[46:30] Didn't know even know y'all had him in
[46:31] Iowa. Here comes a great big African
[46:33] lion and he charges at brother Isaiah
[46:36] and I grabbed him by my hands and I took
[46:38] him and I slammed him over and just as
[46:40] we were getting in the car, a black bear
[46:42] grabbed brother Danaqua and I had to
[46:44] pull the black bear off and I grabbed
[46:46] the black bear by the jaw and I broke
[46:48] his jaw and I flipped him
[46:50] over. And that's why I'm late. Now y'all
[46:53] turn to Second Samuel.
[47:01] Now you imagine, you'd think I was one
[47:03] of two things. A complete liar or a
[47:05] complete idiot.
[47:08] Lunatic.
[47:11] You know what's funny? But this is
[47:13] exactly where God puts David.
[47:17] God wasn't going to allow there to be
[47:19] anybody watching. And God is not going
[47:22] to allow there to be anybody in your
[47:25] lion and your bear. It's going to be
[47:27] very different from your Goliath because
[47:29] Jesus said, "When you pray, enter you
[47:32] into your secret."
[47:35] Amen. And shut the door
[47:39] and what you have done in secret, your
[47:43] father will reward you openly.
[47:48] What was Goliath? God was going to say,
[47:50] "David, I don't want your faith resting
[47:52] in people or crowds or your pastor's
[47:55] prayer, but you've got to find victory
[47:58] when nobody else is watching."
[48:01] Hallelujah. David, you've got to have
[48:03] victory when there's nobody there to
[48:05] pray for you. Nobody's there to
[48:07] encourage you. David, I've got to fight.
[48:10] I've got to bring a victory in your
[48:12] life. Wonderful. when you're all by
[48:15] yourself
[48:17] because you are who you are when nobody
[48:21] else is there. Did you hear me? You are
[48:25] who you are. Not when everybody's
[48:27] watching and you got the anointing of
[48:28] people and you got your pastor's prayer
[48:31] and you got your brother's
[48:32] encouragement. Amen. That God says with
[48:34] the lion and the bear David, "In order
[48:36] to have faith to face Goliath, you've
[48:40] got to first learn to depend on me and
[48:45] me alone."
[48:48] You see, private success equals public
[48:52] victory.
[48:54] Goliath, if I could say this, was
[48:56] David's public reward for private
[48:59] success.
[49:00] Let me tell you this. When you see a
[49:02] successful Christian and you see someone
[49:03] who looks like they live a holy life and
[49:05] a godly life and a consecrated, that did
[49:08] not come just by putting a smile on
[49:10] their face. That came through dark
[49:12] nights and dark times when nobody was
[49:15] there. David, when his wife is captured
[49:18] in Ziglag, the Bible says David
[49:20] encouraged himself in the Lord. And
[49:23] sometimes through our battle with the
[49:25] lion and the bear, you've got to be able
[49:27] to encourage yourself when there's
[49:29] nobody there to encourage you.
[49:36] This is why David could have the faith
[49:39] to look at that giant and say, "Who is
[49:42] this?" I don't know about you, brother
[49:44] Isaiah, but I almost think a lion and a
[49:46] bear with my bare hands is a lot greater
[49:49] than a Goliath giant with a sling. Amen.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:54] You see, God is going to give this man
[49:57] victories in the past to shape who he is
[50:00] in the present. David was not going to
[50:03] build on past failures, but he was going
[50:05] to build on past victories. That's why
[50:08] David said, "The same God who delivered
[50:11] me out of the pole of the lion and the
[50:14] bear is the same God. He's the same
[50:17] yesterday, today, and forever. The same
[50:20] God who saved me is the same God who can
[50:24] keep me through the fire, through the
[50:26] trial, through the valley, through the
[50:28] storm. He's the same God.
[50:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:35] You see, private victory equals public
[50:38] success.
[50:40] But very
[50:42] sadly, very unfortunately, the same
[50:45] principle applies that private defeat
[50:49] equals public
[50:52] disgrace. We hear about people who've
[50:54] fallen. They say, "Oh, brother Matt, how
[50:57] that that brother was so godly. He he
[51:00] preached the message and and he lived
[51:02] the message and and he lived a godly
[51:04] life." and you hear about this man
[51:05] falling into adultery or this woman and
[51:07] you ask yourself, how could that
[51:10] happen? Seems like one day they're good
[51:13] and then the next day they're they're
[51:14] you know that they're just totally
[51:15] fallen. You hear about them and they're
[51:17] gone and you're shocked. You see, all me
[51:20] and you get the opportunity to see is
[51:22] the Goliath that slays them. What we
[51:24] don't see is the years and months of
[51:27] that lion and that bear consuming their
[51:31] mind privately when they were feeding on
[51:34] Facebook and doubt and they were feeding
[51:37] on negativity
[51:39] and eventually that lion and that bear
[51:41] begin to consume their mind. Oh, they
[51:43] put a smile at church but that lion and
[51:46] that bear was craving was was consuming
[51:48] that mind.
[51:52] Wonderful. David finds us out the hard
[51:55] way. Boy, we got to hurry. I hope y'all
[51:57] are here for church this morning. The
[51:59] Bible says in verse two, notice verse
[52:01] one, it says he sends Joab in verse one
[52:04] and his servants with him in all Israel
[52:05] and they destroy the children of Ammon,
[52:07] the children of Aean. The children of
[52:09] Ammon. Wait a minute, David, in chapter
[52:12] 10. You were fighting Amon.
[52:16] So, you mean to tell me that you didn't
[52:18] finish the job in chapter 10? And now
[52:21] the time of season of war comes and
[52:23] God's telling you, go back and finish
[52:25] what you started. Don't leave it half
[52:27] undone. Go and finish the job, David.
[52:30] So, chapter 11, David fighting Amon was
[52:33] actually to go and finish off the kings
[52:35] who
[52:36] survived. But instead, whereas chapter
[52:39] 10, he was there fighting and the king
[52:41] was on the battlefield. Now the king
[52:44] says, "You know, you know, Joab, y'all
[52:48] go ahead. Y'all can handle it. Y'all go
[52:51] ahead. You know, I'm tired and and I
[52:53] just think I'll stay home on tonight on
[52:54] Wednesday night." And, you know, I think
[52:56] I'll just I'll just stay at home and,
[52:57] you know, y'all go to church without me.
[52:59] Y'all go ahead and and and and you know,
[53:01] I think Joab, I think I think y'all
[53:03] could y'all could handle it. You know,
[53:04] I'm just going to I'm just going to stay
[53:06] home, you know, because you know, I I I
[53:07] just think it's best and you know, I'm
[53:09] I'm tired and I'm weary and I think I'm
[53:12] just going to stay.
[53:14] And so David sends Joab to go finish his
[53:19] job. And he's the job is to defeat Amon.
[53:22] Now, I want to show you something very
[53:24] interesting that I thought was amazing
[53:25] how scripture dubtales. Anybody here
[53:28] ever heard of a god? And I'm sure you
[53:29] have if you if you believe the message
[53:31] and believe and read your Bible, you
[53:33] heard of a god called Moolok.
[53:36] You know what Moolak was? It was a
[53:37] heathen god. a god of fire where these
[53:40] heathens would take their firstborn
[53:42] child and they would take their children
[53:43] and they would sacrifice this baby to
[53:46] this god of moolok. Isn't it amazing
[53:48] that you've heard the god of moolok?
[53:50] Guess whose god Moolok was? Guess who
[53:53] created him? Guess who made him
[53:56] existence? Guess who gave him existence
[53:58] in the Bible? Amen. Amen. So, David
[54:03] fails to go fight Ammon, whose god was
[54:06] Moolok. And who suffers for David's sin?
[54:11] Who suffers, Mom? Who suffers? Dad, when
[54:13] you're not at war, I want you to get
[54:15] lazy spiritually. Who pays the price for
[54:18] compromise and dropping
[54:21] standards? The generation coming.
[54:25] Who pays David for your sins? It won't
[54:28] be you necessarily, but it'll be your
[54:30] kids.
[54:32] cuz you're going to lose child after
[54:34] child after child because of this one
[54:38] mistake in your life because you failed
[54:41] to be at war and you failed to discern
[54:44] you're living in a time not of peace of
[54:48] war
[54:50] and Moolok who is the child killing God
[54:52] and who's David going to lose child to
[54:54] child to child because instead of
[54:57] finishing off Aean David stays
[55:01] home. Came to pass, verse two, notice in
[55:04] your Bible, if you have your Bible, read
[55:06] there in verse two, it says, "It came to
[55:07] pass in an evening tide. And it came to
[55:09] pass in an evening tide that David arose
[55:13] from off his bed at an evening tide." Go
[55:16] look this up. Evening tide means about
[55:19] 3:00 in the morning, Brother John. 3 to
[55:21] 4 in the morning. Wait a minute. David,
[55:24] hold on. David, hold on. Everybody else
[55:27] is sleeping. Everybody else is in their
[55:30] bed. Uriah is in his bed. What are you
[55:34] doing at 3:00 in the morning? Brother
[55:37] Brandon said this, "Evil spirits come
[55:38] out late. So don't stay out late."
[55:42] You take it or leave it. I take it.
[55:46] David wakes up at 2 or 3 in the morning.
[55:48] His alarm goes off.
[55:51] David wakes
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] up and we get up and the Bible says he
[55:56] walks out of the roof of the king's
[55:58] house and he sees a woman very
[56:00] beautiful. Now notice he necessarily
[56:02] nothing's tooken place yet because he
[56:04] can't help what he sees by looking.
[56:06] Brother Brandham said you can't stop
[56:07] birds from flying over your head but you
[56:09] can stop them from building a nest.
[56:13] And the Bible says David sees and he
[56:15] looks. She was very beautiful. Now
[56:17] notice if Bsheba is eligible in those
[56:19] days David could have her. So nothing's
[56:21] wrong here. He sends and inquires. Verse
[56:23] three, he said and inquired after the
[56:24] woman and one said, "Is not this Ba'ath
[56:26] Sheeba the daughter of Iliam the wife?"
[56:29] It should have stopped there. But how
[56:33] many times does God say stop and we go
[56:36] just one more step?
[56:40] Just one more Lord stop. Run Joseph run.
[56:45] and we go one more step.
[56:48] The Bible says he'll never tempt us
[56:50] above that which we could be tempted.
[56:51] But with that temptation, he'll make a
[56:52] way of escape.
[56:54] Then how many times do we choose not to
[56:56] take that wave of escape and continue to
[56:59] flirt with the enemy?
[57:02] You know, I'll read just a little bit
[57:03] more. I'll look just a little bit more.
[57:07] Stop, Joseph. Run for your life.
[57:11] The Bible says he sends and inquires. He
[57:13] takes her. And we know what happens. You
[57:15] know what's amazing about this is that
[57:17] he doesn't stay in Jerusalem to meditate
[57:19] on the law. He doesn't stay in Jerusalem
[57:22] to write
[57:24] psalms. Oh, I'm going to stay here,
[57:26] Joab, because I want to I want to study
[57:28] the
[57:29] word. I'm staying home from church
[57:31] tonight to study the word.
[57:39] I just feel, you know, I feel led. I
[57:42] feel led. How many times do we use that?
[57:45] I feel led. I've heard that so much I'm
[57:48] almost sick of hearing it. Oh yes,
[57:49] brother. Because what we say we feel led
[57:52] for and I look at the action that we're
[57:54] saying we feel led for. I feel led to
[57:56] take this job that's going to take me
[57:57] out of church. Let me tell you
[57:58] something. God will never lead you
[58:00] against his own word.
[58:05] I wonder sometimes do people feel led or
[58:07] did they eat
[58:09] lead?
[58:12] Excuse me. I don't mean that
[58:13] disrespectfully. Forgive me.
[58:16] He didn't stay in Jerusalem to write
[58:19] psalms. In fact, he didn't write
[58:22] anything. How many psalms do you think
[58:25] David wrote in this time of his life in
[58:28] this penthouse apartment where he had
[58:30] this castle and he had everything and he
[58:32] had all the money and he had all the
[58:33] people and he had everything he ever
[58:34] wanted.
[58:36] Zero. Zero. In fact, David doesn't start
[58:39] picking up a pen and writing again until
[58:40] after he falls.
[58:43] You see, prosperity is dangerous.
[58:46] Let me say that again. Prosperity is
[58:48] dangerous. It's more dangerous than
[58:51] poverty and adversity. But what do we
[58:53] want? We don't want adversity. We don't
[58:55] want trouble. We don't want stress. We
[58:57] don't want trouble. We don't want uh you
[58:59] know problems. Say, "Lord, take them
[59:02] away. Lord, give me, you know, if I, you
[59:03] know, you know, prosperity sometimes is
[59:06] more dangerous than adversity. Oh, yes,
[59:08] brother.
[59:10] Let me ask you something. Which David
[59:12] would you rather be? I'm going to give
[59:13] you two Davids, and I want you to pick.
[59:15] This David has
[59:17] $50,000 in a savings account. His net
[59:21] worth is $3.6 billion. He has a castle.
[59:25] He has the newest cars. He has the
[59:26] newest houses. He has everything he
[59:28] want. He had people waiting on him hand
[59:29] and foot. Man, you know what? He didn't
[59:32] worry about how he was going to pay the
[59:33] power bill. He didn't worry how the
[59:35] mortgage payment or the rent was going
[59:36] to come. He didn't worry about sending
[59:38] his kids, you know, giving his kids
[59:39] education. He didn't worry about
[59:40] groceries. He didn't worry about food.
[59:41] He had no stress, no worry, no pain, no
[59:43] anxiety. He didn't fear for anything,
[59:46] man. He had it
[59:47] all. No pain, no stress, no worry, no
[59:52] anxiety, brother, that sounded good.
[59:56] You mean I can have all that? No pain,
[59:58] no worry, no stress. Oh man. Would you
[1:00:01] rather be that David or would you rather
[1:00:03] be this David?
[1:00:08] Hey.
[1:00:10] Hey. Have y'all seen Saul? Have y'all
[1:00:14] seen Saul?
[1:00:18] I I I've been out here in the woods for
[1:00:22] six weeks. I've had a bath. Haven't
[1:00:25] brushed my teeth. But Saul Saul's coming
[1:00:28] for me. He's throwing spears at me and
[1:00:30] God has me here hiding
[1:00:33] and he's on the run. Have y'all seen
[1:00:35] him? I hope he's not around. Which David
[1:00:38] would you rather be?
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:41] Now, let me tell you something. There
[1:00:44] was never a more carnal, lukewarm,
[1:00:46] backsliden David than the David who had
[1:00:49] no stress and no worry and no fear and
[1:00:52] no pain. But there was never a more
[1:00:55] spiritual onfire David than the David
[1:00:58] who was running from Saul.
[1:01:03] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] And we wonder about trouble and why does
[1:01:08] pain come? And why does heartache come?
[1:01:10] And why does stress come? Because your
[1:01:12] father knows what's best for you.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah. You should thank God for
[1:01:17] your trials and your test and your
[1:01:19] trouble.
[1:01:22] Oh, we love the book of Psalms. And some
[1:01:24] of you say, "My favorite Psalm is Psalms
[1:01:25] 27, Psalms 18, Psalm 6." When do you
[1:01:29] think these Psalms were written? These
[1:01:32] Psalms were written out of the darkest
[1:01:35] hours of this man's life.
[1:01:40] They were written in the most
[1:01:42] painful, the hardest. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:01:45] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:01:48] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] Oh, you should thank God. The Bible says
[1:01:54] your trial of your face is precious.
[1:01:57] It's more precious than gold.
[1:02:00] Job said, "For I know when he has tried
[1:02:02] me, I shall come forth as pure gold."
[1:02:07] I know after I go through test and after
[1:02:09] I go through trouble, it'll be to work
[1:02:11] the character of Jesus Christ. Because
[1:02:13] brother Brandham said, character is not
[1:02:15] a gift. It's a victory.
[1:02:18] And there's no victory without a fight.
[1:02:22] Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] Let no one say when he's attempted, I'm
[1:02:26] being tempted of God. For God cannot be
[1:02:28] tempted, nor he himself tempt anyone.
[1:02:33] But each one is tempted when he is
[1:02:36] picked
[1:02:38] up and carried away with his own lust.
[1:02:44] He's enticed by his own lust. And when
[1:02:46] lust has conceived brings forth sin. You
[1:02:48] know what sin is so amazing? Sin
[1:02:50] snowballs. It's not static. It's not
[1:02:53] stagnant. In fact, it's dynamic. It
[1:02:56] grows. It gets bigger. You tell a lie.
[1:02:58] It gets bigger and it gets bigger. He
[1:03:00] had a brother in a church. I don't know
[1:03:01] if exactly if I get these details right
[1:03:03] of this story, but it was a it was a
[1:03:05] story to the effect that he told to his
[1:03:07] soon tobe father-in-law and he was going
[1:03:08] to marry a woman and he was wanting to
[1:03:10] impress his father-in-law and he was a
[1:03:12] surfer. back home we have, you know, the
[1:03:13] big waves there and not, you know, we
[1:03:15] have people uh this this man here was
[1:03:18] was really into it. He'd go to Hawaii,
[1:03:19] go to Puerto Rico and and uh and and and
[1:03:22] so his father-in-law asks him, he says,
[1:03:24] you know, he says, "What's the biggest
[1:03:26] wave?" Now, this is the man he's going
[1:03:27] to try to impress. What's the biggest
[1:03:29] wave you've ever surfed? And he said,
[1:03:31] "Well, um immediately here it comes.
[1:03:37] Uh 13 feet."
[1:03:41] 13 feet. Yeah. 13 feet. He told a total
[1:03:46] lie. Boldfaced line just lied right to
[1:03:48] him. He said, "You know, it was funny.
[1:03:50] You know, they were all impressed, you
[1:03:52] know, and he said, "13 feet?" Yeah. You
[1:03:54] know, I mean, and he said, "Every time
[1:03:56] he told the story got bigger. There were
[1:03:57] sharks all around and, you know, and a
[1:03:59] big old great white shark swimming over
[1:04:01] here." He said the story got bigger and
[1:04:03] bigger. He said, "You know, it was
[1:04:04] okay." He said, 'Except for the problem
[1:04:06] that I didn't realize is that once I got
[1:04:09] married, every Thanksgiving and every
[1:04:11] Christmas, they'd say, "Hey, tell that
[1:04:13] story
[1:04:17] again." And it got bigger and bigger
[1:04:19] till one day he had to go and say, "Hey,
[1:04:20] you know that story about all that?" He
[1:04:23] said, "Yeah." He said, "Hey, it was a
[1:04:25] story."
[1:04:31] You see, sin gets bigger. Amen. Sin gets
[1:04:34] bigger and it gets bigger and it gets
[1:04:36] bigger and it bigger. It snowballs. It
[1:04:38] gets larger. You know, you try so hard
[1:04:40] to cover something up. You try so hard
[1:04:43] to cover something up and no one will
[1:04:45] know about it. Don't tell. Imagine as
[1:04:47] David tried to cover this up for so
[1:04:48] long. David says, "When I tried to
[1:04:50] conceal my sin," this is what David
[1:04:52] says. When I kept silent, my bones waxed
[1:04:56] old through my roaring. his sin grows,
[1:05:01] starts from murder, starts from
[1:05:02] adultery, goes to murder of one of his
[1:05:04] mighty men.
[1:05:07] And he tries to cover this whole thing
[1:05:08] up and it becomes a big cover up. And
[1:05:10] David says this, "When I concealed my
[1:05:12] sin, my body wasted away through my
[1:05:15] groaning all the day long." Oh, I put a
[1:05:18] smile on my face and I said, "God bless
[1:05:21] you at church." But when I laid my head
[1:05:23] on my pillow at night and I looked at
[1:05:24] the ceiling and it was me and God.
[1:05:27] I knew who I was.
[1:05:33] David said, "My bones waxed old. I was
[1:05:36] young, but I felt like an old man. My
[1:05:38] body waxed old. My bones hurt. For day
[1:05:42] and night, your hand was heavy upon me.
[1:05:44] My moisture is turned into the drought
[1:05:46] of summer."
[1:05:49] Unconfessed sin will rob you of your
[1:05:51] moisture before God.
[1:05:53] It'll rob you of the Holy Spirit being
[1:05:55] able to touch you and move you. You
[1:05:58] become callous.
[1:06:01] David says, "My bones waxed old my He
[1:06:04] says, "My moisture was turned into the
[1:06:05] dried of summer."
[1:06:07] Sah, these are not times of pleasure and
[1:06:10] joy as the devil would try to paint it.
[1:06:12] These are times of misery. David is a
[1:06:15] miserable Christian.
[1:06:18] He's miserable. He sees other in vic
[1:06:20] others in victory, others finding
[1:06:21] victory, but he himself has the
[1:06:23] consciousness of that guilt and he could
[1:06:26] never go any further. And the Bible says
[1:06:28] that David says, "Oh, he says, my bones
[1:06:31] waxed old through my roaring all the day
[1:06:33] long." We're going to close here in a
[1:06:35] minute. Are you still with me? Amen.
[1:06:41] It's in this time when we find that God
[1:06:45] is slowly through this misery, through
[1:06:48] this torment of David's
[1:06:50] conscience, God is preparing this
[1:06:53] vessel. God is tenderizing the heart of
[1:06:57] David because God's about to expose him.
[1:07:02] God says,
[1:07:06] "Nathan,
[1:07:07] imagine this wasn't D. This wasn't just
[1:07:10] a an employee. He didn't just work for
[1:07:13] David. He was a bosom for
[1:07:16] him." I can imagine when God begins to
[1:07:20] reveal the secrets of David's heart to
[1:07:22] Nathan. Maybe he wakes up in the middle
[1:07:25] of the
[1:07:25] night and Nathan his entire mind is
[1:07:28] flooded with everything that happened.
[1:07:31] And Nathan begins to
[1:07:35] realize,
[1:07:37] David, David, how could
[1:07:41] you? David, no. No,
[1:07:45] David.
[1:07:47] No, David, how could you? After all
[1:07:49] God's done for
[1:07:51] you. And God says, Nathan, you're going
[1:07:54] to tell him, Lord, you're going to
[1:07:58] expose him. No, not me, Lord. Not me,
[1:08:01] Lord. God, not me. Oh, God. I don't
[1:08:04] believe for one minute Nathan had the
[1:08:06] attitude of, "Oh, I can't wait to expose
[1:08:09] him."
[1:08:12] You know, sometimes a minister can have
[1:08:14] all the right words, but the wrong
[1:08:16] spirit, and it helps no one.
[1:08:19] A mom and a dad can have all the right
[1:08:21] words to say to son and daughter, but
[1:08:23] come with the wrong spirit, and all you
[1:08:25] do is cause a wedge, and you don't help
[1:08:28] anyone.
[1:08:29] But I believe a real servant of God was
[1:08:31] broken. I believe Nathan cried tears and
[1:08:34] said, "Oh Lord, why'd you choose me? I
[1:08:36] don't want to go and tell this. I don't
[1:08:38] want to go and say
[1:08:39] this." Imagine as Nathan goes to church
[1:08:42] that day and his hands jiggling and he
[1:08:45] says, "Oh." He opens the
[1:08:47] door. Nathan walks in. David says,
[1:08:51] "Nathan, how you doing, buddy?" "Good.
[1:08:55] Good. David, you got something on your
[1:08:57] heart?
[1:09:01] Yeah. Nathan says in verse one of
[1:09:03] chapter
[1:09:07] 12, notice there in your Bible, chapter
[1:09:09] 12, it says, "The Lord sent Nathan unto
[1:09:11] David. He came unto him and said unto
[1:09:12] him, notice what Nathan says. There were
[1:09:15] two men in one city, one rich and the
[1:09:18] other poor. The rich man had exceeding
[1:09:21] many flocks and herds, but the poor man
[1:09:23] had nothing save one little u lamb which
[1:09:26] he had bought and nourished up and it
[1:09:27] grew up together with him with his
[1:09:29] children and ate of his own meat and
[1:09:31] drank of his own cup, lay in his bosom,
[1:09:33] and was unto him as a daughter. What is
[1:09:35] Nathan doing? He's painting the portrait
[1:09:37] of Uriah and Ba Sheba. That David, this
[1:09:40] wasn't a broken marriage. This was a
[1:09:43] tightlyknit couple and you and your sin
[1:09:46] and blindness and
[1:09:49] lukewarmness, tore apart a
[1:09:53] family. Verse four. And there came a
[1:09:55] traveler unto the rich man he spared to
[1:09:57] take of his own flock and of his own
[1:09:58] herd to dress for the wfairing man that
[1:10:00] was come to him, but took the poor man's
[1:10:01] lamb, dressed it for the man that was
[1:10:03] come to him. And David's anger was
[1:10:05] greatly kindled against the man. And he
[1:10:08] said to Nathan, "As long as the Lord
[1:10:09] liveth, the man that has done this thing
[1:10:12] shall surely die." It is, it's so
[1:10:15] amazing, brother Isaiah. It's so amazing
[1:10:17] to me how quickly we pass judgment.
[1:10:22] We are so fast to say something. Oh, did
[1:10:25] you see what he did? Did you see what
[1:10:26] she posted? Did you see what she was
[1:10:28] wearing? Did you see what they did? Did
[1:10:29] you hear about that teenager? So fast we
[1:10:32] pass judgment.
[1:10:33] Let me ask, how many hours in prayer did
[1:10:35] you spend for that individual?
[1:10:39] What kind of heart, caring heart, did
[1:10:40] you go in prayer and tell that person,
[1:10:43] I'm praying for you.
[1:10:46] But we're so quick to pass judgment.
[1:10:49] We're so quick just to spout off at the
[1:10:51] mouth. Jesus says, "Every idle word that
[1:10:54] you speak, you'll give an account. For
[1:10:56] by thy words, thou are justified or
[1:10:58] condemned."
[1:10:59] My brethren, be not many masters. James
[1:11:01] says, "Because when you're a teacher,
[1:11:04] when you when you when you pass
[1:11:05] judgment, there's so much more required
[1:11:08] of you."
[1:11:10] David says, "The man that has done this
[1:11:12] thing shall surely
[1:11:15] die." Verse six, "And he shall
[1:11:19] restore." David. Oh, David. David, did
[1:11:23] you know? Did you not realize in all
[1:11:26] your sin and your condition, you were so
[1:11:28] blind to your own condition and so blind
[1:11:31] to your own
[1:11:32] sin? Did you know, David, you're the
[1:11:36] court, you're the judge, you're the jury
[1:11:40] in your own court
[1:11:43] trial, and you're about to pass judgment
[1:11:46] on your own life.
[1:11:50] He shall restore the
[1:11:53] lamb.
[1:11:57] Four-fold.
[1:11:59] Four-fold. David, did you know you're
[1:12:03] going to lose four
[1:12:05] lambs? You're going to lose Bath Sheba's
[1:12:08] son,
[1:12:11] Amnadona. You're going to lose four kids
[1:12:14] because of this one sin. four children
[1:12:16] are going to be the expense and they're
[1:12:19] going to pay the penalty for what,
[1:12:21] David? For you failing to discern that
[1:12:23] you're in a time of war and you chose to
[1:12:26] stay home.
[1:12:29] Now, we could we could divide it all up
[1:12:30] into all kinds of things and it was this
[1:12:32] and he committed sin and he he had
[1:12:33] adultery and you know, but all of this
[1:12:35] none of this would have ever happened if
[1:12:37] David would have been living like it was
[1:12:39] a time of war and not living like it was
[1:12:42] a time of peace.
[1:12:44] Too many people are living like it's a
[1:12:46] time of peace and they're relaxing and
[1:12:48] they're at ease and they're, you know,
[1:12:50] just ho h and you know, kar s. Oh, wake
[1:12:53] up church.
[1:12:56] We're living in a day the Bible said
[1:12:58] would be perilous.
[1:13:00] It would be a horrible day.
[1:13:03] A perilous time where men shall be
[1:13:05] lovers of their own flesh.
[1:13:08] David, you disp pronounced four lambs,
[1:13:10] four little lambs. You're going to lose
[1:13:12] because of this, David. The Bible says
[1:13:15] here in verse verse eight, he says ver
[1:13:18] verse seven, he said verse, let's read
[1:13:20] verse six again. He shall restore the
[1:13:21] lamb four-fold because he did this thing
[1:13:22] and because he had no pity. Nathan said
[1:13:24] to David, when you came to church, you
[1:13:26] thought it was him and him and her and
[1:13:28] her and her and you thought that
[1:13:30] preacher was talking about him and this
[1:13:32] situation and that, but David, it was
[1:13:34] you.
[1:13:36] Thou art the man. It's not my brother,
[1:13:40] not my sister, but it's me, oh Lord,
[1:13:43] standing in the need of prayer.
[1:13:48] What is the zeal of the hour?
[1:13:50] What is the zeal of the hour? To say I'm
[1:13:53] wrong. To repent and say it's me.
[1:13:57] David said he Nathan said, "Thou art the
[1:13:58] man, sayith the Lord God of Israel,
[1:14:00] anointed the king of Israel to deliver
[1:14:01] thee out of the hand of Saul. I gave
[1:14:02] thee thy master's house, thy master's
[1:14:05] wives, and have gave thee the house of
[1:14:06] Israel, land of Judah. And if that had
[1:14:08] been too little, I would have moreover
[1:14:10] given unto thee such and such things.
[1:14:12] Notice what he says. Nathan says, "Oh
[1:14:15] David, wherefore has thou despised the
[1:14:17] commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[1:14:19] his sight, thou has killed Uriah the
[1:14:20] Hittite with the sword, and has taken
[1:14:22] his wife to be thy wife, and has slain
[1:14:24] him with the sword of the children of
[1:14:25] Ammon? Thou therefore the sword shall
[1:14:27] never depart from thine house because
[1:14:29] thou has despised me and has taken the
[1:14:32] wife of Uriah. And he keeps repeating
[1:14:34] it. The Hitittite. Wait, brother
[1:14:38] John. Uriah wasn't an Israelite.
[1:14:42] Oh, hold on a minute. You mean Uriah was
[1:14:45] of a tribe that God said
[1:14:48] annihilate? He was a Hittite. He was a
[1:14:51] proelite, a convert.
[1:14:55] So you mean he wasn't CG?
[1:15:01] You mean God didn't have that elitist
[1:15:04] spirit to say, "Well, he was a
[1:15:06] Hitittite." Doesn't really
[1:15:08] matter. It's amazing to me how we think
[1:15:11] we can as the bride of Christ treat
[1:15:13] everybody else and we can have any kind
[1:15:15] of attitude towards anybody.
[1:15:18] Oh, the Bible says those blessed is the
[1:15:20] man who size and cries for the
[1:15:22] abominations in the city. A real
[1:15:24] revelation of Christ and grace in your
[1:15:26] heart will cause you to love the soul of
[1:15:28] your fellow man. And it'll cause you to
[1:15:31] realize you are nothing. I am nothing
[1:15:34] outside of the grace and mercy of God
[1:15:37] who has chosen you.
[1:15:43] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:15:47] You mean God wasn't going to have
[1:15:48] classifications and partiality?
[1:15:52] Because you have done this to Uriah the
[1:15:54] Hittite. Verse 10. Now therefore the
[1:15:56] sword shall never depart. Verse 11. Thus
[1:15:58] sayith the Lord, I will raise up evil
[1:15:59] against thee out of thine house. Verse
[1:16:00] 12. Notice our principle in verse 12.
[1:16:03] Let's read this together. For thou did
[1:16:06] it secretly. Stop. Thou did it secretly.
[1:16:10] Private victory equals public success,
[1:16:14] but private defeat will equal public
[1:16:18] disgrace. For thou did it secretly. Read
[1:16:21] it together. But I will do this thing
[1:16:24] before all Israel and before the son.
[1:16:29] So God said, what you've done in
[1:16:31] private, I'm going to reveal to
[1:16:34] everyone.
[1:16:36] You say, God, that's not fair, Lord. Why
[1:16:38] would you do that? No, it is fair. You
[1:16:40] see, God gave David a chance to make it
[1:16:44] right. And this is the law as I come to
[1:16:47] the heart of my sermon as we close on
[1:16:49] this here tonight
[1:16:50] today that God gave David a chance just
[1:16:54] as he gives the harlot even in the book
[1:16:56] of Revelations. I gave her a
[1:16:59] space to
[1:17:01] repent, but she repented
[1:17:04] not. David, I gave you a chance. And I
[1:17:07] sent sermon after sermon. I sent lights
[1:17:09] and candles to light your way. I sent
[1:17:11] ministers of the gospel with a flaming
[1:17:14] sword to expose you and to cause you to
[1:17:17] react and repent, but you chose not.
[1:17:22] Brother Brandham says in choosing of a
[1:17:24] bride, and I love it so much, when God
[1:17:26] deals with your heart, act immediately.
[1:17:31] Don't wait. Don't put off. Act
[1:17:33] immediately.
[1:17:35] react to the word of God.
[1:17:38] David, I gave you a chance. God gave
[1:17:40] David chance after chance after chance.
[1:17:43] But there came a time when God says
[1:17:45] enough is
[1:17:46] enough. And now, because you won't
[1:17:49] humble yourself, I'm going to humiliate
[1:17:52] you to humble you.
[1:17:58] You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:03] This is a long lost law. I love what
[1:18:05] brother Brandon says here. And as I
[1:18:06] thought on my way, this is a long lost
[1:18:09] law of repentance that we've lost. You
[1:18:12] know, so many times we see people who
[1:18:14] never get victory over sin and we almost
[1:18:16] question the Lord. Do we say, "Is the
[1:18:18] Holy Ghost not powerful enough anymore,
[1:18:19] brother Isaiah?" I mean, when it I've
[1:18:21] seen it set people free and they're free
[1:18:23] and they never look back and they never
[1:18:25] turn
[1:18:26] back. Then you see other people and they
[1:18:29] come and they pray. They seem just as
[1:18:31] sincere and you see victory for a while
[1:18:33] only for them to go right back. Brother,
[1:18:36] the problem is not the Holy Ghost. The
[1:18:38] problem isn't the blood of Christ. The
[1:18:40] problem isn't the word. The problem is
[1:18:43] repentance.
[1:18:45] You see, repentance, let me say this and
[1:18:47] don't forget it. Repentance is not a
[1:18:49] prayer that you can even pray. All
[1:18:51] right?
[1:18:54] Repentance is not a prayer that you can
[1:18:56] pray. Repentance is an action. Prophet
[1:19:00] of God said repentance means when you
[1:19:02] turn around and you go towards Calvary,
[1:19:06] you go the other way. Repentance is when
[1:19:09] you act, you leave the other thing.
[1:19:13] David says, "As I turn my feet to his
[1:19:16] testimony, I thought of my ways."
[1:19:18] Hallelujah. Brother Random says, "David,
[1:19:20] after he done wrong, taken Uriah the
[1:19:22] Hitittite, the lovely Ba'ath Sheba, was
[1:19:23] going to be the father of her child,
[1:19:24] caused her gallant husband to be killed
[1:19:26] in battle. Can I have just a five more
[1:19:27] minutes?"
[1:19:29] When the prophet Nathan come in and
[1:19:30] revealed his sins to him, David thought
[1:19:32] on his ways had turned himself. Notice
[1:19:34] he turned himself to repentance and
[1:19:38] sacloth and ashes. That's amazing thing.
[1:19:40] Sackloth and ashes. Sackloth was made of
[1:19:42] goat's hair. It was very fuzzy. It
[1:19:45] itched. And these prophets, anytime they
[1:19:47] were going to repent for a nation or
[1:19:49] there was death even whenever there was
[1:19:51] a turning back, they would represent it
[1:19:53] by this sackloth, this burlap, goat's
[1:19:56] hair that would itch. And they would
[1:19:58] wear this sometimes for weeks. And then
[1:20:01] they would take ashes. They would they
[1:20:03] would had take something and burn it,
[1:20:04] kill it, burn it to nothing but ashes.
[1:20:07] And they would dump ashes all over their
[1:20:09] face and smear it on their body, cover
[1:20:11] their eyes and their mouth and their
[1:20:12] ears. And they would walk. These
[1:20:14] prophets of God would walk through the
[1:20:16] city. What was it? It was a sign of
[1:20:19] repentance in sackcloth and ashes. What
[1:20:22] did the sackloth represent? Goat's hair,
[1:20:24] a wild animal. It represented that God
[1:20:27] David said, "I'm just conceived in sin.
[1:20:29] I'm a beast outside of God."
[1:20:32] Ashes represented a resurrection. Uh
[1:20:36] Ashes represented a death from which
[1:20:38] there was no life.
[1:20:43] sackloth and ashes. Brother Brandon said
[1:20:44] he would repent in sackcloth and ashes.
[1:20:47] Oh, he says, "Oh, that's the way to
[1:20:50] turn." God will always hear a man or a
[1:20:52] woman that'll turn their feet to his
[1:20:55] testimony. I wonder tonight if they
[1:20:57] would say someone there be another David
[1:20:59] sitting here tonight that was guilty.
[1:21:02] When you turn your light out at night,
[1:21:03] you see your brother's face and he says,
[1:21:05] "Or some woman in woman's home that
[1:21:06] could be a David." He says it ought to
[1:21:08] bring you to repentance and sackloth and
[1:21:09] ashes and confession. What the church
[1:21:12] need tonight is a confession making
[1:21:14] right to come back. It's time we turn
[1:21:18] back to God's testimony. As I thought on
[1:21:20] my way, I turned my feet to his
[1:21:24] testimony. Turn as we close to Psalms
[1:21:29] 51. We're just going to read this psalm
[1:21:31] and we're going to have the musicians
[1:21:33] return here in just a minute.
[1:21:40] I want you to put yourself
[1:21:43] there in this
[1:21:46] room. Nathan has just exposed David.
[1:21:50] Notice the reaction of
[1:21:54] David. Bible says David prays this
[1:21:56] prayer. I can imagine David drops to his
[1:21:59] knees. And as you read Psalms 51, you
[1:22:01] realize this is what you realize. It's
[1:22:03] not a poem.
[1:22:06] It's not some pretty speech. It's not
[1:22:08] some pretty
[1:22:09] prayer. This was a cry of
[1:22:14] desperation. It was a cry for mercy.
[1:22:17] David's just been exposed. And David
[1:22:19] says, "Have mercy upon me, oh God,
[1:22:23] according unto thy loving kindness,
[1:22:25] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:22:26] tender mercies, bought out my
[1:22:28] transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from
[1:22:31] mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
[1:22:33] sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions
[1:22:36] and my sin as ever before me. Verse
[1:22:38] five, behold, I was shaped in
[1:22:42] iniquity. Notice what he reminds God of.
[1:22:45] I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did
[1:22:48] my mother conceive me. Behold, I love
[1:22:52] this so much as we spoke on honesty.
[1:22:56] Notice this verse. Behold, thou
[1:22:59] desireest
[1:23:01] truth in the inward part, and in the
[1:23:06] hidden part, thou shalt make me to know
[1:23:09] wisdom. What is David saying? God,
[1:23:12] you're not so concerned with truth out
[1:23:15] here. How we dress, how we look, how we
[1:23:17] talk. You see, so many people can have
[1:23:19] truth only here, but lies inside.
[1:23:23] But God says, David says, God, you want
[1:23:26] truth inside,
[1:23:29] in the hidden part, in the inner man.
[1:23:31] Because God knows if there's truth
[1:23:33] inside, it will manifest itself
[1:23:37] outside. Thou desire truth in the inward
[1:23:40] part, and in the hidden part, thou shalt
[1:23:42] make me to know wisdom. Purge me with
[1:23:44] hissip, and I shall be clean. Wash me,
[1:23:45] and I shall be whiter than snow.
[1:23:48] Make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:23:50] the bones which thou has broken may
[1:23:53] rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins and
[1:23:55] blot out all mine iniquities. Create in
[1:23:58] me clean heart, oh God, and renew a
[1:24:02] right spirit within
[1:24:05] me. Cast me not away from thy presence,
[1:24:08] and take not thine holy spirit from me.
[1:24:10] Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:24:12] salvation, and uphold me with thy free
[1:24:14] spirit. Then I will teach transgressors
[1:24:17] thy ways and sinners shall be converted.
[1:24:20] In other words, I'm not going to take
[1:24:21] this mistake in my life and cause me to
[1:24:24] get on pills of depression and try to
[1:24:26] get a pity party from everybody, but I'm
[1:24:28] going to take a mess that I made. I'm
[1:24:30] going to give it back to God and repent.
[1:24:32] And he's going to bring sinners to
[1:24:34] repentance. And he's going to get glory
[1:24:37] out of my mistake. Because God is the
[1:24:40] master at taking something that is
[1:24:42] broken and busted and rebuilding it for
[1:24:44] his glory.
[1:24:47] And I'm going to allow my testimony to
[1:24:49] cause others to repent.
[1:24:52] Oh, hallelujah. He says, "Deliver me
[1:24:54] from blood guiltness, oh God, the God of
[1:24:56] my salvation, and my tongue shall sing
[1:24:58] aloud thy righteousness. Oh Lord, open
[1:25:00] thou my lips and my mouth shall show
[1:25:03] forth thy praise. Thou desireest not
[1:25:06] sacrifice. else would I give it? Thou
[1:25:09] delightest not in burnt offerings. The
[1:25:12] sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a
[1:25:16] broken and contrite heart, oh God. Thou
[1:25:20] will not
[1:25:23] despise. Do good. I love this verse.
[1:25:26] We're going to close here. Do good in
[1:25:29] thy good pleasure unto Zion.
[1:25:32] build thou the
[1:25:35] walls of
[1:25:36] Jerusalem. Why would David pray
[1:25:40] this? Because the Bible says, "The man
[1:25:43] that has no rule over his own spirit is
[1:25:46] like a city whose walls are
[1:25:48] broken." And David found that he had no
[1:25:51] rule over his own self. And David says,
[1:25:54] "Restore the broken walls,
[1:25:56] Lord. Restore the broken walls, Lord." I
[1:26:00] wonder if we could bow our heads this
[1:26:02] morning. Nobody looking around, every
[1:26:04] eye closed,
[1:26:05] pleased. I wonder if we could pray that
[1:26:08] prayer this morning. We could say, "Oh
[1:26:11] God, what I need today is a true
[1:26:14] repentance. Not a prayer that I pray,
[1:26:16] but an action that I take. Not words of
[1:26:19] a pretty poem that I speak, but a cry of
[1:26:22] desperation to say, Lord Jesus, cast me
[1:26:25] not away from thy presence, oh God, and
[1:26:27] take not thine Holy Spirit for me.
[1:26:30] Restore unto me the joy of my salvation.
[1:26:33] Oh Lord, repair the walls of Jerusalem.
[1:26:37] Restore, repair the walls that I've
[1:26:39] broken because my life is just a broken
[1:26:42] mess. Oh God, maybe someone would here
[1:26:44] would stand to their feet and say,
[1:26:46] "Lord, let me come to you in sackcloth
[1:26:48] that's in ashes. Let me come to you in a
[1:26:51] real face of repentance to say, I'm
[1:26:53] wrong. I want to change. I want
[1:26:55] deliverance. I want to restore the joy
[1:26:58] of my salvation." Maybe you're just here
[1:27:00] today and you want to say, "Lord, I want
[1:27:02] to rekindle the flame. I want you to
[1:27:05] refill me with the Holy Ghost. I want to
[1:27:07] come back to divine fellowship and
[1:27:09] divine purpose for my life. Oh
[1:27:12] God. Oh Lord Jesus, bring back the new
[1:27:16] again. Bring back the way it was before.
[1:27:20] Oh, where did the wonder go? Where did I
[1:27:23] lose the glow?
[1:27:25] Bring back the new again.
[1:27:28] Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Oh yes, Lord. Hands
[1:27:32] up today. Today. Maybe we could all
[1:27:34] stand to our feet with our hands raised.
[1:27:37] Oh, let's just pray a prayer. Lord
[1:27:39] Jesus, oh God, with lips that you gave
[1:27:41] us, we'll declare your works and your
[1:27:43] marvelous ways. With hands that you gave
[1:27:46] us and allowed us to have will raise
[1:27:48] them, Lord, as a sign of surrender
[1:27:51] because the clay today, Father, is
[1:27:53] surrendering to the potter and saying,
[1:27:55] "Shape us and mold us, make us, Lord
[1:27:57] Jesus." Lord, if we've been in Jerusalem
[1:28:00] in a time of peace and Lord, we we we've
[1:28:02] been out of season. Lord, call us to war
[1:28:05] today. Lord God, ignite our souls and
[1:28:08] our hearts, Lord Jesus, back to the
[1:28:11] battlefield. Don't let us stay in
[1:28:13] Jerusalem, but it's a time when kings go
[1:28:15] to battle. Lord, I pray like David,
[1:28:17] teach my hands to war. Teach my hands to
[1:28:20] fight this fight of faith. Teach it to
[1:28:22] fight this adversary, the devil, who
[1:28:24] wants my children. and he wants my home
[1:28:27] and he wants my family. He wants my
[1:28:29] marriage and he wants my church. But I'm
[1:28:31] going to stand in the way of the devil
[1:28:34] because when the enemy comes rushing in,
[1:28:36] the Lord raises up a standard against
[1:28:38] him.
[1:28:41] We stand today, Father, as a
[1:28:43] congregation, one for one. Maybe put
[1:28:46] your hand over on that brother, on that
[1:28:48] sister, and just pray a prayer for him.
[1:28:50] I pray for my brother living in a
[1:28:52] perilous time. I pray for my sister
[1:28:54] living in a perilous time. May you say
[1:28:57] to us, oh today God, oh thou, oh man of
[1:29:00] God, flee unrighteousness, seek
[1:29:03] godliness, seek righteousness, fight the
[1:29:06] good fight of
[1:29:07] faith. Fight the
[1:29:10] fight. Oh, press the
[1:29:13] battle. We're living in a dark day, a
[1:29:16] perilous time when the enemy is
[1:29:18] surrounding us. But it's a day where we
[1:29:20] join together in unity. We join together
[1:29:23] in faith
[1:29:25] and we say as David said, "Thou, oh
[1:29:27] Lord, are a shield for me. You're the
[1:29:29] glory and the lifter of my head."
[1:29:32] Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Call us to war. This
[1:29:35] is a time of war. It's not a time of
[1:29:37] peace. Call this church to war to hold
[1:29:40] up the bloodstained banner of Christ to
[1:29:43] not compromise.
[1:29:46] to stand for your truth and your word
[1:29:47] and your ways. Oh
[1:29:49] God, call us to fight the fight, Lord
[1:29:54] Jesus. Oh yes, Lord
[1:29:58] Jesus. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:30:01] you, Lord. Maybe we could just thank him
[1:30:03] just for a minute, church. Oh, let's
[1:30:05] just raise our hands and praise him just
[1:30:07] for a moment. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:30:10] divine grace. Thank you for divine
[1:30:13] election. Thank you for divine mercy
[1:30:15] when I didn't deserve it. Lord Jesus,
[1:30:17] you were merciful to me. Thank you for
[1:30:20] your blood that cleanses from sin. Thank
[1:30:23] you for a blood that never loses its
[1:30:25] power and reaches to the highest
[1:30:27] mountain. It goes and flows to the
[1:30:30] lowest hell.
[1:30:32] Oh, thank you Lord Jesus for your
[1:30:34] resurrection
[1:30:36] power. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you
[1:30:38] Lord God. Thank you oh Jesus. Thank you
[1:30:42] oh God.
[1:30:45] Oh, do you love him today, friends?
[1:30:47] Isn't God good? Hallelujah. Give him a a
[1:30:51] worship offering. Give him a praise
[1:30:53] offering. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:31:03] You know, David when he would rally his
[1:31:05] men, that's why he writes Psalms in the
[1:31:08] ways that he does because David never
[1:31:11] fought an army where he had more than
[1:31:12] the army he was facing. But David was
[1:31:15] always put in circumstances where he was
[1:31:17] small and the enemy was great. And so
[1:31:20] God would give David songs and David
[1:31:22] would rally his troops around. And they
[1:31:24] didn't have many instruments, but they
[1:31:26] begin to beat the drums and clap their
[1:31:28] hands. And David would begin to pray and
[1:31:30] he begin to praise. You know what his
[1:31:32] songs would do? It would bring courage
[1:31:34] to the men. David would begin to say,
[1:31:37] "Many are they increase that trouble me.
[1:31:40] Many there be that say of my soul,
[1:31:42] there's no help for you and God say
[1:31:44] law." But David said, "But thou, oh
[1:31:46] Lord, that's what the devil says. This
[1:31:49] is what I say. Thou, oh Lord, are a
[1:31:52] shield for me. You're the glory and the
[1:31:55] lifter up of my head."
[1:31:57] He could say, "I will look to the hills
[1:31:59] from which cometh my help." Where does
[1:32:02] my help come from?
[1:32:05] My help comes from the Lord. And he
[1:32:07] began to sing these songs of courage.
[1:32:09] And it brought faith to the people. And
[1:32:11] it brought faith to the men to say, "We
[1:32:14] can come. We can do anything through
[1:32:16] Christ who gives us strength. Greater is
[1:32:19] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:32:22] world."
[1:32:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:26] Oh, I feel like a song
[1:32:31] he might would sing. What a mighty God
[1:32:34] we
[1:32:36] serve. What a mighty God we
[1:32:40] serve. Oh, the angels bow before him.
[1:32:45] Oh, sing it, church. What a mighty God
[1:32:49] we serve. Oh, Jesus is the God we serve.
[1:32:55] Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] The God we serve.
[1:33:01] Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth
[1:33:04] adore him. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:33:09] Oh what a mighty God we
[1:33:14] serve. What a mighty God we
[1:33:17] serve. Oh the angels bow before him.
[1:33:21] Heaven and earth.
[1:33:24] What a mighty God we
[1:33:27] serve. Oh, Jesus is the God we
[1:33:32] serve. Jesus is the God we
[1:33:36] serve. Angels bow before him. Heaven and
[1:33:40] earth adore him. What a mighty God we
[1:33:45] serve. Jesus, I'll never forget what
[1:33:48] you've done for me. Jesus, I'll never
[1:33:52] forget how you set me free. Jesus, I'll
[1:33:56] never forget how you brought me out.
[1:34:00] Jesus, I'll never forget. No,
[1:34:04] never. There's a river of life flowing
[1:34:08] out from me. It makes the lame to walk
[1:34:12] and the blind to see. Oh, it opens
[1:34:15] prison doors, sets the captives free.
[1:34:19] There's a river of life flowing out.
[1:34:23] Sing it again. Oh, there's a river of
[1:34:25] life flowing
[1:34:27] out. And he'll make the lame to walk.
[1:34:31] Make the blind to see.
[1:34:35] Sets the captives free.
[1:34:39] Oh, flowing out.
[1:34:42] Oh, give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:34:44] this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:48] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:34:51] Yes, Lord.
[1:34:54] Hallelujah.
[1:34:57] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:59] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:35:02] Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord
[1:35:04] Jesus.
[1:35:07] Thank you for your word this morning,
[1:35:08] Lord. We love you, Lord Jesus, more than
[1:35:11] words can say. Oh, Father, we thank you,
[1:35:14] Lord God, that you are the glory and the
[1:35:17] lifter up of our heads. Father, we love
[1:35:20] you, God, that you said, "Come unto me
[1:35:22] boldly unto the throne of grace that you
[1:35:25] can obtain mercy and find grace to help
[1:35:27] in the time of need." We're so thankful,
[1:35:30] Lord Jesus. You're not a God who slaps
[1:35:32] us and who kicks us and beats us when
[1:35:34] we're down, but you said, "Come unto me
[1:35:36] that are heavy, that are heavy laden,
[1:35:38] and I will give you rest."
[1:35:41] Lord, I pray dear father that you would
[1:35:43] just so take the word that has been
[1:35:45] sown. Lord, may it accomplish the
[1:35:47] purpose that you sent it to bring. We
[1:35:50] ask it now, Lord, in your name. We love
[1:35:52] you and we thank you, Father, in Jesus
[1:35:55] Christ's name.
