God placed good people along my path. &gt;&gt; The pastor and and his wife were always praying for me. and brother Simon and his wife as well. &gt;&gt; And this morning, &gt;&gt; I'm grateful July 16 &gt;&gt; when I was coming back from work.

Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You alive this morning. &gt;&gt; Okay. You know, I like to hear noise. &gt;&gt; The verse to that song says, "Thank you for saving a sinner like me. [Music] &gt;&gt; To tell the world, salvation is free. There was a time I just didn't know did do right. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you watched over me both day and night. Your grace and mercy. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to give honor to uh Sister Rebecca, dad and mom. Amen. Appreciate you being here. &gt;&gt; Glad you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got a little emotional there &gt;&gt; because there's nothing like mom and dad. No one like mom and dad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of my parents are gone, [Music] &gt;&gt; so I know what I'm talking about. As we stand, &gt;&gt; we're going to be coming from Isaiah 40th chapter 25- 26. &gt;&gt; I was quite surprised at the testimony and the and the song even the songs that how a blessing. I got a roof over my head. I've got food to eat. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. We take it for granted. But there are many who do not have a roof over their head, &gt;&gt; don't have a place to sleep. But we God has been merciful. &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 40 25- 26. To whom then will ye liken me? &gt;&gt; Or shall I be equal? said, "The Holy One, &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who have created these things that bringeth out their host by number. He calleth them all by name by the greater of his might. For that he is strong in power. &gt;&gt; Not one faileth. First Peter &gt;&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; 15-19 and it reads &gt;&gt; but as he which call hath called you is holy So be ye holy in all manner of conversation. &gt;&gt; Because it is written, &gt;&gt; be ye holy, for I am holy. And if you call on the father, &gt;&gt; who without respect a person judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your short journey here in fear. For as me much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, silver and gold from your vain conversation received by traditions from your father, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Our gracious father God, we come before you &gt;&gt; and Lord, we thank you for your grace. We thank you for being so good to us. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves. We ask this morning that you would do, Lord God, &gt;&gt; uh your purpose and your will this morning. regardless of the audience. &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that there are many who come &gt;&gt; but they don't know you. &gt;&gt; And I pray that through this message you would give them sight &gt;&gt; to understand that you are in full control. and that everything moves by your will and your command. &gt;&gt; Bless this audience &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We are here this morning &gt;&gt; only to hear the word of God. And we come to hear the word of God that we might become closer to God and to each other. &gt;&gt; None of us have a heaven to put anyone in. So therefore, you can't put someone in, nor can you take one someone out. I think sometimes if we would look in the mirror of the word and see what we see &gt;&gt; within ourselves, we would be less judgmental of others. One thing I want to say this morning, if any of us make the rapture, it will be by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It would be by election because he chose us. And I believe with all my heart that's the reason we're gathered under the message of Malachi soul because we have been chosen. I believe with all my heart that if you're going to do something, you ought to give it your best. &gt;&gt; And when it comes to God, we ought to give God our best. The message of this hour &gt;&gt; has come not only to perfect us uh but it came to make us rapture ready. I believe with all my heart that this is uh the time of the revival of the bride. Not something that we could turn on, &gt;&gt; but something that God has ordained if we understand the mission of William Brandon, the Elijah of our day. He came to prepare us to meet our Isaac. And in doing so, He told us how that uh uh uh to meet the measures that God requires from us. For those of you who weren't to hear the last message, I was talking about the statue of a perfect man. And I said that those virtues are not just a set on the wall. But these virtues &gt;&gt; in which God has given us is the absolute nature of God. absolute truth. &gt;&gt; There's only one divine nature &gt;&gt; and we who are of this message &gt;&gt; have been privileged &gt;&gt; to know what God is requiring &gt;&gt; from us to make a rapture. I'm not just talking about salvation. There'll be a many saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But only a few. according to Malachi 4, we'll make a rapture. And the reason being is because we fail, &gt;&gt; amen, to put on the garment of God. But by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; the bride of this day &gt;&gt; has been ordained &gt;&gt; to be the feminine form of God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. &gt;&gt; The bride today &gt;&gt; has been uh uh predestinated &gt;&gt; to be the feminine form. of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; So we must understand it took a price, a cost, [Music] it takes something from you. Even though God has done it all, we must do something. God told the children of Israel, "I've given you the land, &gt;&gt; but you must fight for it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I heard what Brother Brandham said that a true Christian. We must not only die, but we must rot in order for the life of God to come through us. My question is, which one of us have reached that state? &gt;&gt; Look what the prophet of God says. Isaiah 53 and4. He said, "Surely ye have borne our griefs &gt;&gt; and have carried our sorrows. &gt;&gt; Yet we did esteem him. stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. That's Isaiah 53. &gt;&gt; In the message, Masterpiece year 64705, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 is to bring back to the original. And he ties the bride of Jesus Christ into the suffering of Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 160, he says, "She is smitten from the church, from the church body, smitten with her master &gt;&gt; for the same purpose. She is the word just the same as Joseph was smitten. from his brethren because he was the word. And Jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word. The church is smitten. The bride is smitten from the church. Because she is the word. There is there is your stage of gain. One, two, and three. See just exactly the word living in action. I love that. I love that. Don't say you're following, brother or following the message. If you're not living the word, the bride, the Bible bride, not some man-made bride. The Bible bride smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty we should desire of her, but yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are y'all listening? &gt;&gt; You're tied in &gt;&gt; to his crucifixion. &gt;&gt; You're tied in &gt;&gt; to his suffering. So there is no way you can travel this way without suffering. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said in all things give thanks. Hallelujah. Now our suffering. It's for the gospel's sake, not because of something we have done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; That's right. She stands alone. &gt;&gt; She is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelation 3. She is smitten out of church age that she was raised up in. The church was raised up in the layers in the church church aid. He said that's the husk. But if there's others went &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; let me let me say say a little read a little quote another part paragraph two paragraph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Lord Jesus, the f uh doubt the fountain, exhaustable fountain of life, flow through us today, Lord, &gt;&gt; and cleanse us from all unbelief, all sin, that we might stand in thy presence now, knowing that there is need among us, that we know that we are sinners and not not worthy of any blessing. How many believe that? But then we think of him who came and took our sin. Then when he when his blood is there, it's not us in the presence of God. I want you to listen closely. I'm gonna read that portion again. But then when we think of him &gt;&gt; who came and took our sins, &gt;&gt; then when his blood is there, &gt;&gt; it is not us in the presence of God. It's him. &gt;&gt; It's just our voice through his blood. His blood is speaking. God, &gt;&gt; then cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief. &gt;&gt; What am I trying to do? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get your mind away from the law and bring it under grace. Because as long as you think it is your righteousness that's going to make you make a rapture, heal under bondage. It is good that we do good, but our goodness does not save us. &gt;&gt; It will always be grace. It will always be the blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize I'm finish the quote? &gt;&gt; I'll finish the quote in a moment. But do you realize what God has done for you? I fear God to have known this message and to come up short &gt;&gt; because my will was not surrendered to his will. &gt;&gt; Your place in the darkness &gt;&gt; will be the greatest. of all ages because to whom much is given, &gt;&gt; much is required. Don't get sad. I'm trying to encourage you. Remember, no matter how faulty you are, &gt;&gt; God has already fixed it. That's if you are a true believer. &gt;&gt; That's if you have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give us the desires of our heart. For we truly have these desires to serve you in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that puts upon us something to perfect us. When we've been told that then he said, "Think it not strange. that these trials come, &gt;&gt; they're only working out for our good and to perfect us. Every one of our battles are different, &gt;&gt; but they are here to perfect you. When you come to a place where you trust God regardless to circumstances, it doesn't matter what circumstance you find yourself in. Faith, real faith, brother said has hair on his chest. Hallelujah. Real faith. Amen. Knows no defeat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the government does. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your jobs do. &gt;&gt; I don't care what encompass you. &gt;&gt; You've got to realize that all of heaven is on your side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know about you. But when I look and I see the heavens, I think, what a mighty God we serve. Hallelujah. And to think that this God could humble himself &gt;&gt; to save a sinner like me &gt;&gt; and save a sinner like you. And not only that, he didn't choose the horse to live in. He didn't choose a cow to live in. Hallelujah. He didn't choose a donkey to live in. Hallelujah. But he chose you. He chose me. Hallelujah. A creature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With feet like bear. &gt;&gt; Hands like a monkey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But yet God, &gt;&gt; he was rich in his mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't even understand it. But I'll say it like this. Where would we be had God not sent Malachi? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you. &gt;&gt; The Bible said without My people without a vision, &gt;&gt; they perish. And if you don't study and read this message and read your Bible, hallelujah, you are going to be left without a vision. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He loved the Lord. Now, let me finish the quote so we move on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it for to perfect us? &gt;&gt; We've been told. &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Think it not strange that these trials come only working out for good and to perfect us." You got to believe that &gt;&gt; and bring us into that place that that great desert of experience &gt;&gt; where righteous men &gt;&gt; are molded into saints. We thank these for the experiences. &gt;&gt; We with no means, no wise &gt;&gt; want to do anything contrary to your will. But we pray, Father, that in this we'll be brought closer to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the burdens are so heavy and we can't go farther, then we raise our hands and scream to our father. Then hear from heaven, Lord. Heal us. Make us well for the kingdom of God's sake. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet of God preached this message. &gt;&gt; Right after he spoke with Sister Bruce, &gt;&gt; Sister Bruce gave a it's called the testimony and she was a Holy Ghost filled woman. &gt;&gt; But she wasn't emotional. She wanted a sign that she had the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says with no doubt in my mind, sister, you are true daughter of God. And she said, "But brother Brandham, I make so many mistakes." And he said, "You know what you have to do? &gt;&gt; Basically, stop looking at yourself. and look at perpetuation. Look and see what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; It's not by the law. It's by the grace of God. Y'all hear what? That's that's very important because law and grace cannot abide at the same time. Law will cause you to judge your brother. Y'all hear me? &gt;&gt; When you don't even know who he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord will cause you to judge your sister. When you don't know who they are, you say, "Prove it by the scripture. There was a woman caught in adultery. Hallelujah. And it was the religious group. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That brought her to Jesus. &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone her. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know who she was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hold myself. &gt;&gt; They didn't know who she was, &gt;&gt; but Jesus knew. Like I say all the time, &gt;&gt; even a devil has the ability to bring you to Christ. And God used him. &gt;&gt; But when he asked a question, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to tell you, this is a judgment statement. He who is without sin Let him first cast the first stone. &gt;&gt; See, so if you're not without sin, you have no right to cast a stone. &gt;&gt; You walk away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's only one righteous man and that man is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because when the book was to be opened, &gt;&gt; the Bible said there was no one worthy. &gt;&gt; No one. &gt;&gt; Starting from Adam all the way up, the only one worthy was the perfect seed of God, &gt;&gt; and that was Jesus Christ himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Bible tells us that Romans 3 and 10 here the word says, &gt;&gt; "As it is written, &gt;&gt; there is none righteous, no not one." &gt;&gt; So I don't get upset when people judge me wrongfully. Because I said, you know what, they are in the flesh, too. And as long as you in this flesh, &gt;&gt; you got to pray. &gt;&gt; And you got to ask God for forgiveness just like me. &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm pointing to anyone because I'm not. I'm trying to collectively speak this morning so that we can be free. So we can we can start have a revival in our soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; All righteousness was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. He was God's masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; God is a planning something. And he's doing it according to his own will and purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had an affliction in his stomach for almost entire time of his life. Here he was, &gt;&gt; God standing in flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother Van was there too, you know. &gt;&gt; I must clarify that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the man. &gt;&gt; But there were times God would step in the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And discern the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? with all of that he still had to pray God heal me. How many of y'all know that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I better I better pick it up cuz y'all like y'all rock going to sleep or something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me move on. &gt;&gt; Now, when we think about it, &gt;&gt; let let me read this quote because I don't mean to read so much this morning, but I have to Paragraph 80 from masterpiece. &gt;&gt; All promises was met in him. He was the perfection of the perfection. All types were fulfilled in him. our kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; in Ruth &gt;&gt; and Boaz our lawgiver &gt;&gt; from Mount Si &gt;&gt; our prophet from the wilderness as he came from the mountain as he came from the wilderness as he come from eternity and become man the perfect image God down through the ages curing away by the patriarchs and made his platform and brought them up from the different things that he would lay this foundation upon. Hallelujah. Upon this he began to build his word, the prophets and then finally come out to the perfect prophet, the prophet foundation, the perfect vision of God that God had. Y'all understand me? What is the prophet of God working with? &gt;&gt; He's working with the perfection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We ought to be grateful this morning because of the gift of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like being handed a life wrath. &gt;&gt; A life raft from the Titanic. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You out of all the people, &gt;&gt; you get a way to escape from this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we know that this world is on its way down. Wake up. This is a reality. It's not just in America. It's all over the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, you and I ought to be grateful. that God has given us a way of escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, brother Brooks, &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. Even though Noah does not type out the rapture, it still was an honor. It still was a grace of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be on that boat. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And I'm gonna tell you something. It was a miracle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God sent John the Baptist, &gt;&gt; there had not been a prophet for 400 years. What would make a a generation hear the word of John the Baptist? It was God's plan. God had already not only if he going to send a prophet, &gt;&gt; he's got to make a people that can hear a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; So we realized this morning. Look at Anna. &gt;&gt; Blind Anna in the temple. &gt;&gt; Who's talking to Anna? But brother Brandham said Anna knew the Messiah was on hand. Hallelujah because of John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know that the Messiah is at hand because of Malachi fall because of the Elijah of our day. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; She was in the temple praying. &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let me miss this. Can I say it like this? the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I know he's coming. But you see, &gt;&gt; she understood he wasn't going to come in a form that the world was looking for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were looking for a man to ride on a horse and declare he was the Messiah. But here come the Messiah &gt;&gt; born, a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wrapped in swaddling clothing. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. See, you got to have &gt;&gt; somebody talking to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It can't be a natural man, but it's got to be the spirit of God who's telling you what time it is. what time it is. You got to know the time you living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is the only way you'll make yourself ready. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; You and I, we're blessed. And I know I'm not going to spend too much time, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to say it like this. &gt;&gt; When it comes to revival, &gt;&gt; God ain't talking about music. He ain't talking about dancing. &gt;&gt; All of that is good. You know, I love it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he's talking about life. &gt;&gt; God want to see the life. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. God wants to see the life of Christ in you. He said, "When I see the token, when I see the blood," and brother Brandham said, "It's not the literal blood." Hallelujah. But it is the very life of Christ in you if you don't have it. The death angel will get you. &gt;&gt; That's why I keep preaching. It's more to the to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's more to the Holy Ghost than feeling good. You understand me? Listen. How many millions followed Moses &gt;&gt; and only two caught the revelation? &gt;&gt; The Bible said, &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb had different spirits. It &gt;&gt; basically they had the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wasn't given yet. What you don't understand, the Holy Ghost was always here. The Holy Ghost ain't never left. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? If you go all the way through through through the book of of of Genesis all the way up, like I said the other night, you may have called him the father, but he still was the Holy Spirit. Holy Ghost, however you want to put it. Hallelujah. People said, "Well, the Holy Ghost didn't come &gt;&gt; till the day of Pentecost." &gt;&gt; Well, of the infilling of the Holy Ghost in human beings, he was now doing a new thing. Y'all hear what I'm saying? He was now doing a new thing. But he always always has been here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Prove it to me." Who guides the birds? &gt;&gt; Who guides the birds flying? &gt;&gt; Now, maybe you've seen two birds crash, but I haven't. Hallelujah. Who showed them the direction? What is south and what's north? That's God. Who brings the rain, folks? &gt;&gt; You say that ain't God. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; It's a curse when we don't get rained. &gt;&gt; You said prove it by Elijah. I'm prove it. &gt;&gt; Elijah said it will not rain &gt;&gt; till I call for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? What was he doing? cursing the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when it rains, it brings forth crop. &gt;&gt; It brings water to the rivers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It makes the earth flourish. &gt;&gt; Let me bring it spiritually to you. So when it rains in the church, it gives you water. It makes you flourish. It brings that which is dead to life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, &gt;&gt; but I want to do everything according to his plan. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter whether people like you or not. And I do. I I just have this thing &gt;&gt; because I was a rejected kid. &gt;&gt; So I do battle complexes. But everybody does. Everybody want to be liked by people. But you got to man up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Everybody ain't going to like you. It doesn't matter whe whether you are a a good person or not. Matter of fact, this age &gt;&gt; hates good people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; They say, "Oh, you don't have to say you're sorry, but I am." &gt;&gt; You know why I'm looking back and forth? I'm looking back and forth so I can scope everybody. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand by the grace of God, you are you are a blessed people. Somehow I want to keep saying that until it becomes a reality to you. Not because I'm saying it is because God has said it. &gt;&gt; And I believe that. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I asked a question then. &gt;&gt; Was Joseph blessed? &gt;&gt; The prophet Joseph? &gt;&gt; The prophet Joseph. Was he blessed? &gt;&gt; But Joseph had to go the way the Lord had already determined him to go. This not it's not even my notes like this. But let me say it like this. How many of you would have been feeling blessed, thrown into a ditch, &gt;&gt; then out of the ditch &gt;&gt; you get sold into slavery, &gt;&gt; right? From out of the slavery, &gt;&gt; you get attacked by Piper's wife. And you know she had to look like a monster. &gt;&gt; Nothing about her looked godly. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; Then accused. Oh, don't be lying on me. Then accused &gt;&gt; every accusation &gt;&gt; God allows. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the test is on you. &gt;&gt; The test is on me. &gt;&gt; What you going to do about it? &gt;&gt; I tell you what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Then from there, God began to work. Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; But everything was in his time. If you believe God, &gt;&gt; I don't care how un your your situation is. &gt;&gt; God makes everything beautiful. &gt;&gt; In his time. &gt;&gt; Do y'all know how how hard it is &gt;&gt; for people to get visas? from the Congo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But somebody prayer worked. &gt;&gt; Say what you want. Faith was somewhere. And it doesn't mean you don't have faith. All things worked in God's plan. All I'm saying is if God can do it for Rebecca, God can do it for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it. &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:18. &gt;&gt; I know this is way off. I I thought I was going a different way this morning. It It's just going this way. But I I trust that you're hearing because like I said to you, I'm not here to just give you these great revelations, which all of these great revelations are great. But my my question is &gt;&gt; with all of the deep revelations that you have, &gt;&gt; how has it changed you? &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; We come for change. &gt;&gt; This message called for change. This message come out of the holies of holies &gt;&gt; and all the rod had to do was just remain in the holies of holies. It was God who brought the chains. All you got to do is stay under the blood. Stay under this message with your sincerity of heart and God will change you. You can't change yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. He said, "I counseledled thee in 18 to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayestth be rich &gt;&gt; and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eyes, that thou mayest see." So what brother Brandham used the same scripture and he talks about how cold it was during his day. And I know what that is. How your eyes because of the cold match together. I remember when when that happened to me. It was very terrifying because you can't open your eyes and that that matter in your eye on your eyelid is painful trying to open your eye and they had to get oil and rub it there to break up that stuff. Hallelujah. What is God saying to open your eyes? May be a little painful. God will place the oil on there. But you need to see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is this world? &gt;&gt; What value do you have? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I I don't know. I feel like I'm crying out for somebody. What value do you have here? We don't even know what tomorrow is going to bring. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we must recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? Moses did what he was supposed to do. Noah did what he was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Joshua did what he was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; William Brandham did what he was supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Now coming to you, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; What are we doing? Are we doing what we supposed to do? Oh, I come to church. Is that it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pay my tithe. &gt;&gt; Is that it? I sing songs if that is &gt;&gt; absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We supposed to be Jesus Christ manifested in the flesh manifest. &gt;&gt; I believe that. But the only way we can get there, [Music] hallelujah, we've got to work. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what do you mean, Brother Bruce?" &gt;&gt; The Bible says labor until you come to that rest. Labor to enter into that rest. Hallelujah. That means you got to pray. Oh, you think you're going to make a rapture without praying. It ain't happening. That's why the devil don't got your prayer life at the minimum. He knows the key to making it. Every revival was started by prayer. That's what brother said. Every revival, you want to see a revival in your life personally, you got to start praying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true. It's true. Let me move on. &gt;&gt; Anoint your eyes so you could see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Psalm 37:16. &gt;&gt; A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. Say, I don't have much, brother Brook. Hallelujah. But let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; I don't care. If God has to place me &gt;&gt; in the place of poor Lazarus, &gt;&gt; who didn't have nothing, &gt;&gt; but he had to pretty much race with the dogs to to get the crumbs that fell from the table. &gt;&gt; But look where he ended up &gt;&gt; versus where the rich man ended up. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; It's real. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Romans 4. &gt;&gt; For what saith the scripture? &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God. &gt;&gt; And it was counted unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; He didn't just believe something. He believed all things. Was Abraham faulty? &gt;&gt; He was a man. &gt;&gt; He did man things. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God says he didn't find nothing because it was trusted in the blood. Abraham was under different covenant. An unconditional covenant. Do you understand this? Unconditional. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; When you're chosen by God, &gt;&gt; you don't have to worry about the Holy Ghost. God will make sure you get it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He will either lead you &gt;&gt; like the lamb &gt;&gt; or he will drive you like the cattle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he's going to positionally place you in a place that you will get it. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, wait a minute, brother. Let me tell you something. I tell everybody. If you got a thirst to do righteous, God gave you that thirst. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you have that thirst, &gt;&gt; he said you will be filled. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ain't got it yet. &gt;&gt; Well, one thing is good about it. &gt;&gt; You're hungry for more God. And if you're hungry for more God, you're going to get more God. But if you look at this message like another branch of religion, all you're going to get is a religious spirit. Hallelujah. You'll never be an overcomer. Hallelujah. But when you see this bread that came from heaven as being the bread of God, as being the body of God, as being the eternal life that God has has broken up and given to us. Hallelujah. Oh my God. &gt;&gt; The world don't know what they in for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz when this bride get in her rightful place, &gt;&gt; we won't have to we won't have to have a sign on our back. &gt;&gt; They will know. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be a short time. &gt;&gt; I know people don't think we're going to have another outpouring, but we will. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all asking for it? &gt;&gt; You need to be crying out for that. Send it, Lord. The prophet said, "We have it." &gt;&gt; Cuz let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; With the way things are now, &gt;&gt; you and I know that God is separating from the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's pulling away from it. This is why Satan is doing what he's doing. Yeah. You're the only one. You're the only piece of sand that literally has God in it. And then when we're taken, the whole world would go into chaos. Do you understand what I'm saying? If God is drawing his spirit, that means he's drawing us up with his spirit. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I just know I know my struggles and I know you're struggling too. &gt;&gt; But my my thing is that you got to do something about it. You got to you got to cry out. &gt;&gt; Like brother said, you got to cry out. &gt;&gt; Let me finish my scripture. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Now to him that workketh is the reward, not reckon of grace. but of debt, not to him that workketh not, but believeth on him that justifyth. &gt;&gt; The ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness. How many of y'all believe that? Do you know what ungodliness is? Ungodliness is you're supposed to be godly, but you're doing ungodly things. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; Galatians 3 6 through9. &gt;&gt; Oh, I may I'm over my time, but that's all right. We we're going to have communion for those who want communion. it was announced on the uh uh internet. But anyway, if you weren't prepared for it, that that's those who are prepared, we will Galatians 3 6 through9, even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture for seeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, "In these shall all nations be blessed, so then they which be of faith are blessed with faith for Abraham." How many of y'all know that? You say, "I know it. Oh, I really know it." You don't know it until your trials come. When your test come, that's when you prove it. You know it. You say, "Well, wait a minute, brother. Let me say it like this. When Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, &gt;&gt; they knew who they were. They were of Abraham's seed and they were faithful to God. &gt;&gt; This is what I love. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; even though God didn't answer them in their prayer, they said, "I'm going to stand with God anyway. Whether he answer me or not, I'm going to stand with him anyway. I don't need a feeling. &gt;&gt; All I need is his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham, &gt;&gt; Amen, was the father of faith. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And we are of what? Abraham's seed, not of the natural, of the spiritual. &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you a question. I know this is simple, but I've got to go this way. This the way he's leading. You've never seen an apple tree bring forth nothing other than apples unless something else has been grafted. where we have the seed of God and doesn't matter what Satan do. This seed cannot be hid, &gt;&gt; he cannot graft anything into us that's going to change us from what his purpose for us to be. &gt;&gt; I hope I said that correctly. There's nothing he can do. that can change you. &gt;&gt; If you've been ordained to be bride, &gt;&gt; well, you might not feel like it, but nevertheless, it's not on feelings, it's on faith. &gt;&gt; Can I address this without anybody being offended? How did the congalles? &gt;&gt; How did you get to America? &gt;&gt; Was it not faith? &gt;&gt; Many of friends were turned down. &gt;&gt; Perhaps many rel. But you believe. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Somewhere you believe. &gt;&gt; And because you had that faith God brought you here. &gt;&gt; Now you're a witness. &gt;&gt; I once believed but now I see. &gt;&gt; That's how the gospel is. &gt;&gt; If you can believe the gospel that way, you will see it that way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's true. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much. Ah, I don't have to Pump it up. Something just registers. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. It It amazes me. &gt;&gt; Abraham seed. Now, I know I've gone over time, but I'm got to finish this. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things. Sometimes I put too much stuff. Let me move down. &gt;&gt; I'mma use this scripture. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:1-12 and then I I'll close on this. Okay. &gt;&gt; I I I I don't know sometime how to say things. I know what I'm looking at and I don't know why I've been having dreams of people who've gone on. I even dreamed our brother Keith the other night or this morning, whenever it was, but I've been seeing things. I don't I'm not trying to be a fanatic. &gt;&gt; But I'm going tell you, it's later than you think. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just hope you all none of you have the experience of coming to church and Brother Brooks doesn't show up. I pray by the grace of God that when we we all go up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53 &gt;&gt; 1 through 12. I remember when I was a boy, I knew nothing about God. &gt;&gt; I was in the junior high school. &gt;&gt; That would have been my seventh or eighth grade year. &gt;&gt; I had a dream. I wasn't even a Christian as far as I was concerned. &gt;&gt; I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 12. in a Baptist church. &gt;&gt; But that's all I knew. &gt;&gt; My life changed even then. &gt;&gt; He took hatred out of my heart. I couldn't hate anybody no matter what they did to me. I never have been able to hate. And I thought something was wrong with me because I wanted to. I wanted to do to people what they were doing to me, [Music] but I never had that ability. &gt;&gt; But in that dream, if you don't mind me pausing, &gt;&gt; we were up in heaven. I stood before the Lord &gt;&gt; and um and the gate was open &gt;&gt; and all kinds of people were coming through that gate like everyone &gt;&gt; and I was standing &gt;&gt; which would have been on Jesus's right he was facing and um anyhow &gt;&gt; I was inside the gate &gt;&gt; while all of these people were coming in &gt;&gt; at that time I had even never played a tambourine but uh coming through the gate I was playing a tambourine &gt;&gt; and it has seven colors Well, I didn't even know what that was. I thought it was a decorated &gt;&gt; tambourine. That's why nobody in this message can take my tambourine away from me. Cuz I know I played it there. I didn't even understand it. I remember being fearful &gt;&gt; because Jesus was watching everybody but me I mean sorry he was watching me and everybody else was coming through and I'm thinking why is he watching me in my dream it is a dream I'm just telling a dream but I was afraid and I was feeling so unworthy further that he wasn't going to let me in. But then the Lord quickened to me, &gt;&gt; you were already in. Salt clothed people. &gt;&gt; That's why I say, &gt;&gt; excuse me, &gt;&gt; I know it's in my day. I know it's in my day when the door of the Gentiles would be closed why he showed me that at a young age I thought but just at the moment that I thought he would not take me in a moment in a quinking second I stood in front of Jesus and you know what he did to me? He lifted me up. &gt;&gt; And you might not believe it, but he kissed me on my lips. I woke up screaming. &gt;&gt; And that anointing that I was to soon experience was all over me like a cloud. God is my witness. I lie not. I ran into my mother's room. She was a real Christian. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Mama, &gt;&gt; I just dreamed about Jesus." &gt;&gt; And I began to tell her about Jesus. &gt;&gt; And uh she I scared her half to death. &gt;&gt; It was in the night. She woke up when I told her that. &gt;&gt; She said the wrong things. She said, "Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God done call my son to preach." &gt;&gt; I walked out of her room. &gt;&gt; All of that experience &gt;&gt; went. I didn't want to be nobody's preacher. And I said to myself, I'm not going back to church. Be a preacher. &gt;&gt; I suffer. I got scars. &gt;&gt; God took my mama &gt;&gt; and he told me that's why he took her. &gt;&gt; Because I wasn't obedient. So you see &gt;&gt; I know when God wants you to do something, &gt;&gt; you got to do it &gt;&gt; or else he will drive you to do it. I had been led tried. He tried to leave me for years. Pride would not let me go. &gt;&gt; That's why you see me saying things that no other preacher say. Because I'm about saying what he wants me and not what others might want. And I know I would be judged. by others who were saying, "Brother Brooks is off to work. But it doesn't matter. I'm preaching to the bride. &gt;&gt; That's all I'm here for. She'll get it if nobody else will." Now, let's go to Isaiah 53. There's more to that. Every time &gt;&gt; I would get really sad &gt;&gt; when I was in the Pentecostal church, &gt;&gt; God would always bring that dream back to me. When I came to this message was the only time I understood what the dream meant. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53 &gt;&gt; 1 through 12. I'm going let you go. &gt;&gt; Says, "Who have believed our report? &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, &gt;&gt; and a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor calmliness. [Music] And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is despised and rejected of men. &gt;&gt; Bride, you were there. &gt;&gt; You were in him. &gt;&gt; This is why you are have been already equipped &gt;&gt; to take rejection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right? A man of sorrows &gt;&gt; and acquainted with grief. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where did he get this grief? Where did he get his? &gt;&gt; It was from his own house. His enemy was from his own house, from the church. Hallelujah. And we hid as it were our faces from him. [Music] &gt;&gt; He was despised. &gt;&gt; And we esteemed him not. So much so Jesus said, "A prophet is without honor &gt;&gt; in his own country. &gt;&gt; Surely he have borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted." &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; We've gone through nothing compared to the church ages before us. Hallelujah. But he was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we are healed. Not will be healed. We are healed. And we all like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all. Think about it. &gt;&gt; Even when brother Brandham judged that woman with the purple hair and the purple nail. Hallelujah. God had to straighten him out. Hallelujah. See what I'm saying? If God straighten the prophet out, he going to straighten you out. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't even know who the woman was, &gt;&gt; but he says such things as this. &gt;&gt; She was a thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the prophet, &gt;&gt; but to God, she was a daughter. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? You can't judge people by the way they look. [Music] &gt;&gt; Who could have looked more holy than the Pharisees? Hallelujah. But God came to his own. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He came to a blind man. &gt;&gt; A woman with issue of blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said those who are healthy, they don't need a physician. Hallelujah. I don't know about you. &gt;&gt; I need him as a physician. &gt;&gt; He was oppressed. He was afflicted. that he open not his what? &gt;&gt; He is bought as a lamb to the slaughter. Hallelujah. And as a sheep before the sheer is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. Hallelujah. People going to say what they want to say. They'll make lies on you. They're going to do everything they can do. Hallelujah. But why stir the fire? &gt;&gt; Leave it. &gt;&gt; Go down on your knees in prayer. Pray. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's how that's our warfare. That's our war weapons. He was taken from prison and from judgment. And who shall declare as this generation? But he was cut out out of the land of the living for the transgression of people was he stricken. Hallelujah. Who's going to who's going to declare his generation? We are. We are. I am. And he made his grave with the wicked &gt;&gt; and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence. &gt;&gt; Neither was any deceit in his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you we're talking about brother Brooks. &gt;&gt; It was Nicodemus &gt;&gt; who helped Joseph &gt;&gt; to bury Jesus &gt;&gt; among the rich. But he was prophesied &gt;&gt; with the rich in his death. &gt;&gt; It can't be a coincidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Nicodemus &gt;&gt; and Joseph &gt;&gt; was there to take his body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus truly became a believer. &gt;&gt; Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief &gt;&gt; when thou hath shall make his soul on an offering for sin. &gt;&gt; 10th verse, he shall see his seed. &gt;&gt; He shall see his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he died. &gt;&gt; He shall see his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his handsper. I'm almost done. Just he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge shall thy my righteous servants justify thee. For he shall bear their iniquities. How many of y'all know what iniquities is? to do to know to do good and do it. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide a spoil with the strong because he have poured out his soul against him. And he was numbered with the transgressors and he beared the sins of many and made intercession for the transgression. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say it like this. If you can't see yourself in this scripture, ask God to give it to you. His suffering &gt;&gt; was our suffering. &gt;&gt; His victory was our victory and we shouldn't be worried about anything. Don't let the devil take your joy because that's where your strength lies. Know that you you you've got a resting place. It doesn't matter what you go through. You lose your house, you lose a car, you lose different things in this world, but blessed be the name of the Lord. For the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. your understanding. This is a time that we should be rejoicing so much, but God didn't allow me to go that way. For whatever reason, there's somebody that needs to hear or needed to hear what's being said. Backsliding doesn't mean to go backwards. Backsliding means not to go forward. When a cow backs slide, &gt;&gt; a cow backslides, &gt;&gt; he buckles his knees &gt;&gt; and refuse to go forward. And that's what happens to many. We're just stuck. We're not going forward. You got to go forward. You don't go backwards. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; You got to see progress within yourself because Jesus said in that day, you'll know that I'm in the Father, the Father is in me and I am. You've got to know that. Now, I'm I'm I'm like I said &gt;&gt; went a different way &gt;&gt; than I expected. But I pray that God &gt;&gt; has touched somebody this morning other than with the thought that I'm going too long. &gt;&gt; But my desire is to see souls saved. &gt;&gt; My desire is to see people overcome. themselves overcome tradition or overcome things that have been taught that doesn't ma that match up with the word only the word the purity of the word that's all we'll make it it's up to us God gives us that choice yet still he know who will and who who Many of us, we've made so many mistakes. Perhaps you think you're not savable. But let me say it like this. You're not worth that much. That God can't pay the price for you. He's already paid the price and he wants you to be free. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what it must have been for the children of Israel under Pharaoh's bondage? They got out of Egypt &gt;&gt; and they for quickly forgot &gt;&gt; and they went back in bondage, &gt;&gt; but not by the Pharaoh in Egypt, &gt;&gt; but they were came in bondage will &gt;&gt; by disbelieving &gt;&gt; the words of Moses. You love God. &gt;&gt; God is so good to us &gt;&gt; and I really appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. What we're going to do. &gt;&gt; We're going to sing a song. &gt;&gt; We're dismissed for those who are not here to take communion. I'll say I'll give you a half hour 15 minutes, whatever it is. You can either go out and uh and then come back in for those who want to. It's a quarter. It's about a quarter to one. &gt;&gt; Let's just give you 15 minutes. So, by the grace of God, we'll &gt;&gt; come back in and start uh our communion service &gt;&gt; at at 1:00. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; So, we love the Lord &gt;&gt; and um I I just uh pray that somehow &gt;&gt; that the time You could be doing something that's not even sinful. &gt;&gt; If it's taking your time with God, &gt;&gt; you need to give that up and give it to God. Idolatry doesn't mean you're bowing down before idol. Idolatry means you become idols. We call it, &gt;&gt; "Oh, I'm so bored." &gt;&gt; Why are you bored when you got the word? &gt;&gt; When God died, he died so we could have fellowship with him. Why? But we're not having fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Fellowship don't mean just coming to church. fellowship with him every day, all day if you can. That's what he wants. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; When you get to heaven, &gt;&gt; what kind of fellowship you going to have there, won't be no football game, won't be no iPads, no, it won't be any of that. Everything will be focused on Christ. everything. &gt;&gt; So the Christian, the true Christian &gt;&gt; never gets bored with God. blessed day. [Music] Your grace and mercy brought me through.

Communion uh to me is out of the all of the services that we have, it's uh to me the most precious one. a communion &gt;&gt; and always would be afraid &gt;&gt; not to take it bread and the wine because I could always find where I had done something wrong. Um, I know by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; the only way you'll ever be faithful in taking communion &gt;&gt; is to understand the grace of God. Communion is not set to judge us to death. &gt;&gt; It is a witness that you have life. That's why the Bible said that you examine yourself, &gt;&gt; not your neighbor yourself. &gt;&gt; And when you your earnest desire to do the perfect will of God you &gt;&gt; because that is the Holy Spirit in you. Now whether we ever live perfectly is not the case. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ lived perfectly for us. &gt;&gt; But he wants us to acknowledge &gt;&gt; that is because it's it's because of his communion. You know, he said don't don't forget this. Don't forget this. When he was doing the last supper, he said don't forget this. If you forget this, you forget me. &gt;&gt; You forget what I've done for you. &gt;&gt; And that's why I love communion. As far as I'm concerned, we don't have it regularly enough. I think about the death, burial, and resurrection. Jesus Christ, all he did for us. We can't imagine the suffering that he went through. And we are acknowledging within ourselves that we do understand. We're partakers of this. These we are partakers of this and and the breaking of the bread is the breaking of his body and which he did on Calvary. &gt;&gt; His body was broken. &gt;&gt; But a spiritual body The Holy Spirit was &gt;&gt; on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; He gave them himself. &gt;&gt; And in this communion &gt;&gt; to say amen to the Lord &gt;&gt; for giving us himself. Amen. As we stand, we'll read the word according to first Corinthians the 11th chapter. And it reads, "For I have received of the Lord that which was also in which he was betrayed, took bread, &gt;&gt; and when he had given thanks, he break it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. &gt;&gt; After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do eat as often as you drink it in remeance of me. For as often as you do eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. For let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. &gt;&gt; For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthy, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. &gt;&gt; For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. So did y'all hear that? If we judge ourselves, so there be anything that's in your life or anything that you need to correct with God, this would be the time. &gt;&gt; But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tar one for another. &gt;&gt; If any man hunger, let him h let him eat at home. Let you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest I will set in order when I come. participants. I don't know like you come forward. You might have to form a line going that way. Just one line. Jesus pray of God of faith. He invites his chosen people coming. [Music] and supplies our every [Music] call. Come and die. Oh, you may feast in Jesus table all the time. [Music] He will f the multitude. Turn the water into wine to the hungry call. Come and die. [Music] Come and die. The master call. Come and die. [Music] You may feast in Jesus table all the time. All the time he will fit. He turned the water into life. To the hungry cold come and die. [Music] The disciples came to thus obeying Christ command for the master called to them command there the foul their hearts bread and Fish upon the fire. Does he sisfies the hungry every time? Oh, just come and die. The master callth come and die. You may feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitudes turned the water into wine to the hungry. &gt;&gt; Let us bow. Heavenly Father God, we come before you. We thank you for this time of communion. Lord, it is a celebration one with reverence and respect. We pray father god &gt;&gt; as we have broken your bread &gt;&gt; which is representative of your body. &gt;&gt; We know it's not the literal body but father you told us to do this in honor of you. So Lord as we partake of this bread we pray that you would heal any that is sick any that is affected. Lord, we pray that you would bless them &gt;&gt; in your name, Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. As we partake of the blood of this wine that represents your blood, Father, we pray that you bless each and every soul tonight &gt;&gt; and give us a double portion of your holy spirit. Lord your prophet of God said we need a refilling every day. I pray father God you give these who have stayed in honor of your word refilling of your &gt;&gt; hallelujah of your holy spirit every day. We be careful to give you the praise glory in your name Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Soon will take his bride to be ever at his side. [Music] The host of heaven will assemble. All will be a glorious sight. All the saints in spotless white and with Jesus they will feast eternally. Oh come and die the master call. Come and die [Music] at Jesus devil all the time. He will be the multitude. Turn the water into one to the hungry. [Music] Yes. Yeah, we're going to do the &gt;&gt; brother [Music] inside the church and then the sisters. [Music] Fill my cup Lord. I lift it up Lord. Just come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I walk no more. Here is my cup. Fill it up and make me fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench this thirst in my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more. Here is my cup. Fill me up and make me. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. [Music] Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven. Feed me till I walk. [Music] Here's my cup. Fill me up and make me [Music] [Music] I trust that every one of you feel as good inside as I feel. &gt;&gt; There was one thing that I did from that dream &gt;&gt; is that when I did see Jesus, &gt;&gt; he looked like the heart. &gt;&gt; And I can remember from that time on telling people when we did see another picture of Jesus that wasn't him, &gt;&gt; I didn't know other than what I did see. Please, I'm not trying to be no greater than any other pastor or preacher. &gt;&gt; But I believe that was a personal message to me and you know I shared it with the church. Trust that you will have more confidence in the word. The word is true. &gt;&gt; We're going to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; And I'm so excited about time that I'm living in. &gt;&gt; We got all these things happening, &gt;&gt; but it vindicates the word. It proves Brother Brandon was who he said he was. Everything we see has been is being fulfilled so quickly. And I just want people to constantly watch Jesus. Let's not think like Peter when the storms come. &gt;&gt; Let's keep focused. &gt;&gt; And if we were to sniff, &gt;&gt; he did pull Peter back up. So our destiny is positive and I love it. I'm just with all the things I go through on a daily basis. mental bound of that nature. I have a hiding place just like you and that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; So what we're going to do, we're going to do our foot and then we'll assemble back in here and then we'll be sisters in the best. Thank you. Somebody took our towels and I just keep forgetting to buy more. [Music] You always fill my heart with songs of whenever I am afraid. I will trust you. I will trust in you.

I don't know about everybody else. &gt;&gt; I need the mercy and grace of God every day, all day. &gt;&gt; And I'm so I know how unworthy I am. And I I stand even as a pastor only because he's worthy. I rest on his word. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I just uh I love the people of God. &gt;&gt; I love uh this I don't know how you call it. &gt;&gt; What I go through the the journey &gt;&gt; has been wonderful. &gt;&gt; There have been hills there. There have been trenches, &gt;&gt; digital, &gt;&gt; you know, you name it. We've gone through a lot. &gt;&gt; But I can truly say it's been worth it. &gt;&gt; Every moment of it. You know, I I used to see my mom &gt;&gt; enjoying Jesus. &gt;&gt; I had no idea what it was about. I'd read the scriptures to get happy. &gt;&gt; And to me, I didn't even understand what I was reading. &gt;&gt; But when the word becomes life to you, &gt;&gt; oh, you're never alone. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; words cannot express This day means so much to me. &gt;&gt; All the toils, all the trials, all the rises and the falls been taken care of. &gt;&gt; You were worthy to take the book and loose the seals thereof to reveal to us your love for us. Not just in time but for time again. Thank you father desire to have the love that you have living through me. Bless her bless each and every one of us. As we are open to Amen. Amen.
