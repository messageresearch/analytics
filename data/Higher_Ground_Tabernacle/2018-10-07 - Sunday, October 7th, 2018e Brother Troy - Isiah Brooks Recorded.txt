I'll be going Amen god bless it's good to see y'all again this evening amen where two or three are gathered in his name Amen I'm here to meet with him hey red I'm here to hear what he would say unto me and I never come to those curtains but what I come through with a purpose a meant to meet with him face to face to hear what he would say to me hey man let's just open in our Bibles to the book of first Kings chapter 1 I've preached from the scripture a long long time ago and I just wanted to revisit it this scripture is just it's an amazing one to me because it has to do with who is king over your life amen and that's what I want to say that I'll be the title for the scene Eunice who is king over your life Amen because no matter what we got to make it plain a we got to make it clear so they all know who is king over our lives amen so first kings chapter 1 we'll start with the fifth verse King David had 19 sons amen and he promised unto Bathsheba speaking by permission by Jehovah himself that Solomon would reign after David said amen and God had told King David by by the Prophet Nathan that David's son would build the temple because David would not be able to build it amen so so but but in first Kings chapter 1 it's an era has seen thing that somehow somehow in the kingdom that there was room for another one of David's sons to rise up and declare themselves to be king instead of Solomon amen amen I don't know how it happened it should not have happened this way amen it should not have happened this way let's go ahead and read through it first Kings chapter 1 we'll start with the fifth verse and this is speaking of David's son a torneio says then add an ayah the son of hagas exalted himself saying I will be king he prepared himself chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him and his father that's David had not displeased them at any time in saying why hast thou done so and also he was a fairly goodly man and his mother bear him after Absalom he confirmed with Joab that's the the commander of David's army the son of Zechariah and with a BA thar the priest that's one of the men that bore the Ark of the Covenant and they followed a danaiah and helped him but knock the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimai and rey and the mighty men which belong to david were not with a Tenaya and a danaiah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of xoauth which is by in regal and he called all of his brethren the king's sons and all the men of judah the king's servants but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and Solomon his brother he called none where for Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon saying hast thou not hurt that Aniyah the son of hagas death reigned and david our lord knoweth it not a malicious bow our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for this word Lord we pray that right now in the name of Jesus Christ that you would make it plain to us Lord and you speak to us exactly in a way Lord that we need to hear this evening father Lord that it might be plain Loretha who is king over our lives and we just dedicate this service into your name Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can you can be seated so David as he was kind of in his Middle Ages you know he bore two sons Absalom and this Adonai ABAI one of his wives called hagas and you know the story of how Absalom and rose up and tried to have David removed from the throne and and when David was leaving Jerusalem being kicked out of his own kingdom that two of the priests got decided well if David's leaving the kingdom we're going to take the Ark of the Covenant with us because if the king is leaving Jerusalem then we're going to take the ark with us and so the tzaddik that we mentioned here and and the other priests that followed along with the son had an ayah they twit and they took the Ark of the Covenant a few other priests and they left Jerusalem and when as David was leaving Jerusalem being kicked out of Jerusalem being kicked out of his own position as being King by his son Absalom but but when he saw the Ark of the Covenant leaving Jerusalem he looked back and he said to those priests he said he said don't let the Ark of the Covenant leave Jerusalem take it back to where it belongs and if the Lord be pleased with me he will make me and reinstate me as king amen but if the Lord has not pleased with me he will not let me be rejoined with Ark of the Covenant again hey man that was the confidence that David had in his God that he knew that he was linked with the Ark of the Covenant amen he David knew who he was amen he knew that he was king over Israel he knew that God had chosen him he knew that he had a divine commission to be who he was in his exact station and none there's nothing that man could do to hinder him from being while he was supposed to be amen so when he so when his own son Absalom rose up and tried to remove his dad from being King and David was being was fleeing his own throne was fleeing his own capital city that when the priests decided to take the arm of the Ark of the Covenant and follow him out of the city that David looked back and had such a confidence that God would restore him back to the kingship that he said make sure the Ark of the Covenant stays this place if God be pleased with me he will bring me back to his presence amen because you know we all get to those points in our lives where where we don't know what's going on or we get we get maybe a little bit frustrated or a little bit troubled you know and maybe it feels like the the presence of God is separate us from a season you know but but you know though matter what we have we know who we are amen we know who we are we know that God chose us and not going that but God chose us for the day that we're living in amen and it was God it wasn't someone else called us in placed us here it wasn't that any man could place us where we are but God Himself drew us called us by our name filled us with the Holy Ghost and placed us right here in this church amen so even if we don't necessarily feel the presence of the Lord we know that we cannot be separated from a man no matter where we are in life's journey we have that confidence with God where he said I will never leave you nor forsake you by all I will always be with you even until the end of the age Amen we have that as a prophet as a promise no matter what our flesh testifies sometimes what are mine testify sometimes we have that as a promise and David had that same promise Amen because the Bible says that when he was anointed with the oil that the Holy Spirit of God was with them the rest of the days of his life amen so he said let the ark go back God will let it be where it's supposed to be because God will make sure that I am going to be where I'm supposed to be amen so every point of our life God is going to make sure that were where we're supposed to be amen there's no reason to get frustrated a man there's no reason to worry amen everything's running right on time amen God has a plan Amen God has a purpose a man he foreordained our walk before the foundation of the world amen and our trials were forward aim before the foundation of the world amen and so we have placed our entire trusting God and we have acknowledged him that he is the king of our lives he has responded that we were baptized in his name and he brought the evidence back filled us with this Holy Ghost and here we stand filled with the Holy Spirit and we are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the king of our life amen and we got to glorify Him as king amen we got to acknowledge him that he is the key payment but somehow in as time went on that as as when when David's two sons Absalom and a denial were growing up that God or that David received a promise that one of your sons will be heir on your throne after you amen and that son will build the temple and then God went back and he revealed unto David that that son was gonna be Solomon who was born later amen that that son would be Solomon so as David is getting older somehow that was not expressed strong enough and there was room in the kingdom for another man toward another one of David's sons to rise up and declare himself to be king payment so I just want to read a little bit further into this story here let's go to let's go back to first Kings chapter 1 and we'll go ahead and read from the 39th first but before that Bathsheba she goes into the King and she tells King David what's going on and and because she's concerned that David doesn't realize what's Dave's getting old he doesn't know what's going on his own kingdom and when she expresses to him she says didn't you promise me by the name of Jehovah that my son Solomon would be king after you how is it now that this man this that Solomon's brother at ania is now proclaiming himself to be king a mess let's read from verse 39 of the first chapter and zatox was there these are now operating by David's instructions here it says and Zadok the priest took a Horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save King Solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them now what's going on this is right in the middle of adonai ahead all the men together with them he's gathered up all of his everybody he could find there would be an agreement with him Amen he didn't call the Prophet because he knew the Prophet wouldn't agree with what he was doing a man he didn't call the captain of the army because he knew the captain of David's army wouldn't agree with them they called he went didn't call Solomon he didn't call Bathsheba a man because he knew that they would not be an agree with them but he found men that didn't know the promise of God for that day and he got those to agree with them you see the ones that didn't know the God's promise for that day were the ones that were able to be swayed by so so he goes and he gets he goes he gets some of their army they'll go with him they didn't know the promise he found a couple priests that didn't know the promise he found a a few other men didn't know the promise but he couldn't get any of the mighty men to come because they knew the promise a man and what he does is he gathered them a big entourage and they marched into this feast room and they killed the fattened calf and they threw a grand party and adonai arose up and gave a great speech about how God seen Jehovah has or now ordained me to be king instead of David and he proclaimed and said I am now king amen so a think about his name said Jehovah his name meant the Lord is Jehovah Jehovah is Lord that's what the name Adonai amines you can almost hear his speech now where he's saying you know does this seem good that God our Jehovah our Father a seen fit to establish me who is whose very name means the Lord Java is Lord you know and you know you can imagine the speech that he would have given but in the midst of this feast is in the midst of this party the very midst of this party they're having a celebration they're having a good time they're all rejoicing over the new king at ania amen and all of a sudden they begin to hear a noise and they begin to hear this noise and they want to know what and everybody is thinking what is going on and over just a few blocks away the emissaries of Solomon are coming marching into town yeah the true king over Israel let's read that again from verse 39 says and Zadok the priest took a Horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save King Solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so the earth writ with the sound of them and a danaiah and all the guests were that were with him heard it as they are made an end of eating and when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being an uproar and while he yet spake behold Johnson the son of a birth are the priests King and I Anaya said unto him come in Flour a valiant man and bring us good tidings and John as an answer and said a danaiah verily our Lord King David has made Solomon King now the party is coming to an abrupt stop amen amen let's keep reading here amen and the King has sent him with him Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Bera and i--i the son of jehoiada Terah thights and the fellow fights and they have caused him to ride upon the Kings mule and the Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him King in jehan and they are come up from thence rejoicing so the city rang again this is the noise which he have heard and also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom moreover the Kings servants came to bless our Lord King David saying God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and God make his throne greater than I throne and the King bowed himself upon the bed and also the thus saith the looking blessed be the Lord God of Israel which has given me one to sit on the throne this day my eyes even seen it now watched verse 49 and all the guests that were without an ayah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way and a don't I have feared because of Solomon and arose and went and cut hold of the horns of the altar he was looking for mercy Amen all the guests in that party were suddenly afraid yo that's going to happen again one of these days that's going to happen again one of these days there are a lot of people in this world to have chosen who they believe escaped amen everybody's done it everybody on this planet has chosen someone that they believe this King or something something over their life this is the direction of my life this is what's going to rain from my life like the like the the man that brother man talk about who had that sign on his shirt I am a fool for Christ and then we went by he saw in the back of a sure he said whose fool are you everybody's going to worship someone everybody's gonna worship something and the reason what what really gets my mind thinking about this is how is it possible that in the midst of just a few miles from Jerusalem that somehow a danaiah had an opportunity together that many people around him even to the upper people like Joab of the army the captain of the host of the army and different ones and some of the priests that bore the Ark of the Covenant always how did he convince all these people but somehow what God's promised for that day it was not clear enough that they didn't know who was supposed to be king amen and sometimes I think about our own stuff do we know who ought to be king over our lives amen do our actions prove that we know who ought to be king of our lives there are things that we say and do prove that we know who ought to be king over our life amen are we are our actions bearing testimony that we know the promise of God for this hour hey man do we really are we really testifying that that God is king Amen is our life telling about that hey man think about the time of Esther Amen you know you remember the story of Esther you know she was they had the King as earth and his Queen was Vashti Amen and King Azeris said I'm gonna throw me a feast for a hundred and eighty days and I'm going to show I'm gonna bring together all my Lords and governors from all across the land and gather them together here in the capital city and I'm gonna spend a hundred and eighty days declaring who great my kingdom is and all the glories of it and at the end of his of his hundred eighty day feast he decided to top it all off with showing off the greatest glory of his kingdom which was bash T and when he said I'm gonna spend seven days showing the the glory of my Queen Vashti and he when he called for her that the whole time he found out that the whole time he had this 180 day feast that she had a parallel feast going on up in her chamber she had a parallel feast the King was down here having his feast and Vashti was up here having her own feast and somehow in vast she's feast it got this thing as fervor came up in their minds that she was so so great and she'd glorify her own self that even when the King called for her to come that she thought the her feast was somehow greater than the Kings feasts and she decided not to come amen so in when King Azura saw that his wife was had her own church service going on amen and she had her as she was up there having her own church service or having her own worship service Amen glorifying something other than the king Amen not glorifying the king that that somehow whatever that whatever songs they were singing in that worship service we're not bringing glory to God we're not bringing glory to the king amen and so when the King called for her to come and serve him her mind was not even on the same level of what the Kings mind and what happened she was sent and she was cast out into outer darkness why because her mind hurt her motives her objectives were not the Kings moaning and echoes she was part of a different feast than the Kings feast a man saw God you he where he rose up Esther to be queen in bath she's dead because she knew how to bring glory to the king Amen let's let's turn over to Romans chapter 1 glorifying him as God our brother Isiah preached message several years ago called glorify Him as God and that's where I got this this verse from Amen Romans 1 verse 21 it says because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were they thankful but came became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools amen he's talking about people that know God people that knew God but somehow their knowledge of a God did not allow them to glorify God as God a man now God is the all-powerful creator of the heavens and the earth maybe our minds don't actually sometimes quite grasp who God is but he is a much greater being than we can even imagine a man he is a much bigger being than we can imagine a man when we get stuck in our day-to-day lives we sometimes we don't quite glorify him the way that we ought to and we don't realize the position that we have been given as the as the Queen as you know as Queen Esther amen amen as the bride of Lord Jesus Christ amen do you realize what that means amen when you think of how great the heavens are how far it is how far can way are those stars amen you know who created Mars who created Jupiter who created all these planets where did all this come from why is this earth covered with life why is it that when I go 10,000 feet deep in the ocean you can find lot I mean why is it their way you go to the top of the highest mountain there's something why is it that even in the desert there's something living there why is it in the forest they're filled with life why is there life everywhere in this plan because there's a living God that has taken interest in this planet amen and he has chosen us to be his bride amen oh we ought to glorify Him as God hey man you remember how in uh in Daniel in the Book of Daniel when King Belteshazzar Amen they had they had taken over Jerusalem King Nebuchadnezzar a man they took over Jerusalem they took all of the all of the ornaments and all of the gold out of the temple of Jehovah and they carried it on carts all the way to Babylon five hundred miles away and now all of the things that Solomon had created to serve the temple now four hundred years later are on the back of a cart heading towards Babylon you know and and Nebuchadnezzar his son or grandson now comes upon the throne he's throwing a feast again there's another feast through we had the feast of a tonight we had the feast of king of Zeus and Vashti now we have the feast of belteshazzar and keep the beltasar decides to throw a feast I need a size to use for his food service items for this feast to go down and get the vessels from Jerusalem from the God Jehovah that they had conquered and as he goes and he has this drunken feast and Babylon as they gather together all the all the elements for the sacrifices all the elements for the drinking and the communion and all the things they were meant to be for the high priests of sacrifice unto Jehovah now to be on this drunken feasts of King Belshazzar that in the midst of that feast all sudden this hand appears in midair and begins writing on the wall many many up Hazel Tarkin and and the King Belteshazzar he he looks at that and he's his knees start trembling his legs started knocking together you know and he's he wants to know what is this hand that is writing on the wall and what does it mean and Daniel was brought in to interpret the writing on the wall and he says you have been weighed in the back and you've been found wanting in the middle of the feast a sudden fear came upon amen now think about it a denial was in the middle of his feast and they heard the noise and a sudden fear came upon them the real king was being shown Queen Vashti was in the middle of her feast and a sudden fear came over her when the soldiers came and cast her in outer darkness amen King Belshazzar II a hand shows up without a body and starts riding on the wall and he's a sudden fear the music stopped amen the party ceased no one took another drink and he wanted to know what is going on and all of a sudden as the interpretation goes out they began to hear the banging on the walls as the as the neighboring int as the enemy's armies were banging on the gates of the city and as soon as the prophecy went out and was interpreted that this night you shall be slain amen and that man was slain that king he thought he knew who he was he thought he knew he thought he was safe where he was but in the midst of another feast again as they were feasting they became suddenly afraid a danaiah and a feast became afraid Vashti in the middle of a feast became afraid and now what King Belshazzar in the middle of a feast became free why because they did they knew God they knew a God they glorified different things as God but they didn't know the one true God amen and as we said there in Romans 1:21 it says but because when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were they thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened why because they knew who he was why because we can see his life all over this planet someone has planted life all over this planet this entire planet has been covered in life where do they come from as you know I as I I'll never forget this thing I heard a long time it goes you know they got that organization called SETI that they have these radio towers that are searching the Stars waiting for some signal to come from a alien race out there and they're and they're saying if they can just find a radio signal coming from the heavens that they'll know that there's life and some other planet but yeah if you take a microscope and you examine the cells and you see the DNA of every creature and you can't even tell that there is your signal right there a man that someone put their signal down into the deepest depths of the ocean so we'll put their signal on the top of every mountain a man in the middle of every desert in the middle of the rainforest in the middle of us say man there is a signal the DNA of God when God spoke let there be let there be let there be a mint the signal is there God is a lot amen amen like we said this morning you know God when he when he quit his when he put his word a mint when he went we went to create the heavens and the earth he spoke he and speak to the plants to raise up the plants he spoke to the dirt he told the dirt bring up the plants he put his word into the earth and the earth brought forth exactly what was supposed to be a man when he wanted to create the fish he put his word in the water and let the water bring forth the fish he meant when he wanted to create a bride a husband and a wife a man after his own image he spoke to himself let us let us bring forth man and rose so what happens when you take the fish out of the water he dies when you take the tree out of the out of the dirt it dies if we take the man out of God what happens he dies amen amen so so now this is three feasts that we mentioned where they were worshiping their own worshiping their own thoughts and then suddenly a fear came over them when the true Creon was revealed lesser to revelations chapter 18 amen rub she's 18 verse 2 it says and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and has become a habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through their abundance of her delicacies what's happening again it's another feast again this whole world is feasting again yes amen it's just the same as same as the feasts of Belteshazzar it's the same as the feast of a sh t they are rejoicing they think they know who the god of their life is but in the midst of this feast the real God is gonna be exposed as gonna be revealed amen God will be revealed as the king over this earth it will be revealed in our day who the creator of the heavens and the earth is amen it will be revealed in our day who created the heavens and the earth yes and then some will go into everlasting torment a meant a sudden fear will come over them you know when the rapture takes place let's turn over to Luke 22 actually while we're right here when the rapture takes place I'm gonna be excited amen hey man Luke 22 verse 10 and says Jesus said and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entered a thin and ye shall say unto the Goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples and he shall show you a large upper room furnished as their make ready and they went and they found as he had said unto them and they made ready for the Passover and when the hour was come he sat down in the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until be fulfilled again in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come amen God is waiting to have another feast again amen he's he had his day now the disciples they had their feast and his cycles were filled with the Holy Ghost we've been filled with the Holy Ghost we are waiting for this feast to come again Amen we are gonna feasts with him I mean I think about the whole world it's going crazy amen what are the stock markets doing great amen you know the the everybody the the the plenty of money floating around you know that people are comfortable even the poorest people in our land or living pretty comfortable you know you think about how the poor were 500 years ago compared to the poor today you know the the whole world is feasting the whole world is feasting and they're there marching towards an event that's been prophesied but they have no knowledge of it just like in King ad and ayah or when we'd had an Iowa is rising up and proclaiming I am gonna be king over Jerusalem he didn't realize the prophecy had already gone out that his brother Salman was gonna be king but because of a lack of knowledge of the prophecy he set himself up for failure and when he was in the midst of the midst of of enjoying the fruits of his of his thoughts amen he had worked up this this thing in his mind and had worshiped this idea in his mind that Aniyah could be king i could be king I can write my father David he was a great king and now when my father Devi is growing old he's getting ready to die and now III Aaron ayah will be king in my father's stead but not knowing he worshiped this idea in his mind so strongly until he got to the point they could not accept that the prophecy of God cannot be failed okay not shot a man so is it already the prophecy of God this it's gonna come to pass amen there in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed amen there that now as much people can feast all they want to they can feast on the things of the world amen they can feast on the on the the foolishness of of this world but no the prophecy is still true amen it doesn't matter how much how much you work it up in your mind if you go into that direction there will come a date we're in the midst of your comfort there will be a sudden fear you'll come upon a mint why because the real king will be made known amen amen like we said this morning you know that with the brooding of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit was brooding back in the in the beginning amen and what was he doing he's still brooding today a man the Holy Spirit was brooding in the days of Noah look he what was he looking for he's looking for a place to rest amen they saw in the day in the days of the creation the Holy Spirit brooded over the face of the earth way till he called the earth come on amen in the days of Noah the whole the dove was brooding over the waters what to do it was looking for a place to rest amen so I went back to where I could rest and well a man when John the Baptist was was was the voice taught talking to him said the one that you see the Holy Spirit resting on and remaining on that is the Son of God amen and so it's not the one that the Holy Spirit comes and goes it's not the one that has can just rejoice bus one that the Holy Spirit comes down on and remains on a mint that's where the Dove and saw what the Dove was looking for a place to rest where we're now think about it all the times throughout the Old Testament that the Dove visited amen all the times that people say I saw God face-to-face what was me how many times did angels visit in the Old Testament amen but they never stayed they never remained they cut they would come and then they would go the angel will come and speak to Zacharias you know the angel came and spoke to Hanna the angel will come and speak to you know David her to Abraham but they always come and there go they come and they go a man by now on Jesus Christ this Holy Spirit comes down like a dove and he stays and he remains and so the angel told John the Baptist where the one where you see the Holy Spirit coming down and remaining upon that is the Son of God amen now what now what was that the Holy Spirit was brooding over the earth and it found again another creation that it could rest on Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God amen now in the thirty-three years later the Holy Spirit still brooding on the earth looking for a place to rest or to do it came down like tongues of fire upon their heads the Holy Spirit found a place and what did he do it now all sudden they couldn't see the tongues of fire any more where to go it went into their hearts why because the Holy Spirit came down he is brooding brooding birdy and all of a sudden he found place to land in the Upper Room any state and he is recreating the Garden of Eden out of those men Amen we still doing the same the Holy Spirit is still brooding looking for a place to rest still looking for a place where he can land amen and have his rest amen amen amen amen you know brother Brandon said that there was a three full purpose of the mystery of God being revealed in this hour you know you know he said that the three-fold purpose of God's entire creation was revealed in this hour and he said it was what God was to be manifested fully in Christ in one body so we could see him we could handle him we could know what he thinks like we could know how he acts we know why God when God we know we know what God's thoughts are towards the sick because when God was manifest in the flesh he healed to say Amen we know what God's thoughts were towards the sinners because when he was down here in the flesh he forgave the sinners amen we know a God's thoughts were towards those that were in prison because he set the captives free amen we know that God was completely revealed in Jesus Christ amen and we know that God has thoughts of fellowship why because he drew 12 men to himself to fellowship with them amen amen going to do he kept he loved Mary he loved Martha he loved he loved the 12 disciples he he loved a Lazarus we know that he loves fellowship I mean and we know that he is the same he has been revealed that revelation has been set free it can never go and it can never be changed was it I then what was the second for that was Christ was now after being completely revealed in Jesus Christ now God was gonna do the same thing in us and reveal himself inside of us it's still going on amen while the world is feasting with their feast we are feasting with the supper table amen amen what are we doing what are we doing we're we're eating the fruits of the Tree of Life love joy peace longsuffering a mint like I was saying this morning you know as watching all that Supreme Court stuff and and all the stuff that's going on the Senate and House representatives in Washington DC I was like my if if do unto others as you would have them do unto you all sudden visited those Senate chambers things would change you know if a little bit of love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness long-suffering we're to enter into those Senate chambers this country would change amen but it's not gonna happen amen it's prophesy it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse there's no reason to get angry about it there's no angry to fuss about it Amen Jesus didn't fuss about the Romans Amen week there's no reason for us to fuss about the Americans amen it's it this prophesied the Lamb the country that rose up like a lamb is gonna speak like a dragon it just it is what it is amen but but we are what we are and the tree of life bears fruits and the fruits of life inside of you is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness meekness amen temperance against these things there is no law why because when you have the Tree of Life that was in the Garden of Eden I mean it was the Holy Spirit brooded over the waters created land to come out of the waters a mint created a garden called Eden off over here and then the Holy Spirit came down and planted itself and called itself the Tree of Life why he found a place where he could have rest amen The Tree of Life found a place where it could rest and took up roots and had more fruits a man now that same spirit is still here amen now the The Tree of Life had thus flaming swords they were protecting the way no one could get back to the Tree of Life throughout all the Old Testament even though the Tree of Life kept busy in them kept busy in them they couldn't get they couldn't grab a hold of it they couldn't grasp it they couldn't keep it Amen but all they could do is I believe unto it Amen but now the Tree of Life reappeared again as Jesus Christ and walked amongst men amen and now the Tree of Life is has taken roots inside of a bride has bearing the fruits of the Spirit in our lives love joy peace longsuffering amen now that same tree of life will give you eternal life even why it took uproot and it found good ground amen inside your heart amen and that's what he is doing he's drawing a bride now to his old self amen so why is he doing that that's the second full of his purpose well the first of all was that God could be completely revealed in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and he did it now he is pouring the complete revelation of Jesus Christ into his bride so that God can now be expressed in his bride if she'll just let him amen if she'll just let him amen and then what is it what is the purpose after that was that God can restore back the Garden of Eden on earth to get Christ and his bride living in a garden yes Amen you know I think about how many you know how many times I like to travel I love to be out in nature I like to get away from all the things they're man-made and get out to the things that God made amen so I can see the things that God that has God's DNA spoken word DNA on the inside it's not concrete or or all his glass and all these different things but as something like a forest or or an ocean or something that's living and a lie that God created speaking out of his own mouth amen he get me out there and I can have a good time well why can I have a good time because God has promised that me eternal life living in that type of atmosphere yeah I mean it won't be long amen so they're they they are feasting on the things of man I am feasting on the things of God amen and I had but they're they are ignorant of the promise amen there's just like we read now Tenaya there he is he was ignorant that the promise was to Solomon not to a Danite but when it was revealed a sudden fear came over so we'll be in this day when when all of a sudden it's been prophesied already all seems to come to pass but some of these days Jesus said I will not eat of the fruit of the vine again until he eat with you again that promise is waiting for me amen jesus said it has set a date for us it's like when you get when you when you really like to be with someone you really enjoy spending time with them and you set up a date let's go out and fellowship or some food or a coffee or something like that and fellowship to go into another amen so Christ has set the same date with us I want to fellowship with you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again until I eat it with you up and glory amen it's a promise and while we are waiting for this promise their fruit feasting on the things of the world we are feasting on the Word of God amen amen one of these days it won't be long you know the according to the prophecies of the Bible that when Israel will become a nation again and the mercy will switch from the Gentiles to the Jews Israel has now been a nation for 70 years it's past due it's past time but it's right in God's time amen it's right here it won't be long amen amen my brother showed me that thing about that Hebrew worship service you know the Jews they're worshiping there in Jerusalem they were worshiping how could they do that they know Jehovah think about it if you if you if you saw a pile that was dry you and you saw someone with a match going towards it you'd say that's gonna go up in flames if you see the Jews rejoicing waiting for the fire of the Holy Ghost to come upon them they are waiting for their rejoicing it won't be long soon this ooze that spark of the Holy Ghost hits them Israel will be changed it's a it's like a it's like a forest waiting to be caught on fire amen they need a savior they need a deliverer a man Israel's in the bad spot they're surrounded you know the day that Israel the day that Israel declared their independence in 1948 they were attacked by 19 nations the day that they declared that they were going to be the new state called Israel and they made the declaration there at the United Nations they were attacked by I think it's like 19 their separate nations and they want and they want it now how could that be how could that happen how could they win amen like the three day war they're a six-day war in 1967 when they were attacked by surprise and they won the batter being attacked on one of their holy days and they weren't expecting it they fought back and won more ground there's worse for their enemies there was for them how did they do that I think they lost 50 min or something like that or if if that while other people lost thousands how did that happen because there's someone behind them there is a power greater than human beings behind them well and what is he doing he's protecting them and preserving now for seven years he's protected and preserved them so that they could be ready to receive the Holy Ghost when they receive the Holy Ghost we go up amen and what happens when we go up they will be feasting on the things of the world we will be feasting on things of God and glory amen and then a sudden fear will come upon them when Jesus Christ returns he fights again against them with the sword of his mouth which is the word amen who is king over your life amen Vashti found out that the feast that she was feasting at in her upper chamber did not even prepare her to be one with the King whatever was going on in that in that upper chamber didn't prepare her to be one with her King Amy by a stir the feast that she went to for six months of this and so your feast prepared her to meet with her King amen hey man what are you preparing for the king is coming amen the true king is coming there's been many there's been many of they're called kings there's been many of they're called saviors but the true Savior will come amen and our who is king over your life a man as I was thinking about this scripture the the the this is what that the what hat this is what happens when you do not make a plain and clear who is to be king over your life if King David had made it clear who was to be king after him at a denying ever would have had a chance to rise up and declare himself king they meant but because it wasn't made click clear who was King Adonai had a chance and it's the same thing in our own lives if we do not make it clear who is king over our life in every single area every single attribute if we do not surrender every single part of our lives to Christ the King then there are other little things will rise up will rise up will rise up and I've seen it in my own life amen just forget that one area and all of a sudden do you think I don't have to glorify Him as God in this area of my life or I don't have to glorify him his garden I've seen it amen amen I've seen it I've suffered some things I've had to go back and grab some things back amen and say God will be king over my whole lot amen amen because when you declare that God that will be king over your entire life amen then he can sup with you and you with him Amen let's just stand hey man there's coming a wedding supper amen he said if I am going to prepare a place for you and if I prepare a place for you if I leave I will come and receive you again unto myself it's a promise it's a date the time has been set and then we may not know that exact time but one thing's for sure the Holy Spirit's gonna make us ready amen we just got to submit to him amen Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your word lord I pray Lord it is a blessing to your bride here Lord this evening I pray father though for your bride this standing here Lord that you would bless her and keep her Lord Lord and comfort her in these days
