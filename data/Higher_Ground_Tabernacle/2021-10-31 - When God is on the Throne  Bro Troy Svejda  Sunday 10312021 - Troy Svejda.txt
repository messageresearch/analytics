this morning it's good to be back here in the house [Music] [Music] each and [Music] give him [Music] every time jesus [Music] [Music] to get down to jesus [Music] and all of a sudden a worship service was going on in that room [Music] [Music] jesus christ jesus and that woman he said and the same thing is true this morning jesus christ has met the appointment jesus christ with him to meet with him this morning wherever [Music] and he's here what's up to us with the attitude that we have in our hearts whether we'll be on the inside of that worship service or whether we will just be watching it from a distance now i have a lot of scriptures to go through this morning and i i hope you love the bible hey man because we're going to go through a whirlwind of scriptures this morning [Music] but i just want to take a path going through showing what mount zion meant [Music] what that means to us today we'll go to uh psalm 68 i had about four different scriptures i wanted to start but we'll start here in psalm 68 psalm 68 we'll start with the first verse and it says let god all right amen let his enemies be scattered now let's go down to the seventh verse the situation here the situation is king david is watching as the ark of the covenant is going back up on top of that mountain the ark of the covenant that led them to the wilderness led them through every trial through every battle through every war truly always belonged on mount zion that that ark of the covenant always belonged on mount zion and hundreds of years had gone by and that the ark wasn't there but now is the time for that ark of the covet to ascend up that hill to go to a tabernacle where god had prepared for it and as that that ark of the covenant was ascending up the hill and so as that arc was ascending he began to cry out all that god arrives just like god arrives into his proper place and all of his enemies will be scattered amen now let's go down to uh lost my place here let's see verse 7 and he's talking about when he brought them out of egypt and how the they saw the power of god going before them as they left egypt through the wilderness let's read seven through nine here how did he march he went with a pillar of fire the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even mount sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel thou o god did send a plentiful reign whereby thou did confirm thy inheritance when it was weary [Music] everywhere the presence of god went victory now let's go forward to uh verse 15. psalm 68 15. now he's fast forwarding time talking about mount zion they're now in the promised land but in the midst of that promised land god gave them a special mountain right there in jerusalem and and now he's beginning to describe this mount zion a high hill why are you jealous this is the hill which god desires to dwell in yea the even hey not my desire but thine be done lord and your bride is gathered here this morning because of your promise where you said you be with us lord as you sat down and opened the word to your disciples father 2 000 years ago may you sit down this morning and open your scriptures to us this morning [Music] in the name of jesus christ now we just read there in the middle of psalm 68 all these verses david was crying out as he was watching the ark of the covenant ascend back up up where it belongs finally god's promised land has a capital city capital all this time the the presence of god has been dwelling in tents but now the the promised land of god has a capital city for hundreds of years the the promise of god had been they've been living in the promised land but they had their enemies have been troubling them he goes around the country in a supernatural anointing and after every enemy was conquered yeah and when david perceived when it was revealed unto david that god had made him king over all israel that god even gave him the heart of the land into his hands his [Music] but to give god a place to be worshipped to give god a place where god has the preeminence oh no longer just worrying about conquering the lusts of the flesh [Music] and that pillar of fire followed that ark of the covenant all the way [Music] and defeat and the enemies were defeated [Music] the stories of the forefathers before him and the power of god in their midst and now they have peace from all their enemies and let god's ark of the covenant say let's go he began as that ark began to ascend up that hill dave it began to get a little inspired you read back in the book of the samuel or the kings i think it is as you i was watching the presence of god being going to you know god had prophesied of that mountain for ages and ages and ages prophecy he would send out a prophecy and then the next year the enemy would come in and take over the mountains he would send out a prophecy but during prophecy and then the next year the gods people go into captivity because as soon as god sends out our prophecy he knows that [Music] god said let there be uh let there be treats rise up out of the earth well he just sat there and waited that's right those trees just got to come when god said let there be an earthquake i don't know if that's true or not but there's an old jewish tradition that that's where adam and eve were back in john chapter four there was an argument about that mountain jesus he said you know i need to go by samaria they begin to talk to this woman and she says you know our fathers say that we should work with worship in this mountain over here let me tell you something [Music] they're the true worshipers but you know just because the mountain was beginning to change doesn't mean that the promises were changing there were specific promises about that mountain god arrives just like our eyes and i know all of his enemies will be scattered where is that mountain today [Music] where that pillar of fire will come down again amen david was beginning to get inspired he says as god left egypt you know that's the same god that pulled you out of the world by my man [Music] or money or whatever it was some temptation upon our mind we would just go do it there was nothing to stop us you know i you just go do whatever the enemy told you to do you go to your prayer closet you pray lord i want to be a better person oh i wish i could be a real christian but then the enemy would you'd walk out of your prayer closet the enemy would come and push that button are you turning go off and do whatever the enemy told you to do and then after that you think now why did i do that i wasn't going to do that anymore lord i wanted to stop doing those things but every time the enemy comes he just pushes that button and you march off and do the will of satan message you read these stories in the bible of these mighty christians that fought for god in the power of the holy ghost you just need god to arise to his proper position there is a place where god young noah he was in the ark and he sent out that that that that that crow that vulture whatever it was and it never came back was happy to go out there and land on the dead carcass after dead carcasses out of the arc in colombo because doves can't eat those things it's the same thing with a real christian even if you're not in your proper place and you start doing those things that you ought not to do but let me tell you it's just going to make you as sick as sick [Music] because there's something about you just it torments you in your mind [Music] that dove went out from the ark again and it found a little but it couldn't rest on it because the branch was so small so it just grabbed its feet and brought it back to noah hello sent the dove out of the ark and the dove never returned a place to rest jesus one time he looked upon his disciples the disciples says well let's just go find a place to stay where are you staying at where are you living and jesus looked at him he says the foxes have holes foxes have dents the birds have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head there's no place the son of man was sent to the earth from the earth picked him up and put him back in the heavens upon a cross he said we don't want this man it is but they took them and they placed them back on the cross back up in the heavens return to sender jesus before [Music] will worship god in spirit and in truth let god arise and all of his enemies will be scattered on the day of pentecost in the upper room now you remember when jesus christ was ascending his disciples were gathered there with him he gave them his last words and all of a sudden he is he began to ascend through the air supernaturally and all the miracles the signs and the wonders the lame walked the the dead the blind could see the hungry three and a half years he gave them every single thing they ever needed and now he's leaving them behind me and they're sitting there staring up in the sky and they watch as the cloud obscures them out of their [Music] staring what are you looking at what are you waiting for go and do everything he told you to do or he's gonna come back the same way you saw him and i want to tell you that that promise is just as true as it was 2 000 years ago that our lord is coming back to this earth again i want you to go preach the gospel preaching all over the world but don't be preaching in your own strength now don't be preaching this gospel in your own strength don't be preaching in your own power oh don't go preaching in the in the power of the baptist but go wait there in jerusalem but there is one mystery that was revealed by martin luther as the just shall live by faith and by that faith they will be justified i believe that yeah you know i can't go with the the the the the uh methodists but the methodists did have mar or john wesley the founder of the wesleyan john wesley i can believe that [Music] because the power of god that came down in that upper room now it was the power of god was restoring his church in martin luther's day bringing them out of a dark age bringing him out of the dark ages where the church died under catholicism he began to resurrect it to a martin wesley the 1940s and 50s healing campaigns went all across the world articles began to be written in the newspapers of miraculous healings and signs and wonders because in the late 40s uh an article was written bible days have returned to the earth again what is it it's the power of god jesus christ was manifesting himself upon the earth again what's what's god doing the gentile day is coming to an end it's time for us to get out of here living in the last days of the gentile race and they're receiving the same signs and wonders that the jews received when jesus christ walked on the earth but that mount zion was not just some some mountain of how to receive the holy ghost oh you know when you received the holy eucharist [Music] your first elders they lay their hands upon you and they say we're confirming the holy ghost upon you or in the the pentecostal church when you get emotional enough to speak in tongues you have that same holy ghost that came on the day of pentecost where is that power of god that took over the world 2000 years ago [Music] if god be amongst us where are his miracles where are his sons where are his wonders where is the living god but yeah just let god arise and every single one of his enemies will be scattered well you say well how do we get god to arise worshipers they won't worship them in the baptist denomination they won't worship him as a methodist oh no but there's a cry that has gone out in these last days of their sins brother branham was a prophet sent to us in these last days as they went forth preaching in the 1940s 50s and 60s he went first first with a uh healing ministry with signs and wonders that that many tried to imitate but you know let me tell you never has a ministry been seen like the ministry of brother william brennan was revealing himself to the gentile world [Music] could have the same experience that the jewish church had 2 000 years ago as the lame began to walk as the blind began to see that men began to realize this ministry of brother branham was not just a natural ministry that god was visiting his people again but it was to catch the attention of the bride of christ because as jesus christ ascended up onto the earth into a cloud that jesus christ said is returning again jesus christ is coming back to this i see in revelations the deity of jesus christ is being revealed and as the deity of jesus christ is being revealed john the revelator was watching this all unfold he said i heard a voice behind me as he heard that he heard that voice he turned and the deity of jesus christ was revealed through that voice but you get to the end of the book of revelations but now the spirit and the bride are speaking at the same time and they're speaking the same thing spiritual foolishness that's going on in the churches oh god isn't speaking to the americans he's not speaking to the congolese he's not speaking to the germans he's speaking to the churches come out of here he says those churches they've they're like a a cage of unclean animals a cage of wicked spirits it says in revelation 17. you can find him in revelation 17 18. a cage of every unclean and wicked animal the casual uncle was buried and it's the truth but brother brian prophesied with the book of revelations to branham tabernacle he said uh should i take him to uh tucson where can i take them in that question and answer his sermons now the ministry of brother brandon was so supernatural [Music] and a focus on the prophet only it's a concentration and brother brandon realizing that realize well where should i take these people they've come out but where what will we go into that's the west coast it's not something [Music] they all say he says yes there is a place he said it was a reveal to me just now there is a place for the bride together in the lord jesus christ it's in the son of god just gather right in there just find yourself in the wings of the almighty where the power of [Music] corinthians 3. paul began to talk about the the veil was ripped in two voila [Music] see but when jesus christ was dying on the cross the earth earthquake took place the veil was ripped and the mercy seat was on plain view but to see what it is the mercy seat wasn't that little arc there in the behind the curtain [Music] it was the body of that man that was hanging on the cross it was hanging there in plain view of the people but they couldn't see the it that had the spear couldn't see that that was his creator the ones that marked him and spit on them they couldn't see it the ones that saw them see the the veil that was on the the veil that was on on the on on the temple was no longer upon the temple the veil was on their hearts according to second corinthians 3 no man can see the lord until that veil is taken away in 64 brother brown preached that sermon you know [Music] she's she's wearing a red dress hey you're you're just praying just now they say you're not praying for yourself but you're praying for your mother over in kentucky who has cancer and she's not saved they say go back to kentucky and you'll find your mother healed and serving the lord now i don't know about you that happened in 1963 he could not do that himself remember said you people call me a prophet he said i'm not a prophet he said the holy ghost is the prophet because he knew the power of the god was on the scene just like moses when god told smite the rock [Music] and moses and he went and smote the rock twice god said you shouldn't have done that so has jesus christ been crucified a second time why because of the hardness of the gentile heart have crucified jesus christ all over again that is not contaminated with the things of foolishness let god rise to where he belongs that's good where he ought to be god ought to be dwelling upon your heart be living and reigning upon your heart i think it was in the indictment i think it was 1956. forgive me if i'm wrong but brother brown those four words out of the gospels those four words i forget what verse it is but it's at the end of one of the four gospels and he read just four words out of that verse they said those four words are this one there they crucified him there they crucified him of all peoples among the nations crucified the most painful death known to man him god's one and only son that god so loved the world he gave his one and only son for the earth in god's but the thing the church of god in these last days has done it all over again by rejecting the god sign to this world when brother branham turned his back to the audience and nothing could be hid from him god began to reveal the secrets of the hearts you're there in the red jacket you have you have cancer god will heal you have a lung disease god will heal you you're praying for your mother in north carolina god will save her now man can't do those things what was it it was our lord and savior amen [Music] now that was a sign to catch the attention of the people to pull us out he said but when a man begins to turn and look upon the lord that veil will be taken away and you'll see him in plain view oh if you just can just get away from your own natural thinking and cry out to the god that's been revealed in these last days he's been revealed for one purpose an objective that he might have a preeminence in the bride of the lord jesus christ and by it all the rest of the world will be judged amen amen but just let god arise and all of his enemies will be conquered and that last enemy which is death will be put underneath our feet as we he had his picture taken with brother branham there pillar of fire came down in the room came over his head now brother branham isn't here anymore but let me tell you that pillar of fire is still here i i praying and believing on the lord and also in that light [Music] amen amen as the message that was given to us it was revealed for a cause for a reason [Music] and let your heart be turned away from the things of this world let's just stand but to the same place that moses he looked into the heavens when he was on that mountain we spent 40 days and nights with the lord up there on the mountain he had a chance to peer into the heavens [Music] and he saw a tabernacle where god dwelled with man and the lord told moses go back down there and recreate down there what you saw up here what do you see up there [Music] the blood of the lamb was there healing was there deliverance was there the hidden man was there [Music] a high priest [Music] you saw a man and god meeting together in a little room [Music] you know you don't have to wait for some date way off [Music] where you will be transformed for me amen and change to meet with god moses saw it [Music] oh he recreated it down there on the earth but his heart yearned and cried to see that you know god allowed him a chance to see it [Music] and the gospel says that moses and elijah appeared with jesus christ on mount transfiguration it says that they talked with him about the death that he would accomplish he's on mount calvary [Music] oh you know it's going to happen again as two witnesses in revelation 11. [Music] [Music] through the flesh brother bran the spirit of the spirit of elijah comes five times on this earth came in elijah [Music] always to bring a people back to the pure word [Music] of revival and the bride says let it be unto us according to thy word just let it be ended it's like your word said brother abraham was preaching he said you know god doesn't make halfway christians [Music] he said some christians can be halfway they say your god doesn't make halfway preachers [Music] [Music] [Music] to open our eyes to our nakedness [Music] that these denominational doctrines can't cover you run to him in the name of jesus christ jesus heavenly father when you are upon your throne all other voices are silent lord [Music] there is knowledge not confusion [Music] and finally on after 365 years of walking with god [Music] 365 days in the year [Music] [Music] just come on up here there's a walk it's a little bit higher than you're used to walking yeah and so is the bride of christ we're not walking with him on just on sundays and wednesdays [Music] you came out of the denominations watch this come up out of the world and in a rapture walk a little bit higher and we'll meet him in the air our lord and savior that drew us scriptures lord [Music] [Music] in the name of jesus christ we pray [Music] but [Music] and get that treasure that comes from god amen [Music] above all powers above all just above all new [Music] above all [Music] is [Music] there is no way to watch [Music] and thought of me [Music] behind the [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus and you thought of me [Music] powers [Music] above all nature and all created beings [Music] before [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and treasures [Music] crucified [Music] [Music] jesus trampled on the ground [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you live to die [Music] on the ground [Music] above for one more time you were crucified [Music] oh jesus you live to die [Music] like a [Music] took the rose and you thought of me [Music] and you thought of me [Music] i lord i love to sing your praises [Music] i'm so glad you're in my [Music] heart i'm so glad you came to save us one more time blow the [Music] love lips sing your praises jesus i'm so glad you're in my glad life i'm so glad you came to save me oh you came you came from [Music] my [Music] on high you came you came you came you came from heaven from the earth [Music] [Applause] know [Music] glad [Music] [Music] you came one more time lord [Music] oh jesus lord i love to sing your praises i'm so glad you're in my life i'm so glad you came to save you came [Applause] [Music] from the earth my heart from the cross [Music] [Applause] [Music] from heaven to earth [Music] from the cross [Music] you [Music] from the earth [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] when rejoicing that will be oh [Music] see jesus [Music] oh yes when we are [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh oh oh let us [Music] when we oh [Music] oh oh oh that will be [Music] jesus we will [Music] [Applause] [Music] just let you know we have a second service we have a service of communion and the singing will start at 3pm the pastor will be here to preach [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
