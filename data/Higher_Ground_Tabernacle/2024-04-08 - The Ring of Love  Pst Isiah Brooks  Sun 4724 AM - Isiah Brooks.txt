before I forget we've got a baptism today at the American Inn American in in Grimes I think that's Grimes Grimes at uh at uh 2 o'clock we're doing it at 2 o'clock because they have a scheduled party there some little kids at 12 at 12: noon so we want to make sure they're out of the way and pray for the owner the pastor of this particular um Hotel whenever we ask him to baptize he opens up his pool immediately and he doesn't charge us anything so pray that God would bless his bu and he's always watching so you never know what might touch him amen I have my granddaughter that'll be baptized brother Simon's little daughter where she's at amen she's a wonderful little girl she inspires me y'all remember that time she came up here sing with the others oh my God the atmosphere changed so we thank the Lord for her I'm having brain freeze I can't think of her name huh Danielle yeah she wrote it out for me pel I just couldn't think of it she sent me such a Lov letter praising the Lord and thanking God for me I didn't tell her Daddy about that I didn't want him to get jealous something God is dealing with that young girl dealing with my my granddaughter and anybody else who want to get baptized you welcome uh it is a necessary uh thing but we we want you to be ready and uh we baptizing uh brother uh sister p pel uh because she's been after me for about at least three or four weeks and I know she's been pulling on her daddy's coat if I was I'll be really I'll be such a proud man uh if she when she grows older and she want to Doo it it won't hurt nothing but I think I think the Bible says supper little children that come unto me such is the kingom amen my my my grandson want to be baptized but we're going to let him wait for just a bit and he knows why can remember amen when you're ready you know ready amen you love the Lord amen Nobody Can Do Me Like Jesus um and we want everybody to uh pull on the word this morning you know brother brandham said it like this he said when that squeeze come you'll be so glad to see Christians real Christians he said your your Doctrine won't matter then cuz no matter how much Doctrine you got if you don't have the love of God in your heart it will fail when the trial come you understand me there's only one judge and that's the Lord Jesus Christ as we stand Hebrews 12:23 to 26 you know when God get ready and he's done with you brother Adam said if there is no hope for you I'll say it like this when God is done when you cross the line of mercy and Grace there is no pull in your heart for the Lord can you hear me whatever you I can hear it okay God is good to us Hebrews 12 23- 26 thank you sir to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven [Music] whose voice then shook the Earth but now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven let us pray our gracious father we come before you as long as humble as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for teaching us giving us Grace and showing us oh God that love conquers all father we thank you for this assembly this morning I believe those who are here have come to get closer to you Lord help us now give us grace and mercy strengthen us Lord uh uh uh most of all change us Lord we come for changed and the only way we could ever be changed is through and by Your Word in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen you may be seated we we we thank God for also uh uh Michaela for making she was baptized when she was younger but as a as a teenager now she wants to be re baptized and so I told her that was fine uh because it's about it's about your change of heart what God is dealing with you in as God is dealing with you in your heart hallelujah hallelujah uh the uh subject uh tonight uh this morning is the ring of love you know I I I have seen many afflicted [Music] many people deformed crooked and things like that and my heart has always gone out for them so is it in the spirit those that I see that are afflicted those who I've seen that are or how them said that he talks about Ed deformed Christians not that they're not Christians but is that something that has laid upon them and has hindered their growth but but my subject this morning ring of love I trust that it'll bless you because when I see people people that are afflicted I'm not there to scone or criticize many of them can't help how they were born or what tragedy took place in their lives no matter how we might dismantle that it stands still it stands true like I said people who are born blind need not to be scorned because they've been born blind matter of fact many people will never be able to see F fully until God open their eyes like it did the man born blind for 30 years there's nothing you did nothing that I did that deserves this grace this Grace has been given by the almighty God uh you can't Merit it you can't bribe [Music] him you can't borrow it you can't buy it it is something that God determined before the foundation of the world and because I have been doing uh weddings and I see uh the attitude of people who are being married matter of fact the last wedding we did have when we were doing the bows I told that brother and that sister I want you to look each other in the [Music] eye see because when you look at each other in the eye if you're lying it will be seen right the eye as I I love that song it tells the story that's why the word of God talked about preachers seeing each other eye to eye when we talk about a ring a ring is a circle and it says even the ancient egyp ipans considered the circle to to be a symbol of eternity since a circle has neither uh beginning nor end it symbolize eternal love and The NeverEnding Bond of a marriage I want you to understand where I'm going with this because if we are the bride of Christ which we are God has done something and it's not something that was done in your day of birth what God Did He Did It Before Time began when we talk about wearing and I I wanted to know why do we put the ring on that on that left finger and I saw that wearing a ring on the left middle finger uh uh is a symbol it symbolize balance and and responsibility responsility hallelujah hallelujah so it brings the woman and the man into balance uh uh it brings uh them both into a responsibility to make sure that that love is never broken see when you put that ring on on on that finger it it it symbolizes that you have been uh chosen of God hallelujah you and your spouse uh uh uh before the foundation of the world the beautiful thing about our marriage to God is that the Lord didn't place it it it on our finger he placed the ring on our heart Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and when that scripture comes till death do us part which is never for the Bride of Jesus Hallelujah and those who have been chosen and elected by God cuz death cannot depart us so much so death is done away with death is done away with and eternal life is the ring of God hallelujah hallelujah now we look uh in the uh Hebrew where we read every time I read this passage of scripture I I literally see the Bride of Jesus Christ uh in in A procession standing before God moving toward God as a royal people and here Paul picks it the picks it up and he expresses the respect that he have for the bride and the body of Christ Hallelujah and he goes on to say to the general Assembly Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven not on the majestry book not down at the State House not not in the church book but written in heaven and to God the judge of all hallelujah hallelujah and this is what I like and to the spirit of just men made perfect Hallelujah the Bible says and Jesus the mediator of New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel and I always wondered what that meant because Abel wanted Revenge Hallelujah but when it came to Jesus Christ he said father forgive them for they know not what they do hallelujah hallelujah if we could really see that that that statement that Jesus made carries all the way through time because when Jesus saved the Earth saved everybody hallelujah hallelujah the only reason why people go to hell is because they refuse to accept Jesus Christ as their savior hallelujah hallelujah that's the truth the 5ifth 25th verse says seek seek that he refuse not him that speak if they escape not who refused him that speaketh on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven Hallelujah huj whose voice then shook the Earth but now have Pro prom now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and we know at the opening of the word at the opening of the seals there was a mighty shaking on Earth and there was a mighty shaking in heaven why because this message came from Heaven Hallelujah and to disobey this message Hallelujah will be refusing Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah Jesus Christ is is not a denomination Jesus Christ is not an organization Jesus Christ is the word hallelujah and that word lives Hallelujah let me ask you a question which of you can truly say that you're perfect within yourself none of us can because our Perfection only comes by Jesus Christ listen how many of you can truly say I found the Lord none of us can say that we found the Lord listen what brother Adam says coming from Israel in the church 1953 he said that wasn't why I got saved that wasn't why you got saved you got saved because God chose you before the foundation of the world to be saved that's the scripture teaching amen now you see we begin to find out it's not us it's him see he chose us hallelujah Hallelujah I'm going read another one Hallelujah coming from sir we will see Jesus brother goes on to say there comes the battle of Armageddon ready for the Millennium for he is Lord of Lord King of Kings hallelujah hallelujah don't be shook up and they that are with him are called The Chosen not you he has you got the Holy Ghost you ought to shout Victory God chose you before all the foundation of the world if you can't see the Gospel Light it's because you you just blind Hallelujah is that all right if you can see it you don't see it because you think you got eyes to see you see it because God chose you to see Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying let me sing another one coming from sir we will see Jesus paragraph 82 Hallelujah he said and then remember if you were if ever was if you ever was in God's thinking will always be there wait a minute that means nobody can take me out nobody put you in if you've been in the thoughts of God nothing can take you out Hallelujah if you got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute all his thoughts for this age not if not not you there's only one eternal life and it's always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it wasn't what we think what someone somebody else think is what God Eternal you always will see in his thinking hallelujah hallelujah and what did God do what God gave us he gave to no other Church age no other Church age the Bible says they cannot be completed without us is that right we are the crown hallu of his uh Redemption y'all understand me there's not another church age that's coming there's not another Prophet coming hallelujah hallelujah I I know some people think that but you can think whatever you want to think we're about to embrace the translation of these Wicked bodies here hallelujah that's exactly the truth the ring he gave me before the foundation of the world now think about it if he gave you a ring it wasn't the Ring of Engagement it was the Ring of marriage hallelujah hallelujah you and I was his wife before the foundation of the world Hallelujah Hallelujah this is why we can make ourselves ready only the wife of God will have the ability to make herself ready everything else falls under foolish virgins Hallelujah but thank God for the foolish because at least they're saved oh y'all don't have to shout this morning cuz I'm going to shout anyhow hallelujah hallelujah coming from invisible Union of the bride of Christ we are living in the last days I can't help but saying if you don't feel that pull in your heart if you don't feel that urgency that something's about to happen well I I can't give that to you only God can give that to you because the foolish versions were dilatory wasting time cares of this world Hallelujah when the wise virgins she put oil and extra oil Hallelujah can I say it like this she she literally was eating this message and eating it in haste God the time has come I must eat this why because I must become this Hallelujah the word in this day was not given to you to have an intellectual advantage over the church World it came to you so God could change you Hallelujah this message came from out of the sh of glory and the bread that came from out of there was living bread was bread that would transform you Hallelujah not only bread that would transform you but bread that will translate you Hallelujah listen invisible Union of the Bride he says hallelujah now to notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky I thought you said brother you was his wife I am those of you who are going to the wedding this is just dealing with the time period this is dealing with a how can I say it a season Hallelujah but in his mind we were already wedded in his mind we his wife hallelujah hallelujah and we've got to pass through time to be to be tested to be proven that we are his bride hallelujah hallelujah and you are [Applause] wearing the wedding ban of predestination and you are wearing the wedding man of pre destinated unmerited Grace do y'all know what that means you did nothing to receive nothing right right Hallelujah a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you Hallelujah there he put it on you there not here put your name on a book what a Thanksgiving Hallelujah praise the Lord Psalm song of Psalms song of Psalms 1 two are y'all understanding I said are y'all understanding song of song beauty is vain and favor is deceitful Hallelujah That's What It Is song of songs we're going to read the first chapter the second verse and I'm going slow like this because normally I go too fast Hallelujah let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than Wine I'm going read that one again let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine and we know what his love is his love is when he reveals himself Hallelujah why because that word becomes stimulated and it's better than Wine Hallelujah and when someone gives you a kiss Hallelujah that means that particular I'm talking about real now I'm not talking about this perverted stuff he kissed me when I receive this message because the message is Christ hallelujah hallelujah and a kiss it is when a touch with the lips a sign of love oh y'all don't get it hallelujah hallelujah it is a sign of love what do we do out when when all of the wedding things are being said the Rings have been placed on the finger the last thing we say to the couple you may now kiss the bride Hallelujah and that kiss seals them intimately Hallelujah in a natural way Hallelujah that's exactly right they become one flesh amen one spirit one body Hallelujah one person is that right oh y'all don't like this but I'm going to preach it anyhow Hallelujah reverence and respect is what people don't know how to give hallelujah hallelujah and that's what the problem is when you don't your attitude toward the word hallelujah will determine where you go how God resp respond to you Hallelujah now we look at this thing and we understand that when when when two people become one they they somehow begin to to develop the same mind the same way of thinking sometime my wife and I responds in the same way when a question is asked or statement is made sometime we respond in unison Hallelujah because we have become one our way of thinking has become one Hallelujah there will always be variations because she's a woman and I'm a man but for the most part my wife knows what I would like and she knows the things I dis like and for the and and likewise I know what my wife like and I know what my wife would not like hallelujah hallelujah what is it to having the same Spirit Hallelujah is that right second Corinthians 3:18 Hallelujah you love the Lord I always tell people you know when it comes to the word of the Lord you need to respect the word you don't necessarily have to respect the man but you need to respect the word and uh you know I I I look at people and my heart goes out because so many people are just you're religious and don't even know it you think you got it right but every time I fall on my knees I realize that I need the grace and mercy of God 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord a Chang in the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord do y'all understand what that means we supposed to be changing into the glory of God little by little step by step we supposed to be changing into the glory of God now I want you to think about how much you've changed in the last year or two hallelujah hallelujah there's supposed to be changes in your life but many times as you heard me say we know how to confess our sins but we don't know how to surrender to surrender our Hallelujah Matthew 19 Hallelujah you love the Lord I'mma keep going Hallelujah Matthew 19 56 and he said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh hallelujah what therefore God have joined together let not man put us under hallelujah hallelu what are you talking about in the marriage God has to join you together and you are joined together by God by your own vows hallelujah hallelujah is that right oh y'all looking at me I'm speaking spiritually I'm speaking spiritually you are join to God by your own confession Hallelujah and God will hold you responsible Hallelujah I don't care how much you say you are a Christian you are married to Christ the word and every time you break his word you will have to give an account for it Hallelujah because God will not marry an adulterous woman or man he won't do it he can't do it y'all hear what I'm saying now I I I didn't know all of this was coming out this morning Hallelujah but a wedding ceremony is a beautiful thing I'm talking about the ring of love and some sometime we we take this thing too lightly in such a common way and God God can't have that Hallelujah you got to be completely sold out to God hallelujah hallelujah if my mother don't go if my sister don't go if my brother don't go if my father don't go if my wife don't go Hallelujah I'm going all the way just to see him you've got to be determined in this day here it is Isaiah 9 6-7 and I want to say when I started this message I did not have one single person in mind this is not to bash you or to to to to bring down you bring you down this is what God prepared this is what I'm preaching Hallelujah Isaiah 9 6-7 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace hallelujah hallelujah look what the prophet says Isaiah 69 and6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder what does this mean the answer is this the phrase the governor upon his shoulder from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and place it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her right to him and he is a head but also that he Bears the responsibility see a lot of time we take oh I'm the head but you also the man Bears a responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that belove is the Key of David God being Sovereign he forew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepted the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church and as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he spake and she obeyed for what for that is her Delight now we ain't talking about them half stepping want to be husbands we ain't talking about them men who want wives to take care of them you know if you're going to be a true servant of God you're also going to have enemies amen that's just the way it goes and you know I accept the responsibility see the bride makes herself ready hallelujah hallelujah she makes herself ready is that the Bible Revelation 19:7 say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready ain't nobody going to do it for you you got to make yourself ready Hallelujah we ain't no we're not babies where we need somebody to dress us you must make yourself ready oh I'm coming with it I'm almost done hallelujah we we're going to take uh Esther now you know I love Esther now because Esther tells tell the whole thing how how a woman should be and how a man you know all that Ruth is another good book I love those books as well amen because I can see myself in in in that story as my sister saying God is in this story I love that you may not know the end result but I know the end brother Brooks lived happily ever after brother Brooks lived happily ever after hallelujah hallelujah Joy bells ringing in my soul Joy Bells eser 4 15- 17 I I love this because something took place uh and shushan and and we we uh I mean uh well Babylon and we know that we know the king we know all of the story of Esther but God chose Esther for this story I love that song 15 uh the verse 15 then Esther B them return Mah this answer in for you don't those of you who don't understand M sent a message to Esther in other words do you think you're going to escape the Judgment of the Jews that has been set on them by hand because in other words when they find out you a Jew they goingon to kill you too but then uh uh Mori said to Esther in other words I believe God has made you a queen for such a time as this hallelujah hallelujah y'all understand me look at Esther's heart she wasn't selfish but all she could think about was her people Lord how can I save my people and if it means that I must die to save my people hallelujah if I perish let me perish I love that how many of us feel the same way about this congregation the Bible say we are helpers of one another we supposed to look after one another we supposed to make sure everybody is doing well it's not just me in my house this is my house this is my family Hallelujah and we supposed to take care of each other we should never let a brother or sister die glory to God otherwise you're just selfish you see a fallen brother a fallen sister and you leave them there you it's your duty do all you can do to pick them up and perhaps repentance will come I'm one man I can't go to all y'all houses I won't have time to study I won't have time to read I won't have time to pray Hallelujah but sheep supposed to take care of sheep I'm come I'm here to preach the word y all got quiet now cuz you know what you say but brother Brooks ain't never came to my house so let me say like this you've never come to mine either that road Ain't No One Way say it again go gather together together all the Jews that are present in shushan Hallelujah this is Li fast ye for me neither eat nor drink three days night or day if I ask somebody to do that here I want to what would happen three days no food no water I also Lord have mercy I [Applause] also and my maidens will fast like wi Hallelujah hey my church likewise will fast as well and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish Mori went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him Hallelujah now the power of love will make you do strange things right sisters you find sisters when they so in love they lose their appetite y'all s y'all not y'all have been in love yet oh yeah let me tell y'all something I hope this is okay with my wife when my wife first when she got pregnant first we we're so connected they they say it's psychological it's not psychological I think it's I think it's physical and spiritual and all of that when my wife got pregnant I started losing weight I started having back pains I went to the doctor for over a month or two they couldn't find the problem I was sick before she was sick then when she got sick that's when we found out she was pregnant ask her almost every time I got that certain back ache I said Oh Sister Ruby sir Ruby that's that's the truth I'm just saying when you're connected you're just connected Hallelujah and that's the way the bride if that can happen in the natural what about the spiritual Hallelujah we should know when God is grieved we should know when God is Happy us listen The Power of Love Like the word of God says God have provided some better things according to Hebrews 11:40 better things for us that they without us should not be should not be made perfect Hallelujah I don't know but I'm I'm I'm really excited I was telling somebody the other day God has given me such a peace and I'm I'm actually excited I can't explain it but I know that his coming is soon and and and I know by his word I'll be made ready Hallelujah yes sir there are some changes that's going on in the inside of me and I am so happy oh becoming the very person becoming his very image is excitement to me I I don't know what that is but I can imagine what a worm would feel a caterpillar if he knew one day he would be a butterfly Hallelujah the transformation that metamorphic change that takes place in him without him going to school for it nobody taught him this is in his DNA y'all hear what I'm saying and what brother say everything we need for the Rapture in that seed hallelujah hallelujah you'll never get to heaven and say God I did this God I did that look at me God hallelujah we will all be singing with the prop of God Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound cuz you know and I know the only way we're going to make it is by the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah First Corinthians 13 4-8 hallelujah hallelujah First Corinthians 13 4-8 so I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to give you a test today and I want you to examine yourself whether these things be in you love is patient love is kind love does not envy it is not boastful it's not arrogant hallelujah it's not rude it's not self-seeking it's not irritable and does not keep a record of wrongs oh y'all remember you remember when you did that to me it does not keep records of wrong Hallelujah once a person confess once a person ask you for forgiveness just like Jesus you supposed to forgive those people hallelujah you never supposed to bring it back [Music] up what if God brought that back up your s back up Hallelujah if we're going to move into His Image if we're going to move into his likeness we must behave like him hallelujah hallelujah Love Finds no joy I've got a different word differently but love find no joy in in in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth it Bears all things believes all things and hopes all things you see love don't never give up on a person the only time you can say oh my hands are tied is when you see a brother and sister blashe the Holy Ghost even blasphemy Jesus said Is Forgiven but blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is not forg hallelujah oh glory to God I'm going to shout if nobody else will Bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things see I don't have the ability to give up on anyone no one I can't do it because I don't want nobody to for give up on me even when it looks like I might drown in the process is worth trying to save Love Never Ends the Bible said love never fail is that right Love Never Ends but everything else will prophecies will tongues will they will see knowledge will all these things will come to an end but love is that Divine circle that has no beginning nor ending the Bible said charity never fad I'm almost done I'm almost done Matthew 26:36 6- 44 I just got one major quote I want to read to you all before I let you go Matthew 26 36- 34 44 you know we we we we we uh that Solomon had a a a revelation he said there's a time and season for all things there's a time for laughter a Time For Crying y'all know how he goes there's always a time but if I got brother bam right he tells us that this is a time of urgency he he preached a message desperation and he said if you don't get desperate it'll be so simple it'll pass right through you and you won even know it I don't see I don't see how people can sit there and say I'm bride and yet have no evidence of it the V supposed to know and she's supposed to see it these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah hallelujah then come Jesus with them un a place called Geth and said unto the disciples sit ye here why I go and pray Yonder you say brother book don't you be preaching these things to the people that's bringing that Spirit down the only way I can help you is bring it down God will pick it up but if I don't bring it down you'll keep going up thinking you got something that you don't have I'm not interested in a number of the church it ain't about how many people come here there are men who are deceiving people taking the same message and making people think you okay this is all Grace it is but in Grace there is a work there's a work of Grace that brings us to Perfection Hallelujah it does not leave us in a state of a sinful man or woman Hallelujah but this message brings us from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother brand said it makes room for the Holy Ghost himself Hallelujah you can't remain in the way you are oh you you got a temper that's got to go you got L that must go Hallelujah if you're drinking that must go if you're smoking that must go if you're hating your brother and sister that must go you're not to Heaven hallelujah hallelujah now that was not me then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called GE and said unto the disciples sit you here while I go and pray Y and he took with Peter and the two sons of zebede and began to be a sorrowful and very heavy then said he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death carry you here and watch with me now this is the Lord Jesus Christ approaching his judgment and crucifixion he was not laughing he was he was not joking like I do sometimes wrong he was sinere about the moment he was about to Embark upon Hallelujah I'm talking about the Son of God I'm talking about God manifested in theh took that moment seriously and he said my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death T here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not I as I will but as thou wil y'all understand me as a man as a man he wanted God to move that out of the way Hallelujah but he had a duty Hallelujah he had a purpose and that Duty and purpose was to suffer for you and I you and me Hallelujah he didn't throw it away he saw what he had to do but one thing I know about him Hallelujah he needed help now think about it the son of God asking his fellow Christians help me pray help me pray even when we ask each other help me pray I wonder how many of y'all help us pray do you just fall asleep ignore the request of prayer Hallelujah y understand me they did it and the reason why they did it they had not yet gone to Pentecost Hallelujah but when Pentecost is coming G when Peter and them were thrown in the jail they prayed the saints of God prayed and they prayed and they prayed and they pray hallelujah hallelujah until the Peter name was delivered that's the Church of the Living God we don't give up on our people when Satan comes like a the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard we supposed to be prayer warriors come on somebody it doesn't matter if it's your house or somebody else's house Hallelujah no demon should come in this place hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I'm tired of this church being de and it's not God's fault it's our fault God is already healed and delivered over 2,000 years ago hallelujah hallelujah and it's because we don't believe that okay what happened he watched he come along he kept him pray for me he went three times after the third time he sleep on now is that right now if Jesus did that to his disciples do you think you're going to escape if he's constantly telling you pray and you don't pray he going to say sleep on and what happened when the enemy came they all scatter fail to pray you love the Lord let me move on I'm almost done look what brother Adam says here in the exposition of the seven churches he said uh and he left them oh I'm sorry but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone hear me it is Jesus alone so I want to say this you can be as dumb as a rock and God will give you the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah you may not ever never never never know everything that the Seven Seals is says but once you are sealed with the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's not extra I got to do this plus I got to have this plus it's Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from the start to the finish it is all God let his life be in me let his blood uh that C uh CLE you see let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirits me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that healed me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I have done no sir Christ is my life amen hallelujah hallelujah is that right all right be zous to repent to repent Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you see Jesus had to overcome St John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome World hallelujah hallelujah it's him Jesus alone who overcomes the world Hallelujah first John 2 up 14 I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one Hallelujah hallu let's move on 1 John 4:4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you overcome because of him in you he that is in you is the Overcomer Hallelujah huj now we say well Lord how I'm going to overcome this is what been this is what I felt what was hiding in the message Hallelujah the way of a true Prophet the way of a true prophet and that's in 62 and I'm I'm closing on this because the five foolish the five wise version moved in desperation Hallelujah and they all trimmed their lamps Hallelujah but that wise kept her eyes on the door and that door is Jesus Christ now listen what brother bam says and I'm closing with this in this way of of a true prophet in paragraphs 138 he said I do believe some of y'all going I trust everybody hear it he said I do believe in per but I believe it but I believe it's right now he said you purge your own soul Purgatory means to purge when you see done something wrong get out there and clean it out of You by confession crying fasting and praying I'm not done yet because some of us perhaps has never fasted don't know how to cry Hallelujah but that's what he said get out there and clean it out you clean it out by confession C fasting and praying hallelujah hallelujah someone even laughed at me when the Lord came here not long ago and give me a vision I always wanted to see about binding that serpent listen to what he's saying I always wanted to see about binding that serpent I always wondered how to I would step out like that when that's what I wanted all my life then I began to fast and pray and said what what would you do that for I said in there he said I was not sincere enough after he wanted to purge myself not wait till you die and let some priest try to purge you he said Purge your souls now the this is a message that's to you it's a message to me you're not sincere enough and those demons ain't going nowhere if the prophet of God had to do it you got to do it hallelujah hallelujah yes sir this is a serious time partially is not godly if you're going to do this Christianity partially that's not that's not God you can't do it you can't have a half sheep and a half goat going to for look what Adam said here and I'm closing this my last one the way of a true Prophet look what he said especially when we take up for each other and you know others are wrong and you cover their sin you protect them you know they're wrong listen what he says I I took up for a man one [Music] time when I should not have took up I could have just shooked the liver out of [Music] him see instead of doing it I had to pay for it God made him pay for because when you protect someone that's willfully sitting and doing you have become one with them and you're going to pay for it but that's my friend go to hell with your friend did did you say it like I said it okay cuz you know that's what people don't understand you don't go to hell and get out of it there is no mercy there is no Grace let me say it like this there is no friend no one on this Earth I'm going to wait I'm going to risk my soul Hallelujah because if I go to hell they going to go to hell and they can't help me and I can't help them y'all y'all y'all y'all car on like I use profanity and y'all do it all the time y'all getting quiet I know some of y'all I done heard some of y'all slep man sometime y'all say it in French like I don't know you never know what I know but God is good to us I'm trying to tell us folks we got to get real we got to do it the way Bible says are you going to make enemies people ain't going to like you they're going to think you think you think God don't matter what they think you need to know that he slipped that ring on me the foundation of the world and the way people think about you has nothing to do about who you really are you understand me you got to you got to press through this Darkness you got to press through all everybody's opinion about you the only person that you're concerned about is the man in the balcony that's the man that you got to keep your eyes Focus Hallelujah you love the Lord let's stand I hope I woe you out because I did you gon to talk about me that's all right I want you to get the word I want you to understand the [Music] word and I want you to know that God God loves you he wouldn't bring a message like this every preacher love those kind of messages that going to get everybody excited and it's very difficult to preach the truth hallelujah but one day you'll love me if you follow through hallelujah hallelujah because all I'm here to do is help you make Heaven on the wings of us snow why the God sent his pure
