[55:15] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[55:17] whom I stand there shall not be due nor
[55:21] rain these years but according to my
[55:24] word
[55:37] the word of the Lord came unto him
[55:39] saying get thee hence and turn thee
[55:43] Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook
[55:45] cherith that is before
[55:54] Jordan
[55:59] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[56:01] the Brook and I have commanded the
[56:03] Ravens to feed thee
[56:11] there I want you to all say
[56:17] there so he went and did according unto
[56:20] the word of the Lord for he went and
[56:21] dwelt by the Brook cherith and which
[56:23] that is before Jordan
[56:31] and the Ravens brought him bread and
[56:33] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[56:35] in the evening and he drank of the
[56:42] brook and it came to pass after a while
[56:45] that the brook dried up because there
[56:47] had been no rain in the
[56:53] land and the word of the Lord came unto
[56:56] him saying arise get thee to zerath
[56:59] which belongeth to ziden and dwell there
[57:02] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[57:05] there to sustain
[57:18] Thee I want to minister tonight on a on

[57:37] love we thank you for your
[57:40] grace we thank you for a church right
[57:43] here in De Mo
[57:47] Iowa that is proclaiming the message of
[57:50] the
[57:52] hour how we love our brother Isaiah and
[57:56] his
[57:59] wife and I pray Lord that you would

[58:36] good to be a Christian
[58:40] tonight amen
[58:43] amen I want to preach on a place called
[58:49] there amen the great architect has a
[58:53] master plan for each of our
[58:58] lives each one of you have a
[59:01] pre-ordained
[59:06] destiny now this Destiny is not just
[59:09] spiritually but it is
[59:14] physically for the Apostle Paul says
[59:16] that he prayed that we would be
[59:18] preserved blameless Body Soul and
[59:23] Spirit
[59:29] we serve a God that that is concerned
[59:32] about every part of our
[59:37] Lives brother Brandon would say the
[59:40] church positionally before the
[59:41] foundation of the
[59:47] world when God in his labor PRS was
[59:50] bringing forth
[59:53] you
[59:56] knowing what you would do he
[59:58] positionally placed you in his own
[1:00:05] body you say now preacher now I
[1:00:08] understand that
[1:00:11] spiritually but I'm in charge of my own
[1:00:13] natural
[1:00:16] Destiny but I want to say God is
[1:00:18] concerned Body Soul and
[1:00:23] Spirit
[1:00:27] amen amen he would go on to say he
[1:00:30] positionally placed you into his own
[1:00:36] body to be a
[1:00:39] housewife a
[1:00:41] farmer a
[1:00:43] preacher a prophet Prophet this or that
[1:00:49] he placed you
[1:00:53] positionally well someone and shout
[1:00:56] hallelujah God's concerned about every
[1:00:58] part of your
[1:01:02] life he would also say we often get a
[1:01:05] view of him that would make him very
[1:01:12] impersonal as as though God created all
[1:01:15] of the
[1:01:17] earth and set up its laws that pertain
[1:01:20] to
[1:01:22] it and then stands back an impersonal
[1:01:28] God it is as though he made and created
[1:01:35] mankind but then he lost interest in
[1:01:40] mankind brother Brandon would say but
[1:01:43] that is the wrong
[1:01:48] thinking for God is governing in the
[1:01:51] Affairs of men right now he is both
[1:01:54] Creator and
[1:02:03] sustainer God is interested in every one
[1:02:05] of you young
[1:02:07] men God's interested in you young
[1:02:11] ladies God is interested in you
[1:02:14] m God is interested in Pastor in his

[1:14:48] cheriff waiting on those buzzards to
[1:14:50] bring food
[1:14:52] to

[1:20:16] blew the Angry Eyes Of God
[1:20:21] looked see got scared and parted
[1:20:27] back right there was the place that
[1:20:29] Israel seen God loved them more than the

[1:22:48] General he didn't know that he was the
[1:22:50] next

[1:22:57] preparation all the while sitting at the
[1:22:59] prophet's
[1:23:02] feet watching the rebellion of the
[1:23:06] church he had seen the chors and the
[1:23:08] daans and their

[1:23:17] him for his
[1:23:20] ministry the Wilderness experience is
[1:23:22] was crucial for this great man of

[1:36:44] Adam that's how he
[1:36:47] made a little bit of this and a little
[1:36:49] bit of that that's what your Prophet

[1:46:41] eye it tears me
[1:46:44] up why am I that
[1:46:49] way he would ask that
[1:46:53] question and
[1:46:55] I look at
[1:46:58] it this
[1:47:00] side I'm I'm 60 something years past
[1:47:05] when the prophet has has
[1:47:10] died God built that man to be an
[1:47:16] Elijah and he made him as straight as
[1:47:19] straight can be
[1:47:23] because you and I were going to need
[1:47:28] him can you say

[1:48:08] for what makes
[1:48:12] me I love people and yet just rip them
[1:48:17] apart I fast and pray to get rid of
[1:48:22] it the more I fast and pray the worse it
[1:48:27] comes
[1:48:30] incredible but it's true it's
[1:48:37] true we understand is because God had to
[1:48:42] bring that
[1:48:45] Elijah to bring this third pool Ministry
[1:48:48] to
[1:48:49] us
[1:48:50] aren't you glad for

[1:49:09] notes and and uh but I I I got too happy
[1:49:13] jumping around and so I can't finish my
[1:49:19] message but brother brandham this is the
[1:49:23] truth he
[1:49:25] says I you're going to do that first
[1:49:28] pool and he tells him about the
[1:49:31] hand then he says and if you there'll
[1:49:34] come a time if you'll be
[1:49:37] sincere you'll be able to read the
[1:49:40] heart then there was a it was a it was a
[1:49:44] constant marching
[1:49:47] forward I don't none of us grow
[1:49:54] discouraged because God is moving in a
[1:49:58] mighty mighty
