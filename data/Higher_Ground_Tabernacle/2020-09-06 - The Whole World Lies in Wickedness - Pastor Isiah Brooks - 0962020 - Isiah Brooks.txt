just going to get right into the word of god as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to matthew 24. and then we're going to ask that you turn on so the song of solomon the second chapter there matthew 24. we began to read at the 36th verse we read down to the 39th but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be one more scripture reading from the songs of solomon beginning at the 14th first oh my dove that art in the clefs of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see that countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and the continent is calmly take up the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth among the lilies until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be like thou like a row or a young heart upon the mountains of ether let us pray dear heavenly father god we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for being so good to us and we pray that you would have preeminence this morning lord we pray that you would break every yoke of the enemy lord we pray that your holy spirit will get glory here this morning and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i don't know it's a little chilly in here for me and i'd like some water please we're living in the last moments i'm sorry yes there's some thank you we're living in the last moments of history many of us have been selected by god yes amen we thank god for his amazing grace even though we have been selected the bible tells us that many a call and few have been chosen what can we do what can we say only god give ears to hear and eyes to see we can be in a position where we are looking at something straight face and yet be blind to it how many times we've searched for things in our lives maybe uh car keys or wallet or whatever and then we find that the very thing that we're searching for is right in your hand and i trust this morning that the message that we bring will do something in the hearts of all of us i would title this message the whole world lies in wickedness but god has called us to be a witness of light and truth and the only way that we can be a witness we must be separate we must be different we must be living living epistles written and read of all men the bible tells us that we would be when the when when he when he should come again excuse me it would be in a time like it was in the days of noah where they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving him marriage brother branham talked about that given in marriage he says marrying over and over again and it was such a time where the bible said that they could not recognize what hour they were living in mind you it was not a time when noah wasn't preaching noah preached 120 years and he was able to tell them that god's judgment was at hand amen but in that day even though they heard the word of a prophet they could not comprehend it they could not see it they could not hear it and the bible tells us it was going to be that kind of a day many times we think that being a church member qualifies us for the escape but the only way that we can escape in this day is that we must hear the voice of god not only just we we must hear it but we also must be obedient for the bible tells us that no unclean thing will enter into that city missed your voice we appreciate you glad to see you sister we um know that in the last days it's going to be a few and for some reason i think that among this message we think because we can quote william branham we know we're the thing to quotes we've come out of organizations and denominations but we have also been warned that it is not just a coming out it's a going in songs of solomon talks about the little foxes that spoil the vine and it means exactly what it says those little things that you think doesn't matter with god matters we're at a time amen that we need to understand that the number gets fewer and fewer as the time goes on smaller and smaller we're at a time when the message have changed from a place of brotherly kindness to divine love you see the seven church age was the the the example of brotherly kindness but we find that even in that age the love of many wacks cold you might as well sit back and relax because i'm going to take my time this morning we're at a time when we we see many falling away oh they come to church but the love of god is gone and the love for god is gone and they sit there as empty shells pretending to be alive when spiritually they're dead even the scripture says you got to be careful that you bear not a name that you live but yet you are dead we are the time where the seals have been opened and god has made a turn the whole creation as the bible says waits for the manifestation of the sons of god not one word of god shall fail not one word of god shall fail everything that have been spoken will come to pass we have been told by the scripture that the day that we're living in was to repeat itself we also talked was told that god would send another prophet a prophet somewhat like noah who would prepare a way of escape we've been told that god would send us malachi 4. and malachi 4 uh mission was to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers in the heart of the fathers back to the children and that turning was to bring us back to the true revelation of the word of god in the church ages we learn that men probed at what was truth and in so doing they left a lot of loose ends but in the ministry of malachi 4 he was going to tie up all the loose ends and that god out of a church would bring out his bride if we look at matthew 24 24 we find out that even in this last day there will be impersonators those who would be anointed but of the wrong seed because of their wrong message brother branham said that one of the ways of describing or or characterizing a true messenger is that when he comes he would bring a new message he would bring something different from the old school and he said if that person would bring claim to be something and bring the same kind of a message he said don't believe them you and i must understand that this is a serious time something the lord spoke to my heart yesterday he told me how many people are still watching the television and he said the television is a portal to hell you don't have to believe it that's why brother branham said he wouldn't have one in his house yet many of us have these things and we expect to make a rapture may god have mercy coming from the message and i'm going to take my time the anointed one at the end time the prophet god says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull is healing the second pull is prophecy the the third pull the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets so what are you saying brother i'm saying we have come to the the height of all of the church ages so much so amen the word of god said they cannot be completed without us there's a special work that the bride must do you and i must understand that god did not call us into religion he called us into life hallelujah no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truths that have been sealed in the word i often wonder when brother branham saw the preview of the church where that actually fell and what place did that fall into somehow it it looked like it was at a time when the rapture was about to take place because he saw each age marching twisting whatever they were doing but every one of those churches proclaimed to be the bride i can remember amen at the end of it he said here was miss america twisting and turning uh to the rock and roll miss america now he didn't call a bride he said miss america and as she went on we are told that by way of his vision she dropped off she didn't go up she went down she was so naked in the eyes of god all she had was a a piece of gray paper in the front of her i know this violin is vulgar but it must be sad because we know who strips the woman is always the preacher the preacher that's not called by god the preacher that adds or take away from the word the preacher who is anointed by lucifer hello somebody and you and i must realize by god's grace we're living as the prophet god said in the most deceptive age ever lived that's why god tells us to watch and pray amen when it when it looks like all hope was gone then here comes a little bride marching to the word amen then there were places that he he said she marched to the tune of onward christian soldier he said she was beautifully dressed she had on sleeves her dress wasn't tight it was loose fitting the dress went down to the ankle now you say well brother that doesn't make any difference on how i dress it does the bride of jesus christ will dress like the bride of jesus christ she will not dress like a street woman she will not be influenced by this lay of the sea and spirit she will always be faithful and true to her husband because when you get married marriage is a bond it is sacred [Music] and the man amen he and he he vows to keep his body clean and pure and the woman likewise you say what brother does that mean anything it does because if we under the third pool and the word of god has been restored you and i must realize amen god is not accepting anything less than perfection somebody help me here this morning he is only accepting perfection and that perfection amen doesn't mean that i can spurn grace the grace of god has been given to us that we would learn how to live holy and righteous before god let me continue on with the quote it is then he says he said the third pool excuse me was the opening of the seven seals to reveal the hidden truths that been sealed in the word it is then in that day when these this thing is to take place one thing that janice and jambridge the impersonators will appear again just like they did when moses appeared with the original word to say it they appeared to impersonate it just exactly right now you see matthew 24 24 see anointed ones now there's three things we're going to say before we close this is it i want you to listen real close now as we close three things remember three things have been fulfilled three things lay before you right now first the world is in a sodom condition jesus said it would happen look at the perversion our women trying to act like men are men trying to act like women sissified rotten filthy low down devil possessed and don't know it the bible says that would happen and that's where it's at hallelujah secondly it's the hour according to the scripture here that janice and jamborees appear secondly thirdly it's the same hour that the son of man is to be revealed amen hallelujah now you and i must understand when we talk about the son of man we're not stopping at the william branham but is higher than he don't get me wrong he was a son of man revealing the son of man and we're coming to that because i think that we fail to see that when god opened up the seals there was a mysterious thing that took place a great thing and many of us are missing it hallelujah there is your believer your make-believer your unbeliever there's a genuide word standing out indicated there is the make-believer impersonating it and there is the unbeliever rejecting the whole thing it is a mating you can preach and preach and preach and preach and people are still come back looking the same way acting the same way doing the same way and don't even realize that there are literally uh displaying not the unbeliever not the uh make-believer but the unbeliever god also tells us that in that day there come a son of man y'all know that and that son of man will be god himself impersonated in a man amen hallelujah we have experience you say but the world doesn't know this is not for the world this is for the bride of jesus christ those who have been selected by god those who have been uh how can i say it predestinated by god everybody don't get it they can't they can't remember in jesus day a woman at the well who was a prostitute knew that he was the messiah and those who were under the the great uh illusion a delusion of the devil the great preachers of that day they called jesus beelzebub hallelujah what we need to do we need to ask god to teach us how to believe and to receive hallelujah see we know that there's only one who never needed teaching and that was jesus christ himself in spiritual food in due season brother branham amen says you don't need our teachings but we need yours lord so we pray that you'll teach us how to pray how to live and how to believe hallelujah that's what we need folks you and i must have rapturing faith and what we're working with right now amen can't even heal a toothache we're at a time amen that you and i must understand it's going to take more than church service religious acts hallelujah it's going to take a person whose faith is built day by day by way of prayer by way of reading by way of studying one of the worst things that we could all experience is that to be left behind having this revelation of the word understanding amen supposedly the revelation and then mr ship mr boat the bible tells us bill we ought to build up our whole holy faith look at what brother says amen in spiritual uh uh uh in due season food and due season he said i want you to get built up now this holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour not yesterday's faith this faith the faith that's going to bring you into a divine love oh brotherly kindness we know how to be kind to each other but it doesn't stop there what worked for laodicea will not work for you because you and i are not in laodicea at least we're not supposed to be and i want you to get built up in this holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age did y'all hear him amen but this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and the wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether if god be whether if that be god or not you got to see it it's not just you know looking at the prophet god says well god was in him but god did not stop there he does not stop there hallelujah god looking for witnesses those who could be a witnessers those who could be a witness for him remember elijah amen was a man the bible said he was a man of like passion that means he had problems in his flesh too but at the time he was on earth this elijah walked so well with god hallelujah he spoke like god hallelujah is that right he said there'll be no do no rain until i called for it and it happened just like that hallelujah is that all right joshua was called by god is that right and he spoke like god one day when the enemy was getting the best of israel he said son stand still what was it he had a relationship with god so much amen he just got behind himself and the word of god spoke through him this is the kind of reflection god wants to see in us these men were just part of the book god didn't tell us to eat part of the book he told us to eat the whole book that means the power of the whole book supposed to be in us hallelujah yep sir that's the truth glory to god you and i are supposed to reflect christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah we can't say it's just for this day we must reflect jesus christ the same yesterday today today today and forever hallelujah is that right this is what this message come to do it come to produce sons and daughters of god hallelujah and we're supposed to be reflection of our age which is an invisible age which is an age that only you and i can see somebody help me here you and i can only we're the ones who see this age we're the one that's in this age and therefore we're supposed to reflect this age like i said when jesus was on the scene they didn't care about in other words the first pool and the second pool of his ministry didn't mean much oh oh they like all the good things they didn't mind him feeding poor they didn't mind him turning water into wine and doing all the miracles but when he began to reflect the god that sent him when he began to reflect the god that was in him that's when they had trouble amen saint john 10 30 when jesus said i and the father are one hallelujah that was the thing amen the world could not see they couldn't understand it and you and i must come to a place where we say i and jesus christ is one that's my husband that's my savior that's my redeemer my point is amen don't die the way you are the most frightening thing amen is for a lot of people to to how can i say most people won't grasp it they can't comprehend it because they say because i call on jesus i'm saved oh what a deception oh because i belong to the message brother madam said listen that's not the way you say it no it's not like i'm in the message it means no the message is in me i am the message and that's what you and i must come we must come to a place where we can truly say i am the message is that right it proves that you have eaten the book think about the number of christians so called that is now in hell hello oh you don't preach hell in the message you know because everybody think they're going to heaven what a deception what a deception think about it people paul said i have to be careful lest i myself become a castaway an angel of god the first church angel messenger said i must be careful lest i become a castaway hallelujah come on somebody what is the that's that's that to me oh that's uh hell in itself think about it the number of christians who are in hell because they didn't want to go all the way with the word okay we're living in an evil day when the whole world is wicked people think wickedness means just going out and doing a lot of wicked things but being wicked in the eyes of god is not using the talents that in which he has given you hello being wicked in the eyes of god that if he gave you one talent you figure you're going to bury it being wicked in the eyes of god is when you cannot forgive somebody help me here it's the truth remember the man amen who god had already been forgiven he was a christian but he came to a place he could not forgive his enemy and when he could not forgive his enemy amen he taught him he made his enemy feel bad he treated him wrongfully and the word got back to god hallelujah you know what god did everything that he had forgave and given that man fought he put it back on his debt and he was lost oh come on somebody you do not want to leave this world as a sinner but you beloved build up your most your yourself on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost you want a working from god you want god to do something for you you got to learn how to pray and i don't mean say a prayer i mean pray a prayer hallelujah somebody's got to get desperate many people don't want to get desperate i tell you what when we begin to see this combine moving in the way that it's moving it's going to pick up in speed and when we begin to feel the real pressure you all think you're in the pressure now but this is nothing compared to what's coming hallelujah brother brandon said i want to get built up i want to get built up in this holy faith you know what i'm saying i want god to do something now here we go you're talking about a witness and and understand the word of god said god has never left himself without a witness hallelujah a witness is somebody who's been there a witness is somebody who has had the experience of being there a witness is not going it's not to go off of what someone else has said but you have had the experience yourself and understand what god is doing we are living in what we call the era of the feast of the tabernacles where god will come down and embody himself in you in the spiritual food in due season we're living under a message where god is saying i want to occupy your body hallelujah that's where we are i want to be one with you hallelujah not some church system i called you out of the church system so that i could have fellowship and an intimate relationship with you god did not call us here amen to waste our time that's what we call lukewarmness when you don't take the hour serious enough coming from the spiritual food in due season he said but he embodied talking about god himself take in your body and my body and gives you gifts give me gifts and through these gifts he makes himself known he said that's the secret food remember brother adam was told to store up the food and by storing up the food while the whole world is famished they're in a famine you go you go hear a preacher amen on tv or whatever the case may be he's still preaching the same thing he's been preaching for 30 years the organization i came out of that's all he knows acts 2 38. they don't know nothing else are we to be that way with every change with every age there's always a different message not taken away from that which has already come but adding to it hallelujah god didn't take away from laodicea he added to it and i'm gonna get to that in just a minute because i plan not to be too much longer but because i i want us to understand that something took place in our day and and if we don't follow jesus we're gonna miss it hallelujah let me get back to the quote that's the secret foods no matter how much he would make himself known by me you've got to believe it and you've got to have a gift of faith to to believe it you believe that and now he said he will manifest himself in that manner will you believe amen well all with all your heart you believe him oh how wonderful and just waiting on him just waiting to see what he says is that right you say well what do you mean if this is another message when i say another message a plus to it i add to it to bring it into a whole because jesus christ is the fullness of the world hallelujah we thought amen that that that what we receive and let me say it like this do you realize when brother branham was here and the seals were open hardly anyone understood what he was saying you know what he said you're not getting it know why it wasn't given for you to get it it was for the people to come hallelujah the people that was with moses they didn't get it hallelujah it was for those who was to come and the people that crossed over the jordan never knew moses it was a new generation it was a new people hallelujah come on somebody you and i must realize by the grace of god oh my god how can i say it peter didn't know john the baptist but it was peter who got the revelation of jesus christ y'all better understand what i'm saying listen let's go on man so you can understand this message is to identify who jesus christ john said is that right john said i must decrease he must increase now i'm going to say a lot of things i got quotes for him but i'm going to say a lot of things so you can fully understand what i'm saying in 1933 brother branham was baptizing on the river ohio river remember the number 33 because during that time amen here comes a light and this light comes down and says as john the baptist forerunned the first coming of christ so will your message right thousands of people heard it the newspaper took a clipping is that right with all of that happening only a few people really saw and understood what was happening now mind you not even brother branham knew where he was headed so many things he did not know and understand even as a boy but god moved within him and began to lead him and began to prime him if i could say before the seven seals were open is that right and then brother madam goes on and says 33 years later he shows up again because remember amen brother oh let me read this because i'm jumping if we oh help me lord if you go in you don't have to turn but you'll find out that god did something and here is john let me let me let me go to the scripture here quickly john 1 beginning at the 29th first he said the next day john see jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god would taketh away the sins of the world this is he whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was what before me i and i and i knew him not but that he should be made manifesting israel therefore am i come baptizing with water now it's amazing that john and jesus were relatives elizabeth and mary knew each other and somehow john never knew him you see what it is no doubt they you know the scripture doesn't say this but somehow relations could have been but john never seen him as the messiah because you got to realize amen that john says listen the only time i recognized him is when the pillar fire appeared above his head because that was the instructions from god the one that you see the pillar fire come above his head that is the one that is the messiah and john said i knew him not right now watch this 1933 the pillow fire does what comes above the prophet people see it they heard a voice and they could not recognize and did not see that all of that was scriptural what was it god veiled behind human flesh john built records saying i saw the spirit listen let me go back to the 31st verse and i knew him not but excuse me but he should be made manifest to israel therefore i am come baptizing with water and john that record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it evolved upon him in other words that pill of fire was his identification amen it identified now i know who the messiah is but remember john even got a little scare uh uh a little dim in his eyesight because pressure made him do that here he was getting ready to die harold was going to take his head off and he sends a message to jesus are you the one it's kind of sound familiar kind of the same thing mary did you know she denounced her her visitation from god and here john now is denouncing his visitation from god are you the one or should i look for another and jesus could have easily said i am he but he said go tell john you go tell john amen i've cast out devils the lame is walking the blind the blind is seeing the dumb is talking in other words i'm going to give you a messiah sign i'm going to give you something that john can say it's in action hallelujah that's why i don't understand why people can say william branham is not the messenger of this day i can't understand it amen why amen that they they say he's not the seventh angel messenger i don't understand it amen because all of the signs all of the wonders all of the things that god said he would do he did it hallelujah there has never been another one and there'll never be another one hallelujah but god is raising upper people amen that will cap off the ministry of william branham one thing i know about jesus christ he's not boring if you can be bored in church you need an experience that's right even brother branham gives a uh uh uh uh uh uh uh a little thought on on this he says for the first time he says for the first time i've ever seen him and i want you to understand this that brother adam has seen a image of jesus christ before but the one he saw in the cloud there was something happening that was different from the way he'd seen him before he said he looked like the head of hoffman i had never seen that before in billy sunday's tabernacle years later i saw it my house have never been without one of those pictures since then here in the skies watch where he's directing saying that the very god that i saw up in the v this vision out here just a little boy how many of y'all remember that time he saw jesus christ in the field and he said he was he was uh you know in midair and and and when brother turned around and he said jesus he said the next thing i know i was just weeping and crying he just lost time but let me go on he said there in the sky saying that the very god that i saw in this vision out here just a little boy out here by where by where the this school house stands he looked like that and here in the heavens 33 years later declared it that's that's it's the truth that the way he looks not some mystic something of somebody idea no he said now i saw him and that was the way he looked not some mystic idea he said i saw him not only did i see him in the field but i saw him that image amen in in in in the brother's house billy sundays so what are you saying the word comes to the prophet jesus was among all the pharisees sadducees he was among them he taught in that synagogue but it was john because he was a prophet who was able to identify that jesus was the messiah hallelujah y'all understand what i'm trying to say it took a prophet in this day to identify jesus christ and to identify what his coming amen oh god help us brother braham said i was baptizing them at the end of spring street in jeffersonville indiana in the ohio river when nearly seven or eight thousand people standing on the bank they bear witness that two o'clock at two o'clock in the evening june 1933 how that a pillar of fire come down out of heaven and hung over where i was standing the courier journey and the time news no it was it was he said oh i get the name of those papers just a minute if i could just think of it the louisville paper get a great article mystic light appears over local baptist evangelists while baptizing at the river very mystic thing people couldn't not understand it many fainted at the presence of it the angel of the lord come down right down and hung over where i was the louisville herald it is what it was louisville harold herald post of of of louisville he said that was the paper that caught the scene of it you know it it just seemed like he and john the baptist was was moving in the same direction what god did in john the baptist's life god also did in his life and you must understand that this thing didn't happen in a corner it was open show and most of the people missed it but this is the thing i'm coming to in just a moment and i'm closing see it's hidden and we'll look at this thing and we say oh brother oh i'm so glad i'm in the message and we just get an intellectual thing this thing make you need more than that this message must drop from the head to your heart from the from the this to your to your heart it must produce life and if it's not produced in life you need to pray before god until it does hallelujah you say why is that the message don't go out in these great big places these big crusades like amongst the denomination and let me tell you something every last one of us will have to give an account because of our attitude toward this message every one of us don't think you're going to get away with it god is looking at you right now he understands your very thought about what's being preached and one thing i'm going to tell you about one thing about god he could care less about what you think it's not their food it's not the church so calls food it's the bride food it's spiritual food in season so what are you saying why was it in when brother bannon was alive why did not they get what he was saying because it wasn't their season it wasn't their time god needed a new one a new generation a new group of people to cross over hallelujah like it was in the days of joshua is that right hallelujah it's not their food it's not the church so called food it's the bride food it's spiritual food and season it would make them sick at their stomach it's too rich for them you can't do it but for the children it's bread it's life it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's going to get listen we're going to get too late if we don't start the prayer line now okay so let us bow our heads in just for a moment but let's let's move on dear god food and due season spiritual food something that the world knows nothing of we will hear our lord say that night or that day down there at the samaria the same place that elijah walked up and said why the dew will not fall till i call for it here stood jesus there telling the disciples says master why don't you eat he said i have food that you know not of truly lord his food was to do the will of god to see the works of god made manifest in his hour you know what food is it's a sustaining force it's a power that god has allowed to to give us strength to move on and what jesus said i've got to do god's will that's my that's my strength that's my power that's what makes me run that's what makes me operating y'all understand that's what makes me operate the message should make you operate it should be the thing that you yearn you eat you you you you hung the thor you thirst for it now i'm gonna tell you when i get irritated it's that's one place i get irritated in when i can't study like i want to when things get in my way that makes me irritable i love my private time with god i enjoy my private time somebody ought to say amen somebody ought to have some private time in here somebody should be able to witness back truly lord his food was to do his the will of god to see the work of god made manifest in his hour he was there to see that it was done i do nothing except my father show me what father showed me that i'll do in other words he was depending upon his whole thing was to do the father's will and we come to this message and the father's wheel is a million miles away from us and all we can think about is what i want to do it's not what you want to do you've been bought with a price and you're not your own you're supposed to sell your soul to this message because this message is jesus christ i don't care about what other people say it doesn't matter what you think the truth of the matter is you know i tried to tell people this i said see you guys are in a good place and position i'm in i'm in a pastoral position that means god is going to get me if i don't preach you truth god is going to get me so i don't care about how your facial expressions are that's what god told ezekiel don't be afraid of their faces amen don't be afraid it doesn't matter whether you like me you can roll your eyes you can pout your mouth it doesn't matter i'm gonna preach what he wants me to preach you can take it or leave it i feel god not nobody in here no no no no um and father so is it today the church the true believer the body of believers has access to food spiritual food that no no uh nominals knows nothing about let me ask you a question how often do you listen to a tape or read a book what is your thing with this food you understand me are you really into the message or the message into you many times i'm preaching and sometimes you know i can't get a smile but no joy and most of the time people don't have joy because you don't have a revelation of grace gracious keeps a smile on your face grace keeps you with joy hallelujah because you realize the power of the blood of jesus christ hallelujah but when you are under law and you just think i can't do this i can't do that yes i preach things that you should not do but it shouldn't be because of the law it should be the if it is a law it must be the law of love i love him so i won't do it and father so is it today the church the true believer the body of believers has access to the foods spiritual food that nominals knows nothing about the whole the world knows nothing of this food father but your church your people your bride the bride of your son loves it if you don't love it if you don't love this message that means every jot every tittle everything if you don't love this message how can you be bride hello we have access to healings of our bodies when the doctors have failed we have access to this it's one of the foods of god that he gave to his church and promised it in the last days amen to his believing children father help us now i'm going back now and i'm a close on this because i want you to understand that when god came down in 1963 that was the beginning of the rapture hello and only my sheep heareth my voice this is what we call the mighty angel coming down he never went back he's here i'm not dismissing the the the coming of the corporate body that's not i'm not dismissing but what i'm trying to tell you is that when that mighty angel came down and listen brother balaam called he didn't know it himself did he did he know what was happening then not exactly oh you better not say that yeah the prophet god first said those angels those seven angels he kept pointing out the one with the swept back wings is that right he called him the angels of the lord right he saw the vision he saw the pyramid but he wasn't looking at it right two years later god comes to him and says turn it right and he turned the picture right he said oh there he is and you'll find out amen that he says that's my lord like john the baptist that's my lord john said behold the lamb of god that take away the sins of the world and saint john under the same anointing of elijah comes and he points it to the cloud oh god hallelujah he wasn't a lamb anymore he was a lion hallelujah he was supreme deity hallelujah that's my lord what was it he come for who rebecca he comes from rebecca he comes for you now how are you going brother brown said the camel in which rebecca road was the type of the holy ghost you can't meet elijah you can't meet god excuse me without the holy ghost you need something to ride on hallelujah amen and you know with the holy ghost it's an up and down ride you're out of camel amen it all depends on how many humps he's got and which one you're riding on hallelujah but the truth of the matter is it'll take you where you need to go hallelujah you love the lord hallelujah amen amen now we understand by god's grace he says now see you don't you don't know it jesus said the blind pharisee says if if the blind leaves the blind don't they both fall in the ditch see that's the reason those people don't see that see the mystery of it is those seals each one of those churches made an organization and got into it and that one that's one of the secret things that's been wrong before god see you see it dr lee see look it is that the thing right here there that one of the secrets they organized see and was completely out of the will of god hallelujah now i'm gonna bring it down to us because if we're just following a system a system is another way of organizing you got to have it like this you got to have it like that no sir where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty it's not something that's going to pin you down when it comes to worship every man every woman every boy and girl is free to worship you're free to live like god wants you to live hallelujah but we've got so systematic and that system will bring you to a slow death holly is that right we're moving we're supposed to be listen people say we are no longer a pentecostal but god never took away the experience he never took away the joy of pentecost hallelujah every age is supposed to be a fold of us we're the completion of it you mean to tell me the greatest word ever hit the earth and we're not supposed to have joy something's wrong something's really wrong you mean to tell me you're going to let satan be greater than god that's what you're doing every time you allow satan to to hold you hold real listen to the words to hold you in a state of depression you are a witness to satan amen you're a witness to him and the bible's as great as he that's in us that he that is in the world honey is that okay listen to oh i ain't nobody come by my house nobody don't call me so what what that got to do with you is that right you need to learn how to encourage yourself in the lord hallelujah yes sir amen you stay in the word listen you can't find a friend i've got one that i'm going to suggest to you jesus christ he will stick closer to you than a brother i hear people like that all the time oh nobody don't hardly call me nobody don't come by and and i you know they don't love me and i'm like do you love them it works both ways you know you can get fellowship by leaving where you are and go find some right yeah you gonna stay in the house ain't nobody coming by do you go anywhere that's the truth if you need a friend call him up show up [Music] none of us should be lonely or lonesome listen to not fellowship is a sin brother brandon what is fellowship two fellows in a ship not one two at least get you one other right and the truth of the matter is when you when the devil isolate you then you look at everybody else like the evil yeah yeah that's what the devil says there ain't no say they ain't right and you forget you ain't either you know it's the truth you know i'm going down here but that's the truth the bible says even like this when you see that day approaching come together the more that's when i know that people don't have a full revelation because you'll be sitting home on your couch eating a burger or something and church is going on but you got enough strength to go get you some chicken oh yeah yeah yeah yeah see i got all y'all now you don't got quiet business the truth is which which food is more important you're going to need this let me ask you a question what if the day you miss church because of slaughterness then god revealed something and you missed it at the day that you thought don't you ever think satan is stupid when satan dismisses you or causes you to miss church he's actually causing you to miss something that god has planned and prepared for you amen now that ain't not but the truth i've seen you know uh in my ministry i've seen people that god in other words god brings a message and the people are not there the main one that you don't need it they're not there something god the devil has done i'm almost done with this portion but god needs a witness and whenever it comes to be a witness i'm closing you're going to be in trouble god never causes you to be a witness without bringing opposition hallelujah is that right always and the bible said god has never left himself without a witness how many other are witnesses for a message for the message amen when me and those brothers went out to our graves lake and we sang and and praised the lord and and witnessed we had people come up we had people filming us we had people parked in their cars because they were too shame to get out hallelujah but one of the one of the people says listen we came and they they joined us they actually started singing with us and everything else they said we we we so appreciate your boldness how many christians got enough boldness now amen to stand on the corner to witness somebody about what you truly believe in you know what it is most of the time of us we want witness because we know that if we do witness maybe somebody out there has witnessed us they don't see you somewhere and they don't understand how can you be preaching about jesus and living another life help me jesus but when you know amen that your life is clear and your life is clean you don't have to worry about nobody stumbling across you hallelujah let me move on then these children talk about shadrach meshach and abednego god witnesses god has never been without a witness he has always now hear what i want to get this real close god has never at any time been without a witness on the earth he has always had a at least one man he could put his hand on that's what i'm saying if nobody else has got is a witness that's what i want to be e i don't go about i don't go off what everybody else is doing i just got to be that one hallelujah he has always had at least one man he could put his hands on say that's my witness it comes down to one man one time and job was his only witness and abraham in the land but god had a witness somebody is going to witness for god somewhere and sisters whenever you witness for god people even in this message going to thank you too you your old fogey girl i wouldn't listen to my husband like that y'all watch the company you keep anybody that's gonna influence you against your husband ain't right my you want god to love you unconditionally you need to learn how to love your husband unconditionally and he need to learn how to love you unconditionally hallelujah let me go let me hit this now because it came to my mind and every woman who's the boss of the house you are out of order a lot of people said that's why i tell you what that's why it's difficult to marry a woman that's making more money huh she's making more money you got something on your hand it's something when she ain't making that money that's our money that's our money but as soon as you get a little nice little job making a little bit more than you that's my money you know it ain't always it's not always like that but i've seen it i've seen it happen so that you'll know by god's grace when you allow things like that you got to stay with the word sisters you know what i'm saying if he ain't doing right you got to do like one of those old sayings like sarah did god handle him please put god on him god will make him right god will straighten him out but you know you just don't grab him in the collar when he comes through the door and yeah people do that too i ain't just preaching they grab them snatch them in while they're coming in i'm closing i'm closing i've seen it happen i'm telling you i've seen it happen even in the pentecostal church amen the i'm talking about a brother bigger than me and his wife like this right but every time he would come to church he knew he had to go home to a beating he had enough guard in him he wouldn't hit her back right and she took that as a witness a weakness and when he come home oh my he got it yeah we don't have nothing like that here though i'm sure you love the lord my point is it is hard to sometimes stay in position but you must stay in position in order to make a rapture you understand me sisters i know it's difficult you listen you know it doesn't mean because you the the the uh weaker vessel and you know what it doesn't mean that you're not smarter than your husband some sisters are smarter than their husbands even if the husband don't want to recognize it it's true they get intimidated because the sister no more hallelujah that's a gift brother if you use it in the right way you'll move forward you don't look at all your woman you can't tell me nothing you said you see you can't tell me that because i used to be that way i'm the head of the house you better know it right but then i learned things through my wife i understood things through my wife my wife had insight about people i didn't have said brother brooks that ain't your friend they using you and sure enough it'll come out just that way so i had to learn how to listen to her y'all you these brothers they smiling now so someone some won't even say amen but it doesn't matter god gave you the gift and you don't use it that's your fault that's your fault that's your fault you're losing out that's right brother you know what i'm talking about but the truth of the matter is we must understand we work together is that right some things jesus christ did not do because he left them here for us to do and we represent the woman you understand me so another little thing in closing i'm shutting this off understand if you miss the order of the word if you don't keep the order of the word you are allowing a perverted spirit to enter into your families is that right laodicea jezebel whoever you want to call her she she she removed her headship and look what her children look like look at all the perversion in her in her children because she rejected her headship y'all understand what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is like we who are in the word we who are the message now some of us we can't help it we can't help certain things it's you know we got people here amen who who husband or spouses are not believers i'm not talking about that kind of situation i'm talking about believers those of us who profess to be believers y'all gonna go home and say don't y'all listen what brother brother say you'll get over there and you carry on like that and what i say go oh was in my house i don't care what the preacher said revelation who's preaching then whenever you get adopt that kind of attitude you don't have a revelation who's preaching i know who's saying these things and my point is this i have to give an account for everything i just said this morning and you and i must understand we're living in the last days and i want to be you know what made sarah the mother of of us is because she knew obedience she knew how to submit to herself until we understand the natural aspects of these things we ourselves will not understand the spiritual aspects we must submit to our headship which is the word amen and if we don't submit to the word we're not going to submit to one another that's just the way it is let's stand i don't take sides that's one thing about me i don't take sides so all all i want everybody to know because you might not like a brother not might like not like a sister don't mean i don't like them because i might be your friend you might feel like i shouldn't be with that person that's nonsense that's so childish very very very very childish we are body of christ and if there's anything hindering you from fellowshipping with anyone in this place there is a word we call repentance because you can't love god and hate your brother [Music] won't work god puts certain obstacles in your way because he wants you to overcome them that's your test we're talking about the capstone ministry which is divine love what do you think satan going to do he's going to throw everything in your way to keep you from divine love and what keeps us from divine love is the demonic power of pride pride is one of the wickedest things anyone and everyone could have it doesn't matter who you are small great rich or poor if pride is in your life it will destroy you it'll keep you from having great relationships but i trust somehow something was said today because this is a wicked world everything is evil the way i thought i was going to go this morning god redirected me but the point is i wanted to say we're living in a world that's full of wickedness you don't have to go shopping for it it's out there the worst age ever i often think to myself if william branham was living here living now how would he behave i don't think he could if he almost fainted when he saw the church of america walking what would he see now and what do we see now i mean it's so amazing that people who are wearing their underwear undergarments out for outerwear and nobody thinks about it they don't even know they're naked i don't know how come it is but the only thing i could say is when they when they removed the word of god they removed the standard they removed that place that that kept people in check and when you leave that out out of your house uh expect satan to come last bout of word of prayer father god i i come before you lord as humble as i know how we're at a time that i i see you lord working in a way to to get the people to repent i can't make no one repent i personally ha i repent every day lord from something lord i pray that you help us unite this church lord unite your people let them see that the enemy is not one or the other or each other but our enemy is satan himself we don't want to be classified as being wicked in your eyes we don't want to have the knowledge to do good and don't do lord be merciful to us give us what we stand in need of to make a rapture lord lord i don't it's not like i fear fear fear hell truly no man wants to go there but my desire is to love you so much and to be obedient to you lord that hell will not be able to come near me i do not want to die of failure i do not want to die coming up short of this glory you called us you chose us you elected

lord that we'll put away all of the foolish things things that ties us into hell spiritual ropes lord spiritual ties that's pulling us downward break and destroy the yokes of the enemy father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen when he reached down his hand oh me [Music] i'm so glad about it when he reached down his [Music] without

speaking to us speaking to me as well it's every day lord i look in the word i'm always seeing something that needs to be corrected father i thank you for your word that corrects there's only one perfect one and i know the only way that we'll make heaven is that we be accepted in you we understand in order to get into you we must be baptized into your body by one spirit which is the holy ghost father i pray this morning if there be any there out there on youtube lord that you have mercy and grant them their requests the people here lord in higher ground tabernacle i pray for them pray for us lord we we need a refresh we really need you to come in lord and give us that revival that brother branham talked about that revival that would clean us and cleanse us lord help us jesus that we we won't allow the lair to see his spirit to get on us or in us help us lord that we will always be meek and humble before you lord god we know that we have no enemies in here we know who our enemy is and our enemy is the devil himself father i said a lot of things this morning and i i do believe that you caused me to say these things but i say these things not in anger not in frustration but in your divine love help us jesus there's not a soul in here lord that i would desire to see lost i don't want to be lost and surely wouldn't want no one else to be i don't want to be left behind and surely don't want to see anyone else left behind father we're all pressing toward that mark any time i can expose the devil lord give me the grace and strength to do so he is our enemy law father but you said the bride of jesus christ will overcome we'll overcome all of his tactics so much so lord god he he'll look at us one day and not know what to do father continue give us grace to to to to to to build up our most holy faith in you let us take all of the things that we have seen all of the word that we have heard and let us heal this holy temple father help us god bless each and every one of us lord as we go to our different destinies most of all i pray that you open the eyes of your people to the day and the hour that we're living in cause of desperation our souls that we'll make it
