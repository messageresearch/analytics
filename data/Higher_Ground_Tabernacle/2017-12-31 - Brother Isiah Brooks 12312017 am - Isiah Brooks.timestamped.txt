[12:24] [Applause]
[12:31] [Applause]
[12:33] no higher amen
[12:45] I have two melodies in my head the old
[12:48] melody from the denominational Church in
[12:50] this hill and I got mixed up but by
[12:54] God's grace a man we
[13:15] [Applause]

[13:47] [Music]
[14:03] [Music]
[14:40] [Music]
[15:09] [Music]
[16:26] that's what we need hallelujah and God
[16:32] is willing to give it to every one of us
[16:34] Amen who want that divine love amen not
[16:38] some filial love but the agape in the
[16:43] god-given love the love that can only be
[16:45] given by God is the one that you can't
[16:47] fake it either
[16:49] it's real I like it I like the idea
[16:53] because I believe that everybody wants
[16:55] to be real halleluyah halleluyah
[16:59] as we stand please you know I I was
[17:10] thinking how so many of us are
[17:13] Christians and it's not just in this
[17:15] place we don't realize how important the
[17:18] Word of God is you know we should not be
[17:22] the people that just wait to come to
[17:24] church to read the Bible the Bible is a
[17:27] source that God has given to us and it
[17:29] is what we call our daily bread Bible in
[17:33] itself is so important to your spiritual
[17:35] growth without reading it you basically
[17:38] starving yourself spiritually and so I
[17:42] just thought I just Minister on I am the
[17:47] bread this morning because I think we
[17:50] need to know that this coming year we
[17:53] ought to be more dedicated to reading
[17:55] God's Word we say we love him but how
[17:57] can you love him and won't read his word
[17:58] I do understand
[18:01] a lot of people don't like reading but
[18:03] what you need to do is ask God to give
[18:05] you the grace to to love to read
[18:07] especially his word and if you don't if
[18:10] you don't want to do it that way ask God
[18:12] to give you an app so you can put the
[18:14] Bible on yo but my point the important
[18:17] thing is you need to hear it every day
[18:20] amen and that's me if I'm not reading
[18:23] I'm listening we're not listening I'm
[18:25] reading it's important even whether you
[18:29] know I think to myself even if I'm not
[18:31] getting it my subconscious is the man
[18:35] who's supposed to get it is getting it
[18:37] amen so I thank God for His grace and
[18:39] His mercy and I trust the Lord bless the
[18:42] students message Isaiah 40 we're gonna
[18:46] read the tenth and eleventh verse then
[18:49] we'll go through st. John 6
[18:58] okay that's right
[19:01] we used to have some extra Bibles Isaiah
[19:08] 40 10 and 11 behold the Lord will come
[19:13] with strong hand and his arm shall rule
[19:18] for him behold his reward is with him
[19:23] and his work before him he shall feed
[19:28] his flock like a shepherd he should
[19:31] gather the Lambs with his arm and carry
[19:34] them in his bosom and shall gently lead
[19:37] those that are with young hallelujah st.
[19:43] John 6 we'll begin at the 44th verse I
[19:48] love that scripture ye shall feed his
[19:52] flock like a shepherd and a Good
[19:55] Shepherd always feeds his flock amen no
[20:00] man that can come to me except the
[20:03] Father which have sent me draw him and I
[20:07] will raise him up at the last day it is
[20:11] written in the prophets and they shall
[20:13] be all taught of God every man therefore
[20:17] that hath heard and have learned of the
[20:21] Father cometh unto me that's important
[20:24] that scripture and they shall be taught
[20:31] of God every man there forth that have
[20:37] heard and have learned of the Father
[20:39] cometh unto me not that any man have
[20:44] seen the father save he which is of God
[20:46] he hath seen the father
[20:50] verily verily I say unto you he that
[20:52] believeth on me shall excuse me believe
[20:57] it on me hath everlasting life I am the
[21:01] that bread of life now you're gonna find
[21:05] out in some of the scriptures we talk
[21:07] about the bread of life but here Jesus
[21:09] as
[21:10] identifying himself with his own lips
[21:13] that he is I am that Bread of Life your
[21:18] father's did eat manna in the wilderness
[21:20] and are dated this is the bread which
[21:24] cometh down from heaven that a man may
[21:27] eat thereof and not die I am The Living
[21:32] bread which came down from heaven If any
[21:36] man eat of this bread he shall live
[21:38] forever and the bread that I will give
[21:42] is my flesh which I will give for the
[21:45] life of the world now he's really
[21:48] working it the Jews therefore strove
[21:51] among themselves saying how can this man
[21:53] give us his flesh to eat
[21:55] he calls a commotion a disturbance then
[22:00] jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[22:02] unto you except you eat this flesh of
[22:05] the Son of Man and drink his blood ye
[22:07] have no life in you very important there
[22:13] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[22:15] my blood hath eternal life and I will
[22:18] raise him up at the last day
[22:20] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[22:23] is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh
[22:26] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[22:31] I in him as a living father have sent me
[22:34] and I live by the father so he that
[22:37] eateth me even he shall live by me
[22:42] this is that bread which came down from
[22:45] heaven now how does your father's did
[22:48] eat manna and are dead he that eateth of
[22:51] this bread shall live for ever
[22:55] let us pray father we thank you for your
[22:57] grace thank you for your mercy we just
[23:00] pray Lord God this morning that you
[23:02] perfect will be done he'll dine on way
[23:05] Lord the father would give you the
[23:07] praise the glory and honor help us now
[23:11] Jesus that we will lure way all
[23:13] distractions out of our lives and father
[23:16] that we will focus this coming year Lord
[23:20] to learn more of you because you say
[23:24] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[23:27] for I am meek and lowly in heart help us
[23:30] now take your great Shepherd in Jesus
[23:33] Christ's name we pray amen
[23:35] you may be seated he is the great
[23:39] Shepherd amen
[23:41] now it's not too warm in here is it it
[23:44] is just tap down somebody yeah I'm
[23:52] already hot and I'm not even started yet
[23:55] haven't even started but I rather be too
[23:57] hot and then cool a little bit then to
[24:00] cook oh you know so we get a little bit
[24:04] more praise out of you when it's warm
[24:07] amen oh I can't move too fast when it's
[24:10] cold but you love the Lord I'm excited
[24:14] I'm excited because I see God doing
[24:17] things in my life and you ought to be
[24:18] excited too to see God doing things in
[24:22] your life now when we talk about bread
[24:24] we all know what that's like you know I
[24:26] know some people that just love bread
[24:28] bread is really good I like it too but
[24:31] I'm not like most people I can do
[24:33] without it but I do know some people
[24:36] they can't do without bread they gotta
[24:38] have bread and and it's okay because
[24:40] bread represent is a good thing we know
[24:43] about by God's grace that God has dealt
[24:46] with bread barley bread wheat French you
[24:48] know I'm saying and you know we must
[24:50] understand that God always liking
[24:52] himself as bread when we look about look
[24:56] at the scripture we find out that the
[24:58] bread I'm talking about it's not a
[25:00] natural greatest spiritual and we find
[25:03] out that Jesus is telling his disciples
[25:05] and all those who are listening who he
[25:08] really is
[25:08] now can you imagine you sitting in this
[25:11] group of people and Jesus is talking
[25:13] about the bread and he's talking about
[25:14] the manner because see a lot of the
[25:16] Pharisees and Sadducees they prompt this
[25:18] this this this speech that went on
[25:21] because they claimed that they were of
[25:25] Moses and of Abraham and and here was
[25:28] God coming down and he's telling them
[25:30] now you you you've got to follow me
[25:32] because I am that bread like Moses gave
[25:35] it in the wilderness now
[25:37] can you imagine their minds because
[25:40] being calm minded they could only see
[25:42] mana they can only see these little
[25:45] coriander seeds that they crushed and
[25:48] made me love flower out of and make
[25:51] bread that's all I can see but now you
[25:53] know because you got to understand he's
[25:54] now taking a tight and he's bringing it
[25:56] into reality that this was just a tight
[25:59] this is what when God was showing forth
[26:02] you know preparing the way for me and
[26:05] now he says now I am that bread and you
[26:10] know the thing that really gets me is
[26:11] that when Christ began to say your
[26:15] father's did eat manna in the wilderness
[26:17] and they are all dead now the Jews
[26:21] understood when he said dead he
[26:24] understood when he said they are all
[26:25] separated from God they did make it over
[26:29] and you think that that would have
[26:31] really caused a real stir and then he
[26:34] goes only said except you eat my flesh
[26:36] and drink my blood you have no life game
[26:40] you see you must eat the bleeding bloody
[26:42] word of the Son of Man and that's what
[26:46] this message is when we think about by
[26:50] God's grace Jesus is not working with ya
[26:54] you got to understand this congregation
[26:55] is calling and he's trying to give them
[26:59] something spiritual and now Jesus is
[27:02] saying if you're mine you're going to
[27:06] hear what I'm saying because my sheep
[27:08] hears my voice and a stranger they will
[27:11] not follow in other words they may not
[27:12] understand what I'm saying
[27:14] but they know what I'm saying is to
[27:16] truth see and he says now you say that
[27:20] you are of Abraham's Abraham is your
[27:22] father but he said in some places
[27:26] Abraham rejoiced to see my day and those
[27:29] just no snares he says now we know he
[27:31] got a devil cuz this man is not even
[27:34] over fifty years old see they even guess
[27:37] wrong but nevertheless amen they go on
[27:40] and I'd only get ahead of myself but the
[27:43] point is Jesus is trying like he always
[27:46] have tried to tell people I am yo get
[27:51] Gateway to life in other words if you're
[27:54] going to come to the invisible father
[27:56] you must come by me I am the visibility
[28:00] of God if you're going to see God you're
[28:04] gonna see him by mean if you're gonna
[28:07] have life
[28:07] you're gonna hit see him by me now see
[28:10] in that day they understood the
[28:13] importance of bread we got home
[28:18] consecrate it now right but in that day
[28:21] bread was a vital source of food for
[28:25] them
[28:26] it's amazing how they're telling us that
[28:28] wheat bread and barley bread and all
[28:30] these kind of brands now are no good for
[28:31] us when it's sustained Israel thank but
[28:35] God's bread in its original fall will
[28:39] always produce healthy things so we
[28:42] realized by God's grace and then he's
[28:44] he's telling us these things and he's
[28:46] trying to get us to see by God's grace
[28:49] that he is that bread of life now I want
[28:52] you to understand that even his
[28:54] disciples didn't fully understand what
[28:57] he was saying and there were times he
[29:01] had to just openly say what it really
[29:05] what he really was and he's standing
[29:07] getting right but at least those Devils
[29:11] saying wait a minute now and by hearing
[29:13] right are you trying to tell me that you
[29:16] and God are equal we gonna stone you but
[29:21] this is the important part I love this
[29:24] part
[29:24] jesus said in other words can you find
[29:28] any fault in me if you don't believe me
[29:33] for what I'm saying
[29:34] search my life my life will prove to you
[29:40] that I am not only the bread but there's
[29:44] no leavening in me that I have done
[29:46] everything God has told me to do right
[29:51] so he was like listen check it out
[29:53] search my background you'll find out
[29:56] that there's nothing hidden in my life I
[29:59] haven't done no sin you can't even find
[30:01] it there's not even one scripture in the
[30:04] law that can
[30:05] give me because I've done it there all
[30:07] right she they got mad at him because
[30:10] they knew right
[30:12] remember Amen when Nicodemus came to
[30:15] rabbi we know that thou art teacher from
[30:17] God we because we know no man can do
[30:21] these kind of miracles except God be
[30:23] with them so the crowd in itself had an
[30:26] idea even though they didn't want to
[30:28] accept him because perhaps he came from
[30:30] Nazareth and one case says can anything
[30:33] come good come out of Nazareth in other
[30:36] words with a wicked City and in the
[30:38] minds of you know you got to realize the
[30:40] Jews mindset mindset that that God is
[30:45] just so holy you know he could never be
[30:48] born you know in Nazareth come on live
[30:52] in Nazareth and he could never be born
[30:53] amen in a manger he could he be coming
[30:56] he's gonna come to the greatest stop
[30:58] organization there is he he'll come to
[31:01] the Pharisees and we'll blow the trumpet
[31:03] and here riding on a white horse or
[31:04] whatever the case may be but they had
[31:06] their all theology and because they had
[31:09] their own theology let me tell you
[31:11] something brother Aranda when he said
[31:13] and he preached that message God is
[31:16] revealed in simplicity and hidden in the
[31:19] same it's still the same if you look for
[31:24] God in this popped up thing you won't
[31:27] find him in God is among the lowly
[31:30] that's simple you find God in a place
[31:33] like this right I mean we don't have the
[31:37] stained-glass windows and all that you
[31:39] know we you know we we've just got what
[31:41] God has given us but it's in these kinds
[31:44] of places that's right even the prophet
[31:47] of God said if you want to look for God
[31:48] go looking for a storefront you might
[31:51] find him there see because God is in a
[31:54] simple way now how simple can you get
[31:59] when you liken yourself as bread and God
[32:05] comes along and he's saying listen and
[32:07] so father have sent me and I live by the
[32:10] father so he that eateth me even he
[32:13] should live by me now this is disturbing
[32:17] these people
[32:18] cause they have perhaps heard of
[32:20] cannibals and their minds like eat him
[32:26] this man is insane
[32:28] he not he's in hell only just eat me but
[32:31] drink my blood but you understand what
[32:34] he was doing he was purposely downsizing
[32:39] he was purposely shedding off the breed
[32:42] unbelievers and to make believers he was
[32:45] purposely and let me tell you something
[32:47] God will always bring a word if you
[32:50] taught if you own the line like that and
[32:54] God has warned you and warned you and
[32:56] warned you and warned you you know what
[32:57] God will do here bring a word that'll
[32:58] make you go
[33:00] he will purposely do it you think I'm
[33:05] crazy huh
[33:05] I lived when I lived in Lima Ohio there
[33:08] was a family Amen in it I don't call no
[33:10] names but this family you know was
[33:12] really giving me some trouble and they
[33:14] were bringing leavening in the church
[33:15] they were actually just not dressing
[33:18] right and doing right and the Holy
[33:20] Spirit said you preach this and they'll
[33:22] leave I preached it next Sunday they
[33:26] were gone I said brothers you should
[33:28] have done that I did not do it I was
[33:32] obedient because you got to understand
[33:35] why pastors have to be hard sometime
[33:38] because a little leavening with leaven
[33:41] the whole lump
[33:42] hello you don't believe that brother
[33:46] branham said that's what happened to the
[33:47] Pentecostal church they saw miss Kennedy
[33:50] and they all began to cut their hair and
[33:53] get that water head hairdo like Miss
[33:55] Kennedy why because some faster let the
[33:58] leavening in this is why when we take
[34:01] communion and I'm working with communion
[34:03] too this is why we take communion and
[34:06] the bread must be undone Lebanon it
[34:09] cannot have any kind of yeast or
[34:11] anything that is going to pump it up or
[34:15] alter it at all it must be simple right
[34:23] and you and I must understand Amen that
[34:26] this bread we're talking about comes
[34:29] from heaven I thought about this word
[34:31] and
[34:31] sometimes were preaching the way he want
[34:33] me to preach it when Jesus said man does
[34:37] not live by bread alone I thought wait a
[34:40] minute but he is the bread he's saying
[34:43] now he says in the scripture that you
[34:47] can't even live without him but he just
[34:49] told me he was the bread but he's not
[34:52] talking about a natural bread here
[34:54] because when he said but he lives by
[34:57] every word that proceedeth out of the
[34:59] mouth of God
[35:00] and I thought there it is because the
[35:03] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[35:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[35:08] God
[35:09] hallelujah and I'm gonna read you some
[35:11] scripture jesus said he proceeded out of
[35:15] God hallelujah not only did he proceed
[35:18] of God but he became the very mouthpiece
[35:21] of God hallelujah
[35:24] this is why in the book of Revelation
[35:29] Jesus is called the Alpha and the Omega
[35:33] the a and is it or the Z hallelujah amen
[35:38] he is the beginning and he is the ending
[35:41] by him all things were made by him all
[35:44] things consist by him everything that is
[35:47] created was created by him I'm talking
[35:49] about this bread and this bread is so
[35:53] healthy because once you see that
[35:55] disparate ate if I if I had a little
[35:57] portion of of a little juice and you
[36:00] know we didn't know nothing about Jesus
[36:02] per se if I said this juice I know will
[36:05] not only transform you but change you
[36:07] back to your youth and would give them
[36:09] eternal life that's it but I've got only
[36:11] a small glass of it and it's mine I
[36:16] wonder how many of y'all will attack me
[36:23] before I you might not want to do it in
[36:25] front of everybody else but somebody
[36:27] would say if it's walking yeah it must
[36:34] work you know me all these gray hairs
[36:36] darling you know oh boy I got to get my
[36:40] hand on that right come on somebody
[36:43] you're not born again so you know how
[36:45] that nature
[36:45] is I got to get my hand on it you would
[36:48] do whatever you could do just to get a
[36:51] drop of it
[36:52] cuz that's all you need just a drop
[36:56] right and people could see that's how it
[36:59] is with God right just just gonna just
[37:03] get a drop I think about Lazarus you
[37:06] know I don't know what was in his mind
[37:08] but when that rich young ruler would
[37:10] would drop the crumbs from this table
[37:12] he understood those crowns was gonna
[37:14] sustain his life and that's the way I
[37:16] look at this world of goddesses Lord if
[37:19] you just gotta give me crumbs from this
[37:22] bread it will sustain my life
[37:26] hallelujah now we should oh brother this
[37:33] this bread is eternal and I love this
[37:37] because there's a story in the Word of
[37:41] God and st. Luke and you don't have to
[37:43] turn there but here's the disciples
[37:46] after it I'll be jumping back and forth
[37:48] after they came amen are their own the
[37:51] road of Annamayya and as they traveled
[37:54] the road in May as he comes visiting a
[37:57] stranger to them because remember Jesus
[37:59] Christ had been crucified and and and he
[38:03] was beaten to such a position Amen he
[38:05] did not even look human and so when they
[38:09] did I seen him his face his features was
[38:12] a mess perhaps there was no description
[38:15] that that they could give to you of him
[38:17] after that they had been he had been
[38:20] crucified but here's a young strong man
[38:22] walking with him but have had a hood on
[38:25] I don't know how he disguised himself
[38:26] but he began to walk with him brother
[38:29] and you know what I you know just
[38:31] putting it in our terms he probably just
[38:34] got up on him say well what's going on
[38:35] brothers you know and they looking at
[38:39] him like wait a minute are you coming
[38:41] from the same place I came from don't
[38:43] you know what just happened
[38:46] see you know you must understand how can
[38:50] I say it I like the way brother Jesse
[38:53] said even God praise hide and seek
[38:58] hallelujah and I like that because that
[39:01] is so true he hides himself in
[39:03] simplicity and he's revealed in the same
[39:07] right and God likes for you to seek out
[39:10] to him
[39:11] that's what about says seek me early and
[39:14] you will find me hallelujah but so God
[39:18] when God wants to hide he can walk right
[39:21] with you and you won't even know it's
[39:23] him that's why the Bible said be careful
[39:28] how you entertain strangers you could be
[39:31] entertaining angels unawares and so we
[39:34] find out by God's grace Amen that here
[39:37] they're on the road to Emmaus they all
[39:39] get down now watch this I'm gonna tell
[39:42] you something isn't it funny how you
[39:44] have Peter James and John thrown into
[39:46] jail while Jesus was living me uh excuse
[39:49] me and you know and then now they're
[39:51] excited they really excited because they
[39:53] know now he's living but but you find
[39:56] out that on the road to Emmaus these
[39:58] people are very sad brokenhearted
[40:01] I've lost my god in anyone standing in
[40:04] their minds or their hearts perhaps or
[40:06] with a mouse scuse me but in their minds
[40:08] and then they were discouraged and Jesus
[40:11] is faithful that God will not lose one
[40:15] he had called his disciples for a
[40:18] purpose because he was going to show
[40:20] them that he was really the Living bread
[40:22] huh now think about it how they must
[40:26] have been on the road to Emmaus thinking
[40:28] well you know that last supper we had
[40:33] was different even though he broke the
[40:38] bread and everything else something was
[40:40] going on because he began to tell us
[40:43] about the Son of Man being betrayed and
[40:45] all of these things and we didn't get it
[40:47] at the time but that bread he says now
[40:51] it was one bread and this is what I've
[40:54] been trying to tell us folks it's one
[40:56] bread one body one spirit this is why
[41:03] the prophet of God hated organization in
[41:05] denominationalism and if you're not
[41:07] careful you will form a
[41:09] nation around yourself but the body of
[41:13] Christ is not divided and you and I have
[41:17] no right to say who's got the Holy Ghost
[41:19] and who doesn't
[41:22] because you and I by God's grace some
[41:26] where we were before we came to this
[41:28] when I can remember giving my heart to
[41:31] the Lord at the age of 12 and I knew a
[41:33] change happened to me and I don't even
[41:34] know what I couldn't understand at all
[41:37] explain it from the age of 12 I could
[41:40] never hate anyone and I'm gonna tell you
[41:45] even then people did wicked things to me
[41:47] and I could never hate them that wasn't
[41:51] me
[41:52] I actually thought there was something
[41:54] wrong with me my daddy could hate why
[41:56] can't I hate but you see a change came
[42:00] into my life you said I don't believe
[42:03] that let me tell you something this is
[42:05] one experience no man can take for me
[42:06] when I was baptized in the name of the
[42:09] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[42:10] I came up out of that water and you know
[42:13] what God said to me I know it's his
[42:14] voice he said to me what is the name and
[42:20] I looked around bypass it and said
[42:22] nobody else and you know how they did it
[42:24] and those dignitary Baptist churches you
[42:26] know if you was poor and didn't have
[42:28] nothing you know your baptism was
[42:29] nothing but everybody that that money
[42:32] went down and I had to borrow in my robe
[42:36] like Jesus had to borrow his grave but
[42:39] you know I had the bar in my robe and
[42:41] you know you look at these people that
[42:42] had I watched everything oh this girl
[42:46] was oh it's wonderful it's wonderful but
[42:48] I had nobody to say wonderful to me but
[42:52] then God came along and says what is the
[42:55] name o my entire life God would always
[43:00] bring that back to me every now and
[43:01] again
[43:01] what is the name here I was a young man
[43:05] that had just come out of a not
[43:08] completed to college but I was out in
[43:09] Colorado came back home thirsting for
[43:11] God amen
[43:12] my friends had gotten saved and told me
[43:15] where to go to be where they went and
[43:17] you know I could remember the
[43:19] conversation before my mom died she told
[43:21] me about the baptism in the name of Lord
[43:22] Jesus Christ
[43:24] where to go well so all of these things
[43:26] became real I went up there it meant
[43:29] that long story short amen I ended up
[43:32] getting baptized but well while when I
[43:35] went to church I went up to the church
[43:37] not knowing I was late the church was
[43:38] over services were and here was the back
[43:42] door open while I'm going down this
[43:45] little inclined to go through the back I
[43:47] heard his father says be that baptized
[43:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[43:51] you don't have to believe that or not
[43:53] but I could tell you what I know what it
[43:55] is to be a hypocrite and not even know
[43:58] it
[43:58] because while I was in the Baptist
[44:00] Church we would sing on televisions
[44:02] right I had a gospel group we we called
[44:06] ourselves what it was voice and faith or
[44:08] something but anyway we were seeing go
[44:11] to the door to the studio on Fridays
[44:15] practice you know feel you know show you
[44:19] do your show and then we go to the club
[44:22] afterwards not only hello you know
[44:27] Baptists can do that it's alright for
[44:30] them to do that you know so don't bother
[44:31] look at you as a hypocrite but God hmm
[44:36] and we went to the club we did our
[44:38] drinking and everything else in the
[44:40] whole time I'm feeling condemned because
[44:42] something took place in me at 12 and but
[44:45] I was always that kind of person that
[44:47] wanted to fit in so I would compromise
[44:49] but this time something started holding
[44:53] and catching and I was singing this song
[44:56] think God have been saying thank God
[44:59] have been saved you know he watched me
[45:02] through and through and may my heart
[45:03] brand new thank God of his Saint and I
[45:07] get home in the Lord say you hypocrite I
[45:10] [Music]
[45:15] didn't know what I didn't understand it
[45:17] I didn't even know what was going on in
[45:19] me but I was looking at everybody else
[45:20] oh it's true somehow members on the
[45:24] owner on the group would you bring them
[45:25] many bottles and everything and when
[45:27] they what we're gonna do this afterwards
[45:29] you know but I would be convicted you
[45:33] understand me I'm telling the story so
[45:35] you can understand and
[45:37] I wasn't in the message at that time but
[45:40] election was pulling on me
[45:44] see that's what polls all of the foolish
[45:47] virgins auto denomination is election
[45:50] that's what poor the bride out of
[45:54] denominationalism is election that's
[45:57] what poor the bride and whoever else out
[45:59] of the world election hallelujah
[46:05] listen God dealt with with John the
[46:08] Baptist when he was a child put him in
[46:11] the wilderness nobody knew who John was
[46:12] until he came stumping out of the
[46:14] wilderness declaring the gospel of Jesus
[46:17] Christ and who can tell John God ain't
[46:20] in dealing with you
[46:22] hallelujah he wasn't even a part of
[46:24] nobody's Church you understand me he is
[46:27] the bread of life and you say well well
[46:31] brother what happened so I go in there
[46:34] the pool was open brother siblings was
[46:36] right there and I said I come to be
[46:38] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:40] Christ well when I was going to church I
[46:42] didn't realize I was going to be
[46:43] baptized so God spoke to me I you don't
[46:46] have to believe this portion but I'm
[46:48] gonna tell you anyway I was baptized in
[46:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when I
[46:52] went down in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:54] Christ and I rose to come up oh my god
[46:58] and I know water baptism it's not
[47:01] regeneration but I'm gonna tell you
[47:03] something God stopped right then and
[47:06] there all that wickedness yummy when I
[47:09] woke up when I come out of that water
[47:11] lights were everywhere now you say life
[47:15] all I can tell you they were lights and
[47:16] I began to scream and holler look at all
[47:19] those lights y'all see nobody saw the
[47:21] lights but me didn't even know what they
[47:24] were at the time but anyway to make a
[47:27] long story short that went out this man
[47:29] got baptized and this happened happened
[47:31] happened happened but anyway I didn't
[47:33] know I kept going in my life but when it
[47:35] came to this message let me tell y'all
[47:37] something I gotta tell you this some of
[47:39] you may have never heard but my momma
[47:40] told me about this message even before
[47:42] she died and she said Junior don't you
[47:44] be don't you be discouraged you gonna go
[47:46] and God gonna save you you gonna be a
[47:48] preacher and she said you gonna be at
[47:50] that church
[47:51] when you get in that church there gonna
[47:52] be a hard time for you she said but
[47:54] whatever you do jr. don't be discouraged
[47:57] because God has a greater light coming
[48:00] when I came who my God when I came to
[48:05] this message God said to me now you know
[48:08] the greater light see so nobody can take
[48:12] it away from me but what I'm saying in
[48:15] this day is that message this message
[48:17] had been preached and we've been here
[48:20] we've had all kinds of great mysteries
[48:22] told to us but Paul warned us y'all know
[48:26] who Paul is he is the first angel the
[48:31] first prophet amen outside of Jesus
[48:34] himself to the Gentile church he was the
[48:37] messenger of the emphasis age he got the
[48:40] four brief clip blueprint from God and
[48:42] Paul had such an authority he said
[48:45] except you believe what I have preached
[48:47] If any man even if an angel preach
[48:50] something different put leavening to it
[48:54] let him be accursed
[48:56] Oh hallelujah
[48:59] so you and I must understand that
[49:01] William Branham when God brought Elisha
[49:03] in our day he kicked not God had to make
[49:07] him a prophet because he could not God
[49:11] could not afford if I want to say it
[49:12] like that he would not allow any other
[49:14] he couldn't do another reformer because
[49:17] the Reformers never did get it all
[49:18] straight hallelujah they just got their
[49:21] little portion at all but he needed
[49:23] someone that would bring the bread and
[49:26] get all the leavening out hallelujah
[49:30] that was his duty that's why amen the
[49:33] mysteries of predestination in the
[49:35] marriage and divorce enough all of these
[49:37] things had to come because God had to
[49:41] make sure that this message had no
[49:43] leavening that's why the probably God
[49:46] said preach it just like I preach it
[49:48] don't let it take away just give it to
[49:51] me like I'm and you got to understand
[49:53] what he's saying I was listening amen to
[49:55] the to the adoption series and he saw
[49:57] what a nugget he said but then he said
[49:59] it this duck it can be polished and this
[50:01] bucket can be polished what was he
[50:02] saying he talked about how the preachers
[50:04] a
[50:05] would come along and take the foundation
[50:07] of it staying with the very thought of
[50:09] it but giving you more of it
[50:12] hallelujah something that gonna fit you
[50:14] in your day right so we look at this
[50:17] thing is your brother Brooks are you in
[50:19] your saying are you insane if I am just
[50:22] let me stay like this because I believe
[50:24] that when you're truly born again there
[50:26] is such on us our overwhelming joy that
[50:30] really strikes your soul and I don't
[50:34] care what you go through that joy and
[50:36] that peace is still in your soul you
[50:38] can't even get rid of it why because
[50:40] it's your governing force when you fall
[50:43] it tells you to get back up hallelujah
[50:45] when you think even tells you to think
[50:47] right when you do wrong it tells you to
[50:50] do right when you feel your brother
[50:52] tells you to make it right
[50:53] see that is the Living bread and that
[50:56] Living bread and you cannot be affected
[50:59] by your emotions or what you think of
[51:02] what you feel is going to always tell
[51:04] you the truth and what's right you got
[51:12] to eat it though Lord he is it Lord I
[51:18] want to think like you you can't think
[51:20] like God without feeding the Holy Ghost
[51:22] this word hallelujah if you don't
[51:26] understand something let me tell you
[51:27] something you know how God keep his
[51:30] people alive by feeding them himself I
[51:34] don't mean feeding him feeding you with
[51:38] the spoon he gives you himself he is the
[51:43] only truth life Emma you understand me
[51:49] because you remember him in this bread
[51:51] and I'm Way off my nose but I'm a
[51:53] preacher like he wants me to preach it
[51:54] with this bread we're talking about he
[51:57] says now listen what he did there it was
[51:59] some karna bread he gave there in the
[52:00] wilderness did he help them any then
[52:03] they did when the murmurings lessened
[52:06] no it was increased ha because they
[52:10] didn't know what it was and there are so
[52:16] many people
[52:17] with the Holy Ghost but we'll never be
[52:19] effective really to you until you know
[52:21] what it is it's not a thing it's a
[52:25] person it is God it is your life it is
[52:29] what you are to become is that right you
[52:35] got to know that this manner is not a
[52:38] thing it's God that's why Jesus said to
[52:42] them except you eat my flesh whoo let's
[52:48] say the Word of God is the flesh of God
[52:50] this you got to read it that right
[52:53] John took God told John danger told John
[52:56] eat the whole book hmm I appreciate my
[53:01] sister over there she she said I just
[53:02] finished the whole Bible and I praise
[53:04] the Lord there's so many Christians they
[53:06] never read it all I'll let it be huh and
[53:10] we need to read him from A to Z little
[53:13] by little you don't have to read a book
[53:15] a day read as you you know your ability
[53:20] to read just read a little bit at a time
[53:22] but it ought to be an objective for you
[53:25] this year to finish the whole book oh my
[53:28] god and we you know we look at this
[53:30] thing you said well it's because you
[53:32] don't understand and I hate this day and
[53:35] I'm not trying to belittle anybody my
[53:36] point is there's so many people in this
[53:38] message who's never read that sure
[53:40] changes hello the church ages is so
[53:43] essential to the very seven seals if it
[53:48] wasn't so God would not have given it to
[53:50] you if it wasn't so God would not have
[53:53] indicated he would not have come down in
[53:55] jeffersonville tabernacle and write like
[53:58] a man on the wall he did that to
[54:02] vindicate how important it is for the
[54:05] bride to make yourself ready
[54:07] ah otherwise you allowing yourself to be
[54:12] vulnerable to leavening that's what
[54:16] happens in the message people don't
[54:18] fully get it they don't read it they
[54:19] don't study they don't look into it and
[54:21] then here comes some kind of preacher
[54:22] trying to make himself something ain't
[54:25] no great preachers in this message
[54:28] there's only
[54:30] Lord hallelujah y'all can say Amen if
[54:35] you like but my point is this amen I
[54:39] refuse and this is what I'm saying I
[54:42] said this down in Iowa City one of the
[54:44] greatest problems of the message is
[54:49] gossip
[54:51] backbiting telling lies you know even
[54:57] the Word of God said you and I as a
[54:59] believer should never believe a false
[55:02] report about a preacher don't let nobody
[55:07] tell you a lie about an elder without a
[55:10] witness I don't care how real it seemed
[55:14] you must understand the Satan he is a
[55:18] deceiver and his whole purpose is to get
[55:21] you tangled up in something that's not
[55:24] right you understand me hello God knows
[55:36] Satan spirit and Satan is how can I say
[55:43] it some people call
[55:47] a creeper cuz he me moved slowly hmm you
[55:53] don't know how gossip starts beautiful
[55:56] he might say I lose something like
[55:58] throwing out a hook and then you you
[56:01] won't respond in there throw something
[56:03] else out at you and then you're like oh
[56:04] you got you now there it goes now I want
[56:10] you to understand by God's grace that
[56:12] when Jesus and that's how come Jesus
[56:14] became a devil to a lot of people
[56:15] because of gossip did you know that oh
[56:18] we heard that your mama and your daddy
[56:23] right Mary and Joseph produced you you
[56:26] were born in fornication we heard right
[56:29] here was Jesus a grown man and that lie
[56:32] was still going on and wasn't even true
[56:35] wasn't true huh let me go on now he said
[56:39] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[56:41] as it is written he gave them bread from
[56:43] heaven to eat and jesus said unto them
[56:45] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[56:49] you not the bread from heaven but my
[56:51] father giveth you the true bread from
[56:53] heaven in other words God sit down these
[56:56] natural things angel food
[56:57] it was sweet to the taste and it still
[57:02] wasn't enough is that right
[57:05] they said I'm tired of this man now I
[57:07] never get tired of God I could never get
[57:10] tired of his word
[57:12] hallelujah you know that's what happened
[57:15] actually I couldn't be married to
[57:16] another girl when I was in
[57:18] denominational this one girl that you
[57:20] know ain't gonna call her name
[57:21] you know Noah but still yet I was really
[57:25] in fact waiting with this girl and I
[57:27] thought oh she's so pretty oh ma and you
[57:30] know she can shout and she can sing and
[57:31] she can dance and oh look at their own
[57:36] thing one day in a Wednesday night
[57:39] service amen she gets up and she leaves
[57:42] outside I guess she wanted me to follow
[57:45] that wasn't gonna happen so I asked her
[57:49] and she did not even know brother
[57:51] brother reached I was a day or two away
[57:53] from asking her would she marry me mmm
[57:56] you know what she said to me so why did
[57:59] you go outside like that
[58:00] you stayed the whole time she said it
[58:02] got boring I extra out check it however
[58:07] you want to say it erased it deleted it
[58:12] my heart was hurting but I knew I could
[58:15] never marry a girl who thought the word
[58:19] was boring you know I could care less if
[58:23] they came by somebody who stuttered I
[58:25] stand right there and wait till he
[58:26] finish as long as it's the Word of God
[58:30] but people wants to be entertained and
[58:33] that's the problem with the message now
[58:35] we have entered into the entertainment
[58:37] arena
[58:38] you can't even joy God and that's how
[58:40] preachers preaching and doing all of
[58:42] that Jesus didn't do it so where's the
[58:46] lemon coming from and separately and
[58:49] have a list of things that he need to
[58:51] bring before he brings his finer point
[58:53] so everybody can jump and shout that's
[58:56] not the Lord that's Hollywood and when
[59:00] it's all said and done how do you feel
[59:03] do you feel strengthened do you feel
[59:06] like I'm leaving out here and I can
[59:08] conquer there like Goliath hallelujah do
[59:11] you feel like a man that when it is all
[59:14] said and done I've got something in me
[59:15] that could sustain me coz bread makes
[59:18] you feel for hmm am i I'm okay see we're
[59:25] coming into another year we can't enter
[59:28] into another year with the same mindset
[59:30] we had this year and expect to improve
[59:34] expect to be higher and to go closer to
[59:37] God right we can't do it and we feel
[59:41] like oh this is a religion then and I
[59:43] don't halfway believe it anyway but I'm
[59:45] a fake until I make it
[59:46] well you're gonna drop off down the road
[59:49] that won't work with the pressure that's
[59:51] coming hmm but some have to drop off you
[59:55] know it's written now we look at this
[59:57] thing he says listen let me move on by
[1:00:00] the grace of God you love the Lord the
[1:00:02] word of the Lord is in turn eternal
[1:00:04] because what happens is they walking to
[1:00:06] Emmaus it goes on now their hearts are
[1:00:09] burning and God they see something is
[1:00:11] happening here but I don't know exactly
[1:00:12] what it is they didn't record
[1:00:17] but one thing for sure when he got ready
[1:00:19] to leave and that's what brother Baron
[1:00:21] said God when they owned on incomes
[1:00:23] sometimes in the server's are upon you
[1:00:25] God will act like he want to leave
[1:00:27] sometimes you know what I'm saying you
[1:00:29] get out of your knees the power of God
[1:00:30] is there they love her it suddenly lifts
[1:00:32] but God wants to know how much you want
[1:00:35] him to remain you'd get up and said well
[1:00:38] my prayers over Oh beg him Lord plead
[1:00:43] with him stay with me a little while
[1:00:45] longer because if he stay with you a
[1:00:47] little while longer he's gonna break
[1:00:49] some bread he's gonna give you a
[1:00:50] revelation that you never seen before
[1:00:52] because that's exactly what he did to on
[1:00:54] the road to emmaus when they got there
[1:00:56] they stayed let have dinner Nina gets
[1:00:59] the bread and he breaks it then the
[1:01:00] Bible says then they ask for my god they
[1:01:05] didn't even hesitate let's let's sleep
[1:01:07] the night through no sir the Bible said
[1:01:09] let's go back to the others and tell
[1:01:11] them what we've seen but it calls the
[1:01:14] spirit when God reveals to you who he is
[1:01:17] and that he's really alive and well you
[1:01:21] gotta know this you must know this
[1:01:23] because the president is coming and if
[1:01:26] God is just a book reading to you you're
[1:01:29] gonna miss you're gonna go you gonna
[1:01:31] come short this Bible must live he he's
[1:01:35] living he talks
[1:01:38] yeah I'm sure everybody knows that God
[1:01:41] talks to me every day every day and you
[1:01:47] and I must know that that God wants to
[1:01:53] talk to you but sometimes we're so busy
[1:01:54] we can't hear him right we was coming
[1:01:58] down my son-in-law was coming down the
[1:02:00] church this morning I had my blinker
[1:02:01] light on I didn't hear it I had a thing
[1:02:05] over my ear and you know it was just
[1:02:08] covered my ears were covered with
[1:02:12] something man-made
[1:02:14] but he heard it because he didn't have
[1:02:17] nothing over his ears and I think that's
[1:02:19] what happens we come to the church and
[1:02:21] we've got these man-made thoughts in our
[1:02:23] minds and you know what it clogs up your
[1:02:25] hearing and when God comes you can't
[1:02:27] even hear it
[1:02:28] you're not in this spirit because you've
[1:02:29] been rushing and fussing and everything
[1:02:31] else and you get in the spirit at the
[1:02:33] end of the service and the message is
[1:02:34] over may God help us this morning
[1:02:39] amen to know that this bread is real the
[1:02:41] world is real and just like the Bible
[1:02:43] said oh my god it must not have any
[1:02:47] leavening why do you think God commands
[1:02:50] us to confess and make things right
[1:02:52] because that little Lebanon will puff
[1:02:56] your flesh it will alter who you really
[1:03:01] are y'all love that and we don't need no
[1:03:05] alteration if we do we need a
[1:03:07] transformation let's put it that way
[1:03:09] hallelujah now you love the Lord it's
[1:03:11] eternal and Jesus proved to them the
[1:03:14] bread I am the bread and if I told you
[1:03:17] that you live and will not die I must
[1:03:19] show you that I live and cannot die so
[1:03:24] he didn't say well I'm gonna give you
[1:03:25] this and I'ma wait till you die so you
[1:03:27] can live no he proved that he was the
[1:03:30] resurrection and he is the resurrection
[1:03:33] hallelujah he was doing all he could
[1:03:35] give do to let them know because you've
[1:03:38] been feeding on me this is what you're
[1:03:41] going to get hallelujah don't you
[1:03:44] understand that's what Paul was so
[1:03:47] excited about dying he was excited
[1:03:51] he said all death where is your sting o
[1:03:54] grave where is your victory
[1:03:55] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:03:57] victory through our Lord and Savior
[1:03:59] Jesus Christ he understood I've been
[1:04:01] feeding on the bread I've been eating on
[1:04:03] the word and I passed from death unto
[1:04:06] life I cannot die anymore
[1:04:08] cry oh this is the part I like when
[1:04:12] Jesus had that loaf of bread all the
[1:04:16] pieces of that bread was from one loaf
[1:04:20] it was like a jigsaw puzzle there were
[1:04:25] no extra pieces every piece was
[1:04:28] important to make the picture perfect
[1:04:33] hallelujah I love it is nothing more
[1:04:36] discouraging when you have mastered a
[1:04:38] big puzzle and you come down to the last
[1:04:40] piece and you can't find it
[1:04:42] anybody know what I'm talking about a
[1:04:44] man especially when the pieces are small
[1:04:46] I hated those kind but I did them anyway
[1:04:49] it would take me time and time to get it
[1:04:52] but down the road we finally got in you
[1:04:54] oh but more like most of all there was
[1:04:57] nothing more discouraged when you
[1:04:58] couldn't find that last little piece and
[1:05:00] most of the time is in the middle
[1:05:02] somewhere where it could be sea mist or
[1:05:05] whatever see so but not with God there's
[1:05:08] only one brand I love it I'm loving
[1:05:11] these people because I know like like
[1:05:14] tonight we're gonna take communion I
[1:05:16] know more now with those one bread
[1:05:19] breaking off those pieces and in order
[1:05:22] to make it complete every piece must
[1:05:25] continue to exist you understand me
[1:05:31] and so what God does he says now he did
[1:05:34] oh so me and the piece become one me the
[1:05:40] bread and I we become one oh one bread
[1:05:42] one body and I'm part of it hallelujah
[1:05:45] the whole flow can be complete it cannot
[1:05:49] be complete without me it cannot be
[1:05:51] complete without you oh praise the Lord
[1:06:02] eternal life you mean to tell me just by
[1:06:06] partaking and eating this
[1:06:08] I have eternal life that's what he said
[1:06:12] mmm
[1:06:13] see I'm feeding something on the inside
[1:06:16] you know me I'm feeding something on the
[1:06:19] inside and one of my feet brother and
[1:06:20] said you must feed the Holy Ghost the
[1:06:23] word if you really want to grow in grace
[1:06:27] you got to feed it you got to give him
[1:06:30] muscles see because when he was born in
[1:06:33] you he was born like a baby the proper
[1:06:36] God said like Jesus was born in a manger
[1:06:40] may God be born in the manger of our
[1:06:43] hearts see
[1:06:46] when God was born in our hearts he born
[1:06:48] in a filthy place he had to clean up
[1:06:50] hallelujah
[1:06:51] Oh God is good to us he loved the Lord
[1:06:56] he feeds the hungry but watch this now
[1:06:59] because as it was then and I mama
[1:07:02] because of time I'm not gonna keep you
[1:07:04] much longer because of this realize that
[1:07:08] people are following the message because
[1:07:09] of the depth of the word and you hear
[1:07:11] that a lot right hello Jesus said you
[1:07:15] only follow me for the fish in the
[1:07:18] loaves see they want to impress you
[1:07:22] because they know the word and they can
[1:07:24] quote the word I want you to know that
[1:07:25] the devil can quote it better than any
[1:07:27] of us and won't even skip a beat but I
[1:07:31] don't care how much a man or is
[1:07:34] preaching this word if he's not getting
[1:07:35] into your personal life he's not really
[1:07:38] call because I'm gonna tell you
[1:07:41] something this message consists a bitter
[1:07:43] and sweet Oh correction
[1:07:48] be zealous to repeat that's your age
[1:07:51] when God called you he said be zealous
[1:07:54] to repent and this message came to
[1:08:00] hammer you say what to beat you to shape
[1:08:05] you to form you to get all this worldly
[1:08:07] stuff out of you so that God can see his
[1:08:10] reflection not yours not your image not
[1:08:13] my image his image that's the
[1:08:16] transformation it must be him
[1:08:19] transforming himself into you hallelujah
[1:08:24] am I wrong about this that's what Jesus
[1:08:27] said I don't do nothing except that's
[1:08:29] let's see the father doing it in other
[1:08:31] words I'm not here to get a name and to
[1:08:33] be glorified or to be honored he said
[1:08:35] I'm not even looking for your honor
[1:08:37] because my father are like me oh my
[1:08:42] hallelujah
[1:08:44] when we think about how God comes along
[1:08:47] and he feeds 5,000 right the Bible said
[1:08:52] he Fifi had only five loaves and two
[1:08:54] fish and he said bring him to me because
[1:08:57] be sure but they gonna stop Lord just a
[1:08:58] desolate place
[1:09:00] this age is desolate this is a desolate
[1:09:05] place and if God don't feed us we will
[1:09:08] die of hunger that's why I can't
[1:09:10] understand how people just miss church
[1:09:12] and miss search and expect for them not
[1:09:13] be hungry and expect for them not to be
[1:09:15] weak you gonna be weak you gonna be
[1:09:17] hungry and normally in your fall or
[1:09:19] faint because you miss your meal right
[1:09:25] and he says come together the more when
[1:09:27] you see that Day approaching and this is
[1:09:28] what I am trying to tell people you its
[1:09:31] obligated
[1:09:32] it's a commission it's almost like a
[1:09:35] command come together the law when you
[1:09:38] see that day approaching anybody see the
[1:09:40] day approaching if you can't see the
[1:09:43] rapture in view something's wrong with
[1:09:44] you if you can't see that this America
[1:09:47] is getting ready to go up in flames
[1:09:49] something's wrong with you not just
[1:09:51] America the whole world don't you
[1:09:53] understand if in the brother branham
[1:09:55] didn't say which would go out whether he
[1:09:57] said he said one bomb won't drop before
[1:09:59] we you know the rapture but he didn't
[1:10:01] say that that California won't drop off
[1:10:03] the map before we leave he didn't say
[1:10:07] that he left that just like California
[1:10:09] gonna sing hmm don't you know California
[1:10:17] sink what is going to do people why do
[1:10:19] you think that these audience is now
[1:10:22] melting the ice what were you thinking
[1:10:24] brother Brahim said even even Isaiah
[1:10:26] said it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna
[1:10:28] wobble and tartar like a drunkard
[1:10:30] there's gonna be a polar shift now you
[1:10:33] don't have to believe that but it will
[1:10:35] be it's been before
[1:10:42] Lansdale
[1:10:43] beneath Capernaum Pompeii and all these
[1:10:50] other places that underneath the ocean
[1:10:52] they're gonna rise where the balance a
[1:10:55] Florida would sink England would sink in
[1:10:58] the water you know they are even with
[1:11:01] the geologists now geologists and now
[1:11:04] mapping out the land that's going to be
[1:11:06] to remain with that will remain when all
[1:11:09] of this stuff happens they call it
[1:11:11] global warming I don't know what it is
[1:11:12] all I know is that the Word of God will
[1:11:15] be fulfilled and it doesn't matter how
[1:11:17] it's done it's gonna be done so you sure
[1:11:20] what brother was where is that gonna
[1:11:21] leave us huh I'm trusting we'll leave
[1:11:27] before the earthquake that's all I'm
[1:11:30] saying
[1:11:31] I'm just trying to give you a visual
[1:11:32] mind I don't know exactly how it's going
[1:11:34] to be but I tell you what it's gonna be
[1:11:36] ugly
[1:11:38] hello it's gonna be ugly and if that
[1:11:41] brothers dream who had that dream in
[1:11:43] 1933 if he's accurate and I really
[1:11:46] believe that dream was accurate because
[1:11:47] during that time there was no baby cars
[1:11:49] during that time there was no men
[1:11:52] wearing earrings huh
[1:11:54] you understand me if you've never heard
[1:11:56] read that dream it's good thing you go
[1:11:57] look it up the dream of 33 histories but
[1:12:00] my point is if this be of God it was not
[1:12:03] we know that this I was telling the
[1:12:06] church the other day trump means war
[1:12:08] ruler and then you got Jared amen which
[1:12:11] means to this thing and you you know the
[1:12:14] Lord shall descend with the Trump that
[1:12:17] means have been God is placed even in
[1:12:19] our white house a dissension and a trump
[1:12:26] right in our faces a sign a little piece
[1:12:31] of nugget to let us know how close it is
[1:12:34] will it be during this time it sounds
[1:12:37] like it may be but we know that Trump
[1:12:41] with what he did with Israel has caused
[1:12:44] a disturbance a political starburns it's
[1:12:47] actually busting up at you in religious
[1:12:53] disturbance because the Pope then jumped
[1:12:57] into it now y'all understand what I'm
[1:13:01] saying but let me tell you what
[1:13:02] Jerusalem will always be the capital
[1:13:05] Rome will never be the capital even
[1:13:08] though it would take God to bring her
[1:13:10] down y'all better wake up and smell the
[1:13:14] coffee let they say uh-huh
[1:13:17] what is leavening and I'm almost done
[1:13:19] with this portion I just have to finish
[1:13:21] the rest tonight learning is a substance
[1:13:24] or as a yeast or baking powder that's
[1:13:26] causes from fermentation and expansion
[1:13:30] of dough and batter
[1:13:31] you see that's why we don't do grape
[1:13:33] juice grape juice can firm in and be
[1:13:36] bitter and God is not bitter he's sweet
[1:13:41] hallelujah that's why our wine is not a
[1:13:45] bit of line it's a sweet wine hallelujah
[1:13:49] come on somebody amen and remember when
[1:13:52] Jesus was doing the bread and wine he
[1:13:56] said don't leave nothing eat it all
[1:13:58] drink it all right because this is me I
[1:14:02] don't want you to leave not one jot or
[1:14:04] tittle left eat it all and that's how it
[1:14:08] is we must eat the whole look I said
[1:14:12] Lord how do we eat the hope of death as
[1:14:14] some of us may not even be able to read
[1:14:16] he said but listen I am the book I am
[1:14:21] the bread I am the word and if you get
[1:14:25] sealed with the Holy Ghost that is the
[1:14:27] whole book ah you love the Lord man
[1:14:34] should not live by bread alone but by
[1:14:35] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:14:37] mouth of God let me get you that one
[1:14:38] scripture and I'll let you go for
[1:14:39] tonight
[1:14:40] I believe it's st. John 16 No yeah 16 25
[1:14:48] to 33 will read that will let you go I
[1:14:51] am that bread this bread is the Lord
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ and understand that's why
[1:14:58] the scripture says if we are baptized
[1:15:00] into him remember said that's why the
[1:15:03] death angel can pass because he can't
[1:15:06] see you because you are
[1:15:07] him you are in Christ and that word
[1:15:09] Christ is anointed world I'm saved and
[1:15:12] you ain't got no an aunty anointing is
[1:15:17] the word it is Christ God don't have
[1:15:21] says oh I'm Christ and here's some
[1:15:24] anointing he is the anointing he is the
[1:15:29] one that were braked listen when you get
[1:15:31] joy in your heart folks who you think
[1:15:34] putting it there when faith comes in
[1:15:38] your heart and you have an assurance
[1:15:40] don't you understand God is the one that
[1:15:42] placed it there you think about it that
[1:15:50] Pool of Bethesda and all those people
[1:15:52] used to come and according to history
[1:15:53] some folks would even fight and try to
[1:15:55] kill each other to see how and who would
[1:15:57] get in there there first and here was a
[1:15:59] crippled man and Jesus about passed all
[1:16:01] of them think about it
[1:16:04] he wasn't mistaken he he didn't get the
[1:16:06] wrong orders there was one man God saw
[1:16:09] and his favor went to that one man and
[1:16:14] he was not even the worst at the cool I

[1:21:05] the doctors told him and his wife by way
[1:21:08] of examining her that she had a
[1:21:10] condition that she couldn't have any
[1:21:12] children so I recommended them some
[1:21:15] stuffing and and but she wouldn't take

[1:21:59] down huh okay good
[1:22:01] I'm glad to see it but my point is
[1:22:04] people when you take God at His Word
[1:22:05] don't look at circumstances
[1:22:07] well circumstances got to do with the
[1:22:10] promise of God now what you're going to
[1:22:14] do when if you should die and in God
[1:22:16] take 10 years to come back and you land
[1:22:18] up in that grave I'll ride it up with
[1:22:20] bones and everything you got to know you
[1:22:22] coming up out of there now if you can
[1:22:25] believe that you should be able to
[1:22:26] believe anything else cuz circumstances
[1:22:29] while you and the grave said there's no
[1:22:30] way just thinking what about those
[1:22:35] people that was there thousands of years
[1:22:37] into somebody said well they found the
[1:22:40] tomb of Joseph I say they must have
[1:22:41] found his writings that this was it
[1:22:43] because he wasn't there ain't gonna tell
[1:22:46] you that the jaws of a in the - y'all
[1:22:50] know that Joseph got up when Jesus got
[1:22:53] up hallelujah
[1:22:55] they could find whatever they find my
[1:22:58] Josephine is an empty tomb
[1:23:04] glory to God I'm feeling good why
[1:23:06] because Joseph dim ate off the rear
[1:23:09] breathe while all means of people was
[1:23:14] eating off the natural bread that came
[1:23:16] down that wonderful praise the Lord
[1:23:19] sweet nice hallelujah Joseph was seeing
[1:23:23] they excuse me I'm talking about Joshua
[1:23:25] now I'm sorry but Joshua was seeing
[1:23:27] something greater and Joseph was -
[1:23:30] Joseph knew he was packed with a dream
[1:23:32] in that vision being a property knew was
[1:23:35] going to come to pass even though he did
[1:23:36] not know how and where and when it was
[1:23:39] all said and done and God opened the
[1:23:41] curtains for Joseph Joseph realize oh my
[1:23:43] god
[1:23:45] the very thing I saw as a dream the
[1:23:47] thing I told my mom and my daddy and
[1:23:48] then they got mad with me and now here
[1:23:51] we are they're bowing before me the
[1:23:53] purpose is to save Israel hmm
[1:24:00] because he ain't after living less than
[1:24:12] you know I I know we all strong we all
[1:24:16] have our little things that we want God
[1:24:17] to overcome help us overcome I'm
[1:24:23] pressing and what I when I mean pressing
[1:24:28] is I'm learning to yield
[1:24:32] he's depressor I'm the yield er I'm
[1:24:36] learning to yield to God because you got
[1:24:42] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're going
[1:24:43] in the rapture you've saved hello
[1:24:48] you saved but only the statue of a
[1:24:51] perfect man that person who've come to a
[1:24:54] perfect statue in Christ
[1:24:55] listen go listen to it I'm not saying my
[1:24:58] words it's something I missed for a long
[1:24:59] time go go look at it and that's what
[1:25:01] the devil is messing with us oh I got
[1:25:03] the Holy Ghost he said that's what
[1:25:05] happened to the children in the
[1:25:06] wilderness they were justified they were
[1:25:09] sanctified and they wouldn't cross over
[1:25:12] that's what happened to Judas he was
[1:25:14] justified he was sanctified and they
[1:25:15] wouldn't cross over you've got to have
[1:25:18] Christ listen a hope the Bible said that
[1:25:21] whole creation waited for the
[1:25:24] manifestations of the sons of God if
[1:25:27] that had already been completed we would
[1:25:30] be called but God has a crowning jewel
[1:25:33] and that's his bride and she will come
[1:25:38] to maturity she will a man be able
[1:25:41] people Oh are we gonna speak things and
[1:25:44] there's this we are those who all come
[1:25:46] to a maturity because God is not going
[1:25:48] to handle give his word to a child
[1:25:50] Solomon said I've come for a full-grown
[1:25:53] woman I don't want no baby I won't
[1:25:56] I want everything developed hmm I'm no

[1:26:09] your goodness we thank you for your
[1:26:11] mercy Lord is so good and rich to me may
[1:26:15] be simple but it's so rich to me because
[1:26:18] I see what you're doing and I see by
[1:26:21] your grace or God what you were you're
[1:26:23] bringing us - there's so many Lord God
[1:26:26] that's just oh god you know the
[1:26:28] conditions but father only you know the
[1:26:31] hearts of us all and I pray father God
[1:26:33] if our hearts are not in the right
[1:26:36] places that you would do something to
[1:26:37] change them now father forgive us and
[1:26:40] cleanse us from all our sins Lord change
[1:26:44] us from glory to glory like Paul said
[1:26:46] we're changed from glory to glory from
[1:26:50] faith all the way up to a divine nature
[1:26:54] Christ
[1:26:55] well you said Lord will not be failed
[1:26:58] fall and won't be a failure when it
[1:27:01] comes to bringing forth fruit help us

[1:27:18] time becomes now in Lord I believe what
[1:27:21] I heard you speak the time is now and
[1:27:24] we're going to prepare ourselves the
[1:27:26] time otherwise Lord we could be spewed
[1:27:33] just like all the other ages there are
[1:27:36] those who won't make it all Lutheran's
[1:27:39] didn't make it
[1:27:40] all Westlands didn't make it throughout
[1:27:43] all the ages they were always somebody
[1:27:46] who heard but because of their unbelief
[1:27:48] and because of their dilatory
[1:27:51] slothfulness they didn't make it I pray
[1:27:54] father God that that you blessed us and
[1:27:57] have mercy upon everyone that's here
[1:27:59] this morning that you'll do something in
[1:28:02] their souls do something and take the
[1:28:04] carnality away from them father may they
[1:28:07] see the lateness of the hour help us now
[1:28:12] because you said in your word many will
[1:28:15] lose out because of the cares of this
