praise the lord thank you for that amen as our brother troy amen let's pull on the gift amen we all have a we all have a gift and sometimes your gift is to pull on the gift amen amen [Music] amen god is so good oh god [Music] is [Music] has it been good to saints amen that's been my experience hey man it's been that way my entire life my god has been good to me amen we all have those testimonies things as we look down through our lives the things that god has done for us and it just causes us to stop and think and realize catch the revelation that our god has placed our lives in his hands amen and no matter what we go through through this life's journey we can have that confidence to know that that god will be with us everywhere we go i know i've referred often to that quote where brother branham said he was discouraged about something or he is a little down about something and something was going on and i don't recall exactly what it was but when he was in a room and all of a sudden the real sweet presence came into the room and he said he heard that voice coming and he says and that's the sweetest voice you could ever hear said to him the never failing presence of the lord jesus christ will be with you wherever you go don't you be afraid go anywhere or do anything for the never failing presence of the lord jesus christ is with you wherever you go and we think i said what a blessing is that brother branham has such a promise like that but jesus christ himself told us i will be with you even in you until the very end of the world amen so the promise to the messenger is not so much different it's the promise of those that receive the message amen we are here the ones that are holding on to that message amen the messenger was sent for a people and we are that people so take courage saints you know no matter where you get to in your life's journey sometimes we get to the places where we get a little down or a little discouraged about things you know we know that our flesh is capable of getting to those places but there is something on the inside of us that rises up that no matter how our body feels no matter how the state of our mind is there is a spirit deep down on the inside that knows that we are the children of the most high god that knows that we were chosen before the foundation of the world that knows that that no matter what our body declines or what our mind declares that we are in the hands of the almighty god and that one of these days this body is going to melt away one of these days this this mind will will this faulty mind will disappear and we'll be given a new mind and a new body amen that'll be like his glorious body because in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we will be changed and the things that are fallen will melt away to the things that are immoral amen i'm looking forward to that day saints i enjoy the mountains i enjoy the hills i enjoy the the scenery and the thing and but then when the realization comes that the god that created all those things that we enjoy has also said i have gone to prepare a place just for you and if i go i'll come back and receive you to myself and i'll say entering into the joys of the lord and the one that created all these things down here that we enjoy has already created a place for us with you in his mind amen because he knows the things that we enjoy in this life amen let's just stand in honor of the word of the lord i want to turn to john chapter 4. i speak a message this morning called the fountain of living waters john chapter 4 start there where the woman at the well is speaking in verse 9. and it says then said the woman of samaria unto him how is it thou that being a jew ask a strength of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans jesus answered and said to her if thou knewest the gift of god who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee living water amen let's just stop right there by our heads of word of prayer heavenly father we just approach unto you this morning lord knowing that you are the great god you are the same one lord that was walking through the time of their pla the geography of samaria and you stopped at that old well that was called jacob's well and they've been drinking from it from a long but that one day you came there and you spoke to that woman and said woman give me the drink and lord and we respond you knew exactly what you were going to say in response to her and lord and so is it this morning lord that you know exactly what you are to say to this people father lord i just as i lay myself down lord and open my heart lord to the people father i pray lord as the people open their hearts to you lord i pray that we all as one body lord right now in the name of jesus christ would receive from you and lord as we dedicate ourselves as christians of the most high god the bride of christ lord we pray lord come into this place lord and have thine own way in the service this morning that when we leave this place that your bride might say surely it was good that we went to the house of the lord this morning for our god has spoken to us our god has met us at our point of need our god is to our cry our god has met the needs of the hour and lord we know that you already have done it so we just submit ourselves unto you lord and ha tell you lord have thine own way with us this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen this woman here the samaritan is it yo they grew up in that land there and they were constantly being told by the pharisees and the sadducees that they really had no right that your dna would not testify that you belong here but you know jesus christ has a different outtake on things there's always those people in any church or or don't have that natural uh confidence in themselves where they uh just lack that self-confidence in who they are you know and as the samaritans grew up in a land welcome when you read the history of it you realize that they really didn't have much of a foundation for their doctrines but yet there is still that chance that little bit of a glimmer of hope that the god of the heavens could look upon them and listen to their cries she said how is it that he's out being a jew would ask drink of me a woman of samaria from samaritan you know the jews don't think much of us they won't eat in our houses if we offer a drink they would throw it on the ground why is it that you're asking me of a drink and jesus looked at her and he answered he said if you knew the gift of god amen you would ask me for a drink i have a drink to give you the water that i give you will cause you so you will never thirst again if you have asked me if you knew who i was you have asked me and i will have given you living water of people that didn't really have much of an expectation you know just a couple generations before ruth came on the scene [Music] but she herself was a moabitus and when the uh the drought came and hard times came in the land of israel the moment israel that they left israel behind it and went to land that was not part of the promise and it was there the only link she had to the land of promise was her husband but her husband died and she lost that that link shall and you count down their generations 10 generations they still say you have no hope of the promise there's nothing in here that can inspire confidence that she has any right to jehovah no nothing that could really give her any confidence of where she stood called recall that boaz was threshing there late one night in the threshing floor he got tired he laid himself down to sleep and when he woke up [Music] he was surprised because there was a woman laying at his feet he died and you know as his mind went you know he knows that she is moabite he knows she's not part of the promise in reality she's part of the curse the moabites wouldn't give food and water to moses but yeah here is this woman and she says but i have uh she said just spread your garment over me if you had just spread your garment over me i have one hope of the promise one hope to enter into this promised land my husband who is the one that inherited the promise he's the one that died and you being his relatives boss yes boys something came into his mind he spread his garment and then as she went out she went and spoke to her mother-in-law your mother-in-law says don't you worry you will not rest he is accomplished you know we are a people called the gentiles how could we ever how could we ever have any hope of having any type of an inheritance but if we research back a little bit further messi regarding and we go we know that the only hope that we have it's as if the hero just spread his garment over us and we until he has accomplished everything where the boaz said it was d there is a closer uh a closer relative to you than me yeah um the bride of christ saint paul said look at who god has chosen amongst your ranks not many mighty men not many strong man there's not many rich men among you but god has chosen the weak things of the world the foolish things of the world people that has chosen those people why because the the rich and the mighty of this world the devil himself the spiritual in high and mighty places or the wickedness in high mighty places i've looked at us and said no regarding we don't want you the devil is a the closer relative but when he but when he looked at us and he said i don't want them because we had this link through our husband i went back before the foundation of the world so when satan rejected jesus christ god sent him to the world to the earth satan influenced them on the earth to pick him up and put him back up in the heavens when when the men of the earth did that they not only rejected christ by putting him on the cross they rejected us as well and the only link that we have to the promise is to lay at the feet of boaz lay at the feet of christ say lord spread your skirt over us spread your garment over us lay your holy spirit upon us what's your holy ghost jesus said if we knew the gift of god we would leave the moabite laying behind you if we knew the gift of god we would uh speak to our mother-in-law take my god knows that but it was one a woman of the cursed land of moab could i enter into land for 10 generations but there is something down inside of her heart that went back before the curse that the curse could have no effect on her oh you know the curse might have have had its way with this with this body of ours with this mind of ours we struggle with temptations there is something down on the inside of us way back before the foundation of the world it's at that hope it's that chance to say that no matter what our mind tells us no matter what our body tells us that we have [Music] if you only knew the gift of god if you only knew it could catch the revelation of who you are you would run crying out to him lord give me a drink of the world rejected them when they rejected christ when i stood up when christ was rejected she was rejected and because she was known by my name on the earth when she received my name when she stood up in the midst of persecution and claimed the name of christ and raised her hand and said i received the blood of the lord jesus christ the sacrifice for my sins when she went down to the waters of baptism i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ when she came up and walked in newness of life and uh the afflictions of the flesh the sins of this mind could spoke to adam there in the garden of eden and said that the ground is cursed for your sake when you put your seeds in the ground and hope for a garden to spring up it'll bear thorns and thistles instead and the works of your hands will be cursed he took the crown of the fruits of the curse upon himself the fruits of our hands will be cursed amen why he took the curse upon himself the curse of death the curse of our labors the curse of the sweat of our brown if you only knew the gift of god you would lay yourself with your feet and say lord spread your skirt over me let your holy spirit be upon me i've been called by your name been baptized in your name i've received your name upon my forehead and now i have need for you to answer the works of my hands are failing elizabeth now i need uh the the the the relative the only one that would claim me the only one that would speak for me the only one never come for me we are living in a day of the restoration of all things that's a powerful time to live in jesus told his disciples have agonized and dreamed and wanted and desire to look upon this day there's kings and prophets that wish they could have lived in this day and see the things that you see [Music] the prophet and there are many men in the 1700s they were agonizing in prayer over candlelight of the book of revelations martin luther martin luther and john wesley desire to see these things see these days even though it was in azusa street i saw the restoration many mighty men in the church that wish the desire that labored and didn't get to see the fruits of their labor dome but we're living in a day at the end will be torn apart because the love of christ has left the people the nation no longer be uh uh do unto others as you'd have them do unto you the basic decency of the gospel has left the land and because they rejected the holy ghost they rejected their only chance at peace and prosperity it's like brother graham says like a boy whistling to the graveyard you know you're scared going to the graveyard at midnight trying to whistle to make yourself feel better [Music] you know you're scared and so is this world they're running scared they they're they're afraid they don't know what the next uh problem will be the problem we'll have terrorist attacks one year the next year we'll have wildfires new orleans well right now drinking water a new orleans des moines has run out of drinking water back in 93. most of texas is out drinking water but jesus said if you knew who you are speaking [Music] go meet the bridegroom but the anointing doesn't come to it at all and the day will come all over this land don't sit there when all of these plagues will no longer come year after year after year but they'll come day after day after that and men's hearts will begin failing for fear will no longer be just wildfires this year hurricanes the next year you see the trumpet but it'll be day after day after days and it will drive men to go back to the their intelligence will fail their science will fail their problems will be greater than their devices no problem their problems will be greater than their engineering their problems be greater than what the the the scientists and the engineers and the the mighty men can think of zombies brother brown says you could put a george washington and abraham lincoln in every city across the land if i come from america um george washington or album lincoln but it won't do any good if your lamp is empty matthew 25 come on my treatment tank there was 10 virgins they a position of greatness in position only so many were chosen for that purpose objective and these ten were called to shine light all the way to the wedding but as they all fell asleep become instituted they slumbered and they slept it it's certainty deposited that there and the reason they were wise the reason and so they wanted to make sure that they had another source of oil so that if their lamp if he was a long time incoming that no matter how long it was it took him to get there if their lamp should run out of oil that they already knew where to go to get more oil because they didn't know how long it would take for him to get there to be found doing exactly what they were called to do all the way to the wedding they picked up the word and they went to get it ready but where is that holy spirit now all of her abilities were there she had her wedding garment on the villa she had her word with her she could walk but when she went to take the flame to the lamp there was no holy ghost to make the word work there was no holy spirit when she'd leave through the pages there was it was just a dead letter to her she could no longer make it hers she couldn't find her name in the book anymore why because she didn't have that holy ghost and she looked the foolish versions looked to the wise virgins they said give us of your oil because our oil has ran out of water she said go to those that buy and sell i just have just enough for me for many years for many are called but few are chosen but if those that were called knew the gift of god that was before them they would cry out day or night give us of this oil lord that i know where to go to get a refilling [Music] to the how to get to the throne of god i used to pray like this you see there's a way to the throne of god somewhere around here i used to be able to connect with god in prayer no i don't quite remember how it's been so long since i've been in his presence it's been so long since i i had that experience with christ in prayer all my testimonies are now 10 years old if anything god's ever done for me i don't remember what it's like for god to give me a revelation of anything now i'm in a time of need and i don't remember how to get to the lord in prayer anymore it just seems like the way is hidden to me you know the bride of christ isn't supposed to be like that a wife a true bride has a sacred virtue that she must not defile and he said just like the uh bride so does the church dimension has a sacred the sacred duty a sacred duty to prayer on divorce to the word and to jesus christ and those must not be defiled all the way the same one that was crucified on calvary through your jesus the anointed one amen let's turn over to the book of hey guy chapter one alone it's the third to last book of the old testament i know i preached on this a long time ago but i just want to read the first six words the first six words say and i called for a drought hey you know that is such a small little bit of text sorry do you remember brother brandon i've always had that little story about the postage stamp you would read that's a little text they give the story about the boy who found the postage stamp in the attic that man turned around solar for uh ten thousand dollars it wasn't necessarily the paper papier was what was written on the paper these six words here it may not seem like much but you know where i work whenever you write a letter to a large audience you have to make sure that you're answering all the questions beforehand they have a little thing that you can go through to make sure you've written a thorough communication community and they call it the who what why where when how that's gonna be right is if you're if you could read through your email it's not much good to the person that you send it but when you apply that to this verse you say well who is it that is calling for this drought the one that stood there in john chapter 7 in the temple on the day of tabernacle tabernacles and cry out in the set if any man a thirst let him come to me and drink this the same one in john 4. if you knew the gift of god you would ask me for a drink or is he speaking to uh you know someone is trying to do them great no no he's speaking to his own children of israel you think well maybe they're uh living off or in babylon or in egypt somewhere where are they no they're living in the very promised land no evie they think well when what time what when is this happening you know is this happening when they're maybe this is during the time when they're uh have been in idolatry no they were living in a day of restoration [Music] 16 years before this verse they had been given a commandment leave babylon go back to jerusalem just go go back to your land go back to your god worship him truly here's some money here's some gold whatever it takes just go get it done but 16 years after they get back you get to the book of hager are you looking nothing's been built everybody's built their own houses in 16 themselves if get out of these denominations go and gather yourselves together serve the revealed word of the lord jesus christ miracles and signs and wonders just go and worship the god of your fathers go and worship the lord jesus christ and we get here and we gather together in this little church [Music] and people will say oh i just feel so dry it i is can't seem to pray anymore i don't enjoy reading my bible anymore oh are we having two services today i don't want to come to church anymore and all these different things and we get home and we don't even desire to do anything at home for christmas but of the holy spirit in your life the only thing that gives you a power to do anything that has eternal significance let me tell you saints there is not one thing that we have done that we are going to get rewarded for will only be rewarded for the things that we allow the holy spirit to do in our lives because we can gather all the money in the world all the things that bring you joy in this life we can gather all those things together and there are things in heaven that are more real than the things here on earth if you want to hear those words great is your reward my good and faithful servant you have to allow the holy spirit to work in your lives but if in this day of restoration where we've been given all things if in this day we drag our feet and refuse to allow the holy spirit to rebuild his temple in our hearts amen let's just stand up but we're not here to be that way [Music] what would he ever see in me what would the holy spirit ever see that would he'd have a desire to work in me [Music] well there's a greater promise it goes beyond being a gentile or laodicean being beyond being lukewarm and cold [Music] they'll be the wise virgins that when christ returns they'll be shining rightly ready to do anything that the holy spirit tells them to do [Music] just one little node one little nod from jesus christ they're out about their father's business so ought to be for the bride of christ [Music] is me what was me [Music] i'm a man of unclean lips i live in a land of people of perverseness [Music] but as you read further on down the chapter he got he got over that [Music] when jesus christ [Music] touched his [Music] [Music] the fire the holy ghost is upon him and he stood there right in the very throne room of god the holy spirit the pillar is moving by the spirit of the lord he rolls put his head [Music] just call me to do something lord i'll be about my father's business lord just one little nod lord i got a well-beaten path [Music] a well-beaten pass to the throne room [Music] your servant lord is reporting for duty [Music] i can only do what my father tells me to do i'm reporting for duty lord [Music] hear my lord send me we've had woes me long enough [Music] let [Music] and do whatever it is he tells you to do it he will speak to you amen let's just bow our heads and word prayer lord jesus we surrender our lives our hearts our means [Music] you've [Music] holy ghost in our life in our hearts and our souls let our whole being lord be filled with the holy ghost [Music] [Music] sanctify ourselves to be washed in the blood of the lamb and just stand up noon strength [Music] say hear my lord send me refill me with the holy ghost let me be that overcomer this day so that when you come i can [Music] by the power of the holy ghost [Music] prayer [Music] they say you know it's been a long time since i've had an experience my walk has become dry my mouth i have more in common with the foolish virgin than i do with the wise virgins [Music] [Music] knows they're connected with their savior [Music] every day [Music] amen [Music] with someone you're talking with someone someone's telling you something the saying is if you believe that person someone will say do you buy that do you buy what he's saying amen amen foolish virgin or the virgins went to buy oil amen brothers spoke to them amen i trust we believe amen praise the lord let's sing amen take me into the holy of holies [Music] take me in by the blood of the land [Music] here [Music] oh take me [Music] me [Music] holy [Music] touch my [Music] once lips [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen oh that i surrendered [Music] before you take control [Music] myself [Music] surrendered [Music] before you take control [Music] oh [Music] surrender [Music] oh [Music] myself once again [Music] oh [Music] myself and every
