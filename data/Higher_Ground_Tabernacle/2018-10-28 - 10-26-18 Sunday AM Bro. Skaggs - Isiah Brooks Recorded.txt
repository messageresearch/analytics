TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is the brother's wife she was setting somewhere back here in the end of the prayer service I she stood up and when she stood up I said I have never seen a pregnant lady come to be prayed for that's just what I seen I seen she was pregnant very heavy pregnant and I said oh well when she come up here she wasn't pregnant I said what and she prayed that she could bear a child so we're looking for that god bless you all very much we now to me it's hot so I was brother Isaac said I'm from up where it does get a little cooler and the brother here would told me this morning that it was a little too cold for him this morning and like my this is beautiful so I'm gonna take my jacket off if that's all right with everybody I'm very warm and you don't change anything for me just thank you brother thank you very much hey I'm not used to wearing a jacket anyway I I I'm not much of a preacher so where I go is is a lot of a lot of rough people and so if they see a person come in in a suit they immediately put up a wall you know and and I agree you're too good for us so I and anybody that knows me no I ain't good enough for anybody so we we thank God for His grace I would like to just say did I do something I probably did I don't know but I'd like to say you're very beautiful people very beautiful this morning I've always admired different colors and different and to me you know the brighter the color the better it is but you know some people don't like bright colors some people like my daughter she likes different I think they call it pastels or something different lighter colors and but maybe I'm getting old but the brighter it is the better it is I like the bright colors and and to me you're very bright this morning so god bless you all very much I always I'm nervous when I stand before God's people because you are God's people and it makes me to know that I answer for what I speak to you not to you I don't answer to you but I answered him because you belong to him and we sometimes get the idea that the minister is the big guy that is wrong the minister's the little guy minister means to do service and so the minister is the one doing service for you and so if we had servants in our home and a servant mistreated my wife that servant would answer to me and that's what the preacher is the preacher is the servant you are the wife you are the bride of Jesus Christ and so if the preacher mistreats you he will fix it and he knows how to fix things so I always get a little nervous so pray for me this morning that God's will will be done now we want to take a thought this morning from the message to the Laodicean Church age but we're going to take it in a little different way than what we normally would take it and we want to turn in our Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 and we're going read the 17th verse but there's four or three little words that I want to take out of there and we're going to read the whole verse but the three words that we're going to take out of there are right in the middle and they are and knowest not like I said we're going to read the whole verse but those three words are what we're going to speak on revelations 3 verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked let us pray Lord Jesus as we come to you this morning we're so grateful together with your people that are so great in your eyes Lord that you would become flesh and take their sin and their iniquity and take it upon you and pay that price to redeem them back to you Lord we counted an honor to speak to your relax Ord we ask you to speak the words that you would have us to hear in Jesus name we pray Amy you may be seated as I said this morning I want to take those words and knowest not and I don't want to take them in a way of as the whole scripture would say a rebuke but I want to take it in an uplifting this morning because we find so many times in our lives we go through things we don't know what we're going through and we get discouraged and we get down and we get and we think God why is this happening why is am I not a Christian am I so cold on God that even when I pray it's like he doesn't even hear me and we don't know what's going on and so but then after a while something breaks and we begin to see sunshine and we begin to feel God's presence come back into our heart and we take a moment we look back on this great trial that we came through and we understand it and we think man thank the Lord that was I was tough but God brought me through it and we didn't know what we were going through we didn't understand it we thought it was a darkness we thought it was a terrible time but it was really God's mercy and so we want to take just a a few things here in the scripture and show that this has happened many times before first place we want to turn is in the book of st. John chapter 1 and I the other day I I was using a grinder and the grinder slipped and went in and cut my thumb pretty bad so I'm being slow with my left hand today so excuse me but st. John chapter 1 verse 5 and see where that God Himself can come and people never know it but yet it's God verse 5 and the light shine ahthe in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not so I don't know if any of you have ever been in a place to where there's no light at all and you can take a light you can take a brightest light that you want and you shine that light and if there's nothing to stop that light you won't see that like it just shines through the darkness and it doesn't but if you take the smallest pebble or the smallest piece of paper and you stick it in that light you'll see why because the darkness cannot comprehend the light of God but you having something in you that will catch that light what's it do the light of God can shine through this dark country is country a city that is here and Edie they'll never see it God Himself they'll never see it but God made you in such a way that you might just be the tiniest little grain of sand but when it comes into that light where God is it will show up and if you're in total darkness that tiny little light draws attention no matter how small it is God puts you in that darkness for a reason because you're not the only one in that darkness you're not the only one in a place that seems like God isn't but God is there because that's the scripture and the light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not but that little something that's in you that'll be caught in that light now as long as it's outside of the light it won't reflect that light but you put it one time in that light what's it do it it it hits those like that projector turn that projector on we brother Isaac just a minute you'll see something on the wall here what you see here but where is it coming from it's coming from here but you don't see the light that's here to hear but if I put my hand in there you see what I'm saying there's light but you don't see that light until it hits something once it hits something then you can see the light that's why God put you in that dark place but you don't know it thank you thank you because you're what stops that light and lets people understand you're the light that's right Jesus said you are the light of the world you're a city that's set on a hill that's why you're in such a hard place that's why you're struggling so much is because God has a plan that in you there's something that will bring a certain part of light to the world he didn't put you in the world to just be a light and condemned the world jesus said I came not to condemn the world but he brings life to the world now let's let's take another place Hebrews chapter 13 and see something here Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 2 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares angels they didn't know they were entertaining an angel they thought it was just another human being they thought it was just somebody down on their luck they thought it perhaps was somebody just summoned for a ride so there's many things that were beginning to see according to the Word of God we don't know about something that God is trying to make happen in your life for the sake of somebody else so he lets a great darkness come on you he lets a great terrible thing happen to you so that you can reflect that light to somebody else you're the preacher I speak it you preach it how do you preach by your life every day we look here 2030 people I don't know but tomorrow each one of you will come in contact with more than this they will never hear what I speak but they will see this in you or they will see you toss this away you're the preacher so many times we do things we don't know what we're doing we know not what we're doing turn with me Hebrews 13 again the same chapter there and verse 16 but to do good and to communicate forget not what is communicate what does it mean when the scripture tells us to communicate that means if God has done something for me I tell this brother about it if God has done a great healing in my life I tell you about it if God has saved me I communicate to you that God has saved me just basically testifying telling what God has done for you that's what communicate means just read it again but to do good now we know what do good means means to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased you want to please God do good and tell what God has done for you God isn't just pleased he's well pleased sometimes those little tiny things we forget as he said don't forget to do this how many's forgot to do that yeah I see some hands and don't want to come up but they want to come up we're all guilty that's why the scripture says don't forget why because we didn't know sometimes we do things and we don't even know what we're doing one time tell a little story it's in the Bible of Peter and the people's had watched Jesus do many many miracles and that Jesus told him and said I'll meet you on the other side say get in the boat you guys go in the boat I'll walk so they got in the boat was going along and they was telling this things that Jesus had done and as they begin testifying and communicating and telling how God had healed and raised the dead and open blinded eyes and done all these things the devil listened the devil listens to your conversation as well as God and so as he listened it made him mad it made Satan mad he said I don't like people testify so I'm going to shut that testimony service down I'm gonna shut him up with a storm so he brings a great storm down through it begins rocking the boat making him they could testify him why because they were afraid they were going to die what about you when did you think you was going to die at some time when things were getting so bad it's happened it's happened in your life that's the time to testify so Jesus he knew what was going on and he was coming along and he watched the storm come up and the storm didn't faze him one bit and big old waves are rolling and coming in like that he just rolled right with them that rolled here coming wave right out him and he'd just go right up the way Eve and down the other side talk about a surfer he could surf but he didn't have to have a board he just walked on the water and so Peter and them got to looking and here come Jesus and they didn't know it was Jesus the very one that could save them they were afraid of him they thought he was a spirit they thought he was a ghost they thought he was something evil but it was their very Lord so many times that's what we do that's what we do the very God that we claim to serve comes in such a small little way that's so different than what we think we think that can't be God that's got to be something different because if it was God he would come in a great mighty way and just get it out for you know he just walks in quiet and so Peter it's like a whole man this is scary this is bad this is horrible not only we're about to die but here comes the Grim Reaper and what did Jesus say first thing to him hey hey hey hey it's me I am Jesus now they didn't believe him and Peter says lord if it's you if it's you now that's what the devil said to Jesus if you be the Lord if you be the Son of God but Peter had something in him that the devil didn't have in him there was nothing in the devil to believe but there was something in Peter to believe and so he said lord if it be you now Jesus knew what he was going to say and he said if it be you tell me to come out there where you're at that's not very smart is it he done was worried about dying in the storm and he says put me out of the only safe thing there is out at where there is no safety didn't make much sense does it did that bother Jesus no not at all they said come on they didn't still the waters he didn't and he won't for you either why because he wants you to know who he is once you know who he is then you begin to know who you are so the very one that was their Savior they didn't know now today we're in a great a great time we have had a great profit that has come in this day had he done mighty great things God did through him and I doubt if 1% of the world knew who that was and I doubt if 1% still knows who that was and if you look in his life it was at the times that was the absolute darkest it was the times when it was so troublesome that God was moving the most so look at you today look at you today we have around us hundreds of churches in Des Moines there's no difference between this church and any church there is in Des Moines none because God's not dealing with the church he's dealing with the individual that's the only way he deals so if you came here this morning to meet with God in this place you came to the wrong place you can only meet God through the shed blood of an innocent one in the days of Cain and Abel we see that they each built a church an altar and they each offered to God what they felt God wanted offered to God and they both had the rock set up for their little altar and Cain went and he took the toils of his hands the great beautiful plants and the vegetables and the flowers and the and the fruits and and and he laid him on his altar and offered them in sincerity to God it was just as sincere as Abel was and he prayed with his hands lifted to God and he said O God I give you the best that I have I offer it to you this day and over here on the other side another altar built exactly the same way and on it we find a little lamb bleeding bloody screaming not wanting to die it was a mess but God liked that offering let's come to today what are you offering to God are you offering your knowledge of this message are you saying to God I understand serpent seed I understand how God came in flesh and took my place I understand how that there is to be a great anointing in this day I understand how that a person can be born again without sensation and I go to church faithfully is that what's on your offering today or is your offering that little bloody gland there's no beauty in that there's no glory in that little lamb perhaps in myself I could stand and say oh but God I preached the gospel so greatly there's no glory there's glory for me in that but that's not what God is looking for he's looking for that little bloody land and as long as our offering is something besides that lamb will never reflect that light we cannot be a light in the darkness it'll be just like it is there's nothing to see but once we turn away from our understanding once we turn away from what we think is right once we get to the place and we say god I thought I knew it but I don't I can only turn to what you accomplished for me then the light comes on and we begin to reflect it why because it's the right offering to God a little girl one time in the Bible and she was a young girl and her mommy and her daddy had got killed and she was being raised as an orphan by her uncle and she struggled for years why did my daddy die why did my mommy have to be killed what happened what have I done that God would hate me so much that he would kill my mommy and my daddy she struggled her whole life like that and she was a very pretty young lady and she was maybe fifteen sixteen years old and a great decree from the king went through the land and said we are seeking the most beautiful young ladies there is and they sent certain messengers out to find these beautiful young ladies and these messengers would go through the land and they would start looking and no doubt there was many fathers and mothers who hid their beautiful children their beautiful daughters because they didn't want their daughters taken for the King and so these messengers were looking not only looking in the streets but they would come to your home and they would knock on your door they'd probably make up a story so they could come into your home and see if you had a beautiful daughter if you had a beautiful daughter a beautiful daughter was gone and so this young lady who had struggled her whole life wondering why God had taken her father and her mother found herself in that place as she was to be put before the king and looked upon to see if the King would make her the Queen and we're speaking of Esther in the Old Testament and she became the Queen she became the one who was right next to the king but if it hadn't been for those hard times in her life she wouldn't have been there if it hadn't have been for those dark moments when God took her father and her mother when God let great trouble come into her life and then later on she began to see another messenger came to her and said to her perhaps you were raised up for this very moment what about your life look in your life today maybe your family's gone that's talking to brother Isaac little earlier maybe you're fighting maybe your health is gone maybe your your mental faculties are gone whatever it is that you're in I don't know your situation but you know it you know what it is you'll be like the little lady suffering with her teeth so bad whatever your situation is right now maybe God has raised you up for this time there's many words that have to be fulfilled in this Bible one of them is you one of them is you I cannot do what you're called to do you can't do what I'm called to do so whatever darkest moment you're in right now God has put you in that dark moment so you can reflect that light the light does no good if it's light outside the Word of God will do no good if everybody is reflecting that light you have to be in a place where there is no light so you can reflect the light so whatever your circumstance is today no matter how little how big how dark if it's getting dark if it's a blackest you've ever seen God raised you up for this moment you are to be the light of the world I read a story there's a little short story yesterday some of you may have read it was on the internet of a ladies he was in a hurry she wanted to get somewhere real quick and there was a man in front of her driving going the speed limit going just right light turned yellow in front so he stopped and all it just made her so angry cuz she needed to get there and she was yelling and shaking her fist you know and you should have went through that light it was only yellow and and she was ranting and just screaming somebody tapped on a window and she looked it was a policeman policeman pulled her out of the car and arrested her took her to jail she's like oh and so about a couple hours later the policeman that arrested her came to the jail cell took her out of the jail cell and said ma'am I'm sorry said I arrested you on thinking something that was wrong he said I was right behind you when you was yelling and screaming at the person in front of you at the light and he said I looked at your car and he said on the bumper it said only believed Jesus and said follow me to my church and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he said when I seen you screaming and yelling like that I thought you had stolen the car so he arrested her her life wasn't speaking very well was it and I'm sure she learned a good lesson from that so today for you what has God puts you on the earth for he hasn't put you on the earth to be where it's always sunshiny and bright he puts you on the earth to be where there's darkness why because he knows what's in you he knows what's lays down there [Music] there's a purpose for this darkness that's around you there's a pertinence purpose for these struggles that you're going through remember the scripture says all things work together for good to them to love God and are called according to his purpose not your purpose his purpose what is a great struggle of a young man today every one of us older man can remember back to when we were young we all had the same struggle girls were men that struggle it's still there for a young man but maybe God has put you where you are so you can be a light to somebody else who's struggling what is a struggle for a young lady what is a stroke I've never been a young lady I've never had a desire to be a young lady I don't think I could live up to what a young lady has to live up to you know they have a greater reward than a man that's what it says if you got a greater reward and you've got a greater battle what is this struggle according to the scripture that great struggle is to be beautiful be noticed by men that's the struggle that's what the scripture says maybe God put you young ladies in this time when it is so easy to attract the attention of men maybe God puts you there to be a light to those who are struggling with that what about us older men what's the scripture say Paul tal and Timothy says and tell the older men to be patient I better get down just a little farther here but that's what the scripture says to be sober maybe God put us as an older person for that reason to be a help to someone who's struggling in that I've been many places around this country different churches and there's one thing that I find lacking in every church every church I've not only been the message churches I've been to denominational churches I've been to Catholic churches I've been to non-denominational churches I've been house meetings I've been hell on the street meetings campground meetings you name it but there's one thing lacking love love I would like for you to the next few moments as we're getting ready to close to just think back of three days this last three days of how that God put on your heart to go do something for somebody or to visit somebody or to pray for somebody and you didn't do it last three days in this congregation how much help could you have been maybe that person that God had laid on your heart was going through a great struggle and needed some help maybe they were going through a battle of as a young man fighting lust and doing all they could to turn it away and turn it away and if we would have listened to the Holy Spirit if we didn't note down and said oh God our young men that's struggling so hard what would have happened what would have happened the Spirit of God would have moved according to your prayer and went to that young man and gave him strength what about the young lady who was struggling so hard with looking at this dress that she knew was just not right but yet she wanted to so bad because she knew if she put that on then that boy over there would look and he would like it what if God laid on some of you older ladies heart to kneel down and pray but watch because at that very moment when God begins to speak to your heart to go do something Satan comes along and says but your children but your job but your hunting but your fishing but your your your car need to check the oil he'll give you some reason to not do what God wants you to do and you have to make a choice do I follow the leading of the Lord or do I follow the leading of Satan three days a stand or feet are you guilty maybe for such a time as this remember brother Brandon said only the true bride will have true love if there's one thing we could ask for today could we ask God to change this bitterness that's in our heart and reach out to those who are unlovable perhaps reach out to those who have hurt me have done something against me we should forgive and never let that bother us again but then we should reach through that one and pull them out because that's what Jesus Christ did for you that's what he did for me when I would spit in his face and caused him to be put on that cross what did he do he didn't just forgive me he came and searched me out and brought me back to him will you do that today will you take just a few moments and say god I've done this I didn't do it at the cross but I've done it to my brother to my sister and I've let them go knowing they're struggling I've quit praying for them I've quit trying to help I've quit trying to be there when they need someone and I've only thought of me what can I do for me as we bow our heads [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Lord Jesus we need you if you have found in your heart today that you have lost that love for each other and you just don't have the love of God towards each other would you just raise your hand to God and say God I'm sorry forgive me Lord for I have done this and I ask you to forgive me of that Lord Jesus [Music] may your grace come to eat heart under that hand Lord that was lifted to you my hand is up and Lord may we look past our own needs and see what you would have us to see Lord and may your love come in to our heart for you told us the world will know you're my disciples when you have love one for another and God we see this lacking and we confess are wrong to you this morning Lord and we ask you to forgive us and help us Lord from this day forth [Music] your love can be seen in us let us sing their song I love him I love him because he first loved me and if there is somebody who is still struggling perhaps need some help I would like prayer we will pray with you and before we are dismissed in fact we're going to do it right now well every one of you that raised your hand and said God I'm guilty of losing that love for my brother sister will you this week change that will you start praying for your brothers and sisters will you start visiting will you start comforting the scripture says if one be overtaken in a fault let him that is spiritual restore such a one not kick them out not throw them to the side but to bring them back how many times have I fallen and was so grateful for an a brother when a sister come along and said it's alright just get back on will you do that will you do that this week start that brother I don't know what it is let's sing it again breeze tree [Music] you know the blood is blood freeze three this is what I was I was lost and way down deep you see the swells are slave to my shirts fears will be whose walls are free to trust from every state route [Music] let's raise our hands now as we sing it once more if you need prayer discouragement or sickness for trouble whatever it is if you need prayer pray with you if no one needs prayer and I will turn it back to brother Isaac and service at three o'clock three o'clock this afternoon I'm very delighted to speak to the people of God it's very fun let us sing it once more and if you need prayer [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh amen thank you Lord amen I just wanna thank the Lord because this mandus this sermon was preached to us this morning before the service and our Bible study was on the same same thing that he went through so I just thank you the Lord it's the same Holy Ghost amen man we

amen amen we are in a battle amen but Lord put us there amen how he allowed us to be there lujah onward Christian soldiers [Music] onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before rights the royal master leads against the food [Music] [Music] like crowns and thorns made Parish kingpins rise and we but the Church of Jesus constants the church we had [Music]
