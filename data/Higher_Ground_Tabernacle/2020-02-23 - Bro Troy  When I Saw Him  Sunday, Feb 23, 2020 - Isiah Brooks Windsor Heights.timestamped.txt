[54:28] feet as though dead amen
[54:30] but yet but Christ didn't leave him

[54:37] though dead she fell down she repent of
[54:39] her since
[54:39] Amen she she the revelation struck her
[54:42] and she realized how great he was how
[54:45] marvelous he was she realizes his
[54:48] preeminence amen she roses his majesty
[54:52] his glory was revealed to her she began
[54:54] to realize how what the Bible wasn't a
[54:58] dead book to her he meant it should
[54:59] begin to realize who she was or who he
[55:02] was and she fells down his feet that he
[55:05] lays his right hand down upon her amen
[55:08] it says fear not fear not don't be
[55:12] afraid Amen don't be afraid of death
[55:14] hell and the grave don't be afraid of
[55:16] these things don't be afraid of these
[55:17] things I have chosen you
[55:20] I have chosen you to place my wordings
[55:22] you to place my spear within you to make
[55:25] you someone that you could never be on
[55:27] your own chosen to be one United with
[55:35] him a meant to be the Bride of Christ a
[55:40] man I think about victory the other day
[55:46] you know as Billy RAM had that sermon he
[55:49] preached called a total victory
[55:51] Amen we've been called to have a total
[55:54] deliverance a total victory complete and
[55:59] entire it not supposed to be a halfway
[56:01] deliverance not supposed to be a halfway
[56:04] victory you know this country we used to
[56:07] after the Second World War in this
[56:09] country we initiate a new holiday and
[56:13] that holiday was celebrated for about 25
[56:16] years and then we did away with it and
[56:19] that holiday was called v-day Victory
[56:22] Day a man a brother branham preached
[56:24] some sermons on v-day or Victory Day and
[56:27] and the origins of that whole holiday is
[56:31] this that when we were at war during
[56:34] World War two we're not only a war with
[56:37] Germany over in Europe but we were also
[56:39] war on the Pacific side over in Japan
[56:42] amen we had the battles coming s from
[56:46] both directions amen and so and so we
[56:49] are worried about the the peace of the
[56:51] Western world but we're also worried
[56:53] about the Japanese and and coming over
[56:55] and attacking our lands and and I read
[56:58] some of the stories about how they would
[57:00] send I like hot air balloons with bombs
[57:02] attached to them they would float over
[57:04] our country and some of actually would
[57:06] land in our farm fields and different
[57:07] places and you know and they sent
[57:09] airplanes over in different places or
[57:12] they you know they attacked Pearl Harbor
[57:13] and all the different things and and we
[57:15] decided not to let that stand we decided
[57:19] not to let that provocation stand we
[57:21] excited we wanted victory we decided
[57:24] that we wanted to deliver it's as a
[57:26] country as a nation amen so we began a
[57:29] war with Japan and when we
[57:33] after fighting the battle for so many of
[57:36] the you know three four years we won a
[57:39] complete and total victory and there on
[57:42] the on the battleship USS Missouri the
[57:46] leaders of Japan met our leadership and
[57:48] there on the deck of the battleship they
[57:51] signed an unconditional surrender of the
[57:54] of the kingdom of Japan an unconditional
[57:58] surrender of those that would attack us
[58:00] amen and and that ceremony where that
[58:04] surrender was signed that ceremony was
[58:07] celebrated in a holiday called v-day or
[58:10] Victory Day amen and we celebrated that
[58:13] victory for about 25 years a man but I
[58:16] got to at that time where we decided we
[58:18] didn't want to celebrate that holiday
[58:20] anymore amen and that victory has now
[58:22] been pretty much forgotten and and in
[58:26] the memory of most people in the memory
[58:29] of our nation and that's okay let those
[58:32] things go into the past but let me tell
[58:33] you there is a victory I'm not here to
[58:37] worry about this country over here this
[58:39] country over there what this old battle
[58:41] over there right I don't have any any
[58:43] desire to remember all those things
[58:45] those things don't concern me because I
[58:47] have a heavenly kingdom a mana there is
[58:50] only one battle that I am concerned with
[58:52] a man I don't have to worry about the
[58:54] bow between the north of the south or
[58:56] the between the blacks and the whites or
[58:59] between this nation and that nation
[59:01] between this this theory in this theory
[59:05] I'm not worried about what the Liberals
[59:07] versus the Conservatives those things do
[59:09] do I bother me amen let them fight their
[59:12] battles I am worried about one battle
[59:15] one battle alone a man is the battle
[59:17] between the forces of evil against the
[59:21] forces of good though the battle between
[59:23] the Holy Spirit of the Living God and
[59:26] the things that are contrary to the
[59:28] spirit of the Living God
[59:29] the battle between God's own word and
[59:32] his vision for this earth and everything
[59:34] that have come contrary to that vision a
[59:37] man because God before the foundation of
[59:39] the world had a vision in his mind and
[59:42] in that vision was a vision of not just
[59:45] not just a garden
[59:47] edan not just what God would create and
[59:50] protect upon this world but with a
[59:52] vision of you there's a vision of your
[59:55] soul living at peace on this world as a
[59:58] vision of your soul living in purity
[1:00:01] without sin amen and that vision Amen
[1:00:05] there has to be a victory to come back
[1:00:07] to that vision amen and and and and
[1:00:10] everything they would come contrary to
[1:00:12] the vision let there become a battle
[1:00:15] amen we are willing to fight for that
[1:00:18] Amy if there is anything that's going to
[1:00:21] come contrary to the vision of the Most
[1:00:23] High God then I'm sorry but we're gonna
[1:00:25] have a fight hey we're gonna have a
[1:00:29] battle we're gonna have a war why
[1:00:31] because I am willing to fight for that
[1:00:33] vision I am willing to go to battle for
[1:00:36] that for for that what that vision is
[1:00:39] amen amen and I am NOT here for a
[1:00:43] partial deliverance I'm not here for a
[1:00:46] halfway victory about here for a total
[1:00:48] victory a total deliverance so that
[1:00:52] whatever God's vision of me was before
[1:00:55] the foundation of the world that's where
[1:00:56] I'm going back to I was born to do that
[1:00:59] amen I was born for that victory I was
[1:01:02] placed here on the earth to win that
[1:01:04] victory and all power of heaven and
[1:01:07] earth is behind me to get me to that
[1:01:09] place a man I fell and when I saw him I
[1:01:12] fell at his feet as though dead and he
[1:01:15] laid his hand upon me and said fear not
[1:01:17] amen fear not for I am the first and the
[1:01:21] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:01:24] and behold I am Alive for evermore he
[1:01:27] told me
[1:01:27] amen I'll never leave you nor forsake oh
[1:01:30] is what he told me amen and I am willing
[1:01:33] to accept what he said to me Amen I
[1:01:35] willing to not just accept what Christ
[1:01:37] said to me by willing to bring it as a
[1:01:39] weapon into battle
[1:01:41] Amen I willing to fight with those words
[1:01:44] Amy because I know that there is a power
[1:01:46] behind me Amen to get me to that place
[1:01:50] amen I am Alive for evermore jesus said
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:55] and I had the keys of hell and of death
[1:01:57] amen so it all hell assailed me

[1:03:01] refuge and my fortress my god in him
[1:03:05] will I trust a man I will trust him
[1:03:08] constantly all the time in every
[1:03:11] situation no matter what comes upon me
[1:03:13] and I in life's journey you're gonna
[1:03:15] find me trusting in the Lord amen if you
[1:03:18] see me in this trial over here you're
[1:03:20] gonna find me trusting the Lord if you
[1:03:23] find me sick in a hospital somewhere
[1:03:24] you're gonna find me trusting in the
[1:03:26] Lord if you see my mind tormented about
[1:03:29] something you're still gonna find me but
[1:03:31] nevertheless I will trust in the Lord
[1:03:33] he's the one that has the keys of death
[1:03:36] hell and the grave and he is alive and
[1:03:38] forevermore alive to bring me back to
[1:03:40] what the vision was before the
[1:03:43] foundation of the world and that vision
[1:03:45] did not have a depressed that vision did
[1:03:47] not have me sick that vision didn't have
[1:03:50] me in the hospital that vision did not
[1:03:52] have me bound by the enemy that vision
[1:03:55] didn't have me sunk down in sin amen but
[1:03:58] that vision heavy perfectly whole a
[1:04:00] member of the Bride of Christ amen all
[1:04:03] power in heaven and earth has given unto
[1:04:04] Him amen to make me exactly what the
[1:04:08] vision said I was supposed to be
[1:04:12] amen him the cieth of vision run make it
[1:04:17] plain to him so they can run they can
[1:04:19] run after it with the power of the
[1:04:21] Almighty God amen
[1:04:24] let's hurry to Exodus chapter 3
[1:04:39] XS chapter 3 verse verse 7 I read here a
[1:04:45] couple verses this is Moses right at the
[1:04:47] burning bush you remember the story how
[1:04:54] he had ran from Egypt and had been there
[1:04:57] in the in the desert now for 40 years
[1:05:00] herding flocks and and I had forgotten
[1:05:03] pretty much his old past life amen and
[1:05:06] when he saw this this burning bush he
[1:05:11] decides to turn aside and see what what
[1:05:14] caused this this this bush to burn and
[1:05:17] was not consumed amen and when you when
[1:05:22] you come down to the when you come down
[1:05:28] to the seventh verse this is God talking
[1:05:30] to him out of the bush after guys
[1:05:33] introduced himself in verse six he says
[1:05:35] I am the God of thy father of God of
[1:05:38] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and God is
[1:05:40] introducing himself and Moses hides
[1:05:43] isn't face cuz he was afraid to look
[1:05:45] upon God amen
[1:05:47] the very one that that can't he can't
[1:05:50] God chose him God chose to come to him
[1:05:53] to reveal to himself but yet he was
[1:05:55] afraid to look upon he come to verse 7
[1:05:58] and the Lord says unto him I have surely
[1:06:02] seen the affliction of my people which
[1:06:05] are in Egypt I've heard their cry by
[1:06:09] reason of their taskmasters for I know
[1:06:12] their sorrows and I am come down well
[1:06:18] that's quite a blessing I like it when
[1:06:21] he comes down don't you
[1:06:22] Amen I am come down to deliver them out
[1:06:27] of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:06:29] what a blessing let's go ahead and verse
[1:06:32] 9 there says that now therefore behold
[1:06:34] the cry of the children of Israel has
[1:06:36] come under parn me I've seen the
[1:06:39] oppression wherewith the Egyptians
[1:06:41] oppress them
[1:06:47] now God was sending Moses as a deliverer
[1:06:51] and he sent all these he gave all this
[1:06:54] description to Moses about how Moses was
[1:06:57] gonna win the victory Moses I'm sinning
[1:07:00] you Moses to go in the victory he told
[1:07:04] him beforehand so now that Moses has
[1:07:07] become a believer now he's gotta go make
[1:07:09] the people a believer you know God
[1:07:11] expects his people to hear a message
[1:07:14] like this one time and believe when God
[1:07:18] gives a message of deliverance to his
[1:07:21] people he expects them to hear at the
[1:07:24] one time and believe yoen when when God
[1:07:30] when Jehovah was gonna bring them to the
[1:07:33] Red Sea he told them beforehand I am
[1:07:38] going to Pharaoh is going to let you go
[1:07:42] and you're gonna leave Egypt but I'm
[1:07:45] gonna harden his heart and he's going to
[1:07:47] chase after you but I will deliver you
[1:07:51] with a mighty hint so when they got to
[1:07:54] the Red Sea they should have never
[1:07:57] worked they should have never feared
[1:08:00] because God had already told them
[1:08:02] beforehand I will deliver you when you
[1:08:05] get to that place when you get to that
[1:08:07] time when you get to the Red Sea you
[1:08:10] stand there a wait and watch I will
[1:08:12] deliver you with a mighty hint not a
[1:08:16] weak and with a mighty hint and so but
[1:08:19] when they got there what they do oh it
[1:08:21] would have been better if we were stayed
[1:08:23] in Egypt oh I'm better if we had done
[1:08:25] this no instead of saying that they
[1:08:28] should sit there and waited and watched
[1:08:30] for the mighty hand and so should the
[1:08:33] Bride of Christ in every situation in
[1:08:37] their lives stand there and wait and
[1:08:39] watch for the mighty hand of God amen he
[1:08:42] sees heard your cries of oppression he's
[1:08:45] heard your Christ amen if you placed
[1:08:47] your prayers upon the altar I mean if
[1:08:49] you have something in your life that
[1:08:51] needs changed if you have something
[1:08:53] that's not right if you have something
[1:08:55] that's not according to the vision put
[1:08:59] it upon the altar
[1:09:01] amen if you as if God has revealed unto
[1:09:04] you the vision for your life and you see
[1:09:08] things in your life there are contrary
[1:09:09] to that vision laid upon the altar so
[1:09:14] that he could say I have heard their
[1:09:17] cries I've heard their tears I've heard
[1:09:22] their prayers and I am come down Amen
[1:09:27] they fell at my feet as though dead a
[1:09:29] man they laid their prayer upon the
[1:09:31] altar and I am cut down and I laid my
[1:09:33] right hand upon them behold fear not

[1:09:53] keys of cancer I have the keys of no

[1:09:59] my possession and I can unlock the door
[1:10:01] of deliverance to you I can unlock the
[1:10:03] door of healing to you amen amen as I

[1:10:11] you know when when someone comes down
[1:10:13] with a sickness
[1:10:14] amen that you know that if they do not
[1:10:17] get better they will die it's an illness
[1:10:21] that will kill them and so you know they

[1:10:34] in the natural the things that can help
[1:10:38] you the things that can heal you go to
[1:10:41] the doctor but there is a power that
[1:10:43] doesn't work we'll see that doctors
[1:10:45] going to work

[1:10:48] Amen he's going to work according to the
[1:10:50] laws of nature well that's okay

[1:10:54] nature amen let it happen you know but

[1:11:05] nature amen and it is not this it's not
[1:11:09] the same as a natural healing Amen
[1:11:12] because it is supernatural

[1:11:17] behalf when God comes down when God
[1:11:20] hears your cry when God comes to give
[1:11:23] you a total deliverance and you know and
[1:11:25] you say Lord I know that maybe I could
[1:11:28] be healed on the natural but you know
[1:11:30] maybe it's been a little while since
[1:11:32] I've seen God act on my behalf of my
[1:11:35] life sometimes you just get to a point
[1:11:37] where you know God I just would like to
[1:11:39] see you act in your mighty act in your
[1:11:42] power act with your deliverance I'd like
[1:11:44] to see the supernatural again in my life

[1:11:49] yeah I know I could have a natural
[1:11:52] healing I know I could have a natural
[1:11:54] deliverance we know sometimes I just
[1:11:56] want to give God a chance to intervene
[1:11:59] in my behalf because I like to see him
[1:12:01] work I like to see him move I like to
[1:12:03] see him deliver I like to see him set
[1:12:06] free I like to see him when he comes on
[1:12:08] the scene and deliver a man because when
[1:12:10] I know that when he comes I'm gonna have
[1:12:14] a testimony that I can bring to the loss
[1:12:16] and hurting somewhere down the line
[1:12:19] amen amen there's been times in both my
[1:12:24] wife and I his life to where we've had
[1:12:26] issues in her life whether it be
[1:12:28] sickness or or financial troubles or
[1:12:30] whatever it was and we knew we could
[1:12:32] seek a natural deliverance but sometimes
[1:12:35] you just want to see God act on your
[1:12:37] behalf
[1:12:38] amen and we put our trust in the Lord
[1:12:41] and you know what she came through and
[1:12:45] now we have a testimony of a
[1:12:47] supernatural God that that left heaven
[1:12:50] behind to come down and intervene into
[1:12:53] our affairs a man to give us a
[1:12:55] deliverance that we could have something
[1:12:57] we couldn't have done for ourselves amen
[1:13:00] amen and that's a victory it's a victory
[1:13:05] day it's something I celebrate I'm not
[1:13:08] going to forget about it I'm not gonna
[1:13:11] you know let something y'all like oh we
[1:13:14] quit celebrate a victory day because we
[1:13:15] want to become friends with Japan again
[1:13:17] and if we kept celebrating that holiday
[1:13:20] how can we celebrate our victory over
[1:13:22] Japan and then go and be friends with
[1:13:24] Japan and so we decided to get rid of
[1:13:27] the holiday
[1:13:27] and that's okay let them do that but you
[1:13:30] know when I get a victory over the devil

[1:13:39] I want to become friends of the devil
[1:13:40] again no no no I'm always gonna remember
[1:13:42] the time that I got the victory over
[1:13:45] something Satan did in my life son Satan
[1:13:48] came into my life and took me outside of
[1:13:50] the vision you know but I want a victory
[1:13:52] I put it upon the altar of prayer and I
[1:13:55] took that power of the supernatural
[1:13:57] power the Almighty God and acted upon my
[1:14:00] behalf and brought me back into unity
[1:14:04] with the vision amen a complete victory
[1:14:07] and when I saw him he laid his hands
[1:14:11] upon me that's what's said in
[1:14:13] Revelations and when I saw him I fell
[1:14:16] asleep
[1:14:18] and he laid his hands upon me that's a
[1:14:21] good place to be
[1:14:22] amen it's good to get to a place it's
[1:14:26] where you could see him where he can
[1:14:28] reveal give God the opportunity to
[1:14:31] reveal himself to you
[1:14:33] amen you have every single one of us has
[1:14:36] a solemn duty to get ourselves to the

[1:15:30] time that revelation is one said 17 it
[1:15:36] says and when I saw him I fell at his
[1:15:39] feet as dead
[1:15:41] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:15:43] saying fear not what a powerful message
[1:15:49] we ought to get to that place the Bride
[1:15:53] of Christ every single member of the
[1:15:54] Briar cry ought to have a testimony that
[1:15:57] she's been there a man that she's been
[1:15:59] there she's had that experience I fell
[1:16:02] at his feet as though dead Christ has
[1:16:04] revealed himself to me amen but you know
[1:16:06] what he came and he brought the peace to
[1:16:08] me a man he is the the peace that passes
[1:16:12] all understanding a man he has healed me
[1:16:15] he has delivered me he brought peace to
[1:16:16] me said don't you fear don't you worry I
[1:16:19] all power in heaven and earth has given
[1:16:22] unto me and I'm willing to exercise that
[1:16:24] power in your life
[1:16:26] amen to bring a victory amen you know in
[1:16:36] the Revolutionary War we fought to be
[1:16:39] free from overseas powers amen
[1:16:43] we fought to be free from paying taxes
[1:16:46] to England a man we've fought to be free
[1:16:48] to to to to worship however we wanted to
[1:16:52] worship a Mendte
[1:16:54] not worship according to the Church of
[1:16:55] England not paid taxes to King George a
[1:16:58] member we wanted to have to govern
[1:17:00] ourselves and we fought a war the
[1:17:04] Revolutionary War to win the victory and
[1:17:07] because we won that victory we should
[1:17:10] never go back to paying taxes to England
[1:17:14] we should always worship but we should
[1:17:16] not go back to religious slavery amen we
[1:17:21] should always celebrate that right to
[1:17:24] govern ourselves why because otherwise
[1:17:27] we are forgetting the blood that won
[1:17:30] that victory our country paid a price
[1:17:34] where our soldiers fought and died to
[1:17:37] win that victory and when we go back and
[1:17:39] back slide on that victory we're saying
[1:17:43] that that blood was shed for no purpose
[1:17:45] for no reason Humana gin George
[1:17:49] Washington losing half of his army to to
[1:17:52] win the fort in Boston
[1:17:55] I didn't just say well let's go back and
[1:17:58] go home and just give it back to him
[1:17:59] after losing the 2000 mint those that
[1:18:03] it's counting those lives or those 2000
[1:18:05] men is not worth anything
[1:18:07] a man so the same thing you like with
[1:18:10] the Civil War we fought in the Civil War
[1:18:12] our country was splitting apart amen and
[1:18:15] you know they had a president that they
[1:18:19] say was was kind of weak and and was not
[1:18:23] willing to hold the country together or
[1:18:25] to pay the price and then we elected an
[1:18:27] Abraham Lincoln a man a man that had a
[1:18:31] fury in his mind that no matter what I'm
[1:18:35] gonna pay the price for this country to
[1:18:38] stay together I'm gonna pay the price
[1:18:40] for for this country to be United Amy
[1:18:43] it's so much so that when when the
[1:18:45] battle was over he even went to the
[1:18:48] South and did things to make sure that
[1:18:50] they didn't just win the battle over the
[1:18:53] south but that the South was forgiven
[1:18:56] and brought back into unity amen
[1:19:01] he paid the price he and the battle was
[1:19:05] fought to get rid of slavery and to
[1:19:08] bring the country back together in a
[1:19:11] union any unit unity so all those lives
[1:19:14] that were lost if we fight one American
[1:19:17] to another American they were saying
[1:19:19] that those lives were lost in vain we
[1:19:23] should always celebrate that victory
[1:19:25] amen so also if Christ died to set us
[1:19:28] free
[1:19:29] then we should always celebrate that
[1:19:32] victory I mean if Christ died to to pay
[1:19:35] the debt of to get the keys of death
[1:19:38] hell and the grave amen - as he said the
[1:19:41] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:19:42] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:19:44] gospel to the poor Amy he's annoying to
[1:19:47] me to bind up the brokenhearted to set
[1:19:49] at liberty those that are bound if he
[1:19:51] paid the price for that then we should
[1:19:54] always celebrate that victory and not
[1:19:56] allow us to backslide into bondage - -
[1:20:00] through something of the devil but
[1:20:03] always keeping it in mind the the vision
[1:20:05] that God had of us before the foundation
[1:20:08] of the world
[1:20:09] and the power of his death to bring us
[1:20:11] back to that vision
[1:20:14] amen amen otherwise it's a forgotten
[1:20:18] victory
[1:20:19] amen and we're back sighted on the price
[1:20:22] that was paid
[1:20:34] let's turn over to the Book of Isaiah
[1:20:36] chapter 62
[1:20:52] Isaiah 62
[1:21:01] says there in the fourth verse here's
[1:21:06] God is talking about his people his land
[1:21:09] his nation and they'd got into a bad
[1:21:16] place his people were in bondage he
[1:21:21] wanted to preach a gospel of deliverance
[1:21:23] to them and Isaiah 62 4 he says thou
[1:21:33] shall no more be termed forsaken neither
[1:21:40] shall thy land be termed desolate called
[1:21:44] desolate but thou shalt be called
[1:21:47] hepzibah and I'll and we called Beulah
[1:21:53] for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy
[1:21:57] land shall be married for as a young man
[1:22:01] marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry
[1:22:04] thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over
[1:22:07] the bride so shall thy God rejoice over
[1:22:12] thee amen
[1:22:14] just like what he said in sake of Peter
[1:22:16] so that you will not be barren or
[1:22:18] unfruitful he's gonna rejoice over you
[1:22:19] he's gonna share his his attributes with
[1:22:24] you amen but eat but let me let's just
[1:22:27] talk let's just go through these terms
[1:22:28] here these names he says that thy land
[1:22:31] shall no longer be called desolate the
[1:22:36] people had gotten to a place to where
[1:22:40] you know maybe they were still called
[1:22:43] the people of Israel or the children of
[1:22:45] the Most High God but in the spiritual
[1:22:47] sense of it their name was called
[1:22:50] forsaken amen you know and you call
[1:22:54] someone something you call it according
[1:22:59] to their characteristics according to
[1:23:01] what they are their name has a meeting
[1:23:02] this is the title of your characters
[1:23:06] characteristics and verse for their
[1:23:09] characteristics had become forsaken amen
[1:23:14] and their land
[1:23:15] and become to be called desolate let me
[1:23:19] tell you those were accurate
[1:23:20] descriptions the people had become
[1:23:24] forsaken their land have become desolate
[1:23:27] that was the description of God's own
[1:23:30] land and God's own people
[1:23:32] amen I I was looking those words up and
[1:23:35] you know and if you remember your
[1:23:39] language lessons from elementary school
[1:23:44] this goes way back they'll teach you
[1:23:49] about antonyms and synonyms and an
[1:23:54] antonym if you take a word as a specific
[1:23:59] meaning then an antonym is a list of all
[1:24:07] the words that have the exact I haven't
[1:24:08] the opposite meeting and the synonym
[1:24:12] will be a list of words that have the
[1:24:15] same meaning or a similar meaning amen
[1:24:19] and so you take the word forsaken
[1:24:21] there's you can look up all the antonyms
[1:24:25] of that word all the things that have
[1:24:28] the opposite meaning and so the antonyms
[1:24:32] of the word forsaken will be cherished
[1:24:36] or helped or nurtured wanted something
[1:24:46] to be desired something that's cared for
[1:24:52] something that's considered or brought
[1:24:55] into consideration something that's
[1:24:57] useful that's the opposite of being
[1:25:01] forsaken so if he's saying you're no
[1:25:06] longer gonna be called no longer gonna
[1:25:09] have the opportunity to be called
[1:25:11] forsaken but instead you're going to the
[1:25:14] opportunity when people look at you and
[1:25:16] they bring their description of you and
[1:25:18] they want to describe who you are if
[1:25:21] they want to put a name to you they'll
[1:25:23] call you cherished the one that has been
[1:25:25] helped the one that has been nurtured
[1:25:28] the one that is wanted
[1:25:29] desired the one that is cared for the
[1:25:32] one is being considered by her lover a
[1:25:34] man the one that is B is useful amen
[1:25:38] that's so that's what the you're not
[1:25:39] gonna be called forsake anymore but this
[1:25:41] is what you're gonna be called this is
[1:25:43] your new name amen and the land that you
[1:25:46] live in is no longer be called desolate
[1:25:48] well the antonyms of desolate will be
[1:25:51] cultivated it's populated it's useful
[1:25:54] the land has been farmed and in the seed
[1:25:57] they're planted there they grow up it's
[1:25:59] well watered anyway it's not desolate
[1:26:01] emore but it's bringing forth fruit
[1:26:02] fruit is two seasons and God says that
[1:26:05] you're not going to be called these
[1:26:07] things anymore but you'll have a new
[1:26:09] name amen he says but you will be called
[1:26:13] Hephzibah and I'll and shall be called
[1:26:16] Beulah now I word hepzibah means my
[1:26:21] delight is in her a man I take delight
[1:26:25] in her my joy is placed in her amen you
[1:26:29] and you will be called the one that has
[1:26:31] the joy of God over her the one that God
[1:26:34] enjoys to be with the God one that God
[1:26:36] enjoys to add to to live with to act on
[1:26:39] her behalf to give special gifts to her
[1:26:42] a little love tokens from from the
[1:26:44] heavenly places they meant a man his
[1:26:47] delight is in her amen
[1:26:48] so you're not gonna be called forsake
[1:26:50] anymore but it said here we called
[1:26:52] Hepzibah and your land isn't be called
[1:26:54] Beulah married Amen now the this the
[1:27:01] synonyms let's look at not the antonyms
[1:27:04] not the opposite but let's look at the
[1:27:06] synonyms of delight my delight is in her
[1:27:12] hepzibah he said you will no longer be
[1:27:15] called desolate but you will be called
[1:27:17] Hepzibah my delight is in her amen and
[1:27:21] that word delight the synonyms of that
[1:27:23] would be contentment he is contented
[1:27:28] with you think about that

[1:28:57] amen
[1:28:58] conjoined it's become one unity that

[1:29:04] God everything one with the vision of
[1:29:07] God the place where you land is not

[1:29:11] a land where all the promises of God are
[1:29:14] in unity with the vision of God God's
[1:29:17] will as power in that land where the
[1:29:22] will is God is in that land that's what
[1:29:24] happens amen amen
[1:29:27] it's just like we preached a long time
[1:29:30] ago about how God in Revelation says we
[1:29:33] have become kings and priests unto Him
[1:29:36] amen we have become kings and priests
[1:29:38] unto our God amen when you look at the
[1:29:41] duties in the land of Israel of the
[1:29:44] Kings in the priests and
[1:29:46] what it meant what kings and priests
[1:29:47] meant to to the Land of Israel the the
[1:29:51] priests had dominion over the tabernacle
[1:29:55] over the temple amen and it was the duty
[1:29:57] of the priests to to make sure
[1:30:00] everything was done in order and that
[1:30:02] all the things were that the daily
[1:30:04] sacrifice was performed amen that there
[1:30:06] was always wood stacked up for the fire
[1:30:08] any way that there was lambs that were
[1:30:11] ready and purified for the sacrifice a
[1:30:14] man and that the and the priest had kept
[1:30:16] himself clean to to perform the
[1:30:18] sacrifices so that when the people had a
[1:30:21] need to bring a sacrifice or a peace
[1:30:25] offering or a wave offering that they
[1:30:27] could come to the temple door and that
[1:30:29] the high priest had already had
[1:30:31] everything ready to make sure that the
[1:30:33] people's sins were taken care of that
[1:30:34] their sicknesses could be healed that
[1:30:36] their that their house could be
[1:30:37] delivered and that was the duty of the
[1:30:39] high priest amen
[1:30:41] hey he had complete dominion over the
[1:30:43] temple and he had prepared the wood was
[1:30:46] stacked up over here from the fire amen
[1:30:48] the oil had already been beaten out of
[1:30:49] the olives amen
[1:30:50] and all the things were ready the
[1:30:53] showbread was on them upon the table the
[1:30:55] place was clean and well maintained so
[1:30:58] at the presence of God we have a place
[1:30:59] to come down so the people could have
[1:31:01] their sins taken care of as the duty of
[1:31:04] the high priest towards out to create a
[1:31:07] place where the presence of God could
[1:31:09] come down and the people to be united
[1:31:11] with their God at the temple amen and
[1:31:15] that word of God had a place that could
[1:31:17] live there in the Ark of the Covenant
[1:31:18] where the the tablets of the ten
[1:31:22] commandments that God wrote with his
[1:31:24] finger were kept there and protected
[1:31:26] there in the temple and the temple amen
[1:31:29] and that was the duty of the priest amen
[1:31:32] but the duty of the King was to take the
[1:31:35] Dominion of that word and to extend that
[1:31:38] to meaning out to the outermost
[1:31:40] geographical boundaries of the Land of
[1:31:42] Israel
[1:31:43] so the Dominion of the Word of God had
[1:31:45] power throughout all the land of Israel
[1:31:49] not just there in the in the temple but
[1:31:53] also everywhere to the furthermost
[1:31:56] boundaries of Israel and God has called
[1:31:59] us
[1:31:59] we were to be kings and priests unto our
[1:32:02] God a man were to take the Word of God
[1:32:05] and let have a place inside of us that's
[1:32:08] kept clean and pure a man soweth some
[1:32:11] from fingertip to fingertip from head to
[1:32:13] toe God has a place where he can rest
[1:32:16] God is a place on the earth where he can
[1:32:18] come and visit God has a place where he
[1:32:20] can come and dwell a member is God when
[1:32:23] his people have become united he's in
[1:32:25] chanted with her he's one with her a man
[1:32:27] God is a place where he can lay his head
[1:32:29] amen and be at peace with his people
[1:32:31] amen but not only that but we're here
[1:32:34] also as kings to bring the Dominion of
[1:32:37] that word to our homes to our workplace
[1:32:39] to everywhere we are Dominion is a man
[1:32:42] so the people might see the actions of
[1:32:45] the Almighty God amen amen amen but he
[1:32:51] that lacketh these things is blind and
[1:32:54] cannot see afar off remember in Peter
[1:32:56] when he starts talking about all the all
[1:32:59] the attributes of God and he says by he
[1:33:02] that lacketh these things it doesn't
[1:33:04] have the attributes of God hasn't
[1:33:06] prepared a place for God to come down he
[1:33:08] the lack of see sings as blind cannot
[1:33:11] see afar off and he's forgotten that he
[1:33:15] was purged and cleansed from his past
[1:33:17] sentence amen
[1:33:19] no longer Mary doesn't have a place for
[1:33:21] God to come down let's just sit here in
[1:33:24] closing let's turn our first Peter 5
[1:33:32] I fell at his feet as though dead and he
[1:33:34] laid his hand upon me he gave me
[1:33:36] assurance a mint
[1:33:39] he gave me an assurance he said fear not

[1:33:48] grave I'll lay my hand upon you and heal
[1:33:51] you and deliver you and bring you back
[1:33:53] according to the vision first Peter 5
[1:33:59] verse 10 it says but the God of all
[1:34:03] Grace who hath called us it wasn't great

[1:34:30] settled look to him a mint Amy if you
[1:34:34] don't know who your sir if you don't
[1:34:35] know the power if he hasn't laid his
[1:34:37] hand upon you if it hasn't been revealed
[1:34:40] to you the power of God then you need to
[1:34:46] go back and make sure you're calling
[1:34:48] elections shirt a mint because the God
[1:34:50] of all Grace who has called us unto his
[1:34:53] eternal glory and after you suffer over
