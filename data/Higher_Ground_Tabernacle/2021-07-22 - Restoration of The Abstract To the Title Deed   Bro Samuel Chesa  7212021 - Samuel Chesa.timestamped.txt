[34:59] and over all the earth and
[35:02] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[35:05] upon the earth
[35:07] so god created man in his own image
[35:10] in the image of god created he him male
[35:13] and female created he them and god
[35:16] blessed them
[35:17] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[35:20] multiply
[35:21] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[35:24] and have dominion over the fish of the
[35:27] sea and over the fowl of the air
[35:29] and over every living thing that moved
[35:31] upon the earth
[35:33] and god said behold i have given you
[35:36] every herb
[35:37] bearing seed which is upon the face of
[35:39] the earth and every tree
[35:42] and the witch is a fruit of a tree
[35:44] yielding seed
[35:45] to you it shall be for meat let us bow
[35:47] heads and pray
[35:49] dear gracious heavenly father we have
[35:51] read your word oh lord
[35:53] just like any man can but it only takes
[35:55] you lord
[35:56] to come in and open your word and reveal
[35:59] it to us oh god
[36:00] we know those two men who were going to
[36:02] emmaus lord
[36:03] they could not realize that it was you
[36:05] until you opened
[36:07] until you broke that bread and gave it
[36:09] to them lord
[36:10] here we are gathered this evening oh
[36:12] lord not gathered unto any man

[36:42] and that's our heart's desire lord we
[36:44] commit the whole service into your hand
[36:45] saying father may you pour down your
[36:47] anointing may you just give
[36:49] unction oh god unto his words oh lord i
[36:51] give you all the glory and all the honor
[36:53] in jesus christ's name i pray believing
[36:55] amen
[37:01] let me take all seeds amen
[37:07] for a short time i want to speak on this
[37:10] uh
[37:11] subject the restoration of the abstract
[37:14] to the title amen
[37:16] when we were reading in genesis chapter
[37:18] 1
[37:19] in verse 28 we realize
[37:23] that god gave dominion to man over the
[37:27] fish of the sea
[37:28] and over the fall of the air and over
[37:30] every living thing that moved upon the
[37:32] earth
[37:35] that was after god created man after he
[37:37] created adam and eve
[37:39] and then he gave to them the dominion
[37:41] over the earth
[37:42] to say you are the lords of this earth
[37:44] whatever you say
[37:46] it shall be done and then we realize
[37:49] adam had dominion over all creeping
[37:51] things he started
[37:52] naming animals god did not finish the
[37:55] whole creation
[37:56] he left part of it for adam to finish
[37:59] which was
[38:00] naming every living creature whenever
[38:03] adam will say
[38:04] you are going to be called a lion god
[38:06] will say amen
[38:08] when adam will say you shall be called
[38:11] an
[38:11] elephant god said amen he had left that
[38:15] part to adam
[38:16] he gave adam that dominion
[38:19] this is because adam he had that book
[38:22] that title deed that god had when he
[38:25] gave him the dominion amen
[38:27] the abstract to the title which is the
[38:30] right
[38:31] to the title deed amen so
[38:34] the prophet of god will tell us that
[38:35] when adam would change the course
[38:37] of the flowing of a river if he decides
[38:40] i don't like the way you are flowing
[38:42] you move from east to west i want you to
[38:44] move from the west to the north
[38:46] the river would listen to him because he
[38:49] had that authority
[38:51] he had that title deed that had been
[38:53] handed to him by god amen
[38:56] and every time he would tell the wind i
[38:59] don't like the way you were blowing
[39:01] you change your direction and go that
[39:02] way the wind would obey the voice of
[39:05] adam
[39:06] because he had the title deed he was
[39:09] made
[39:09] in the image of god the man that was
[39:12] made in the image of god was the spirit
[39:14] man
[39:15] the one that god breathed into adam amen
[39:19] so he had absolute authority over nature
[39:22] that god had given to him
[39:24] he had the abstract title deed to the
[39:26] earth
[39:27] and each and every one of god's creation
[39:30] we know an abstract is a title this is
[39:33] the right
[39:34] to the title that you have it gives a
[39:36] track record
[39:38] of that title of all the people who ever
[39:41] owned it
[39:42] and everything that has to do with that
[39:44] title
[39:45] that's what the abstract is and adam had
[39:47] it
[39:48] so he was using it to his own advantage
[39:51] and he was finishing the creation of
[39:54] godhead and god
[39:56] had set the earth to go that way for men
[39:58] to live by the spoken word
[40:01] god men were supposed to give birth
[40:04] we're supposed to multiply he gave them
[40:06] that that he gave them that commandment
[40:08] and they were supposed to do that by the
[40:10] spoken word
[40:12] this was because they had the dominion
[40:14] the abstract
[40:16] of the title was in adam's hands amen
[40:21] but we realize that adam willingly
[40:24] when eve was deceived by the serpent
[40:27] adam willingly fell
[40:29] and he gave up this abstract title and
[40:32] he no longer have dominion
[40:35] and the prophet of god earlier on when i
[40:37] was reading he said when adam fell
[40:40] he lost that title and satan took a hold
[40:43] of it
[40:44] but after 63 after the full opening of
[40:46] the word
[40:47] the prophet of god comes back again and
[40:49] said no satan did not touch it
[40:52] he could not put his dirty hands on that
[40:54] title
[40:55] god took it back when adam fell amen
[40:59] satan is not the rightful owner of that
[41:01] deed
[41:02] so when men fell the book went back to
[41:05] god
[41:06] and he held it back he was waiting for
[41:08] the right time
[41:09] to give it back to man so in genesis
[41:12] chapter 3 verse 15
[41:14] it says god was cursing the serpent and
[41:18] he was
[41:19] giving the curse after the fall and he
[41:21] said and i will put
[41:23] enmity between thee and the woman
[41:26] and between thy seed and her seed
[41:29] it shall bruise thy head and thou should
[41:32] bruise his heel
[41:34] here god was already putting a prophecy
[41:36] for the way back of that title did
[41:39] to come back into the hands of man and
[41:42] we know that the seed of the woman that
[41:43] was being talked about here
[41:45] was jesus christ himself he was the one
[41:48] who was set god whom he had ordained
[41:50] before the foundation of the world
[41:52] that he was the one who had to take back
[41:55] that title
[41:56] that title did to take back that book
[41:58] and
[41:59] give it back into the hands of the bride
[42:03] the prophet of god says in uh the breach
[42:05] he says now
[42:06] the forfeited title deed is now in the
[42:09] hands of the original honor
[42:10] almighty god the title deed to the earth
[42:14] and to eternal life when adam forfeeded
[42:17] it
[42:18] then satan's dirty hands could not take
[42:20] it so it went back to the original honor
[42:23] and that was god himself and now he sits
[42:26] on the throne with it in his hands
[42:28] the title did to eternal life the
[42:31] abstract title did to eternal life
[42:33] when adam fulfilled it for wisdom
[42:35] instead of faith
[42:36] it went back into the hands of the owner
[42:38] almighty god
[42:40] what a great thing god took it back he
[42:42] says
[42:43] satan you cannot touch it he trusted man
[42:46] and he says
[42:48] you have failed i'm now taking matters
[42:50] back into my own hands
[42:52] and by that when they lost dominion
[42:55] over every living thing when they lost
[42:57] dominion over nature
[42:59] man could no longer have any control he
[43:02] could no longer have the power of the
[43:03] spoken word
[43:04] because he had lost the abstract to the
[43:07] title
[43:08] he no longer had rights to that title
[43:10] deed god had taken it
[43:12] back and we see the earth people were
[43:14] raffled by
[43:15] sicknesses people were ravished by death
[43:18] violence
[43:19] and everything was there man was out of
[43:21] control because the title deed had been
[43:23] taken from the hands of man
[43:24] and god had taken back to him and adam
[43:27] and eve
[43:28] they were kicked out of the garden of
[43:30] eden and he says you are not coming back
[43:33] because you have failed and then
[43:36] he kicked them out and they could not
[43:38] come back in
[43:40] this was because of the disobedience of
[43:43] adam they wanted to use wisdom over
[43:45] faith
[43:46] we are not supposed to do that we are
[43:49] never supposed to reason the word
[43:51] when the word comes you take it to your
[43:53] heart don't take it to your head
[43:55] every time you take it to your head
[43:56] satan is going to come and reason it out
[43:59] that's what eve did he stayed long she
[44:02] stayed
[44:02] long enough with the devil never do that
[44:06] the devil is not your friend any
[44:08] conversation you have with the devil
[44:10] shun him away
[44:11] every time the devil starts talking to
[44:13] you just give him the word
[44:15] that word will let him go you know satan
[44:18] tried to tempt jesus
[44:20] although he was the almighty god living
[44:22] in the
[44:23] in the flesh he was using the word to
[44:25] overcome satan
[44:27] when satan tried to say you turned
[44:29] stones into bread
[44:30] jesus said no i'm not doing that why he
[44:33] used the word thou shall not tell the
[44:34] lord thy god
[44:36] he knew the power he knew the authority
[44:38] that was in the word amen
[44:41] so when satan comes to try you with that
[44:43] same technique
[44:45] use the word it has worked over and over
[44:47] again
[44:48] and it will still work and it will give
[44:50] you victory
[44:52] so we realized adam and eve they were
[44:54] supposed to be
[44:55] they were supposed to be immortal but
[44:57] because of the fall they started aging
[45:00] they started dying and we see all the
[45:03] bad things that started coming on the
[45:04] earth
[45:05] the earth was the the earth was now
[45:08] reacting to this fall
[45:10] the earth was bringing forth thistles
[45:13] tissues were never part of the original
[45:15] creation and we see the weather change
[45:18] climate change and they started having
[45:20] winter now we are all suffering
[45:22] the bad winters because of the fall i
[45:25] know brother brooks doesn't like the
[45:26] winter
[45:27] it's really bad it's really bad here in
[45:29] iowa
[45:30] that was because of the fall but we
[45:33] thank god
[45:34] that there is going to be a time when we
[45:35] go back we are never going to see no
[45:38] no winter no more we are not going to
[45:40] see no thistles no more
[45:42] when we go back to where we come from
[45:44] amen and
[45:45] everything is returned back to its
[45:47] original state
[45:49] so men started aging adam and eve became
[45:52] immortal
[45:53] and that's after the fall and everything
[45:55] started going seemingly started going to
[45:58] go
[45:58] sideways but that was god's original
[46:00] plan
[46:01] he had everything pre-determined before
[46:03] the foundation of the world
[46:05] amen and the man started sinning
[46:09] and every time men were sinning they
[46:11] were putting a lot of claims on this
[46:13] book there was a lot of debt
[46:15] that was that was uh accumulating on
[46:17] this book of the title deed
[46:19] yeah all the way 4 000 years going up
[46:23] until when jesus came down this claim
[46:26] had so much debt on it that the only way
[46:29] the debt
[46:30] could be removed there had to be a
[46:32] killing there had to be a sacrifice
[46:35] and the only sacrifice that was going to
[46:37] be there was of a being that was greater
[46:39] than human beings
[46:41] we know in the old testament when those
[46:43] sages of old when they would sin
[46:45] they would sacrifice lambs and goats and
[46:48] bulls
[46:49] but we know that the blood of an animal
[46:51] is lower the life of an animal is lower
[46:54] than of a man
[46:55] so it could not atone for the sins
[46:58] that blood only covered those sins
[47:01] it only took the blood of jesus a man
[47:04] who never died
[47:06] a man who never sinned to come and atone
[47:09] for all those
[47:10] sins amen so we
[47:13] humanity ended up we ended up owing a
[47:16] debt
[47:17] that we could not pay but god he was
[47:19] there he was willing to pay
[47:21] a debt that he did not owe hey man
[47:25] the prophet god says you say i bought a
[47:26] piece of ground it
[47:28] is not yours yet until you got an
[47:30] abstract
[47:31] but if you got an abstract it shows that
[47:33] everything was ever
[47:35] against that piece of land has been
[47:37] stricken off
[47:38] so you can hold that title but you don't
[47:41] have the abstract
[47:42] which is the right to the title you
[47:45] cannot exercise that title
[47:47] until all the deaths that's accumulated
[47:49] to that title
[47:50] has been paid off so
[47:53] you are just holding it but you have no
[47:55] power you have no power in it
[47:57] and god was trying to create and make a
[48:00] way back
[48:01] to bring back the power to you and me to
[48:04] bring back the power into the hands of
[48:05] the bride
[48:06] amen we realized throughout the
[48:10] all the four thousand years from adam
[48:12] all those great prophets
[48:14] moses abraham isaac jacob and all of
[48:18] them
[48:18] no one was worthy to put a claim to pay
[48:21] the debt of
[48:22] on this claim no one was worthy to take
[48:26] that book
[48:27] because that book had gone back into the
[48:29] hands of god
[48:30] and he was holding it waiting for that
[48:32] person
[48:33] that man was able to clear up that debt
[48:36] and take back that book to him
[48:38] amen and we realized through the the
[48:42] typing
[48:42] uh in the in the book of um of ruth
[48:45] that boaz was not the closest king to
[48:48] ruth
[48:48] and we know that satan was our closest
[48:51] kin
[48:52] god was not he was further so satan was
[48:55] the one
[48:55] who had the first right to come and
[48:58] clear up that debt
[48:59] he was the one who had the first right
[49:01] to come and claim you and me
[49:03] but he was not willing to shed his blood
[49:07] because he knows he knew the moment he
[49:10] dies he's not coming back
[49:12] up so he say he washed his hands
[49:15] and he says not me he says not me and he
[49:18] walked away
[49:20] amen and then god was there he saw that
[49:23] satan could not make it
[49:25] god was not panicking he knew that satan
[49:27] would not do it
[49:28] because he is the one who created him he
[49:31] knew
[49:31] all the abilities he knows all the
[49:33] abilities and disabilities that satan
[49:36] has
[49:36] so he was not worried at all i believe
[49:39] he was just folding his
[49:40] hands waiting for satan to walk out of
[49:43] the game
[49:43] and say i have lost i cannot do this and
[49:46] that was only god who could do it amen
[49:51] so god was trying to create a way back
[49:54] and
[49:55] all those sages all those prophets no
[49:57] one else could do it
[49:59] but god he said i have to come down i
[50:01] have to become a man
[50:03] and walk down i have to die that's why
[50:06] he created a body
[50:08] of flesh a man a body that never sinned
[50:11] whom he called his son jesus and he
[50:13] decided
[50:14] to dwell in that body and the prophet of
[50:18] god says
[50:18] that jesus in him he was a hundred
[50:21] percent man
[50:22] and he was a hundred percent god when he
[50:25] was walking right there
[50:27] so when he was walking on the earth he
[50:29] experienced
[50:30] everything that you and me could ever
[50:32] experience
[50:34] he got to be hungry at some point in
[50:36] time he was rejected
[50:38] he was shunned away so he knows that
[50:41] feeling
[50:42] he was a man so there is no feeling that
[50:45] you can ever
[50:46] go through that god does not know just
[50:49] you approach to him in his word
[50:51] he says in jeremiah he says i know
[50:54] when you are crying you are in pain you
[50:56] are right there
[50:58] god says i know
[51:01] he suffered the biggest rejection there
[51:04] was
[51:06] he was his closest friend his closest
[51:10] body would took him
[51:11] taken out a knife and cut the soldiers
[51:13] who were trying to come to him
[51:15] he knew he was going to deny him three
[51:17] times
[51:19] if it was judas who was going to deny
[51:21] christ he already knew it
[51:23] he was he was a traitor but now look
[51:25] peter
[51:26] the one whom he was going to hand the
[51:28] keys he says i do not know this man
[51:31] none at all he denied him three times
[51:34] but judas only denied christ
[51:36] once so we see this is a matter of grace
[51:39] it's not how good you are but it is
[51:42] because before the foundation of the
[51:43] world
[51:44] he predestinated you and me hallelujah
[51:48] so despite whatever wrong you're gonna
[51:50] do it's not how much wrong you're gonna
[51:51] do
[51:52] but it is because you already selected
[51:54] you and you put your name
[51:56] in the book of life to say this is my
[51:59] son
[51:59] this is my daughter nothing is going to
[52:02] happen to you
[52:03] no matter how many times you sin no
[52:05] matter how many times you do wrong
[52:07] god has that way prepared for you to
[52:10] come back
[52:11] because he has predestinated you as a
[52:14] son
[52:14] he has predestinated you as a daughter
[52:17] amen
[52:18] so the way back he had created he it had
[52:22] to take
[52:22] the second adam i think it's in first
[52:24] corinthians 15
[52:26] what paul is talking about that christ
[52:28] was the second adam
[52:29] it had to be a man because it was god
[52:32] cannot die
[52:33] so he was not going to be able to die to
[52:36] redeem it
[52:36] it had to take a man and jesus christ
[52:40] came down
[52:41] with this one mission which was to take
[52:44] back the book and give it back to the
[52:46] bride
[52:47] so he came down as the second adam
[52:51] a way that god had prepared already
[52:53] before the foundation of the world
[52:55] you know god knows the beginning from
[52:57] the end so there is
[52:58] nothing that worries him god is never
[53:01] surprised
[53:02] you and me we can be surprised but god
[53:05] is never surprised
[53:07] that's why we have to have faith in god
[53:10] i had one person say the amount of faith
[53:13] that you have
[53:14] is determined by the credibility of the
[53:17] person who says it
[53:18] if a liar tells you gives you a promise
[53:21] that i'm going to give you a hundred
[53:23] dollars tomorrow
[53:24] you're not going to believe them because
[53:27] of their character
[53:28] so the amount of faith you have in a
[53:30] person is determined by the character of
[53:32] that person
[53:34] so you are not going to trust it but now
[53:37] when someone who has always come through
[53:39] on his word
[53:40] when they tell you they are going to do
[53:41] it you can sleep
[53:43] all night you do not have to worry
[53:45] because
[53:46] you know that they are going to do it
[53:49] now what more about god when god says
[53:52] something in his word
[53:53] he is going to come through for you he
[53:55] will never fail in his word
[53:57] but it has to come to pass amen when god
[54:00] speaks
[54:01] it has to happen that's why we gotta
[54:05] trust him
[54:06] that's why we gotta trust god because he
[54:08] is not a man that he should lie
[54:10] neither is he a son of man that he
[54:12] should repent but he always comes
[54:14] through on his word amen
[54:17] so jesus was the man that
[54:20] god had created and that was the first
[54:23] creation of god
[54:24] he already pre-planned everything before
[54:27] the foundation of the world
[54:29] and he says you are the second adam he
[54:31] is the one who is going to claim the
[54:33] book
[54:33] he was the only one who was worthy amen
[54:36] amen and that's why he came down and he
[54:40] accepted the mission and he said lord as
[54:43] a man he said i cannot see this
[54:45] because god the prophet god tells us
[54:47] that when he went up on the mount uh
[54:48] transfiguration
[54:50] he saw the whole calvary he saw the
[54:52] whole calvary experience
[54:54] that's why when he was in the garden of
[54:55] gethsemane he was there crying
[54:58] and he could not handle it until he had
[55:00] sweat of
[55:01] blood because he knew the the amount
[55:04] how hard the task was before him but he
[55:07] said
[55:07] lord not my will but yours
[55:11] he knew that if it was not if it's not
[55:13] me then who
[55:15] he saw you today two thousand years ago
[55:19] that's what compelled him to go to that
[55:21] cross
[55:22] he saw you seated here tonight he saw
[55:26] you where you are
[55:27] he saw your sickness that was troubling
[55:29] you he saw your harsh desire
[55:31] and he says although i'm going to get
[55:33] those lashes
[55:34] despite lord not my will but yours
[55:38] and he submitted himself and he was
[55:41] willing to go
[55:42] on the cross of calvary because he knew
[55:45] that this mission
[55:46] no one else was able to do it but he is
[55:49] only the rightful person
[55:51] and the only man who was worthy to
[55:54] redeem back humanity to where he was
[55:56] supposed to be
[55:57] and he came he bled and he died
[56:01] he shed his blood he fulfilled the
[56:03] requirements
[56:05] of that was required to clear up all the
[56:08] debt
[56:09] so the book that god had been holding
[56:11] back
[56:12] throughout all those 4 000 years and it
[56:15] had a lot of debt
[56:16] before it could go back to humanity
[56:18] jesus said i'm going to pay for it
[56:20] i'm paying for it with my life i'm
[56:23] paying it for it
[56:24] with my blood that's why when you went
[56:26] there
[56:27] he gladly said he said it is finished
[56:30] what was he saying
[56:31] in other words he was saying father
[56:33] mission accomplished
[56:34] i have done it i have cleared that debt
[56:38] your sins you see you and me we were not
[56:40] born yet
[56:41] so your sins before you committed them
[56:44] he had already pardoned them
[56:46] and the ones you're going to commit
[56:48] later on in the future
[56:49] he already cleared those up so you
[56:52] cannot
[56:53] walk in the condemnation of the devil
[56:55] you gotta walk
[56:56] you say i am free god said i am free
[57:00] nothing can hold me back not only am i
[57:03] free
[57:03] not only am i sinless but i never done
[57:06] it in the first place
[57:08] i am justified amen imagine someone
[57:11] comes to you
[57:13] and they say um i forgive you for
[57:16] slapping me
[57:18] you cannot forgive me for slapping you
[57:20] because i did not do it
[57:22] i did not slap you in the first place so
[57:24] you cannot forgive me because
[57:26] it didn't happen that's what
[57:28] justification means
[57:30] you never done it in the first place so
[57:33] that's why
[57:33] we can walk knowing that there is no
[57:35] condemnation
[57:36] to us those who have received christ
[57:39] because we know
[57:40] the moment you repent it is
[57:44] removed god cannot remember it
[57:49] i had one testimony one brother went to
[57:51] um brother brown and he said
[57:54] every time i kneeled down to pray he had
[57:56] committed sins before he said every time
[57:58] i kneel down to pray
[57:59] i'm condemned about what i did long back
[58:01] then and i have to kneel down
[58:03] and confess over and over and over again
[58:06] multiple times i pray you know what
[58:08] brother branham told him
[58:10] he says you know what every time you
[58:12] kneel down god is hearing it for the
[58:14] first time
[58:15] because he cannot remember it so if you
[58:19] repent wholeheartedly
[58:22] god cannot remember it so that's why we
[58:25] can walk free
[58:27] knowing that there is no condemnation to
[58:29] us amen
[58:31] and we know god this the book that he
[58:33] was holding
[58:35] jesus had to accomplish this mission
[58:37] first he had to shed his blood
[58:39] and then he had to go and take up the
[58:41] book because he was the only man who was
[58:44] worthy
[58:45] in this book we know god was sitting on
[58:47] the throne and it was sealed
[58:48] with seven seals waiting for the only
[58:51] man that was worthy to claim it
[58:54] no one was found worthy to receive this
[58:57] deed of inheritance but jesus alone
[59:00] so in we read in revelations uh chapter
[59:02] five in verse one
[59:04] it says and i saw in the right hand of
[59:07] him that said on the throne
[59:09] a book written within and on the
[59:12] backside
[59:13] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[59:16] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[59:18] voice
[59:19] who is worthy to open the book and to
[59:21] lose the seals thereof
[59:23] and no man in heaven no in earth
[59:26] neither under the earth was able to open
[59:28] the book
[59:29] neither to look there on no one was
[59:32] worthy
[59:33] and none of the elders said unto and one
[59:36] of the elders said unto me weep not
[59:38] behold the lion of the tribal judah the
[59:41] root of david
[59:42] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[59:45] lose
[59:46] the seals thereof jesus was
[59:49] the well he was the lion of the tribal
[59:51] judah
[59:52] the root of david the only man who was
[59:55] able to open up this book
[59:57] the only man was able to open up these
[59:59] seals
[1:00:00] and we see john was looking at this
[1:00:03] this was he was seeing behind that was
[1:00:06] in time
[1:00:08] everyone had been created so we cannot
[1:00:10] say other people were created afterwards
[1:00:12] after after jesus died who could come
[1:00:14] and claim it no one could
[1:00:16] remember john was seeing the 24 24
[1:00:19] elders
[1:00:20] and he was one of those 24 elders so he
[1:00:23] was seeing
[1:00:24] his theophany over there so everyone had
[1:00:26] been created already
[1:00:28] so there is no man born by a man or
[1:00:31] woman
[1:00:32] that was able to take up this book
[1:00:36] so do not let anyone lie to you that
[1:00:38] someone else
[1:00:39] opened these seals it was only jesus
[1:00:42] christ and christ himself
[1:00:44] and he says the lion of the tribal judah
[1:00:48] the root of david had to prevail to open
[1:00:50] that book
[1:00:51] and to lose the seven seals and behold
[1:00:54] law in the midst
[1:00:55] of the throne and the full beast and in
[1:00:58] the midst of the eldest to the lamb as
[1:01:00] it had been slain
[1:01:01] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:01:03] are the spirits
[1:01:04] seven spirits of god sent forth to all
[1:01:06] the earth
[1:01:07] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:01:10] right hand
[1:01:11] of him that set upon the throne that was
[1:01:13] the lamb of god
[1:01:15] he was the only one and he went and he
[1:01:18] took
[1:01:18] that book because he had cleared up all
[1:01:20] the debt
[1:01:21] that he had accumulated over time and
[1:01:24] the debt
[1:01:25] that was going to be owed afterwards he
[1:01:28] said i have made
[1:01:29] provision of that already that's why
[1:01:31] when he rose up
[1:01:33] on the third day he rose up triumphant
[1:01:36] he knew he had overcome
[1:01:37] death hell and the grave and he came up
[1:01:40] and he stood there
[1:01:41] he rose up as the mighty conqueror he
[1:01:44] knew who he was
[1:01:45] he paid the sins he paid for all the
[1:01:48] sins
[1:01:48] of the old testament saints abraham's
[1:01:51] lying
[1:01:52] davis uh adultery and all of them
[1:01:55] jesus paid for them that's why when they
[1:01:58] were sealed in uh in paradise
[1:02:00] when he rose up he went and he emptied
[1:02:02] the whole paradise
[1:02:03] why because he had gotten back the book
[1:02:06] he was holding the book in his hands
[1:02:08] he had that authority that's why all
[1:02:11] those saints were seen walking on earth
[1:02:13] for 40 days and they were seeing uh
[1:02:15] there was they were seeing abraham adam
[1:02:17] jacob
[1:02:18] and all those saints of old why they
[1:02:21] were happy because the lamb
[1:02:22] was the only one who was worthy to open
[1:02:25] the book
[1:02:26] and he emptied up all paradise and they
[1:02:29] rose up and they had a body change and
[1:02:31] they were raptured into the air
[1:02:33] amen and he changed them from paradise
[1:02:35] and put them in the sixth dimension
[1:02:37] why because he had the book he had that
[1:02:39] authority
[1:02:42] of the title amen i read the prophet of
[1:02:44] god says
[1:02:45] what is this book of redemption this
[1:02:48] title did
[1:02:49] abstract title did you say abstract what
[1:02:52] does abstract mean it searched all the
[1:02:53] way back
[1:02:54] to its beginning like that it's just
[1:02:57] like the drop of ink
[1:02:59] when it's uh dropped in bleach it
[1:03:02] disappears when sin has been confessed
[1:03:05] and fallen into the blood of jesus
[1:03:07] christ
[1:03:08] it gives that abstract right straight
[1:03:10] back to the creator again
[1:03:12] you become a son of god abstract title
[1:03:15] deed is held in the hands of almighty
[1:03:19] its redemption means all legal
[1:03:21] possessions
[1:03:22] to all that was lost by adam and eve
[1:03:26] so the dominion that we read in genesis
[1:03:29] earlier on
[1:03:30] when he took back the book it was being
[1:03:33] given back to you and me
[1:03:35] all those possessions that adam and eve
[1:03:37] had lost it was given back
[1:03:39] to each and every born a green christian
[1:03:42] its
[1:03:42] legal possession to that abstract deed
[1:03:45] the
[1:03:46] deed to eternal life means that you
[1:03:48] possess everything
[1:03:49] that adam and eve lost
[1:03:53] think about it brother the possession of
[1:03:55] that deed
[1:03:56] hey man that's the power of
[1:04:00] that deed the abstract the rights
[1:04:03] given back to the deed the dominion over
[1:04:06] nature
[1:04:07] dominion over all creation dominion
[1:04:10] over our body dominion over all
[1:04:13] atmosphere
[1:04:14] and not only that but dominion over
[1:04:16] demons
[1:04:18] dominion over the devils because the
[1:04:21] abstract
[1:04:21] the rights to the book of the title was
[1:04:24] given back
[1:04:26] to man when jesus christ rose again amen
[1:04:28] and we thank god it took a profit
[1:04:31] to make us understand the contents of
[1:04:33] this book
[1:04:34] right it was traced all the way back
[1:04:37] before creation
[1:04:38] it was that god had already made a
[1:04:40] provision amen
[1:04:42] and we know william branham did not open
[1:04:44] those seals
[1:04:45] it was christ who did he just gave that
[1:04:49] understanding to him so that him as the
[1:04:51] prophet would see it and he would give
[1:04:53] it to the bride
[1:04:54] you and me so those seals are for you
[1:04:58] they are for me so we have to take it
[1:05:00] and walk
[1:05:01] in to our god-given right we have to
[1:05:04] walk into our god-given
[1:05:06] inheritance and take it because we know
[1:05:09] that book
[1:05:10] that's what we need for our victory amen
[1:05:13] but we realize many people they try to
[1:05:16] put
[1:05:17] we see the spirit coming down all the
[1:05:19] way from nimrod
[1:05:20] and all paganism coming down and they
[1:05:23] try to put
[1:05:24] someone else to be uh a mediator
[1:05:28] between between between god and man
[1:05:31] but the only mediator any person who can
[1:05:33] be a mediator
[1:05:34] they have to die for you before a person
[1:05:38] can mediate for any of your prayers or
[1:05:40] mediate for anything
[1:05:42] they have to die because the team of the
[1:05:44] says for there is one god
[1:05:47] and one mediator between god and man
[1:05:50] and that man is christ jesus in hebrews
[1:05:54] 9 15 it says
[1:05:55] and for this course he is the mediator
[1:05:58] of the new testament that by means of
[1:06:01] death
[1:06:02] for the redemption of the transgression
[1:06:04] that we're under the first testament
[1:06:06] they which are called might receive the
[1:06:08] promise of eternal inheritance
[1:06:09] so there is no mediator without death
[1:06:13] there is no mediator without the
[1:06:15] shedding of blood
[1:06:17] so the catholic church can tell you that
[1:06:20] pope he is the vicar
[1:06:22] that's not true only jesus is the
[1:06:24] mediator
[1:06:25] he is the only one who can stand there
[1:06:28] he said
[1:06:29] for you to go to the father you have to
[1:06:31] come through me i am the only way to go
[1:06:33] to him
[1:06:34] so muhammad is not the way to god buddha
[1:06:37] is not the way to god
[1:06:39] i repeat the pope is not the way to god
[1:06:42] but it is only jesus we realize each and
[1:06:45] every organization
[1:06:46] they try to put someone right there the
[1:06:49] moment they try to put someone right
[1:06:50] there
[1:06:51] just know your prayer is going nowhere
[1:06:54] that's where all is finished all your
[1:06:56] harsh desires they are finished
[1:06:58] right there you are just telling another
[1:07:00] human being
[1:07:02] and we see the message is also not
[1:07:05] prone it's it's it's not immune to this
[1:07:08] system
[1:07:09] people want to put a mediator between
[1:07:12] people and god
[1:07:14] that does not work that is any
[1:07:17] any spirit that tries to put a mediator
[1:07:19] between god and man
[1:07:20] that's the spirit of antichrist and that
[1:07:23] will not work
[1:07:24] the only person who can stand right
[1:07:27] there is
[1:07:28] jesus and jesus christ himself the
[1:07:30] prophet was there
[1:07:31] to point us to jesus christ and that's
[1:07:34] where we look up to
[1:07:35] because he is the one who is going to
[1:07:37] give us that book he is the only one who
[1:07:39] was worthy to take it
[1:07:41] and give it to us and give us back the
[1:07:43] right of that title
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:48] people trying to trivialize god by by
[1:07:52] praying to mary hail mary and all that
[1:07:55] that does not work
[1:07:59] we only pray to god and the only way to
[1:08:03] go
[1:08:03] to god is through jesus amen
[1:08:06] read the prophet and you see the
[1:08:08] mediator of the new testament
[1:08:11] and now i want to read um the prophet of
[1:08:14] god says
[1:08:17] when you've become a christian listen
[1:08:19] god provide a place of worship
[1:08:20] and when you become a christian and
[1:08:22] accept christ as your savior
[1:08:24] then when god sends down the abstract it
[1:08:26] shows you that no matter what your
[1:08:28] father did
[1:08:29] or your mother did what anybody else did
[1:08:32] your mother daddy might have been
[1:08:34] drunkards prostitutes
[1:08:36] whatever it was every scene is tricking
[1:08:39] off
[1:08:40] you've got an abstract title there's
[1:08:43] nothing that can
[1:08:44] put you off of it so your past
[1:08:47] cannot define your future your past does
[1:08:51] not define you
[1:08:52] the person who gave birth to you does
[1:08:55] not define who you are
[1:08:57] so what matters is your name is written
[1:08:59] in the book
[1:09:01] that's the contents of the book before
[1:09:03] the foundation of the world your name
[1:09:04] was put in the book
[1:09:06] amen before you were born jeremiah god
[1:09:09] told jeremiah that before you were
[1:09:11] formed
[1:09:11] in the belly of your mother i had known
[1:09:13] you
[1:09:15] i remember one brother he was he he was
[1:09:18] he
[1:09:18] he was uh struggling he didn't
[1:09:20] understand he was saying
[1:09:22] i don't know you know my parents uh
[1:09:25] he had he had a bad background he didn't
[1:09:27] know where he was coming from
[1:09:29] but this is the quote right there it is
[1:09:31] telling you
[1:09:32] it does not matter who your parents were
[1:09:35] so long your name was written in the
[1:09:37] book
[1:09:38] you have to get your own personal
[1:09:40] salvation
[1:09:41] even if you were born in the message you
[1:09:44] have to be born by the blood you have to
[1:09:47] be born
[1:09:48] by jesus christ himself amen
[1:09:52] god does not have grandchildren you have
[1:09:55] to have your own
[1:09:56] personal experience it doesn't matter
[1:09:59] who
[1:10:01] probably you have three generations in
[1:10:02] the message that does not save you
[1:10:04] either
[1:10:05] you have to have your own experience
[1:10:08] because
[1:10:08] that own experience you're going to
[1:10:10] recognize that my name is in the book
[1:10:13] and when you recognize that my name is
[1:10:15] in the book you are
[1:10:16] entitled to that title deed you are
[1:10:19] entitled to the abstract
[1:10:20] of that title deed amen that's what we
[1:10:24] gotta know
[1:10:24] in the revelations chapter 10 verse 8
[1:10:28] says
[1:10:30] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:10:33] spake unto me again and said go take
[1:10:36] the little book which is open in the
[1:10:38] hand of the angel
[1:10:40] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:10:42] earth
[1:10:45] this was a commandment to to john and we
[1:10:48] know john was a tap of the bride
[1:10:50] right so the bride is being commanded
[1:10:53] he says and i went
[1:10:56] unto the angel and unto him and said
[1:10:58] give me the little book
[1:11:00] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:11:03] up
[1:11:03] and it shall make thy belly bitter and
[1:11:05] he shall be in thy mouth
[1:11:07] sweet as honey can you go to verse 10.
[1:11:12] and he says and i took the little book
[1:11:15] out of the angel's hand and ate it up
[1:11:17] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:11:19] and as soon as i eaten it
[1:11:20] my belly was bitter can you give us
[1:11:22] verse eight
[1:11:28] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:11:30] speak unto me again
[1:11:32] and say go and take that little book
[1:11:34] which is open
[1:11:35] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:11:38] upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:11:40] that was the covenant angel the all the
[1:11:43] debt had been cleared out
[1:11:45] the book was now ready to be given back
[1:11:47] to the bride
[1:11:48] so the bride is getting that commandment
[1:11:51] you go
[1:11:52] take up that book and you eat it
[1:11:55] we know we become what we eat so when
[1:11:58] you take that book
[1:11:59] which is the word and you eat it you
[1:12:02] become the word
[1:12:03] because that's what you were supposed to
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:07] that book was not meant for god when god
[1:12:10] gave that book for adam it was for men
[1:12:12] to use
[1:12:13] but he had taken it up because adam had
[1:12:15] lost it so
[1:12:16] now he was finding a way to give it back
[1:12:18] to man
[1:12:19] and now this was the opportune time
[1:12:21] after jesus had cleared the debt
[1:12:23] and he took it and now he is giving it
[1:12:25] to the bride to say you take the book
[1:12:28] you eat it up because that is yours so
[1:12:31] now john is representing the bride and
[1:12:32] we know
[1:12:33] we gotta eat the book we gotta listen to
[1:12:36] the word of god
[1:12:37] we gotta study those scriptures because
[1:12:39] that's what
[1:12:40] how we're gonna know what authority we
[1:12:42] have
[1:12:43] we're gonna know we have authority over
[1:12:45] devils we got authority over our own
[1:12:47] bodies
[1:12:48] we have authority over our trials why
[1:12:51] because
[1:12:51] the book tells us the abstract it tells
[1:12:54] us
[1:12:54] the authority that we have amen
[1:12:58] so that's why we gotta constantly hear
[1:13:00] the voice of god
[1:13:02] constantly hear the word of god
[1:13:04] constantly study
[1:13:05] the word of god because this book is for
[1:13:08] a special people
[1:13:09] called the bride and we here when we
[1:13:12] listen to that word
[1:13:14] we hear the voice of god everyone else
[1:13:16] they don't hear the voice of god
[1:13:18] do you remember when paul when he was on
[1:13:20] his road to damascus
[1:13:22] and that great light shone and then
[1:13:24] there was that thunder and he fell off
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:27] i don't know what he was writing donkey
[1:13:28] or mew and he fell down
[1:13:30] the people who were around him they did
[1:13:33] not hear a voice
[1:13:34] they just had thunder why because it was
[1:13:37] not
[1:13:38] meant for them it was meant for paul
[1:13:41] so each and every generation there is a
[1:13:44] people who are selected
[1:13:46] to hear the voice of god there is a
[1:13:48] people
[1:13:49] who are selected to hear what god is
[1:13:52] saying for that age
[1:13:54] and we know in this last day we have a
[1:13:56] light that appeared
[1:13:58] in this day many people don't know what
[1:14:00] that light is
[1:14:01] pretty sure it is you find it over the
[1:14:03] internet and everywhere
[1:14:04] but people don't know what it is and
[1:14:06] when they hear that prophet speak
[1:14:08] they just hear things they don't know
[1:14:10] what it is but because
[1:14:11] you and me we are that bride we can tell
[1:14:15] that that's a god speaking through the
[1:14:17] voice of a man
[1:14:18] and we take it for us because you and me
[1:14:20] we are the people
[1:14:22] who are selected to listen to this word
[1:14:25] we are the people we are the bride who
[1:14:27] has to take this book
[1:14:28] and eat it up so we know who we are
[1:14:32] amen because
[1:14:35] we did not become sons you and me we do
[1:14:38] not become sons and daughters
[1:14:39] when we got converted when we gave our
[1:14:42] life to christ no
[1:14:43] we became sons before the foundation of
[1:14:46] the world
[1:14:47] but when you met when you made that
[1:14:49] decision
[1:14:50] to say i want christ to be my personal
[1:14:52] savior
[1:14:53] that was you realizing that you were a
[1:14:56] son
[1:14:57] so it had already happened you were only
[1:14:59] waiting for that time
[1:15:00] when god was going to remove scales on
[1:15:02] your eyes and realize who you were
[1:15:05] and realize your true identity that you
[1:15:08] know
[1:15:08] i am a son of god but you were a son
[1:15:11] already
[1:15:11] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:15:15] so we gotta walk in that light knowing
[1:15:17] who we are
[1:15:18] we gotta walk knowing that we are sons
[1:15:21] and daughters of god
[1:15:22] we have the abstract of that book we
[1:15:25] have the authority over this earth
[1:15:27] we have the authority of the nature amen
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] the prophet god says in um
[1:15:35] in god's provide a place of worship he
[1:15:36] says now a crinsman he handed the
[1:15:38] seventh sealed book of redemption
[1:15:40] from the original honor when we lost it
[1:15:43] in the garden of eden through
[1:15:44] adam it went back to the original honor
[1:15:47] but there's been a portrait
[1:15:49] on the land a squatter and that's satan
[1:15:53] he came over he is a torture the earth
[1:15:56] does not belong to him
[1:15:58] it belongs to god but satan is the
[1:16:01] portrait
[1:16:02] he is a squatter he does not deserve to
[1:16:06] live
[1:16:06] there the earth was created for men to
[1:16:10] dwell there
[1:16:11] and have dominion over all living things
[1:16:14] so but now we know satan as the god of
[1:16:17] this evil age
[1:16:18] that's not his rightful place
[1:16:22] he's trying to take our positions he is
[1:16:24] trying to take our rights
[1:16:26] he's trying to take our dominion but he
[1:16:29] is a poacher
[1:16:30] he is a squatter and he is not the
[1:16:32] rightful owner of that place
[1:16:35] amen and you see that title deed of our
[1:16:37] redemption
[1:16:39] it gives us back that authority
[1:16:42] and when he broke those seals it reveals
[1:16:45] and gives us the inheritance
[1:16:47] to his people he gives the inheritance
[1:16:50] that he
[1:16:50] inherited becoming the kinsmen redeemer
[1:16:53] and he freely gives it to us
[1:16:55] it all belonged to him he was the one
[1:16:58] who redeemed
[1:16:59] hey man but instead of keeping it for
[1:17:02] himself
[1:17:02] he gave it back to the people because
[1:17:05] the book
[1:17:06] was not for god to keep the book was for
[1:17:08] you and me to use
[1:17:09] amen hallelujah and we were just reading
[1:17:13] that satan is a torture
[1:17:14] he is not the rightful owner you know if
[1:17:17] if you had if you had uh
[1:17:19] if you had a piece of land and there is
[1:17:21] a title due to it
[1:17:22] maybe the there is a lot of debt that
[1:17:26] happened and is taken away from you
[1:17:29] and that someone else comes in and move
[1:17:32] on that land
[1:17:34] maybe it was a bear land and they start
[1:17:36] building whatever they're building
[1:17:38] and they take over land now it's theirs
[1:17:41] but one thing they forgot the title deed
[1:17:45] has your name on it you are the rightful
[1:17:48] honor to that title deed
[1:17:50] so you can go back anytime all you need
[1:17:54] if there is a land
[1:17:55] dispute they ask for the title deed
[1:17:58] they're asking who has the title deed
[1:18:01] and when they get the title d
[1:18:02] they're going to open it and check the
[1:18:04] abstract
[1:18:06] all the names that are written in that
[1:18:08] title did
[1:18:09] and the last name if your last name is
[1:18:12] there
[1:18:13] and your name is in that title deed it
[1:18:15] doesn't matter
[1:18:16] whom you were arguing with or whom
[1:18:18] you're having a conflict with
[1:18:20] that person has to leave they are
[1:18:23] legally a squatter
[1:18:25] it doesn't matter that title deed might
[1:18:26] be getting it might be so old and it's
[1:18:28] almost
[1:18:30] tearing up what matters is is your name
[1:18:33] there
[1:18:34] and i'm here to tell you that that book
[1:18:37] that christ
[1:18:38] opened the seals your name was there
[1:18:41] before the foundation of the world so
[1:18:44] you're right god's promises they are
[1:18:48] yours satan might be has been trying to
[1:18:51] block you and say no don't go there
[1:18:53] but i'm here to tell you you go walk
[1:18:55] right into it
[1:18:56] that is your god-given inheritance that
[1:18:59] is
[1:18:59] your god-given right it doesn't matter
[1:19:02] how the devil has been there
[1:19:03] whoever the people were did they already
[1:19:05] build buildings and they put
[1:19:08] some valuation to it and they put their
[1:19:10] names maybe they say we are the will
[1:19:12] sons
[1:19:12] i hope there's no wilson listening to it
[1:19:14] to this and they say we are the wilsons
[1:19:16] it doesn't matter they have fenced it
[1:19:18] around and put a wall around it
[1:19:20] if you just have a deed you gotta walk
[1:19:22] in right there
[1:19:23] and you say this is my land this
[1:19:27] is my property and the government the
[1:19:29] law enforcement has to back you up
[1:19:32] because the law see you can enforce it
[1:19:35] the law has to
[1:19:36] enforce the squatters off your land
[1:19:39] and we are glad we have the holy ghost
[1:19:41] as our enforcer
[1:19:43] it never fails hey man so all those
[1:19:46] promises of god
[1:19:47] i'm walking in with that title dude i
[1:19:50] know i'm telling satan
[1:19:51] you live of that land that is my
[1:19:54] rightful place
[1:19:55] christ paid for it with his blood before
[1:19:58] the foundation of the world
[1:20:00] he put my name in his will and he said
[1:20:02] that is mine
[1:20:03] so i'm taking it up and i'm saying it is
[1:20:06] mine
[1:20:06] i don't care how satan has been staying
[1:20:09] there it is time for you to leave
[1:20:11] you gotta tell him satan this is my land
[1:20:14] you go
[1:20:15] maybe satan has been sitting on your
[1:20:17] health for so long
[1:20:19] he's been sitting on your health for 20
[1:20:21] years that does not matter
[1:20:23] the title deed says by my stripes you
[1:20:27] were healed
[1:20:28] so you walk in and you say satan get off
[1:20:31] my health
[1:20:32] that is my rightful property that is my
[1:20:36] rightful inheritance god says
[1:20:39] it is mine amen in isaiah says
[1:20:43] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:20:45] prosper
[1:20:46] and right after that scripture says
[1:20:48] that's the inheritance
[1:20:50] to god's children that's our inheritance
[1:20:53] so nowhere performed against you shall
[1:20:55] prosper
[1:20:55] that is an inheritance which is in the
[1:20:58] book
[1:20:58] so you gotta take it and you walk in and
[1:21:02] you say
[1:21:02] satan the weapon you're formed against
[1:21:04] me it is not going to work
[1:21:06] i have the right to enforce it i have
[1:21:09] the holy ghost backing me up
[1:21:11] it has to enforce it you gotta go
[1:21:14] you ain't staying you probably been
[1:21:16] fighting trials
[1:21:17] addictions for so long and the satan is
[1:21:20] sitting right there
[1:21:22] he has already changed and you don't
[1:21:23] think you can go free anymore
[1:21:25] but that does not matter at all just
[1:21:28] take the title data
[1:21:30] and you walk you can start pacing around
[1:21:33] the whole perimeter
[1:21:34] because you know i own this land it is
[1:21:37] mine
[1:21:38] the deed says it is mine my name is
[1:21:42] written there
[1:21:43] so satan you gotta go i don't care how
[1:21:46] long you've lived
[1:21:47] i don't care how long you have tormented
[1:21:49] me but it's high time
[1:21:51] you are a squatter i'm enforcing the
[1:21:54] holy ghost
[1:21:55] and you gotta go so you know what your
[1:21:59] property is
[1:22:00] put a name to that property and you say
[1:22:03] satan
[1:22:04] it's high time maybe you're praying for
[1:22:06] your loved one
[1:22:07] you for them to see the light you've
[1:22:09] been praying for them for so long
[1:22:11] and satan is staying right there you
[1:22:13] gotta walk in and say i'm claiming
[1:22:15] my loved ones satan you get up you gotta
[1:22:19] go
[1:22:20] i have the right when christ died on
[1:22:22] cover and said it is finished
[1:22:25] he gave you back the abstract to that
[1:22:27] title he gave you back the rights to
[1:22:29] that title
[1:22:30] so you can enforce it and the devil has
[1:22:33] no
[1:22:33] other option but to leave because
[1:22:37] the title is being enforced by the holy
[1:22:39] ghost and that is god himself
[1:22:42] you have that authority amen it has your
[1:22:45] name on it
[1:22:46] you have that power you have the
[1:22:48] authority
[1:22:49] you know in ads it says when they were
[1:22:52] praying for the holy ghost
[1:22:54] they got power the greek translation
[1:22:56] calls that power
[1:22:57] authority so when you receive the holy
[1:23:00] ghost
[1:23:01] you have that authority when you receive
[1:23:05] the holy ghost
[1:23:06] you are taking that book and you are
[1:23:08] claiming that authority
[1:23:10] and you gotta use it for whatever you
[1:23:12] need you gotta use it
[1:23:14] when satan is tormenting you when satan
[1:23:16] is coming against you amen
[1:23:19] hallelujah you gotta receive it because
[1:23:21] you know
[1:23:22] it is yours you have authority to claim
[1:23:25] back that property because it is yours
[1:23:28] it is rightfully yours amen
[1:23:32] the state is obligated to enforce that
[1:23:35] title
[1:23:37] so long your name is on it if they don't
[1:23:40] want to move there
[1:23:41] we'll be prosecuted and we know satan is
[1:23:44] going to be prosecuted for all he's done
[1:23:46] he is going to burn in the lake of fire
[1:23:48] because of
[1:23:49] all because of all the squattering he's
[1:23:52] been doing
[1:23:53] he gotta go he is going to pay for what
[1:23:56] he has done for you
[1:23:57] he's going to pay for what he did to you
[1:23:59] that sickness that you had
[1:24:01] don't worry about it he's going to pay
[1:24:02] for it why because he was a squatter
[1:24:05] staying where he is not supposed to stay
[1:24:07] your body you were made to serve god
[1:24:10] you were not made to suffer when you
[1:24:12] were standing rather you say satan you
[1:24:14] are squattering
[1:24:15] and he's going to have to pay for it if
[1:24:17] he refuses to go
[1:24:19] he will pay for it he will be prosecuted
[1:24:22] the holy ghost is the best enforcer
[1:24:24] there is
[1:24:25] amen two thousand years ago that title
[1:24:28] was taken back
[1:24:29] and put into our hands on the day of
[1:24:31] pentecost when they got that authority
[1:24:34] they were able to chase demons they were
[1:24:36] a peter was able to say
[1:24:38] silver and gold they have none but what
[1:24:40] i have i gave to you
[1:24:42] what was it talking about it was that
[1:24:44] authority he had
[1:24:45] that deed placed in his hands amen
[1:24:48] so you got to stand right there and say
[1:24:50] i'm taking my inheritance
[1:24:52] i'm taking back everything that belongs
[1:24:55] to me
[1:24:56] amen because why the title did say so
[1:25:01] if the squad asks you what right do you
[1:25:05] have
[1:25:05] or what authority are you coming here
[1:25:07] with you say
[1:25:08] the title did say so why the title did
[1:25:12] say
[1:25:13] so i am sick i want to be healed why
[1:25:16] the title did say so amen i have lost
[1:25:19] my faith why can i gain it back the
[1:25:22] title did
[1:25:23] say so you are highly favored you are a
[1:25:27] son
[1:25:27] you are a daughter of god you are a
[1:25:29] chosen generation why
[1:25:31] because the title did say so you are
[1:25:34] above and not beneath
[1:25:36] why the title did say so so you don't
[1:25:39] have to live under your privilege
[1:25:42] people done did it already but now we
[1:25:44] have it in our hands
[1:25:45] so we got to use it to our own advantage
[1:25:48] because
[1:25:49] we know god prepared and made that way
[1:25:51] back
[1:25:52] for you and me to be able to get that
[1:25:55] abstract to get those rights and that
[1:25:58] authority
