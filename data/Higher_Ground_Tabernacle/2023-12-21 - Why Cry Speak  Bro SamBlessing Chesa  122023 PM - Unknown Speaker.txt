everyone was able to make it amen amen in as much as we might say if you want to stay home stay [Music] home no preacher wants to preach CH amen I believe God will reward all of your efforts whilst we standing let us open our Bibles to the Book of Exodus in chapter 14 14 B reads and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the [Music] wilderness wherefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness me you can take your seats we continue reading you SE in the in the scripture that we reading the children of Israel were about to cross the Red Sea and they saw the enemy drawing up close to them and they started shaking they started crying to say why are we being delivered we were better off where we were at amen they forgot all the goodness that God had done for them they forgot all the Miracles that had happened their first bones did not die they forgot about that at the first sight of danger they were crying and whining and they forgot what God did for them in verse 13 Moses said unto the people fear not stand still and see the Salvation which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more amen amen Moses was speaking with authority he was speaking as a man who has been commissioned because he knew the God he had met on the backside of the Des the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen amen verse 14 he says the Lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore CEST thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen amen my title this evening is why cist speak amen amen this is what the Lord was telling Moses after all the Miracles you've seen me do I have never forsaken you before why are you crying today amen amen stop crying speak the word speak the word and go forth that's all you have to do you don't have to worry what's going to happen after you speak the word because he's the one who's doing the work amen amen Moses knew he had met the god of Abraham he met God of Isaac that's how God introduced himself to AB when he was saying I'm the god of Abraham the first thought that would get into their head was what did this God accomplish in Abraham's life what did this God accomplish in Isaac's life what did he accomplish in Jacob's life we know Abraham is the father of Faith all the victories he won they were all attributed to God so God was bragging on Abraham he was bragging on Isaac and Jacob say I am their God God wants to do the same thing with you he wants to be your God so why are you crying speak the word he is the one who's doing the work he is the one performing The Miracles amen amen because he's the god of the again God of president if he did it before he can do it again Sarah was Barren for 25 years sah and she got a baby God waited until it came to a point in time where it was impossible medically it's impossible for a woman that old to Bear children but God waited until then and she gave birth to Isaac Rebecca was also Barren for 20 years but they believe the god of Abraham and Sarah could do it again God opened the womb of Rebecca what he did for Sarah he did for Rebecca Rael was also Barren for 14 years but they did not give hope because they knew the god of Abraham and Sarah the god of Isaac and Rebecca if he could open their womb she knew my womb could be open too you are no different this evening if God Did It for Abraham and Sarah Isaac and Rebecca Jacob and Rachel he can do the same thing for you this because he is the god of the aain Hallelujah Hallelujah so when Moses was there he knew he was speaking he had been sent by the god of Abraham so if he did that before for Abraham he knew he could do that in his ministry too he knew he had a commission he was anointed and he did not worry about what was going to happen after he spoke because it was all up to God so you and me this evening we have a commission God gives you a commission he anoints you for that job he gives you action to go carry out what he has brought you here for in paragraph 30 of why Christ [Music] speak the prophet of God says Moses was born in this world GI boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with equipment born in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment is I firmly believe in the for knowledge the predestination as I firmly believe in full knowledge and predestination so when you were born on this Earth God gave you everything that you needed for your commission he has given you the anointing that you need to overcome everything you need for the Rapture is lying in you you just have to realize that God has given you the equipment he has equipped you to carry out that commission what's your commission why are you crying don't cry you speak the word hallelujah hallelujah because he gave us the authority so Moses knew he had that commission he was not afraid he spoke with authority he spoke with confidence amen because he was anointed he was given that commission by the Lord and when God gives you the commission he doesn't leave you to go alone he comes with you because he's the one who's going to do it in the Old Testament they called him God With Us they called him God above us amen he was close to them so when they would go to carry out the commission they knew God was above them but we are in the New Testament it's a different Covenant Al together when God sends you he doesn't come above you he comes right inside of you and he's the one to do it because he doesn't want you to mess it up so all you have to do realize you have that commission amen Paul said approach boldly Before the Throne of God because you know you are anointed for the job has equipped you with everything that you need so there is not enough devils not enough demons that can stand in your way amen amen and when God gives you a commission make sure you do it God's way you do it your own way you are determined Moses tried it his own way he wanted to deliver one man and he ended up failing he had the right Revelation but he was going about it the wrong way he failed and the children of Israel ended up being in bondage for 430 years instead of 400 [Music] years because Moses was trying to put maters into into his own hand don't do it by yourself do it God God's way and you are guaranteed of his success he will see you through amen and the children of Israel had always been seeing God's miracles in their life a chosen nation and you know we Are Spiritual Israel all the promises that God gave to Abraham they appli to you and me amen amen the Covenant God gave Abraham it applies to us as well why because the Bible tells us that we are the Seed of Abraham and we realize after the children of Israel had crossed the Red Sea they came to a point in time it was dry they didn't have have any water and they forgot again that The God Who had opened the Red Sea The God Who had given them provision he was able to do the same thing again because he is the god of the again in numbers 20 chapter 8 God told Moses take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and th and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and he shall give forth his water he didn't say cry to the rock you speak to that rock and it will give you water amen bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou sh give the congregation and their Beast drink we know Moses ended up beating that rock but that was not the Commandment the Commandment was for him to speak because that was God's way of provision he was providing what they lack because he had a covenant with them he told when he introduced himself to Moses Moses said who are you God says I am that I am that was a covenant name I am means becoming becoming then it's blank why would he leave it blank that's for you to fill out that blank he was saying I am becoming your provider not was but becoming means today that's why he gave them the seven compound Redemptive names I I am your provider whenever you I need I'll give it to you whenever you in battle I am Shalom I will give you peace I am Jehovah I give you Victory whenever you are sick I'm Jehovah Rafa The God Who heals all your diseases it does not matter what it is he knows no defeat he says I'm I'm Ro I'm your Shepherd whenever you are lost you call on his name hallelujah hallelujah he says I'm Jehovah Jehovah my righteousness it does not matter how many times I fall but when I fall I pick myself and I keep on going because I know he is my righteous hallelujah hallelujah he is Jehovah sh he is there for you when all your friends walk out on you when all your family walks out on you he is there for you just call on his name that was the Covenant in the Old Testament but now in the New Testament you don't have to remember all those names you just have to call on the name of Jesus he is my all and all he is my Shalom shom he is my he is my whenever you need anything call on the name Jesus hallelujah hallelujah someone said he is my bridge over water he's the doctor in the sick room when the doctors don't know how to he is the greatest doctor you got to trust that doctor amen amen the prophet of God gives us this analogy he says if you are given two doctors one who's pretty young with Sleek hair and one who's old who do you choose you don't got to think about it I'm GNA pick the one who's got more experience I'm going to look at how you look because I need to live I'm not trying to die I'm trying to survive so I'll call on the one who has more and no one has more experience than doctor Jesus he has never failed one operation he has never failed to heal one person amen Amen brother Keith when you walked into that doctor and said you got cancer Dr Jesus came around and says no no no no no you don't got cancer why because that was Doctor Jesus call him on the scene he will transform your life he will change everything amen you can call him my lawyer in the cour he's both lawyer and judge after advocating for you you come around and you'll say not guilty did not do it in the first place so it doesn't matter how much wrong you do how much how many crimes you commit call on lawyer Jesus he will take you out and give you a blank slate and say you never done it in the first place amen someone say he's water when I'm thirsty bread when I'm hungry amen Jesus he is Sovereign what does Sovereign means it means he has the authority that supersedes everyone everyone might have a say in your life everyone might have a say in what you were going through they allowed to have a say but because Jesus is Sovereign they might have a say but he has the say because he because he is Sovereign Hallelujah so whatever verdict that is given he has the power to overrule it because he is Sovereign amen amen I thank God that I saved a sovereign Master whenever I'm in need I don't cry I just got to call him on the scene and he will turn it around he will overr whatever the enemy says amen amen how many can say I'm standing here because he had the final say life tried to throw a lot of things at me but I'm still standing here the enemy tried to fight me standing here if Circumstances had their way I wouldn't be standing here but thank God for the victory I'm standing because he has the final I made a lot of mistakes I probably lied a lot of times but my lifee didn't have the final say my mistake did not have the final say Sovereign Jesus had call him on the scene he has the final say in your life hallelujah hallelujah heai the all sufficient one where you can draw your strength draw your strength you can draw your life the scripture we read the children of Israel we expecting water to come out of a rock I've done geography biology chemistry and physics water does not come out of rocks that are on the [Music] surface science does not prove that you have to go so many meters deep down under to get water that's Underground but you don't get water out of a rock that's out here say it's dry as a rock but in that rock situation God say you speak water has to come out of here I don't care what rock situation you have in your life speak to that rock and it will give forth water and water represents life amen God can Quicken that rock situation God can Quicken that rock marriage of yours whatever you are going through speak to that rock speak to that dead circumstance speak to your dead finances speak to your health that's dying God can Quicken it and he will bring life stop crying don't cry about it just speak speak the word the one who will do it amen amen rocks don't give out water but when God is involed things are different am just call him on the scene say Lord I'm involving you I'm inviting you into my situation I'm inviting you into my dead Christian Life and he can Quicken it hallelujah hallelujah he has got no limits you can say I'm having uh my relationships with my with my family are dying invite him in speak to that situation speak to that relationship God will bring life into he has got no limits hallelujah hallelujah you might say I'm not dead I'm still alive but probably your joy is dead speak the word he can bring life to your joy he can bring life to your death amen am you are saying I'm having lack just speak the word I'm having depression I'm having anxiety speak to that rock you saying I don't have a job my job situation is [Music] Rock speak to that job situation speak to that circumstance God can overturn it he will overrule it why because he is Sovereign and you have been given the commission and you have been anointed for the job to speak nothing can stand in your way because it's not you who's doing it God who's doing it in you so you can speak and go sleep cuz I don't care how it's going to happen he taking care of it he just told me to speak so that's what we got to do this evening that's our job stop crying and speak the word hallelujah hallelujah David was anointed he was anointed to be king but after he was anointed he went back in the middle of of nowhere where he was hurting sheep whilst he was hurting ship prophet Samuel visited the house of Jesse Jess and he called for all of Jesse's Sons Jesse as the father he started looking around at which one could be the king and he picked out sh and all of them they came the Horn of oil did not pour oil and they said we are done they all of they're done all of them Jesse was not even considering David amen amen then the prophet Samuel asked are you sure this is all of them he says oh there's one little boy who's who's out there in the field that was the that was the the one of the worst jobs you could do because David's all the brothers were being trained in the army prestigious status I'm a soldier I'm in the Army and David was just a little sheer his own father did not even consider him the prophet of God said call that young boy that shepher boy to what happened when he came he knelt right there out of that one it doesn't matter who comes before you no one can take your blessing it doesn't matter who's first in line no one can take it away from you what yours is yours you might be the last one in the interview for a job if that job is yours no one can take it from hallelujah hallelujah your blessings got a name on it even if you come in very late it's still yours no one can take your anointing from your anointing is predestinated for you and you alone because you have been commissioned for the job hallelujah hallelujah my blessings God my name on it you can take it from me I can't take your blessing from you because your blessings got your name on it and when you know you are anointed you start walking different you start having a certain level of confidence you are a man on a mission when you are on a mission you know it's not your own you are representing the one who is sent so if I come in any problems you see that's why countries are not allowed to arrest ambassadors if an ambassador commits a crime in a different country they have to call the government of that Ambassador say hey your guy here we're having problems with him come get him they cannot touch you amen amen when Christ commissions you you are an ambassador in this world there is no devil that has a right no sickness has a claim on life no one can lay their hand on you because they are not allowed they have to go through the boss first so you can walk however way you want amen amen because you were commissioned ambassad for Christ hallelujah hallelujah can you give us uh the next quot paragraph 257 the prophet of God say David he knew he was anointed and was Vindicated to be a good Shar he know that they knew he was a good shot David was anointed and knew it and when he stood before Goliath he never cried oh God what must I do now he just said I know what you did in the past times you let me kill a bear you let me kill a lion what about this Goliath out here he never cried never that he just spoke and he told Goliath you will be just like what they were amen amen why was David so confident you know when he knelt down in the house of his father Jesse he was anointed to be a king so there was nothing that was going to take David's life until he became a king so his anointing was his protection he could get Reckless he could go fight lions because he knew that anointing was protecting him his commission was protecting him he could go fight Bears no bear could kill him because he knew he was anointed and though after being anointed he went back into the to to head sheep and he continued that he didn't rush for it you got to be patient for your blessing God's timing God's timing is the best in your life know what and when is best for you his father called him and say go give food to your to your brothers who are in the and he went he was door dashing some food and he got there he sees all the soldiers from the King to the very last one they are running away they are hiding from Goliath and he asked who is that who is defying the name of the Living God they told him oh is this this man called David remembered I have an anointing he was anointed to be king even if you ran towards the giant nothing was going to happen why because he was not going to die until he became king his anointing was his protection the anointing on your life is your protection nothing will happen to you until God is done with you the prophet of God says you will not leave 5 minutes longer on this Earth after you have accomplish your purpose so so long you are looking at me right now so long you are breathing right now God's not yet done with you God's not yet done with you you got to accomplish that commission he gave amen amen so David that's why he went and he says what's going to be given to the man who fights this guy he already knew he already knew the outcome why because he was anointed he was commissioned amen amen and he says this man who's speaking he's not circumcised and he's not under the the the Abraham Covenant and he remembered that the Father the that Father Abraham was given a covenant that says you shall possess the gates of all your enemies he knew Abraham's blood was flowing in his veins so the Covenant that God had with Abraham he knew it applied to him too so that's why he said what's going to be done to the man who kills this he says I'll go they try to give him swords and Spears he says I'm not used to this I'm only used to speaking the word that's all I do amen amen and then he he saw goath gol says go go why are you insulting me sending me a little boy but he did not know that little boy was the end of him that little boy was anointed to kill Goliath it doesn't matter how small you are compared to your problem it doesn't matter how big your problem is go fight it you are anointed to overcoming because you are anointed you are anointed to be an overcomer so just go anyhow just go anyway you get that Victory you have an anointing on your life amen amen that's why he spoke the word and he says what you said you will do to me what you said you will do to me that's what I'm going to do to you he took his slingshot and the Bible says David ran towards Goliath he did not walk he ran because he knew that was victory that was certain he slung That Swing Shot he swung it he swung it looking at the enemy he say today today you will die amen he swung that swingshot and let it go he didn't have to care care for a perfect aim because there was an anointing on his life anointing was responsible to take that stone bring it to the forehead of Goliath hallelujah hallelujah so I don't care what you are going through just sling it speak the word sling that word to your problem hallelujah hallelujah swing that sling it until you overcome sling it until you are delivered sling it until you get your breakthrough sling it until you are set free hallelujah hallelujah sling it until you get [Music] healed cuz the victory is yours remember we serve a god of the again if he did it before he can do it again when David smart Goliath that was the only battle that was fought all the Philistines ran away and we hear the the prophet he talks about when he was in Oregon and he was preaching then this man here comes up to him and he starts threatening [Music] him and he spoke words saying today I'm going to beat you today I'm going to kill you the way he describes it you see a a picture of David and Goliath and the prophet of God say he lost control and he heard himself say today you will lay at my feet he didn't have to sling he didn't have to to to throw a physical Stone but he spoke the word when he spoke that word that giant man fell down and laid PR It On The Ground the same way the Philistines ran away when Goliath died the prophet of God says in this meeting there was no prayer line that was held cuz as soon as that man fell down demons flew away wheelchairs started people jumping out of wheelchair blind eyes were open why because the chief of them demons were destroyed if God Did It for David if God Did It for William Bram he can do the same thing for you sling that word to your Giants all flee away amen amen if he did it before he can do it again because we serve the god of the again the god of presidence we have a commission the commission is to speak speak the word he will do it amen amen if you can uh give us um paragraph 290 paragraph the prophet of God says pardon this but it's just coming up in me I've got to say it it was that he said that day up there inside the woods was saying the voice said you have no game and he created three spir standing there before us what is it just speaking the word and say they'll be there and there and there they was it was that did that amen amen it was God who created those spirs the prophet's job was just to speak say I want a over there I want another one over there and another one over there and he was given his three squirel by what by the spoken word he didn't cry he didn't start rolling in the ground the word why are you crying speak the word and at around this time if you listen in the message the prophet talks about his ministry changing he says I'm waiting for that third pool Ministry hallelujah hallelujah this was the beginning of the third pool Min to speak and things will happen and that was not just for the man only it was not for the prophet only but he was a she waving God showing that in as much as I have done this in that man I can do the same thing in your life am so you might not be a hunted this evening but you know what your spirit is so just speak to it and it did not just happen once it happened two times one it was three squirels the other time it was five square rolls making it a total of eight squirels God does not do things haard amen and we know eight is the number of new things eight is the number of new beginnings Hallelujah that was the beginning of the third pool ministry that's why when he was a sister had to right his house he said what is your heart's desire and he spoke the word God was the one was responsible to make sure that that word comes to pass it doesn't matter how far the where these boys were they had to come back anyhow so the first fruit of the third pool Ministry was a Salvation of loved one you can do the same thing too you have a loved one you want saved speak the word claim them apply that token if God Did It for sister you got to do the same thing for you because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he will do it for you hallelujah hallelujah so you might think do I have any anointing yes you do you are the bride of Christ you have an anointing if you can put the quot the Messiah paragraph 69 the prophet of God says so when he comes upon his church in the last days what will it be a pulled out group Anointed with the spirit of God there will be Messi they will be anointed ones and if his spirit is in them they'll do the things that he did just exactly so you are anointed amen The Same Spirit that was in Christ if you have the Holy Ghost it's in you it says Greater Works than these shall you do why because he's the one who's doing it in you so you have an anointing a Messi anointing to do the exact things that Christ did hallelujah hallelujah the bride has a Ministry the prophet of God was asked the bride have a Ministry you might be wondering do I have a commission yes you do have a commission where do we find that commission Revelation 108 we start reading from verse 10 and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and Tong and Kings he was telling this to John John represents the bride he represents you and me and he's being told his commission what's your commission prophesy again that's the easiest job there is because you are just repeating what was saying you repeating what God say amen amen when I come across something I can't handle I'll just prophesy again it is finished amen when Christ said it is finished on the cross of C that was a prophecy whatever you are going through right now you call on his name it is finished so that's your commission speak the word prophesy again hallelujah hallelujah and he will do it for you and I'll read the last quote it says Don't Fear John from the church ages don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are a too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use like this it says you speak the word and I will perform it hallelujah hallelujah he says that's my Covenant and it can never fail you your job is just doing the speaking not the crying but you do the speaking God says I will perform it he says that's my Covenant with you God has never ever broken a covenant if he kept his Covenant with
