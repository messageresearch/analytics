[11:21] [Music]
[11:35] when his Holy Spirit is guiding us we
[11:38] make no mistakes we heard his voice
[11:43] there he M there are no mistakes he was
[11:46] perfect and all that he gives us to do
[11:49] have a brother I met with this morning
[11:53] at 6:30 for coffee and he had been
[11:57] struggling over a series a lot of months
[12:00] with the name of God and had hooked up
[12:04] somehow of somebody out of these that
[12:06] said that oil was the name of God and
[12:10] that prompt prompts in me internet that
[12:17] showed oil flowing out of a Bible and
[12:22] and Lord to see him didn't give me
[12:24] anything to say directly to him other
[12:27] than to say that there's clearly a name
[12:30] it's not oil the oils the choking that
[12:33] the Lord instructs to use from time to
[12:35] time when when praying for the surfing
[12:38] just but we just kind of I cut the
[12:41] conversation weeks went on and so today
[12:48] he came in and he said had a very
[12:51] interesting experience on his invited
[12:54] bike they gave me the gentleman's name
[12:56] me and my wife to go to this church
[12:59] denominational Church on the west side
[13:02] he said that it was a name of the
[13:07] gathering was a pumpkin harvest and a
[13:11] Halloween harvest pumpkin harvest and he
[13:17] said we were helping some elderly that
[13:19] were you know not quite with it needed
[13:22] help getting around and really enjoyed
[13:26] himself and all of a sudden a man came
[13:28] up another Lee man and he said my god he
[13:32] give you the name of his God he said to
[13:35] God
[13:35] Egypt and it really caught mark yes I
[13:43] didn't know what to make
[13:45] he said all I know is my gods the Lord
[13:47] Jesus Christ no that was really a
[13:50] different direction and he's been going
[13:52] with me regarding the name of God being
[13:54] oil and I said wasn't that good mark did
[13:58] not help you understand his name he said
[14:01] amen and he said watched the man and
[14:05] just then the Lord get judge me the
[14:06] demands of duck I said I just tell you
[14:09] something the man that you met he was a
[14:12] double and God allowed that to happen to
[14:16] you get his name straight and he said I
[14:20] believe that I watched him and he said I
[14:22] didn't see him talk to anybody else the
[14:24] whole place except for me so that was a
[14:27] I God sent and maybe it didn't sound
[14:30] like that to you to have a devil come to
[14:33] you but if you were struggling with
[14:34] something about God it was that early in
[14:37] his word be prepared God's gonna make
[14:40] sure you get it straight or at least
[14:42] heaven he's a righteous judge if you're
[14:43] gonna insist upon sailings saying
[14:47] something foolishly in the air then
[14:49] you'll get a return on that I just thank
[14:55] God for the brother and an opportunity
[14:57] to give testimony to him his daughter
[15:00] also was having a problem she's a runner
[15:03] athletic runner and we know how that
[15:06] goes sometimes as new babies don't need
[15:09] to be dressed the way they are
[15:14] lordy just Steve called me the day
[15:16] before and asked me to pray for Anna and
[15:18] Lord led me to pray for her in a way
[15:22] that probably he didn't see but is to
[15:25] allow that ankle sprain that wasn't even
[15:28] the ankle that was sprained to continue
[15:32] and so I just waited for God to finish
[15:35] our testimony of this this morning to
[15:38] assure him the I did pray for Anna
[15:41] and I just encourage you to that you
[15:45] instruct in her just like yourself
[15:48] to learn how to recount I said yeah
[15:52] under if you repent once a day or seven
[15:55] times a day find different opportunities
[15:57] to repent
[15:58] I know people that have a hard time
[16:00] detecting at all and I said you have to
[16:03] teach her how to repent even if for the
[16:05] things that she may not even know that
[16:07] she's done and just ask her to ask the
[16:11] Lord and circumcise her heart every day
[16:13] so there's nothing between her and the
[16:16] Lord and I said you're the prime example
[16:20] for dad to teach her how to do that so
[16:23] it's just all in all just a lovely day
[16:26] and I just to appreciate God showing me
[16:30] that hearing his voice not guessing out
[16:33] of my hearing his voice let's just go

[31:02] hey man how do we give me the power that
[31:06] Jesus hats it would change that first
[31:09] there used to say had a man we took that
[31:13] word hat out and put it to the word has
[31:15] a man because he is the same yesterday
[31:18] today and forever amen he has not
[31:22] changed a man he's still the same he's
[31:26] the same right now a man we got a draw
[31:29] from that sameness hey man that was a
[31:32] prophecy this day in October 2018 Paul
[31:37] prophesied about this day that Jesus
[31:40] Christ would still be the same this day
[31:43] on a day that is called today hey man
[31:46] sorry to keep you waiting a few
[31:49] scriptures I just had to find amen
[31:54] not exactly sure where this message is
[31:57] going to go tonight I'm just praying
[32:00] that the Lord will bring it out exactly
[32:02] the way that he wants to as it's reading
[32:06] through a few of brother branham's
[32:08] messages and it just I'd already written
[32:11] out my notes and I go through and read
[32:12] some messages and brother bands message
[32:14] just going right in line with what the
[32:16] Lord had me write down and and just you
[32:21] know let me say this in the right way
[32:24] but people enjoy going to Jeffersonville
[32:29] and standing somewhere and saying you
[32:32] know a brother Bram walked into this
[32:33] candy store one time you know or going
[32:37] to Sabina Canyon and this is the same
[32:40] trail that brother Brandon walked on and
[32:43] this is what he pointed out or sunset
[32:47] mountain you know and this is the
[32:48] mountain that he stood upon when this
[32:50] happened this happened
[32:51] but there's something about when you're
[32:53] in the scriptures and those things are
[32:56] fine but when you're in the scriptures
[32:59] and all of a sudden you begin seeing a
[33:01] scripture I you realized the one day
[33:03] that brother Branham was in his study
[33:05] gazing at that same scripture and the
[33:09] revelation of God would come down upon
[33:10] him and he had see something and he'd be
[33:13] able to preach a message based upon that
[33:15] scripture you and then when you sit in
[33:17] your study and you see that same
[33:20] scripture and all of a sudden that
[33:22] feeling comes upon you brother Branham
[33:24] was right here and he was staring at
[33:26] that scripture that I'm sitting right
[33:29] there somewhere where brother Aaron was
[33:31] and the various to me that is greater
[33:33] than being somewhere in jeffersonville
[33:35] to me that is greater than being
[33:37] somewhere on sunset mountain or in
[33:39] sabino canyon because now I am standing
[33:41] upon the same word that brother Branham
[33:44] was staring at and receiving the
[33:45] revelation that he brought out amen amen
[33:50] let's just open our Bibles to
[33:55] Deuteronomy chapter 16 got three passage
[34:00] of scriptures I want to go to and it's
[34:01] kind of long reads and I know I do that
[34:04] a lot so I hope you I hope you like the
[34:06] scriptures a man I want to preach today
[34:09] on the body of Christ amen amen so
[34:20] Deuteronomy chapter 16 verses 1
[34:28] six I'm just going to go through this as
[34:30] we have time tonight I think so in
[34:37] Deuteronomy chapter 16 here speaking
[34:39] about the Passover and and you all
[34:42] understand it and we're gonna I want to
[34:46] read all six verses we'll start with the
[34:48] third verse it says thou shalt eat no
[34:52] unleavened bread with it seven days
[34:55] shalt thou eat unleavened bread
[34:57] therewith even the bread of affliction
[35:00] for thou camest forth out of the land of
[35:02] Egypt in haste that thou mayest remember
[35:05] the day when thou camest forth out of
[35:08] the land of Egypt all the days of thy
[35:10] life a man you know and brother branham
[35:12] took those seven days thou shalt eat the
[35:14] unleavened bread that there should be no
[35:16] leavening in the bread through all seven
[35:18] Church ages that the Bride of Christ
[35:20] would live by the pure Word of God amen
[35:24] she's nothing added to it nothing taken
[35:26] away from it but that the Bride of
[35:27] Christ would live by the full Word of
[35:29] God amen amen
[35:33] so verse four and there shall be no
[35:36] leavened bread seen within with thee in
[35:39] all thy coasts seven days neither shall
[35:42] there anything of the flesh which thou
[35:45] sacrificed the first aid even remain all
[35:48] night until the morning so every day
[35:51] there has to be a fresh kill every day
[35:54] there has to be a fresh a fresh word
[35:57] would come every day amen now may us not
[36:01] sacrifice the Passover within any of thy
[36:04] gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee
[36:07] amen now God gave him a lot of cities a
[36:10] lot of gates a lot of places but there
[36:12] was one place where the sacrifice would
[36:14] be and only in that place but the
[36:17] sacrifice Pete it couldn't be eaten
[36:19] somewhere else but there was one place
[36:21] given a mint just one place verse six
[36:25] but at the place which the LORD thy God
[36:28] shall choose to place his name in there
[36:33] thou shall sacrifice the Passover even
[36:36] at the going down of the Sun at this
[36:39] season that thou camest forth out of
[36:41] Egypt amen
[36:43] where God shall choose to place his name
[36:45] there that there that's where you're
[36:48] gonna sacrifice it at the evening time
[36:50] now we are here at the evening time Amen
[36:52] and there is a place that God has placed
[36:54] his name Amen
[36:55] now let's go / - let's go over to Luke
[37:01] 24
[37:13] Luke 20
[37:15] verse 15 and it came to pass that while
[37:26] they commune together and reasoned that
[37:32] was their reasoning they meant they were
[37:35] communing together with their own
[37:37] reasoning that Jesus himself drew near
[37:42] and went with them but their eyes were
[37:44] Holden that they should not know him and
[37:46] he said unto them what manner of
[37:49] communications are these that ye have
[37:52] one to another as you walk and are sad I
[37:56] think about here is the word coming up
[37:59] next to them comparing their words with
[38:06] his word amen
[38:08] the word with their word amen
[38:15] now let's go down to verse 25 and then
[38:22] he said unto them o fools and slow of
[38:25] heart to believe all that the prophets
[38:27] have spoken ought not Christ to have
[38:30] suffered these things and entered into
[38:31] his glory and beginning at Moses and all
[38:34] the prophets he expounded unto them in
[38:36] all the Scriptures the things concerning
[38:39] himself so here the word I'm gonna go on
[38:44] to another scripture here in a second
[38:45] sorry to keep you standing but here's
[38:46] the word watch they were communing
[38:49] together and they were in confusion amen
[38:54] they they they they had they had they
[38:58] had their names on the Lamb's Book of
[39:00] Life
[39:01] but somehow the word wasn't there to
[39:04] come out of their mouth the word had to
[39:09] come out of their mouth but it wasn't
[39:10] coming out of their mouth so the word
[39:12] had to come up next to them and began to
[39:15] preach the true ur to them to correct
[39:18] the word coming out of their mouth
[39:20] because the word that's coming out of
[39:21] their mouth was wrong they were
[39:24] preaching the wrong word amen they and
[39:27] he had the word had to correct them
[39:29] amen now let's go to Acts chapter 8 Acts
[39:43] chapter 8 verse 5 which Romans 8 Acts
[39:52] chapter 8 verse 5 will read the fifth
[39:56] verse and go over to the 26th verse then
[40:00] Philip went down to the city of Samaria
[40:02] and preached Christ unto them amen now
[40:07] it's going on 26 and the angel of the
[40:12] Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and
[40:15] go toward the south under the way that
[40:17] goeth down from Jerusalem under Gaza
[40:19] which is the desert and he arose and
[40:23] went and behold a man of Ethiopian a
[40:25] unit of great authority under Candace
[40:27] the queen of the Ethiopians who had
[40:30] charge of all her treasure and had come
[40:33] to Jerusalem for torsion was returning
[40:37] and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah
[40:40] the prophet and then the spirit said to
[40:43] Philip go near and join thyself to this
[40:46] chariot and Philip ran thither to him
[40:49] and heard him read the prophet Isaiah
[40:51] and said understandest thou not what
[40:54] thou readest and he said how can i
[40:58] except some man should guide me he
[41:01] desired Philip that he would come up and
[41:03] sit with him and the place that the
[41:06] scripture which he read was this he was
[41:08] led as a sheep to the slaughter and like
[41:11] a lamb dumb before his Shearer so open
[41:14] he not his mouth and his humiliation his
[41:16] judgment was taken away who shall
[41:19] declare his generation who shall declare
[41:22] his generation amen
[41:24] for his life is taken from the earth
[41:28] jesus's life taken from the earth amen
[41:32] and the eunuch answered Philip and said
[41:33] I pray thee of whom spake speak as the
[41:37] profitless of himself or a smother and
[41:40] watch this verse 35 then Philip opened
[41:43] his mouth doesn't say it Philip said it
[41:48] says and Philip opened his mouth and
[41:50] began at the same Scripture and preached
[41:53] unto him Jesus a man let's aspire has an
[41:57] order prayer Heavenly Father we know
[42:01] Lord that you have reserved a rich feast
[42:03] unto us this evening father and lord I
[42:06] just pray far as you'd find me faithful
[42:07] lorta to be able or that your words
[42:10] would come out of this mouth father and
[42:13] that I be faithful and true to your word
[42:15] and to your message in the name of Jesus
[42:17] Christ we pray amen amen you can be
[42:21] seated amen now Christ was sent to this
[42:28] earth he was the Word of God amen
[42:31] he was the living true Word of God amen
[42:34] now the the
[42:35] since the creation since the fall we had
[42:39] many promises many expectations but
[42:42] everything constantly fell into death
[42:44] and decay amen every time God tried to
[42:47] set something in order it would always
[42:49] fall into death and decay every revival
[42:52] ended amen every every every good man
[42:56] died amen every every move of God
[42:59] eventually came to an end amen and that
[43:03] time would be sealed away and as they
[43:05] got to their high points that day will
[43:08] be sealed and they go back down and Ty
[43:10] dolla tree man so but but for all of
[43:14] that had been tried and tried and over
[43:16] and over again finally it came down to
[43:19] because remember when Eve sinned and
[43:24] doubted the Word of God mankind was
[43:28] sealed away from the tree of life amen
[43:31] it was sealed away from the tree of life
[43:33] but that doesn't mean that the tree of
[43:35] life as we preached a few weeks ago the
[43:37] tree of life kept visiting them over yo
[43:39] and over again you had visitations of
[43:42] the tree of life as we preached about a
[43:43] month ago I'm on the Tree of Life the
[43:45] tree
[43:45] kept visiting and visiting and visiting
[43:47] and giving them little tokens little
[43:49] tokens little revivals amen but but
[43:52] still mankind was separated from that
[43:55] tree of life amen but they clung to the
[43:58] Passover they clung to the slain lamb
[44:01] they clung to that token that that that
[44:04] there was something in that slain lamb
[44:07] they didn't quite understand what it was
[44:09] but they knew that that was what God
[44:11] gave them that was the token that they
[44:13] had that you just cling to this slain
[44:15] lamb amen and this is the token that I
[44:18] have given unto you and you can't eat of
[44:21] this Passover any other place but you
[44:23] have to come back to this place to
[44:25] Jerusalem and Trust right here because
[44:28] this is where I have placed my name
[44:29] wherever I place my name that is where
[44:32] you partake of the slain lamb a man so
[44:35] that name was put into Shiloh amen that
[44:38] name was put into the tabernacle the
[44:39] wilderness wherever God placed that name
[44:42] if the name changed they had to change
[44:46] with where that name went amen so they
[44:49] had to follow that that Ark of the
[44:51] Covenant through the Tabernacle in the
[44:53] wilderness and wherever his name was
[44:55] upon that gate that's where they would
[44:58] that's where they would eat the Passover
[45:00] amen and so as that transferred from the
[45:03] Tabernacle in the wilderness over into
[45:05] Shiloh then they had to bring and eat
[45:08] the scent eat the Passover there because
[45:10] that's where God was placing his name
[45:12] amen so now now and then when the when
[45:16] David got so excited about the Ark of
[45:18] the Covenant going up unto the up the
[45:20] hill to be sent to the Zion he said that
[45:23] God arise that all of his enemies be
[45:26] scattered why because God is placed in
[45:28] his ark there were the name of God to be
[45:31] we can rejoice in the name once more we
[45:33] can eat the Passover her again we can
[45:36] rejoice in God select pattern amen amen
[45:39] and that's what that Ethiopian was doing
[45:41] a meant he was going to where God had
[45:45] placed his name he is going to a certain
[45:47] gate even though he lived down Ethiopia
[45:50] he knew that God had his name at a
[45:52] certain gate somewhere and he had to go
[45:55] there a man to eat the Passover he had
[45:57] to go there to
[45:59] I'll break the feast a man so he was
[46:01] being faithful to what God had said and
[46:03] as he was traveling he went to Jerusalem
[46:05] to fulfill what God has said amen now
[46:10] now remember God has a body amen a body
[46:16] that he has chosen a mint he has
[46:20] somewhere that he wants to place his
[46:22] spirit amen now he you know heat God is
[46:25] a spirit but God wants to place his
[46:27] spirit inside of a body that's what he
[46:31] wants to do
[46:31] that's his desire amen God and man to
[46:35] become one he wants to dwell amongst his
[46:37] people that's why he put his tree of
[46:40] life there in the earth they men to join
[46:43] himself to the earth that's right the
[46:45] tree of life had roots amen where do
[46:48] those roots go they went into the earth
[46:50] why because God's own life was gonna be
[46:53] tied connected to the earth by what the
[46:56] roots the life of God connected to the
[46:59] earth God's pattern but mankind was
[47:04] separated 'try of life
[47:06] remember nowhere in genesis did God ever
[47:08] rebuked them from eating from the tree
[47:11] of life until the fall happened and then
[47:13] he says unless they come and they take
[47:15] from the fruit of the tree of life I
[47:16] have to separate them from until and
[47:22] what happened then the tree of life
[47:23] reappeared in the time of Jesus Christ
[47:27] God was restoring back those restoring
[47:31] back his life and the earth amen now
[47:34] what was he doing
[47:35] God had now what was God doing there
[47:38] through the fall was in effect from the
[47:44] time that that was flaming swords were
[47:46] placed there the fall was in effect and
[47:49] now all sudden Jesus Christ
[47:51] what was God doing God took his word the
[47:55] same word that created the heavens and
[47:57] the earth he took that word and spoke to
[48:00] a virgin by the name of Mary he spoke to
[48:05] that virgin mary and he gave her you
[48:08] shall bear a son and you shall call his
[48:10] name Jesus
[48:12] I was a prophecy that was gut as a
[48:17] creative word and she said be it and
[48:21] what she do she received his word
[48:25] she received his word and gave birth to
[48:28] the word she didn't know any other man
[48:31] amen she was a virgin she had never been
[48:35] with any other man she was a virgin -
[48:38] it's a sinful man amen but she but when
[48:42] Christ came to her she received that
[48:44] word amen
[48:46] she had been careful her whole life but
[48:49] now when this word comes to her she
[48:51] receives that word and she says be it
[48:53] unto me according to thy word the same
[48:58] way the earth back in the beginning when
[49:00] God said let the earth bring forth the
[49:03] trees amen let the earth bring forth he
[49:05] put his word into the earth dirt and it
[49:08] became forth exactly what he said so
[49:10] what now he's putting his word into Mary
[49:14] and she gives birth to Jesus Christ and
[49:17] what does he do he grows up and he is
[49:20] God the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[49:23] and a body of flesh God was placing God
[49:28] look now look the earth God had the
[49:31] title deed to the earth a meant he was
[49:34] going to give that to Adam Adam lost
[49:38] that title deed he lost he rejected his
[49:42] possession of a title deed to all of
[49:46] earth and demeaning over the earth he
[49:49] rejected it when he when he went out
[49:51] with his wife he rejected his ownership
[49:53] but what happened so so what so what so
[49:56] the earth was lost amen
[49:58] Satan so ruined the plan of God that the
[50:03] entire earth and all the air all was on
[50:06] the earth was lost and Satan became the
[50:09] god of this earth that was supposed to
[50:13] have been at him and Satan would begin
[50:16] to show his civilizations and grow up
[50:20] ungodly cities and all these you know if
[50:23] you look at all the the archaeological
[50:26] thing
[50:26] that they found going back you know four
[50:28] thousand years five thousand years all
[50:29] these little figurines and gods and
[50:32] things and the baton you know I even
[50:33] read that when when they in eighteen
[50:37] hundreds when they discovered Pompeii
[50:39] that that that was buried underneath
[50:43] that volcano two thousand years ago that
[50:45] in the Victorian times when those
[50:48] archeologists first started digging up
[50:50] Pompeii that the figurines they found
[50:53] were so wicked and so grotesque and so
[50:56] vulgar that they just buried him right
[50:58] back up again they didn't want to dig
[51:00] them out of the ground that they
[51:02] actually reburied what they found
[51:04] because what they found was so wicked
[51:06] that they didn't want to have it in
[51:08] their possession that's not a problem
[51:10] anymore because mankind has now changed
[51:13] their mind back to that wickedness but
[51:17] 150 years ago that was too wicked to be
[51:20] unburied but now it's okay
[51:23] amen but now look the earth grew wicked
[51:27] and wicked and wicked why because the
[51:29] god of this evil age was having its way
[51:32] with civilization and the earth amen
[51:35] all of mankind was ruined there was no
[51:38] hope a meant we were where there was no
[51:40] hope for us there was no hope we had our
[51:43] Passover lamb we had the things we clung
[51:45] to but ultimately we were so vulgar than
[51:48] our minds we spoke lies where can we
[51:52] find a new creation how can we be
[51:54] created again once we become dirty and
[51:59] filthy how can we be cleansed again amen
[52:02] God created us to be the rulers of the
[52:05] earth but we lost our possession God
[52:07] created us to have dominion God created
[52:09] us to live in purity with our God God
[52:12] created us to walk with Him in the cool
[52:13] of the day and we trashed our
[52:15] opportunity amen we lost our opportunity
[52:18] amen we weren't careful with the
[52:20] opportunity that we were given so that
[52:22] opportunity was taken away have you ever
[52:25] had something given to you and then you
[52:28] ruined your opportunity by your own
[52:30] actions it's a terrible feeling to ruin
[52:34] to be given something an opportunity to
[52:36] be in a certain position or an
[52:38] opportunity to
[52:39] have something and then you buy your own
[52:41] foolishness or your own actions you lose
[52:44] that opportunity and then you just kick
[52:46] yourself you're like why did I do such a
[52:48] thing
[52:48] anything especially if you ever get to a
[52:50] place where you can never go back to
[52:52] that opportunity and just it pains your
[52:55] heart you think oh why did I allow that
[52:57] to happen why did I ruin that
[52:59] opportunity why did I let this happen
[53:01] why did I not take advantage of that why
[53:04] didn't I die jump at that chance and but
[53:06] alas now the time is gone and it'll
[53:09] never come back and that's the condition
[53:12] that mankind was in the entire earth had
[53:15] been taken out of our possession every
[53:17] speck of dirt was underneath Satan's
[53:21] control every speck of dirt but now
[53:26] Christ or God speaks his word to a woman
[53:30] by the name of Mary and she believes it
[53:33] and God and her body is born that we
[53:38] called Jesus Christ
[53:39] now that body was made out of the dirt
[53:43] of the earth right that body was made
[53:47] out of the natural dirt of the curse
[53:49] earth and what'd he do he claimed it for
[53:51] his own Jesus Christ said this is my
[53:56] portion of the earth and he claimed it
[53:58] and he filled it with himself he took a
[54:03] part of the earth and he filled it with
[54:05] himself he was reversing the curse over
[54:10] that hundred and thirty pounds of dirt
[54:14] all just a hunt now think about how much
[54:18] this world weighs how many tons
[54:22] quadrillions of quadrillions of tons at
[54:26] this earth waste but yeah God came and
[54:28] claimed a hundred and thirty pounds and
[54:32] said I claim this for my own and he took
[54:37] that body and he Bible says that he grew
[54:40] up and he grew up and he grew up in
[54:42] wisdom and stature
[54:43] amen and then as he grew and as he grew
[54:46] and he ate and he ate the natural food
[54:48] of the earth is by agroni and the Holy
[54:50] Spirit descend upon him like the Dove
[54:52] and
[54:53] sealed that portion of the dirt amen God
[54:56] was reclaiming the dirt of the earth
[54:59] amen
[55:01] God was reclaiming it now what'd he do
[55:03] he gave Satan the opportunity to have
[55:07] that portion of the dirt right amen and
[55:09] he and Satan took that and says I don't
[55:12] want it
[55:12] amen hueso so so the so he went to the
[55:17] to Jerusalem and they didn't want him
[55:23] that 130 pounds of dirt went to
[55:26] Jerusalem Jerusalem didn't want it
[55:30] Jerusalem wouldn't claim it he went to
[55:34] the Roman Empire the Roman Empire didn't
[55:37] want and turned them back over to
[55:40] Jerusalem let the priests do and the
[55:43] priests say but we need to say he
[55:45] deserves death and Jerusalem and the
[55:48] Roman said but we cannot kill him what
[55:51] hit wrong has he done and so then but
[55:54] then Jerusalem answers back and says let
[55:56] his blood be upon us and and they are in
[55:59] agreement Jerusalem in agreement with
[56:02] the Roman the world power in agreement
[56:04] with the church power agreeing together
[56:07] that we don't want this 130 pounds of
[56:09] dirt and they took him up off the earth
[56:11] and hung him on a cross between heaven
[56:14] and earth and he was rejected and
[56:18] separated from the earth that he came
[56:21] from a hung up in the air and he was
[56:23] rejected by what he was rejected by the
[56:25] devil he was rejected by the Romans he
[56:28] is rejected by the church he was not
[56:30] wanted but there were some that wanted
[56:33] him there were some that would receive
[56:36] him amen look he was rejected by all and
[56:40] he hung there and so why did God do God
[56:43] so it is that body laid there in the in
[56:45] the grave those three days and three
[56:47] nights and a few women went to go claim
[56:49] him amen went to go anoint him amen and
[56:53] it was it and now all of a sudden that
[56:57] body was laying there dead
[57:01] it grew cold three days that body laid
[57:05] there and grew cold
[57:06] nobody wanted nobody would claim it they
[57:09] sealed it behind a stone and nobody
[57:12] wanted the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:17] and so as it grew cold there those those
[57:22] three days all of a sudden something
[57:24] happened God waited for someone to claim
[57:28] it nobody wanted so God says I will
[57:30] claim it I will claim this body so God
[57:37] takes his spirit and places his spirit
[57:41] back inside the body of the Lord Jesus
[57:43] Christ and he claims that 130 pounds of
[57:47] dirt a mint now know that body is the
[57:50] body of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan
[57:52] didn't want it the church didn't want
[57:55] the world didn't want it but God says
[57:58] all take and that reversed the curse
[58:01] over that part of the dirt now that body
[58:05] has sinned it up into the heavens they
[58:07] meant and as a token the Bible says that
[58:12] is a token it's a sacrifice that Jesus
[58:14] stands there with his own blood waiting
[58:17] for us to make intercession for you
[58:19] based upon your confession amen so what
[58:22] that was the body of the Lord Jesus
[58:24] Christ that is the body of Lord Jesus
[58:28] Christ now what is he doing he's
[58:30] expanding that body that if anybody
[58:33] would believe upon me I will give him
[58:37] power to reject the body that he was
[58:41] born with and to be transformed by the
[58:45] renewing of your mind to be a new
[58:48] creature and now you will become a part
[58:52] of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[58:56] you have a chance and an opportunity
[59:00] that the opportunity the Adam and Eve
[59:03] lost has now been returned back to the
[59:06] sons of men Amen Satan rejected that
[59:10] body now it's no longer just a hundred
[59:12] thirty pound body but now it's all of
[59:15] when we are given an opportunity when
[59:18] the window when the light comes of
[59:20] flashes across your eyes and all sudden
[59:23] you begin to realize what the gospel is
[59:25] and you accept the gospel amen now you
[59:28] but Jesus says come unto me all ye who
[59:31] are weary laden I will give you rest
[59:35] hey meant what was rest it was the the
[59:37] end of the creation the the last day of
[59:41] creation the seventh day was that rest
[59:44] amen and Jesus says if you come unto me
[59:47] I will give you rest
[59:48] you will be completed a new creation you
[59:51] will be a mint about the body of the
[59:53] Lord Jesus Christ recreated upon the
[59:56] earth flesh of my flesh bone of my bone
[1:00:00] she is him by the blood by the word the
[1:00:06] opportunity that has been given to us so
[1:00:09] think about it now on the road to Emmaus
[1:00:12] they were talking there and they were
[1:00:15] sad the greatest event that ever
[1:00:18] happened upon the earth was upon them
[1:00:21] and they were sad their countenance was
[1:00:26] contrary to the event it's like giving
[1:00:29] someone a million dollars and they get
[1:00:30] all upset about it they didn't realize
[1:00:33] the point in time where they were
[1:00:35] staying so God sent the word to them
[1:00:37] because they didn't realize where they
[1:00:40] were and what they're at the point that
[1:00:42] they were standing in God had to send
[1:00:44] the word to them to change their way of
[1:00:47] thinking why so they could be redirected
[1:00:50] to do exactly remember he told them wait
[1:00:54] here until you be endued with power from
[1:00:55] on high
[1:00:56] amen and so I had to he had to come here
[1:00:59] to meet them the visitation the
[1:01:00] visitation a mint so what Jesus the word
[1:01:03] came to them and changed they were there
[1:01:07] but now think about here's another now
[1:01:09] go couple years later here's a eunuch he
[1:01:14] doesn't know but he's been
[1:01:17] faithful he leaves Ethiopia and he is in
[1:01:20] charge of all the wealth of this queen
[1:01:23] by the name of Candace and he leaves and
[1:01:26] he goes to Jerusalem and while he's
[1:01:28] there he perhaps you know sees a scroll
[1:01:31] of Isaiah for sale on the streets you
[1:01:34] know how much one of those costs you
[1:01:37] know how many days of labor it costs to
[1:01:40] get a scroll of Isaiah you know a
[1:01:43] 30-foot long scroll of Isaiah that's a
[1:01:46] lot of money how many man-hours that go
[1:01:48] into - to creating something like that
[1:01:51] but he says it is worth it I will pay
[1:01:53] that price I want to know what the word
[1:01:56] of Jehovah is he K he left Ethiopia to
[1:01:59] go to Jerusalem the thing is is he went
[1:02:03] to the wrong Jerusalem because he wanted
[1:02:06] to go to where the name of the Lord was
[1:02:10] because God said in Deuteronomy 16 that
[1:02:13] only in one gate will you worship Amen
[1:02:16] and there at that gate is where you'll
[1:02:18] eat the Passover so he went but he
[1:02:21] didn't realize that Jerusalem had
[1:02:23] changed the gate had changed it was no
[1:02:25] longer there in Jerusalem the gate had
[1:02:28] changed he went to the wrong Jerusalem
[1:02:31] and he bought the scroll of Isaiah and
[1:02:34] as he as he read his reading through the
[1:02:36] scroll he's he said I'm reading here I
[1:02:39] just don't understand when he says he
[1:02:41] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:02:43] like a lamb done before his Shearer so
[1:02:46] opened he not his mouth in his
[1:02:49] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:02:51] and who shall declare his generation for
[1:02:55] his life was taken from the earth whose
[1:02:58] life is he talking about and so as the
[1:03:02] eunuch starts talking to Philip whose
[1:03:04] life is who is taken from the earth I
[1:03:06] don't know who he's talking about
[1:03:08] somebody's life was taken from the earth
[1:03:10] and I don't know what it means
[1:03:13] amen now think about how many verses in
[1:03:16] the scroll isaiah could have pointed to
[1:03:17] it comes right down there to that verse
[1:03:19] there and he says he tells me and then
[1:03:22] oh and then the angel tells philip go
[1:03:25] and speak to this man there I remember
[1:03:27] the angel could have went and spoke to
[1:03:28] the eunuch but the eunuch
[1:03:30] the angel couldn't do it he had to go
[1:03:33] find a man he had to go find a body amen
[1:03:36] he went and found a body
[1:03:38] where'd that body that body had been
[1:03:41] baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ she had become one with Christ
[1:03:48] amen isn't that the bride of Lord Jesus
[1:03:50] Christ
[1:03:51] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and
[1:03:53] wanted to do eunuch or the Philip joins
[1:03:57] himself with the eunuch and the eunuch
[1:03:58] says his life was taken from the earth
[1:04:01] whose life is that is that the prophet
[1:04:03] or some other and from there and then
[1:04:07] all sudden Philip opens his mouth and
[1:04:09] begins to preach Jesus so now how did
[1:04:15] Phil how did this unit get saved now
[1:04:17] remember just a few years before that
[1:04:19] Jesus was walking over them they were
[1:04:21] sad they were like what is this all meat
[1:04:23] was all this meat and jesus preached
[1:04:25] unto Him Jesus but now Philip is doing
[1:04:30] the same position doing the same thing
[1:04:32] proving that he was the bride of the
[1:04:34] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:37] Philip was proving to the world that he
[1:04:41] was the bride of Lord Jesus Christ doing
[1:04:43] the same thing that Jesus did how how
[1:04:47] did he do that because he had received
[1:04:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had
[1:04:53] received the same spirit so he could
[1:04:56] preach the same gospel he received the
[1:05:00] same spirit so he could preach the same
[1:05:02] gospel amen
[1:05:05] I want to read here from tamal
[1:05:13] fashioned a man brother branham said
[1:05:24] here and the spoken word is the original
[1:05:26] seed
[1:05:31] he said now he's talking about philip
[1:05:34] and the eunich he said now Philip had
[1:05:36] been up to Pentecost Jerusalem for
[1:05:40] worship Tommy says amen to that
[1:05:45] Philip went to Pentecost amen
[1:05:49] the eunuch didn't go to Pentecost he
[1:05:53] went to Jerusalem with all the Dedes and
[1:05:55] the oldies amen
[1:05:58] so Philip knew the eunuch didn't know
[1:06:02] amen then Bream says talking about the
[1:06:06] eunuch he says but why didn't he get
[1:06:08] something because he went to the wrong
[1:06:11] Jerusalem amen he come back down from
[1:06:15] Jerusalem studying the prophecy of
[1:06:17] Isaiah they says although programs seen
[1:06:21] here although an angel directed Philip
[1:06:24] to him the eunuch but the germ of life
[1:06:26] had to come through the body
[1:06:28] Philip oh brother now we're on the line
[1:06:32] where did the germ come from through the
[1:06:36] angel no the angel showed Philip where
[1:06:41] to go an angel is a messenger but here's
[1:06:44] a son Philip had the germ the message
[1:06:48] the word and that's how a child can be
[1:06:52] born
[1:06:52] Philip laid his hands upon him Philip
[1:06:56] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:58] and there came forth the Spirit of God
[1:07:01] sure now the germ had to come from the
[1:07:04] body what body Christ's body correct and
[1:07:09] Philip was a member of the body amen
[1:07:16] Philip was a member of the body of the
[1:07:19] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:20] so because Philip was a member of the
[1:07:23] body body of Lord Jesus Christ he could
[1:07:25] open the Bible says and he
[1:07:27] opened his mouth and what came out the
[1:07:33] word philip opened his mouth and the
[1:07:37] word came out any priest jesus that was
[1:07:44] the germ of life the same germ of life
[1:07:48] that was in Jesus Christ now is in the
[1:07:52] body it was in the body of Christ they
[1:07:55] are still in the body of Christ but the
[1:07:56] body has become one Christ and his bride
[1:08:01] Amen now brother Branham said Jehovah
[1:08:05] had a bride and Adam had a bride she
[1:08:10] felt Adam had a bride but she felt
[1:08:14] Jehovah had a bride she fell Christ had
[1:08:22] a bride on the day of Pentecost she felt
[1:08:26] to all the dark ages amen brother
[1:08:30] Branham says I sat there in the basement
[1:08:32] and he said I wonder what am I going to
[1:08:34] do I the patterns have to keep it going
[1:08:36] I'm gonna get the church out on a limb
[1:08:38] there was three brides and all three of
[1:08:40] them fell how can it be that the third
[1:08:42] one fell when the third one shouldn't
[1:08:44] fall and then he says and the scripture
[1:08:46] came to me I will restore saith the Lord
[1:08:51] so the third bride Christ had a bride on
[1:08:55] the day of Pentecost but she fell
[1:08:57] throughout all the dark ages but I will
[1:08:59] restore saith the Lord all of the years
[1:09:02] every year amen I'll restore it year 34
[1:09:06] year 35 year 36 or 37 amen
[1:09:10] your 500 year 1000 all those years
[1:09:12] they're separating us from where we came
[1:09:14] from
[1:09:15] we'll be restored back to us so we can
[1:09:18] become the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:21] amen now not not not a body like the
[1:09:24] Methodist body because the Methodist
[1:09:27] body added to the word so that the
[1:09:30] Spirit couldn't come upon it amen the
[1:09:34] Lutheran body mixed it together so it
[1:09:37] wasn't just the boughten message of
[1:09:39] Christ buzz
[1:09:41] of Christ plus the message of Luther's
[1:09:44] followers message of man
[1:09:47] so in Pentecost the gifts are restored
[1:09:49] and they say that we now have the life
[1:09:52] of Jesus Christ upon us but yet then all
[1:09:55] suddenly being adding to it adding to it
[1:09:57] was it see they're testifying that
[1:09:59] they're not restored yet they're
[1:10:02] testifying that they were not restored
[1:10:05] yet why because if they've been restored
[1:10:07] back to what they were at their original
[1:10:09] they would have mixed it but there has
[1:10:14] to come a word of restoration so that
[1:10:17] the so that Christ can be the same why
[1:10:19] because we are part of his body amen so
[1:10:22] what the body at the end has to look
[1:10:24] like the body at the beginning a man and
[1:10:27] the body at the beginning when she
[1:10:28] opened up her mouth the word came out
[1:10:30] and men were healed men were delivered
[1:10:32] man we're baptized amen the Spirit of
[1:10:35] God was upon a man and they didn't mix
[1:10:37] the word of man with the Word of God
[1:10:39] amen so what so what God sends a prophet
[1:10:42] with a word and says go back to where
[1:10:46] you come from go back to the word don't
[1:10:48] take anything away from it don't have
[1:10:50] anything to it but restate with the word
[1:10:53] stay right with the word and by that
[1:10:58] prophet the word was restored I tried
[1:11:02] living this word without the message and
[1:11:04] I couldn't do it it took this message to
[1:11:07] restore me back amen amen
[1:11:12] why Weiss why so we could be a bride of
[1:11:16] Lord Jesus Christ so what was it brother
[1:11:18] Branham had a word that was given to him
[1:11:23] he was a prophet that word came from
[1:11:27] where came from God that word was a seat
[1:11:31] so brother Branham opened up his mouth
[1:11:33] and spoke out and what was it seeds amen
[1:11:37] now what was that there was also a Billy
[1:11:39] Graham and Oral Roberts and they pre
[1:11:42] shout what a message seeds and all those
[1:11:46] seeds are going out where they and they
[1:11:48] go or they where they came anyway let's
[1:11:52] turn it over to Ephesians chapter 4
[1:11:54] I know keeping you along tonight but
[1:12:21] in PJ's chapter 4 verse 1 and it says I
[1:12:26] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:12:28] beseech you
[1:12:30] now beseech you means I'm crying out to
[1:12:33] you I'm asking you I'm begging you I'm
[1:12:35] bleeding you with you I beseech you that
[1:12:38] you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:12:39] wherewith you're called now you know I I
[1:12:45] went to a Bible study once years and
[1:12:48] years ago that tore the scripture apart
[1:12:50] and looked at every word and and what
[1:12:53] they got out of it was is that when
[1:12:55] you're a young man and you're studying
[1:12:56] to figure out what type of career you
[1:12:58] should go in that you should pray about
[1:12:59] it and and God will give you the career
[1:13:01] the desire of your heart and you go and
[1:13:04] you do the best job you can in that
[1:13:05] career and God will bless you with
[1:13:07] wealth and the health and all that and
[1:13:09] just walk worthy of the vocation you
[1:13:12] know and the vocation being in your
[1:13:13] career you know we're we have not been
[1:13:17] called that they miss the entire boat of
[1:13:20] what we've been called to hear peep Hall
[1:13:22] is speaking out the word and the war by
[1:13:25] the word he's saying I am busy tching
[1:13:27] you that you walk according to what your
[1:13:30] calling is going to be amen and you have
[1:13:32] a high in holy calling amen now the
[1:13:34] bride of this day has a high and holy
[1:13:36] calling and we in Paula's pleading with
[1:13:39] you yet this day I'm beseeching you walk
[1:13:42] worthy with this with this word that
[1:13:44] you've been given Amen with all
[1:13:46] lowliness and meekness with
[1:13:47] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[1:13:49] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:13:51] the Spirit in the bond of peace trying
[1:13:54] endeavoring there is one body and one
[1:13:57] spirit even as you're called one hope of
[1:13:59] your calling later on in the chapter he
[1:14:01] says grieve not the Holy Spirit where
[1:14:03] you're sealed and he says put off all
[1:14:06] the those follow the lust put off all
[1:14:08] these things he keeps warning them
[1:14:10] warning them don't let your mind get
[1:14:12] confused
[1:14:12] don't let your mind go down in the sin
[1:14:14] why because he he wants to give these
[1:14:17] seeds room to grow
[1:14:20] all of these warnings in this chapter
[1:14:23] are here for a purpose
[1:14:25] because Paul wants you to clear out all
[1:14:27] the junk out of your life to give room
[1:14:30] for this seed to grow why so the body
[1:14:32] could be prepared for the Spirit of the
[1:14:34] Lord Jesus Christ because what happens
[1:14:37] when a body receives the Spirit of
[1:14:39] Christ Christ is all upon the earth
[1:14:42] again amen in his body amen
[1:14:49] so what faith cometh by hearing so when
[1:14:51] these seeds are planted let's go out
[1:14:55] into Fiji's 421 if so this year let's
[1:15:05] start with verse 19 who being past
[1:15:08] feeling have given themselves over to
[1:15:11] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:15:13] with greediness but ye have not so
[1:15:17] learned Christ if so be that ye have
[1:15:20] heard him faith cometh by hearing right
[1:15:22] and have been taught by him as the truth
[1:15:26] isn't Jesus that he put off concerning
[1:15:28] the former conversation the old man
[1:15:31] which is corrupt according to the
[1:15:33] deceitful lusts and be renewed in the
[1:15:36] spirit of your mind now let's pause
[1:15:38] right here what is Paul doing he's
[1:15:40] trying the fusions Church he's he's
[1:15:43] speaking to those in the ephesians
[1:15:44] church that have heard about jesus
[1:15:47] they've been taught about jesus but have
[1:15:51] not become a new creation and he's
[1:15:55] trying to clear all the junk so that the
[1:15:57] seeds that have been planted can grow
[1:16:00] because if that junk now even though
[1:16:03] they've heard about jesus they've been
[1:16:05] taught about jesus but with all the
[1:16:08] associates and all this stuff in there
[1:16:10] the the seeds that were planted cannot
[1:16:12] grow amen so in verse 23 verse 22 that
[1:16:17] you put off concerning the former
[1:16:19] conversation the old man the old way of
[1:16:21] living which is corrupt according to the
[1:16:23] deceitful lusts and be renewed in the
[1:16:26] spirit of your mind and they put on the
[1:16:28] new man which after God is created in
[1:16:32] righteousness and true holiness a new
[1:16:36] man well no wait why does we have to
[1:16:39] have a new no we had an old man that was
[1:16:42] God created in the gate beginning that
[1:16:45] fell amen and Jenner
[1:16:46] after generation as soon as carried on
[1:16:48] carried on carried on throughout all of
[1:16:50] our generations to us amen but now
[1:16:52] here's an opportunity that there's a new
[1:16:54] man available what is this new man it's
[1:16:57] a new creation it's Genesis all over
[1:17:02] again we've gone back to the book of
[1:17:05] Genesis where creative words were
[1:17:07] available they meant what what in the
[1:17:10] book of Genesis creative words were
[1:17:12] available they went out of God's mouth
[1:17:14] they went into the dirt and create
[1:17:16] exactly what God had well God wanted to
[1:17:19] create whatever that particular word was
[1:17:21] it created exactly in every seat bore
[1:17:24] forth after its kind amen
[1:17:26] so what we know we think Genesis is oh
[1:17:28] us way back in the past the creative
[1:17:30] word is gone there is no more creation
[1:17:33] amen but now we find out that the
[1:17:35] creative word that was in Genesis is
[1:17:37] still here there's still a creative word
[1:17:41] here and was this creative word saying
[1:17:43] that it's gone out and now it's gone out
[1:17:45] by the preaching of the gospel every
[1:17:47] word that comes over this pulpit amen
[1:17:49] when God when I'm preachers preaching
[1:17:51] our youth inspiration he becomes what a
[1:17:54] five full prophet right becomes he's
[1:17:57] preaching out the word it's he's
[1:18:00] prophesying amen and that word goes
[1:18:03] forth as a seed and it strikes amen and
[1:18:06] if it goes hits good ground it grows
[1:18:08] that's the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:13] amen and be renewed in the spirit of
[1:18:18] your mind and that you put on the new
[1:18:20] man which after God is created in
[1:18:23] righteousness and true holiness
[1:18:28] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[1:18:31] man truth with his neighbor four members
[1:18:33] one of another and he goes through there
[1:18:35] and just all these different things
[1:18:37] because I'm a verse 30 you know in
[1:18:38] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye or
[1:18:40] sealed why because we're he's trying to
[1:18:43] the the body now the body at this point
[1:18:47] is showing signs of trying of the
[1:18:51] grievious wolves are trying to come into
[1:18:52] the flock Amen he's warning them make
[1:18:55] make room for the seed to grow he knew
[1:18:58] what the creative word could do
[1:19:00] but then when he looked off over the
[1:19:02] churches he saw so many things crowding
[1:19:05] it out so they could not grow and the
[1:19:10] same thing is here today the creative
[1:19:13] word is still here to create sons and
[1:19:19] daughters of God to be part of the body
[1:19:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ to be like
[1:19:25] Phillip speaking to the eunuch tour an
[1:19:27] angel wouldn't dare witness to the
[1:19:30] eunuch but the angel had to go out and
[1:19:32] get a man a body son of God and call
[1:19:38] that son of God go out here and minister
[1:19:41] this man and open your mouth and let the
[1:19:43] Word of God flow out and let the
[1:19:45] creative word create as a seed upon the
[1:19:48] heart of this unit if anybody would be
[1:19:53] willing to get the trash out of their
[1:19:55] life they could be the same thing but he
[1:19:58] warns him watch throughout all these
[1:20:00] books of Paul he he goes through the all
[1:20:03] the great things that could be but he
[1:20:05] says warnings stay clean I'm beseech you
[1:20:07] keep clean walk worthy be worthy of the
[1:20:10] calling why because this calling is a
[1:20:12] creative word and then we go to a
[1:20:14] denominational Church they'll go and
[1:20:16] they'll teach these scriptures they'll
[1:20:18] teach them and it'll teach him but yet
[1:20:19] they have no power to actually create
[1:20:22] what Paul was trying to create a new
[1:20:25] creation a son or a daughter of God the
[1:20:28] body of Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth
[1:20:30] it's the bride of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:32] she has become him by the word but so
[1:20:36] many things hindered amen so many things
[1:20:43] hinder but I Ram says and now here is
[1:20:46] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[1:20:49] reproduction brings forth of its kind
[1:20:52] these last days the true church bride
[1:20:56] comes to the headstone will be a super
[1:20:59] church a super race as they near the
[1:21:03] great headstone they will be much like
[1:21:05] him so much like him even as they will
[1:21:08] be in his very image in the order to be
[1:21:11] united with him
[1:21:13] they will be one now when a prophet is
[1:21:16] speaking something like this what
[1:21:18] happens that's right it comes to pass
[1:21:24] it's a seat when our prophet prophesies
[1:21:28] a man and this is where I said the
[1:21:30] spirit told me to pick up my pin right
[1:21:32] and this is what he wrote so well it's a
[1:21:38] creative word it has to come to pass it
[1:21:41] has to has to be who should have come to
[1:21:43] pass it I beseech you walk worthy of the
[1:21:47] vocation wherewith you are called
[1:21:49] I cried out to you get it get this
[1:21:52] thing's clear make pigment they got all
[1:21:54] the rocks dig out all the stones clean
[1:21:56] up the dirt prepare the dirt of your
[1:21:58] heart
[1:21:58] why so these words can grow in your
[1:22:00] heart and you can become exactly what
[1:22:02] was prophesied to be why because wheat
[1:22:04] now this wasn't just 2,000 years ago
[1:22:06] this is a prophecy prophecy in our day
[1:22:09] that this would come to pass well then
[1:22:11] who should have come to pass
[1:22:14] there's got to be someone that's going
[1:22:16] to believe this amen
[1:22:19] now if we believe if we believe you know
[1:22:22] anoint the sick with oil and they shall
[1:22:24] recover and we believe that we pray over
[1:22:26] them they get sealed we think oh my it
[1:22:28] came to pass just exactly or we think oh
[1:22:32] if we baptized someone in the name of
[1:22:34] Lord Jesus Christ we put him down into
[1:22:36] the water and we take up that man's now
[1:22:38] a Christian and we put our faith in
[1:22:41] those words we have to put our faith in
[1:22:43] this word that these are these prophetic
[1:22:46] words can't come to pass they will be
[1:22:51] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:22:54] the Living God
[1:22:55] denominations can ever produce this they
[1:22:58] will produce their creeds and dogmas
[1:23:00] mixed with the word amen
[1:23:11] then then from a little group of the
[1:23:14] true seed of the word God will present
[1:23:16] Christ a beloved bride a virgin of his
[1:23:21] word and through them and by them will
[1:23:26] be fulfilled all that has been promised
[1:23:29] for his word in the Virgin now think
[1:23:34] about that
[1:23:34] you know I you know in my life I've seen
[1:23:41] a lot of different types of people you
[1:23:43] know and there's how do I say this
[1:23:47] there's you think of people that believe
[1:23:51] in proprietary things and people that
[1:23:55] believe in do it yourself you know and
[1:23:58] and I and I a it it I could see both
[1:24:02] arguments on a lot of things you know
[1:24:04] it's almost as though you know you
[1:24:05] should never work on your own furnace
[1:24:07] because you should only have a
[1:24:08] professional work on your furnace you
[1:24:11] know Amen but do yourself or says well I
[1:24:14] know how this can go together and I can
[1:24:17] do just as good job as professional and
[1:24:19] spend less money and so there's the
[1:24:21] argument the proprietary the factory
[1:24:23] authorized service or the man is going
[1:24:26] to do it himself amen but the
[1:24:30] interesting thing is is how some people
[1:24:32] twist that when it comes to religion and
[1:24:34] then they'll say well I have
[1:24:39] I am the factory authorized dealer and
[1:24:42] you have no part in this and then but
[1:24:48] and now there's going to be a lot of
[1:24:50] people who claim that their factory
[1:24:51] authorized dealers but when they go to
[1:24:55] put their hand upon the equipment I know
[1:24:59] if you've ever been there have you ever
[1:25:00] taken your car to a dealership and said
[1:25:03] I could have fixed it better myself
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:07] there's many people they put their hand
[1:25:10] to the equipment and though they have
[1:25:12] the seal that they are factory
[1:25:14] authorized dealer when they put they -
[1:25:17] they don't know the first thing about
[1:25:18] what the designer intended to actually
[1:25:24] but if you ever take a man who is
[1:25:26] actually knows the design and knows the
[1:25:30] intention and he can dive in there and
[1:25:32] go in there and know exactly what's
[1:25:34] going on Amen that man deserves the true
[1:25:37] seal amen and a lot of people will say
[1:25:40] you know well you know brother branham
[1:25:43] used the Prophet and there should be no
[1:25:45] more preachers no more speaking we're
[1:25:47] the Foxes of the factory authorized
[1:25:49] dealers and and and this forth and and
[1:25:52] now I know all of a sudden the church
[1:25:53] sits there and dries up and dies out and
[1:25:56] they tampered with the Machine and their
[1:26:01] church died and they're not bringing
[1:26:03] forth life but Philip when Phil point
[1:26:09] out all he had to do was open his mouth
[1:26:13] and the way it proved that he was a
[1:26:17] factory authorized dealer he knew what
[1:26:22] he was doing he opened up his mouth and
[1:26:25] he was a factory authorized dealer jesus
[1:26:28] said by their fruits you shall know them
[1:26:30] amen and in this day you will find a lot
[1:26:33] of people saying a lot of things people
[1:26:35] will say I am I am this and I am that
[1:26:38] amen but it in the end it will show who
[1:26:42] who is who they say they are it will
[1:26:45] show who is the factory authorized
[1:26:47] dealer or the word who has the Word of
[1:26:49] God amen there will be a new creation
[1:26:54] brother Branham let me read that again
[1:26:57] he said then from a little group of the
[1:27:01] true seed of the word God will present
[1:27:04] Christ a beloved bride a virgin of his
[1:27:08] word and through them and by them will
[1:27:13] be fulfilled all that has been promised
[1:27:16] for his word in the Virgin who knows no
[1:27:20] man-made Creed's or dogless through them
[1:27:23] why because Christ has to have a body to
[1:27:27] work through amen brother BAM
[1:27:30] said they're back there and we read
[1:27:32] about Philip what he said about Philip
[1:27:33] God the angel needed a body and went and
[1:27:37] got Philip I had to have a body because
[1:27:40] the word comes through the body the same
[1:27:42] is true today amen
[1:27:45] the word still has to come through the
[1:27:47] body the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:50] we must preach the gospel we must preach
[1:27:54] the gospel you submit yourself to the
[1:27:56] word to this message clear out your
[1:27:58] heart of all the junk and what brother
[1:28:00] Branham prophesied to come to pass those
[1:28:02] seeds will come past your life amen
[1:28:05] now if you go to the Baptist Church in
[1:28:07] the Methodist Church to receive those
[1:28:08] seeds and bring forth that fruit or we
[1:28:11] come to this message receive this seed
[1:28:13] receive this message and bring forth
[1:28:16] exactly what was prophesied to come she
[1:28:20] will be like him amen it's an
[1:28:23] opportunity that's the bride of the Lord
[1:28:24] Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:28:32] I'm gonna read here Ephesians chapter 4
[1:28:35] verses 13 through 16
[1:28:38] I'm almost closed almost done he says
[1:28:45] he's talking about the fivefold ministry
[1:28:46] in verse 11 he says any games gave some
[1:28:50] apostles and some prophets and some
[1:28:52] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:28:54] teachers amen that's what we call the
[1:28:58] fivefold ministry and it's not a two
[1:29:00] fold ministry it's not a three fold
[1:29:03] ministry it's a five fold ministry amen
[1:29:06] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:29:08] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:29:10] the body of Christ the body of Christ
[1:29:13] still needs edifying still needs
[1:29:15] perfecting amen and there is a word
[1:29:17] they'll do that and it comes through
[1:29:18] what the fivefold ministry and what and
[1:29:21] what will that what will that perfection
[1:29:22] do what will that do it says until we
[1:29:25] all who's part of that all that's still
[1:29:30] stant amen until we all come in the
[1:29:34] unity of the faith we have to be united
[1:29:37] with st. Paul and believe like he
[1:29:39] believed of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:29:41] God unto a perfect man oh my
[1:29:44] perfect body until the measure of the
[1:29:47] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:29:51] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:29:53] to and fro carried about with every wind
[1:29:55] of doctrine by the sleight of men and
[1:29:56] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:29:58] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:30:01] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:30:04] things which is squash this which is the
[1:30:06] head even Christ so the body this body
[1:30:10] has a head have you have you taught have
[1:30:13] you heard from him lately have you
[1:30:15] talked to him lately do you know him
[1:30:17] are you part of the body of Christ the
[1:30:20] crew the body of Christ knows it's head
[1:30:22] amen amen
[1:30:25] now if you don't know the now watch if
[1:30:28] you don't know the head you will shrivel
[1:30:30] up and die watch which is the last part
[1:30:39] of the 15 there which is the head even
[1:30:43] Christ from whom from this head from
[1:30:47] whom the whole body is fitly joined
[1:30:49] together and compacted by that which
[1:30:51] every joint supplieth according to the
[1:30:54] effectual working and the measure of
[1:30:56] every part maketh increase of the body
[1:31:00] unto the edifying of itself in love
[1:31:03] where'd all that come from from the head
[1:31:05] what brought the unity the head amen
[1:31:09] what brought the increased from the head
[1:31:12] everything came from the head who was
[1:31:15] the head Jesus Christ part of the body
[1:31:18] of the God remember that hundred thirty
[1:31:20] pound body was rejected by Satan it was
[1:31:23] rejected by the church
[1:31:24] now we come we unite ourselves with that
[1:31:27] and by a new creation we've become part
[1:31:29] of that body and he and that body is the
[1:31:32] same yesterday today and forever it has
[1:31:34] not changed now what that head a head
[1:31:36] has to have leadership remember brother
[1:31:39] Branham said the the three part meant
[1:31:41] the three part revelation of Christ the
[1:31:47] mystery that God would would first come
[1:31:51] and God be revealed completely in Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ Christ will be
[1:31:57] reveal completely in the bride amen and
[1:32:00] then a New Eden the earth will be
[1:32:03] remodeled and she would have a new home
[1:32:05] amen amen now let's turn over to
[1:32:11] Colossians two washes to verse fourteen
[1:32:26] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:32:28] Ordinances which was against us which
[1:32:30] was contrary us took it out of the way
[1:32:33] nailing it to his cross having spoil of
[1:32:36] principalities and powers he made a show
[1:32:39] of them openly triumphing over them in
[1:32:43] it what happened the reversing of the
[1:32:46] curse through his death on the cross all
[1:32:50] that was done in during the fall has now
[1:32:52] been reversed openly triumphing over
[1:32:55] upon the cross right when he proved it
[1:32:58] by rising up again on the third day that
[1:33:00] that body was was now a part of the new
[1:33:03] creation and out of that body he was
[1:33:06] creating a new race amen amen
[1:33:13] the verse 60 says let no man therefore
[1:33:16] because of this let no man therefore
[1:33:18] judge you in meat or a drink or in
[1:33:22] respect of a holyday or of the new moon
[1:33:23] or the Sabbath days or saying you have
[1:33:26] to do this or you have to do that or or
[1:33:28] or you have to go to this church or
[1:33:30] believe this doctrine over here or this
[1:33:32] doctrine over there which are a shadow
[1:33:36] of things to come but the body is of
[1:33:39] Christ amen let no man beguile you of
[1:33:44] your reward
[1:33:45] in a voluntary humility and have
[1:33:47] worshipping of angels intruding into
[1:33:50] those things which he has not seen
[1:33:52] vainly puffed up puffed up in his
[1:33:54] fleshly mind there's a lot of people
[1:33:56] going out and preach it they even in the
[1:33:57] name of this message they're preaching
[1:33:59] things that they've worked up in their
[1:34:01] own minds and preaching them for
[1:34:04] doctrine the commandments of men but
[1:34:06] they are not being driven by the head
[1:34:08] which is Christ
[1:34:11] amen and I astounds me to see the people
[1:34:14] that could preach the message and they
[1:34:16] don't even know their Bible and it
[1:34:21] astounds me to see that men would would
[1:34:23] come and come against an evangelist for
[1:34:27] preaching out of the Bible and not using
[1:34:29] enough quotes and not knowing where
[1:34:32] brother Branham got those quotes I'll
[1:34:37] stop there
[1:34:39] but first 16 let no man therefore judge
[1:34:42] you in meat or in drink or in respect of
[1:34:44] a holyday or of the new moon or the
[1:34:46] Sabbath states which are a shadow of the
[1:34:48] things to come but the body is of Christ
[1:34:51] let no man beguile you of your reward in
[1:34:54] a voluntary humility and worshipping of
[1:34:56] angels we have a reward saints less
[1:34:58] being part of the body of Lord Jesus
[1:35:00] Christ which is a greater thing than
[1:35:01] most people even realize amen intruding
[1:35:05] into those things which he hath not seen
[1:35:07] vainly puffed up in his own fleshly mind
[1:35:10] and not holding the head which all the
[1:35:14] body by joints and bands having
[1:35:16] nourishment ministered and knit together
[1:35:20] increases with the increase of God so
[1:35:24] there is a body and it's growing it's
[1:35:26] expanding it's getting its nutrients
[1:35:28] through the veins being strengthened by
[1:35:30] the ligaments increasing so it can
[1:35:32] perform it sub I of Christ performing
[1:35:35] the same things whatever performing
[1:35:37] whatever it is that the spirit would do
[1:35:39] in this day and you are a part of that
[1:35:42] body and the head is still controlling
[1:35:44] it
[1:35:45] amen and if you look to the head you
[1:35:47] will grow up into him amen and increase
[1:35:51] these movements that are not driven by
[1:35:53] the ligaments of your old creation but
[1:35:56] now by the ligaments of the muscles of
[1:35:58] the new creation being moved by the
[1:36:01] Spirit of God because you are a new
[1:36:03] creation Amen why by holding be holding
[1:36:09] the head verse 19 there I want to read
[1:36:11] that again verse 18 let no man beguile
[1:36:14] you of your reward why by following the
[1:36:18] doctrines and thoughts of men amen
[1:36:21] Burton the last for the verse that they
[1:36:23] intruded into those things that they
[1:36:25] have not even seen vainly puffed up with
[1:36:27] his own fleshly mind and not holding the
[1:36:30] head
[1:36:30] they didn't watch Christ they got
[1:36:35] something in their own mind and they
[1:36:37] didn't keep their eyes on Christ the
[1:36:40] mainspring amen amen
[1:36:44] and if they would have kept their head
[1:36:45] their mind on Christ the head then their
[1:36:49] body by the joints and the band's the
[1:36:51] ligaments they'd have had received
[1:36:54] nourishment they have grown stronger and
[1:36:56] then they were been actually perform
[1:36:58] acts the book of Acts but right right
[1:37:00] and wrote again the new church by
[1:37:03] beholding the head amen
[1:37:06] but Philip beheld the head amen he heard
[1:37:10] the message that whatever was told him
[1:37:12] on the road to emmaus he heard it amen
[1:37:14] he knew of it amen all that Jesus told
[1:37:16] them he took it to his mind and he says
[1:37:19] I'm gonna stay here until I be endued
[1:37:22] with power from on high
[1:37:23] amen and once he was in dude with that
[1:37:25] power he went out preaching the gospel
[1:37:27] and when the angel of the Lord needed
[1:37:29] someone to preach that gospel because I
[1:37:31] know I'll go grab Phillip he is part of
[1:37:33] my body
[1:37:34] he is flesh of my flesh he is bone of my
[1:37:36] bone and he sent him and when Philip
[1:37:38] opened up his mouth the word of creative
[1:37:41] word of God went out and then the eunuch
[1:37:44] was created a new creation and changed
[1:37:48] into a man a body the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:52] amen and so are we we are the body of
[1:37:56] the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham he
[1:37:58] talked about you know the Cadillac that
[1:38:00] had all the all eight cylinders freshly
[1:38:04] cleaned out right off the factory a tank
[1:38:07] full gasoline the spark plugs tightened
[1:38:10] in there torture with the torque wrench
[1:38:12] to a certain torque amen and there and
[1:38:14] with a certain gap on the spark plug and
[1:38:17] everything going there you know and but
[1:38:19] if that main plug to the coil is off no
[1:38:23] matter how fine your Cadillac is they've
[1:38:26] been the first 1962 model that ever had
[1:38:29] air-conditioning might have been a fine
[1:38:33] model of vehicle with buttons they have
[1:38:35] where they go and do things little wires
[1:38:37] and everything but without that spark
[1:38:40] being able to get to where it needs to
[1:38:43] go the whole thing is a bunch of junk
[1:38:47] wouldn't do what it was designed to do
[1:38:52] just a bunch of junk and so are we
[1:38:55] without that spark of the Holy Spirit in
[1:38:58] our lives if we do not behold the head
[1:39:00] which is Christ if he can't turn you but
[1:39:05] he can't turn you into the body of
[1:39:07] Christ
[1:39:07] if the head cannot control you and tell
[1:39:11] you what to do then how can you say I am
[1:39:16] connected to the head which is the know
[1:39:18] you've been decapitated you are not a
[1:39:21] part of the body of Christ because the
[1:39:23] head can control the body and if he
[1:39:25] can't control you then you are
[1:39:27] testifying that you are not part of that
[1:39:29] body
[1:39:31] amen amen
[1:39:36] in closing let's turn to Romans chapter
[1:39:38] 8 the old creator could not produce
[1:39:43] Christ that's why the spirit sent Philip
[1:39:51] to the eunuch eunuch had gone to the
[1:39:55] wrong Jerusalem so God had to send a
[1:39:58] part of the New Jerusalem let's go meet
[1:40:01] him a mint part of the body of Christ
[1:40:06] Romans chapter 8 verse 11
[1:40:15] first ten let's read verse ten if Christ
[1:40:19] be in you the body is dead because of
[1:40:22] sin but the Spirit is life because of
[1:40:24] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:40:27] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:40:29] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:40:32] dead was the body of Christ was laying
[1:40:34] there in the grave cold dead and what
[1:40:38] something sprung into it
[1:40:40] God Almighty sprung to it resurrected it
[1:40:43] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:40:46] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:40:49] his Spirit that dwells in you let no man
[1:40:52] beguile you of your reward amen
[1:40:54] therefore brethren we are debtors oh I
[1:40:57] thought we were free
[1:40:59] you know this message sets people free
[1:41:03] it sets people free from the bondage of
[1:41:06] Catholic Lutheran Methodist what the
[1:41:12] problem is is I see so many people who
[1:41:15] get set free from Catholic Baptist
[1:41:18] Methodist but they don't get rebound to
[1:41:22] Christ and and you can see the evidence
[1:41:28] of it because they get set free from
[1:41:30] that and then they run off on these wild
[1:41:32] tangents and grabbing this and grabbing
[1:41:34] that and they go off over and they don't
[1:41:36] even know Christ why because the spirit
[1:41:44] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:41:46] didn't enter into their body to make
[1:41:49] them a part of the body of Christ if I
[1:41:57] where I was eight eleven but if this
[1:42:03] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:42:05] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:42:07] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:42:09] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:42:12] dwelleth in you now brethren we are
[1:42:13] debtors debtors always say oh we're free
[1:42:17] no no no no we are free from that but we
[1:42:22] I'd the prisoner of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:24] Christ I beseech you walk worthy of the
[1:42:28] vocation wherewith you are called we are
[1:42:31] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[1:42:33] the flesh for if you live after the
[1:42:35] flesh he shall die but if he through the
[1:42:38] spirit oh now we are debtors to the
[1:42:40] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[1:42:44] he shall live for as many as are led by
[1:42:47] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:42:49] God but if you are not led by the Spirit
[1:42:52] of God then you are not a son of God but
[1:42:55] they all preach things that are worked
[1:42:57] up by their own fleshly mind and cannot
[1:43:02] even prove that they are tied to the
[1:43:05] head amen remember 16 the spirit itself
[1:43:13] beareth witness with our spirit though
[1:43:15] we are the children of God and if
[1:43:17] children then heirs heirs of God and
[1:43:20] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:43:24] suffer with him we may also be glorified
[1:43:27] together there will be suffering they
[1:43:31] meant for I reckon that the sufferings
[1:43:33] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:43:36] be compared with the glory that shall be
[1:43:39] revealed in us amen what is that the
[1:43:44] adoption it goes right into the adoption
[1:43:47] amen
[1:43:48] the glory of Lord being revealed in us
[1:43:51] adopted sons the daughters of God God
[1:43:53] can finally do with you everything that
[1:43:57] the body of Christ was supposed to do
[1:44:00] then we can truly say that Jesus Christ
[1:44:03] is the same why because he has just as
[1:44:08] much power over our body as he had over
[1:44:12] his body
[1:44:14] if the when Jesus was in his own body
[1:44:18] that he was that God created the 130
[1:44:21] pounds of dirt when the the spirit spoke
[1:44:24] to the mind the mind spoke to the body
[1:44:27] it did exactly what the Spirit wanted to
[1:44:30] do and now we are a new creation the
[1:44:34] body of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:44:36] whatever the head says if he is the same
[1:44:40] if the head is the same then the body
[1:44:43] has to be the same a mint then we got to
[1:44:47] do exactly what the head says and if
[1:44:50] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:44:52] forever that's why the signs and the
[1:44:55] wonders and all those things appear why
[1:44:57] because Jesus Christ is the same but
[1:45:00] what's he doing it through he's doing it
[1:45:02] through his body and he has a body on
[1:45:04] this earth
[1:45:05] it's his bride she is the flesh of his
[1:45:07] flesh she is the bone of his bone and
[1:45:09] she does exactly what the head does
[1:45:11] tells her to do through the spirit
[1:45:13] that's why he should walk worthy of the
[1:45:15] vocation wherewith ye are called i'm
[1:45:17] beseeching you brethren
[1:45:18] walk worthy of the vocation where keep
[1:45:20] yourself clean keeps up why so the
[1:45:22] spirit the head can't work through you
[1:45:24] so that Christ can be the same yesterday
[1:45:28] today and forever brother Branham had
[1:45:31] the revelation of it and prophesied over
[1:45:34] the bride so the bright I have the
[1:45:37] revelation of it and here we are living
[1:45:40] proof testimony of the message of the
[1:45:43] hour if so be that the spirit can work
[1:45:47] through you and bring forth the message
[1:45:49] of your day through your body there's
[1:45:53] many good Methodists that brought forth
[1:45:54] the method the eighth in the ages method
[1:45:57] Methodism they were true to John
[1:46:00] Wesley's message and they bore witness
[1:46:02] to what God is doing in that day there
[1:46:05] was a lot of foolishness but there's a
[1:46:06] lot that were true to it a man in the
[1:46:08] days of Luther there was many people
[1:46:09] that were faithful to Martin Luther's
[1:46:12] message and so is in the state as we
[1:46:14] meet people they're faithful to the
[1:46:15] message of brother brand and they will
[1:46:17] see that seed come for us but the thing
[1:46:19] is is this seat is the last seat to
[1:46:22] bring you into perfection not just
[1:46:25] another age but the end of the ages to
[1:46:28] bring for
[1:46:28] a bride for Christ a bride virgin of the
[1:46:32] word Amen Amy let's just an amen when
[1:46:45] you're when you're when you see it like
[1:46:46] that
[1:46:52] brother Bram said he said notice but
[1:46:57] Christ we believe were an endtime do we
[1:47:00] do you believe that before you have a
[1:47:05] crop now you have to plant the seed
[1:47:08] before you have a crop you have to plant
[1:47:10] the seed it says do you see why I've let
[1:47:15] the church's turn me out tell me
[1:47:18] everything call me all kinds of names
[1:47:20] and everything and yet I just stay right
[1:47:23] with that word see there's a plant the
[1:47:27] seeds been planted it's already been
[1:47:29] planted friends it's already done
[1:47:32] I can say it now it's over that's right
[1:47:36] she's done been planted oh yeah so has
[1:47:40] the denominational seat and all the rest
[1:47:42] of them seeds gunmen planted was it God
[1:47:50] had God what God wired a crop right you
[1:47:57] wanted a bright wanna crop that's what
[1:48:00] he do right before the end you want a
[1:48:03] crop at the end it's right before the
[1:48:05] end he sends a profit that profit has a
[1:48:08] message that message has a seat and se
[1:48:13] goes out and all the world play it on
[1:48:16] tape players everywhere and it'll go and
[1:48:18] find some hearts and they'll become
[1:48:22] exactly what that message is
[1:48:25] and when they stay and when they and
[1:48:27] when you now you can take that message
[1:48:29] and you can it will set you free but you
[1:48:33] must be rebound to Christ be set free
[1:48:37] from all the denominations all
[1:48:39] foolishness but get rebound to the head
[1:48:42] that's how you become the new creation
[1:48:45] they can argue about all the tapes and
[1:48:49] the different things and whether there's
[1:48:51] ministry now or they can argue about
[1:48:54] whether there's pastors anymore they let
[1:48:55] them have all those arguments
[1:48:57] let me just behold the head Christ I
[1:49:01] don't want any part of it I just want to
[1:49:05] see Christ I know what the message is
[1:49:09] I've seen it I've heard it I've listened
[1:49:12] to it I know it's for somebody and I
[1:49:14] know that it has to have a fruit amen
[1:49:18] and that fruit is a greater reward
[1:49:21] let me beseech you then what the
[1:49:24] denominations can tell you about it's
[1:49:26] not just a career not just a church walk
[1:49:29] not just this little thing over here but
[1:49:31] it is we're there is we're actually
[1:49:33] eating the day that brother Graham said
[1:49:35] we were in we're really there the last
[1:49:38] days amen and there is a seat so there
[1:49:42] could be a crop at the last day which is
[1:49:44] the variety of Lord Jesus Christ flesh
[1:49:46] of his flesh bone of his bone she will
[1:49:49] be him by the word by the blood amen
[1:49:53] part of him joint eres amen and he is
[1:49:58] the same so then she becomes the same by
[1:50:01] the head which is Christ when she gets
[1:50:03] bound to the head Christ amen let's just
