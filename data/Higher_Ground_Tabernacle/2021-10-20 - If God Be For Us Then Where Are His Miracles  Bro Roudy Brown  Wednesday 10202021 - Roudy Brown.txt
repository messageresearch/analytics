hasn't a clue to what it really is i was thinking about a thing today how christ always did things in way of parables and he did it so because he understood that the only the elect would catch it even though the devil would read it he would only come out with an intellectual understanding but on christ the solid rock i stand that same rock which brother bradham said is the revelation of jesus christ he builds his church i'm so grateful to the victories that all of us have won today how many of y'all won victories today oh my i tell you what great great victories amen and i thank god for that those victories because i realize it's god who does give us these victories we have our brother rudy brown uh we spoke with brother brown even before the pandemic or during that time and so anyway we weren't able to get back with him and y'all know me i do forget amen the only thing i don't forget is that i'm saved [Laughter] but we're going to have our brother come and speak for us tonight those of you who were expecting me to preach the same jesus that's right i was thinking about our brother ilunga and how you know we all look like different seeds that's right you know what i mean would you check out the corn on the cob they got this thing that sticks them together they come out together right and that's how it is that word cements us all together and we appreciate the lord jesus i'm not going to take any more time we ask god that the lord will bless our brother in a special way okay we appreciate the lord jesus christ and let's pull on the gift of god amen amen may the lord god bless you all i'm so grateful to pastor brooks for allowing me for the first time to his spirit to preach about the end-time message amen do not look upon me as i am short but you what we can look look on the greatest of the word of god because the prophet adam said god is adding and revealing by its simplicity when we come from uh from in front of god we have to be humble and we have to be nothing because our hope is built on upon the word of god because others things of this world is seeking sin without further delay you may stand up on your feet and we can read the scriptures we take our bible on the book of judges from verse six the book of charges phase verse six sorry the book of judges chapter 6 starting by verse 7 up to verse 14. i may read it and it came to pass when the children of israel plowed unto the lord because of the monday night that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thou serve the lord of israel i brought you up out of egypt brought you forth out of the house of bondage i deliver you out of the hands of the egyptian and out of the hands of god oppressed you dropped them out from before you and gave you their end and i said unto them i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorite in wolf's land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice listen carefully you have not obeyed my voice and there came a nature of the lord and set under a nuke which was in offering they trained unto jones the abbey right and his son didion threshed with by the one press to add it from the mighty night and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with you don't mind men for veiling and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this before in us and where be all this miracle which our fathers told us saying did not the lord brings us out of egypt but now the lord heads forsaken us and delivered us unto the hand of the mighty night and the lord looked upon him and said go in this dammit and those shall save israel from the hands of the millionaire millions and not i sent thee may god bless is already you may be silly amen amen tonight i bless also i i salute the presence of our shepherd brother pastor john ilunga for attending also to the the service amen to that i have a lyric topic for you and preach you on the topic named if god is if god be with us then where are these miracles amen and tonight we have to ask this question if god be with us then where are these miracles and some somebody can ask this question amen we need to see a supernatural among us in a church when we don't see a supernatural among us to mean we are so weak we make our gods weak we make our god enabled we make our gods unuseful we need to see the manifestation of the only gods among us and when we came in the only places of god we have to see the minds and of god among us and once we preach the gospel of life the gospel of everlasting life we don't see that the fulfillment of the warners and sadness our preaching is in vain we need to see the lord's god among us remember in a book in this book we read when people started wondering what gideon gideon was there the the prophet said in the book of if god be within us then where is all the miracles paragraph theory two the the prophet said the devil cannot set a foot on you the devil cannot end you until first you get away from god until first you get away from god if today the devil can touch us to man we've been astray in god his presence is to die the devil can't put his feet upon us to men we reject the king we reject the egg stone we reject the capstone the action which is god himself under the logos form amen blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ and he says if today we reject him that never can touch us because we reject god you must first remember that check when anything happened in your life and see if you are in the face or not and see that if you are right up to place with god then remember the devil can do you no harm when you live right with god the devil cannot do you no harm hey man the devil cannot do you have no harm you are in christ because in a book of psalms not one that's one which face the word of god said he will dwell in the secret place of the most high shall above all the shadow of their own might when you are in christ you are a bird under the most high very many nothing else the darkness cannot touch you amen the darkness cannot touch you because the word of god said when a when the enemies come like a flood the spirit of god awake as an overshadow they stand hey man when the enemy came like a flood the spirit of god a rest as a stand to defend you and dwell in the heart the most high praise of god from that place the devil cannot touch you from that place no house cannot touch you because you are under the the indian life of christ you are under god's protection you are under god on march and protection but tonight we have to ask if god be with him with us then where is all the mythicals we have to see god speak among us we need to see end of god dealing within us and did you know he was complaining he was complaining god look out the fields then attacked us look at the trials status the troll struck upon your people really god are you within me or not when he starts asking the question the prophet said in paragraph 6 if if you are with god you are the god of the bible that our father tells that performance miracles you may say you are god of the desiccant the death past the same god of the jessica he'll still be able to die fulfill the great oneness and sadness he may fulfill the great earth warriors and sonnets oh let me see the son of miracle amen let me see the sort of paradox when you see the sun erase when when you see the sun gets down that is god is paradox amen that is god's miracles we need to see the paradox of god we need to see the great miracle of god in our life prophet said in paragraph 42. he said no the face that's when god people get in trouble god god always send them the prophet amen when people get in trouble god always send a prophet because a prophet is god's food upon his people amen a prophet is that save the lord god amen that prophet is the reconfidence for the people you crush the lord you will be lord but god hear our christ is sent as a prophet because in the book of luke chapter 7 verse 16 the word of god same a great prophet appeared in bunkhounds and god visits his people amen amen can somebody give a big end approach for the lord jesus christ let me tell you tonight the remarkable ministry of william branham was the response of the holy spirit the response of the holy spirit and through the prophecy of monarchy chapter 4 verse 5 6 luke 17 verse 3 revelation chapter 10 from verse 1 to verse 7 those are the response of the holy spirit those are the response of the holy spirit because the prophet stands still with his god and god responds as through the prophet if god be within us where his all these miracles let us see the paradox of god when you you are sitting there he's the paradox of god when you are coming at the church this is the paradise of god when you pray that is a period of of god when your enemies are strained and fall down that is a paradox of god and god is fulfilling the miracle he's giving you the great the word is stacking in your heart when the threat is awake you come up on the name of the lord jesus christ as the dead give you on call and god hear his voice he responds to him god still be heaven god still behave all right the god of the night is still regarded in the day the god of the valley he's still began in the mountain the god of weeping is the rejoicing god he's the rejoicing god my brothers and my sisters and these prophets let me read it in the book of i'm coming to my subject hey manny an exposition of the seventh seal church edges page uh in a page of we can read it 3 26 the word of god say let us read 3 26 the prophet said though the prophet of monarchy chapter 4 verse 5 to 6 will not publish amen amen he will be very caring by god because a prophet stand with god as jesus of a ticket john the only god's authentic jesus we can well it's bad this man will be first all authentic by the spirit amen working in his life the holy spirit working in his life amen in out of the power god in this table and found nowhere else and jesus himself in returning will authentic him even has authentic john and john the witness that jesus was coming and so will this man let john witnesses that jesus is coming amen and the very returning of christ will power that this man indeed was therefore running the for running off his second coming this is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of malachi 4. amen amen yes sir and this the proof is the prophet of malachi 4 because it's stood with god it stands with god because in all gods we have to hold unchainable hand of the lord jesus christ when desert become dark just all the unchangeable end of god amen and be chief of god move forward do not look on the left or right but look straight to the word of god look straight to the word of god if god is within us then where all this one is unveiling god god fill in the form of a man and himself from the view he make himself view by human side god fills it all that a man formed god inside you see the shadow it's not we are not worshipping amen we cannot worship the man but we are worshipping the death of god instead of the man the paradox of god inside of the man we are washing the miracle guards inside of the man because god himself himself if death a man lack a coverage god getting inside of a man god asked himself and revealing by the paradox of weight amen through the men of god amen amen if god is within us then where all this may become even prophet brought up life this uh what can i say they let people walk the sickness people healed because the world was flowing out the world was coming with powerful the paradox the miracle was was fulfilling all the spots because god's words with his prophet we need to seek out if god is within us then where all this mirror goes we have to see god when you preach the word of god let the sickness to be ill in the name of jesus christ when you preach the word of god let people be delivered because god said i delivered you in the hand of egyptians i brought you the deliverers a prophet is the delivers to us i sent to you the prophet because you reject my voice a prophet is the voice of god in this last day the lord was spoken in seven church edges the same lord god is still speaking tonight he's still speaking to her tonight because we want to see god fulfilling the great with her god we want to see god himself coming upon as the supernatural among us let god open our sight to see the manifestation of his weight amen to see himself fulfilling the great miracle hey man in a message paradox paragraph 27 the prophet said the sun raises and said to show birth death and resurrection it's the same with the life of jesus christ he was alive to show us he loves us by living in love with us that is the great performing miracle god sent us his son his son to save us amen by living in loving us by dying his safe house and by buried he casts away our sin and when he rests the rest of the very sun and shine upon us the voice of god revealing as a trumpet the voice of god's revealing as a trumpet because when you are listening the word of god you have to list the trumpet of god amen the voice of darkness the voice of thunders the tardis is the voice of god that's revealing through the prophetic weight and tonight let somebody all the unchainable end of the lord jesus christ and god always in every case send the people the true servants yes amen in all days he always sent us the two brothers the true servants the true prophet of god amen to save us if god is within us then where is all this with our god let us see god revealing among us let us see god for feeling the greatest oneness let let us see god raising the death amen a church cannot be quiet when there is a life people have to scream you have to scream with the word of god when you listen the word of god you scream amen and amen is setting you free he's taking away the devil he's taking that away the sickness amen he's setting you free because amen means sober hate hey amen listen now brothers and sisters tonight we need to see god revealing us you cannot see god by your fault by your education by your degree of university but you have to see god with the revelation of the word of god have to seek god with the re revelation of the light that came to in this last day the land of god came in this last day amen if god be within us then where is all this miracle see the miracle of god the way you sit there is the miracle of god amen you cannot see the world turn unto the one but the fact that you see that is the miracle of god we were astray we were far from away the truth amen and when the light comes it sets us free it brings us back to the father's faith it brings us back to the light of the end time amen hey man god wants to see you you want to see a living church with the quickened power he wants to see that living church with the quicken weight stand with the weight be the witness of the weight be the soldiers of the weight be now the defender of the weight no matter the mountain can erase no matter people reject you you stay alone but never been alone god still be by your side with god stand with the word of god and god will please himself with you daniel stood in babylon but he did not reject god daniel stood he was alone but praying three times morning afternoon and evening he did not abandon god and god's revealing by himself god revealing himself by daniel amen amen the lord of the bible if we believe the bible is the historical book the bible is also the prophetic book is the prophetic books you are prophetic people with a prophetic prophet and coming in a prophetic edge we need to be saved by a prophetic god be saved by him amen if god be within us then where is all this miracle when they killed you from the week say god i do believe that you are chill over charity you may prophet the prophet the way god still be the same yesterday today and forever he never changed and god changed the form he may get into the pastor john he had himself there for saving you an eye he may go through the past brooks for saving you and i god never changed the weights by each and the forms yesterday he was with moses under the period of cloud he worked it with them when he was having trials they shout to them to to the lord's god and god said i hear your voice i came down to deliver you let tonight make your voice head by god make the voice hear my god make a voice hear my god the lord of william brother never remain with the depths of somebody never stay with a depth of someone we need paradox fulfilled among us amen we need a great revival to shake the town amen we need a great revival to step to shake the state let them hear that our god is so historical but god our god is a real god we can touch him when people reject you when the catholics reject you no matter the human government can reject you we have our heavenly government amen the lord god himself the capstone the provider of our needs because we do believe that the seventh seal the seventh seal is the book of redemption amen is the book of deliverance god came to the delivered house through the book of redemption amen and ask god when your your daughter is when your dad is your mind is full sick say god i need to see your miracle i'm convinced about this message let a message to become a paradox amen let me pray for them because he said for i have given you the power to last your hands upon the sickness to rebuke the devil to rebuild the devil amen you have that power no matter they kept awake let me read for you something yeah psalm chapter 1 18 we may read it amen amen i'm running half the time the word of god said in psalm 118 from verse 6 to verse 12 the lord is my sight i will not fear amen amen for god is for your side you cannot fear amen what can man do to me no man man can do to you fear not amen and noise that is the lord god amen fear not and nor is that amen it's the clouds gazing upon you amen and let us move again the lord is for me among those who help me when you do you do not help me god is not with you hallelujah but it is among those who help me amen therefore i shall see my desire on those who hate me when you hate me you shall see the desire open your enemies amen if somebody loves you he loves god if somebody rejects you in reject god for the bible say for many people welcoming the stranger in the house the welcoming angel without knowing but when you reject strangers in your house you reject god amen god can all use men he can only use men amen you cannot see god by wind stormy winds but you have to see god among men let us keep on amen it is better to trust in the lord than to put conflict in man amen it's better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in the presence verse 10 all nations surrounded me but in the name of the lord i will destroy them amen when your enemies surrounded you use only the name of god there will be destroyed amen they will be completely destroyed amen let it let me move and it says again they surrounded me yes they surrounded me but in the name of the lord i will destroy them their surroundings be like beasts hey man they were quenched like a fire of phones from in the name of the lord i will destroy them amen fear not nation may events may surround you use the name of the lord jesus christ they will be destroyed amen use the quicken weight which is the end of message your enemies shall be destroyed amen amen the message comes to give us victory upon our enemies victory upon the sickness yes the victory happened all the things yes at that a thousand wait in the message at that wait paragraph one the prophet said victory all of it demons that possess the people tonight god has given us the victory over every demon that possess you no matter the satanist a limited people the eras in this nation but god has been has given you the powerful happening amen the powerful is the entire message he told moses what is in your hand why cry speak amen you have to speak when i say speak it don't speak such way pronounce a powerful weight pronounce the weight pronounce the word of god if god be with with us amen where is all the miracles that is the question that is the question everyone asked this question god why are you surrounded me girls why troubles struck me maybe 12 won't strike you because you reached the truth the king has been always rejected when people rejected the king and the king turned the back up on them he looked upon house the gentiles we were bargained and gods feel messed with upon us the nation people as we are but he was preparing to give us the entire message to send us the prophet william branham for him calling us back to the true word of god amen back through back to the truth of ours because we rejected the spirit of life amen but god sent a prophet for us to come upon it and the prophet is there to warp our tears to warp our tears when you see the prophet is the warning of god amen a prophet is the living bible for people who believe to him rejected prophet is to reject god reject the prophet is to reject the word of god a prophet is the miracle amen amen is the great miracle of god when you reject him you reject god for you to reach upon the statue of perfect man you have to up on the stairs amen you have to work upon the faith the virtue knowledge and temperance precious godliness and out up to the living wage which what we call the headstone or the capstone the lord himself amen if god is within us where is all this miracle every yes people they come with sickness they're gone they come at the meeting they went but where is god your god where is your god you say pastors sickness struck my life speak the weight yes sir that's it it's a witness there was not a pharmacy there was no darkness amen there were not a nursing but there was only one darkness moses when people fought sick they was remembered to the promise of that time they used them that is moses moses was adopted for them they was referring to moses amen i am god will ease you for all your sickness and will forgive all your sins let do not god may heal you from your cancer amen tonight god can heal you from your spiritual seek amen your spiritual sin is to reject the perfect truth of god amen but we need to be together as well you have god i have god why division jewish gods i have god where conflict in the church people that come in the church not to be saved but to to create conflict where the spirit of god is people they are free the freedom of the freedom of the truth yes that is a miracle yes it is because you cannot have the freedom of the word of god without the spirit of god when you swell there is god we need to see people saving god powerful do not prevent people amen amen god cannot prevent god [Applause] god will not the truth because he knows that people need to see a miracle amen amen amen in a church we have to form division because when we cross that side will speak one language will speak one language they will not african languages they are not english we will speak the what redeeming great miracle we will speak the redeeming language that we need to stay with the word of god amen where is the church we have to evolve to separate men of god amen even though honest men of god you cannot separate you cannot put conflict between pastors between preacher men no leave them as god lead them to speak amen if you find pastors do not bring your fault and the conflict to the church this is the church of god people need to save by the weight not the separation amen amen all god can save you if you are separating people there is no miracle no matter you can give tough offering while you still be with that conflict god will not eat even to you amen you'll make the ancient of god a strength upon you but let god himself revealing when servant preached the word of god is not preached for challenge you amen but to show you the truth that the truth is god the truth is right we need to say one people god sent us not two prophets but one prophet not two word of god but one word of god amen let me read to you oneness with god amen paragraph 14 listen what the prophet said now the first man and the first woman in the garden of eden was in the perfect harmony with god they were in a perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down when the church is in a perfect harmony god calm down amen when the church is in a perfect harmony with another church your church with another church god will come down amen amen amen i believe this is the word of god it's not me let us move again listen what did the prophet say at any time you desire and talk leave to hear amen with adam and eve god was was going down in the cold of day and speak to adam and eve amen because there was in the perfect harmony with god let me move again now that is perfect oneness what a what a great miracle of god amen to stay oneness with god to stay oneness with the word of god in a good harmony please do not make the church of god where you can gain your bread where you can separate people no please let us stay oneness with god the perfection the more we are moving with the word of god the more god also wants our foot to be cleaned he wants us to stay with his harmony amen let me move again god and his creation god speaking leap to him with adam and eve and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they were one with god god and his family was one the jew of a god was one one is with god what a great miracle amen stay one is with the word of god amen say one i'm going to finish now amen because you need the miracle a miracle cannot come when we are guessing when we are sleeping but a miracle come when you are revived let the revive of the word of god to give you a miracle let me finish now any man and his family is correct good noble obedient family is one with another obedient church is one from the past to his believers and many any family and if there is something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere this family broke it somewhere amen there should all be one amen ephesians chapter 5 six verse four the word of god said one god one baptism one faith amen everything gets by one amen let us stay one amen let us stay one please do not bring conflict where there is god where there is god love is there look dead in a statue of perfect man there is no interest but there is a love for you to reach to the capstone you have to possess a life love that's what god needs let us move again that he grabs me back on because the darkness brought us the hatreds troubles but when the love of god came to us it shunned upon us as a great miracle amen let me go in that god purpose and his purpose as a father supreme was to be one with his family amen earthly family adam and eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with god was because of god nature was in them god legend was with with them please i beg you let us possess god's nature amen amen god nature is to stay with his weight amen no matter trouble comes to you let us repent amen days are moving yes i'm moving amen the signs are moving look where we reach now covey 19. since it starts no change we are moving west west but the blood of god is moving glory to glory eating by healing perfection by perfection serving by serving because you stay with the lord the word of god stay with the word of god this weight is our harmony this word is our weapon this word is our refuge the most refuge of god this way may god bless you all may god bless one is with god amen thank you sir god bless you sir amen we appreciate the word of god amen thank you lord [Music] did you i know that one thing for certain you know he preached his heart and that's what we need amen and one thing for certain about unity we need that we need unity i mean it's everywhere yeah is that true you know brother branham talks about a paradox he said it's gonna it's gonna happen amen sad to say but it's gonna take some pressure to do it but you know one thing about one thing he said which i really really enjoyed that if you have the spirit of god in you the nature of god that itself unites you amen the bible tells us by one spirit we are baptized into one body amen and that's what it is and once you're baptized into that body somehow you like this you're like a guy or you like someone who's got the same spirit in the same nature i think that's why our brother elon and i get along so well amen we appreciate the holy spirit because only god can bring that kind of unity but one thing for certain and i'm i'm really working on a message and i don't want to spill it i don't want to because he's preached so many things on those little points but it's something about that life there's something about that seed god hid this whole bible in a message on the seed the resurrection is in it every life that would come by way of god is in it election is there predestination is in there everything that's why the devil didn't want the true seed of abraham to come does he know he knew once christ would come see that's what people understand that's why you've got to be born again you've got to have the baptism of the holy ghost because that is christ that's the same logos who danced when he was created amen glory there's not another pill of fire it's only one right and that pill of fire is god and that god comes in where here and he said well what do you mean because remember now your natural birth is no good that's right only when the pure fire comes in here that is the only birth that really counts and then once he come in [Music] everything manifests itself because you're working with a perfect seed perfect seed bring a perfect plant bring a perfect tree bring perfect fruit bring perfect everything nothing you do it's all in the seed and that's why brother randall said everything that you need for the rapture is in that seed yes right oh hi so he's sweet y'all y'all can you taste him sometime they can just smack your mouth a little bit you love the lord we do thank god for our precious brother and you want to ask our song to come i really enjoyed him and by god's grace with the pastor um we'll talk about that and maybe having him again sometime we got to get brother lunga here to preach for us he hadn't preached in a long time here but he's not looking for nobody no place to preach but you know what i'm saying pastor is how we are but i appreciate him you know the atmosphere thank you young people you know i i promised him that i was going to have you guys over for cake
