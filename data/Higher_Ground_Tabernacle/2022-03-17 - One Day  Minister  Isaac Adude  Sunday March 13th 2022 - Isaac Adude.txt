give our father god to hear your word jesus but we pray our father god you come the lord jesus and you speak to us we pray our father god that you open on your standing for us the scripture from you we give you all the honor and praise of jesus christ amen amen amen let's turn to james chapter two even so faith if it has no works is dead being the lord amen yea a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me that faith without words and i will show you my my faith by my words amen there are believers that there is one god amen there does well the devil the devil the devil the devil will also believe and tremble but we doubt no o man man the faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the office amen how faith wrought with his words and by words was faith made perfect amen now verse 23 the bible says that and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and he was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a friend of god amen let's go to first peter chapter one read verse 3 to verse 9. first peter chapter 1 verse 3 the bible says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lovely hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead amen to an inheritance incorruptible and undefined and undefiled and uh and that faith another way preserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god having faith under salvation ready to be revealed amen marine he greatly rejoiced through uh don't know for a season if need be you are in you are in heaviness through through many four temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though he betrayed with fire might be found might be found unto praise and honor and glory and the appearing of jesus christ amen whom having not seen he loved amen in whom though now you see him not yet believing amen you rejoice with joy unspeakable amen now verse 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls i'll read again the verse eight because i really love it he said if peter says uh whom having not seen he loved that's right in whom though in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable amen lord amen amen you may see that the symphony i really have a really small uh but god's grace i'm wanting to bring and uh they tied at least faith piece of revelation and faith is a revelation i will start with the prophet uh and uh the message works his faith uh which what's his faith expressed in paragraph 105 the prophet says that now faith is a revelation from god now faith is a revelation there is where i want to stay there just moment it's a revelation that's right amen he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith amen you ever you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of god amen and god reveals it to you therefore faith is revelation and the whole church of god is built upon the revelation amen amen revelation is a really strong uh a very important thing that the bride of christ needs to have amen amen because there is a difference between like i said i think last sunday or the previous one that there's a difference between knowledge and revelation amen in my knowledge if you have a knowledge amen you know that god is real and god you know works miracles that god you know promised us good things in the bible and you know god can do this god said if uh if you say to this mountain to be removed and that mountain will move i mean if you have that knowledge it's good but that knowledge when when when temptation comes or when difficult you meant that knowledge don't stay for no no you need a revolution yes it's a revolution he's an anchor when when you have that revolution you can't be moved know that this is really true amen it's like for example uh uh uh i also said i also gave this example that i have something in me like a treasure and i hide it somewhere and i asked the congregation to tell me what did i eat amen nobody will be able to tell me exactly what i eat amen until i tell somebody about the thing about the treasure that i had yeah and then then you will know exactly what was here it meant that telling that that's the that's the revelation amen i tell you and i reveal i'll reveal it to you i say for example hey brother frank uh i have a diamond here and i hide it's this place so if i go to if i go to the conversion where brother brother frank is there and i asked and i asked who knows uh what i hate amen brother frank will be the only one who will know exactly that that was hidden because because that word was revealed to him amen it's something that is given to us by grace amen it's something that we didn't fight for or something that we don't work out i mean it's it's given to us by grace amen it's like abraham we said that abraham was the father of faith he meant he believed he believed in god for 25 years when all when our hope was against him and that that man was given to him that's right amen says i mean if i want to jump uh in matthew chapter 13 verse 18 to 23 that that that is jesus even giving this parable it says that hearing therefore the parable of the sower when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understand this is not then cometh the wicked one and catches away that which was sung in his heart yeah this is he which received seed by the way of by the wayside verse 20 but he that received the seed into the stony places the same is he that heareth the word and enemy with joy receiveth he he has he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended yeah yeah he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of the world and the the sinfulness of of of riches shook the word and he becometh unfruitful now verse 23 but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth him which also beareth fruit right amen and bringeth forth through some and on 104. and some 60 and some thirty amen amen these are the three uh i think the three types of of of people of the people in the church the prophet says that there are three types of men in the church that there are people who don't believe in no matter how you try to explain to them that god is real no matter how you try to explain to them that even that the word is real amen they just won't believe it you mean there are the second type of people it's those people who force themselves to believe even they try to understand the word so hard and they believe with the intellectuals amen and then the third type is those people who i mean they don't force to believe that that faith has been revealed to them that faith is revelation amen amen those are the people that that jesus said here that those who receive the seed into a good ground amen but now in order for you to have a good ground it's not something that we do or order we try to to work ourself out to do it even if you see a farmer even when he buys a land a medallion comes with many kinds of spaces yeah that land will come with snow or i mean with uh stones that that land will come with even all those things that he doesn't want to yeah but you'll see that the former will have to work on the name and to make it a group ground so that when you when it will start amen uh uh throwing seed that those sin will come and bring forth fruit amen amen it's the same thing with us jesus when he gives his word to us or when he gives him and his promises to us him and he has first to work the land yeah the land which is our heart amen to take away the unbelief he went to take away the death so that when he used his word amen directly to to a good ground and then that will work out and that will produce fruit it means the same thing that ezekiel says in his chapter 33 36 26 and 27 it says that a new heart also will not give and a new spirit will not put within you amen and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh amen and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my stomach and you shall keep my judgment and do them even here it says that a new heart i will give you and when he has first to work our heart and man he has risked to work even to do the work within us and take away the stony heart that heart that doesn't believe the word he might that that word that is always against the word amen he will give us this new heart amen to get along as the prophet said that he meant this new heart to get along with the word amen this new heart to have fellowship with the word and then after that he will put his spirit with him amen amen so that one is spirit amen will be in us amen and then the spirit will receive the that word even that will bring that word to action that will bring that word to be fulfilled amen in order for all of this to happen amen you have to be a part of god right amen you have to be a part of god you have to be in god's body in order for this uh revelation to be given to you like the prophet says that but a man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of god and even in his fallen state yet it's the most greatest species of all the species of the earth he's the man and then get him in connection with his maker he becomes a superman almost because he's the son of god yeah he becomes acquainted with his maker with the creator of all things yes and when that man there acquainted with his uh uh with his maker becomes a part of his maker becomes becomes back into fellowship with his making every divine word becomes a living reality that's he believes it yes no wonder people can believe divine healing today they haven't got nothing to believe with you yes until god comes into the human heart amen is now much better than his reason he'll think it all out how can this be and explain it all the way but when god ever takes his position in the in the in the human heart all the reasonings fade away god becomes first amen amen amen god becomes first amen when god takes away all the all the doubt even when you put it when you give it goes in in our heart the way that the body is built amen there's uh uh the blood is built in three different parts amen there is uh uh there is a spirit there is a heart and then there is a soul amen in the soul that in the soul that's that is where where in the soul there is only two things that's right amen amen it's either death or faith amen amen you either dealt or you oh you have faith those two things cannot be together that's right amen amen that's what when you become a part of god even god will be in you right it will take away all the doubt you know all the god that is inside of you amen you will bring that faith it will bring that atmosphere of faith so that when it gives your word or when you hear the word of god amen you won't doubt it amen amen you won't even ask questions amen mary you meant probably she heard about him and how him and she read before how isaiah i meant give them give the prophecy of of a virgin that will conceive amen when isaiah give that prophecy i mean certainly none of them knew how that prophecy will come to pass sure amen but when did the angel came to mary amen mary only asked one thing to the angel amen how is it going to be amen the angel explain it to her that you will be covered by the holy spirit if i don't understand that after that mary didn't ask any questions amen because that faith was revealed to her she had the revelation of the faith and she directly believed what uh what the angel told it's the same thing with abraham even i mean he was older than him and he couldn't have a son even but when you heard the word of god even when you heard the promise of god that you will have a child amen abraham didn't didn't [Music] in other words abraham zeroed himself he was in target you know his eyes wasn't god's promise even that's why he had that's why he could have faith for 25 years and now you not have doubt amen amen because it's because god made because that faith was revealed to him but when our body becomes in tune with god becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the holy spirit glory to vindicate the presence of the lord jesus christ in all of his power and omnipotence amen he has risen from the dead he lives among us amen and he wants fellowship with his people amen his great majesty his glory is now spreading forth he's he uh uh he he's desiring to fellowship again with his people like he did in the garden of eden amen amen god wants to have god wants to take position in your heart amen that's where he wants to be because like like we said it last sunday amen the church will play with this amen they put jesus christ away they put him outside of the church amen now he's trying he's trying to get in he's right man even knocking into your door saying that hey open i'm here standing amen but when he comes and when he comes with all the benefits amen because they won't say that if you abide in me and my word divine even my word in you amen you can ask whatever you want but first before asking him and you have to abide in him word has to embody you amen [Music] will stand in your way even if you abide in him and his word inviting you even abiding amen means to dwell he also means to anchor amen amen immensely you know to be and want to have one body amen amen it's not it's like that the prophet says that for the third food to become induction amen the bride has to be in one of these ones then they will be able to speak the word and that word will come to be amen amen you have to be in that constant relationship with god amen it has to be a direct line when you go to god and you can speak and you know that exactly that god is here even god would listen to my prayer and everybody will give me the answer amen is that daniel even he was so god he was so in god he embodied god even that when that the bible said that when he set his heart to understand amen about the word he meant the bible said that the god sent his angels him and he's injured to come with with with the answer he meant to respray right and then when he set his heart to understand why because if daniel he brought it daniel about him christ even daniel was so in god amen in his word god's word was in him amen but he had no other destruction than praying and reading the word right amen but when it then when he understood that the judgment is about to come and he said it's hard to understand even about how many days was left how many weeks was left amen then the angel amen god the angel was sent with the nestor amen before he even opened his mouth and his answer was already sent amen because god knows our heart god serves amen god knows our desire god knows our prayers even god came here and then we serve a god who is different than an idol they may idols have mouths but they can't speak yeah amen i don't have ears but they can't hear have eyes but they can't see amen but we serve a living room answer to our prayers who can hear our prayers and get an answer yes we must focus our lives not what somebody else says yes but focus our lives to him amen and he is the word see amen if we get our lives in line with the word then the word in our life becomes the same amen if you invited me in my word in you then ask what you will it'll be created to you yes verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that believe that what you say what you have said will come to pass you can't have what you have said oh my not what i say about what you say you can have it because you and he become the same amen because i believe the mind that was in christ is in you amen and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word amen which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of god amen our grace amen the mind that was in christ he meant he becomes you amen amen amen everything that you say him and you'll be like amen you'll be like in the creation amen when adam was naming naming the the animals amen everything that adam was saying even god the response was amen yeah even because adam was expressing him and the thought of them if you become in tune with god and your reactions will those people kissing in the church amen god was waiting there waiting for the prophet to pray to say something but when the prophet was up he said that i forgive you guys say that that is exactly what i wanted place in that position amen whatever god thinks amen we will be able to say amen our words will be god's thought amen amen our words will be god's thoughts amen that's why one amen amen that was why that's the reason why the word was given to us amen and faith demand was was designed amen to know the wills and the wants of god yeah even faith was given to us a man to know what god wants and what what the will of god is he meant that that was the purpose of faith amen it's like david even with his soldiers he met david after coming from a war event david was thirsty amen he wanted to drink that water from breath for him amen he just expressed his will yeah and those three soldiers took that wheel and that one became an ordinary yeah they went in and they fought and then they broke back the water back to david and that that is where every christian has to be women to look at god and see when god knows amen we know exactly that what god wants amen we take that will and then he became lucky like a commandment yes sir i can't i don't want to close my eyes until amen i have a place of worship for god amen it becomes a burden to us until we fulfill that desire [Applause] we preached the last time we met about the symphony amen to be indirectly in connection amen the leader and the musicians amen whatever the leader is guiding wherever the leader is guiding the musicians amen that's what he will play whatever god is saying even that's the thing that we will do amen wherever god wants us to be even that's where we will be amen whatever wherever god wants us to go that's what we do to give ourselves to me even to become [Music] waiting for noah to touch and then that's how we have to be amen like jesus amen his prayers say the lord not my will but that will lord amen to take away to kill ourselves we make sure that you must say that god takes control of the of us amen because it's the tower it's the tower that is a tower that needs to be inside of us amen to guide us to lead us he meant to warn us when dangers are coming amen to give us whatever we want it meant to be to take that will they meant to kill ourselves like paul said i kill myself daily amen my will amen so that god god god takes full control of me and when the prophet continues he says now now listen now listen real close to this remark faith now don't forget don't forget to get this now faith is designed to see what god wills and wants there there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and give to the human race to find out what the will of god is and you take your faith that you got and you don't focus with the word then leave it alone if you take the if you take your faith that you got and if that faith don't focus with the word just leave it alone you got the wrong faith but when your god but but when you're god given faith focus you with the word of god you're directly in line and zeroed oh my god help us this hour great hour that we live in faith designed to see what god wants how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise this is a full revelation of jesus christ amen there is a course i mean for uh engineers and and and and i'm pretty sure technicians also it meant that that when we study about the machine or a machine or a computer or a machine if all the parameters if all the settings of the machine goes wrong and then we call it to zero i mean to bring the machine back it meant to how the manufacturer it meant how the well the machine was manufactured amen immense and we've we zeroed ourselves amen when when things are going wrong and man when all the settings in of our lives amen they don't they don't they don't line up again with god's word amen we can come back to calvary amen that's the point that's the point of refuge amen that's the origin amen to zeroed ourselves amen we will see directly what god sees amen we will hear it directly amen what god wants amen one will become zero even when we go back to the origin amen to calvary amen that's where we want to be amen to zeroed ourselves amen like he made us amen like he created us amen like he wanted us like you want us to be it meant to be to depend on him he meant to depend on him amen to give us that ability even to enforce the law of god amen amen amen to the world amen to give us that ability amen to go and to claim whatever amen belongs to us amen to give us that ability amen to go and to claim amen because when he died on the cross amen like john described it john said that god said that it is finished amen everything that he ever promised to us amen was fulfilled right there on the cross even now it's our job now it's our time now to go and to claim amen whatever belongs to us and when you go claim amen you don't go to negotiate amen when you're claiming it's not negotiating it means it's way different claiming it's going with authority amen it's like david after coming back from the war amen his wives and and and and and all the the women of the of the of the land was taken and when david went to the enemy it meant to claim back what belonged to him amen david went there and then he didn't negotiate with the with the philistines amen but he went with the authority that he had the word of god that everything that i give you amen belongs to you amen he went with that word he meant to to to reclaim to claim back amen everything that belongs to amen when we see amen that we're going through the same time we mean even the same troubles it meant that every that the joy that we have for god amen it's been taken away from us amen the love of god you can't feel god anymore amen your connection with god is no longer there or is not how you want it to be amen you can go and claim whatever that belongs to you amen god will give it to you as long as you have faith amen as long as you have faith and where as long as you sincere amen it's like god said to the prophet he said that when you're sincere amen you can bind the serpent amen only if you're sincere amen it's only sincere the amen that can do the work amen when there is no other one there is no doubt amen that one faith is there amen when that faith has been revealed to you amen then you can bind the serpent amen then you can cast out the evils and and and and serve god i mean we have to enforce the law of god i mean like david did amen when his wives and and and the people of the city i mean when so it wasn't they were in captivity even he went there to claim them back and then he went there to claim them back james and paul even they gave amen in the bible two different point of view of faith even james explained faith as you know uh uh uh i mean uh justification jim said that you mean uh exactly explain faith amen like the uh uh the thing uh uh uh gems how can i say james said in the bible that faith is expressed by the works in other words james was saying that when you have faith the way men can see it amen men can only see your faith when their faith is with words amen when that faith is accomplished you know comes with words i mean when you show your word the works of faith i mean that's that is when amen men can see faith by the way uh paul explained he said that god amen god see him and god sees it amen in other words uh uh how can i say amen men see the works amen god sees the faith amen that's that's how the you know that's how they explained it amen men sees him and james when he was talking amen was talking about men's point of view amen about the works and paul amen was talking about amen what god sees him and god sees our god sees our faith amen because the works amen work is the weakness of faith amen work is the witness of faith you cannot say that you have faith when that faith doesn't have words amen what are you going to say what what how are you going to prove to me that you have you have faith i mean you have to show me those experiences amen you have to show me what god has done with you amen what is god what is what god has done to you amen it's a david when he went to seoul emma david just didn't go with simple words i mean but david went with experiences saying that hey uh god is with me and god always protects me it looks so i was there and you know with the sheep and this lion came in and god with god's help i killed that lion amen i killed that bear what david came amen with with experiences amen with the works of his faith amen that's the same way that you can cast the devil amen it's when you have when you come in with the faith amen amen when you try to remember amen about what god has done for you amen it's like the other day that when the prophet was praying for that blind man amen he prayed for the first time and the the men didn't they didn't recover inside even the prophet i mean the devil started to to bring like the bad thoughts and saying that hey god uh this time it won't work and god will not hear your prayer amen the prophet says that what what helped him and he started to remember amen what god has done for him and when he started to remember amen the experiences that he had with god how god healed him and other people amen that brought him and that that atmosphere amen that built up again his faith he meant and then he prayed for the second time he met that blind man recovered his side amen amen faith amen works is the weakness of faith amen the prophet says that so is faith that doesn't so he's fifth that doesn't produce works anyone anyone has a anyone has a right to doubt your faith your testimony now do you hear it before we start the prayer line if your faith doesn't produce works if it doesn't produce works with it you can't make anyone believe that you're healed say well i don't know why sure i got all the faith in the world prophecy that you don't because if you are or if you got faith then works is married to faith their husband and wife one identifies the other one amen you can't say to people amen amen amen you can't say to people that you got all the faith in the world even when you don't have the work that expresses it amen their husband and wife amen they are in perfect harmony amen you can't take the other and leave the other one and you leave the other one inside him and they have to be all together amen faith and works amen both of them working together amen it's god who gives us faith amen it's god who gives us faith by his grace amen is god who gives us that revelation of faith amen before god gave his promise to abraham even god had to work abraham's soul or abraham's heart amen so that when his promise will be given to abraham even abraham would believe in that promise amen abraham will have faith in that promise amen when you find yourself that you don't have faith in men you can go to god amen and god will quicken that faith amen that god will quicken him and that's sleeping faith inside of you amen and then you will have faith in his word amen because faith is a revelation amen the revelation is given by god alone imma revelation is a gift from god amen it's a gift that is freely even given forgiven given it's a it's a gift that is freely given by him amen because you will see that not you know before moses they didn't have the bible before moses but how amen amen how did those people even have faith in god's word amen before moses they didn't have any bible to read and to to know that hey if god did this with uh uh that did this with this this person before so i'm in the same situation so i can go to god and pray amen but those people he meant they had faith in god amen they believed in god you see moses him and he had faith in god he knew that god can open the red sea even he had faith in god why because that faith was revealed to him amen the word of god was revealed to me to him and he said that woman amen who was losing blood amen the prophet says that before her the bible doesn't recall or the bible doesn't say about the bible doesn't talk about any other woman who was losing blood before her even she was actually the first case of of a person losing blood in the bible it meant but she had faith he meant that if i touch the hem of his garment amen i know that i'll be here amen her faith was so strong amen she didn't care about touching the body of jesus she didn't care about hugging jesus amen but she only cared about him and if i touch one part of jesus image that includes even god's garment amen it's like those people amen even the shadow of jesus amen could give healing it meant as long as she had faith as long as you have faith even that woman had faith amen she didn't care about about her case being the first one in the bible even she didn't care about her case he meant being the first one that has ever been done in the bible image but she had faith and faith breaks all the barriers amen freak there is nothing that can stand against faith amen faith will break through amen if you have faith faith will break through amen it doesn't matter how big is the thing amen if you have faith amen you will him and your faith will seal through amen if it doesn't matter if your your challenge amen or or your your trial is is big like goliath amen faith is able it meant to cut goliath's head amen faith is able he meant to to to break him and jericho's wall even faith is able immensely to to overcome everything amen if you only have faith in god amen if you only have faith in god amen because abraham knew that his body was good it was good as dead but he considered not his body his own body he considered not the deadness of sarah's womb a young girl a young girl uh he had married his half-sister lived with her all these years and now she's 90 years old and he's a hundred years old but he didn't even think about that that didn't even come in his mind why he had focused all his unbelief out amen oh glory that's what the church shall do that's what each member of the church should do amen would focus out will focus out of you with focus out of your ordeal look only to that word he promised it god said so i got to be that way amen if you can focus in god's word amen if you can focus his promise him and he says that amen don't think about tomorrow because as i take care of the little bird amen i will take care of you amen he gave that word amen you just focus yourself in that word amen women put your focus in that word and you will see it through amen you didn't ask god to say to you know to give all those promises amen you never asked god to give all these promises but he gave it to his own free will amen as long as he gave it amen he will see it through amen amen you just have to focus him and like abraham he closed his eyes he's closed his ear amen from all the unbelief for all those bad thoughts that could come to him amen sarah sometimes could have come to abraham and start complaining abraham amen it's been 10 years but there is no son amen abraham had his focus amen on god's promise amen he knew that god gave his word amen and god god's word amen when god's word is given amen itself it's like it's that that word is already fulfilled even abraham had that faith him and he focused himself he meant to that promise amen if today he meant tonight amen we can focus ourselves amen whatever situation we find ourselves in amen we can focus ourselves into that promise of god amen that god will always take care of us that everything that we ask in jesus name amen will he will give it to us amen if we have faith amen you will you will see it and he said that cast all your cares upon him because he takes good care of you amen wherever you need whatever you need amen just speak the word amen it's like god told moses moses why are you crying amen moses why are you human crying amen just speak the word amen and then i will divide the red sea amen god is telling us why are we crying amen what are we why are we crying why are we even complaining about the situation amen why are we complaining about the hard time about the trials amen just speak the word amen just speak the word and then you will see the solution amen just speak the word amen you will see the healing amen just speak the word amen whatever you need your prayer amen you will see it being fulfilled amen plead your case at calvary amen because the crimson blood of christ amen paid all the debt amen and declares and declares you not guilty amen therefore you have now amen amen the authority amen that was given to god amen that that authority demon is given to you amen that you can go and claim whatever that whatever amen whatever that that belongs to you amen amen amen god didn't do it just for the sake of doing it and he deeded him and so that we can use it amen for so that we can use it and our joy be fulfilled amen that's that's what he promised amen that's what he said amen he gave us all those words amen so that the least of the believers even when they take that promise of god him at the entire entire hell him and is under them amen the least of believers they meant the weakest of all the believers even when they take the promise of god they might want to take the promises of god even the devil will be under them amen as the prophet says that then the least of these believers no matter how long or little or whatever you are the least of his believers as as in him as as all evil under them look cross is the head of the body is that right well whatever the head is the bodies with it glory where my head goes it takes my body with it and where jesus is the church is with him amen he don't get out of his word he stays in he stays in his word watches over it to make it manifest his church he's with him amen amen his church is with him wherever wherever the body is what i mean whatever the head is amen that's where the body will be amen however man wherever the body is amen that's where the body will be where the head is that's where the body will be amen whatever the head says amen that's what the body will do amen if the head says that you are you are an overcomer amen that's why the body with the body will have to behave himself as an overcomer amen jesus said jesus was the head of the body amen he said that you are overcomer amen he make he made you more than overcome amen you who are the body man you have to behave yourself as an overcomer and when you don't you have to stop complaining amen you have to stop a man complaining and crying amen even saying him and like brother books usually say that white me lord amen because the promise has been given to you amen a promise has been given to you you have to behave your servants and overcome amen like david when he was going to goliath him and david didn't go to goliath complaining hey lord amen how am i going to build this goliath look at how huge he is or or how big he is amen david had the word of god amen david was walking the goliath amen as an overcomer and my david was walking to goliath as if goliath was already dead amen that's the same way we have to work if we have to walk even walk amen amen with that with our shoulders aiming up in the air even saying that god's word is true amen whatever god says him and daddy will do amen having that faith with us amen then you will have him and then you'll have every all the answers of your prayers amen then you will see god fighting with your battles amen then you will see god amen amen leading you amen through through the valley of death he meant through darkness amen amen god will be your light amen the word of god will be your life amen amen the word faith is a revelation now remember this christ is a true cross in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it look warm formal and powerless he exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and and and the discreting of his of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that the people he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that and that she can't do the greater works she will be an invisible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of of of of the christian of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the enter the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her amen he will be as he will be as uh definitely uh uh authority today as when cross withstood we've withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen with true revelation in our hearts even the gates of hell cannot prevail against us amen with true revelation on our hearts amen there is no immense sickness in hell amen that can stand against us amen with true revelation in our heart amen there is no amen hard times amen that can stand against us amen with true revelation in our heart amen there is no red sea that can stand against us amen with true revelation our heart amen there is no jordan reaver amen that can stand against us amen because with the word amen we will speak the word and those rivers will be divided amen we'll speak the word amen and we will walk on dry land amen satan hates revelation amen but we love it amen because we know that once we have that revelation amen nothing can move us i mean we know that once we have that revelation amen nothing can move us i mean it doesn't matter amen if if we have troubles it meant before us and and and the egyptians behind us amen even the red sea on the other side of the land amen we want fear amen because we know that we have that revelation and once we have that revelation our anchor it is in jesus amen nothing can move us amen our anchored is in him nothing can move us it doesn't matter how strong is the water amen we know that we won't move amen because jesus is there amen because jesus is in the boat amen jesus will come the sea for us amen we won't have to fear amen we don't have to fret amen jesus is there amen he gave his word amen and then he as the prophecy that he will not rest even until he sees that word being fulfilled amen he will not rest him and until we all decide amen amen is that revelation has been given to us amen we won't move amen because god is there and then in closing i'll read this word of the prophet he says that where did the dove come from up there in the wilderness i said this god seen abraham god said that abraham needed a realm for his son he is jehovah gyra the lord can provide for himself a sacrifice to think of

deliverance amen the prophet for his sickness he meant he he was praying god and and god waited until he's about to die until god gave him his the healing of his body but you understand that the
