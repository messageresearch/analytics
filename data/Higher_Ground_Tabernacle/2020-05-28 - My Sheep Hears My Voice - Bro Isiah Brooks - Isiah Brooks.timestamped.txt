[56:56] we're going to have just a little short
[56:58] message
[57:00] tonight TR that it will be an
[57:02] encouragement to
[57:04] you I I believe that we're living in the
[57:06] last
[57:08] days I believe that uh what we see the
[57:12] corona is
[57:17] doing stage for the next
[57:20] way and I want to tell you something
[57:23] people of God
[57:25] our Prophet told
[57:27] us that there were coming a
[57:30] virus that will literally eat the
[57:34] flesh away from the bones of
[57:37] men while they yet
[57:41] live and I really
[57:43] believe that whatever is bringing these
[57:47] things upon the
[57:53] Earth because we know it is man's
[57:58] intelligence always backfire on
[58:02] him and we are living in an intellectual
[58:06] age living in an age somewhat like
[58:10] Esther lived
[58:13] in where God is hardly
[58:17] known here we are in
[58:19] America founded upon religious and
[58:22] Christian
[58:23] principles
[58:25] there are so many
[58:28] millions who never met
[58:31] God never called on the name of Jesus
[58:33] Christ in
[58:36] sincerity but thank
[58:39] God the Bible says he's never left
[58:42] himself without a
[58:45] witness I'm so glad to be one of
[58:49] them real to them
[58:52] I he real to me
[58:56] it's not
[58:57] a my
[59:00] imagination but God is
[59:03] real I know
[59:05] him and he knows me let us
[59:10] turn to the
[59:13] scripture according to St John John amen
[59:18] the 10th
[59:22] chapter Hallelujah
[59:25] I love triumphing over the
[59:29] devil right he's GNA give us
[59:33] battles battles will
[59:36] come but I like whooping
[59:40] him and every time he he causes me to
[59:44] stumble God has a
[59:47] word get up more than one word that's
[59:50] more than one
[59:52] word and he called causes Us by his own
[59:57] inspiration to get
[59:59] up he's our unseen
[1:00:03] helper the world can't see
[1:00:06] him but we know when he's
[1:00:09] around John
[1:00:19] 1027 my
[1:00:22] inspiration uh came by the
[1:00:27] message William brandham
[1:00:30] um The Great and Mighty
[1:00:34] conqueror we know that he is and was the
[1:00:37] uh mouthpiece of God in his
[1:00:40] day now The Same Spirit of
[1:00:43] Elijah on
[1:00:46] Elisha which is the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ and she is
[1:00:52] resounding have already been
[1:00:57] sounded The Book of Revelation tells
[1:01:01] us hallelujah in
[1:01:04] 10ap chapter that we must prophesy
[1:01:08] again and we're living in that
[1:01:12] day not adding to it nor taking
[1:01:17] away now we have a better
[1:01:21] light because we're living in the day
[1:01:26] that he spoke of
[1:01:28] Hallelujah
[1:01:30] prophecy has made been made
[1:01:33] clear by all of these modern
[1:01:38] events it reassures

[1:03:15] of
[1:03:16] death in my
[1:03:18] flesh but the man inside of this This
[1:03:22] Old House
[1:03:24] needs
[1:03:27] repairall Hallelujah but understand by
[1:03:30] God's

[1:03:52] than all
[1:03:55] no man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:03:58] father's

[1:04:04] statement

[1:04:44] in their own
[1:04:45] name will receive
[1:04:48] them there's coming a
[1:04:51] deceitful
[1:04:53] individual
[1:04:55] that will make the world

[1:05:00] savior Hallelujah and they will follow
[1:05:04] him it is their
[1:05:07] punishment it is God's
[1:05:10] judgment because when he brought when he

[1:05:36] 18 we start reading at the 33rd
[1:05:44] verse you have that
[1:05:47] place then pilate entered into the
[1:05:50] Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and
[1:05:54] said to him art thou the king of the
[1:06:02] Jews and Jesus answered him saying thou
[1:06:07] this thing excuse me saying thou this
[1:06:10] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[1:06:14] deed of Me Jesus
[1:06:21] rep pilot answered I am a Jew thine own
[1:06:26] nation and the chief priest have
[1:06:28] delivered thee unto me what hast thou
[1:06:37] done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[1:06:41] this world I
[1:06:44] love if my kingdom were of this
[1:06:48] world then would my servants
[1:06:52] fight that I should not be delivered
[1:06:55] unto the
[1:06:57] Jew but now is my kingdom not from
[1:07:02] hence one of these old
[1:07:05] days this world will come the
[1:07:10] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ he's already fought for
[1:07:17] it the price has already been
[1:07:21] paid one of these old days
[1:07:25] the same
[1:07:26] people this world made mockery
[1:07:30] of was set in the
[1:07:33] seat with Jesus
[1:07:37] Christ pilate therefore said unto
[1:07:41] him thou a
[1:07:44] King Jesus
[1:07:46] answered thou say I am a
[1:07:49] king to this end was I
[1:07:52] born and for this cause came I into the
[1:07:57] world that I should bear
[1:08:00] witness unto the
[1:08:02] truth and everyone that is of the truth
[1:08:05] heareth my
[1:08:09] voice pilate said unto him what is
[1:08:14] truth and when he had said
[1:08:18] this he went out again unto the
[1:08:22] Jews here he goes and he says unto them
[1:08:26] I find in him no
[1:08:31] fault here
[1:08:34] God
[1:08:35] allowed the king of this
[1:08:39] world to
[1:08:41] acknowledge that there was no fault in
[1:08:45] Jesus maybe you may not understand this
[1:08:48] judgment
[1:08:50] Hall but every lamb
[1:08:54] you may be seated every
[1:08:57] lamb that was to be offered unto
[1:09:01] God had to be examined by the
[1:09:05] priest and Jesus being the Lamb of
[1:09:09] God he had to be
[1:09:12] examined oh they tried to find
[1:09:15] fault Hallelujah from judgment Hall they
[1:09:19] led the
[1:09:21] lamb he went to Pilot
[1:09:25] and they couldn't find no
[1:09:27] fault Herod couldn't find no
[1:09:30] fault all of those who examined
[1:09:34] him couldn't find any
[1:09:37] fault so they had to bear false
[1:09:42] witness but they failed to
[1:09:45] see truth is
[1:09:49] Everlasting a lie may run
[1:09:52] fast
[1:09:54] but truth
[1:09:59] endures you can never Stamp Out
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:04] truth
[1:10:07] because he said it I am the truth and I
[1:10:11] am the
[1:10:12] way let's
[1:10:15] go I
[1:10:17] thought because I'm I'm I'm just
[1:10:20] thinking about how God has has enveloped
[1:10:24] us he's so engaged
[1:10:27] us with his love and his word is his
[1:10:32] love he's he's
[1:10:34] literally his word and and and
[1:10:37] surrounded
[1:10:38] us understand what I'm saying he is our
[1:10:41] protection even when you don't even know
[1:10:43] he's there he's
[1:10:45] there it's like when he rose from the
[1:10:49] dead and he was on the road
[1:10:52] to and here were these
[1:10:54] disciples is that right who actually
[1:10:57] were under his
[1:11:00] ministry and they could not recognize
[1:11:04] him the Bible said that he took the word
[1:11:07] of
[1:11:08] God and he started all the way from
[1:11:11] Moses and all the way
[1:11:13] up he preached Jesus Christ did you know
[1:11:17] that Jesus Christ is on every page of
[1:11:21] this book it takes a prophet to pull it
[1:11:27] out Jesus was the
[1:11:31] prophet prophet of all prophets he began
[1:11:35] to
[1:11:36] expound I can't imagine what their
[1:11:38] hearts felt
[1:11:40] like Jesus began to
[1:11:42] talk you understand me the very man that
[1:11:46] they so
[1:11:47] loved is now is now hiding
[1:11:52] himself and and the first thing he
[1:11:55] says which should be something that we
[1:11:58] should hear with our
[1:12:00] hearts all
[1:12:02] fools and slow at
[1:12:06] heart in other words what is it going to
[1:12:08] take
[1:12:09] you what must I do what must God do to
[1:12:14] make you believe
[1:12:15] all the scriptures have said about
[1:12:19] Christ some of the
[1:12:21] things all the things
[1:12:26] Christ was to
[1:12:27] suffer and
[1:12:30] die
[1:12:32] heathens Hallelujah but it's also
[1:12:35] written that he shall rise
[1:12:38] again and being that it is the third
[1:12:42] day you to be looking for him come on
[1:12:46] somebody you and I must
[1:12:50] understand is it
[1:12:51] not the third day
[1:12:55] day is it not since Luther
[1:13:00] started it is the third day and we
[1:13:03] supposed to be looking for the
[1:13:05] resurrection supp to all that the
[1:13:08] scriptures have
[1:13:10] said is he not walking Among Us
[1:13:15] now right in their mist and they could
[1:13:20] not see
[1:13:21] him but the problem
[1:13:25] they had so many things in their
[1:13:27] minds oh we thought Jesus was the Christ
[1:13:31] thought he was the one we thought he was
[1:13:34] the true
[1:13:35] Messiah dead
[1:13:38] now can you imagine talking to the
[1:13:41] Messiah talking to
[1:13:43] Jesus
[1:13:47] Hallelujah the whole
[1:13:49] time so I want to say something to you
[1:13:53] the one thing that Jesus
[1:13:55] did he got them off of the
[1:13:58] road into a small
[1:14:03] end he took them away from the cares of
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:08] world said he shut the
[1:14:12] door it was that time of
[1:14:16] communion it was that time of
[1:14:19] Fellowship let me tell you like this if
[1:14:22] you can separate
[1:14:24] from all
[1:14:26] unbelief from all the noise of the world
[1:14:30] somebody from all the
[1:14:32] voices Hallelujah in the world
[1:14:36] Hallelujah and calm yourself down so
[1:14:40] that you can be able to hear his
[1:14:42] voice it is then when God will begin to
[1:14:46] break the
[1:14:47] bread Hallelujah somehow he broke the
[1:14:51] bread and the Bible said their eyes were
[1:14:55] open hallelu let me say it like this no
[1:14:58] nobody can break the
[1:15:00] bread like Jesus
[1:15:02] himself Hallelujah
[1:15:05] now we must understand that our kingdom
[1:15:08] is not of this world
[1:15:12] order this world but really it means
[1:15:15] World
[1:15:16] Order there order to this world that
[1:15:19] we're not a part
[1:15:22] of this order uh uh can I say it this
[1:15:25] order amen uh um Praises
[1:15:30] Lucifer lucif Hallelujah this order uh
[1:15:34] uh uh uh uh glorifies
[1:15:39] death this
[1:15:41] order that we're living in is full of
[1:15:44] troubles and full of woes and you know
[1:15:48] and in
[1:15:49] science and you know they seem like they
[1:15:52] they're trying to f fix things and every
[1:15:54] time they try to fix it they break they
[1:15:58] make things
[1:16:00] worse Hallelujah see God's creation was
[1:16:05] perfect but
[1:16:07] mankind haveed it one of the things I
[1:16:11] want to throw
[1:16:13] out you know they have this thing they
[1:16:15] call

[1:21:20] Fortress salvation is our for
[1:21:24] Fortress hallelujah amen is that right
[1:21:27] the B Bible tells about a wall of
[1:21:30] fire but he also tells us that the fire
[1:21:33] is on the
[1:21:34] inside so he's not just around us with
[1:21:37] us but he's in
[1:21:39] us hallelujah my subject
[1:21:43] tonight would be my sheep heareth my
[1:21:48] voice and if I had a
[1:21:51] subtopic it would be scream for he has
[1:21:54] finished
[1:21:56] it I like that I tell people sometime on
[1:22:00] the
[1:22:01] phone I I'll holler at you
[1:22:06] later it's a certain figure a a
[1:22:10] term because back in the day we didn't
[1:22:12] have
[1:22:14] telephones and then when we needed a
[1:22:16] neighbor get to get somebody's
[1:22:19] attention we would
[1:22:21] holler like if my brother and
[1:22:25] I would be a block away or something
[1:22:27] like
[1:22:28] that my mother or my
[1:22:31] sister would call they go to the front
[1:22:35] porch or the
[1:22:36] back and they will
[1:22:41] holler and if you didn't hear the First
[1:22:44] Time The Voice was
[1:22:47] elevated and they kept
[1:22:50] hollowing until you answer
[1:22:53] answer and sometimes we had to
[1:22:56] run to get in a a
[1:23:00] space
[1:23:02] distance where they could hear us
[1:23:09] respond now we got all these phones and
[1:23:11] stuff you know we don't we don't need
[1:23:13] this we just need
[1:23:15] buttons that's where it came from so
[1:23:18] sometimes when I say yeah I'll see you
[1:23:20] later man I'll holl at you
[1:23:23] that's what it's all
[1:23:24] about amen but not on the phone we can
[1:23:27] just talk

[1:23:30] Lord he goes on to say open ye the gates
[1:23:35] that the righteous Nation would keep it
[1:23:38] the truth may enter
[1:23:41] inall think about it I was thinking last
[1:23:45] night last night the scripture says he
[1:23:49] that is just let him be just
[1:23:51] f rightous let him be right he that is
[1:23:55] Holy and he that is filthy let him be
[1:23:58] filthy and it come to my mind like you
[1:24:01] know God was speaking to my heart
[1:24:03] because don't you know that scripture
[1:24:05] has to be
[1:24:06] fulfilled and none of us know the day
[1:24:09] and the hour where the
[1:24:13] judge will say that's
[1:24:17] enough Hallelujah my sheep hears my
[1:24:21] voice you and I must understand that God
[1:24:25] loves us so much we're now living in his
[1:24:29] longsuffering Hallelujah but even so the
[1:24:33] long suffering of God has a period of
[1:24:36] time when it's going to run
[1:24:39] out Hallelujah that's why the Bible says
[1:24:42] in the day that you hear his
[1:24:45] voice your heart understand me God Is So
[1:24:49] merciful to
[1:24:51] us
[1:24:53] his grace unmerited love he gives
[1:24:57] us we don't even deserve it I don't I
[1:25:02] don't know how you stand with that but I
[1:25:05] know
[1:25:06] myself I don't deserve
[1:25:09] it sometimes I just
[1:25:11] weep because of my no knowledge of how
[1:25:15] many times I can disappoint God in a
[1:25:21] day I know he still loves
[1:25:25] me
[1:25:28] Hallelujah those who keep it the
[1:25:32] truth you understand me truth is is to
[1:25:36] be
[1:25:37] kept this is why I love the Jewish
[1:25:40] people because they have
[1:25:43] kept what they see as
[1:25:45] truth they know there's only one God and
[1:25:49] they have kept that all of these
[1:25:53] sons and they love
[1:25:57] him they don't they don't have what we
[1:25:59] have we supposed to have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:02] all they got is
[1:26:04] Law and they still on
[1:26:07] it no matter how people hate them no
[1:26:11] matter how many people despises them the
[1:26:14] real
[1:26:15] Jew the real man of God or woman of
[1:26:20] God still esteem Jehovah
[1:26:27] Hallelujah let me go back to that again
[1:26:30] he will keep you in perfect
[1:26:32] peace that is so important because you
[1:26:35] got so many people who are
[1:26:37] afraid now afraid and in this time where
[1:26:42] everybody is crying because of
[1:26:45] fear the God said it ought to be a
[1:26:47] Shouting
[1:26:49] Time Hallelujah I got the victory
[1:26:53] he gave me the
[1:26:55] victory Hallelujah there is no failure
[1:26:58] in
[1:26:59] God I know this is simple but somebody
[1:27:03] needs we have people out there who

[1:27:09] that they have been a failure today but

[1:27:54] lost this that and the other let me say
[1:27:58] it like this when God shut Egypt
[1:28:03] down it never changed his ability to
[1:28:08] provide Hallelujah this time they weren

[1:28:26] something because it is
[1:28:28] important that we have the ability to

[1:28:35] voice why because he's the
[1:28:39] shepherd he's the one that leads us and
[1:28:42] you know and I know that our day is so

[1:54:51] understand what he's
[1:54:55] saying is that right give me one more
[1:54:58] scripture Proverbs Proverbs please first

[1:55:05] intend
[1:55:06] to not tell the truth
[1:55:09] but I get stirred up I get carried away
[1:55:11] I
[1:55:16] guess Proverbs the first
[1:55:18] chapter did we go there
[1:55:22] already okay Proverbs
[1:55:25] 1over beginning at the 26
[1:55:29] vers so I want you to see what's
[1:55:31] happening
[1:55:32] now all these places who
[1:55:36] say God is not he's
[1:55:40] dead I heard one uh uh great so-called
[1:55:44] man of
[1:55:48] God Jesus made made a mistake when he
[1:55:50] let him
[1:55:54] crucify
[1:55:56] and when I heard that I
[1:55:59] said I'm so glad he made that
[1:56:02] [Laughter]
[1:56:05] mistake Hallelujah remember that right
[1:56:08] and I'm I guess I'm going to jump the
[1:56:09] scripture because the time is going but
[1:56:12] when he he was on the
[1:56:13] cross the Pharisees the Sadducees all of
[1:56:16] them those groups of people even oh
[1:56:20] he can save
[1:56:22] others but but he can't save
[1:56:26] himself what a
[1:56:28] compliment that he saved
[1:56:31] himself we would still be
[1:56:34] lost God he didn't save himself he could
[1:56:37] have called 10,000 angels all he had to
[1:56:41] do was move one of his
[1:56:43] fingers you understand me he destroyed
[1:56:47] Satan by one finger all he had to do was
[1:56:50] move one thinger and all of the angels
[1:56:53] that were setting in the
[1:56:55] tree Hallelujah they would have reaped
[1:56:59] havoc on the
[1:57:04] world hallelujah amen they better be
[1:57:08] glad all Jesus would have had to say was
[1:57:14] hell hey all of Heaven would have been
[1:57:17] dispatched they would have had to make
[1:57:19] new
[1:57:21] world you love the Lord Proverbs 1 26 he

[1:58:25] this country would have repented that's
[1:58:27] all God
[1:58:28] requires but instead of repenting we
[1:58:31] boast
[1:58:32] ourselves we're going to make this
[1:58:34] nation

[1:59:54] the message came the evening light came
[1:59:57] and they refused it they didn't want it

[2:09:19] that's how it is with God we fail we F
[2:09:24] us is that right the prophet of God said
[2:09:27] it like this we were Sinners we were
[2:09:30] failures to begin
[2:09:32] with if there is any success in your
[2:09:34] life it's only because Jesus Christ has
[2:09:36] given it to
[2:09:37] you you love the Lord I said I wasn't
[2:09:41] going to keep you long and I know I have
[2:09:44] kept you long so I'm going to say I'm

[2:10:08] grateful because I never
[2:10:11] understood many things about the grace
[2:10:14] of
[2:10:15] God I thought that if a man
[2:10:19] would
[2:10:21] die in a way that looked
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:26] sinful that he was completely
[2:10:32] finished but that's not always
[2:10:36] true that's why the Bible said grieve
[2:10:38] not the Holy
[2:10:40] Ghost you were sealed to the day of
[2:10:44] your you have the Holy
[2:10:46] Ghost and still make
[2:10:49] mistakes now we're coming into this day
[2:10:53] where God is bringing us into a
[2:10:55] Perfection but the Perfection is is the
[2:10:58] inward man not the flly man the fleshly
[2:11:02] man always make
[2:11:06] mistakes it's like biting your tongue I
[2:11:10] think us intentionally bite our
[2:11:14] tongue because it's
[2:11:17] theh
[2:11:20] Rhythm and it
[2:11:23] hurts but you see we realize one
[2:11:26] thing that if this Earthly Tabernacle be
