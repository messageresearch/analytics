[0:57] name we pray amen you may turn with us
[1:01] by God's grace
[1:03] to First John
[1:07] please we're going to start the second
[1:10] chapter beginning at the 13th verse 13
[1:14] we'll try to work our way down to the
[1:16] 24th
[1:19] verse we have been dealing with love
[1:21] loving your brother love is
[1:24] God uh we know what the prophet God said
[1:27] that only Divine love is going to make
[1:30] get we must believe that by the grace of
[1:32] God uh we must receive that and if we
[1:35] receive that we will be as Paul we press
[1:39] toward the mark of a high calling in
[1:41] Christ
[1:42] Jesus first John 2
[1:45] chapter we'll start reading at the 13th
[1:49] verse I write unto you fathers because
[1:53] you have known him that is from the
[1:55] beginning I write unto you you young men
[1:59] because you have overcome the wicked one
[2:03] I write unto you little children because
[2:05] you have known the
[2:08] father I have written unto you fathers
[2:11] because you have known him that is from
[2:13] the
[2:14] beginning I have written unto you young
[2:17] men because ye are strong and the word
[2:20] of God abideth in you and you have
[2:23] overcome the wicked one 15th verse love
[2:27] not the world neither the things that
[2:30] are in the world if any man love the
[2:33] world the love of the
[2:35] father is not in
[2:38] him let us pray once again father we
[2:40] thank you once again for your holy word
[2:43] anoint us tonight give us what we stand
[2:45] in need of we'll be careful to give you
[2:48] the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus
[2:50] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[2:54] seated um tonight I would just like to
[2:57] uh speak on this journey the two spirits
[3:00] in the church we are uh dealing with
[3:05] what what John John talks about the
[3:08] Antichrist and the Antichrist Spirit
[3:09] already being in the church and we know
[3:12] that the Antichrist anti means to be
[3:15] against um God and and by God's grace we
[3:19] trust that somehow we'll be able to
[3:21] bring this lesson out it is good to know
[3:24] God because this is what John is talking
[3:27] to the fathers to the young people to
[3:29] the young men if you would want to say
[3:32] it like that he's basically addressing
[3:33] the whole church because it's important
[3:36] to know God it's not enough to say well
[3:38] I know him and yet you don't know him um
[3:42] and when we say that we're working with
[3:44] not just a letter of the word we we're
[3:47] talking about the spirit word the
[3:49] quickening word that revelated word uh
[3:52] that we must know him by uh because many
[3:56] many in the days of old couldn't read
[3:58] nor write but they knew the spirit they
[4:02] knew God and you must understand that by
[4:04] the grace of God during the time of the
[4:08] uh New Testament Church uh they didn't
[4:10] have a Bible as we have they of course
[4:14] had the the Scrolls uh that the Jews
[4:18] would read and things like that but when
[4:20] it came to the New Testament Church uh
[4:23] these the church itself uh was um fresh
[4:29] new
[4:30] uh but one of the things that they did
[4:33] have and that was the Holy Ghost and the
[4:36] Bible said the Holy Ghost will lead you
[4:39] and guide you into all
[4:43] truth when I think
[4:46] about fathers you've known him because
[4:49] you have known him you're talking about
[4:51] an experienced person that have uh had
[4:56] uh not only just the Revelation but
[4:58] they've gone through trial they've gone
[5:00] through Temptations they've gone through
[5:02] a lot of things and they have overcome
[5:05] the wicked one and even John basically
[5:08] he's actually encouraging the young
[5:11] people because they've overcome and when
[5:13] you say overcome you're talking about
[5:15] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[5:16] eye and the pride of life God has
[5:18] delivered you and so you know the wicked
[5:21] one and you know what he's like turn
[5:24] with me to St John 14 St John 14
[5:30] we'll we'll read from there St John 148
[5:36] through2 you love the Lord amen
[5:42] amen St John
[5:49] 14 8 through
[5:56] 20 let's start um at the eth verse where
[6:00] Philip said unto him Lord show us the
[6:02] father and it suffices us I was talking
[6:06] to a friend of mine who is what we call
[6:09] a denominational Christian uh I believe
[6:12] he is a a Son of God he just doesn't
[6:15] know what we know but I believe as we
[6:18] work with him God will open his
[6:21] understanding you know as like when Paul
[6:24] when they saw the Disciples of John they
[6:27] expounded to them in more excellent way
[6:30] but do you know him um Jesus said unto
[6:33] him have I been so long with you and yet
[6:37] has thou not known me Phillip he that H
[6:40] have seen me have seen the father and
[6:43] how sayest thou then show us the father
[6:45] so you got to understand there's a lot
[6:47] of Christians who are in the position of
[6:50] Phillip they still don't know who the
[6:52] father is you see they have not come
[6:55] into that Revelation to know that Jesus
[6:58] Christ
[7:00] is the father amen even though he be he
[7:02] is the son only because he was created
[7:06] in the flesh amen but when it comes to
[7:09] his inner being it was God because St
[7:12] John 10:30 Jesus declared I and the
[7:16] father are one so Jesus said to them
[7:19] have you been with me I mean you've seen
[7:21] the Miracles you've seen the works that
[7:23] I've
[7:23] done you've seen it and you know no man
[7:26] can do these
[7:28] things and the 10th verse says believest
[7:30] Thou not that I am in the father and the
[7:32] father is in me the words that I speak
[7:35] unto you I speak not of myself but the
[7:38] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[7:41] work is't that a position to be in to
[7:44] know that every word you speak is coming
[7:47] from the unction of the Holy Spirit the
[7:49] power of God you have no words of your
[7:52] own everything that you say com is
[7:55] coming from the Throne of God what a
[7:58] powerful position to be in and I believe
[8:01] by the grace of God John is writing
[8:03] these things to us so that we can
[8:05] accomplish this so that we can come to
[8:07] that position where God can speak
[8:10] through us even as brother random said
[8:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the voice
[8:15] of God Amen for the final age this is
[8:19] the final age and Jesus Christ is
[8:22] supposed to be speaking through us but
[8:24] he can only speak through us if we're
[8:27] dead all right believe thou not that I
[8:30] am in the Father the father is in me the
[8:33] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[8:35] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[8:38] in me he doeth the speak The Works
[8:41] believe me that I am the I am in the
[8:43] father and the father is in me or else
[8:46] believe me for the very Works sake Jesus
[8:49] said well uh you know we know that only
[8:52] God can do the works that I've done and
[8:54] if you don't believe I'm here here take
[8:56] an inventory look at the things that I
[8:58] have done and then you'll be able to see
[9:01] the works that have been that have been
[9:02] done is done by the
[9:06] father is that right he says verily
[9:09] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[9:11] in on me the works that I do shall he do
[9:14] also so here Jesus himself is basically
[9:18] saying when you come to understand who
[9:20] the father is you have a revelation of
[9:23] him he said the very works that I do you
[9:26] have the same ability amen you will be
[9:29] able it'll be the father working through
[9:31] you right it'll be the father speaking
[9:34] through you right everything you do will
[9:38] be by and of the father I believe that
[9:41] the Bride of Jesus Christ is pressing
[9:43] into that position sir see because as
[9:47] long as Jesus was saying or doing
[9:51] Miracles uh you know they they didn't do
[9:53] much but when Jesus declared that I and
[9:57] the father are one that's right
[9:59] that's when he stirred the harness Nest
[10:03] that's when everything began to come
[10:06] after him because they said they wanted
[10:10] to kill him and Jesus said why why do
[10:12] you want to persecute me he said because
[10:15] they said unto him because thou being a
[10:17] man make yourself equal with God right
[10:22] and even Paul says it right he said
[10:25] don't don't you know uh don't don't this
[10:28] this is a mystery
[10:29] but he said uh you know uh God was
[10:32] manifested In the Flesh and think it not
[10:35] strange you know he he came down and he
[10:38] took on uh uh the Flesh of God and the
[10:42] Bible said he he saw himself as equal
[10:45] with God and I think that's where we we
[10:48] we fail because we as I said La last
[10:52] night you know or the other night we're
[10:55] so busy judging ourselves according to
[10:58] the outer man and the outer Man is
[11:02] dead God is not concerned about the
[11:04] outer man the outer man is growing old
[11:07] you know all of that but the inner man
[11:10] is the man that God is concerned about
[11:13] he's the one that is growing into the
[11:15] very image and likeness of God and when
[11:18] you can see the inner man you can see
[11:21] Perfection because you know God is
[11:23] perfecting the inner man this thing
[11:27] doesn't change until that time
[11:29] when this Mortal will put on
[11:32] immortality amen you love the Lord okay
[11:35] let's go back to the scripture
[11:38] here all of these things come by
[11:41] Revelation you can study all you want to
[11:44] this is why brother said in that day
[11:46] you'll understand how important
[11:48] Revelation is to the Bride of Jesus
[11:51] Christ you know I um was uh I have been
[11:56] thinking on how important it is for for
[11:59] us to come and accept everything God
[12:04] spoke to us through the prophet brother
[12:09] brandham amen uh uh some of the things
[12:12] that he has said or has been spoken in
[12:16] the natural mind you can't even
[12:18] comprehend it but by faith is how we
[12:23] receive what has been
[12:26] spoken sir is Faith and that faith will
[12:29] work that
[12:30] Revelation the more Revelation you have
[12:33] about who you are the Freer you are amen
[12:37] the stronger you are yes sir right you
[12:40] become as the prophet of God said you
[12:42] and I become an invincible Army amen
[12:45] because that's the way God declared us
[12:48] to be right that's knowing him that's
[12:52] knowing what you come uh uh for to do in
[12:56] this age our age is different from the
[12:59] se you and I must recognize that God is
[13:02] to much whom is given much is required
[13:06] am and I believe that right and he's
[13:09] telling them he's putting them basically
[13:11] in order I know you know this I know you
[13:13] this you the the wicked one you've
[13:16] overcome but then he drops down into the
[13:18] 15th verse he said love not the world
[13:22] why did he say that because if you love
[13:24] the world brother bradam as he described
[13:27] it he said the love of God is not in you
[13:30] amen even if there be a speck of the
[13:33] world world in you he said the love of
[13:37] God is not now that's a powerful
[13:44] statement very
[13:46] powerful listen coming from the
[13:49] message a thinking man's
[13:52] filter paragraph 114 just a little above
[13:55] it he said you can't say that bobbed
[14:00] hair for a woman is of God the Bible
[14:03] says it's not so it's the filth of the
[14:07] world and if you love one Speck of the
[14:10] world the love of God is not even in you
[14:15] what's that well what's drawing it is
[14:19] something down on the inside
[14:22] drawing the soul is drawing your
[14:25] resource through the outside down
[14:28] through through the spirit into the soul
[14:32] and if the soul loves the world it's
[14:35] dead I don't care how it is Anointed it
[14:39] is out here and how righteous it is out
[14:44] here down in here is dead for he that
[14:48] love the world or the things of the
[14:51] world the love of God is not even in him
[14:54] no matter how religious see what I'm
[14:58] saying so that's the
[15:00] deception of religion religion is is is
[15:04] can be so
[15:06] deceiving coming from the exposition of
[15:08] the seven Church ages brother B says
[15:11] Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the two
[15:16] vines that grow together and intertwine
[15:19] their branches are now to be
[15:22] separated the fruits of those Vines
[15:25] which were at such variance will be
[15:28] gathered GED into a separate Gardener
[15:31] the two Spirits would go to their
[15:34] separate destination and I I I I threw
[15:37] this in there because there's a spirit
[15:41] that love the world and there's a spirit
[15:44] that loves the word amen you understand
[15:47] me and the only difference in in those
[15:50] two words world and word is the letter L
[15:55] which represents lust amen that's right
[15:58] see
[16:00] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[16:01] eye and the pride of life is of the
[16:03] world Amen Hallelujah but when you free
[16:07] of lust of those things amen it is the
[16:11] word that you live by and not the world
[16:15] that you live by the two spirits will go
[16:18] to their separate destinations now it is
[16:21] time to heed the final call that comes
[16:25] only to the wheat bride come out of her
[16:29] my people that you be not partakers of
[16:32] her sins and that ye wheat receive not
[16:35] her tears plague the Great Tribulation
[16:40] of the six seal Matthew
[16:42] 24 so what is he saying he's saying now
[16:46] there are two churches one is of God one
[16:49] is not of God but John is writing to the
[16:51] children of God Little Children love not
[16:55] the world or the things that are in the
[16:57] world right discern the two right
[17:00] because there's one amen that's going to
[17:03] love the word and that that other spirit
[17:05] is going to love the world and you can't
[17:08] have two
[17:08] masters you can't love them both you got
[17:12] to you you got to make your choice right
[17:15] and that's that's the thing what we we
[17:17] may not see it but we we got to
[17:20] understand there are examples in the
[17:22] Bible that where people followed God but
[17:25] their their lives their hearts weren't
[17:28] in the place like for example aan and I
[17:32] I took this uh quote coming from the uh
[17:35] the the message um adoption number one
[17:39] 196
[17:41] 0515 and here brother brandham says in
[17:44] paragraph 56 and they slayed the
[17:48] amorites and the Hittites but there was
[17:51] one hurt
[17:54] among there excuse me but there wasn't
[17:56] one hurt among any of them until sin
[18:00] came in the camp amen and when aan took
[18:05] the Babylonian garment and that gold
[18:08] wedge and hid it under his Camp then the
[18:12] next day they lost 16 men Joshua said
[18:16] stop stop wait a minute there's
[18:20] something wrong something wrong here
[18:24] we're going to call seven days of fast
[18:27] God made us a promise there will be
[18:30] nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at
[18:33] our feet and there's something wrong
[18:36] here something went wrong somewhere
[18:39] cause we've got
[18:41] 16 dead men laying here and their
[18:44] Israelite brothers and they're dead now
[18:48] what what are you saying brother Brooks
[18:50] we we may not recognize it but I I if we
[18:54] break the chain if we if we as
[18:57] individuals let's put it this way as
[19:00] individuals uh you allow sin to come in
[19:03] and where I'm not talking about faults
[19:06] I'm talking about willful sins a can saw
[19:10] what he did and instead of confessing it
[19:13] he hid it hidden sin don't only just
[19:16] affect you but affects the bride of
[19:19] Christ amen listen what the prophet of
[19:21] God says why did they die innocent men
[19:24] because one man step out of line you see
[19:29] reasons that needs to be taught you see
[19:32] reason that needs to be
[19:34] taught the church lining up lining up
[19:37] with the word of God lining up with God
[19:40] lining up with each other walking
[19:43] perfectly upright and you've heard me
[19:45] say that many times because when you
[19:47] love the world the love of God is not in
[19:49] your heart there is no way that you can
[19:52] love me because the love of God is not
[19:55] there and most of the time you can't
[19:57] even love yourself because the love of
[19:59] God is not there you know even brother
[20:01] Brandon when it comes to Ezekiel he said
[20:04] God will give you a new
[20:05] spirit and many people take that new
[20:08] spirit as though it is the holy spirit
[20:10] but the new spirit is given to you not
[20:13] only to to so you can get along with
[20:15] yourself but also to get along with the
[20:18] word right so when God gives you that
[20:21] new spirit that ain't it you you you
[20:24] like I said last night speaking in tongu
[20:27] shouting and all those things those are
[20:29] just attributes of the Holy Ghost that's
[20:31] not the Holy Ghost acts 238 promis you
[20:36] the gift of the Holy Ghost a gift and
[20:39] many people take that gift as though
[20:41] it's the Holy
[20:43] Ghost you get the Holy Ghost and then
[20:46] you get a
[20:48] gift and the greatest gift that God can
[20:51] give you is himself amen see I know you
[20:56] know fathers you know children children
[20:58] you know young men you know you're
[21:01] strong right because you seen the way
[21:04] you can't fight Satan if you can't
[21:06] seeing that's right you got to see your
[21:09] enemy sir right that's the only way you
[21:11] can Warfare against him if you don't see
[21:14] him you think he's your
[21:15] buddy no you got to see the devil as the
[21:19] devil right oh my see he goes on and
[21:23] says listen the church lining up lining
[21:27] up with the word of God lining up with
[21:28] God and lining up with each other
[21:31] walking perfectly upright soberly before
[21:34] all men fearing God because one man
[21:37] stole a garment and done something that
[21:40] he should not have done took the life of
[21:42] 16 men I think it was 16 maybe more I
[21:46] believe it was 16 men that was dead
[21:49] Joshua called and said there's something
[21:52] wrong God made the promise and there's
[21:55] something wrong when he we bring the s
[21:58] up before us and they fail to be healed
[22:02] we need to call a solemn fast call an
[22:05] assembly something's wrong somewhere God
[22:08] made the promise God's got to stick to
[22:11] the promise and he will do it you
[22:14] understand me what causes the church to
[22:16] fail is men with hidden sin amen You
[22:21] Can't Hide and God will judge every did
[22:25] God judge aen or we get to that in a
[22:27] minute because a lot of time people
[22:29] think if I hide it I'm okay oh no you're
[22:33] causing death unto others amen and he
[22:36] called a fast and he found out they cast
[22:39] the lots and aan confessed it and they
[22:43] killed a can family and all and burned
[22:48] their ashes and left it therefore a
[22:51] memorial and Joshua went out right went
[22:55] right on through the battle a king
[22:58] taking everything without a scratch or a
[23:02] wound there you
[23:04] are you see how powerful the church
[23:06] could be if they loved one another
[23:10] amen if they had the love of God in
[23:13] their heart we would be
[23:16] invincible and when I say that I I'm not
[23:19] even talking about the multitude because
[23:21] every multitude got every church has
[23:24] three kinds of Believers but if we could
[23:26] get the Believers or one Accord a devil
[23:30] no devil would have a place to sit
[23:33] that's right right he said I write unto
[23:37] you the 13th verse I write unto you
[23:40] fathers because you have known him that
[23:42] is from the beginning and real
[23:45] experienced Christians mature Christians
[23:48] can see the devil a far
[23:50] off they have a discernment they have a
[23:53] discernment and they can see him right
[23:56] they know the enemy
[23:59] from God they know sometime people get a
[24:01] little confused but the longer you stay
[24:04] with God the more you recognize
[24:07] him right because you have the
[24:11] word Martin bowed down before me
[24:15] Martin Martin rebuked the devil why
[24:19] because he had a crown on his head amen
[24:22] that's right you're not Jesus because
[24:25] you are you you you you your your your
[24:27] your appearance
[24:29] is not according to the word because one
[24:31] day we're going to Crown
[24:33] Him and brother said those Pentecostal
[24:36] would have fallen for that but when you
[24:38] know the word amen Satan can dress
[24:41] himself up but you'll be able to discern
[24:44] you'll be able to see exactly who he is
[24:47] I love this I love this God is so good I
[24:51] write unto you little children because
[24:53] you have known the father I have written
[24:56] unto you fathers because you have known
[24:58] known him that is from the beginning woo
[25:00] that's a powerful thing you know even
[25:02] even uh uh uh Jude and the rest of them
[25:05] Luke and all of them you know we we've
[25:07] handled him can you
[25:10] imagine can you imagine and then Paul
[25:13] comes along and says we know we no
[25:14] longer know him after the flesh but now
[25:16] after the spirit which is more powerful
[25:19] that's right which is more powerful
[25:22] y'all y'all believe that because you
[25:23] know Jesus did get tired amen that was
[25:27] the Flesh of God
[25:29] but the man on the inside never
[25:31] weary I have written unto you fathers
[25:33] because you have known him that is from
[25:36] the beginning I have written unto you
[25:38] young men because you are strong and the
[25:41] word of God abideth in you and ye have
[25:44] overcome the wicked one you're strong
[25:47] why because the word of God abideth in
[25:52] you amen that's how come you're strong
[25:56] not on your own it is the word that
[25:59] abides in you right that makes you
[26:02] strong love not the world neither the
[26:05] things that are in the world if any man
[26:07] love the world the love of God of the
[26:10] father is not him uh in him for all that
[26:13] is in the world the lust of the flesh
[26:15] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[26:19] is not of the father but is of the world
[26:24] and so therefore if we're fighting and
[26:26] struggling with those things what we
[26:29] need to do is ask God to just what let
[26:32] us die kill us I'm talking about
[26:34] spiritually now we're not talking about
[26:35] some kind of suicidal thing but I'm
[26:37] saying ask God to kill us kill this
[26:41] flesh kill these worldly desires you say
[26:44] well what what do you mean the darkness
[26:45] that's hiding in you because you know
[26:48] James said when we're drawn away we're
[26:51] drawn away with our own lust and entice
[26:54] right that's what's in you and and the
[26:56] Holy Spirit is is the only one who could
[26:59] burn all that out of you get rid of it
[27:03] right that doesn't mean you won't have a
[27:05] fight here but the inner man will be
[27:07] stronger than
[27:09] this
[27:11] Hallelujah the world passes away and the
[27:14] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[27:17] of God abideth forever think about that
[27:21] what an encouraging letter little
[27:23] children it is the last times and as you
[27:27] have heard
[27:28] that the Antichrist shall come even now
[27:31] are there many Antichrist whereby we
[27:35] know that it is the last time so what
[27:38] are you saying Antichrist is the kind of
[27:41] person is the kind of spirit that'll
[27:43] keep you from rejoicing that'll keep you
[27:45] from praising God that'll keep you from
[27:48] living right that'll make you
[27:50] starchy that's
[27:53] Antichrist God there's nothing starchy
[27:55] about God God is full of life
[27:59] he's not a statue he's a living being
[28:02] Hallelujah and and we must be that way
[28:06] the way when we find you you got to
[28:09] understand he said you're either hot or
[28:11] cold that's right when you see a fire a
[28:14] fire dances amen a fire move it it it
[28:19] doesn't stay in the same place you could
[28:21] see it just moving around fire
[28:26] lives but when you allow yourself to
[28:28] cool off or to become lukewarm that's a
[28:33] condition where you have been you have
[28:36] been
[28:38] influenced by the spirit of the
[28:42] Antichrist and they went out from
[28:46] us but they were not of us for if they
[28:50] had been us for been of us they would no
[28:53] doubt have continued with us but they
[28:57] went out that they might be made
[28:59] manifest that they were not of us so
[29:02] when people fall away it's be from the
[29:05] word without a real cause and I can
[29:08] truly say that there is no
[29:11] cause great enough to leave God Amen
[29:15] that's right
[29:17] nothing and when you see that everything
[29:20] is given to you by Grace you going to
[29:23] leave
[29:25] that your deliverance your healing
[29:28] your joy everything you receive from God
[29:31] is because he gives it to you because he
[29:34] loves you and it's not because you got
[29:36] to work for it it's all Grace yet people
[29:40] want to leave him and they fail to see
[29:42] that even when they leave him he still
[29:44] takes care of them amen that's
[29:48] right yeah I I don't get
[29:51] it I just don't get it because a lot of
[29:55] people don't understand that every Every
[29:57] Breath You Take that was God every move
[30:00] you make that's God every thought you
[30:03] think that's God God operates everything
[30:07] he's in
[30:08] control why not serve him I've been
[30:11] thinking about this
[30:13] thing more now than ever am and I think
[30:17] about what is worth like like I preach
[30:20] what your soul what is your soul worth
[30:23] brother B say this you know your soul is
[30:25] worth 10,000 worlds whatever that might
[30:28] be or may be and I think to myself my
[30:32] soul is the most important thing to
[30:36] me than
[30:38] anything you understand me because this
[30:42] this boy has only one chance at it
[30:45] that's
[30:46] right and I just don't love anything
[30:49] more than I love my soul now I'm not
[30:53] talking about God I'm talking about my
[30:55] soul because God is number one
[30:59] but I want my soul to recognize that God
[31:03] is number one amen that's right my soul
[31:06] need to know that my God God is the one
[31:09] who created this thing amen my soul need
[31:13] to worship him my soul need to live for
[31:16] him amen my soul need to do everything
[31:19] he says do yes sir cuz he's worthy of it
[31:22] right then you when you know him ah my
[31:26] God as I said there's no way to get
[31:30] There's No Escape how you going to
[31:33] escape it's best to be on the Lord's
[31:37] Side that okay coming from the message
[31:41] exposition of the
[31:43] church but what do we have in this hour
[31:46] this our hour our day multitudes are
[31:50] working signs until we have a generation
[31:53] of sign Seekers that know little or
[31:55] nothing about the word or of a true move
[31:58] of the spirit of God if they see blood
[32:01] or of fire they are happy it matters not
[32:05] what is in the word they will support
[32:08] any sign even scriptural ones even
[32:11] unscriptural ones but God has warned us
[32:14] about that he said in Matthew 24 that in
[32:18] the last days the two spirits will be so
[32:20] close together that only the very elect
[32:23] could tear them apart for they alone
[32:26] will not be deceived amen we're not
[32:29] deceived with the pleasures of the world
[32:32] we understand that this the suffering of
[32:34] this world cannot be compared to the
[32:36] glory that God has in store for us we're
[32:40] not deceived we know him amen we know
[32:45] him and I'm going to tell you something
[32:47] the greater part is he knows
[32:49] us hallelujah how can you tell the
[32:52] spirits apart just give them the word
[32:55] test if they don't speak the word they
[32:59] are of the evil
[33:01] one as the evil as the evil one deceived
[33:05] the first two Brides They will try to
[33:07] deceive the Bride of this last day by
[33:10] trying to get her to hbr herself through
[33:14] Creeds or just plainly turn from the
[33:17] word to any sign that suits her God
[33:22] never said believe the sign God said
[33:24] believe the word amen but God never
[33:27] placed signs ahead of the word signs
[33:30] follow the word as when Elijah took the
[33:33] woman told the woman to bake a cake for
[33:36] him first according to the word of the
[33:39] Lord and when she did as the word said
[33:41] the prophesying came come to the word
[33:44] first and then watch the miracle the
[33:47] seed word energizes energized by the
[33:52] spirit you say oh what do you mean
[33:54] brother Brooks because I'm going tell
[33:55] you something when this final op pouring
[33:58] of the Holy Spirit Falls is falling on
[34:03] everybody y'all understand what I mean I
[34:06] mean the weed and The Tear amen and The
[34:08] Tear is going to think that they are on
[34:10] in a Revival that's right and can't you
[34:12] see this thing Moun up now that's right
[34:14] it's mounting up now you're going to
[34:17] either believe the message or you don't
[34:18] believe the message but we know where
[34:20] the Antichrist system is amen right if
[34:25] it's Antichrist so how can how can can
[34:28] this Antichrist system be a a a
[34:30] Christian system when it's against
[34:34] Christ amen one of these old days the
[34:37] people going to find out who they are
[34:39] worshiping that's the word from the
[34:41] prophet that's right right because the
[34:43] only way you can worship God is that you
[34:46] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[34:49] everything else is Antichrist if you
[34:53] whether you want to believe it or not
[34:54] that's it this is why God sent us a
[34:57] message that we might know the truth and
[35:00] the truth will set us
[35:02] free make us free
[35:04] rather right according to the 20th verse
[35:07] of that same chapter but ye have an
[35:10] unction from the Holy One and you know
[35:13] all
[35:14] things right so what is he saying listen
[35:17] let me tell you something this message
[35:20] has placed us in a position to know all
[35:23] things amen that's right we know what's
[35:26] coming amen we know the Antichrist
[35:28] Spirit we know the system we know what
[35:30] the mark of the beast is we know what
[35:32] the Holy Ghost is we know it's not the
[35:34] third person it's the person it is God
[35:37] himself we know it's not a feeling or
[35:39] speaking in tongues it's a lifechanging
[35:42] experience that brings you into the
[35:45] glory of God by glory glory glory glory
[35:50] amen literally maturing you into the
[35:54] very image and likeness of God that's
[35:56] him
[35:58] right that unction that makes you thirst
[36:01] for more God
[36:04] Amen that's God that's not the devil the
[36:08] devil won't make you thirst for
[36:10] God that's god making you thirst for him
[36:14] and if there's a deep call there's a
[36:15] deep to
[36:17] respond right he said I have not written
[36:20] unto you because you know not the truth
[36:23] you know the
[36:25] truth but because you know it and that
[36:29] no lie is of the
[36:31] truth so who can who can deceive you
[36:35] when you know the
[36:37] truth the word of our our day has given
[36:40] us the truth what doct doctrate of
[36:44] divinity whoever it may be can deceive
[36:47] you amen and you don't even have a ldd
[36:51] or Masters or whatever you're simple
[36:55] amen but you know God amen it's almost
[36:59] like the woman you know when at the well
[37:01] said we know when the Messiah comes he's
[37:04] going to tell us these things well you
[37:05] know even the Pharisees and the
[37:07] Sadducees of that day didn't know the
[37:09] truth like she did amen what was that it
[37:12] was given to her by
[37:14] Revelation and Upon This Rock I'll build
[37:17] my church and the Gates of Hell shall
[37:19] not Prevail against it you know the
[37:22] truth John says and I love this thing
[37:25] because it's an unction it's something
[37:27] God giv gives you you can't even explain
[37:29] it but you know
[37:31] it who is a liar but he that denieth
[37:34] that Jesus is the Christ that's
[37:37] right he is Antichrist that denieth the
[37:41] father and the son woo when you denied
[37:45] that Jesus is the Christ he said you're
[37:47] denying the father and the
[37:49] son and whosoever Deni the son the same
[37:53] have not the
[37:55] father why can't these Trinity and see
[37:58] this but he that acknowledge the son
[38:01] haveth the father
[38:03] also why cuz Jesus said it in in St John
[38:06] 10:30 I and my father are one they can't
[38:10] figure out that Oneness they think it's
[38:12] like this but it's greater than your
[38:15] finger is that right amen you're
[38:17] striving to be what one with God now
[38:21] remember this Christ is the trueu now
[38:25] remember this this is a new quote Christ
[38:28] in the true church is a continuation of
[38:32] the book of Acts and like I was telling
[38:35] people people thought that the book of
[38:36] Acts
[38:37] stopped hundreds of years ago but even
[38:41] during the time of of persecution that
[38:44] was the book of Acts because no man
[38:47] could have done those things what man
[38:49] you know is going to want run to the
[38:51] face to face a lion that's right what
[38:54] mother or whoever is going to let you
[38:57] just take them and burn them at the
[38:58] stake without a
[39:00] fight that was
[39:02] God knowing god because you if you don't
[39:05] know God you that can't be done that's
[39:08] right fear overtakes you wonderment
[39:12] wonder what's going to happen to me when
[39:13] I die but when you're certain of God and
[39:17] you know him by spirit and by letter
[39:22] amen you become an invincible Army amen
[39:30] it still balls down back to
[39:32] love you got to love God with all of
[39:35] your heart with all your mind with all
[39:37] of your
[39:38] soul but the Book of Revelation shows
[39:40] how that this Antichrist spirit will
[39:42] come into the church and defile it
[39:46] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[39:50] huh the Antichrist Spirit comes to make
[39:54] it
[39:55] lukewarm form more and Powerless why do
[39:59] you think the preachers preach so hard
[40:01] against it in this
[40:04] church because we recognize the spirit
[40:07] that got people formal the people that
[40:10] got people starchy that's not Christ
[40:13] that's Antichrist
[40:16] amen it exposes Satan revealing his
[40:20] Works attempted destructions of God
[40:23] people and the discrediting of God's
[40:26] word right right down to the time he is
[40:29] cast into the Lake of Fire he fights
[40:32] that he cannot stand it he knows that if
[40:36] the people get the true revelation of
[40:38] the true church and what she is what she
[40:42] stands for and that she can do the
[40:45] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[40:48] Army if they get a true Revelation see
[40:51] he keeps saying true Revelation not some
[40:55] partial uh uh uh uh How could a hrid
[40:58] revelation of God of who you are a true
[41:02] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[41:04] frame workor see because a lot of time
[41:07] Christians those who are true Christians
[41:09] they become they get intimidated by
[41:12] these uh spirits of antichrist when
[41:16] people amen you're rejoicing you having
[41:18] a a great time in God and and the anti
[41:21] Spirit Tri spirit is looking at at you
[41:24] like you in insane amen that's right and
[41:27] that happens in our own
[41:29] church you can't even Rejoice without
[41:33] somebody trying to discern whether that
[41:35] be of God well I know when you don't
[41:38] Rejoice am that's not of God that's
[41:40] right I got enough experience with that
[41:44] enough discernment of that you say well
[41:47] I'm not emotional you're a
[41:49] liar all men are
[41:52] emotional sometime we just lock down in
[41:55] our own little selves but everybody cry
[41:58] everybody
[41:59] laughs when you get happy you smile so
[42:03] what do you mean you're not emotional
[42:05] you just won't re you don't Release
[42:07] Yourself to the holy spirit for the joy
[42:09] that you could receive and wonder why we
[42:12] do
[42:14] that people say well I can't do it
[42:16] that's not true it can be
[42:21] done when I was in the world I didn't I
[42:23] didn't I I I had a desire to dance when
[42:26] I wanted to dance I danc then after I
[42:29] dance I start feeling good come
[42:31] on that's right people people you know
[42:36] I'm not saying everybody got to dance
[42:37] everybody got shouted but
[42:40] emotionally but how can you how can you
[42:42] have it you got to have it somewhere lot
[42:45] of times we're locked into ourselves
[42:47] maybe because of past experiences I
[42:49] don't know but God wants that how can
[42:52] God says you it's a joy it's a the Holy
[42:55] Ghost is a joy overflow it's a it's a
[42:58] well of water springing up you know and
[43:00] that means you have no control of it it
[43:03] comes
[43:04] out but we can't allow ourselves to be
[43:07] locked down because a spirit fears what
[43:11] people going to say I've seen people are
[43:14] afraid of the holy spirit because they
[43:16] were afraid to get out of control God is
[43:18] saying that's what I want I want you out
[43:20] of control I want to be in control of
[43:23] you she will be an invincible Army if
[43:26] they they get a true
[43:28] Revelation
[43:30] see she can do the Greater Works she
[43:33] will be an invincible Army if they get a
[43:35] true revelation of the two Spirits
[43:38] within the framework of the Christian
[43:40] church and by God's spirit discern and
[43:43] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[43:48] will be powerless before her he will be
[43:51] as de definitely toward it today as when
[43:55] Christ withstood his very every
[43:57] effort to gain power over him in the
[43:59] desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we
[44:03] love it with true Revelation in our
[44:06] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[44:09] against us but we will prevail over them
[44:12] let me say it like this even if you
[44:14] don't feel oh I don't you know what a
[44:16] sacrifice of praise is is when you give
[44:19] it and you don't feel it you don't feel
[44:21] like it but you Hallelujah
[44:24] anyway something causes you to praise
[44:26] God God I was listening to something to
[44:30] and I remember back in the
[44:32] day you know there were when when when
[44:34] the Pentecostal Church in America many
[44:37] of the preachers didn't know how to read
[44:38] so they had their wives or someone else
[44:41] read the scripture you know brother
[44:42] brandham used to have his wife read the
[44:44] scripture and he said read and she' read
[44:47] it and he'll preach and he get they call
[44:49] it preach and praise because while he's
[44:52] preaching he praised God glory to God
[44:55] something happens to him while he's
[44:57] preaching he catched the revelation of
[44:59] the scripture and then he praised God in
[45:02] between it's been a long time since
[45:04] we've seen that but
[45:06] nevertheless that's the way it used to
[45:08] be and people used to be so spiritual
[45:11] during that time they can tell when the
[45:13] devil enters into the church oh oh see
[45:17] we don't know but we we see what what
[45:19] they call Pentecostal now that ain't it
[45:23] all that shouting and carrying on people
[45:25] were far more serious-minded back
[45:27] then when the Holy Ghost moved he
[45:30] moved right even so in this message
[45:33] that's the way it
[45:34] was right let me move on Satan hates
[45:37] Revelation but we love it with true
[45:40] Revelation in our lives the gates of
[45:42] hell can not Prevail against us but we
[45:44] will prevail against uh Prevail over
[45:47] them you know why I'm saying this all of
[45:48] this can only be done when you know him
[45:51] you got to know him you will recall that
[45:53] I mentioned at the beginning of this
[45:55] message that the book this book we are
[45:58] studying is the actual revelation of
[46:00] Jesus himself in the church and his
[46:02] works in the future ages then I
[46:05] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[46:07] to give up Revelation or we will fail to
[46:10] get it bringing things two thoughts
[46:12] together you will see that it won't take
[46:15] just ordinary study and thinking to make
[46:18] this book real it is good it is going to
[46:22] take the operation of the Holy Ghost
[46:25] that means this book can't be revealed
[46:28] to anyone but a special class of people
[46:31] it will take one with prophetic Insight
[46:35] it will require the ability to hear from
[46:37] God it will require Supernatural
[46:40] instructions not just a student
[46:42] comparing verses with verses though that
[46:45] is good but a mystery required the
[46:48] teaching of the spirit or it'll never
[46:51] become clear how we need to hear from
[46:54] God and lay ourselves open
[46:57] and become yielded to the spirit to hear
[47:01] and to
[47:02] know and how you come to do that you
[47:05] come to do that through prayer amen
[47:08] prayer you got to pray whether you feel
[47:12] it or not that's what you need to do now
[47:15] certainly everything that God has Satan
[47:18] has something to counterfeit it see he
[47:21] makes something off of it and Jesus did
[47:25] preceed their thoughts so therefore the
[47:28] great
[47:29] Orthodox of those days said that guy is
[47:32] the best fortune teller in the country
[47:35] he's bebov the prince of the devil is
[47:37] that right now that's what the preacher
[47:40] said and the great teachers of that day
[47:44] said he's be elbel now let me let's see
[47:48] what the devil said the devil said he's
[47:51] a Son of God you know who you are the
[47:54] Holy One Of God is that right right and
[47:58] that case the devil had more knowledge
[48:00] of God than the ministry
[48:03] did and it's still the
[48:06] same here God has sent a message in this
[48:09] day and 90% of the Ministers of the
[48:12] world maybe more than that call this
[48:14] message the
[48:16] devil and all this message is the truth
[48:20] amen but that's the difference between
[48:23] the two you can say this message is of
[48:26] God you are of
[48:29] God hallelujah and here's what the
[48:32] preacher says they're Impostors they
[48:35] turned the world upside down they're no
[48:38] good there was the ministry saying
[48:40] they're Impostors and the devil saying
[48:43] these men of God which was right see the
[48:47] devil was right is that right sure he
[48:49] was so you see even uh them people so
[48:53] that was from I am the resurrection so
[48:55] when we look at these things we must
[48:58] understand by the grace of
[48:59] God that when when this
[49:02] whole
[49:04] entire how can I say it coming to know
[49:08] God and coming to know how can I say it
[49:12] in order to know God you must be willing
[49:15] to
[49:17] die because Jesus said take up your
[49:19] cross and follow
[49:21] me and the only way you can uh follow
[49:25] Jesus you you must die
[49:29] amen that that that's it you must die
[49:33] you must die to
[49:35] yourself right you must die to
[49:39] yourself and when we see that we can die
[49:42] to ourselves God can then come in and
[49:47] really give us what we stand in need
[49:49] of
[49:53] ah and he says listen you out of
[49:57] yourself you R you you do away with the
[49:59] things of the world the 25th verse says
[50:02] and this is the promise that he have
[50:03] promised us even eternal
[50:07] life
[50:09] hallu is it worth
[50:12] it it's worth
[50:15] it let me ask you a
[50:19] question how many of y'all know you're
[50:23] alive how you know it how do you know
[50:27] you're alive you could be
[50:31] dead you know why cuz everything about
[50:34] you signifies that you're
[50:37] alive when somebody is dead he can't
[50:40] move he can't talk he can't worship
[50:43] nothing he can't do nothing nothing he
[50:46] can't say hallelujah he can't say praise
[50:49] the Lord he can't say thank you Jesus
[50:52] he's
[50:53] dead but when somebody is alive
[50:57] he can speak he can worship he can give
[51:01] God praise he can give God
[51:04] glory right and he knows it's not coming
[51:07] from his head but his
[51:10] heart let's
[51:20] stand are we
[51:23] grateful that the anointing of God
[51:25] abides in
[51:29] and I'm going to say this to you once
[51:33] again the Bible said you can do all
[51:35] things through Christ who strengthens
[51:41] you brother Adam talks about
[51:44] it but I said if a man want to
[51:48] dance woman whoever it may
[51:50] be God will give that to
[51:55] you I put it this way if you ever danced
[51:58] in the world you can dance in
[52:00] Jesus the gift is already
[52:04] there
[52:05] singing it's
[52:08] there but you got to use it die and move
[52:12] that thing to the right side you know
[52:14] when you dance for the the devil is on
[52:16] the left move it over to the
[52:19] right we were at basketball games
[52:22] football game oh we
[52:25] shouted that's on the left side move
[52:28] that Cher to the
[52:32] right huh amen you think about you say
[52:36] what a minute Jes the Pentecostal Church
[52:39] hadn't even started but when Jesus rode
[52:41] into Jerusalem those people went woo
[52:44] they were breaking down the people Lawns
[52:47] and tearing up their trees breaking and
[52:51] palm trees and waving them hosana hosana
[52:55] I mean it must have been a mess
[52:57] amen blessed is he that comes in the
[52:59] name of the
[53:00] Lord there was that was what even that
[53:03] that Humanity something about that
[53:06] knowing who that he was amen inspired
[53:10] them to
[53:11] worship knowing who he is it will
[53:13] inspire
[53:17] you
[53:19] justification
[53:21] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:24] and the Seal of God all these things are
[53:27] steps and levels of God in you but you
[53:31] don't
[53:32] stop you go for go for what you want
[53:35] Lord this is what I want it's almost
[53:37] like Esther when she wanted something
[53:39] from the King she just didn't sit at the
[53:41] house she said no no no no i' this is
[53:44] urgent this is urgent if I perish let me
[53:47] perish I'm going to see the king and
[53:49] that's what we need an urgency in Us in
[53:53] order to make us move forward
[53:57] but remember the Antichrist spirit is
[53:59] everything against God and often times
[54:03] we all allowed allow it to anoint us is
[54:07] that right whether we want to realize it
[54:10] or not it's
[54:11] true you know you know we you I don't
[54:14] feel like praising the Lord today who
[54:16] did tell who when the Angels before God
[54:19] can't stop and and we come to church I
[54:22] don't feel like
[54:23] it is that Christ or anti
[54:27] okay that's all I'm saying cuz the devil
[54:30] don't want you to praise the Lord but he
[54:32] don't mind you praising
[54:36] him let's pray father God we come before
[54:40] you Lord we thank you for your grace and
[54:41] your mercy we thank you for all that
[54:44] you've done for us Lord just we don't
[54:46] want to be like a can we don't want a
[54:49] pull from the world to remain if there
[54:53] wherever the darkness is we pray Lord
[54:55] that you
[54:57] Deliver Us from it Lord we want our
[54:59] Temple to be holy
[55:02] Sanctified Fire full of the Holy Spirit

[55:14] minds let our souls be pure before you
[55:18] Lord father we can't do it you're the
[55:20] maker you're the master builder you're
[55:23] the Potter we're the clay but father we
[55:25] desire desire to be perfect we desire to
[55:30] be in your image in your likeness we

[55:40] whatever that may be in our lives that
[55:43] may be clogging up the flu hindering us
[55:47] from worshiping the way we so
[55:50] desire or praising you the way we so
[55:54] desire we pray father God that to
[55:56] cleanse us of these things let the fire
