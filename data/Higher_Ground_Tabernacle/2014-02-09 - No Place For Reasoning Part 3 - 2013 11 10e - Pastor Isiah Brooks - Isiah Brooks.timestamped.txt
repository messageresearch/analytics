[0:00] you love the
[0:02] Lord amen so I want you to know by the
[0:05] grace of God we're we're here and we're
[0:08] working with this
[0:10] thought and all I could get into was one
[0:13] in a million right one in a million oh
[0:17] let me say it like this because let me I
[0:20] know the thought that the Shina of Glory
[0:22] is in your heart don't get me wrong the
[0:23] temple is in your heart but I doubt if
[0:25] so many of us look toward that
[0:28] Temple okay but anyway let me let me let
[0:31] me let me go here and I want you to
[0:33] understand by the grace of God that
[0:36] we're living in a Time amen where the
[0:39] word of God is our
[0:42] lamp and our
[0:44] light and as we said this morning is
[0:48] because one word was
[0:50] broken and that is the reason why we are
[0:53] in the mess that we are in now in the
[0:57] Book of Revelation it talks about adding
[1:00] and taken
[1:01] away and we realize by the grace of God
[1:05] that because of
[1:07] unbelief the Palmer worm the cankerworm
[1:10] the Locust and the caterpillar came and
[1:12] ate away from the tree brother Brandon
[1:15] call it the restoration of the brid
[1:19] tree so you got to understanding in this
[1:22] day it is a
[1:24] restoration amen a restoration of the
[1:28] Bride tree so if if it's a restoration
[1:32] bringing back bringing it back to its
[1:34] original state and form somewhere it
[1:37] lost it all right now we realize by the
[1:41] grace of God that the uh Pentecostal
[1:44] Church are are move uh on Azu Street
[1:48] they thought that that was
[1:50] it brother brandham talk about how the
[1:53] the gifts was restored and all of these
[1:56] things were restored he said and they
[1:58] really thought that that was it
[2:00] but we came to find out that it was not
[2:03] it why because they organized they made
[2:07] it an organization and brother brandom
[2:09] said as soon as they did that
[2:12] amen God moved on now we realize amen
[2:17] that they got a last call and we talk
[2:19] about the last call and that's what I
[2:21] really believe that we're into right now
[2:23] amen let me say it like this I'd rather
[2:26] be corrected I'd rather be wrong and
[2:28] find out I'm wrong and make it right
[2:30] didn't think I'm right and find out I'm
[2:33] wrong it's not about me it's not about
[2:36] you it's about God and what God is
[2:39] expecting out of us you know we don't
[2:42] have if you're dead you don't have
[2:44] personal feelings and you know I find
[2:46] out that I need to die some
[2:49] more hello
[2:51] somebody sometimes things come up and
[2:53] you realize you're not as dead as you
[2:55] thought you was and you know it's a
[2:57] dying daily that we must all do because
[3:01] we want our we we don't have an agenda I
[3:04] don't have an agenda my whole entire
[3:07] thing is about God seeing God here
[3:10] seeing God manifest himself more in us
[3:14] you know it's it's it's about
[3:15] manifesting God in us amen and so when
[3:18] we look at this thing we realize by the
[3:21] grace of God and I told you this morning
[3:23] if anybody has done uh uh been repenting
[3:26] lately it's been me constantly repenting
[3:30] of thoughts ideas decisions things that
[3:34] I have made and done that wasn't
[3:36] completely lined up with the word of God
[3:38] but was full of my own
[3:42] reasoning help me
[3:54] God anyway uh the word of God tells us
[3:59] that that we must be careful according
[4:03] to Ephesians 5:6 let no man deceive you
[4:06] with vain
[4:08] words for because of these things cometh
[4:11] the wrath of God upon the children of
[4:16] Disobedience now we realize amen now if
[4:19] he says let no man deceive you with vain
[4:21] words anything that takes you away from
[4:24] the program of God what does God come to
[4:26] do redeem us right now remember Paul
[4:30] says listen the work was already
[4:33] finished before the foundation of the
[4:35] world if it was finished before the
[4:37] foundation of the world nothing can be
[4:39] added to it nothing can be taken from it
[4:41] brother Bram said it like this he said
[4:43] not one will one more will be added to
[4:47] the number that God has already redeemed
[4:49] amen there is not an addition to the
[4:51] bride she is by
[4:54] number as God thought it from the
[4:58] beginning
[5:01] right so we realize by the grace of
[5:04] God that if we are bride we will be
[5:09] anointed remember last week I showed you
[5:11] when they got ready to build the temple
[5:14] or the wall to Jerusalem there were
[5:16] certain men that were
[5:18] anointed that's
[5:20] right you you can't do this without
[5:22] being anointed that don't mean you
[5:25] jumping and skipping around speaking in
[5:26] tongues and all of that it means that
[5:28] there is an desire something that's
[5:32] drawing you and pulling you to do the
[5:35] perfect will of God you can't even
[5:38] control it because it is the anointing
[5:40] that God has ordained to fall on you in
[5:43] this
[5:45] hour now my thing is this if your mind
[5:48] is everywhere else as I say there
[5:51] everybody in this place is fulfilling
[5:55] the scripture one way or the
[5:58] other
[6:01] there's no there's no D there's no you
[6:04] know we know who Babylon is we know who
[6:07] the organizations are we know amen who
[6:10] the foolish versions are what they would
[6:12] consist of not that they weren't
[6:14] potentially the same the prophet of God
[6:17] said they were actually cut from the
[6:18] same material hallelujah amen so they
[6:22] had the ability they had the potential
[6:25] but they never came to it amen for
[6:29] whatever reason reason they weren't told
[6:31] or they were misled whatever the case be
[6:33] because understand this no matter how
[6:36] you will or wish it's all about
[6:39] election and God's election will
[6:43] determine your end that's why the Bible
[6:45] said God will give you an expected
[6:53] [Music]
[6:55] end oh Lord listen don't don't ever get
[6:59] it wrong folks I I appreciate your amens
[7:01] but let me say like this don't ever get
[7:03] don't ever get the veil mixed up with
[7:05] what's coming out of the
[7:08] mouth we look at these things and we
[7:13] understand by the grace of God the Bible
[7:15] says when Christ who is our life shall
[7:17] appear then shall ye also appear with
[7:21] him in glory now I showed you this
[7:23] morning amen that the grace of God has
[7:26] given God a face yes amen in this day
[7:30] hello somebody amen when Moses came up
[7:34] off the mountain and the glory of God
[7:36] was shown all about him his face was
[7:38] changed come on Amen they weren't
[7:40] looking at Moses they were looking at
[7:43] the god of Moses and yet the Bible says
[7:46] they saw Moses but failed to see the
[7:49] veil right they failed to see what the
[7:52] whole thing was about and it was not
[7:54] about Moses it was about God in Moses
[7:59] and to today the Bible said that same
[8:01] Veil is over their face but if they
[8:04] would ever turn to the Lord see it
[8:07] wasn't about William brandham it's about
[8:10] you and it's about the God of William
[8:13] brandham that you you can identify
[8:16] yourself
[8:17] with yes it took him to come but that's
[8:20] a kind of Glory That Glory that pill
[8:23] fire that followed him amen listen the
[8:26] prophet of God said it he said I'm
[8:28] waiting on him
[8:31] amen amen oh come on somebody hallu
[8:35] there were times brother Brandon
[8:37] preached he couldn't even remember what
[8:38] he preached because he wasn't the
[8:41] preacher it was God who was doing the
[8:44] preacher preaching and let me tell you
[8:46] something if you ever worship brother
[8:48] brandom you're
[8:50] lost it is surely
[8:57] idolatry y'all hear what I'm saying it's
[8:59] true
[9:00] idolatry but you use him to point to the
[9:04] main
[9:07] man come on somebody you wouldn't have
[9:09] never got on that Ark without Moses
[9:11] Noah Noah you wouldn't never got AR
[9:16] without Noah because he was the one God
[9:19] used now look at this when God in the
[9:22] ENT when God died oh let's put it away
[9:25] when Christ went into the region of the
[9:26] Lost he went and preached to those Souls
[9:29] that was in prison and guess what he
[9:31] said why did not you believe
[9:35] me amen huh why didn't you believe
[9:40] me they could have said we never did see
[9:43] you he would have probably said but when
[9:45] you saw Noah you saw
[9:48] me so is it in this day hallelujah amen
[9:53] that's why Jesus said when you see the
[9:55] father you see me so when the prophet of
[9:58] God came he was not the son of man he
[10:01] was a son of man revealing the son of
[10:04] man and so he could truly say when you
[10:07] saw me you saw the son of
[10:11] man y'all hear what I'm saying so put it
[10:15] this way God knows what he wrote in his
[10:18] book and listen I believe in the grace
[10:21] of God don't get me wrong because if it
[10:23] wasn't for the grace of God none of us
[10:25] would be
[10:28] here
[10:29] hello I can break this thing all the way
[10:31] down to you right I can tell you this
[10:35] that an illegitimate child amen would
[10:37] have been locked out of the presence of
[10:38] God for 400 years so how do you know
[10:41] where your parents and your great par
[10:43] grandparents all they had to do is mess
[10:45] up one
[10:49] time if that law was in effect amen
[10:52] right now that's why I thank God for a
[10:54] prophet because he comes around and he
[10:56] said but the blood of Jesus Christ
[10:57] cleanses you it doesn't matter how
[10:59] you're born the blood of Jesus take care
[11:02] of that he went on to say that every CH
[11:06] child that die every baby that dies go
[11:08] to heaven
[11:10] amen put it up on your quotes now my
[11:14] point is this because in America and you
[11:17] might want to put me out of the pull pit
[11:19] after I say this but you don't know what
[11:22] went on in my
[11:23] line and America hadn't even been here
[11:26] for for for 400 years
[11:37] oh I love it because I want you to
[11:39] understand people of God Amen that even
[11:42] in the prophet's life God gave
[11:47] Grace come on we can take it down to
[11:50] marriage and
[11:51] divorce hello
[11:54] sir we can take it all the way down
[11:56] there and he says listen but this only
[11:59] applies to those who follow my
[12:04] message oh Shouting Time in Heaven come
[12:07] on somebody I'm feeling pretty
[12:09] good you know because I want you to
[12:11] realize by the grace of God Amen that if
[12:15] not all of us would be in trouble that's
[12:18] right that's
[12:20] right Jesus didn't come to a holy
[12:23] generation he came to an adulterous
[12:27] generation that means AER was full of
[12:32] it y'all better thank God see y don't
[12:36] understand if God will pull back the
[12:38] blood off you you be in bad
[12:40] shape every one of us in
[12:44] here hallelujah come on somebody it's
[12:46] not but the truth now we look at this
[12:49] thing and we find out now if that be the
[12:52] case God is always having mercy and
[12:55] Grace upon his people that's why he said
[12:57] double Grace Grace Grace
[13:00] is The Headstone coming down crying
[13:02] Grace
[13:07] Grace y'all understand what I'm saying
[13:10] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[13:13] then shall ye also appear with him where
[13:17] in glory now when did he appear in
[13:20] 1963 lot of people don't don't believe
[13:23] in the cloud in the
[13:25] more they say it was a rocket or some
[13:27] strange scientific phenomen
[13:32] yeah may God have mercy on him well that
[13:35] strange scientific
[13:37] phenomenon had been prophesied by God
[13:40] for a long
[13:43] time that's all I'm telling
[13:46] you I don't care how he did it it was
[13:49] done but we know those that phenomenon
[13:52] was by seven
[13:54] angels come on they can't even prove
[13:57] that nonsense but my is the Bible talks
[14:00] about the face of
[14:02] Jesus right it was only in this day
[14:06] outside of 2,000 years ago he showed his
[14:11] face he showed it naturally amen when he
[14:14] was born of a virgin he showed it
[14:17] supernaturally when those seven angels
[14:19] formed that constellation
[14:22] amen oh come on
[14:25] somebody we didn't know who it what it
[14:27] was and what it was and
[14:29] the prophet of God was talking about it
[14:31] and then the holy spirit said turn it
[14:33] right turn it right what was it it was
[14:36] the hman head of
[14:40] Christ Oho come on somebody now remember
[14:43] I showed you it was the knowledge that
[14:46] would come to us in the face of Jesus
[14:50] Christ amen what was the knowledge that
[14:54] came to us in the face of Jesus Christ
[14:57] the world still don't know it it was the
[14:59] the opening of The Seven Seals amen
[15:02] amen come on somebody they don't even
[15:05] want to believe the faith so they'll
[15:06] never see the Seven
[15:08] Seals Hallelujah they never understood
[15:10] the seven Thunders come on somebody amen
[15:13] listen God is here right
[15:19] now and what is he doing he's building a
[15:23] bride he's shaping her and forming her
[15:26] into the very image woo come on somebody
[15:30] saving her and forming her into the very
[15:33] image Satan can't stop it the bride will
[15:37] always say yes and
[15:42] amen no
[15:45] matter religion religion religion has
[15:48] always sent people to
[15:56] Hell Isaiah 14:12
[15:59] religion has
[16:02] always you know it it's just it is what
[16:05] it
[16:09] is Isaiah
[16:18] 14 when we look at these things you say
[16:21] well brother
[16:22] Brooks you know what are we going to
[16:26] do you know I look at things and I I
[16:29] said Lord there's so many things I I I I
[16:32] I don't understand but I do
[16:34] believe and I just believe that the
[16:36] grace of God is with the bride of Jesus
[16:39] Christ in such a way amen we'll we'll
[16:42] we'll know when we get there but I'm
[16:45] going to read Isaiah
[16:47] 14 chapter 14 beginning at the 12th
[16:50] verse it says how art thou fallen from
[16:53] Heaven on Lucifer son of the morning how
[16:57] art thou cut down to the ground which
[17:01] did weaken the
[17:02] Nations for thou Hast said in thine
[17:04] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[17:07] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[17:11] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[17:13] congregation in the sides of the north I
[17:16] will Ascend above the heights of the
[17:18] cloud I will be like the most high and
[17:20] brother bradam said he did
[17:23] it he did it because right now they're
[17:27] worshiping Lucifer not even knowing it
[17:30] see the only way you can worship Him is
[17:33] in spirit and in truth if it's not
[17:37] spiritual and Truth is not right because
[17:41] both are the criterias of worshiping
[17:49] God you said oh brother that's how come
[17:52] Satan can imp he can become an
[17:55] impostor let tell you something your
[17:58] religion don't don't save you it's the
[18:00] election of God it's what God determined
[18:03] for you before the foundation of the
[18:06] world hello somebody oh come on somebody
[18:09] it's nothing but the truth I mean you
[18:12] look at God and God determined Saul to
[18:14] be foolish virgin right amen he messed
[18:17] up so much even he cut the the priest
[18:19] garment and everything else come on
[18:21] Samuel he toore His Garment and
[18:23] everything and Sam say because of this
[18:25] amen the kingdom is rent from you and
[18:27] yet he still had eternal life
[18:31] he died in battle he died in shame and
[18:35] he still had eternal
[18:40] life
[18:45] hello come on somebody somebody was
[18:47] saying the other day well Solomon can't
[18:49] be saved because he had a thousand wives
[18:51] he went into a Dollar Tree
[18:56] hello to your surprise Solomon will be
[19:01] there hello Solomon will be
[19:07] there he was just doing what God told
[19:09] him to
[19:11] do when his job was done every every
[19:16] flower Fades that's right you going to
[19:19] either die when your job is done or God
[19:22] allow you to do something to fade the
[19:26] flower look at these Great Men men of
[19:29] God that have gone on before the Lord I
[19:31] guess a lot of people think they being
[19:32] hell you don't know that God allow there
[19:35] ain't but one man that hit the target
[19:38] perfectly am am and that's Jesus
[19:44] alone am I making sense Jesus Christ is
[19:47] the only thing that's making it he's the
[19:49] only one that you can make it right
[19:51] everybody got a
[19:53] Jesus that's what Paul said you got to
[19:55] be careful about the Jesus you
[19:57] worship
[19:59] everybody got Jesus he said there's so
[20:01] many people that preach Jesus Christ for
[20:03] certain reasons some for money some for
[20:06] popularity and some Amen to work against
[20:08] the
[20:10] cross
[20:12] hello but they preach
[20:14] it they have their own Jesus but Paul
[20:18] said I'm the one that preaching the
[20:19] right one don't add or take away from
[20:24] it he said he did it they're worshiping
[20:27] the devil don't even know it but the
[20:29] squeeze is going to prove to him who
[20:31] they really
[20:33] worshiping when this world Council of
[20:35] churches come together and some of y'all
[20:37] think y'all got it all made but let me
[20:39] tell you something if you ain't got the
[20:41] Holy Ghost you'll be squealing like
[20:43] Peter
[20:45] amen it's the
[20:49] truth and Peter denied him three times
[20:52] and he still was elected God so elected
[20:54] him amen he was a
[20:56] sportsman on the day of Pentecost come
[20:59] on somebody see you can't listen I I
[21:02] look at this thing and I said hey Jesus
[21:04] said already when they said Lord let let
[21:07] my that woman says let my one son sit on
[21:09] the right and one on the left everybody
[21:11] has a different way of worshiping y
[21:13] y'all understand what I'm saying and I
[21:15] don't criticize that but here was this
[21:17] woman amen trying amen her best Amen to
[21:21] to to to put her sons and position he
[21:23] says not so I can't do that because
[21:27] these positions were given by the father
[21:29] before the foundation of the
[21:32] world so nobody can take my seat amen
[21:36] and nobody can take your
[21:41] seat listen come on God Ain a ain't
[21:43] making no exchanges well I'll take him
[21:46] over him he didn't do it right so I'll
[21:48] take you no he's already determined who
[21:52] will and who
[21:53] won't as I said you are ordained to do
[21:57] what you do
[22:03] listen what he says though but he said I
[22:06] will ASC sin above the heights of the
[22:08] clouds I will be like the most high yet
[22:10] thou shall be brought down to Hell to
[22:13] the sides of the pit you're going to sin
[22:17] but I'm going to bring you down
[22:19] Hallelujah and the and the word of God
[22:22] said you going to be brought down bride
[22:24] but I'll bring you
[22:26] up right that can't worm palmerworm and
[22:29] Locust amen ate that plant down all the
[22:31] way down to the stump
[22:34] am but God had a word I shall restore
[22:38] say the Lord amen huh I shall restore
[22:42] I'm so glad none of y'all got anything
[22:44] to do with my salvation I'm so glad
[22:48] there ain't nobody in here to say well
[22:50] you know what I'm not sure I want
[22:52] brother Brooks to be there or not I'm so
[22:55] glad you had nothing to do with it
[23:00] and you ought to be glad I don't have
[23:02] nothing to do with
[23:06] yours huh amen exactly
[23:11] right now you know what correction in
[23:14] itself is not always
[23:17] joyous but the fruit the Bible said what
[23:20] it will produce afterwards is what we
[23:24] look at is that right come on
[23:27] somebody
[23:35] you know one thing about the
[23:36] Pentecostals they didn't know that the
[23:38] Holy Ghost had
[23:40] order until the prophet of God came on
[23:42] the
[23:43] scene they were speak in tongues and
[23:45] interpret tongues they didn't care what
[23:47] part of the word was it was going on the
[23:49] the the the first part the middle part
[23:51] or the last part and you know they
[23:53] thought that that prophecy or that
[23:55] anointing amen was fresh manner
[23:59] straight from the throne there ain't
[24:01] nothing that's greater than the word
[24:04] amen and your little our little
[24:06] emotional things that Paul says hold up
[24:09] if you got a true gift he said you hold
[24:11] fast you wait amen till your time come
[24:15] but the word must have
[24:18] preeminence
[24:20] hello come on somebody did you know the
[24:23] prophet of God said those Chicago
[24:25] preachers he said they were they were
[24:27] all supposed to come down down and and
[24:29] and and and and be baptized in the name
[24:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ but he said
[24:33] they had a prophecy to come forth and
[24:36] said you don't have to do it you keep
[24:38] what you got and I bless you and they
[24:41] thought that was God that's why they
[24:43] didn't come down and they're still
[24:46] deceived to this day
[24:49] hello because they put a sign and a
[24:51] wonder over the
[24:56] word m
[24:59] help us Lord that I was fresh from the
[25:01] throne that wasn't brother Brooks now
[25:04] listen the spoken word with faith watch
[25:08] this watch this because here Lucifer
[25:10] said I will descend I will do this I
[25:14] will do that and you know what he had
[25:16] confidence in his own
[25:18] will because he did
[25:21] it oh come on somebody he had confidence
[25:25] and here we are with the spoken word and
[25:27] we can't can't even have
[25:32] confidence we must learn how to take God
[25:35] at his word and when God anoints us to
[25:38] say something we ought to have
[25:40] confidence I don't mean no harm whether
[25:42] you feel it or not the Bible said with
[25:44] the stripes we heal that's
[25:47] it you don't have to feel nothing just
[25:50] like I told you the other day I said
[25:51] that's where Satan defeats us is that
[25:54] the truth oh if I feel it that means I'm
[25:57] better that is a
[25:59] lie because when you start feeling bad
[26:02] you going to feel like youve lost it cuz
[26:03] you're no longer feeling
[26:07] good now that is a slap in the face
[26:11] right because it as the word the Bible
[26:13] said the word of God came and healed
[26:16] them you are healed by the word it
[26:19] doesn't matter how good you feel or how
[26:22] bad you feel the Bible says you are
[26:25] healed by his stripes
[26:28] amen y'all hear what I'm saying how you
[26:32] going to make a Rapture if you go base
[26:33] it on your
[26:36] feelings you don't feel like a Christian
[26:42] sometime oh if you do feel like a
[26:44] Christian some days y'all know it's the
[26:45] truth some days you feel you hit a home
[26:48] run every base is clear and you making
[26:51] it boy come on somebody but then there
[26:53] are some days there somebody's blocking
[26:55] that
[26:57] base right
[26:58] pitch that ball amen out of
[27:03] here come on then you go back home
[27:06] repenting and asking God to forgive
[27:09] you how do you feel when that happens
[27:12] amen those things don't take away your
[27:15] salvation it doesn't take away your
[27:19] Christianity sealed to the day of your
[27:23] Redemption Hallelujah come on somebody
[27:26] it's true anyhow the problem is we lose
[27:29] our joy based upon our
[27:33] feelings all of us has been guilty of
[27:35] that feeling ain't got nothing to do
[27:37] with
[27:39] it excuse me I was going to say this
[27:41] this morning I'm not throwing this off
[27:43] at anybody but even in the world today
[27:45] people say well I feel a man sometimes
[27:47] say well I feel like a woman inside I
[27:49] don't care ain't no woman in
[27:54] you or you know or vice versa that ain't
[27:57] true but they go on to change their
[28:00] whole structure physically we I just
[28:03] read that in the Mormon's Church they
[28:06] got a man who who literally got a sex
[28:09] change and want the Mormon church to
[28:11] accept him as a
[28:16] woman and he's on the radio he was
[28:20] crying surely there's got to be a place
[28:22] for us oh when he said that I thought
[28:25] about
[28:27] it
[28:29] if he don't repent there is a place
[28:32] there's a place for every one of us if
[28:34] we don't
[28:36] repent oh let me tell you this and I
[28:39] never said this portion of that dream
[28:41] but I'm going tell you something if you
[28:42] knew if anybody knew the torture that
[28:45] homosexuality Gets In Hell they'll run
[28:48] from that thing with all their
[28:51] might that vow thing I'm telling you God
[28:54] really punishes people like that only
[28:56] because they didn't
[29:01] repent you better run from that
[29:05] one if he stored the whole earth for
[29:07] that come on somebody you have no idea

[46:48] rather believe what God put here than to
[46:50] believe some scientist who going off
[46:54] somewhere oh what's the matter with with
[46:57] them I don't care about the moon I
[46:59] remember the time brother Bon was having
[47:01] that discussion with that man he said I
[47:03] didn't know he said he said when the man
[47:04] said where is that being that was in the
[47:06] go he said the
[47:08] serpent and and brother BR said didn't
[47:11] me he started talking like oh he must
[47:12] have went under the flood extinct or
[47:14] something and the man says no sir you're
[47:16] talking about the word of God he said if
[47:18] the if it was a serpent uh then he must
[47:21] still be living brother bam didn't even
[47:23] know that he didn't even he didn't even
[47:24] know the
[47:25] answer he to the Beast and then then God
[47:28] said it was the serpent excuse me I had
[47:30] to mix up he said then it was the
[47:32] serpent y'all see what I'm saying God
[47:35] knows what he wrote you don't have to
[47:37] know it all he's in you he knows it all
[47:41] if you depend on him he will speak it
[47:43] for you
[47:45] Hallelujah take no thought when they
[47:47] deliver you up in the counsel I know a
[47:49] lot of y'all been like oh The Squeeze is
[47:50] coming and what I'm going to say I don't
[47:52] halfway know this message yes you do you
[47:54] know all of it if the Holy Ghost is in
[47:56] you you know all of it and it knows you
[47:58] Hallelujah and he will speak for you in
[48:01] that day don't you worry about it cuz
[48:03] all of us I wish I could remember but
[48:05] you know God wouldn't let me have that
[48:07] cuz you know he know probably I'd be
[48:09] proud if I could quote the page in the
[48:12] book and the you know I know some people
[48:14] who can quote chapters of the
[48:16] Bible chapters from Genesis all the way
[48:19] to
[48:21] Revelation I struggle have always
[48:25] struggled I learned James one
[48:29] time and because I wasn't quoting it
[48:31] enough I can't remember half of James
[48:35] but y'all understand what I'm saying my
[48:37] point is brother Brown said it like this
[48:39] he said there was one time I didn't even
[48:40] need any notes he said but as I go older
[48:43] I find myself having to have
[48:46] notes now that was back then come on
[48:50] somebody amen see what we fail to see
[48:53] and I I I I I know some preachers who
[48:55] who who refused to preach with uh notes
[48:58] because of him saying that and some
[49:00] people have a gift like that I know some
[49:02] people who can take one or two
[49:03] scriptures and they off but everybody
[49:06] don't have it that
[49:07] way amen let me move on it is okay I'm
[49:10] almost done people I'm almost done
[49:12] because I know we've got communion now
[49:14] my point is this now when when he says
[49:16] listen he says he goes on he says uh now
[49:20] think let the let the soak in and when
[49:22] you play this tape on this point stop
[49:25] for a while and think
[49:27] his works are exalted above God talking
[49:30] about Satan God's word his works are
[49:34] exalted above God's word and manifested
[49:40] works the wisdom of Satan which he gives
[49:43] to Eve at the beginning see now the
[49:46] wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne
[49:48] of worship in man above the Vindicated
[49:52] word of God for the hour you say it
[49:54] can't be he said yes it is he said When
[49:57] anybody says I'm a Methodist I'm a
[49:58] Baptist I'm a presbyterian he said they
[50:01] exalting their system above the word and
[50:04] that system is not of God am so if it's
[50:07] not of God who is it
[50:11] of you exalt it because you say my
[50:14] church don't believe in that but the
[50:16] Bible says it yes amen it ain't your
[50:19] church it's what the Bible says and if
[50:21] you take whatever your church above What
[50:24] God Says amen it becomes idolatry you
[50:28] worship that thing more than you
[50:30] worshiping
[50:32] God our churches proed that by their
[50:35] seminar schools of learning that learned
[50:38] more than gods word knowed about it they
[50:41] think and there's doctors so and so
[50:43] teacher so and so and Professor so and
[50:45] so has exalted their own Knowledge
[50:47] socalled from Satan true above the
[50:50] Vindicated promise of God made clear
[50:53] right before them and men fall for it
[50:56] see his scientific achievements trying
[50:58] to prove God's word wrong just think of
[51:01] that he his that is the man theology
[51:04] explain God's word to the people and
[51:06] makes it of no effect against against
[51:10] like he had it in denomination of age
[51:12] when Jesus appeared on the earth is that
[51:14] right he said you Hypocrites you by your
[51:17] tradition has took the word of God and
[51:19] made it of no effect and that's what he
[51:21] said he's that's one of the things that
[51:23] can stop the word of God that is your
[51:24] own traditions
[51:27] your Traditions stop the word of God
[51:30] hello
[51:31] somebody hello hello you know because a
[51:35] lot of times people feel like you know
[51:38] what about those who are born Buddhists
[51:40] or those who are Hindus their Traditions
[51:44] said well okay I was born this way I
[51:45] mean God M I was raised that way and so

[52:06] truth he is the only door he's the only
[52:09] one there is no other come on somebody
[52:14] and I'm going tell you something how do
[52:15] you describe Jesus everybody described
[52:17] Jesus by their
[52:20] Doctrine your Doctrine doesn't it's the
[52:23] word Jesus is the word he never said I
[52:24] was your Doctrine he said I am the word
[52:28] in the beginning was the word the word
[52:30] was with God and the Word was God your
[52:32] Doctrine if it doesn't fit in this it is
[52:35] wrong amen it is another Jesus come on
[52:39] somebody it's true I don't care if
[52:41] you're in the message or well you're not
[52:42] in the message amen it must stay
[52:45] according to the word of God he
[52:51] brought you love the Lord
[52:55] amen can I say one more thing and I'm
[52:59] going to let you go because I'm going
[53:00] tell you something there's a I know some
[53:02] women preachers that can
[53:04] preach and I know that's why some women
[53:06] come here and they can't stand it they
[53:08] go on because they want to be a preacher
[53:10] they got that anointing on them and they
[53:12] don't see that a woman is not called to
[53:15] preach oh come on somebody it's true
[53:19] anyhow and you
[53:21] know how can you tell them they're not
[53:24] call especially when they're gifted
[53:27] there's some women preachers who who got
[53:29] some little discernment and everything
[53:30] with
[53:33] them come on Janice and jambes come on
[53:36] somebody now I want you to understand by
[53:38] the grace of God Amen but they say well
[53:41] I I I know I just felt the anointing and
[53:44] oh my goodness
[53:46] listen I don't mean no harm that
[53:49] anointing don't mean give me let me
[53:52] understand you so you can understand me
[53:55] the anointing of God is like
[53:57] rain it falls on the just and the unjust
[54:01] you can't tell me the weeds out there
[54:03] are not rejoicing and having a good time
[54:05] when the rain
[54:07] falls matter of fact they flourish far
[54:10] more far faster than the real
[54:12] thing come on somebody when the wind
[54:15] blow the weeds are swaying in the wind
[54:17] just like the
[54:21] wheat hello but all the rain does is
[54:25] produce what seed you have on the
[54:28] inside it doesn't change anything
[54:31] whatever the seed is in you is what the
[54:33] rain will
[54:38] produce am I making
[54:41] sense and they will put their
[54:43] experience over the word you can't do
[54:49] that unless you get a dust said the Lord
[54:52] you better know you got one
[54:55] though how many y'all been guilty of
[54:59] that y'all getting quiet nobody likes to
[55:02] admit they wrong but it's the truth
[55:06] anyhow it's the truth
[55:09] anyhow you
[55:11] know I I put it this
[55:15] way if y'all was living in the days of
[55:20] Paul I wonder how many of y'all would
[55:22] have received
[55:25] him
[55:28] how
[55:29] many Paul don't have a good reputation
[55:32] you know he done Stone Stephen and then
[55:36] caus hundreds to
[55:40] blaspheme the true enemy of
[55:43] God everybody knew he was a
[55:46] devil but
[55:50] God come on somebody it's true everybody
[55:53] knew he was a devil but God and God
[55:56] comes
[55:57] along and Strikes this man
[56:02] Soul Not only was he a seed of God but
[56:07] he's the angel to the
[56:09] church now God do let all this happen
[56:12] brother he's got a bad reputation
[56:14] Brother Rich now he got to be your
[56:17] [Laughter]
[56:19] boss y'all hear what I'm saying now he
[56:22] got to be over
[56:24] you he comes along now think about it I
[56:27] done been with Jesus three and a half
[56:30] years and Paul comes over to Peter and
[56:34] rebukes him makes him
[56:38] right now if Peter didn't have the Holy
[56:41] Ghost it would have been a real
[56:45] struggle y'all hear what I'm saying
[56:48] because he could have easily Justified
[56:50] that how can you tell me what's right
[56:51] when I done been with him three and a
[56:53] half years and not only that amen when
[56:55] he got crucified and everything else I
[56:56] was among
[56:58] them y'all hear what I'm saying and here
[57:01] Paul you the one amen that come and you
[57:03] done killed a lot of my brothers and
[57:05] sisters in the Lord and you called them
[57:07] the blaspheming I heard how you were
[57:09] there with stepen and you made him
[57:10] blasphemed you you held the held his
[57:13] coat while they were throwing those
[57:15] stones and you going to tell me what to
[57:17] do no Peter humbled himself you know why
[57:21] cuz he saw the gift in
[57:23] him he know what God was doing in him
[57:25] and down the road Peter said Paul say
[57:27] things that are hard to be understood
[57:30] but he never said he was
[57:38] wrong you love the Lord am I'm
[57:45] closing as I said this morning and
[57:48] Wednesday we we've come to a Time amen
[57:51] that we've got to get get more serious
[57:53] about the
[57:54] word you know we've got to realize and
[57:57] recognize that God has done a great work
[57:59] for us he made it simple and easy for us
[58:02] all we got to do is Follow the Leader
[58:04] amen something that you were taught from
[58:07] the from the foundation of the world I'm
[58:09] Not Your Leader the Holy Ghost is amen
[58:11] like I'm not your pastor the Holy Ghost
[58:13] is I'm just the
[58:16] assistant I try to do what he wants me
[58:18] to do amen you love the Lord let's
[58:25] stand
[58:30] that is the hardest thing to do is get
[58:32] people to change especially when they
[58:34] get in
[58:35] traditional uh uh uh ways of lives and
[58:38] doing things a certain way and they fail
[58:41] to see that change will come as we grow
[58:45] older changes come you know I I I I used
[58:49] to uh you know love a lot of things when
[58:51] I was a child and wouldn't be D caught
[58:53] doing it right now why because the love
[58:56] of those things are no longer there I've
[58:58] matured I've grown amen into h a man and
[59:02] so like Paul said those childish things
[59:04] I I I put away you know one of the
[59:07] things that that children one of the
[59:10] things that children um how can I say
[59:12] recognize and adopt in a quick manner
[59:16] those things that they say this is
[59:19] mine this is
[59:22] mine right this is mine and it's and
[59:25] it's very difficult for them to share
[59:28] what they know is mine you ever seen
[59:31] children you know you get one child my
[59:33] grandchildren they do it all the time
[59:35] one could be playing with a toy and the
[59:37] other one playing with something else
[59:39] but if you see that one playing with his
[59:41] toy he'll drop that toy come over get
[59:43] that one and say this is
[59:45] mine and so we have to teach them how to
[59:49] share come on so let me put it this way
[59:53] because a lot of time y'all we say this
[59:55] is mine it ain't
[59:57] yours is his you're bought with a price
[1:00:02] he's
[1:00:05] not right amen so God can do exactly
[1:00:09] what he wants to do as long as we keep
[1:00:12] his word follow through with it God got
[1:00:15] some wonderful things up the road for us
[1:00:19] amen I believe that with all my heart
[1:00:22] and uh you know just keep those things
[1:00:25] in mind by the of
[1:00:26] God uh how that we must stay as true to
[1:00:31] the word as we possibly
[1:00:33] can understand the grace of God and
[1:00:36] election and think let me put it this
[1:00:38] way when you're in a
[1:00:41] position and you think that there's no
[1:00:44] answer
[1:00:46] to your question or way out this is what
[1:00:49] I
[1:00:50] believe
[1:00:54] Moses
[1:00:56] was
[1:01:00] trapped the Egyptians were
[1:01:03] coming the mountains blocked him Nowhere
[1:01:07] to Run nowhere to
[1:01:10] hide and it just seemed like there was
[1:01:12] no way
[1:01:15] out God said to Moses why cry speak
[1:01:20] it bring this thing to pass let your
[1:01:24] words and your confession
[1:01:27] open the
[1:01:28] sea and when it does you walk out on it
[1:01:32] oh come on
[1:01:33] somebody when you realize amen you in a
[1:01:36] place where you can't get out of it God
[1:01:38] is saying I'm waiting on you now there's
[1:01:41] something you got to do to get out of
[1:01:43] this oh Lord have mercy hey I'm feeling
[1:01:46] pretty good right
[1:01:48] now because I can tell you I can't tell
[1:01:51] you how many times I've come to
[1:01:54] places
[1:01:57] and it just make you want to
[1:02:01] run it does it makes you want to run but
[1:02:06] God says uhuh it ain't time to run you
[1:02:08] stand right there I got a victory for
[1:02:11] you right now I got something amen that
[1:02:13] I want to show want to show you
[1:02:15] supernaturally you just stand still and
[1:02:18] speak that word of God and believe in
[1:02:21] the word you have spoken that the word
[1:02:24] out of your mouth is God cuz I told you
[1:02:27] to
[1:02:31] speak he took that word understanding he
[1:02:34] was a true Son of God and that God was
[1:02:36] in the midst of him he there was no
[1:02:38] power in that stick it was power in
[1:02:43] obedience hello and he spoke that word
[1:02:46] that that she roll back like that and he
[1:02:50] walked out on dry land and I don't care
[1:02:53] what the situation is listen I'm going
[1:02:56] tell you something I'm going tell you
[1:02:58] right now if anybody in here if you
[1:03:00] receive that spirit that you're going to
[1:03:02] die you will
[1:03:06] die it's just like when when the devil
[1:03:08] say oh you getting worse if you receive
[1:03:11] that Spirit I'm getting worse you going
[1:03:13] to get
[1:03:15] worse am I making sense you don't
[1:03:18] receive such negative stuff from
[1:03:22] Satan huh brother man say when the devil
[1:03:24] come to you with a box of rattles snakes
[1:03:26] you you send that baby
[1:03:29] back y'all hear what I'm saying don't
[1:03:32] receive that because whatever you
[1:03:34] confess will happen to you and it
[1:03:37] doesn't necessarily mean it's the will
[1:03:39] of God y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:03:42] brother brandom said there was a woman
[1:03:43] amen she was strick and I think she had
[1:03:45] cancer she was going to die he said God
[1:03:48] had already healed her he had done
[1:03:51] everything he could to get that woman to
[1:03:54] believe and she refused she couldn't do
[1:03:57] it she had let that symptom tell her she
[1:04:01] was going to die and guess what she died
[1:04:05] he said but God was right there had even
[1:04:07] healed her healed her but she let that
[1:04:11] Spirit caused her to believe that she
[1:04:14] was going to die and so she
[1:04:17] did let me tell you something when God
[1:04:19] say you healed you
[1:04:21] healed yes I don't care it ain't got
[1:04:24] nothing to do with your feelings your
[1:04:25] feelings don't have nothing to do with
[1:04:27] it I don't care if a pain shoot from the
[1:04:29] top of your head to the bottom of your
[1:04:31] feet you say Satan you are a liar and
[1:04:35] with his stripes I'm Healed I don't care
[1:04:38] if your fever go up to 105 you ought to
[1:04:40] be stuttering and saying with his
[1:04:42] stripes I'm
[1:04:44] Healed because I'm going tell you the
[1:04:46] angel of God is right there to open up
[1:04:47] the Red Sea for you and let you walk out
[1:04:49] on D dry land don't tell me that I know
[1:04:53] I know that God that devil been just
[1:04:55] just messing with your minds and all
[1:04:57] that amen that ain't nothing but a
[1:04:58] tormenting devil and God don't mean for
[1:05:01] his children to be
[1:05:04] tormented whenever tormenting is in
[1:05:06] there you have done no no evil no wrong
[1:05:09] and you know it you done search yourself
[1:05:12] then you got to recognize it's a devil
[1:05:14] and if it's a devil it got to
[1:05:17] go you know what sometimes people need
[1:05:20] help though you can't look at somebody

[1:05:33] creating that
[1:05:38] atmosphere am I making sense I'm making
[1:05:42] sense because I want you to understand
[1:05:43] amen people of God Moses couldn't do it
[1:05:46] by himself uh Joshua I believe it was
[1:05:48] amen he had those two men come up and
[1:05:50] they held his
[1:05:52] hand sometimes we don't have strength to
[1:05:54] hold his hand up so God sent somebody to
[1:05:57] help me hold my hand up God so somebody
[1:06:00] help me hold this hand of Victory up
[1:06:03] help me Lord and as long as Joshua hands
[1:06:06] were held up he got the Victory and when
[1:06:09] everybody start getting weak the enemy
[1:06:10] start getting the victory so it shows
[1:06:13] you the victory was his he just needed
[1:06:15] somebody to help him hold the hand up
[1:06:18] that's how it is sometime with us we
[1:06:20] might have trials and things going up
[1:06:21] sicknesses whatever the case may be get
[1:06:23] somebody that you know got some faith

[1:07:11] mustard seed it's the purity of
[1:07:15] it you cannot allow yourself to look at
[1:07:18] symptoms that's what Peter did Peter and
[1:07:22] I'm talking to somebody here and God
[1:07:23] knows who I'm talking to now you can

[1:07:40] never sang but as soon as he started
[1:07:42] looking at all the conditions around him
[1:07:45] he began to go down but listen it's all
[1:07:47] right he called on the name of Jesus he
[1:07:50] refocused his lens Hallelujah he called
[1:07:53] on Jesus and the Bible said he lifted
[1:07:55] him up come on that's all you need

[1:12:25] glory in
[1:12:27] anything I just know
[1:12:30] that I live every day for God I do my
[1:12:37] best but it doesn't mean that I'm not
[1:12:39] going to make mistakes at times I
[1:12:42] do sometimes you know I I'm thinking I'm
[1:12:45] somewhere spiritually and then you know
[1:12:49] if you catch me at the right time I'm
[1:12:52] surprised but it don't keep me from
[1:12:54] repenting
[1:12:58] I I get totally ashamed when I do
[1:13:01] wrong hello if I raise my voice I get
[1:13:05] embarrassed especially when at times
[1:13:08] when I know I shouldn't have you know I
[1:13:11] don't like that I I don't like
[1:13:16] that I you know I don't like losing any
[1:13:19] type of control because when when not
[1:13:22] that I'm in control but I mean losing
[1:13:24] his his
[1:13:26] control I just don't like that that
[1:13:30] bothers
[1:13:31] me so I I I I I say to you by the grace
[1:13:35] of God there's not one in here I don't
[1:13:36] love and care about my my only desire is
[1:13:41] to see all of us walk closer to God
[1:13:44] sometimes I have to say things I don't
[1:13:46] even want to say y'all might think I get
[1:13:49] Joy saying certain things there's
[1:13:51] certain things in my flesh I don't even
[1:13:54] want to say and God makes me say it
[1:13:58] anyhow I said some things tonight that
[1:14:00] he tried to get me to say this
[1:14:02] morning but I had to say it he wouldn't
[1:14:05] let me get away why cuz there's somebody
[1:14:07] here that really needs
[1:14:11] it every one of us can make a
[1:14:15] Rapture if we humble ourselves and
[1:14:17] there's one quote I was W to quote but I
[1:14:19] won't worry with it right now but but I
[1:14:21] will paraphrase it brother Bron said
[1:14:23] there was a man who built a a painting
[1:14:25] or a statue of Jesus Christ and there
[1:14:27] was one man who was looking at it he was
[1:14:28] criticizing this painting he says it
[1:14:31] just it just don't show the the agony it
[1:14:33] just doesn't show what Jesus Christ went
[1:14:36] through and I think it's a statue in
[1:14:38] Italy or somewhere and then and then the
[1:14:40] the the GU the tour guy whoever he was
[1:14:42] he said but sir you looking at it the
[1:14:44] wrong way he said you got to kneel
[1:14:47] down and look up see that's what's wrong
[1:14:51] with us we looking at the word in the
[1:14:54] wrong way
[1:14:55] we look down on it instead of
[1:14:59] kneeling and recognizing it is
[1:15:02] God we're kneeling to the word it is
[1:15:07] God
[1:15:14] Amen
