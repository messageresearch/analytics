every time Satan thinks he's got the best of me God shows him that he doesn't God didn't miss any bases when it came to his salvation he covered them all and I am so glad to be part of this beautiful salvation to know that I don't have to worry I don't have to FR because he won the victory for me we're going to have just a little short message tonight TR that it will be an encouragement to you I I believe that we're living in the last days I believe that uh what we see the corona is doing stage for the next way and I want to tell you something people of God our Prophet told us that there were coming a virus that will literally eat the flesh away from the bones of men while they yet live and I really believe that whatever is bringing these things upon the Earth because we know it is man's intelligence always backfire on him and we are living in an intellectual age living in an age somewhat like Esther lived in where God is hardly known here we are in America founded upon religious and Christian principles there are so many millions who never met God never called on the name of Jesus Christ in sincerity but thank God the Bible says he's never left himself without a witness I'm so glad to be one of them real to them I he real to me it's not a my imagination but God is real I know him and he knows me let us turn to the scripture according to St John John amen the 10th chapter Hallelujah I love triumphing over the devil right he's GNA give us battles battles will come but I like whooping him and every time he he causes me to stumble God has a word get up more than one word that's more than one word and he called causes Us by his own inspiration to get up he's our unseen helper the world can't see him but we know when he's around John 1027 my inspiration uh came by the message William brandham um The Great and Mighty conqueror we know that he is and was the uh mouthpiece of God in his day now The Same Spirit of Elijah on Elisha which is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she is resounding have already been sounded The Book of Revelation tells us hallelujah in 10ap chapter that we must prophesy again and we're living in that day not adding to it nor taking away now we have a better light because we're living in the day that he spoke of Hallelujah prophecy has made been made clear by all of these modern events it reassures us that God's voice is the accurate Voice Hallelujah St John 10:27 sheep here my voice and I know them and they follow me and I make them work for eternal life that's not what it says I give unto them eternal life understand me I give it to you it's given to you you didn't work for it you don't ear deserve it Hallelujah it is God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah and they shall never perish tell that old Corona devil never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand is that right Jesus said if a man believe in me though he were dead shall he live so we live Hallelujah hey you look at this old flesh it's getting WR it's getting old the hairs are turning gray Hallelujah but that's just a sign of death in my flesh but the man inside of this This Old House needs repairall Hallelujah but understand by God's grace there someone who lives in this house will never grow old amen oh Hallelujah My Father which gave them me is greater than all no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand then he goes on to say he makes a statement here and the ph and all around because of this statement they they they wanted to give him the death sentence that right he went on to say and I am my father are one it out Hallelujah even Jesus says I came in my father's name and you won't receive me but there come another there come others who will come in their own name will receive them there's coming a deceitful individual that will make the world think he is the mighty savior Hallelujah and they will follow him it is their punishment it is God's judgment because when he brought when he came himself they rejected him you love the Lord my give me one more scripture please St John 18 and then I'm going to let you be seated you love the Lord St John 18 we start reading at the 33rd verse you have that place then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said to him art thou the king of the Jews and Jesus answered him saying thou this thing excuse me saying thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it deed of Me Jesus rep pilot answered I am a Jew thine own nation and the chief priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world I love if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered unto the Jew but now is my kingdom not from hence one of these old days this world will come the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's already fought for it the price has already been paid one of these old days the same people this world made mockery of was set in the seat with Jesus Christ pilate therefore said unto him thou a King Jesus answered thou say I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate said unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews here he goes and he says unto them I find in him no fault here God allowed the king of this world to acknowledge that there was no fault in Jesus maybe you may not understand this judgment Hall but every lamb you may be seated every lamb that was to be offered unto God had to be examined by the priest and Jesus being the Lamb of God he had to be examined oh they tried to find fault Hallelujah from judgment Hall they led the lamb he went to Pilot and they couldn't find no fault Herod couldn't find no fault all of those who examined him couldn't find any fault so they had to bear false witness but they failed to see truth is Everlasting a lie may run fast but truth endures you can never Stamp Out [Music] truth because he said it I am the truth and I am the way let's go I thought because I'm I'm I'm just thinking about how God has has enveloped us he's so engaged us with his love and his word is his love he's he's literally his word and and and surrounded us understand what I'm saying he is our protection even when you don't even know he's there he's there it's like when he rose from the dead and he was on the road to and here were these disciples is that right who actually were under his ministry and they could not recognize him the Bible said that he took the word of God and he started all the way from Moses and all the way up he preached Jesus Christ did you know that Jesus Christ is on every page of this book it takes a prophet to pull it out Jesus was the prophet prophet of all prophets he began to expound I can't imagine what their hearts felt like Jesus began to talk you understand me the very man that they so loved is now is now hiding himself and and the first thing he says which should be something that we should hear with our hearts all fools and slow at heart in other words what is it going to take you what must I do what must God do to make you believe all the scriptures have said about Christ some of the things all the things Christ was to suffer and die heathens Hallelujah but it's also written that he shall rise again and being that it is the third day you to be looking for him come on somebody you and I must understand is it not the third day day is it not since Luther started it is the third day and we supposed to be looking for the resurrection supp to all that the scriptures have said is he not walking Among Us now right in their mist and they could not see him but the problem they had so many things in their minds oh we thought Jesus was the Christ thought he was the one we thought he was the true Messiah dead now can you imagine talking to the Messiah talking to Jesus Hallelujah the whole time so I want to say something to you the one thing that Jesus did he got them off of the road into a small end he took them away from the cares of the world said he shut the door it was that time of communion it was that time of Fellowship let me tell you like this if you can separate from all unbelief from all the noise of the world somebody from all the voices Hallelujah in the world Hallelujah and calm yourself down so that you can be able to hear his voice it is then when God will begin to break the bread Hallelujah somehow he broke the bread and the Bible said their eyes were open hallelu let me say it like this no nobody can break the bread like Jesus himself Hallelujah now we must understand that our kingdom is not of this world order this world but really it means World Order there order to this world that we're not a part of this order uh uh can I say it this order amen uh um Praises Lucifer lucif Hallelujah this order uh uh uh uh uh glorifies death this order that we're living in is full of troubles and full of woes and you know and in science and you know they seem like they they're trying to f fix things and every time they try to fix it they break they make things worse Hallelujah see God's creation was perfect but mankind haveed it one of the things I want to throw out you know they have this thing they call fracking when they go to drill for oil and every time they go to drill for oil when they do the fracking it literally causes earthquakes in various places you understand me these people are cracking into the Earth and draining all of the oil out of it and then packing it with with dirt as if God don't know what you understand me take the oil out of your car pack it with dirt let's see what it work take the oil from a bicycle let's see will it work not going to work will make the bike break it it will break the car understand what I'm saying man think they're more intelligent than God the whole we are defeating our can't cut all the trees down God has a ecosystem Hallelujah we cut them all down we build our fany houses think Mother Nature is not going to get mad at Hallelujah and what we are experiencing is a ecosystem that is out of balance the Lo are multiplying the be are multiplying I'm telling something find that that even now the human race we're overpopulating the world as they say there's a food shortage I don't see how when they hying everything multiplying everything what we have in this Society in this world we have what we we we see the world system and the world is being ruled not by the sons of God figure that one out if the world is being ruled and handled not by the sons of God who who's ruling it who's running it and we know that the Bible tells us that Satan comes to steal kill and destroy Hallelujah I'm so glad to be living in this age I don't know what to do Hallelujah I'm glad to be in this message Hallelujah I've come through a lot of religions this is the only religion the only faith if I can say gives me some Assurance Hallelujah it makes me satisfied know that I know Jesus and to know that he knows me turn with me to isah 26 Hallelujah you love the Lord Isaiah 26 we'll begin reading at the first verse you there in that day shall this song Be Sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City Salvation with God appointed for walls and bull walks open ye the gates that the righteous Nation would keep it the truth may enter in thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is St on thee because he trusteth in thee now you got to realize that this scripture is eternal Everlasting it fits every age Hallelujah every dispensation and when you don't have peace it's only because you haven't kept your mind on the prin of Peace hallelujah look what he say this city will be a strong City hallelujah salvation will God appoint for walls and bull walks you understand me it's our Fortress salvation is our for Fortress hallelujah amen is that right the B Bible tells about a wall of fire but he also tells us that the fire is on the inside so he's not just around us with us but he's in us hallelujah my subject tonight would be my sheep heareth my voice and if I had a subtopic it would be scream for he has finished it I like that I tell people sometime on the phone I I'll holler at you later it's a certain figure a a term because back in the day we didn't have telephones and then when we needed a neighbor get to get somebody's attention we would holler like if my brother and I would be a block away or something like that my mother or my sister would call they go to the front porch or the back and they will holler and if you didn't hear the First Time The Voice was elevated and they kept hollowing until you answer answer and sometimes we had to run to get in a a space distance where they could hear us respond now we got all these phones and stuff you know we don't we don't need this we just need buttons that's where it came from so sometimes when I say yeah I'll see you later man I'll holl at you that's what it's all about amen but not on the phone we can just talk soft you love the Lord he goes on to say open ye the gates that the righteous Nation would keep it the truth may enter inall think about it I was thinking last night last night the scripture says he that is just let him be just f rightous let him be right he that is Holy and he that is filthy let him be filthy and it come to my mind like you know God was speaking to my heart because don't you know that scripture has to be fulfilled and none of us know the day and the hour where the judge will say that's enough Hallelujah my sheep hears my voice you and I must understand that God loves us so much we're now living in his longsuffering Hallelujah but even so the long suffering of God has a period of time when it's going to run out Hallelujah that's why the Bible says in the day that you hear his voice your heart understand me God Is So merciful to us his grace unmerited love he gives us we don't even deserve it I don't I don't know how you stand with that but I know myself I don't deserve it sometimes I just weep because of my no knowledge of how many times I can disappoint God in a day I know he still loves me Hallelujah those who keep it the truth you understand me truth is is to be kept this is why I love the Jewish people because they have kept what they see as truth they know there's only one God and they have kept that all of these sons and they love him they don't they don't have what we have we supposed to have the Holy Ghost all they got is Law and they still on it no matter how people hate them no matter how many people despises them the real Jew the real man of God or woman of God still esteem Jehovah Hallelujah let me go back to that again he will keep you in perfect peace that is so important because you got so many people who are afraid now afraid and in this time where everybody is crying because of fear the God said it ought to be a Shouting Time Hallelujah I got the victory he gave me the victory Hallelujah there is no failure in God I know this is simple but somebody needs we have people out there who listen and somebody is needing to know that they have been a failure today but God still have mercy God still loves you and he say keep get up keep moving forward hallelujah amen we understand by God's grace what God has done in our day TR in the Lord forever in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength he is Jehovah Gyra the Lord will always provide I don't understand people people are so worried that when times get hard I lost this that and the other let me say it like this when God shut Egypt down it never changed his ability to provide Hallelujah this time they weren get wasn't getting the food from the Egyptian got it directly from God hallelujah you understand my sheep hears my voice I'm coming to something because it is important that we have the ability to hear his voice why because he's the shepherd he's the one that leads us and you know and I know that our day is so full of distraction we're turning left and right and doing and we're failing to see amen is speaking are y'all listening tonight for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty City he L it low he layth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust Hallelujah is that right even James says how how ye rich man your day is coming Hallelujah maybe he was talking about today because this so-called Corona virus shut everything down even the rich man couldn't go to his favorite restaurant Hallelujah now they might call it Corona I call it God let me say it like this remember I started the scripture where Jesus Christ was in the Judgment Hall why was he there he was there because of you and me he had to be proven that there was no spot or blemish Hallelujah that his whole makeup was perfect Hallelujah they could only examine the outside Hallelujah but it was the inside that made Jesus Christ who he was Hallelujah is that right and he says in that day you know that I am in the Father the father is in me and I am in you so the same Glory that gave Jesus the

purchase W somebody help me here some of us might have been in the pool room some of us might have been on the street corners some of us might could have been on the yeah the whole house some of us may have been drug addicts it didn't matter what you are the price was paid and the Bible says that the Lord knows them that are here to be one of them I'm so glad that's he purchased the price he paid the price he paid it for you and he paid it for me oh come on somebody I cannot be lost twice when he found me I was in bad shape Hallelujah all of us we were we were Wicked people y'all know

him God who came looking for us hallelujah it was God who interrupted my life you know what I'm saying I'm so glad he interrupted my life he changed me I lost a few friends but I gained the greatest of friends because Jesus will stick closer than a brother hallelujah look what he says I love the Lord he didn't just pick me up from being a sinner and just say okay you're just a clean sinner but here in the 10th verse he says and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall rain with on the earth Hallelujah and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them that that was 10,000 times 10, thousands of thousand wait a minute I was there let me just shout let me just praise God hallelujah I was there you came fig it out I was there you were there Hallelujah and they were shouting and praising God they were screaming to the top of their voice why because they realized Jesus was the Savior and the thing I love about Jesus he said I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end hallelujah amen in order for the devil to get to be he has to come through my Lord he don't want no more Jesus my God doesn't put a whooping on him already Hallelujah but he hadn't seen nothing yet we going to put a whooping on him too he's afraid of you he don't want you to come to Perfection but can't stop you from coming to perfe because the word has already been spoken and the Bible say his word cannot come back voice don't know how he's going to do it believe he's going to do it every word of God that he promised me y it's a y I believe every bit of it right now whether you believe it or not transforming us right now his Hallelujah Every Creature wait a minute wait saying let's go to the 12 verse saying with a loud voice wory is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches WI and strength and honor and glory and blessing yall agree is he worthy he's worthy Hallelujah and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying now he said even the creatures in the sea I don't know how people how can you hear through water Voice Hallelujah my sheep here's my voice my animals my did you God has animals Hallelujah all animals are not of this world if I could say it like this some animals have been predestinated just like you Hallelujah all animals didn't get on the arked only those elected Hallelujah and I want you to know there's a plenty of horses up there there's a lot of animals up there I didn't say heaven I didn't say where Jesus is there is a place Hallelujah yes sir I love this Hallelujah my sheep hears my voice my point is nobody should be unhappy nobody right now I mean we fight things but let me say it like this with all of the promises of the word we should be in a in a shouting Lo Hallelujah we should be thanking God for everything that's why I he said in all things give thanks you believe your Shepherd do you trust his leadership I trust him I surely don't trust mine with all my heart I trust him like I was telling the people down in Iowa you think y'all we think we facing something when the Hebrew boys face fire and they were not even afraid wait a minute and we're afraid of the Corona and we supposed to be the bride somebody help me here which one would you rather face Corona or the fire okay that maybe that's maybe that's too too too too too wide of a range let's go to Dani and the Lions then hallelujah you know what I'm saying they were not afraid cuz they trusted God and they knew that God was the truth you understand me Faith is the revelation of God you understand me because God is that thing that exists he exist the devil trying to say he doesn't exist people say there is no God I see God in the Tre I see God in the sunrise I see God in the bir I see God in the animals I see God everywhere I even see God when he pulls a drunk man out of the street and won't allow him to be hit by a car the drun not even known it's God but that's the grace of God you understand me how many times you've been on the road almost in an accident and all of a sudden you say gee Hallelujah and then your car stops on a dime who did that that's God how many times you needed money God made you save money when you didn't even know you were saving it you put money in the pocket and forgot it was there but when you needed it God had you go in that pocket and pull that money out is that right you know my wife she said oh Happ day when she find money she find money I you don't find money in my pocket sweetie but my money is her money so you know what I'm saying she going to hold me to that for sure but God is good to us hallelujah and how many of y'all have ever done that before you forgot you put that little money away you had a 50 or 20 and you through your pockets before they go to wash or whatever the case may be or suit pocket and you pull I thank the Lord I I'll be thanking God but let me go on and I'm almost done because you got realized Paul laughed at the Devil now what are we afraid of he has no teeth he can't really bite you he has no Stinger he can't kill you you ever seen a man with no teeth he could hardly be understood so why you trying to listen to the devil when you can't even hardly understand what he's saying is that right give me one more scripture Proverbs Proverbs please first chapter let Hur I told you I wasn't going to be long and I don't I don't intend to not tell the truth but I get stirred up I get carried away I guess Proverbs the first chapter did we go there already okay Proverbs 1over beginning at the 26 vers so I want you to see what's happening now all these places who say God is not he's dead I heard one uh uh great so-called man of God Jesus made made a mistake when he let him crucify and when I heard that I said I'm so glad he made that [Laughter] mistake Hallelujah remember that right and I'm I guess I'm going to jump the scripture because the time is going but when he he was on the cross the Pharisees the Sadducees all of them those groups of people even oh he can save others but but he can't save himself what a compliment that he saved himself we would still be lost God he didn't save himself he could have called 10,000 angels all he had to do was move one of his fingers you understand me he destroyed Satan by one finger all he had to do was move one thinger and all of the angels that were setting in the tree Hallelujah they would have reaped havoc on the world hallelujah amen they better be glad all Jesus would have had to say was hell hey all of Heaven would have been dispatched they would have had to make new world you love the Lord Proverbs 1 26 he said but one day we're fighting did y'all know that one day we're going to come and fight after mum we're coming again riding with on white horses we going we going to destroy Satan I hope I place that in the right place but anyway let's move on we know we coming on white horses so so so if they people say well you know you see animals in the hen what and animals ain't know in heaven well they got horses up there the B say they got living creatures up there you know right listen I also will laugh at your Calamity I will mock you marck when your fear [Music] coming w because 911 wasn't enough 911 wasn't enough you think that this country would have repented that's all God requires but instead of repenting we boast ourselves we're going to make this nation greater who said that it wasn't thus said the Lord hallelujah God had already announced the Judgment was was in beginning of judgment it started in 1962 we're almost at the end of this thing Pence and all of these things are striking the Earth I'm going to laugh at you now he's not talking about the electri seed he's talking about those who refuse to hear his call no fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when this distress and anguish cometh upon [Music] you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord in other words you know Malachi 4 came the message came the evening light came and they refused it they didn't want it and now he says oh you going to call on me now no yall understand me I'm not talking about talking you know to a backslider or somebody who knew God and all of that I'm talking about people who knew truth and just walked away from it and didn't want it anymore said I'm laugh at you he said brother they know yes they knew just like those 72 preachers that walked away from Jesus they knew and theyed John 666 they must Mark with the mark of the beast Hallelujah for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof you don't have to do that they say you're just too religious oh we're just going to let our women do what they want they can preach if they want they can be prophets if they want they can be pastors if they want just do what see what I'm saying what what they fail to see is that there shall be light in the evening time just speaking in Tong and shouting and dancing word a word of Correction according to Revelations third chapter God says repent repent and be to repent but instead of being zous to repent they put Jesus Christ out of his own church the show that's what they got you understand me there shall they eat of wait a minute they would none of my counsel all my reprove therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices they having their own Revival and Jesus a even there Hallelujah kind of like uh Mary and Joseph they left off without Jesus didn't even know he was gone and that's how a lot of the organization denominations have become without Jesus Jes the word hallelujah and when you leave off the word you leave him it ain't about music and all of that that's [Applause] good Hallelujah for the turn Turning Away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whosoever hearken unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil my sheep Hearth my voice and a stranger they will not follow do you hear his voice tonight if you really are not afraid you need to be quiet what evil no evil shall come n your Dwelling Place evil can conquer you when everything is been conquered can I find another let me

is with God we fail we F us is that right the prophet of God said it like this we were Sinners we were failures to begin with if there is any success in your life it's only because Jesus Christ has given it to you you love the Lord I said I wasn't going to keep you long and I know I have kept you long so I'm going to say I'm not going to keep you any longer so let's stand by I thank you for your patience one thing for sure you can never put time on God but I thank you for your patience God is good to us and I am so grateful because I never understood many things about the grace of God I

the day of your you have the Holy Ghost and still make mistakes now we're coming into this day where God is bringing us into a Perfection but the Perfection is is the inward man not the flly man the
