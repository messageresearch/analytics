this this we preached about this on wednesday amen we read the same scripture and uh by the grace of god we try to uh continue with the same thought amen luke chapter 1 verse 13 chapter 1 verse 13 the bible says that but the angels say unto him fear not vicarious for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john campbell the amen the the most important part i mean the the most important part of this verse that goes along with you know the uh the sermon today this morning i mean it's the first part of this verse where the bible says that by the angel said unto him fear not the carious for that prayer is heard amen let's go ahead again for the priest lord god we just read your word lord you are the only one or father god who can come and explain it to us [Music] glory that's why we invite you father god to come lord to open this amen like i said we'll continue with the same subject zone constructed and this morning is as a subtitle uh it'll be in one accord now for your prayers it'll be in one accord amen they've been praying god to give them a son or two to give them a child amen because they didn't have one because they didn't have any you know people and then they kept on praying god it's uncontrollable and one morning god god is uh god said the angel yo you're meant to go give them the good news you're going to tell them they're not to fear anymore amen because god has heard their prayers not to fear anymore they might amen the thing that they've been asking god for which will bring the joy in their heart because the purpose because god says amen we pray the bible says that we pray amen we ask some senses amen and we have to act like it in the world we have to be like him dude happier all the time if you read the story of jesus in the bible amen you will know that jesus was happy all the time amen even though when he went to lazarus was dead he was sad for a while he started crying that brought happiness to people even god wants us to be happy god wants us to be to be uh to be smiling all the time amen that's why he says that fear not for your prayer is hurt amen certainly that you know here we have been asking god things something amen every one of us have been asking god things all the sacrifices that you've been making the sacrifices of it amen of the sleepless night that you've been spending on some so praying and crying so that god can give you what you need to do this is what's going on there's a good news this morning amen fear not no camp amen for your prayers in genesis chapter 11 verse 1 amen and we will read verse 1 and then jump to verse 5 and verse 6. and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech now verse 5 the bible says and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of israel which did i'm sorry which the children of men build it and the lord said behold the people is one eternal divorcee is former answered purple and have all one language and this they begin to do it and now nothing will be restrained from them wish they have imagined to do it here you'll notice that the people were in one accord amen people had one objective you'll understand that those people were laid amen it was a bad uh uh spirit that was leading themselves because they had one language have been so long because they had one speech because they had one objective because they would they were all in one accord and god himself said remember amen nothing will stand in their way nothing will be restrained to them everything that they would put their mind to do they would do it they were they were under a false anointing it this reason for it they had a bad motive but because but because they were all together they were in one accord it meant everything that they set their mind to it meant that we're gonna do it but what if the bride of christ the christian man with the anointing of the holy spirit amen we can all get together in one according on outside you know amen if those people amen who were sinners they wanted to do something that god didn't like amen but because they were one because they were united himself had to come down and bring and bring a confusion between them do you remember the confusion now the bride of christ oh the church of the living god amen because it's the uniting time hey man you see that the united nations amen they're coming together amen you see that rome is bringing all those countries together amen to forget all the the debate and all the the confusions that we try to bring amen and focus on one thing we will see great things happening amen because we are supposed to be a sheep amen and god is our shepherd amen and when it gets when it's winter amen you'll see that the sheep they all come together they all will be all together in one place amen to the needs of their fellowship amen and if the church of god is silly amen also can come together and when the time is bad amen amen when everything is against us we all can come together amen and when transmitting the fire of the holy spirit meant for the future it meant from one body to another body amen will amen will be the greater we the greatest army that the world has ever has never seen a man well because we have first of all we have god on our side at the end of the lord fighting for us as the jew amen we have nothing to fear no no amen we need to strengthen we need we we need to be together they meant to strength to strengthen our bones we meant to strengthen this community amen this love amen that john spent his time writing be writing about don john amen that one true commandment amen amen that this this entire commandment that god gave back in the old testament neighbor amen because you said the five first commandments was our duty to god amen you will never heaven that you never have another god before me division then you love your neighbor amen that will prove that you are a child of the light that you came from god because when you do germany and you will go back to god we have to be in one accord amen but when they decided to divide that empire that was when the the uh the failure of that empire became it one was stronger than the others they were starting out to fight against each other now the enemy knew where the weakest link was they digest it was coming from that place from that when that place would the wink is linked and then they would go and destroy the king when they were all together they did not have the empire and to fight for it for the king for the emperor amen and this that's the same thing with the church amen when we are all together amen we fight for one purpose of us that's what jesus that's what god wants us to be this good juventus that's how he wanted he wanted us to be mentioned he's wrong amen to support one another that if two of you shall agree on earth and as touching anything that they they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven how jesus started with this he said when two of you saw agree amen when you are in one accord amen then you ask something it shall be given to you even four word two or three are gathered together there i am in one thing then you ask it to pray to the father amen and it shall be given to you even the fervent prayer of the righteousness of the righteous man evaluates much let him call for the elders of the church and let him pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins there shall be forgiven him the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man developed the book of james is one of my favorite book of the new testament amen hey man you have to ask genuinely yummy has to be that uh i think it says that elisha was a man of of of of of many um what's the word to forget um i can't remember mr vernier passions like us that's the word meaning that it was a sinner like us meaning that he made mistakes like we make mistakes not good so they can't wait anymore oh my god honor this prayer amen that it doesn't matter how see how many sins that you have committed in god's eyes amen you have no scenes on your on your record you saw i mean it doesn't matter what people say these days even god says you're holy insane so therefore you can go to him and ask something like ever come out of the building of the walls of jericho joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory jose martinez and walked around and around and around jericho for seven days in full armor it was a promise god made the says that how much can you walk around the wheel and what you can around the wheelchair amen how much can you just i mean how much can you walk around the they were on the cancer community amen how much can you walk around singing the victory amen that god gives the promise for the victory that there is no change in the apache is becoming worse and worse keep on shouting your victory continuing keep on praising god amen be like that blind man that the prayer the prophet prayed for his life the prophet even he believed god amen the prophet prayed for him remember he couldn't see him and the prophet told him to go and stop proclaiming his victory amen the prophet asked him do you believe god you're perfect he said yes i believe god the prophet asked him so why are you questioning god you're perfect if he says that you will heal that means that you're here go and proclaim amen the prophet says that this man the prophetically amen he didn't know how to how to apply the faith because he was a catholic man that's why the prophet told him to go proclaim that healing amen [Music] can see him and he was coming to the meeting and stopping the meeting and said that i can see praise the lord amen people were asking him but but you can't see you can't tell what's in front of you but how can you say these words he says that the prophet prayed for me amen god gave me his word amen god gave me promise amen i have been here so i believe it it means [Music] that we are victorious amen that god god has given us the victory to shout the victory too amen because god has given you the victory your prayer has been heard it doesn't matter what your boss says stop proclaiming the victory start claiming that victory amen because we won the recovery amen jesus said that everything is fulfilled amen jesus [Music] amen he will hear our prayers he will forgive our sins and he will heal us amen if you can ask him he may just have faith i don't doubt amen the prophet says the the the the the states amen was against him amen where they were united for praying amen the state wanted to build the race court the the son the the sound they wanted to build the states wanted to build the race court like a place where people would be racing amen but that was the the place where they were praying where they were gathering amen these people women didn't just look away and go we find another place for that for something they started asking god for the victory because they were in one accord because all of them were praying for one thing amen hey man there is a video on youtube you can go watch it youtube values amen there is a man who came one night hey man he was sick even i believe the doctor gave him a week to leave the people in the church started praying for him amen the pastor wasn't there the personality man they didn't have any ministers present amen by just the believers amen they started praying for that brother amen that the doctor said that he only had one week to leave he couldn't breathe on his own amen but they got together this is so awesome amen there was there wasn't one accord they started praying amen and god hurt their prayers amen and that brother was healed amen because we serve a living god amen who hears our prayers if we can come in one accord and ask god for one thing and god will give us amen if we ask god for one thing amen amen we forgot if we ask that for something god will give it to us because god doesn't like divisions amen god doesn't like divisions god wants us to be one man as a family what he says he is the head and we are the body in the song amen one body also called and when the part of the body is hurt it's the entire body that's hurt amen when the church member is hurt amen is the entire church that's hurt amen when one member is sick amen the entire church is supposed to feel that pain [Music] amen the entire church has to be praying for that person which has to be a man has to be on their knees and crying and praying so that god can heal their brother or sister amen if there is a need in the church amen he needs to be a duty of the church amen before because we call ourselves a family we call ourselves family of god amen we have to behave like a family of god amen when one one member is hurt lost the entire church that's hurt amen the entire church will come amen in one accord amen praying amen until god gives until god give an answer man the prophet had his friend the prophet his name was same all the same whole brother same heart same hole amen i'm sorry his name was hall his last name i don't know his first name and he had a you had a cancer he had a cancer of the liver and when he came and did they call the prophet and and and to pray so the prophet was praying but he couldn't hear anything from god so the prophet told his wife and and the wife of that sick brother well let me go talk to my doctor and see uh what what what he's going to say so the prophet went to tell his doctor whose name was him and his doctor said telling him that brother and if we do so that person will not leave so brother branham just go because because that brother was a preacher it comes amen they told brother branham to go and to prepare him for his death he says that i know that my friend is ready to die hey man god can call him at any time he's ready to go the prophet says that but i don't want to see him go amen i love him so much that i don't want to see him go amen amen so i'm going to go and pray god amen it was the memory of the body of christ amen that body was hurt and so the prophet could feel it he said that i'm not ready to see him god amen these are the kind of christians that we need today who can stand up for their brothers who can stand up for their sisters hey man when sickness come in their ways so much amen and god will hear your prayers amen because that he says that the fervent prayer of the righteous man is just lay and hold my promise and nurse and nurse your strength for me that's what that's what it is to every believer amen to every believer that will take god's it's like the baby laying on there on their mother's bosom i mean all the time it's nursing it's satisfied when a real christian can get up can get a hold of the promise of god he's just satisfied did he satisfy oh i love that i love that satisfied the satisfaction of knowing that god said so satisfaction amen your satisfaction will come to satisfaction amen because it brings satisfaction that satisfaction amen and i am gonna walk as a victorious man with my victory amen i'm gonna let the world know that i have the victory amen that god heard my to make you doubt god still felt duty to dream and when he says that you are not here amen go proclaim your healing when he says that you're not saved start thanking god for your salvation you if these people here in these wheelchairs and on this cart and you that's sick to die if and there comes a procession of the holy spirit in your heart saying it's the truth something begins to pose in your bosom that is the truth you're coming out of there how yet make ready for it's going to come as long as that possession begins to rise in your bosom absolutely in your heart where god sits on the on the control tower and then he started buying those little things aiming socks and toys and all these things he meant to make ready because he was receiving a son after 20 years abraham was looking at the unseen abraham forgot to even he knew that the sun was coming one day the sun will come we knew that one day i will have the baby in my hands so i'm gonna go and buy these things so i'm going to go to create that atmosphere to make ready for the promise of god amen you have to start making things ready when you ask [Music] when he was in prison he had to break down amen uh uh he started doubting about this about his calling i started doubting about jesus he sent his disciple to go ask him if he's truly if he truly is the one you know amen jesus didn't tell the disciple the experience that he had yesterday jesus didn't tell them things that he did that morning before they showed up remember jesus told them to wait and see jesus amen they will seal with their own eyes why did not possibly man what's gonna happen amen he didn't give them yesterday's experiences amen no it's good amen but jesus wanted to give them a fresh food and preaching the same word the same gospel amen we ought to have the same result we have to see the same thing amen because jesus himself said amen the works that i do you shall do it also amen even greater works than this you shall do amen if we are preaching the same gospel if we are preaching the same god the same true and living god amen we have to see the same results amen where is that god who wants healed people we should you can be forgiven amen where is that god the ones open the eyes of the blind man who is the jew can be mean for over this reason amen where is that god who wants amen amen amen heal the laborers says though what we need is not a psychology move so don't worry where is that god that takes the sinner's heart and washes it white white white and snow white is snow where's your duty who takes a prostitute from the street and and makes a lady out of it a man who takes a drinker uh out of the other the ballroom and and out yonder and make a preacher out of him and where is that god that can move out and take and take them crippled legs and straighten them out deaf ears to hear make that cancer vanish away amen where is that god that did that one time before amen where is that god amen that god is still alive amen that god is still is there to do it amen that god is still there amen he said that if you call out if you call on my name amen and i [Music] he was just transferring that power that he had to the bride amen he was giving the bride that power and he was giving the bride that authority that's why he had to die first amen to give us the holy spirit wounds are called the sentence of the holy spirit in us amen we'll do this greater works where is that god amen people have been wandering amen where is that god amen because the church has gotten cold amen because the church has gotten busy doing something else one spirit on his feet and one god amen we have to forsake our differences amen brother you believe in this and i believe in this my belief goes against you oh my favorite i don't see i don't see the word as as you see it amen that's all right amen we don't have to see it the same way amen but by not seeing the same way it doesn't mean that we are enemies we have to come together amen instead of instead of each one of us go to a separate way but we have to come and that revelation is given by god himself together amen it's a time where the bride has to be in one accord you have one language you have one speech you're meant to have one objective that's the family that god wants us to see me that's the church that god wants us to be amen one church amen where we will be filling each other's pains will know how to pray amen because for really praying for someone amen you have to feel what is failing you have to take you have to put yourself in his in his shoes i mean you have to feel you have to be like him we don't use the gift of god for commercial for commercials no no no he could tell me where he was at where he was it ibra but i don't have any need of it only i wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him no remember if you had a need of it if i had a need of it i believe if i'd ask him he would tell me but first you see your motives and objectives has to be right objective correct you have to have reasons for this god don't give god god don't give you uh those things just because you asked it and you cannot ask in faith unless there is a real objective to that even foreign see if you want to be well simple believe something what do you want to be well for what do you want to do with your life when you get here see there's got to be i mean you've got to have a motive and objective and they and they have to be right according to the will of god and then is when the faith is revealed to you and god by his sovereign grace places their faith in there then it's over you see amen you have to have a good motive do you have a humble motive you have to have a good objective and then the faith will be revealed to you amen because faith is a revelation you mean it's something that is revealed to you by god himself amen when you ask god for something amen you have to know what are you gonna do with it once you have it what your life will be when you have a man says that before you receive the holy spirit there is three things you have to know what is the holy spirit sentence please what does the holy spirit do amen what does this do when it comes to you just gonna send those are the three things these only questions amen you have to have a good motive and a good objective and when you ask god for something amen that's why james in his first chapter said we don't ask by envy amen but we asked by faith amen you can only ask by faith when you have a good um when you have good motive and good with good object uh objectives so whatever you're asking god this afternoon or this morning what are the motives behind it what are you going to do after you receive it how will your life be after you receive it amen if there are good motives amen that that when the that's when the faith of god will be revealed amen abraham wanted the son amen because he wanted to keep what god he wanted he got because god promised him his son julia amen because he wanted he wanted to keep the word that he promised him because he knew that through his lineage welcomed jesus amen every time you ask god for something you have to have a good motive and god will tell you juvederm why i mean and if god doesn't give it to you amen one day he will show you why he didn't give it to you remember when you ask god for something let's give them you have to ask by faith amen when do you ask by faith you don't ask questions [Music] gave him a son though you had to wait for 25 years amen but that promise to christ amen for abraham it was like god has given him a son 25 years ago amen though he didn't see the sun but not even one time abraham doubted what god said and when you have to have faith do you have all of one amen you have to have faith when you ask god and when we are all together we come together as a church living on some communities in one accord amen i was praying this last week i was coming to church and praying amen that's when god gave me this word amen more likely it was because of uh brother um orville is amen to come for affair to come as a family and god will hear our prayers it doesn't matter how difficult or impossible that situation look like amen because it says that a fervent prayer of one righteous man and how many of us are here in this room and then you multiply it by the number of people in this room objective the healing of our brother god we certainly hear our prayers we certainly heal our brothers amen and give us a song as we stand and sing this song as a song of meditation meditation amen to get us in the spirit of the prayer of the the spirit of prayers amen after hearing this sermon amen we saw how you know examples in the bible how when people were together amen nothing could stand against him you see when god told gideon to go look for an army gideon went and it took whoever he thought of to come and join him [Music] amen but god wanted him to have an army that was united [Music] god wanted him to have an army that had one purpose and one objective which was to win [Music] [Music] together it doesn't matter how small they were they were important but because they were united they come visited because they were in one accord commission because they had one objective objective god gave them the victory the state was against them amen but because they were together [Music] were in one accord [Music] amen they started praying and god gave them the holy spirit amen in the bible the god himself says that if [Music] you see two people on earth can agree in one thing and acts one thing to god eat monday god will give it to them if two people can do that what [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen if you are sincere situation if you are honest situation if you are sincere situation nothing will stand in
