[23:12] i see some growing in our midst and
[23:16] friends and loved ones we appreciate you
[23:18] we're still here
[23:20] and we intend to keep fighting till
[23:22] jesus come and it'll be a fight
[23:25] and so we're just real happy to be with
[23:27] you we've been traveling
[23:28] uh full blast just trying to do
[23:30] something for the lord you know
[23:32] but we're really happy to be with you
[23:34] here tonight and appreciate brother
[23:36] brooks having us you know you're all
[23:38] home away from home
[23:39] and i just feel like i'm among friends
[23:41] and loved ones and we appreciate you
[23:43] very much
[23:44] so let's let's turn our attention to the
[23:46] scriptures
[23:47] if we can turn in the bible we had a
[23:50] wonderful service this morning
[23:52] and uh they didn't leave me a whole lot
[23:54] of voice left but
[23:56] they gave a peace offering they drove me
[23:58] here so
[24:00] i'm just uh really happy to be here with
[24:02] you more than words can say
[24:04] and
[24:05] i'm going to do my best here i just you
[24:07] know as you try to find the mind of the
[24:09] lord and i just feel i feel to tackle
[24:12] the scripture
[24:14] and so let's just uh approach it
[24:16] together
[24:17] in matthew chapter 11
[24:19] and uh we'll start with verse one and i
[24:22] can use as much as you can give me
[24:24] uh
[24:26] monitors and amends so
[24:29] matthew chapter 11
[24:31] and i ask that you just pay very close
[24:33] attention just if you will just don't
[24:35] let your your mind divert
[24:38] stay right with the thought and i think
[24:39] you'll see
[24:41] uh if you pay close attention we'll walk
[24:43] right down into it i think you'll see it
[24:45] clearly matthew chapter 11
[24:48] verse 1
[24:49] and it came to pass
[24:51] when jesus made an end of commanding his
[24:54] 12 disciples he departed thence to teach
[24:57] and preach in their cities
[24:59] and when john had heard in prison the
[25:01] works of christ he sent two of his
[25:04] disciples
[25:05] and he said unto him art thou he that
[25:09] should come
[25:10] or shall we look for another
[25:12] and jesus answered and said unto them
[25:15] go and show john again those things
[25:17] which you hear and see
[25:20] the blind receive their sight
[25:22] the lame walk the lepers are cleansed
[25:25] the death here the dead are raised up
[25:28] and the poor have the gospel preached to
[25:30] them
[25:31] and blessed is he
[25:33] whosoever shall not
[25:35] be offended
[25:36] in me
[25:38] i want to preach tonight
[25:41] on uh the misplaced blessing
[25:44] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[25:48] if we could just pray heavenly father
[25:51] we love you with all of our hearts and
[25:54] god we're christians we're not ashamed
[25:57] of that
[25:58] but we could not do it without you
[26:02] and so lord when we come into the house
[26:04] of god we don't stand in our own
[26:05] strength but we're dependent upon you
[26:08] we ask that you empower us tonight
[26:11] lift us up lord into your presence speak
[26:13] to us things that will establish us
[26:15] strengthen us settle us in the precious
[26:18] faith of jesus christ we love you we
[26:20] commit ourselves to you now
[26:22] in jesus christ's name we pray
[26:25] amen god bless you can have your seeds
[26:30] john the baptist
[26:31] was trained for thank you brother rich
[26:34] was trained for 30 years
[26:36] just for six months work
[26:39] that's astounding to me
[26:41] that that god would just
[26:43] the greatest man born of a woman outside
[26:46] of jesus christ that god would invest so
[26:48] much into him
[26:50] just for six months work and that's all
[26:52] god needed but he fulfilled god's
[26:54] purpose
[26:56] and you know god's ways are not our ways
[26:58] we often think you know that we could
[27:00] maybe do a great work for god and it's
[27:03] totally contrary to what god would want
[27:05] from us at all
[27:07] and none of us would know that he was
[27:08] the greatest man born of a woman except
[27:11] jesus told us we would never know the
[27:13] way god views things are very different
[27:16] than the way we understand it and then
[27:18] god would train jesus christ himself 30
[27:21] years just for three years work
[27:24] and so it's all about quality
[27:27] not quantity it's all about quality say
[27:30] lord make me a quality christian that's
[27:32] all i want to be i don't want to be
[27:34] anything great but i want to be a real
[27:35] christian
[27:37] and you know john the baptist daddy died
[27:40] when he was 9 years old that's what the
[27:41] prophet of god tells us
[27:43] and that that god began training john
[27:46] out in the wilderness he said his job
[27:49] was to introduce the messiah and he said
[27:52] his job was too great to be trained in
[27:54] the schools like his daddy he said but
[27:57] god had to have him one-on-one and
[27:59] that's where the prophets are trained on
[28:01] the backsides of the desert on the
[28:03] potter's wheel where god can mold
[28:05] uncompromising spirit
[28:08] god can mold uh eagle eyes and and
[28:11] understanding of god you can't get that
[28:13] in a school it only comes by the spirit
[28:16] and bill branham said that his job was
[28:19] too important to go to school
[28:21] but his job he said he had to be formed
[28:24] of god and god began to train him to
[28:26] watch for a sign six months work his job
[28:29] was short but very important and he had
[28:32] to be positive
[28:34] and brother venom said so do we got to
[28:36] be positive
[28:37] i believe in knowing what we believe
[28:40] it's not good enough that the pastor
[28:42] knows that her your daddy knows it but
[28:44] we got to know whom we have believed if
[28:47] you're the last one standing you've got
[28:48] to be positive so you can stand in the
[28:51] face of the devil yourself and say i
[28:54] know whom i have believed and i know
[28:56] what this message is
[28:58] and then when the shaking comes and it
[29:00] will come you'll be able to stand on
[29:02] your own testimony
[29:04] how many can say give me strength lord
[29:06] make me positive we must be positive and
[29:10] john had to be positive
[29:13] he had to know
[29:15] because there was going to be trials
[29:17] coming up his way
[29:18] he was to introduce the messiah it was a
[29:21] big job and there was no doubt many
[29:24] false prophets uh competing with jesus
[29:28] that they were the real one
[29:31] so the entire
[29:32] ministry of john the baptist was
[29:34] contained in two scriptures
[29:37] in isaiah and in malachi but yet he was
[29:39] the greatest
[29:41] and when he stomped out and came to his
[29:43] public ministry he shook the whole
[29:45] region like an earthquake like a
[29:47] spiritual earthquake he just began to
[29:50] shake the whole place
[29:52] john was preparing the way
[29:54] in other words something was coming
[29:56] behind him
[29:59] let me tell you there is something
[30:01] coming behind this message
[30:03] god that his wife has prepared herself
[30:05] and made herself ready
[30:07] john was preaching repentance and
[30:09] proclaiming
[30:11] uh that the messiah was coming
[30:13] and john was the messenger of the
[30:15] covenant he was standing between
[30:18] dispensations
[30:19] and he was introducing a new lamb and a
[30:23] new age and a new covenant
[30:26] it was all together new they were
[30:28] entering into a new frontier
[30:30] reminds me of what the lord told joshua
[30:32] you've not gone this way before
[30:35] there's something about god there's
[30:36] always something new let's not settle
[30:39] for yesterday but let's look for
[30:41] something new
[30:43] when i say that god ain't sending
[30:44] another message but it's just a fresh
[30:47] experience of the message that he has
[30:49] given us
[30:50] john was the great eagle he flew down
[30:53] right onto the banks of the jordan and
[30:55] he put his wings out
[30:58] and then he began to introduce the
[30:59] messiah i love the way god does things
[31:02] he's in he's in just skins don't look
[31:05] like nothing
[31:06] probably spit more than i did
[31:08] might even missed a tooth or something
[31:11] popping locusts and wild honey tell him
[31:14] to repent or perish you can imagine what
[31:16] an offense that was to a trained
[31:18] theologian
[31:19] that this man popping locust is telling
[31:22] me i'm a snake in the grass
[31:24] and he's telling him get to going
[31:26] serpents in there i mean they were
[31:28] moving in all directions
[31:30] stomping and snakes are flying laying
[31:32] the axe to the root of the tree i like
[31:34] the way god does it he had molded an
[31:38] uncompromising spirit
[31:40] and i believe that god is sent a message
[31:43] to make us uncompromising in the word as
[31:45] well he didn't pull any punches he just
[31:49] brother venom said he let the chips fall
[31:51] where they were
[31:52] and he said he just preached it raw with
[31:55] no gloves he just preached it spoke it
[31:58] out
[31:59] and i like that
[32:01] brother branham said one day he preached
[32:03] to one that got very offended
[32:05] bear with me stay with me with my
[32:07] thought
[32:08] and he said that
[32:10] that a fellow comma said now
[32:12] uh
[32:13] what was it was it herod that was out in
[32:15] the audience with his brother's wife
[32:17] and he said now listen don't say
[32:19] anything we've got the governor in the
[32:21] audience today
[32:23] and he said john actually ran out and
[32:25] stuck his finger right in his face and
[32:27] said it ain't lawful for you to have her
[32:31] and that got him in trouble
[32:33] brother branham said god give us men
[32:35] like that
[32:37] we ain't looking for our own kingdom but
[32:39] we're looking for the kingdom of god
[32:42] john was cast into into a damp jail
[32:46] this is where i want to start building
[32:48] brother branham said it must have been a
[32:50] horrible experience
[32:52] for a man that was accustomed to being
[32:54] free
[32:55] for a man that god is comfort from god
[32:58] out in the wilderness would feel the sun
[33:01] shine upon his face and feel the
[33:03] presence of god out there
[33:06] for them to put him in a damp dungeon
[33:09] where it's cold and he said just getting
[33:11] moldy bread and and he said he was
[33:13] losing weight there was no bible to read
[33:16] and he said for his comfort and he said
[33:18] it was there
[33:20] in those days
[33:22] and those days turned to weeks or those
[33:24] weeks might have turned to months his
[33:26] eagle eye
[33:27] began to film over
[33:29] brother branham said john the baptist
[33:31] had a nervous breakdown
[33:34] and then he become confused this is very
[33:36] odd this the scripture that john was
[33:40] sending someone to jesus to say are you
[33:42] him or do we look for another after he
[33:45] already identified him
[33:47] as the lamb of god how did that happen
[33:50] he knew the sign he was trained by god
[33:53] to see the sign
[33:55] and brother branham said john listen
[33:57] closely john was prophesying as he was
[34:01] anointed by the power of the holy spirit
[34:04] and he said the messiah is coming his
[34:07] fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly
[34:09] purge his floor
[34:11] and he said the spirit of god was just
[34:13] prophesying out of john
[34:16] and he said but when jesus came he was
[34:18] not a conqueror
[34:20] he was meek
[34:21] he was lowly
[34:23] he was pushed around
[34:25] i wanted to read this to you he said
[34:27] john became offended
[34:31] john became offended because things did
[34:34] not go the way that john thought it
[34:37] should go
[34:38] i'm quoting now
[34:40] brother branham said because he had
[34:41] introduced jesus the messiah whose fan
[34:44] was in his hand that would purge the
[34:46] floor he couldn't hardly understand he
[34:49] was let down
[34:51] and he was offended
[34:53] see
[34:54] the sign was unmistakable
[34:57] he said when you see
[34:59] the spirit of god like a dove brother
[35:01] branham said like a pillar of fire
[35:03] coming down on him he said and remaining
[35:06] that is the messiah
[35:08] he was trained to see it
[35:10] but brother branham said his eagle eye
[35:12] filmed over down in those conditions
[35:15] and he said john
[35:17] thought his fan was listen he thought
[35:20] his plan was in his hand that the
[35:22] millennium millennium would start right
[35:25] then
[35:26] that the grain was already ready and
[35:28] that he was gathering his wheat into the
[35:31] garner but that was not that coming he
[35:34] was seeing the second coming and when it
[35:38] did not look like he thought it should
[35:41] he became offended
[35:45] he was prophesying of the grain
[35:48] he was prophesying of this day
[35:52] brother branham says it direct quote
[35:54] modern events made clear by prophecy he
[35:56] said the grain is here the bride he said
[35:59] he'll burn it with unquenchable fire the
[36:01] stalk he said seek salvation while you
[36:04] can he said because the life is in the
[36:07] grain
[36:08] cast away the theology the life is in
[36:12] the grain this is the gathering time the
[36:15] combine time
[36:17] and john this is what john was looking
[36:20] for
[36:20] right now
[36:23] so john his eagle eyes film over
[36:26] and he sends his disciples and said
[36:29] are you here we sh
[36:31] should we look for another
[36:34] and jesus
[36:36] jesus said just wait till this evening
[36:38] tell me what you see
[36:40] go tell john what you see just wait to
[36:43] the meeting
[36:45] and so
[36:46] as they were watching they were studying
[36:48] very closely
[36:50] and they were seeing the eyes of the
[36:51] blind open
[36:53] they were seeing the lame leap like a
[36:55] heart they were seeing the power of god
[36:57] on display that they had not seen in
[36:59] that in that time of dispensation
[37:03] and then brother branham says this
[37:05] i imagine those disciples of john was
[37:08] watching every move
[37:10] of course john had taught them what the
[37:12] messiah was
[37:13] and they began to see what was taken
[37:15] place
[37:17] and then after the service those two
[37:18] disciples went back to john
[37:21] that the blind see the lame walk and
[37:23] told them all about the meeting
[37:26] and the poor's got the gospel preached
[37:28] to him
[37:29] you tell john
[37:30] don't be scared
[37:32] don't think anything different
[37:35] i'm right on schedule
[37:37] everything is running right
[37:39] i'm right on schedule don't pay
[37:41] attention to anything else
[37:44] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[37:47] don't be offended john he misplaced the
[37:51] beatitude no matter what takes place
[37:54] stay with the message stay with the word
[37:58] i know it don't look right
[38:00] but don't be offended john
[38:02] turn with me if you will to matthew
[38:04] chapter 5 verse 2.
[38:08] matthew chapter 5
[38:11] verse 2 and we'll read down through
[38:12] verse 12.
[38:14] everybody love the lord
[38:17] and he opened his mouth
[38:19] and he taught them saying blessed are
[38:21] the poor in spirit for theirs is the
[38:23] kingdom of heaven
[38:25] blessed are they that mourn for they
[38:27] shall be comforted blessed are the meek
[38:30] for they shall inherit the earth
[38:33] blessed are they that do hunger and
[38:34] thirst after righteousness for they
[38:36] shall be filled
[38:38] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[38:40] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[38:42] heart for they shall see god blessed are
[38:44] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[38:45] the children of god blessed are they
[38:47] that are persecuted for righteousness
[38:49] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[38:51] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[38:54] persecute you say all manner of evil
[38:56] against you falsely for my name's sake
[38:58] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[39:00] great is your reward in heaven for so
[39:02] persecuted they the prophets that were
[39:04] before you now go to chapter 11 verse 6.
[39:12] and blessed is he
[39:15] whosoever shall not be offended
[39:17] in me
[39:19] brother branham calls this the forgotten
[39:21] beatitude or the misplaced blessing
[39:25] and he placed this in a very particular
[39:28] place
[39:29] that word offend blessed is he that is
[39:31] not offended in me means stumbled
[39:35] blessed is he that has not stumbled or
[39:38] caused to fall away
[39:40] who you love the lord
[39:44] and so brother branham said he never
[39:46] condemned him jesus never condemned him
[39:48] he had the spirit of elijah he knew he
[39:51] did
[39:52] he knowed everything was running right
[39:55] everything was according to the schedule
[39:57] john introduced him god presented him
[40:00] and so will it be at the end time
[40:03] everything is on schedule
[40:06] don't be offended believe on him
[40:09] churches are offended people are
[40:11] offended but don't be offended he's
[40:13] right on schedule don't be scared
[40:18] are you ready
[40:19] don't be offended in god's way
[40:25] the way that he fulfills his word
[40:28] don't be offended when god the way he
[40:31] brings his word to pass
[40:34] don't be offended by the way god answers
[40:37] your prayers
[40:40] are you with me don't be offended at god
[40:43] because that attitude will take you off
[40:45] course and your ego eyes will film over
[40:48] but keep your heart centered on god's
[40:51] word no matter the way you interpret it
[40:54] lord how believe it
[40:58] don't ever be offended
[41:00] at god's word don't lean to your own
[41:02] understanding
[41:06] bible tells us in revelations
[41:08] i know
[41:10] thy tribulations and thy poverty
[41:13] i know and brother branham said isn't
[41:16] this amazing that god would know that
[41:18] god knows about it and he said but does
[41:21] he stem the tribulation no
[41:23] he said does he does
[41:25] he says i know it i'm not unmindful what
[41:28] a stumbling block this is
[41:30] to many people
[41:32] see many think that love means no
[41:34] suffering
[41:35] they thought that love meant baby
[41:38] parental care that that was god's love
[41:40] but god's love is elective love
[41:44] the proof of his election
[41:46] no matter what happens
[41:49] is his love is proven by the fact that
[41:51] he chose us to salvation
[41:53] and because god chose you to salvation
[41:56] and sanctification of the spirit and
[41:58] belief of the truth he may commit you to
[42:00] death as paul
[42:01] he may commit you to suffering like job
[42:03] that's god's prerogative but it's all
[42:06] with a purpose
[42:09] and we are not immune from troubles
[42:12] because we are believers does not mean
[42:15] we are immune from troubles
[42:18] you think oh christian everything runs
[42:20] perfect no it doesn't
[42:23] no actually it we have more troubles as
[42:26] christians
[42:29] but you know brother branham said god
[42:31] promises god promised many afflictions
[42:35] strange feelings
[42:36] strange things beyond our understanding
[42:39] but it's always done for the good
[42:45] you trust him
[42:46] he said just can't understand it because
[42:49] if we did it wouldn't be faith
[42:52] he said but we do it we have it we
[42:55] believe it by faith god's word it's
[42:57] going to work for the good
[43:00] none of us are immune from those things
[43:02] we realize that but it's for our good
[43:05] and the trial of our
[43:07] our faith is more precious than gold
[43:11] job job said
[43:12] when he hath tried me
[43:14] i will come forth as gold
[43:17] we hate the trying
[43:19] but i want you to think about the
[43:21] shining
[43:23] you know it's just like the man that
[43:24] challenged brother branham brother
[43:26] branham was talking about the first the
[43:28] early church fathers in the book of acts
[43:30] they sold all that they had
[43:32] and laid it at the apostles feet and he
[43:34] said worst mistake this was a prosperity
[43:36] preacher worst mistake that they ever
[43:38] could have done he said they had no
[43:40] homes to go to brother branham said the
[43:42] holy spirit did not make a mistake
[43:44] he said they were in a perfect position
[43:46] to spread the gospel all over the world
[43:49] he said god don't make a mistake see but
[43:52] listen god knows what he's doing
[43:55] but many get offended in god's way
[43:59] because god's way will never add up like
[44:02] we think it should add up
[44:03] and many of us judge god
[44:06] because it don't add up to our peanut
[44:08] brain thinking
[44:11] can you imagine you know i was telling
[44:13] the the church this morning in iowa city
[44:16] i said john the you know john
[44:19] when he or paul rather you know paul was
[44:22] establishing churches and the devil was
[44:24] a matter of hornet
[44:26] and so you know he said i'm going to
[44:27] throw i'm going to throw paul into
[44:29] prison you think here's a man a light to
[44:32] the gentiles yeah i mean he was faithful
[44:35] whipped and stoned and rejected but you
[44:38] know when they threw him in there
[44:39] all he did was write the new testament
[44:43] aren't you glad
[44:45] that paul was thrown in prison
[44:47] we still get comfort out of those
[44:49] scriptures
[44:50] same with john they bowled him in oil as
[44:52] a witch they thought he had a devil they
[44:55] couldn't boil him god preserved him put
[44:57] him on patmos why
[44:59] god had to get him alone he was
[45:01] traveling too much testifying too much
[45:04] i've got a message for an end-time
[45:06] people
[45:10] you think this is why am i an alcatraz
[45:12] i'm in snakes and lizards and i hate
[45:15] snakes
[45:16] this is a place where i can get you
[45:18] quiet
[45:19] nobody's going to bother you
[45:21] nobody's going to bother you
[45:23] me and you john
[45:26] john out there them snakes crying he
[45:28] didn't notice the snakes when the
[45:30] presence of god came down and he broke
[45:32] into a vision and began to write
[45:35] god help us not to notice our trials but
[45:38] keep our eyes upon the goal
[45:40] hallelujah
[45:42] do you love the lord
[45:43] but don't be offended in the way that
[45:46] god brings it to pass
[45:49] god don't know us anything
[45:52] we know that all things say all things
[45:55] all things work for the good
[45:58] to them that love god and are called
[46:00] according to his purpose
[46:02] he works in mysterious ways
[46:05] many times he gives us a lash of
[46:07] correction
[46:08] and we wonder how could it be working
[46:11] for the good but after it's all over we
[46:13] praise god and we know that it did work
[46:16] for the good
[46:17] he said just be obedient to the word
[46:20] be obedient to the chastening
[46:23] he never would chasten us unless we
[46:25] needed it
[46:26] maybe we are not
[46:28] he said but we know it will all work out
[46:32] for the good
[46:33] just lay your life in his hands and say
[46:36] here i am lord just use me guide me
[46:39] direct me i want to be pleasing to thee
[46:43] and don't murmur
[46:45] no matter what path stay with it anyhow
[46:48] and god will work it out for the good
[46:51] because the footsteps of the righteous
[46:53] are ordered of the lord blessed is he
[46:56] that is not offended in me
[46:59] lord i don't want to be offended
[47:02] when trials come my way i don't want to
[47:04] be offended
[47:05] when i'm rejected and misunderstood i
[47:07] don't want to be offended
[47:09] i believe that all things say all things
[47:12] all things work for the good
[47:15] to them that love him just make sure you
[47:18] love him
[47:19] many people hate him in the trial
[47:21] because they're offended i'm not going
[47:23] to be offended i'm going to love him in
[47:26] my trials
[47:27] then it'll work for my good
[47:29] i mean say lord change my attitude
[47:32] god permits trials to come
[47:35] he brings tension into the church i know
[47:38] brother brooks hated to hear that one he
[47:40] brings tensions into the church for
[47:43] every son must be tried and proven and
[47:46] tested he lets sickness strike you he
[47:49] lets diseases come on you he tests you
[47:52] to show the world that you are a seat of
[47:56] abraham
[47:58] he permits disasters
[48:00] he permits his friends to turn against
[48:03] you he permits the devil to turn loose
[48:06] and tempt you but not take your life
[48:09] he can throw you on a bed of affliction
[48:11] he can turn your neighbors again so he
[48:13] can turn your church against you he can
[48:15] do almost anything and it's god's will
[48:17] for him to do it
[48:19] and it's more precious than gold
[48:24] glory
[48:26] our trials are more precious than gold
[48:31] brother branham said your trials are
[48:33] jewels
[48:36] more precious than gold
[48:38] when you go through a temptation hold
[48:40] your ground
[48:43] stay right where you are till god says
[48:45] it
[48:46] don't shake it every wind
[48:48] stay right there
[48:50] and even if you're a little out of the
[48:51] way
[48:52] if your heart is really sincere stand
[48:54] firm and god will respect it
[48:57] ain't that wonderful
[48:59] god is only testing an action
[49:02] and a reaction
[49:04] god wants to see faith
[49:07] is not offended
[49:11] brother branham said there was a boy
[49:13] that a catholic boy was praying for his
[49:15] mama she was sick and he said lord heal
[49:17] my mom and he was reading that prayer
[49:18] book well when she died he grabbed the
[49:20] prayer book and threw it in the fire
[49:22] brother branham said his attitude was
[49:23] wrong to begin with he should never ask
[49:26] to change god's mind but ask god change
[49:28] my mind to fit your will
[49:31] you know brother branham told the story
[49:33] of a of a shepherd he was walking in the
[49:35] east and he had a little lamb beautiful
[49:37] little lamb with a little broken leg and
[49:40] they oh it's a beautiful little lamb he
[49:42] said yes it is and they said uh it must
[49:45] have broke its leg out in the wilderness
[49:47] he said no he said i broke it
[49:49] they said what a cruel shepherd you are
[49:52] he said no you don't understand he said
[49:55] he kept wandering away from me but i
[49:57] wanted to show him a little love i
[49:59] wanted to bond with him i wanted to show
[50:01] him how much i cared i broke his leg so
[50:04] i pack him around everywhere i go he can
[50:07] never be away from me but he's right
[50:09] with me he's right with me in prayer
[50:12] he's right with me in service he's right
[50:15] with me every step of the way
[50:18] god knows how to get our attention
[50:21] it's a fact that that the church
[50:23] flourishes under pressure
[50:26] the pressure must be
[50:28] but blessed are they that are not
[50:29] offended in me
[50:31] don't doubt him believe it's working for
[50:34] your good
[50:36] we got trials don't murmur don't be
[50:39] negative
[50:40] you believe god i know i'm a child of
[50:44] the king
[50:45] i know this is working for my good use
[50:48] the little faith that you got and speak
[50:51] a positive profession and you watched
[50:53] god begin to move
[50:55] did you know brother branham said many
[50:57] of people die a premature death because
[51:00] they don't accept their healing
[51:02] their attitude towards the atonement
[51:05] they die early and it was available
[51:09] it's all about our attitude
[51:14] you know job was the greatest man of the
[51:16] east he was a perfect man one that
[51:18] feared god and shoot evil
[51:20] his children were getting worldly
[51:22] brother branham said it in that in those
[51:24] terms so they had a bunch of children
[51:26] they were getting worldly and job was
[51:29] offering burnt offerings for his family
[51:31] continually
[51:32] and brother branham said the burnt
[51:34] offering was offered before the tragedy
[51:39] he said let's not try to offer burnt
[51:40] offerings in the tragedy he said but he
[51:43] was doing it before
[51:45] getting ready
[51:46] for trials to set in
[51:50] and god permitted satan to afflict him
[51:54] and the devil said can i turn loose on
[51:56] him he said the only reason he loves you
[51:58] is you baby
[52:00] you give him everything that he wants
[52:02] you hedge him in you bless his cattle
[52:04] you bless his barns you bless his family
[52:06] so sick of this round here
[52:10] give him to me and he'll curse at your
[52:12] face he won't amend you in church
[52:15] he'll go to the back nothing wrong with
[52:17] anyone in the back
[52:19] he won't give you an amen
[52:22] he'll hate your guts
[52:25] god said
[52:26] can't do it
[52:28] you can't do it
[52:30] you can't make isaiah brooks curse me
[52:34] you can't make the stranger curse me
[52:38] you can't make them turn their back on
[52:40] me
[52:44] don't you touch his life
[52:47] you turn him loose and you see what kind
[52:49] of faith is burning in their heart
[52:52] here come the test
[52:54] he lost his cattle he lost his asses he
[52:56] lost
[52:57] his children it boils head to foot he
[52:59] must have looked like a monster
[53:01] a miserable sight his wife said cursed
[53:04] god and dying his comforters come and
[53:06] said their sin in your life brother
[53:08] branham said you've got the wrong
[53:10] theology
[53:12] your doctrine is wrong or you wouldn't
[53:14] be going through this whoo that's what
[53:16] brother branham said is his comforters
[53:20] the devil was doing everything he could
[53:23] i want you to hear this quote i built i
[53:25] i built the story of job for this
[53:27] purpose
[53:29] brother branham said he lost everything
[53:31] his children
[53:33] and he said he was being accused of
[53:35] being a secret sinner
[53:37] he knew
[53:38] that he met god's requirements
[53:41] he knew
[53:43] there's no need of satan tempting him he
[53:47] knew it was the devil
[53:49] as long as the devil could make him
[53:51] believe
[53:52] that his sickness was god doing it
[53:55] he was whipped
[53:57] wow
[53:59] if he could convince job this was
[54:01] between the devil and job
[54:03] if he could get job to become offended
[54:07] if he could get job to believe this
[54:10] ain't the devil doing it it's god doing
[54:12] it
[54:14] he'd lost the battle
[54:16] he lost his position in christ
[54:19] he was the only going through the trials
[54:22] to make him something
[54:24] it wasn't god doing it
[54:26] it was satan doing it
[54:28] and he'll try to tell you those trials
[54:30] is god putting putting punishment on you
[54:33] and it's god permitting it to temper you
[54:36] to see if you're tied to the earth
[54:39] with earthly cares and earthly treasures
[54:41] to see where your treasure is
[54:46] and job
[54:48] was a prophet
[54:50] and brother branham revealed
[54:52] how job stood against so much temptation
[54:57] brother branham said the secret was his
[55:00] burnt sacrifice
[55:01] i don't understand this i don't know why
[55:05] but i have come god's provided way
[55:08] and i'm standing on the blood my
[55:11] confidence is in my sacrifice my
[55:14] confidence is in the word of god
[55:16] he was justified he overcame by the
[55:19] blood of the lamb
[55:21] and the word of his testimony
[55:23] and it worked out for the good
[55:26] because you and i
[55:27] what would the world be without job
[55:31] how many times you've been in trials and
[55:33] drew from his experience
[55:37] and so this horrible affliction upon job
[55:41] was for our good
[55:42] it was for the good of the church it was
[55:45] for the good of the kingdom
[55:46] can you say amen
[55:49] see god sees further down the road than
[55:51] we see
[55:52] we only see here
[55:53] god sees what he's trying to make you he
[55:56] also knows where we would lead ourselves
[55:59] if he didn't intervene
[56:03] many times we think god is angry with us
[56:05] and he's only trying to get fruit
[56:07] blessed is he
[56:09] that is not offended in me
[56:11] just for a moment because you say how
[56:14] does that relate to me i'll tell you
[56:15] exactly how it relates to you
[56:18] you know brother branham said that day
[56:19] at calvary if you get a chance to go
[56:21] back and listen to that message that day
[56:23] at calvary he said he broke
[56:26] satan's backbone
[56:28] he said sin was destroyed that day at
[56:31] calvary he said his last breath was it
[56:34] is finished listen to me closely
[56:37] at that moment everything that adam lost
[56:41] was restored by jesus christ that day at
[56:44] calvary the sin question was settled
[56:47] forever that day at calvary every
[56:51] redemptive blessing that you'll ever
[56:53] receive happened that day at calvary
[56:57] every human being that will ever be
[56:59] saved was saved that day at calvary
[57:04] if you reject it
[57:06] then you will die in your sins but you
[57:08] were healed at calvary you were forgiven
[57:11] at calvary
[57:13] your sins are already forgiven
[57:15] but you must accept it
[57:18] all sinners
[57:20] everything happened at calvary
[57:24] every one of us was saved at calvary
[57:27] now if you do not accept it
[57:29] then you must appear before god as a
[57:31] sinner and be judged
[57:34] calvary included you
[57:36] calvary included me
[57:39] brother madam says this 1964 after the
[57:41] seals every sinner right now is already
[57:45] saved
[57:46] everyone on earth is already saved right
[57:50] now he forgave them at calvary but if
[57:54] they go out not accepting it then they
[57:56] will die a sinner
[57:58] see
[57:59] every sinner is saved right this moment
[58:03] god so loved the world
[58:06] are you ready that is seed and non-seed
[58:13] i know it's shocking
[58:15] that is seed and non-seed every man on
[58:18] earth was saved at calvary
[58:22] remember when he came to cain i was just
[58:24] sharing this with a brother last night
[58:26] when when he came to claim he said if
[58:29] you do what your brother does what do
[58:31] you say i will
[58:33] receive you
[58:34] god was not just talking
[58:37] god would have received him
[58:39] now
[58:39] when
[58:40] abel died his blood cried out against
[58:43] cain his righteousness condemned cain
[58:47] but brother branham said the blood of
[58:49] jesus christ speaketh better things than
[58:52] that of abel
[58:54] and then i'll just read it to you the
[58:55] token
[58:56] he said abel was a righteous man he died
[59:00] innocent because he was in the way
[59:03] standing for the real revelation his
[59:05] blood cried the justice blood of abel
[59:07] cried against cain the blood of jesus
[59:10] not only cried out it redeemed it speaks
[59:13] better things it makes you sons and
[59:16] daughters it hides you from the wrath
[59:19] the blood of abel could not hide cain
[59:21] but the blood of jesus can
[59:25] there is forgiveness
[59:27] for cain
[59:28] if he will receive it
[59:32] by grace are you saved
[59:36] now god knows who will and who won't
[59:39] that's his perspective
[59:42] so we should never get in a mind battle
[59:44] am i elected my seater am i not
[59:47] we all have the same opportunity you
[59:50] want to talk about equal opportunity
[59:52] there's no socialism or communism that
[59:54] can compete with gods
[59:57] it's equal opportunity whosoever will
[1:00:00] let him come
[1:00:02] but god knows by foreknowledge and
[1:00:04] election who will and who won't
[1:00:07] but the door is open
[1:00:09] hell was not made for humans
[1:00:12] hell was made for the devil and his
[1:00:14] angels and brother branham said you got
[1:00:16] to fight your way to get there
[1:00:19] god ain't sitting there like zeus ready
[1:00:21] to just you know blow you into oblivion
[1:00:25] he did everything he could to save you
[1:00:29] i want to show you the grace of god did
[1:00:31] you notice in the prayer lines the
[1:00:33] thousands of discernment not one time
[1:00:35] did the angel of the lord ask him what
[1:00:36] church they went to
[1:00:39] you want to talk about a display of the
[1:00:41] mercy and grace of god men that
[1:00:43] committed adultery were forgiven that
[1:00:46] instant
[1:00:48] people that were in sin i just i just
[1:00:50] heard an incredible testimony that this
[1:00:52] fellow brought a friend
[1:00:55] i just i'll just tell you the first
[1:00:56] testimony he said he went to brother
[1:00:58] branham's meeting this is years ago and
[1:01:01] he said he was watching and there was a
[1:01:02] little girl with legs drawn up like this
[1:01:05] brother branham said little girl do you
[1:01:07] believe and he said surely not surely
[1:01:09] that little girl couldn't get up out of
[1:01:11] that chair her legs were just withered
[1:01:13] and he said
[1:01:14] he said have your daddy lay his hands on
[1:01:16] you and he laid his hands and he prayed
[1:01:18] he said honey come up out of that chair
[1:01:19] and he said her legs straightened out
[1:01:21] like that she come right up out of the
[1:01:22] chair and he said and then the power of
[1:01:25] god fell and brother branham said and
[1:01:27] you're healed and you're healed and
[1:01:28] you're healed and you're healed and he
[1:01:30] said people were coming up out of the
[1:01:32] wheelchairs and he said he was watching
[1:01:34] the power of god and one woman laid
[1:01:36] right there and then other people just
[1:01:39] kept popping up but that woman laid
[1:01:41] there
[1:01:41] and he said he was sitting there
[1:01:42] watching and they took brother branham
[1:01:44] and took him off the stage and he was
[1:01:46] gone
[1:01:47] he said so i worked my way up to that
[1:01:49] woman and he said i i stood over her
[1:01:51] cotton said ma'am did you come here to
[1:01:54] be healed she said yes he said he told
[1:01:56] you you were healed she goes he did he
[1:01:58] goes yeah he said she jumped out of that
[1:02:02] go away
[1:02:04] glory
[1:02:05] he said she was healed and didn't know
[1:02:07] it
[1:02:09] many of us were saved and didn't know it
[1:02:12] glory
[1:02:14] and he said so then he brought his
[1:02:15] friend to a meeting he said he was a
[1:02:17] tough nut to crack
[1:02:18] he said they sat up in the balcony
[1:02:20] brother branham is calling people out
[1:02:22] and he said woman
[1:02:24] you're about ready to commit murder
[1:02:27] you have a gun in your purse and you're
[1:02:29] going up to new york to kill somebody he
[1:02:32] said don't let the devil do that to you
[1:02:35] god will take care of it give that gun
[1:02:37] to that girl next to you and he said his
[1:02:39] friend jumped up and looked off the
[1:02:41] balcony and seen that woman reach in the
[1:02:42] purse and give it to her friend and he
[1:02:45] looked over and said this is the real
[1:02:46] thing
[1:02:47] [Laughter]
[1:02:49] glory
[1:02:51] you love the lord
[1:02:53] see no matter how sinful you are
[1:02:56] this is a demonstration of the grace of
[1:02:59] almighty god
[1:03:01] we complicate it but god has made the
[1:03:04] path clear for us
[1:03:06] hell was made for the devil and his
[1:03:08] angels no matter how sinful you are no
[1:03:11] matter how stooped in sin no matter how
[1:03:14] lost you are he died to save the vile
[1:03:18] sinner there is hope for you there's
[1:03:20] grace for you
[1:03:24] men in their limited minds and narrow
[1:03:26] thinking shut the door of grace when god
[1:03:30] opened it wide and screams from heaven
[1:03:33] continually come
[1:03:35] come
[1:03:38] it's the preachers that don't have a
[1:03:40] revelation of grace
[1:03:43] and i don't mean to discredit preachers
[1:03:45] god sends preachers
[1:03:46] but jesus said it he said you shut up
[1:03:49] the kingdom against men and you don't
[1:03:51] even let them go in
[1:03:55] i just want to preach it loud so you
[1:03:57] understand the grace of god
[1:03:59] and and job
[1:04:01] in what revelation that he had in his
[1:04:04] dispensation stood upon his sacrifice
[1:04:08] it is so vitally important that you do
[1:04:11] not look at you
[1:04:13] you must look at calvary
[1:04:16] if you ever will be saved it'll be
[1:04:18] because of calvary
[1:04:20] if you'll ever do anything for god it'll
[1:04:23] because what he's done for us you're up
[1:04:27] and down up and down and we get tired of
[1:04:30] going in circles we are human beings
[1:04:33] but he did something permanent
[1:04:36] that was for you for you for you for me
[1:04:38] for all of us
[1:04:40] we can all stream amazing grace
[1:04:44] how sweet the sound
[1:04:47] it's your personal faith in christ
[1:04:50] it's just like someone said you know i
[1:04:52] trusted the lord and till the rope broke
[1:04:54] brother bam said oh no
[1:04:56] don't trust him till it breaks that's
[1:04:58] the time to trust him
[1:05:01] if you want god to make a way for you
[1:05:04] then you got to take him at his word
[1:05:08] because god's word will bring forth
[1:05:10] when god speaks it's got to come to pass
[1:05:14] it can't fail do you believe that
[1:05:16] now to wait
[1:05:17] for the prophecy to be fulfilled is
[1:05:19] another thing and we get caught in that
[1:05:22] time
[1:05:23] that's where the problem is john didn't
[1:05:25] understand in a damp cell what was
[1:05:27] happening he could not comprehend it and
[1:05:30] there's a there's a delay there's a time
[1:05:33] where we're waiting
[1:05:34] for the word to be fulfilled
[1:05:36] and we are so selfish because we're in
[1:05:39] okay do it lord you can shut the door
[1:05:41] shut the door lord i'm in
[1:05:43] lord i'm here you can
[1:05:49] yeah but there's a lot like you and i
[1:05:53] that would love the same presence the
[1:05:56] same revelation
[1:05:59] so we got to hold faith until the
[1:06:01] fulfillment
[1:06:04] you love the lord
[1:06:06] we get in such a hurry
[1:06:09] i know i feel like i'm holding you along
[1:06:11] you're a wonderful group to preach to
[1:06:13] you're pulling it out
[1:06:15] so joseph
[1:06:16] i was preaching on joseph this morning
[1:06:19] roped robed in rainbow colors because he
[1:06:22] was
[1:06:23] he represented the holy spirit he had
[1:06:25] the covenant upon him this message has a
[1:06:28] covenant upon it
[1:06:31] and you know that god had already
[1:06:33] prophesied that it the knees would bow
[1:06:35] that all the stalks would bow and all
[1:06:38] the stars and the moon and the sun was
[1:06:40] going everything was going to bow
[1:06:42] so this was said and he knew that those
[1:06:44] were never wrong then everything
[1:06:47] backfires everything looks totally chaos
[1:06:51] his brothers hate him
[1:06:53] and though and don't forget those men
[1:06:55] are
[1:06:56] the 24 elders you're going to shake
[1:06:58] their hand and you're going to think how
[1:06:59] did you sell your brother out
[1:07:02] it's the grace of god that's why we're
[1:07:04] there too
[1:07:06] every one of us have our bad stories
[1:07:08] it's just no one else knows about it but
[1:07:10] the bible told us
[1:07:14] god knows
[1:07:15] but the same grace covered them covers
[1:07:17] us
[1:07:18] and so they sold him dirty rotten
[1:07:21] and i often think of joseph
[1:07:24] because he he was a boy
[1:07:26] i remember when i turned 21 i thought i
[1:07:27] was a man and i went out to
[1:07:30] uh where was it in
[1:07:31] albuquerque new mexico i lasted three
[1:07:34] weeks and came with my tail tucked i was
[1:07:36] so homesick missing mama
[1:07:38] it was awful
[1:07:40] i was having dreams and everything and i
[1:07:42] never dreamed
[1:07:43] and i often thought how homesick joseph
[1:07:46] must have been
[1:07:47] you know to think
[1:07:49] what is daddy thinking they loved each
[1:07:50] other i love my son and you love your
[1:07:53] family you can imagine how that daddy
[1:07:55] felt that the pain was real homesickness
[1:07:58] was real
[1:07:59] and all of this why did my brothers do
[1:08:01] this this rejection is real
[1:08:04] but all things will work for the good
[1:08:07] and so then he goes to potiphar's house
[1:08:09] and immediately god begins blessing him
[1:08:12] and then while he's rising all of a
[1:08:15] sudden the legs get kicked out of it
[1:08:17] with no explanations and now you're
[1:08:20] going to the pit
[1:08:22] and brother branham said how joseph
[1:08:25] suffered
[1:08:27] the bible said the word tried him
[1:08:29] and he's in here in a pit and all of a
[1:08:32] sudden in the pit
[1:08:34] here comes the prosperity
[1:08:36] all of a sudden he finds favor with the
[1:08:38] guard and things just start moving back
[1:08:40] and it's as good as it can be in the pit
[1:08:43] have you ever been there
[1:08:45] lord i don't know
[1:08:47] why i'm in this trial
[1:08:49] but i still see you blessing but i'm in
[1:08:52] this trial i see you lord i catch a
[1:08:54] glimpse i look and you're gone i know
[1:08:57] you're here help me lord i don't
[1:08:59] understand that's exactly where he wants
[1:09:02] you
[1:09:04] he wants you to believe
[1:09:06] he's caught in this nightmare i see god
[1:09:09] i think it was job that said i look and
[1:09:11] he's gone you know where is he hides
[1:09:14] himself
[1:09:16] and in his worst moment while he's in
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:20] he could have been offended
[1:09:23] he could have really been offended
[1:09:25] and it would have turned the tables a
[1:09:27] different direction
[1:09:29] but he maintained his attitude
[1:09:31] he maintained his faith
[1:09:33] and all the sudden here it comes
[1:09:37] god has got to bring the vision to pass
[1:09:42] everything turns around
[1:09:44] and he begins to rise
[1:09:46] and he begins to rise and all of a
[1:09:48] sudden he interprets
[1:09:49] the dream
[1:09:51] and you see it fills the garners of
[1:09:53] egypt i was preaching on it this morning
[1:09:56] the reason god did it he said it to
[1:09:59] preserve a posterity upon the earth
[1:10:02] because that fireman would have killed
[1:10:04] the whole seat of abraham
[1:10:06] but god was looking at the bloodline
[1:10:08] where the messiah would come
[1:10:10] and he raised up joseph for the purpose
[1:10:13] of preserving the bloodline for the
[1:10:15] messiah
[1:10:18] all things work for the good
[1:10:20] to them that are called according to his
[1:10:22] purpose
[1:10:24] is not understood until the time it's to
[1:10:27] be understood
[1:10:28] and all the sudden the light turned on
[1:10:31] he said don't be angry you didn't sell
[1:10:33] me god sold me to preserve life
[1:10:37] and dad he brought dad together
[1:10:40] who what a joy
[1:10:42] what a glory god knows
[1:10:45] this little a light affliction is
[1:10:47] nothing compared to what we're going to
[1:10:49] experience over yonder
[1:10:53] what are you looking at are you looking
[1:10:55] at the trial are you offended or are you
[1:10:57] looking at the promise
[1:10:59] even when the trials are long blessed
[1:11:01] are sea that is not offended in me
[1:11:04] all things are working for your good
[1:11:07] you love the lord
[1:11:10] you know god sometimes sends trouble
[1:11:12] just to jerk us back in line
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:17] am i holding you too long
[1:11:20] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[1:11:23] you know
[1:11:24] god told abraham
[1:11:26] now i'm skipping a lot i just want to go
[1:11:29] into abraham now
[1:11:31] god told abraham i will make you a
[1:11:33] father of nations
[1:11:35] this was the grace of god
[1:11:37] the from the chapter 12 on genesis 12 on
[1:11:42] the entire bible is based off of god's
[1:11:44] promise to abraham the entire bible
[1:11:47] from that time
[1:11:49] and god now
[1:11:50] god makes a promise to abraham
[1:11:54] you're going to have a son
[1:11:56] the bible said that abraham staggered
[1:11:58] not at the promise of god through
[1:12:00] unbelief
[1:12:01] but was strong
[1:12:03] and so it's easy to believe
[1:12:05] when the promise first comes then a year
[1:12:08] went by
[1:12:11] and then sarah said now tell me what he
[1:12:12] said again
[1:12:13] they told me i'm going to have a son she
[1:12:15] had already told her 15 times
[1:12:19] two years later repeat that again
[1:12:22] did you tell me everything yes yes i'm
[1:12:24] gonna gonna have a son
[1:12:25] what else did he take he didn't tell me
[1:12:27] anything else well when are we gonna
[1:12:29] have the son i don't know
[1:12:31] but we're gonna have it
[1:12:33] you just make ready
[1:12:35] then five years goes by
[1:12:37] and 10 years goes by
[1:12:39] then 15 years goes by
[1:12:42] then 20 years goes by
[1:12:44] tell me what he said
[1:12:47] huh
[1:12:48] never mind
[1:12:52] done forgot it
[1:12:56] but god made a promise
[1:13:00] now notice this now 25 years later never
[1:13:03] changed the thing in abraham
[1:13:05] never changed he never staggered he
[1:13:07] believed it just as much how many
[1:13:09] believe this message as much as the day
[1:13:12] that you saw it how wonderful
[1:13:14] because the promise was anchored into
[1:13:17] abraham's heart and abraham actually
[1:13:19] grew stronger and stronger
[1:13:23] 25 years passed and i i want to read
[1:13:25] this quote this is incredible to me
[1:13:28] brother branham said all the sudden the
[1:13:30] herdsmen started feuding
[1:13:32] complaints were coming in
[1:13:35] the cattle was becoming very thin and
[1:13:37] the water supply was getting very low
[1:13:41] and he said you know it's always the
[1:13:42] darkest before day
[1:13:44] you watch a pattern you study that it's
[1:13:47] always the same
[1:13:48] always the darkest and then god comes on
[1:13:50] the scene
[1:13:52] he said he's now notice satan was trying
[1:13:55] to tempt them
[1:13:57] to make them feel they were doing
[1:13:59] something wrong
[1:14:00] to block the visitation
[1:14:04] that god was going to give abraham and
[1:14:06] sarah
[1:14:08] wow
[1:14:09] now the prophet has given insight
[1:14:11] as they're sitting on the plains of
[1:14:12] memory and it's hot
[1:14:16] and the devil wants to block this
[1:14:18] visitation of god coming
[1:14:20] and he said when he tempts when he
[1:14:22] tempts you
[1:14:24] what is he trying to do he's trying to
[1:14:26] get you to disbelief
[1:14:29] the worst thing you can do is disbelieve
[1:14:33] as soon as you get scared and say maybe
[1:14:35] i've done this or i haven't done that
[1:14:37] right the devil has conquered you
[1:14:40] you can't get it as long as the devil
[1:14:43] makes you think that
[1:14:46] perhaps you wouldn't listen to such
[1:14:48] temptations like that and if you paid
[1:14:50] attention you may miss the blessing
[1:14:55] then everything rises out of order
[1:14:58] maybe if we would just listen to satan
[1:15:01] we might miss seeing it like sarah did
[1:15:04] he said see
[1:15:06] sarah was a little fussy that morning i
[1:15:10] don't believe brother branham's just
[1:15:11] talking
[1:15:12] he said that morning sarah was just a
[1:15:15] little bit fussy
[1:15:16] and you know we seen her in the
[1:15:18] scriptures you know show out a little
[1:15:20] bit
[1:15:21] and uh and thank god because the bible
[1:15:23] tells all sides
[1:15:25] oh yeah yeah i know everyone's got halos
[1:15:27] over their head it's amazing you should
[1:15:29] see it but we're all human beings
[1:15:32] and we all get a little fussy once in a
[1:15:34] while
[1:15:36] pray for me i'm the only one that gets
[1:15:37] messy
[1:15:39] so
[1:15:40] sarah was just a little fussy on the
[1:15:42] morning of the visitation
[1:15:45] and you know why
[1:15:46] brother branham said she was thinking
[1:15:48] about how lot and his wife went down to
[1:15:51] sodom and had all the modern caravans
[1:15:53] and imagine she's standing in front of
[1:15:55] the mirrors and got her feathers and her
[1:15:57] fluff and her plumes and you know you
[1:15:59] know with the thing on her eyelashes and
[1:16:02] she puffing herself with all the ladies
[1:16:06] and i'm stuck out here at these flies
[1:16:09] look at all this dust he tracked dust
[1:16:11] back into my tent
[1:16:13] so sick and tired so hot the air
[1:16:15] conditioning ain't fixed
[1:16:18] he tells me to cook and i have nothing
[1:16:20] to cook with
[1:16:22] dirt pies abraham
[1:16:26] abraham's outside for a reason
[1:16:30] lord bring the promise to pass
[1:16:35] brother branham said he looked and he
[1:16:36] saw visitors coming
[1:16:38] and he said they they had dust on their
[1:16:40] clothes i love the way brother branham
[1:16:42] describes brother branham said satan was
[1:16:45] trying to distract sarah
[1:16:47] from the things of god because satan
[1:16:49] knew
[1:16:51] that it was coming
[1:16:53] and abraham was watching and he sees
[1:16:55] three men coming
[1:16:57] how many are looking forward to seeing
[1:16:58] that day when the dead loved ones come
[1:17:00] walking through the walls i believe it
[1:17:02] with everything i'm not ashamed of it
[1:17:04] the dead loved ones will walk through
[1:17:06] those walls
[1:17:08] it'll be
[1:17:09] brother branham said spirit-filled
[1:17:11] people are always watching
[1:17:13] spirit filled people who are always
[1:17:16] recognizing the presence of god now most
[1:17:19] people how many people they walked by
[1:17:21] all right marlon
[1:17:23] marlin hide out
[1:17:25] and they just walked right by they had
[1:17:27] dust on their clothes they just look
[1:17:28] like you and i
[1:17:30] and they had a predestinated appointment
[1:17:32] with an elect
[1:17:34] abraham he's noticed something because
[1:17:37] he was watching
[1:17:38] he was expecting he never lost his faith
[1:17:42] he never got discouraged
[1:17:45] god help us not to get discouraged
[1:17:49] and as they were walking out brother
[1:17:50] branham said notice the spirit declared
[1:17:53] them
[1:17:54] he kept himself in a spiritual
[1:17:56] atmosphere so he could recognize right
[1:17:59] from wrong all the time
[1:18:01] that's the way the christian ought to do
[1:18:04] he said never looking at the bad side
[1:18:07] and to the good side you're the children
[1:18:09] of god expecting his blessings
[1:18:12] he said
[1:18:13] he ran in and said sarah this is the day
[1:18:16] of our visitation and he said he run out
[1:18:19] woo
[1:18:20] how he said lord give me spiritual eyes
[1:18:23] help me not to become common even
[1:18:25] meetings like this or i'm tired
[1:18:28] lord help me not to miss my visitation
[1:18:34] abraham told sarah get something on and
[1:18:37] he takes off running out and she's like
[1:18:39] again
[1:18:41] she's in a mood
[1:18:43] he comes out he washes their feet and he
[1:18:45] brings them to the outside of the tent i
[1:18:46] love the way brother branham describes
[1:18:48] it i believe he's seeing it he said he
[1:18:50] took the chair and leaned back against
[1:18:52] the tent he said he was talking to
[1:18:54] abraham
[1:18:57] do you think god would come down and
[1:18:59] lean back in one of these chairs and
[1:19:01] fellowship with us
[1:19:03] i believe with all my heart
[1:19:05] he said where's
[1:19:06] sarah she's in the tent behind you
[1:19:10] she's a little fussy this morning
[1:19:15] oh do you love the lord
[1:19:18] and he said she missed it
[1:19:21] she lied right to the face of the angel
[1:19:25] said i didn't laugh he said but you did
[1:19:28] brother branham said let us be open
[1:19:32] let us be willing
[1:19:34] and blessed is he that is not offended
[1:19:36] in me
[1:19:37] you laugh at sarah but do you realize
[1:19:39] she types you and me
[1:19:42] she types the church
[1:19:44] and the church has been the moody one
[1:19:46] the unspiritual one the weaker one the
[1:19:49] fussy one
[1:19:50] dear god
[1:19:51] 50 years of fussing
[1:19:53] since brother branham went off the scene
[1:19:58] but we're still watching
[1:20:00] i'm not offended that god didn't come in
[1:20:03] 1977
[1:20:06] i'm not offended that false teaching is
[1:20:08] everywhere
[1:20:11] these things must be
[1:20:13] i'm not offended that those that are
[1:20:15] preaching what brother branham preached
[1:20:17] is a minority i'm not offended by that
[1:20:20] i'm not offended that we're a rejected
[1:20:22] outcast despised little group i'm not
[1:20:24] offended
[1:20:28] how many can say amen
[1:20:31] listen blessed
[1:20:33] are they
[1:20:35] who are not offended in me
[1:20:37] abraham was not offended
[1:20:39] he was blessed by god
[1:20:41] how many want to be blessed
[1:20:44] blessed are the meek
[1:20:46] blessed are the peacemakers
[1:20:49] blessed are they that are rejected and
[1:20:51] called all manner of evil for my name's
[1:20:53] sake
[1:20:54] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[1:20:56] listen i want us blessings
[1:20:59] i don't want to be caught in my own
[1:21:01] spirit
[1:21:04] and i believe with all my heart the same
[1:21:06] change they were looking for we're
[1:21:08] looking for on a greater level
[1:21:11] take god at his word
[1:21:12] don't be scared

[1:21:21] it will not fail there may not be
[1:21:23] another next time here

[1:21:27] but this message will produce it
