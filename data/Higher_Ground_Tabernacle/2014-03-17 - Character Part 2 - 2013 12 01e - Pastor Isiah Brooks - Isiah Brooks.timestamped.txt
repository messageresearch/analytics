[2:23] Psalm 27 this evening Psalm 27 I was
[2:26] just going to read a few verses and I
[2:27] believe the Holy Spirit wants me to read
[2:29] the entire
[2:31] chapter listen how David starts off the
[2:36] Lord is my light and my salvation Whom
[2:41] Shall I Fear the Lord is the light is
[2:45] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[2:48] be afraid when the wicked even mine
[2:52] enemy and my foes Came Upon me to eat up
[2:56] my flesh they stumbled and fell amen
[3:00] though a host should encamp against me
[3:03] my heart should not fear amen though War
[3:06] should rise against me in this will I be
[3:10] confident amen one thing have I desired
[3:13] of the Lord that will I seek after one
[3:17] thing amen I have desired I'm going to
[3:21] seek after right that I may dwell in the
[3:24] house of the Lord all the days of my
[3:26] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[3:29] and to inquire in his
[3:31] Temple for in the time of trouble he
[3:35] shall hide me in his provision in the
[3:38] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[3:40] me he shall set me up upon a
[3:45] rock and now shall my head be lifted up
[3:49] above mine enemies round about me
[3:52] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[3:54] sacrifices of Joy I will sing y I will
[3:58] sing praises unto the Lord amen
[4:02] understand David is saying I'll bring
[4:03] sacrifices that mean it's not an easy
[4:05] thing to do right now but I'm going to
[4:08] give it to him anyway Hallelujah here oh

[5:28] goodness of the Lord Lord in the land of
[5:31] the living you hear what I'm saying he
[5:33] said I had fainted if I had allowed any
[5:36] doubt to get in between my salvation and
[5:39] me if I had only allowed Satan to make
[5:42] me think uh God is Not on my side I'm
[5:45] not worthy to make it if I had only
[5:47] allowed just a little piece of something
[5:49] to break or bring a breach I had fainted
[5:54] I would have fainted because that's my
[5:56] only hope amen that's my only hope that
[5:59] I'll live in the land of the living I

[7:13] escaped they've escaped their snares of
[7:16] the devil they they they are now sitting
[7:18] in Heavenly places in Christ Lord I am
[7:21] so grateful Lord to know Lord God that
[7:25] you've allowed us father to be part of
[7:28] your work in this last day Lord and God
[7:31] if we could save others or see others
[7:33] saved we would do so I pray father that
[7:36] you bless each and every heart take away
[7:38] every un uh spirit of unbelief and every
[7:41] Spirit of doubt we ask these things in
[7:43] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank
[7:46] you Father ah if you may be
[7:51] seated would I like to to do just for a
[7:55] moment salvation is so plain and clear
[8:00] to me by the help and Grace of the
[8:03] lord we see how that
[8:07] um God has been gracious to us and
[8:14] uh the more I see it the more uh Joy
[8:18] seems to fill my
[8:21] soul and you can go from Genesis to
[8:24] Revelation and you'll find out that it
[8:27] was always Grace
[8:31] amen it was Grace that God revealed to
[8:34] Abel the
[8:36] lamb it was Grace that God gave Abel the
[8:40] ability and the Revelation so that he
[8:43] could slay the
[8:44] lamb hello somebody it was always Grace
[8:48] there was nothing that Adam and Eve did
[8:50] because God had already placed judgment
[8:52] on them y'all know what I'm saying
[8:55] because if you you got your dos and
[8:57] don'ts still laying there before you
[9:00] Satan will take your does and don'ts and
[9:02] he's going to condemn you with them amen
[9:04] you see what I'm saying there was only
[9:06] one righteous there was only one holy
[9:08] the Bible said no man sought me I sought
[9:11] man y'all hear what I'm saying so if you
[9:14] can just simply trust the Lamb of God if
[9:17] you can trust God for your salvation
[9:20] that is salvation that means that you
[9:23] really believe that he died in your stad
[9:26] not only did he die in your stad but the
[9:27] Bible tell us he went to the region of
[9:29] the law amen for you you were supposed
[9:33] to go there he went there for you right
[9:36] and as we died with him we also rose
[9:39] with him brother bam said as God as he
[9:41] rose we rose with him you got to believe
[9:44] that people for the time that's getting
[9:46] ready to oppress upon you you've got to
[9:49] believe the simple gospel if you don't
[9:51] believe that you won't make it because
[9:55] you're resting upon the arms of your
[9:57] flesh and your flesh will will fail you
[10:01] y'all hear what I'm saying your flesh
[10:03] will fail you it's got to be Faith
[10:05] something that you can't see with your
[10:07] natural eye but you believe that Christ
[10:10] did it all for you amen amen thank you
[10:15] Lord cuz you don't know at the in the
[10:17] time of your your being tested whether
[10:19] you going to slep a little bit or
[10:21] not you don't know that but if you do
[10:25] you're covered y'all hear what I'm
[10:27] saying you're covered amen
[10:29] you're covered by the blood of the Lamb
[10:32] you're
[10:33] covered y'all hear what I'm saying
[10:35] that's I'm trying to get you to see
[10:36] where you got to separate this wicked
[10:38] man yes sir from you amen that inner man
[10:41] is the man that God is interested in
[10:44] he's not interested in this flesh here
[10:46] amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen so
[10:49] you and I must understand that God's
[10:51] grace is with us if we can believe it
[10:55] the word of God C right there he says
[10:57] when the my when the wicked even mine
[10:58] enem enies and my foes Came Upon me to
[11:01] eat up my flesh they stumbled and Fa you
[11:05] know every time I think about that I
[11:06] think about how when they came to to
[11:09] rush on Jesus at the Garden of
[11:11] Gethsemane the Bible said they came up
[11:13] and they all fell backwards amen they
[11:16] could not charge him because of the
[11:18] force field that was around him amen
[11:20] they couldn't just grab him and do what
[11:22] they wanted to do he had to surrender
[11:25] and understand you and I will have to
[11:27] surrender in order for them to take
[11:30] us now I said that because really when
[11:33] Jesus Christ said in St John 10:30 and I
[11:36] love this scripture he said I and my
[11:39] father are one I read you a quote this
[11:42] morning where brother brandom said when
[11:43] it comes to the Bible you ought to be
[11:45] able to look into this Bible and said
[11:47] that's me amen amen amenl I I can see
[11:52] myself being like David you know I I can
[11:54] see myself being like Joseph amen I I
[11:57] can see myself come on somebody amen I
[12:00] can see myself being the positive amen
[12:03] and not the
[12:05] negative I'm not the negative and you
[12:07] got to not be the negative amen you got
[12:10] to be the positive that's in the
[12:13] scripture oh my as we spoke this morning
[12:17] on Elijah uh you know one of the things
[12:19] in the message identification the
[12:21] prophet of God said where would you
[12:23] present where would your present
[12:25] Christian experience place you in
[12:27] Elijah's time somebody ought to be
[12:30] jumping out of your
[12:32] seat you know what I'm saying because

[12:43] denominations over there with the

[12:48] side so the scriptures identifying who
[12:50] you are there was not one person who
[12:53] left Elijah and went over to bail amen
[12:57] they stayed with Elijah amen and God
[13:00] Vindicated their Ministry by sending
[13:02] them the fire you don't have to worry
[13:04] about the fire the fire will be sent am
[13:07] you're going to get exactly what God
[13:09] promised you to get amen you won't have
[13:12] to work up for it it is what it is
[13:14] hallelujah I don't know how it all
[13:16] happens and how God does it but the
[13:18] prophet of God said every word that God
[13:20] spoke has to make material materialize
[13:22] itself every word has to materialize
[13:26] itself Hallelujah and listen you would
[13:29] wouldn't be sitting right here right now

[16:35] delivered you forget exactly what all
[16:37] that pain was about amen it it's true I
[16:40] don't know how they do it brother amen

[17:11] and he says now I want you to take it he
[17:13] says tell me where so you can understand
[17:16] you know your your condition your place
[17:18] and your position right now in in God
[17:22] you're determin that because now you're
[17:23] listening to Elijah's message amen amen
[17:28] amen yeah that identifies who you are
[17:32] amen oh my see what side would you have
[17:36] took then or when Moses brought Israel
[17:38] going down there as as identified
[17:41] Prophet with the word that God promised
[17:43] Abraham see the prophet would take place
[17:46] and Moses went down and done all those
[17:47] signs that God told him to do listen
[17:50] we're going to uh he said brought them
[17:52] children out and got into the Wilderness
[17:54] now listen he says now that's exactly
[17:56] what the Pentecostals did 50 years years
[17:59] ago what did they do they denied amen
[18:03] God bringing them
[18:05] out see they they really sold their
[18:08] birth right to denominationalism and
[18:12] organizational ISM why because in their
[18:15] Ram they had some daans and chorus amen
[18:19] they had those amen who could look at
[18:20] Moses and say hey do you think you're
[18:23] the only one come on somebody they had
[18:25] people with gifts and powers and
[18:27] whatever more going on in their
[18:29] organization so when the real man of God
[18:32] that was sent in our day came they
[18:34] couldn't even recognize that was God
[18:37] Amen that was a trick of the devil he
[18:38] did it in Egypt's day and he's doing it
[18:40] in our day but where are
[18:44] you Hallelujah they can say whatever
[18:46] they want about Elijah I know who he is
[18:49] hallelujah I I know his calling I know
[18:52] why God sent the man Hallelujah and had
[18:55] not God sent him we would be setting
[18:57] right now in Babylon amen
[19:00] we'll be among those who have been
[19:02] judged already weighed in the balance
[19:05] come on found wanting is that right come
[19:08] on somebody you know by the grace it's
[19:10] the truth it's Bishop so and so and
[19:13] Elders so and so and brother so and so
[19:15] look at these men with these what they
[19:17] call them uh um these Ministries uh uh I
[19:21] want to say massive Ministry but that a
[19:23] that ain't what they call them it's a
[19:25] it's it's a term that they uh they give
[19:27] them now and people let me ask you a
[19:29] question in what way do that resemble
[19:35] Jesus broad is the way amen that lead to
[19:39] destruction amen many have follow that
[19:42] way but the Bible said narrow is a way
[19:46] amen that lead to destru uh to life and
[19:48] only a few be that find it now think
[19:51] about it the greater Jesus came the more
[19:55] teaching now while he was preaching
[19:56] while he was Healing The Sick and
[19:58] raising the Dead and all of that he had
[19:59] multitude after multitude but when he
[20:02] began to sit down and teach
[20:05] them the M the the the crowd got narrow
[20:09] 70 ministers left at one time come on
[20:12] somebody amen and now he's just got 12
[20:16] and he's looking at the 12 and says do
[20:18] you want to leave
[20:19] too in other words God don't need us we
[20:22] need God Amen but he knew the response
[20:26] to that he was just wanting to hear it
[20:28] well we're going to go amen you're the
[20:30] only one that has a words to eternal
[20:33] life search the world search the world
[20:36] all over for this a message greater than
[20:39] this one where are you going to go what
[20:41] you going to do there's nothing greater
[20:44] out there than what we
[20:46] preach Lord it is not a man it's all
[20:50] about Jesus
[20:54] Christ oh my God you think about it now
[20:58] go God is molding character in you amen
[21:01] no matter what they said they said Jesus
[21:03] was born of
[21:05] fornication come on he's be above they
[21:08] said every little negative thing they
[21:09] could say about him but it didn't it
[21:11] didn't it didn't shake the true

[22:15] am you know that's why Jesus didn't wear
[22:18] all that strange kind of clothes CU he
[22:20] wanted to be just himself you can meet a
[22:23] Pentecostal preacher and you'll know him
[22:25] if you're spiritual enough you know is
[22:27] there something the way he says his
[22:30] words it's just even when he's talking

[22:35] about him that you can pick up that that

[22:56] atmosphere about us than everybody
[22:59] else hallelujah hallelujah come on
[23:03] somebody amen it's just something that
[23:06] we bring with us almost like the prophet

[23:11] house he they were getting ready to go
[23:12] hunting right and he had all of his
[23:15] jeans on and see we don't have to be
[23:18] dressed up to bring forth the atmosphere
[23:19] of Heaven amen hadn't taken a bath in a
[23:22] long time and but by the time he was
[23:25] done we had a soul saved amen

[23:45] that good didn't not our heart burn as
[23:48] they talked to us along the way I mean
[23:50] they don't express themselves but their
[23:51] face the all of their faces shows that
[23:54] there's something different about us
[23:56] that's what the people need to see yes
[23:59] when people come through this door they
[24:00] don't need to see another
[24:02] church they don't need to see another
[24:05] little group of people gathering
[24:06] together when they walk in here even so
[24:08] they be they should be able to feel the
[24:10] love of God pull them right on
[24:13] in right but we've got to have love for
[24:16] one another we've got to create that
[24:18] atmosphere you ought to say before you
[24:20] get to this place Lord God when I come
[24:23] into this place among my brethren I want
[24:25] the atmosphere of love to be around me
[24:28] see it's what you think it's what you
[24:30] speak amen that brings and creates Your
[24:33] Atmosphere that's true

[24:41] want you to understand some of us are
[24:43] not doing much at least you think you're
[24:45] not amen but those little things that

[24:49] counts and last y'all hear what I'm
[24:51] saying because little becomes much when
[24:54] it's placed in the Master's Hand listen
[24:56] to a quote coming from identific ation
[24:59] here it was brother her name was
[25:01] Florence sharen who was demon sharan's
[25:05] sister amen and she said to brother
[25:07] brandham I fast and fast and Fast and

[25:17] such your duty is
[25:20] fast amen hallelujah so those of us
[25:23] who's got a gift to fast that's what
[25:25] you've been called for but your fasting
[25:27] is not being wasteful maybe you don't
[25:29] know why you're fasting he said but the
[25:32] holy spirit is working on somebody else
[25:34] out there for
[25:36] that you're fasting and God's working
[25:39] somewhere else on your behalf oh my
[25:43] godall don't ain't that good so you
[25:46] don't have to have a need or desire oh
[25:48] Lord why am I fast you don't even have
[25:50] to know if God put you on it stay on it
[25:53] cuz somebody's working off of that
[25:55] energy amen amen Holy Spirit working on
[25:59] somebody else out there for for that you
[26:01] don't know the place if we've had time
[26:04] we teach those things in Long meanings
[26:07] how if one person's burden like for this
[26:09] one for something over here see it is
[26:12] not for you to know it's him doing it
[26:15] you just submissive to your call always
[26:19] line up with the scripture see if it's
[26:21] right or not see amen that's what he was
[26:24] saying so when God even if it's prayer
[26:27] God got you but in the early morning
[26:29] praying you you're not necessarily
[26:31] praying for yourself somebody needs you
[26:33] amen when God wakes me up in the morning
[26:35] sometimes I can't do nothing but to pray
[26:37] and the first thing I think about is my
[26:39] family maybe my boys out there my
[26:41] daughters somebody's doing something
[26:42] they ain't got no business Lord but
[26:44] whatever it is you protect them yes amen
[26:47] y'all ever feel like that amen oh that's
[26:50] what God does he does it for you and
[26:53] sometime it's for people that you don't
[26:54] even know but they're part of the family
[26:59] is that right amen I remember I forgot
[27:02] what what city it was brother Ram had
[27:03] such a powerful meeting and he said that
[27:05] meeting would have never been powerful
[27:07] had it not been for the Sisters fasting
[27:08] and praying behind the
[27:13] curtain see so we've got a body this is
[27:16] a body people that's right amen whether
[27:18] it's for these here or those there it
[27:20] doesn't matter as long as somebody get
[27:21] in the hell amen
[27:23] hallelujah glory to
[27:26] God hallelujah
[27:28] this is Psalm 23 is such a powerful song
[27:31] and many times you know we've seen this
[27:34] song uh quoted and and and in in in in
[27:37] in movies and we didn't I I personally
[27:40] didn't even see the power of God in this
[27:42] thing like I like I do now but you many
[27:45] times when it came to somebody being
[27:47] Exorcist or something they always would
[27:49] read this scripture and you know because
[27:52] even the Hollywood know how powerful and
[27:54] sound it is the Lord is my shepherd I
[27:57] shall not want you see what I'm saying
[27:59] amen let's turn there quickly Psalm 23
[28:02] you love the Lord amen so I I want you
[28:04] to understand that you and I must be
[28:06] submissive to our call if God got you
[28:08] singing you sing maybe that's all that
[28:10] God wants you to do amen God wants you
[28:13] to help other people you know and stuff
[28:15] like that I think about I hope you don't
[28:17] mind me calling his name brother Marsha
[28:19] different ones sister Vanda different
[28:21] ones and a many of you do the same you
[28:23] help each other but he go find little
[28:25] things and I think about the little gift
[28:27] that he gave the other day day amen and
[28:29] they were so thrill happy about that
[28:31] gift but God predestinated it that was
[28:35] supposed to go to the other individual I
[28:37] mean that's the way God does
[28:40] it these little simple things that you
[28:42] think is not important that's what
[28:44] you've been called to do as long as you
[28:46] do it without grudging and complaining
[28:49] and murmuring it you letting the love of
[28:51] God flow through
[28:54] you amen
[28:58] H calling somebody up for a dinner
[29:00] because the Holy Spirit put them on your
[29:02] heart calling them up for a coffee or
[29:04] whatever you don't even realize you're
[29:06] being led by the spirit cuz you know a
[29:08] lot of time we think when we led by the
[29:10] spirit we got to hear Thunderbolt and
[29:11] something
[29:13] clapping that's just not it it's so
[29:16] simple it's so simple like like you
[29:18] packing your lunch with a few fish and
[29:20] loaves of bread thinking you going to
[29:21] eat it
[29:23] today like that little boy he didn't
[29:25] know he was taking it to the to the to
[29:27] the church for everybody eat his
[29:30] meal but he took that little fish those
[29:32] fish and loads of bread and he took it
[29:34] and here God had need of it and he
[29:35] wasn't grudging he gave it freely freely
[29:38] given amen so you got to realize amen
[29:41] that when God works with you just do
[29:43] what he says
[29:47] amen the truth you know I it's the truth
[29:50] I saw a man on the corner and I was
[29:52] going to give him what I think $20 or
[29:54] $10 whatever it was but I had one of my
[29:57] bills stuck to it I only meant to give
[29:59] him
[30:01] 10 whatever it was he got a double
[30:05] portion and it was way up the road I
[30:07] realized the man got all my money but
[30:10] then I didn't get upset I said well Lord
[30:12] you knew what he needed more than what I
[30:15] need you know what I'm saying he needed
[30:17] it more so and I was happy that God took
[30:21] took my will away from me and made his
[30:26] will yeah
[30:28] oh I had to laugh I did I laughed I said
[30:31] God you
[30:33] awesome you know God to put something on
[30:35] your heart and you like you know well
[30:37] maybe maybe you know you peel it down
[30:39] and God said not today you giving it
[30:41] all oh thank you Jesus

[33:14] y'all hear what I'm saying so he loved
[33:16] you even when you was a sinner he
[33:18] protected you from the bullet he
[33:20] protected you from the C he protected
[33:23] you from being dead right now now if he
[33:25] protected you then don't you think he's
[33:27] going to protect you now his whole
[33:29] desire is to see you molded and made I'm

[33:39] desire this is my heart desire every day
[33:43] every day I don't care yes I am battled

[34:03] get before him and says Lord clean it up
[34:06] yes sir have mercy upon me clean it up I
[34:09] just made a mess of things just now
[34:11] anybody know what I'm talking about it
[34:13] is what we do as
[34:16] Christians that's what that's what makes
[34:18] you know you're a Christian if you
[34:20] confess before him something in you
[34:22] making you confess serpent seed can't do
[34:25] it I'm telling you Cain you go do what
[34:27] your brother rather do he couldn't do it
[34:30] he had rather walk out of the presence
[34:31] of God than to make it

[34:36] don't care how hard it is you have the
[34:39] ability to make it right that means

[34:58] listen here we
[35:00] are how can I say it you are being
[35:04] Vindicated right now on who you
[35:10] are Elijah's message being preached you
[35:14] receiving it and saying amen it is
[35:17] vindicating to you who you are right
[35:20] amen because understand you're not
[35:22] saying it just just as as some uh Rhythm
[35:25] type thing you're saying it cuz out of
[35:27] your heart comes you don't even think
[35:29] I'm going to say Amen it comes up amen
[35:32] right because it shows that it's in your
[35:34] heart it's in your heart amen Lord amen
[35:39] you love the Lord now listen how how how
[35:44] awesome this is and we find out that
[35:47] this that even in our day that's why you
[35:49] have to believe things that doesn't
[35:51] sound sound are the things that God work
[35:56] with you say have sound Doctrine a
[35:59] virgin shall
[36:02] conceive it's sound because God's word
[36:05] says it right but where in
[36:09] Earth if if you have been back there
[36:11] when Isaiah spoke it you would have said
[36:15] surely I've seen Isaiah preach or
[36:18] Minister many times but he just missed
[36:20] it folks he just missed it because he
[36:23] just said to us that a virgin shall
[36:26] conceive unheard
[36:28] it can't happen now realiz realize this
[36:32] amen for the Jewish people who are very
[36:34] intellectual who are very intelligent
[36:36] people to believe that a virgin shall
[36:41] conceive Joseph said I'm killing her in
[36:44] the morning God said no you're not I
[36:46] mean he was a righteous man he was a
[36:50] righteous man but he himself could not
[36:52] believe Mary's
[36:55] report and God had to come and talk to
[36:58] Joseph he had to have a supernatural
[37:00] visitation from God his friends couldn't
[37:03] convince him nor otherwise amen he had
[37:05] to have God come down and says listen
[37:07] Joseph this thing that being in her is
[37:09] of the Holy
[37:11] Ghost y'all hear what I'm
[37:13] saying and then God had to come that
[37:16] wasn't just
[37:17] Joseph amen what Eli
[37:22] um John's daddy can't his
[37:26] name he he couldn't believe it either
[37:29] Zachariah he couldn't believe amen what
[37:32] what uh Elizabeth
[37:35] said and God come and smite the man says
[37:39] listen you'll be dumb because you won't
[37:41] believe we're talking about holy and
[37:43] righteous people who could not believe
[37:46] the visitation from the
[37:48] angel but look at you God didn't have to
[37:51] Smite you but he come down and he he and
[37:55] you wasn't even there Hallelujah
[37:58] and blessed is a man who have not seen
[38:00] But and believe
[38:02] Hallelujah God come down and he's
[38:05] bringing you the word of God and he's
[38:07] telling you how blessed you
[38:10] are you think about
[38:12] it was it Phillip uh was it uh
[38:17] Nathaniel uh uh whom there was no
[38:22] God and he says Thou Art truly the
[38:25] Messiah he said you believe me that I'm
[38:27] the Messiah because I said here's a man
[38:30] that has no God he's not a liar or a
[38:32] thief or anything he said blessed are
[38:35] you because you're going to see greater
[38:37] things
[38:39] amen huh amen oh I saw you when you was
[38:42] up in the
[38:44] tree come on somebody God didn't he
[38:46] didn't even come to us we weren't there
[38:48] when he was calling out people out in
[38:50] the line but we heard it we know it's
[38:53] real something echoed in our hearts and
[38:55] our soul and say it's real amen and
[38:57] because you believe it you you had an
[38:59] ear to hear it vindicates you a sheep
[39:02] Amen
[39:04] Hallelujah Lord none of us are
[39:06] smart if we were we wouldn't need the
[39:10] Bible but we're smart enough to know we
[39:12] need the
[39:14] Bible Hallelujah is that all right now
[39:18] let me let me move on just a minute
[39:19] because I don't want to be long because
[39:21] we got communion but the acts you know I
[39:25] I going read something here he says
[39:26] listen he said his last identification
[39:29] or we find in Hell crying for Lazarus to
[39:32] come bring him some water or your
[39:35] identification could you be identified
[39:38] with the group that Judas was in he
[39:41] started to walk with Jesus he started
[39:43] out all right like the Pentecostals did
[39:45] years ago but the very thing that they
[39:47] come out of the organization your
[39:49] mothers and your fathers this young
[39:51] group had turned right back and made
[39:53] them one just like they come out of see
[39:56] what what type group are you with now
[39:59] the Bible said that the L C Church AE
[40:01] Judas you know carried he saw the
[40:03] possibility of getting something great
[40:06] with what he had Now understand this why
[40:09] he called him Judas because really am
[40:12] mean one of the reasons is because it is
[40:14] the organizations that have turned
[40:16] turned against this message they are the
[40:18] ones who can identify us
[40:23] amen hello somebody they are the ones
[40:26] who goes and tells the the upper uh uh
[40:29] group of people hey these branhamites
[40:31] are in the city we're not branhamites we
[40:34] belong to Jesus Christ
[40:37] amen hallelujah hallelujah y'all
[40:40] understand me amen you said why would
[40:42] you say that because listen either
[40:44] brother bram's right or he's wrong he
[40:46] asked the angel he said are all these
[40:49] Brams he said no these are converts to
[40:52] Jesus Christ amen if the angel would
[40:55] have said yes then I would be
[40:59] bromite but he said no all of these are
[41:02] converts to Jesus Christ so I belong to
[41:04] Jesus Christ amen amen so he thought
[41:07] with that he carried that bag and he
[41:09] could make some extra money by selling
[41:11] him for 30 pieces of silver that's
[41:13] exactly what Leo Dean Church age did you
[41:16] rich you you say I increased and have
[41:18] plenty goods and I have need of nothing
[41:20] and you don't know that you're wretched
[41:22] miserable blind and naked is this

[48:23] understand by the grace of God that
[48:25] there is nothing you can change about
[48:28] what you did yesterday amen it's
[48:30] finished it's finished and my point is
[48:34] do you think at any point that God
[48:37] didn't know and see you doing the things
[48:39] you did whether they were good or bad
[48:41] amen now think about it and he still
[48:44] loves
[48:46] you let me tell you something I had a
[48:48] old mother let me tell you what she had
[48:51] the love of God in her and I expect to
[48:53] see her
[48:54] there y'all hear what I'm saying when
[48:56] day my mother said something to me and
[48:58] I'm going to tell you what I I won't
[48:59] tell you what I did it was really
[49:02] bad and my mother by Revelation from the
[49:05] Holy Ghost came to me and she said
[49:06] Junior you know the Lord don't like when
[49:09] you do so and so and so and so and me
[49:12] and my little inocent eyes I caught her
[49:14] eyes and said mama you know I would
[49:15] never do such a thing as
[49:19] that hey y'all better believe it I got
[49:21] some children if you didn't see them
[49:23] they can convince you they didn't do it
[49:27] you saw them take it and they said I
[49:29] didn't take
[49:31] it so when I see that I always think
[49:34] about what I did to my
[49:36] mama but I wasn't lying to my mama I was
[49:38] lying to
[49:40] God it was just the grace of God
[49:43] lightning didn't come from somewhere and
[49:45] take me out but he had a purpose for me
[49:48] but my point is this thing that my mama
[49:51] saw me do was
[49:53] wicked and she loved me anyway
[49:59] she didn't she saw me it had to be by
[50:03] Vision it had to be my vision you know
[50:06] what I'm saying but she loved me
[50:09] anyway now let's put it on the level of
[50:15] God and how many times he told us not to
[50:18] do it and we did it anyhow amen and he
[50:21] still love
[50:23] you and nothing can change his love for
[50:26] you
[50:27] amen no devil can trip you up enough to
[50:30] change it nobody can falsify your
[50:33] records cuz he got that in heaven
[50:37] amen hallelujah oh my people if you can
[50:42] realize this thing is so sweet to me it
[50:45] like I I want almost Rush this thing I
[50:47] want to rush it you know I want to rush
[50:49] this thing and says Lord please let it
[50:51] happen now you know but God still got to
[50:54] work on us he still got things to do
[50:56] within us
[50:57] am and I know it's going to be such a
[50:58] perfect time but let me tell you
[51:01] something we're getting ready to do
[51:03] communion you ought to thank God that
[51:06] he's allowed you to be partakers of his
[51:09] communion a lot of us don't even realize
[51:11] how important any is he told Peter he
[51:14] said if you don't wash each other's feet
[51:15] you won't have nothing to do with me and
[51:19] people said well you know feet washing
[51:20] is not necessary it is necessary
[51:24] am huh but you don't have to take
[51:27] communion oh see that's what people
[51:30] don't understand whether you understand
[51:32] the reason why we ought to he said do
[51:33] iten till I
[51:36] come and that's why we do it because he
[51:38] say do it amen right and I'm going to
[51:41] tell you something really we don't do it
[51:43] as much as he say amen he said we ought
[51:45] to do it as much as we come together as
[51:48] often as we come together you know what
[51:49] it does it keeps the devil out of your
[51:51] lives if you really really sincere about
[51:54] communion it'll keep your mind right
