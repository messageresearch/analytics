we won't be loaned by God's grace amen it's a little cool in here for you all love the Lord he may hallelujah God is so good to us and we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and I think God was a God of humor he loves to do little things to see how we're gonna react so for those of us who may not understand how God feels when he said be hot or cold now we understand by God's grace when God cuts off the furnace in the time of winter you love the Lord he's worthy to be praised and we thank him for it Philippians 4 he's I trust everybody is enjoying their salvation it is given to us to be enjoyed it shouldn't be a burden to us to know that the finishing line is a great finishing line and to know that the work is already finished we're not trying to be saved we are saved and the the the the the the thing that I love about it is that the Bible tells us that the work was finished before the foundation of the world I love it Philippians 3 and then we'll go to Galatians we're going to do a part two of what we did on on Wednesday night I appreciate the Lord for holding up the snow you didn't just give me one service he gave me two they say there's going to it's gonna snow probably around 7:00 or so you know I I just thank God because God has a prayer answering God and you know I want to be able to see every little thing that he does a Stickley in my own life so I can always give him the praise and glory for it because you know he doesn't have to do it but he does all these things for pleasure and then when we see him doing it y'all to say thank you you know praise God let your perfect will be done Philippians 3:13 to fourteenth verse brethren account not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus how you doing brother Nehemiah good Galatians please Galatians five we're gonna read the seventh verse ye did run well who did him to you that you should not obey the truth let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and Lord you've been so good to us words cannot even express our gratitude toward you there is none like you a God who is so holy that there are no words to express it throughout eternity the Seraphim the Chairman's they all scream out holy and even those words are not significance significant of your excellency but father I just believe somehow when we get there there be a language there be words that we will be able to express unto you Lord God that will give you perfect praise and Father but while we're here let our lives be a praise may it be our lives be examples of your grace may we glorify you in everything we do father we have not yet comprehended all of these things but I know Lord God that the revelation of your truth will continue to reveal itself in us bless each and every heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we see things and I just thank God because God is so good to us oftentimes we we battle mine thoughts and but I think sometimes if we're not careful we'll forget while we're here sometimes we battle things because we allow ourselves to battle them God also ordained battles but we must realize that no matter how the picture looks it doesn't really describe the thing that it really is for an example there was a statue of Jesus Christ that were constructed and built and when this critical this man looked at the statue he was really disillusioned or he was really confused because he thought that the picture did not exemplify the real true preacher pitch of Christ on the cross but there was a man standing by and told him said now I want you to do something I want you to kneel and then look up because that's the way the artist that's the way the sculptor or whatever had made the picture and then when he kneeled and was able to look up he saw all of the agony and all of the pain and everything that went on at kaleri in the face of Christ which brought a conviction to his heart see that's the only way that you and I will ever see Calvary we often forget that our suffering cannot even be compared to what he has suffered and sometimes we look at Christ and we look at his picture and and and for some reason we just don't get it we don't get the full picture of his suffering for us that God would forgive us of our sins we we fail to see in the reason being is because we fail to kneel in order to understand God in order to press through this season you must learn how to kneel you must learn how to look up so that you won't forget your mission so you understand that the suffering of Christ was some little thing it took God in flesh to suffer because no human being could have done it no man made of a woman could have done this and think about every stripe he took was for you not your neighbor you I like to entitle this message similar to the one we did on Wednesday night a mission made possible and the only reason why the mission is possible is because God made the way according to the prophet of God we were not only saved before the foundation of the world but the Bible also tells he also tells us Amen that we were chosen elected and sealed the thing that makes a slow up some time like we know in Galatians they were dealing with the law of circumcision and Paul came along as it's not but who has bewitched you why have you failed to look in the eyes of grace everybody don't see grace you know everybody don't have a true revelation of grace if we had a real revelation of grace we'd be careful on how we judge others we'll be really careful because we'll understand grace is unmerited it is something that God gives us all for nothing because he choose to and we want grace we don't want law we want grace I think I was telling somebody the other day I said you know a lot of people at the Day of Judgment because we be the queen of heaven because we're sent with Jesus and how the Word of God says how will we judge why do you think God takes to the the highest fall of himself and he places it in the worst age ever Laodicea he comes along and he places himself in a people that comes out of the worst age ever because if anybody is going to understand grace it's going to be you and I that's why the scripture calls us Lady Grace and when we come to the judgment we're not one that will be standing there or sitting there sitting everybody to hell will be there standing as Lady Grace you and I would be one who was a lord remember when they gave me a cup of water Lord remember Amen when they helped me when I couldn't help myself Lord remember this one see you and I must understand Amen we're there as a helper he saw what do you mean remember the story I always forget this man name but the Prophet God said that he had a dream and he went to heaven and he couldn't get into the gate and the angel at the gate Gabriel told him says you know what you the only thing I know is I don't I can't find your name on the book so now you've got to go through the white throne judgment and he said as he began to travel he began to move father and father and father he said the light got brighter and brighter and brighter all of a sudden he came to a place and he said the light was so bright and he heard a voice call his name and asked him a question have you ever lied before he said he had to think for a moment and he realized yes yes I have a lie have you ever stolen he said up to that point I guess he thought here but then he found out that there were times in his business actions he weren't wasn't so correct and right and it went on like that and then all of a sudden he said I was just thinking in just a moment time he's gonna say depart from me but he said he heard in the background father I can't think of his name Paul but he said father this man stood for me on earth and today I'll stand with him and he said it was the sweet as far as he had ever heard sweeter than a mother's boy he said hallelujah think about it we're on a mission but if we forget Grace we forget our calling God chose you and me or you and I to run a race in a in an age where it's full of hatred malice in thee where the fruits of the enemy is at its peak hatred on everywhere violence and God takes a individual like you and I to reflect him self in such a wicked age hallelujah you don't even know God until you know love because God is love and I'm not talking about some filial love I'm talking about agape love hello we're on a mission and Paul says listen I'm not telling you that I've comprehended this thing I've apprehended excuse me he said but I'm on my way I'm pressing toward that lock you understand me we're pressing toward it but somewhere down the line we must achieve it it must stop it must come to an achievement it must come to a place where that lock become us and we become the mark that divine love must overwhelm us oh not in just talking speech but let me say it like this all of your worldly knowledge will never accomplish it you can be the smartest man in the world yet be the dumbest hallelujah because education or worldly education doesn't get you anywhere only the knowledge of God hello is the thing that you need and the wisdom with that knowledge you understand me because the Bible said that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom good understanding of all they that do His commandments and his praise endureth forever imma read another one the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction hallelujah come on the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of Holy One is understanding for meaning the days shall be multiplied and the years of that life shall be increased if thou would be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou Scone it thou alone shall bear it in other words amen you can have the knowledge of a DDD and ldd but what good would that do you if you come to learn all of the the theories of science and quantum theory and whatever more they got out there without God you have no wisdom you just have knowledge and that's not the kind of knowledge God wants you to have this knowledge came by education God knowledge come by wisdom and wisdom come by God hallelujah you see you can be as dumb as a doornail hallelujah but if you have wisdom you know God because wisdom is the beginning the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom scuse me and so when you come to a place and then and you fear God God will give you understanding of who he is you see that's why God took so many illiterate and I'm not pushing illiteracy but I'm trying to tell you in there it is not all that the world emphasizes sometimes we get so distracted because we want approval but the only one that we need approval of is God acknowledge the Lord in all your ways that's why you can have everything set in order you can have the instruct man's instructions on a page but if God takes you a different way you come out better going God's Way then then what's on the page and like are you understanding what I'm saying not pushing illiteracy I think a man if he's got the intelligence to be a doctor or lawyer a president or scientist whatever that is he has a right to achieve in this world whatever he can achieve you see what I'm saying but what will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul the most important thing in this day is the Holy Ghost which is the wisdom of God it is God hello is that right because I'm going to tell you something with God wisdom you can achieve whatever let me put it this way Daniel was a very intelligent man intellectually wise he was so smart he was the one who instructed the wise men it was his teaching that made them look for star and found the star and followed it Daniel in his day was the wisest man in the kingdom but it wasn't his education where did Daniel contribute his wisdom he gave it back to God even when he interpret the dream is as God you know with all things not Daniel I know it God you know it and everything that I understand has been revealed by you you won't God to work on your job you won't God to work in your school you want God to work in your home wisdom wisdom from God will show you how to make it work hallelujah remember that man bring them say he tried to cast the devil out his wife tried to kiss the deck he that's not how you do it brother he said go get her some flowers go get her something you know she like and then give it to her y'all understand me when you come to a place where all of your education is bouncing off the wall ask God for some wisdom show me Lord how to make it work you don't say oh whether it's on a job with us your boss man whether there's wisdom and the reason why we fall and knock topsails up against the wall because we fail to acknowledge the Lord in all of our ways we fail to ask God for the wisdom we all are brother we're on a mission and our mission let me read this so you can understand where I'm working trust the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding our reasoning will always get us in trouble it will we think like men God don't want us to think like me God wants us to think like him and the only way we can think like him is to inquire here of him his thoughts so he can direct us by his thoughts and not ours who I feel like shouting or if I don't feel God I see God is in the place in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path whether your ways are good whether they're bad acknowledge him and he shall direct your path is that right it's the truth it's the truth be not wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil and whenever we take it upon ourselves trying to figure it out guess what more than likely you're going to come up in such an evil way it's not going to work because you are not your own you bought with the prize and God wants his thoughts to be manifested through you and not yours hello this mind be in you see we're on a mission I'm getting to the point in just a minute because we were with y'all on the individual yes but each and every one of us is supposed to bear the fruits of God's divine nature is that right in other words you're not to have temperance and I have patience I'm supposed to have it all do do you understand what that chart is saying Jesus Christ at one point he was a fullness of God now God has made us individuals the fullness of himself Oh somebody help me here that is divine nature that guy was telling the church earlier I said guess what because you are a poor only Appletree doesn't mean that you're gonna be the biggest apple on the tree every one of those trees every one of those apples amen they came from the same life they hanging on the same tree and there are various differences in those apples one may be bigger than the other one may turn redder than the other one one might have a little more green than the other one but they all apples hello and you must realize by God's grace that that's what we are like I said last week remember those old schools they used to have they didn't have sections everybody every grade was in one building and the teacher if you was on the third grade second grade all the way up to the 12th grade they had to teach all those kids in one class that's how it is in church everybody ain't on in the same grade and you can't expect a third grader to understand what the 10th grade or ninth grader understand but they all are in school and they all are maturing and they all will at some point reached the same level it is okay so what I'm trying to say is this we're on a mission what is our mission i'ma get today in just a moment because if we fail to see we are appointed for a purpose and that purpose is to to reveal Christ not tomorrow today he's the same yesterday today and forever like the prophet of God said we're so keen to look at what God used to do and we know what he's gonna do but we fail to see what he's doing now what is God doing in your life now well you can glorify Him who I tell you how we supposed to handle problems in the Old Testament get Shadrach Meshach and Abednego guess what God planned the fire he set him up but God was on a mission and God through men expresses his attributes here he uses you to express his thoughts for that moment or that time hallelujah and so you got to realize he meant that there was no way Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was going to get out of the fire without going into the fire because that was the purpose of God there is no way you're going to get out of a trial if God has ordained that trial you're going through it but your attitude in the fire we determine how long you stay in the fire when okay you say that's oh let me go to the new Peter James and John thrown into jail hallelujah and while they were under pressure while they were in jail hallelujah they wasn't singing why me Lord whatever I ever done there is no blues singing in heaven there are there is no blues songs hello in heaven and if I in heavenly places there's no glues don't sing the blues God checked me on that I'll sing a song at harming a desert and and I like the song and I really really liked it until I saw a quote a brother branham saying now I remember Amen at that harmony in the desert and I enjoyed it but everybody was crying alright I'm in this trial I'm so back slidden every song nothing was real praise nothing was real glory not dead I thought oh my god and in one man I thought I was the only one thinking like that and one young man at the end of all of the things that's why do we sing all these slow song and he said do we sing all these sad slow songs and everybody leaves do young people leave out I say death exactly right I thought of myself if I went participating I may have left out too you see but it was something gone unawares you cannot convince people of joy when you completely sad yourself your trial is not there to make you sad in all things give thanks your trial is testing you your what you going to every one of us me every one of us everything we go through when it comes down to a trial God want to see if you gonna murmur and complain or will you give him things did you know that's why the children Israel did not make it to the promised land because they murmured and complained everything God did they complain eat enough bread oh I'm thirsty too much meat nothing satisfied there all they could see was the bad part of their trial and they could not even see that their clothes was not wack Oh and their shoes weren't wearing out Satan pointed every bad aspect of that battle to them and all they could do was complain about it and they didn't see the good part that none of them worked for that meet none of them work for that bread hallelujah hey man you see that it's just just no God could not satisfy this is salvation it would have been best if I'd been left out in the world I left out in Egypt then to go through all those trials let me tell you something in this world you're gonna suffer your mines will suffer for Jesus because he's the one that's giving you the positive reward you ain't gonna live in this world and not suffer I don't care of you the richest man in the world are you gonna suffer hmm you you and I must understand we got to press through these things you heard me I think it was Winston saying you gotta elbow your way through this huh you gotta pull your way the devil ain't gonna make it easy for you when God gives you something and tell you okay I want you to go listen don't you know Jesus is that Simon's house oh I gotta go to Simon's house but that's Simon's house he's a Pharisee he gonna kick me out they know I'm a prostitute right God put things in your way and he looks for you to elbow your way through it fight through it hello listen when you were born into this world it's not easy you gotta press your way through that channel hallelujah amen with the forces of your mother's womb pressing on you you've got to push you got to press hallelujah guess what your head get all out of whack pressing through that channel hallelujah oh you say well what do you mean Jesus said I am the resurrection understand every time God tells you to do something it's not going to be easy he's gonna put an obstacle in your way huh Mary Martha I want you to know I'm putting an obstacle in your way yes your brother has been dead for days he stinks he's rotted but I have a purpose for it I want you to understand by revelation and by sight I am the resurrection and if I'm the resurrection I'm God hmm not resurrection tomorrow resurrection today and I believe that I believe that if we hold faith if we really grab a revelation of faith God can work faster for you huh you don't charge the word when married Martha she could save a lot if you had been there don't you realize we waited on you hands and foot you came to our house we had cooking fried chicken and all kind of stuff right we served you and when when I needed you you wasn't there bad attitude you don't charge God and you know what all she could say is lord if you had been there she she copped off our way of humility lord if you had been there my brother Lazarus would not have died then Jesus was able to talk to her because he saw her with the right attitude guarding talking to you with the bad bad attitude I don't care how faithful you must have the right protocol coming to Christ right am i making sense we're on a mission we're on a mission every trial every test we're going through is to glorify God and God let me tell you like this God do not grade you all occur and he's not gonna promote you until you get the lesson huh he's not like these educational people nowadays said pushing people through school there's no one left behind and they 30 years old and can't read and write no God is not that way you gonna learn it now in my day in my school if you didn't learn it guess what oh you can't spank them those teachers put it on you there was no such thing oh I didn't get my homework where you don't get lunch you're gonna do your homework doing lunch and if you don't forget it all done then you staying after school and if you don't get it done after school after school by the time I'm ready to go early in the morning you better see me in my class you didn't get away with this and they spank you and then sent you home so you need a second I'm telling you - they made you learn now I'm going to and that's the way God is God is gonna make you learn he's God he do love you he care for you and the whole purpose of this whole battle is is to make you like he is you he's bringing you into it Oh Lord I want to be so much like you do you realize you asked him for suffering hello is that what he said you must first suffer with me if you're gonna reign and none of us want to suffer but you're going if you gonna reign you gonna suffer hello and God don't tell you everything right like I tell people I said did you know Jeremiah he went on to say Jeremiah he said I knew you when you was in your mother's womb I called you to be a prophet I called you I knew your name I formed you and God never told Jeremiah how much he was gonna suffer he didn't know he had an idea but he didn't know he's gonna be beat up all the time everywhere he went you know people were gonna stone and do whatever they can Jeremiah lock him up like an animal I just say old Jeremiah I'm calling you but you I want you to understand you're gonna be locked up God don't tell you those things he didn't he didn't tell Moses when you get down to Egypt to deliver the children I got to Janis and jammers they're gonna be waiting on you God didn't tell Moses one thing when it comes to faith God wants you to believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him am I making sense now he said this woman who knew she had a need when you know you have a need let me tell you something wait wait it's the saddest thing about it when we come to church we always come to get something but that woman who's a prostitute she may have had it in the back of mine she wanted something but she didn't come to God empty-handed she came producing something she came to church with something she came and then with something to serve God with and we'll come to church and we just want God to give us everything and we don't give him nothing we don't give him praise we don't give him hallelujah you know what I'm saying we I'm saying generally but there are those who come but when you come to church you supposed to bring something with you bring some praise bring some Thanksgiving bring some anointing bring something to give to God and when you bring something to give to God you don't have to open your mouth he would then say what would you have me to do as simple is it you don't have to ask him he already knows what you need but when you come not being selfish you come to give God worship you come to give him praise you come to wash his feet shout who praise God when nobody else is doing it you go get somebody he's the same yesterday today and forever and he see that you are you have you're on a mission every Church time you come to church you ought to be on a mission a mission to entertain him not to be entertained but God going to always put something in your way he's not going to make it easy for you oh you know sometimes our family baby's awesome that cripples you here's a time in your life you got to grow up and be a man or be a woman or whatever it is you got to take the links you got to take the punch because that attitude won't work with God hallelujah when God said cry God's sake grow up and God gonna push you through it even if you don't want to go y'all know what I'm saying let me say it like this I I see no terrible thing in my life I thought it was the worst worst thing I ever seen my brother and his best friend start fighting and my brother I don't know who started it I got down there after that started back in the day when friend's fault everybody gathered around and made sure to fight with fair they didn't break it up because they knew they were gonna need this somewhere down the line you needed to know how to fight I didn't understand the concept my brother kept trying to get out of there my brother said get back in there blood everywhere boys Elementary boys beating each other today bleeding but it took the fear out of them it made them young man and I don't mean no harm when my brother grew up he was a terror every time somebody heard the name Mickey they backed up because they knew he was a hard cider my brother when he was fight he take his shirt off to make sure the enemy had nothing to grab and he went at it youngster but what happened every time I saw him in a fight I saw him as a boy feeling sorry for it thinking my brother's them they were so mean why they doing their duty who but did you know what those two boys have to finish fighting still remain friends needless to say my brother didn't win but God took they took they took the fear out of him cuz the other guy was a little bigger than him you know but my point is there was a lesson in that there was a lesson I didn't have that kind of a conflict I didn't have that kind of fight and then when I got into seventh grade I had three guys jumped me and beat me good bloody for no apparent reason they miss they think they did I was somebody else hello God took care God took care there then came making what it's the truth y'all who believe that I'm telling y'all some even then God was taking hallelujah now let me move on to say that even when I was a sinner if God battled for me what about now even David don't be afraid to pray like David I said God David prayed like this so I'm praying like David avenge me of my adversary huh you say I can't pray like that God said David was a man out there Zhan ha avenge me of my adversary but when you pray like that you got to believe it that God is now working in your behalf and your enemy is under defeated phone hello I don't give is your boss man I don't care who it is you have a right oh you say brother instead ain't right god is love but the Bible says this God hated Esau and he loved Jacob I was trying to tell her brother the other day I said God don't love everybody cuz everybody is not here hello it was God who destroyed those enemies why brother Branham said like this he said listen he said you've seen me in battle he said but you've never seen God in battle he said won't you wait till you see God in battle God will fight for you you put him in the battle you stay behind you let him fight your battle but you gotta believe he's gonna find it I believe it you and I are on a mission and we will not return back to God voice we were not returned back to God defeated God put enemies he put enemies in our way not the countdown to him but to defeat them by way of what path by allowing God to fight your battles you've never seen brother Branham with his fists up like that God told him say listen if you don't move and go out west you're gonna beat this man up gave him a vision brother that'll beat this man in this vision kicked him all down the hill and everything all all over a tree that the man wanted to cut down in his yard and brother Branham didn't want that tree cut down and God said if you don't move you're gonna beat this man just like this you better go out west now when you see this happening when you see the things coming into your heart in your yard move huh Oh what you saying I'm saying right now even with the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost didn't stop you and hold you you would be you would take certain things into your hands don't mean you ain't got the holy gold it's just that you got out of the way young it's the truth but our mission is not to reflect ourselves our mission is to reflect Christ it is Christ that you come you are not made for nothing else you might be a a teacher a lawyer a doctor whatever they may be but your God intended you intended for you to be the bride of Jesus Christ for this hour and reflect him home there that's why you must die daily you got to die if you don't pray God killed this old man don't let your lawn to the bar with me throughout the day Oh God have you seen me step out check me and bring me back in it gotta be a constant prayer it's got to be a constant forgive me not forgive me Lord I'm sorry help me Jesus that's daily everyday am I the only one I'm on a mission and I cannot afford to allow the devil to trip me or to hinder me which he can I mean you you basically saw you know God raising up sense and Hort Nazarite from birth and you think it was gonna be easy you and I have no idea the battles that Samson went through oh we can see him carrying the gates of Gaza Gaza however you want to pronounce it hallelujah hoho he took that job born of an ass and he killed was a thousand pal him up I don't know how many pounds he had but the point is it wasn't easy it wasn't like he didn't get tired it wasn't like that while he was fighting during the battle he wasn't asking God helped me give me strength gave me strength it was constant every every battle he calls for constant prayer constant calling on the Lord constantly a man you can never call him too much all of us I said down here and I preached the same message we know down in Iowa City but I told him I like I said like this 20:18 was the worst year of my entire saved life I've never had so many spiritual battles in my life you say what you mean brother books in every way financially naturally sexually when I got it there sexually about ready don't look like no saint to me I know what you are without the Holy Ghost we all battle in the flesh tell me a day you've got that goes by where sexual thoughts don't come to your mind and then I call you a liar it doesn't mean entertain it it's gonna come to your mind you got to realize that the god of the world is about sex God took you and said Pete a chaste virgin in the sick dark world where everybody is being overload with sexual things some of the books you go to the store they back then they call it pornography now they got it on the shelves naked women and men and it just grosses me out when I see a man with his shirt off holding his baby that grosses me I'm sorry some of y'all did that but that does I don't understand the contact if it was a woman that's some different but my wife will tell you none of my children that I know of have ever seen me with my shirt off why cuz you naked a loo but anyway that's my wisdom hello what are you saying children remember things and understand everything you do is by inspiration of a spirit everything you do and understand Amen that nakedness is nakedness it doesn't matter brother madam said that that there are certain ways we should dress in our house we shouldn't go certain ways in our own house why because of angels we don't see them but they see us I just don't go around the house certain ways I remember I remember one time I took a picture my shirt off in my phone and my grandson got my phone and they laughing him and his sister I'm thinking you know a before and after but this one away this was the before picture and to me I look gross ah and I'm telling you when I realized they were looking at my picture I honestly felt like I had been raped or molested seriously that's how serious I took it and I was so angry literally I could have done something but God kept me and I was about to cry and I said to you I said I said to my grandson it's bad enough you were looking at it but then you show it to your sister hello don't you know that imprinted her mind yeah maybe I'm too much of that I don't know but it's just a way I made I just know when I was a child I walked in and saw things and those things are still in my mind hello I didn't understand what I saw but I remember seeing what I saw and for some reason I automatically knew what I saw was not right still in my mind 60 2 3 whatever years old I got off on that I'm sorry but let's move on we are on a mission right I don't give me a few more minutes I took kind of went off on that but give me a few more minutes minutes listen you and I must understand we are the greatest secret of God it's exciting me we are the greatest secret of God in this day hello Mary was the greatest secret of God in her day if they knew she was carrying the Christ child even in her pregnancy Satan would have tried to get rid of her somehow some way and God told her you won't have a child and guess what God fixed it and made her rod that long distance on a donkey to Bethlehem hear them say in the time of her expectation she had the rydych you understand me it wasn't like a Cadillac it was a bumpy road it was uncomfortable come on somebody my wife Adele you when you are not that final stage things becomes uncomfortable she rode that that donkey and then when she got there exhausted and tired and ready for a room and ready to lay down and ready maybe her feet was swollen or whatever the case may be they tell them sorry there's no room in the air because God had a stable yeah see how God fixed it up God had a stable and in that stable is what Christ was to be born and she could have had an altitude God told me I was gonna have this Christ child but how can God put me in a manger a stable but cows and all of that you know what she more than likely never thought about it she never do and she probably never thought oh the lamb of God is born in a stable no no God was not working God was doing something that even Mary and Joseph didn't understand right because when the Shepherd's came and told them their experience in the field it is it alarmed them not when the wise men came pretty much so the same but my point is when the Shepherd's came and said we have had from these angels and they told us the Christ child y'all you and I'm saying God unfolded it as they went along and that's how most trials are God never give you the in until the in comes help me Lord let me go back to the great secret or mother to go listen brother em center like this in crisis the mystery God great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it that means you don't understand you you don't understand how God can give you a zillion times of repentance he'd ordered under how God can so favor you and you make mistakes all the time and then he puts himself in you anyway he see your attitudes he see and then your makeup and how can God who was so holy places himself into you and call you his bride how he don't understand it you the only one that gives him a tips by your mouth you tell Satan exactly where you are they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it none of the rest of them understand it but just those who are predestinated to understanding how God in Christ are one they'll make him three every time see they certainly will notice next secondly the men of the state manifested Christ in you the hope of glory the great benefits of God in Christ now Christ manifested in you you know what you said when I'm saying the focus is not on a Christmas tree the focus is not on a manger the focus is not a baby in a manger the focus is Christ in you and you and I are so folks of focus on this being that's growing up in us like a woman would treasure her baby you have to treasure your child treasure that being that's growing up in you that's one with you that's Christ that's Christ in you and you must feed him every day brother Balaam said the Holy Ghost feeds off the word and if you don't feed him the word every day you're going to get weak and when you get weak your language is going to change the way you see things are going to change your vision will become blurred mmm oh come on not one negative thoughts should come to your mind and if it comes to your mind that means you got a you got a rooster let it roots there you're supposed to kick out those stocks because just as soon as you don't keep those thoughts out guess what its gonna do it's gonna drop to your heart and out of your heart your mouth that's gonna speak and then your mouth is gonna condemn you huh notice he's a second of metaphors Christ in you what is it daily I'm supposed to focus on me the Christ in me daily what do you need what do I need to bring this man to a maturity let me feed on Christ the mystery of God revealed he did you all do need some Jezebel religion whatever the word is is that right the word the Prophet tells us that this message is stored up food and if you don't eat it if you don't focus on it if you don't meditate on it concentrate on it amen you're going to miss the purpose help me Jesus look what was God wants God great secret let me tell you something you don't have to let's put it this way it's a known fact that most things that are healthy to eat is nasty it is not appealing to the taste hello but the Word of God should be appealing it should bring us joy but it ain't gonna always be sweet it's gonna be some bitterness day Wow because the Word of God is going to discern it's going to separate the light from the darkness it's gonna cut you is gonna go down to the marrow your bone and don't you know mama don't hit me again oh you don't say that the momma hit you oh you ain't seen nothing yet y'all know what I'm saying and sometime God tries to make you cry cuz you're so hard in your heart and we're like a stubborn I ain't crying don't you know when that happens the parent says I got a strike him harder because I realized there's a stubbornness there I'm trying to get you to break because when you break it's gonna be better for you I know I've reached the inside I know I've cut loose that spirit you understand me that same spirit that is read that is stubborn right now it's the same thing that makes you rebelling against me so I'm gonna spank you until I get you down on your knees to look up that's a good parent spoil the child ball to spare the rod you spoil the child if I said beat him with that rod you ain't gonna kill him nowadays they're killing them though you know what I'm saying but you see we've been taught you do not whip a child in anger but when you don't correct him you are bringing forth a generation that will not be used to correction hello is that okay I'm going on with it but God great mystery what the eternal God had as a mystery has now unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to the church what was once in God's mine is now in the body of Christ Jesus make that's what he said this whole message that I'm giving you is Jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her how you go how you gonna make love with God and not read his word or listen to it huh this ain't this ain't no yeah we don't even understand what he's doing he's bringing a real creation a new creation he's literally pouring his divine nature in you by victory victory victory victory he's showing you and then that if you trust in him he will bring you to every victory hello he told those children of Israel when they were marching around Jericho don't open up your mouth why no doubt he knew that the journey wasn't easy the flesh don't like to be corrected and if Satan can just get you to say oh I'm walking in my feet hurt you see it wouldn't be that you don't have a cause because your feet hurt but he says don't even say that oh I'm so thirsty don't even say that I instructed you to walk around and not say nothing because just out of your mouth you can give the scheme away oh I'm gonna read a quote and I'm gonna let you go I read this last week but hallelujah is this okay you and I must understand that my pad just went out so imma close but wait I know what I'm working with we're working with perseverance it means to be consistent hmm Amen consistent now I'm not not as smart as this young man here I heard he he do really good in school he's got one of the memories right make you want to do a little judge judge by blood transfusion but nevertheless he's gifted and it's okay brother it's really nice to be that way I thank God I didn't have it like that cuz maybe I wouldn't be here you say god knows what to do with some of us some of us can handle that and some of us cannot right I get excited when I can say big words sometimes I did I didn't even know I knew that but anyhow God knows how to work with us right but we must be consistent supposedly I'm a B student or a C student and I want to make an a well I must be consistent in my studies because I know my level of comprehension I can't miss a day of school right and I can't miss time of study I must be consistent in my study because I have a goal I want to make an aim y'all hear me that's the way it is with God you got to be consistent I have a goal in this manifestation of karzai I don't want to come up to godliness and stop there not even brotherly kindness you know my goal is love total divine love operating faith and all the other virtues everything I do I want it to be motivated by God's divine love so I have a mission I've been ordained for it I've been built for it so have you you built for it but you not must understand there's an old man that's gonna always tried to stop you it's almost like in the days Amen when when Nehemiah and all of them was trying to build a wall Hezekiah and y'all y'all know what I'm saying they were all up on the wall trying to build everything in Sanballat was the distraction they will have breeds they were people they men and when I say that I mean they were people and then was half - and half not God came camera half he want the home he don't want us to be influenced by the knowledge of good and evil hallelujah he wants us to have the knowledge of him in him only the tree of life must live in you is that Alright he must live that's why he said you must God daily all of us got to die in order for Christ to live but you must persevere you must be consistent consisting in your prayer consisting in your fasting consisting in your study in other words God must become your all in all Jesus the most brilliant men ever surpass Einstein he was infused man fact there's a God forgot his name smarter than Einstein I can't think of his name in a rich he got it smarter than Einstein yes but where's Stephen Stephen there no Jesus he may have been able to look into the future and ohohohohoh America you in trouble but what good is data which could have done that not down in the main but my point is if he didn't know Jesus he's not in heaven hallelujah but he didn't get there that's smart by not reading or studying or sacrificing his time huh he had a goal and he set that goal in place and he worked toward it you don't get your master's degrees that your doctors agree but not attending school or going nowhere to learn more you said I'll go hey I'm coming down to the end of my goal because at the end of my goal I have learned I am NOT a doorkeeper I am NOT a doormat I am NOT a servant I'm a son and so are you sons and daughters of God your goal is not to be a servant your goal is not to be a doormat your goal is not to be a doorkeeper your goal is to be a son where God can sigh saying this is my son in whom i will please to dwell in coming to a full adoption where jesus christ can say well done hello my mission and how do I get there by carrying my cross by suffering for the name of Jesus because Jesus says if you suffer with me you reign with me I am NOT on a picnic I am NOT amen on it don't go to a pair of ease no sir God called me in this aid you and I in this age so he could reflect to this wicked world is that right he said listen I'm gonna let you know the test is gonna be trial your your trials who's going to be test really hard is that right he's a guest one your phone will be of your own household your enemy will be of your own household how you going to deal with it now with Jesus still be your all-in-all are you gonna love him in spite of all your trials are you gonna trust him folks I ain't like Paul I have not yet apprehended but I press it's difficult it's hard but I got my mind set on Jesus and I might stumble I might fall but I gotta make it if I got an elbow my way through every critic through every sound barrier you know what brother Adam said about the sound barrier he said the sound barrier is that space between unbelief and faith when you got the devil telling you all kind of stuff and you and you all I got faith but that ain't where you spirit out is that's not where you are if you listening to the sounds of the devil the words of the devil and everything you you you you're not dared faith yet huh unbelievers hear the sound barriers here and faith is here he said faith has no sound barrier you don't when you got faith you listen nothing the devil saying you don't even hear him you ignore him hallelujah he's in the back of you not the front of you nor even on the side of you you ignored that you don't hear him you just got your eyes focused right you see that's what it was Peter says Lord bid me come he asked in faith he walked in faith but all of a sudden his faith dropped now he's in the sound barrier oh you're gonna drown look at the winds all the waves did you notice the clouds and he took his eyes off of Jesus and he began to sink but don't worry God has his hand reached out I didn't even realize it one day until I heard a man preach about it I think it was brother cadre digs he said Peter quit right at the arm reach of Jesus he began to sink Jesus didn't have to say run up to and say oh he's still a frog justice let me go get him all jesus did was and that's what the devil did does he wants you to quit right at the moment when he's getting ready to pull you up but let me say it like this all you got to do is says oh lord have mercy on me we're on a mission and our mission is to reflect Jesus Christ not ourselves they ain't no good thing about your flesh it's already condemned don't even think your flesh is gonna be good your flesh is evil and if it gets rule is gonna want you to do whatever oh I'll never do that don't you ever say that because you are capable of doing everything anything of the flesh the only people that keeps you from doing a lot of things is God himself no Constitution don't mean a thing if God is not holding it oh yeah oh yeah God is the God who keeps the soul aren't we happy tonight cuz I know I know God is good to me I feel pain I feel hurt but it's oh it only goes here sometimes to my spirit but never to my soul my soul is sealed by God and I'm gonna tell you something that's the place Satan can't reach me and I don't care how many times I fall in my spirit and fall in my flesh my soul keeps saying go ahead boy go ahead you can make it you got it you gonna make it ain't no quitting in my soul I can't quit I've come too far let's tan oh think about it God told Joshua say you gonna go over there neck in that uh in that everything that you place on your feet is yours but you gonna have to fight for it I don't need you know Joshua thought oh I'm gonna be okay you know praise God I know I love the Lord and huh and then what happens Here Come a can messin up it je what thousands of souls done what in the world's going Lord right that's the way it doesn't necessarily mean you did something wrong maybe somebody else did something wrong or maybe no one else did nothing wrong and God is just trying you at the end of the day you must understand God is in control he's in control he's got it all under control but he wants to see how much do you really love me are you willing to go all the way with me like you said in the beginning huh the children literally thought that and then they began to murmur and complain about everything God said and how did that hold you and only two of them came up right be that to be one of those two hmm take God at His Word love him because people that ain't gonna get no better it's not going to get better maybe this try are you going through my dough you may come through it but don't you understand when that one is over another one's coming anybody know what I'm talking about you over you overcome one here come another and sometimes you got three or four I'm coming into one time you feel like I'm in jail or I'm in jump you don't know what to do with the only thing I could tell you when everything stopped flowing at you keep your integrity just keep your integrity maybe that's all you got left everything has been stripped from you but understand God is waiting for that moment to reward you why because you saw him as being God and he that come to God must first believe that he is God and that he is rewarded those that diligently seek Him he always have a reward for you after the battle and when that reward is given to you guess what you forget how difficult it was hmm it's true every man that receive a gold medal he forgets how hard it was to get it after he's gotten it he might say oh yes it had to work hard but you don't remember the pain it's like a woman having a baby after she had the baby she don't really remember the pain in detail she just knew she had pain that's how it's gonna be when we get over Jana these little things that we've gone through you know Paul call and light afflictions that's what he said but in our lives we don't see it like that but Paul said that's like and when we get over there praise God it's gonna be worth it all telling you don't miss the saints of God we're so close to this thing don't miss it let go and let God have his way die to yourself die to yourself come to find out what God is doing in your life and why he might let you know he might be he may tell you ok I'm grooming you this I'm grooming if you he made he may not but trust him let's get back to that Scripture trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways and he will direct your path that's the true definition of wisdom let's pray father God we come before you it's humbly as we know how we thank you for your awesomeness you are God that change is not there is no way of running from battles because if they are deigned we must go through but as you have heard me say lord i don't mind suffering no my flesh don't want to but as long as I know that you're there I'll be alright you separated yourself from your dear son Jesus and Lord he said whoa Lord why has thou forsaken me so he knows what it means to be forsaken so he says to us I will never leave you nor will I forsake you he took that from me because I deserve to be forsaken but he was forsaken for me he was forsaken for us that we won't have to go through that's that that time of feeling forsaken thank you Jesus thank you for your amazing grace and help us help us that will forsake not each other in a time of need in trouble but may we continue in grace continuing prayer continuing divine love knowing father you have granted us the victory you promised us and I believe your word because you said whatsoever we ask and you'll name believing believing believing that we
