away [Music] just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall the gates began to Rattle voice began to call I hurried to the window looked down into the [Music] street expecting swords and torches and the sound of solders [Music] feet but there was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in John stood there beside me when she told us where she'd been she said they've moved him in the night none of us knows [Music] where the stones been rolled away but now his body isn't there we both ran towards the garden and John ran on ahead we found a stone in the empty tomb just the way that Mary said but the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell how and where they taken him was more than I could tell something strange had happened there but just what I didn't know don't believe the miracle but I just turned to go for circumstance and speculations couldn't live me very high cuz I've seen him crucify here and then I saw him die back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came for everything I pray promised him just added to my shame for when At Last I came to choic this I denied I knew his name even if he was alive it wouldn't be the same suddenly the air was filled with strange and sweet perfume light that came from everywhere grow Shadows from the room Jesus stood before me with his arms out open wide I fell down to my knees and I clown to him and [Music] cry he raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes love shining out from him like sunlight from the sky guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet relief and every fear I'd ever held just melted into peace [Music] he's alive he's alive he's the life and Unforgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's the life he's the life and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates

see that she rence her husband just pray precious father open this P again Lord come down and teach us your ways do in Jesus name amen amen you me seated now yesterday I started teaching about marriage relationship yesterday I started teaching about marriage relationships and the man was the most important part of that relationship and how a man was the most important port sorry important part of that relationship and we have to be very careful and we have to be very careful that we keep the man as the head of the house that we keep the man as the head of the house because in this day in this day we live in an age where people try and live equal we live in an age where people try and live equal oh listen to the radio about oh a long time ago now I listened to the radio a long time ago and psychology I was his psychologist on he was talking about at one time men and women knew their place he was talking about that at one time men and women knew their place and would stay in their place and would stay in their place would be the bread woman bread winner the man would be the bread winner and the woman would be sub servant him and the woman would be Subs servant to him but now he said but now he said when they come home when they come home the man is fighting his Corner the man is fighting his corner is fighting her Corner the woman is fighting her corner corner and the sad thing is all the children are fight that Corners as well and the sad thing is that all the children are fighting that corner as well that's all they see but that's all they see so we must be careful we don't take on board any of that evil rubbish so we must be careful that we don't take aboard any of that rubbish garbage you garbage and we got to be very careful and we have to be very careful in our relationship with each other in our relationship with each other it's up to man to keep it fresh it's up to the man to keep it fresh it's up to man to make the initiatives it's up to the man to make the initiatives and and he should make initiative to keep his wife in love with him and he should take initiatives to keep his wife in love with him and this is this is important and this is important because if you want your marriage to last if you want your marriage to last you have to do things to please your wife you have to do things to please your wife and your wife wants to respond to your love and your wife wants to respond to your love butless you prepared to work but unless you are prepared to work at it look at the situation your marriage is in look at the situation that your marriage is in for you wife a chocolate she need buy your wife some chocolates if she needs it if she on a doet that she's on a diet can you see what I'm saying can you see what I'm saying that's what a man should be doing that's what a man should be doing the man is told by God to do one thing the the man is told by God only to do one thing that's to love his wife love his wife as Jesus loves us as Jesus loves us and gave himself for us and gave himself for us this is important this is important because we want perfect marriages yes sir because we want perfect houses marriages marriages sorry we want we want perfect perfect relationships we want perfect relationships and so is God and so does God because when Jesus come because when Jesus comes if we're not ordering our relationship like the Bible tells us if we're not ordering our relationship like the Bible tells us well we will go one wants us to do we don't do what God wants us to do so that's the man that's the man the women well there's lot more written about them the women well there's lot more written about them written about them you're lucky you're lucky can we turn book of tus book of Titus it's in the New [Music] Testament he you probably know as you probably know before after Timothy after Timothy before Hebrews yes uhhuh filon Titus there we go you got there you you're all there anyone not there is anyone not there my wife will be proud of me my wife will be proud of me always stop before I find I always start before everybody's found it oh TI this start at verse three of chapter 2 the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not giving too much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed okay we go through that now we'll go through that now you see you sisters you need training you see you sisters you need training because you the young sisters Just Married the young sisters just married are inexperienced are in experience so the Bible says that the anges wom likewise that they being Behavior has become holess and false accusers not giving too much why teaching things that they may teach that they may teach the young woman you see all the sisters got experience all the sisters have experience they know to handle situations they know to handle situations and the the older sisters the older sisters are there to help the younger sisters are there to help the younger sisters to keep their marriages in in the state of survival to keep their marriages in the state of amen survival yeah amen one he the story about young sister to her mother and said Mom I a sort of divorce I remember story of a young sister phoning up her mom and asking her mother have you ever thought of divorce she said murder yes murder yes divorce divor for no but you see but you see God is all theer sisters to teach the younger sisters the thing they know to make their husbands love them God wants the older sisters to teach the younger ones to love their [Music] husbands some the things that the older teach the older sisters I suppos to teach the younger sisters let's look at a few things that the older sisters should teach the younger sisters they teach the young woman to be sober to be sober been drunk that doesn't mean drunk drunk sober drunk sober that means self-controlled that means self-controlled amen and some young sisters join get Own Way by going hysterical some young sisters try to get their own way by going hysterical oh and being sober is the opposite of that and being sober is the opposite of that and it's up to the older teachers and it's up to the older teachers the older sisters the older sisters to go to them to go to them at a proper time at a proper time and told them about what they do and talk to them about what they're doing and not forcing themselves on them and not forcing themselves on them but but but taking them the advice they need taking them theice they need taking them the advice they need and we must be careful and we must be careful that we don't putay on the pastor that that we don't put that on the pastor because he's no a woman he's not a woman he's he shouldn't be he shouldn't be right but because wom out there place because women out that place because women are out of that place we have women pastors today we have women pastors today amen oh yes the second thing did they teach a young woman to love their husbands can you imagine going into a a worldly place can you imagine going to a worldly Place sister say can I help you your husand and a sister would say can I help you to love your husband it would be a minor shell shock it might be a minor shell shock because people want to do what they want to do people want to do what they want to do do what they want and they do what they want no what the cost no matter no matter what the cost amen but the older women are called but the old to teach the younger women the older women are called to teach the younger women how to love their husbands how to love their husbands amen and then the next thing then the next thing how to love their children how to love that children yeah sister some of the baby and give can you can you imagine a sister going to a mother with a baby who is in a tantrum and give them advice get a mouthful back they get a mouthful back but but but if you want your marriage to flourish but if you want your marriage to flourish then then you want the older sister to come to here then you want the older sister to come to you you didn't know in the Bible did you you didn't know that this was in the Bible to be discreet to be discreet are you discreet are you discreet or you gossip in the neighbors or do you goship with the neighbors Chase Chase keepers at home keepers at home good good obedient to their own husbands obedient to their own husbands why why is Teach Me How How To Be Obed by husband I somebody teaching me how to be obedient to my husband I can't have that the Bible said the Bible says that young let old come to them the Bible says that the younger should let the older sisters come to them and help them and help them and teach them and teach them let the word of God blasphemed that the word of God will not be blasphemed you see this is so important this is so important to God we know women reflect the church we know that women reflect the church when I go to a church when you go to a church you look at the women you look at the women she it free see if they are free or in bondage or in bondage because if a woman is in bondage because if a woman is in bondage it will [Music] show and we must be careful we allow our s have freedom and we must be careful that we allow our sisters to have freedom they have the right to choose for themselves what they want to do they must have the right to choose for themselves what they want to do and if you present them atmosphere and you if you present them the right atmosphere they will choose you they will choose you amen go want you to do choose your husband that's what God wants you to do to choose your husband the husband he may be selfish that husband may be selfish but but the woman is still still submit to him but the woman is still supposed to submit to him there's a lot in this marriage marriage relationship there's a lot in this marriage relationship God wants you to to live this God wants you to live this I hope I'm giving I hope I'm g a lot of work to Sister Ruby because I didn't hear that I haven't I haven't given a lot of work to Sister Ruby I'm I'm sure she'll be able to cope with it be able to cope with it one Peter okay going one pet 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 1 see if you if you live with someone that's not a Christian if you live with someone who is not a Christian he's your husband and he's your and he's your husband then then you are called to submit your husband's de then you are called to submit to your husband still not your pastor not your pastor your husband your husband because God he made the manif not for the Bri God made the marriage relationship not for the bride but for everyone but for everyone and to me work of the flesh to me it's work of the flesh the work of the flesh when I'm the husband of the church when a pastor says I'm the husband to the church and start teaching crazy things and starts teaching all sorts of crazy things we must be careful careful we must be careful to stay balanced to stay balanced to stay on the nrow way to stay on the narrow way do that pray to God asking for Revelation wait for to give it and when you give it to you you got the truth and the only way for you to get it is to pray to God for Revelation and wait to receive it amen God and God wants you so into your marriage and God wants you to allow the Revelation to come into your marriage and you sisters and you sisters you like to wear Bly things you want you like to wear Bly things things in your hair things in your hair things broses roaches necklaces necklaces but what the Bible says but look what the Bible says who adorning let not be that outward adorning of placing hair and a wearing of gold or putting on of apparel that's first three of one Peter three he he says he don't get tied into fashion he says don't get tied into fashion don't TR look pretty in to forming clothes don't try to look pretty in tight forming clothes you don't be adorned with this but you have to be adorned with this and what's this and what's this first four is this first four is this I read it but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price a spirit a meak and quiet Spirit yes how women quiet Spirit how how how many got and quiet how many women have a Meek and quiet Spirit oh do you if you talk to them they give you mouthful back do you know any women that when you talk to them they give a mouthful back because this that want Christian woman shouldn't be that's exactly what a Christian woman should not be she quiet she she should have a quiet Spirit what spirit is is no no one where all s of inappropriate woman that not wears we not wear clothing clothing that's inappropriate and God wants you to to walk in it and God wants you to walk in it yes I think s oh oh I think that sisters are hard heart done by they see all these other women around them they see all these other women around them and and they wear all these clothing and they wear all these clothing which immoral which is immoral and they can't help feeding on it and they can't help feeding on it you go down the street see see BS with all sorts of things on because you go down the street and see billboards with all sorts of things on it so I would say pray for the young sisters I would say pray for the young sisters because they need to have a Meek and quiet here because they need to have a Meek and quiet Spirit yes and go more you to see that and God wants you to see that you want another yes 1 Corinthians 7 1 Corinthians 7 I some cies yeah conning the things have you got you got it have you all got it certain things all you me it is good from man nor to T your woman amen now I may say a few things here which may seem inappropriate I may say a few things here that seem inappropriate but you go to the doctor you go to the doctor and he he tells you the truth and he tells you the truth let me say this let me say this if I can't preach the truth if I can't preach the truth with respect to who I'm talking to with respect to who I'm talking to there something wrong then there's something wrong am so it is good for a man not to touch a woman it is good for a man not to touch a woman a psychologist a psychologist or a doctor or a doctor will tell you that man he reacts sexually to what he sees they will tell you that he reacts sexually by what he sees a woman reacts to touch but the woman reacts to touch and and so we we should take seriously so we should take this seriously it is good for man not to touch a woman it is good for a man not to touch a woman he's he he's enclosing something her because he's encouraging something in her as she dresses in in clothing that makes her sexual and if she dresses in clothing that makes her sexual she too will be encourage him right she too will be encouraging something in him and and is is up to us and it's up to us to choose our way to choose our way yes and God wants you to choose your one and God wants you to choose your way your way should be his way your way should be his way and his way I believe the best way and his way I believe is the best way amen and so here we see if you look to me and here we see that if you look to me if you look to me if you look to me I'm ugly man I'm probably an ugly man and no me no no no no one will look can look at me and get excited and and yes I'm a man but I'm a man but you sisters are women but you sisters are women and you got a choice you have a choice about what you wear about what you wear and how you present yourself and how you present yourself and you must if God Walk Right with God if you want to walk right with God you must dress yourself modestly dress yourself modestly see when the F when the full came when the fall came the first thing that happened the first thing that happened got clothed got clothed them because they were naked because they were naked and and else as well and I as I'm concerned as far as I'm concerned God what God going to be clo want everybody to be clothed yes and God wants us to see all and God wants to see wants us to see in our day what it says about those around us what it says about those around us wed they rched they wretched poor poor God blind naked naked and don't know it and don't know it so if they don't know it if they don't know it do you know it you know it because because I don't want be naked I don't want to be naked and not know it and not know it but there's a church somewhere but there's a church somewhere is naked that is naked and don't know it and we we got to walk in in this way we have to walk in this way he's good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication that every man have his own wife every husband everyone have own husband to avoid fornication to avoid fornication fornication fornication it's the worst thing that is foration it's the worst thing that is fornication Bible says flee fornication the Bible says flee fornication do you flee fornication do you flee fornication I remember was preaching town in England I I remember once preaching in a town in England and the Lord stopped me and the Lord stopped me and say foration in the congregation and and he said there's fornication in the congregation oh I said it so I said it and and I made an appeal and I made an appeal those who want prayer about it and those who want to prayer about it come forward come forward well to my surprise people started coming forward to my surprise people started coming forward because my surprise the reason why I say to my surprise is is because I really should say go to the pastor I really should say go to the pastor and talk to him in private and talk to him in private because if a woman saw husband go forward if a woman saw a husband go for forward then [Music] then it could wreck the marriage it could
