he alone is all we have Needham Amen if we feel like you have need of something else you're wrong amen amen because he is all that we have Nita he is the author of the finisher of our faith he's the beginning and the end and then he's the one that sowed the seed he's the one that brings the rain amen he is all that we have need of in this life's journey a man when he gives himself to you you have everything you have need of in this life's journey even the rapture amen let's just as we stand we'll open in our Bible to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 will read the eleventh verse in 12th verse and from there we'll go to Matthew chapter 24 and it says and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good hey man let's turn over to Matthew chapter 24 I want to speak a message called the power of the seed Matthew 24 verse 32 it says now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth his leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away Amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just approach unto you again this morning thanking you Lord for bringing us into this place safely Lord and soundly Lord I pray Lord as you've gathered the people here - this morning Lord that you also would see to it father they'd be fed Lord by your word just like when the three thousand or the five thousand gathered themselves together Lord you saw to it that they were fed Lord by bread that you provided Lord and so the same thing today Lord that we've gathered together in this room Lord Lord to be fed upon the Word of God and Lord we pray Lord that as as I preach this gospel Lord that there would not be my words Laura but yours alone father for only you are able to inspire Lord of the words of life father and Lord so we just submit ourselves the years of the hear and the mouth of the speaker we just submit ourselves to you right now in the name of Lord Jesus Christ knowing that you will see to it Lord that the people will be fed by your glory and by your gospel and the name of Jesus Christ we thank you lord amen hey man you can be seated Amen you is familiar with scriptures you know brother branham had a lot to say about the Word of God being a seat Amen he preached about it very frequently you know he had he preached that message of the spoken word of God is the original seat amen and I actually I have the book of that and I keep that by my table because it is a it's just one of my favorite sermons I just I love to read it frequently and I'll just pick it up and read glanced through it and read it through it quite a bit but one of the things that he said in that and that in that book is that the Word of God as a seat it is a seed that will bring forth of its kind you cannot stop it it is when God plants a seed he puts the DNA on the inside and God knows that when he plants a seed that whatever he put on the inside of the seed he has the same faith that a farmer has that went then it'll come up exactly what he plants you know when a farmer is planting his crops for the year he yeah he does it in complete faith that the type of seed that he purchased that he bought that that is the type of seed they'll come up out of the ground he doesn't doubt he doesn't worry you know I know there are the many people that if they were gonna say for retirement or something like that if they went and they took their their paper cash and put it down in the ground they'd have a lot to worry about amen because you know if they think that the water was gonna ruin it that the the paper would disintegrate and and after a while that if you went to go dig it up nine months later that he wouldn't find why he had buried it wouldn't be in the same condition amen and almost nobody if they had something really valuable would trust it to put it down in the dirt of the earth and expect that after nine months of rain and and frost and whatever it might be that after so much time that that if they could go and dig it back up out of the ground they would actually be worth more than when they put it in the ground almost nobody expects to see that but God is a little bit different than mankind Amen God has ways that are higher than man man's ways amen and he knows that when he puts his word in something that it cannot fail to come to pass Amen nothing can stop it Amen so what he do is he put his word in the seat and he sealed it as a as a sign forever that God's Word would bring forth of its own kind amen when God puts something down on the inside of a seat he knows that the generation after generation after generation as long as no one tampers with that seat it'll continue to bring you forth of his kind continue bringing forth of its kind amen he knows how in the last day where the attack come they came to a hybrid the seats that's what they the last day anointing of the devil was to come and attack the seats amen so you see back in the nineteen teens in the 1920s every farmer when he when he sowed his crops he would save his seeds over for the next year but then in the 1930s they discovered ways to hybrid seeds to bring forth better-looking plants that would look a little bit better amen and in the course of just a few short years probably no more than a decade that this country our country went from almost 90% of the farmers saving their seats to the next year at the beginning of 1932 when he got to 1940 probably as more like 90% of the farmers are now having to purchase their seeds for the next year because they are completely in the short period of time in about a ten year span of time that the farmers switched over almost wholly from 10% of the farmers using hybrids to 90% it was it was a very quick changeover and I would like to think about it this way right now that if we were to have to go back to using saving seats how many genuine seeds are left on the earth they have not been tampered with where are they we have taken hybrid seeds and spread them all over the world to the point now that that if we were forced to go back and try to find a seed that was a right in its generations you couldn't find it you couldn't find it amen you know it's just every seed has been tampered with to the point that how can they bring back forth of its same kind like God said they can't because they hybrid the seat I mean how can you find a you know late like if you go to the Living History Farms they have this plot of corn they say this is what corn looked like in the 1600s this is what I looked like in the 1900s there's what looked like the 1930 this is what looks like today and you see his progression of what corn looked like it went from being a bush you know 100 200 years ago to be in this one simple stock you know it's has completely changed why because man has tampered with what God now God originally said this is what corn is supposed to look like the man comes along and says this is what I think corn should look like and we can make it look better to feed more people he meant but God put his original in the beginning and there's this something about seeing something that is original a mint then it's the way that God intended for it to be God when God designs something and he designs it to be original then when you see that it's like mine like if you ever see a real Christian it does something to you you know if you you know I think a lot about the the Pentecostal movement you know like I grew up in Pentecostal movements and there is so much about they want to see a constant outpouring of the Holy Ghost constant constant constant to where it's a Holy Ghost movement every day of the week always over the congregation and I was what would that do what would that cause amongst the people it caused a pride to rise up every time every time a revival strikes a church it usually ends up with a moment a time of pride where they begin to rise look what we have done look at how at the the we prayed enough to have a revival Amen we we worked hard enough to to get this revival you know we did this or we did that and always up and it rival dies off and why is it God sent his spirit into the congregation and wanted to do it brought forth every seed that was planted in that congregation now they rejoice because the Holy Spirit is there in power but what they don't realize is actually the word went before the revival amen and also the Satan went forth with his word before the revival and two seeds were sowed in their church and maybe they didn't quite realize because he was a quiet time when the seeds were being sown and maybe they didn't realize it but then when the Holy Ghost comes they rejoice they shout they sing they dance they speak in tongues they need to do all those things and not realize that all that is happening is the Holy Spirit is just watering the seeds that were accepted before good and every seed begins to bring forth exactly the DNA of what was accepted in the meantime now for those that accepted the Word of God and his purity when the Holy Spirit comes it brings up in us that man starts growing and he starts growing and he accepts and he's he's just he's growing the Word of God amen but for the church that that constantly mixes this with the word and this with the word and this with the word when the Holy Ghost that church can receive a revival but when the revival does come what grows only the seed that is planted is what growth came and that is why it is important amen here like right here in this church we're in a quiet time they meant we haven't had a revival for a while I believe we're due for a revival payment we're due for a revival amen what are we doing though we're you know brother Branham he talked about the the the teaching rain the former rain in the latter ring Amen if you grew up in Pentecost you you hear that preach on over and over and over again talking preaching on the latter rain the latter rain and every every Holy Spirit outpouring there is they they preach about the latter rain amen why because the latter rain was to bring a power and a might and something that they could they could take Angele grab ahold of something they could enjoy something they could have something that they could use and sometimes used to lift their own selves up amen amen but but brother branham's were right in the middle of of the all-powerful latter rain movement Butler bram got up and started preaching you know you folks say that we're in the latter rain he says we're not we are in the former rain there's a you know brother Graham he had a lot of things that he did like that has like when right in the 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis buh-bam says don't fear communism you know and here everybody is looking at you know the Russians are putting nuclear bombs 90 miles from Florida you know all these things all these things that they're worrying about you know and and we're a prophet stands up and says don't worry about that worry about Romanism and now you can't get anybody to worry about communism you know now you can't now that now that people will welcome communism a man you can't gain way to fear it but just 50 years ago everybody was afraid of it but her prophets it up in the midst of that fear and said don't worry about communism worry about Romanism Amen likewise today who's worrying about rheumatism no-one's worrying about Romanism Amen but brother Brown said that one of these days in the last days that as soon as the latter rain does come it'll just bring a persecution on the bride amen they will bind themselves together tightly which they're hardly done amen and then what happens you know when brother when when Jesus preached about the parable of the tares he said that there was two seats sowed in one field amen and when the in came they bind the they bound the tares together tightly amen and they were bound together pretty tight I mean what nowhere where what happens when the terrorists were bound together the wheat is standing alone amen it'll look like we have no place in the church you know and that's when Butler Brown says that's when there will be a boycott why they're standing alone amen the Bride of Christ stands alone what is she standing upon the Word of God that she received amen she received a word now as we said there and we read there and Jesus said every word amen he said heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away he met said there in verse three before verily I say to you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled one thing that brother Graham stressed is every word must be fulfilled before the in comes every word has to be fulfilled amen so when you own you you when there's like you see the scriptures like there's a the Bride of Christ it'll be without spot or wrinkle that brought that that scripture has to be fulfilled it cannot fail amen so what are we doing we are storing up that word down on the inside of us because we know that seeds going to grow that seed is growing it's growing it's growing amen and it's going to what are we doing so while everybody else is planting various different hybrid seeds in their hearts amen we here are gathering the other seeds in our hearts that are from the Word of God amen that's why we listen to the tapes that's why we listen to the messages why because in this last day God sent us a message sent us a prophet a man what did that prophet do he says everybody thinks that we're in the latter rain we're in the former ring amen and right now as a teaching rain the cheechee is going out it's the Word of God he said Billy Graham is preaching his words amen Oral Roberts preaching his over here and I am preaching my message here for the bride they will receive it amen and all those words will bring forth exactly of their own kinds amen amen remember Amos 3:7 God says I will do nothing but what I show it to my servants the prophets first amen now now brother Brown was thoroughly vindicated amen amen when every time I hear one of those healing lights or I see one of those I see the Messiah signing action you know when when when when I when I see or when I hear brother Branham on the tape saying I'm gonna turn my back to the audience and he starts discerning the thoughts of the people and the prayers of the people with his back turned audience do you realize that he is recreating the same situation that happened in the time of Abraham in Genesis that he is recreating that scene over again amen where where he had his back to the tent behind him amen why is Sarah laughing in the tent behind him he's recreating that what did we see in our day and sometimes I wonder if we realized the met the power of this message that we've been giving us and how we ought to get these seeds down on the inside and receive them a member if we never listen to the messages how can we receive the seeds that were preached amen why because there will be a lot of rain and what will it do it will manifest everything that was sowed in your heart amen every seed that you brought forth into your heart will be manifested everything that you allowed into your spirit of your mind now remember how do seeds get in first first the seed has to come in through years a man through one of your senses a man it comes across the field of your mind and then you have a choice of accepting it or rejecting it amen and just like Mary every time you receive a seat when you hear the preaching of the gospel you consider your mind will you read your Bible when you're read when you're listening to a tape and you hear something it comes across the field of your mind you have to tell you have to tell yourself how much glory and honor am I going to give unto what I'm hearing amen how much preeminence in my life am I going to give to what I am hearing amen am I actually going to follow or listen to what I'm hearing or am I going to reject what I'm hearing amen every person has to make their choice amen every person has to make their choice what they will do with the Word of God that has been sent because when the Holy Spirit falls he only manifests what has been sown amen the Holy Spirit when it comes when the Holy Spirit comes and when he starts falling upon the church he's not there to bring the seed no the seed was already brought he's there to manifest the seeds that were already sown amen and all of us have received seeds amen and they will grow and bring forth after the kind of what their so if we are a doubter of the word then we know what seeds will manifest amen aim as black brother Brown says if you if you say you believe something but you are a but yours but your thinking your mind no I'll go figure it out later I don't know if that's true he says you better stop that he says you better make it settled make it sure now why because what you're doing is is you're not actually laying the seeds coming into your heart or your align a mixed crop coming to your heart amen and that will manifest itself Amen what else what will manifest itself doubt unbelief unsure there won't be any faith there amen it'll be nothing in there but there will be nothing in there where the Word of God can actually take root and grow in your heart amen amen let's go over to Deuteronomy chapter 11 we'll start with the seventh verse but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day that you may be strong and go in and possess the land where you go to possess it amen so and what Moses is saying here is your eyes saw the axe your eyes saw what God did your eyes were joint you saw how God came into the congregation amen he did things that were mighty in power your eyes saw of this amen now because your eyes have seen this that I want you to believe all the words that I brought you unto you to believe amen so if you're if you have seen the if you ever once see the acts of the Lord in the congregation if you ever once see the power of God coming upon the people if you ever once see God doing something in your life doing something that you couldn't do yourself I mean if you ever seek once see the hand of God reaching down into the affairs of men that there is a sign unto you amen but signs do not save you amen if you ever once see the hand of God reaching down from heaven and interfering with the affairs of men whether it be through healing someone or delivering someone or just saving you from your sins well there beyond the tape and back in brother brems day or here in your day if you ever once witness God doing something then that there is a sign to you amen is a sign to you to believe the word amen once you got when God shows you a sign it expects you to receive that sign and believe forever amen once you see a sign of God you are to latch onto that sign amen if it be a true sign of God you were to latch onto that sign and believe forever why because you've seen God in action you no longer have the ability to say well I God never revealed himself to me you know God like that the Red Sea God revealed himself to the people at the Red Sea God revealed himself to the people of Mount Sinai amen so that when they got to Kadesh Barnea they were to refer back to the power of the sign that went before them amen and you used that as strength to go forward and say I know the same God that was a witness to me back there the same God as sit with me and he'll lead me on through all the way amen and so is it the the bride has received her sign of brother Branham amen she she listened to the tapes amen she's received that sign then she used to go forth nest sign and believe so when she comes into entering into the promises she's supposed to march for I know the same God that was with brother Branham will be with me now Amy I know the same God that was there doing these mighty acts back in the 1950s 1960s Amy I know that that same God is right here he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still alive he still remains God amen amen and he we're supposed to believe that sign in March forward into all the promises of God amen let's keep going on Deuteronomy 11 there verse a says therefore show you keep all the commandments which I command you this day why so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land whether you go to possess it and then you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your father's to give unto them and to their seed a land flowing with milk and honey Amen you know there is supposed to be a bride in this day that is living comfortably in the promised land amen what is the promised land it's the land of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost in her life day in day out day in day out amen amen now God has a lot to say about this promised land amen now they were supposed to enter into this promised land and live there and be at peace amen they're supposed to bring their tithes and offering to the word those dalorto hey when they were supposed to go down and bring their sacrifice to the tabernacle a man they're supposed to do too receive the word from the priests amen they're supposed to have the slain lamb amen receive forgiveness of their sins they're supposed to frequently go back to the slain lamb over and over and over again they're supposed to have a slain lamb in the in the morning and evening every day a man and constantly referring back to the lamb those slain before the foundation of the world they're supposed to live at comfort in their promised land where all the promises of God are activated amen so how about you amen do you see the promises of God that manifested in your life are you are you abiding in him if you if you love me keep my Commandments amen if my if my word if if you're if my word abide in you amen you ask what you will and it shall be done to you that's the promised land that's the promised land of the most I got amen it's a land that's flowing with milk and honey amen verse 10 he's going on further to describe the land he says for the land where you go us and possess it is not as the land of Egypt it's not like the land of Egypt from where you came out of where thou sow a seed and that water sit with thy foot as a garden of herbs now what is sowing your seed and watering with your foot he's talked about irrigation back in Egypt it's a dry land amen and so they would take the water from the river and they irrigate it they draw trenches with their feet amen they let the water flow along their own man-made riches and they'd have their channels going so there they could have an irrigated garden that they themselves made and created amen but but the lore is saying this land that you're going into is not like that Amen you don't have control of when the rain is going to come amen for the land where thou ghost sent possess it verse 10 is not as the land of Egypt from winst out you came out of where thy was so slight foot and water sit with thy foot as the garden of herbs but the land whether you you going to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh the wall of the rain of heaven amen not some polluted river somewhere no it doesn't get the you're not gonna the gardens that are here in the promised land they're not like the irrigation of Egypt you're not taking the land of the of the polluted Nile of where they they do all their cleaning all their sewage and all that no no but the land the promised lands a little bit different it drinks from the water of heaven amen amen so if you ever get to a place where you're running out or rain you can't go out and work for it you can only look up to the heavens and trust God for it amen in order to be in the promised land they had to put themselves at the mercy of the most I got a mint and if God didn't send them rain they were gonna die and there's nothing they could do about it they had to trust and the most I got verse 11 but the land whether the hell you go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drink it's the water of the rain of heaven and the land which the LORD thy God care it's a land which the LORD thy God cares for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year you know I think I would rather have that land than any other land amen why now if you are a man of faith then you would prefer the land the promised land amen but if your amantha is maybe on the borderline or a half faith and half doubt then you would prefer the land of egypt because then you'd have some manner of control about whether you're gonna have rain or not have rain a man you were how we were preaching on tithes and offerings a while back about how about how wait there's something about abraham when he met milk his attack that caused him to pay his tidy amen and then we went from there over to the rich young ruler amen now the rich young ruler when he went to up to the Lord Jesus he came running the Bible says he came running up to the Lord Jesus and bowing down and worshiping him it sounds like a good church service amen he came running to the Lord Jesus and bowed down and worshiped him and then said oh good master well that sounds like a great altar call it sounds like we could really get somewhere with someone like this amen but when he going to go say good master he said oh I want eternal life this sounds like a really good altar call we're having a church service here but then when Jesus he's like Jesus starts talking to him and begins to he came to the word he asked the word a question what must I do to inherit eternal life what do I have to do and what the word dude the word started discerning his life I started going down into the inside he asks the question ask the word a question now the word is going to respond the word is gonna find out where the trouble is amen where the trouble is and what happened the Word of God found the trouble first the word he's starting to scissor knee says well just obey the commandments he oh and the man says oh I begins to begin to brag about himself a little bit I have obeyed all the commandments since I was just a little boy I have always done exactly what the Ten Commandment said I I didn't want to lie I didn't wanna cheat I didn't want to steal I didn't murder I did everything I was supposed to do and now the word is beginning to Zurn this man is this man as perfect as he says or not and he's like oh there's one thing that you're lacking there's one thing that is preventing you from getting this eternal life that you're here at the altar of seeking for a man what he wouldn't forsake all the one thing that he was lacking was he wouldn't forsake all he said Jesus told so Jesus had the answer for payment he said go sell all that you'll have all that you have then you'll have treasure in heaven then come back and follow me and he says Oh oh no I know I can't I he wanted the Lord to give him something that he could do he wanted to break to the Lord about how perfect he was but then he found out that even though he was a child of Abraham even though he's living in the in the land of Abraham and here he's coming up to the point and Messiah be it for all of that he couldn't do the same thing Abraham did because Abraham when Abraham came before Melchizedek he forsook all but here the rich young ruler is coming before the same milk as that Lord Jesus Christ and he can't forsake all so here he is a Jew of son of Abraham in the promised land declaring that he can't do the same thing Abraham did so he's not a son of Abraham he testified against himself amen and then the Lord went to another man by the name of Zacchaeus and I found him up on a tree and he said now is that kiyose was also a son of Abraham amen and he comes and sees a kiss-up from the tree and he says come down out of that tree I must sup with you this night a many and Jesus enters into Zacchaeus house and Zacchaeus begins to prove that he's a son of Abraham why he says Oh Lord the half that I give I sell and I give to the poor he says Lord if I've wronged anybody I restore to him fourfold he's being a showing he's a son of Abraham he's forsaking all a menu and here the Lord wanted the rich young ruler to give up everything was that kiyose only had to give up half and the difference is is that kiyose had already given up everything in his heart amen amen in order to receive the seed you must have good ground amen now we can cry for a revival we can we can jump up and down we can drag out the trenches and try to make a well watered irrigated garden and all that but ultimately the rain has to come from the Most High God and if the Holy Spirit rain ever does come it only comes to water the seed that was planted amen and if you and seed of God will only grow in good ground and good ground is a land that has forsaken all the rocks all the hard places a man's broken up the follow grant fallow grant it's it's it's broken up all the unbroken ground amen and what's doing it's made itself ready to receive the seed amen this land isn't like the land of Egypt but it's a land that God watches though the eye of the Lord watches over continuously always Amen it's a prepared ground land flowing with milk and honey if you will enter into it amen amen you know I think about Joshua and Caleb you know when we read there in Matthew chapter 25 the tears were bound together and the wheat stood alone amen you know it's hard to stand alone sometimes Amen you know it sometimes it would seem easier to join in with the tears amen and every person will have a situation in her life where it would seem easier to join in with the cares of this life or the things of this life rather than standing alone for God amen but a but a good ground jesus said the good ground would bring forth one hundredfold a man why because when the seed would fall upon it amen it could it could reproduce itself over the entire ground amen amen why because God is going to send the rain but the but only the seed that is planted will grow amen so Joshua and Caleb when they were first heard the word of Moses they like everyone else around them had to decide whether they would follow Moses or not amen and when it came to the time when everybody around them was pointing their finger at Moses and blaming Moses that Joshua and Caleb said no I am going to receive the word that God gave unto Moses and even though maybe it seems like we're running out of water maybe it seems like we're running a revival maybe it seems like we're running out of this or running out of that I am gonna stand here and I am gonna listen and be obedient to the word that Moses said Amen and Joshua and Caleb got to see that pay off in the end when they crossed over forty years later into the Promised Land Amen you know I think about it you know Joshua and Caleb they shouldn't have had to go those forty years you know they were raised going in forty years ago amen they shouldn't have had to but you know the thing about it is is they had a word that they rejoiced over the entire time and maybe all around them was testifying it there in the desert but there's something about the Word of God they'd receive that they you know they got to eat the man and they got to drink the water from the rock and God fed them all the way through and it was sudden about is that everybody has ever everybody around them was blaming the situation was blaming this and blaming this that Joshua and Caleb had their eyes upon the Word of God amen and tell you what let me tell you what they were in their promised land amen you know their their physical body may seem like they're wandering through a desert but let me tell you what Joshua and Caleb they were in their promised land already amen they already possessed it why because the moment they accepted it was the moment that it was given to them amen amen and God took care of them all the way through amen it's the same thing of any true believer of God a man doesn't matter even if the church they go to Amen they're not relying on the church they go to to bring them their revival amen they have their own revival Amen that they have prepared the ground for God to water his rain upon a man they've already heard the word Amen in the time of the teaching rain they heard the word of God they took their time to listen to the Word of God they took their time to hear the word of God and they said yes and amen - amen and then they took and looked at their land Amen they they took care of all the dirt all the rocks amen and they made their land a good ground by believing the Word of God a man what are they doing they're preparing for a time when God was finally gonna send the rain from heaven amen but you know there is another promise besides just set there was a promise from the time of David who says I will be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters a mint you know there are people that even in a dry desert place could still bring forth their fruit in due season amen remember David said I am like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen so when the when the dry time comes when everybody else is fading and withering rate you know Joshua and Caleb they experienced that everybody else was fading and withering away they were losing their experience amen the the the when the Red Sea was part of 20 years ago or 30 years ago is beginning to fade away in their memory about how powerful or God was but there was still a tree planted by the rivers of water by the name of Joshua there was another one by the name of Caleb that they are planted by the rivers of living water and they can always refer back to the power of God and clinging hold on to the Amen and think of it is is you know those trees are planted by the rivers of water always have in their mind to be able to see God's actions wherever they go you know it's like some people they can go out to the desert and they say boy there's just nothing living out here mm but you take someone who like a biologist's you'll see life all over that place Amen you'll see little footprints here just see this little brush or shrub here you see a little creek here there's things growing all over the place amen there's some plants that that it only rains once a year and it will take every single drop of rain you can get it and store it up amen amen so is it was a Christian they were the one plant will say Oh a dry place it'll just wither up and die but there's another one that will grab every single drop of rain and say thank you lord thank you lord thank you and what will it do it will not let a plant that is designed to operate in the desert will not let the lack of water will not let a lack of water in the congregation right amen it will not let a lack of water in the congregation prevent them from expressing what the DNA on the inside of them says it's supposed to Express amen why because that plant was ate was was designed to during the times of rain store up all the water necessary amen to get it through from one rain to the next ring amen so is is the same thing in Matthew chapter 25 with the wise and foolish virgins amen there was two different types of virgins one had more capacity for oil than the other hat amen so then there was a during the time of refilling of the oil the one only had what was in her lamp but the other had another capacity besides her lamp that she could draw from so that because the oil was only given at one time at the beginning amen and that oil one had enough oil to see her through all the way through amen and so it is with a Christian Amen it could seem like a dry time in the congregation of the Saints but yet they have a connection with Almighty God amen swear they will never run out of oil they are like a tree planted from the river water they have another reservoir to draw from the others may not seem to have a manson when the dry time comes hey what does it think they like like Abraham says when they tried to give him all the the riches of Sodom he says I will not receive the riches of song from you I don't need those to survive because I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah Amen he is my provider he gives me all I forsake and sought him I forsaken all the things that sought him I've lifted my hand unto Jehovah unto him i will seek amen and what'd he do he was a tree planted by the water he had this he had the the sign of his times was constantly growing anyway what'd he have he had a seed that was planted on the inside of him that was to manifest the age that he was living in so does the Bride of Christ she has a seed that was planted on the inside of her by a by a private messenger right a meant a prophet came in our age he planted a seat we heard it we listened to it amen and was a - what is that seed that seed is supposed to grow in good ground amen now many can choose how they will receive this message that was given to us and what type of ground because know now now a rain is going to come there will be a ladder rain they'll come in water the seat amen but remember when this ladder ring comes it will only manifest one the seed that's planted and to the seed will only grow in good ground so it will do us no good to rejoice over this message if we do not have a ground that is prepared to receive the message a man which would be a true heart of faith is the only ground that seed can grow in a man was to do you forsake all and receive Christ forsake all and receive crisis he was like such a simple message amen now this promised land is not like the land of Egypt but the only way we can get rain is for when God Himself sends it amen what is our duty is to receive the seed in good ground amen receive the seed in good ground amen and God says a ladder rain will come and when it comes it will bear fruit bear forth its fruit in its season amen amen you know as a they they they try to force a ladder rain and I've seen that you know I've seen so many people they try to forsake they try to manufacture a Holy Spirit rain amen but you know God you know if you had a bag full of the most noxious weeds seeds you can imagine in your ground and you thought you know I need to get those out of there before the rain comes amen then you better get those out of there because you don't want the rain to fall on the wrong seat amen you know that you know they they got a lot of all over the world they they're they're trying to keep weeds going from one area of the earth to another area of the earth because a weed that is kept in control in this continent over here effect like dandelions dandelions aren't native of the United States amen but the Dutch brought over some dandelions amen and now what dandelions have taken over the entire country amen so it's the same thing with with with us is people will receive seeds in their life that didn't come from God amen and they don't realize that that what was by holding on to those seeds that someone these days it is going to rain amen I used might think that these seeds are harmless but once you receive this some other see from somewhere else and you think oh it's just a little see it's just okay but you receive that in your heart you let it lay there then when the Rutte rain does come you're gonna get something that you weren't expecting amen amen brother Branham when he was preaching the message the endtime seed sign he said there's been a national teaching rain and you know that's true you know and every Christian gets that teaching rain time also he says he said there was also he says there's there's a revival going on what is it it's a sowing Amen he said you don't hear very much of Billy Graham no more do you or oral what about the rest of them you know the great revival fires not burning what is it it's the endtime seed sign the words has been sown what is it denomination will reap denomination and that makes them Confederate themselves together amen and we've seen that you know one thing about brother Branham is he saw everything in seed form and preached against it and everybody say well why do you preach against that has so little that's so small why would you preach against I Love Lucy why would you preach against that it seems so you know if you think if you compare Elvis Presley to some of the death metal bands that they have today you know you think well he preached against that but but look at what that produced amen and we see that there were so many seeds that were planted in this country in the 1940s 1950s amen and what do they do he preached against the seats and then the ministry was sealed off the ministry was finished amen and what do we do now we live in the harvest time and we see all of those TV shows amen all of that music from the 40s of 50s all the sudden has grown up and sprouted and ground branches and now it's bearing fruit another generation another generation amen Lee says but the Word of God has been sowed also amen and when the Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of God will live in the people Amen he says and that false bride that's committed adultery out there she brought herself into Creed's and sold out her birth rights will reap what a confederation of churches that's bound and burned like the thorns and thistles I'm anybody says but where the word of God's been so the people's heart it will reap a bride for Christ as certain as I'm standing here amen as certain as I'm standing here I'm gonna so be careful what seeds why because now we are closer to the latter rain thing we've ever been amen now there is a time where you have time to read out the old seats amen we have a time there is a there you have a time of grace where you can take those old seeds out of your life where you can burn up the ground where you can turn over the soil where you can prepare it you know to receive the word we can pass the Lord to sanctify your heart sanctify your life amen there is a time of grace for that amen but there will be a time when that grace a man word when the latter ring comes that that's not the time to be preparing your heart no the time to prepare your heart is now when you're receiving the word Amen it's now when you're receiving the word Amen amen amen spoken words original seat Blair Bram says Elijah's behavior Moses his behavior John's behavior leaving their field of service many of the people didn't understand them it was because they was rejected and their message the seed had been sown judgment was next and they was assigned to the people from God that judgment was at hand planting was over amen there after that he said I believe someday the real Bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the Word of God amen no that hasn't happened yet the bride price is still preaching amen but as the the tares are bound up tighter and tighter the bride will stand alone and then there will be an attack what against everybody that's stand you alone amen you know there's such a proprietary nature among so many things in this world you know you know it's like it's interesting III I don't know how much I want to get into it but you know there's mine now the denominational nature anytime you see it where people say we have to put our trust in this man-made system wherever you see that comes self on this earth stay away from it anytime you see a man-made system being put in place and then where you have to put your trust in that man-made system stay away from that amen you have to state you have to stand alone on the Word of God that has been preached to you you have to stand alone why because there will come a dry time a testing time amen what are you doing your standing it alone you're waiting for the rain to come and what do you do you have to stand there and wait upon the word that's gone before you brought as God said in in Exodus he says I expect you to see the sign and believe forever amen amen all of us have seen enough to believe in God amen and we're gonna see some more amen but it's just like those in the desert some people go out in the desert and say there's nothing living out here but for the tree is planted by the rivers of water we know exactly where we stand amen what we have forsaken all we've lifted our hand on Jehovah amen and we know who our provider is we know the power of the seed that we've received amen so just watch your ground keep your ground pure keep your ground clean a man stay away from all those other seats amen stay with the Word of God that's been manifested unto you amen there's a lot of little you'll always be a lot of flashy or things out there amen but we don't have to be flashy Amen we just have to believe in our God amen it paid off for Joshua and Caleb amen it'll pay off for us amen amen let's just stand he is the author and the finisher of our faith amen amen let's just power as a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I I just pray Lord that you got across exactly what you wanted to get across Lord this morning father lord I pray for all of those we go about our days father that you

people here Lord if there be anybody here those not ready to be that bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is not ready for that rain that if the rain did come would grow up something that's not recognizable

their lives or they here in the tyre mercy and grace Lord and while we still have time father they would watch carefully and examine what seeds they're letting sit there in their in their ground Lord because one is days Lord we know that every seed will manifest what is on the inside of it Lord the DNA that you spoke there Lord the more we pray Lord that there only your seed will grow in our lives
