[20:28] he says unto me right blessed are they
[20:32] which are called unto the marriage
[20:35] supper of the lamb and he says unto me
[20:39] these are the true sayings of God Amen
[20:42] let me read vers 10 and I fell at his
[20:45] feet to worship Him He said unto me see
[20:48] thou do it not I am thy fellow servant
[20:51] and of the Brethren that have the
[20:52] testimony of Jesus worship God for the

[21:01] amen Luke chapter
[21:07] 14 from vers
[21:09] 14 s 15 and when one of them sat at meat
[21:14] with him heard these things he said unto
[21:18] him blessed is he that shall eat bread
[21:21] in the kingdom of God Amen then said he
[21:24] unto him a certain man made a great
[21:29] supper and bade
[21:33] many and sent his
[21:37] servant
[21:40] singular at supper time to say to them
[21:44] that were biding
[21:47] come for all things are now ready
[21:50] hallelujah amen and they all with one
[21:53] consent began to make
[21:56] excuse the first said unto him
[21:59] I have bought a piece of ground and I
[22:01] must need go and see it I pray thee have
[22:05] me excuse if he's praying it he was
[22:09] religious another said I have bought
[22:12] five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them
[22:16] I pray the have me excused another
[22:18] religious
[22:19] one another said I have married a wife
[22:24] therefore I cannot
[22:26] come so that servant
[22:29] singular came and showed his Lord these
[22:33] things then the master of the house
[22:36] being
[22:37] angry said to his
[22:40] servant go out quickly into the streets
[22:43] and Lanes of the
[22:44] city and bringing he the poor and the m
[22:47] and the Hal and the
[22:49] Blind and the Sant singular said Lord it
[22:55] is done as thou Hast commanded and yet
[22:58] the
[22:59] room and the Lord said unto the servant
[23:02] go out into the highways and hges and
[23:06] compel them to come in that my house may
[23:09] be filled amen verse 24 for I say unto
[23:14] you that
[23:15] none of those men which were bidden
[23:20] shall taste of my
[23:23] supper be see the Saints
[23:29] be seated
[23:33] please blessed be the name of the Lord
[23:36] how many love the Lord Jesus
[23:38] Christ
[23:40] yes and for just a short scripture I
[23:44] would just read John chapter 6 and
[23:47] 26
[23:49] uh from verse 27 lior not for the meat
[23:53] which
[23:54] perisheth but for that meat which
[23:57] endureth on everlasting life where the
[24:00] son of man shall give unto you for him
[24:03] has God the Father
[24:05] sealed then said they unto him what
[24:09] shall we do that we might work the works
[24:13] of God listen to questions it
[24:16] is what shall we do that we might work
[24:19] the works of God Jesus answered unto
[24:23] him this is the work of God that you
[24:27] believe on him whom he has
[24:30] sent so if you want to do the work of
[24:32] God believe on the one that God has sent
[24:34] that's the work of God but see that
[24:37] answer is too
[24:39] simple we are looking to build hospitals
[24:41] and uh and schools and uh and and pride
[24:46] in our merits yeah yeah yeah once you
[24:49] fail to recognize the one that God sent
[24:54] how can you truly do the work yeah so I
[24:57] will start with just a quote here and I
[25:00] want to preach on the the servant at
[25:03] supper time
[25:04] yeah amen but Bram in talking the
[25:08] message in his
[25:09] presence uh says here that uh this is
[25:13] the time to shake
[25:15] people this is the time that God said
[25:18] that there will come a time he shook
[25:20] Mount one time but there will come a
[25:22] shaking again yeah that he wouldn't only
[25:25] Shake Mount but he will shake everything
[25:28] amen that could be moved but did you not
[25:30] the rest of the scripture but we receive
[25:33] a kingdom that cannot be
[25:36] moved everything that can be sh shook
[25:39] will be shaken the heavens will shake
[25:42] the Earth will shake heaven and will
[25:44] pass away but that word shall never pass
[25:47] away for upon this I will build my
[25:50] church and the Gates of Hell will
[25:52] prevail against everything that can be
[25:55] shook will be shaken amen but we receive
[25:58] Kingdom which is the word of God himself
[26:00] amen and God is his word he don't shake
[26:03] himself but we receive a kingdom that
[26:06] cannot be moved it's unshakable
[26:09] Hallelujah yes Lord such a person and
[26:13] such a time we have also ourselves we
[26:17] have seen the glory of God like those
[26:20] men did we've seen it we've seen the
[26:22] glory of God like Abraham saw it we saw
[26:25] the glory of God like Moses saw it same
[26:27] Pillar of Fire same power amen the same
[26:30] Christ revealing himself showing himself
[26:33] keeping his word in the last days how
[26:36] can we come by then and walk and treat
[26:40] it so lightly how can we walk around and
[26:43] hold to our cre denominations and not
[26:46] take the word of God what will it be for
[26:48] us in that day how will happen to us
[26:51] when we have seen the glory of God
[26:54] hallelujah some people will stand off
[26:57] and they'll make fun of it yeah some
[26:59] will laugh at it some will call it
[27:02] fanatism some will call it mental
[27:04] telepathy some will call it B some will
[27:07] call it one thing or another as the old
[27:10] prop is fools will walk with hot nail
[27:14] shoes Where Angels Fear to tr the fool
[27:17] has said in his heart there's no God
[27:20] when he sees God manifested so perfectly
[27:24] by his own word not by Creed but by his
[27:26] word amen and then what right over it
[27:29] and make fun of it he's a fool but that
[27:32] is uh CU what God that God is the word
[27:37] and God himself plainly uh uh God
[27:40] himself plain to them and he's a fool
[27:43] who will it be for him when he has to
[27:45] stand in that place it will be terrible
[27:48] for that man in that day the
[27:51] ungodly I said this just to say that uh
[27:55] we are going home now amen amen and and
[27:58] and and before any Revival ever produced
[28:02] the the the real of the crop that
[28:04] follows it they got to be a shaking am
[28:08] you know the Shar got to be separated
[28:10] from the wheat am and so it it's all
[28:13] part of God's plan and program yes sir
[28:15] you know we've not come this far for
[28:17] somebody come and tell me some
[28:18] intellectual come and tell me that try
[28:20] to reason the word of God the rest of
[28:22] God the word of God was not made to be
[28:24] reason it was made to be believ you need
[28:27] to have faith because see without faith
[28:29] you can't please God
[28:31] am it is impossible for anybody to truly
[28:35] worship God outside of Faith amen and
[28:39] and was talking about the faith we
[28:40] talking about here it's not even the
[28:43] emotion to believe yes sir yes sir we
[28:45] talking about the Revelation that God
[28:47] gives to you that nothing can move you
[28:50] out of
[28:53] it so we are here thinking right now
[28:57] that we are about to go home in the
[29:00] Rapture yeah but the Bible the word
[29:03] rapture is not in the
[29:05] scripture but when B Bram came and Jesus
[29:08] came the Book of Revelation uses the
[29:12] word supper yes Jesus calls it the great
[29:16] supper amen therefore the Rapture is not
[29:20] a morning message no
[29:23] sir
[29:25] Hallelujah that was for baby Luther yeah
[29:29] afternoon message was for
[29:30] Wesley but if it's a supper time am
[29:34] there is an evening time
[29:36] setting and if it's an evening time
[29:39] setting we have to watch closely the
[29:43] scriptures as God and Jesus Christ begin
[29:46] to bring the event that should bring it
[29:48] yes people are trying to do the works of
[29:51] God all these men who are on the
[29:53] internet trying to do the work of God
[29:55] yeah trying to prove the message wrong
[29:57] yeah you know people are specializing to
[29:59] make sure that the message is wrong yeah
[30:01] a man spent his whole life finding
[30:03] mistakes of the message yeah thank god
[30:06] brother brandham said if you come to
[30:07] church and you want to find mistake you
[30:10] find a lot
[30:12] amen
[30:13] amen you know so because they set to
[30:16] find mistakes they are finding all kinds
[30:18] of
[30:22] mistakes but there's no mistake in
[30:25] God because all things work for good yes
[30:28] yes yes even when Abraham told lie it
[30:31] became a
[30:35] blessing amen yes sir when Jacob crossed
[30:39] his hands it was a
[30:43] blessing I I see a lot of things in the
[30:46] Bible but I believe it yes that the
[30:48] Bible is the word of God that the
[30:51] scriptures is inspired am and yet still
[30:54] the Bible is the life story of men amen
[30:58] come on it's Adam yeah it's eve yeah
[31:01] it's a serpent yeah that mess up yeah
[31:04] our mother amen do we throw her
[31:07] away God came back and had Redemption
[31:11] Hall it's about Abraham yeah he made
[31:14] mistakes yes sir yeah yeah yeah he
[31:16] listened to his wife yeah he took hagga
[31:20] uhhuh P ishma mistakes I will show you a
[31:23] lot amen and yesterday the Bible say
[31:26] Abraham staggered not
[31:28] amen at the promise of God
[31:30] unbel so I want to know how they came to
[31:33] the message so here Jesus is saying here
[31:36] that come on brother a certain man made
[31:40] a great
[31:42] supper now this supper is the rapture
[31:45] yeah yeah because we are going to sit at
[31:48] his feet amen could you imagine that
[31:51] table we're going to S Isaiah you right
[31:53] over the KE the corner yeah amen
[31:56] hallelujah the corner over there and we
[31:59] look at one another and wonder oh say
[32:00] Lord Jesus thank you for making it
[32:02] possible for
[32:04] us see it said but this supper that the
[32:08] man made he actually invited and beat
[32:11] many yeah yeah
[32:15] yeah many came were had invitation to
[32:19] come to this supper a which means that
[32:22] God was going to do something to give
[32:24] almost everybody a chance everybody an
[32:27] opport
[32:29] to come to this supper that he's about
[32:31] to make
[32:33] amen but the scripture says that all of
[32:36] them with one
[32:37] consent began to make
[32:42] excuses now there's nothing wrong in
[32:45] owning a
[32:47] business there's nothing wrong in having
[32:49] a car
[32:50] ran there's nothing wrong in buying a
[32:54] land or field as nothing wrong in my
[32:58] yeah I'll be performing the marriage
[32:59] very soon when I get home yeah but you
[33:02] see when those things Hallelujah become
[33:06] your obsession yes and then those things
[33:09] overtake you when you cannot seek first
[33:12] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[33:15] before you add any other thing to it it
[33:18] becomes a
[33:19] curse so the first man comes in and tell
[33:22] and I think this is a setting of lodia
[33:25] yeah lisia because when Jesus came they
[33:29] are going to reject him
[33:32] amen why they same rich I have need of
[33:39] nothing I I I I I don't need no healing
[33:43] power from God I got good doctors who
[33:45] will take care of
[33:46] me I don't need anything to ask God for
[33:49] material blessing because I got too much
[33:53] yeah and the excuses that they were
[33:57] given
[33:58] was going to exclude them from the
[34:00] supper amen the invitation was for them
[34:03] to come to the King's Supper am who will
[34:07] want to miss the supper of the
[34:10] king but they allow their businesses
[34:13] they allow their jobs they allow their
[34:18] private and personal life maybe family
[34:21] life to hinder
[34:25] them sometime people say brother did not
[34:27] spend time with his family so what are
[34:30] you the one that call him yeah this is a
[34:32] media
[34:36] complaint she the one who married a man
[34:38] has no problem and you are worried
[34:42] about so so if we if you take your
[34:45] ideology he should be boxed up in
[34:47] Jeffersonville and don't travel nowhere
[34:50] amen when at midnight people are calling
[34:52] him my father is dying my mom is dying
[34:56] and the prophet is sacrificing his life
[34:59] to save people who are snoring and
[35:03] having fun with your wife and come and
[35:05] accuse the
[35:08] prophet now this supper of the king it
[35:12] was the king supper yes but the King has
[35:16] uh
[35:17] designated the invitation in the hand of
[35:21] a
[35:25] servant hallelujah hallelujah if you
[35:28] miss the servant you miss the
[35:31] [Music]
[35:34] invitation the servant holds the
[35:37] revelation of the invite amen hallelujah
[35:41] therefore if you want to come you need
[35:44] to meet the
[35:49] servant and it is not two
[35:52] servants it's not a plurality of
[35:55] servants it is a servant
[35:58] at supper time it is one person am it's
[36:02] a one man Ministry at the end time to
[36:06] bring the people to the
[36:08] serer
[36:10] Hallelujah the king could have come
[36:12] himself but he chose the
[36:16] servant and the servant is the
[36:20] leoan or
[36:22] the the person standing between the
[36:25] public and God Amen God talk to the
[36:28] servant you talk to the servant the
[36:31] servant talk to
[36:32] [Applause]
[36:34] God Amen Revelations
[36:37] 1 just want to identify a few things
[36:40] here Revelations 1 and
[36:46] one Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus
[36:49] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[36:53] unto his servant things which must
[36:55] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[36:59] signify it by his Angel unto his servant
[37:03] John now listen to be carefully church
[37:05] we are dealing with the revelation of
[37:07] Jesus
[37:08] Christ that God has given to him the
[37:11] Revelation that Jesus Christ has that
[37:13] God gave Christ that Revelation is
[37:17] supposed to be given to
[37:20] John but but John is not getting the
[37:23] Revelation direct amen it is coming
[37:26] through the medium yeah of a servant of
[37:29] an
[37:30] angel in other words if you miss this
[37:34] angel you canot have a true revelation
[37:37] of Jesus
[37:38] Christ that's
[37:40] right Hallelujah listen
[37:44] church that I saw Jesus and when you saw
[37:48] somebody said I saw him he on a white
[37:50] horse another person come come and tell
[37:53] you that oh Jesus Christ is a light yeah
[37:55] anybody can tell you what they want but
[37:57] when the prophet begin to reveal Christ
[38:00] and you cut the revelation of that is
[38:04] different so Jesus in The Book of
[38:07] Revelation chapter one wants his
[38:10] Revelation to come but the Revelation is
[38:13] to be signified by an Angel yes but the
[38:16] brother said John is the type of the
[38:18] Bride
[38:19] amenu let me even bring it closer at the
[38:23] writing of the Book of Revelation 9596
[38:27] almost all the apostles were dead yes
[38:29] sir yes sir Peter was gone Paul was
[38:32] finished yeah the kill of them yeah the
[38:34] only one remaining was John the revelat
[38:37] yes sir in other words there is a book
[38:40] that you are reading that Peter never
[38:42] read yeah Paul never
[38:45] read are you
[38:47] Church the apostles never read
[38:51] this because this Revelation is for end
[38:55] time people
[38:57] [Music]
[38:59] Glory Hallelujah it is this same servant
[39:04] who began to bring the Revelation so
[39:06] clear that in Revelation 19 and:
[39:11] 9 watch this
[39:14] carefully that John when he brought the
[39:17] revelation of the
[39:19] supper showing John the Revelation don't
[39:22] fell at his feet to worship Him He says
[39:26] see thou do it not amen
[39:28] I am thy fellow servant yes of thy
[39:30] Brethren yes but brother if if you love
[39:32] me call me brother yes I have a
[39:35] testimony of Jesus yes worship God for
[39:39] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[39:41] Prophecy how can people deny the
[39:43] prophetic
[39:44] word and claim to have the testimony of
[39:47] Jesus you cannot do it until God open
[39:51] your eye to the spirit of Prophecy
[39:53] prophesy over the end time for us to get
[39:56] into it amen so this Angel is a servant
[40:01] this Angel is a brother this Angel is
[40:05] one with the testimony of Jesus so he is
[40:07] not an Old Testament prophet he is one
[40:11] of AIA but he one of the New Testament
[40:14] after the blood of Jesus Amen
[40:18] Hallelujah Revelation
[40:20] 22: n
[40:27] and I John saw these things and when I
[40:29] heard them when I had heard and seen I
[40:32] fell down to worship before the feet of
[40:35] the Angel which showed me these
[40:37] things then say he unto me see thou do
[40:41] it not for I am thy fellow servant and
[40:44] of the Brethren the prophets and of them
[40:47] which keep the says of this book worship
[40:49] God Amen now I I'm still going to make a
[40:52] statement here Church come on in other
[40:55] words this angel that is to reveal the
[40:58] word to
[40:59] us will have the ability to break the
[41:03] word so much that John the Revelator in
[41:07] essence the man who saw Jesus and fell
[41:10] at his feet as though dead the men that
[41:13] walk with Jesus upon the face of the
[41:16] Earth seeing this Angel he
[41:19] attempted three times to worship it
[41:22] worship that's right come on it was the
[41:25] angel that told him don't do it amen
[41:28] hallelujah what I'm saying is that
[41:30] because of this the has if the scripture
[41:34] is saying that John fell at his feet and
[41:38] the angel said don't do it we have to
[41:41] see the same
[41:43] manifestation so there has to be a
[41:45] spirit that should come in the end time
[41:48] making an attempt to worship the
[41:51] angel but the angel said don't do
[41:55] it he said if you do it you remove me
[41:58] from the bracket of a brother and you
[42:00] make me an antichrist therefore the
[42:03] angel corrected it he is not the Lord
[42:06] Jesus Christ he's a servant of the Lord
[42:09] Jesus Christ but the angel hold the
[42:12] revelation of who Jesus is
[42:16] hallelujah if you want to do the works
[42:18] of God believe on the one that God has
[42:22] sent
[42:23] amen praise the Lord Brother Hallelujah

[45:09] there is room
[45:12] brother I like that

[45:45] word is your healer and that's what it's
[45:48] supposed to do in your
[45:52] life that's right so what I'm saying to
[45:55] you tonight is that a rejection of the
[45:58] messenger message is a rejection of the
[46:02] king's invitation amen so the people
[46:04] that are on the internet rejecting the
[46:07] messenger of the hour they are rejecting
[46:10] their own Rapture am that's right
[46:13] because in the word they rejected it
[46:16] yes that's
[46:18] it that's
[46:20] it are you are with the church
[46:23] amen and you know the king
[46:27] in
[46:28] scripture uh somebody even said brother
[46:30] brandham did not fulfill Revelation
[46:32] 10:7 see they lack Revelation yeah yeah
[46:35] yeah yeah yeah because let me say
[46:36] something to you uh Revelation 10:7 see
[46:39] the number 17 Place B's Ministry 17 you
[46:43] said brother John what are you talking
[46:45] about let me show a few things 10 + 7 is
[46:48] 17 yeah when he was baptized in the 17
[46:51] person The Voice open yeah as John the
[46:55] Baptist was sent to forun the first
[46:57] coming of Christ your message will forun
[47:01] amen the second coming of Christ whether
[47:04] you believe it or not I believe
[47:06] it am I don't have to be there because I
[47:09] have accepted whom God has
[47:12] sent his testimony is good for me on the
[47:16] 17th person did you realize that Noah
[47:19] went into the Ark on the
[47:21] 17 Hallelujah yes sir amen yes sir
[47:24] believe Genesis 711
[47:27] he said hold on let's read
[47:32] that I know he said brother John what is
[47:34] the significant because Noah there has
[47:38] repeated come on brother in the 600 year
[47:42] of noest Life 600 years the year of man
[47:45] number number six in the second month
[47:48] the 17th day of the month the same day
[47:52] where all the fountains of the great
[47:54] deep broken up and the windows of Heaven
[47:55] were open the race was upon the Earth 40
[47:58] days and 40 nights in the S same day
[48:01] entered Noah Shem ham and jaff the sons
[48:03] of Noah and Noah's wife and three wives
[48:05] of his sons into the Ark on the 17th of
[48:08] May that's right they went into the ark
[48:12] why because Luke
[48:15] 17 is a repeat of Noah's anointing back
[48:18] upon the face of the Year yes everything
[48:21] they doing Noah's day has repeated
[48:23] itself in our time not only that but so
[48:27] also has added so we got a double
[48:30] anointing that's why we need both the
[48:32] latter Reign and the former
[48:37] Reign blessed be the name of the Lord
[48:40] church
[48:41] and I just in closing in taking a
[48:45] type

[53:31] who take the message from the King and
[53:33] brings it to the wife and the wife
[53:36] talked to the Chamberlain he said a
[53:38] message back to God you want to do the
[53:41] works of God believe on whom he has
[53:44] [Applause]
[53:45] sent maybe V just thought well what does
[53:49] it it doesn't matter I would just do my
[53:51] best and you know hey if I don't go who
[53:55] cares
[53:56] her
[53:57] disrespect and rejection of the king is
[54:01] going to cause vity to lose what she is
[54:05] enjoying amen many brothers have enjoyed
[54:08] a privilege to be known they've been
[54:11] authorized song leaders
[54:13] preachers they've done great great great
[54:16] things but now they are turning back and
[54:19] rejecting the very message that has
[54:22] built them who they are amen that has
[54:24] given them the fame amen and what you
[54:27] are rejecting is going to cause you yeah
[54:29] yeah what the people are rejecting is
[54:31] going to cause them the supper amen but
[54:34] VES reject is going to cause her her
[54:37] because why she's now involved with
[54:39] other
[54:42] women she want to be like a denomination
[54:45] yes so she have no time for the
[54:48] message and when the king had that thing
[54:50] it hurt him and the King now was
[54:53] troubled yes and somebody said what's
[54:56] the matter with you King you worried
[54:57] about your wife he said could you
[54:58] imagine the hour of and look at it right
[55:00] now it looked like everybody is troubled
[55:02] and because we don't what why should
[55:04] this brother go here why should and
[55:06] everybody is I I believe that God maybe
[55:08] having his knowing everything going on
[55:12] we sit down and we wonder why should
[55:14] happen that way then they said King
[55:19] rest take other people yeah who are
[55:23] better off than her and let them go
[55:25] through a process
[55:26] that the woman that will please the king
[55:29] the woman that will have a revelation to
[55:32] serve the bride that has a revelation
[55:36] amen of the message of the Chamberlain
[55:39] let her be the wife and church that's
[55:41] what we need we need to have a
[55:43] revelation of this message your father
[55:47] cannot give it to you your mother cannot
[55:49] give it to you they can raise you up but
[55:53] God has to reveal the message to you
[56:02] God now Hallelujah chapter 2 thank you
[56:06] Jesus says that vers two then said the
[56:11] king servants that ministered unto him
[56:13] let there be fair young virgins sought
[56:15] for the king and let the king appoint
[56:17] officers in all provinces of his kingdom
[56:20] that they may gather together all the
[56:21] fair young virgins unto shisham the
[56:23] palace to the house of the women on to
[56:26] the custody of Hagi the king's
[56:28] Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let
[56:31] their thief of purification be given
[56:33] them Hagi will going to be in charge of
[56:36] the virgins it's a woman ministry again
[56:39] ha
[56:41] guy the problem with these people is
[56:44] that they cannot accept the fact that
[56:48] God has to use one man in this age to
[56:52] bring for the word amen and they're
[56:54] saying that how can the the voice of a
[56:57] one man be more than the Bible but never
[57:00] said that no he said that come into the
[57:02] word yeah he brought us to the
[57:05] word but you know church right now it is
[57:08] becoming more clearer how Noah preached
[57:11] the gospel and only Noah and his family
[57:14] were saved
[57:16] am now it's becoming clearer that after
[57:20] 120 years of a prophet preaching the
[57:23] word of God nobody came I said nobody
[57:25] came yeah yeah except the man's wife
[57:28] yeah and children
[57:29] amen what do you think happened in no
[57:32] wday they found too many mistakes with
[57:34] his
[57:36] message it has never rained and you say
[57:38] it's going to
[57:40] rain you bring a boat in the forest
[57:43] somewhere where the dry dock yeah yeah
[57:45] yeah yeah yeah yeah amen all kind of
[57:49] questions
[57:53] amen amen vers
[57:59] uh vers three and let the M with
[58:03] please please said the king be Queen
[58:07] instead of Vy and the thing please the
[58:09] king hi his
[58:11] soul amen
[58:13] vers
[58:15] seven he brought up hadassa that is
[58:18] Esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[58:20] neither father nor mother and the M was
[58:22] fair and beautiful for mod when her
[58:25] father and mother were there dead took
[58:26] for his own daughter so it came to pass
[58:29] when the king's commandment and his
[58:30] decree Was Heard and when the mares were
[58:32] gathered together unto sushan the palace
[58:34] to the custody of hagaya that Esther was
[58:37] brought also onto the King's house to
[58:39] the custody of hagaya Keeper of the
[58:42] women now you see the Church of the
[58:46] Living God a woman TI the church yeah
[58:48] God must entrust his church to a prophet
[58:52] a servant that he God can trust with the
[58:55] word amen that's right amen and let me
[58:58] say this the reason why the
[59:00] Kings trust this
[59:02] chamberling because these chamberling
[59:05] are castrated males yeah that's right
[59:07] that's right that's right they Uno yes
[59:11] sir they are men who their life as far
[59:16] as progenation is concerned cannot
[59:19] reproduce themselves that's right which
[59:21] means that they are dead to their own
[59:23] seed amen amen and God need a man like
[59:27] William Bram yes who be dead to his own
[59:32] ideas in fact the only man that we know
[59:35] that if he does a mistake is more than
[59:38] able to come and tell us what the mind
[59:41] of God is and forget about his
[59:45] ideology that's
[59:49] right you love him all right's continue

[1:03:10] could not move
[1:03:11] on oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:14] yes
[1:03:16] yes so
[1:03:20] vers
[1:03:22] 14 or 13 then does every men of to the
[1:03:26] king whatever she desired was giving her
[1:03:28] to go with her out of the house of the
[1:03:31] women onto the King's house now after
[1:03:33] the Chamberlain has given you
[1:03:35] everything the day you have to be the
[1:03:37] king whatever you
[1:03:40] desire is giving
[1:03:42] you God has a way of forcing all of us
[1:03:46] to be content Yeah
[1:03:49] Yeah by asking for extra things tells
[1:03:52] you that what the Chamberlain gave you
[1:03:55] is not sufficient
[1:03:58] enough vers 14 in the evening she
[1:04:02] went and on the tomorrow she returned
[1:04:05] into the second house of the women to
[1:04:06] the custody of shazar the king
[1:04:08] Chamberlain which kep the concubines she
[1:04:11] came unto the king no more except the
[1:04:13] king delighted in her and that she were
[1:04:14] called by name now when the 10 of Esa
[1:04:17] the daughter of Abel the uncle of modah
[1:04:20] were taking her for his daughter was
[1:04:22] come to go in onto the king she required
[1:04:25] nothing nothing Hallelujah but what her
[1:04:27] gu the king Chamberlain The Keeper of
[1:04:30] the women appointed amen and Esther
[1:04:32] obtained favor in the sight of all of
[1:04:34] them that look upon her you see the
[1:04:36] difference everybody was taking
[1:04:38] something with them and whatever you
[1:04:40] added to the word was rejected yeah yeah
[1:04:43] yeah yeah yeah that's good you see in
[1:04:44] the end time the revelation of the word
[1:04:48] is so true but people want to add and
[1:04:51] tell you that Jesus Christ is not God
[1:04:55] and now they believe in two Lords yeah
[1:04:57] that's right added Revelation yeah yeah
[1:05:01] when put two Natures in the soul they
[1:05:04] call it two Soul added Revelation
[1:05:07] amen are you with me Church yeah when he
[1:05:10] say the Revelation that contain in the
[1:05:12] Seven Seals in seven Thunders they come
[1:05:14] back and take their virtues yeah I
[1:05:17] Revelation that's right polygamy added
[1:05:20] Revelation amen return Ministry add
[1:05:24] revelation and God purpos it like that
[1:05:27] take whatever you want
[1:05:30] yeah but Esther Hallelujah stay with her
[1:05:35] gu
[1:05:36] Revelation she stayed with water baptism
[1:05:39] in Jesus name she stayed with the
[1:05:42] Revelation that Jesus Christ is God she
[1:05:46] stay with the Revelation amen are you
[1:05:49] with the church the true interpretation
[1:05:52] of M and divorce he broke it down on the
[1:05:55] grounds of
[1:05:57] fornication that's it amen
[1:06:01] am he left the word for
[1:06:04] us if we stay with what ha gu brought
[1:06:08] with what a prophet brought we will
[1:06:10] please the
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:15] king the reason is because the secret of
[1:06:19] the king is with the
[1:06:22] chamberling and the secret is a seven
[1:06:25] seat am the seven seal is the
[1:06:29] secret it is with the prophet the
[1:06:33] Revelation is a three-fold
[1:06:36] mystery praise the name of the Lord if
[1:06:40] we stay with that we're going to be
[1:06:45] fine
[1:06:47] hallu so Esther 16 was taken unto the
[1:06:50] king of hisus into his house Royal in
[1:06:52] the 10th month which is montith in the
[1:06:55] seventh year of his Reign so Esther came
[1:06:58] in at Revelation 10:7 yes that's right
[1:07:01] on the 10th month of the seventh 10th
[1:07:04] day is it yeah 10th month of the seventh
[1:07:06] day
[1:07:07] amen seventh year it's like ration 10:7
[1:07:10] don't you see
[1:07:12] that and then verse 17 Again watch it
[1:07:16] and the King loved
[1:07:18] Esther above all the
[1:07:21] women and she obtained grace and favor
[1:07:24] yes in his sight more than all the
[1:07:27] virgins amen so that he set the Royal
[1:07:30] Crown upon her head and made a queen in
[1:07:32] of vity you see on verse 17 here Esther
[1:07:37] received
[1:07:39] Grace more than all the other women yes
[1:07:42] buts we have received the grace of God
[1:07:46] in this age more than any other Church
[1:07:49] age amen
[1:07:52] hallelujah brother because where sin
[1:07:55] abounds that's where Grace abounds most
[1:07:57] now this is a corruptible age it's a age
[1:08:01] where if God did not even intervene in
[1:08:03] our time no flesh will be
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] saved received such a special Grace and
[1:08:11] uh and so here you realize that
[1:08:14] church the difference between her and
[1:08:17] the rest is that she learned obedience
[1:08:21] in the house of modah
[1:08:26] amen we have to learn our church order
[1:08:30] how to conduct ourselves now I see
[1:08:32] brothers who have defected on the
[1:08:34] message and telling brother the brandham
[1:08:35] that he preached and the women did not
[1:08:37] feel good about
[1:08:39] themselves now they are wearing pants
[1:08:41] and they feel good they were in short
[1:08:43] and they feeling good now now they feel
[1:08:45] good where Jesus Christ when he told you
[1:08:47] that if a man should last after you you
[1:08:50] committed adultery do you know what
[1:08:51] you're doing yeah the prophet gave you
[1:08:53] the key to protect yourself
[1:08:56] amen but there is no message that really
[1:09:00] tells a man how to love his wife than
[1:09:03] this
[1:09:04] [Applause]
[1:09:05] message that's right and there is no
[1:09:08] messy upon the face of the Earth that
[1:09:10] tells a woman how to make a
[1:09:13] husband happy than this message
[1:09:16] amen you can't throw this away this is
[1:09:22] life so
[1:09:25] Esther had one man ha
[1:09:27] guy Jesus had one man a servant the
[1:09:31] servant that was revealing the word to
[1:09:33] John is a prophet is a servant is
[1:09:38] singular is God's order for the age the
[1:09:42] supper oh glory be to
[1:09:45] God Amen and then the
[1:09:50] king just made this statement all those
[1:09:54] who refuse
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:56] invitation will not make it to my
[1:10:01] supper to turn down the invitation of
[1:10:04] this end time is a refusal of your own
[1:10:08] Rapture you can tear it down but it's a
[1:10:12] price to
[1:10:14] pay but brand P the foolish virgins this
[1:10:16] way he said there are people who
[1:10:18] rejected the
[1:10:20] message you see even that they rejected
[1:10:24] it in what sense it said they were
[1:10:27] blinded by false
[1:10:29] prophets and they never heard the
[1:10:31] message but after you have heard the
[1:10:34] truth sir and you now claim that the
[1:10:37] cloud is some Aeroplane jet that went
[1:10:41] somewhere I'm closing
[1:10:44] now let me close now continue tomorrow
[1:10:47] you said what is the confusion but J
[1:10:51] Smith is testified it's on YouTube now
[1:10:52] so there there's no shame in this he was
[1:10:54] being inter
[1:10:56] you can Google you know when you see
[1:10:58] Jeff Jenkins resignation you're going to
[1:11:00] see J Smith somewhere there in the red
[1:11:02] shirt and he
[1:11:04] said but brandham was not on Sunset
[1:11:06] Mountain on the 28th of February he
[1:11:09] brought his timeline that on the 1st of
[1:11:13] March the game for javalina uh hunting
[1:11:17] began that year on the 1 of March the
[1:11:20] prophet got a call to go to
[1:11:22] Texas and uh seek for pardon for the for
[1:11:25] a young man who have been accused of you
[1:11:27] know trying to kill somebody else Soul
[1:11:30] so he left came back on the 6th of March
[1:11:33] and about the 8th of mar the Angels came
[1:11:35] down and everything went so he was not
[1:11:37] there on the 28 when they heard that
[1:11:40] because everybody know but ABR always
[1:11:41] connected the cloud with the
[1:11:45] angels but you
[1:11:47] see before God does anything on Earth he
[1:11:51] first have to show the signs in the
[1:11:53] heavens so he doesn't have to be there
[1:11:56] on the 28th for God to show the sign but
[1:11:59] it was taken in Flag Staff the very
[1:12:02] place where the angel coming later so as
[1:12:06] a prophet he is connecting what the
[1:12:10] listen he preached the seals in March
[1:12:13] not knowing about the cloud he never
[1:12:16] said nothing about the cloud in March in
[1:12:19] April May 17th it appeared in the
[1:12:22] magazine he first spoke about it in June
[1:12:26] and God began to deal with him tell to
[1:12:28] the right side the face of Jesus is
[1:12:30] there this is revelation 1 and 17 this
[1:12:35] is supreme deity he began to connect
[1:12:37] that to the word why the signs are
[1:12:41] declared in the heavens before God D
[1:12:44] upon the earth when John the Baptist
[1:12:46] said that the Messiah is here amen I
[1:12:50] don't know him but the one I see the
[1:12:52] spirit will come I will identify him how
[1:12:54] did you know the spirit is coming then
[1:12:57] when Jesus came for the manifestation
[1:12:59] Behold the Lamb of God that taken away
[1:13:02] the s i see the heavens open and the
[1:13:04] spirit of God be sent like a dove was it
[1:13:06] a dove or like a dove was it a cloud who
[1:13:12] knows are you with the church so what
[1:13:15] I'm trying to say is
[1:13:17] this we don't he doesn't have to be on
[1:13:20] the
[1:13:20] 28th because God has to declare the SS
[1:13:23] in the heavens first amen and then he
[1:13:26] preached the SE without that the cloud
[1:13:28] is only a confirmation of the message
[1:13:32] that is be the truth and once we can get
[1:13:35] that fixed but we cannot see nothing
[1:13:37] because I cannot explain the
[1:13:39] supernatural but because he a prophet I
[1:13:41] believe it am that's right amen
[1:13:47] hallelujah amen I believe it because the
[1:13:50] word is like he said that's your lord
[1:13:53] out there I believe that
[1:13:56] that's right
[1:13:58] amen how can you explain how Moses
[1:14:02] parted somebody who doesn't understand
[1:14:05] it the Sea of read
[1:14:08] what read something that part why don't
[1:14:11] you go and do it
[1:14:13] now God parted
[1:14:15] mer we cannot explain but God did it
[1:14:19] yes so there are so many things that the
[1:14:21] almighty God in his own good will will
[1:14:25] do we are believers because we believe
[1:14:28] in
[1:14:30] God all who come to God must fa believe
[1:14:35] that God is and he is a rewarder of
[1:14:39] those who diligently seek after him you
[1:14:42] got to believe First only believe all
[1:14:46] things will
[1:14:52] possible so in this supper that we are
[1:14:54] going mhm it is
[1:14:56] crucial not to leave the servant out
[1:14:59] amen because to reject the servant is to
[1:15:02] reject the message to reject the message
[1:15:04] is to reject the message from God Amen
[1:15:06] and if you turn God down where will you
[1:15:11] go amen
[1:15:16] amen you know there have been so many
[1:15:18] overwhelming things that God has done in
[1:15:20] this
[1:15:21] age but you see Church
[1:15:25] people thought over the years that the
[1:15:27] message is all
[1:15:28] about God sent a prophet and you come to
[1:15:32] church and you have long dress and long
[1:15:35] hair and and they said that's the
[1:15:38] message see and they never had a
[1:15:42] life inside of them you know to to to to
[1:15:46] be dramatized to to to to follow the
[1:15:49] word you know so butam say that man can
[1:15:52] have the Holy Ghost on the flesh yes he
[1:15:55] can have on the spirit and preach good
[1:15:57] good preachers like Apollo very
[1:15:59] fantastic preachers prophesy speaking
[1:16:02] tongues but they don't have a
[1:16:05] birth are you the church it's when Paul
[1:16:08] stood and watch Apollo's preach that
[1:16:09] gospel have you got the Holy Ghost since
[1:16:11] you believe he said what is that I've
[1:16:13] never heard of it he said unto what were
[1:16:16] you baptized he said John's baptism I
[1:16:18] see your problem John baptized you onto
[1:16:21] repentance to believe on the one to come
[1:16:24] they have never come into Christ who is
[1:16:27] Christ Christ is the word revealed in
[1:16:31] the hour you are living in how can you
[1:16:33] question your
[1:16:36] husband I mean how can a wife a woman
[1:16:38] that truly love a
[1:16:40] man huh yes question amen the man's Lord
[1:16:44] For You amen when you know he's there
[1:16:46] for you amen
[1:16:48] amen amen I love him
[1:16:51] too much too K him
[1:16:57] now
[1:16:59] too much to
[1:17:02] Break My
[1:17:04] Vow but I
[1:17:06] promise the Lord that I will make it
[1:17:13] somehow yes I love him too much let's
[1:17:17] all stand
[1:17:20] to him
[1:17:22] now yes I love him
[1:17:26] too much to
[1:17:30] fear
[1:17:32] Him oh
[1:17:36] too much to
[1:17:40] Break My
[1:17:42] Vow but I
[1:17:45] promise yes the
[1:17:47] Lord that I will make
[1:17:50] it
[1:17:53] some yes I I love
[1:17:56] him too
[1:17:58] much to
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:04] fear and you know Church the reason why
[1:18:08] we come in his
[1:18:09] presence is because brother Bram says
[1:18:12] that none of us could have gone to
[1:18:15] heaven because Jesus is the one that
[1:18:17] made the way for
[1:18:19] us he made a way for us to come
[1:18:23] in don't let us criticize one another
[1:18:27] and and you know the spirit of God is a
[1:18:30] spirit of
[1:18:31] forgiveness that's right is the spirit
[1:18:33] that can be because bitterness is not
[1:18:36] good malice is not good we got to come
[1:18:39] to that fountain that Fountain of love
[1:18:42] where you be able to express the true
[1:18:44] genuine love of Jesus Christ look at the
[1:18:47] prophet pretty and divorce and come back
[1:18:49] to the seene and said if the truth is
[1:18:52] preached it will destroy every home amen
[1:18:55] it's said Lord said he couldn't preach
[1:18:58] it until first God had to give a pardon
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] first and brother we have come in some
[1:19:06] have come in we've still made some
[1:19:08] mistakes but the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:19:11] said tonight is more powerful to clean
[1:19:14] us from every unrighteousness amen amen
[1:19:19] hallelujah see let let me just share
[1:19:21] before I
[1:19:23] pray when our brother Billy
[1:19:26] Paul the prophet would not marry
[1:19:29] him because they had to Anor his first
[1:19:35] relationship and when he brought sister
[1:19:38] Lo home she was not a
[1:19:40] Believer I hope you understand what I'm
[1:19:42] trying to say amen and I'm not
[1:19:44] justifying anything but I want to show
[1:19:47] the grace of God in our
[1:19:48] lives the prophet did not marry them but
[1:19:52] after the marriage he prayed for them
[1:19:55] then he came back and says that's my
[1:19:57] daughter-in-law she is seeking the Holy
[1:19:59] Spirit and then he came back and say she
[1:20:02] got the Holy Ghost now once he got a
[1:20:04] holy ghost you got to go back to the
[1:20:06] past leave it because God even though it
[1:20:10] look awful the Holy Ghost corrects every
[1:20:13] error that's why by says that the new
[1:20:16] birth corrects every error he said you
[1:20:19] may be born a bastor you may not know
[1:20:21] your father you may not know who gave
[1:20:23] bir to you but you have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:26] it corrects all the
[1:20:29] errors because your your identity is no
[1:20:32] longer with your Earthly father your
[1:20:34] identity is with your heavenly father
[1:20:37] and once he gives you his own Spirit he
[1:20:39] brings you into the
[1:20:41] court amen amen amen hallelujah amen

[1:21:10] him was your Revelation is the
[1:21:12] revelation of Jesus Christ signified by
