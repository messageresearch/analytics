[15:18] amen amen so I guess we announced the
[15:24] young people's meaning but brother Sammy
[15:26] is not here to remind us a win not win
[15:30] but the time by God's grace so we have
[15:35] to come another time with that you love
[15:37] the Lord surely God is good to us amen
[15:40] glad to see you by God's grace and I'm
[15:43] glad to be in the house of the Lord I
[15:47] have a little subject I'm trying to work
[15:50] on I'm working on by God's grace so it's
[15:53] the beginning of something and I know
[15:55] that the Lord will bless but as we stand
[16:00] let us turn to Genesis 1 please we're
[16:02] just gonna read that chapter I mean that
[16:04] verse they meant Genesis 1:1 God has
[16:09] been dealing with me on some thoughts
[16:11] and things and I just wish I was smarter
[16:14] you know in the sense that I could fully
[16:18] understand you know the quantum theory
[16:20] and relativity and those things because
[16:23] I see it I can understand it in my way
[16:27] but I don't know whether I can convey it
[16:29] to you but by God's grace I'll try to
[16:32] because you know science in itself
[16:35] vindicates the word science it's just
[16:39] God's laboratory that intelligent man
[16:42] has crept into or cracked into we know
[16:49] that this has happened once before
[16:50] because remember in the book of Genesis
[16:53] God had to come and confuse the language
[16:56] I believe that is in Genesis six seven
[16:59] one of the two but anyway he had to
[17:01] confuse the language because they were
[17:02] building a tower up to heaven so they
[17:06] had tapped into God's laboratory and
[17:09] that's all science is without God's Word
[17:13] they would have never been what we call
[17:15] science and science came by way of the
[17:18] fall you don't know that because God
[17:22] didn't have to give school lessons to
[17:25] Adam and Eve the fact they were so
[17:28] intelligent Adam named the animals
[17:30] without God
[17:31] telling him what to name him and God
[17:33] says Amen because he had the mind of God
[17:36] and God doesn't have to learn by school
[17:39] and for your information there won't be
[17:42] any kind of schooling over there not
[17:46] like we know it now
[17:48] there won't be no failures and no
[17:49] passing and flunking and all that no see
[17:51] average is Amen so let us turn to
[17:55] Genesis 1:1 and it reads in the
[18:01] beginning God created the heavens and
[18:06] the earth let us pray Heavenly Father we
[18:11] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[18:13] we thank you for being so good to us
[18:16] Lord you have been better to us than we
[18:19] have been to ourselves and father we
[18:22] pray tonight that you would help us Lord
[18:25] in this study bless your people give us
[18:29] grace to to speak the words that you
[18:33] would have us to speak we thank you for
[18:35] all things Lord because all things are
[18:38] of you and your name Jesus Christ as we
[18:40] pray let us say Amen you may be seated
[18:49] first of all we understand by God's
[18:51] grace that God created a lot of times
[18:56] people say well see there was something
[18:59] going on because the next verse it says
[19:02] in the earth was without shape and void
[19:06] but we realized that when God spoke
[19:10] there in Genesis God created the heavens
[19:15] and the earth and when he said let there
[19:16] be it was so we don't know he doesn't
[19:20] tell us because at the end of that verse
[19:22] is a period and what happened in between
[19:26] that in the second verse we don't know
[19:28] God didn't tell us and he doesn't have
[19:31] to the point of Genesis was that he was
[19:34] the one who created if you take a
[19:37] Genesis I mean sue st. John 1:1 the
[19:39] Bible says let's go there let's go there
[19:42] and then we'll come back
[19:45] I love the book of John John John was
[19:50] showed a lot of shown a lot of things
[19:52] that a lot of the other disciples didn't
[19:55] get because John was really close to the
[19:57] heart of God st. John 1:1 is that you
[20:02] know in the beginning was the word and
[20:04] the Word was with God and the Word was
[20:07] God
[20:07] right so I wanted to subject this
[20:11] message one God one book and one verse
[20:19] so that you can understand that
[20:21] everything is relative everything
[20:23] relates to each other because God
[20:26] created when God created everything it
[20:29] was good you know we understand what
[20:32] happened when it comes to Satan but
[20:36] everything happened because God spoke it
[20:40] you know in the beginning when we think
[20:43] about God we think about worship well
[20:48] even before there was worship God was
[20:50] what we call el him he was the self
[20:54] existing one and understand I said self
[20:58] existing one one okay because the Bible
[21:04] said God didn't say gods
[21:06] God created so we understand that this
[21:09] self existing one was the fountain of
[21:13] all intelligence all purity he was God
[21:18] now you and I can't understand that we
[21:21] must take him by faith because we only
[21:25] know a beginning and an ending but
[21:28] Elohim the self existing one means that
[21:31] he existed he had no beginning and he
[21:36] had no ending he's eternal and of course
[21:40] all of the finite minds can't comprehend
[21:42] what that is but I like to say when God
[21:47] the Bible says in the beginning God
[21:48] created the heavens and the earth that's
[21:51] why I said one verse universe one verse
[21:56] universe oh I like that
[21:58] because uni means one and verse means
[22:01] first by that one verse everything was
[22:06] created heaven and earth and that one
[22:12] verse unfolded itself into what we call
[22:16] books but with all of these books
[22:20] there's only one Bible and that one
[22:24] Bible came by one voice which was God's
[22:28] voice and so you and I must understand
[22:32] that everything is so well connected
[22:35] before the far we we we believe that
[22:40] heaven and earth was connected and
[22:43] whatever went on in heaven Adam saw and
[22:47] he knew one man described it he said the
[22:52] choir of heaven was so powerful and so
[22:57] well known by Adam it would wake him up
[22:59] with music in the morning now whether it
[23:03] be all true or not we understand that
[23:05] somehow heaven and earth was connected
[23:08] because sin is the thing that brought
[23:12] the breach brought a chasm brought a
[23:17] separation between God and man and all
[23:22] of these things were still in the plan
[23:24] of God because God who is the creator
[23:28] created all things we understand that
[23:33] when he speaks of creation you and I
[23:37] must understand that even in the way of
[23:41] we consider evil it was Lucifer who
[23:46] perverted the word and in in by
[23:49] perverting that word evil came into
[23:53] existence even in this world because you
[23:58] and I must understand by the grace of
[24:00] God that when this evil was brought
[24:05] forth he corrupted the creation of God
[24:10] just like it did in in Genesis
[24:12] God didn't create the earth boy but we
[24:18] understand something took place that
[24:20] made it void and God at that point had
[24:24] to separate light from the darkness just
[24:26] like he's doing now because the Bible
[24:29] declared that Jesus Christ is the Alpha
[24:33] and the Omega the beginning and the
[24:36] ending and if he separated darkness from
[24:39] light in the beginning he had to
[24:41] separate darkness from light at the end
[24:45] and we understand by God's grace that
[24:51] according to John that John declared
[24:55] Jesus Christ not as the work just as the
[24:58] word but he was he was the light of men
[25:02] he was the revelation of what a real man
[25:07] was to be had him when he fell he
[25:10] perverted it and since Adam we never saw
[25:16] a real man we just saw something that
[25:18] looked like one something that acted
[25:21] like one but the true man was to be in
[25:25] the very image and likeness of God and
[25:29] that fall brought men into the image of
[25:32] Adam not God so we understand by God's
[25:37] grace that like I said everything is
[25:38] connected so that you can understand
[25:40] what I'm saying
[25:42] I'm standing here today but a few
[25:48] minutes ago I was in the past if I stand
[25:52] here long enough I will become the
[25:53] future but I'm still standing here
[25:57] because time moves on and it's connected
[26:02] it is so connected that God could even
[26:06] ask job where were you when the sons of
[26:10] God shouted and sang for joy it is so
[26:14] connected Amen that Jesus could actually
[26:17] say a God could say to Jeremiah I knew
[26:20] you before you were form into your
[26:23] mother's womb I call
[26:26] do to be a prophet is that right it is
[26:29] so connected that God could see
[26:32] according to Isaiah nine and six a
[26:35] virgin or 69 a virgin shall conceive and
[26:40] bring forth the son and his name shall
[26:44] be called Emmanuel God with us
[26:49] hallelujah that means that these words
[26:54] that went out was just our herring or an
[26:59] announcement of something that had
[27:02] already been is that right because
[27:05] there's no new thing under the Sun you
[27:07] and I must understand that because we
[27:10] are in time doesn't mean that we're not
[27:13] somewhere else is that right it's true
[27:20] the Bible declare that I am now setting
[27:23] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus but I
[27:27] stand here preaching to you and as I
[27:32] preach to you now and now there I am
[27:36] preaching to you because as I am now I
[27:41] am there also is that right yes because
[27:45] Paul says listen when you see me I will
[27:48] be known even as I am known the
[27:55] resurrection it's not an action and I'm
[28:01] kind of jumping a little bit but the
[28:02] resurrection is not an action that make
[28:09] you different how can I say it like to
[28:13] resurrect something is to bring
[28:15] something back that once was not
[28:19] something different it has to be the
[28:21] same thing that went down to come back
[28:24] is that is that right when God
[28:28] resurrected Lazarus he didn't come forth
[28:30] as somebody else that was Lazarus now he
[28:35] came back in a brand new body but he
[28:39] still was as
[28:41] hallelujah is that right so I'm saying
[28:44] all of these things is this when God
[28:47] created Adam Adam was like a seed and
[28:53] every man a woman was in Adam because he
[29:00] was the original tree somebody help me
[29:03] here as they say amen you can count the
[29:07] seeds in an apple but you cannot count
[29:11] the apples that's in the seed is that
[29:15] right because we understand there's only
[29:18] those people who came from Adam and Eve
[29:20] is what we're now Express is expressing
[29:24] right now right think about it one man
[29:29] and one woman is the cause of billions
[29:33] time billions time billions of people on
[29:37] the face of the earth oh yeah you said
[29:42] well how come brother Brooks because you
[29:43] got to understand the serpent was wiped
[29:45] out but the mixture of him it's the
[29:50] thing that calls him to continue right
[29:53] so you said whoa what are you trying to
[29:55] tell me brother books I'm trying to get
[29:57] to something because we realized by
[30:00] God's grace that your names when God
[30:03] created everything before he even made
[30:07] it manifest in his mind he saw you he
[30:13] knew your name that which was spiritual
[30:17] is first Adam was spirit man first then
[30:22] God formed him from the dust of the
[30:24] earth hallelujah you said that can be it
[30:29] is true because even Jeremiah was spirit
[30:32] man first before God brought him here so
[30:35] are you in the mind of God he saw you
[30:39] spirit before he saw you flesh hello
[30:44] you don't believe it I'm saying like
[30:46] this then before Jesus was flesh he was
[30:49] spirit first he was the son of God
[30:53] and while you say son because elohim
[30:56] formed himself into what we call a word
[31:00] which is the logos right and that logos
[31:06] created everything is that right but see
[31:10] the logos was still God in a in a
[31:13] different form we call it amalfi he
[31:16] masked himself he clothed himself in
[31:19] light and he created he was the word and
[31:26] the Word was with God and the Word was
[31:29] God
[31:30] well somebody help me here because you
[31:34] got to realize amen we were with God
[31:39] that part of us was with God we were in
[31:43] God with a very attributes of God
[31:46] otherwise you couldn't you you don't
[31:49] have eternal life only that which came
[31:52] from God is redeemable redeem means to
[31:57] bring back so you've got to find your
[32:01] position you got to come to identify
[32:04] yourself you and either with God or you
[32:07] were not with God and if you were with
[32:10] God that's what pours on us folks didn't
[32:13] you it's God was pulling on you is that
[32:16] pull on you yeah understanding so that
[32:19] you can understand and you've heard me
[32:21] say this before when it comes to the the
[32:24] animals in those day dumb animals but
[32:28] God had a pool on them and brought them
[32:31] into the ark right
[32:34] those animals didn't say didn't say okay
[32:37] it's gonna rain and I better get in the
[32:38] Ark no God pulled them into the ark
[32:42] because they were elected and chosen by
[32:46] God is that right I want you to
[32:49] understand this because no matter how
[32:53] beastly they may have been when they
[32:57] entered the door which was Jesus their
[33:01] nature was changed
[33:07] hallelujah somehow the lion nature was
[33:11] changed where he can lay down with the
[33:13] lamb somebody help me here
[33:15] see that's what entering into Jesus
[33:19] Christ does it changes your nature
[33:26] hallelujah because we have a beastly
[33:29] nature but when we get into Christ then
[33:35] nature changes hallelujah from the
[33:39] beastly nature to the nature of God
[33:42] because that's what we were stripped
[33:45] from when Adam and Eve sinned with the
[33:48] Beast
[33:50] God took away his nature and for that Oh
[33:55] from that time on men became beasts you
[33:58] say that's not true well let me put it
[34:00] this way this is why Cain slew Abel came
[34:06] was a murderer he had on the beastly
[34:10] nature is that right but he still was
[34:14] part of Eve but he was part of the
[34:18] serpent as well and now after the flood
[34:22] amen it looked like it was a clear
[34:25] course for God but here was that serpent
[34:28] mixed in to the human race because
[34:31] that's what people who understand the
[34:32] serpent was not a snake the serpent was
[34:34] a man looking creature that was able to
[34:36] highbreed like a donkey and a horse
[34:39] bring forth the mule that's why your
[34:43] flesh is so stubborn yeah you got that
[34:47] mule nature in your flesh so anyway
[34:50] let's move on by God's grace I know
[34:52] everybody think he just hits around the
[34:55] tree whenever you've seen a snake talk
[34:58] this man or this thing if you go back to
[35:01] the book of Revelation book of
[35:02] Revelation calls him the serpent that
[35:04] man see so what was happening then in
[35:07] Genesis was happening in Revelation
[35:10] hallelujah because revelation revealed
[35:12] that the serpent in the garden was a man
[35:15] look like a man talk like a man now here
[35:18] I'm saying but he was not in the image
[35:23] completely like Adam but close enough to
[35:29] bring forth children but all of this was
[35:35] in God's plan and what Satan did was mix
[35:39] the light with the darkness
[35:40] God separated it and then the serpent
[35:43] mixed it again and you and I must
[35:46] understand this mixture has gone on
[35:48] forever
[35:49] this is why we continually die is that
[35:54] right I don't care what they say your
[35:57] vitamins don't work when God get ready
[36:00] for you to die you're gonna die and
[36:03] that's what people don't understand amen
[36:06] vitamins may give you a little healthier
[36:08] life but there are many people who are
[36:13] healthy that comes down come up with
[36:15] cancer and everything else runners that
[36:17] die before they finish the race so it
[36:20] ain't about all of that even though
[36:22] those things profit little toe as the
[36:25] Bible says but we don't want just so we
[36:29] can profit little we want to live in the
[36:33] beginning God created the universe and
[36:42] you and I must understand anything like
[36:45] I said when Jesus said according to st.
[36:49] John 14 in my father's house are many
[36:52] mansions see I'm not done I'm going to
[36:54] prepare a place for you that where I am
[36:56] there you may be also understand that
[37:00] place is only given to the redeemed
[37:02] those who are in the mind of God before
[37:05] the foundation of the world let me put
[37:07] it this way you are not me being the man
[37:11] I've got the germ of life in me for man
[37:15] child the woman doesn't have it she she
[37:17] brings forth the egg I bring forth the
[37:20] blood cell hello and all of my children
[37:24] that has been now manifested were in me
[37:27] I didn't know I didn't know who they
[37:31] were
[37:32] I didn't even know their names God knew
[37:34] where every one of them hallelujah and
[37:38] God used me I'm just a borrowed vessel
[37:42] but they really belong to God see and
[37:47] God will use me to bring them into this
[37:50] dimension you understand me in order to
[37:54] get to heaven you must have come from
[37:56] heaven I'm gonna get to it in just a
[38:01] moment I want you to understand so you
[38:04] can understand as I said we are in a
[38:07] position and we've heard the prophet of
[38:11] God say this many times
[38:12] radio waves coming through the room you
[38:16] can't hear it can you hear colors are
[38:19] coming through the room can you see them
[38:22] pictures are coming through the room
[38:24] right now can you see them no but to
[38:29] show you and prove to you that is
[38:31] possible because you got a TV
[38:34] you got a television and that crystal is
[38:38] able to channel into that other
[38:40] dimension and bring it here today is
[38:43] today but in South Africa today was
[38:47] yesterday but there yesterday is my
[38:51] today and my today is somebody else
[38:54] tomorrow but it's still relative it
[39:01] still connected because we can get on
[39:05] the phone and I can call somebody right
[39:06] now who's now experiencing yesterday and
[39:10] I can take from today and go into
[39:13] yesterday by the food yes and then I
[39:20] could take yesterday for somebody old in
[39:25] the East or some other time and I can
[39:28] talk to them I can defy what we call
[39:32] time because of scientific discoveries
[39:40] it shows that eternity exists
[39:44] time is just something that God placed
[39:48] us in and we came here to be tried we
[39:52] came here to be tested we came here so
[39:54] that we can know good from evil and
[39:57] that's what people don't understand why
[39:59] God created evil so you can understand
[40:03] what evil is God didn't have to be
[40:07] taught he knew and believed you mean God
[40:15] intended for us to go on and be he said
[40:18] be fruitful and multiply it was Eve who
[40:23] made the choice Adam who made the choice
[40:25] to plunge us into what we call evil and
[40:28] this is why God says now they know good
[40:30] and evil so that you can understand and
[40:34] this is what I love about it it's a
[40:36] beautiful love story because you and I
[40:39] know that the God who created or allowed
[40:41] this perversion to come forth and then
[40:44] one day we'll do away completely with it
[40:49] hallelujah but without this evil we
[40:52] would have never appreciated heaven
[40:56] hallelujah
[40:57] like you heard me say you can't you said
[41:00] oh I love I love I love but when that
[41:02] person do something contrary to you
[41:05] that's when your love is tested that's
[41:08] when your love is tried hallelujah
[41:10] that's when you come to understand how
[41:13] much you love that person it was
[41:16] necessary the contrast was necessary to
[41:21] manifest right without the darkness you
[41:24] can't understand light it was necessary
[41:26] that darkness would be here so that you
[41:29] can see what light is ask a man who's
[41:33] born blind who's never seen is Allah in
[41:36] his life and one day his eyes are open
[41:42] I'll tell you what you talking about a
[41:46] rejoicing now is not only was he here
[41:51] but he now see what light is before then
[41:55] he couldn't see he could only in
[41:58] imagine in his mind what light was
[42:01] hallelujah
[42:03] so is it with the believer without the
[42:05] darkness you only imagine what light is
[42:08] but when light comes it's like opening
[42:11] up a blind man's eye you now see all of
[42:15] those things that you thought was
[42:18] harmful and it really wasn't when you
[42:24] can come to see that you are sons and
[42:26] daughters of God not just happen to be
[42:30] but born to be hallelujah
[42:34] like I was telling somebody the other
[42:35] day I said it I said understand the
[42:38] anointing we were up there in
[42:40] Pennsylvania nor not done nothing fell
[42:43] and I mean who the people were just
[42:44] worshiping the Lord worshiping the Lord
[42:46] and the Holy Spirit just moved me and
[42:48] says just calm it down some and let it
[42:52] saturate your soul and what the Lord was
[42:56] showing me is like a rain shower a rain
[42:59] shower it rains but that rain didn't
[43:02] come just wet your flesh it came to
[43:07] saturate the seed is that all right
[43:12] there's a boy I used to walk in this in
[43:15] the rain and I oh I love rain and still
[43:17] do but I walk in the rain and everything
[43:20] else and like you've heard me say it was
[43:22] it was even rain was really nice to fall
[43:24] on you it felt good you know showers and
[43:26] all that but you know as a child you
[43:28] know I used to say I didn't want the
[43:32] rain to just follow my head I want to
[43:34] see how teeth hello somebody better not
[43:39] try that now they're just it's just too
[43:40] bad it's got too many chemicals now you
[43:44] come up with a sore throat or something
[43:45] but you know the truth of the matter is
[43:47] it did something in other words the rain
[43:51] didn't come to change you what you are
[43:53] already ah it came to manifest what you
[43:59] are the Spirit of God comes to manifest
[44:03] who and what you are is that right have
[44:08] the rain ever change the orange tree
[44:11] into an apple one
[44:12] well I have the rain ever changed our
[44:15] pear tree into a watermelon vine or
[44:19] plant or whatever no it only manifested
[44:22] the life that was in the seed this is
[44:27] what the message come that ladder and
[44:30] farmer rain comes to teach you who you
[44:34] are and comes to anoint what you've been
[44:36] taught to bring forth the life and
[44:39] character of Christ hallelujah if you're
[44:43] born to W is just the devil
[44:45] people say ho say it like that you know
[44:48] people can't handle that but the Bible
[44:50] said Judas was the son of perdition
[44:52] meaning he was born a devil how do you
[44:58] know whether you be devil or not I said
[45:02] like this the Bible says my sheep hear
[45:04] my voice and a strain that they will not
[45:07] follow if you can hear the voice of God
[45:12] speaking to you it proves you not of
[45:16] this world but of another world
[45:19] hallelujah
[45:21] you ever thought about it how did when
[45:23] God called Peter James and John they
[45:25] quit their jobs they just went and
[45:27] followed why they were sheep they were
[45:31] no is that right oh come on somebody
[45:34] because Jesus even told his disciples I
[45:37] knew you before the foundation of the
[45:41] world I called you you know it's like we
[45:45] always thought God says well this one
[45:48] looked like he could follow me that one
[45:51] no watch the scripture God went in
[45:54] certain areas and certain directions and
[45:57] caused certain people you think they
[46:01] were only one standing there I'm waiting
[46:02] on Jesus no they were most a lot of
[46:05] people even Matthew the tax collector at
[46:07] that time was still beating people out
[46:09] of money and Jesus said follow me and
[46:12] his disciples got upset because he
[46:15] called Matthew they knew what kind of
[46:18] crook he was but you see on the inside
[46:21] of Matthew was a seed of God you and I
[46:25] we come
[46:25] as well looking like a kookaburra but
[46:28] inside it's what God is interested in
[46:31] that's why we can't just even as sinners
[46:34] we could not just fit in we couldn't
[46:36] just go with the flow we always felt
[46:39] guilty we'd always felt condemned when
[46:41] we did evil didn't know why we felt odd
[46:44] Amen different from everybody else
[46:47] because you are different from everybody
[46:49] else God is trying to give you your
[46:53] identity on who you are by the word oh
[46:59] lord help me Jesus
[47:02] you see even Ibaka says listen when the
[47:05] vision is very plain upon these tables
[47:09] that you may run that readeth did you
[47:12] know one time books were Bibles like
[47:14] Moses on tables of stone and all that
[47:18] then from there it was on the animal
[47:20] skin you know how the process went and
[47:23] the Bible says even your heart once was
[47:26] a table of stone but now God has
[47:29] transformed your heart into a heart of
[47:31] flesh and God has written his word where
[47:34] within the heart this is why the Holy
[47:36] Ghost is important if you can't even
[47:39] read and you get the Holy Ghost you're
[47:41] gonna know right from wrong because it's
[47:43] Christ the Spirit in you that's teaching
[47:46] you and the Bible said he would teach
[47:48] you and lead you into all truth is this
[47:51] okay you must understand Amen that this
[47:55] this is not some rolling of the dice
[47:59] what I hope somebody believe my story
[48:02] I hope somebody understand that I
[48:07] suffered for them no God knew you
[48:13] understand me we were in the pawnshop
[48:15] Satan put us in the pawnshop well let's
[48:20] put it this way he put us in the pest
[48:22] house you know the pest house is disease
[48:25] flesh a place where disease flesh is
[48:28] taken
[48:29] remember when smallpox and all these
[48:32] diseases in that they put quarantine on
[48:36] the door so you wouldn't contaminate
[48:39] some
[48:39] and that's what we are without Christ
[48:42] we're living in a pest house we're
[48:45] living in a body that's contaminated and
[48:49] you and I must understand what God did
[48:51] for us you and I must understand that he
[48:54] came looking for his own yard and heard
[48:56] the ego story it doesn't matter the
[48:59] Eagle lost his is eggs and sometimes the
[49:03] eggs are in the chicken coop or whatever
[49:06] but the egg is the thing that makes the
[49:09] difference and a chicken can make a
[49:16] Eagles eggs hatch a dog can do it if you
[49:21] put that egg and it keeps the right
[49:22] temperature you can do it and you and I
[49:26] must understand it didn't matter no
[49:28] matter what denomination you were
[49:30] hatched in if you are an eagle you are
[49:34] eagle in the beginning you just don't
[49:37] transform into a eagle is what you are
[49:41] from the beginning and what Satan has
[49:45] done he's disfigured us he's literally
[49:48] in our flash makers thing we're so evil
[49:51] was so unworthy to be saved and God has
[49:54] already saved you from the foundation of
[49:56] the world and now this day in this time
[49:59] you recognizing what Kaveri was all
[50:02] about it was redemption paying a price
[50:07] for what Adam and Eve did it was blood
[50:10] in the Genesis and the dead for blood
[50:13] had to be shed shed to redeem us no man
[50:18] was worthy I don't care how old Moses
[50:21] wasn't Joshua wasn't none of those great
[50:24] men's nor nobody was worthy could nobody
[50:27] could redeem us it took a god body
[50:32] hallelujah it took a man who was created
[50:35] by God himself
[50:37] and I know what people say Oh Mary was
[50:40] the mother of Jesus he never called her
[50:42] mother
[50:43] he called her woman she was the first
[50:45] incubator because if you read the
[50:49] scripture when she saw Jesus
[50:52] had left and couldn't find him she ran
[50:55] up to and says Jesus your father and I
[50:59] we lookin for you and Jesus says my
[51:02] father I'm about my father's business in
[51:07] other words he was denying her claim to
[51:11] be mother and Joseph II father his birth
[51:17] was supernatural read the scripture
[51:19] his blood was created by God
[51:23] his body was created by God otherwise he
[51:27] would have come in as a sinner
[51:30] hallelujah but he was not therefore when
[51:34] he was born his theophany was there see
[51:38] your theophany have we bypassed it
[51:41] because of the sin the word body which
[51:44] is God's body that he created without
[51:47] hand you don't know that I know you know
[51:51] that Paul said I look for city whose
[51:54] builder and maker is God and understand
[51:59] you so a city you're the city jesus said
[52:02] you are city that sets on a hill that
[52:04] cannot be here and the Bible said know
[52:07] ye not that you are the temple of God
[52:10] you are the temple that right come out
[52:14] says oh don't look for God up in heaven
[52:16] don't look for God over here there said
[52:19] God is not the even in your mouth oh no
[52:26] no when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[52:29] become a true son and daughter of God
[52:32] that's why Jesus says Abba Father which
[52:36] means our Father who art in heaven
[52:43] Philip said Lord show us the father and
[52:46] it suffices us and Jesus said unto Him
[52:47] have I been so long time with you and
[52:51] yet has thou not known me Philip says
[52:54] show me the father and she said have I
[52:56] not been with you so long you have not
[53:01] known me
[53:05] that seeing me have seen the father what
[53:08] was it the Bible said the fullness of
[53:11] the Godhead bodily dwelt in him that was
[53:15] God in human flesh God came down is that
[53:20] right that's what that's what I just
[53:21] said
[53:22] his name shall be called Emmanuel and
[53:24] Emmanuel means God with us here was
[53:30] Emmanuel God in a human body what was it
[53:34] he did the same thing that he did in
[53:37] Genesis with the first Adam it was God
[53:41] and Adam feeling and touching and
[53:44] communicating with the natural he Lord
[53:47] Himself hmm you said well you tell Matt
[53:51] listen the Bible said Adam was made in
[53:53] the image and likeness of God and he at
[53:56] that point in time he's not talking
[53:57] about the flesh he's talking about
[53:58] spirit the very image of Adam was the
[54:02] very God you said what do you talking
[54:06] about he he was he said what are you
[54:10] saying brother Brooks listen the Bible
[54:12] said that Jesus called us his brethren
[54:16] brethren that means we born of the same
[54:19] substance whoever his mother and father
[54:22] is is our mama and daddy-doo someone to
[54:27] heal me
[54:27] that's the word and you said what
[54:31] brothers what are you trying to tell me
[54:32] I'm trying to tell you just like I said
[54:35] the other day not here this thing has
[54:37] been so fixed and people don't like it
[54:40] but I can't help my daddy is God I'm
[54:45] gonna own up to that whether I look like
[54:48] it or not you know that people say well
[54:49] you know you look just like your daddy I
[54:53] can't see I can look in the mirror can't
[54:56] see it but they can see it better than
[54:58] me
[54:58] oh I can't and sometimes I look in the
[55:01] mirror and I can see a little bit of
[55:02] resemble it's not what God when God
[55:05] listen the Bible said they call them
[55:08] first Christians at Antioch not because
[55:12] of what they wore but because of their
[55:15] deeds because of their action because of
[55:17] their character
[55:18] was reflecting Jesus they act like him
[55:21] they talk like him they walk like him
[55:23] and the miracles followed them just like
[55:26] Jesus see being a Christian is not
[55:29] wearing anything on your shirt but it's
[55:33] okay to wear it we wear a thing else
[55:36] leave our jeans and you don't take the
[55:39] Levi's off of it you know it just
[55:44] whatever you wear the point is their
[55:47] name brands and we allow those name
[55:51] brands to remain whether it be shoes
[55:54] shirts or anything to our and I got off
[55:57] on something but my point is there is no
[55:59] scripture against it
[56:05] the point is that God comes to a place
[56:07] that he wants to be tangible that was
[56:12] the whole point because Adam before he
[56:15] was formed in the earth he was actually
[56:18] as in this dr. - II and he led the
[56:20] animals then but God wanted him to
[56:24] commune in a way that the animals can
[56:27] actually see him and feel him and God
[56:31] formed him out of the dust of the earth
[56:33] hello the whole purpose about God is
[56:37] becoming tangible the Bible said no man
[56:40] have seen God at any time also true but
[56:46] you and I must understand by God's grace
[56:48] that in the beginning God wanted to do
[56:51] something let me read a quote here then
[56:54] see God came down and the character of
[56:57] God was Christ he was the reflection he
[57:00] was God made visible notice God made
[57:04] visible in the beginning was God he
[57:07] wasn't even God then no God is an object
[57:10] of worship only thing he was was eternal
[57:14] and in him was attributes and those
[57:16] attributes were thoughts and those
[57:18] thoughts were expressed to words and
[57:20] words were made manifest for an example
[57:25] before you commit adultery you've
[57:27] already thought about it and those
[57:31] thoughts become worse
[57:32] and those words become action that's
[57:36] what happens but at first it was a
[57:38] thought did y'all know your thoughts
[57:42] ring louder in heaven and earth God
[57:45] hears every thought right now it rings
[57:50] louder so it shows it meant that this
[57:53] dimension is confined because you can't
[57:56] hear my thoughts unless God give me
[57:58] discernment and then it's not me as God
[58:01] you understand me but in heaven God
[58:05] hears your thoughts that right don't be
[58:11] alarmed
[58:12] Lucifer thought he was hiding it - and
[58:16] God said I have heard your thoughts and
[58:18] in your thoughts you have said see
[58:22] hadn't even come out of his mouth yet
[58:24] and God had already discerned it what is
[58:26] it it's all God becoming tangible and
[58:30] you are part of God and Jesus come to
[58:32] redeem those that was put on where the
[58:35] Lamb's Book of Life
[58:36] before the founders in the world it was
[58:39] God's thoughts and that's what he come
[58:42] to redeem and them as long as it strikes
[58:45] to them they see it because the life is
[58:47] in there but if life isn't in there then
[58:51] what can they do see they don't see it
[58:53] they'll never see it and the whole thing
[58:56] is Jesus said at that day you'll know
[59:00] that I'm in the father and the father's
[59:02] in me I am in you and you and me see
[59:05] what I'm saying it began to become true
[59:09] as a knowledge increase we understand
[59:12] who we are what we should have been and
[59:14] so we press amen to go into what we
[59:17] ought to be that city that God is
[59:23] preparing is not for sinners it's not
[59:26] for anything but those who were
[59:27] redeemable oh I'm enjoying Jesus and you
[59:34] and I must understand that we when it
[59:36] comes to God you and I must understand
[59:39] in that that God is not counting his
[59:42] sheep he knows the number already
[59:47] and he said I'll never lose one never
[59:53] lose one
[59:58] how can it be what Jesus says I'm the
[1:00:01] Alpha and the Omega the beginning and
[1:00:03] the ending saith the Lord which is which
[1:00:06] was and which is to come the Almighty
[1:00:08] and if he is the Almighty and there be
[1:00:12] another God that means he got no he has
[1:00:14] no might cuz Jesus got it all and you
[1:00:19] must understand that there oh yeah you
[1:00:21] got to understand this is why we must
[1:00:23] understand character we must understand
[1:00:26] the divine nature of God the divine
[1:00:29] nature of God is not something that we
[1:00:31] have an option it must be and it ain't
[1:00:34] something you can produce on your own
[1:00:36] that divine nature can only be produced
[1:00:39] if the seed of God is in you and if that
[1:00:42] seat is quickened it will bring forth
[1:00:45] like apples and oranges of his kind is
[1:00:52] that Alright you sure what do you mean
[1:00:55] brother Brooks there was a story told
[1:00:58] about a man who was walking down this
[1:01:01] country road or walking down this road
[1:01:02] and got hit by a car and when he got hit
[1:01:06] by the car his body went up in the air
[1:01:09] and landed five years or more after that
[1:01:13] somebody else was going the same way and
[1:01:16] he hit this man with the same
[1:01:19] description of the man that had gotten
[1:01:21] hit five years ago and was dead and not
[1:01:26] only that there were witnesses look it
[1:01:28] up you can look it up there was
[1:01:30] witnesses who actually saw this man fly
[1:01:36] in the air and land and when they went
[1:01:39] out to see them they find a man in front
[1:01:41] of God he wasn't there what was it it
[1:01:44] was a dimension that you and I need to
[1:01:47] recognize is there hallelujah there are
[1:01:52] two worlds you either from beneath or
[1:01:55] you from above is that right that was a
[1:01:58] lesson
[1:01:59] it meant that
[1:02:00] Jesus taught his disciples he said amen
[1:02:04] you can't understand me because you're
[1:02:07] not from above and I'm from above my
[1:02:12] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[1:02:15] will not follow don't shut down on God
[1:02:19] you and I must understand that this is
[1:02:22] not something hard to understand it's
[1:02:24] simple that's why you know we understand
[1:02:31] that we must be born again this old
[1:02:36] flesh and blood will not get into the
[1:02:38] heavens
[1:02:39] it cannot it will not enter into heaven
[1:02:44] oh it's absolutely the truth and it
[1:02:50] doesn't matter because the point is when
[1:02:53] God says something he means exactly what
[1:02:55] he says you saw our brother what are you
[1:02:58] saying I want you to understand that the
[1:03:00] theophany is a different body it's a
[1:03:02] word body it doesn't breathe because
[1:03:09] he's eternal breath was only given to
[1:03:11] this dimension and when the breath is
[1:03:15] given up you're gone hello
[1:03:18] but God don't have to breathe he is God
[1:03:21] he created the breath hallelujah and you
[1:03:26] and I must understand that the Optio
[1:03:28] there doesn't eat nor sleep but this
[1:03:32] body needs to eat and sleep this body
[1:03:35] doesn't grow old over there he said it
[1:03:39] doesn't exist it does the Bible tells me
[1:03:42] that when Jesus was on Mount
[1:03:43] Transfiguration Moses and Elijah
[1:03:46] appeared it wasn't a vision it was
[1:03:49] opening up the portal that you can see
[1:03:52] that these men were living in a
[1:03:54] different dimension yet they were
[1:03:56] standing on the mountain hallelujah it's
[1:04:00] just like the property God he says now
[1:04:01] I'm looking to another dimension I can
[1:04:03] see you but he was standing in this one
[1:04:07] and looking in the other ones this is
[1:04:10] what the Word of God does it opens up
[1:04:12] portal
[1:04:13] opens up the vision it begins to make us
[1:04:16] see who we are where we had it where we
[1:04:19] came from and it takes away Oh fear
[1:04:25] hallelujah
[1:04:26] it's not taste not touch not handle not
[1:04:29] that has nothing to do with it
[1:04:31] because you and I have been chosen by
[1:04:34] God and we have an unconditional
[1:04:36] covenant God has come to redeem his own
[1:04:40] that's what it's all about
[1:04:42] it ain't don't do this don't do that is
[1:04:44] God coming to redeem you and pulling you
[1:04:48] through bringing you through I used to
[1:04:50] work poor but he don't pull but he
[1:04:51] brings you through he leads you through
[1:04:53] the portal he knows the way home
[1:05:00] hallelujah Christ in you see he is the
[1:05:04] Redeemer he comes what a redeemed to do
[1:05:07] what pick up that which was fallen to
[1:05:10] redeem back to the place where he was at
[1:05:13] the beginning that's why the Word of God
[1:05:16] has been given unto us that after God
[1:05:18] opened the seals it placed us back in
[1:05:21] that position what position before the
[1:05:24] fall of Adam but if you don't believe it
[1:05:27] you will never benefit from it faith
[1:05:30] comes by hearing hearing the Word of God
[1:05:33] and if you can believe that God has put
[1:05:35] you back there you can ask whatever you
[1:05:38] will is that right the authority in
[1:05:40] which God gave Adam before the fall has
[1:05:43] returned back to the bride of Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ but we got to have faith to
[1:05:47] believe it and to put it in action
[1:05:51] hallelujah
[1:05:53] that's why the blind eyes are open
[1:05:55] that's why the dead is raised that's why
[1:05:58] I can say is heal that's why you name it
[1:06:01] why those things those gains of death is
[1:06:04] it comes from this dimension hallelujah
[1:06:08] that dimension that has fallen but
[1:06:11] healing comes from a different dimension
[1:06:13] healing comes from God is that right and
[1:06:16] the Bible said that God healed all of
[1:06:19] your diseases
[1:06:20] I will not solve all of them it comes
[1:06:24] from a different dimension
[1:06:26] the only light that can conquer darkness
[1:06:29] hello somebody let me move on he come to
[1:06:36] redeem not this cannon fodder that we
[1:06:39] see around professing to be Christians
[1:06:41] but that he came to redeem that's what's
[1:06:45] God's thinking at the beginning this
[1:06:47] other is just something that's mixed
[1:06:49] around to show the statue she in other
[1:06:53] words of God in the flower garden that
[1:06:55] plays a part
[1:06:56] but the statute is what you want to see
[1:06:58] the statue of Christ which God projected
[1:07:03] to the earth in the full of a man that
[1:07:06] statue you want to see that's the one
[1:07:09] the other is just make up pause you see
[1:07:12] this reflects his loving noble character
[1:07:15] God reflected in a man called Christ he
[1:07:18] was the only one that could do this this
[1:07:21] was no other character in heaven could
[1:07:23] do it see is that right John said no man
[1:07:26] was found worthy to open the book in the
[1:07:29] loose the seals thereof none I will use
[1:07:32] that scripture when the devil comes to
[1:07:33] me don't see you ain't enough of the
[1:07:35] hypocrisy you ain't doing this and you
[1:07:36] ain't doing that
[1:07:37] I said listen no man was worthy but the
[1:07:40] man that was worthy his name was Jesus
[1:07:42] Christ and he has redeemed me and guess
[1:07:45] what devil he lives in me that's why the
[1:07:49] Bob said who is gonna lay in the charge
[1:07:51] the gods he let it is God who justify it
[1:07:56] hallelujah that's right no man has
[1:08:01] ascended up into heaven but he that came
[1:08:03] down from heaven even the Son of Man
[1:08:05] which is in heaven never read the rest
[1:08:09] of the Bible here in John 3:12 in 15
[1:08:11] says if I told you earthly things and
[1:08:14] you believe me not how shall ye believe
[1:08:17] me if I tell you of heavenly things huh
[1:08:21] how God gonna tell you how you gonna
[1:08:24] believe God if you can't believe that
[1:08:26] God can heal and deliver I'm telling you
[1:08:29] the earthly things God God can you know
[1:08:32] it's amazing because those prosperity
[1:08:35] people those one who preach prosperity
[1:08:36] they do a good job at it and those
[1:08:39] people have faith
[1:08:40] and it happens and yet we who are bride
[1:08:44] struggles why we need to key in the
[1:08:49] faith
[1:08:50] let God energize it let him quicken it
[1:08:54] let me say it like this just like I said
[1:08:56] the other day up in Pennsylvania this
[1:08:59] thing isn't it it never work without
[1:09:02] prayer you can say what you want to say

[1:09:53] Holy Spirit and so do you even though
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost is in you you still must
[1:09:59] submit to his will that's the character
[1:10:02] that Christ has come to get it is to do
[1:10:04] what he says I always do the Father's
[1:10:08] will
[1:10:08] his whole ambition was to do the will of
[1:10:11] the word that's what made him the word

[1:12:25] win the life mmm that looks for me he
[1:12:29] didn't say that but that's it that was
[1:12:30] his action so he began to walk in the

[1:14:05] theologians of his day he said ye are
[1:14:09] from beneath what that means there's a
[1:14:11] world from beneath and even the world no

[1:14:46] never had that in America until
[1:14:47] Hollywood start showing it and what did
[1:14:51] it do because what people don't
[1:14:52] understand is the television it's a
[1:14:54] portal it's an avenue that demons go in
[1:14:58] and out and they come and they're not
[1:14:59] you why are you looking and you don't

[1:15:41] sure you do yeah from beneath I am from
[1:15:49] above ye all of this world and I am not
[1:15:53] of this world
[1:15:54] so Jesus there's another world I'm from
[1:15:56] a different one I said therefore to you
[1:15:58] that ye shall die in your sins for if
[1:16:01] you believe not that I am he
[1:16:03] yo shisha diners eat talking to the
[1:16:06] religious people of his day
[1:16:09] denominational in organizations who
[1:16:11] thought they had Jesus they had it all
[1:16:13] under control
[1:16:14] and here was God wrapped in fresh
[1:16:16] walking as a peasant and they missed him
[1:16:19] cuz God doesn't come with his greatness
[1:16:22] and that's the dust that's that's the
[1:16:24] mentality of the people today when they
[1:16:27] see the mega church and they see all
[1:16:28] these great things
[1:16:29] Oh God got to be in there God hides
[1:16:32] himself in simplicity he could have been
[1:16:36] born in a castle yet he was born in a
[1:16:40] manger he could have went to the finest
[1:16:43] city that was yet he decided to become a
[1:16:47] Nazarite and live in nazareth and if he
[1:16:52] know any history about nazareth nasa was
[1:16:54] one of the wickedest cities ever even so
[1:16:57] the disciples when they said that he's a
[1:16:59] Nazarite he came from never they say can
[1:17:03] that's how bad it was is there any good
[1:17:06] there murderers and thieves and all
[1:17:09] mongers and all of that was in that city
[1:17:11] and here was Jesus but you got to
[1:17:13] understand great is the menorah the
[1:17:16] better the fruit that's why God put us
[1:17:20] in this age the manure the trash what we
[1:17:28] have to come up through hello I know
[1:17:30] that sounds really bad but that's the
[1:17:32] way it is
[1:17:35] one more thing i'ma let you go because
[1:17:37] of the time and he's available for any
[1:17:42] sincere person who asked st. John 7 7
[1:17:46] through 11 said ask and it shall be
[1:17:47] given you seek and ye shall find knock
[1:17:49] and it shall be opened for everyone that
[1:17:52] ask is ask if that means continuous
[1:17:54] receiveth and he that seeketh findeth
[1:17:57] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:18:00] opened that means that don't mean that
[1:18:04] means continue to knock that means
[1:18:06] continue to ask that means continue to
[1:18:08] seek is that right what man is there of
[1:18:11] you whom if his son ask bread would give
[1:18:15] him a stone or if we ask a fish would
[1:18:19] give him a serpent now watch what he
[1:18:21] says what man is there of you whom if
[1:18:25] his son the key word is son because he
[1:18:31] says listen my son I will open they
[1:18:34] gonna ask they're gonna seek they're
[1:18:36] gonna knock and my son I'm gonna give
[1:18:38] them Living bread he said then if then
[1:18:41] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:18:44] unto his children how much more shall
[1:18:46] your father which is in heaven give you
[1:18:49] good things to them that ask him Jesus
[1:18:57] in 18th chapter of st. John's answered
[1:19:00] my kingdom is not of this world if my
[1:19:03] kingdom were of this world then would my
[1:19:05] servants fight that I should not be
[1:19:08] delivered to the Jews but now is my
[1:19:11] kingdom not from hence Pilate was asking
[1:19:16] him are you a king
[1:19:17] Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou
[1:19:20] a king then jesus answered thou sayeth
[1:19:25] that I am a king and to this end was I
[1:19:29] born and for this cause I came into the
[1:19:33] world that I should bear witness unto
[1:19:35] the truth listen and everyone that is of
[1:19:40] the truth heareth my voice right
[1:19:49] one moment please
[1:19:51] st. Luke 20 out this is not the end but
[1:19:54] I just have to stop here st. Luke 20 34
[1:19:57] to 38 and jesus answered and said to
[1:19:59] them the children of this world marry
[1:20:02] and are giving in marriage but they
[1:20:05] which shall be accounted worthy to
[1:20:07] obtain that world and the resurrection
[1:20:10] from the dead neither marry nor given in
[1:20:13] marriage
[1:20:14] neither can they die any more so what
[1:20:18] you saying he said now I want you to
[1:20:20] understand we marry here but we our
[1:20:24] kingdom is not of this world when we get
[1:20:26] to heaven
[1:20:27] your wife will not be your wife she'll
[1:20:30] be your sister your brother your daddy
[1:20:33] will be your brother there is no
[1:20:35] marriage marriage and and having sexual
[1:20:38] activity was only in this dimension it
[1:20:43] was to reproduce here it was by the fall
[1:20:46] that we produced by sex but in the
[1:20:50] beginning it was supposed to be the
[1:20:52] spoken word this is why when God
[1:20:55] redeemed men and Jesus Christ came and
[1:20:57] he sent the Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost is Christ in you and as
[1:21:01] your preaching and a person believes
[1:21:04] that spoken word quickens the seed and
[1:21:08] now he becomes a newborn child of God by
[1:21:13] the preaching of the word spoken word
[1:21:15] right because remember over there
[1:21:20] everything will be by word spoken word
[1:21:25] is the original seed hallelujah that's
[1:21:31] what we need to learn that we have the
[1:21:33] ability to speak now but you know what
[1:21:36] it can't be spoken by by hands of
[1:21:39] unbelief in doubt if you say to this
[1:21:42] mountain be thou moon and believe in
[1:21:46] your heart and doubt not that mountain
[1:21:48] must mean that's the way Jesus taught
[1:21:51] his children but they which shall be
[1:21:54] accounted worthy obtained that world and
[1:21:56] the resurrection from the dead neither
[1:21:57] marry nor given in marriage
[1:21:59] neither can they
[1:22:00] die anymore for they are equal unto the
[1:22:03] angels and are the children of God being
[1:22:07] the children of the Resurrection equal
[1:22:10] to what angels the messengers ello equal
[1:22:17] why we all had to come through Calvary
[1:22:21] they did been born again they just got
[1:22:24] different positions right you got a
[1:22:28] position they got a position but we all
[1:22:30] had to be born again we all died except
[1:22:34] Christ's coming our lives right
[1:22:36] because a true saint of God doesn't die
[1:22:38] he goes to sleep because we know that
[1:22:41] when we die we got someone to carry us
[1:22:44] over we don't go down we go up neither
[1:22:48] can they die anymore but they are equal
[1:22:51] into the angels and are the children of
[1:22:53] God being the children are what the
[1:22:56] resurrection that means to bring back up
[1:23:00] that which we're down now that the dead
[1:23:03] are raised even Moses showed at that
[1:23:05] Bush when he called the Lord the God of
[1:23:09] Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of
[1:23:11] Jacob for he is not a god of the dead
[1:23:14] but of the living for all live unto Him
[1:23:20] now I just tried to give a foundation of
[1:23:27] this message one God that's right one
[1:23:36] God one book in one verse and my sub
[1:23:39] topic was universe showing that we are
[1:23:42] all connected you know the world even
[1:23:44] know what like that they call it the
[1:23:45] circle of life whatever but the whole
[1:23:47] point is we're connected in order for us
[1:23:52] to live we must eat something that's
[1:23:54] dead whether it be plant or animal life
[1:23:58] it shows that the death burial
[1:24:00] resurrection in order to live something
[1:24:02] must die over there won't be like that
[1:24:06] there'll be no more death there'll be no
[1:24:09] more sorrow there be no more pain we'll
[1:24:11] go back to where we were wherever we
[1:24:14] were
[1:24:14] is that right remember when Jesus died
[1:24:16] the only thing he asked father I would
[1:24:19] that they be with me that's all he asked
[1:24:22] for he cares about the ones he redeemed
[1:24:27] because we are considered his bride
[1:24:29] we're the ones in the city universe and
[1:24:34] you know the Bible says summer break for
[1:24:36] 30 some 60 and 100 wherever your lot is
[1:24:39] is what you're going to bring forth no
[1:24:41] matter how you try it is God who do work
[1:24:45] it not him that work is God who work it
[1:24:50] and you and I must understand that God
[1:24:53] has a plan and he has everything in
[1:24:56] place I don't care what it looks like
[1:24:58] nothing is out of cater I'm closing on
[1:25:01] this so that you understand we're
[1:25:04] traveling with Pilgrims and strangers
[1:25:07] and you've heard me say this before if
[1:25:09] they're being a alien you the ones
[1:25:12] because you came from somewhere and
[1:25:15] you're going somewhere right and if I
[1:25:18] told you one day these lights gonna come
[1:25:20] down and pick you up that the world is
[1:25:25] calling flying saucers they don't have
[1:25:27] no idea what they are we know they are
[1:25:30] investigating angels they did it in
[1:25:34] large time and they doing it now
[1:25:36] now they seen things they ain't never
[1:25:39] seen before signs and wonders the Bobby
[1:25:42] said it would be so but what is it it's
[1:25:45] going home time that's what it is it's
[1:25:48] going home time you see well what about
[1:25:50] the world the world was the way the
[1:25:52] world is they didn't see it in Noah's
[1:25:55] day they don't see it today
[1:25:58] why because people have taken this word
[1:26:00] and they Dave hybrid they say oh god
[1:26:02] don't mean that you ain't got to do all
[1:26:04] of that
[1:26:04] that's too much see no no not for the
[1:26:08] bride of Jesus Christ not for the
[1:26:09] elected she want to do everything God
[1:26:12] wants her to do at whatever cost if you
[1:26:18] read this Bible they say you're gonna
[1:26:19] lose your mind I want to lose it
[1:26:21] I want his mind the Bible said let this
[1:26:26] mind be in you there was also
[1:26:28] Christ Jesus he said well what do you
[1:26:31] mean brother books I'm gonna tell you
[1:26:33] something when God that book is being
[1:26:37] scrolled it was one scroll folks that
[1:26:42] that unraveled not like this one scroll
[1:26:47] and I want you to understand that's the
[1:26:50] way God see it one verse created at all
[1:26:55] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:26:58] in the earth it created everything and
[1:27:02] he spoke
[1:27:03] let there be and exploded we don't know
[1:27:08] how long it took for it to react but
[1:27:11] everything that comes out of the mouth
[1:27:12] of God
[1:27:13] can never come back void you love the
[1:27:16] Lord let's stand let's have a word of
[1:27:28] Prayer please father we come before you
[1:27:30] Lord we thank you for your grace we
[1:27:32] thank you for your mercy and your love
[1:27:34] father we just pray that you would be
[1:27:36] merciful to us forgive us of our sins
[1:27:38] and our trespasses I trust Lord that in
[1:27:42] this lesson father we tried to give it
[1:27:46] the way you are giving it to us and if
[1:27:49] we done or said anything that wasn't
[1:27:52] correct I pray Lord God that you reveal
[1:27:55] it and reveal it to the people so they
[1:27:57] may understand that none of these things
[1:28:00] happen by chance everything has been pre
[1:28:03] planned by the foreknowledge of God and
[1:28:07] we thank you right now for everything we
[1:28:09] go through Lord that's why your Bible
[1:28:13] said think it not strange when you fall
[1:28:16] into divers temptations knowing that the
[1:28:19] trying of your faith is more precious
[1:28:22] than gold right now Lord we're in that
[1:28:25] time period of divers temptations Satan
[1:28:30] is moving but you told us not to think
[1:28:34] it's strange because we realize that
[1:28:37] we're being tried every child of God
[1:28:40] must be tried
[1:28:42] it's all right to be tried Lord by you
[1:28:46] because you've already told us through
[1:28:49] the word that we're more than conquerors
[1:28:50] and in our patience possess ye all souls
[1:28:56] Lord we thank you for tonight we thank
[1:28:59] you for your word we pray father that
[1:29:03] you continue to bless us be merciful to
[1:29:06] us Lord our desire is to be a hunt for
