[40:39] spirit the same God was seen of
[40:42] angels and the same God was preached
[40:45] unto the
[40:48] Gentiles amen it's the same God Amen you
[40:51] may be seated so this morning we have a
[40:54] little subject that we wanted to share
[40:56] with you
[40:59] that we entitled
[41:01] it uh God expressed himself in his son
[41:05] for his
[41:12] son amen God expressed himself in his
[41:18] son for his sons amen because if you
[41:22] read throughout the entire Bible you
[41:23] will understand
[41:25] that amen that every time that God talk
[41:28] to every time that God does something he
[41:30] does it as a
[41:34] son amen when he wanted to talk if he
[41:37] wants to talk to you he will use he will
[41:39] use a form of a
[41:43] son amen because the Bible says I
[41:46] believe uh somewhere it says that uh
[41:48] nobody has seen
[41:52] God Amen but we have seen the image of
[41:55] him which was Christ Jesus Christ am so
[41:58] here in the Bible here in John chapter
[42:00] one where we
[42:02] read amen he says that in the beginning
[42:05] was the word and the was and the Word
[42:07] was with God and the Word was
[42:11] God Amen in other tra translations of
[42:14] the
[42:15] Bible amen the Bible says that in the
[42:18] beginning was the
[42:21] logos and the logos was with
[42:24] God and the logos was God
[42:27] amen because the logos is the
[42:30] word amen the logos is the
[42:33] spirit amen the prophet says that it was
[42:36] that spirit that came out of
[42:40] God Amen that's what we call the
[42:43] logos and the Bible teaches us in first
[42:47] John Amen in 1 John Chapter 5 Verse 6 I
[42:51] believe amen it says that the spirit and
[42:53] the word are
[42:55] one amen so the logos which was the
[42:58] spirit of
[43:00] God Amen the prophet came after that and
[43:02] said that the logos was the attribute of
[43:05] the fullness of
[43:09] God Amen it was the word it was also the
[43:13] word amen because if we go back before
[43:16] the
[43:18] beginning amen before the time
[43:21] start amen before that the prophet said
[43:24] that God was a thought
[43:28] amen and being in that form of a
[43:31] thought amen he couldn't
[43:34] create because a thought cannot
[43:37] create amen a thought is there to
[43:41] plan Amen to think about what's supposed
[43:44] to
[43:45] happen but it cannot create amen the
[43:49] prophet compare it to uh an
[43:52] architect amen he says that before
[43:54] before before starting to build or to uh
[43:57] uh to do
[44:00] something amen it will have first to
[44:02] think about what is supposed to do what
[44:04] he wants to do amen before he builds a
[44:07] house amen he has to start he has to
[44:10] draw to start drawing that house Amen to
[44:13] see the representation of that house the
[44:16] Drone man he said that that was the same
[44:19] thing with with God before the
[44:22] beginning he was a thought Amen in that
[44:25] thought being that thought amen he was
[44:27] drawing The Plan of
[44:30] Redemption amen how everything was
[44:32] supposed to happen amen how the creation
[44:35] was supposed to happen amen how the
[44:38] world was supposed to be
[44:40] formed am but in that
[44:43] state amen he couldn't
[44:46] create so for him to
[44:48] create if we read in in Genesis chapter
[44:52] 1 I believe
[44:58] Genesis CH 1 verse
[45:00] one amen the Bible here says that in the
[45:03] beginning God created the Heaven and
[45:08] Earth and now if we go down and the
[45:10] Earth was without form and
[45:13] Bo and darkness was upon the face of the
[45:21] deep and now and the spirit of God moved
[45:24] upon the face of the waters
[45:29] amen the spirit of God moved upon the
[45:31] face of the
[45:33] waters am the spirit of God was filling
[45:36] out every empty
[45:40] spaces amen so God did not have a space
[45:43] to
[45:45] create so for him to start
[45:48] creating amen he had to condense
[45:52] himself Amen to condense himself in a
[45:55] form amen that form that we call the
[45:59] logos amen and then after that that he
[46:02] started to
[46:04] speak amen remember he was a
[46:07] thought amen and in that thought in that
[46:10] state he couldn't he couldn't
[46:13] create amen so to create he had to
[46:16] become a logos the
[46:19] logos amen that's why we say that the
[46:21] word I mean that's what the Bible says
[46:23] that and the word of God and the Word
[46:25] was with God
[46:28] amen because that Spirit of logos had to
[46:31] come out of
[46:33] God Amen to start
[46:36] creating amen the prophet came after
[46:38] that and said that the logos is the
[46:40] thought
[46:43] expressed amen because it's the word
[46:46] amen the word is the thought that's
[46:48] being
[46:49] expressed amen God had to think it
[46:53] first and then speak it so why you see
[46:57] in
[46:58] Genesis amen God saying that let there
[47:00] be
[47:01] light amen and the light was amen
[47:05] because he became the
[47:07] word am able to speak the
[47:11] creation and that thing will come to
[47:13] happen will come to
[47:14] pass amen he said that let there be
[47:17] light amen the prophet said that the
[47:20] light is the Vindication of the word of
[47:25] God is the Fulfillment of that word that
[47:28] came
[47:29] out amen so God was a
[47:32] thought without being
[47:35] expressed amen that was before the
[47:38] beginning amen that was before John got
[47:41] the revelation of the
[47:45] beginning amen that was before Genesis
[47:47] chapter
[47:49] one and when he started to
[47:51] create amen that's when time
[47:54] began amen that's when John started
[47:57] writing that in the beginning was the
[47:59] word amen when God transformed
[48:03] himself amen by becoming the
[48:06] word the prophet calls it
[48:09] amorphic meaning that it's the same
[48:12] God Amen changing mask amen so the
[48:16] prophet here
[48:17] says now in the beginning God dwelt
[48:22] Alone with his with his attributes
[48:27] as I spoke of this
[48:29] morning that's his
[48:32] thoughts there was
[48:34] nothing just God alone but he had
[48:38] thoughts just like a great architect can
[48:41] sit
[48:44] down in his mind and draw out what he
[48:47] thinks it's going to it's going
[48:51] to amen
[48:53] create he said now he cannot create
[48:58] he can take something that's been
[49:00] created and make it a different and make
[49:02] it in a different
[49:06] form because God is the only one that
[49:09] can
[49:10] create but he gets in his mind what he's
[49:14] going to
[49:17] do and that's his
[49:19] thoughts that's his
[49:21] desires now it's a
[49:24] thought and then he speaks it
[49:29] and it's a word
[49:30] then amen it first starts by being a
[49:34] thought amen you thought about the
[49:37] Redemption amen you thought about
[49:40] everything amen then when you started to
[49:43] create amen he started to speak that
[49:45] same
[49:47] word amen that's when he became that
[49:50] logos amen that's when he became that
[49:55] word amen
[49:57] amen so here if we go down in in in uh
[50:01] uh uh
[50:04] Genesis you will see that uh uh Abraham
[50:08] had to meet that same
[50:11] God Amen when Abraham met
[50:15] God when he
[50:18] met amen the prophet said that MC was
[50:21] the theop
[50:27] Amen in that form of being a theophonic
[50:30] he could never be
[50:33] hungry amen so the theop cannot
[50:37] eat so he could never be
[50:40] hungry a theopen he cannot
[50:45] sympathize because it's a it's a body
[50:47] that doesn't have
[50:49] feelings amen it's a body that cannot
[50:51] feel
[50:53] pain it's a body that cannot it's a body
[50:57] not like our
[50:59] body amen so for the plan of the
[51:01] Redemption to come to
[51:04] pass amen the prophet said that that
[51:07] that theop
[51:09] that amen had to become Jesus
[51:13] Christ amen in the body like you and
[51:16] mine Amen to be able to feel our
[51:20] pain to be able to to to sympathize with
[51:24] us
[51:26] able to be hungry to eat
[51:29] with to understand what we go
[51:33] through in order for him to go and die
[51:36] on the cross for
[51:38] us amen the body to he could not could
[51:41] not die on the cross
[51:43] for because that's an eternal
[51:47] body amen it's a body that cannot
[51:50] die amen remember in Hebrews chapter 7
[51:53] ver
[51:54] 13 amen the Bible says that for This
[51:58] MC king of Salem priest of the most high
[52:02] God who met Abraham returning from the
[52:05] slaughter of the
[52:08] Kings and blessed him to whom also
[52:12] Abraham gave a 10 a tenth part of
[52:17] all first being the interpretation king
[52:20] of
[52:22] righteousness and after that also king
[52:24] of Salem which is king of peace
[52:27] so now verse three amen
[52:32] that without father without mother
[52:36] without
[52:37] descent having neither beginning of
[52:41] days nor end of life but made lock unto
[52:46] the Son of
[52:49] God Amen abideth a priest continually
[52:57] amen did not have a father amen did not
[53:00] have a mother amen amen did not have a
[53:04] beginning it did not have an End Amen
[53:08] because when you have a father or a
[53:11] mother amen you have a beginning which
[53:14] means that we have to keep the record
[53:16] when you were
[53:19] born amen so that's why the prophet said
[53:22] that that M was not Jesus Christ
[53:28] amen because Jesus Christ had a
[53:31] beginning amen Jesus Christ had an end
[53:34] well we see how he he down on the cross
[53:37] that
[53:38] body amen but that was was did not have
[53:41] a
[53:43] beginning that did not have a
[53:46] n that did not have a father and that MC
[53:51] did not have a mother amen but the
[53:54] prophet said that the MC
[53:57] amen he became Jesus
[53:59] Christ amen I'm going to read it here in
[54:02] the message who was
[54:05] this it says now now the difference
[54:08] between him and
[54:10] you as a son it said that at the
[54:15] beginning the word and IM morph
[54:20] body he came in and lived in
[54:25] that and the person
[54:27] of then later we never heard no more of
[54:33] of
[54:35] because he became Jesus
[54:38] Christ am was the
[54:43] priest by he became Jesus
[54:46] Christ now you B you bypass
[54:50] that because in that
[54:52] formen he know all things he knew all
[54:55] things
[54:56] amen you have never been able to know
[54:59] that
[55:00] yet amen because the prophet said that
[55:02] when we were the the word God uh uh uh
[55:06] um uh if I can say the um I don't want
[55:09] to use the word Evolutions
[55:12] but amen the way Jesus the word god came
[55:15] to uh the way he does
[55:18] things amen he has he has steps that he
[55:22] has to resp to
[55:24] respect amen the first was the the
[55:27] body I'm sorry the first was the
[55:30] word which is the
[55:32] theophany amen then comes the
[55:35] body amen and then after that it's the
[55:38] glorified
[55:39] body amen so we coming to Earth
[55:43] here the prophet said that we had to
[55:46] jump our
[55:49] theophany we bypassed
[55:52] it that's the difference between us and
[55:55] Jesus
[55:56] amen Jesus was there amen and he knew
[56:01] everything amen but because being the
[56:04] theophany amen is the word is the body
[56:07] is the word
[56:08] body amen it's the body that knows
[56:11] everything amen he knows the beginning
[56:14] and the end amen so Jesus Christ amen
[56:18] being the word amen he knew
[56:21] everything amen that's why they said to
[56:24] uh uh the uh those Pharisees that before
[56:26] Abraham was I
[56:30] am amen because he was that
[56:33] Worden because he was the one that came
[56:36] to
[56:37] Abraham because he was the one that
[56:39] revealed himself to
[56:41] Moses amen he was the one who revealed
[56:44] himself to all the prophets of the Old
[56:46] Testament amen he was the same God Amen
[56:50] changing
[56:51] masks amen that's why now we get so
[56:54] confused
[56:57] amen people start believing in three
[57:00] Gods amen God the Father the Son and the
[57:03] spirit amen but it's the same God Amen
[57:07] the word and the
[57:09] spirit amen he was the spirit in the old
[57:12] test amen because seeing God was
[57:19] death amen seeing God was an instant
[57:23] death amen if he wasn't when he was on
[57:25] the mountain
[57:27] amen touching that mountain was an
[57:29] instant
[57:31] death amen when he was in Moses amen
[57:35] people couldn't people couldn't look at
[57:36] Moses face to
[57:38] face Moses had to Veil
[57:41] himself amen because he had the glory of
[57:44] the
[57:46] sh because before Christ amen he was
[57:49] impossible for the human
[57:52] being to be able to see God
[57:57] that's why when Moses requested God to
[57:59] see that's why when Moses requested to
[58:01] see
[58:03] God Amen Jesus did not see show him his
[58:07] face am but he had to turn his back amen
[58:11] so that Moses could see his
[58:13] back because it was impossible to see
[58:16] him face to
[58:17] face so that's why he had to become the
[58:22] son that's why he had to make he has to
[58:24] be made flesh
[58:28] to become
[58:29] flesh Amen to become Jesus Christ amen
[58:33] so that we can talk to
[58:35] him so that we can see him amen so that
[58:39] we can touch him amen because before
[58:42] that amen talking to him was
[58:46] impossible remember the children of
[58:48] Israel amen after want to tell Moses
[58:51] Moses we don't want to hear from you
[58:52] anymore we want to hear from God himself
[58:57] amen Moses brought them to the
[59:00] mountain am and God was speaking to
[59:04] them but they couldn't understand him
[59:07] amen because everything that they was
[59:10] hearing amen was Thunders amen they
[59:13] couldn't translate
[59:15] those amen so that's why God had to send
[59:18] a
[59:19] prophets Amen to be able to translate
[59:22] that word for us Amen to tell us what
[59:26] God is
[59:27] saying Amen to tell us the plan of
[59:30] God Amen that's why God that's why that
[59:33] was the plan of
[59:35] God Amen Amos
[59:37] 3 amen it said that God will reveal his
[59:40] word to the prophet
[59:44] first the prophet said that why is that
[59:48] so it says that because God is a
[59:51] spirit and the spirit and the word is
[59:55] one amen so the prophet has the spirit
[59:58] of God and since the prophet has the
[1:00:01] spirit of
[1:00:02] God Amen the word of God will have to
[1:00:05] come to the
[1:00:07] prophet amen and when the word of God
[1:00:09] comes to the
[1:00:11] prophet amen then the prophet will have
[1:00:14] to give that word to the
[1:00:17] people amen that's the same thing that
[1:00:19] happened to
[1:00:21] Abraham when the son of man came to
[1:00:23] Abraham
[1:00:25] [Music]
[1:00:26] amen the son of man did not go to
[1:00:29] lot amen because that would be against
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:33] word because the word has to come to the
[1:00:38] prophet Abraham was a
[1:00:41] prophet amen so the word has to come to
[1:00:44] him amen the word has to be revealed to
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:49] first before he goes and tell it to the
[1:00:52] people amen so that's why the son of man
[1:00:55] had to come to
[1:00:58] amen and it did not go to
[1:01:01] lot amen amen the prophet
[1:01:05] continue you come like
[1:01:08] Adam like me you become you you you
[1:01:12] became from the attribute of to the
[1:01:14] flesh you became from the attribute to
[1:01:16] the
[1:01:19] flesh to be
[1:01:22] tempted but when this life is finished
[1:01:25] here
[1:01:27] if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:01:32] dissolved we have one already
[1:01:35] waiting amen that's where we go amen
[1:01:39] that is the
[1:01:40] word then we can look back and see what
[1:01:44] we
[1:01:46] done now we don't understand
[1:01:49] it we have never become the
[1:01:53] word amen we've just become the flesh
[1:01:58] man not the word amen but clearly uh uh
[1:02:04] clearly makes it
[1:02:06] clear you will never be the
[1:02:10] word unless you was a thought in the
[1:02:16] beginning amen that proves the
[1:02:18] predestination of
[1:02:21] God you can't be the
[1:02:23] word unless you a
[1:02:27] amen you had to be in you had to be in
[1:02:31] the thinking
[1:02:33] first amen you had to be in the thinking
[1:02:37] first amen you had to be the thought
[1:02:40] first amen that's why God Amen when he
[1:02:44] was talking to
[1:02:45] job amen he was asking him job where
[1:02:48] were
[1:02:49] you amen when the Son of God was
[1:02:52] creating
[1:02:54] everything amen where were
[1:02:57] you amen you were in his mind amen
[1:03:01] because
[1:03:02] Redemption amen it's not something
[1:03:05] new Redemption it's not
[1:03:09] replacing amen but Redemption amen is to
[1:03:13] bring
[1:03:14] back what once
[1:03:16] was Amen to bring it
[1:03:19] back that's the same thing with
[1:03:22] Resurrection amen it's to bring back
[1:03:24] what what what what was
[1:03:27] first amen
[1:03:29] Redemption let's say for example I had
[1:03:31] this bottle of
[1:03:33] water amen and I lost it for some
[1:03:38] reason amen I lost this bottle of
[1:03:41] water amen and I took another one amen
[1:03:44] it's still a bottle of water amen and I
[1:03:47] take it and I say that this is the same
[1:03:51] thing no it's
[1:03:53] different this is not Redemption
[1:03:57] amen this is
[1:03:59] replacing amen
[1:04:01] Redemption amen is to find that was
[1:04:05] lost amen and to bring it
[1:04:08] back amen that is the
[1:04:10] Redemption amen so you were in the
[1:04:13] thought of God
[1:04:14] before amen you were in the thinking of
[1:04:17] God Amen and when you became
[1:04:20] flesh amen you amen you fa with
[1:04:23] Temptations and and sin
[1:04:26] amen you lost mean you you lost your
[1:04:29] your birth
[1:04:31] right amen the devil Satan now had a
[1:04:33] claim on
[1:04:35] you amen so God had to redeem you
[1:04:39] back amen he was not finding for another
[1:04:43] person he did not find another
[1:04:46] person amen he did not find another
[1:04:48] brother
[1:04:50] Joseph no he did not find another
[1:04:52] brother
[1:04:54] Isaac he did not someone
[1:04:56] else but he had to find that same
[1:05:00] person that was in his thought am to
[1:05:04] bring him
[1:05:05] back amen that is
[1:05:08] redemption amen that is Redemption for
[1:05:11] us amen and the only way to do
[1:05:14] that amen he had to become
[1:05:17] flesh amen that's what we say amen God
[1:05:21] had to express
[1:05:23] himself in his son
[1:05:26] for his sons amen he had to express
[1:05:30] himself Amen to become a
[1:05:32] son to become that word made
[1:05:35] flesh amen for you and me amen for his
[1:05:39] sons and his
[1:05:41] daughters amen that's the
[1:05:45] purpose amen become become the son of
[1:05:48] his own
[1:05:50] house may a high priest of his own house
[1:05:56] amen amen Hebrews chap 4:4
[1:06:01] 16 amen the Bible here
[1:06:05] says seeing then that we have a great
[1:06:08] high
[1:06:11] priest that is passed into the
[1:06:14] heavens Jesus the son of
[1:06:17] God let us hold fast our
[1:06:20] profession for we have not an high
[1:06:23] priest which cannot be touched with the
[1:06:25] feeling of our
[1:06:30] infirmity but was he no points temped
[1:06:32] like as we
[1:06:35] are yet without
[1:06:38] sin so now let us therefore come boldly
[1:06:41] onto the throne of
[1:06:45] grace amen that we may obtain mer obtain
[1:06:50] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:06:53] need
[1:06:57] amen and the only way to do that amen
[1:07:00] you had to become a
[1:07:02] son amen you had to be made
[1:07:06] flesh amen so he came by a he came by
[1:07:09] the
[1:07:10] woman amen but he was not of the
[1:07:15] woman amen that's where the Catholic
[1:07:17] people get
[1:07:19] confused amen they go pray Mary and say
[1:07:22] that Mary since is the mother of God
[1:07:27] is's the closest person to God to that's
[1:07:29] why they
[1:07:31] pray amen so that Mary can intercede for
[1:07:35] them amen but the word tells
[1:07:37] us amen God had to respect the
[1:07:43] biology so meaning that as a baby to
[1:07:45] come as a baby of
[1:07:49] Flesh amen God had to borrow a
[1:07:53] woman and a man
[1:07:56] Amen to pretend being the father of him
[1:07:59] of the
[1:08:02] parents amen but he was not of
[1:08:05] them amen because if you look at Jesus
[1:08:10] DNA you compare it to Mary or
[1:08:13] Joseph amen it's two different
[1:08:17] DNA amen it's two different
[1:08:20] things amen it's not even
[1:08:23] close amen amen amen that's why that's
[1:08:26] why the Bible call it it was a virgin
[1:08:30] birth amen amen there was the Bible said
[1:08:33] that uh uh uh Jesus was the child of the
[1:08:36] holy
[1:08:38] spirit amen a child of God
[1:08:41] himself amen I'm not going to go there
[1:08:43] in detail
[1:08:47] that amen so Mary was
[1:08:50] there amen she had a purpose amen Joseph
[1:08:54] had a purpose well
[1:08:56] Amen to raise the son
[1:08:58] Jesus amen but they weren't the true
[1:09:01] parents of
[1:09:02] Jesus Amen because remember when Jesus
[1:09:05] was
[1:09:06] lost amen Mary and and Joseph came to
[1:09:09] him and said that your father and me
[1:09:10] have been looking for you for
[1:09:15] days amen Jesus
[1:09:17] answered he said that don't you know
[1:09:19] that I have to take care of my father's
[1:09:25] amen if you read if you read the
[1:09:28] Bible amen we will know that the father
[1:09:30] when he said the father's
[1:09:32] business amen we try to say we say well
[1:09:35] it's
[1:09:37] Joseph amen there is no scripture in the
[1:09:39] Bible where it says that Joseph lift up
[1:09:41] the Bible and started
[1:09:47] preaching amen Joseph was a
[1:09:51] carpenter amen if Jesus meant Joseph by
[1:09:54] saying that he has to take care of his
[1:09:55] this
[1:09:58] business amen he was going to be found
[1:10:00] building houses and doors and
[1:10:04] windows amen because that is his
[1:10:06] father's
[1:10:08] business Amen to take care of what his
[1:10:10] father was
[1:10:12] doing amen but Jesus was found in the
[1:10:16] temple amen
[1:10:19] preaching amen sharing the
[1:10:22] word amen taking care of his father's
[1:10:27] am because his father is the
[1:10:29] word amen so he had to be in the
[1:10:31] business of his
[1:10:33] father amen doing the exact same
[1:10:37] thing amen so God wanted to be a
[1:10:41] father amen so the only way to become a
[1:10:45] father amen he had to become a
[1:10:48] sonen he had to become a
[1:10:51] son amen the same way to become a father
[1:10:56] he had to make himself a
[1:10:58] son the prophet said in the water
[1:11:05] baptism paragraph 146 and
[1:11:10] 147 now the
[1:11:12] father Son and Holy
[1:11:15] Ghost now after he dwelt in that pill of
[1:11:21] fire then came down and and then came
[1:11:24] down and made himself a
[1:11:28] body brought himself down a tent of
[1:11:31] human flesh and dwelt
[1:11:36] in and dwelt in Among
[1:11:39] Us God

[1:11:51] mystery of
[1:11:53] godliness for God was manifest In the
[1:11:57] Flesh yet Creator became
[1:12:03] savior Amen in the great song of of Boo
[1:12:08] clber in the great song of boo clber WR

[1:12:15] songwriter that the great Creator became
[1:12:17] my
[1:12:20] savior and all God's fullness
[1:12:27] dwelleth in
[1:12:28] him amen now
[1:12:31] notice father then he was the
[1:12:34] father way above us couldn't even get
[1:12:39] around where he was
[1:12:44] at then he became
[1:12:46] son that we could touch
[1:12:49] him feel
[1:12:52] him Prophet said that he was a man
[1:12:56] and then he gave his
[1:12:58] life amen that blood cell was broken by
[1:13:01] cruel sinful Roman
[1:13:06] spear when he pierced his
[1:13:10] heart broken heart killed
[1:13:15] him his water and blood
[1:13:19] separate grief broke the cell
[1:13:27] because of the sin of the human
[1:13:31] race amen the great
[1:13:34] Creator became my
[1:13:37] savior and all God's
[1:13:39] fullness dwell in
[1:13:43] him amen so what do we mean by all God's
[1:13:48] fullness amen let's go to uh
[1:13:53] Colossians chapter 1 verse 15-
[1:14:03] 19 Colossians chapter 1 verse
[1:14:10] 15-9 amen this is the supremacy of
[1:14:17] christacy amen amen the Bible here
[1:14:20] says who is the
[1:14:23] image who is the image of the invisible
[1:14:28] God the first born of his cre the first
[1:14:32] born of every
[1:14:35] creature for for by him were all things
[1:14:40] created that are in heaven and that are
[1:14:42] in
[1:14:44] Earth visible and
[1:14:46] invisible whether there be Thrones or
[1:14:48] dominions or principalities or
[1:14:51] Powers all things were created by Him
[1:14:54] and for him
[1:14:57] and he is before all
[1:15:00] things and by him all things
[1:15:04] consist and he is the head of the
[1:15:09] body the
[1:15:11] church amen who is the
[1:15:14] beginning the first born from the
[1:15:18] dead that in all
[1:15:21] things he might have preeminence
[1:15:26] now verse
[1:15:27] 19 for he pleased the
[1:15:30] father that in him all fullness that in
[1:15:34] him should all
[1:15:37] fullness
[1:15:39] dwell Amen in him all
[1:15:44] fullness
[1:15:45] dwell amen that dwell in Jesus
[1:15:49] Christ amen remember we
[1:15:52] said amen that the logos
[1:15:55] amen was the attribute of the fullness
[1:15:57] of
[1:15:59] God Amen so in the
[1:16:02] logos was
[1:16:04] everything amen he was it was the
[1:16:07] creator the Son of God Amen the
[1:16:11] Healer amen all the attributes of
[1:16:14] God Amen was in that
[1:16:17] logos amen and throughout the
[1:16:20] ages amen God had to reveal himself
[1:16:25] amen a portion of him little by
[1:16:28] little amen I believe in a message uh I
[1:16:31] forget uh where I
[1:16:33] read amen the prophet says that amen the
[1:16:37] logos being the fullness of
[1:16:39] God Amen that's why God that's why God
[1:16:43] could not pour everything into
[1:16:48] Moses amen because Moses was a
[1:16:51] prophet amen but he poured everything
[1:16:54] into to
[1:16:56] Christ all the
[1:16:58] fullness Amen dwelt in him what you say
[1:17:02] what brother ISAC what do you mean by
[1:17:04] that amen let's turn to Matthew chapter
[1:17:07] 16 verse
[1:17:11] 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse
[1:17:16] 16th so before we read
[1:17:19] that so we have to uh
[1:17:22] uh understand that
[1:17:26] that God had to come under three sons
[1:17:32] name amen he first came as a son of
[1:17:37] man then he came as a son of as a son of
[1:17:40] as a Son of God then he will come as a
[1:17:43] son of
[1:17:44] David amen so
[1:17:46] Jesus was the son of man amen he was a
[1:17:50] human being the son of man notice that
[1:17:54] Jesus never referred himself as a Son of
[1:17:59] God Amen but he always saying that he
[1:18:01] was the son of
[1:18:03] man amen but in him dwell all the
[1:18:07] fullness of
[1:18:09] God Amen so in him was the son of man
[1:18:14] was the son of God was the son of
[1:18:17] David even though when he came to the
[1:18:21] Earth amen he came to manifest the min
[1:18:25] of the son of
[1:18:27] man am but yet in the same
[1:18:30] time amen he was all of that am because
[1:18:34] in him was D in him dwell all the
[1:18:37] fullness of
[1:18:39] God Amen so Matthew 16 verse
[1:18:45] 16 Matthew 16:16
[1:18:49] Matthew so now God is talking to his
[1:18:53] disciples so let's go let's start to
[1:18:55] verse 13
[1:18:57] here Matthew
[1:19:01] 16:3 amen the Bible said that when Jesus
[1:19:03] came into the coast of cesaria
[1:19:08] pH he asked his disciples
[1:19:12] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:19:16] man
[1:19:18] am amen himself is telling them who do
[1:19:21] men say that I the son of man
[1:19:27] because when he came he came as a son of
[1:19:29] man the son of man being a
[1:19:34] prophet amen the son of man means a
[1:19:37] prophet amen verse
[1:19:39] 14 the disciple now starting to
[1:19:43] guess amen it said that and they said
[1:19:46] and they said some say that thou are
[1:19:49] John the
[1:19:52] Baptist some say that you are El lias
[1:19:56] either say that you are
[1:19:58] Jeremiah or one of the
[1:20:00] prophets amen they didn't have no
[1:20:04] Revelation amen they started guessing
[1:20:06] what Jesus
[1:20:08] was amen they they started saying what
[1:20:11] why they've been hearing people
[1:20:14] saying so now in verse
[1:20:17] 15 Jesus made it more
[1:20:21] personal he asked them he said that and
[1:20:23] and he said unto
[1:20:26] them but whom say ye that I
[1:20:31] am amen I know what other people are
[1:20:33] saying about
[1:20:35] me but what about you my
[1:20:39] disciples amen what do you say that I
[1:20:43] am so verse 16 here and Simon Peter
[1:20:48] answered and
[1:20:50] said thou are the
[1:20:53] Christ the son of the Living
[1:20:56] God Amen Peter did not repeat by saying
[1:21:00] that thou are the cross the son of
[1:21:06] man amen because Jesus came as a son of
[1:21:10] man so he would have made sense for
[1:21:13] Peter to say that you are the son of man
[1:21:16] he was going to be
[1:21:18] correct amen but he cut the
[1:21:22] Revelation he said that you are Christ
[1:21:26] the son of the Living
[1:21:28] God Amen and
[1:21:31] Jesus instead of rebuking
[1:21:34] Peter by saying that Peter this is not
[1:21:36] my
[1:21:38] Ministry this is not something that
[1:21:40] supposed to be now it's something that's
[1:21:42] supposed to come
[1:21:44] after but Jesus praised
[1:21:47] him he said that blessed are thou
[1:21:52] Simon for the Flesh and blood has not
[1:21:55] revealed it unto
[1:21:58] thee by my Father which is in
[1:22:01] heaven amen you have got that Revelation
[1:22:04] from my
[1:22:06] father amen because he came as the son
[1:22:08] of
[1:22:10] man amen but because Peter had that
[1:22:14] Revelation amen he called him Christ the
[1:22:16] son of the the son of the Living
[1:22:19] God Amen and we know here that Jesus is
[1:22:22] not rebuke him
[1:22:25] amen because Jesus is the
[1:22:27] word and every time the word was out of
[1:22:32] context Jesus never let it
[1:22:35] go it was always rebuking the
[1:22:39] error amen we see it with his with Mary
[1:22:43] and Mary and
[1:22:44] Joseph amen they came pretending being
[1:22:47] his
[1:22:48] father amen Jesus rebuked them and said
[1:22:51] that I have to take care of my father's
[1:22:53] J
[1:22:56] so if you read in Matthew chapter
[1:23:00] 15 verse 21 to uh uh to
[1:23:08] 20 amen here the Bible is talking about
[1:23:11] that woman who wanted her daughter to
[1:23:16] Beal amen then Jesus went then and
[1:23:19] departed into the C of of
[1:23:25] and behold a woman of Canon came out of
[1:23:28] of of the same coast and Cried unto him
[1:23:34] saying saying have mercy on me oh Lord
[1:23:39] thou son of
[1:23:40] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:23:43] with a
[1:23:47] devil so here this
[1:23:51] woman is calling Jesus Son of David
[1:23:56] and Peter called him Son of
[1:24:01] God God praised
[1:24:06] Peter because he caught that Revelation
[1:24:08] from God
[1:24:10] himself amen but this
[1:24:13] woman he's calling the son of man son of
[1:24:18] David and instead of Jesus praising him
[1:24:21] for the revelation
[1:24:26] AC but Jesus rebuked her
[1:24:30] instead amen why did Jesus rebuke
[1:24:33] her not because she was
[1:24:36] wrong amen because he was also the son
[1:24:39] of
[1:24:40] David amen but she was
[1:24:43] rebuked because that promise was not for
[1:24:47] her because the first coming of
[1:24:51] Jesus was not for the Gentiles
[1:24:55] amen it was for the Jews
[1:24:57] alone amen so she took something that
[1:24:59] did not belong to
[1:25:02] her and tried to apply it for her for
[1:25:06] herself and Jesus being the
[1:25:09] word he knew that something was
[1:25:12] wrong so straight ahead he rebuked
[1:25:15] her saying that I am not sined but unto
[1:25:18] the lordship of the House of Israel
[1:25:26] amen because Jesus was sent to the
[1:25:28] lordship of
[1:25:31] Israel amen not to the
[1:25:34] Gentiles amen but she came claiming
[1:25:36] Jesus being the son of the son of
[1:25:40] David amen verse
[1:25:42] 25 then came she and worshiped him
[1:25:45] saying Lord help
[1:25:50] me but he answered and
[1:25:52] said it is not meat to take the
[1:25:56] children's bread and cast it to
[1:26:01] dogs amen Jesus even compared her called
[1:26:04] her a
[1:26:06] dog amen but her faith was so
[1:26:09] strong amen she kept on
[1:26:13] going amen she kept on going amen she
[1:26:16] said
[1:26:18] truth Lord that's the
[1:26:20] truth yet the dogs
[1:26:24] of the crumbs which fall from the
[1:26:26] master's
[1:26:29] table amen now she's starting to know
[1:26:32] her
[1:26:34] place amen and then Jesus answered and
[1:26:36] said unto
[1:26:38] her oh woman great is thy
[1:26:42] faith be it unto thee even as thou will
[1:26:47] and her daughter was made
[1:26:51] whole from that very hour
[1:26:55] amen you see that Jesus had to rebuke
[1:26:58] her amen because she wasn't a
[1:27:01] Jew amen but she was taking something
[1:27:04] that didn't belong to
[1:27:06] her amen but if we go to Luke chapter
[1:27:13] 18 Luke chapter 18
[1:27:16] L uh verse
[1:27:22] 35-42 verse 45 to3 42 uh 35-
[1:27:28] 42 Luke
[1:27:32] 18
[1:27:35] 35-32 amen where we read in uh uh
[1:27:38] Matthew
[1:27:40] 15 a woman calling Jesus Son of
[1:27:45] David and Jesus rebuked her and now here
[1:27:49] you see the blind
[1:27:52] B amen the Bible says here and it came
[1:27:55] to pass that as he was Come N unto
[1:28:01] Jericho a certain blonde man Sat by the
[1:28:05] way side
[1:28:08] begging and here on the multitude passed
[1:28:11] by he asked what he
[1:28:15] meant and they told him that Jesus of
[1:28:18] Nazareth passed
[1:28:21] by and cried and he cried saying
[1:28:26] Jesus thou son of
[1:28:28] David have mercy on
[1:28:31] me amen it's the same you know calling
[1:28:34] Jesus the same
[1:28:36] thing amen the woman called him son of
[1:28:40] David she was
[1:28:43] rebuked but here the blind
[1:28:46] Bim calling him son of
[1:28:50] David amen but God healed him instead
[1:28:55] amen because she was from the he was
[1:28:58] from the house of
[1:29:00] Israel amen God came to
[1:29:04] them amen God came to manifest himself
[1:29:07] to
[1:29:09] them amen so even though he called him
[1:29:11] son of
[1:29:13] David amen he wasn't wrong amen because
[1:29:17] in him IM dwell all the fullness of God
[1:29:22] IM dwell all the fullness
[1:29:25] amen Peter had the Revelation that he
[1:29:27] was the son of
[1:29:29] God Jesus said amen to it amen because
[1:29:33] in him amen he had that
[1:29:36] logos amen that was also a Son of
[1:29:40] God amen amen amen the blind
[1:29:43] barus called him the son of
[1:29:45] David amen remember the son of Jesus
[1:29:48] will come as the son of
[1:29:51] David Jesus will come as the son of
[1:29:53] David
[1:29:55] Amen to
[1:29:57] Reign Amen to be on his throne to
[1:30:00] Reign amen so when he came in his first
[1:30:04] coming he came as a son of
[1:30:07] man amen as a
[1:30:10] prophet amen he did not come as a Son of
[1:30:14] God because a Son of God is a
[1:30:17] spirit amen a Son of God is a
[1:30:21] spirit amen that's what in Genesis I
[1:30:23] believe chap
[1:30:26] chapter two I believe when God said that
[1:30:29] let us make men in our
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:33] image amen you will understand the first
[1:30:35] man that was
[1:30:38] made it wasn't the physical
[1:30:41] man amen it was man's
[1:30:44] spirit amen because the image of God is
[1:30:46] a
[1:30:49] spirit amen so him being the son of God
[1:30:54] he's a spirit amen it's that
[1:30:57] logos amen it's that pill of
[1:31:00] fire amen it's that holy
[1:31:02] spirit amen that is the Son of God Amen
[1:31:07] that's what Jesus
[1:31:08] said amen I have to go
[1:31:11] up amen I have to die
[1:31:14] first amen and go up am so that God can
[1:31:19] send the Son of
[1:31:21] God Amen so that the ministry of the son
[1:31:23] of God becomes available to
[1:31:27] you because they couldn't dwell both of
[1:31:29] them couldn't be at the same
[1:31:32] place because it was the same
[1:31:35] person so one had to give away to
[1:31:40] another amen that's God being a
[1:31:44] Morphin amen changing mask amen a son of
[1:31:48] man amen is a man a human
[1:31:51] being amen that you can touch
[1:31:54] that you can talk to amen he will be
[1:31:58] hungry amen he will eat amen he will
[1:32:02] sleep amen he is a human being amen a

[1:33:35] son amen the logos the prophet called it
[1:33:39] the Son of
[1:33:40] God Amen it was a shape that God
[1:33:43] took Amen to lead the children of
[1:33:46] Israel amen he was that Pillar of
[1:33:49] Fire amen he was that
[1:33:52] cloud amen he was that logos that
[1:33:55] revealed himself to the
[1:33:57] prophet amen he was that
[1:34:00] son amen so that is God Amen that is his
[1:34:05] purpose Amen in
[1:34:08] closing amen I had a lot to
[1:34:11] say Amen but uh because of time we going
[1:34:16] to jump and try to
[1:34:34] Amen in closing
[1:34:36] on Amen we read the the prophet here
[1:34:39] looking for that
[1:34:41] U scripture
[1:34:56] all right I'm I'm in closing I'm want to
[1:34:57] read the prophet
[1:35:00] here and the message the true Easter
[1:35:06] seal paragraph 261 I mean
[1:35:13] 206 amen um let's see
[1:35:17] here if we read this we're going to jump
[1:35:19] into something
[1:35:22] else I won't I won't be I won't be able
[1:35:25] to close five
[1:35:28] minutes amen let's read uh question and
[1:35:30] answers questions and answers
[1:35:35] chapter amen paragraph
[1:35:38] 209 and
[1:35:42] 101 amen here is somebody asking the
[1:35:46] question amen is asking brother Bram a
[1:35:51] question it says some say brother Bram
[1:35:53] is the son of Go is is the son of
[1:35:58] man and I thought the pill of fire was
[1:36:01] the son of
[1:36:03] man am I
[1:36:07] mistaken amen so here's the answer
[1:36:09] brother
[1:36:13] brand amen he said that
[1:36:15] well that's a good
[1:36:18] question very
[1:36:20] good but I am not I'm not the son of
[1:36:25] man but a son of
[1:36:28] men there is quite a difference Jesus
[1:36:32] Christ was the son of
[1:36:34] man the Son of God the son of man the
[1:36:40] son of
[1:36:41] David amen but I am a son of
[1:36:45] man amen
[1:36:47] because amen as we say it the first
[1:36:51] coming of the son of man
[1:36:54] amen was for the house the lost sheep of
[1:36:59] Israel amen that's why God had to rebuke
[1:37:02] that woman when she called him the son
[1:37:04] of
[1:37:07] David amen so God did not want the
[1:37:10] Gentiles just to go like that without
[1:37:13] experiencing the same
[1:37:19] thing amen so that's why he promised
[1:37:23] amen that the same thing that happened
[1:37:26] that he
[1:37:27] did amen that he would do it
[1:37:30] again Amen in uh uh Luke Chapter
[1:37:37] 177e let's see where is it Luke chapter
[1:37:40] 17
[1:37:55] all right Luke chapter 17 here uh verse
[1:37:59] 30
[1:38:03] Luke all right let's start with verse
[1:38:08] 28 amen hear the Bible
[1:38:10] saying likewise
[1:38:14] also as it was in the days of
[1:38:18] lot they did
[1:38:20] eat they drank they bought they sold
[1:38:26] they planted they build
[1:38:28] it but the same day that lot went out of
[1:38:33] Sodom he ran fire and a brimstone from
[1:38:37] heaven and destroyed them
[1:38:40] all even
[1:38:43] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:38:47] of men is
[1:38:51] revealed amen even thus shall it be in
[1:38:54] the days where the son of man shall be
[1:38:57] revealed in that
[1:38:59] day he which shall be upon the
[1:39:05] Housetop and his staff in the
[1:39:08] house let him not come down to take to
[1:39:11] take it
[1:39:12] away and he that is in the
[1:39:15] field let him likewise not return
[1:39:19] back amen even thus shall it be in the
[1:39:23] day when the son of man is
[1:39:27] revealed amen so here this promise or
[1:39:32] this word that Jesus was
[1:39:35] saying amen it was not really for him
[1:39:38] Jesus Christ being their present the son
[1:39:41] of
[1:39:45] man amen it was for another Ministry of
[1:39:48] the son of man that was supposed
[1:39:52] to and when that Ministry of the son of
[1:39:55] man will be
[1:39:58] revealed amen then we will know that the
[1:40:00] end is
[1:40:03] near amen it's that Ministry had to be
[1:40:06] revealed
[1:40:09] again amen the ministry of the son of
[1:40:12] man amen that's why when when when uh uh
[1:40:15] that person asked brother
[1:40:19] Bram asking brother bam if he was the
[1:40:21] son of man
[1:40:24] Amen brother bam had to correct him and
[1:40:27] say that I am I'm not the son of
[1:40:31] men but I am a son of
[1:40:33] man amen with the ministry of a son of
[1:40:37] man to reveal the son of
[1:40:41] man amen to reveal the son of
[1:40:44] man meaning that to do the exact same
[1:40:47] thing that Jesus
[1:40:50] did amen what is the ministry of the son
[1:40:53] of
[1:40:54] man amen when the son of man went to
[1:40:58] Abraham amen he did three
[1:41:01] things amen the first
[1:41:03] thing amen he gave the word he revealed
[1:41:06] the word
[1:41:08] to he revealed the revealed uh uh the uh
[1:41:11] he discerned was
[1:41:14] discern amen he knew what Sarah was
[1:41:18] thinking amen the second
[1:41:21] thing amen he revealed the
[1:41:24] word amen and the third thing he had
[1:41:29] communion amen those are the three
[1:41:31] things he
[1:41:32] did amen he revealed the
[1:41:34] word saying that shall I hide to Abraham
[1:41:37] what I'm about to
[1:41:39] do amen that he revealed Abraham what he
[1:41:42] was supposed to
[1:41:44] do amen the second time when that
[1:41:47] Ministry came again on
[1:41:49] Earth amen Jesus Christ himself being
[1:41:52] the son of man
[1:41:55] amen he did all those three things
[1:41:58] again amen he revealed the heart he
[1:42:00] revealed the
[1:42:02] thoughts amen of that woman at the
[1:42:05] well amen he told her of all the of the
[1:42:08] husbands he
[1:42:11] had amen he revealed the
[1:42:14] word amen and he had communion as the
[1:42:16] Las thing with his
[1:42:19] disciples amen so according to this amen
[1:42:23] that Ministry had to come
[1:42:26] again amen it had to be revealed
[1:42:29] again and that ministry will have to do
[1:42:32] that three things
[1:42:34] again amen what was it amen to reveal
[1:42:38] the
[1:42:39] thoughts amen that's why you will see
[1:42:41] sometimes when bram's
[1:42:43] Ministry amen he had to turn his back to
[1:42:46] the people amen and discern the thoughts
[1:42:49] of
[1:42:50] people amen and say sister you there you
[1:42:55] going through this and that and this
[1:42:57] amen it was that Ministry that he was
[1:43:01] revealing amen the second thing amen was
[1:43:05] to reveal the
[1:43:07] word amen we have the Seven
[1:43:10] Seals amen the seventh seal was a
[1:43:13] secret amen but now it is revealed to
[1:43:17] us amen the third thing amen it was a
[1:43:21] communion amen that was the last message
[1:43:24] of brother
[1:43:25] brand was communion that was the
[1:43:29] ministry of the son of
[1:43:31] man amen repeating every
[1:43:35] time amen I said I didn't want to go
[1:43:37] through
[1:43:40] this amen it was the same
[1:43:43] Ministry amen repeating
[1:43:45] itself amen because we understand amen
[1:43:49] that brother bam had actually two
[1:43:51] Ministry that two purpose that had to
[1:43:55] accomplish one of Malachi
[1:43:58] 4 and the other one of the of revealing
[1:44:01] the son of
[1:44:02] man amen it's two different
[1:44:04] things amen Malachi for being
[1:44:08] Elijah amen his
[1:44:10] ministry was the ministry of
[1:44:14] restoration amen he had to
[1:44:17] restore amen that's why you see brother
[1:44:19] bam preaching about marriage and divorce
[1:44:23] amen that was the ministry of
[1:44:26] Elijah that was the ministry of Malachi
[1:44:29] 4 amen that's why you see brother Ram
[1:44:31] preaching about the baptism in the name
[1:44:34] of Jesus
[1:44:35] Christ amen that was the ministry of
[1:44:39] restoration amen that's why you see
[1:44:41] brother Ram preaching about the serpent
[1:44:45] seed Amen brother Ram teaching on
[1:44:49] Grace Amen brother Bram teaching on
[1:44:51] justification sanctification
[1:44:53] BM of the Holy
[1:44:56] ghosten telling us that there are no
[1:44:59] women
[1:45:01] angels and no women
[1:45:04] preachers amen telling us that
[1:45:07] the the difference between Eternal uh uh
[1:45:10] uh that there is no eternal
[1:45:15] hell amen preaching about predestination
[1:45:18] election and and free moral
[1:45:24] amen that was the ministry of Malachi
[1:45:27] 4 amen that Ministry amen had to make
[1:45:32] way a
[1:45:33] way amen for the ministry of the son of
[1:45:37] man amen so that the son of man being
[1:45:40] being
[1:45:41] revealed he had to clear that
[1:45:46] first put everything in
[1:45:49] order telling us that he is not God
[1:45:54] amen telling us that brother Bram is not
[1:45:56] God that he is only a
[1:45:59] prophet amen that has a purpose that he
[1:46:02] has to
[1:46:03] fulfill amen he was re was rebuilding
[1:46:06] the
[1:46:07] altar he came down and showed
[1:46:10] us that the only name of worship is the
[1:46:13] the Lord Jesus
[1:46:15] Christ that only with the name of Jesus
[1:46:18] Christ that we are
[1:46:20] saved that only with the name of Jesus
[1:46:23] CHR we receive the Forgiveness of our
[1:46:25] sinsen he had to make clear that
[1:46:28] everything is being understood
[1:46:30] first amen before manifesting the other
[1:46:35] Ministry before because if he did not
[1:46:37] restore
[1:46:38] it he was going to create a big
[1:46:43] confusion people were still worshiping
[1:46:46] brother
[1:46:48] brand people will start calling him God
[1:46:53] in order to avoid all those
[1:46:56] confusions he had to rebuild the altar
[1:47:00] first amen showing that Jesus
[1:47:03] Christ amen he's the only one who's
[1:47:05] supposed to be
[1:47:07] worship he's The Only Name That's
[1:47:09] supposed to be lifted
[1:47:11] up amen showing amen that there is no
[1:47:16] comparation you cannot
[1:47:20] compare brother br
[1:47:23] and Jesus Christ amen even though their
[1:47:26] Ministry might be so
[1:47:29] similar yet you can never compare the
[1:47:33] two because Jesus
[1:47:36] Christ was a virgin
[1:47:38] born amen he never
[1:47:41] sinned he never
[1:47:43] lied never made
[1:47:46] mistakes never was
[1:47:48] confused never came back and corrected
[1:47:51] himself
[1:47:53] amen he was different amen he was God
[1:47:57] himself amen people worshiped
[1:48:00] himen people knelled before
[1:48:03] him people worshiped him amen but when
[1:48:07] he came to brother
[1:48:08] Brandon amen he was a human being as you
[1:48:11] and
[1:48:12] me amen he had his
[1:48:15] struggles amen he had his own personal
[1:48:18] things that he had to go
[1:48:20] through he had his own mistakes that he
[1:48:22] had
[1:48:25] amen he came
[1:48:26] down amen amen had to do that the
[1:48:29] ministry of Malachi
[1:48:32] 4 Amen to make sure there's a difference
[1:48:36] between them
[1:48:37] two amen that can never be
[1:48:41] compared amen not under any
[1:48:44] circumstances amen not under any
[1:48:47] situation amen you can't place them in
[1:48:49] the same level
[1:48:53] amen amen because brother bam had that
[1:48:56] Ministry amen let's go ahead and read
[1:48:58] that quote that we wanted to read
[1:49:02] first if I can find it here in the true
[1:49:06] Easter
[1:49:07] SE paragraph
[1:49:10] 206 amen here the prophet
[1:49:12] says now you just see if he is still the
[1:49:15] same if he is still the high priest that
[1:49:17] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:49:19] infirmities
[1:49:24] now this is Brother
[1:49:26] Bram talking to to
[1:49:30] someone amen revealing that Ministry of
[1:49:33] the son of
[1:49:35] man he said that I never seen you in my
[1:49:39] life you're a stranger to
[1:49:42] me I know nothing about
[1:49:45] you but God knows God does know you amen
[1:49:50] you see he had to make that difference
[1:49:53] that him brother
[1:49:55] Bram had no idea of who that person
[1:49:59] was amen but God who knows
[1:50:03] everything amen knew exactly who that
[1:50:05] person
[1:50:07] was and now he continue he said if he
[1:50:12] God can reveal to
[1:50:15] me by his holy
[1:50:18] spirit the resurrected Christ
[1:50:23] who come here and give me a temporary
[1:50:28] Resurrection by my
[1:50:32] spirit that my spirit goes away
[1:50:36] now and his Spirit comes
[1:50:39] in then to let you know whether he is
[1:50:42] alive or
[1:50:46] not now I don't know
[1:50:48] you that's me I don't know you me and my
[1:50:53] spirit amen we don't know you amen amen
[1:50:57] but he knows
[1:51:00] you so now here here he's saying
[1:51:03] that but he God wants to borrow my
[1:51:09] body Amen to prove that he is the
[1:51:12] resurrected
[1:51:15] Christ amen and I'm so
[1:51:17] happy to loan it to
[1:51:21] him give to
[1:51:23] him anything he can get out of
[1:51:27] it before brother Bram say this amen he
[1:51:32] had to make
[1:51:33] sure amen that him himself being the
[1:51:36] person
[1:51:38] brand the son of Charles
[1:51:41] brand had no idea of the person that was
[1:51:44] in front of
[1:51:46] him he specifically
[1:51:48] said that me and my spirit
[1:51:52] amen we have no idea of who you
[1:51:56] are amen but God wants to borrow my
[1:52:00] body amen he wants to come
[1:52:03] in amen he wants to express that
[1:52:07] Ministry of the son of man amen so in
[1:52:11] order for him to do that and the only
[1:52:14] way for him to do
[1:52:15] that I have to borrow him my
[1:52:18] body meaning that I have to let my
[1:52:21] spirit go
[1:52:23] Amen to let him come
[1:52:25] in Amen to perform that
[1:52:28] Ministry amen because him know he knows
[1:52:31] who you
[1:52:32] are am he knows exactly who you
[1:52:36] are amen so by reading this people
[1:52:39] reading this now they get all
[1:52:42] confused amen they started making
[1:52:45] brother brand of
[1:52:46] God Amen making him who is
[1:52:49] not amen by him him being CLE
[1:52:53] here saying that I don't know
[1:52:56] you amen me and my
[1:52:59] spirit we don't know
[1:53:01] you that's me me and my
[1:53:05] spirit we don't know you but he knows
[1:53:09] you but he wants to borrow my
[1:53:13] body he wants to borrow this
[1:53:16] body Amen to prove that he is the
[1:53:19] resurrected Christ
[1:53:22] and I'm so happy to learn
[1:53:27] it amen if you read other other
[1:53:31] quotes amen you will see brother
[1:53:33] brandham
[1:53:34] saying amen he said that the logos came
[1:53:37] down amen it's in his
[1:53:40] church he said that the deity is now in
[1:53:43] in is now in
[1:53:47] men amen because of that
[1:53:50] Spirit when it comes in you
[1:53:53] amen he makes you a
[1:53:55] deity amen you become
[1:53:58] God Amen you become God Amen because God
[1:54:02] cannot speak unless he uses your
[1:54:06] mouth amen God cannot touch unless he
[1:54:09] uses your
[1:54:10] hand amen you become God Amen it's like
[1:54:14] Moses amen God told Moses that you will
[1:54:18] be God for for
[1:54:21] Aaron amen Aaron will be your
[1:54:24] prophet and you will be God Amen because

[1:54:29] mouth amen that did not make Moses
[1:54:33] God Amen Moses did not become the object
[1:54:36] of of of
[1:54:38] worship he was just something that God
[1:54:42] used to deliver a message to his
[1:54:46] people amen that did not change Moses to
[1:54:48] make him
[1:54:50] God Amen it with brother
[1:54:53] Branden God used his
[1:54:56] mouth Amen in other quotes if you read
[1:54:58] it you will see God himself talking and
[1:55:01] said that this is me God
[1:55:04] talking amen but still that doesn't make
[1:55:06] brother brandham
[1:55:08] God Amen it doesn't give you the
[1:55:11] opportunity to go
[1:55:14] worship amen because the only name that
[1:55:17] you can
[1:55:18] worship amen it's the name of the Lord
[1:55:20] Jesus chist amen The Only Name that can
[1:55:23] save
[1:55:24] you is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:27] amen The Only Name that can heal

[1:55:32] Christ amen The Only Name that can give
[1:55:34] you the
[1:55:36] RT amen it's the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:38] Christ amen The Only Name that can save
[1:55:41] your
[1:55:42] family it's the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:44] Christ amen it's not the name of Paul
[1:55:48] amen it's not the name of Moses it's not
[1:55:51] the name of br
[1:55:53] it's not the name of Elijah amen but it
[1:55:56] is the name of Jesus Christ himself amen
[1:55:59] because it's that name amen every knee
[1:56:02] shall bow amen every tongue shall
[1:56:05] confess amen that he is God Amen he is
[1:56:09] God Amen the name that's above all other
[1:56:13] name amen the devil hears that name and
[1:56:15] he
[1:56:16] Tres amen demons heal that name and they
[1:56:19] ran
[1:56:20] away it's with name of Jesus Amen so we
[1:56:24] are supposed to lift him
[1:56:26] up we supposed to praise Him amen we
[1:56:30] supposed to thank him am we supposed to
