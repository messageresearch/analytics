[0:00] amen we're going to ask that you uh turn
[0:02] with us to two passages of scripture
[0:05] we're going to be coming from first
[0:07] John amen the third chapter beginning at
[0:10] the ninth
[0:24] verse amen and from there we'll go to St
[0:28] John 6 and 37
[0:32] for this is the message that ye have
[0:35] heard from the beginning oh no um ninth
[0:37] verse whosoever is born of God does not
[0:41] commit
[0:42] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[0:47] cannot sin because he is born of God now
[0:51] we never would have known that without a
[0:52] messenger he said we cannot
[0:55] disbelieve in this the children of God
[0:58] are manifest and the children of the
[1:01] devil whosoever doeth not righteousness
[1:04] is not of God neither he that loveth not
[1:07] his brother but this is the message that
[1:09] ye heard from the beginning that we
[1:11] should love one another now look at look
[1:16] where he takes us not as Cain who was of
[1:19] the wicked one and slew his brother
[1:22] wherefore slew he him because his own
[1:25] Works were evil and his brothers
[1:28] righteous and amen amen St
[1:32] John
[1:38] 6:37 you know I
[1:41] Marvel you know I uh I was back there
[1:44] you know just on the verge
[1:48] of just sharing shedding
[1:52] tears uh because I realize how
[1:55] important these messages that uh God has
[1:59] allowed me to minister
[2:01] is uh um how important they are and I
[2:05] realize that uh it it's still uh seem to
[2:11] be going over the people's head but you
[2:14] know what you can't be nothing that you
[2:17] ain't and uh uh you know I know some who
[2:20] are not here because of legit reasons
[2:22] but there are those amen who are not
[2:24] here because they just absolutely
[2:28] tired amen listen St John
[2:31] 6:37 for all that the father giveth me
[2:35] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[2:39] me I will in no wise cast
[2:43] out amen you like that one amen let us
[2:47] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[2:49] you we thank you for your grace and your
[2:52] mercy Lord and we pray father that you
[2:55] would just move and just continue to
[2:57] break and destroy the yolks of the enemy
[2:59] unveil the devil lord that's in our
[3:01] lives that we might see him clearly Lord
[3:05] God bless us right now and we'll be
[3:08] careful to give you the praise Glory and
[3:10] Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[3:13] amen de love God you may be seated still
[3:16] on completion I don't know which part it
[3:18] is brother third or fourth but I trust
[3:20] by the grace of God um you know I want
[3:23] to send this uh uh message um to um
[3:27] brother Barnes and by the grace of God I
[3:29] know brother um Troy's probably
[3:31] overwhelmed he's supposed to be showing
[3:33] me how to download all that stuff so as
[3:35] soon as we get it done we can get her
[3:37] done amen but you know I I look at this
[3:41] and I'm surprised because you know I've
[3:43] had people calling me from all different
[3:45] places of the United States and you know
[3:48] they missed the sermon cloud and want to
[3:50] hear and I didn't even know people were
[3:51] listening even my pastor my old Pastor
[3:54] from South Carolina Brother Anderson
[3:56] said the people have just been wanting
[3:57] to hear you brother Brooks and they um
[4:00] I I I he said I I'm calling to see
[4:02] whether we can find a way of listening
[4:05] amen so um people of God I don't know
[4:07] what all God is doing but I do know one
[4:10] thing you know like the word of God said
[4:12] a prophet is without honor in his own
[4:14] country it seem to people that people
[4:16] everywhere seem to enjoy the messages
[4:19] more so than what we do at home not
[4:21] that's not for everybody here but you
[4:23] know what I'm saying for as a whole I
[4:25] think people out there can hear it and
[4:27] understand it better than some of us in
[4:30] this place but that's the way it was at
[4:32] Bram Tabernacle it it is what it is but
[4:35] I want you to understand by the grace of
[4:37] God this is not brother Brook sitting
[4:39] down trying to contemplate on what he's
[4:41] going to minister I believe with all my
[4:43] heart that the sermons or the messages
[4:45] have been Vindicated by Brothers amen
[4:48] that this is what God would have for us
[4:50] in this last day now uh we we still
[4:53] dealing with completion but one of the
[4:55] things I heard that the prophet of God
[4:57] said this morning he said you know this
[5:00] using that scripture he was praying he
[5:03] says father I thank you because you said
[5:06] If any man cometh into me I will no wise
[5:09] cast him out so we realize by the grace
[5:12] of God that you hooked and understand
[5:16] amen this is an unconditional Covenant
[5:20] so get your mind off of your failures
[5:23] and look at his victories and I believe
[5:25] by looking at his victories you'll
[5:28] become Victorious amen so when we look
[5:31] at these things you and I must
[5:33] understand amen as I said it is all
[5:36] about the seed that's why I I read the
[5:39] scripture if if the seed be in you
[5:42] because the word of God said this is
[5:44] what determines whether you be of God or
[5:46] whether you be of the devil it's
[5:48] absolutely the seed in you right and in
[5:52] that message in uh uh why people tossed
[5:56] about excuse me I even listen and he he
[5:59] goes on and says oh whenever you say I
[6:03] you know I've got to do better I've got
[6:04] to quit this I've got to quit that he
[6:06] said you're still in the outer Court he
[6:09] said you're not in the holies of holies
[6:11] yet because in the holies of holies God
[6:14] takes it all away from you and you
[6:16] become dead to yourself now he didn't
[6:19] say it wasn't a good place to be he was
[6:21] just basically trying to tell us is not
[6:24] the end result it's not where our
[6:26] destiny our destiny is to be placed the
[6:29] Shina of glory amen between the cherubim
[6:33] or the wings of the cherubims to live an
[6:35] eternal life as I said on Wednesday we
[6:39] have been smitten out of or heed out of
[6:42] the seven Church age and we are now in
[6:44] what we call the Eternal age some people
[6:47] say the eighth age but brother Brandon
[6:49] called it the Eternal age meaning that
[6:52] you pass from death into life and you
[6:54] can't die no more amen ain't God good to
[6:57] us amen so we realize by the grace of
[7:00] God we showed you this morning how that
[7:03] we have our battles but there was a one
[7:06] thing I wanted to bring out where where
[7:08] I read in Romans 7:24 Wretched Man that
[7:10] I am who shall deliver me from this body
[7:13] of death in other words the power of
[7:15] death and here in question and answers I
[7:18] I want you to listen closely here the
[7:20] prophet of God says now as long as the
[7:22] six senses agree with the faith
[7:25] wonderful but when the six senses
[7:28] disagree with Faith then leave the six
[7:31] senses alone amen now for instance here
[7:35] Jesus made a statement a promise the
[7:38] inside man says that's true the outside
[7:41] man reason that it can't be true to you
[7:44] then ignore the outside man and accept
[7:47] the Inside Man now that's the same thing
[7:50] that Paul's speaking of he was sold
[7:52] under the law to conal sin and every one
[7:56] of us is the same that's the reason we
[7:58] have trouble with do of marrying four or
[8:01] five times and this and that and all
[8:03] kinds of sin adulteries and everything
[8:05] else along in our lives is because of
[8:08] those things we are carnal and that part
[8:12] must perish amen amen hello but then
[8:17] inside we are a spiritual man Soul
[8:21] inside and that faith in God's word then
[8:25] we bring out excuse me then we bring our
[8:29] ourside our excuse me we bring our
[8:33] outside body under subjection to the
[8:36] word by Faith by accepting what God Said
[8:40] how can I take a cabur and make a grain
[8:43] of wheat out of it is impossible for me
[8:46] to do it hello Amen in other words if
[8:49] you're not born again it's impossible to
[8:51] live holy am the only way it can be is
[8:55] because inside the cabur has been
[8:58] transmitted it from a cck wheat a cabur
[9:02] to a germ called wheat life you
[9:05] understand that then you Barry that
[9:08] cockabur and it'll produce a grain of
[9:11] wheat because there has been a life of
[9:13] wheat put in the
[9:15] cockabur and all of us were
[9:18] cockaburs right and the life of the
[9:20] cockabur has been taken out but the
[9:23] nature of the cockabur is sticky and
[9:26] that's your
[9:28] flesh right
[9:29] see and it will be until this new life
[9:33] has fully been developed out of the
[9:36] ground and raised up again amen when it
[9:39] comes forth then it's no matter no more
[9:42] cabur but wheat but while it's here on
[9:47] Earth uh out of the Earth the cabar is
[9:50] still sticky but it's got the nature of
[9:53] the inside of it of wheat that's why you
[9:56] have problems your outside nature which
[9:59] is your flesh is a cuar but your inside
[10:03] nature amen is wheat so the cabar and
[10:06] the wheat fight all the
[10:09] time it Wars against the Bible said the
[10:12] spirit Wars against the flesh amen and
[10:15] as long he is basically telling us until
[10:17] we get rid of the outside which comes by
[10:20] way of a complete Rapture you going to
[10:23] always have a stickiness to you yes
[10:26] sir Hallelujah come on somebody and as
[10:29] long as you are in this life you're
[10:31] going to be sticky and have a caral
[10:34] nature that's going to bother you as
[10:36] long as you live amen but the inside of
[10:39] you wo you're born again Hallelujah and
[10:44] when you're raised up you're in the
[10:45] likeness of Christ and all the sin is
[10:48] gone from you so what are you saying
[10:50] brother I'm saying there's a Perfection
[10:53] amen that is happening on the inside of
[10:55] an imperfect body yes sir that's why God
[10:58] has to change your body and as long as
[11:01] you are in this Natural Body you're
[11:04] going to have troubles don't even think
[11:07] you're not
[11:09] amen but God ain't concerned about your
[11:11] natural body he got that all under
[11:13] control he's looking at the Spirit man
[11:16] that's on the inside of
[11:19] you when the devil say you can't make it
[11:21] you tell him he's a liar I've already
[11:24] made
[11:25] it now we're coming here by the grace of
[11:29] God
[11:30] listen cuz first Peter says 4 and one
[11:33] for as much as then as Christ has
[11:37] suffered for us in the flesh arm
[11:40] yourself likewise with the same mind for
[11:45] he that have suffered In the Flesh have
[11:47] ceased from
[11:51] sin
[11:52] hello meaning by the grace of God you
[11:56] going to suffer you're going to be
[11:58] affected by your flesh but you won't
[12:01] give into
[12:02] it
[12:04] hello amen and when you can come to the
[12:07] place where you have no longer amen uh
[12:10] allowing yourself to give into your
[12:12] flesh amen you have ceased from unbelief
[12:16] amen because that's the reason brother B
[12:19] said every sin that we may commit is all
[12:22] because of
[12:23] unbelief now we came and we showed you
[12:26] faith is the foundation and you must be
[12:29] born again amen right that is the faith
[12:32] seed Lord Jesus Come into my heart I
[12:35] accept you and the word of God said at
[12:37] that moment you have passed from Death
[12:39] unto life that's almost like that little
[12:42] germ amen uh coming into the seed of the
[12:45] woman it's potentially a baby but it
[12:48] ain't a baby yet it's got nine months to
[12:51] be formed shaped amen and it ain't all
[12:54] done yet at the end of that nine months
[12:57] it still got to have a messy
[13:00] birth that's right it ain't over yet
[13:04] that baby still got to cry out for
[13:07] life right when that baby takes its own
[13:10] breath it is an
[13:13] individual and to prove that it is they
[13:15] snip the
[13:19] card Hallelujah that individual don't
[13:22] and you know brother brandom and why are
[13:24] we so tossed about he said all of us are
[13:26] children he said all of us are baby and
[13:28] don't you ever think you grown in
[13:32] God all of us he said we nothing but
[13:35] little children think about it when you
[13:37] think you have come to a place am man
[13:39] you think you know it all oh God God to
[13:42] flipped that switch on
[13:45] you Hallelujah
[13:48] knowledge Amen to judge whether it is
[13:50] right or wrong the word is right I'm
[13:54] wrong God have mercy on us is that all
[13:57] right the word is right and every man be
[14:00] a lie the Bible don't contradict itself
[14:03] that's right remember amen if you don't
[14:05] understand it keep your mouth shut to
[14:07] God give you understanding amen because
[14:09] the word of God is true and let every
[14:11] man be a lie even when it comes to the
[14:14] prophet of God if you don't understand
[14:15] what he's saying keep your mouth shut
[14:17] amen amen because you know I believe and
[14:20] that the more I see this thing the more
[14:22] I believe I says Lord God have mercy I
[14:25] don't need nobody's interpretation cuz
[14:27] God done gave me his
[14:31] amen
[14:32] Temperance means only uh right right
[14:36] when the Holy Spirit
[14:38] Temperance how to control your tongue
[14:41] not be a Tattler and fly off when
[14:44] somebody offends you w
[14:47] Hallelujah you know James said if you
[14:50] can't even do that he said your religion
[14:51] is in vain amen come on somebody amen
[14:56] but this is what God is here for as I
[14:59] said the abundance of this entrance has
[15:01] been ministered to us Paul talked about
[15:03] it and think about it when Paul said it
[15:06] amen in in First Peter uh the 2 chapter
[15:09] uh uh uh uh second Peter the 1 chapter
[15:12] amen he said in the 11th verse an
[15:14] entrance will be made you know what he
[15:16] was so seeing he must have been must
[15:18] have been seeing the last Angel
[15:20] messenger coming down to the rde of
[15:22] Jesus Christ Hallelujah telling her
[15:25] exactly what to do how to get from being
[15:29] hadessa into being
[15:33] Esther amen and all esta had to do you
[15:37] know I was thinking about it when you
[15:39] into those royal families and that Ela
[15:41] didn't have to scrub herself clean she
[15:44] had all she had to do she had maidens
[15:46] there I don't know strange but she did
[15:48] she had maidens there that literally
[15:50] washed
[15:51] her the king didn't have to wash himself
[15:55] they had there were those who washed him
[15:59] and that's what we do all you got to do
[16:01] is let fall on the cross and let God
[16:03] wash
[16:05] you let God wash you a lot of time we
[16:08] spend too much time trying to wash
[16:10] ourselves but God can only wash us
[16:13] that's why he puts a place your arm
[16:15] can't reach all the way back there are
[16:17] some places on your body you can't reach
[16:19] now you might have a brush but in your
[16:21] natural being God put it there so you
[16:23] know you can't clean your whole body it
[16:26] takes God to clean you amen
[16:29] it takes God to clean you oh praise God
[16:33] ain't that good now I went to Godliness
[16:35] and us to be just like
[16:39] God Matthew 5:48 amen says be ye
[16:42] therefore perfect even as your father's
[16:43] in heaven is perfect right Ephesians
[16:46] 4:12 we said the five-fold ministry was
[16:49] given to do what to perfect the Saints
[16:51] amen so it is the will of God for us to
[16:53] be perfect amen but how is it going to
[16:56] take place listen look at all the people
[16:58] where are they it take a five-fold
[17:01] Ministry to perfect you that's why you
[17:03] know I get so I I used to get
[17:05] discouraged I going to say get
[17:07] discouraged but I used to get so
[17:08] discouraged because you know let me say
[17:10] it like this is this okay amen you know
[17:12] nobody in here gives I put it this way I
[17:15] won't say nobody but when it comes Amen
[17:18] to uh flying people
[17:21] in giving them an
[17:23] offering who who where do you think that
[17:26] come from
[17:29] and it it it it and yet you you could
[17:31] pay all of this money for people to come
[17:33] and be a blessing to the people and they
[17:36] have missed
[17:39] church and they don't know the pastor is
[17:42] inspired to get these people in CU they
[17:45] got a word to help perfect them amen
[17:49] it's not my doing it's the Lord's doing
[17:52] amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen and
[17:56] you listen I'm going tell you something
[17:57] I could hold on to that that
[18:03] money yeah y'all understand me but I

[19:24] being like God right being like God
[19:28] being with God acting like God would be
[19:31] right amen so you must and I how are we
[19:34] going to get there first of all you must
[19:36] be born again you cannot be adding these
[19:39] things without being born
[19:42] again right don't try to add it till you
[19:46] actually born again that's what he said
[19:49] in statute of a perfect man don't try to
[19:51] add it till you actually born again
[19:54] cause it won't work you can't make it
[19:57] work it'll come to this or or this here
[20:01] it'll crumble somewhere but when you get
[20:06] down here to the genuine born again duve
[20:09] you don't add nothing it adds to
[20:12] you huh comes up on come on up all right
[20:17] coming to the perfect all right the 60
[20:21] uh uh let's add the Bible said here
[20:23] adding brotherly kindness and all up now
[20:26] you see what brother Brook listen let me
[20:27] say it like this and this is one of
[20:29] those uh quotes uh brother Shar with me
[20:31] which is so true it's so un listen when
[20:34] you when you when you uh sometime this
[20:36] week listen to the unconditional
[20:39] Covenant Abraham unconditional Covenant
[20:43] and you'll find out brother Bram talks
[20:45] about how Jesus Christ swore by his
[20:48] death he'll do it for
[20:51] you cuz nobody can do it nobody
[20:56] everybody had a covenant and the
[20:57] Covenant they were breaking them left
[20:59] and right but you can't do it I can't do
[21:02] it no man can add to the cuic the statue
[21:04] of but God purposely put a seed in you
[21:08] and he knew the seed had the ability to
[21:10] do
[21:11] it
[21:13] listen now you think about it God
[21:16] protected Abraham even while he was
[21:18] lying
[21:21] right yeah he never switched the the
[21:25] Covenant because Abraham lied he never
[21:27] changed the cuz Sarah laughed and what
[21:30] did God do when Abraham
[21:32] laughed he couldn't cuz God done already
[21:35] promised Abraham it was unconditional he
[21:37] bind himself to his own word so is it
[21:41] with the bride of Jesus Christ if you
[21:43] bride I don't care what condition you
[21:45] are in now before it all ends up you'll
[21:48] be right with
[21:50] God Abraham lied and you know he was
[21:55] fearful and God said none of the fearful
[21:57] going to go there and he was fearful you
[21:59] tell him that that you're my sister
[22:02] right not moai just tell him half of the
[22:06] story right and God still told our King
[22:10] if you don't go restore his wife and

[24:29] enduring with him knowledge to
[24:31] understand what he believes and remember
[24:33] it's in his heart that's what it is
[24:36] virtue in yourself to let it go out with
[24:39] kindness meekness to him having faith
[24:42] someday God will bring him in brotherly
[24:46] kindness the seventh
[24:49] thing that ought to sound good to
[24:56] somebody brotherly kindness s I'm going
[24:58] tell yall something you don't know what
[25:00] brotherly kindness is until you test
[25:03] it
[25:05] patience longsuffering and you say to
[25:08] you you know what but they know better
[25:11] they've heard let me tell you something
[25:12] you have never heard until you hear from
[25:15] your heart you might have it here but it
[25:18] means nothing until it comes down into
[25:20] the heart and a person cannot react on
[25:23] the truth until it comes down in the
[25:25] heart amen he could pretend but the
[25:28] reality of truth comes from the
[25:31] heart is that all right charity which is
[25:35] love that is the capping
[25:38] Stone he said one of these days in the
[25:40] church he said let it be known on the
[25:41] tape whereever more I'm not teaching
[25:44] this as a Doctrine what I'm going to say
[25:46] now but I'm just wanted to show you that
[25:49] by the help of God what it is what it
[25:51] really is that the first Bible that God
[25:54] ever wrote was in the Zodiac in the
[25:56] skies it started off with Virgin it ends
[25:59] up with the old lion and when I get into
[26:01] the sixth and seventh seal you'll find
[26:03] out when that other seal was opened the
[26:05] Zodiac Mark the that place was cancer
[26:08] the cross fish that's the cancer age
[26:12] amen we're living in now revealed and
[26:14] the next thing the seal tore off it
[26:17] revealed Leo the Lion the second coming
[26:19] of Christ he comes in the first through
[26:22] the Virgin he comes next Leo the Lion
[26:25] I'm bringing his thought see now let me
[26:28] understand so you can understand that's
[26:29] why cancer was ever able to to to be
[26:33] magnified on the earth at the same time
[26:36] the seals were open because that was the
[26:38] age we were living in and the prophet
[26:41] word God gave the prophet said if you
[26:44] can get them to believe that even cancer
[26:47] will not stand before you see because
[26:50] that was the age but that age was moving
[26:53] into the Leo the Lion the coming of the
[26:56] Lord amen and that's where where we are
[26:58] amen come on somebody so if God whipped
[27:01] it last year or year before year amen
[27:04] he's able to whip it now amen listen he
[27:08] goes on say remember it's in his heart
[27:11] and that's what it is virtue in yourself
[27:13] to let it go out with kindness meekness
[27:16] to him having faith that someday will
[27:18] bring him in brotherly kindness seven
[27:20] thing listen now I jump back it ends up
[27:24] with the Leo the Lion and when I get
[27:26] into the six and seven seal it goes on
[27:27] and says amen that's the councel agent
[27:30] we're living in now revealed and the
[27:32] next thing the seal to off it revealed
[27:33] Leo the Lion the second coming of Christ
[27:36] he comes the first through the Virgin he
[27:38] comes next to Leo the Lion I'll bring
[27:40] this through I don't know I don't I've
[27:43] done whether I don't whether I'm going
[27:46] to have time this morning going to do
[27:48] the best I can show you that these steps
[27:50] are in the pyramid just ex exactly the
[27:53] second Bible God wrote Enoch wrote them
[27:57] and put them in the py and the third God
[27:59] always perfect in the third then he made
[28:02] himself his word see now listen he said
[28:06] God perfects it now we was looking at
[28:08] this as being really the third but
[28:10] you're the
[28:11] third he perfected his word in Jesus
[28:15] Christ right in the body of a
[28:19] man right so you and I we look at this
[28:22] and you say here our nation saying the
[28:24] things they are and making fun of these
[28:26] things and their money and their
[28:28] currency testifying that the Seal of the
[28:30] whole universe is God see that I
[28:33] standing up there above that on the
[28:35] dollar bill and that's the Great Seal it
[28:37] never was put on top of the pyramid they
[28:40] couldn't understand why the capping
[28:42] Stone was rejected they head Christ and
[28:45] that's what they did America testified
[28:49] their home dollar bill testified that
[28:51] they were going to reject the capping
[28:54] Stone they didn't seal it they put it
[28:57] there but they didn't seal it amen so
[29:00] their own dollar bill rejected uh was a
[29:04] a a testimony that the World At Large
[29:07] would actually reject the capping Stone
[29:11] he said but it will come someday now in
[29:13] the building virtue building this moment
[29:16] building this statue it starts off in
[29:18] the foundation that's on faith virtue
[29:20] knowledge Temperance patient ging his

[31:44] right oh my I'm GNA read this quote I
[31:47] read again this morning because this is
[31:49] what the page I jumped
[31:51] to amen he says what Jeffersonville need
[31:55] he said thousands of Little Voices the
[31:58] Thundering of God thundering out in

[32:15] against the enemy Hallelujah the devil
[32:18] don't care how loud you holler jump or
[32:22] shout but what he hurts the devil is to
[32:25] see that Sanctified holy life
[32:27] consecrated to God and then he goes on
[32:30] to say that's the Thunder that shakes
[32:33] the
[32:36] devil hallelujah it's your lives it's
[32:39] our lives is that all right right Christ

[32:48] speak through you he want to see through
[32:51] your eyes he want to use your
[32:53] lips right oh help us Lord Jesus Jesus
[32:59] yes and that came from why people are so
[33:00] tossed
[33:03] about let your sermon be
[33:07] live that's the best sermon ever
[33:10] preached Let It Be Live let me read this
[33:13] is okay amen he says then Peter here
[33:17] says first thing Faith virtue see coming
[33:20] up knowledge Temperance patient
[33:21] godliness brotherly kindness and
[33:23] brotherly kindness and then the love of
[33:25] God the Holy Ghost Christ in in the
[33:28] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[33:30] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:33] and you got all these virtues sealed in
[33:36] you then God lives in a tabernacle
[33:39] called the building the living
[33:41] Tabernacle of the Living God Dwelling
[33:43] Place when a man possesses these kinds
[33:46] of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon
[33:49] him no matter you might speak with
[33:52] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[33:54] that God's Got You might do that but
[33:56] until these vers churches here Co into
[33:59] you you still off the real true
[34:01] foundation of Faith think about
[34:04] that but when these virtues grow in as
[34:08] you added that to that then you are
[34:11] living monuments you are living moving
[34:15] Idol but you know the heathens they
[34:18] prostrate themselves before an idol
[34:19] imaginary God and in an imaginary way
[34:22] they believe that the imaginary God
[34:24] speaks back to them that's heathenism
[34:27] that's romanism they bow before all
[34:30] kinds of saints and everything else they
[34:32] have saints Cecilia houseu and so many
[34:35] different things like that they bow to
[34:37] that and actually believe that in an
[34:40] imaginary
[34:41] way and we don't have to imagine nothing
[34:45] he says what what a type it is to the
[34:47] true Living God but when we not in an
[34:50] imaginary way but prostrate ourselves
[34:52] before a living God a living virtue a
[34:55] living knowledge a living patience a
[34:58] living godliness a living power coming
[35:00] by the Living God makes a living man a
[35:03] Living Image the statue of God what he's
[35:06] doing the same thing that Jesus did
[35:09] walking the same way he walked doing the
[35:12] same things he did because it's not an
[35:14] imaginary thing there's a reality that
[35:17] proves it I love that there's a reality
[35:20] that proves it see what I mean see how
[35:23] these virtues these building materials
[35:25] type in with the church Messengers with
[35:27] the church ages now how one of these
[35:30] days we're going to take each one of
[35:32] these words and study them out and show
[35:34] that it proves
[35:36] this right it goes together sure oh my
[35:40] how wonderful that is to see what it
[35:43] does now why is it so important to us to
[35:46] see these things is because the world is
[35:48] trying to tell us we don't have to do
[35:51] it oh you got Grace and that's enough
[35:55] but Grace is go is the time that God
[35:57] allow tght you to get it right
[36:02] amen woo come on somebody bringing us to
[36:05] a place where the world is dead just
[36:08] give me a few more
[36:10] minutes you know because I'm not going I
[36:12] don't want to rush through none of this
[36:13] I want I want God to really really show
[36:17] us amen where he's taking us and people
[36:20] I want you to know amen there's no fear
[36:23] you don't have to fear when the shepherd
[36:25] himself is leading you amen right amen
[36:29] uh that's what David said the Lord is my
[36:30] shepherd and I shall not want right so
[36:33] you don't have to fear amen when God is
[36:36] doing something for you is that right
[36:40] amen amen amen yeah even in church
[36:44] sometimes it's hard to keep our minds on
[36:46] the word amen but you know you have to
[36:49] fight to keep your mind on the word
[36:53] amen like I always said take he goes on
[36:56] he says take the saath out of a peach
[36:58] tree and if you can transfer it by
[37:01] transfusion into an apple tree the apple
[37:04] tree would bear
[37:07] peaches sure certainly would no matter
[37:10] what the branches look like it's got an
[37:13] apple tree sap in it and whatever tree
[37:16] it is take the life out of that apple
[37:19] tree take it out and give it a sap
[37:23] transfusion and drain from the peach
[37:25] tree over into to The Apple Tree what
[37:28] happens it won't bear no more
[37:32] peaches see no sir it won't if the peach
[37:36] tree life comes into the apple tree
[37:38] rather it won't bear no more apples
[37:41] it'll bear peaches because it's got the
[37:43] life of it in it so is God is saying to
[37:47] you this evening if you bear God let God
[37:51] drain that Old Devil out of you that old
[37:53] bad sap that old bad blood out of you oh
[37:57] my and let God transfuse his blood into
[38:00] you he said it will never bear that bad
[38:03] blood fruit no more it'll bear the fruit
[38:06] of God
[38:07] Amen right you take us that's nothing
[38:11] but a wild Gorge or a not
[38:14] head and there's nothing to us for we
[38:17] all dead in sin and trespasses we're all
[38:20] in these kind of conditions and then we
[38:23] ourselves can prostrate ourselves give
[38:25] ourselves up until God takes his trans
[38:27] Fusion to the name of Jesus Christ
[38:30] because there's not another name under
[38:31] heaven whereby we must be saved and
[38:33] transfer the Life of Christ into us then
[38:36] we have this kind of Faith the faith
[38:40] that Christ had amen oh
[38:45] lord it's almost too much for your heart
[38:47] to comprehend but I'm going tell you
[38:50] it's the truth and I might not know how
[38:52] it's done but I know it's done not it
[38:56] will be done it's done amen amen where
[38:59] brother in my life I may not have seen
[39:02] all of the glory of it but I'm coming to
[39:04] it brother and so will you if you
[39:06] believe it that way amen Abraham called
[39:09] those things that be not as though they
[39:11] were
[39:13] Hallelujah you got to realize it wasn't
[39:15] easy for Abraham oh 85 year old man
[39:18] however it was first of all when God
[39:20] called him I think he was 75 and a Sarah
[39:22] was 65 and then add 25 years to that or
[39:25] whatever it took amen you think about it
[39:27] old come on somebody I I'm not even that
[39:32] old so you got to realize by the grace
[39:35] of God that was no easy task that was
[39:41] tough that was tough amen but still he
[39:45] believed it anyhow I don't care how
[39:47] crumped your
[39:49] be God said so and I believe it and
[39:53] that's the way you got to believe it I
[39:54] don't care how your flesh kick up and it
[39:56] look like the devil try to make you
[39:58] think you a Devil's Child that don't
[40:01] mean a thing that's right don't mean a
[40:05] thing you got to believe what's in you
[40:08] see cuz the devil can't hear the gospel
[40:10] but you can hear the gospel amen you
[40:13] thirst for the gospel the devil don't
[40:15] thirst for righteousness and God said if
[40:17] you thirst for it you shall be
[40:19] faled
[40:23] right and Christ Faith was not I'm just
[40:25] going to read this quote I'm GNA let you
[40:26] go and Christ's Faith was not based on
[40:30] those Pharisees or Sadducees or in their
[40:33] pots kettles and pans and their washing
[40:36] it was based on the word of God so much
[40:39] until Christ was the word my I I meant
[40:43] to read that scripture where he said he
[40:45] suffered In the Flesh think about it for
[40:48] you that means everything he you he went
[40:52] through he suffered for you see we don't
[40:55] have to suffer as such but the Bible
[40:57] still say likewise arm yourself to
[41:01] suffer in the flesh he took all your
[41:05] penalties when I was studying and
[41:07] thinking about that I thought about how
[41:09] that veil was rent the Bible said the
[41:12] veil was his
[41:14] flesh his Veil his flesh was rent for
[41:18] you and I from the top to the bottom
[41:21] Hallelujah that Soldier went this way
[41:25] boomop had to
[41:27] right because that's the way God did it
[41:30] in the temple he started at the top and
[41:32] came down Hallelujah and listen the word
[41:35] of God tells us amen that blood and
[41:38] water came out of there and we know it
[41:40] was from a broken heart Hallelujah where
[41:43] did the Bride come from not just from a
[41:46] rear bone came from the heart of God
[41:50] call it the bosom if you
[41:52] like so here God comes along and showed
[41:56] you he suffered for for us that we might
[41:58] come back into him and that's why the
[41:59] Bible said our lives are here amen our
[42:03] lives are here in Christ Jesus amen
[42:06] that's exactly right oh people of God
[42:09] how can we not blossom bloom and bring
[42:11] forth birds and armor and all that how
[42:13] can it not be God has already ordained
[42:16] it to be so the word was made flesh and
[42:19] then when we get we can get so uh
[42:22] transfused by his power that we'll die
[42:24] to our own thinking and our faith
[42:26] becomes a genuine Faith then the Life of
[42:29] Christ is transfused into us we become
[42:31] living creatures of God a dwelling place
[42:33] where the Holy Spirit can send his
[42:36] radiant blessings down through there and
[42:38] we're in the Statue of Christ Jesus said
[42:41] it's not it is not is written you
[42:43] condemn me saying I the Son of God is it
[42:46] not written that ye are gods don't your
[42:49] law own law say that like Moses like
[42:52] Elijah like those prophets who live so
[42:54] close to God that God just transferred
[42:56] himself right unto them and they spoke
[42:59] not themselves but God take no thought
[43:01] what you should say cause it's not your
[43:03] you that speaks it's a father that
[43:05] dwells in you he do he's do he he doeth
[43:09] the speaking his words were not his own
[43:13] because his life he's dead if you die
[43:16] you take the blood out of a man you
[43:18] embomb him trouble of it is a lot of
[43:20] them never got in
[43:22] bom he said like uh he says listen like
[43:26] uh uh h I I've said take the sap out of
[43:29] the peach tree and if you can transfer
[43:31] it by a transfusion into an apple tree
[43:33] the apple tree would bear peaches sure
[43:36] certainly would no matter what the
[43:38] branches look like it's got an apple
[43:40] tree sap in it whatever ever tree it is
[43:43] see take the life out of the apple tree
[43:45] take it all out give it a sap
[43:47] transfusion drain from the peach tree
[43:48] over into the apple tree and what
[43:50] happens it won't bear no more peaches
[43:52] see it the peach tree life comes into
