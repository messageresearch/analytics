[36:35] just because
[36:40] [Music]
[36:47] [Music]
[36:51] is
[36:57] great God bless the church
[37:07] amen we're so happy to be here the
[37:09] prince of the Lord
[37:11] and I will greet you all to the Lord for
[37:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[37:16] merry Christmas and happy familiar today
[37:19] this boy
[37:40] Lord you kept us safe in the Lord Jesus
[37:43] Christ
[37:46] Lord you give us all the blessings
[37:53] of what we just want to say
[38:06] Jesus Christ
[38:26] we reach up to four
[38:30] method chapter four of us
[38:38] Matthew chapter 4.
[38:56] that will say
[38:58] now when Jesus has buried their children
[39:01] was accustomed to prison
[39:06] and living Nazareth he came and dwelled
[39:10] in the premium which is upon the Sea
[39:12] Coast in the borders of several and
[39:15] Neptune
[39:16] that you might be fulfilled which was
[39:18] spoken by God
[40:04] uh
[40:59] foreign
[42:10] in my life
[42:30] and there was light and God saw the
[42:34] light
[42:34] that it was good and got divided the
[42:37] light from the darkness amen here in
[42:39] Genesis chapter 1 verse 3
[42:42] first of all God had to speak the word
[42:44] let there be light
[42:46] amen and that word that God spoke in had
[42:49] that God spoke had to be manifested amen
[42:52] and then the thing that showed that that
[42:54] word was manifested was the result that
[42:56] that life brought amen when the light
[42:58] came when the Lord when the light was
[43:00] there that light was the Vindication of
[43:03] that spoken word amen that light was
[43:05] there to prove it meant that God had
[43:08] just created the light was there it
[43:11] meant to prove that a word was spoken
[43:13] and here's the result
[43:15] amen so the light is the mind is the
[43:18] Vindication of the spoken word when God
[43:20] speaks amen that word has to be
[43:22] Vindicated amen and the only way to see
[43:25] it amen is one you see the result is
[43:27] that the prophet says that the word of
[43:29] God interpret in itself amen God is the
[43:33] only has the interpretation of his own
[43:35] word amen when he speaks the word amen
[43:37] when you see that word coming to pass
[43:39] amen that's when you know that this word
[43:41] amen is from God Amen it's like in the
[43:44] Old Testament when uh
[43:46] uh God told Moses amen he says that when
[43:50] people will come to we come at you and
[43:52] with prophecies and with visions amen
[43:54] you have to you have to listen to them
[43:56] but you have to wait till if those
[43:59] visions and those prophecies and those
[44:01] dreams comes to pass amen that means
[44:03] that we was from God but if it doesn't
[44:05] come to pass amen that means it wasn't
[44:07] from God and those people have to come
[44:09] and repent amen because the word of God
[44:11] when it's spoken amen that word will
[44:14] never come back void amen that word will
[44:16] come with the result the man it's like
[44:18] the Bible says that one God sends down
[44:20] the rain amen that rain comes down for a
[44:23] certain purpose amen that ruins will
[44:25] never that ring will never go back
[44:27] unless he has fulfilled amen the purpose
[44:29] for which it was sent
[44:31] amen the word of God the light of God
[44:34] the light is the Vindication of the
[44:36] spoken word when God say let there be
[44:39] light amen that light was there to
[44:41] manifest that to show to people amen
[44:44] that the word of God is true the prophet
[44:46] says that what is the light he said that
[44:48] all natural life comes by a spoken word
[44:51] and the son is the spoken word
[44:54] he said he created the great light in
[44:56] the heavens for the day and lesser life
[44:59] for the night see and all natural life
[45:02] has to come by God's spoken word a
[45:05] flower cannot grow without the light
[45:07] without the light of God's spoken word
[45:10] shine upon it for the son is the s-u-n
[45:14] is the spoken word of God when he said
[45:18] let there be light see it's God's spoken
[45:21] life
[45:22] and no matter how much people try to say
[45:25] this that or the other it Still Remains
[45:28] the Same you have to have that son amen
[45:32] so life natural can only come by the
[45:35] spoken word of God it's a paragraph 78
[45:38] it says that in spiritual life eternal
[45:41] life can only come by God's spoken word
[45:45] but God Spoken Word of Life life was the
[45:49] son the s-o-n this time life is a son
[45:52] that's why this time in him is light
[45:56] in him is no darkness and he is God's
[46:00] spoken light is that right I mean he
[46:03] said that God's spoken word in the
[46:06] beginning was the word and the Word was
[46:08] with God and the Word was God and it's
[46:10] forever God see and it takes the light
[46:13] of God to strike the word to make it
[46:16] leave
[46:17] here is uh uh uh what he spoke
[46:21] amen he said and now let the light shine
[46:24] amen the light shine and the light will
[46:27] bring every word to his right position
[46:31] it in its season amen oh you see when
[46:35] you come when it comes when it comes
[46:37] time he said that the light will bring
[46:39] every word in its right position
[46:43] Amen in other words he says that uh uh
[46:45] uh the light amen is the source of life
[46:48] amen that's why you see that I was
[46:50] asking myself a question why was the
[46:53] creation of light among the first
[46:56] Creations that God created amen because
[46:58] light in light in the light there is
[47:01] life in the light it meant light brings
[47:03] life amen the sun brings life amen in
[47:06] order for you if you plant something if
[47:08] you sow something in order for that seed
[47:10] to come forth amen it has to be
[47:12] positioned to the right angle you know
[47:15] facing the sun amen that that that that
[47:17] that seed amen has to have a and that
[47:20] has to have a a a I can say he has to
[47:23] have a fellowship with the son amen if
[47:26] you if you saw something in a room in a
[47:28] dark room and you keep it there that's
[47:29] it will never grow amen the way that's
[47:32] it is supposed to grow amen that seed
[47:34] has to it has to come in the presence of
[47:37] the sun s-u-n Amen in order for it to
[47:39] grow even our own personal bodies amen
[47:42] we need the Sun and we need those
[47:44] nutrients we need those uh uh uh protein
[47:47] and and all the good things that the sun
[47:49] has in our bodies in order for us to
[47:51] Amen to keep on growing it may not for
[47:53] us to be strong and to have energy amen
[47:56] the prophet said that in the spiritual
[47:57] life is still the same thing amen God
[48:00] the Jesus Christ the s-o-n amen he is
[48:03] also the the light amen because we're
[48:06] rather Hearing in John it says that I am
[48:08] the light amen you have to believe in
[48:11] the light amen because he was he is the
[48:13] light amen and in him there is life and
[48:16] every seed of God every child of God
[48:19] Amen in order for them to grow amen they
[48:21] have to come in the presence of that son
[48:23] amen they have to meet the son with the
[48:26] have to have a personal relationship
[48:28] with that son it meant they have to come
[48:30] in contact amen without son in order for
[48:33] them to grow Amen in order for them to
[48:36] receive their life amen that the son the
[48:38] son amen have to has to have an impact
[48:41] in their lives amen now otherwise they
[48:43] will not grow otherwise they would be
[48:45] malnourished otherwise amen they would
[48:47] die otherwise I don't know what will
[48:49] happen to them but but in order for you
[48:52] to have a good health amen you have to
[48:54] come in presence of that son the the
[48:56] light amen and Jesus Christ is the light
[48:59] amen he is the Vindication of that
[49:02] spoken word that was spoken amen here's
[49:04] the Vindication of that word that God
[49:06] gave Moses that I will raise unto you a
[49:09] prophet like a prophet like you amen he
[49:11] is that that spoken word that was given
[49:14] to Isaiah that the Virgin will conceive
[49:16] amen Jesus Christ he is their light amen
[49:19] he is that spoken where is the
[49:20] Vindication amen of that spoken word is
[49:23] the Vindication of the entire Old
[49:25] Testament

[49:32] gotta be in this presence in order for

[49:36] life
[49:37] amen and you have to be positioned amen
[49:40] so that that lighting man come can he
[49:42] can hit you we meant to the right angle
[49:45] the prophet said that sometimes that
[49:47] grain lays in the earth dormant
[49:51] all through the winter like seed winter
[49:54] uh he said he said a a winter wheat
[49:57] sowed in the ground but when the sun
[50:00] gets just right it's got to leave see it
[50:05] can't be it can't live without the Sun
[50:08] and God has made promises for every age
[50:11] and every day
[50:13] and when the light gets right
[50:15] and shines upon that it will produce
[50:19] just exactly what this what the word
[50:21] said because he is the light and the
[50:25] life
[50:26] it may want the son amen when the light
[50:29] gets just I mean I mean it hits the
[50:32] right angle amen when that that light
[50:34] gets right amen and it shines upon you
[50:37] shines upon that seed of God that's
[50:39] inside of you amen he has to bring every
[50:41] word of God to pass
[50:43] amen he has to bring he has to bring him
[50:46] and your life will be fruitful amen your
[50:48] life will have result amen when you stay
[50:51] in the presence of the king when you
[50:53] stay in the presence of the son amen
[50:55] sometimes we have cloudy days and
[50:57] sometimes the clouds of Life comes and
[50:59] and it seems like the sun is not shining
[51:01] amen but the prophet says about if you
[51:04] look beyond the clouds in my design of
[51:07] the sun always shines I mean it doesn't
[51:10] matter it means how many how dark and
[51:12] thick the clouds are amen the sun will
[51:15] always shine amen the sun will always
[51:17] raise up in the morning amen and set in
[51:20] the in the evening amen the sun will
[51:22] always shine amen by you have to have
[51:24] the faith amen that will look amen
[51:27] through the clouds amen their faith that
[51:29] will look through the cloud
[51:31] amen when did life when your life gets
[51:34] dark
[51:34] it may know that the light of the god
[51:37] the light of God is always there for you
[51:39] amen when the life gets dark when when
[51:41] things seems like things are not going
[51:44] the way the way it's supposed to go in
[51:47] and when when when the clouds of Life
[51:49] image starts immense sickness and
[51:51] troubles at work at home and everywhere
[51:53] it may know that the Glides of God is
[51:56] always there God's face is always there
[51:58] amen God is always there you just have
[52:01] to have that face so strong it meant to
[52:04] look beyond the clouds amen you will see
[52:06] that light shining at you
[52:08] amen Delight of God came down on Earth
[52:12] and went through a virgin
[52:14] amen was born people made fun of that
[52:17] light and many people made fun of Jesus
[52:19] Amen but they didn't know that that
[52:21] light had a purpose they might notice
[52:23] that in that time amen people knew the
[52:26] word amen the prophet gave the example
[52:28] of Paul Paul knew the Exotic the entire
[52:31] word from Genesis chapter 1 to the last
[52:34] verse of the Bible amen all those Chief
[52:37] priests and men that could tell you
[52:38] exactly the word and where to find this
[52:42] chapter when to find this very verse
[52:44] when to find this and that amen they
[52:46] could tell you the entire Bible from
[52:48] beginning to the end amen but no matter
[52:51] how Intel intellect there were amen no
[52:54] matter how in my knowledgeable of the
[52:56] word that word but they were still
[52:57] living in darkness amen they were still
[53:00] living in darkness amen it's like in
[53:02] this time amen you see people quoting
[53:04] the prophet people know everything about
[53:06] the prophet people know everything about
[53:08] the message they know the Bible they can
[53:11] quote the Bible and everything but you
[53:13] see the still living they're not living
[53:14] in the light of God Amen because light
[53:17] amen it's not only the word amen light
[53:20] is the Vindication of that word amen if
[53:22] you read that I believe chapter one amen
[53:25] how John was talking to Amen to the
[53:28] church amen he was telling them that
[53:30] that you have to uh uh when you have the
[53:33] light of God you cannot hate your
[53:35] brother when you have the life of the
[53:37] Living spirit seven evil spirits and
[53:39] heal her from all the spirits amen that
[53:42] light of God went to that blind man
[53:44] wanted man and that blind man recovered
[53:47] it recovered his side him and he was
[53:49] able to see the light amen that light
[53:52] was was Christ himself walking down and
[53:55] people made fun of him people didn't
[53:57] want to believe that he was the light
[53:58] but yet they were still the light
[54:00] amen is still the same thing even today
[54:03] amen you have the word of God and you
[54:05] show people the truth but they still
[54:06] don't want to believe it amen they're
[54:08] living as the prophet says that they're
[54:10] living in the marriage of that light
[54:11] amen they're living in the in the in in
[54:14] the previous slide amen the light that
[54:16] has been passed amen if they're living
[54:18] in darkness even though they have the
[54:21] word even though that they still have
[54:22] the message amen but they don't believe
[54:24] in that message amen they don't want to
[54:26] believe the message of this present time
[54:29] and when Jesus is the light Jesus is the
[54:32] Fulfillment of of the word of God
[54:35] in Matthew 28 the Bible Matthew 28 uh
[54:39] amen is the light of Psalm chapter 16
[54:41] verse 10 which says that for thou will
[54:44] not leave my soul in hell
[54:47] neither will thou suffer thy the Holy
[54:50] One to seek corruption amen Matthew 28
[54:53] was the Fulfillment of that scripture
[54:56] amen when Jesus died and he was on the
[54:59] tomb amen the Bible says that God could
[55:01] not could never leave him he meant to
[55:03] seek corruption so he had to raise him
[55:05] up from the dead amen and the third day
[55:08] the Bible says that Jesus rose up from
[55:10] the dead amen you went to preach to the
[55:12] souls that was in prison the man he went
[55:14] to Amen to Abraham and to the center of
[55:17] old and opened the gates of paradise and
[55:19] let them all out amen all of them were
[55:22] resurrected amen doubt this scripture
[55:24] Matthew 28 was the light amen was the
[55:27] Vindication of that word that God gave
[55:29] to David amen that prophecy that he will
[55:32] never leave amen he's only he's only one

[56:26] whatsoever you shall ask well whatsoever
[56:30] whosoever shall call on the Lord on the

[56:35] in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[56:38] deliverance and the Lord has saved in

[56:48] that the Vindication was in Acts chapter
[56:50] 38 Acts chapter 2. amen where God poured
[56:54] out the spirit amen when the spirit of

[58:44] Acts amen is the only book of the New
[58:47] Testament that doesn't have any amen at

[1:10:09] so does Satan
[1:10:11] amen he also believed the word
[1:10:14] amen those Pharisees who could condemn
[1:10:17] them
[1:10:18] it may not be who could condemn them not
[1:10:20] believing
[1:10:22] but they didn't believe the word of the
[1:10:24] hour
[1:10:25] they were worshiping the glare of
[1:10:27] something else
[1:10:29] amen it's the same thing they're doing
[1:10:31] today see they're keeping up Luther's uh
[1:10:34] Traditions Wesley's Wesley's traditions
[1:10:37] and the rest of them the Pentecostal
[1:10:39] tradition
[1:10:40] but what what what what of the hour
[1:10:44] the Pharisees was keeping up their
[1:10:47] Traditions but behind the Traditions was
[1:10:51] the true word of God coming to shine
[1:10:54] forth
[1:10:55] and when he did he blinded their eyes
[1:10:59] he meant they couldn't see it because
[1:11:01] they was watching something else
[1:11:04] so it is today
[1:11:06] may God let that soak in
[1:11:09] till it really hits home to the people
[1:11:14] that should believe it it's later than
[1:11:17] you think

[1:11:45] word
[1:11:46] amen they're believing their Traditions
[1:11:49] they meant they're hiding them from the
[1:11:50] truth
[1:11:52] amen Genesis chapter chapter 9 verse 12
[1:11:55] to 16.
[1:11:57] amen the Bible says here that and God

[1:12:16] and it shall be for a token of of a
[1:12:19] covenant between me and the and the
[1:12:22] Earth
