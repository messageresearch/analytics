about restoring all things about a Bride of Christ was dressed in garments are made white washed in the blood of the Lamb he meant let's open our Bibles to the book of Acts chapter sixteen the speaker message called what is faith Amen just a simple message this morning a man Acts chapter 16 will read the from the twenty ninth verse x16 29 and it says and then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto Him the word of the Lord and all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway and when they had brought them into his house he sat down meet before them and rejoiced believing in God and all his house amen now let's go to the book of John chapter 14 John 14 verse 12 and it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments a man one more scripture will turn over to a hebrews chapter 11 Chapter eleven will read the first three verses and it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elbert elders were obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so the things which were seen were not made of things which do appear a malicious power has in the word prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for another church service Lord you said Lord by your prophet that you would keep every appointment father Lord and we made an appointment to meet with you this morning so father we just turn this entire service over into your hands father asking for your presence in this place Lord walk up and down every aisle touch every heart Lord Florida was we open up our hearts to you father though we pray come on in Lord and have your place Lord take the highest place take the highest seat Lord we submit ourselves before you and your sight Lord we confess Ian of our sins repenting of all of our evil works Lord cry out to you Lord that you would wash us and cleanse us and make us white like snow Lord for we have believed your word father and Lord we pray Lord as I speak your word father that you would enter into me Lord and and through my mouth Lord speak the words of eternal life Lord and so I submit my selves to you for service this morning and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you could be seated amen trust various feeling good this morning amen you know it's every time we come here it's an opportunity we come in we go through the curtains there not knowing what exactly the Lord will do but we know that when we come to those curtains that we are in his hand amen we are in his hands we are putting ourselves at his mercy we don't we honestly we I have no idea what he'll do this one you know we just come in we come into this room expecting not knowing if will you know Iran said whenever you come into a church service you'll never leave out the same every service you go to you'll never leave out the same either going to come out closer to God or further away from God amen so as I as we come through like we have a red curtain there you know and you know I'm just I like to do things a certain way sometimes you know I come here and prepare you know tonight is when I pass through that curtain I am entering engine the Shekinah glory of God you know last night the presence of Lord was so thick in this place when I came to study I I almost got on the phone and if I had people to come join me because God was here amen amen and I just I just I slowly walked through that curtain I knew I was walking into his presence Amen all of us you know we when we walked through that curtain this morning we may have walked in here out of tradition we may have walked in here wondering how long the service would take we might have walked in here hoping that you know maybe the service won't take too long so we can get out here and go about our day you know but if we could just put all those ideas down and all the foolishness of the day amen all the foolishness of our natural mind and realize that we have not just entered into a natural room but we've entered into a promised Amen there were two or three are gathered in his name they're right there in the midst of them that he'll be right here so he is here this morning he is walking up and down every aisle the same God that created the heavens and the earth this morning has come into the room to enjoy a time of fellowship with you and with me amen at a time what could happen at a time like this we have entered into the very promises of Jehovah amen we've began to rely when we begin to realize who we are amen we're not just natural being amen but we have been called here by a promise amen and when you begin to realize who you are in the position you're standing in then you don't come into this room I have this tradition but you begin to realize I am stepping into the promises of God amen and the sworn I wanted to speak on what is faith every person is given a measure of faith amen and we all have a responsibility to develop that faith amen when you first come on the road as a Christian the very first step you take on that road is by faith you have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ have to believe that what the Bible says about him is true Amen that he is the son of the Living Almighty God that the very God that created the heavens and the earth created the heavens and the earth with his word and not just his word but with the faith behind that word to believe that the word that went out of his mouth would create everything the we're enjoying today amen so God created the heavens and the earth by faith in his own word amen and was a very first step that you take as a newborn Christian as a newborn believer in Christ you step into that same position by saying I believe the word that I have heard I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God and you're entering into becoming a son or a daughter of God because you're stepping into the very thing that God used to create the heavens in the earth amen was it God is trying to to bring you to give you power to become the sons and daughters of God amen a little Creator amen because you're stepping into the same it's the same nature that he has because God is a creator he loves to create things he likes to create something out of nothing amen amen when he takes something that is barren now if you could go back to Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 the way that it reads there and the King James it you could actually read it a little bit differently because it says not just that the world was formless and void but that the world became formless and void amen and so just like us we and the backing gods and gods thinking before the foundation of the world you were not formless and void amen look back before the foundation of the world and God's thinking you are not acting in doubt in God's thinking before the foundation of the world you were not bound by sin and unbelief Amen so what so hot so but we come here on this earth and we find ourselves bound by sin and unbelief so so just like the earth was bound by darkness and waters were covering the deep amen the light couldn't penetrate through that atmosphere and through those waters to get down to the dirt amen but God in faith spoke out and believed and he said let the dry land appear amen let there be light and light came in the grew dry ground rose up and the light hit that ground and God and that God caused to come out of that ground the very things that he had in his mind a man so does every Christian when you take your first step as a Christian you step out in faith you say I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God amen and I submit my life to him you are taking the first step amen of the pyramid there as you're getting that very first foundation there of faith you are becoming a little creator amen amen what is it that let there be light in your life the draught you who are once formless and void now the dry ground is a period Amen what is it now the fruits of the gospel are ready to start springing up in your life why because the you and him are into fellowship amen he is giving you power to become sons and daughters of God amen your beginning power to become the son or daughter God why through faith you are creating a world and living in Amen by faith a world is being created in your own life that's what happens what a man first becomes a Christian that faith is setting into action a chain of events and that chain of events will go from glory to glory into glory amen and that chain of events will keep going out through all of your Christian life so when you first become a Christian how do you become a Christian you first have to recognize that Jesus Christ is what he says he was he is the son of God and when have faith rises up and you say I believe that Jesus is the Son of the Living God that starts that faith right reaction amen now when that faith starts moving on down through your life that now God has something in his mind from before the foundation of the world there was a picture of how you're supposed to be amen and let me tell you what all of heaven and earth is behind you to make sure you fulfill exactly what that picture was Amen God has a picture of what you are supposed to be from before the foundation of the world because you weren't supposed to be without form you weren't supposed to be without void you weren't supposed to be living in darkness Amen you were supposed to be living in doubt you weren't supposed to be living in unbelief you were supposed to be living in your sins amen so what God has a picture of you from before the foundation of the world amen and and and what is it and when and wouldn't that little personally thing strikes you and you begin to realize and you catch the revelation of what that picture is God sets a chain of actions and events now it's not going to be an easy path amen there's going to be a lot of trials along the way amen every son that comes to become like a little creator every son and daughter of God that comes to this earth when you become a Christian you're signing up to be tried in the trials of the enemy amen you're signing up to be to be tested you will be shot it you will be confused at times Amen you'll be you have all kinds of trials and deep fiery times come about you amen you'll come to times where you or Satan will try to tempt you to doubt this or doubt that you'll come to areas where you don't know where you could even take another step forward amen by God sill that picture no matter what happens in your natural life that picture is always there amen because nothing can can't can contradict nothing can come against the photo that God took of you from before the foundation of the earth and what God had it in his mind for you that you were predestinated for him before the foundation of the world the the nothing and nothing of Satan can can't can't come and get set now he can come against it but nothing can he cannot frustrate God's purpose to the point of it not coming to pass Amen because God's will will come to pass you know what Amen you know like I said you know the the better the manure are the better of the plant amen amen so all hell's against us fulfilling God's own word Amen I know we have lost children here today so I just really wanted to take kind of a just a real simple gospel message thing what is faith so just for all the children I just I really want you to grasp this this morning that how do you become a Christian how does someone become a Christian you know we grow up in church you think well at what point do I become a Christian well if God has called you to be his then the moment that he starts moving upon your heart what do you do you stand up you accept him you say Lord I believe like we read there I want to read that book of Acts again we read that there at the beginning act 16 here's this man he's a he's a jailer Paul and Silas have been thrown into jail there's a responsibility to us to make sure that Paul and Silas stayed in jail but God had something else in mind amen and so in so in this jailer began to realize that a supernatural angel what will happen Paul and Silas were in prison which let's read there from verse 25 Paul and Silas were in prison and Aaron if you could put this up on the screen and if verse 25 there says that as they were in prison it says and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed they sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard them now at this point Paul and Silas were already way up on the church way up on they're on they're on they're on their journey of faith they meant they've added to their faith virtue they've add to their virtue knowledge amen they've add to their knowledge temperance and patience and godliness amen they are now a living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place that's what Paul and Silas work but this jailer here amen he is not in that position amen he doesn't have faith yet he doesn't have the very bottom of that pyramid there amen so but but now watch this but Paul and Silas and the jailer are all made of the same material amen they're all made of the same material and they all have a call of God upon their life amen but now now what happened is is that one thing that faith does is it removes the effects of time okay and I'm going to get into that a little bit later but faith removes the effects of time on your life amen so so that time is not you're not bound by time amen so we're getting to a little bit later but so Paul and Silas and the jailer what they all have been before the foundation of the world called by God God has a picture of them before the foundation of the world of what they're supposed to look like but the jailer doesn't look like that yet but Paul is Silas are already all the way up the road on the way to be in a statue of a perfect man but the jailer is not there amen so the jailer begins to look upon these temples of the Holy Ghost Paul and Silas were temples of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was in them and they've been thrown in jail but yet the Holy Spirit was on the inside of them and couldn't be taken out of them amen so that the same Jesus that they believed in had now entered down inside of them amen these men were Christians amen Christ was living on the inside of them so Impala and Silas were thrown into jail even though they were in jail that Christ could not be taken out of them and so they're in jail and they're singing praises unto God they're worshiping God no matter how many times they've even beaten no matter if their arm was broken no matter how much they are bleeding they had stripes upon their back they've been whipped but for all the pain and the abuse the the Holy Spirit down the inside was quickening them because Jesus Christ was living down on the inside of their lives amen and now now that's because they had accepted Christ and had followed his footsteps the jailer was getting ready to become a Christian I hadn't accepted Christ yet but God conserves them all the same the only difference is time they meant amen Paul had not become a Christian yet but in God's mind he always was a Christian amen was that what was lacking then just the faith amen our God had faith but God needed the jailer to have faith well what caused this faith to rise up in the jailer by seeing the attributes of the Living God down on side somebody else a man so let's read about this somebody else here verse 25 and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners her them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loose and the keeper of the prisoner wakened out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried out with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here so then what happens the jailer he calls for a light he sprang in and he came trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and they said look this what look what happen he said sirs what must I do to be saved had it ever happened in the history of the world that a prison keeper asked his own prisoners to save him now it should be the other way around that the prisoners are asking the jailer save us deliver us out of this place but the thing of it was is that Paul and Silas they were actually free and this prisoner than the jailer here the prison keeper he was the one that was bound he was the one that was in prison amen and what but what happened a faith something sprang up down on the inside that was pre destiny before the foundation of the world was on the inside this jailer and by seeing the the attributes of the Paul and Silas of Jesus Christ on this side it drew up a faith within him there's a possibility there's a chance that I could be saved that I could have the same thing that these men have a man saw what Paul Silas do they said the jailer said in verse 30 and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved and and they Paul Silas said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house a member sir three and he took the same hour of the night and washed their stripes he was baptized he and all of his straightaway amen that man became safe amen now the jailer is experiencing faith amen the very power that God used to create the heavens and the earth has now entered into the heart of the jailer and now he is becoming a son of God amen he is on his road to becoming exactly what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world amen now what could stop that process God's already called him amens like I had I had someone was really being hard on me wants about the way I believe and the doctrines that I believed in it and he didn't the man didn't believe in predestination or anything like that and and I so I asked him I said so when do you think Abraham was saved you know when was Abraham saved you know God when when when God flooded the earth within the days of Noah he needed a restoration on the earth amen God had promises he had a lot of promises that need to be fulfilled upon the earth amen and he needs someone to be an inheritor of those promises amen so God in his mind had already predestinated Abraham to be the heir of those promises amen and so Abraham here he is he he marries his cousin amen and she is barren a man and God calls him and his wife to come out of her and to go wander around in a desert place so here he is he's childless his wife is barren he's left all that he owns and he's wandering around in the desert he doesn't have very much to speak of but what but he does have because he has faith he's believed God's Word and because he's believed God's Word the very power that that created the heavens and the earth he has everything a mint when you first become a Christian that and you have that faith let me tell you that is yours as a possession and that faith you know we think we think all that's down at the bottom of the pyramid no it's that is the very fabric of everything that is on that pyramid because it is all by faith you have to add every bit of it to your faith amen that's why Satan when he comes he has to he always attacks your faith first amen if I could just stop right here for a second when we last was it last time if there's last Sunday we preached on the armour of God I got suffusion six isn't it amen I just kind of want to go through that real quick the armour of God now when you become a Christian you are given armor amen armor belongs to every Christian amen will you cut why because you were given this faith because the moment you were given faith you're all sudden signing up to be attacked by the enemy amen so you're given certain things to do to put on to protect yourself from these attacks amen and so when a when you when you come to a Christian you're given there in Ephesians chapter 6 it says to put Jesus 613 says wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen stand therefore having your loins Girt about with the truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith you should build to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God amen man praying always now these the this armor Satan as soon as you sign up Don this Christian walk Satan is gonna go after your armor amen he does not take this armor from you he convinces you to lay it down amen if you ever find yourselves in trouble upon life's Christian walk upon life's journey if you favor find yourself in sin doubt or unbelief after you become a Christian it's because Satan comes to to disarm you and take the armor from you Amen so what does he do if when you're standing there he always comes up and tries first he always wants to see how you react so he always gives you something little to do right Satan always tells you gives you something small and if he sees you react to that then he knows he's got you amen if he sees you react to the little thing that he knows that he can work with you amen once Satan gets you to sin and the little things now he can get you to do the bigger things right so what does he do he first he gets comes up to you and he and he gets you to do a little thing and then he has a chain once you go the first inch he has a long chain of actions for you to take from that step on a mint once you stumble the first time he has a chain of events for there was one thing after a bigger thing after a bigger thing if you tell one lie Satan has another lie for you tell after that one if you do one thing wrong he has two or three other things wrong for you to do right after that a man and so once you start doing those wrong things now he tells you now you take off your breastplate of righteousness and you no longer have faith that you are righteous he's attacking your faith because all those things are put on by faith binds it all up amen and so one now that you are no longer can put trust in your righteousness now you have to take your shoes off because here it says your shoes your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace but you can no longer share the gospel because look what you just did he's taking he's disarming and you're the one taking it up you're the one taking it off they and so then once you do that now what you you you now you put down your shield of faith why because you've already taken off your righteousness you take off your shoes now you have to put down your shield because you can no longer blitz a shield of faith you can no longer believe how can you believe look what you just did Amen what is he doing he's disarmed and you slowly but surely amen and so then he so then you now you can no longer use the sword of the Spirit because you're so convicted how do you know that God will ever act on your behalf if you're to pick this world up amen the sword of the Spirit is the weapon that the Spirit uses is the Word of God amen but how do you how can you say that God will intervene on your behalf if you take the sword up when you look what you've done amen so so Satan is now you've now you've lost your you've lost your shield you've lost your breastplate you've lost your shoes amen you've lost your sword amen and so as he do he comes down he comes to attack your salvation and he says well maybe you're not even a Christian in the first place and that's where you take off your helmet of salvation amen because you can no longer believe that you are even safe amen but for all of that God still has this photograph back here amen that was taken before the foundation of the world and the very reason that God called you in the first place is still there amen he's just waiting for you to come back to that point because when you first leave the path you always have to come back to that very own path amen where you left it amen and you do that through repentance when you cry out to God now remember we know we cannot we cannot give ourselves repentance amen amen and you know we cannot be sorry for our sins by ourselves that's a gift amen that's a gift and we have to sow it and if you do not have that gift uf asks for it amen if you cannot find yourself to be in a position where you're sorry for your sins then you have to ask God to restore that Amen because if he never restores that you're in a bad case Amen because the only way back is to have godly sorrow for your sins Amen but if God does not know God if he has that picture of you from before the foundation of the world all of heaven is behind you to bring you back to restoration amen amen and that's what faith does and when you take that faith you say Lord I believe everything in your Christian walk is by faith everything has to be done by faith down on the inside you either have faith or unbelief it's only one or the other faith or unbelief amen and if you have faith in there then faith is what operates everything else you do this because I believe I do this because I believe I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ therefore I am safe amen amen so we believe that the God same God that calls us is the same God that has that picture of us Amen that all of heaven is behind us making sure that we attain to the adoption amen to being exactly what God had in his mind for us before the foundation of the world Amen God had in mind that we would be his son his daughter that we'd be little creators a meant that if we saw something that the Kingdom of Heaven needed amen that we could speak it speak it into existence by our own our oh man amen amen amen so Abraham when he first had when he first caught the revelation that the Almighty God the creator of the heavens and the earth was calling him he left everything behind and he started walking and God supplied all of his needs amen and he believed and he believed and he believed and he just kept believing all the days of his life amen so when God came down to him I'm going to restore my relationship of God to the people of the earth and you are going to be the father of those people he says you Abraham are gonna be the father of many nations he said your seed shall possess the gates of every in amen and you who are barren are gonna bear a son you will call his name Isaac and Isaac will possess the gates of every enemy amen and so when when he know in now when he was given that when Abraham was given the promise of that son he had to wait 25 years and yet he believed the entire time now 25 years is a long time amen it's a long time we got there something down on the inside of Abraham that no matter what it was that no matter what came upon life's journey that when God first says something that God means exactly what he says Amen and we'll bring it to pass in your life and there's a faith down inside that says I believe that what God said it's true and you'll not just that way not just for somebody else but for you Amen that's what faith does then that the promises are not just for others but faith grabs a hold of the promises and brings them to you yourself so they can operate in your life amen so that you can be a possessor of all things amen that's what the promise was to Abraham that he would be the possessor of all things on heaven and earth amen Melchizedek had it right amen Abraham met milk his neck the possessor of heaven and earth that possession of Earth there was given over to Abraham as the heir of all things amen and so and so there was a sea that came out of Abraham that was Isaac and that I Isaac was to inherit all the promises but what happened was as God told them to take Isaac up on the mountain amen and he said I want you to take your son that I promised to you I told you that you're the Isaac's sons and daughters would take over the earth and that all this land will be theirs right and that the meek shall inherit the earth amen but now I want you to take this 12 year old boy Isaac and I want you to take him up upon them all altar on the pond the mountain where I will show you and I want you to kill him as a sacrifice unto me and to do and to basically destroy the very promise that he'd just given to Abraham and so Abraham so I'm gonna do exactly what God calls tells me to do so he goes up upon the all up up on the mountain and and he goes he binds sea ties Isaac up with his hands by his back he lays Isaac upon the altar and he gets the wood ready and he takes out his knife to kill Isaac before he burns him an angel comes down God comes down and says stop what are you doing Abraham I did this now I know that you have given yourself entirely over to me now I know that the faith that you have is not just an act Amen now I not just now that I know but now you know amen now not Abraham and Jehovah had come to an agreement that they both knew that Abraham had faith to believe God in all things but now things can really begin to happen now now what's now see God already believes who you are amen he's longer took the picture of you before the foundation of the world God knows what he has in mind for you but from a Ford Foundation world but he needs you to know God knows but he needs you to know and until you know you cannot see maybe even start on the journey amen but once you can come to realize who you are amen once you begin to realize who you are then that faith can rise up and realize I am a son or a daughter of God amen I am the one that the entire Earth was created for I am the one I am the reason the Bible was written I am the one that Jesus died for on the cross I am the one that he I am the one that when Jesus said that ask what serve you will he wrote that scripture just for me amen now faith is beginning to move now faith is beginning to act now faith is beginning to believe Amen because you're beginning to realize who you are so now when Abraham did that then he beasts he took Isaac he untied him sent him off and he realized that God had created a substitute and he went and he grabbed the sheep and the RAM in the bush and he put him up on the altar and he slew the lamb God had substituted Abraham's son for his own son amen amen and and and in Abraham called the called that mountain Jehovah Jireh in the mountain of God God Jehovah will see to it Amen God will provide all of my needs amen George ire means God is my provider amen but it also means that God will see to it has to do with the scene Amen that whatever it is God will see it amen Jehovah whatever God had him in his mind God will now have in his vision Amen and he will see it provided on the earth a man so God has seen you standing in priests completely all your sins wiped away goddess has thought in his mind now by your faith he is seen it God is providing an amen amen God has already seen you completely restored and healed amen God has seen you now how did Abraham and Isaac have a son in the first place remember the Bible said they were well stricken in age a meant they were ninety and a hundred years old they well stricken in age say how could they have a son Amen there was just no way you think of your great-grandparents or your grandparents how could they have a child they're old they can't have their past the age of bearing children they can't have children anymore but God because Abraham and Sarah were believing on God they say no matter what happens we believe God's Word we believe God's Word we believe God's Word and God all sudden their bodies began turning back to a young son or a young woman in madigan and Abraham and Sarah who are ninety and a hundred years old all of a sudden now they're looking more like they're 80 and I look like the 70 60 50 40 and they go all the way back to looking like they're 20 years old again amen like my brother and sister right here look like an Abraham and Sarah they meant what happened God was restoring their bike because their body had to testify of what was going on on what God was seen a man God had it in his mind now now Abraham and Sarah have it in their mind amen but now their bodies had to produce exactly what their faith was testifying amen and so is it for every single person that is sick Amen or every person that has a neat amen and when you when you when your faith grabs a hold of that then after you once you believe now faith removes time just out of the way altogether time doesn't matter Amen it's just once you believe it's got to happen it's just got to happen amen it's just like that jailer once he first believed now he might have been separated from being in the same position as Paul and Silas by time but he's going to get there a man once he believed taya was moved out of the way he meant and he was just there amen you know you say well you know well maybe he'll be baptized at this time fill with the Holy Ghost at this point and then you know seeing God act in his life at this point but once he believed God already see God already had in his mind all those things were available right then because God is eternal right God is eternal what so what prevents it it's our faith MOOC stepping guests to get up to that position God right now has promised us a rapture amen now do I have a rapture all right now my time is testifying I don't have a rapture right now a time is testifying that that there is no rapture because I don't see a rapture record but God has already testified of it and because I believe it time has been taken out of the way I have my rapture amen now you say no brother I don't see that you're a raptured but I already believe amen I are I already accepted it amen it's our I have already possessed it it's mine amen I believe in it amen you say Troyer you can be turned back to young man I have already accepted it I've already believed it my faith is already grabbed ahold of it it's mine it belongs to me now a time might say that I can't have it you know but but faith takes time out of the equation amen it's mine right now I believe it amen amen I have a need of it amen amen you know it's it's not just a rapture sounds like a neat thing to go through or a neat experience or something you can try out it's no it's something I need amen I need to get out of here amen why because I know I I need to get rid of this body of flesh Amen this body flesh causes me to stumble a man it causes me a lot of trouble it causes me to fall I gotta get rid of this thing well God's so before the foundation of the world took a picture of me and idea wasn't living in this sin born flesh amen I didn't I wasn't bound by a cynic I wasn't bound by temptations I wasn't bound by the weaknesses of this flesh the weaknesses of my mind the weaknesses of my eyes the weaknesses of my mouth I wasn't back before the foundation of the world I wasn't bound by that amen so what so what is preventing me time time is stopping me from being what I ought to be but faith takes time out of the equation moves it out of the way so right now I can be in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now I can be an heir of all things right now the wet sweat I can be perfect a mint right now I can be healed right now I can be delivered right now I can be set free right now all the promises that God has in his great Bible are mine right now it's not tomorrow it's not yesterday he's the same today right now amen time has no bearing on it we have entered into eternity amen we are why because we've been given eternal life a man so we draw from things from eternity or living in eternity now down here this body of flesh is testifying that we're living down here in time but ultimately were not lower sitting in heavenly places we have entered into eternity everlasting life never failing eternal life we've entered into eternity amen and all the promises are ours amen and we look at it and we say well time says I can't have this why because you asked for it and it doesn't show up right away plus time that's doing that yeah but don't but and time creates doubt right but you have faith and that faith who takes time out of the equation and realizing that because a son a daughter asked for in prayer amen that's there it's already there it's yours I possess it it belongs to me I own it I am a possessor of heaven and earth a man I've been given all things amen so don't don't let time create doubt in your life we have entered into eternity amen what is faith it's believing God believing his word constantly faithfully saying I don't care what time says I don't care what the devil says I don't care what my flesh says I believe God's Word I believe God's work I believe God's Word no I don't care where time says I don't care what my flesh says I don't care what the devil says I believe God's Word Satan says that I am a sin born man Satan says that that I've done too much I've sinned too much I I can't get over this I can't need to learn from that you know Satan says all those things oh I've been delivered from the words of Satan amen I've been delivered from things that he said amen I have entered into eternity amen by faith I received that amen I believe it amen amen you say brother is that true can I really can I be like that God ordained you from before the foundation of the world to believe like that that's when you take it personally to yourself that's when you now have faith there's a lot of people out there in the world and you know in all the different churches and denominations that talk about faith oh you know he's he's a man of faith or he's a man of this but let me tell you fit faith is a lot bigger and more beautiful than most people can imagine because by faith God created the heavens and the earth and now he's called you to have the same thing that's not a different faith it's not a different faith it is the exact set in the same faith that God used to create the heavens and the earth he possessed that faith right he believed his word he owned that possession he owned faith it was his it belonged to him he knew that he use it he knew they whatever he had in his mind that he could speak out of his mouth and gods own faith caused it to happen and the earth that we stand on was created and now we come along and we become sons and daughters of God having the faith of God that Wes whoever we ask will be performed by the sacrifice of Calvary amen we've received God's own faith amen so by faith we are saved from our sins by faith we are saved from all the attributes of sin amen by faith we were saved from all the sickness which is an attribute of sin by faith were saved from doubt which is an attribute of sin Amen you know if I stumble and temptation I say Lord you said I would be saved for my sins and I stumbled and fall which is contrary to what you said lord I pray deliver me from this set me free from this event why because he said I would be delivered for my sins Amy let's turn over to John chapter fourteen amen when is up and a believer nothing can stand in his way why because he believes I believe this I claim this for the Gospels sake hey man there's gotta be something down on the inside they just grasped it it grabs a hold of it and says this is mine amen John chapter 14 read from the 13th verse and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen now is that now that's written in God's Bible is that true or false it's true a man so faith can grab ahold of that because it is truth and we know that it is true a mass go to John 15 verse 7 it says if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what she will and it shall be done unto you a hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and so she you be my disciples now is this true or false this is true amen so faith can now rise up that up from the inside of you the same faith that caused you to become a Christian the first place can now come out of your lips and say Lord I have knee to this amen amen let's turn to John chapter 16 verse 23 says and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say to you whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give it you a meant hitherto have yes nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full amen so God had a desire that their joy will be the full amen now what and now what makes a Christian joyful amen every single Christian in this room can testify that when they're living in communion with God there's joy unspeakable and full of glory now let me tell you for if you're not there right now what is preventing you the lack of faith you have to believe amen somehow Satan has allowed a doubt to rise up in your mind amen because all all sin comes from doubt some type of unbelief in your mind Amen something that is for something that Satan is saw slipped down there on the inside of you to cause you to disbelieve amen but it doesn't have to be that way you can repent of that and come back to faith once again amen and then what so what your joy can be full yeah every Christian knows that when you repent and you realize that God has forgiven you of your sins it brings out joy like you've never experienced before when you've been washed and made clean amen there's a joy that is given unto you that is the it's a freshness a cleanness it's like the world was just created all over again all things are possible you've been restored back to right-foot fellowship with God amen Christ and you have become one you can talk together you can walk together you can sing together Amen why because God and his child have been reunited amen why because now you believe in him again amen amen and there's nothing between your soul and your Savior amen when you truly believe amen amen so so what prevents it God or Satan has little little things he always tries to get you he's always attacking the faith amen why is he get you once he Istanbul in descent when he knows that you were saved because he wants you to prevent you from this convenient that's a perfect get this doubt and are on the inside he meant amen amen it's like when you come into communion with God and brings all a love up on the inside if you believe that your brother is just as forgiving as you are it creates a deep love for him down on the inside a man when you can believe that your brother or your sister or your husband or your wife is just forgive just as forgiving as you are what kind of church would we have a man we wouldn't be holding grudges against one another we wouldn't be holding to keeping our brother in prison for the sentence that he's done or the sins that she has done a mint why because when we have forgiveness one for another amen we have faith that the same forgiveness that God has given to us we have that same faith for somebody else that God will forgive them also amen amen amen so there is just here as we get ready to close when when Jehovah substituted Isaac for the slain lamb that's set in forth a pattern Amen so that every every person that can ever substitute their life for the life of that lamb has now become an heir of all things amen and now you stand now it's not Abraham staying here on the mountain now that's you standing on the mountain amen it's to Abraham has already stood on his nothing but now you stand on the mountain amen now you have to two to kill your own nature and kill your own self amen as you go to kill yourself off what does God do he comes down and brings the substitute and sub-sites takes your life up off the altar amen places his life in your place amen amen you lay yourself down upon the altar and what does he do and as you're dying out to yourself he comes along and takes your life off the altar and lays his life on the altar his son the righteous seat amen and Jesus Christ died in your place amen and now the royal seed of Abraham not just the natural seed which was Isaac but now the Royal Sea which was Jesus Christ he has become yours now you have stood upon the mountain in abraham's place amen and then and the Lamb of God has come and stood in your place amen and now now no it's not just Abraham that his possessor of all things now you through Jesus Christ had become the possessor of all things by the same faith to Abraham hat and you have become a son or daughter of God maybe we're standing in the same place and now the same relationship that got you believe God had a relationship with Abraham he did Amen all those years they Abraham walked on this earth he was walking with Jehovah amen and now the time has come for you to have the same relationship amen whatsoever you ask now when Abraham was walking on the earth he was given a city his whose whose builder and maker was God right he was given a city he met the mayor of that city whose was milk hesitate right as so as he was walking in that city and he said that city is around here somewhere he couldn't find it with his eyes right Abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God and as he walked around the Israel he couldn't find the city with his eyes but he believed in that city Amen the the now God did show him the natural city right because the Bible says that when Jesus Christ died on the cross the great earthquake this is Matthew 27 I believe a great earthquake shook the the temple the curtain was written - amen and the graves of the earth were open and the Saints of old except up out of their graves and resurrected and walked in the city and Abraham was one of those saints and he was walking around in the same place that he'd walked 2,000 years before that but now there's a city there but God says now I have shown you this city first I showed you a barren land now I'm showing you a natural city I see you there in the time of Christ 2,000 years later and then he goes up in a resurrection and he's waiting for a holy city to come down and the book of Revelation says that 2,000 years after that that guy I John I saw the holy city descending as relationships eighteen or twenty-one I joined saw the holy city descending down from God out of heaven and Abraham will see that city also Amen so the faith of Abraham walked around a barren place first couldn't see it with his eyes but he believed it was true amen and then he he died his own natural body died right it was buried it weighed their laid their in faith because time could not prevent the promise right so his body testified as his body rot away in the grave and became nothing but bones is even that corruption could not take away what the promise of his faith said his faith was greater than that corruption a man so he resurrected 2,000 years ago in the time of Jesus saw a natural city built by the hands of men but God says now you've seen this this is just a partial of it right amen and then he goes up in a resurrection and waits and now he's waits another 2,000 years and then he sees a city coming down from God out of heaven and it was built wide who Jesus Christ who was himself said do not fear I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself amen now we are standing here in the same place our eyes do not see that city right our eyes do not see that city but we have received the city amen and time has been removed out of the way and we know that that city that he has gone from where for us it's already art amen it's just time that gets in the way amen but God has removed time out of the way for us amen we're entering into eternity amen amen why that's why we can draw from eternal things amen if you have need of a home draw from eternity amen why because he went to prepare a place for you if you need if you need health restored draw from eternity amen because that's you're not supposed to be living here you're supposed to be living in eternity you are born to be living in eternity anyway so you draw will turn how do you get saved from your sins how do you get watched you're drawing from eternity what drew that your faith drew it well you take same faith that drew your forgiveness from your sins to bring you back to right standing like you're in the Garden of Eden before the fall take that same faith that drew your forgiveness and draw your health amen just to take that same that same faith and draw your daily food your sustenance amen take that same faith apply it to your family draw your children amen amen if that take that same faith that you you believe that your sins are forgiven and draw a piece for your home amen all things have been given unto you amen amen having nothing and yet possessing all things we are walking in this world like we have nothing but yet we possess all things I think that's Philemon or Philippines or somewhere in there Philippians I believe we possess all things it's been given to us I'm an heir of it amen God chose me from before the foundation of the world to be an heir of all things I receive it my faith down on the inside of me rises up and accepts it it's mine and I know that if I need anything up on this life's journey I just reach out with my hand of faith and grab it it's mine I need it I need it for the kingdom of heaven's sake and I am a part of his kingdom and if his kingdom has a need my faith reaches out and grabs that for God's kingdom because I'm about my father's business isn't that what Jesus did when he when he when they are he's 12 years old and they're telling him that you should be with your father he said I must be about my father's business his faith reached out and drew the title amen of who his father really was a ment why because that was more real to him than what they had told him in the natural amen amen so we also have to believe the same thing Abraham who walked in that dry land believed that that city was there amen so we walk in this dry land we believe forgiven here we believe health is here we believe our restore body is here a man we believe the rapture is here we believe perfection is here amen we believe that all the attributes there are here amen that the statue of a perfect man is right here it's mine he paid for it amen and my faith says it's mine amen amen faith brought down the walls of Jericho amen faith created the heavens and the earth faith brought Lazarus out it was a great amen Faith's brought that in the dead back to life again faith did all those things and still working in the sons and daughters of God today amen faith will restore you back to the right relationship with him amen because he had a picture of all these things in his mind before the foundation of the world but now Jehovah Jireh will see to it what he thought he will see amen amen let's just an amen the very power that God used to create the heavens and the earth that power has now been given unto those that believe and we have been saved from being natural beans and to mean supernatural means a man let's just grab our heads and word prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for the great faith or that you've given us Lord I now believe as you asked your disciples once they said and they said they said to you Lord now we believe and he said do you now believe and Lord we say yes now we believe we see we recognize who we are lord I pray father that we would put it into action for Lord Lord to accept that without what you have have in your mind from before the foundation of the world is manifesting time Laura the fruits are on the vine Lord the lovely one is coming in playing to you amen of things that were mysteries back before and other ages now Lord now we believe now we receive or that we might be a sign just like just like Paul and Silas were assigned to that jailer may we be assigned to the rest of the world a mystic Lord the rest of the world because we believe past all doubt we just simply believe Lord I pray Lord that you would make this great revelation to all here under the sound of my voice Lord that they may understand Lord the loving-kindness and the tender mercies of Jehovah Lord in their own life Lord to see what he has done for the sons of men to turn them into the sons of God and or we just believe it Lord and receive it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen brother Isaac if you come any man god bless you Lord amen he loved Lord a man like the brother says you amen you don't you don't leave here the same Amen closer to him [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] faith in God who happy in gum have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in who has faith in God [Music] happy happy in God for the answer baby [Music]
