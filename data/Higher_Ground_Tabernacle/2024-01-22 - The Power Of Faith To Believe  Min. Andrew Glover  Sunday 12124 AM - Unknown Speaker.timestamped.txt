[1:09:21] come by and speak this morning
[1:09:25] in the Book of Romans the 10th
[1:09:28] chapter and the 17th
[1:09:30] verse Paul here writing says so then
[1:09:33] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:09:37] the word of
[1:09:44] God now brother brandham tells us that
[1:09:46] hearing by the word of
[1:09:51] God he says or by the word word made
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:56] manifest now in the Book of Luke the
[1:09:58] first
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:00] chapter Paul says that Faith cometh by
[1:10:06] hearing if you're
[1:10:08] hearing that means something is being
[1:10:11] said in Luke the first
[1:10:14] chapter and the 26th
[1:10:17] verse I have quite a lengthy reading
[1:10:21] here but I want to rehearse to
[1:10:25] you the conversation between Mary and
[1:10:28] the
[1:10:31] angel and in the 6 26th
[1:10:34] verse and in the sixth month the angel
[1:10:37] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:10:40] Galilee named
[1:10:46] Nazareth Nazar to a virgin espoused to a
[1:10:51] man whose name was Joseph of the the
[1:10:53] House of David and the virgin's name was
[1:11:03] Mary and the angel came in unto her and
[1:11:06] said hail Thou Art highly favored the
[1:11:09] Lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[1:11:18] women and when she saw him she was
[1:11:21] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[1:11:24] mind what manner of salutation this
[1:11:27] should
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:33] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:11:36] Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:42] God and behold Thou shalt conceive in
[1:11:45] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[1:11:48] call his name
[1:11:52] Jesus
[1:11:56] he shall be great and shall be called
[1:11:57] the son of go the son of the highest and
[1:11:59] the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:12:01] Throne of his father
[1:12:10] David and he shall reign over the house
[1:12:12] of Jacob forever and of his kingdom
[1:12:16] there shall be no
[1:12:20] end then said Mary unto the angel how
[1:12:23] shall this be seen I know not a
[1:12:31] man and the angel answered and said unto
[1:12:34] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:12:37] and the power of the highest shall
[1:12:38] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:12:41] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:12:44] be called the son of
[1:12:52] God
[1:12:56] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall
[1:12:58] also conceive a son in her old age and
[1:13:00] this is the six month with her who was
[1:13:02] called
[1:13:10] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[1:13:16] impossible now the angel has said all
[1:13:19] these things unto
[1:13:21] Mary and in the 38th
[1:13:24] verse and Mary said behold the handmade
[1:13:27] of the Lord be it unto me according to
[1:13:31] Thy
[1:13:35] word and the angel departed from
[1:13:39] her now one other place I want to look
[1:13:41] is the book of Acts the 27th
[1:13:46] chapter just one verse there in Acts 27
[1:13:50] and verse
[1:13:52] 25 we love the Lord this
[1:13:55] morning acts 27 and verse
[1:13:59] 25 now Paul has been given a heavenly
[1:14:04] vision he's going to stand before
[1:14:08] Caesar in a certain
[1:14:11] destination and he's going to go through
[1:14:13] a shipwreck and all kinds of
[1:14:19] troubles but in in the 25th verse
[1:14:24] wherefore sir be of good cheer for I
[1:14:27] believe God that it shall be even as it
[1:14:30] was told
[1:14:37] me may God add the blessing to the
[1:14:39] reading of his word as you can be
[1:14:42] seated I want to this
[1:14:44] morning to talk to you for just a few
[1:14:48] moment on the power of Faith to
[1:14:52] believe
[1:14:54] power of Faith to
[1:14:57] believe and if I could pull something
[1:14:59] out of
[1:15:00] that I want to take for a
[1:15:04] subtitle it shall be even as it was told
[1:15:09] me uh reading Romans 10:17 from the
[1:15:12] Amplified
[1:15:16] Bible that faith comes from hearing what
[1:15:19] is
[1:15:22] told
[1:15:24] faith comes from hearing what is
[1:15:27] told and what is heard comes by the
[1:15:30] preaching of the message concerning
[1:15:34] Christ acts
[1:15:38] 2725 from the Amplified
[1:15:41] Bible says keep up your courage
[1:15:44] men for I believe
[1:15:47] God how many can say I believe
[1:15:50] God and have complete
[1:15:54] confidence in him that it will turn out
[1:15:58] exactly as I have been
[1:16:02] told so in other words what was told in
[1:16:04] the
[1:16:06] vision will be exactly what will be in
[1:16:09] the
[1:16:11] manifestation says oh don't you just
[1:16:13] love
[1:16:14] that it will be as it was told
[1:16:18] me if the angel truly comes from
[1:16:22] God is from God it is bound to
[1:16:27] be it is a direct message from
[1:16:31] Glory again in Jehovah
[1:16:34] Miracles she looked at this great
[1:16:37] Angel and his name is Gabriel now there
[1:16:40] is angels of the Lord there are many of
[1:16:44] them and they come to Earth to bring
[1:16:48] messages Gabriel when he
[1:16:50] comes something major is going to happen
[1:16:54] he was the one who announced the first
[1:16:56] coming of
[1:16:57] Christ he will announce the second
[1:16:59] coming of
[1:17:01] Christ and he told
[1:17:04] Mary that thou has found favor with
[1:17:08] God what a message to bring
[1:17:11] her th H has found favor with
[1:17:14] God so the angel was not bringing Mary
[1:17:18] an
[1:17:19] idea but the angel was bringing Mary a
[1:17:24] message and the message was a
[1:17:27] vision concerning her life in
[1:17:32] 1947 says I have no power within myself
[1:17:35] to do
[1:17:36] anything I am just a man I'm
[1:17:41] uneducated I am sure that my testimony
[1:17:44] is
[1:17:46] right and that truly a supernatural
[1:17:49] being
[1:17:52] came and made these
[1:17:55] statements and I have not been
[1:17:57] disobedient to the heavenly
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:02] vision there was an angel that came to
[1:18:05] Mary and told Mary what would happen
[1:18:09] there was an angel that came to Paul and
[1:18:12] told Paul what would happen and in this
[1:18:16] generation been an angel returned to the
[1:18:19] church with a direct message from Glory
[1:18:24] announcing to the
[1:18:25] church that there is a vision concerning
[1:18:28] your
[1:18:30] life whatever is in the vision will be
[1:18:34] in the
[1:18:36] manifestation amen I don't know brother
[1:18:38] if you can put more of the of the
[1:18:40] microphone in my ear would be great
[1:18:43] 1954 brother preaches Faith cometh by
[1:18:47] hearing what he doing is he's showing
[1:18:51] us that the source of faith is the
[1:18:55] word and the foundation of faith is the
[1:18:59] word and what we preach is the word of
[1:19:03] faith so we're not preaching our own
[1:19:06] ideas we're not preaching a
[1:19:08] denominational idea we are preaching the
[1:19:11] Vindicated Word of
[1:19:13] Faith now do you know that God has a
[1:19:17] provided way to get
[1:19:21] Faith he has Prov Ed a way to get Faith
[1:19:26] he has never changed his provided
[1:19:30] way is his provided way he said is
[1:19:34] believing God's
[1:19:36] word now Abraham received
[1:19:39] faith and the same way that Abraham
[1:19:42] received
[1:19:43] Faith the same way that we receive Faith
[1:19:47] the prophet said if we are God's
[1:19:49] children by
[1:19:51] heir HS of the
[1:19:54] Kingdom we are Heirs of
[1:19:57] Abraham then we should walk as our
[1:19:59] Father Abraham
[1:20:01] walked and we will call things that are
[1:20:04] not as though they were if God said they
[1:20:09] were so you're not just calling
[1:20:13] things you've heard somebody say that
[1:20:16] those things can be
[1:20:21] called Lord through the Vindicated
[1:20:25] message of the
[1:20:26] hour if God said
[1:20:29] so then we don't know how it's going to
[1:20:32] be but God said so so we just believe it
[1:20:38] we move
[1:20:39] forward walking by
[1:20:42] faith see now if you're going to move
[1:20:45] forward you've got to believe the word
[1:20:49] you got to receive the word and you got
[1:20:52] to
[1:20:53] trust the one who revealed the word to
[1:20:56] you has the ability to bring it to
[1:21:00] pass now if a farmer goes out in the
[1:21:03] field and he sew some wheat in the
[1:21:07] field he he doesn't he he doesn't go and
[1:21:10] dig it up every
[1:21:13] day when he sews it he puts it in the
[1:21:16] ground and he lets it alone see it's up
[1:21:20] to God to bring it forth
[1:21:23] it's up to God to send the
[1:21:26] rain said it's up to you to accept God
[1:21:30] on his word and it's to God to bring his
[1:21:34] word to
[1:21:35] pass I say this in a challenge of faith
[1:21:39] that every promise of
[1:21:41] God will be brought to pass if you take
[1:21:45] the right midle
[1:21:49] attitude I don't know if I can get some
[1:21:51] out of this monitor amen now watch a
[1:21:53] Vindicated Prophet teaches
[1:21:56] us he teaches us what faith is and
[1:22:00] teaches us what Faith's power
[1:22:03] is in Hebrews
[1:22:05] 11:1 we know that faith is the
[1:22:08] substance of things for it's the
[1:22:12] evidence of Things Not
[1:22:13] Seen Now by faith the elders obtained a
[1:22:17] good
[1:22:18] report and through faith we understand
[1:22:23] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:22:25] of
[1:22:27] God the things which are
[1:22:29] seen not made of things which do
[1:22:33] appear now says what is
[1:22:36] Faith he says is God by the spirit
[1:22:39] revealing to
[1:22:42] you something that is going to
[1:22:45] do his
[1:22:46] promise faith is God by the
[1:22:50] spirit revealing to you
[1:22:53] something he's going to do or he's
[1:22:56] promised to do he said then you see you
[1:22:59] hear the
[1:23:00] word god reveals it to you that it is
[1:23:04] the truth and by Spirit revealed
[1:23:07] truth he confirms your faith to
[1:23:12] God that's the
[1:23:14] church that's the church that God built
[1:23:18] upon the rock of come on now that's the
[1:23:21] church God built upon the rock and the
[1:23:25] gates of hell can canot Prevail against
[1:23:29] it Faith's power brings to pass God's
[1:23:35] revealed
[1:23:37] Revelation other words the
[1:23:40] vision God and faith is the Revelation
[1:23:45] to bring to pass the vision that God had
[1:23:50] in other words what is in the vision
[1:23:54] will be in the
[1:23:56] manifestation exactly what was in the
[1:23:59] vision will be exactly what is in the
[1:24:03] manifestation if there was victory in
[1:24:05] the vision there will be victory in the
[1:24:08] manifestation if there was Deliverance
[1:24:11] in the there will be Deliverance in the
[1:24:14] manifestation if there was healing in
[1:24:17] the there will be healing in the
[1:24:20] manifestation if there was
[1:24:23] if there was power in the v there will
[1:24:26] be power in the
[1:24:28] manifestation it shall be even as it was
[1:24:32] told
[1:24:33] me now you all know what faith is the
[1:24:36] prophet said that faith is a revelation
[1:24:39] from
[1:24:40] God fath is a revelation from God faith
[1:24:45] is something that's revealed to you that
[1:24:49] is not yet but you believe it will
[1:24:53] be in other words before there's a
[1:24:58] manifestation there's a vision oh my and
[1:25:02] whatever is in the
[1:25:04] vision will be in the
[1:25:08] manifestation another place he said it's
[1:25:10] a
[1:25:11] revelation he has revealed it to you by
[1:25:15] his grace it's nothing you did you did
[1:25:19] not work yourself up in the faith
[1:25:22] you ever have faith it's given to you by
[1:25:26] the grace of
[1:25:27] God and God reveals it to
[1:25:31] you faith is a
[1:25:35] revelation
[1:25:36] Hallelujah faith is a
[1:25:40] revelation said in an audience of
[1:25:43] people when you call a prayer line he
[1:25:47] all good people see there's some of them
[1:25:50] that's trying hard to believe they're
[1:25:52] trying to work themselves into it some
[1:25:56] just can't do it at all see and then
[1:25:59] there's others just by Grace it's just
[1:26:03] given to them now there is the
[1:26:06] difference oh I could preach that for a
[1:26:09] while we're not here this morning trying
[1:26:12] to work our way in this message we're
[1:26:15] not trying to work our way into this
[1:26:17] Rapture we're not trying to work our way
[1:26:19] into this Revelation I'm preaching we're
[1:26:21] trying to not trying to work our way
[1:26:24] into the power of God but by Grace by
[1:26:28] Grace we have been brought in to the
[1:26:32] ration of the word of God the age we're
[1:26:35] living in it's not rapturing
[1:26:41] works

[1:26:54] will not study your way in this Rapture
[1:26:56] you will not learn your way in this
[1:26:58] Rapture if you go in this Rapture you
[1:27:01] will only by the grace of through the
[1:27:05] Fai of his
[1:27:08] word hallelujah bringing to pass the
[1:27:12] revelation of the will of God in the
[1:27:16] you're living in we're not defeated
[1:27:18] people we're not a conquered people
[1:27:23] in we are Overcomers we are
[1:27:27] Messiah
[1:27:29] re of God taken the preeminence in the
[1:27:34] Liv of Believers we overcome we'll
[1:27:37] overcome bad days we over bad
[1:27:41] days
[1:27:43] trials we're not working our way we
[1:27:47] heard the
[1:27:49] vision suceed in our hearts believe the
[1:27:53] vision and we renounced Satan's
[1:27:57] Li we renounced Satan's Li and we give
[1:28:01] our lives to the vision of the word of
[1:28:05] God the Rapture is a
[1:28:09] revelation the Rapture is a revelation
[1:28:14] see it's revealed to
[1:28:17] her now Faith is
[1:28:19] something that's been revealed to you
[1:28:23] like it was to
[1:28:24] Abraham then the absolute of your
[1:28:27] life is the
[1:28:29] revelation of the word of God in the age
[1:28:32] you're living
[1:28:35] in now come on church I don't have time
[1:28:38] to get into it but I'll say it like this
[1:28:41] if you don't move with a
[1:28:43] revelation you have to put Martin Luther
[1:28:47] out come on now Martin Luther according
[1:28:50] to the Bible he would be
[1:28:53] smok
[1:28:54] a but the revelation of the word of God
[1:28:58] in the age he was living here's what put
[1:29:01] him in but when sanctification come
[1:29:04] along you can no longer get by with
[1:29:07] smoking the p with the baptism of the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost you could no longer get by
[1:29:13] with just sanctification
[1:29:16] and in the even
[1:29:18] time even time sh be light there shall
[1:29:24] be a
[1:29:25] revelation will St this bride she will
[1:29:29] rise on the wings of the eagle of the
[1:29:31] word of God and she will fly above
[1:29:36] every oh I'm talking about Revelation
[1:29:39] you know denominations do not believe in
[1:29:41] spiritual
[1:29:43] Revelation you know
[1:29:45] what he said the True Church the true
[1:29:49] church the universal body of Jesus
[1:29:53] Christ is buil upon the spiritual
[1:29:58] Revelation glory to God the true church
[1:30:02] is built upon the spiritual
[1:30:05] Revelation now you all know Matthew
[1:30:08] 16 the Bible said that Jesus came into
[1:30:11] the coast of cesaria
[1:30:13] Philippi he walked among his
[1:30:16] disciples and he said who do men say
[1:30:19] that I the son of man am
[1:30:23] now some of them said you're John the
[1:30:25] Baptist and some said you're Elias and
[1:30:28] some said Jeremiah one of the prophets
[1:30:32] but he saith unto them who do you say
[1:30:34] that I
[1:30:35] am now there were many
[1:30:39] disciples out of all the disciples that
[1:30:42] could have spoke
[1:30:44] up out of all the disciples that could
[1:30:47] have spoke
[1:30:49] up guess who spoke up
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:54] there was disciples there that had never
[1:30:57] done the things Peter had
[1:30:59] done they had never they had never
[1:31:02] walked the path that Peter
[1:31:05] walked but yet when it come time to
[1:31:08] reveal who he was he chose the
[1:31:13] disciple that had the most
[1:31:17] mistakes now come on Church Peter denied
[1:31:21] go
[1:31:23] Peter took his sword out and cut man's
[1:31:27] ear Peter was a cursing
[1:31:30] preacher but when it come time to
[1:31:34] announce who this is Peter spoke up and
[1:31:39] said you're the Christ you are the son
[1:31:42] of the Living
[1:31:43] God can I drop something to you can I
[1:31:47] drop something to you Peter had all
[1:31:49] kinds of
[1:31:50] mistakes I can say this on the authority
[1:31:53] of the
[1:31:54] word Peter's Revelation was greater than
[1:31:58] his
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:00] mistakes Peter's
[1:32:02] Revelation was greater than his mistakes
[1:32:06] some of us are sitting here today and we
[1:32:08] made a lot of mistakes but you know why
[1:32:11] we're still here it's because greater is
[1:32:14] your
[1:32:16] Revelation greater is your
[1:32:19] Revelation than your mistakes
[1:32:22] can I say this you didn't come in by
[1:32:25] your mistakes so you can't go out by
[1:32:27] your mistakes your mistakes didn't put
[1:32:30] you
[1:32:31] in can't take you
[1:32:35] out you
[1:32:37] in Hallelujah the Revelation put you in
[1:32:42] and the Revelation is going to take you
[1:32:45] out
[1:32:47] L and put you in the
[1:32:50] Rapture what is this
[1:32:52] rock it's the spiritual revealed
[1:32:57] Revelation now the prophet of God said
[1:32:59] it very beautiful he said a Baptist
[1:33:02] Minister come to me the other
[1:33:04] day and he said he wanted to straighten
[1:33:06] me out on the
[1:33:07] godhead y remember the testimony and he
[1:33:10] said well when you got time I'll
[1:33:11] straighten you
[1:33:12] out said now is a good time as
[1:33:16] any he said he said now listen he said
[1:33:19] Mr brandom you're teaching on the
[1:33:20] godhead is
[1:33:23] contrary said what do you mean he said
[1:33:26] well he said now look he said there's
[1:33:28] three
[1:33:29] Gods he said now watch there's one God
[1:33:32] in three
[1:33:35] persons said now let me ask you this he
[1:33:39] said what school did you go
[1:33:41] to he told him a Bible
[1:33:43] College said I could believe that he
[1:33:46] said now watch you cannot be a person
[1:33:49] without being a personality
[1:33:53] and if you're a
[1:33:54] personality you are one personality to
[1:33:58] yourself a separate individual
[1:34:01] being he said well the theologians can't
[1:34:04] even explain that and brother Bram said
[1:34:08] it's by
[1:34:10] Revelation and he said brother brandom I
[1:34:12] cannot accept
[1:34:14] Revelation and I said then there's no
[1:34:16] way for God to ever get to
[1:34:20] you because it's hear from the eyes of
[1:34:22] the wise and prudent but is revealed to
[1:34:27] babies saying it's revealed
[1:34:30] Revelation reveal to babies such as we
[1:34:34] learn such as we accept it now in other
[1:34:39] words if you close yourself off to
[1:34:42] Revelation there is no way for God to
[1:34:45] get to
[1:34:46] you see the whole Bible is the
[1:34:50] revelation of God
[1:34:52] the whole church is built upon the
[1:34:55] revelation of God there is no other way
[1:34:58] to know
[1:34:59] God by
[1:35:01] Revelation to whom the son will reveal
[1:35:06] him in the days of the voice of the
[1:35:08] seventh
[1:35:09] angel his ministry will be directly
[1:35:13] connected to Luke
[1:35:16] 17:30 in the days when the son of man is
[1:35:20] not learned
[1:35:22] is not taught is revealed the son of man
[1:35:27] is the revealing of the almighty God in
[1:35:31] the present dispensation we're living
[1:35:35] in now brother says it very beautiful he
[1:35:38] says
[1:35:39] Revelation everything is a
[1:35:43] revelation now not to accept
[1:35:46] Revelation then you're just a cold
[1:35:49] Theologian and there's no hope for
[1:35:52] you God Amen if you cannot accept
[1:35:57] Revelation you are a cold
[1:35:59] Theologian and there's no hope for you
[1:36:02] so brother Brooks you know what that
[1:36:04] tells me is
[1:36:06] revelation brings
[1:36:08] hope
[1:36:10] Revelation brings

[1:57:54] unfolded it's promised for the
[1:58:01] hour this
[1:58:03] Revelation has power to
[1:58:07] release now the
[1:58:09] angel came to Mary he was sent directly
[1:58:13] from God to Mary with a direct
[1:58:18] message prophet of God said whatever
[1:58:21] that angel said was bound to
[1:58:25] be whatever that angel said when Mary
[1:58:30] believed it when Mary received it when
[1:58:34] she gave her faith to
[1:58:37] it when she give her faith to the work
[1:58:42] of what the angel
[1:58:43] said then there was a power of
[1:58:48] infallibility
[1:58:49] come on Church there was a power of
[1:58:54] infallibility that was
[1:58:56] transferred into Mary can I say this it
[1:59:01] came from God into
[1:59:04] Mary into her womb and it moved into the
[1:59:10] fruit of the womb of the product of what
[1:59:15] she was
[1:59:16] carrying oh Church Liv God in the last
[1:59:21] days there will be a return of Oneness
[1:59:26] to the church and the church age book

[1:59:51] not add to it she will not take away
[1:59:53] from it she will just say
[1:59:57] it oh God I feel like preaching right
[2:00:00] now she will just say
[2:00:03] it and your Prophet said upon the
[2:00:07] infallibility of the word there's got to
[2:00:09] come one major voice into this
[2:00:12] generation and he says it like this I

[2:11:49] that man in the straight jacket he said
[2:11:52] there was an angel came to Mary he said
[2:11:56] Mary you will call his name Jesus and

[2:12:10] I'm going to have a son I'm going to
[2:12:12] call his name Jesus before he was even
[2:12:17] born
[2:12:19] power of
[2:12:22] infallibility was already accompanying
[2:12:25] that
[2:12:26] name and when she said Jesus there was a
[2:12:30] dead WB there was a dead baby mother's W
[2:12:36] when the words of the infallible
[2:12:42] name stru the life of that child and she

[2:14:22] anything you do realize brother said
[2:14:26] under the opening of those Seven
[2:14:28] Seals he said the Lord received a new
[2:14:31] name now come on
[2:14:34] Church said what was that name he said
[2:14:37] the name of God he said the word of God
[2:14:42] interpreted is the
[2:14:45] manifestation of the name of God
[2:14:48] then who are you you are the
[2:14:52] word
[2:14:54] interpreted so that's making
[2:14:57] you the
[2:14:59] direct
[2:15:01] manifestation of the name of
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:07] God can I say this to
[2:15:10] you can I try to close on this
[2:15:13] point that God by the revelation
[2:15:18] has claimed your
[2:15:22] body God by the
[2:15:26] Revelation Brooks has claimed your
[2:15:29] body for its
[2:15:33] fulfillment in other words you didn't

[2:16:14] amen only the righteous will be there
[2:16:19] can I say this to you brother Bram
[2:16:22] interprets that he breaks that down and
[2:16:25] says the righteous are the ones who are
[2:16:29] a part of this
[2:16:35] word in other words you are not just a
[2:16:41] product Earth father and Earth
[2:16:46] Mother but you have come from this
[2:16:52] word into
[2:16:56] manifestation I'm running out of time

[2:17:16] seals
[2:17:18] there's never been an
[2:17:20] issue over the first six
[2:17:22] se but there's been more
[2:17:26] contention around the
[2:17:30] seven there's been more
[2:17:33] confusion there been more
[2:17:35] divisions and more man-made
[2:17:39] interpretations but let's come back to

[2:17:58] bring
[2:17:59] Christ back on the
[2:18:05] earth this is not my
[2:18:09] interpretation this is not my
[2:18:11] idea but I challenge you can I can I
[2:18:15] break the Devil's
[2:18:16] Backbone challenge you go listen to the
[2:18:20] message theeven seal in the first six

[2:19:11] people who will understand the
[2:19:14] symphony is those who are interested in
[2:19:17] it
[2:19:19] to the rest of them it's just a bunch of
[2:19:23] noise but to those who are
[2:19:28] elected to those who are elected they

[2:21:03] in a threefold
[2:21:06] manner let's leave March of
[2:21:09] 63 and go to J
[2:21:12] 63 he Christ is the mystery of God
[2:21:20] revealed right and he says the first
[2:21:23] fault is he reveals
[2:21:28] himself by the revelation of himself he
[2:21:32] takes the
[2:21:34] preeminence in a body and by the
[2:21:37] revelation of yourself having
[2:21:40] preeminence in the body he will lead
[2:21:44] that body back to a garden of
[2:21:49] Le SE is coming the Revelation taking
[2:21:56] preeminence in the
[2:21:58] bride and leading her into the
[2:22:04] Rapture the seven seal the is the
[2:22:08] rapture it's the coming of the Lord can
[2:22:13] I say this to
[2:22:14] you y Arizona 196
[2:22:19] the Rapture is a
[2:22:24] revelation and it starts in first
[2:22:26] Thessalonians
[2:22:28] 4 the Lord
[2:22:31] himself shall descend from heaven with
[2:22:34] a that's a message and the voice of the
[2:22:39] resurrection and the
[2:22:41] trumpet the trumpet the threefold
[2:22:44] revelation of the rapture
[2:22:49] Hallelujah now yes sir I'm closing on
[2:22:52] this
[2:22:54] point when the
[2:22:56] Revelation strikes your
[2:22:58] heart that you did not make
[2:23:01] yourself part of this
[2:23:03] message you were
[2:23:05] claimed to be a part of this
[2:23:08] message when that Revelation strikes
[2:23:11] your
[2:23:12] heart you will see that you're just like
[2:23:16] Mary
[2:23:19] now can I say
[2:23:20] this Mary Mary Mary Mary was just a
[2:23:25] young
[2:23:27] virgin married to
[2:23:30] Joseph going about her daily
[2:23:33] life and one day they come home from
[2:23:37] church they sit on the front
[2:23:40] porch to discuss the
[2:23:43] service says that was a good
[2:23:46] sermon
[2:23:48] until
[2:23:50] until the preacher said he's not still
[2:23:54] the Jehovah of
[2:23:58] Miracles brother said she
[2:24:00] stopped and she said now if he ever was
[2:24:03] the god of
[2:24:04] [Music]
[2:24:05] Miracles he's
[2:24:07] always the god of
[2:24:13] Miracles so brother she walks to the
[2:24:16] whale
[2:24:18] and brother said I wish I had about an
[2:24:19] hour on that
[2:24:22] whale you know why because good things
[2:24:25] happen at
[2:24:28] Wales elaser found
[2:24:34] Rebecca said I wish had an hour on
[2:24:37] that he said but Mary was just
[2:24:41] walking and he said the the path she
[2:24:44] took put her in a specific position
[2:24:48] when appeared to
[2:24:54] her and the angel stopped
[2:24:57] her and the angel said Mary you're
[2:25:00] highly favored of
[2:25:03] God can I can I close on this
[2:25:06] point the Angel's
[2:25:08] message was a hard
[2:25:11] message to
[2:25:13] believe but when that message was spoke
[2:25:17] that message
[2:25:19] claimed Mary's
[2:25:25] womb
[2:25:27] claimed Mary's wom for it
[2:25:32] fulfillment can I can I finish on this
[2:25:35] point the devil is a
[2:25:40] liar again the devil a
[2:25:45] li the Devil is a false
[2:25:51] interpreter of the will of
[2:25:54] God concerning your
[2:25:57] life the devil tells you that God is
[2:26:01] against you the devil tells you that God
[2:26:05] is hard on
[2:26:06] you I tell you what the message
[2:26:10] says God has
[2:26:14] borrowed come on come on come on your
[2:26:18] womb for his
[2:26:22] fulfillment in other words when he came
[2:26:26] in the earth he came through a borrowed
[2:26:29] wound he left
[2:26:32] the a borrowed
[2:26:36] grave now if somebody ask to borrow
[2:26:40] something because they don't have
[2:26:42] it that's right that's right right I
[2:26:46] want to say this if I ask to B your your
[2:26:51] iPhone and you look at my
[2:26:54] iPhone every iPhone I've had cracked
[2:26:58] broken speakers don't
[2:27:02] work you're going to be very you're
[2:27:04] going to be very
[2:27:05] hesitant to loan me your
[2:27:09] iPhone but when you know the
[2:27:12] character of the one who is asking to
[2:27:16] borrow
[2:27:19] you will freely give it to
[2:27:23] them can I can I give you the definition
[2:27:25] of the word
[2:27:27] borrow it means to take in you
[2:27:30] something that belongs to someone
[2:27:33] else with the intention of
[2:27:36] returning but also taking in
[2:27:41] consideration the condition of it when
[2:27:44] it's
[2:27:45] returned there will be an agreement
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:49] made to
[2:27:51] repay for the borrowed
[2:27:57] use in other
[2:27:59] words God claimed
[2:28:01] Mary when the message claim
[2:28:04] Mary changed the whole natural course of
[2:28:07] her
[2:28:08] life she went from just a young girl in
[2:28:11] the
[2:28:13] town persed ridic
[2:28:19] hear me but when God got done with
[2:28:22] Mary he did not throw her
[2:28:25] away he carried her to the upper
[2:28:29] room right he carried
[2:28:32] her room and filled her with the very
[2:28:38] life of the one she was
[2:28:41] carry Church of the Living God you have
[2:28:45] been claimed car this
[2:28:48] message

[2:28:53] claimed this
[2:28:55] anointing when God gets done with
[2:29:01] you done with you he's not going to
[2:29:04] throw you away you're going to
[2:29:07] [Music]

[2:29:24] morning you are going to
[2:29:30] stand Amen to
[2:29:33] God in the very
[2:29:37] fulfillment now
[2:29:41] listen I slow down to say
[2:29:45] this
[2:29:47] God is not against
[2:29:50] you
[2:29:52] God has borrowed your
[2:29:56] womb brother B said that he might
[2:30:00] declare that he's the same
[2:30:04] yesterday

[2:30:12] forever this
[2:30:15] Revelation it is claimed your
[2:30:18] life the power of
[2:30:22] infallibility has
[2:30:24] claimed your
[2:30:28] life the opening of the
[2:30:31] word has
[2:30:33] claimed your
[2:30:36] body your
[2:30:37] life for its
[2:30:45] fulfillment can I I say it to you like
[2:30:47] this the prophet of God makes it very
[2:30:51] beautiful he says Mary received the
[2:30:54] Angel's
[2:30:57] message and when the angel got done
[2:31:01] speaking all she could
[2:31:04] say was these
[2:31:06] words be
[2:31:08] it unto
[2:31:10] [Music]
[2:31:13] Meen do you realize when Mary said be to
[2:31:18] me she brought her entire
[2:31:22] life into
[2:31:25] submission to the heavenly
[2:31:30] [Music]
[2:31:32] vision now can I say
[2:31:35] this the world will borrow
[2:31:39] you and the world will use
[2:31:42] you are you hearing me the world will
[2:31:45] borrow you
[2:31:48] the world will use
[2:31:49] you and when you can offer them nothing
[2:31:55] else they throw you
[2:31:58] away young girls give their
[2:32:01] bodies to the god of
[2:32:04] Hollywood to the god of
[2:32:07] fashion and they use them and use them
[2:32:09] and use
[2:32:11] them and when they can get nothing else
[2:32:13] out of
[2:32:15] them
[2:32:17] move on to somebody
[2:32:19] else now don't get mad at me young
[2:32:22] men but the god of
[2:32:26] sported men young men's
[2:32:30] bodies used
[2:32:32] them broke their
[2:32:34] backs broke their
[2:32:37] bones in horrible
[2:32:40] conditions and when the god of sports
[2:32:42] gets done with
[2:32:45] them and move on to somebody
[2:32:49] [Music]
[2:32:50] else can I bring it
[2:32:53] closer the god of false Doctrine the
[2:32:59] devil has borrowed preachers
[2:33:03] bodies hardened their
[2:33:07] Spirits took the love of God out of
[2:33:10] their
[2:33:11] lives and made them
[2:33:13] cold bitter
[2:33:17] figh
[2:33:20] theologians no
[2:33:22] love and used and used and used and
[2:33:27] used and come down to the end of their
[2:33:30] life and they've give their life to this
[2:33:32] false
[2:33:35] Doctrine and the god of that false
[2:33:37] Doctrine walks off and goes to another
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:44] Hing my God
[2:33:48] but this
[2:33:50] Revelation has been spoken over your
[2:33:56] life can I say this when God borrows
[2:34:02] something he pays good
[2:34:07] [Music]

[2:34:15] something listen I just F the room so
[2:34:17] I'm will say
