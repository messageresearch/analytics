[0:00] As we stand, we're just going to turn
[0:02] right to the scripture. Amen. I didn't
[0:05] know I'd gone so long this morning. I
[0:07] was caught up in a place called
[0:09] eternity, I
[0:11] guess. Amen. So, we're going to uh come
[0:16] to you by uh the book of Revelations,
[0:18] the 3r chapter, 14th verse. And then
[0:23] we're going to uh we're not done with uh
[0:26] the other scripture that we we stopped
[0:27] in uh Peter, but we want to use this as
[0:30] a text.
[0:32] Amen. Uh and then we'll we'll we'll read
[0:35] 3:14 and go to Acts 17 28th verse. Amen.
[0:40] Revelations
[0:42] 3. Amen. You love the Lord. Amen.
[0:47] Amen.
[0:49] I just can't get over how Randy and
[0:51] Sister Lindsay look so good together
[0:53] [Laughter]
[1:02] today. Revelation the third chapter.
[1:08] Amen. We're going to read here. He says,
[1:10] "And the angel of the church of
[1:12] Leodysia, write these things the
[1:17] Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[1:21] beginning of the creation of God." Acts
[1:33] 17. Yeah. Honestly, I just can't get
[1:36] over. Sometimes I think about where I
[1:41] was and where I am
[1:44] now and I can hardly take it because I
[1:47] realize where God has brought me
[1:52] from. Surely he's been good to me.
[1:56] Amen. He's he's been good to me. Acts uh
[2:01] uh 17:28
[2:08] I think we're going to
[2:11] start at the uh 27th verse. That they
[2:16] make that they should seek the Lord if
[2:19] happily they might feel after him and
[2:23] find him though he be not far from every
[2:29] one of us. Amen. Now I trust you believe
[2:32] that. Amen. Amen. For in him we live and
[2:37] move and have our beings as our certain
[2:41] also of your own prophets have said. For
[2:44] we are also his
[2:47] offspring, beginning of God's creation.
[2:50] We are the offspring.
[2:53] Oh, hallelujah. Amen. For as much then
[2:57] as we are the offspring of God, we ought
[3:00] not to think that the Godhead is likened
[3:02] to gold or silver or stone or graven by
[3:06] art and man's devices. I think Paul knew
[3:08] that that Catholic Church was coming
[3:12] through. Amen. Ain't God good to us? One
[3:15] more scripture, please. 1 Corinthians
[3:17] 15.
[3:28] 58th
[3:32] verse. Let's start uh at the 57th verse,
[3:36] excuse
[3:37] me. But thank be to God which giveth us
[3:41] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[3:43] Christ.
[3:45] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
[3:48] steadfast,
[3:50] unmovable, always abounding in the work
[3:53] of the Lord. For as much as ye know that
[3:57] your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[4:01] Amen.
[4:02] Be ye
[4:04] steadfast,
[4:06] unmovable, always abounding in the work
[4:10] of the Lord. Amen. Let us pray. Father
[4:13] God, we come before you, Lord, as humbly
[4:15] as we know how. We thank you for your
[4:17] grace. We thank you for your mercy,
[4:19] Lord. We just thank you for being so
[4:21] good to us. We pray, Father, that you
[4:24] would just bless the service once again.
[4:26] Give us grace to move completely out of
[4:28] your way. Lord God, let your voice echo
[4:32] through our soul. We ask these things in
[4:34] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You
[4:38] may be
[4:39] seated. Even though we started on this
[4:42] morning, we entitled the message
[4:45] uh return to where you belong or return
[4:50] to where we belong. Uh I like to entitle
[4:54] this second portion uh the age of the
[4:58] perfect
[4:59] bride. The age of the perfect bride.
[5:02] Remember in
[5:04] 196263 brother Brandham Her I'm sorry in
[5:08] 19
[5:09] uh 65 he was talking by the grace of God
[5:13] about those stars lining up. He said
[5:16] there was five stars that lined up and
[5:19] it was the birth or the beginning of a
[5:21] bride. He always taught us that the
[5:24] heavens always speak before God does
[5:27] anything on the earth. You and I have
[5:30] seen, you know, the the uh uh uh sign of
[5:34] the blood moons and we realize this is
[5:37] not something that's just happening. We
[5:39] understand that these things have
[5:41] happened before and it is what what it
[5:44] is. We see the coming and the approach
[5:47] of the Messiah. Now, God told us, amen,
[5:50] that we should look at these signs and
[5:53] said that the heavens will always
[5:55] declare of his glory. So it's not wrong.
[5:58] You know people a lot of time people
[5:59] look at things and they think okay
[6:01] because I remember the time when they
[6:04] taught us oh having any knowledge of
[6:06] astrology or anything like that was uh
[6:09] was wrong. But then our prophet comes
[6:12] and let us know that that was God's
[6:14] first Bible. Now it was no coincidence
[6:17] that God's Bible starts off with uh the
[6:21] virgin. Amen. Can I say anymore? the
[6:26] virgin and end up, amen, with this great
[6:29] king, the Leo, the lion. Amen. And we
[6:33] realize by the grace of God, amen, has
[6:35] always been about her. The whole boast
[6:38] about Satan ascending above the stars of
[6:41] heaven has always been about God's
[6:44] bride. Is that right? He was always
[6:47] jealous of
[6:48] Micah. And he wanted a greater kingdom
[6:51] than Micah. We know Micah is Christ.
[6:53] Amen. And so we realize by the grace of
[6:56] God, amen, that Satan has always wanted
[6:58] her and he did his best to get her. He
[7:01] did every kind of scheme that he could
[7:03] scheme with. I mean, look what he did.
[7:06] By the grace of God, he locked Rah Rahab
[7:08] up in a wall.
[7:13] He locked Rahab up in a wall and thought
[7:15] she'd never come out of it. Amen. But
[7:18] you know, God always knows how to get
[7:20] his own.
[7:24] So we realize by the grace of God,
[7:26] excuse me, we realize by the grace of
[7:29] God, Amen, that that we're living at a
[7:32] time of a perfect bride. Brother
[7:34] Brandham said it like this. He said, "Of
[7:36] all the ages, brides, brides, brides,
[7:39] brides, they all failed. They all were
[7:41] deceived. They all came into a basically
[7:44] organization, denomination, whatever it
[7:46] is." He said, "But the bride of Jesus
[7:48] Christ will not be deceived." Amen. Oh,
[7:52] thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Amen.
[7:55] And God, we without Christ, without him,
[7:59] we would be deceived.
[8:01] If God had not chosen and elected us, if
[8:03] he had not called us for a purpose,
[8:06] Amen. we would be just like the world.
[8:08] The Bible said, "Had he not left himself
[8:11] a seed, we will all have been like Sodom
[8:13] and Gomorrah." A lot of people don't
[8:14] like me to say that. I don't have to say
[8:16] it. The word does. And the truth of the
[8:18] matter is we have would all have become
[8:21] just that way without God's election
[8:24] with God start God's choosing and and
[8:27] literally placing a seed in us before
[8:28] the foundations of the world. We would
[8:31] not have been any different. But we look
[8:34] at this thing and um I'm coming to Peter
[8:36] in just a moment because I really
[8:37] believe with all my heart these virtues
[8:40] must be crowned in us by divine love.
[8:43] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. It is
[8:46] a journey. Yes. Brother Random tells us
[8:49] character is not given to you. It is a
[8:51] victory. Amen. People of God. And all
[8:53] you have to do, it's not difficult. All
[8:56] you have to do is have the right mental
[8:58] attitude toward the word. Amen. Amen.
[9:02] And brother Brandham said, "God will
[9:03] bring it to pass your right mental
[9:06] attitude toward the word." Amen, Lord.
[9:09] Amen. I don't have to see it with my
[9:11] natural eye. God is not requiring me to
[9:14] see it. He's requiring me to believe it.
[9:17] Amen. Right. Amen. There would be no way
[9:19] if I was in Joshua's them shoes looking
[9:21] at giants. And if you ever looked up in
[9:23] the in the history of of what they have
[9:25] found to be as giants, you would have
[9:28] understood when he said they stood like
[9:29] trees because that's exactly what they
[9:32] did. They did stand like trees. Amen.
[9:36] Hello.
[9:38] But
[9:39] nevertheless, Amen. Joshua and them did
[9:42] not look at the circumstances because
[9:45] had they looked at the physical
[9:47] evidence, amen, they would have said,
[9:49] "No way this could have happened." But
[9:51] they looked beyond that. They were from
[9:54] above. Oh Lord have mercy. So they
[9:57] recognized that the kingdom that was
[10:00] from above was far greater than the
[10:02] kingdom that is below here. And these
[10:05] giants were not of the kingdom of God.
[10:08] Amen. Like like David said, you
[10:11] uncircumcised Philistine.
[10:14] Hello. Yes, sir. And so anyway, to make
[10:16] a long story short, in order for us to
[10:20] continue on in this walk, we must must
[10:24] be like Abraham. Call those things that
[10:28] be not as though they were.
[10:31] That's the only way you've got to call
[10:34] these things that be not. I don't care
[10:36] if your eyes declare it's not there. I
[10:38] don't care if your smell, your taste,
[10:40] your whatever. Declare it not to be
[10:42] there. You must ignore all of that and
[10:46] say God's word says
[10:49] right now. I want you to understand what
[10:52] God is doing even among this message.
[10:54] God is shaking all the kingdoms. He's
[10:57] shaking my life. He's shaking your life
[11:00] right now. He's shaking, shaking,
[11:02] shaking to see whether or not you are
[11:05] movable. Amen. Hallelujah.
[11:09] Hallelujah. Is that all right? Turn with
[11:11] me to Hebrews 12, please.
[11:14] God is shaking to see whether you are
[11:17] movable. I don't know about you, but
[11:19] I've received a kingdom that's
[11:21] unmovable.
[11:23] Hallelujah. And I am in that kingdom.
[11:27] Amen.
[11:30] Now I'm going to read this and I'm going
[11:32] to start basically at the 22nd verse so
[11:35] you can understand who you are. But ye
[11:38] are come unto Mount Zion and unto a city
[11:43] of the living God. Amen. The heavenly
[11:46] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[11:48] of angels. Now, how could he write these
[11:51] to the Hebrews and they're on earth? But
[11:53] you got to recognize, amen, I'm not just
[11:56] on earth. I'm in heavenly places.
[11:59] in Christ Jesus. Hello. You believe
[12:02] that? Amen. We have come into a city of
[12:05] a living God, the un the heavenly
[12:09] Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
[12:11] of angels, to the general assembly and
[12:15] church of the firstborn, which are
[12:18] written in heaven. Are you written in
[12:19] heaven? Amen.
[12:21] I just showed you how you're the
[12:23] offspring, right? Church of the first
[12:26] born. Amen. coming from the the the
[12:29] birth of Jesus himself, right? Because
[12:31] you got to understand that Eve was the
[12:34] first born of Adam.
[12:38] The woman types the church. Amen. Out of
[12:41] him came the church. Out of Jesus came
[12:44] the church. Amen. She type. It has to be
[12:47] the same. Amen.
[12:50] Right. But she fell to the general
[12:52] assembly and church of the firstborn
[12:56] which was written in heaven and to God
[12:59] the judge of all and to the spirit of
[13:01] just men. What? Made
[13:04] perfect. You're made perfect. Just men
[13:08] made perfect. And to Jesus the mediator
[13:11] of the new covenant and to the blood of
[13:14] sprinkling and the speaking of better
[13:16] things than that of Abel. See that you
[13:19] refuse not him that speaketh. For if
[13:23] they escape not who refuse him that
[13:26] speak on earth, speak on earth, much
[13:28] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[13:31] from him that speaketh from heaven.
[13:34] Think about it. Those who refuse to hear
[13:37] Moses, those who refuse to hear Noah,
[13:40] they die. Now look what's happening now.
[13:42] We just didn't have a prophet speaking
[13:44] from the earth, but we had a God who
[13:47] came down visibly. Hallelujah. They want
[13:50] to deny the cloud, but I can't help to
[13:52] know that was my Lord. Amen. He spoke
[13:57] from heaven. Amen.
[14:00] If you deny this,
[14:02] how can you
[14:04] escape? Whose voice then what shook the
[14:08] earth? Did it shake the earth? Amen.
[14:11] When those blast that blast came, he
[14:13] said he thought it was his death. It
[14:15] shook the earth. Amen. But now he had
[14:19] promised saying yet once more I will
[14:22] shake not only the earth only but also
[14:25] heaven. So something is moving. It's
[14:29] going to shake heaven and earth. Amen.
[14:33] Amen.
[14:36] And this word yet once more signify the
[14:40] removing of those things that are shaken
[14:44] as of things that are made that those
[14:46] things which cannot be shaken may
[14:49] remain. So you understand that
[14:52] everything that's being shaken is only
[14:55] to bring you to a place in your life
[14:57] where you could see that you could not
[14:59] be
[15:00] shook. Let's put it this way. in a place
[15:03] where you could not cannot be moved.
[15:06] Hallelujah. Right. Your foundation is
[15:09] built upon a rock.
[15:11] The revelation of Jesus Christ for our
[15:14] day. Amen. Wherefore we receive, we
[15:18] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[15:21] moved. Let us have grace whereby we may
[15:25] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[15:29] godly fear. Why? For our God is a
[15:34] consuming
[15:36] fire. Right. Right. Let us not forget
[15:40] that. Oh, God is love. God is grace. But
[15:42] I tell you one thing, folks, and y'all
[15:44] can say what you want to say, but
[15:45] there's no way I want to re want to
[15:48] experience the fire of God in that
[15:51] way. Not in the way of judgment. Right?
[15:55] I don't mind God coming. not trust. I
[15:57] thank God for his fire coming in and
[15:59] cleaning up the house, but I don't want
[16:01] to experience God's judgment fire that
[16:04] comes to destroy. And this is what I
[16:07] don't understand about message believers
[16:09] is because they fail to see that if it
[16:12] had not been Malachi from Malachi 4, the
[16:15] world would have been destroyed already.
[16:17] Yes, sir. That's true. It was Malachi 4.
[16:20] God used him in the way of grace. Yes.
[16:24] to prepare a people, to bring a people
[16:27] back to repentance so that the judgment
[16:29] of God would be stayed. Amen. But now
[16:32] we're at a place, Amen. It's time for a
[16:35] burning. Amen.
[16:38] Anybody know what I'm talking about. The
[16:40] world is ready for a burning. Yes, sir.
[16:43] And everything that's not worshiping and
[16:45] serving God will burn. Amen.
[16:49] The scripture tells us that even our
[16:51] works will be tried by fire.
[16:54] Is that okay? Now I said the age of a
[16:58] perfect bride because our prophet God
[17:01] through him said she will not be
[17:04] deceived. Amen. Now I want you to
[17:07] understand by the grace of God, you're
[17:09] not being deceived is not because you're
[17:11] so smart. Oh sir. Amen. There's not a
[17:14] man has been born of a woman that was
[17:17] smarter than Lucifer.
[17:20] Y'all hear what I said? I'mma say it
[17:21] again. There's not a man on this earth
[17:25] that's been born of a woman that was
[17:27] smarter than Lucifer.
[17:30] If God had not interfered with our
[17:33] lives, he would have just thrown us
[17:35] around like like a pingpong ball or
[17:38] something. He he he we must understand
[17:42] by the grace of God. Amen. It's God
[17:44] protecting us from baby birth.
[17:49] Yes, sir. Oh, I escaped. How did you
[17:52] escape? Hello, somebody. God caused you
[17:56] to escape. Amen.
[18:00] I'mma tell y'all something. This is
[18:03] uh Arnette. Brother Arnett. He's gone on
[18:05] to be with the Lord. Anybody here knew
[18:07] brother Arnett? He was in a wheelchair.
[18:08] You remember brother Arnet, brother? He
[18:11] was in a wheelchair. He was a real close
[18:12] friend of brother brother um Brandon.
[18:16] But before he got saved, he was a real
[18:19] slinger, a outlaw. He was really a
[18:21] hillbilly. He was he done killed about
[18:23] three or four people. Now I'm talking
[18:25] about he telling me this. He's telling
[18:27] me this. And when he came to the
[18:29] message, he was so when he met Brother
[18:32] Brandham, he's guilt and everything. He
[18:34] says, "Oh, how can I ever be saved? I
[18:37] I've killed these so many people.
[18:39] Brother Brandham looked at him and all
[18:42] of a sudden, Brother Brandham said,
[18:44] "Don't worry about it. They were
[18:46] serpents."
[18:52] Come on now. Anybody?
[18:55] Come on, somebody. In other words, they
[18:56] weren't even savable. They weren't
[18:58] redeemable.
[19:00] That's why God allowed you to kill them.
[19:04] But can you imagine the the burden that
[19:07] rolled from that man's heart?
[19:11] See, this message come to set you free.
[19:15] And where the spirit of the uh of the
[19:17] Lord is, there is liberty. Amen.
[19:23] God never said worry. God said have
[19:25] faith in God. Let's move on by the gra.
[19:28] You're justified as though you ever
[19:30] never sinned in the first place. But if
[19:32] you don't believe it, it's not for you.
[19:35] It's not for you. I believe I'm going to
[19:38] not just believe it. It's just something
[19:40] in me know by the grace of God, I'll be
[19:43] in this rapture.
[19:45] Explain it to me. I cannot explain it.
[19:49] One thing for certain, I know that if I
[19:51] look at my flesh, I'll never see Jesus.
[19:55] You'll never see him.
[20:00] Let me move on. I I've got to say a few
[20:02] things because I want you to realize
[20:04] before when I come to this Peter again,
[20:06] you've got to understand that this mean
[20:08] giving up everything.
[20:12] It means giving up everything. Like I
[20:14] said the other day, I said here was
[20:16] Rahab. Now Rahab had friends. Rahab all
[20:20] the relatives. Rahab
[20:23] had all kinds of reputations. No doubt.
[20:26] But Rahab had to give up everything.
[20:31] Amen. And keep it a secret.
[20:36] All right. She had to keep a secret that
[20:39] God had come down and she helped the men
[20:42] of God and she's going to be safe. The
[20:45] only people she told her secret to was
[20:47] her house. Amen.
[20:50] And these people understand as I said
[20:54] the other day when ra when when when
[20:55] when Jericho collapsed and was destroyed
[20:59] Rahab and then walked out on the ashes.
[21:03] Amen. Amen. Walked out on the ashes. Now
[21:07] what you saying brother affiliations and
[21:10] associates and whatever more that was
[21:13] there in Rahab's life was now dead.
[21:16] Yeah. So there was not one person that
[21:19] could follow her and said, "We remember
[21:21] when
[21:24] Rahab became a family secret." And if
[21:26] you had not known, the only reason why
[21:29] God put it in there because he knew
[21:31] there was going to be some of us who
[21:32] would be Rahabs. Amen. All right. Amen.
[21:35] So we realized by the grace of God, God
[21:38] shook, shook, shook, and brought it down
[21:42] for
[21:43] Rahab and her family. Let me ask you a
[21:47] question. What did Rahab
[21:50] do to
[21:53] deserve God's grace? Nothing. You know
[21:57] what it was?
[21:59] Election. What did you do for your ears
[22:03] to be
[22:04] opened to this
[22:07] message?
[22:08] Nothing. Nothing. God interfered in your
[22:11] life and brought you this. Why? because
[22:14] you were elected. Amen.
[22:19] Right? That's what I love about it. I
[22:21] trust his election.
[22:24] Now, I look at this and I said, "Here
[22:26] was God going down to Moab. He shook
[22:31] Moab. He shook Moab." Amen. To get out
[22:35] Ruth, right? Shook her family, right?
[22:39] Look what God had to do to get her.
[22:43] And yet is still she comes to a place
[22:46] and she says unto her
[22:50] mother-in-law
[22:52] Naomi, "Your God will be my God. Your
[22:56] people will be my What was she doing?
[22:59] I'm not born of this world. I'm born of
[23:02] Moabitis. I've served in the Moabitis
[23:05] temples and whatever more. But in my
[23:08] heart, I'm a true Jew." Amen.
[23:12] And that's the way you must think. I
[23:14] don't care what your background has been
[23:16] and where you come from. What you think
[23:18] the blood of Jesus Christ washed every
[23:21] bit of that away. And you and I must not
[23:23] think as a natural man. We are now sons
[23:27] and daughters of God where there is only
[23:30] one blood. Amen. And that's the blood of
[23:33] Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:37] One blood and that's the blood of Jesus
[23:39] Christ.
[23:40] Tell me what color it
[23:43] is. Y'all understand me? So my point is
[23:46] this. Amen. If that be the case, is that
[23:49] am I right or wrong? Brother Brandham
[23:51] said, "When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[23:52] now I fully understand it." He said,
[23:54] "You receive a blood transfusion." Amen.
[23:58] Amen. Now, I don't understand it, but I
[24:01] believe it. That mean if I've got a
[24:03] blood transfusion, every devil that's in
[24:05] my blood got to go. Amen.
[24:08] Yes, sir.
[24:09] Because this natural blood and my
[24:11] spiritual blood are not compatible. No
[24:13] sir. Amen.
[24:16] So you look at this and we look at this
[24:20] thing and I'm saying these thing because
[24:22] now we go to Simon's house and you see
[24:24] this woman humiliating
[24:27] herself, right? But she's giving all
[24:30] she's
[24:31] got. She's looking at God and she's
[24:34] thinking, "I'm not worthy. Neither was
[24:36] my occupation that I was once in worthy
[24:39] to approach such a holy God. Look at
[24:41] this woman. Look at the versus Simon's
[24:44] uh uh uh uh footwasher or whatever he
[24:48] was flunky. Amen. That came to Jesus and
[24:51] failed to worship
[24:52] him status-wise. He was in a better
[24:54] position than this woman. But here come
[24:57] this woman who is the scum of the earth,
[24:59] right? known for her reputation because
[25:02] as soon as she walked in, they say, "Oh,
[25:03] that's
[25:04] Mary." Amen. Y'all heard my story on
[25:07] that one. But my point is, she's looking
[25:10] at this thing as this is my only
[25:13] opportunity. Amen. I know he's healed
[25:16] some of the other girls.
[25:18] [Music]
[25:20] That's what he said. Brother Bam said
[25:21] she probably heard some of the others
[25:23] talking how God done healed and did this
[25:25] and that and it just built her faith. If
[25:28] he can do it for this one, he can do it
[25:29] for me. Amen. I look at brother Brandham
[25:32] and I say it like this. If God can come
[25:35] and bring him to a matured state, God
[25:37] can bring me to a mature state. Amen.
[25:40] Hallelujah. Someone want to argue the
[25:43] point that he didn't come to a mature
[25:45] state. But I said if he didn't, who how
[25:47] in the world God say to him, whatever
[25:49] you say, that's the scripture.
[25:52] If you say to this mountain, be thy
[25:54] move. Amen. Come on. Amen.
[25:57] Jesus didn't get that at the at the at
[25:59] the river. He got that at the mountain.
[26:03] Y'all hear what I'm saying? So, you look
[26:06] at these things and I don't understand
[26:07] why people say what they say, but I go
[26:09] on with what God has given me. Now, I
[26:11] want you to understand, and we go there
[26:14] in just a moment. Romans uh uh 1
[26:17] Corinthians tells us we are the temple
[26:18] of God. And no, you're not. Let's just
[26:20] turn there quickly. Uh 1 Corinthians
[26:24] 3. Is this okay? Amen. I just want to
[26:27] take my time. I can get excited anytime.
[26:30] I get excited at home. So, listen.
[26:34] Um 1 Corinthians
[26:40] 3 and 16, know ye not that you are the
[26:43] temple of God, and that the spirit of
[26:46] God dwelleth in you? Amen. Now, that's a
[26:49] question mark. And that that's the
[26:51] thing. In the Corinthian church, I guess
[26:53] they did have problems with knowing that
[26:54] God was in
[26:56] them. If any man defile the temple of
[26:58] God, him shall God destroy. For the
[27:02] temple of God is holy, which temple ye
[27:05] are. Now, he's telling them God's temple
[27:08] is holy. Now, you destroy it, you're
[27:11] going to be in trouble.
[27:14] That word destroy said they say it
[27:17] defile mean destroy.
[27:20] Now we look at this thing and say,
[27:22] "Well, brother Brooks, uh, if God is in
[27:24] me, why what's happening?" Let God is
[27:28] not a showoff.
[27:30] Amen. He doesn't put on a show. Amen.
[27:33] Now, we look at all of the things that
[27:35] Jesus did. But remember now, Jesus grew
[27:39] up to be a man of 33, and up to that
[27:41] point, there was only one miracle
[27:44] done. One. And yet, he was still God.
[27:48] One. Because God don't show off. Amen.
[27:50] Y'all hear what I'm saying? What it is
[27:53] is we as a bride, we don't understand
[27:55] when the stage has been completely set
[27:57] for us, you and I going to see things
[27:59] we've never seen before. Amen. But we
[28:02] hold the faith knowing that if God
[28:04] should choose to do something today,
[28:06] right now, he can do it. Amen. Y'all
[28:10] hear what I'm saying? So I look at this
[28:13] thing and you got to realize, amen, that
[28:14] even brother Brandham said that as
[28:16] according to the records, there were
[28:18] more miracles done in his ministry than
[28:21] it was written in the
[28:23] Bible of Jesus. You understand that
[28:26] Jesus did there's only certain min
[28:28] miracles, but he said in his ministry,
[28:31] it wasn't brother Brandham. It was the
[28:32] same Jesus Christ doing what? Hooking
[28:36] the bride. Yes. Amen. This whole thing
[28:40] in this age was all about us. God, Lord,
[28:44] hooking his bride, pulling on her,
[28:47] bringing himself, revealing himself so
[28:49] that she would fall in love with him.
[28:52] Now, let's move on by the grace of God.
[28:54] So, we are the temple of God. Is that
[28:56] all right? We know by the grace of God,
[28:59] we can't just live any kind of way and
[29:02] expect to get get away with it. Come on.
[29:05] Amen. Amen. Listen what he says. Amen.
[29:08] In Romans 12, I beseech you therefore,
[29:11] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[29:13] you present your bodies a living
[29:17] sacrifice. That word sacrifice means
[29:20] what? Is not convenient. That's the way
[29:23] I think about it. When I see a
[29:24] sacrifice, that means I've got five cent
[29:27] and God is requiring
[29:30] seven and I've got two pennies stashed
[29:33] away
[29:34] somewhere. Y y'all understand me? It
[29:37] lit. Now I'm trying to say sacrifices
[29:39] always take you out of your norm.
[29:43] And sometimes sacrifices can hurt. Amen.
[29:46] You spirit. When I say hurt, I mean hurt
[29:50] because you don't want to do it.
[29:53] Lord, I would that this cup pass from
[29:56] me, but nevertheless, not my will. Amen.
[30:01] Thine be done. See, it's not the it's
[30:03] not it's God don't look at the feeling
[30:06] that you don't want to do it. He's
[30:08] looking at whether you gonna do it or
[30:09] not. Amen. That's where the sacrifice
[30:11] comes in. So anyway, we look at this
[30:13] thing and say, "Well, Lord, by your
[30:15] grace, by your grace." So, we're looking
[30:17] at this thing. He said, "Present your
[30:18] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[30:20] acceptable unto God, which is your what?
[30:23] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[30:27] to this world, but be ye transformed by
[30:30] the renewing of your mind, that you may
[30:34] prove what is that good and acceptable
[30:36] and perfect will of God. God is saying
[30:40] this to you
[30:41] tonight. Your mind is what
[30:46] troubles. Hello. Your mind, now I'm not
[30:50] just talking about this. I'm talking
[30:51] about connecting both of them because
[30:53] realize, amen, that what you think about
[30:57] God's word is what God receives from
[31:02] you. You understand me? That's why I say
[31:05] the right mental attitude to bring it to
[31:07] pass. if it's always a amen. But if we
[31:10] get to a place wherein God's word has
[31:14] come to a place that we don't even know
[31:15] whether it works or not Lord especi
[31:19] especially when it comes to healing and
[31:20] things that you know I mean so our
[31:22] thoughts about his word is what he's
[31:25] judging us he said an
[31:28] acceptable that's why we have to hear
[31:31] the word read it study it renewing
[31:35] renewing renewing don't ever forget
[31:38] because The Bible said basically what
[31:41] what Israel if they had only remembered
[31:43] what at all they would have returned
[31:45] back into Egypt spiritually they did it
[31:47] anyway. Amen. Right? They did it anyway.
[31:51] And let me tell you something. If you
[31:52] don't renew your mind with the word of
[31:55] God, you will return whether you like it
[31:58] or not because you dealing with a flesh
[32:00] man and a God man. Like brother Brandham
[32:03] said, it all depends on which dog you
[32:04] feed the most. All right. I know some of
[32:07] y'all Amen. Let's move on by the grace
[32:09] of God. Is that okay? Amen.
[32:15] We look at this thing. Let's turn now to
[32:16] to to second Peter.
[32:20] I'm talking about coming into a perfect
[32:23] position. Never since the fall of man
[32:27] have a perfect bride come forth. Eve was
[32:31] the first and she fell. But there is no
[32:34] other time there were a perfect bride.
[32:38] Jehovah's bride fell. Yes, sir. Brother
[32:41] Bible said Jesus bride failed. Right. It
[32:44] failed because Amen. in Ephesus it was
[32:47] aimed at it was relaxed and boom it
[32:49] fell. It had to fall. But now in this
[32:52] resurrection she comes Amen. with extra
[32:55] strength. Hallelujah. Why? because she
[32:57] now has a full revelation of not only
[33:00] who her Lord is but who she is.
[33:04] The Bible said the revelation was hid
[33:07] from the foundation of the world. Amen.
[33:10] Right? This mystery was hidden. And so
[33:13] therefore there was they didn't know no
[33:15] better. They couldn't do no better than
[33:17] what they were doing. But now in this
[33:19] age where the Bible said God used to
[33:21] wink at ignorance, he does he just
[33:23] doesn't do it anymore. He He now expect
[33:26] us to come up to the mark. Amen. Paul
[33:28] said, "I press. I press." That was a
[33:31] good thing that Paul laid on record
[33:33] because now we find out that we are now
[33:35] in a pressing season. Amen. Y'all
[33:38] believe that? Amen.
[33:41] First Peter,
[33:45] please. We'll begin reading at the at
[33:47] the second
[33:50] verse. I love the Lord. Don't you? Amen.
[33:53] You know, we look at this thing and I
[33:55] I'm telling you, as I I said earlier, we
[33:57] cannot imagine uh uh second Peter, I'm
[34:00] sorry. We have no idea what God is doing
[34:03] for
[34:05] us. We read some of this this morning,
[34:08] but let me just start all over. Starting
[34:10] with add to the fifth verse. And beside
[34:14] this, giving all diligence add to your
[34:15] faith virtue, and to virtue
[34:18] knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance,
[34:21] and to temperance patience, and to
[34:23] patient godliness. Now, you're no
[34:26] stronger than your faith in the word.
[34:29] Now, faith, right, you don't have faith
[34:32] until something has been quickened in
[34:34] you, right? In other words, when that
[34:37] life comes in, I'm talking about godly
[34:39] faith. When when your that germ of life
[34:41] has been quickened in you by faith you
[34:44] are saved. Amen. By grace right through
[34:46] faith you are saved. Now that life has
[34:49] been quickened right and you supposed to
[34:52] feed on this word. In other words the
[34:55] word is supposed to become the amen.
[34:58] Whatever you read amen. Whatever you
[35:00] read amen so be it. Amen. That's your
[35:04] virtue. God said so. And that's what God
[35:07] tried to tell through Abraham. Oh,
[35:09] Abraham, it's been a long time and and
[35:11] you we don't see no baby. How you know
[35:12] you're going to have it? He said, God
[35:14] said so. That was his virtue. Holding
[35:16] fast
[35:18] on the promises of God. That was his
[35:21] strength. No matter
[35:23] what circumstances put before his eyes,
[35:27] he strongly believed. That's the Bible
[35:30] said. And he never staggered, Amen. at
[35:34] the promises. And because of that, God
[35:38] rewarded him. Y'all hear what I'm
[35:40] saying? So, we find out, amen, that
[35:42] virtue is standing right there on the
[35:45] word. And what gives you extra strength
[35:47] is when you come to learn of me. I love
[35:50] this. I I meant to bring this forth this
[35:52] morning. Amen. About the yoke. He said,
[35:54] "My yoke is easy and my burden is
[35:57] light." Hallelujah. Amen. So, when God
[35:59] yoke you up, Amen. He's the strong one.
[36:02] Hallelujah. And you're just going with
[36:04] him, right? Because you're compatible.
[36:07] Amen. Two horses together, not a horsey
[36:09] and a donkey. Amen.
[36:13] He's yoking you
[36:15] up. My yoke is easy and my burden is
[36:19] light. Think about it. So he yolks us
[36:22] up. Amen. In this gospel. Amen. And
[36:24] we're we're pulling this thing together.
[36:26] But guess what? He's the one that with
[36:28] all the strength, right? Amen. Amen.
[36:31] It's so true. Amen. And I thought about
[36:34] that. I thought, Lord, I I forgot to
[36:35] really say that because Amen. when you
[36:38] think about a yoke, you know, uh any any
[36:41] farmer, any man who who who who who work
[36:44] with horses and stuff knows that you you
[36:46] you you put the right horse in the right
[36:49] place in order to to to plow or to win a
[36:52] race or whatever the case may be. Let's
[36:54] move on. So, we find out, amen, that God
[36:57] comes along and he says to your
[36:59] knowledge as temperance and to
[37:01] temperance patience. You know, there's
[37:02] only just
[37:04] a a a little variation in there because
[37:07] listen, G, Brother B said, Jesus Christ
[37:10] had
[37:11] undisturbed
[37:13] faith. That's why the prophet of God had
[37:16] to come to bring a message that would
[37:18] bring a balance. It would bring
[37:19] temperance. It would bring something to
[37:21] us that we wouldn't be too far on this
[37:23] side or too far on the other side, but
[37:26] we'll be right here. Amen. Now, let me
[37:29] put it this way.
[37:31] Temperance will be tried.
[37:34] Faith is tried. But when God is on the
[37:37] inside, you know, you sit back almost
[37:40] watching yourself. Now, I know the way I
[37:41] used to be. I would be so upset right
[37:44] now. And I'm just marveling because this
[37:47] guy's
[37:48] cool. Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[37:51] He's not aggravated. He's not He's not
[37:53] boiling over. And I'm looking, that's
[37:56] me. Uh-uh. That's the Christ in me.
[37:58] Amen. Right. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[38:01] Every time that when that temperance is
[38:03] being tried and you see yourself, oh my,
[38:06] God done something here because I
[38:08] remember the time, right? And patience,
[38:12] woo, patience is tried on a daily basis.
[38:16] Anybody can witness to me. Amen.
[38:20] Something's going to come and try your
[38:22] patience. And don't be one, Amen. that
[38:26] likes to be on time.
[38:33] I mean, that's the
[38:37] truth. He going to try
[38:40] it. But it's a good trial because when
[38:44] you find yourself not getting upset, you
[38:45] say, "Oh, thank you, Jesus. I know
[38:47] that's you." Right? You can smile and go
[38:50] on and enjoy Jesus anyhow. Cuz y'all
[38:53] don't understand. Let me Some of y'all
[38:54] do, but my tell you something. Satan
[38:56] would try me like every Sunday. It had
[39:00] to be something going on. Sometime it
[39:02] was my own
[39:03] fault. All right. But nevertheless, it
[39:06] happens.
[39:08] Amen. But the whole point behind it, we
[39:10] ought to sit back and say, "Okay, now
[39:12] I'm out of control on this one. I
[39:14] can't." So what is God is doing? You
[39:17] know what I mean? What is God is doing?
[39:19] Get me in a place where everything is
[39:22] godly, unshakable,
[39:24] right? unmovable. Amen. It's not gonna
[39:27] change my atmosphere. Oh Lord.
[39:32] Hey, I'm gonna keep that heavenly
[39:33] atmosphere.
[39:35] Amen. Come on, somebody.
[39:39] Amen. Y'all, anybody know what I'm
[39:41] talking about? Amen. Oh, so we go on
[39:44] with this. And patience, that's where it
[39:46] brings that godliness now, right?
[39:49] Because you're not even human now cuz
[39:51] you're not even getting upset and
[39:52] fussing and caring on. So all they could
[39:54] see is godliness in you. Something's
[39:56] different about that individual. I just
[39:58] can't get him upset for nothing. Why?
[40:02] Cuz that God in there holding him
[40:04] putting that flesh in check. You ain't
[40:06] going nowhere, you old m,
[40:10] right? That's what God doing. He holding
[40:13] holding him in check. He won't allow him
[40:15] to get upset.
[40:18] And all along that man on the inside is
[40:20] rejoicing.
[40:22] It's not I that live but
[40:25] Christ. Hallelujah. Come on. That's the
[40:29] way it is, people. That's the way it is.
[40:32] And then when you got godliness, guess
[40:34] what happens? You can be kind to your
[40:35] brother.
[40:37] Amen. You been tried all up and you got
[40:40] to realize like the prophet of God said,
[40:42] he didn't mean to do it. She didn't mean
[40:45] to do it. The devil made him do it.
[40:48] That's the adversary. Come on, somebody.
[40:51] That's the adversary. Now you can love
[40:53] your brother ES and sister even as they
[40:56] are. Ah, amen. Just typing, just showing
[41:00] you. Amen. Little things that we go and
[41:02] the whole time we don't even realize
[41:04] that God is trying to build your
[41:06] character with those little things in
[41:08] your life that's going on. He's trying
[41:10] to build your character to bring you
[41:12] under complete control of the Holy
[41:14] Ghost.
[41:17] And when he can get you to the place
[41:19] where you're not sounding like a
[41:22] sirene, he got you now. He can seal you
[41:26] up now because you can really love your
[41:29] brethren, your sister. No matter what
[41:31] the devil calls him to do, you can still
[41:34] be under godly control.
[41:38] [Music]
[41:41] Come on. And you think he going to use
[41:43] somebody that ain't going to be able to
[41:44] mess with you, but uh-uh, he's coming
[41:46] close to the door, right? He's coming
[41:48] right in your house. He's going to use
[41:50] children, wife, wherever it takes. He
[41:54] knows what can get next to you, and
[41:56] that's what he's going to use. You know
[41:57] what brother Brandham said, and I never
[41:59] heard him say it before, but it was on
[42:01] the tape, so you know he said it before.
[42:03] Amen. He said Jesus weakness was
[42:07] hunger. Jesus did not like to be hungry.
[42:13] That's why the devil could offer him the
[42:17] bread. See, God can't the devil can't
[42:20] tempt you in nothing that's not a
[42:22] weakness or somewhere some place in your
[42:24] area your life you don't
[42:27] like. He comes in the place where you
[42:30] know you you have a trial
[42:32] with. That's what he comes with. And
[42:35] that's where he tempts you. That's where
[42:36] he comes at. And that's Listen, can you
[42:39] imagine a hundred
[42:41] 40 days not eaten. Can you imagine what
[42:44] bread would have looked like? Can you
[42:46] imagine what bread would have smelled
[42:48] like? And let me tell you something. Do
[42:50] you think the devil wasn't fanning the
[42:52] aroma in his nose?
[42:55] Y'all know what I'm saying? Temptation
[42:57] comes with
[42:59] flavors. All the experience that you
[43:02] ever have had with bread was right
[43:04] there. That's the truth.
[43:08] It's almost like a man in the desert.
[43:10] Amen. He wants water. The mirage
[43:13] comes. Everything is real to him. Don't
[43:15] you think he didn't fail, Lord? Yeah.
[43:18] I'm telling you, that rock looked like
[43:20] bread. I know it
[43:21] did. It had to to be a
[43:25] temptation. Y'all know what I'm saying?
[43:28] And yet he pulls himself together and
[43:32] says, "Man does not live by bread alone.
[43:37] Hallelujah. But what was he showing? He
[43:40] was showing us because Jesus was now
[43:44] full of the Holy Ghost. And it was the
[43:47] Holy Ghost that spoke out of him. Man
[43:51] does not live by bread alone, but by
[43:53] every word that proceedth out of the
[43:55] mouth of God. Y'all hear what I'm
[43:57] saying? That was the Holy Ghost coming
[43:59] out of him, speaking on his behalf. Come
[44:02] on, somebody. It's the truth.
[44:04] And until we can get to a place where we
[44:07] can so yield to God that we give God
[44:09] space to speak before we speak, we'll be
[44:13] in better shape. Amen. Right. Right. So
[44:17] look at this. Let's move on by the grace
[44:18] of God. So we're coming up to this godly
[44:21] brotherly kindness. Brotherly kindness
[44:22] then what?
[44:25] Charity. And then God comes and he
[44:28] brings somebody in your life that's just
[44:31] absolutely unlovable.
[44:36] purposely he brings the
[44:38] unlovable in your life and say love him.
[44:45] But think about it. If that be the
[44:47] case, you're just one step from
[44:50] perfection.
[44:54] Hallelujah. You're right there. Amen.
[44:58] And when you can love that unlovable in
[45:00] a place where you can say, "I lay down
[45:02] my life
[45:04] in that while you were yet sinners,
[45:06] Christ died for you." You got to come
[45:08] there. You got to come to that place
[45:11] where you would lay down your life for
[45:13] that person who's unlovable. No matter
[45:15] how good you are to them, they're wicked
[45:17] to you. Know anybody know anybody like
[45:20] that? Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[45:22] He purposely bring that certain person
[45:24] that knows how to
[45:26] push your
[45:33] buttons. And you know what? Somehow you
[45:35] can't even escape from it.
[45:38] Hallelujah. Is that the truth? Amen. You
[45:41] got to
[45:41] realize when Jesus come to a place and
[45:45] Judas come to kiss him and he knew what
[45:47] Judas was, that was loving the unlovable
[45:49] in that sense. He came to love Judas.
[45:52] That was a victory. A lot of people
[45:54] don't realize that was a true victory to
[45:56] know this man is going to betray me.
[45:59] He's right in the act. I still call him
[46:02] what? Friend.
[46:04] And he was not playing the role of
[46:06] hypocrisy. He meant it. You're my
[46:09] friend. Even though you're going to
[46:10] betray me. God have mercy. But that's
[46:15] the love of God. That's perfection. H
[46:19] how many times brother Brandham went he
[46:21] said they tell me they love me he said
[46:24] and I know better they forget I the
[46:27] discernment is there right but he loved
[46:30] him anyway he never spoke evil of him
[46:32] even though he knew they didn't love him
[46:35] what was that training that was coming
[46:38] into
[46:39] perfection so don't be surprised when
[46:42] these devils raise up in your life
[46:44] that's your victory that's your Goliath
[46:46] hallelujah amen that's your overcoming.
[46:50] Amen. Not to fight back with the natural
[46:52] sword. Amen. Amen. But to conquer with
[46:56] love. Amen. And whether that person ever
[46:58] come to Christ or not, that's between
[47:00] them and God. But you overcome them with
[47:03] the love of God. Amen. When they do
[47:06] evil, you do good.
[47:09] It ain't making sense. Amen. Because
[47:12] it's about
[47:13] you overcoming.
[47:16] you overcome it. Is that okay? Let's
[47:20] move on. I I'm not going to finish this
[47:21] tonight, but let me go to uh let's go to
[47:24] uh uh Revelations 18,
[47:29] please. I I got to just touch on that
[47:31] because there's no way I can go in the
[47:33] depths of all of those things. You know,
[47:34] when you talk about these virtues and
[47:36] all adding to this and adding to this
[47:38] and adding to this, the best way I can
[47:39] tell you is to go listen to Statue of a
[47:41] Perfect Man, right? Then take that and
[47:44] personalize it, right? Bring it to a
[47:47] place. Okay, here I am. Where am I? A am
[47:49] I on on this mountain climb.
[47:53] Amen. Because that's what it is. Give me
[47:55] my mountain. Like I said this morning,
[47:57] where are you on this mountain climb,
[48:00] right? Because you belong to the at the
[48:02] top. Amen. Amen. You belong at the top.
[48:07] So let's let's let's look at this thing
[48:09] and say, "Okay, God, here I am. I know I
[48:12] can't add to me, but show me how I must
[48:16] surrender to you in order for you to
[48:18] take me higher. Cuz that's all it is.
[48:21] It's just vainly surrendering, right?
[48:24] Revelation 18. Everybody being blessed
[48:27] this this evening. Uh why? Because now
[48:30] now I I'm I'm like I said, I'm taking my
[48:32] time and I I I want to say by the grace
[48:34] of
[48:35] God, this is the age of perfection.
[48:39] Solomon said, "I don't want a little
[48:42] girl." In the Songs of Solomon, y'all
[48:45] remember, he said, "I don't want a
[48:46] little girl. I want a a a virgin that's
[48:51] mature."
[48:52] Y'all read Solomon. Y'all know what I'm
[48:54] talking about? Amen. He said, "I want a
[48:56] mature wife. I don't want some little
[48:58] girl." Amen. Christ is not looking for a
[49:00] little girl.
[49:02] He's looking for a matured woman. Amen.
[49:05] A right. Amen. Amen. I I was I've heard
[49:08] a sister when I was in Florida almost
[49:10] say that Christianity is boring. It
[49:12] ain't never boring. I said a Proverbs 31
[49:15] wife will find something to do for God.
[49:19] Amen. Come on, somebody. She'll find
[49:22] something to do. If there is nothing to
[49:24] do, she'll find something to do for God.
[49:27] Romans 18,
[49:30] uh Revelation, I'm sorry. And starting
[49:32] at the
[49:33] uh let's just go and start at the first
[49:36] verse. And after these things, I saw
[49:38] another angel come down from heaven,
[49:40] having great power, and the earth was
[49:42] lightened with his glory. And he cried
[49:44] mightily with a strong voice, saying,
[49:47] Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,
[49:49] and has become habitation of devils, and
[49:52] the whole of every foul spirit, and a
[49:55] cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
[49:57] Now this is going to sound quite
[49:58] alarming to you but brother Brandham
[50:00] said in this day there will
[50:03] be what was called Christianity he
[50:06] basically said will be a religion
[50:08] without salvation.
[50:13] Hello a religion. And that's what we're
[50:15] looking at. See what what what brought
[50:17] you out of the system or brought you out
[50:19] of the street was election. Yes sir.
[50:22] Because you and I was dwelling in a
[50:24] place or religion or faith. Amen. that
[50:27] that there was no salvation. Why?
[50:30] Because brother Brandham said they think
[50:31] they're under the blood. They're not
[50:34] under the
[50:35] blood. Hello, somebody. And they sing
[50:38] all these songs about the blood, but
[50:39] they're not under the blood because they
[50:41] rejected the atonement. Yes. Amen.
[50:45] I know that's harsh. That's really hard
[50:47] to say. But let me tell you something.
[50:48] The only thing that brings them out is
[50:50] election.
[50:52] All that fine choir and music and
[50:54] everything, they singing about Jesus. Am
[50:56] I wrong or right? Is the bird right or
[50:58] wrong? Brother Brown said in the preview
[51:00] of the church, he saw them going where?
[51:02] Down. Going back to where they came
[51:05] from. Oh, come on, somebody.
[51:08] Huh? Going back to where they came from.
[51:12] And that little bride came from God. She
[51:14] was stepping higher. Amen. Right. So,
[51:16] you got to realize by the grace of God
[51:19] all of that and no salvation.
[51:24] That is so
[51:26] scary. It is so alarming. And I probably
[51:29] would people would want to stone me for
[51:31] saying it, but it's true.
[51:33] Anyhow, right? There was only those who
[51:36] had the blood applied in Egypt that was
[51:39] saved. It didn't matter how much
[51:42] religion they had. Abraham was my
[51:44] father. God didn't care about that. He
[51:46] only looked at the blood. When I see the
[51:48] blood, I will pass over you. Amen.
[51:51] Right? And think about it. the foolish
[51:54] version. Amen. The only reason why she
[51:56] goes through is because of what?
[52:01] Election. So these people claiming they
[52:04] know Jesus and they don't. Paul said
[52:07] it's a different
[52:09] Jesus. Folks, it is. We We worship. We
[52:13] talk about it, but don't don't think
[52:15] that they're worshiping the same Jesus.
[52:17] They're not. You can only worship this
[52:19] Jesus by this message.
[52:22] The revelation of the true Jesus Christ
[52:24] came through Malachi 4.
[52:28] We working with election. Amen.
[52:32] And whether amen they ever come to know
[52:34] the truth, that's between them and God.
[52:37] But one thing for certain, they could
[52:39] amen. If you can't amen all the word,
[52:48] let's put it this way so you can
[52:50] understand me. It's just a little
[52:51] portion they missing because they failed
[52:53] to see that the grace was under the
[52:55] prophet. He was the key. He was the key
[52:59] to our age. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[53:01] He was the key. And everybody that comes
[53:03] under his ministry, they're the ones
[53:05] that make it in. Amen. Moses, Noah, you
[53:09] name it. You see what I'm saying? As
[53:11] long as they stayed with under the
[53:12] ministry, they made it. Amen. Right. The
[53:16] key of our age, amen, is where Jesus
[53:19] moved on because the they rejected them
[53:22] in in in the denomination. Amen. And so
[53:25] therefore, God comes along. There's
[53:26] another voice. Come out of her, my
[53:28] people. Be partake. Be not partakers of
[53:31] her sins and her plagues. Why? God was
[53:34] providing a way of
[53:36] escape. A third exodus for who? The
[53:39] bride of Jesus Christ. Sad to say that
[53:42] there's so many people who went to sleep
[53:44] thinking that they were Christians and
[53:46] saved and they were
[53:51] not. For all nations have drunk of the
[53:54] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[53:56] the kings of the earth have committed
[53:58] fornication with her and the merchants
[54:00] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[54:03] abundancy of her delicacy. You know,
[54:05] brother Brandham say, "Dare a man to
[54:08] come before God as a
[54:11] trinitarian." Look it
[54:15] up. That's nothing but the
[54:17] truth. Because that's
[54:22] idolatry. Help us, Lord. I know I'm
[54:25] saying some tough things, but it's just
[54:27] to get us right. You know what I mean?
[54:29] get us focused on who we are because I'm
[54:31] going to show you something in just a
[54:32] little bit, a scripture that I'll jump.
[54:34] I might not finish tonight, but I want
[54:37] to show this before I leave. And another
[54:39] and I I heard another voice from heaven
[54:41] saying, "Come out of her, my people,
[54:43] that you be not partakers of her sin,
[54:45] that ye receive not of her plagues."
[54:47] What do you think? What was the plague?
[54:49] Death. Death was the plague. The fourth
[54:52] the the horse the fourth horse rider
[54:55] riding was death. He said, "If you stay
[54:58] there, you will receive her plague."
[55:04] You see what God has done for us? Oh my
[55:06] God, people. He It's just beyond It's
[55:08] beyond anything. There's no way we can
[55:10] repay him for what he's done. The death
[55:13] angel can't get you there. Get you here.
[55:16] Amen. Because if if he's plagued, the
[55:19] system is plagued. See, that's the only
[55:21] way he can get you. But if you under the
[55:23] bloody bleeding word of this message,
[55:25] you're in a safe place. Hallelujah. I'll
[55:28] pass you. He said, is that all right?
[55:31] Amen. Turn with me to Revelations 21.
[55:34] I've got to jump
[55:37] here. I don't know what time it is, but
[55:40] Revelations
[55:44] 21:9-11. We done we didn't read this
[55:46] before. And there came unto me one of
[55:49] the seven angels uh which had the seven
[55:51] vows full of seven last plagues and
[55:54] talked with me saying come hi that I
[55:56] will show thee the bride the lamb's
[55:58] wife. Now look what God is doing. He's
[56:01] literally showing us by way of
[56:04] preview the results of us believing this
[56:07] message. And he carried me away in the
[56:10] spirit to a great and high mountain, and
[56:13] showed me that the great city, the holy
[56:16] Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from
[56:18] God, having the glory of God, and her
[56:23] light was like unto a stone most
[56:26] precious, even like a jasper stone,
[56:30] clear as crystal. Amen. So, we're in a
[56:34] place by the grace of God that God comes
[56:37] right around and show us. Folks, let me
[56:39] say it like this. It's all ordained of
[56:41] God. Amen.
[56:44] I I I wanted to show you. Listen, here
[56:47] come God. I I I share that later. I'll
[56:50] share it later. But my my point is this.
[56:53] God comes and he shows us that we are to
[56:56] receive what the glory of God. And you
[57:00] know what God said one time? I'll share
[57:03] my glory with no man.
[57:06] See, but he's not sharing it with some
[57:08] other man. Oh, God. Hallelujah.
[57:11] Hallelujah. He's not sharing it with
[57:13] some other man. He's sharing it with the
[57:16] part that was with him before the
[57:17] foundation of the world.
[57:20] Join with Christ.
[57:25] Oh, like they say, not just hes you get
[57:28] a little piece of something. Join as you
[57:31] get
[57:31] all everything he's got. You got
[57:37] 5050. Yeah. Amen. One more scripture and
[57:39] I'll let you go cuz I I I I'll finish up
[57:41] later. Uh Wednesday, Lord, as well.
[57:44] Revelations 22:17,
[57:50] please. I can't stop now. Just one more
[57:53] one more. I've got a few one more thing,
[57:56] a few more things to share. Amen. In
[57:57] Revelations
[58:02] 22:17, it says, "And the spirit and the
[58:06] bride say,
[58:09] "Come." That's your ministry. When you
[58:12] come so connected with God, you go and
[58:16] you say,
[58:17] "Come." You say, "Come." You're now
[58:19] you're now connected where God is can
[58:21] use you to bring that last. Amen. that
[58:25] last and let him that hearay come and
[58:28] let him that is a thirst come and
[58:30] whosoever will that's with the bride
[58:32] have a ministry right now when God fills
[58:36] himself with you that commission go ye
[58:39] therefore into all the world is still
[58:42] there
[58:44] hey somebody and let him that is a
[58:46] thirst come and whosoever will let him
[58:49] take the waters of life freely
[58:54] come on Somebody. So when you see those
[58:56] devil preachers, and I'm going to say
[58:58] it, when you see those devil preachers
[59:00] say, "Come on, get up in here in this
[59:01] $100 line. Anybody got a $50 line?" Come
[59:05] on. The Bible said it's free. How come
[59:08] you going to charge for it?
[59:11] That's another Judas with the bag.
[59:15] Right. Amen. People don't even see,
[59:18] Amen. that these preachers, there'll be
[59:20] more preachers probably in hell than
[59:22] there would be regular people.
[59:33] Let me read this quote from the token.
[59:40] He said the new testament is new
[59:41] covenant, new life. Shows Jesus has met
[59:44] every requirement for us that God
[59:46] required to make us back truly sons and
[59:50] daughters of God under the blood where
[59:52] there is no more condemnation. Amen.
[59:55] Romans 8:1 says, "There is therefore now
[59:57] no condemnation to them that are in, not
[1:00:00] those who are believing it." Those who
[1:00:03] are in Christ Jesus that walk not after
[1:00:06] the flesh, but after the spirit. And my
[1:00:09] word is spirit and life. See? Oh, he
[1:00:12] said, could you could I take a text from
[1:00:14] that and stay about a couple of more
[1:00:16] hours, but we'll hurry over it. You see,
[1:00:19] no more condemnation. Free from sin.
[1:00:23] Free from the cares of the world. No
[1:00:25] condemnation. Now, you hear what I'm
[1:00:28] saying? How come we let Satan beat us up
[1:00:31] so bad? If the spirit of God is in us,
[1:00:34] the Bible say there is now no
[1:00:36] condemnation. Now, I I'm just going to
[1:00:38] take it. I I'm going to take it. I can't
[1:00:40] understand it, but I'm going to take it.
[1:00:42] I ain't going to let the devil condemn
[1:00:43] me no more. Amen. Right. No
[1:00:47] condemnation. Those who walk not after
[1:00:49] the flesh, but in the spirit.
[1:00:52] Hallelujah. And if you got the Holy
[1:00:54] Ghost, you got the spirit.
[1:00:57] But you know what we do? Come on. Is
[1:00:59] that Does it make sense? Let me bring it
[1:01:01] clearly to you. Brother Brandham said
[1:01:03] that blood was on the doorpost and the
[1:01:05] linen and those people were still the
[1:01:06] same but they were saved. They were not
[1:01:09] condemned.
[1:01:12] It was the blood that protected them. Oh
[1:01:15] Lord have mercy people. But they weren't
[1:01:18] condemned in
[1:01:20] themselves. They were so happy they were
[1:01:22] under the blood.
[1:01:25] Amen. Hey somebody. They were under the
[1:01:28] blood. They knew they were under the
[1:01:30] blood. They were safe from the death
[1:01:31] angel. Amen.
[1:01:34] And it works in type the same way it
[1:01:37] works is reality. You're under the
[1:01:39] blood. The Bible said no condemnation.
[1:01:41] Amen. You can't work for God being
[1:01:44] condemned all the time. Amen. Oh wo is
[1:01:48] me. Look at me. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:01:51] saying? Now the blood has done it or no.
[1:01:55] You got to take your mental attitude
[1:01:57] toward the word.
[1:02:00] Not your feeling, your word. The word.
[1:02:02] Right. Right. He says, listen. He said,
[1:02:05] no condemnation. Why? To them that have
[1:02:07] been been by one spirit baptized into
[1:02:10] one body, there the body of of the lamb
[1:02:14] has been
[1:02:16] applied. Let me share this with you so
[1:02:18] you can understand what I'm talking
[1:02:19] about. Some of y'all or some of us, now
[1:02:22] I say us cuz I got rhythm. I got my
[1:02:25] emotions will cause my feet, my toes,
[1:02:27] and everything else to move even when I
[1:02:29] don't want it to move. But there are
[1:02:30] some of you that's not me made like
[1:02:33] that. There's some of you that don't
[1:02:35] don't have rhythm. Even though you got
[1:02:37] you can hear the beat, you can't catch
[1:02:38] up with it.
[1:02:42] But let me ask you a question. Because I
[1:02:43] got rhythm and I can shout or dance to
[1:02:46] the rhythm and you can't, does it mean I
[1:02:47] got the Holy Ghost and you don't? See?
[1:02:50] See how simple that is? Some of you
[1:02:52] might not be able to move like I can
[1:02:54] move, but does that mean you don't have
[1:02:56] it? Okay, I'm glad you said that. So,
[1:02:59] don't make the let the devil make you
[1:03:01] think that sometime when I'm preaching,
[1:03:02] I'm saying you got to jump and shout
[1:03:04] like me. What I'm saying is what'sever
[1:03:06] in you, give it to him. Amen. You don't
[1:03:09] have to be on the beat. You You know
[1:03:11] what I'm saying? There's offbeats and on
[1:03:13] beats.
[1:03:19] That was fresh.
[1:03:21] But my point is just do what God wants
[1:03:24] you to do.
[1:03:28] Oh, brother Troy, don't mind me saying
[1:03:30] that. Like I
[1:03:32] think we were over in South Africa and I
[1:03:36] mean that that's the most I ever seen
[1:03:38] Troy
[1:03:40] move. But he was he was one of the
[1:03:42] offbeats. Okay. Amen. But the point is
[1:03:45] he was so glad it wasn't filmed cuz he
[1:03:47] was right in front of the camera but it
[1:03:49] didn't come out or something. And I
[1:03:50] forgot how it work. But he was so glad
[1:03:52] that went on
[1:03:54] video. But you know, my point is he was
[1:03:57] worshiping
[1:04:00] and that's all God wanted.
[1:04:02] You know what I mean? He was worshiping.
[1:04:04] God don't care which I don't care if you
[1:04:06] just doing this and that's all you got.
[1:04:08] God doesn't care you worshiping him.
[1:04:10] Amen. Right. Sometime people just weep.
[1:04:14] They just weep, you know. Amen. And it's
[1:04:17] okay. uh uh is however God gives it to
[1:04:21] you. That's the way. And you don't copy
[1:04:23] somebody else. Be yourself. Amen.
[1:04:28] All I'm trying to pull out of you is
[1:04:30] your best to give to God. Y'all hear
[1:04:33] what I'm saying? Oh, come on,
[1:04:36] somebody. Does that make you feel
[1:04:38] better?
[1:04:40] Amen. So, you his life is in you and you
[1:04:44] are you are sons and daughters. Let me
[1:04:47] move. I'm sorry. No more condemnation.
[1:04:49] Why? To them that have been born been by
[1:04:51] one spirit baptized into the body there
[1:04:53] is no there there the blood of the lamb
[1:04:55] has been applied. The God of heaven has
[1:04:59] accepted
[1:05:00] you. How come? Because you got the Holy
[1:05:03] Ghost. All right. Brother B said when
[1:05:05] God gives you the Holy Ghost, that's his
[1:05:08] accepting you, not you accepting him.
[1:05:14] Amen. That's him. You see what I'm
[1:05:17] saying? Because what happens is God has
[1:05:20] to know that you're willing to give it
[1:05:21] up. All all of it. That's when he
[1:05:24] accepts you. If a speck of the
[1:05:28] world, that's your prophet. The speck of
[1:05:31] the world is in you. He said, "The love
[1:05:32] of God is
[1:05:35] not." Right? So, he has to he's looking
[1:05:38] and y'all heard me say this before. He
[1:05:41] took his disciples and he broke up their
[1:05:43] homes, if I can say it like this. In
[1:05:44] other words, he took them off their
[1:05:46] jobs. He took them out wherever they
[1:05:48] were. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me.
[1:05:50] Follow me. He made them, I put it this
[1:05:52] way, didn't give them a choice in that
[1:05:54] sense because something pulled them on.
[1:05:57] Right. But that time they surrendered
[1:06:00] everything. You say they did. Yes, they
[1:06:03] did. Amen. And I say because one of the
[1:06:06] disciples says, "Lord, we've left
[1:06:10] everything to follow you." And Jesus
[1:06:13] required that from every believer.
[1:06:17] Everything must be left
[1:06:19] behind.
[1:06:21] Everything must be left behind in order
[1:06:24] to follow
[1:06:26] Christ. So we are accepted in the
[1:06:28] beloved. That's according to uh Romans
[1:06:31] 8:12, Ephesians 1:6, right? His life,
[1:06:35] his life in you. And you are sons and
[1:06:38] daughters of God. Your character is
[1:06:40] what? God's character.
[1:06:43] Back to Peter. Amen. Back to second
[1:06:46] Peter. Your character. Here it is. My
[1:06:49] soul, my nature. Here it is on paper.
[1:06:52] This is what I'm like. This is who I am.
[1:06:54] This must be in you in order for the
[1:06:56] gates to open for you. Amen.
[1:07:02] You say, "I don't have it." Bible said,
[1:07:04] "You have not because you ask not." Your
[1:07:06] character is God's character. What is
[1:07:08] it? A little pushover? Hm. No sir. God
[1:07:12] is a God of judgment. He is a God of
[1:07:15] correct. He must be online. Nothing else
[1:07:18] would do. That's the kind of character
[1:07:20] you are because you're the character of
[1:07:22] your father.
[1:07:24] See, I'm going to leave it there.
[1:07:27] There's other things I wanted to bring
[1:07:29] forth, but that's all right. God will
[1:07:31] give it grace on on on on Wednesday,
[1:07:34] Lord's willing. My point is this is the
[1:07:36] age of a perfect bride. He's not going
[1:07:38] to accept anything less than that. All
[1:07:41] right. We've got the tools. We've got
[1:07:43] everything we need. We got more. The
[1:07:45] Bible said, "Minister unto you
[1:07:48] abundantly." So, we got more than we
[1:07:50] need to get there. Amen. Right. We just
[1:07:53] got to stop all of the the distractions,
[1:07:57] right? We got to refocus. Refocus and
[1:08:00] say, "God, I know I'm bride. Let Let me
[1:08:03] say it like this. The time is so short.
[1:08:06] I I believe that. Amen. I believe that.
[1:08:08] Let me ask you a question. Have you ever
[1:08:10] had you rushing and all of a sudden the
[1:08:12] phone rang and you think, "Well, I got
[1:08:14] to be somewhere somewhere." And you have
[1:08:16] to make a choice between answering that
[1:08:18] phone that's going to hold you up or go
[1:08:20] out the door. And then the devil said,
[1:08:22] "But that must be an
[1:08:25] emergency." I mean, you know, and then
[1:08:27] you find out it's not an emergency, but
[1:08:29] now this call has made you late. See, it
[1:08:32] always that way. Satan always bring
[1:08:34] forth distractions so that he can make
[1:08:36] you late. Late for what? This coming
[1:08:39] rapture. If you late for the rapture,
[1:08:41] you miss it.
[1:08:45] He brings these things in our lives.
[1:08:47] Amen. To make us feel like it's more
[1:08:49] important to do this the right the thing
[1:08:51] that God has put on your heart than this
[1:08:53] over
[1:08:54] here. Nothing is more important right
[1:08:57] now.
[1:09:01] Let let me let me and I'm
[1:09:04] closing. Preaching is not as important
[1:09:08] to
[1:09:08] me as my
[1:09:12] perfection. Singing, coming to church,
[1:09:16] that's those things are important, but
[1:09:18] the focus is now not on church, not on
[1:09:22] preaching. A lot of preachers won't make
[1:09:24] it because they they they've found more
[1:09:26] time to preach than they did to pray.
[1:09:29] See, and my point is all these things
[1:09:32] are going to come to north.
[1:09:36] There won't be no altar call in heaven.
[1:09:38] Amen. Everything I'm doing is for the
[1:09:41] kingdom. And once it's done, it's done.
[1:09:43] My important thing, the important thing
[1:09:45] for you and me is this. Christ's
[1:09:47] character in us. Amen. The virtues of
[1:09:49] God, brother said, without it won't open
[1:09:51] the door. Amen. You'll miss the mark.
[1:09:54] And you don't hear preachers preaching
[1:09:56] this all the time. Look at all of the
[1:09:58] message people how worldly they're
[1:09:59] becoming. Look at the ones in our church
[1:10:01] who've heard and and look what they're
[1:10:03] doing
[1:10:05] among my own family if I could say it
[1:10:07] like that. So you don't think I'm trying
[1:10:08] to cover nothing. I'm not trying to
[1:10:10] cover anything. My point is I can't save
[1:10:13] one person in here. Amen. It's Jesus
[1:10:16] Christ who does the saving. I can't make
[1:10:19] one person even brother Brandham would
[1:10:21] come back to his own tabernacle. He says
[1:10:23] as hard as I preach against cutting
[1:10:25] hair. He said, "Every time I come to the
[1:10:26] Brandom Tabernacle, I notice more hair
[1:10:29] is
[1:10:30] cut." He couldn't stop the people in
[1:10:32] this day, how I'm going to stop them in
[1:10:35] this
[1:10:37] day. It doesn't matter people. It's all
[1:10:40] about
[1:10:41] election. But as long as I tell the
[1:10:43] truth from this pullpit, that's what
[1:10:46] matters. And my point is this. By the
[1:10:49] grace of the God, people of God, ask God
[1:10:51] to help us focus, Lord. Focus. Focus me.
[1:10:54] Focus me. Focus me. Take my eyes from
[1:10:56] wherever they've been wandering and
[1:10:58] bring them back into you so so that I
[1:11:01] can make this rapture. Amen.
[1:11:04] All of us. I'm speaking about all of us.
[1:11:07] I'm talking about me as well,
[1:11:09] people. Just in the last few weeks, this
[1:11:12] has been going on with me focusing.
[1:11:14] That's why I can preach it. That's why I
[1:11:16] can talk about it because this is what
[1:11:18] I've been doing. God has been giving me
[1:11:20] grace to
[1:11:22] focus. I'm more focused now than I ever
[1:11:25] been. And nothing nothing nothing by his
[1:11:27] grace will cause me to do this ever
[1:11:30] again. Ever again. And all I'm trying to
[1:11:34] tell you is people, I'm I'm sharing with
[1:11:36] you by the grace of God, I'm I'm I'm
[1:11:38] just I'm at a place in my life you
[1:11:40] you've got to not
[1:11:43] assume because the Bible said your
[1:11:46] calling and election can be sure. So
[1:11:49] we're not assuming. Assuming is not good
[1:11:52] enough. Make it sure,
[1:11:56] right? Make it sure, people. Make it
[1:11:59] sure. Once you make it sure then you you
[1:12:01] like a eagle in in in in the
[1:12:04] wind. All right. You love the Lord.
[1:12:06] Let's
[1:12:07] stand. We don't want to be like I I I I
[1:12:10] come down. I tell you the truth. I see a
[1:12:13] lot of
[1:12:14] things. We we we c we we had a wonderful
[1:12:17] time, my wife and I, and I don't I don't
[1:12:18] want to be critical, but uh you know,
[1:12:22] they they got this thing among the
[1:12:24] churches now, especially world of
[1:12:26] churches, and they singing and they call
[1:12:28] this thing a a war
[1:12:31] chant. Oh, something they doing like
[1:12:34] they do in
[1:12:35] the football stuff. Now they putting
[1:12:39] music saying that now there's a war. And
[1:12:42] and I I told my wife, I said, "Oh my
[1:12:45] God, if we're not close to the coming of
[1:12:48] the Lord, if we're not close to the
[1:12:50] California earthquake, I don't know
[1:12:52] what." Because remember when Joshua come
[1:12:54] off the mountain, Joshua said, "They're
[1:12:56] down there worshiping." And and Moses
[1:12:58] said, "Uhuh. Uh-uh. It's the sound of
[1:13:01] war in the
[1:13:03] camp." And he comes down and he finds
[1:13:06] them with a golden calf. They literally
[1:13:08] saying they've now worshiping the God of
[1:13:11] Egypt. Oh, come on. Because you got to
[1:13:14] realize that's exactly what the World
[1:13:16] Council of Churches do. They take you
[1:13:18] back to worship the God of Egypt,
[1:13:22] however you want to say it, or Babylon,
[1:13:24] however you want to say it. But joining
[1:13:26] that takes you back. You no longer
[1:13:27] worship the true living God when you
[1:13:29] join back up. And that's what they did.
[1:13:31] They come out and say, "This is the God
[1:13:33] that brought us."
[1:13:35] They
[1:13:36] escaped
[1:13:38] Egypt and was caught by the spirits of
[1:13:41] Egypt right in the wilderness when the
[1:13:44] prophet was off the scene.
[1:13:47] Y'all hear what I'm saying? And you see
[1:13:49] you see this thing coming and and we
[1:13:52] heard I sad to say, but we heard some of
[1:13:54] the people in the message doing it and
[1:13:56] I'm thinking they ought to have enough
[1:13:58] Holy
[1:13:59] Ghost to know that's not right. God is
[1:14:04] not pleased with that sound. Y'all hear
[1:14:07] what I'm saying? There's all God there.
[1:14:09] Wherever God do something, it's always a
[1:14:11] noise, always a sound of some sort.
[1:14:13] Except the still small voice, but that
[1:14:15] is still a sound. You see what I'm
[1:14:17] saying? So my point is they don't
[1:14:19] realize we've come to this time. And
[1:14:22] what happened when Moses come, he said,
[1:14:23] you decide now, right? Whose side you
[1:14:26] on? Now understand
[1:14:29] this. Everybody that ran and escaped the
[1:14:32] earthquake still
[1:14:34] died the
[1:14:36] death. They never was able to come into
[1:14:38] the presence of God ever again. Y'all
[1:14:41] hear what I'm saying? So the California
[1:14:43] whatever you look at this thing and you
[1:14:45] say, "Oh my God, have mercy on us."
[1:14:48] Because we realize when Moses took those
[1:14:50] tablets and he threw them, amen, by the
[1:14:52] great God and that earthquake came, what
[1:14:54] happened? All of Dayton and Chorus
[1:14:56] people were swallowed up. Now let me let
[1:14:58] me put it this way. You better realize
[1:15:00] by the grace of God, we're right at the
[1:15:02] brink of this thing. Russia is doing her
[1:15:04] threats. She's doing her things. And you
[1:15:06] can't tell me that Russia was not
[1:15:08] responsible for for shooting down that
[1:15:10] plane. What she doing? Flexing her
[1:15:12] muscles just like everybody else. Right?
[1:15:16] I don't care how it was staged. I'm
[1:15:18] saying it like this. She done threatened
[1:15:19] America. Now, we know she going to send
[1:15:21] the bomb this way. Our prophet has told
[1:15:24] us right now we're right there. Israel
[1:15:27] is fighting. She done already built a
[1:15:28] new wall around Jerusalem trying to
[1:15:30] protect herself
[1:15:32] and coming to a place where she she
[1:15:35] she's ready to build a temple. All of
[1:15:37] these wars over there we see right now
[1:15:41] what's the issue? What's the issue? So I
[1:15:44] want you to understand what is the
[1:15:46] issue? The issue is we want to kill you
[1:15:49] Jerus Israel. We want to wipe you off
[1:15:51] the
[1:15:53] map. We don't want you to exist anymore.
[1:15:57] Don't you know that that's exactly what
[1:16:00] they think they will be doing when they
[1:16:01] kill
[1:16:04] 144,000? They going to they're thinking
[1:16:06] they wiping Israel off the
[1:16:10] map. And then when they kill the two
[1:16:13] prophets, oh, glory to God, we got her.
[1:16:17] And in 3 days or so, they raise
[1:16:20] up and oh my God, somebody going to
[1:16:23] realize they made a mistake.
[1:16:26] But it's too late. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:16:28] saying? That's how close we are to this
[1:16:32] thing. It's a coming a time when the
[1:16:35] when when when the virgins of God will
[1:16:38] come and say, "I have not enough oil for
[1:16:41] you."
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:44] Y'all hear what I'm saying? It's closing
[1:16:46] in on that time when you won't have time
[1:16:49] to give out to somebody else. That's why
[1:16:52] the Bible said, "Come at the acceptable
[1:16:54] time.
[1:16:55] This is right now the acceptable time.
[1:16:57] But there's coming a time you're going
[1:16:59] to have to say, "I'm sorry. I'm focusing
[1:17:02] on this. I've got enough oil and I can't
[1:17:05] spare you
[1:17:06] any because what they doing with
[1:17:14] it?" That wasn't even in my notes.
[1:17:18] But my point is this people, we're
[1:17:21] coming to a time and I believe with all
[1:17:23] my heart, if you don't start focusing on
[1:17:26] character building and your prayers be
[1:17:28] centered around character building, you
[1:17:31] going to miss it. Because the Bible said
[1:17:33] you have not because you ask not. Don't
[1:17:36] you think the Bible said no liar, no
[1:17:39] sin, nothing that will defile the city
[1:17:42] will enter therein. No flesh and blood.
[1:17:44] Y'all y'all hear what I'm saying? Let
[1:17:47] I'm trying to stop. But my point is, why
[1:17:49] would Jesus give you his life if he
[1:17:51] didn't want you to live it?
[1:17:54] It doesn't make sense to give you the
[1:17:55] Holy Ghost and let you live any kind of
[1:17:57] way you want
[1:18:00] to. No, he gives you the Holy Ghost so
[1:18:04] he can finish his ministry in the earth.
[1:18:08] It's all about him, not you. That's what
[1:18:11] it's all about. Let's pray. Father God,
[1:18:14] we come before you, Lord, as humbly as
[1:18:15] we know how. We thank you for your
[1:18:17] grace. We thank you for your mercy. We
[1:18:19] thank you for your love, Lord. You've
[1:18:20] been better to us than we've been to
[1:18:22] ourselves. Forgive us, Father, for
[1:18:24] anything we may have said or done that
[1:18:26] wasn't pleasing in your sight, Lord. But
[1:18:28] my heart, my heart, my heart, oh God,
[1:18:31] just cries out, Lord, my heart just my
[1:18:35] soul, oh God, for those of us who are in
[1:18:38] this army that we dust our shake
[1:18:40] ourselves from the dust and we raise up
[1:18:43] on our feet and be a mighty army in this
[1:18:45] little place. Have mercy upon us, Lord,
[1:18:47] add to bring us to that stature of a
[1:18:50] perfect man, Father. Let us grow all up
[1:18:53] into you, Lord. Oh God, let your perfect
[1:18:56] perfect mind be in us. We ask these
[1:18:59] things in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:19:01] Amen. I'm going to stay right under the
[1:19:05] blood. I'm going to stay.
[1:19:09] Hallelujah.
[1:19:12] Stay. And the devil
[1:19:14] came. Oh, I'm going to stay right under
