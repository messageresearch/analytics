[43:08] so they could come here to hear you
[43:10] speak to them.
[43:13] I pray, oh Lord, that you speak with
[43:14] them mouth to ear this evening, oh God.
[43:20] Lord, forgive us and purge us of all our
[43:22] trespasses,

[43:39] please you and serve you. Oh God,
[43:44] we pray oh God that you come and give

[44:21] Exodus in chapter 14.

[44:30] amen.
[44:33] I hope no one is looking for Exodus in
[44:35] the New
[44:39] Testament. That's the book that right
[44:41] comes after Genesis.
[44:45] Amen.
[44:47] read Exodus in chapter 14 starting from
[44:50] verse 10.
[44:55] The Bible reads, "And when Pharaoh drew
[44:57] nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
[44:58] their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians
[45:01] marched after them, and they were so
[45:03] afraid, and the children of Israel cried
[45:06] out unto the Lord.
[45:19] And they said unto Moses, "Because there
[45:20] were no graves in Egypt, has thou taken
[45:23] us away to die in the wilderness?
[45:25] Wherefore hast thou dealt uh thus with
[45:28] us to carry us forth out of Egypt?
[45:46] Is it not the word that we did tell thee
[45:49] in Egypt, saying, "Let us alone, for we
[45:52] may serve the Egyptians, for it had been
[45:55] better for us to serve the Egyptians,
[45:57] than that we shall die in the
[45:59] wilderness.
[46:08] And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[46:11] not. Stand still and see the salvation
[46:13] of the Lord, which he will show to you
[46:17] today. For the Egyptians whom you have
[46:19] sinned today, ye shall see them again,
[46:22] no more forever.
[46:35] And the Lord shall fight for you, and he
[46:37] shall hold your
[46:43] peace. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[46:46] "Wherefore cryst thou unto me, speak
[46:49] unto the children of Israel that they go
[46:52] forward?
[46:58] Amen. May the Lord add blessings to the
[47:00] reading of his
[47:01] word. You may take our seats. I mean for
[47:04] a short while this this evening I want
[47:06] to speak on the spoken
[47:11] word and for a subtitle I want to speak
[47:13] on
[47:14] um speak and go forward.
[47:21] Amen. Our title is the spoken word.
[47:25] suble subtitle is speak and go forward.
[47:30] Amen. So in the Bible, in the Bible
[47:32] passage we read in
[47:36] Exodus, we see the children of Israel
[47:38] were being
[47:41] delivered and they were on their way out
[47:43] of
[47:48] Egypt and they were all excited and
[47:51] happy that finally we are coming out of
[47:54] bondage.
[47:56] [Music]
[47:59] But as they were going, they did not
[48:01] know where they they didn't know what
[48:03] their path was looking like.
[48:09] And they came across a stumbling
[48:16] block. There was a deterrent right in
[48:18] front of
[48:23] them and they didn't know what to do.
[48:26] They started
[48:28] crying but they forgot that this was a
[48:31] promise that God had given their father
[48:33] Abraham.
[48:37] Hallelujah. Because he told Abraham that
[48:40] your children shall go into
[48:45] bondage. But after 400 years I will
[48:48] deliver
[48:50] them. And this was the appointed time
[48:56] that God had appointed for the children
[48:58] of Israel to be delivered.
[49:03] So he was so they were they were stuck.
[49:05] They didn't know which way to
[49:09] go. And God told
[49:12] Moses, "You speak the word. Why are you
[49:16] crying to
[49:17] me? Speak the word.
[49:21] speak unto the children of Israel
[49:24] so that they can go forward.
[49:27] And this spoken word,
[49:30] it was rooted and standing on the
[49:32] promise he had given to father
[49:37] Abraham. And we serve a God would never
[49:40] ever break his
[49:42] promise. So whatever promise he made to
[49:45] you,
[49:48] he's going to bring it to come to pass.
[49:51] And we know we are spiritual Israel.
[49:55] Hallelujah. So when you see what God was
[49:58] doing for Israel in the
[50:02] Bible, you look at it and you say, "The
[50:05] way you dealt with them, you can deal
[50:06] with me."
[50:12] So the same way he kept his promise to
[50:14] natural Israel, he can keep his promise
[50:15] to you spiritual Israel.
[50:21] Amen. So if you are faced with a trial
[50:24] whilst you in God's
[50:29] promise, God is responsible. God is
[50:32] responsible
[50:34] to bring you to your destination.
[50:38] despite what obstacle might stand in
[50:41] your way.
[50:44] So he gave his spoken word promise to
[50:50] Abraham and he made it come to
[50:53] pass. Why? Because the spoken word has
[50:58] power. In the beginning when God created
[51:01] the heavens and the
[51:02] earth, he says, "Let there be light.
[51:06] And the spoken word that he spoke
[51:10] had enough power to create light.
[51:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it doesn't
[51:17] matter how much darkness is in your
[51:19] [Music]
[51:21] life. When the Lord God speaks in your
[51:25] life, all darkness has to dispel.
[51:30] That's the power of the spoken word.
[51:33] And we know that the
[51:36] word before it is
[51:38] spoken it is a
[51:42] thought. Before any word becomes a
[51:46] word at first it is a
[51:49] thought. So a thought is a word
[51:53] expressed. So the spoken word is the
[51:56] thoughts of God
[52:01] expressed. Before God was God, while he
[52:04] was elohim,
[52:08] whilst he was the self-existing
[52:11] one, he had thoughts on his back part of
[52:14] his mind.
[52:18] And you were his
[52:19] thought. Remember what he told to
[52:23] Jeremiah. Before you were formed in your
[52:25] mother's
[52:27] womb, I knew you.
[52:30] So, he was already on uh God's thoughts
[52:33] before he was
[52:36] born. And the Bible tells us that we
[52:39] were predestinated before the foundation
[52:41] of the
[52:45] world. Let there be
[52:49] light. You were already on the back part
[52:52] of his
[52:54] mind. Amen. Amen. So, you were already
[52:58] in God's
[53:00] thoughts. You were God's thoughts.
[53:04] And we know God came and he created Adam
[53:06] and Eve.
[53:09] And when he put them on the earth, he
[53:11] told them to replenish and multiply.
[53:16] But he wanted them to bring forth
[53:18] children through the spoken
[53:22] word. He never intended them to
[53:24] reproduce or replenish the earth through
[53:32] sex. But they followed their own will
[53:34] and left God's
[53:39] will and there was the
[53:42] fall. But God's in But God's intention
[53:45] was for them to produce children by the
[53:48] spoken word.
[53:53] Amen. Amen. So when the fall
[53:57] happened, that's when everyone else
[54:01] came. We were born through the
[54:05] fall. But God, he still wants you to
[54:08] have the same image you had before the
[54:10] foundation of the world.
[54:14] the same way he had you in his
[54:19] thoughts. So this flesh is supposed to
[54:22] become the word
[54:23] [Music]
[54:26] because you were a thought and you were
[54:27] supposed to become the spoken
[54:31] word. And the only way that your flesh
[54:34] or yourself can become the
[54:39] word is when you read the word of
[54:42] God. When you eat the word of
[54:45] God. So that the thought that God had
[54:48] you was the thought of
[54:51] God. You can become the word.
[54:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So in the Bible
[54:57] that we read from Genesis all the way to
[54:58] Revelation,
[55:02] God put in mysteries
[55:05] in the form of types and
[55:10] shadows. And in these types and shadows,
[55:12] they're all talking about you and
[55:16] me. And when you go to look into those
[55:20] shadows and you see
[55:23] yourself and recognize yourself in the
[55:26] word of
[55:27] God, then you start becoming the
[55:32] word. Hallelujah. Cuz in the whole Old
[55:35] Testament, the Old Testament is full of
[55:37] types and
[55:41] shadows. When you see the children of
[55:44] Israel, you see yourself.
[55:48] When you see Eve, you see
[55:51] yourself. When you see Ruth, the gentile
[55:54] bride, you see
[55:57] yourself. What was that? That was the
[55:59] mysteries of
[56:01] God. He put in the
[56:03] Bible so that they can be revealed to
[56:07] you. And the moment you start seeing
[56:10] yourself in the
[56:12] word, you start becoming the word.
[56:16] Remember, we become what we
[56:20] eat. And the bride was told to eat the
[56:25] book. So when you start eating the book,
[56:28] you start becoming what you are eating.
[56:33] And you start becoming the
[56:36] word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why
[56:38] when every time when we come to
[56:41] church, we are looking ourselves in the
[56:43] mirror of the word.
[56:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you remember
[56:48] the story of that little boy who went to
[56:49] go look at himself in the
[56:54] mirror? He had never seen a mirror
[56:57] before. But then he stood right in front
[56:59] of that
[57:01] mirror and he started
[57:05] waving. He saw the image in the mirror
[57:07] waving back at
[57:11] him. He started jumping up and down.
[57:15] And he saw that image jumping up and
[57:17] down as
[57:19] well. He had never seen this
[57:22] before. But when he saw it,
[57:26] he says, "Mama, that is
[57:27] me." Because there is nothing else that
[57:30] can look like me but
[57:33] me. So when you look yourself into the
[57:36] word of
[57:38] God, when you look yourself in the
[57:40] mirror of the word of God,
[57:45] There is nothing else that you will see
[57:46] but
[57:49] yourself. And when you start seeing
[57:53] yourself, you start becoming the word of
[57:57] God and accepting it for your
[58:01] life. And when you receive the word of
[58:05] God, you are supposed to say amen.
[58:09] Amen means so be it.
[58:13] When you say so be
[58:15] it, you're saying Lord let your word
[58:17] have effect in my
[58:21] life. Remember when Mary got visited by
[58:23] the angel
[58:25] Gabriel
[58:27] Gabriel and she was told that you are
[58:29] going to receive a
[58:32] baby. She says I don't understand what
[58:34] you're saying. It doesn't scientifically
[58:36] make sense.
[58:41] But
[58:42] nevertheless, let it be unto me
[58:44] according to your
[58:46] word. In other words, she was saying,
[58:50] "Amen." And when she said,
[58:52] "Amen." Amen. That's when God started
[58:55] working within
[58:58] her. Hallelujah. So, we know Mary
[59:01] conceived the
[59:04] word and she gave birth to Jesus.
[59:08] But with the bride in the last day,
[59:12] We are not just supposed to conceive the
[59:16] word, but we are supposed to become the
[59:20] word. When you eat that
[59:23] word, you become the word. Hallelujah.
[59:27] Hallelujah. So, we see ourselves in the
[59:28] taps and shadows in the
[59:32] Bible. And in the scripture we read,
[59:34] we're looking at the children of Israel
[59:35] being delivered out of Israel, out of
[59:37] Egypt.
[59:41] And this was God keeping his promise he
[59:43] had given 400 years ago.
[59:52] To me, this is proof
[59:55] enough. God stands on his
[1:00:00] promise. God,
[1:00:02] he stands on his word.
[1:00:06] Whatever promise he made in your life,
[1:00:10] It has to come to pass. When those 400
[1:00:13] years were
[1:00:15] up, there is nothing that could stop the
[1:00:18] children of Israel from coming
[1:00:21] out. So we know we saw God, he kept his
[1:00:26] promise. So when each and every one of
[1:00:29] us are
[1:00:30] born, God gives you each and everything
[1:00:33] that you need for the journey here on
[1:00:35] earth.
[1:00:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In what Christ
[1:00:41] speaks,
[1:00:46] Moses was born in this
[1:00:49] world and a gifted boy.
[1:00:57] He was born to be a prophet,
[1:01:01] a
[1:01:03] deliverer. He was born with the
[1:01:05] equipment born in
[1:01:08] him. As every man that comes into the
[1:01:11] world is born with this
[1:01:16] equipment. As I firmly believe in the
[1:01:19] fornowledge of God and predestination.
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:26] So Moses was born already with
[1:01:28] everything he needed to be a
[1:01:34] deliverer. So when he came out to step
[1:01:37] into the calling that God for had for
[1:01:42] him. It wasn't trying and
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:47] failing or trial and error to see if it
[1:01:51] works. But it was it was something that
[1:01:54] God had already put within
[1:01:57] him. So you God has already put
[1:01:59] something in you.
[1:02:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Whatever you
[1:02:04] need to overcome, God has already put it
[1:02:06] within
[1:02:10] you. The victory that you need, God has
[1:02:13] already put it in
[1:02:16] you. The equipment that you need to be
[1:02:19] victorious in this life is already in
[1:02:21] you.
[1:02:26] Because there's every man that comes
[1:02:27] into the world is already born with this
[1:02:29] equipment.
[1:02:36] And God has got a promise, has got a
[1:02:38] purpose of you being
[1:02:42] here. If you can only be get to that
[1:02:48] place, how much trouble you save God and
[1:02:50] yourself
[1:02:54] too. So you are not just born to eat,
[1:02:57] live and
[1:03:00] die. God has already given you a
[1:03:05] purpose. And whatever you need for that
[1:03:07] purpose, God has already put it within
[1:03:08] you.
[1:03:12] If you are a singer, God already made
[1:03:15] you to have that gift within
[1:03:18] you. If you are supposed to play a a
[1:03:21] piano, God already has a put that gift
[1:03:24] within
[1:03:27] you. So you don't have to
[1:03:30] struggle. Hallelujah. And if you are
[1:03:33] meant to be a bride of
[1:03:36] Christ, he has already put that seed
[1:03:39] within you.
[1:03:42] And you already have a
[1:03:44] purpose of being his bride.
[1:03:47] And there is nothing that can stop
[1:03:50] you from fulfilling your purpose
[1:03:54] because he has already put it in
[1:03:56] you. Amen. Amen. Moses was commissioned
[1:03:59] and
[1:04:02] anointed. And when God commisss you and
[1:04:05] anoints
[1:04:08] you, he doesn't let you to go
[1:04:11] alone. He comes with you. Remember when
[1:04:15] he gave the disciples the
[1:04:18] commission, he had to come back as the
[1:04:20] Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost to come and live in the
[1:04:27] disciples and do the works through them.
[1:04:32] So when God gives you a commissions and
[1:04:34] calls you to do
[1:04:38] something, he is the one who's going to
[1:04:41] do it in you.
[1:04:44] Hallelujah. So don't try to do it
[1:04:46] yourself or to do it in your own
[1:04:50] accord, but you have to do it God's way.
[1:04:56] just like we saw he did he did with
[1:04:58] Moses.
[1:05:01] And you see Moses spoke and he he spoke
[1:05:04] and the Red Sea was
[1:05:06] open and the children of Israel went
[1:05:10] through after some time when they were
[1:05:12] in the
[1:05:14] wilderness. They
[1:05:16] forgot that God is a God of the spoken
[1:05:21] word. And he had told them that why are
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:25] crying? All you need to do is
[1:05:28] speak. God is telling you the same thing
[1:05:30] this
[1:05:31] evening. Why are you crying about your
[1:05:35] problem? Why are you crying about your
[1:05:39] trials? Why are you crying that I don't
[1:05:41] have enough money?
[1:05:45] Why are you crying? My relations are not
[1:05:47] going
[1:05:51] well. Why are you crying? Speak the
[1:05:54] word.
[1:05:56] Amen. And when when they were children
[1:05:58] of Israel were in the
[1:06:00] wilderness, they were lacking water.
[1:06:02] They didn't have any
[1:06:04] water. And God told
[1:06:06] Moses. He says, "Take the rod and gather
[1:06:10] the assembly together.
[1:06:14] Thou and Aaron thy
[1:06:17] brother, and speak ye unto the rock
[1:06:20] before their eyes,
[1:06:23] and it shall give forth his
[1:06:26] water, and thou shalt bring forth to
[1:06:28] them water out of the
[1:06:31] rock, and thou shalt give the
[1:06:33] congregation and their
[1:06:37] beasts. And we know that this rock is
[1:06:39] Christ.
[1:06:44] The prophet of God told us that this
[1:06:45] rock is Christ.
[1:06:48] So whatever you need from Christ,
[1:06:52] whatever you need from Jesus,
[1:06:56] whatever you need God to do in your
[1:06:59] life, get up, stop crying, and wipe your
[1:07:02] tears
[1:07:05] away. And you speak to the rock.
[1:07:09] Amen. Amen. He is not a god who is
[1:07:13] deaf but he is a god who will hear you
[1:07:15] when you
[1:07:17] pray. He said if my people who are
[1:07:20] called by my
[1:07:23] name if they humble themselves and
[1:07:27] pray he says I will hear from heaven.
[1:07:32] Amen. And he will hear and he will heal
[1:07:34] your land.
[1:07:37] So whatever that is that you are praying
[1:07:41] for just kneel down and
[1:07:45] pray and speak to the
[1:07:47] rock and I can guarantee you the rock
[1:07:50] will give you
[1:07:53] water and it will come life out of
[1:07:56] it because he never ever
[1:07:59] fails. At the Red Sea he told Moses
[1:08:02] speak the word. Why are you crying?
[1:08:06] I gave you the promise. You
[1:08:08] speak. And here they come at the rock
[1:08:11] again and they they're looking for
[1:08:13] water.
[1:08:15] You're saying go ahead. I told you you
[1:08:17] speak.
[1:08:19] Amen. And we know the first thing he did
[1:08:22] in the first
[1:08:24] Exodus. He'll do it in the second and in
[1:08:27] the
[1:08:29] third. We are in the third Exodus.
[1:08:33] Brother,
[1:08:34] sister, speak to the
[1:08:36] rock and he will give you your heart's
[1:08:40] desires because he never ever fails.
[1:08:44] He is the God of the
[1:08:46] again. If he did it
[1:08:49] before, he can do it again. If he did it
[1:08:52] for the children of
[1:08:54] Israel, he can do it
[1:08:57] again. We don't worship a historical
[1:08:59] God.
[1:09:01] We don't worship a god from 4,000 BC.
[1:09:08] We don't worship a god of 1963.
[1:09:13] But we worship a God of
[1:09:16] today who told me that if I
[1:09:22] speak to the
[1:09:24] rock, he will give me his
[1:09:27] waters because he is a covenant keeping
[1:09:31] God. Before Moses went to
[1:09:34] Egypt at that burning bush, he he was he
[1:09:37] was talking
[1:09:39] to and he says, "Lord, who am I going to
[1:09:42] say has sent me?
[1:09:56] and he says Moses was expecting a
[1:10:02] name. He was expecting a name. He says,
[1:10:05] "Who who sent me?"
[1:10:08] But God said, "You say I
[1:10:11] am. That is that is my name."
[1:10:15] What does I am mean?
[1:10:18] He did not say I
[1:10:19] was or I will be. He says I am. Because
[1:10:25] God does not dwell in
[1:10:28] time. He lives out of time. He is in
[1:10:30] eternity.
[1:10:33] So yesterday he is still I
[1:10:36] am. Today he is still I
[1:10:39] am. Tomorrow he is still I am.
[1:10:43] And I am is a covenant name he gave the
[1:10:46] children of Israel.
[1:10:50] And he gave them a covenant name. I am
[1:10:52] means
[1:10:55] becoming. That's all it means. It means
[1:11:00] becoming. Why didn't he give them a
[1:11:02] specific name?
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] Because he was telling
[1:11:09] them whatever you need
[1:11:13] I can become
[1:11:17] that. When you need
[1:11:20] water I am your water. When you need
[1:11:24] healing I am your
[1:11:27] healer. When you need
[1:11:30] salvation I am your savior.
[1:11:33] So he didn't restrict
[1:11:36] himself to one
[1:11:39] thing. He says I am that I am.
[1:11:44] So this evening he can be I am to you
[1:11:47] too. He says I am Jehovah
[1:11:50] Gyra. What does that mean? He can
[1:11:52] provide each and every
[1:11:54] need. He says I am Jehovah
[1:11:57] shalom. Shalom. What is he? He is your
[1:12:00] peace.
[1:12:02] He says, "I am Jehovah,
[1:12:05] the Lord, my
[1:12:07] banner." Hallelujah. He says, "I'm
[1:12:09] Jehovah Shama."
[1:12:12] So, he is my friend when my other
[1:12:14] friends walks
[1:12:17] out. He is the friend that sticks right
[1:12:19] by
[1:12:21] me. Because my Bible tells
[1:12:24] me that he is the friend that stickketh
[1:12:26] closer than a brother.
[1:12:31] call on I am.
[1:12:33] He will come to your rescue.
[1:12:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So whenever they
[1:12:38] needed anything,
[1:12:42] they had to remember that he is I am
[1:12:45] something. But now in the New
[1:12:48] Testament they say you don't have to
[1:12:50] remember all those
[1:12:53] names. You don't have to start remind
[1:12:56] Jara, is it Shalom, is it Rafa?
[1:12:59] You just have to call on the name of
[1:13:02] Jesus because Jehovah of the Old
[1:13:06] Testament is Jesus of the New
[1:13:08] Testament. So Jehovah Jehovah shalom
[1:13:11] Jehovah Jehovah shalom
[1:13:19] shall call on
[1:13:21] Jesus. Hallelujah. He's bridge over
[1:13:24] water.
[1:13:26] He's a bridge over water.
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:30] He's the doctor in the sick
[1:13:33] room. I'm
[1:13:35] thirsty. Food when I'm
[1:13:38] hungry. He is my lawyer in my courtroom.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah. He's the one who intercedes
[1:13:45] for
[1:13:47] you. He is the lily of the valley.
[1:13:50] He's the bright and morning star.
[1:13:55] He is my everything.
[1:13:58] Hallelujah. Why? Because Jesus is
[1:14:02] sovereign. Whatever he says, he has the
[1:14:05] final
[1:14:07] say. Sovereign
[1:14:10] means he has the final
[1:14:14] say. Each and everyone of us in here can
[1:14:17] have a
[1:14:20] saying. But the person who has the final
[1:14:23] say
[1:14:25] is what we call
[1:14:28] sovereign and the person who sovereign
[1:14:31] whatever they
[1:14:34] say it has the final
[1:14:36] say no one can come and overturn it or
[1:14:39] try to contest
[1:14:41] it. Hallelujah. So our God Jesus he is
[1:14:45] sovereign.
[1:14:48] People may have a say on your life.
[1:14:52] They might have thoughts about your
[1:14:56] life, but my Jesus has the final.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I don't have
[1:15:02] to worry what I'm going
[1:15:05] through. Or what's coming or what's not
[1:15:09] coming. I just have to speak to the
[1:15:13] rock. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can
[1:15:15] say, "My Christian life is dried out.
[1:15:21] Speak to that rock. Amen. He will bring
[1:15:24] you back
[1:15:26] joy. He will bring you back
[1:15:29] peace. You are going through
[1:15:33] depression to that rock. You are going
[1:15:36] through
[1:15:38] lack. Speak to that
[1:15:40] rock. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because he
[1:15:43] will give you what you
[1:15:45] need to accomplish the purpose that you
[1:15:47] have in your life.
[1:15:50] Remember, if you look in the shadows and
[1:15:52] the taps of the
[1:15:55] Bible, you will see
[1:15:57] yourself and you will see that you have
[1:15:59] a
[1:16:01] purpose and God has a purpose in your
[1:16:04] life. And when you are anointed for a
[1:16:08] job, there is nothing that can stand
[1:16:11] before
[1:16:14] you. And there is no one who can
[1:16:16] accomplish your purpose more than
[1:16:21] yourself because no one can be you
[1:16:23] better than you.
[1:16:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So that is your
[1:16:29] superpower. Your superpower is
[1:16:34] me. When you are
[1:16:36] anointed, God will come and take care of
[1:16:40] you. David was anointed to be a king.
[1:16:45] when he was anointed, he was a shepherd
[1:16:51] boy. And when God sent the prophet
[1:16:53] Samuel to go find the next
[1:16:59] king, Samuel, he said, "Bring all your
[1:17:02] sons."
[1:17:05] And they brought all the different
[1:17:07] sons. When the first first son came,
[1:17:09] they try to pour all
[1:17:14] Second, third, fourth,
[1:17:16] fifth, oil could not come
[1:17:19] out all the way to the seventh.
[1:17:23] Oil could not come
[1:17:25] out. Samuel asked and says, "Are you
[1:17:27] sure there is no other
[1:17:30] one?" And Jesse David's father was like,
[1:17:35] "Um, oh, there's this one little boy who
[1:17:43] David's own father had not even
[1:17:45] considered
[1:17:49] him. But God had conceded him.
[1:17:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when David
[1:17:54] came
[1:17:55] up that oil ran out of that
[1:17:58] horn and he anointed him, no one can
[1:18:02] take your
[1:18:04] place. It doesn't matter even if you are
[1:18:06] the last one to come in.
[1:18:10] They can interview 300 people for that
[1:18:17] job. If that job is meant to be
[1:18:22] yours for
[1:18:25] you, the blessing has got your name on
[1:18:33] it. You can say, "I'm re I'm running
[1:18:36] behind time in life.
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:42] I was supposed to do this five years
[1:18:46] ago. What's yours is
[1:18:49] yours. No one can take it away from
[1:18:53] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So your
[1:18:55] anointing is
[1:18:58] yours. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In what
[1:19:01] Christ speaks,
[1:19:04] David knew he was anointed.
[1:19:08] and was a vindicator to be a good shot.
[1:19:17] He was a good
[1:19:22] shot. Good
[1:19:27] shot. He was good at
[1:19:31] aiming. He know that. He know that. They
[1:19:34] know he was a good shot. David was
[1:19:39] anointed. When he stood before Goliath,
[1:19:41] he never cried, "Oh God, what must I do
[1:19:43] now?"
[1:19:45] [Music]
[1:19:48] He said, "I know what you did in the
[1:19:50] times
[1:19:52] past. You let me kill a bear. You let me
[1:19:55] kill a lion.
[1:19:58] But what about this Goliath out here?
[1:20:04] He never did
[1:20:05] that. He didn't start
[1:20:08] whining. He just spoke.
[1:20:12] What did he say? He just said, "You will
[1:20:15] be like they
[1:20:17] were." He spoke the
[1:20:20] word. He didn't start
[1:20:23] crying. What was he depending
[1:20:27] on? You know, he was anointed.
[1:20:31] It says he never prayed a
[1:20:34] prayer. He never offered
[1:20:38] nothing. He knew he was
[1:20:40] anointed. He was anointed. And that
[1:20:43] slingshot had proved that right kind of
[1:20:45] a
[1:20:49] thing. He had faith in his anointing.
[1:20:54] And he had faith that God could direct
[1:20:56] that rock right straight in the middle
[1:20:58] of the helmet.
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] Hallelujah. He knew that he had faith in
[1:21:06] his anointing.
[1:21:10] So he knew he was anointed to be
[1:21:14] king. There is nothing that was going to
[1:21:17] kill David until he became
[1:21:21] king. There is no lion that could kill
[1:21:24] David until he became king.
[1:21:30] David, there's no bear that could kill
[1:21:32] David until he became David.
[1:21:37] So he knew that one way or the
[1:21:39] other was going to overcome
[1:21:42] Goliath. He was trusting in his
[1:21:46] anointing. He was trusting in his
[1:21:50] purpose. So your purpose and your
[1:21:52] anointing is your protection.
[1:21:57] not going to die until you have
[1:21:59] accomplished God's
[1:22:03] will. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God says
[1:22:06] you will never stay 5 minutes long on
[1:22:08] this earth after what you needed to
[1:22:15] do. So long you have breath in your
[1:22:20] body. You know that your purpose is
[1:22:22] protecting
[1:22:23] you. Your anointing is protecting you.
[1:22:27] Nothing is going to happen to
[1:22:30] you until you have accomplished your
[1:22:32] purpose.
[1:22:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So my Bible
[1:22:36] tells me that David ran.
[1:22:41] He ran towards
[1:22:43] Goliath. He wasn't hiding. He wasn't
[1:22:48] ducking. But he ran because he knew he
[1:22:50] had the victory.
[1:22:55] faith in his
[1:22:57] anointing. So if you have faith in your
[1:22:59] anointing this
[1:23:01] evening, go fight your
[1:23:05] enemy. You are going to win because
[1:23:08] you've been anointed to be the bride in
[1:23:10] this end
[1:23:12] time. And we have been promised to be
[1:23:15] victorious over the
[1:23:18] enemy. So whatever you are going
[1:23:20] through, just sling it to the enemy.
[1:23:25] Sling until you
[1:23:29] overcome. Sling that slingshot until you
[1:23:31] get your
[1:23:36] breakthrough. Sling it until you get
[1:23:40] healed. Sling until you get set
[1:23:44] free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because
[1:23:46] you have an anointing.
[1:23:49] under that anointing.
[1:23:51] All you just have to do, brother,
[1:23:54] sister, speak the word. Because remember
[1:23:57] the spoken word
[1:24:00] has
[1:24:02] authority. All these things we are
[1:24:04] talking
[1:24:05] about. They happen so God could show you
[1:24:08] and
[1:24:11] me that when you speak the
[1:24:14] word, he will act on it.
[1:24:18] When Moses spoke the
[1:24:21] word, the sea was
[1:24:24] open. When he spoke to the
[1:24:26] rock, the water came
[1:24:29] out. When Joshua spoke to the
[1:24:33] son, the son had to stand
[1:24:35] still. When David spoke to
[1:24:40] Goliath, Goliath had to be
[1:24:43] defeated. Speak the word this evening.
[1:24:48] It has to be defeated
[1:24:51] over standing in front of you. It has to
[1:24:54] be
[1:24:56] open because for each and every trial.
[1:25:00] The Bible tells me that there is an open
[1:25:04] door and that open door is
[1:25:07] Jesus because he says I am the
[1:25:10] way. So all these
[1:25:13] examples was not for just a
[1:25:18] showing you and
[1:25:21] me. If you use the spoken word,
[1:25:26] he will come to your rescue.
[1:25:29] And this the last
[1:25:30] day and we know God came
[1:25:33] down and he told his prophet
[1:25:37] and his prophet was
[1:25:39] hunting. He was looking for
[1:25:41] squirrels and God came to him and he
[1:25:45] says, "What do you
[1:25:47] need?" He says, "I have I have no
[1:25:53] game." He says, "Pardon this, but it's
[1:25:55] coming up in
[1:25:59] me." I got to say it. You said, "It was
[1:26:03] he that said that they have the inside
[1:26:05] that woods.
[1:26:09] You have no
[1:26:13] gain. And he created three squirrels
[1:26:16] standing there before
[1:26:20] us. What is it? Just speaking the
[1:26:25] word. And he says, "I want one right
[1:26:27] over
[1:26:30] there." And him saying, "I want one over
[1:26:33] there." It created that scroll.
[1:26:38] And he shot it. And he says, "I want
[1:26:41] another one over
[1:26:42] there." And he shot it. He says, "I want
[1:26:46] one right over there." And he shot it.
[1:26:50] What was God
[1:26:51] doing? It's not just a
[1:26:54] show. It was showing
[1:26:57] you. If you yield and to if you yield
[1:27:00] yourself to
[1:27:02] God, you can use the spoken word.
[1:27:06] And we know that this happened
[1:27:09] twice. A year
[1:27:11] later, God came again to brother
[1:27:14] Brandon. He created squirrels
[1:27:19] again. It was not a
[1:27:22] coincidence. It was not a
[1:27:25] mistake. When anything happened
[1:27:29] twice, we know two is a
[1:27:32] witness. Hallelujah. It happened
[1:27:36] twice. Sister, you have the same power
[1:27:39] too to speak your squirrels.
[1:27:44] You might say, "I don't eat
[1:27:47] squirrels." I know what you have been
[1:27:49] praying
[1:27:56] for. I know what you've been praying
[1:28:00] for. You speak and go forward.
[1:28:05] God will take care of the rest.
[1:28:08] And we know that this was the onset of
[1:28:10] the third pool
[1:28:15] ministry ministry is not for the
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:20] denominations is for the bride of
[1:28:24] Christ for you and me. What is it
[1:28:28] about? Speak and go for what?
[1:28:33] And the prophet of God, he came and he
[1:28:35] started giving the testimony amongst
[1:28:40] brothers talking about how the voice
[1:28:42] came to him and tell told him to
[1:28:48] to say there was that was in Hati
[1:28:51] Wright's
[1:28:54] house and he says for the first time
[1:28:58] this ever
[1:29:01] happened upon a human
[1:29:07] being was a little humble
[1:29:13] woman. This was the first time the third
[1:29:15] pool was being in action amongst
[1:29:21] humans that it's not just for out there
[1:29:24] to be creating spir in the nature.
[1:29:29] But it is for you to speak your heart's
[1:29:34] desires. And we know the prophet of God,
[1:29:37] he asked it,
[1:29:40] right? He says, "What's your heart's
[1:29:44] desire?" And she was right there. She
[1:29:46] started
[1:29:47] thinking. And he says, "Well, you have
[1:29:50] your sister who's in the wheelchair. She
[1:29:51] can't be
[1:29:53] healed. You you need money. you can
[1:29:56] speak. God can give you a million
[1:29:58] dollars.
[1:30:01] But she wasn't thinking about all that.
[1:30:04] Her heart of her mother,
[1:30:06] she started thinking about her two
[1:30:10] boys and she said, "I want the salvation
[1:30:12] of my two
[1:30:14] boys." And the prophet of God says, "I
[1:30:17] give them to
[1:30:18] you." What was that? It was the spoken
[1:30:22] word in effect. And it was
[1:30:27] God's promise to pass.
[1:30:31] Those two boys, they left what they were
[1:30:32] doing and came and
[1:30:36] ran and they knelt there and they gave
[1:30:38] their life to
[1:30:40] God. So the third pool is not only for
[1:30:43] you
[1:30:45] alone, but you can use it on your loved
[1:30:47] ones
[1:30:49] too. You can claim that.
[1:30:55] brother, sister,
[1:30:59] spouse, you can speak the
[1:31:02] word and God will bring
[1:31:05] them because the spoken word is for you
[1:31:08] to
[1:31:12] use. The prophet of God had a vision
[1:31:16] and he saw he saw a snake.
[1:31:20] A ma
[1:31:23] I'll read it right through. He says
[1:31:24] about two three months ago.
[1:31:27] I was standing in the room. I heard a
[1:31:29] voice speaking in the
[1:31:31] corner. I tried to wake my wife to look
[1:31:33] at it.
[1:31:36] There is been uh on it's been going on
[1:31:39] is going before. There was a hideous
[1:31:42] thing standing there at the
[1:31:48] bed accusing me.
[1:31:52] I had seen a big mamba
[1:31:56] running. So that's an African snake and
[1:31:59] he was trying to kill
[1:32:02] people and I was after my brother.
[1:32:06] So the prophet of God was here in a
[1:32:07] vision.
[1:32:10] He sees a big mama that was running
[1:32:11] after the people.
[1:32:16] One of the top five most venomous snake
[1:32:18] they are.
[1:32:24] And the prophet was here and he started
[1:32:26] crying. He says, "God, what can I do
[1:32:28] about this
[1:32:32] snake?" Here's what God told him.
[1:32:35] You've been given power to bind
[1:32:39] him. Be of good courage. He says, I
[1:32:43] spoke to him
[1:32:45] and his tail went up in the
[1:32:49] air and whirled
[1:32:51] around just like this picture handle
[1:32:55] there and choked himself to
[1:33:00] death and that blue smoke flew out of
[1:33:02] him.
[1:33:07] with a spoken
[1:33:08] word he spoke and that snake was
[1:33:13] destroyed. It says there's nothing
[1:33:16] poisonous as a
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] ma and the snake of course represents
[1:33:25] sin deaths.
[1:33:29] So the snake he was seeing in the
[1:33:32] vision, it was representing sin and
[1:33:36] death that was trying to come after the
[1:33:39] bride of Christ.
[1:33:42] But he says, "And I said, Satan, in the
[1:33:44] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:46] Christ, I bind you." And the serpent of
[1:33:50] blue smoke flew out of
[1:33:54] it and he curled up and made that like
[1:33:57] an S.
[1:33:59] S capital S made backwards
[1:34:07] which is like an N sign
[1:34:11] and means the sign the end sign he says
[1:34:15] it means bind this one or anything below
[1:34:18] him
[1:34:24] because he was the
[1:34:26] worst cuz he was the worst. The snake
[1:34:29] was the most venomous
[1:34:32] snake. There's nothing more venomous
[1:34:34] than Satan.
[1:34:39] There's nothing more venomous but
[1:34:43] death. And God pays a particular
[1:34:45] attention to
[1:34:48] detail. That snake didn't go into a
[1:34:50] letter
[1:34:53] C. It didn't go into a letter A.
[1:34:57] But it formed the the sign end.
[1:35:04] And the prophet of God tells us that end
[1:35:06] means bind this one or anything below
[1:35:09] him.
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:19] Because he was the worst.
[1:35:21] So when he spoke the
[1:35:24] word Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:29] Christ that was after the
[1:35:34] bride was
[1:35:36] bound. Sin and death have no power over
[1:35:40] you. He says bind this one or anything
[1:35:43] below
[1:35:45] you. There's nothing higher than
[1:35:48] death. You know sin is
[1:35:51] death. Anything that is below
[1:35:55] death is bound as
[1:35:57] well by the spoken word.
[1:36:01] So when you speak the spoken
[1:36:04] word, you can bind
[1:36:07] cancer. You can bind a
[1:36:10] headache. You can bind diabetes.
[1:36:15] Because remember, you have a
[1:36:18] commission. The bride is supposed to
[1:36:20] prophesy
[1:36:23] again. What does again
[1:36:25] mean? Doing what has already been done
[1:36:28] before.
[1:36:30] Death and sin was
[1:36:33] bound. Death and sin was
[1:36:36] destroyed. So you can overcome sin
[1:36:40] too. You can overcome death
[1:36:43] too. Why? Using the spoken
[1:36:47] worden word has
[1:36:51] power to destroy your
[1:36:54] enemy. The spoken word has enough power
[1:36:57] to destroy sin in your
[1:37:02] life. I'm tired of this sinful
[1:37:07] life. Dirty
[1:37:11] habits
[1:37:13] word. God will give you the victory
[1:37:17] because everything from death going
[1:37:22] backwards. It was bound. It does not
[1:37:24] have any authority.
[1:37:28] Amen. So when you speak things
[1:37:32] happen you have
[1:37:35] authority because the authority comes
[1:37:37] from
[1:37:39] from the word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah. The Messiah, the prophet of
[1:37:43] God
[1:37:44] says he comes upon his church in the
[1:37:46] last
[1:37:48] day, what will it be? A pulled out
[1:37:53] people, a group of people anointed with
[1:37:56] the spirit of
[1:38:01] God. They will be messiahs,
[1:38:07] small messiahs.
[1:38:09] They will be anointed.
[1:38:11] And if his spirit is in
[1:38:15] them, they'll do the things that he did
[1:38:18] just
[1:38:21] exactly. So you are a small messiah.
[1:38:25] And you can do the exact same
[1:38:29] thing that the capital M messiah
[1:38:34] did. His holy spirit is in you.
[1:38:39] They'll do the things that he did just
[1:38:45] exactly something different but exactly
[1:38:47] the
[1:38:49] same. The power that was in God was
[1:38:52] poured into
[1:38:54] Christ. The power that was in Christ was
[1:38:57] poured in the
[1:39:01] church. The same power that is was in
[1:39:03] the Messiah is in the Messiah.
[1:39:09] This evening I was looking up what
[1:39:10] Messiah
[1:39:14] means in Hebrew. And in Hebrew it means
[1:39:16] it's messiah.
[1:39:21] Mashiach and it means anointed one.
[1:39:25] And in Hebrew says it refers to a person
[1:39:28] chosen by God for a specific role.
[1:39:38] So you are not chosen
[1:39:42] randomly. You are a messiah for a
[1:39:44] specific
[1:39:48] role like a
[1:39:50] king like a priest
[1:39:53] or a prophet.
[1:39:55] So you being a
[1:39:58] messiah you have a role to be a king.
[1:40:04] What does a king do? A king has
[1:40:08] authority. You have been called to be a
[1:40:10] priest.
[1:40:13] What does a priest do? He goes to God to
[1:40:16] intercede.
[1:40:19] For his sins and the sins of the
[1:40:23] people. And what does a prophet
[1:40:26] do? A prophet prophesies.
[1:40:30] And we see right this in the
[1:40:32] word revelation 16 he says and he hath
[1:40:34] made us kings and
[1:40:39] priests unto God his
[1:40:42] father not just for
[1:40:45] fun for his
[1:40:47] glory to him be glory and dominion
[1:40:50] forever and
[1:40:53] ever a messiah to be a king priest and
[1:40:56] prophet
[1:41:00] Revelation is telling us he has made us
[1:41:02] kings and
[1:41:04] priests. What do kings do? Kings they
[1:41:08] speak because they have authority and
[1:41:11] when they speak things have to
[1:41:13] happen in revelation 10 chapter
[1:41:17] 10 and I took a little book out of the
[1:41:22] angel ate it up. It was in my mouth
[1:41:25] sweet as honey. And as soon as I eaten
[1:41:27] it, my belly was
[1:41:32] bitter. John, who represents the
[1:41:36] bride, and he said unto
[1:41:38] me, thou must prophesy
[1:41:43] again before many peoples and nations
[1:41:45] and
[1:41:48] tongues. So we see those three roles of
[1:41:51] a messiah.
[1:41:56] priest, king and
[1:41:59] prophet. We are called to prophesy.
[1:42:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Where do you get
[1:42:06] the power
[1:42:07] from? Remember, you eat the spoken
[1:42:11] word. You became you become what you
[1:42:14] eat. When you eat that little
[1:42:18] book, you eat that word.
[1:42:21] You become the
[1:42:23] word and you say is the prophet got in
[1:42:25] the talk and he
[1:42:26] says it has to be because woman and
[1:42:29] husband become one.
[1:42:36] They become one and so does the bride
[1:42:39] and Christ become
[1:42:41] one. The ministry of the bride
[1:42:45] and the ministry of Christ
[1:42:48] is the same. choose. Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah. So he is the Messiah.
[1:42:55] You are the Messiah.
[1:42:58] The ministry of king priest and
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] prophet in you.
[1:43:05] And he says remember this former treat
[1:43:08] is all theophilus.
[1:43:14] All that Jesus be to do and continues to
[1:43:16] do.
[1:43:20] All that Jesus was
[1:43:22] doing, his death didn't stop
[1:43:26] him. So he returned
[1:43:29] again, not as a third
[1:43:32] person. The same person returned again
[1:43:34] in the form of the Holy
[1:43:38] Ghost. Why? He came back as the Holy
[1:43:40] Ghost to continue the work and it
[1:43:43] continues
[1:43:46] on. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:48] yesterday, today and
[1:43:51] forever. The same works he was doing on
[1:43:53] the shores of
[1:43:56] Galilee. You can do the same thing
[1:43:59] too because he the Holy
[1:44:01] Ghost, he is in you doing it. So you
[1:44:06] have a ministry similar to that of
[1:44:10] Christ in the seven church ages. He
[1:44:13] says, "So when a spirit
[1:44:15] born, spiritfilled man in
[1:44:19] faith, he takes that faith, he he takes
[1:44:23] uh in faith takes that word into his
[1:44:27] heart and places it upon his
[1:44:31] lips. Why? That is the same as deity
[1:44:38] speaking. Every mountain has to move.
[1:44:45] Satan cannot stand before that
[1:44:49] man. So when you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:53] you are not receiving just a
[1:44:55] spirit, you are receiving Christ
[1:44:59] himself. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the
[1:45:01] word of God is telling
[1:45:03] me when you have the spirit of Christ in
[1:45:07] you, when you start speaking,
[1:45:11] The spoken
[1:45:13] word the same power as if Jesus is
[1:45:18] speaking the same as deity is
[1:45:22] speaking he is within you.
[1:45:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'll finish off
[1:45:30] in the seven church
[1:45:32] ages vision
[1:45:35] don't fear little
[1:45:38] flock all that I am you are heir
[1:45:44] to this
[1:45:46] evening all that I am
[1:45:53] to Jesus was to the whole kingdom of
[1:45:56] heaven
[1:45:59] So he's telling you that you are to that
[1:46:01] as
[1:46:02] well. You are to the power.
[1:46:06] You are to the power of
[1:46:09] resurrection. You are to the power of
[1:46:12] overcoming sin.
[1:46:15] To the power of overcoming all
[1:46:19] sin to the power of overcoming death,
[1:46:21] hell and
[1:46:24] the my power is
[1:46:27] yours. Omnipotence is
[1:46:31] yours. You are
[1:46:34] omnipotent. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[1:46:36] says is yours as I stand in your
[1:46:40] midst. Bring fear and failure.
[1:46:46] The word of God didn't bring
[1:46:50] fear. Every time the angel of God
[1:46:52] stepped
[1:46:55] down in the Bible and in the ministry of
[1:46:57] the
[1:46:59] prophet, what was his
[1:47:03] word? So the word of God dispels all
[1:47:08] fear. So you don't got to fear your
[1:47:10] enemy.
[1:47:13] You don't got to fear the trials that's
[1:47:14] going to come your
[1:47:17] way to all of God's
[1:47:21] power. I didn't come to bring fear and
[1:47:23] failure.
[1:47:33] to
[1:47:34] me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's Jesus
[1:47:37] speaking to you
[1:47:39] this power is given to
[1:47:43] me death, hell, and the
[1:47:47] grave. He took all the
[1:47:50] power to
[1:47:53] you to that
[1:47:55] power. He says all power is given for me
[1:47:58] to
[1:47:59] me and it is yours to use.
[1:48:06] You speak the
[1:48:08] word will perform
[1:48:11] it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So your
[1:48:15] duty just speak the
[1:48:18] word about what's
[1:48:23] happening who's performing
[1:48:26] it the after
[1:48:30] effects duty is just to speak the spoken
[1:48:34] word speak to the
[1:48:36] rock speak to that red
[1:48:39] sea you speak the word
[1:48:44] performance. That is my covenant.
[1:48:48] That's God's covenant between you, him,
[1:48:50] and you.
[1:48:52] He says, "My
[1:48:53] covenant is that you
[1:48:56] speak and I will perform it and it can
[1:49:00] never
[1:49:01] fail." God says it can never
[1:49:05] fail. You stand and you say it can never
[1:49:10] fail. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I don't
[1:49:12] care what sickness stands my
[1:49:17] way out of
[1:49:20] existence because I have a covenant
[1:49:23] keeping
[1:49:25] God. Look at this. A
[1:49:27] covenant, something that's based on two
[1:49:32] people. He say some covenants say you do
[1:49:34] that and I will do this.
[1:49:40] nothing to do with
[1:49:42] it. Your only duty in this
[1:49:46] covenant speak the word.
[1:49:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When you speak
[1:49:52] that
[1:49:53] word has the same
[1:49:56] power and same
[1:49:58] authority as deity
[1:50:02] itself because you are not the one
[1:50:04] performing it.
[1:50:08] was performing
[1:50:09] it. So I'm challenging you this
[1:50:16] evening. Face your
[1:50:19] enemy. You have the
[1:50:21] power. Just speak the
[1:50:23] word. Be reckless with the
[1:50:28] enemy. Speak and go
[1:50:32] forward. It is a guarantee in the word.
[1:50:37] He will perform
[1:50:39] it. Say I may perform
[1:50:43] it. I will perform
[1:50:46] it. Tells me God is not a man that he
[1:50:50] should
[1:50:51] lie. So whatever word he
[1:50:55] speaks to come to
[1:50:57] pass. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So if he
[1:51:00] says I will
[1:51:02] perform, he will do it.
[1:51:05] Brother, sister, speak this evening.
[1:51:11] Let us all stand. Amen. Oh, speak that
[1:51:14] word
[1:51:16] and he will do it for you.
[1:51:20] Amen. Amen. Let us sing this song.
[1:51:24] We've got the power in the name of
[1:51:25] Jesus.
[1:51:28] We've got the
[1:51:31] power in the name of
[1:51:35] Jesus. We got the

[1:52:57] defeated. We got the
[1:53:01] power in the name of the
[1:53:04] Lord. Amen. Let us all bow our heads.

[2:09:15] every hurt and write every
[2:09:22] wrong. We need you right
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:28] now. Come and turn this around.
[2:09:35] Oh, deep down I know this world isn't
[2:09:41] home. But come Jesus,
[2:09:47] come. Come
[2:09:50] Jesus,
[2:09:54] come. Amen. God bless you.
