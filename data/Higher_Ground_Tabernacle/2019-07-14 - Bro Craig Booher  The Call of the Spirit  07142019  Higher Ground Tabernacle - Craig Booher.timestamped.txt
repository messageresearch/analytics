[32:30] preach this morning on the call of the
[32:31] Spirit may God bless the reading of his
[32:36] words you can have your seats brother
[32:43] branham told a story about an eagle that
[32:48] an eagle egg that was put under a
[32:50] chicken the egg Ligeti loved elective
[32:55] and we're all familiar with the story
[32:59] how a farmer had found an eagle egg and
[33:02] come on and he put it up under his
[33:05] chicken and that chicken took care of
[33:10] that eagle egg and the eggs hatched all
[33:17] the eggs had and the chickens were quite
[33:22] comfortable in the in the barnyard they
[33:28] would scratch in the manure pile eating
[33:34] bugs
[33:37] they were comfortable they were chicken
[33:40] but the eagle did not feel comfortable
[33:42] mainly tobacco he seemed like he was out
[33:45] of place and he thought he was a chicken
[33:51] and he did his best to act like a
[33:53] chicken and to live like a chicken but
[33:57] there was a problem he was not a chicken
[34:01] so he could never be satisfied no matter
[34:05] what he did no matter how many bugs he
[34:08] ate no matter how many chicken revivals
[34:12] I had competitive failure he could not
[34:14] be comfortable he passes on because he
[34:16] was not a chicken one day mama knew she
[34:21] had another egg she come flying over the
[34:25] hill screaming
[34:29] Keo Junior where are you no junior where
[34:34] are you and she went right over the
[34:37] chicken yard if this you play and she
[34:40] screamed junior like eh shivers went
[34:43] through his mind he never heard the
[34:47] voice before but there was something in
[34:51] that voice said he news but I've watched
[34:53] laughing he knew the eagle sound
[34:57] canoodling there was a deep call in his
[34:59] heart I've been hung girl and she said
[35:02] come up here mama I don't know how to
[35:05] get up she said you're an eagle baby he
[35:16] said I never used these when Diwali
[35:20] comes and so he started flapping his way
[35:23] lazy before pieces in he was a little
[35:25] clumsy at first CPR but he got up to the
[35:28] fence line man clearly that he faced
[35:30] only she says you gotta come up I come
[35:33] on tail call he started flying away my
[35:36] uncle says he got up over the bar he was
[35:39] feeling good but she said come upon taco
[35:44] and pretty soon the wind Carter here pay
[35:46] Lu
[35:53] then she found her god-given place visa
[35:57] sown on rocky job now the potential was
[36:00] always there donated his own she was
[36:03] always an eagle
[36:05] but she was awakened by the ego it was
[36:10] the spirit that was hunting her and
[36:13] that's the way it is we were born in
[36:18] this world we live like the world we did
[36:24] we were sitting on the lookin for God
[37:12] the very nature of man is to look
[37:36] except the father is like this and he's
[37:47] looking for the Holy Spirit the Holy
[37:59] Spirit daughter of God preparing us for
[38:26] us in the days of Jesus there were
[38:32] millions we're looking for a deliverer
[38:39] but when the deliverer que las
[38:41] carreteras vineyard they rejected him
[38:44] along because they were looking for
[38:46] something else there was millions but he
[38:51] only reveals himself to 12 and one of
[38:54] those are a devil InnoCentive Lakatos he
[38:57] see notice this they were those who were
[38:59] looking for his appearing D LaMacchia V
[39:02] Sookie who got me kept on this on Apollo
[39:04] Bible said as many is believed ordained
[39:07] to eternal life
[39:11] ee o the Pharisees read the same Bible
[39:20] every church denomination reads the same
[39:24] Bible is Lucy say but the priests were
[39:29] trying to serve God according to their
[39:31] works mailing the law
[39:35] but God ReWalk God revealed himself the
[39:38] fishermen may just have little memory
[39:40] shell
[39:41] they call him a friend of sinners he or
[39:43] not believe he was sure he revealed
[39:45] himself to prostitution even ask him why
[39:49] are you always eating with the publican
[39:52] gmm people participated why didn't he
[39:56] reveal himself to KF s evilly why didn't
[40:02] he come to care for society he never did
[40:07] it in the puffy but he did reveal
[40:09] himself to a prostitute in prostitution
[40:13] this is hard to comprehend hundred and
[40:17] twenty believers in some tents so fan
[40:22] out of the Ionians of Israel are just a
[40:30] few if your name is not on the book of
[40:35] lies don't only but only for this you
[40:37] cannot respond to the words you look
[40:39] upon what is it this amazing the priest
[40:42] calls Jesus the devil ELISA Qatar
[40:45] pleases you and legibly they read their
[40:47] Bible is only let they paint their paths
[40:50] of B look they went to church and they
[40:56] call Jesus the devil is roughly Syrian
[40:59] people here come a harlot walking down
[41:01] the road and when he said told her her
[41:06] life she said we do with Messiah would
[41:10] come tell us these things shows see in
[41:15] those priests was no predestinated every
[41:19] policy the prostitute there was a prius
[41:22] related syria being supported is beyond
[41:25] she was an eagle to begin a global small
[41:29] how to make you shout
[41:32] notice this every age God sends his word
[41:35] you don't suck us to over supper and
[41:37] that word is like the lights wearing a
[41:39] party early possible and it quickens the
[41:44] seed the Electra spawned Elizabeth upon
[41:49] but the note I left walk away knows me
[41:53] and God is searching now it's recession
[41:56] and God is calling his electability
[41:59] modest hauling his elect is drawing them
[42:06] there are some people who will never be
[42:08] saved yet result in films are movie the
[42:11] Bible tells us in Jude 1:4
[42:15] that these are men ordained to
[42:18] condemnation
[42:20] Oh Daniel a poem Denison and they would
[42:23] not believe though Jesus walked on water
[42:28] Yonkers is real messy though he spoke to
[42:31] storms and stopped enough to pay the Tom
[42:34] paid and he even told the rich young
[42:36] ruler he said they will not believe even
[42:40] if one is risen from the dead
[42:44] when Lazarus was raised from the dead
[42:47] they wanted to kill Lazarus
[42:50] that's your Bible they would not believe
[42:53] though one was risen from the dead you
[42:56] need puck Walker that's not a people
[42:58] this is hard to understand they could
[43:01] look at the miracle spheres we got big
[43:03] volume you'd still not believe in
[43:05] equality they were all dying the
[43:07] condemnation blew me up on Tennessee
[43:10] their brute beasts made to be destroyed
[43:14] brother madam said there will be
[43:16] millions for Dane to condemnation when
[43:18] I'm with ya Bianca don't can you say man

[44:16] him out in this for a boy if there's a
[44:19] pull in your heart for more God

[44:28] had a thought of coming to God it's less
[44:30] I mean if you're the most blessed person
[44:32] that ever walked on the face of the
[44:34] earth longer could be because the Holy
[44:36] Spirit is calling you you ought to be
[44:39] the most thankful person you look on

[49:39] name is on the book he's not really busy
[49:42] anointed only and God
[49:44] this is about you and God is that people
[49:47] do fool not about a church not about a
[49:51] doctrine organization it is about you
[49:57] and a personal relationship with God is
[50:02] so real AJ the end to the heart that
[50:05] seeks him he'll meet you in your kitchen

[50:31] the elect
[50:37] we feel the pole in our hearts is know
[50:40] is a heavenly calling you don't all that
[50:42] touches your lapel and I just come out
[50:46] of Genesis chapter 7 verse 1 is
[50:49] regeneration is where the spirit told
[50:51] Noah come down is the idea Noah into the
[50:54] ark song laughs you know the story of
[50:58] Noah is criticized surveillance probably
[51:01] they criticize the size of the arc in
[51:05] chemo she only laughs how did all the
[51:08] animals fit on that Ark do this anymore
[51:11] and how did they breathe
[51:15] and how did they get rid of the waste
[51:17] the waste of the animals how did they
[51:20] dispose of the waste disease on big and
[51:24] so the scientists criticized the story
[51:28] but you know Jesus said as it was in the
[51:31] days of Noah so shall it means that we
[51:33] could have become little Jesus see the
[51:36] story of Noah this is really a little
[51:38] annoying
[51:39] but you know the problem with the
[51:41] scientists available work is on this is
[51:43] they're looking at it from an
[51:45] intellectual standpoint
[51:46] Pirogov a complaint in Excel but the
[51:49] whole story is supernatural put this
[51:51] growl is so natural and it is super
[51:55] [Music]
[51:57] super natural connects when we live by
[52:02] faith don't matter how the animals
[52:06] breathe put a prophet in the belly of
[52:11] the whale Jesus believed that story too
[52:21] God could have fed those animals he who
[52:26] broke in fed 5000 myth young leaves and
[52:30] he took care of everything that needed
[52:31] taken care of him at heart he's funded
[52:34] it was super can you say Amen the Bible
[52:41] also says when Jesus descended into hell
[52:45] after they crucified him John will fill
[52:47] up how many knows that but he will to
[52:49] help us Jonah was in the belly of the
[52:54] whale for three days coming from the
[52:56] puzzle and what did he do he preached to
[53:00] the souls in prison either pre-show
[53:02] salmon that would not repent in the days
[53:05] of Noah could say like this is all
[53:07] depends upon people don't know the story
[53:09] of Noah was true can you say man and so
[53:15] in the days of Noah it only jeweled
[53:17] annoy it was a day like this day
[53:20] the Spirit of the Lord said I will not
[53:22] always strive with man in his pages in
[53:25] your VP but his day shall be a hundred
[53:27] and twenty years old a long song and
[53:31] that man had corrupted his way among the
[53:34] earth along my victim Bible said his
[53:37] thoughts were continually evil a
[53:39] liability case upon say that violence
[53:43] had filled the land he loved asleep if
[53:45] you'd only be and God and seemed that he
[53:48] could do no more with man did yoga
[53:50] Dakini fit our premium Victor look the
[53:52] Bible said Noah found grace in the eyes
[53:54] and a God who no ever because God is
[53:57] searching looking for somebody who chef
[54:00] sir this word stand in this generation
[54:05] and stand for God he pulled up with this
[54:08] young orphan senior out of the millions
[54:10] God found Noah he didn't even know God
[54:15] sent Noah warning a drop of a novella he
[54:18] said the end of all flesh has come upon
[54:20] a reticule I found a picture Noah sees a
[54:24] vision in the way of univision and when
[54:26] he sees the vision in love he sees an
[54:30] ark love loves a great mammoth vessel
[54:36] vastly go and he sees how to make it and
[54:41] build it I love you come on the vehicles
[54:44] truth it does and what it is it is a way
[54:47] for people to escape his appearance
[54:49] Truman the judgment God is gonna send on
[54:53] the earth this is Munky two different
[54:55] ways because mercy always goes before
[54:58] judgment must be like let me sit before
[55:03] God brings judgment he always sends a
[55:06] message of grace and other sacred
[55:07] universe which is more you don't what to
[55:09] do so massage the glass but it's it's
[55:11] only to those who want mercy if it was
[55:14] you us this one grace mercy of God
[55:22] so God gives him a lot of time I don't
[55:24] Julia I've been able to do Tom now know
[55:26] what the Bible says in Hebrews eleven
[55:28] lability don't it would let Noah by
[55:32] faith built this Ark we know apples -
[55:34] laughs powerful so God says it's gonna
[55:36] rain
[55:38] it had never rained in the history of
[55:40] mankind in every popular evolved on his
[55:43] brother Noah by faith look out know if I
[55:46] laugh I saw the storm clouds he saw the
[55:51] judgments of God coming his heart began
[55:54] to beat with God he knew that there was
[55:58] something coming every Texas tyranny no
[56:00] one was looking into the unseen realm no
[56:03] God no I was in tune with God he
[56:08] believed God's Word he that before the
[56:12] rain started home don't you
[56:14] and by faith he prepared an ark people
[56:17] articles through the Bible said Noah
[56:20] moved with fear
[56:21] Eli because it you know we have for you
[56:23] a clue and you know you can't fear
[56:25] unless you have faith
[56:27] I'm what you see because the fear of God
[56:30] is the beginning of wisdom I still I
[56:32] can't deduce it Lucas why would you here
[56:35] because you believe what a reverential
[56:42] fear Lord I believe your word I don't
[56:49] know what rain is but if you said it's
[56:52] coming I believe it you say judgments
[56:57] come and I believe know begins to
[57:01] prepare himself put yourself for Noah
[57:06] shoes we're living in the last days and
[57:10] the Bible tells us the signs of the time
[57:13] either people followed this but face
[57:16] must have works properly so face must
[57:19] have action until night if you believe
[57:23] God you can't stay as you are
[57:26] you'll pick up your hammer and nails and
[57:29] go to work
[57:31] we'll go to action Noah build an ark no
[57:37] apples peel out to the saving of his
[57:39] household we can't be selfish gooeys
[57:48] when we give our hearts to the Lord it
[57:51] is to the saving of our home your saving
[57:54] of our children the saving of our
[57:57] branches Noah sells his farm in the way
[58:02] I won't do so and he takes the money and
[58:05] he begins building they aren't the ones
[58:08] that comes to me laughs and I want you
[58:10] to notice something
[58:12] those first believers was his children
[58:15] Lamia quarreled annoyed because they saw
[58:18] faith in Hashem and I don't believe it
[58:22] was the preaching so much that convinced
[58:27] them if but they saw by his life he
[58:32] believed television we should be casting
[58:36] out everything that besides us every sin
[58:43] ready and as he began to build that Ark
[58:48] he sold everything you know that's the
[58:52] first thing Jesus said you've got to
[58:55] forsake everything chewed up on the
[58:57] officials in order to walk with God lost
[59:00] haven't you and as they saw their dad
[59:02] moved with fear he's on all the sudden
[59:07] that faith jumped off of Noah onto his
[59:09] sons why don't you get discouraged you
[59:13] just keep working on the hard buckle
[59:16] your children are watching you children
[59:20] are watching you your family is watching
[59:24] you if I'm Eva Sylvain you just do what
[59:27] God tells you to do a Jew before don't
[59:30] you soften your faith because of
[59:32] unbelief
[59:44] [Music]
[59:51] where do we begin with the rudder in the
[1:00:05] blue it was in the steering wheel there
[1:00:32] is no way to humanly govern this how do
[1:00:52] we build it Papa this is a God
[1:00:55] constructed art it must be built
[1:00:59] according to the instructions before
[1:01:02] sweet and God's church is not built by
[1:01:06] man is filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:19] it will take us to the new land
[1:01:23] watch the instructions and the materials
[1:01:28] they set out yeah no there's there's a
[1:01:32] bunch of Oaks here on this part of the
[1:01:34] property
[1:01:35] besides video and there's hardwoods over
[1:01:38] here hardwoods yeah ash maple new
[1:01:43] blog basically and he said no no no not
[1:01:46] according to what
[1:02:02] it's like a sponge if we build a boat
[1:02:08] and cut it down another tree we're gonna
[1:03:05] get the pitch out of the tree it
[1:03:34] produced the Holy Spirit he took the
[1:03:38] life out of that tree warded off this
[1:03:42] tree go for what sucks it in into what
[1:03:47] big affair why did you come here this
[1:03:49] morning just soak it in
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:46] when they pull it in it makes it as hard
[1:04:49] as steel I imagine many of boat makers
[1:04:55] were saying that man is nuts
[1:04:57] he lost his rocker sit on my belt but I
[1:05:01] want you to notice God knew exactly what
[1:05:04] he was talking about now the word
[1:05:05] pinched in the Bible is an interesting
[1:05:08] word it's not like because the word
[1:05:10] pitch in Genesis songs is the same word
[1:05:14] used in Leviticus still mm okay is it
[1:05:17] only before atonement and so the words
[1:05:30] are the same
[1:05:30] I'll only mostly men so when they poured
[1:05:33] the pitch upon the Ark of his armies
[1:05:36] dude it's still like inside and out
[1:05:40] meaning there was an atonement that
[1:05:43] stood between them and the judgment the
[1:05:45] penile yells on for a lesion there is an
[1:05:48] atonement that stands between you and
[1:05:50] the wrath of God you are seal the ll did
[1:05:54] you
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:52] there's the ark last was like the
[1:07:35] Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:07:37] it had three levels love upon evil and
[1:07:40] the third floor in it was the first
[1:07:44] floor was creeping things super
[1:07:45] musically the second floor was fowls of
[1:07:48] the air 740 police were knowing his
[1:07:53] family alone noise - and in that floor
[1:07:57] there was a window in Familia V infinite
[1:08:00] and in that window
[1:08:07] the light and power in a glass your soul
[1:08:20] girl if they were discouraged hearing
[1:08:23] the screams outside walk under that
[1:08:27] light if Bibble got bit they cannot look
[1:08:29] sideways no little cop which really got
[1:08:33] the old we get discouraged when we look
[1:08:35] at each other
[1:08:36] no keep your eye single their souls I
[1:08:50] hope you know 120 years saw something
[1:08:56] Noah kept the faith
[1:08:57] no I got the love we all start out
[1:08:59] strong but we got to withstand the test
[1:09:04] of time

[1:09:36] brother branham said Noah stood in the
[1:09:38] door of the ark come on boy it's a hard
[1:09:42] day's work

[1:13:50] be destroyed again why and the spirit is
[1:15:13] crying come Holy Spirit is crafter the
[1:15:19] prophetic ministry the Bible said God
[1:15:22] not willing that any would perish make
[1:15:28] believers from hanging around they are
[1:15:32] everybody is watching all the sudden
[1:15:37] there's a strange atmosphere people
[1:15:53] brother branham told a story about a
[1:15:57] horse
[1:15:57] he's 12 did you see father Brennan was
[1:15:59] in the field with his daddy plowing
[1:16:01] phlebotomy people on the shore Vicks and
[1:16:03] he said all the sudden essaouira started
[1:16:05] snorting that did you cool Lucy by local
[1:16:07] mafia
[1:16:08] and brother branham said what's wrong
[1:16:10] with the horses
[1:16:11] Disick wafak said is there a coyote up
[1:16:14] there that the yeah pickles loads he
[1:16:18] said
[1:16:19] No he said there's a storm coming no
[1:16:22] young brother branham said but there's
[1:16:24] no clouds falling upon us it's typically
[1:16:27] Sonny Mays yeah literally he said his
[1:16:29] dad wiped his sweat off his forehead
[1:16:32] said you got a lot to learn
[1:16:34] that's it you drop all the horses have
[1:16:37] an instinct from God let me see
[1:16:39] following this weather you can see the
[1:16:41] storm or not voila
[1:16:43] God gives a warning to LA I felt and
[1:16:46] they'll head to the barns assure the
[1:16:48] world evil evil and brother branham said
[1:16:51] if God will give a horse enough sense to
[1:16:54] get to the barn he'd rip into me
[1:16:56] I saw what about us as sons and
[1:16:58] daughters of God don't mean if that God
[1:17:01] would speak Jubilee little girl and not
[1:17:04] only that but give us a place to wrap
[1:17:06] your hopes up if the name of the Lord is
[1:17:10] a strong tower just a young boy a young
[1:17:16] security you know there was a tsunami
[1:17:19] tsunami and they saw the elephant's run
[1:17:23] to high ground is on Felicity for Lanka
[1:17:32] in Thailand the Buffalo run to the high
[1:17:35] grade Montelongo Monty so there's an
[1:17:39] instinct in an animal notice in Genesis
[1:17:44] 7 1 / Martino Genesis estate and the
[1:17:47] Lord said unto Noah a judge

[1:21:38] sermon in the door let me tell you Jesus
[1:21:42] said I am the door and the door of
[1:21:46] salvation was opened that you cannot
[1:21:51] measure that door and God is crying come
[1:21:55] down and that aren't his Christ and when
[1:22:00] the last animal come in it off get it
[1:22:02] done you money don't think we know all
[1:22:03] of Noah's family we didn't clap I need
[1:22:06] in the way don't they know what turned
[1:22:08] this back Noah and all of a sudden the
[1:22:13] door by itself
[1:22:18] everyone got shivers when the last one
[1:22:30] came in
[1:22:31] luckily dummy it don't play God the
[1:22:35] Bible tells us in Matthew 25 that when
[1:22:38] the wise fool a virgins win in love girl
[1:22:41] if users God there will be a time where
[1:22:47] God shuts the door
[1:22:48] you're on told you were filming and the
[1:22:50] opportunities if there's a speck of
[1:22:55] God in your heart you need to come while
[1:22:57] he's calling now Jesus said as it was in
[1:23:03] the days of Noah she's really remember
[1:23:05] so sure that we in the coming of the Son
[1:23:07] of Man you do man showing that Noah's
[1:23:11] days would repeat again in our days more
[1:23:13] concretely don't do noise no the
[1:23:17] half-way believers the Saudis don't wail
[1:23:20] they were scared of a pill and they said
[1:23:23] you know we'll stay close to the ark
[1:23:25] because no is a good man and but Noah
[1:23:31] couldn't shut the door the Bible said he
[1:23:37] shuts the door no man can okay so the
[1:23:42] halfway believers turn around before
[1:23:44] diesel I couldn't sleep that night
[1:23:47] they're nervous and the next morning
[1:23:50] they wake up
[1:23:54] and so they're like oh there was no and
[1:23:58] then the second day there was no rain
[1:24:00] but third day there was no and everyone
[1:24:07] just went back to their normal I hate
[1:24:09] cyclically don't love you know my but on
[1:24:12] the seventh day they heard thunder in
[1:24:15] the distance they saw lightning on the
[1:24:18] sky dark clouds of judgment begin to
[1:24:23] roll in and all the sudden it started
[1:24:28] raining and the borderline believers
[1:24:32] took off running to the ark and they're
[1:24:39] screaming and the rain is getting
[1:24:44] heavier the sewers are filling out the
[1:24:51] sewers are filling up everything bit
[1:24:54] houses begin to wash away school houses
[1:24:58] begin to wash away because these
[1:25:00] churches begin to wash away
[1:25:04] poor running out to the high heels
[1:25:10] waters gushing river people are losing
[1:25:15] their babies and their families the
[1:25:20] people are screaming they're gone there
[1:25:24] was a lot of those that made their own
[1:25:26] boats yeah baby
[1:25:27] one day though trying to get all just
[1:25:33] swallowed their bonus waters grew higher
[1:25:39] you find as it keeps rising people
[1:25:44] screaming and there say hear the wrath
[1:25:47] of God outside of the Ark is all don't
[1:25:50] really care but every every inch of that
[1:25:53] Ark has patrol men between them and the
[1:25:58] judgment of God and they're saying
[1:26:01] popper you sure it's gonna hold
[1:26:04] he said it's it's going to hold we
[1:26:07] survived in you I did it exactly to the
[1:26:10] world and all of a sudden I hear
[1:26:15] creaking and all the sudden they aren't
[1:26:20] breaks loose and the waters that was
[1:26:24] judging the people is lifted no above
[1:26:28] the judgment he lives on the way it
[1:26:32] stands between you and God revelation
[1:26:43] upon the judgments of God of the earth
[1:26:48] begin to break forth the wrath of God is
[1:26:54] tearing the earth going over the
[1:26:57] mountains
[1:26:57] well did you have floppy leaves so
[1:27:00] powerful
[1:27:01] the wrath of God that the earth that
[1:27:04] once stood up and down was tilted
[1:27:08] through the whole earth out of course
[1:27:10] that there is it before me and the
[1:27:13] floods came the Bible said them all the
[1:27:18] way that ark was built according to the
[1:27:23] sayeth the Lord
[1:27:24] sit down sit people's width in all don't
[1:27:28] try to meet the judgments of God with a
[1:27:30] man-made experience they say if I don't
[1:27:32] go on finishes what did you mean you
[1:27:34] must have a God constructed enough hua
[1:27:37] Zhu come to know God constructed
[1:27:40] experience do come comes to do you must
[1:27:44] be born again by the Spirit of the Lord
[1:27:46] we do that when a de novo dissipated
[1:27:49] we're on the brim of a terrific judgment
[1:27:53] and God is calling us out of every
[1:27:56] denomination
[1:27:58] because man main boats won't hold us
[1:28:01] currently back to freedom and only the
[1:28:04] Bible says there's one church and it's
[1:28:08] the church Jesus ball it really glitters
[1:28:10] and Jesus is the boss of that church
[1:28:14] there is only one church going in the
[1:28:17] rapture nothing silly please and that's
[1:28:19] his church you gotta be a part of
[1:28:22] history if you want to race from the
[1:28:25] grave you gotta be a part of that one
[1:28:29] church no matter whether you're a
[1:28:32] Baptist or a cap denomination man made
[1:28:38] 40,000 denominations law my fear God
[1:28:42] misdemeanor divided men against
[1:28:45] themselves but God has one church and he
[1:28:50] purchased that church by his own blood
[1:28:54] specifically it's okay by one spirit
[1:28:56] where it ties to be born again
[1:29:04] way to save us to the door God is
[1:29:46] calling the pure in heart God is calling
[1:29:50] the righteous if you feel a tug in your
[1:29:54] heart for more god that's God calling
[1:29:58] you to himself Baylor last night
[1:30:01] everything and run to him a bond uncle
[1:30:03] Joseph cool very God is calling us out
[1:30:06] before the Tribulation Period soon as I
[1:30:09] fell on the Avila the spirit and the
[1:30:12] bride say come
[1:30:13] live in leepu's the spirits had come
[1:30:16] down into the ark the same spirit that
[1:30:20] won't Noah is the say of spirits warning
[1:30:25] you this morning many people say things
[1:30:29] that the spirit doesn't say but the
[1:30:33] spirit only speaks the word spirit in
[1:30:37] the bride say come
[1:30:38] it is really positive because the bride
[1:30:41] is saying the same thing the Spirit is
[1:30:43] saying bastard'll is really and the
[1:30:46] Spirit is saying the same thing the word
[1:30:48] is because they're afraid that bear
[1:30:51] record in heaven of yet what you want
[1:30:53] come on the father the spirit world is
[1:30:57] these three are one
[1:31:00] God has prepared an ark to
[1:31:02] applicationnow in that Ark is Christ is
