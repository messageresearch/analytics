[13:42] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[13:46] man availeth much amen I read another
[13:51] portion of scripture Matthew 21 verse 21
[13:56] and 22 Matthew
[14:01] 21 I read this 21 and 22 jesus answered
[14:17] and said unto them verily I say unto you
[14:21] if he have faith and doubt not ye shall
[14:26] not only do this which is done to the
[14:28] fig tree but also if ye shall say unto
[14:31] this mountain be thou removed and be
[14:34] thou cast into the sea it shall be done

[14:50] for your words of assurance tonight
[14:52] tonight we have come before you in
[14:54] prayer Lord may we receive all that we
[14:58] pray for tonight in Jesus name Amen
[15:09] 2:9 I have a shot excitation the most
[15:17] powerful weapon that's the title of my
[15:20] citation the most powerful weapon
[15:25] hallelujah last week last Sunday pastor
[15:31] was telling us the problem said the day
[15:36] that a bride will recognize who she is
[15:40] she'll be raptured amen beloved I also
[15:47] want to add to that by saying that the
[15:50] day that the believer the bride of Jesus
[15:53] Christ will recognize the weapon that
[15:57] the Lord has placed in our hands she
[16:00] will become a mighty conquering army and
[16:04] no power can stand before him or before
[16:08] amen
[16:11] beloved the Lord has placed in our hands
[16:15] since the creation of this world man has
[16:19] made so many different types of weapons
[16:23] our Elias weapons where weapons that we
[16:27] made to subdue our environment because
[16:32] the Le man was a gatherer and hunter so
[16:37] we relied on wildlife and we needed
[16:39] weapons that we could use to bring down
[16:43] wildlife is that right
[16:45] I've watched some documentaries on
[16:48] ancient America they the age of the
[16:51] mammal and how the Le people came to
[16:54] this land and how they hunted all these
[16:56] vices and all the animals that were
[16:59] there starting from very crude
[17:02] instruments that we started making up to
[17:05] today's high-tech laser-guided bombs the
[17:09] hardiek oh yeah laser-guided and we have
[17:12] hydrogen bombs atomic bombs there right
[17:15] but I'm saying that in the hands of a
[17:19] believer God has placed a weapon that is
[17:23] mightier than any hydrogen bomb only if
[17:28] you come to the realization that this is
[17:32] what I have let me know enemy can stand
[17:39] before us hallelujah no enemy you see we
[17:47] read a story about David you have so
[17:49] many minutes but just a very simple
[17:51] meaning David was very sure about a
[17:55] weapon that he had in his hand
[17:58] David knew that that weapon brought down
[18:02] a bear David knew that there were Paul
[18:07] brought down a lion
[18:09] now if the weapon could bring down a
[18:11] bear if that weapon could bring down a
[18:14] lion then who is this uncircumcised
[18:19] Philistine that he should defy the
[18:22] armies of the Living God
[18:25] very much saying that that realization
[18:29] was in David so when King so-called
[18:32] invited David and King Saul told David
[18:35] that I have better weapon than you have
[18:38] you can go home with my shield you can
[18:41] go with my war hammocks you can go with
[18:44] this David or them you wanted to move I
[18:48] said I have not proved them I can go in
[18:50] there please know what I use to conquer
[18:53] the lion
[18:54] this is not what I use to conquer the
[18:56] bay let me go in the one I trust and I'm
[19:00] saying that David has that realization
[19:03] of what a slingshot does that's all the
[19:06] weapon he had a slingshot he didn't have
[19:08] a sword he didn't have a spear he didn't
[19:11] have a shield all he had was a slingshot
[19:13] and he knows what he does hallelujah and
[19:16] I'm saying that God has placed in your
[19:20] hands a weapon that is mightier than
[19:23] David's slingshot God has placed in your
[19:28] hands a weapon that is mightier than any
[19:30] depth in a scientific lab can affect
[19:35] hallelujah
[19:36] the problem is have we how do we
[19:40] identify have we recognized our weapon
[19:43] that is the problem once we recognize
[19:46] that way upon no enemy can stand before
[19:48] us hallelujah
[19:53] last time when I spoke to you I was
[19:56] telling you about Moses how Moses went
[20:00] into Egypt
[20:01] and you know that Moses didn't go into
[20:05] Egypt with any a me he had no army it
[20:09] was a one-man invasion one man he
[20:16] invaded the mighty country of the day
[20:20] which was Egypt at that time the most
[20:23] the strongest country they had the
[20:26] strongest army that ruled the world was
[20:29] Egypt and David invaded our land with
[20:32] only a stick in his hand but he had thus
[20:38] said the Lord and he conquered fear
[20:46] pharoh's army got drowned in the Red Sea
[20:51] hallelujah
[20:52] so beloved in the same way James is
[20:55] telling us tonight that God has placed
[20:58] in your hands something that should
[21:01] conquer your afflictions should conquer
[21:04] your diseases and sicknesses something
[21:07] that you conquer all the troubles that
[21:09] you have I wish I could ask top and
[21:13] raise an old-fashioned Pentecost our
[21:16] prayer time and we all pray together
[21:18] that's all that we need amen beloved
[21:23] problem said that in church we can sing
[21:29] too much he said in church you can jump
[21:33] and dance too much but there is one
[21:36] thing that when you do I say Krishna you
[21:39] are never out of order it's when you
[21:41] pray there is nothing like life pretty
[21:43] too much oh let me read that to you so
[21:46] you see that's not my word in the
[21:54] message
[21:57] birth pains LeBron said you know we
[22:01] could sing too much in paragraph 31 said
[22:04] we could shout too much till we get
[22:07] house and we could sing at the wrong
[22:10] time or shouts at the wrong time but
[22:15] here is one thing we are never out of
[22:17] order when we are praying hallelujah
[22:22] I will that men pray everywhere lifting
[22:24] up holy hands without doubt I mean that
[22:27] scripture coaching from Romans yeah so
[22:31] beloved God has placed something very
[22:34] powerful in our hands
[22:36] amen only if we know how to use it
[22:39] because that slingshot in the hand of
[22:43] David is a mighty weapon but a slingshot
[22:48] in the hand of Saul is useless
[22:52] amen so even though God has placed
[22:55] prayer in his word as a weapon to the
[22:59] believer because he said that we read
[23:01] that in Matthew he says that whatsoever
[23:04] he asked in prayer he said what what so
[23:09] ever ready we are limiting God
[23:14] hallelujah I say we are limiting God he
[23:20] said whatsoever you ask in prayer look
[23:25] if you ask and you do not doubt not only
[23:29] what is done to this victory but you can
[23:32] also tell the amount to be removed
[23:36] amen and we cast into the sea and it
[23:40] shall be
[23:42] that's God's Word will Abraham said this
[23:46] is the scripture that he found difficult
[23:49] to preach about said he found he say he
[23:53] always kept it the one in in Mack where
[23:58] he says that whatever way if you have
[24:00] faith as tell this mountain and it will
[24:03] obey Robert said he always skipped a
[24:07] scripture
[24:09] until God's time came when he knew that
[24:12] a scripture was real it meant when he
[24:17] exercised that power of the spoken word
[24:19] in the Dead Pool and he saw that that
[24:21] scripture was real when God asked him to
[24:24] speak his book and there was a Squealer
[24:26] and he shot it when in Colorado he was
[24:29] the same being to the camp and God asked
[24:31] him to go back during the blizzard and
[24:34] he spoken I mean you know the five
[24:36] things that happened what he termed a
[24:41] powder smoking where the Dead Pool
[24:43] hallelujah
[24:45] so brethren it's not just prayer but it
[24:51] says effectual fervent prayer
[24:54] not just anybody praying but a righteous
[24:57] man pray hallelujah
[25:03] if the prayer has to be effectual I had
[25:05] to be fervent and it has to be a
[25:09] righteous man praying amen so I was
[25:14] looking up the meaning of the word
[25:16] effectual of course a firearm is
[25:19] effective that is the right and fervent
[25:21] and when I looked up I was reading how
[25:25] where did that word come from and the
[25:28] literature says that the word is
[25:30] translated from a Greek word that is an
[25:32] air hue which is the same way as energy
[25:36] so both effectual and fervent are
[25:39] translated from the same Greek word and
[25:41] then you which means energy amen so see
[25:46] when we pray there has to be that image
[25:50] in a prayer it may it has to be a
[25:57] desperate thing let me put it like this
[26:01] we I mean most of you have had kids or
[26:05] you have kids at home a child I just
[26:08] walked past you and says dad can I have
[26:11] some chocolate tonight and that's walks
[26:12] pass you you are you are very likely not
[26:15] to take that as serious I mean the
[26:18] child's requests you are very likely not
[26:20] to pay attention to it
[26:22] it wasn't said in passing it's alright
[26:24] but if a child were to walk to you that
[26:27] you have a request even if you didn't
[26:30] want to another request and the chart
[26:32] keeps bugging us you say VA keeps
[26:36] putting pressure on you asking you
[26:38] persistently daddy answer by me this
[26:41] daddy I said eventually as long as it is
[26:44] within your means you might alligator
[26:46] give that in to that child okay so they
[26:49] just say prayer cannot be said just
[26:53] casually just
[26:54] Florrie words casually the right so he
[27:00] says the prayer has to be effective it
[27:05] means that there is a prayer that is not
[27:07] effective yeah
[27:09] there is a prayer that is not effective
[27:14] prayer has to be passionate it has to be
[27:19] very passionate you really must mean
[27:22] what you are talking about when you are
[27:24] thanking God about your salvation you
[27:26] really must be sure you should look back
[27:29] and see where you were coming from you
[27:31] look at the world the condition of the
[27:32] world how the world is blinded to this
[27:35] grace and what God has done for you how
[27:39] is it that you are not on the street
[27:41] naked how is that you are not on the
[27:47] street following after all this wedding
[27:49] Hollywood fashion I knew better than
[27:53] those who are on the street and you
[27:56] better than all these crazy things that
[27:59] tattoos and all these things that people
[28:02] I mean all these crazy things are you
[28:04] better than those people no it's grace
[28:09] so you have two meaningful for me I look
[28:15] at it I mean I asked myself how could
[28:18] God how is it that God sent somebody
[28:25] that
[28:26] was not even born in my part of the
[28:28] world was born 10,000 kilometres away
[28:33] somewhere in Kentucky
[28:34] raised in America how come that is truth
[28:39] this grace crossed my path
[28:43] it's grace it's grace
[28:48] so when you come to that realization and
[28:51] you are thanking God for hard core has
[28:52] done for you you I mean it's not
[28:56] something that you say lightly it's not
[28:58] something that is it that is why this
[29:01] message is prayer must not just be
[29:03] repetition of ways see that's why we
[29:07] don't like the Pentecostals do you go to
[29:09] pray and everybody says in speaking an
[29:11] unknown tongue I don't know where I've
[29:13] not been to someone this pentacle such
[29:15] as you see end let us pray that cannot
[29:20] be prayer amen
[29:23] because if tongues is poking in the
[29:25] church the Bible says and let it be by
[29:29] two or three and let one interpret but
[29:34] if there is no interpreter let the
[29:36] person who is speaking be silent and
[29:38] that is what Co D teaches in this
[29:42] message and that is all we believe
[29:43] hallelujah so prayer has to be something
[29:51] you have to recognize what weapon you
[29:54] have in your hand
[29:55] if you are talking all have to recognize
[29:57] the work of grace that's taking place in
[29:59] your life
[30:01] Alleluia whether you could have been a
[30:04] you grabbing a drug peddler amen you
[30:10] could have been in jail so several times
[30:16] you could have been a drunk on the
[30:19] streets a homeless person somewhere you
[30:26] could have been a
[30:28] but his grace is Grace you could have
[30:35] been very rich and don't know that that
[30:39] is even a god even this beauty
[30:42] I think someone somebody died and said
[30:46] they should preserve him in liquid
[30:49] nitrogen's alright so that is he thinks
[30:52] that science is going to come out with a
[30:55] cure for or something or some medication
[30:58] that can resurrect the dead so they
[31:00] should embarrass him as you keep in
[31:01] liquid nitrogen so when science comes
[31:03] out of that is it forgotten a name is it
[31:05] yeah
[31:06] found out Disney or something like that
[31:09] so his body is preserved waiting for
[31:11] resurrection by science Oh hallelujah
[31:14] but I know I have something that even if
[31:17] I die and I'm buried in the ground
[31:20] hallelujah there is a power that to
[31:22] raise me up from the ground
[31:26] amen
[31:27] Brennan Elijah was dead buried and
[31:33] Israel was at war and Amy had attacked
[31:38] them and they were going to bury another
[31:39] person and they hurriedly went and
[31:42] dumbed the person in the tomb where
[31:45] Elijah was buried when the dead bodies
[31:48] the dead body touched the Bulls of
[31:50] Elijah Elijah the dead body resurrected
[31:53] well that is the power and anointing in
[31:56] a servant of God I don't need no science
[32:00] no liquid nitrogen to to whip me up
[32:05] hallelujah so beloved prayer has to be
[32:10] passionate now we said I says the
[32:15] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[32:18] man and this is where a lot of believers
[32:20] carry wrong amen
[32:23] so it's only some holy man somewhere
[32:25] that can pray
[32:26] oh listen righteous man I'm too full of
[32:29] sin I cannot pray it's not true well
[32:32] Brian Brian said a righteous man is not
[32:35] a sinless man it's not a man that has no
[32:38] commission there is none of
[32:40] us even after outward of the Holy Spirit
[32:43] even after Pentacles the Apostles still
[32:47] did commit mistakes they still had
[32:50] misunderstanding as long as we live in
[32:53] this flesh as long as we live in this
[32:57] flesh we are going to have trouble the
[33:02] call we came into this flesh to be
[33:03] tempted but when this earthly Tabernacle
[33:06] is dissolved there is one that is
[33:09] waiting for us in that one we can't we
[33:12] can't see we can't make mistakes
[33:15] it's a perfect one this is not a perfect
[33:17] one hallelujah
[33:20] so as long as we dwell in this they are
[33:23] going to be arrows they are going to be
[33:25] mistakes but that is not what the
[33:28] scripture means by a righteous man
[33:31] Reverend said a righteous man a man is a
[33:37] man who confesses he sees to a righteous
[33:42] God and the righteous God is just its
[33:47] merciful to forgive and to cleanse him
[33:53] beloved
[33:54] so don't let any devil don't let any
[33:58] demon make you think that you are too
[34:02] sinful to pray don't let any demon make
[34:08] you think that it's only a holy man I
[34:10] can't pray for you we the Bible says
[34:12] become prefer one another every problem
[34:15] said every minister has a right to pray
[34:18] for the sick it's not only he has a
[34:20] right to pray for the sick amen
[34:23] it all has to do with your level of
[34:26] faith hallelujah
[34:30] so a righteous man it's not somebody who
[34:35] is sinless
[34:36] hallelujah in
[34:41] months after seven verse let me read the
[34:44] scripture to you Romans chapter 7 verse
[34:47] 18 I'm really from here
[35:14] for I know that in me that is in my
[35:17] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[35:21] is present with me but how to perform
[35:24] that which is good I find not for the
[35:28] good that I would I do not but the evil
[35:32] which I would not that I do now if I do
[35:36] that I will not it is no more I that do
[35:40] it but sin that dwelleth in me reading
[35:44] the Bible says that we were all born in
[35:46] sin and as long as we live in this flesh
[35:49] same is in there even after the
[35:54] deliverance of your soul there is still
[35:57] same day hallelujah
[35:59] and that's what Paul is saying Paul has
[36:00] been delivered he was an apostle he was
[36:04] anointed with the Holy Ghost and he's
[36:06] saying that there is still there all
[36:08] nature in him the evil nature he was
[36:11] born with is still in him and that evil
[36:14] nature is fighting that delivers soul
[36:17] and problem put it like this he said he
[36:23] was in a prayer line when he made this
[36:24] Indian man with cowboy boots and hat and
[36:27] everything and he was talking to the man
[36:31] I was asking the man since he believed
[36:35] how has it has the Christian Jaime being
[36:37] so well the man said well there has been
[36:41] two dogs in me they have always been
[36:44] fighting and Bram said so which one wins
[36:48] the fight said the one that I feed the
[36:51] most
[36:54] wherein as long as we feed on this word
[36:56] of God as long as we say no to the
[36:59] things of the world amen there are evil
[37:01] nature that evil desire that every man
[37:04] is born with is going to be served Judy
[37:06] you you can't live like the world
[37:09] hallelujah it is only y-you true the
[37:12] Word of God I will you throw the message
[37:13] away and you feel yourself on this
[37:15] wordly stuff and especially all these
[37:18] video things that the the world is
[37:21] bombarding us with you feel yourself on
[37:24] those things your soul will always be
[37:27] hungry
[37:27] and the evil nature will always ruling
[37:30] you so even after somebody like Paul has
[37:34] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:36] this fight is still going on in him and
[37:39] this fight is going to go on in us until
[37:43] the day when Jesus Christ comes and we
[37:46] are all change in a twinkle of an eye
[37:48] and put on different bodies because
[37:51] these bodies oh my god it's a it's a
[37:56] it's a curse house Oh hallelujah
[37:58] it's a pest house hallelujah I find then
[38:03] a law that when I would do good evil is
[38:07] present with me hallelujah
[38:10] see so beloved a righteous man is not
[38:16] someone who is sinless
[38:18] there's nobody like that but a righteous
[38:22] man let me give you an example there was
[38:25] a day that parabrahma
[38:28] had this tax kiss I mean if I heard
[38:30] about this tax case that he had and they
[38:37] were bugging him I mean do i disturb him
[38:40] the man is peace in his serenity
[38:43] everywhere broblem seats visions and
[38:46] things can bring for break forth at any
[38:48] time so he was worried so one day he was
[38:52] home and a call came true so he told the
[38:57] wife to tell the people that he was not
[38:59] at home so the wife did that see this
[39:02] how sincere and honest a man can be and
[39:05] this out these things around the tips
[39:06] it's not like it's our secret that
[39:08] somebody recorded and he's telling us
[39:10] problem living created oppression for us
[39:13] to think that he lived like a Holy Angel
[39:15] Michael Oher know he was born through
[39:19] the union of a man and a woman and a
[39:21] body bond our way will come of an evil
[39:23] nature even he that never defiled a body
[39:27] because from the age of seven the angel
[39:29] told him don't drink don't smoke don't
[39:32] defile your body go oh you are older you
[39:34] are you have a way to do evil he evil
[39:39] grump the
[39:40] they're grumblings of the evil niche I
[39:42] was still me and the wife picked a call
[39:44] and told them that tax we put the same
[39:46] thing it wasn't long when somebody
[39:50] brought a child to be prayed for he said
[39:52] he went to the child me in his hand and
[39:55] said oh then the spirit spoke so you
[39:58] just told a lie and you want to pray for
[40:00] that sick but you see God is so merciful
[40:05] he has made a provided way all he needs
[40:08] to do is to confess and say Lord and
[40:10] pray to the holy God I forgive him and
[40:13] he went ahead and pray for the child and
[40:15] I tell us well so Gregory it doesn't
[40:20] matter
[40:20] oh I'm not saying this or that we just
[40:23] live anyhow and think that Paul said are
[40:27] we going to continue in sin that grace
[40:29] may abound no see so but if you always
[40:36] come our way things will always happen
[40:39] not willfully but things are you doing
[40:42] tend to do you realize you find yourself
[40:43] too immature but when those things
[40:47] happen the scripture is saying that
[40:48] there is a holy God
[40:50] now you can't confess - you can't
[40:53] confess and pray and that God will
[40:57] forgive you and when that God forgives
[41:01] you it's just as if you didn't do it in
[41:04] the first place so don't let any demon
[41:08] come and hold that against you let me
[41:11] let me read a few few coats to you about
[41:13] these so that you realize it's not my
[41:16] way
[41:26] in a message get people to believe
[41:29] Abraham said the prayer of faith shall
[41:33] save the sick the Lord shall raise him
[41:37] up if he has committed anything okay let
[41:40] me let me jump he said confess your
[41:42] faults one to another and pray one for
[41:43] another that you may be healed they
[41:46] fetch after the prayer of a righteous
[41:48] man availeth much the effectual fervent
[41:51] prayer of a righteous man now a
[41:54] righteous man is not a sinless man just
[41:59] to emphasize what I'm saying that a
[42:00] righteous man is not a sinless man that
[42:03] who are not the same thing Amen see a
[42:06] righteous man is a man who is confessing
[42:09] his sins in a righteous one hallelujah
[42:13] you see see a righteous man
[42:16] now watch to prove it the next verse he
[42:20] says Elias was a man subject to like
[42:23] passions as we are is throwing James
[42:26] when we read when you go down a man such
[42:29] as a man subject to like passions as we
[42:33] are and he prayed earnestly that it
[42:36] might not rain and he read not on the
[42:38] earth by the space of three years and
[42:40] six months a man that has his ups and
[42:43] downs you see a man subject to like
[42:46] passions like us means a man that has
[42:49] what his ups and downs
[42:52] Amen we all know about a life in was it
[42:57] like Elijah his no Elijah the one who
[43:04] who released the Fox the Fox is on the
[43:08] children who were teasing him and Bram
[43:11] said he did that in anger cutting each
[43:16] other were teasing about his bald hair
[43:18] or something like that and it will
[43:20] either bear no Fox yeah he did that in
[43:25] under hallelujah and brahbrah ham used
[43:31] love to conquer the bull and love to
[43:35] conquer the bee
[43:36] there right so he said
[43:39] Elias was a man with his ups and downs
[43:41] just like we do he was not an angel
[43:44] robber I'm saying that he was not an
[43:46] angel and mad and he prayed heavens why
[43:50] shot he prayed heavens were open and if
[43:53] these things were done even before Jesus
[43:57] went to the cross the hot ought to be
[44:01] done in the same time and that was why
[44:04] parabrahma
[44:05] him to come and prove show to us that
[44:11] God is the same yesterday today and
[44:15] forever and in this end time we are
[44:19] promised a double portion of that
[44:21] unknown ting we see there is something
[44:25] that Brian said that I want us to all be
[44:28] pondering over he said in 1906 or sour
[44:34] somewhere at the turn of the last
[44:36] century the believers says in me a
[44:39] spirit that something has to happen
[44:43] something some anointed some powerful
[44:45] board has to come down they realized
[44:48] that they couldn't continue the way they
[44:49] were the way they couldn't continue
[44:52] that's a powerless Church because this
[44:56] ain't I'm right according to the vision
[44:58] that God gave the LeBlanc which is
[45:00] recorded in spoken word his original
[45:03] series also recorded in the church miss
[45:04] messy Church edges this endtime bride
[45:08] must retain to the power of Pentecost
[45:13] she has to be a dynamic said the dynamic
[45:17] power must be found in hair hallelujah
[45:21] so when the bread ring sour us in
[45:25] California Sue's a street when they
[45:28] sense this and started praying brass a
[45:30] morning coup they started praying about
[45:32] this suddenly anointed him down upon
[45:38] them and they started praying in tongues
[45:40] and miracles and power and Pentecost was
[45:43] born in this land in America
[45:48] hallelujah ready so I'm saying these
[45:52] things so that you also realize that we
[45:55] are living at a time as children of
[45:58] promise well we have also been promised
[46:01] that something must happen in armies now
[46:04] if something as happy now means with a
[46:07] brown preach took him after the message
[46:09] talking which he said was the highlight
[46:12] message of his entire ministry which is
[46:15] another outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[46:17] I mean he preached that the next message
[46:18] was desperation says that desperation is
[46:23] the right message that should follow the
[46:25] talking why because it's only a
[46:27] desperate believe it's only a desperate
[46:30] bride that can't get there talking down
[46:34] if we are desperate and we cry out to
[46:38] God talking oh come now when Israel was
[46:43] locked up in Egypt in slavery and the
[46:47] taskmaster had increased all the I mean
[46:53] yeah daily work and all the things that
[46:56] he have to do what did they do they
[46:58] started crying to God they started
[47:00] crying to God and God Himself came down
[47:05] call himself came down go and read
[47:07] Exodus when God met Moses I've heard the
[47:13] cry of my people Israel and I've come to
[47:18] deliver them rendering a Gentile that
[47:25] didn't know anything about Jesus Christ
[47:29] on Elias
[47:30] we read we I preached it the last time
[47:32] agenda by he prayed and the Bible says
[47:37] his prayer became a memoria before God
[47:44] we're in this little group here if we
[47:48] can
[47:49] pray and cry out to God I all know again
[47:53] that they said God on the land
[47:57] hallelujah
[47:58] yeah that Montreat and God had to say
[48:03] him PETA is that right he prayed and God
[48:09] sent him PETA
[48:11] let me give you another one I'd say
[48:14] authority of the word me really said now
[48:22] this is that word you said they were
[48:26] laid hands on the sick and they shall
[48:27] recover and the effectual fervent prayer
[48:30] of a righteous man availeth much now we
[48:34] are not righteous in that we are sinless
[48:36] just I want to baptize that but a
[48:40] righteous man is one who confesses his
[48:42] sins to a righteous and holy God amen
[48:46] and believes by faith then I asked for
[48:51] healing in the name of your child Jesus
[48:56] and that's it believe it look I somebody
[49:03] sent me
[49:04] what's up video the last time and this
[49:07] TL Osborn I'm sure a lot of you have
[49:10] heard about him it was one of these
[49:12] pentacle star preaches and he was
[49:16] talking about what he used to do before
[49:20] he came across with Abraham's message
[49:22] and how his soul I mean he's made this
[49:24] famous statement that all of us we're
[49:27] preaching Jesus Christ but when I met
[49:29] with Abraham I met a man who was living
[49:32] Jesus Christ
[49:33] and that is what God wants where the
[49:38] position God wants we his bride to get
[49:41] to we get to a place where we are not
[49:44] only talking about Jesus Christ but we
[49:46] have experienced him in love that our
[49:48] lives just show for his life that is
[49:55] where we are we need to get desperate
[49:58] unfortunately
[50:01] the spirit of the time is a relaxing
[50:04] spirit everybody's relaxed life is good
[50:10] it meant we have the best things of life
[50:14] right now you can sit in your room and
[50:17] when I was growing up in my country if
[50:20] you want to make a phone call you have
[50:21] to go in queue for like two days before
[50:23] you can call London now within a period
[50:26] of less than 20 years we have moved from
[50:30] that state till you leave in your
[50:32] bedroom I can call any part of the world
[50:33] you can't call somebody in on that and
[50:36] on the at on the article I mean so life
[50:42] has become very comfortable it's too
[50:46] comfortable that we are forgotten about
[50:48] God but it's by God's grace that you and
[50:51] I still know that there is a God it's
[50:55] God's grace because life is too
[50:57] comfortable for us to remember that
[50:59] there is a God hallelujah ministers are
[51:03] very comfortable lives and it's and they
[51:08] still want more comfort they want the
[51:11] latest jetliners I've told you the story
[51:17] but brother
[51:19] throughout the Bible it takes a
[51:21] desperate people to talk to to bring God
[51:25] on the scene on the Sea of Galilee what
[51:30] would Jesus Christ up they were sinking
[51:36] and this us
[51:39] in fish I meant they've been him they've
[51:42] been our uncie they've been fishing all
[51:44] your lives and he met a storm that he
[51:47] could recall true they use all the
[51:51] church they knew how the boat was going
[51:52] down they went and woke him up and
[51:55] rabbahum preached to simmons calling
[51:58] jesus on the scene and awakening jesus
[52:03] when he picked from the sea of galilee
[52:05] scene see christ he was arrested so much
[52:10] in God I didn't even know that there was
[52:11] trouble is when you are resting in
[52:13] Christ when there's any trouble around
[52:15] you not see it so he was resting so much
[52:21] don't you care we perish
[52:24] don't you care we perish he woke up
[52:27] rebuked the sea simple so once he lost
[52:32] won't came out tell me about when TLS
[52:34] one came to Rev run's meeting he said
[52:38] the first lesson that came to the prayer
[52:40] line that was to be prayed for LeBron
[52:42] does ask all of them to be quiet pray
[52:45] with him it was just a short prayer and
[52:48] he was like hey we had we are we are
[52:51] about to we are now he taught that it's
[52:54] not other prayers about establish of
[52:56] what them Pentacles that he was sure
[53:03] that I was all the short prayer that the
[53:04] child needed and the child was healed it
[53:08] meant see he was demonstrating Jesus to
[53:12] us Jesus asked him be quiet be still
[53:16] that was it
[53:19] the storm disappeared of course there
[53:23] were times that Jesus Christ stayed all
[53:24] night to pray yeah what is it that made
[53:29] Jesus to bed across you when Jesus was
[53:34] praising Lord if it is thy will if it is
[53:39] possible let this cup pass over me
[53:41] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[53:45] done what made it possible that somebody
[53:49] who he didn't skip history Oh funny like
[53:51] you and I
[53:53] he knew that glow that's why he was a
[53:55] father sanctify me with a glory that I
[54:00] had with you before the beginning when
[54:03] he's praying
[54:05] talking about the glory had with her
[54:07] father because he came from God
[54:12] he's the logos that came from God he
[54:18] knew who he was he knew your secret of
[54:21] the world amen and yet he had to wait
[54:30] take a shameful dish
[54:33] so it was prayer it was prayer that
[54:40] subdued that demon him who created this
[54:45] universe coming to do this prayer you
[54:48] have to go to prayer in edit in just a
[54:50] minute sorry hallelujah so brethren you
[54:55] see what pray I can do amen
[54:59] now one more thing that I want to talk
[55:04] to on to tell you about prayer prayer
[55:12] during the most difficult thing that can
[55:13] ever happen is for God the creator of
[55:18] the universe to change his mind
[55:25] it doesn't easily happen one time God
[55:30] told Moses that he was going to destroy
[55:35] the whole of Israel and make a new
[55:37] nation out of him and Moses threw
[55:41] himself in a breach I said Lord if you
[55:44] do that and Balarama made us know that I
[55:47] was Christ in Moses that was doing that
[55:51] but there was something that happened in
[55:53] the Bible where a prophet Isaiah was
[55:56] told that King Hezekiah is sick
[56:02] go to the king and tell him that he
[56:04] should set his house in order this
[56:06] sickness
[56:07] not on - life is on to death he's about
[56:09] to die as I went and delivered a message
[56:15] Hezekiah turn his face to the wall
[56:18] say Lord look at the integrity of my
[56:22] heart I have saved you in all
[56:25] faithfulness I've been faithful I've
[56:29] done everything look Ezra has had so
[56:32] many bad kings since the days of David
[56:35] and Solomon he has very bad Kings but
[56:39] since I ascended on to the truth I've
[56:42] restored that Davidic I don't know how
[56:47] to put it
[56:48] commoner back to to to to to to
[56:50] Jerusalem have mercy on me crying
[56:55] pleading pray God came down again and
[57:02] spoke to Isaiah go back and tell
[57:05] Hezekiah I've added 15 years to his
[57:08] years is a Bible what did that prayer so
[57:14] prayer even changes the mind of God if
[57:21] you read some 1819 verse 34 so the Bible
[57:24] says that the things that have gone out
[57:27] of God's mouth God cannot change let me
[57:30] see where I am right with my the
[57:31] scripture I think some 89 I didn't write
[57:37] that down but just new therefore yeah
[57:44] some 89
[57:45] said for say my comment will I not brick
[57:48] no altar that is change the things that
[57:53] is gone out of my lips is that God the
[57:56] God of David speaking true David say
[57:58] that things that are cooking when a
[58:00] prophet says Dasia the Lord that is good
[58:03] to have spoken and as I was God's
[58:05] prophet he went to a king and said that
[58:07] see the Lord do I will do that and God's
[58:11] Word says that when he say something he
[58:13] doesn't change it but I'm just letting
[58:16] just saying this for you to know the
[58:19] power in prayer prayer change the mind
[58:23] of God so if we a contain the mind of
[58:26] God why won't prayer change what the
[58:30] devil is thinking about you
[58:32] why wouldn't prayer change the situation
[58:34] that the devil has pushed you into
[58:36] prayer change it sir brother do not be
[58:42] afraid you have a weapon to change every
[58:45] situation that is my message to you
[58:47] tonight just believe it and accept it
[58:50] and exercise the effect do not be afraid
[58:54] you have something that can change every
[58:57] situation prayer change the mind of God
[59:05] it's not easy
[59:06] God's mind to be changed it's difficult
[59:10] you remember I went even when they be
[59:13] pray I'm not David when Moses prayed
[59:15] when Moses begged God that don't destroy
[59:18] these people and make a nation out of me
[59:20] he still punish them all those who were
[59:22] twenty years and above he destroyed all
[59:24] of them it's only the children that went
[59:26] over to the promised land
[59:28] I look at Hezekiah sprayer very every
[59:34] enemy that is surrounding you I'm saying
[59:37] that pre ahoo
[59:38] defeating prayer will contain the same
[59:42] thing as a car if you read in 2nd 2nd
[59:45] chronicles I think from chapter 3
[59:50] - the Bible talks about the days when
[59:55] Jerusalem was under siege
[59:57] there was an assyrian king called
[1:00:00] sanitary he conquered almost every
[1:00:03] nation he surrounded like eesh
[1:00:06] surrounded Jerusalem and sent messages
[1:00:09] to Hezekiah he said okay let me just
[1:00:14] read that from the Bible as my last part
[1:00:16] then we close we pray and close second
[1:00:24] Chronicle 32 Old Testament yep
[1:00:40] said after these things and the
[1:00:43] establishment there of Sennacherib king
[1:00:46] of Assyria came and entered into Judah
[1:00:49] and they camp against the fence cities
[1:00:52] and taught to win them for himself and
[1:00:56] where has a cast saw that we could jump
[1:01:05] to vast I say after this design a cherub
[1:01:08] king of a serious sent his servants to
[1:01:11] Jerusalem but he himself laid siege
[1:01:14] against black-ish and all his power with
[1:01:17] him onto his a.k.a king of judah and
[1:01:20] unto all judah that way at jerusalem
[1:01:24] saying that's a sanitary oh my god i
[1:01:28] that's it that's man king of assyria
[1:01:33] wearin do you trust that ye abide in the
[1:01:37] siege in jerusalem because the result
[1:01:39] wasn't a siege and Hezekiah and all
[1:01:42] Israel went under in Jerusalem and he
[1:01:45] was wondering hey you under siege why do
[1:01:48] you think that you should live there
[1:01:50] amen does not has a cap persuade you to
[1:01:55] give over yourself to die by famine and
[1:01:58] by test saying the Lord our God shall
[1:02:01] deliver us out of the hand of the king
[1:02:03] of Assyria
[1:02:04] has not the same as a kite taking away
[1:02:07] his high places in his all tests and
[1:02:09] commanded Judah and Jerusalem see each I
[1:02:12] was she before one Alta and been incest

[1:02:30] nation's of those lands anyways

[1:02:35] hand a man is boosting so what was as a
[1:02:39] cash answer look after seven say okay
[1:02:45] it's a natural continuous investment in
[1:02:47] he said he wrote also lettuce trail on
[1:02:50] the Lord God of Israel and to speak
[1:02:53] against him saying as the girls of the
[1:02:55] nations of other lands have not
[1:02:57] delivered their people out of my name's
[1:03:00] social not the god of Hezekiah deliver
[1:03:03] his people out of my neck Oh hallelujah
[1:03:08] amen then they cried with a loud voice
[1:03:14] in the Jews speech on to the people of
[1:03:17] Jerusalem that were on the wall to
[1:03:20] afraid them and to trouble them and be
[1:03:23] my that they might take the city see but
[1:03:27] Luca has a kind prayer that's 20 and for
[1:03:33] this course has occurred a king and a
[1:03:35] prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed
[1:03:38] and cried to heaven and the Lord sent an
[1:03:41] angel which cut off all the mighty men
[1:03:44] of valor and the lilies and the curtains
[1:03:47] in a camp of the king of Assyria amen
[1:03:49] what did they do they prayed they pray
[1:03:53] there are scriptures in Isaiah and I
[1:03:55] think in second Kings not talked about
[1:03:57] this team in detail you come you can
[1:03:59] read this on your own about Priya -
[1:04:02] Priya defeats every enemy say prayer
[1:04:07] defeats every enemy hallelujah
[1:04:15] pria Conchas every affliction prayer
[1:04:21] heals every disease the angel to William
[1:04:26] Brown said nothing shall stand before
[1:04:29] your prayer if only you can get the
[1:04:32] people to believe said not even cancer
[1:04:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:40] forever do we believe that I say do we
[1:04:43] believe that is it not with our lives
[1:04:46] you see the Bible says that these people
[1:04:50] in anxiety is it in Matthew the Bible
[1:04:55] talks about people who try to honor him
[1:04:59] God with their lives but in your hearts
[1:05:03] yeah far away from him all right that is
[1:05:09] why I'm against prayer being just green
[1:05:12] repetition of the same ways so you see
[1:05:19] we are praying to God by your your heart
[1:05:22] is somewhere somewhere else you are in a
[1:05:25] meeting at work now with your children
[1:05:29] somewhere you are your body is in the
[1:05:31] church and you see we are praying that
[1:05:35] is not the kind of prayer we are talking
[1:05:39] about you know one day William Brown was
[1:05:48] in Memphis Tennessee I want to give
[1:05:50] examples about myself so that it doesn't
[1:05:52] look about like I'm boosting so let me
[1:05:56] give you examples of Abraham all we all
[1:05:57] believe is all right of course I can
[1:06:00] give you examples of oprea has done for
[1:06:01] me personally I have won more than 1,000
[1:06:05] examples I've been healed by prayer amen
[1:06:10] I'm healed by prayer I had a group at my
[1:06:13] backside
[1:06:14] I was 1997 I woke I could I cannot sit
[1:06:22] down
[1:06:22] I couldn't sit
[1:06:26] I was carrying a pillow wherever I was
[1:06:29] going I just went to my room and I
[1:06:35] locked myself up in my room I said look
[1:06:38] this thing has to disappear and that
[1:06:44] very day disappeared I never went to any
[1:06:50] doctor they would have given me their
[1:06:55] poison pills I'll absolutely be on those
[1:06:57] pills - today I'm not saying you
[1:07:01] shouldn't go to a doctor we don't
[1:07:03] believe that but I'm saying that
[1:07:06] sometimes the medicines that we are
[1:07:08] giving give us more problem than the
[1:07:09] sicknesses themselves and you know this
[1:07:11] is the doctors ever a genuine oktai will
[1:07:14] admits this himself when Braun went to
[1:07:21] Memphis he was flying somewhere for got
[1:07:24] away he was flying - but he said he went
[1:07:26] to the post office when he was going
[1:07:28] back to his hotel the spirit edged him
[1:07:30] to continue in a different direction so
[1:07:35] he just walk along walk along walk along
[1:07:38] so he came across this black woman
[1:07:40] problem referred to the woman as an old
[1:07:43] auntie Jemima and back then I don't know
[1:07:46] if is still the same back then the South
[1:07:49] because preachers passing so Rara was
[1:07:52] passing and this woman said passin
[1:07:56] LeBron was like do you know me how do
[1:07:59] you know that I'm a person and the woman
[1:08:02] said have you read about Asha non-id
[1:08:05] woman in the Bible said I'm a woman like
[1:08:08] that should not my to mind I didn't have
[1:08:10] a child and I prayed to God for a child
[1:08:13] and I promised God that if I get that
[1:08:16] child I'll raise that child up in a fear
[1:08:19] of the Lord and I did my best but as the
[1:08:22] child grew up joining bad company and
[1:08:25] the child contracted a venereal disease
[1:08:29] syphilis and the doctors have given up
[1:08:32] on him and he's about to die so I was
[1:08:36] praying and God told me I don't that I
[1:08:39] should come
[1:08:39] start here and showed me your picture
[1:08:42] now you will be passing I should call
[1:08:44] you to come and pray for my child same
[1:08:48] yesterday today and forever
[1:08:50] but this is my emphasis when parabrahma
[1:08:53] entered the room with a woman to pray
[1:08:54] for the child LeBron said you could tell
[1:08:58] that that woman when I will master Dupre
[1:09:01] said let me read it to you he said she
[1:09:05] knelt down on the floor if you can read
[1:09:07] this by led by the spirit said she knelt
[1:09:10] down on the floor and she begin pray I
[1:09:12] tell you their old sayings create a
[1:09:16] prayer that you know she was talking to
[1:09:19] God that's my emphasis see the woman
[1:09:23] prayed that if you are also spiritual
[1:09:25] you can know that this woman is talking
[1:09:27] to God you see when we pray what we are
[1:09:29] doing is that we are talking to God said
[1:09:30] communication between you and God
[1:09:34] formerly we couldn't do that it meant we
[1:09:39] couldn't have access God like that you
[1:09:42] have to go to a priest perform some
[1:09:44] sacrifice and all that but when Jesus
[1:09:48] died on the cross the veil was broken
[1:09:51] into so we now have access to the holy
[1:09:54] place so we can contact God so we when
[1:10:00] you know you are talking to God we want
[1:10:02] you iyx out and you have respect for
[1:10:04] your dad like I had when you need
[1:10:07] something you go to Daddy with that
[1:10:09] respect and put your request before
[1:10:13] daddy and I didn't do it for you
[1:10:17] amen so that woman Rob Ramu is a prophet
[1:10:20] said you could tell that that woman was
[1:10:23] talking to God he was not just reciting
[1:10:26] some idea weights so you don't go to
[1:10:29] church and say everybody says Hail Mary
[1:10:32] Mother of God reverse now everybody's
[1:10:36] reciting something hallelujah it may do
