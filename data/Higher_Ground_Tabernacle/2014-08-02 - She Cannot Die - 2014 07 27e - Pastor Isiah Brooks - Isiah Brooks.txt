TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're not going to belong the time we're going to go right into the word of God appreciate our heavenly father for being so merciful to us what will we do without his Mercy I tell you what we better we understand it better by and by we said that this morning that we continue continue the message and uh our second portion is she cannot die but I want to start a little scripture from Exodus please Exodus 23 Exodus 23 I'm so glad to be in the number in that city where the lamb is light that was the song right there amen I can see myself marching to the tomb Oh Glory to God God Amen we're going to read by the grace of God Exodus 23 uh beginning at the 20th verse behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your trans transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemy and an adversary unto thy adversary but my angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites hivites and jebusites and I will cut them off thou shallal not bow to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shal utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be Barren in the land the number of the days will I fulfill and I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom Thou shallal come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivites the Canaanites and the Hittites from before Thee I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and and the Beast of the field multiply against thee by little and little will I drive them out before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land Hallelujah let us pray father God we thank you right now for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and Lord God we appreciate you father for everything that you are doing for us right now there is a mighty revival going on on in our souls Lord oh God and we thank you for it father because it is something that we ourselves could not have done but we thank you for your mercy and your grace we thank you for the love that you have shown to us and father there are no words that can express our gratitude toward you but Hallelujah We Want To Praise Your Name give you glory we pray that you have preeminence here this evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated but first of all we realize amen that we're not alone I heard a song say how can you ever be lonely when you're never alone ain't that amazing how we can say we're lonely yet God says I'm with you am but nevertheless we realize amen that we're living in a trying time brother brandham tells us that this bride in which Jesus Christ has ordained is Invincible she cannot be defeated no more than God can be defeated and we look at this thing and I want you to see what God has done for us he has put us in a place where he we can see his promises uh being fulfilled he tells us that we're in an age of restoration and he goes on and he tells us that all that the Locust the Palmer worm caterpillar all of those four those four stages of worm have eaten he said I shall restore remember brother bradam said that worm ate that tree down to the root but one thing about it it could not die amen why because it was the brid tree amen amen and she was made after the bridegroom tree so you and I must realized by the grace of God that God had all of this in his mind and now we're seeing it unfold before us and it ought to give us how can I said overwhelming joy to see that God's grace is upon us remember brother brandham talks about it and he goes on to tell us about how God shall restore and he takes the king of Egypt and how he saw Sarah and said oh my isn't she's a beautiful old woman now if he had only known her age he might have not have been interested amen but by the grace of God God had changed her back into a young woman amen right he never took away the age he took away the effect of the age and we find out by the grace of God because I'm going tell you something if there was an age called eternity we've been old for a long time but we realize by the grace of God there is no time in eternity and we realize amen that here this King was getting ready to take uh uh uh Sarah for wife and God visited it doesn't tell us what Abraham prayed it doesn't even tell us that Abraham did pray but the point is God was a restorer see he's not only a deliverer he's a restorer and David understood that because David said oh Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation so if we can see God as a restorer we can then understand that if there's anything that we have lost God is I oh my God he's more than able to restore it back aund fold because understand it is Satan who has taken these things from us not Goden my God would work it in in toward your good because the Bible said that all things work together for the good of them that love God is able Amen to work it toward your good because remember though Abraham amen told Sarah to lie look what he left with when he left Egypt amen and he left the king you got to realize he had far more stuff with him donkeys horses cows whatever you call it amen his inheritance was greater now amen because the devil not only had to restore his wife life but he had to uh pay interest on what he took from God or what he took from Abraham he had to pay an interest he had to give an offering Amen to Abraham and Abraham was the one who lied now that's in restoring so I want you to see how blessed you are amen that that no matter what and and we're not telling you to go out here to lie but I want you to understand amen that God will work everything toward your good and his purpose right now we look at this thing and you say Okay I I I I can see that and you understand Satan had to give it back as I say brother bam talks about a a law enforcement just bear with me he talks about how that if if something's gone wrong you can call the police when you can't get it straight now that law would come and enforce that person who's violated your your property or whatever to give it back and he goes on to say Amen that the Holy Ghost is an enforcer and see what it is we think oh when we say Satan take your hands off of her what you fail to see is that your words has now caused God to come on the scene why because he said whatsoever you say believing that you would receive it it's yours now you can't do it but the words you speak bring God on the scene who is the enforcer and he goes to Satan and says my son my daughter just spoke it give it amen hallelujah and he comes and he brings it back to you come on somebody amen now you got to realize amen that God is the enforcer let me explain it brother brandham goes on to say it like this he said the sun forces the life out of the seed the sun which is a type of the s o n the Su N is a type of the s o n everything that can live it is the s n that forces it to happen even even though you don't see it it doesn't matter brother said the pp could be done ran out of the seed it could look dead as all get out but if there's a German of Life there that son will find it and pull it up and cause it to live hallelujah oh Lord have mercy come on somebody I'm not talking about just the seed I'm talking about you I'm talking about you and me amen that's exactly what God has done in your life amen he's found life in you you could have been on the bar in the bar you could have been on the street you could have been all kinds of who Among Us or whatever the case may be but God saw a germ of life in you and that s o and is drawing it right on up right on up you might have looked like a mess amen but that life in you cannot die amen oh Lord have mercy now we look at this thing and we see how God even in nature proves himself look around you people see what God has done and I heard somebody say he's a mastermind right he's a mastermind let's move on now we read that scripture and I wanted to bring those little thoughts out because I want you to understand how and what we're coming into I love this I'm so glad that God didn't shakee me into a Baptist or shape me into a a Holiness or or whatever I'm so glad he didn't shakee me into that amen there was something about me that couldn't be shaped I went along with the program but I couldn't be part of it I couldn't be all they wanted me to be y'all understand what I'm saying because I am the word and that is the only reason why you couldn't do it because you are the word that's what brother an that's what he said he said we are not like Mary who was a carrier of the word he said we the bride we are the word now what do we are we are Jesus Christ in Bride form amen is that right we've said it over and over and over again but I don't understand why people think that Jesus Christ that Miss Jesus Christ will be weaker than Jesus because you got to understand saying it's the same life the same life is now in her is that all right now the prophet of God goes on to tell us the reason why I wanted to say these things because the message is true we should know that because it's now beginning to give us identity it's showing us who we are where we come from where we going and what we shall be really is that right all right now when Paul wrote it he said when he shall appear we'll be just like him but we don't know uh and we'll be like him right but it's not said on what we be what it's going to really be like but the prophet of God because remember brother the word of God said when the Holy Spirit Come the truth he'll not only show us things present but he'll show us things to come how can he show us things to come he has to have a prophet amen the prophet is the one that bring brings the message and shows us things to come amen so now is telling us in this future home I'm just saying because I've listened to a lot of things but he's not only telling us who we are where we fit in the picture where are we going to be how it's going to be come on somebody listen it is a deep message but the thing about it it is fulfilling the scripture amen that he'll show us things to come am and he gives us an identity to let us see that we are just like Jesus Christ amen is that all right he brings out to us that we are completely Justified as though we have never sinned in the first place you know people don't believe that there are so many people who says amen but don't believe it you know why because they still in the seventh Church age Hallelujah but when you in the eighth age or you come to that Holy convocation something has taken a hold of you and you're no longer Earthbound amen right you're sailing with the astronauts now right now listen what brother said here in the restoration of the Bride tree he said all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop her amen no communism no Catholicism no nothing else will stop it I will restore said the Lord all the man-made Roman trees will never hang in there all the graves will never keep it in there all the big denom ation Stones laying at the door will never keep it in there I will restore say the Lord is that right that's the whole point about these stones of unbelief that that that are now sealing churches in what it is he he want the body to stay there he don't want the stone to be roll away but I got news for him our Stone was rolled away 200000 years ago he said there will be an Easter and I'll bring forth that same church in it same power I'll bring that bride out just like she was back there with the same signs the same fruits the same thing that they did I'll bring her back again I will restore say the Lord what restore all that the denominations eat off restore all that the go uh the organization eat off I will restore sayeth the Lord now basically he's telling us we're Invincible we cannot die hello now he said there is no such a thing as a spiritual death now to a baptized saint of God though he were yet dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die all scripture it must be fulfilled see you can't die you've got eternal life only thing the Redeemer has made you recognize it and you were always that and that's the reason you see here it is is the day you're living in can you see the day you're living in he said that's the reason you see it because God Amen has has come and you are redeemable amen not just save redeemable right how many see it yes sir he said raise your hand thank you see the day we're living in you recognized it oh you recognized it how you recognized it understand every messenger comes at the end of every age hello now if there was such thing the end of a bride age we'll know that Jesus will be coming soon but the seven Church age brother brandham comes at the end of it and at the end of what we call let's say trior prior to the translation who comes Jesus right because he is The Headstone he is the capping off of of this age not this just age but the whole body amen I love this the first should be last and the last should be first amen it goes on and I'm going to read a few little things if that's okay he said but the birth the new birth that come by Christ cannot die see that's why the devil don't want you to get it he knows if you don't you he said like I said I read that quote last week he don't care if you come to church he don't care if you pay your ti he don't care if you be nice he don't care if you be sweet he doesn't care amen if you do all these nice Pious thing he doesn't care you can be a sweet as a Catholic priest he doesn't care he'll let you be all of that so that you'll miss Heaven the only way you'll make it to Heaven is to be born again am that's what he told Nicodemus that was one of his first doctrines every man woman boy or whatever it may be must be born again child that one tree and the other tree see and this tree though it been persecuted oh I love this made fun of since the very beginning of the Garden of Eden it cannot die amen it's predestinated it's been cloved and beat and my everything done to it and what happened it cannot die am he his he will not die he can't because he's holding in him the predestinated word of God it has to come forth for his fruit is in his own season predestinated season hello so let me put it this way each and every one of us be part of the Bride each every one of us are a tree and each and every one of us have seasons to bring forth his fruit amen y'all hear what I'm saying we don't all bring it forth in the same season some trees ripen before the others oh come on somebody you see it's like this you know the devil can't kill you how many times you thought you was dead and God resurrected you come on somebody amen some of us we may not have been backsliding or going back amen so people can physically see it but I don't know a man who's never backsliding even your Prophet said he did he said we backslide every day oh come on somebody it's a true but why didn't you stay that way something on the inside of you by because that seed in you cannot die amen God word must come to pass even in your life amen he thought he killed Abel and up comes Seth Hallelujah I can see the war folks I can see the war amen I can see it he thought oh I'm a winner now and he s say no it ain't ain't over yet amen and when Seth went off the scene he thought it was all over and then here come he not hallelujah amen and then he walked you see what I'm saying every time the devil thought he had the church here come God up again right he thought he had Samson But Here Comes Samson all over again see that's how it is what it is he failed to see it we can take some good knockout punches we can take a few beatings but we cannot die there's something in us which is God himself that will not let us die hallelujah oh God how many times I don't know I mean it's been a long time years now since I've laid across the bed and wish I could give up the ghost maybe y'all have never been that down before but I I've been there years and years ago but I was there she laying there Lord take it Lord take up the ghost it just don't happen that amen why because when God got a purpose for you you might as well face it you're not going anywhere is that right until he's finished with you now let me move on he said now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts we've heard that so many times but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm I want you to listen to this folks so that you can realize what's fighting us it's not people in the flesh it's Spirits right listen what how he describ this Antichrist Spirit he says now the Book of Revelation shows us shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless and if he can't do it uh collectively he does it individually right he does he finds US lukewarm when you get lukewarm you get formal when you get former you're powerless what it exposes Satan revealing his works and how does that happen when you disbelieve somewhere disbelief is in your life and so when you disbelieve amen God can't work with you amen he can't he just can't do it right it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word see what I'm saying right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people gets the F true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern listen and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her and that's the point that's where we are here amen you know it got to take more than a a preacher or a pastor to discern that there's a spirit that comes in working with us every service amen every service it's not enough to to discern it you got to withstand it amen that means if the devil trying to make formal and cold and quiet in church you need to do something withstand it hallu it's not putting on it's it's it's turning on amen that's right it's turning on that energy that power that's on the inside of you and say I will not settle for this it's got to be more than just one man come on somebody everybody in here got to look at this thing and say hey something's wrong don't feel like no fire up in here y'all know what I'm saying and you and I must look at this thing and charge at it oh you feel ridiculous because the devil will be right there to make sure you feel ridiculous but press through that you have to press through it Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely toward today as when Christ witho every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them how when you recognize who you are and the power that God has given you the invested I cannot die so when sat I don't care if there's a thousand demon in in an individual and you're one man you are more powerful than the Thousand demons Jesus has already proved it amen he faced Legion and don't you think Legion wasn't a set up of the devil but when that devil understood the opposition he went to screaming Hallelujah Lucifer you didn't tell me it was him who I was going to have to deal with amen and I'm going tell you something he started screaming oh my have you come to torment us before our time so the devil knows they going to be tormented and don't don't you know amen if Jesus was able to torment the devil's then we can torment him now I like that yesterday amen because we're so used to the devil tormenting us we need to start tormenting him oh I thought about it I thought about that might have got a little fanatical cuz I thought to myself I need to go up in a restaurant and say praise the Lord torment a few of them Devils amen amen cuz they don't care coming in messing up our our services or whatever amen let's move I'll never forget it when I was in Al Ohio and that man come in that restaurant he's screaming to the top of his voice now they would have put me out if IID went in there praising the Lord and shouting dancing amen they put me out but he kept running and getting into people are you a bucker are you a buck are you and I'm thinking they have put me out but this was a this was a fanen for Ohio State and nobody said anything but just cheered on with it but if I would have in there and said are you a Christian are you a oh my old devil you better not give me no ideas hallelujah amen because really we ought to be at a place right now amen that we ought to be looking for that last seed here in Iowa and the only way you can do that is search the highways the byways the bushes everywhere and maybe we need to ask that question are you a Christan Christian you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book were we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ exposition of the Christ is what it is he said uh uh himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or will we fail to get it that's why so many people can walk out here and not even understand and they think they do I say so many but nevertheless bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost amen that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people elect lady is a special class of people it would take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instructions not just a student comparing verses with verses though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the whole of the spirit or it'll never become clear how we need to hear from God Amen see it doesn't matter see and and lay ourselves he said how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know amen see I hey the denomination that that they compare scripture and it's pretty good they can do pretty good with it but it ain't that it's Revelation it's God revealing to you by the word through the word so that you can have instructions in your life see what I'm saying now we went by the grace of God and we taught talked about how uh the statue of obey a Christ in you and and my point is how many people you know not only talk about it but are pressing into it the devil don't care how how many M Mysteries you know Paul said you can understand all Mysteries and you miss it so the devil don't care about that he looking if he can hinder you comeing The Life of Christ he got you see that's the important that's the emphasis because remember that's what Adam lost amen that's why Jesus died to return his life back to us amen if you don't want that you're wasting your time that should be your goal God give me your life I want to see see because that is the token it ain't blood it ain't chemistry it ain't nothing like that it is the life of the blood which is the Life of Christ which is God am in you and I and it's something that you can't fake yes sir it's got to be real the only way that you can ever get that is to have a real birth I know it you listen to uh uh the either future home or choosing of a bride brother brand say the only kind the word can bring forth is those acts to 38 screaming holling babies now that's all he said he says it in so many places in so many ways but you know people don't want that but let me put it this way as I got it in my notes and I'm going to be long I'm going try not to be the Rapture is only for the bride that's it it's only for the bride right now brother bam goes on and says listen it's always at the third at the end of the third day that God makes himself manifest or visible right he said early in the morning when Jesus was RA risen from the dead he said when he rose from the dead his raising from the dead became a rumor but at the end of that third day he had gathered all of his disciples together and made himself visible plain to them oh come on somebody amen so you got to realize by the grace of God where we are with this thing not only did God make himself visible through a prophet amen but God's getting ready to make himself visible through a bride at the end of this thing and it's approaching rapidly amen it's approaching rapidly right now it's just a rumor amen but God going to do some mighty things in US amen the Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years this great Rapture if there's not a Rapture friends where are we at what are we doing what are we going to do what are what age are we living in what promise do we have there is going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be and it'll be the only for the elected the elected lady the bride in this day that pulls out the church the very word means call out of as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church a church out of a church members members from every denomination making up a bride bride tree is that right in the tape the bride tree a bride coming out called and that's the one that that the bride tree is the bride rather is the one that is going to be in the Rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones for known by God from the beginning the father spiritual genes wo listen the father spiritual genes this message is so great it wasn't done in a corner I remember talking with brother Tom Brown and sister Marilyn they were there when brother Brandon was teaching the seven Church ages and uh when he had drawn out the seven stages they were there when the pill of fire see nobody can't take it from a lot of people's heart because they was there how you going to tell them right they saw the PFI come and draw it out on the wall I can't imagine what that would have done to me I can't imagine what that would have done to me to see that happen amen and not only that remember it wasn't just on the wall God displayed it in the heavens as well right science caught the same stages come on somebody and these people trying to to say oh let me not even go there my point is it's it's only for selected people people and my point is when you see yourself standing you ought to be jumping about now somewhere just to think that you're one of them how many of us here tonight can say I merited that none of us it's unmar Grace brother brandom said it was so unmar that God slipped a wedding band a marriage band on you before the foundation of the world the wedding band I came into this world wearing [Laughter] one come on somebody he call it predestination huh we're blessed people yes and once we get to a place to realize amen that all of us are different but yet the same right God ain't got no cookie cutters amen oh come on somebody and some of us going to be doing different acting different whatever the case may be but that ain't it the point is is the life there that's what I'm saying is the life of Jesus Christ in there and if it's so listen it may not be to a mature state but you can see it growing you can see it moving Hallelujah and Lord God you know in your on your knees you know how to cry for it right that's exactly right that's one thing I I I've noticed I've learned about my grandbabies when they want something they know how to scream for it right now looking coming from amen the message Shalom I hope y'all don't mind this Darkness this L to see in church age now when Jesus which is the word in the lery and church age was on the outside of the church knocking at the door trying to get in darkness grows Darkness upon the people now he here brother brandom is taking his experience of what was happening to him with the Pentecostals remember he said now when he went out to Arizona he said I've been out here three years three and a half years he said and none of my brothers invited me what house you build me speaking about that he said none of my brothers out here invited me to come preach for him but here is perig green God has anointed him to build a tabernacle brother said I didn't tell him to do it this was God's doing right God wanted me to preach or have me to preach somewhere and what was God doing since they would not open to them they were now experiencing vasty the Judgment of vasty versus the Judgment of Queen Esther see because what we failed to see that whole that whole that whole thing about uh es that that that that was prophecy end time prophecy of what would happen even to the bride here we find out that that the denomination T dasty and she rejected the prophet of that her day and here's some nobodies Hallelujah brother BR talks about Billy grab and or Roberts and how their class of people were so up the up part of the who's who's all of that he said and then you turn around and see my group when they group went out he come mine and crutches and wheelchairs and everything else pulling themselves into the auditorium that's just like Jesus amen Ain it like him I know y'all don't know what I'm talking about but anyway we look at this thing and you say well brother Brooks look at us now ain't got no piano play Ain't Got No getar player come on somebody we ain't got no stained Windows Hallelujah let me preach man let me preach and take my thunder so the thing about it is we got God on the inside we got the greatest thing ever oh Lord have mercy he goes on to say the Perfection of the scriptures Glory of his great name the pope visit us was assigned to the church blackening out the man uh blackening out the manifestation light of the world was the Bible Jesus said he was the light of the world the Bible said he is the word and the manifestation or the Vindication scripture is the light now you'll not be permitted to do when it when it takes a hole and we're seen it for shadow now what is he saying and and we I can I say it I'm saying this so that you and I can understand by the grace of God is that God comes alone and he Paces you in a gross Darkness I preach this let there be light right so that you could understand amen that right now there's Darkness if it was gross darkness in 60s where do you think it is now because you got to understand there's still some light in the world and Satan hates it so this Darkness amen is now aiming itself to put out all the light y'all hear what I'm saying it's now focusing is the word I meant focusing on the light which is you and me and everybody that believe this message and he's going to do any and everything he can do to put out the light but guess what it's impossible it's impossible it's like a boy taking a slingshot looking up in the sky and said I'm gonna put one of those Starlights out how ridiculous but that's basically what Satan thinks that he can literally take this thing and put the light out in your life but brother brandom said it like this if God started the fire in you it'll never go out now I'm I'm I'm trying to hurry because I I can see you're tired he says now now notice where we where where whether we're in the last days a last age or not now we find out if we turn back to Genesis about oh about the fifth chapter you can turn also to Luke and find out Enoch was the seventh from Noah right the catches is the serpent seed there catches the serpent seed for if Cain was Abel's son then he would have been the eighth but nowhere in the Bible it said that Cain was Abel's son Cain was the Adam's son because that's uh Cain was not uh he working was was not Adam's son because the Bible said he was of the evil one Adam wasn't the evil one see it was the evil one now we find out that Enoch was a seven from from Noah which was the type of the church ages now all of the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh is that right showing that it's the seven Church a that taks the Rapture amen hallelujah so if we can see that it's the seven Church AE that makes the Rapture Where Do We Stand now we're in a place where God is getting ready to take a abide out of here and you and I must be Rapture Ready amen is that all right oh come on somebody I heard another voice like Revelation 18 says come out of her my people and be not partakers of what her sin that you be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not her plag is that right so you and I must recognize that we're in a position amen that God is calling and this is happening University universally amen people everywhere to a word to a message and this message is get ready amen because the fire is getting ready to fall you say oh brother books there's so many people here I I've got people who say don't even want to hear hear that this thing going to go down because they believe that it's going to last forever if I could talk to somebody in capernium I'm sure they would say the same thing if I could have an interview with him I believe they' say well you know we thought capernium was going to last for if what if I could talk to somebody who was in Pompei when it went down come on somebody amen you know the people in Sodom they thought the same thing the world of old thought the same thing and Noah tried to prove it to him but they would not listen because they couldn't see it with there are naturalized I can't see what he talking about right it ain't there it is spiritually discerned come on somebody if the birds know when to move Hall you take a old Gander all he's got to do is honk his horn Hallelujah and all those geese will start Gathering why they know of the voice of a leader oh Lord y'all hear what I'm saying that's why Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow this is not the age of where it is because Jesus said in the Book of Revelation the third chapter Le the SE will be rich increase with good and have need of nothing and look at look what's happening to the churches it's a Prosperity Gospel not even getting them ready they they they teaching them how to live here on Earth why it's going to pass you going to die someday we need to be taught how to live Hereafter and Jesus said you must be born again come on somebody it's the truth you've heard me say this so many times you didn't come here by some alien plane or some boat or some kind of trip thing they saying in Hollywood you came here by God's creation Let There Be am right you were born into this world and how do you get into the other world you got to be born born you will not be transplanted right you've got to be born again right because the Bible said when Jesus met Nicodemus and Nicodemus Mar not you must be born again that which is his flesh is flesh and that which is spirit Spirit that's why people hate the Holy Ghost that's why the devil want to say it ain't real there's nothing to it you can shout dance speak in tongues and all of that and they say oh you got that ain't it it is the true life of God cuz Satan can mimic all of that I'm not saying the Holy Ghost don't do that I'm saying Satan can mimic that and deceive many come on somebody they can do all of that and live like a devil and say they got it let me move on ghost dogness blinding of Israel was the lightning of the Gentiles that's right now the blinding of the Gentiles is the lightning of the Israel it's just like the day and night one side has got darkness and the other side has got light and look what's happening the gospel has come all the way to the West when Isuzu Street started amen what was that that was that gospel that was the beginning of this thing starting but after that West it goes back to the East look at America now we're dark come on somebody darkness is upon us look at the people they're groping people they're groping they don't even know who they are what they are they're groping feeling their way they've gotten to a place they don't don't even want to hear God in their knowledge that's the scripture but look over on the east side they have a Revival God is even appearing Amen to the Palestinians and everything proving himself to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday to day and forever why cuz we're getting ready for a Rapture we're getting ready for a change of body come on somebody amen they laugh at it they scoff at it but we're Witnesses am he's the same yesterday today and forever Oh Glory to God is that all right now look Gentile Church age is finished and we we don't see it you know what's happening now it's only the bride the foolish virgins amen they they roaming out there and they they don't have enough oil they know it but they don't know where to go they believe in God but they don't have the strength they don't have the power they don't have the light Hallelujah but there was five wives amen who had oil and extra oil she knew who she was and she knew where the door was right because without the light you can't find the door somehow they found the door but when they found the door the Bible said they came right and the door was shut who was the door the Lord Jesus Christ he said I am the door right they came to a revelation that Jesus Christ is not Methodist he's not Baptist he's not Catholic he's not Presbyterian he's not Pentecostal he's the word amen that's who Jesus Christ is in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God he did not have such a brand on him he wouldn't even associate with the Pharisees and the Sadducees of his day he was the word and because you put him in a category doesn't mean that's the same Jesus talked here because we know that every organization in denomination strips him it don't mean that today not like today you understand me I I don't mean to be rough I'm just trying my best to to to to to to Anchor the word into the seed of the heart of of the believer is that all right the church is making itself ready being being making herself ready for a time is a time for the rapture for darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and Dawn will soon break upon the Jews y'all believe that amen I do why is everybody accusing the Jews do you really believe that's the truth come on that same spirit amen accused Jesus and called him the as above right you can't believe like I told you remember I think it was my wife and I we were in England I know I was there for sure I was in England and I saw Obama and and the pope together a year a whole year before they put that news clipping on our Channel same thing so what I'm saying is America believe it or not you're behind time when it comes to the news my point is amen it ain't that we got to listen to that to believe we know the sign and the season that we're living in y'all hear what I'm saying now let's move on by the grace of God because you got to realize why is this attack now I want you to I want you to think about this because Israel is our time piece we can see because what happened is when God is done with the Gentiles he goes back to the Jews they're looking for Moses and Elijah right the two prophets but we realize amen the anointing of God the power of God Is Lifting lifting off of the earth y'all remember I I don't know how long some of y'all been a Christian but I could remember you know when we would come to church the power of God would be all on the on the on the on the um outside of the church you could hardly wait to get in you was no such thing as being laid you couldn't be laid in that day you wouldn't have a seed look at it now people just dragging in I got to go back to church again H you see what I'm saying it the the anointing is no longer there the word hasn't changed but the hearts of the people had they've left their first love worldism has come in it got so many many other things to to to pledge give them pleasure one time it was all God that gave us pleasure we love church so much we could hardly standing you see what I'm saying and now amen God is now secondary of whatever it a it won't work that way it's I hope that's okay now let's move on and this is what has happened because we find out by the grace of God remember Mo uh uh Mary and Joseph Mary and Joseph at the feast and they leave and then they find out that Jesus is not with them right so you got to realize amen there's a lot of Christians who was at the feast and they left thinking Jesus was with them and they get down the road and they find out Jesus is not with them they turn back around and they find Jesus among the elders teaching and Mary who had a supernatural visitation from God comes along and said Jesus don't you know my your father and I oh hold up Jesus said my I'm about my father's business how can Mary call Joseph Jesus father she did it at that moment she literally denounced the supernatural visitation that she had from the angel Gabriel and him being the word corrected her and said woman he didn't even say mother he said woman know ye not that I'm about my father's business and she never said another word cu the word will always correct the error and what has happened is a lot of people have gone off assuming that Jesus is still with them we're living in a time that God comes along we call it the Third Exodus right the first Exodus was Noah's day Exodus from 2 Exodus was in Moses day amen and the Third Exodus is now come out of her my people be not partakers of her sin come on somebody now you got to recognize that this church world the way it looks now amen you think they going into heaven doing all of that and must I explain come on somebody the truth is the truth some of the moves they're doing I used to do when I was in the club now you can't dance for Jesus and God doing the same stuff I don't care if you say Jesus to it it doesn't mean it's Jesus am I making sense see this way is straight and narrow the Bible said only a few be that find it you got to want it you got to be chosen not by me but by God is that all right now Joseph amen what was a type of Christ is that right you got to realize by the grace of God how he was uh father gave him a coat of many colors and uh I don't even know whether this daddy understood what those colors was all about but it was a covenant maybe he was thinking about the Covenant that that God gave Noah when he put it in the rainbow but understand every color has virtue oh Jesus Peter call him Peter caught it and he put it in order after your faith cuz blue means strength right he goes all the way up to the ladder Faith virtue knowledge temples all the way up he caught the virtues of that rainbow and says listen this is the divine nature of God you say Hey brother Brook is that true you find out in Revelation the Bible said he sat there Jesus himself with a rainbow above his head what was it the same character The Same Spirit the Holy Ghost the same power and strength of the Holy Ghost will always be with us throughout eternity amen so Joseph comes down and we understand he's a perfect type of Christ I'm saying all these things so you can understand where we're standing he comes along and he's a perfect type of Christ he's betrayed by his brother he's hated of his brother he's thrown into the ditch like Jesus was thrown into the grave he raised up amen he's now thrown into prison amen there in Egypt part of a wife tried to take him amen and strip him of his virtue huh come on somebody and that's what denominationalism will do for you will strip you of your virtue you know the word of God don't mean all of that and you don't have to do that no more I mean that was for yesterday and Jesus Christ said he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not so we come to a place and we find out amen he comes along and God is doing this great thing and now he's in in prison and he's interpreting the dreams of the but and the vaker the two thieves on the cross one die and the other one is free Hallelujah come on and then shortly after that Jesus is raised to what the right hand and this is where Joseph comes he's now at pharaoh right now watch this in the time that Joseph is in in power who is Jesus Christ himself he's in power now and now there it switches from Egypt to Israel right now it switches from Egypt before it was all about Joseph what he was going through how he had to do this how he did this what happened to him now when Joseph comes into Power who what happened it switches to Israel the concerns his daddy gets is old Benjamin has grown up famine in the land now they need help so now they got to go down to Egypt Lord for help and who do they find not immediately but Joseph recognizes his brothers y'all know the story now we realize this is exactly what's happening now this was prophecy this is what's happening now am amen when you saw those Jews out there and when they when they when they screamed out when they were persecuting uhhhh HH Jesus and he was being crucified and they said let his blood be on us and our children they've suffered they've suffered but God still with the tender hand of Jehovah drove them back amen oh come on somebody to the promised land and what is it is in shadowing type Benjamin has come to maturity oh Lord amen and that was Joseph interest he wasn't interest in Ruben and all the others when he said is your father living and how is Benjamin amen right because listen and then when he catches up with them and they're in Egypt he takes them and he lays them oh God have mercy this is true because that's what the Millennium will do amen he'll set them all in order woo every tribe will be in order like Joseph set him at the table put them all in order but what did he do he gave a double portion to Benjamin and that word of God tells us amen I believe it says amen they'll be born in one day Hallelujah come on somebody and they'll ask where did we get where when they see the Messiah they're going to say where did we get where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends and they're going to realize they're the ones that crucified him Hallelujah the Gentile day is over then there's no more salvation for the Gentiles y'all y y amen but the truth of the matter is what did he do just prior to himself revealing himself to his Brethren the word of God tells us he dismissed his Gentile wife and that was a shadow and type of the Rapture so if you here and you on you hear CNN talking about Moses and Elijah you've missed it amen you've missed the Rapture you missed it because amen before he reveals himself to them as the Messiah and you better believe it it's so close now because that old Rabbi said that he had visions and he seen who Jesus Christ was and he said he was yes surea amen I hope I'm pronouncing it right amen they don't want to believe it but the truth of the M the truth of the matter is there are more Jews now coming into the reality that Jesus Christ is and was the Messiah what's happening now this little bride amen that looked like the scum of the earth is getting ready to take a Rapture Hallelujah you might not look like much but God is getting ready to translate us you're going to always look like nuts you're going to always look like nuts but that's what the man said if you don't have nuts in the machine it's ain't nothing but a whole bunch of yunk I couldn't help it that's true every machine got to have nuts once the world lose us it ain't going to be nothing but a whole bunch of junk hey nothing hold it together is that right that's the word it is the salt that holds it together Hallelujah and once this world loses its salt it's finish Oh Glory to God it's just okay amen I'm going have to quit I thought I was going to be able to finish it but uh if the seven Church AG is over which it is we've got to recognize we are in eternity see now you think you're time creatures but really you're not the truth of the matter is even when you go to sleep and you have a dream you travel you could call it Soul travail whatever you want to call it but you travel and then down the road you find yourself oh my goodness I've been here before they call it Deja Vu this is just a house for you Hallelujah come on somebody this is just a house and when you see that that's why the Bible said that God orders your steps through dreams and somehow when you wake up you know which way to go with it I don't understand it all but that's the word is that okay now the you're in an eternal age that means the Holy Ghost in you can't die it can't die you can't die you can't die amen once you you've died already to what yourself so you can't die and when the word of God was open the Seven Seals and all were open amen you know what it did it put you back into the place like I said this morning amen before Adam and Eve sin now that's where you are amen a you see cuz God's word cannot come back void God told Adam said whatever you do I want you to sedo everything what is your commission to sedo everything put everything under your feet pull down every stronghold Hallelujah you're right back in that place if you got the original Holy Ghost because there's a lot of fake ones out there but if you got the original it will bring forth the same Supernatural signs amen and wonders and most of all the same life some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that's we're entering in another age we're entering the Rapture age you know the church can't do it in this condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that that's right it it's not going to get better it's going to get worse so if this world is going to get worse what's going to happen to you see without that life you'll get worse evil seducers wax worse and worse oh come on that's the word but if the life of Jesus Christ in in you you get better amen the world gets worse and you get better the world gets darker and you get brighter amen that's how it's supposed to be the darker the night the brighter the Stars right and that's the way way it's supposed to be just prior to the coming of the Lord let me say this one more thought cuz I'll just have to finish it later when God gives you the Holy Ghost that's omnipotence that's all power he says all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but you shall receive power amen after which the Holy Ghost is coming upon you same power if that same Spirit be in you that was also in Christ Jesus as it Quicken his body it quickens what your moral body so he the same power because it's the same God in you doing the same Works amen oh come on people so my point is if God is omnipotent and in he's in you then what does it make you and when two omnipotents be something must happen right an explosion remember I told you amen Rebecca had never seen Isaac she received all the gifts huh laying on the hand speaking in tongue shouting dancing all those gifts she wasn't satisfied she said Ela take me to the band who sent these gifts right take me to the man who sent me this gift and you know she saw him from a distance the Bible said she Le I love this now cuz you got to recognize this lady got on a full dress and everything yeah she I don't know how she did it but she leaps off the camera with excitement she didn't say oh my that must be the master's son and he's standing in the field what he's doing today you think I'm getting off this camera he going to wait on it cuz I'll meet him when I get there she didn't have that modern turn attitude she didn't have that modern time attitude right she leaped off and she ran oh my God I love this scene I I just wish I could just see it amen I love this scene amen because what did Isaac do he did not make a new tent he took it back into his mother tent which was the old time religion oh my God hallelujah he took her back to the old time way amen y'all heard that before it's the same as Ruth huh Ruth didn't want the modern boys she wanted boy ass the old time religion come on she wanted the old way the old Landmark come on somebody they'll call you old fogy that's all right Hallelujah but you know where you're standing you don't want this new stuff that's coming you want the same stuff Luther Wesley and and all the rest them had that produced Jesus Christ amen they produced it for their day but now the same message that they had is now coming to a mature State and it's the only thing that's going to bring you to a Rapture huh you got a word you got a word that'll change you from glory to glory you're not the changing it it's changing you it's like a a a a caterpillar and a and a butterfly F you just wrap and Tangle yourself up in it amen and one day you'll find yourself flying right on out of it that's it people that's where we are I'm not finished with this message but because we've got communion I didn't want to take too much more time let me say it like this people the voice of God is being heard people are rejecting and that's where it's supposed to be when Jesus Christ came on the scene they called him beab most of the religion people called him beel and Jesus said I didn't even come to declare myself I came to declare the father he said the works that I do is not of my own he said I can't do nothing except the father show me Hello they said well well you're a devil you make it yourself you being a man make it yourself God oh what they fail to see was God making himself a man they had a Twist in and Jesus saidwell I tell you what he said' if you don't believe what I say look at the works can anybody charge me with unbelief is there any record around here that that I said anything would happen and it didn't happen no there's not one place you can say I called a man up from from being sick and it didn't happen everything I ever done happened just like I said can anybody charge me for unbelief but what if I I can tell you where you un you disbelieve see so we're at a day right now amen that you and I must recognize this and like for whatever reason God knows I say like this we're coming into a place that you and I must recognize amen that we're now in what we call a holy convocation those of us who are moving into the perfect statue of Christ amen we are now amen in this age that the world knows nothing about amen hello this is what you call the bride age where God is calling people out of all of these places that won't take the word for what it says now you look at this thing if Eve messed up by redefining one word and got us into this mess how in the world we going to get out of it then everybody has their own interpretation y'all hear what I'm saying but the Bible said there there's no no no no no no private interpretation to this so if there's no no private interpretation to this word how are we going to know Amos said 3:7 the Lord will do nothing except it reveal his secrets to his servant the prophet he did it in Noah's day he did it in Jesus day he did it in Moses day he did it in Paul's day he did it in our he has done it in our day and that's it now we're following a Jesus Christ that cannot change his word cannot change he said it just like he meant it and I don't mean no harm I don't need a revised version to understand my Lord come on somebody it's almost like saying to a cow you got to change your language because your calf is not understanding y'all understand what I'm saying right amen that's that's what they saying horse you got to change your language cuz your calf is not understand your your your Little Pony is not understanding what you're saying you speak in horse language but for some reason this horse can't understand you that's nonsense one thing I know about a baby a little child can understand what you say before he can speak it yeah is that true now he may not be able to speak speak it but he can understand it that's how it is with a child of God when they're born they may not be able to speak it just right but they understand it Hallelujah and all they got to do is keep listening Hallelujah keep reading it all of a sudden they begin to come become the word they'll speak it just like it is it becomes their life their language everything you love God Amen Les's stand we're going to prepare for our communion
