[19:04] we'll come unto you love with our hearts
[19:06] full of Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's
[19:08] name I pray believing amen whilst we
[19:12] were standing let's just open our Bibles
[19:14] to the book of Genesis chapter 17
[19:24] read from the first verse
[19:37] and when Abraham was 90 years old in
[19:41] nine the Lord appeared to Abram to
[19:44] Abraham and said unto him I am the
[19:47] Almighty God walk before me and be thou
[19:50] perfect and I will make my covenant
[19:53] between me and thee and will multiply
[19:56] the exceedingly and Abraham fell on his
[20:00] face and God talked with him saying as
[20:02] for me behold my covenant is with thee
[20:05] and thou shall be a father of many
[20:08] nations neither shall thy name any more
[20:11] be called Abram but thy name shall be
[20:14] Abraham for a father of many nations
[20:16] have I made thee and I will make the
[20:19] exceeding fruitful and I will make
[20:22] nations of thee and Kings shall come out
[20:25] of thee and I will establish my covenant
[20:28] between me and thee and thy seed after
[20:32] after the India generations for an
[20:35] everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[20:38] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[20:42] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[20:45] after the the land wherein thou art a
[20:48] stranger all the land of canaan for an
[20:51] everlasting possession and I will be
[20:53] their God and God said unto Abraham thou
[20:57] should keep my covenant therefore thou
[21:00] and thy seed after thee in the
[21:02] generations Amen may the Lord add
[21:04] blessing to the reading of his word we
[21:06] might take our seat
[21:12] in the passage of Scripture we'll just
[21:15] read the reading when God came down and
[21:17] he gave Abraham a covenant and he
[21:22] changed
[21:22] Abraham Abraham's name from Abraham to
[21:25] Abraham because we know the prophet of
[21:29] God told us that he was giving part of
[21:32] him which God was Elohim the
[21:34] self-existent one and when he gave part
[21:37] of himself to Abraham he changed his
[21:39] name from Abram to Abraham and as we
[21:43] were reading God was giving a covenant
[21:46] to Abraham and his seed thereafter and
[21:49] we know a covenant modern day would
[21:53] probably call it a promise or a contract
[21:57] that's what we would call it in this in
[21:59] this modern day so God just came and he
[22:03] gave this covenant to Abraham when we
[22:06] read in the previous chapters we never
[22:09] heard of anything special that Abraham
[22:11] did God just came straight to him
[22:14] he just chose him by grace and he said I
[22:18] want to give you this covenant amen
[22:20] that's what Grace has done for us that's
[22:22] what grace is all about we don't deserve
[22:25] no mercy we didn't we don't deserve no
[22:28] nothing but just God with his amazing
[22:31] grace he elected you he elected me a man
[22:35] so we see Abraham did not ask for this
[22:38] promise we don't see where anything he
[22:41] did a great deed or where he did
[22:44] something really good and God said I
[22:45] want to reward you with this covenant
[22:47] from what we read Abraham he was just a
[22:51] hidden who in the earth of the Chaldeans
[22:55] he was there he was just a he'd hidden
[22:57] worshipping idols knew nothing about God
[23:00] but God just came to him and he said
[23:02] pick your things and start going and he
[23:05] just selected him so that his election
[23:08] by grace hallelujah
[23:10] so this morning just for a couple of
[23:14] minutes we want to talk on the subject
[23:16] the Grace Covenant amen so when we read
[23:21] it we see that grace is unmerited favor
[23:23] just being favored by God
[23:25] for doing nothing hallelujah we were in
[23:30] our sins doing things whatever we were
[23:32] doing but God with his favor he just saw
[23:34] you and he says that's the one I want
[23:37] and there's justification he justified
[23:40] us and he took us and changed our names
[23:44] so as we were reading in in Genesis we
[23:49] saw that God said I want to give you
[23:53] this covenant and this covenant is
[23:55] between you and me and it applies to the
[24:00] two your seed which are the generations
[24:02] that come after Abraham so this contract
[24:05] a promise was not only ending with
[24:09] Abraham but Israel it was extended to
[24:12] come unto all his generations - the seed
[24:15] that comes after him and this this
[24:18] contract was unconditional it was God
[24:21] who said I am the one who is giving you
[24:24] this I'm not giving you this because you
[24:27] deserve it
[24:27] or I'm not doing this to say after you
[24:31] do this that's when I'll do this for you
[24:33] because God every time he had a covenant
[24:36] a conditional covenant with man men
[24:39] always couldn't keep their end when God
[24:42] will say if you do this I will do this
[24:45] for you men always failed
[24:47] so God was so determined to let this
[24:51] come through so he said I am now
[24:53] swearing by myself and this covenant is
[24:56] it is from me and I am the one who is
[24:59] giving it it is unconditional no matter
[25:03] what you do no matter what happens no
[25:06] matter what comes your way whatever the
[25:08] decision you make my covenant with you
[25:11] does not change my covenant with you
[25:13] still say the same because he so much
[25:17] wanted to save man he didn't want the
[25:19] redemption plan to go sideways
[25:21] he saw if I let men come into the
[25:23] equation this whole plan will be
[25:25] disrupted so that's why he said I am the
[25:29] one I swear by myself and it is an
[25:31] unconditional covenant you don't have to
[25:34] do nothing I am the one who is fully
[25:37] responsible for this
[25:39] promised over this contract amen so we
[25:43] see that now this this promise comes to
[25:46] it it comes down unto us all the seed of
[25:49] Abraham and we know that the natural
[25:51] seed of Abraham is a is Israel is that
[25:55] right so the prophet of God tells us
[25:58] that this covenant came in with grace
[26:03] because many times we think that the Old
[26:05] Testament is fully the law and the New
[26:09] Testament is only grace but when we read
[26:12] we see that it was Grace at first before
[26:16] the low came because the low is that is
[26:19] it comes and he says if you do this you
[26:22] will be punished an eye for an eye if
[26:25] you commit a sin you have to you you
[26:28] have to pay for it if you commit murder
[26:30] you have to be murdered but we see
[26:33] before the law of circumcision came
[26:35] which was which was the law in the Old
[26:37] Testament it was grace that brought a
[26:40] that brought Abraham into the covenant
[26:43] with God I read what the prophet of God
[26:47] says and he says and Abraham never
[26:49] received this promised while he was in
[26:52] circumcision under the law but when he
[26:55] was under grace before circumcision was
[26:59] ever issued
[27:00] therefore it's nothing it's not nothing
[27:03] that we could do to merit it it's God's
[27:05] grace that gives it to us by faith
[27:08] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[27:11] to him for righteous the law is what men
[27:15] wanted not what God wanted so we see the
[27:19] lo came into place because that's what
[27:22] men wanted because men did not want
[27:25] God's grace but God's initial plan His
[27:28] perfect will was Grace for his children
[27:31] hallelujah so we see now that God
[27:34] brought in Abraham God brought in
[27:37] Abraham with Grace and he wanted the
[27:40] same for Abraham's seed we know Paul in
[27:44] the old in the New Testament he tells us
[27:46] that Christ in Galatians he says Christ
[27:50] is the seed of Abraham that
[27:53] God promised to him when he when he
[27:55] promised him a son when he promised him
[27:58] that the Covenant would extend to his
[28:00] seed he was talking about Jesus Christ
[28:03] we know the Old Testament times the New
[28:05] Testament so Isaac was a type of Christ
[28:08] but what God really meant he was
[28:11] pointing to Jesus Christ as a royal seed
[28:14] of Abraham so this is where the promise
[28:18] extended to so now we know that for us
[28:21] to become the seed of Abraham we have to
[28:25] be born again saved and received the
[28:28] Holy Ghost when we were born amen the
[28:31] man or woman who is filled with the Holy
[28:33] Ghost is a child of Abraham is the seed
[28:36] of Abraham so the moment you become the
[28:39] seed of Abraham you are part of the
[28:42] Covenant you are a beneficiary of the
[28:45] Covenant a beneficiary of the promise
[28:48] you know if there is if there is a title
[28:50] deed that describes an inheritance and
[28:54] it has it has your name in it by virtue
[28:58] of being in that lineage by virtue of
[29:00] you being a son or a daughter that is
[29:03] described in that in that our title deed
[29:06] you become a beneficiary of that
[29:08] inheritance so we know we were once
[29:11] castaways but because of God's grace he
[29:14] brought us in and he cleansed us and he
[29:18] called his sons and daughters of God and
[29:20] he brought us in into the royal family
[29:24] and now we can say we are the seed of
[29:26] Abraham so by virtue of that you and me
[29:30] we are now under we are now under the
[29:33] promise we had we are described in this
[29:36] title deed so we are heirs to this
[29:39] covenant that God made with Abraham
[29:41] because we are the seed of Abraham
[29:43] through crisis that right hallelujah
[29:46] because we did nothing to deserve this
[29:48] covenant you and I we clearly no we did
[29:53] nothing for us to be saved we did not
[29:56] deserve it you know you were hanging out
[29:58] with your friends doing the same things
[30:01] but God just came and he hand-picked you
[30:04] and he say you that's the one I want
[30:07] you did nothing no not any deeds or
[30:11] nothing but he just said I want you why
[30:13] that is election so God decided to take
[30:16] you clency and he called you a son and
[30:19] he called you a daughter because he just
[30:21] loved you by His amazing grace
[30:23] hallelujah
[30:24] so this amazing grace he just came and
[30:27] it located you the prophet of God calls
[30:29] it justification you know it's being
[30:33] picked out out of out of many and you
[30:36] just say I just want that one
[30:38] not that you have done anything good or
[30:40] nothing but it is just the grace of God
[30:43] so now we can come in before the
[30:46] presence of God we stand in holy which
[30:49] then in justified because of His grace
[30:52] that he gave unto us so God had to do
[30:56] this by himself he did not want men
[30:59] disrupting his plan so that's why he
[31:01] made this covenant and he swore by
[31:03] himself to say this I will do no matter
[31:06] what you do I am going to save you so
[31:09] tonight this morning rather because of
[31:12] the grace because you are saved you
[31:14] cannot fail the New Testament tells us
[31:18] that God never loses those that I his
[31:21] why because it is grace it is a covenant
[31:24] that God made by himself you are know
[31:28] you have nothing to do with it so no
[31:30] matter what wrong you do or no matter
[31:32] what the devil fools you into doing God
[31:35] is not going to impute that to you
[31:38] because you know Abraham righteousness
[31:41] was imputed to him and now when we read
[31:44] in um in the Bible will let us open up
[31:47] in Hebrews chapter 11 the eleventh verse
[32:07] so hebrews chapter six the 13th verse
[32:09] actually hebrews chapter six for when
[32:19] god made promise to abraham because
[32:22] equal to swear by non by no greater he
[32:25] swore by himself saying surely blessing
[32:28] I will bless thee and multiply I will
[32:31] multiply thee so he so and so after he
[32:35] had patiently endured he obtained the
[32:37] promise we know Abraham when we are
[32:40] reading in the when we were reading in
[32:43] The Chronicles of Abraham it says that
[32:45] Abraham walked perfect before God but we
[32:48] all know when we looking at the facts
[32:51] and what and what was read that he is a
[32:53] life account we saw all the Lions that
[32:56] he did and all the wrong things that he
[32:59] did but when we come where his account
[33:01] was read it does not talk about all that
[33:04] he does not talk about all that it just
[33:06] says Abraham waiver not staggered not
[33:09] unto the promises of God why it was
[33:12] because it was God's covenant it was
[33:15] grace that had already it it says that
[33:18] it says the the end from the beginning
[33:20] so no matter what you do because simply
[33:24] because we are justified and God elected
[33:27] us before the foundation of the world
[33:29] we are not impute sin is not imputed to
[33:32] us because we are justified justified
[33:36] means just as if you never did it before
[33:39] so when the devil comes and point out
[33:41] and you say look your son was doing this
[33:44] this and this before God says no they
[33:47] never did it in the first place because
[33:49] sin is not imputed to them sin is not
[33:52] imputed to us but righteousness despite
[33:55] all the life despite all the wrong ings
[33:57] that you do but no sin is imputed not
[34:02] sin is imputed to you and me is that
[34:04] right so thus does what God has done for
[34:07] us because it is whatever wrong that you
[34:11] have done the devil God accuses the
[34:14] devil of that because it is the devil
[34:17] who made you do it but you did not
[34:20] intend to do it
[34:21] because you are a child of God you made
[34:24] a mistake but that mistake is not your
[34:26] fault it is the devil's fault this is
[34:29] what the grace covenant does for us so
[34:32] we will never fail no matter what wrong
[34:35] and you do when we come to God to
[34:37] confess it he cleans he cleans it clean
[34:41] I was late and we can come in holy and
[34:44] clean before God you see one thing God
[34:47] is not able to do is remember sins he
[34:51] cannot he cannot remember it if you do
[34:54] something today you come to God
[34:56] so since here in the contrite heart you
[34:59] repent to God God will put it in the sea
[35:03] of forgetfulness and he will not
[35:05] remember it you see us people are the
[35:08] ones who have the tendency of
[35:09] remembering if you do something then you
[35:13] you repent to God then you come back
[35:16] again you do something again you repent
[35:20] when you are trying to focus on your
[35:23] relationship with God then Satan starts
[35:25] pointing it the things you've done
[35:26] saying you look at that you are not the
[35:29] son look at that you are not a Christian
[35:32] because he's pointing at the memory but
[35:35] if you think about yourself the way God
[35:38] thinks about you you will know that that
[35:40] has that that is gone as if you never
[35:44] did it because we are justified so
[35:47] Abraham for this covenant to come into
[35:50] effect Abraham had to obey God if he had
[35:54] not obeyed the calling that God had
[35:56] given unto him this covenant was not
[35:59] going to be in effect he was going to
[36:01] remain in the land of the he was going
[36:03] to remain in the earth of the Chaldeans
[36:05] if he had not obeyed God so for this
[36:09] covenant to come into place to come into
[36:11] play and be effective Abraham had to
[36:14] listen to God he had to obey him and
[36:16] come out and stir he started following
[36:19] wherever God led him you see we call
[36:22] Abraham the father of faith because he
[36:25] was going to a place he didn't know he
[36:28] moved his whole household moved
[36:30] everything and started going to a prom
[36:34] the land way he had never had before if
[36:36] you can if I can ask you this morning
[36:38] how many are able to do it this morning
[36:41] God tells you just pick everything and
[36:45] stand for he says follow me just that
[36:48] going you leave your house you pack
[36:51] everything and then your whole family
[36:53] and not to return just to go where are
[36:57] you going I don't know I'm going I'm
[37:00] just going no one in their right mind
[37:03] will seemingly do that but this is the
[37:06] type of faith that Abraham had he
[37:09] believed in God when he heard that
[37:10] calling it was because he was elected
[37:13] before the foundation of the world so he
[37:15] could not do decline this call that God
[37:18] had on him so he packed up everything
[37:21] took his whole family he took his uh-oh
[37:24] his livestock and everything and he
[37:26] started moving he started walking just
[37:29] following God looking for a city whose
[37:32] builder and maker is God amen the
[37:34] promised land he had been given by God
[37:37] but he didn't know where he was going so
[37:39] this is the type of faith we are
[37:41] supposed to have for this because this
[37:44] covenant it applies to us for is for it
[37:48] to be if in effect we have to do like
[37:50] what our father Abraham did we have to
[37:53] fully obey when God when God called us
[37:57] we we obeyed we came out of the world
[38:00] we left our our things whatever that we
[38:03] were doing just like our father Abraham
[38:05] and this Grace Covenant is in effect to
[38:08] us is that right so that's what we ought
[38:11] to do leave ourselves just get out of
[38:15] the way and let let God work in us and
[38:18] just let God have full preeminence for
[38:21] this covenant to be in full effect you
[38:24] see this covenant will never fail us so
[38:27] just the same way as he honored the
[38:29] Covenant with our father Abraham if we
[38:32] do exactly like our Father what like
[38:34] what our father Abraham did God will do
[38:37] the same for us so because we know
[38:39] Abraham held on to that covenant he held
[38:42] on to that promise no matter what a lot
[38:45] of people said we know he was promised
[38:47] by God to have a son and we know he
[38:50] spent 25 years looking forward to that
[38:53] son and people asked him he would go
[38:57] around and he say I am a father of
[38:59] Nations although we knew that he had no
[39:01] he had no son he had no child at all
[39:03] after 10 years people come in he say and
[39:06] they say we are your children father of
[39:09] Nations you see he was not saying I'm a
[39:12] father of a family or a father of a
[39:15] tribe he was saying I'm a father of a
[39:17] whole of Nations not a nation but he had
[39:20] he had no evidence to point at but we
[39:23] know that faith is the substance of
[39:25] things hoped for he was holding on to
[39:28] what God had told him after 15 years
[39:31] they would come back again and they say
[39:33] father of Nations how are you doing and
[39:35] he said I'm doing fine that Sun is
[39:39] coming 20 years down the line and he was
[39:42] getting old mind you he was he was
[39:44] getting really old because when he
[39:46] received the promises he was probably
[39:48] around 75 years old and he was aging 90
[39:53] years father of father of Nations he has
[39:56] no son at all and Sarah was aging as
[39:59] well and as time went on that's when his
[40:03] faith kept on maturing because he was
[40:06] believing in God he knew that although
[40:09] 20 years have passed he knew that God
[40:11] will never fail he knew that God had put
[40:15] himself onto the Covenant and he had
[40:17] sworn by himself because there was no
[40:19] one greater so he knew that God's
[40:22] promise was going to come to pass
[40:24] despite whatever it was so when he came
[40:27] after 25 years eventually we know the
[40:31] promised son came but we know before
[40:33] that Sarah had caused who Sarah due to
[40:37] unbelief he had here she had a she had
[40:41] facilitated for Ishmael to come in and
[40:44] we know Ishmael was a product of
[40:46] unbelief but despite that God said no
[40:49] does not the promise I made for you he
[40:51] kept on holding on he said through Sarah
[40:54] that's what my products where my promise
[40:56] is going to come true and after 25 years
[40:59] we saw Isaac came in
[41:01] as it came into existence it was because
[41:04] Abraham kept on holding to that covenant
[41:07] because he knew God never fails you see
[41:10] that's the thing with election many
[41:12] people stumble when they hear the word
[41:14] election or predestination I know some
[41:18] say then God is cruel why does he choose
[41:21] some and he does not choose some so that
[41:24] means God is a he's a God of favor but
[41:28] you see election and predestination is
[41:31] like God put all of us when he created
[41:35] man when he created Adam and Eve he put
[41:39] them on a basis of moral free moral
[41:41] agency where somebody chooses whatever
[41:44] they want you see so God gives God gives
[41:49] each and every one of us a choice but
[41:51] now simply because He is God
[41:53] he knows the end from the beginning he
[41:56] knew the choice that you were going to
[41:58] make before before he brought you here
[42:01] on earth that's why he predestinated you
[42:03] he chose you because he knew when the
[42:06] message when the word of God was going
[42:08] to come your way you are going to accept
[42:10] it he knew you were going to receive it
[42:13] you are not going to deny it
[42:15] I'll give probably an example if you are
[42:19] a father and you know you have maybe
[42:21] three or four kids then you want to go
[42:24] somewhere you know that some of your
[42:26] kids maybe two of them they're like
[42:28] traveling at you some of them to just
[42:30] like staying at home they don't they
[42:31] don't want to go out with you when you
[42:33] maybe you want to go somewhere and when
[42:35] you come and you say you really know
[42:37] these two like going these two does not
[42:39] and you say you come and you ask all of
[42:42] them you say who wants to go with me but
[42:45] you know these two exactly are going to
[42:47] come and these two are going to stay but
[42:51] you are not going to be unfair and you
[42:53] just call this two and you say maybe
[42:55] less let's say it's John and Jess you
[42:58] say John and Jess let's go then you
[43:00] leave the other two that's going to be
[43:02] unfair right but all of them they are
[43:05] right there you say who wants to go with
[43:07] me but now simply because you are the
[43:10] father
[43:11] you know the desires of the of your
[43:14] children you
[43:15] know their passions what they like and
[43:17] what they don't like you were just going
[43:20] to see who wants to go with me and those
[43:23] two are going to get up and they will
[43:25] come with you have you been unfair you
[43:28] gave them free moral agency they decided
[43:30] so that's what election and
[43:32] predestination with God is like he knew
[43:35] who was going to accept and who was
[43:37] going to reiden I it so that's how he
[43:41] chose you and me and he did not choose
[43:43] the other ones we did not because He is
[43:46] God he he is omniscient he knows
[43:49] everything the end from the beginning so
[43:52] that's what predestination and election
[43:54] is all about
[43:55] there is no favoritism but it is that
[43:58] God knows he knew your choice before you
[44:01] came here and he knew the per that that
[44:04] other person was going to deny the word
[44:06] when it was going to come unto them so
[44:09] God is not he is not using favor he is
[44:13] using foreknowledge to do his selection
[44:17] that's so he used that's what he used to
[44:20] give out to give unto us grace because
[44:23] we know we were so simply because now we
[44:27] are elected we cannot be deceived we
[44:30] have a promise in Matthew that says if
[44:32] it will deceive the very elect if it
[44:35] were possible but we thank God that it
[44:38] is not possible so we cannot fail if God
[44:42] elected you don't look at any mistake
[44:46] you made don't look at any wrong ings
[44:49] you did or anything maybe your life
[44:52] seems like it's going turning around and
[44:54] going in a different direction simply
[44:57] because you are elected you cannot be
[44:59] deceived I will promise you simply
[45:02] because you elected you are going to
[45:04] make it because God loses none of him of
[45:08] that that I he's you see we were elected
[45:10] sealed before the foundation of the
[45:12] world before even the cross of Calvary
[45:15] we were sealed we won the back part of
[45:18] God's mind he knew he knew what we were
[45:21] going to be placed so he elected us
[45:24] before the foundation of the world and
[45:26] we know so he put our lamps
[45:29] in the in the Lamb's Book of Life
[45:30] already before we were born before he
[45:34] even sada let there be light we were
[45:37] there he had already put our names in
[45:39] the lamp section in the book of life and
[45:42] so that's when he had called us his
[45:45] children so we were we were already we
[45:48] had already received this grace covenant
[45:50] before the foundation of the world when
[45:53] he slew his the lamp is the back part of
[45:56] his mind his loo his lamp Jesus Christ
[45:59] before the foundation of the world
[46:01] before the creation so and we know that
[46:05] 4000 years later after time started
[46:08] being counted that's when he that's when
[46:11] he crucified his son he decided to take
[46:14] his lamb to look onto the cross of
[46:16] Calvary and that's when he says but he
[46:19] stripes we were healed not we are going
[46:22] to be healed but we were healed and by
[46:26] his arm we know he was wounded for our
[46:29] transgressions
[46:30] so our transgressions old all the sins
[46:33] that you were going to make after you
[46:36] were born God saw that and he knew it so
[46:39] that's why 2000 years ago he decided to
[46:43] he decided to kill a lamb his own son
[46:46] and so that to pardon you of the sins
[46:49] you were going to do so all the ones
[46:51] that you did and he forgave you of and
[46:54] the ones that you are still going to do
[46:56] he already forgave all of those ones
[46:59] 2000 years ago and whatever sickness
[47:02] that kind of tries to come and knock on
[47:04] your doorstep
[47:04] he was striped for that because the
[47:07] Bible said by His stripes we were healed
[47:09] or not we are healed or going to be
[47:13] healed but it was done way before you
[47:16] came here
[47:16] you see God when God wants to create
[47:20] fish he creates water first before where
[47:22] he can put the fish God creates a
[47:25] solution before the problem so before he
[47:29] knew you were going you wanted to be
[47:30] healed so before you even came here he
[47:33] or he had already made an atonement for
[47:35] your healing so there is nothing that
[47:37] can there is nothing that can stop your
[47:40] healing because you know it was done
[47:41] already
[47:42] you have to do is accept it all you have
[47:45] to do is to receive it because it was
[47:48] and it was already it done work and he
[47:51] was wounded for our transgressions you
[47:53] see Satan does not have the right to
[47:57] come and tell you you done wrong because
[47:59] when he was wounded then it was done
[48:03] when he cried it is finished that he
[48:06] everything was done everything was
[48:08] finished oh you're wrong ings
[48:11] all your evil doings that you were going
[48:14] to do or that you think you have if you
[48:17] just repented to God it is gone it is
[48:20] finished because he done that for us he
[48:24] put it into play 2,000 years ago but it
[48:27] was done before the foundation of the
[48:29] world because that's when he that's
[48:31] that's when he created us so there is no
[48:34] condemnation within us do not let the
[48:37] devil condemn you and he say you are not
[48:39] going to make it or he tries to bring
[48:42] you down and steal the salvage the joy
[48:44] of your salvation do not allow that
[48:47] because you see you know that God
[48:50] already got already pardoned to you and
[48:53] he he already done that for you so there
[48:55] is no condemnation for us so you see the
[48:59] prophecies there is no preacher that can
[49:02] heal you all oh there is no one even
[49:06] praying for you does not heal you it is
[49:08] just a means of rise raise in your faith
[49:11] so that you get to believe and
[49:13] understand that that's what Jesus
[49:16] already done for you you already healed
[49:18] before so all you have to do is to
[49:21] believe and to accept it you see like I
[49:24] say for the covenants to be in effect
[49:27] you have to accept it you have to obey
[49:30] so all you have to do is to remember you
[49:33] say God he did it he healed me back then
[49:35] and you raised your faith and you
[49:38] believe it it and it will be done you
[49:41] will be able to say it is finished when
[49:44] you believe it hallelujah amen
[49:47] so we know that arm the Old Testament
[49:52] was a type of the New Testament and if
[49:55] would
[49:56] the ancient ways we know we know
[49:59] nowadays when you are signing a contract
[50:01] or you come into an agreement or you
[50:03] have a business deal when you agree with
[50:06] somebody you shake hands to to agree and
[50:09] say this is you are going to honor your
[50:11] word I am going to own them my word this
[50:14] is the modern way of doing things but in
[50:17] the ancient days what they used to do
[50:19] they will take they will take a
[50:22] sheepskin and then they have their
[50:25] covenants written on their sheepskin
[50:27] because back then they didn't have paper
[50:29] and everything so in the in the ancient
[50:32] times they would have a sheepskin and
[50:34] ride the Covenant on the sheepskin after
[50:39] writing that covenant they would tear it
[50:41] apart and then one person would go with
[50:44] the other piece of the sheepskin or
[50:47] animal skin and the other one would go
[50:49] with the other piece as a sign for the
[50:52] Covenant because if you would bring
[50:54] these two pieces together it is only
[50:56] this piece that can complete this one
[50:59] and it is only this piece that can
[51:01] complete this one so this is how they
[51:03] used to make that that's the way they
[51:06] used to make their covenants contracts
[51:10] you see the prophet of God said there is
[51:14] only one thing with them contract come
[51:16] together them letters the way they were
[51:19] taught they had to dovetail every letter
[51:23] and every piece of toward every piece
[51:26] there was tear the sheepskin it had to
[51:29] doubt tale right together
[51:31] nothing could substitute it it had to be
[51:34] just exactly the same in the
[51:36] confirmation of this if they brought
[51:39] another piece and try to make it ah it
[51:41] wouldn't blend in with it it just had to
[51:45] blend just the way it was so you see
[51:49] when these people would go separate
[51:50] places even if this person dies these
[51:54] when there may be there may be their son
[51:58] or whomever would have taken up the
[52:00] inheritance they would be able to come
[52:02] in because they have a sign of the
[52:04] Covenant that was made and the other
[52:06] side they have they have it so they will
[52:08] be able to match
[52:09] up to see that day is no scamming that
[52:12] has been made these are the exact people
[52:14] who did it so we see now the Grace
[52:17] Covenant that God made when he made it
[52:21] with when he made it with Abraham
[52:23] we know that Abraham was just a shadow
[52:25] we know the Old Testament is just a
[52:28] shadow of what was really going to
[52:30] happen in the New Testament is that
[52:32] right
[52:32] so now God the prophet tells us the
[52:35] Prophet tells us that what God did now
[52:38] he wanted to the Covenant that he made
[52:41] with Abraham he made like I said earlier
[52:43] on the Covenant that he made with
[52:45] Abraham he made the same it comes down
[52:48] to his seed
[52:49] we the Royal the Royal seed of Abraham
[52:52] through Christ by receiving the Holy
[52:54] Ghost and by by being saved we become
[52:58] children of Abraham so when God now in
[53:01] the New Testament after the shadow was
[53:04] done and he was bringing the the when he
[53:07] was bringing now the real thing he
[53:09] wanted to make a covenant with us so
[53:12] what he did he brought his son Jesus
[53:14] Christ unto the earth and we know that
[53:16] he poured his spirit into the body he
[53:19] created the corporal body of Jesus
[53:21] Christ that he made he poured his spirit
[53:23] into it and we know Jesus Christ was was
[53:28] God he was the fullness he wasn't evil
[53:31] he was the fullness of God there was
[53:32] dwelled Welling bodily in him so this
[53:36] was God's lamb when he was making the
[53:39] covenant with us he took his son onto
[53:42] the cross of Calvary he took him as a
[53:45] lamb because previously in the Old
[53:47] Testament when they would offer a
[53:49] sacrifice they would kill an animal they
[53:52] would kill a lamb and then they would uh
[53:55] cut it they would cut it open
[53:58] so the shedding of the blood would cover
[54:00] the sins it would just cover but but not
[54:04] to remove them completely there was in
[54:06] the Old Testament but now in the New
[54:08] Testament now the blood of Christ
[54:11] cleanses us it cleanses all the sins it
[54:14] doesn't leave even any speck of cinders
[54:17] the remaining so when Christ when gee
[54:19] when God brought his son into play
[54:22] it was he
[54:23] lamb we all know Jesus Christ the Lamb
[54:26] of God and now he was making this
[54:29] covenant with us the prophet of God
[54:31] tells us that now he killed his a lamp
[54:34] on the cross of Calvary and He shed his
[54:36] blood and by the shedding of his blood
[54:39] we know that's when we are all cleansed
[54:42] before we were even here we were all
[54:43] cleansed and what God done after three
[54:47] days he'd raised the body of Christ and
[54:49] he took the body with him and he said it
[54:52] to set it on the right hand of the
[54:54] Father and after the day of Pentecost he
[54:57] sent back the spirit to the church so
[55:00] that was there the Dera there was the
[55:02] Covenant he was making he told his son
[55:05] apart and after the day of Pentecost he
[55:08] put the Spirit with the church and he
[55:11] took the body back to heaven so this is
[55:14] the dovetailing pieces they had been
[55:16] taken apart from each other which is
[55:18] today so now the church you and me we
[55:21] have the Spirit of God within us and God
[55:24] took the copper of body of Jesus Christ
[55:27] back to heaven so now these two pieces
[55:31] they are supposed to dovetail there is
[55:34] no way they cannot because it is the
[55:36] same piece so the same the same spirit
[55:40] that was in Christ it is supposed to be
[55:42] dwelling in you two this morning the
[55:44] same works that he done are supposed to
[55:47] be done by you and me because it is the
[55:49] exact same copy not a photocopy or a
[55:52] duplicate it is the exact same one that
[55:55] you and I we had that you and I we have
[55:57] this morning when he gave us the Holy
[56:00] Ghost it is the person of Christ Himself
[56:02] coming in within us the same spirit that
[56:05] was in Christ he took it and he said
[56:07] when I am gone I will send a comforter
[56:10] unto you we know he said I go back in
[56:13] what at one point Christ says I go back
[56:15] to the Father and another point he said
[56:18] after I'm gone I'll send a comforter
[56:20] that was himself tearing himself apart
[56:23] giving one piece to the church and one
[56:26] piece going back to heaven so that those
[56:28] are the two pieces of the Covenant so
[56:30] there is no reason why the Church of God
[56:33] cannot do the words that Jesus done
[56:36] because it is the same spirit you see he
[56:39] says greater works than these shall you
[56:40] do why because the same spirit is the
[56:44] same spirit operating in the church it
[56:46] is not you doing it but it is Christ who
[56:49] is doing it within II you and me because
[56:52] it is it is his own spirit hallelujah so
[56:56] the same spirit is supposed to be living
[56:58] in the church so so now what when now
[57:02] God comes back to rupture his church he
[57:05] is not going to look for anything else
[57:07] when he is coming back for the Covenant
[57:09] that he made he is not going to look for
[57:11] any other different peace or listen to
[57:14] any other different story what he is
[57:16] just going to look for is going to look
[57:18] for the dovetailing peace that he gave
[57:21] to the church it has to come in together
[57:23] so you and I this morning we have to
[57:26] make sure that we have the same peace
[57:28] that God that God sent back on the earth
[57:31] that same spirit because the prophet of
[57:34] God tells us that without the Holy Ghost
[57:36] we cannot make it we cannot make it into
[57:39] heaven without the Holy Ghost
[57:41] because this is the only piece that is
[57:43] that makes the Covenant fool the cup of
[57:45] the Covenant that God made with father
[57:47] Abraham and he made with us so the
[57:50] Covenant that he made with us is to
[57:52] receive the Holy Ghost which is Christ
[57:54] himself
[57:56] hallelujah so we know Christ did
[57:59] miracles demons were afraid of Christ
[58:02] because of the Spirit that was within
[58:04] him he performed he healed people so
[58:07] tonight this morning when you come into
[58:10] here you are sick or you have a problem
[58:12] that problem gotta go why because the
[58:15] Spirit of Christ is in action that same
[58:18] spirit is still doing miracles that same
[58:21] spirit is still chasing away demons
[58:23] because when their spirit is around
[58:25] that's why we can sing in the presence
[58:27] of Jehovah all the troubles vanish all
[58:30] the problems I ended because it is that
[58:33] same spirit that is taking over in that
[58:36] presence so this morning I can tell you
[58:38] that presence is here this morning
[58:40] because you said wherever two or three
[58:42] are gathered in my name I will be there
[58:45] so you don't have to look at nothing
[58:47] else because we know that spirit Christ
[58:49] himself
[58:50] in our merest the same part that this
[58:53] this other part that God that God took
[58:55] away with him we have it this morning so
[58:58] when he is going to come to come back to
[59:01] the earth to rapture his bride he is not
[59:03] looking for nothing else but that which
[59:05] he left with you so it is our duty and
[59:08] our mandate for us to make sure we have
[59:11] the right piece because if we have
[59:13] something else and God comes back to
[59:15] take the church it is not going to meet
[59:18] it is not going to dovetail and bring
[59:21] back the original thing so it is our
[59:24] duty to make sure we have what God left
[59:27] us which is the pure which is the pure
[59:29] spirit of Christ amen
[59:31] so the holy sense of the Covenant is for
[59:35] us to receive the Holy Ghost to go
[59:38] through all the to go through all the
[59:40] processes of justification that which we
[59:43] are talking about there was grace it
[59:45] came and picked you up when you were
[59:47] doing whatever you were doing and it's
[59:49] brought you to be called the Son of God
[59:51] and he decided to sanctify you by the
[59:54] shedding of the blood of His Son Jesus
[59:56] Christ
[59:56] he cleansed you to make you clean to
[59:59] make you he said I'll make you as white
[1:00:01] as snow and he sanctified you after he
[1:00:04] sanctified you then he decided to come
[1:00:07] and dwell in you with the spirit of
[1:00:10] of his son that he sent back on the
[1:00:12] earth so that's what God is looking for
[1:00:15] amen so the whole is sense of the
[1:00:19] Covenant of the grace covenant
[1:00:21] it is sanctification justification when
[1:00:25] God chose you
[1:00:26] sanctification when God decided to
[1:00:29] cleanse you and giving you the Holy
[1:00:31] Ghost which is which is the person of
[1:00:34] Christ himself that's what that's what
[1:00:36] the Grace Covenant is all about we
[1:00:39] didn't deserve it but now we can stand
[1:00:42] and we can call ourselves sons and
[1:00:44] daughters of God because of what he has
[1:00:46] done for us so we have to fully obey
[1:00:49] this covenant that God has with us the
[1:00:52] covenant of him sending his son to us
[1:00:55] we gotta accept him we accept him into
[1:00:58] our life how do we accepting by putting
[1:01:01] our own self out of the way and saying
[1:01:04] lord please have full preeminence in my
[1:01:06] life so that he can come and dwell
[1:01:08] within us
[1:01:09] thus the ascent of the whole of the
[1:01:12] covenant amen
[1:01:13] by election he knew you were going to
[1:01:16] accept the word so he brought you in to
[1:01:20] be cold to be cold bright so when he is
[1:01:23] going to come back to the earth he's
[1:01:24] going to come looking for you and that
[1:01:27] will never fail so we have to accept it
[1:01:30] for it to have we have to accept the
[1:01:32] Covenant the Grace Covenant for it to
[1:01:34] have full effect in our lives we have to
[1:01:38] live clean and live holy like Christ
[1:01:40] because people were called Christians as
[1:01:44] a nickname because Christian they were
[1:01:46] saying these people they are living like
[1:01:48] Christ they are talking like Christ
[1:01:50] that's why they were called Christians
[1:01:52] so that's what we ought to do this
[1:01:54] morning because that peace that God gave
[1:01:56] unto us it is with the church this
[1:01:59] morning we have to keep it and we have
[1:02:01] to act like Christians and behave like
[1:02:04] ones because it is not us living but it
[1:02:07] is Christ who is living within us so we
[1:02:09] have to live clean and holy life that
[1:02:12] are presentable before him so that when
[1:02:15] God is looking from above he can say
[1:02:17] that is my son when we are walking full
[1:02:20] of Christ so that there is no troubles
[1:02:23] that can come in our way
[1:02:24] diseases won't be able to stand in our
[1:02:27] way we can pray and have the faith
[1:02:29] because we know when we pray things
[1:02:32] happen we know when we pray
[1:02:34] miracles happen because we have the
[1:02:36] Spirit of Christ hallelujah we thank God
[1:02:40] for His grace we thank God for the grace
[1:02:42] covenant so we are accepted this morning
[1:02:46] because that's what he's done for you
[1:02:48] he wants you to receive it he chose you
[1:02:51] you had done nothing special but he
[1:02:53] decided to have the grace covenant with
[1:02:55] you this morning hallelujah how many
[1:02:58] want to accept the grace covenant with
[1:03:00] God let us stand up on our feet may
[1:03:02] God's holy name be praised amen
[1:03:10] let us just bow our heads as we
[1:03:16] Heavenly Father we approach the throne
[1:03:18] of grace one more time Lord
[1:03:20] thinking you or Jesus for sending your
[1:03:22] anointing in our midst
[1:03:24] thanking you Lord for sending your
[1:03:25] spirit you know immediate Lord here we
[1:03:28] come unto you Lord saying father we do
[1:03:31] not want to deny Lord the Covenant you

[1:03:37] this grace covenants Lord the one you
[1:03:39] sent Christ in our mirrors that's what
[1:03:42] we want so that it cannot be us living
[1:03:44] but it will be you living within us
[1:03:46] because we know in this evil day we
[1:03:49] cannot make it by ourselves it we know
[1:03:52] it is only by your spirit that we can
[1:03:55] make it father so he had Lord look at
[1:03:58] your children Oh father God we are here
[1:04:00] Lord yielding ourselves saying father
[1:04:02] may you have preeminence in our lives we
[1:04:05] do not want it to be all about us but we
[1:04:08] want it to be all about you so that when
[1:04:10] you come Oh father you will find that
[1:04:13] which you left with us you will find
