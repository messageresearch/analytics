[22:38] not belong at the time we're just gonna
[22:40] get right into the Word of God we ask
[22:43] that you would turn with us to Matthew 5
[22:48] appreciate our musicians thank you for
[22:52] all that you do
[23:01] Matthew 5:48 and then we'll go to
[23:06] Matthew 6 9 through 15 Matthew 5:48 and
[23:21] it reads be eat that therefore perfect
[23:27] even as your father which is in heaven
[23:30] is perfect
[23:34] Matthew 6 we read beginning at the ninth
[23:40] verse of that particular chapter at the
[23:47] this manner therefore pray ye our Father
[23:50] which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[23:54] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[23:58] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[24:02] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[24:05] debts as we forget our debtors and lead
[24:09] us not into temptation but deliver us
[24:12] from evil for thine is the kingdom and
[24:16] the power and the glory forever amen
[24:21] hallelujah yes Lord I'm gonna read the
[24:26] fourteen and the fifteenth verse as well
[24:28] for if ye forgive men their trespasses
[24:31] your heavenly Father will also forgive
[24:35] you but if you forgive not men their
[24:38] trespasses neither will your Father
[24:40] forgive your trespasses
[24:43] let us pray father we thank you for your
[24:47] grace thank you for your mercy we thank
[24:52] you for being so good to us Lord you
[24:56] have been my all in all you've been the
[24:59] keeper of my soul you have been my best
[25:03] friend
[25:04] you've been my leader my guide and
[25:08] father we just pray tonight that you
[25:12] would have free course in the service
[25:14] and will be careful to give you the
[25:16] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[25:19] name we pray amen
[25:20] you may be seated I like to entitle the
[25:29] service tonight relationship with the
[25:32] father you and I must understand by
[25:36] God's grace just being a church member
[25:41] is not what God is requiring us to be
[25:45] there are a lot of clubs you can join
[25:47] and have a social life but God is
[25:52] interested in intimacy he's interested
[25:56] in having a relationship with us as
[26:00] individuals not only do God does God
[26:04] know us but he also want us to know him
[26:07] we we know by God's grace that the God
[26:11] we serve is the only true and living God
[26:14] he feels all he knows all he sees all
[26:19] and there is nothing that get by him we
[26:27] understand by God's grace that's a
[26:29] system doesn't give you life you know a
[26:33] lot of people are in systems they are in
[26:36] groups thinking that you know groups are
[26:40] going to give you life but the truth of
[26:42] the matter is this is an individual
[26:44] affair and each man is must be for
[26:50] himself I always say in this Christian
[26:54] walk there are times where the Christian
[26:57] must be selfish because we sang those
[27:03] songs if nobody go I'm going if I gotta
[27:06] go all by myself and and you know it's
[27:09] that way when it comes to a majority
[27:13] normally the majority of people are
[27:16] wrong you can start even from Genesis
[27:20] all the way up and you find out that the
[27:22] bigger the group more than likely
[27:24] they're wrong it's the small it's the
[27:27] little group that seemed to be insane
[27:30] and crazy they're the ones that used to
[27:32] have the truth and they're the ones that
[27:34] usually have or walk with God remember
[27:38] even in a time when Paul was here he
[27:40] said they that the people call though
[27:42] this way the way of heresy which means
[27:45] it's the way of being crazy how can you
[27:50] worship a man or one who people call God
[27:54] or the Son of God you must understand
[27:58] that it takes faith to believe
[27:59] Christianity you can't it's no reasoning
[28:03] you can't reason it because you can't
[28:06] say I believe that in Jesus Christ if
[28:08] you don't even believe the virgin birth
[28:12] and in our minds we know that is
[28:15] something that is impossible with men
[28:19] but with God all things are possible
[28:23] what we God is calling for us to do and
[28:26] I do apologize I feel a little weak
[28:28] tonight but by God's grace we're gonna
[28:30] give it our best now we we know by God's
[28:34] grace that God has the way that God has
[28:36] chosen is a narrow way it's a hard way
[28:40] and God said a man that only a few be
[28:43] fine this way is narrow it straight it's
[28:47] not the way that most people will travel
[28:50] but when it comes to Christianity you
[28:53] and I must understand it's more than
[28:55] just reading your Bible hallelujah but
[28:59] you must come to know the author of the
[29:01] Bible because if you cannot read it
[29:04] doesn't disqualify you from knowing the
[29:07] author of the Bible because the Bible
[29:10] said if a man called on the name of the
[29:12] Lord Jesus Christ he shall be saved so
[29:15] we realize amen that now what we I was
[29:18] thinking today and yesterday and maybe
[29:20] the day before that we have been so we
[29:26] have been in such a place where
[29:29] sometimes people don't even know that
[29:31] they are behind a veil in other words
[29:35] there are things that that keeps you
[29:37] from God and sometimes those veils that
[29:41] that we call religious veils things that
[29:45] are that are not so clearly seen but
[29:48] it's there as a wall to keep you from
[29:51] going further because remember now you
[29:55] might think this might this might sound
[29:57] strange but when it comes to religious
[30:00] veils people don't even know that
[30:02] they're behind a veil uh you know
[30:05] because God progressively moves and and
[30:10] if you stop and organize and and and and
[30:14] and set up camp then God moves on but
[30:19] you can say well I know God is in this
[30:21] place or God it used to work because in
[30:25] every
[30:25] anyway whether you start Luther Wesley
[30:27] Pentecostal however God used every one
[30:31] of those times and those men to declare
[30:37] his gospel but the gospel of Jesus
[30:40] Christ is always moving forward it never
[30:45] stands still and it never backs up and
[30:48] so we must understand that because we
[30:52] say we're Christians we must always be
[30:56] watchful that we find ourselves that we
[31:00] may not find ourselves in trapped by
[31:03] traditions Creed's or dogless where the
[31:10] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[31:12] and because Amen you have come into what
[31:16] we call a message you must understand
[31:18] that the message is a it's a place of
[31:21] growth hallelujah you can't say well I
[31:25] believe this message or I believe that
[31:28] God's in a prophet or I believe this and
[31:29] remain there because remember even John
[31:34] when he was on the scene John pointed to
[31:37] Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was
[31:40] the way and everybody did not follow
[31:44] John's advice some stayed with John and
[31:48] some went with Jesus but even then
[31:52] realize Amen that they had to continue
[31:55] in the light that Jesus was presenting
[31:59] to them hallelujah and even then when
[32:03] they saw and they had been with Jesus
[32:05] they still not they still did not see
[32:10] immediately who he was is that right
[32:14] because even Jesus said I asked you
[32:19] Peter who do men say i the son of man am
[32:22] some say thou art John the Baptist some
[32:25] say you are Elijah
[32:26] some say Jeremiah one of the prophets
[32:29] and Jesus said Ben but tell me who do
[32:32] you say I the Son of Man em and then
[32:35] John said I mean our Peter said thou art
[32:38] the Christ
[32:39] the son of the Living God hallelujah but
[32:43] did that that revelation change Peter he
[32:48] had the knowledge of who he was but at
[32:50] the same time he had not yet been born
[32:52] again hallelujah so the very revelation
[32:56] of Jesus Christ
[32:57] doesn't necessarily give you a birth is
[33:04] that right Paul said you can understand
[33:06] all things and have not charity it
[33:09] profits you nothing
[33:11] so Peter couldn't just remain there with
[33:14] that revelation that Jesus Christ was
[33:17] the son of God he had to go to Pentecost
[33:20] he had to continue because amen after
[33:25] the death burial and resurrection of
[33:26] Jesus Christ Jesus said oh whatever you
[33:30] do bring me Peter because remember when
[33:33] Peter when Jesus has gone through the
[33:35] persecution and the trials of cavalry
[33:37] Peter denied him three times but yet is
[33:40] still before then he had the revelation
[33:43] that Jesus was the Christ see because
[33:48] you got to understand the Holy Ghost
[33:50] inside is what gives you power to stand
[33:53] on the word not the revelation of just
[33:57] having it there you've got to have power
[33:59] you have to have strength and so when
[34:03] Peter got born again is that right
[34:05] because Jesus told us that Peter you
[34:07] will be converted but when you converted
[34:11] strengthen your brothers so believing in
[34:14] Jesus Christ doesn't mean you convert it
[34:18] hallelujah you got to be born again
[34:21] something has to take place in you that
[34:25] would change all of your desires not
[34:28] some of them all of them the system
[34:33] systems will cause you to appear to be
[34:36] holy right because remember it men the
[34:40] Pharisees when Jesus came they all live
[34:43] holy they all look good but jesus said
[34:47] now I know better because inside your
[34:50] dead men's bones you look
[34:53] on the outside you look clean all
[34:55] polished up but inside you're dead men's
[34:58] bones hello
[35:00] so what I'm trying to say where I'm
[35:02] going with this is that the only way
[35:05] that you can have a relationship with
[35:08] God is that you must be born again
[35:12] hallelujah you can't be intimate with
[35:14] God if you are not compatible now I say
[35:20] that because the Bible says be holy for
[35:22] your father which is in heaven he is
[35:24] holy now how in the world are you going
[35:27] to become holy hallelujah
[35:30] there is no man that can make you holy
[35:33] no school can make you holy there's no
[35:37] way you can make yourself holy then how
[35:40] are we going to become holy the Bible
[35:43] said we got to be perfect hallelujah how
[35:46] are we going to be perfect is me the
[35:50] only way that you and I will be perfect
[35:52] is that you have the perfect God on the
[35:54] inside the only way you can ever be holy
[35:57] is that the holy God is inside is that
[36:01] right he said listen not only will I be
[36:04] with you he said but in that day you'll
[36:07] know that I'm in the father the father
[36:10] is in me and I am in you a lot of times
[36:14] people don't understand what the Holy
[36:15] Ghost is sometimes people think that the
[36:18] Holy Ghost is a shout and a dance and
[36:20] they're speaking in the tongues and
[36:21] running and rock I mean all of those
[36:23] things are good but after all of that is
[36:26] done what is your earnest desires this
[36:31] is why I try to tell people if your
[36:33] earnest desire is to please God every
[36:36] day that is the Holy Ghost not how many
[36:40] times you fall now because you're gonna
[36:42] fall you're gonna come short but your
[36:44] earnest desire is to please God every
[36:48] day that is the Holy Ghost that is a new
[36:52] birth in you hallelujah and that breath
[36:56] starts off like a seed somebody help me
[37:00] all that you need to make a rapture is
[37:04] in that seed
[37:05] is that right but you've got to keep
[37:08] that seed watered and in the presence of
[37:11] the Sun hmm is that right
[37:16] but what is the Holy Ghost anybody know
[37:19] what is the only goal always the second
[37:21] person in the Trinity No
[37:23] the Holy Ghost is God the Father he is
[37:28] God hallelujah it was the Holy Ghost
[37:32] that made Jesus act the way he acted is
[37:37] that right
[37:38] the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness
[37:40] of the Godhead bodily jesus even said I
[37:44] can do nothing except my father show me
[37:46] now I'm showing your relationship here
[37:49] because what we want from God we want
[37:53] God to indwell us like he indwells jesus
[37:58] now Jesus Christ had the measure of God
[38:01] he had the full measure of God but we're
[38:04] not weird we're just a piece of the rock
[38:07] yeah
[38:09] we're just a part of him so we get a
[38:12] measure of him come on
[38:14] but still yet that manager still have
[38:17] the same potential
[38:19] right because ocean and a teaspoon of
[38:23] the ocean has the same ingredients so
[38:26] you and I must understand that if we're
[38:28] gonna make a rapture there must be a
[38:31] relationship not only just a fellowship
[38:34] a relationship is that right because
[38:38] Judas had a fellowship but he never had
[38:43] a relationship so we need to be closer
[38:46] to Judas is to God than Judas was is
[38:50] that right the problem said except your
[38:53] righteousness exceeds the Pharisees you
[38:57] will in no wise make it that used to
[39:00] just get to me what do you mean Pharisee
[39:02] mean they were perfect in every way they
[39:05] did everything right they watched and
[39:07] they look just good on the outside but
[39:10] what happened is that their
[39:12] righteousness was like filthy rags
[39:14] because it was their righteousness
[39:18] and in order to supersede or exceed even
[39:21] the righteous of the Holy Ghost human
[39:23] righteousness of the Pharisees you must
[39:26] have the righteousness of the Holy Ghost
[39:28] and Jesus said he became my sin that I
[39:33] might become the righteousness of God
[39:35] well I'm coming to something because I
[39:38] want you to understand that this Holy
[39:40] Ghost in you has the potential has a
[39:43] variability has a very strength of God
[39:47] because it is God it is God and I think
[39:52] we fail to see that the Holy Ghost is
[39:55] God is that right that's what Jesus said
[40:00] he said I will pray to the Father that
[40:03] he will send another comforter
[40:05] hallelujah well because when Jesus in
[40:08] the flesh was here with his disciples he
[40:11] was the comforter hallelujah but he said
[40:14] I must die I must go away so that God
[40:17] Himself will send you another comforter
[40:19] he said that the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[40:23] what was God doing he was sharing
[40:26] himself away from the flesh of Jesus and
[40:29] he came down himself on the day of
[40:32] Pentecost it was God Himself the very
[40:39] life that occupied the body of Jesus was
[40:42] now in the body of the believers see
[40:46] that's why we don't we don't need no
[40:47] second hand thing we don't need an
[40:49] imposter we need the real thing right
[40:52] the kind of Holy Ghost had contained you
[40:55] from glory to glory you mean to tell me
[40:58] you get the Holy Ghost you are going to
[40:59] make mistakes
[41:00] absolutely but in all of that you're
[41:04] growing from glory to glory from a child
[41:08] to a fool that's you of Christ
[41:13] hallelujah but I read that scripture
[41:17] Matthew 6 only because you realize no
[41:20] matter how righteous and holy you think
[41:22] you are we we as Christians can never
[41:25] ever say a hold a grudge or say I will
[41:30] never forgive
[41:32] right because if you do that then all of
[41:36] your living is in vain only those who
[41:42] can forgive will make heaven hallelujah
[41:45] because God said if you can forgive your
[41:48] brethren you said what well first look
[41:50] what they did a look what they did to
[41:53] Jesus look what they did
[41:57] hey none of us have had clothes of
[42:00] clowns when I hear none of us have been
[42:02] beaten all night not not more than
[42:05] likely none of us have ever been spat in
[42:07] the face come on and you look and we see
[42:16] what he had to go through and then he
[42:18] gets right up there in agonizing pain
[42:21] they call that word excruciating and he
[42:24] says Father forgive them for they know
[42:26] not what they do right relationship you
[42:34] know I need a shepherd mm-hmm now I
[42:39] don't know about you but I need a chef
[42:41] but I need somebody to lead me and I
[42:44] can't leave myself y'all know what I'm
[42:47] saying
[42:47] you know when I when David said the Lord
[42:49] is my shepherd I shall not want
[42:52] David had full confidence in God full
[42:56] assurance he was a real sheep though he
[43:00] made mistakes he knew that his shepherd
[43:03] knew the place or the way he was leading
[43:05] them and often time we tried to figure
[43:09] out what God is doing stop that nonsense
[43:12] the just shall live by faith
[43:15] wherever he leaves me I follow that's
[43:19] where we must be in order to have a
[43:22] relationship with God we must learn
[43:24] first of all how to trust him that's one
[43:27] of those great Commandments trust the
[43:29] Lord with all your heart and do what me
[43:32] not to your own understanding mm-hmm
[43:37] hallelujah God loves to get you in
[43:40] trouble so he can get you out
[43:46] it's the truth he's a warrior and the
[43:50] only way he can express himself is
[43:52] through you because no man have seen God
[43:55] at any time hallelujah and the Bible
[43:59] said except the son and he has declared
[44:01] him right because he told John this is
[44:05] the relationship he excuse me so Philip
[44:08] when you see me you see the father
[44:11] hallelujah and so you and I must
[44:13] understand the relationship between the
[44:16] father in the son if you want to put it
[44:18] this way or the relationship between you
[44:20] Jesus and you it's supposed to be when
[44:24] you see me you see Jesus but that can't
[44:30] happen until you and I allow God to take
[44:34] control
[44:37] Alleluia and we have difficult
[44:40] situations sometimes think about it when
[44:43] Jesus as a man was ready to take cavalry
[44:46] along he said father I would that you
[44:49] this cup pass from me he didn't want to
[44:52] do it as a man he did not want to do it
[44:55] God don't hold you charge it because you
[44:58] don't want to do it
[44:59] God holds you chargeable because you
[45:01] don't do it you understand me there's a
[45:05] lot of things that are God requires and
[45:07] asked of us and sometimes we don't want
[45:10] to do it but God looks at whether you do
[45:13] it or not hey the boss man say take out
[45:16] the trash you may not feel like taking
[45:18] it out but you're gonna take it out is
[45:21] that right oh you can give come up with
[45:24] all cosmic Europe but it's cold out
[45:27] there it's below zero all I ask you
[45:32] would take out the trash now the weather
[45:33] report right and you know I must
[45:38] understand by God's grace he doesn't
[45:40] what no backtalk he just want us to do
[45:43] it where he leaves me a relationship is
[45:46] a connection it is an association or an
[45:50] involvement a connection between persons
[45:54] by blood or marriage and our relation
[45:58] ship is by both is my blood and by
[46:02] marriage hallelujah because we are the
[46:05] bride and a wife of God is that right
[46:08] because the Bible said look here's the
[46:10] white the Lambs wife and she has made
[46:14] herself ready showing that there's
[46:17] something you and I must always do and
[46:20] that is surrender our will to him that's
[46:24] how it gets done let go and let God have
[46:27] his way is that right
[46:30] oh that's right Philip said Lord show us
[46:33] the father said well wouldn't you Philip
[46:35] what's wrong with you you say show us
[46:38] the father and I've been with you all
[46:39] this time I understand when you see me
[46:42] you see the father hallelujah probably
[46:45] because the father was in Jesus and he
[46:49] already had already declared I don't do
[46:51] nothing except he show me to do it she
[46:54] that was the thing that man could not
[46:56] pull that veil back and see the God
[46:59] behind the veil is that right because
[47:01] when he said I my father 1 those
[47:04] Pharisees weren't to stone him you know
[47:07] why you want to stone me have I not done
[47:10] what the scriptures say I'm supposed to
[47:12] do if you don't believe me for what I
[47:15] say what about the works believe me for
[47:18] the works and that's what I'm saying
[47:20] it's not enough to say I'm Christians
[47:22] without the works there must be some
[47:25] evidence you and I must prove that we're
[47:29] not from satyrs either hallelujah oh my
[47:35] you and I must know you know this is the
[47:41] way the man of God says listen he says
[47:43] let them people who deny the power of
[47:46] God said it wrong but that same power
[47:49] that spoke the world into existence is
[47:52] in those people that got the Holy Ghost
[47:55] Oh see what it is we think we got some
[47:58] kind of water down Holy Ghost there's no
[48:01] such a thing there's no such a thing
[48:03] it's a pretty good Christian you he's a
[48:06] good Christian or you're not and if
[48:08] you're a good Christian that means you
[48:09] got God on the inside
[48:12] it's not either do the works but it's
[48:15] him that's him mean that do the words
[48:17] right and if there be any glory it all
[48:21] goes to God hallelujah
[48:24] listen like I was saying there's a Serie
[48:26] of perfection just like this world is a
[48:29] world of death this world is a world of
[48:31] unperfect right imperfection is that
[48:34] right it's a world of failures and
[48:36] everything so there's a positive the
[48:38] negative this is a negative so the
[48:41] positive must be somewhere hallelujah a
[48:44] place where everything is perfect we
[48:47] cannot even fathom that
[48:49] but it's real you know even even though
[48:54] even among scientists and science amen
[48:57] they have discovered these phenomenal
[49:02] things that that they cannot even
[49:03] explain you know some of them have seen
[49:07] what they call angels and UFOs and all
[49:11] of these things and they know it doesn't
[49:13] come from this world but they don't know
[49:16] where it comes from right and so you
[49:19] look at this thing and you said well
[49:21] brother what are you trying to say a
[49:23] relationship with God will take you
[49:26] there losing your mind now but you know
[49:33] if you read the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel
[49:35] the Bible said the Spirit of the Lord
[49:37] lifted Ezekiel up by his hair but I want
[49:50] out when I see Ezekiel I want to ask him
[49:52] how was that man you said what what do
[49:55] you mean brother books listen God can
[49:58] move whatever he wants to move from one
[50:01] place to another
[50:03] God is not imprisoned by time
[50:06] you understand me God is eternal
[50:10] hallelujah and listen you say what do
[50:13] you mean God took John the John is that
[50:17] right who was on the Isle of Patmos and
[50:23] transformed him all the
[50:26] way to this time well cuz John saw this
[50:32] very United States hallelujah and Jesus
[50:38] remember when Satan said listen I'm
[50:40] giving you the whole world if you bow
[50:42] down to me
[50:43] he even sure what that was no bargain
[50:47] Jerusalem the way they were but he took
[50:50] him in time and showed him the great
[50:53] cities and what it would be like and you
[50:58] can't you could come on you're gonna
[51:00] you're gonna entice somebody with a
[51:01] horse and buggy when there's a there's a
[51:03] there's a car jet or something come on
[51:06] no sir
[51:07] no he showed him the future of what it
[51:11] would be in his Eden this is Lucifer's
[51:14] either this is the devil's Eden he's
[51:18] ruling and he's being worshipped as God
[51:24] and told Jesus I'd give all of this to
[51:27] you if you bow down he says no son I'm
[51:30] the word if anybody gonna bow you go to
[51:33] bow to the word right hallelujah well he
[51:37] knew that through Calvary he would
[51:39] purchase all of this and he renovated
[51:43] every demon every devil everything that
[51:46] Lucifer now holes would be destroy
[51:50] everything even Lucifer himself
[51:55] hallelujah
[51:56] read the book of Revelation 1 angels
[51:58] takes him and throw him in the lake you
[52:07] think I let me stop but you know at
[52:12] least I'll be on the sidelines cheering
[52:13] I don't know who the angel is but he
[52:17] wouldn't bother me none listen because I
[52:21] think the devil is the most coolest
[52:23] being ever and he's a perversion of God
[52:27] just as God's the divine love cannot be
[52:30] explained Satan's evil and darkness
[52:33] cannot be explained can't be
[52:35] comprehended it's just the opposite
[52:37] right y'all know what darkness
[52:39] according to science is the absence of
[52:42] light so there is no light in Lucifer
[52:45] even though watch this now because he
[52:48] used to be the that the angel of light
[52:52] he was the beautiful cherubim
[52:55] now ask tell me anything go down in the
[52:58] depths of the ocean where there are
[53:00] there is no light and all the fish look
[53:04] like monsters shadowing and type of hell
[53:08] where there is no light there are
[53:11] monsters come on about eight you said
[53:17] what are you saying I'm trying to tell
[53:19] you that just like God has has how could
[53:23] you say beautify the meek with salvation
[53:26] Satan has perverted men and women with
[53:31] darkness help us Jesus is that right see
[53:38] that the same power that spoke the world
[53:39] into existence is in the people that's
[53:42] got the Holy Ghost men and women and
[53:45] it's time that we find out who you are
[53:48] the devil is trying to hide you back
[53:51] tell you that you you some little
[53:54] countdown something you're not your sons
[53:58] and daughters of God the deity is not in
[54:02] heaven it's in you that's what he is
[54:07] guarding you not in a stable not in the
[54:11] Bethlehem hallelujah
[54:15] hey men he ain't no pain he's not just
[54:18] in heaven he's in you Jesus Christ our
[54:23] hope of glory hallelujah but until you
[54:25] know what you got you're gonna always be
[54:28] a failure you understand me
[54:31] cuz faith is always tried and that's all
[54:36] every battle you have is the devil
[54:39] trying your faith
[54:41] I say challenge but it's a challenge
[54:43] only when you feel like you got a real
[54:46] opponent but there's no challenge when
[54:52] you know the
[54:53] opponent is already whooped hello people
[55:00] say there was a challenge with with
[55:02] David no it wasn't David I said hey I'm
[55:05] taking your head off and David didn't
[55:08] even have a sword hallelujah he said not
[55:13] only will I kill you Brahma take your
[55:14] own off right by his own spoken word by
[55:19] his that inspiration that came upon him
[55:22] right and guess what he did it I don't
[55:26] care if David would have stumbled and
[55:28] fell and came up and it would have
[55:31] caught the Giant exactly what God
[55:32] warranted hallelujah why because it was
[55:36] God who's aiming the stone not David
[55:40] understand when you got obstacles and
[55:43] when you got enemies
[55:44] let the Lord fight your battle we
[55:48] thought our battles along knees not with
[55:50] our fists not with guns and swords we
[55:53] fight the Lord's battle on our knees
[55:56] that right that's why Jesus came the
[55:59] Bible says we have not a high priest
[56:01] that cannot be touched by the feelings
[56:02] of our infirmities he came as a man so
[56:05] he could feel what you're going through
[56:07] but I've said so he could suck her suck
[56:10] us so he can comfort us that right Oh
[56:14] glory to God this is what it's all about
[56:17] that relationship you know when you can
[56:19] trust God no matter what the
[56:21] circumstances are probably I don't care
[56:24] as a million-to-one you know you the
[56:25] winner huh I know that sounds
[56:30] far-fetched but it's true
[56:32] who's greater than God that's what God
[56:35] said
[56:36] listen Gideon you got too many people
[56:38] huh that cut this thing down thirty
[56:41] thousand cut it on down it went all the
[56:43] way down to three hundred against
[56:47] thousands cuz God don't need the muscle
[56:50] of man all God need is faith hallelujah
[56:56] man listen God said if you have the
[56:58] faith of a mustard seed you can move a
[57:00] mountain you speak to the mountain
[57:02] amount that has to be moved hallelujah
[57:06] you know
[57:06] what faith is it has it has how can I
[57:10] say it faith doesn't never waver if you
[57:15] got faith and you said oh uh I want God
[57:18] to do something and here you hit this
[57:19] way today no you just got hope faith is
[57:24] steadfast I don't care how it looks
[57:27] which way it moves God says so right and
[57:31] that's the kind of relationship God
[57:33] wants from us that when we ask of him
[57:37] believing that we shall receive the
[57:40] thing that we ask for her because we ask
[57:43] in faith a time is no element God will
[57:47] do it when he wants to do it and
[57:49] sometimes God you say okay you got faith
[57:52] let me do it when I want to do it
[57:55] see anyway when you want to do it faith
[57:58] okay witness done faith is already
[58:00] declared is done yeah is that right
[58:03] sees of Abraham is that the truth the
[58:07] Bob said Abraham staggered not at the
[58:09] promise of God
[58:10] twenty-five years he kept saying me and
[58:13] Sarah we gonna have a baby and they had
[58:17] it he wasn't worried and you know
[58:21] Oh Lord what I'm gonna do know when you
[58:25] got a testimony we've got a sister right
[58:27] now sister Karen who operation basically
[58:31] paralyzed her she said I walked into the
[58:34] hospital I'm a walk out she walked in
[58:37] and she walked out then after she got
[58:39] out the devil tried to tripped her and
[58:41] she fell and some other things took
[58:42] place and then she had the lost lost or
[58:45] she had to walk with a walker and
[58:46] everything she called my wife and I the
[58:48] other day says hey brother
[58:50] she said I'm walking not only she says
[58:55] not only will I walk but God is going to
[58:57] restore my hand to the ladies should be
[58:59] dead but it's by your confession is if
[59:04] you give up God will to come true but if
[59:10] you says lord I know you promise me and
[59:13] I'm gonna walk I don't care how y'all
[59:16] understand me why I tell people I said I
[59:19] faith is something that
[59:20] drops in your heart you don't go to
[59:22] school for it yes like when God told me
[59:28] to get that job I wouldn't got that job
[59:30] years ago and and when the man told me
[59:33] after I filled out my application
[59:34] everything he said I don't have I'm so
[59:36] sorry I don't have no place for you you
[59:38] know I didn't cry oh god well no I felt
[59:43] such a piece and by the time I got home
[59:46] to mend and already called my life tell
[59:48] him come on back up here well ha what
[59:51] happened he said no I didn't have a
[59:53] place for you but I made a place
[59:54] somebody help me
[59:57] you mean to tell me God opened doors how
[59:59] the man can shot it but God will open it
[1:00:02] if it's God's will hallelujah I've seen
[1:00:06] him work for me like that oh I could
[1:00:09] tell some stories I've got some good
[1:00:11] things some good testimonies but but the
[1:00:13] point is he calls for a relationship one
[1:00:18] of the greatest things that most
[1:00:20] Christians fail to do is make Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ their friend we make anybody else
[1:00:26] our friend but Jesus Christ is the man
[1:00:29] with the law and he's gonna condemn you
[1:00:31] know the Bible said he came with grace
[1:00:33] and truth so it's the devil that makes
[1:00:36] you think that Jesus Christ is there to
[1:00:37] cut your head off you understand me
[1:00:40] it's the devil that makes you think that
[1:00:42] the Lord is there to punish you it's
[1:00:43] God's do you think he went the Kauri
[1:00:46] just to punish you
[1:00:47] he came to save us and in that saving
[1:00:52] there's a lot of grace and mercy the
[1:00:57] Bible said he Claire do you not lose one
[1:01:03] hallelujah is that Alright God is
[1:01:10] teaching me how not to be selfish you
[1:01:17] all right brother God is teaching her
[1:01:25] you know I know he's tired I'm just
[1:01:28] missing but anyway we're not you know we
[1:01:32] selfishness
[1:01:34] be so small right separateness you know
[1:01:41] it's just just a little you know you
[1:01:43] asked me did someone ask you to do
[1:01:45] something and you prefer yourself when
[1:01:47] you know you've got time to do it those
[1:01:51] little things that that's where God is
[1:01:52] deal I told my wife that the other day I
[1:01:54] said that's what God is dealing with me
[1:01:56] on because you know somehow my time is
[1:01:58] so important but you know the thing is I
[1:02:03] forget to see what God wants me to do
[1:02:06] you see them saying see that's what I
[1:02:09] the Bible said acknowledge the Lord in
[1:02:10] all your ways and he shall direct your
[1:02:12] path that's what we I have fallen and
[1:02:15] failed many times because I don't ask
[1:02:18] God what he wants me to do just a moment
[1:02:21] time and he'll give you the answer just
[1:02:22] like that and that's what God has been
[1:02:25] doing with me he has been giving me
[1:02:26] grace to deny myself and to choose
[1:02:31] others hallelujah she and that's that
[1:02:35] that's the thing because in all of that
[1:02:37] perfection comes right you see what
[1:02:39] Brotherhood I don't understand it
[1:02:41] remember Simon he asked Jesus to come by
[1:02:44] his house and Jesus knew Simon was gonna
[1:02:48] make fun of him but he was allowed to go
[1:02:53] by Simon's house knowing he was going to
[1:02:56] be mistreated now how many of us would
[1:02:58] have done that go by some early house
[1:03:02] they know you're gonna be mistreated he
[1:03:04] did it anyway because he was led to do
[1:03:09] it why because Simon wasn't the business
[1:03:12] of his main business there was a woman
[1:03:15] that was going to stop by Simon's house
[1:03:18] and Jesus had to be there
[1:03:21] hallelujah sometimes God will ask you to
[1:03:23] do things go places and be in places
[1:03:26] that you probably wouldn't normally go
[1:03:28] but when he does if you if you have a
[1:03:30] relationship with him you'll know it is
[1:03:33] God and if it's God he's gonna make it
[1:03:36] manifest your purpose for being there
[1:03:41] that's the kind of relationship I want
[1:03:44] that's what I'm striving for I
[1:03:47] I want that kind of relationship that
[1:03:49] all he's got to do is nod his head and I
[1:03:52] don't know what he wants to be done
[1:03:53] right see you and I must understand you
[1:03:58] know we look back and we think fair to
[1:03:59] see who this created this is the Creator
[1:04:01] we talk about he made life he is life
[1:04:06] whatever bombs or bees or ducks or
[1:04:10] chickens whatever you see God made it so
[1:04:13] you saw what God the God that you claim
[1:04:15] that is in you so if he made everything
[1:04:18] wait why can he heal everything he is
[1:04:22] the healer no doctor can heal you they
[1:04:27] can put your bone back together but they
[1:04:29] can make it grow together what doctor
[1:04:38] you ever known have given sight to the
[1:04:40] blind what doctor you have known a men
[1:04:46] that was able to raise the dead I'm not
[1:04:49] talking about 2,000 years I'm talking
[1:04:52] about in this lifetime I'm a witness
[1:04:57] I've seen to twice me a woman and a man
[1:05:00] raised from the dead did it hit the
[1:05:02] papers no it didn't belong in the papers
[1:05:04] there was a children's bread when people
[1:05:08] think God is there God ain't dead I was
[1:05:13] tell her a lady the other day my battle
[1:05:15] or whatever I went through the cat we
[1:05:16] can say yeah and she said well you know
[1:05:19] God still works miracles a man so you
[1:05:27] saw what do you mean brothers I want you
[1:05:29] to understand that's the kind of God I
[1:05:31] serve you saw her brothers what does
[1:05:33] this mean why are you working with this
[1:05:36] because if there is not an intimate
[1:05:38] relationship with you and God when the
[1:05:40] rapture take place you're not going it
[1:05:44] must be intimate he must know you and
[1:05:47] you know him is that right
[1:05:49] because when there's a lord have we not
[1:05:51] cast out Devils we've done great things
[1:05:53] in your name and Jesus I depart from me
[1:05:56] you workers of iniquity because I never
[1:05:59] knew
[1:06:00] and that word new in Greek is intimate
[1:06:04] he didn't know them intimately he loved
[1:06:09] the Lord I'm almost done I'm not gonna
[1:06:12] be long tonight but I want you to see
[1:06:14] the power of the blood because you got
[1:06:18] to understand what why in the Old
[1:06:20] Testament they had lambs and goats and
[1:06:24] bulls that were sacrificed for the
[1:06:28] believer but it could only cover it
[1:06:30] could only cover the sin you know I mean
[1:06:32] like like you've heard me it seemed he
[1:06:35] Illustrated it was like a bump in the
[1:06:37] road it was still there but the blood of
[1:06:42] Jesus Christ didn't just give you a bump
[1:06:44] in the rug it took away the bump it
[1:06:48] takes away all sin and this is what
[1:06:51] people this is why for I don't know
[1:06:53] whether I won't that hole it goes or not
[1:06:54] it just don't look right that's the
[1:07:00] devil Strait is God don't you know once
[1:07:05] you get the hole I mean really get the
[1:07:07] ceiling of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:08] you are so justified as though you've
[1:07:10] never seen in the first place
[1:07:12] there is not one thing that Satan can
[1:07:15] come up with that can keep you out of
[1:07:16] heaven not one thing oh he did this he
[1:07:20] did that open up but God has already put
[1:07:24] everything you've ever done in the sea
[1:07:26] of forgetfulness and you God can't even
[1:07:28] see oh yes in all it getting the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost is all that is its Lord Jesus
[1:07:37] coming to my heart and just letting go
[1:07:39] and let God get yourself a berth and
[1:07:42] then God to make the rest happen that's
[1:07:47] hallelujah you may feel it at that time
[1:07:50] and you may not but one thing for
[1:07:53] certain your desires will change and you
[1:07:56] keep reading your Bible because it's
[1:07:58] food for the Soul and that Bible that
[1:08:00] word will transform you from glory to
[1:08:03] glory
[1:08:03] you won't have to quit it these bad
[1:08:06] things the bad things will quit you
[1:08:11] hallelujah is
[1:08:14] right the land was just a substitute
[1:08:16] until the fullness of time when he God
[1:08:20] made flesh right to take away sin and
[1:08:24] there now that chasm was out there right
[1:08:27] but now that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:31] has come there is no chasm there is no
[1:08:36] chasm between the believer and God know
[1:08:41] why because when you are united with
[1:08:44] Christ you are in Christ the one I will
[1:08:50] tell you somebody and we we all fall
[1:08:52] short sometimes God said go pray and you
[1:08:54] said Lord I in just about five minutes I
[1:08:57] got God ain't no angel in your weight on
[1:09:00] you when the God wants you to pray he
[1:09:03] want you to pray then now
[1:09:07] five minutes God is going to do whatever
[1:09:09] he else is gonna do and that's what
[1:09:11] people don't understand God don't wait
[1:09:13] on you
[1:09:17] those of us who have children when you
[1:09:19] know what says Oh bring me that book and
[1:09:23] then they stop pitting around doing
[1:09:25] everything else but break did you hear
[1:09:27] me I said bring me that book right
[1:09:32] you're not gonna go a third time well I
[1:09:34] don't write because you know that here
[1:09:41] oh there's nothing like talking to a
[1:09:44] child and you know they deliberately
[1:09:45] ignoring you come on somebody I got
[1:09:52] grandkids and I got some grandkids that
[1:09:54] can hear only when they won't do they
[1:10:01] carry on and do whatever I got to do
[1:10:03] while you're talking to them then when
[1:10:04] you raise your voice didn't like wow
[1:10:06] like no you heard me the first time you
[1:10:11] see and that's what people don't
[1:10:13] understand when it comes to the power of
[1:10:15] the blood there is nothing see we're not
[1:10:20] like God in the sense that God can
[1:10:23] forgive and forget we can
[1:10:27] we can forgive but because we're humans
[1:10:30] we can't forget but sometimes the devil
[1:10:32] says seen you remember that so you
[1:10:34] haven't forgotten
[1:10:35] oh you haven't forgiven but that's not
[1:10:37] true but when you forgive and you're
[1:10:39] earnestly forgive that means you don't
[1:10:41] have those funny feelings in your heart
[1:10:43] no more concerning that person right but
[1:10:47] you will always remember and let me tell
[1:10:50] you something memory is really good
[1:10:53] because it'll keep you from being a
[1:10:55] foolish person is that right yeah you
[1:11:02] know you don't have to tolerate a
[1:11:05] person's bad behavior
[1:11:07] you can even love him but you hate that
[1:11:10] behavior right the Bible said I'm
[1:11:14] talking about relationship of fellowship
[1:11:16] and relationship with the father now I
[1:11:19] say the father because jesus said I go
[1:11:22] to my father and he's gonna send you a
[1:11:24] comforter and who did he send himself
[1:11:27] she cuz nobody can protect you if he he
[1:11:31] was the perfection of Jesus Christ he's
[1:11:32] got to be the first perfection of you
[1:11:35] there's no other perfection there's no
[1:11:38] second holy goes the third Holy Ghost
[1:11:40] there's only one Holy Ghost and that
[1:11:42] Holy Ghost is the same one who
[1:11:44] overshadowed Mary is that right and they
[1:11:49] say God the father's is Jesus daddy but
[1:11:52] the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[1:11:53] overshadowed Mary
[1:11:54] so maybe must be the Holy Ghost and the
[1:11:57] father's the same that's what people
[1:11:59] don't understand he's not three persons
[1:12:02] it's only one but three offices right
[1:12:06] I'm a preacher I'm a husband and I'm a
[1:12:11] grandpa but I'm the same person
[1:12:14] ain't gonna handle my children my
[1:12:17] grandchildren I can't handle my wife
[1:12:21] because I'm grandpa you see the
[1:12:24] difference and that's what God did he
[1:12:26] was God Father in creation son right in
[1:12:32] Redemption and the Holy Ghost in the
[1:12:36] church today the
[1:12:37] same God changing mask now who is he and
[1:12:42] where is he now he's in his bride and if
[1:12:46] the same God is in his bride he the
[1:12:49] relationship will cause them to do the
[1:12:51] same thing Jesus did that's why we're
[1:12:55] called Christians we act like God we
[1:13:00] talk like God we do miracles like God
[1:13:03] hallelujah you love the Lord the Bible
[1:13:09] said that's what he said a little while
[1:13:11] you you'd not see me anymore but yet you
[1:13:14] shall see me right
[1:13:16] he said because what I'll be in you not
[1:13:20] only just with you I'll be in you
[1:13:22] that's what Kaveri was all about that
[1:13:25] God Himself could come down and sanctify
[1:13:29] a people clean him up change them so
[1:13:34] that he can come in and occupy your body
[1:13:38] said brother books I can't believe God
[1:13:40] can occupy your body well God Devils can
[1:13:44] do it Devils come I mean even some of
[1:13:50] the how could I say to the uh these
[1:13:54] these Orthodox churches know that demons
[1:13:57] come and living people they talk out of
[1:13:59] them they act out of them huh
[1:14:04] you ever seen a demon-possessed person I
[1:14:06] have and you say all brother words what
[1:14:10] are you saying let me tell you something
[1:14:12] oh my you and I have no idea but you
[1:14:21] ever seen anybody smoke they hide in a
[1:14:25] cold cold cold freezing but that
[1:14:30] cigarette demon that says you gonna
[1:14:31] smoke me today I don't care if it's 30
[1:14:34] below and then get out there and you go
[1:14:43] like it like like they really enjoying
[1:14:45] it but you see they're cold but the
[1:14:49] demon is enjoying it so your demon won't
[1:14:51] stay with you if you don't let him use
[1:14:53] you come on somebody you don't that's
[1:14:57] why I try to tell people you don't even
[1:14:59] need the Holy Ghost so overcome
[1:15:01] cigarettes you just need to stop smoking
[1:15:04] if you stop smoking that's like
[1:15:07] resisting the devil and he'll flee from
[1:15:10] you
[1:15:10] he will leave you alcoholism the same
[1:15:13] way stop drinking you see what brother
[1:15:17] I'm gonna go through this and I'm gonna
[1:15:18] well if you have faith you won't I know
[1:15:20] plenty of people who never did
[1:15:22] hallelujah
[1:15:24] but so if you do then it makes you know
[1:15:26] that something else was living in your
[1:15:27] body and they don't like the idea that
[1:15:30] you didn't shut down on him what about
[1:15:33] the Holy Ghost and come on somebody the
[1:15:38] Holy Ghost in you will make you do
[1:15:40] things you wouldn't normally do
[1:15:43] mmm when I first got saved and God gave
[1:15:46] me the Holy Spirit I was on the corners
[1:15:48] beating my tambourine and preaching on
[1:15:50] the corners and everything else singing
[1:15:51] and all that huh
[1:15:53] it was what I did I didn't have to say
[1:15:56] who you mean tell me I know I was Elias
[1:16:00] to do it
[1:16:01] something wouldn't let me not do it even
[1:16:06] the neighborhood talked about because
[1:16:07] they knew how wicked I used to be now
[1:16:11] come on some party see them old people
[1:16:13] said well ooh
[1:16:15] we know you don't change the change must
[1:16:19] be seen if there's no seat a change that
[1:16:23] seen it is not something wrong how can
[1:16:26] you cut on the light and not see like I
[1:16:32] said the seed produced a tree viii con
[1:16:35] is that right and you've heard me say
[1:16:37] that many a times when you see a con
[1:16:39] that a con got so many trees in it but
[1:16:42] you can't count the trees in the a con
[1:16:44] you might have a a country and then you
[1:16:47] can count two icons in the tree but not
[1:16:49] the trees in the a con because that one
[1:16:52] a con could have thousands of trees in
[1:16:54] there hello you
[1:16:57] no until his planted y'all see what I'm
[1:17:00] saying in that one little C think about
[1:17:03] what comes up out of that and all you're
[1:17:06] going to do with the letters would be
[1:17:07] planted let it rot and the lifer come
[1:17:10] out of it it'll grow it doesn't come up
[1:17:13] become a full-grown tree in a day just
[1:17:16] like Christians don't become a full
[1:17:17] measure of Christ in the day you've got
[1:17:20] to grow into it
[1:17:21] little by little hallelujah trial at the
[1:17:25] tire test after test hallelujah but he
[1:17:28] knows the path in which he leads us
[1:17:31] that's what I love about the Lord he
[1:17:34] knows the Shepherd knows where the good
[1:17:36] grass is just like the prophet of God
[1:17:43] said if you take the right mentor out -
[1:17:45] - toward any divine promise of God it
[1:17:48] will bring it to pass and I believe that
[1:17:51] I believe just as sure if you say you
[1:17:54] know you have the right attitude about
[1:17:55] God's promised word he'll make it happen
[1:17:58] and I'm about right too close but I'm
[1:18:00] gonna tell you this in my relationship
[1:18:03] you know when you have a friend in that
[1:18:08] relationship you enjoy talking with your
[1:18:10] friend so when you can say you can't
[1:18:14] pray something's wrong with the
[1:18:17] relationship because we're good on those
[1:18:20] phones and we can just talk talk talk
[1:18:23] talk talk never think about how long
[1:18:25] we've been on the phone unless we got
[1:18:27] another engagement coming up you know
[1:18:31] what I'm saying
[1:18:32] but when Jesus get down when we want to
[1:18:34] get down with Jesus you know we do 15 20
[1:18:36] minute prayer and you don't need you
[1:18:42] don't even give god time to talk y'all
[1:18:43] know you ever met some people I know
[1:18:45] some people they talk like they're you
[1:18:48] know getting out no time sometimes I
[1:18:50] have to apologize I sigh I say I'm so
[1:18:53] sorry you call me you could talk but you
[1:18:58] know you get so excited the person is
[1:19:00] calling you and then you jump right in
[1:19:01] there you know and but at least there's
[1:19:05] a conversation that goes on what about
[1:19:08] the conversation that you have in your
[1:19:10] prayer life
[1:19:11] you wait to hear God speak cuz he does
[1:19:14] and the more intimate you become the
[1:19:17] more you will hear his voice you should
[1:19:20] never get off your knees and not hear
[1:19:22] nothing God is not that kind of a person
[1:19:25] if you come to talk to him he's gonna
[1:19:27] talk with you but intimacy brings you to
[1:19:32] that awareness you understand me now
[1:19:36] I'm almost done I just got one month
[1:19:38] well you know I like to say it like this
[1:19:41] I tried to do something tonight tonight
[1:19:45] and as I said I feel I feel so much
[1:19:47] better now it's amazing what the
[1:19:49] anointing will do but when it comes to
[1:19:53] you knowing where you are see you got to
[1:19:57] know where you are in Christ because
[1:20:00] otherwise you won't know where you're
[1:20:01] going and the Holy Ghost in this Bible
[1:20:05] is the only one can tell you where you
[1:20:06] are and you do not please sir please
[1:20:10] ma'am
[1:20:11] don't ever say what I'm not there if the
[1:20:13] Holy Ghost has already showed you that's
[1:20:15] where you are he understand me don't
[1:20:18] claim perfection if you know you're not
[1:20:20] perfect because the perfection in which
[1:20:25] God is talking about you will know he
[1:20:29] brings you to a perfection he ain't
[1:20:31] talking about the perfection of your
[1:20:32] flesh he's talking about the perfection
[1:20:34] of your character and that character
[1:20:37] will be perfected by the Holy Ghost
[1:20:40] because it is the Holy Ghost growing up
[1:20:43] into Christ
[1:20:45] when the word of God becomes your Amen
[1:20:49] when the word of God becomes yo yo yo
[1:20:53] absolute and this is where God is trying
[1:20:57] to bring us you said will you falter in
[1:21:00] this yes because the devil knows how to
[1:21:03] trick us but when it comes to willful
[1:21:05] sinning no sir no not with God in you
[1:21:11] God will not let you willfully sin hello
[1:21:17] the devil will trap you trick you up
[1:21:19] trip you up
[1:21:20] catch you in places where you know me
[1:21:23] but you're not going to say well
[1:21:24] I'm going out drinking tonight I used
[1:21:27] that for an example but any anything you
[1:21:29] want to say you know I say by God's
[1:21:32] grace when God get ready to use you he
[1:21:35] use you you must be holy you must be
[1:21:38] perfect and you know I say these things
[1:21:41] you know why I keep saying I'm I'm
[1:21:43] working with something because if the
[1:21:45] rapture is at hand we must meet his
[1:21:48] criteria we must meet we must come up I
[1:21:51] believe that you know we can't just come
[1:21:55] to church and be church members in
[1:21:56] church this net oh it was good I enjoy
[1:21:59] that in it
[1:22:01] the life of God must be formed and
[1:22:03] trends you must be transformed changed
[1:22:07] this is what I'm working on this is what
[1:22:10] I'm asking God every day to change me
[1:22:13] and make me more like you and every
[1:22:15] little thing I do wrong I want to see
[1:22:18] what I'm doing I want to know I'm done
[1:22:20] it wrong so I can make it right this is
[1:22:26] where I'm at because I believe with all
[1:22:28] my heart my fellowship and relationship
[1:22:31] with God must get greater I haven't
[1:22:35] arrived where I want to be but I won't
[1:22:38] I'm pressing I'm moving in that
[1:22:40] direction you know what I mean I'm
[1:22:42] calling up my friend see he's my friend
[1:22:47] I'm calling up my friend in prayer I'm
[1:22:49] talking to him in prayer you understand
[1:22:52] me you know because the more you be
[1:22:54] together with your friend the more you
[1:22:56] become closer to your friend that's just
[1:22:59] the way it is and a lot of us a men are
[1:23:02] just associates with Christ God wants
[1:23:05] more than an associate he wants a real
[1:23:08] friend that right that's what he told
[1:23:11] Abraham he's at Abraham you're my friend
[1:23:13] Oh best day
[1:23:33] working hard on character denying
[1:23:39] ourselves bringing ourselves to submit
[1:23:46] to the Word of God when I say this by
[1:23:51] God's grace you see a man that's
[1:23:55] standing before you that when I when God
[1:24:00] saved me I had a lot of false had a lot
[1:24:08] of failures trying to walk his way
[1:24:14] you know I had a lot of demons a lot of
[1:24:19] people won't say that but I did I hope I
[1:24:25] did it back now just trying to keep you
[1:24:27] away does that some love it
[1:24:33] but you know we we know that God is it's
[1:24:38] good to us he's been better to me than
[1:24:41] I've been to myself I say that all the
[1:24:42] time but I don't want no trouble at the
[1:24:46] river you know when I die I don't want
[1:24:50] it to be a scary scene you know I don't
[1:24:53] want to hold I want to be on my
[1:24:55] definitely and hoping I've made it when
[1:24:57] the Bible said make your calling and
[1:24:59] election I believe with all my heart
[1:25:02] that when those true Saint Paul says o
[1:25:05] death where is your sting o grave where
[1:25:07] is your victory
[1:25:08] but thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:25:10] victory through our Lord and Savior
[1:25:13] Jesus Christ he wasn't afraid of death
[1:25:15] he wasn't afraid to die even though he
[1:25:17] had to go to Nero's chopping block he
[1:25:21] was rejoicing because he knew he could
[1:25:24] never die he knew that this exit out
[1:25:26] here was an interest to that that land
[1:25:29] or that world to come many men who have
[1:25:33] gone home like I think to myself I said
[1:25:35] you know it's the truth
[1:25:37] education and easy living has been our
[1:25:42] greatest in it now sometimes we get so
[1:25:45] smart we feel like we don't need things
[1:25:48] get so easy easy right you know put your
[1:25:52] dye on your nipple or whatever into the
[1:25:54] Machine and you can get food when it's
[1:25:57] people out there stuff you know I mean
[1:26:00] when we go to the grocery store we get
[1:26:02] these buggies full you know it's just
[1:26:04] easy in America compared to where it is
[1:26:07] in other places and those things work
[1:26:10] against the Christian because somehow it
[1:26:12] makes us lazy but during the time doing
[1:26:16] when the Christian needed God they had
[1:26:19] to pray for the next meal they had to
[1:26:22] pray that God would bless them with
[1:26:23] shoes clothing because they didn't have
[1:26:26] did y'all know that's the way the church
[1:26:28] came up but now they rich and increased
[1:26:31] with good and now they feel like they
