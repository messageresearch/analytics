our gathering and we'll hear his invitation come [Music] again [Music] and i will [Music] again [Music] foreign [Music] me oh that's one of my favorite songs i can always see myself marching and carrying on like a man that's been redeemed surely god has been to us i want to thank the lord from those musicians and all the people who work the equipment that was on time tonight i thought i really say you've done an excellent job i like unity you know i think about a sergeant in the army whatever his platoon is they reflect the sergeant so is it in this honor however this church behaves you reflect me and i have to give an account all right so i just thank the lord for everything that we we're pressing into and trying to achieve i think we're doing better on timing but you know i don't know whether everybody knows but i say to all the the the song leaders by god's grace 10 minutes and 10 minutes before service starts i'd like to see you in my office we'll pray for five minutes give you five minutes to get back out here all the equipment and things that needs to be worked with i want you to understand that everything in the old testament had to be anointed the blood of jesus christ had to be sprinkled even on the camera so everything that needs to be operable needs to be anointed so if you want to come in a half hour like we should and pray over your instruments pray over whatever you need to pray over there's a lot to be prayed for and prayed about i would appreciate it if you can't come that early then text me and let me know you're late so that we won't give space for the enemy but like i said i'm giving you a feather tonight in your hat for the excellent uh song service we just had god is good to us and i think as we go on and get closer to his coming we must become more serious about our salvation all right you've got to understand the bride is not a slack woman she's diligent she's a proverb sturdy she's a diligent woman and you and i must be diligent in everything we do for christ and it has to be by the grace of god and by love if you don't love him your expression of your love for him is shown in the actions that you project so let us always keep that in mind there are times you're going to be late we're humans we we know we've got schedules that sometimes will conflict with the schedule that we're now running but like i said you know we have these phones where we can take we can let each other know so that the enemy won't cause no one to stumble you love the lord thank you for your yo i just been blessed i feel the presence of the lord and you know today i have had some good prayer with the lord i've talked it over with jesus and i learned one thing that prayer is the greatest thing that you can have going on in your life right now uh so we're going to be ministering tonight on the christian warfare we kind of did this down in iowa city but we also want to work with the lateness of the hour if there's a theme i want to work with the lateness of the hour you know because i think a lot of times we are in so uh such a hurry and such a rush to do all of the other things and we forget that this ship is going down the only ship that's going to stand is that is the ship of zion but the tidal waves that are coming our way all ships will be consumed except the ship of zion hallelujah she's about ready to dock she's about ready to dock and i'm on that ship hallelujah is that right brother branham said with troubles will come but we will crest every way hallelujah i'm glad about that tonight amen let us turn to john saint john i believe it is 2. saint john 2. lord has i expected my wife and family to be here i don't know what took place and what has happened but i trust by god grace they're listening they know how it is when they come to being late mercy jesus god is good to us saint john 2 1-5 everybody there and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus were called and his disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus said unto him they have no wine isn't that amazing at a wedding in that day and time with no wine jesus said unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come and i that that have always puzzled me because that's little phrase mine ours or statement my hour is not yet come what how is he talking about and his mother said unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it i like it saint john 12 23. beginning at the 23rd verse of the 12th chapter of saint john and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified now when you hear that word glorify you think about something that's going to be glorious but what they are expecting is not what he's going to be they're going to be presented with a lot of time we realize we must understand let's say like that's the times we suffer in this earth in the eyes of god you are receiving glory is that right that's the way it was with job verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in his in this world shall keep it unto life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall he also excuse me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him with my father honor one more scripture please you know the truth of the matter is leadership we all must be led by the holy spirit but leadership starts in the beginning of your own home your dad is there to lead you your mom is there to guide you but i find out that even in the old testament when children could not obey their parents they were stoned it was a harsh judgment it's a harsh judgment we can't when we can't obey god and a lot of times we feel like because we're family we won't be judged but we'll be judged and the bible tells us that judgment begins at the house of god it's hard for two leaders to follow each other you know they're always butting heads but we almost always would always uh should always understand who who is the leader as paul said follow me as i follow christ saint john 17 beginning at the first verse these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also me may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him i like that he has power over all flesh that's your flesh in my flesh hallelujah and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent i have glorified thee on earth i have finished the work which thou gaveth me to do but listen to jesus this is father i've i've finished the work that's that's a statement i know i've finished it you know finished meaning there is nothing left nothing nothing more to do and now oh father glorified thou me with thine own self and with the glory which thou had and with the glory which i had with thee before the world was i have manifested thy name unto unto the men which thou gaveth me out of the world thine they were and thou gaveth them me and they have kept thy word let us pray father how gracious you are tonight we thank you for this beautiful atmosphere that you have given unto us lord we thank you for the spirit of humility i can remember the time lord when you spoke to peter in your call looking his in his direction and said get thee behind me satan because thou doeth not the things that of god are saith not the things that of god and peter being a sheep was able to humble himself to your word father i pray tonight that no matter which way this word comes whether it come in rebuke or encouragement or exaltation that you give us that exact spirit law that spirit of humility that spirit oh god to receive what you have spoken to us tonight may we hear the voice of the scriptures tonight may we see ourselves no one else not our neighbor lord it's me standing in the need of prayer father help me now help us all tonight that we will glorify you lord that we'll share away the flesh and that we'll look within our hearts to see what our spiritual man needs and father i pray that we will be able to receive what you have given to us tonight in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated christian warfare is something i trust all you can hear me well uh we we we're living in a dangerous time but i think there is no time like this time there have never been one a time like this time uh here we have uh living in the uh uh satan's eden where it seemed like evil has over rode or ridden the the good things god is something that uh is least thought about in this age even among christians even when we fellowship we fellowship around a lot of things many of us and only a little portion of the word is talked about and that's not what god wants our conversations uh must be holy we're living in a time when people lack the love for the truth you see if we love truth we follow truth we try to follow it you know ex to the exact because one thing about truth it cannot change that's why i love god because he's true and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change a lack of love for the truth of god and for god and that's why jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commandments and these things that we may esteem lightly when it comes to god god looks at it and and expects every word to be made manifest through us who those of us who call ourselves the bride we fail to see the spiritual side of things we treat god as a system as i said before and that is the thing we must pull away from if you love me see that's the key to actually being in the place where god expects you to be and to be obedient to god when he expects you to be obedient when we look even at saul who who once leaned upon uh samuel i preached this somewhat last time and all of a sudden the emphasis of samuel switched because all of a sudden it was saul versus samuel's devil samuel versing saul and samuel taught samuel was a type of the holy spirit saul was a type of the believer all of a sudden it was saul in the holy spirit instead of the holy spirit and saul and that's what happened to a lot of christians this is what what happens to us we start out following the holy ghost and then it eventually flips and we want the holy ghost to follow us it's it's it's what we do because of this human flesh this is why paul said i must die daily i must die and you must die daily it must be a prayer life somewhere you got to have it if jesus christ our lord had to pray to keep under the word you and i must pray in his natural humane he said father i would that this cup passed from me none of us like to suffer but sometimes the cup is what god has given us is that right they said lord lord can we drink from the cup that you drank from yes you're gonna drink from it i'm giving it to you a cup of what suffering hallelujah and you and i must understand that if we're going to take up our cross we better do it now one thing i love about brother branham he he he he practiced what he preached he lived it and he wasn't just living for himself he was living for others he guarded himself he guarded the word because he realized that other people were depending upon the very words that he was speaking he didn't just pray for himself he prayed for us this is a little prayer that he prayed in the gifts and calling without repentance he said god stretched forth his mighty wings across this building for these nights and bathed it with his full dewdrops of glory and mercy and power of healing through jesus christ flows through our mortal bodies here and may there not be one afflicted person left in our midst at the end of the service granted lord we love you thou knoweth our hearts more than people know our voices i love that because we can get up here and we can say whatever that seems righteous and really it sounds good but at the end of the day god is not watching the words that's proceeding out of your mouth he's looking at your heart and you and i know that it was a it is a you know i chose this and i said i chose it but god gave me this scripture according to saint john 2 1-5 because jesus told his uh mary my hour has not yet come it's not a time for you to put emphasis on me it's not a time it meant for you to to look at my my this part of of of of of me that that that you want to glory no no no no remember jesus healed a lot of people and he says tell no one don't tell anybody what was it he was not a glory seeker even though he was the son of god if you want to put it this way he was god but in that place that he was in he was about the father's business not his own and you and i must understand that if you see anybody that's seeking glory or such a great reputation they are inspired by the wrong spirit as you heard me preach the last time it was nimrod who says let's make ourselves a name but here was god who took abraham who was nobody he was actually an idol worshiper pulled him out of the land of chaldea and gave him a promise i am going to make you a name see it's all right when god makes your name but when you seek to make your own name you're putting yourself before god i don't care about all of the stuff i'm looking at something i'm looking at promises i'm looking at god what he's promised us to do and i'm looking at this thing i'm going to achieve it by god's grace not for me but for him i i'm just i'm just at a place where i want to be if it's god's will a manifestation of the message of this hour not just a follower not just a church member hallelujah these words that have been spoken by malachi 4 is accurate when he preached it wasn't him it was god preaching to the man and if god has said we will be a supernatural church that's exactly what i'm looking for hallelujah his hour had not come yet he turned the water into wine many times jesus did miracles and he would slip through the crowd so no man would praise him because his hour had not yet come he said i can do nothing except the father show me let me tell y'all something saints of god though we be bright we must never amen glorify ourselves our hour has not yet come and when we see the miracles and we see the signs and we see the uh the the the great things that god do through men the wonders it all supposed to go to jesus christ this is his power hallelujah jesus even said the hours come that the son of man should be glorified and no doubt in their minds they probably thought oh my god we're going to take rome over and that's just going to be glorious he's going to be glorified but that wasn't what he was trying to tell them something must die in order to live that's your glory that's my glory if you don't die to yourself you won't live it takes a killing it takes a rottening out in order for life to grow in you there's a resurrection that must take place in your life here before it takes forth in your life later barely verily except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit this day and hour i know we will have to give an account of how many people we've witnessed this message to and oftentimes i think to myself i know that the anointing of the lord is lifting we know that it is nothing like it used to be years ago and it's now our time that we're we're in it's a time of pressing hallelujah if you don't press you'll have the mind to give up satan will take you you can't stand still standing still is backsliding you must go forward that's right you must face your responsibilities jesus had to face his responsibilities hallelujah jonah had to face his responsibilities he did not want to go to nineveh he was a prophet running from god but nevertheless he had to face up to his responsibilities even though this is a gentile nation they're not going to like me because i'm a jew but god is saying i must go preach did you know what jonah was doing jonah was literally typing out god going for a gentile bride and know that in in nineveh amen it was a wicked city search the history drug addicts prostitution every sin that could be named it was like another sodom but god had seed i love this i love this because you know what god did he rode into nineveh in a ship called grace did y'all know that a fish represents the grace of god hallelujah nothing neil never did it was the grace of god that sent them a prophet there's nothing you and i have done it's the grace of god that have sent us a prophet hallelujah i was telling about the other day i said people want to cut the prophet of god out i said then cut out moses hallelujah tell me the story of egypt without moses tell me the story of no uh of the flood without noah you can't do it he's the main characters hallelujah but we know that it was christ and noah we know that it was christ and moses hallelujah it was christ in jesus that's why you call him jesus christ we look at this jesus comes and he talks about the time of his glorified that god would glorify him like i said it confused them it confused them because they just thought he was the king he was really the messiah i don't know how they doubt it but sometimes i guess we doubt too but they doubt it yeah on the road to emmaus they said we thought he was the one and jesus who's already resurrected from the dead walked with them in such a patience and a love but one thing he said let me tell you something about the word of god he will rebuke you when you're wrong he didn't spare them in their time of sorrow he said all fools and slow of heart why can't you believe the scripture and then he began to preach from the old testament bringing it all the way up and all they could say was did not our hearts burn as he talked with us along the way hallelujah you see it's amazing that god had to take almost the old testament the whole old testament all of the prophets and preached jesus preached jesus in order for their eyes to be open he still had to do a supernatural thing it looked like something would have happened but the bible said god had their eyes holding see what i'm saying god can be talking right to you and if he he doesn't want your eyes to be open he'll keep it closed and then if somebody else is in the audience he'll open their eyes god have mercy on whom he will but my god may the spirit of the scripture the voice of the scripture speak to my heart tonight show me the lateness of the hour we're at the end we're at a time when the bride is getting ready to go through some horrible things and yet and still it seems like people are are walking with one eye or no eyes blind lay out a seal and that spirit is alive and if you're not careful it will envelop you we must as i said we must not be like saul amen in the people of saul amen when they chose saul over samuel amen that king wanted to give uh uh uh take out their right eye and brother branham said the right eye is the spiritual eye there's a lot of people walking around with one eye and that one eye is left left-eyed right you can't even see the spiritual things you can't understand it's not the leadership of a man but the leadership of the holy spirit it was listen that's what god told samuel samuel they that these people have not not uh uh uh rejected you they've rejected me that's how even with the past if the pastor is preaching the word and trying to instruct and give instruction to the people and they're rejecting him they're not rejecting him they're rejecting god and guess what happens to them they end up with a mean spirit oh yeah just what happened to saul saul rejected him uh uh uh samuel and he got an evil spirit read the birth the bible said that's exactly what happened to the believer when they reject the holy spirit god will give them a mean spirit that's a quote hallelujah but we must understand by god's grace that this message is calling for divine love we we preach it all the time right we preach amen you've got to have the statue of a perfect man it's got to be in you those virtues got to be in you that's the rainbow of god that's the covenant of god without the covenant without the rainbow there is no covenant is that right the prophet god said each one of those virtues have a color that goes with it it's a rainbow and god made a rainbow sign amen with noah and then he made a rainbow sign and then with the bride of jesus christ is that right brother brown said i was out there and all of a sudden i saw three rainbows three perfection and they were all coming in the same direction and ending up in the same place and he goes on and said the jehovah god of the old testament of jesus christ of the new there was a covenant a covenant that god has given to us not only just a covenant but a revelation with the covenant that he has given you i mean the revelation of who jesus christ is not was he's ashamed yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not hallelujah but understand he's not only just a god of love he's a god of wrath he's a god that is consuming fire sometimes we think god is some kind of dirty old man he's not he can't change he's the same and the sin that the way he judged sin yesterday is the same way he judges sin today hallelujah you love the lord folks it's important to make sure you under the blood there is no other safe place you must be under the blood of jesus christ hallelujah we we we're in a a situation where we have to be careful first peter 4 15-17 says but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters and we've got so many people in the message who suffers from these things you wouldn't even think that people would steal from god they do steal hello when you don't pay your tithing you steal it no thief will enter oh i got faith and you can't even trust god with your finances but we do it hallelujah we look at people and we see these evildoers we see these busy bodies and that's the truth amen people know more about gossip than they do know about the gospel it's the truth yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf how many of us suffer for because we're christians you know if you don't suffer as a christian you more than likely something's wrong with your fire because a christian can't help but to take advantage of every opportunity that is presented to him to testify of jesus christ sometimes we miss god but for the most part we always want to tell somebody about the savior for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first began at us what shall the end of them be them that obey not the gospel of god hello and you and i must understand this is where the judgment starts right here oh it's not good just to give people just messages of sweetness and everything they forget sweet things always puff people up hallelujah we need amen the sword of god to cut and to go down into the soul that's what it's for if god if this word can't convict you then you're not convictable if i could say it like that god there's something wrong with the heart hallelujah you love the lord see what people don't understand sometimes we can just grieve god breathe him away from us brother brown said when you do that you're done we can send so much old offer give me old law forgive me oh lord forgive me oh lord forgive me oh lord forgive me oh lord and they ain't trying to repent because we don't pray how can you fully repent without prayer can't do it you need to pray you need to cry out you need to sob a little bit right amen if you really want repentance in your heart you get on your knees until jesus comes hallelujah coming from the message breach between the seven church ages brother bram says lord jesus the hours are growing late it may even be later than we are thinking and we are happy to see this hour approaching it is the most glorious hour that the world has ever known for the believer now that's just the way i see it i see it that way you know what really what really what really uh tickled me is that sometimes we have that david mentality i can sleep with bathsheba and ain't nobody gonna know and i can try to get rid of all of the evidence but what you don't understand is that we have a all-seeing eye oh it's true it is amazing you know how people stand in the message and they can have a wife and a girlfriend and thank god don't see him i hope those people are listening to me because i want them to know what god has shown me and we are happy to see this hour approaching it is the most glorious hour that the world has ever known for the believer but for the rejecter the most saddest kind that could ever be there couldn't find words there couldn't find words in the alphabet letters to be to make words that could express the trouble and sorrow that lays ahead and neither is their words could be formed from our alphabets to express the blessing that lays ahead for the believer listen people choose you this day whom you gonna serve i had a sister call me and i won't call her name but she used to come to this church and we love her we always have loved her and uh she was calling and had been praying her son uh paul called me the other day wanting to come to church i said anytime you want me to pick you up let me know and i'll come pick you up and uh you know she wants to come and say sister if god had given up on you you wouldn't even have a desire to serve me i said what you need to do is come and let god take care of the rest hallelujah there's nothing you can do nothing you can do nor can i can't do nothing no man can add one cubit to his statue but one thing for sure we know how to pray somehow how do you pray you just pray hallelujah god will give you the words to pray and if you don't have the words abcdefg he's good enough for him right the bible said that even when we don't know how to pray the holy spirit will pray for you he knows what to pray he knows your needs but if you've got a desire to pray pray i'm telling you i've had i've been see-sawing you know up and down up and down allowing things to get in my way to keep me from praying and i'm gonna tell you something whenever something gets in your way to keep you from praying the devil got a trick for you devil got something down the road and he's going to trip you if you're not careful one of the worst things he can do is take your joy and the desire to pray away from you that's a cursed thing when the bible said pray without ceasing always pray always pray you love the lord coming from the breach amen once again paragraph 3 24 he said grant lord that these people on their feet that standing in their hearts making their confession and willing to let the spirit of god mold them and cut them and shape them into living stones into the house of the lord god granted father i commit them to you now now i want you to understand that this message this prayer is not for the people just back then it's for us now he's praying for me he's praying for you that god will cut you that god would come in and circumcise you that god will come and shear everything away from you off of you that shouldn't be there oh god i was praying today lord share me at whatever cost share me cut i don't care just make me ready lord hallelujah i want to be ready hallelujah hallelujah you know you know i don't want to be like daniel curry daniel curry was a preacher preached all those years daniel curry dies and he goes to heaven and the gatekeeper looking for daniel curry's name whew that disturbs me and the angel says i'm sorry daniel your name is not on the list no it can't be i was a preacher see being a preacher doesn't give you a ticket it doesn't open the gates for you only the holy spirit in you not on you not with you in you opens the gate daniel curry says lord well my what must i do the angel said you gotta appeal before the white throne judgment he said that's the only thing i'm going to tell you he says well what else do i have i don't know what else to do he said all of a sudden he began to travel and as he traveled through time he said the light got brighter and brighter brighter brighter i forgot he said something like a million times brighter than the sun however you said it he said all of a sudden he i heard the lord says daniel curry have you been perfect on earth come on i want you i'm gonna ask you a question have you been perfect jamie said no i haven't been perfect have you ever told a lie yes have you ever been uh uh dishonest and have you ever stolen anything you know he thought he was standing good he says when that light when you're in that light you realize whoa jesus have mercy nothing was able to to just to come out that was good all he could think about was how imperfect he was all of a sudden a sweet voice said the voice was sweeter than a mother's voice says father daniel curry's prayed for me on earth and i'll stand for him right now he said because before that happened he thought in a moment's time he was going to hear the words the word of god says depart from me but you see even though he didn't have what it took and he stood for god on earth god stood for him then i don't want to come to that place when i get there i want the gates to open up i want somebody to say well done you see what i'm saying that's why it's so important to make sure that all of your actions that you're doing for jesus is motivated by love and that love is the love of god and for god it must be it can't be a ritual it can't be something that you're doing for christ hallelujah he'll never owe you older man nothing but one thing i do want more than anything else is that divine love on display on display because i know if it's on display here it'll get me in the game is that right the trouble of this is you see coming from the message god's way he said we stop and talk to to too many people we stop for too many social parties we have so much sewing sewing and organize the stitching party and you know stitch and sew and talk about miss so-and-so you know how it is all these different things come into to the church and we do it in a different way we have dinner parties without our dinner party we talk about everybody but jesus every preacher that's going wrong y'all hear what i'm saying it ain't a holy conversation most of the time hallelujah arguing with brothers and all about doctrines and things of that day that is not the holy spirit when the bible says strive with no man hallelujah you know how it is all these different things coming to the church when you ought to throw all the guilt gully wash out and have an old-fashioned god-sent revival pray through till till you're back heaven is down and the holy ghost comes like a rushing mighty wind and feel the place and the people amen he said that's what we need see and that's the thing i'm taking my time preaching tonight i'm literally going slow on purpose because i want us everybody to really catch the anointing that how late it is the problem of god has been gone for years now the bride should be at a place of maturity hello we're now living in the long suffering of god hallelujah but can't you see that that the judgment and the wrath of god striking the earth you've got to be a blind man not to see it it's like we're living in the days of egypt all over again and as i said in the early sermon amen the blood must be applied not to your house at the home your your dope clothes of your house at home but the doorpost of your heart it must be applied in order to escape the death angel let me tell you like this a lot of people right now amen are sitting up in churches and they're spiritually dead because they haven't applied the blood god told me that i think in 2013 he said in this message he didn't say denomination we know they did but in this message that a lot of people are sitting right up in church they're dead and they don't even know a dead man don't have no desire not here he's dead when you don't have a desire for god and a thirst for god because a dead man don't thirst he's dead in this dimension y'all understand me now he might be in hell somewhere thirsty he might be in hell somewhere with a desire but in this dimension he's dead and when you're here and you don't want more of god all you want is religion coming to church doing your dance and your shout listen that's what pentecost have been doing for ages that ain't what god called for us he gave us life and that we might have it more abundantly we must be a light to this gentile world hallelujah hey don't worry the pressure the squeeze is coming and god gonna prove your religion he's gonna prove it and you're gonna have to face up to responsibility hallelujah when they knock on your door and ask you do you really believe this malachi 4. hallelujah remember i think i was talking to somebody the other day about how uh you know uh how the song became the song i have decided to follow jesus that was a song out of india amen the man had his two child let his two children that get killed and his wife and himself and when the king said i'm going to kill you too if you don't deny this jesus christ he said the cross is before me and the world is behind me hallelujah they all died in faith and guess what that whole tribe of people plus the king you need to go find it and listen to it it's awesome i thought lord that is the heart of every christian jesus first and i'm last whatever the lord wants from me whatever he's obtained for me so be it hallelujah as long as i got king jesus the song say i don't need nobody else huh the weapon about warfare are not conor and that's what we keep forgetting it's the but mighty i like that word mighty there's only one mighty and there's only one almighty mighty through god to the pulling down of the strongholds let me tell you something prayer will deliver more faster quicker than any natural act you can take huh prayer you can take all the medication you want but prayer can kill you in a minute a second how long it takes prayer yeah it's my day when you look at a demon and says no i resist you and whatever the doctor tell you is a lie hallelujah i don't mean no harm and not nobody disrespect but if jesus ain't told me i don't have to believe it right hey they can give me all they want like that like the lady said to brother branham said you know i've studied and my equipment has shown me that there's no way this heart rate anybody that we don't know nobody whose heart rate was that low ever came back back up again that old man put his hand on that that young nurse and says honey i realize and understand you going by your instruments hallelujah but i'm going by a promise hallelujah and that that's what god like to hear he like to see people who stand on the promise we all come short i'm not saying i'm perfect within myself but i got a perfect god on the inside of me and as long as he's inside of me perfect that makes me perfect hallelujah i confess every day i ask in prayer every day i have to cast down imaginations every day i have to is that right amen every hot thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god amen i have to bring that thing into obedience holly is that right listen because if you you're being attacked by a demon of oppression and if you don't bring that demon into captivity if you don't bind him he becomes your god you begin to worship him who you hear your memories to obey that's who you're serving y'all understand me it doesn't matter what it is if you do what the devil tells you to do you become a servant of his jesus say get behind me satan though i speak with tongues and of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or tinkling symbol now come on you and i didn't come this way all this way as a christian to sound like a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol hallelujah he said without charity that's what you sound like you know noise noise and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith and so that and see that's what we do whoo that preaches powerful i mean he raised the dead and you know he he you know he did win how could he raise the dead no man has raised the dead god raised the dead jesus said i can't do nothing except my father showed me it ain't the man and brother branham warned us about that he did he said i don't like it when they say brother branham did right he said i don't do nothing i can't do anything but we'll do that we'll make up we'll glorify a man instead of glorifying god that's the way we do the preacher is great he's a great preacher they ain't never one great preacher and that's jesus christ himself god gave him the gift he didn't give himself the gift hallelujah oh god help us jesus we must glorify the lord jesus christ hallelujah is that right paul said i ain't nothing folks i don't even have nothing and everything i had i counted as dumb can you imagine a doctrine of divinity he said i ain't got nothing i can't present to you nothing any preacher that gives to my uh i've been under that inspiration before oh yeah you come up to stir the people wrong wrong inspiration you're not you're not god didn't come disturb god knows how to stir a person he wants you to preach too he's not about stirring up people he's about change but we'll look at a preaching because he can you know dramatically do things and i can do it the ability is there but i fear god because i want to make sure that motive and objective is in the right place that god may be glorified amen did you see the way he did that oh it just reminds you of those old chickens right those little hands whoo can't he crow i mean can he preach right and that old chicken have you heard how intellectual he sounds brother said what good is it going to do you chick is going to win up 49 cents a pound we all going to the slaughter i tell you what i'd love to see some chickens on 49 cent a pound now i'll be running to the store hallelujah you see what i'm saying what good is your elegance gonna do when jesus christ was so humble he was nothing like the pharisees and sadducees he wasn't an actor he didn't try to put nothing on he was so normal and so natural that judas had to kiss him in order for the people to recognize who he was you love the lord now i'm almost done blame the devil this is what we must do it's so late in the evening people do y'all believe it's late how many of y'all let me tell y'all something you think prayers praying is easy satan knows your prayer time he comes right there to kneel right by you he's right there to whisper in your ear he's there to make you sleepy he's got all his tricks in his bag when he come to your prayer meeting and if you don't resist him you'll find yourself sleep you know what i do when the lord quickens me okay this is the devil i said okay devil i'ma let you hear me pray because if you pray early morning whatever it takes the holy spirit to really keep you awake but when you start speaking it whoo the devil don't he can't hardly take it then vibrations coming from heaven shakes him sometimes you got to cry out to god like he's death in one ear yeah in order to get the devil off your back but once you start cruising oh my you're cruising then right there is nothing wrong see the devil is a troublemaker he's going to accuse me before you he's going to accuse you before me he's going to tell the devil the devil says oh see that brother and he said yeah your pastor he don't even like you yeah that's what he said he don't even like you yeah and you ought to say devil you're a lie no he's right i don't like any of y'all i love you i do i really do so if the devil telling you stuff like that tell him he's a liar you don't understand those disciples that were with jesus they had confidence they had disagreements but one thing they knew they always chosen by god and at the end of the day when they were all matured up and full of the holy ghost they were all willing to die for jesus y'all hear what i'm saying there is no way that you're going to have a church or people in the church amen and not have disagreements let's move on and brother brown said there was a trouble going on in the church and he had to go sort it out he had to come to the people listen it never gets sorted out until you find the culprit you find the one that's causing the problem it ain't sister sue and brother james and john and all these people it ain't it ain't your brother it's not your sister let's hear what the prophet god says if they could just realize that's the devil that gets between the people that's exactly right it's not the people if you can let a brother see that then he won't hold enmity against the other fellow he he'll feel bad he'll feel like well that i feel sorry for my brother see if he did do wrong why it wasn't the brother it was the devil that did that can you imagine the kind of perfection a shoot up in the among the believers because right now the problem is we've got all kinds of discrepancies between brothers and sisters and you know they're gone and they come devouring each other everywhere little stuff little bitty stuff but they need to realize we're in a battle we're in the army of the lord and and the things we go through come on somebody the bible says you're going to cause offense anybody know what i'm talking about you will offend people even when you don't intend to offend them it happens but there's nothing wrong with saying forgive me i'm sorry sometimes people offend people and don't even know they offended them sometimes we have sensitive days that's the truth i do in those days when this when i'm sensitive i'm easy to take the word or take somebody's word in the wrong way oh i'm the only one it doesn't matter truth is true and i have to sit back sometime and i have to realize amen what i'm going through because i'm going through the change of life still yet i don't think it's going to stop until i'm translated i don't know but you're going to catch me in moves that i don't intend to be in oh lord help me jesus it's the truth you're getting moves you don't even know why you got the how you got there right and the enemy always sends somebody with the wrong word it's the truth people but if you don't know i love you i can't explain it i can't make you know that somehow you got to know you say well this guy did a certain certain thing your brother didn't do that and your sister didn't do that he said that was the devil got into them and did it so don't blame the brother the sister blame the devil that's the one who causes it and so now in these church doctrines now they may be very odd to you they may be that you wouldn't agree with them at all but see that's what we that's what we believe we believe it's because that's it in the bible and we teach it that way i mean that's what people do even over doctrines they they fuss and they fight and they strive with one another and they don't even understand that that's not god that's the devil paul said what you carnal you're counter-minded galatians why are you doing this why are you going through all these changes over doctrine do you believe grace or do you know grace hallelujah you love the lord see we got to understand this is a crucial time and the the lord says only the pure in heart shall see god i want to see him when he comes when he makes himself manifest he's already here but when he when that day come that he want to reveal himself and we see him as he is we really see him i want to have a pure heart i don't want nobody's problems and somebody whatever you know try to get in the way i'm i'm hurrying amen coming from the message amen i hope this is all right will the church go before the tribulation the prophet god says now is later than you think it's so late until i believe it's almost too late in america we're just at the end of the road and this morning while i was preaching on babylon in this condition i thought it would be very good tonight to bring in some of the bible to show how close we were to the coming of the lord and we can see we with our natural eyes that something is fixing to take place now can you see that i see it i see it if he saw it way back then you know you ought to be able to see something if you can't see nothing you're blind the world is about it's judged we're in the judgment you call it corona you call it whatever you want to call it that's just the beginning of stuff i think in 1962 brother branham said then this was the beginning of sorrows huh hey it's the truth look what look what one of the woes did for us rock and roll whoa look what it's done to our it has transformed our country just by music and lyrics the devil preached to the people and changed the character of the people hallelujah there is uh y'all y'all know how rocky i don't care how converted you are if you get around rock and roll you gotta put on a straight jacket why because i have your body moving it will i don't know about you but i i've i've had it i have had it done it happened to me at times not anymore had in a long time you're sitting in a restaurant you don't even know your foot patting and then you look down you're like oh you get so embarrassed it wasn't your intention but this old unj unregenerated flesh this whole body this natural man he ain't converted and he loves it that's how you got to be watchful even in the gospel realm because he'll come in there too and when you feel like your body want to move in ways that ain't godly that's it you call a rock and roll it's the truth whether y'all like it or not is nothing but the truth there is such a disturbance among the people listen do you want somebody to tell you the truth or do you want somebody to preach you alive it's the truth i don't understand it but god knows there is such a disturbance among the people you know we sing jubilee songs i beat my tambourine but god knows i beat my tambourine on the inspiration of the holy spirit it's what's in your heart what's inspiring the thing that causes it to be what it is you know it's the truth most of the message people they're so afraid to do uh upbeat songs the answer to when to redeem not gathering it and you pick it up when the redeemed a gathering in it makes you want to jump because i'm going to be jumping now i don't know about you but i'm going to be jumping there's nothing wrong with that the dance started in heaven right okay let's move on i got on to that i didn't mean to but see there's such a disturbance among the people it's just hard to try to have a revival the churches are so different and at each other's throat because of denominational barriers and the christians are so nervous seem like an upset is that right even among the message this one believed this this one believed that and you know what we can't even get together and have a glorious time because of these little differences huh you know what paul asked those disciples of john he didn't even ask him do you believe in the godhead do you understand it oh do you know the thunder you know what he asked him have you received the holy ghost since you believed because god don't care what brand of religion he gives the holy ghost to whom he will hallelujah have you received the holy ghost because all other stuff doesn't matter it's good to know it but have you received the seal of the holy ghost since you believe all the stuff i i'm tired of it you know i just wish i could get me some real believers that can get that can really worship together no matter if one wearing a blue dress and the other one wearing a red one it makes sense no sense to me the very thing the prophet brother branham preached about denominationalism in organizationalism and you and i in this message can't overcome these little things then what does it make us hypocrites hypocrites we're looking at the organization's denomination here and then here we are with our little differences and we can't even fellowship not even on a picnic level it's crazy it's really insane to you and me who say we believe this message but we don't understand what brotherly kindness is um help me jesus one hump camera two ham camera three on camera all i can see is you got a camera at least you got a camera but you know it's strange but our lord said when these things began to take place to look up that our redemption was drawing nine and as we see his great mercy as it's being projected to us seeing his hand of great signs and wonders which our eyes will will be open in a few minutes to watch and then it gives us this most solemn consolation to know that the god of the bible still lives together lives today and he loves his children and he's giving them warnings and these who are spiritual minded come out all right can i one more what we must understand is this we're in a warfare how can you not expect to be tested god said he tries all of his children he puts them to the test to all the devil no god put you to the test job god put him to the test hallelujah joseph god put him to the test moses god put him to the test some failed and some did not but it was god who inspired it right oh even in joelle god said i sent the palmer worm i sent the locust in the caterpillar god sent it hallelujah and god sent those bugs amen to what eat up why it was judgment and that's how it is god will send it right god in this last day say devil you can do what you want to do to him but touch not the oil and the wine god has given him free reigns to you except do not touch the oil and the wine i'm i'm closing on this but listen he said in the message of the three kinds of believers and i'm not going to read the whole thing but he says sometimes believers put to the test not sometimes every time for every son that cometh to god must be chastened tried and trial child trained remember the trials the dusty rose the hot sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heartbeat that material material till she is ready to go into the mold god's children in it is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of god living through them see the trials come to shake you to put you in uh put you to the very bottom to see where you're stand they're tested tried every son that coming to god see you gotta understand this is not a rose of uh a bed or uh ease i'm a christian i'm in this message i praise the lord i got it made no you're gonna be tested till jesus comes the greater tests are coming right the more you mature the harder the test becomes is that right oh it's the truth so i want to encourage you tonight let the word of god caught you mold you shake you whatever it needs to do let it do it you just lay there and say oh you know that's how they got to you know put people even under anesthesia when they operating on them you know god don't do that he don't give you no stimulation amen to stop the pain that's coming you understand me sometimes he'll do a little something for you yeah but most of the time you're gonna feel it heart pain is heart growth it's what god does he ain't gonna take somebody that don't mean nothing to you and cause you to no no he gets somebody that's close this is the thing that i i i if we overlook none of us understand the pain you know that's what they said about brother branham you can't you couldn't even tell his enemy from his friend that's the real deal that's the way we're supposed to be y'all understand me it's true who would have known judas was going to betray and then jesus christ lets him come right up there and he don't give him a high five or just a handshake he comes and he kisses him on the jaw and he said in such a gentleman a gentle uh men way uh judas you betrayed your friend with the kid he wasn't screaming and hollering oh you devil no he let him do it he was a gentleman he was a sheep and that's what we failed see we must understand we must remain under the sheep nature you might have to fight for the might fight to keep it but you got to remain there and let me tell you something we have not because you asked not you can't fool god but your heart i'm telling you you can say all the kind words you want to god knows that heart and when a man really wants the holy ghost really wants the holy ghost to really want to give up their idols because every demon that we worship it becomes an idol but you got to be willing to give up your idol break them up put them in the fire whatever you must do when you come to jesus you got to give up all the things you worship you love the lord this is the last day and i i can't even express what i'm feeling tonight how urgent it is for us amen to really refocus and rededicate our lives to christ it should be done on a daily basis really i battle i go through changes i fall i come short i you know what you know the only thing i can say is amazing grace i don't even know why jesus loves me that song says you know the only thing i say okay you say well because he knew us from the beginning all those things sounds good but it's more to it it's such a deep love that we can't even comprehend the love and i am grateful to be a part of this message i'm so thankful but in my heart i'm trying to do it right and i'm trying to lead right by the holy spirit y'all pray for me and i pray for you but we all need prayer not one of us can point fingers i ain't pointing no pain i'm just trying to give you the word that god gave me i need your prayers you don't pray for nobody else remember me you love the lord let's stand please can we sing that song again when he calls me i love that song that that's a blessing i'll be somewhere listening for my name you can come i just assume the one needs to desire prayer let's sing the song when the save your cause i will answer when he calls me i will hear when you save [Music] somewhere [Music] [Music] if my heart is right [Music] somewhere [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] somewhere [Music] if [Music] my is is [Music] i'll be somewhere [Music] yes by his grace [Music] of jesus [Music] is [Music] jesus is [Music] with jesus [Music] jesus is [Music] who is me joy and peace jesus [Music] sickness [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] jesus is [Music] is [Music] friendship [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] yeah jesus is afraid [Music] you
