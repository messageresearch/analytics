[53:49] morning
[53:53] titled in his presence
[53:56] and while you're turning i did want to
[53:58] make an announcement
[54:02] plan to have a youth meeting in iowa
[54:04] city next
[54:06] next saturday
[54:22] young people if you have any questions
[54:25] go ahead and write them down in advance
[54:29] and send them off via email to uh
[54:32] brother samuel email
[54:35] or brother isaac um and we can collect
[54:39] those questions
[54:45] and he can pray over those questions
[54:48] and review those and then before the
[54:50] youth meeting happens he can come
[54:52] in the presence of the lord
[54:56] and i believe that god will give an
[54:57] answer to every question

[56:22] then you can come by afterwards and read
[56:24] all the way through
[56:25] all right hey man so we'll start with
[56:28] 36th verse and it says
[56:30] and the pharisees desired him that he
[56:32] would eat with him
[56:34] and he went into the pharisees house and
[56:36] sat down at me
[56:38] and behold a woman in the city which was
[56:40] a sinner
[56:41] when she knew that jesus sat at me in
[56:44] the pharisees house
[56:46] brought an alabaster box of ointment and
[56:49] stood at his feet behind him weeping
[56:52] and began to wash his feet with tears
[56:54] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[56:56] head
[56:57] and she kissed his feet and anointed
[56:59] them with ointment
[57:01] now when the pharisee which had been him
[57:04] saw it
[57:05] spake within himself saying this man
[57:09] if he were a prophet
[57:12] would have known who in what manner of
[57:14] woman this
[57:15] was this is that touches him for she
[57:19] is a sinner and jesus answering saying
[57:23] to him simon
[57:24] i have somewhat to say unto thee and he
[57:27] saith
[57:28] master sayon and there was a certain
[57:32] jesus gives out the parable he says
[57:34] there was a certain creditor which had
[57:36] two debtors
[57:38] and one owed 500 pets and the other
[57:41] 50. and when they had nothing to pay
[57:46] he frankly forgave them both
[57:49] tell me therefore which of them will
[57:52] love him the most
[57:55] simon the pharisee answered and said
[57:58] i suppose that he to whom
[58:01] he forgave most
[58:04] and jesus and he said unto them thou
[58:07] hast
[58:08] rightly judged
[58:12] i want to skip down to the 47th verse
[58:15] he says wherefore i say unto thee
[58:20] her sins which are many are forgiven
[58:23] for she loved much but to whom
[58:27] little is forgiven the same loveth
[58:30] little
[58:34] amen

[1:02:14] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:17] amen amen amen god bless you you can be
[1:02:20] seated
[1:02:23] this parable uh brother brandon preached
[1:02:26] on it multiple times
[1:02:31] a few different ways he approached a
[1:02:33] different person
[1:02:35] i know i remember one time he preached
[1:02:37] on uh the messenger
[1:02:41] that went from this pharisee
[1:02:44] the pharisee's name was simon
[1:02:48] and simon had decided that he wanted
[1:02:50] jesus to come to his feet
[1:02:54] as he was putting on a feast and he was
[1:02:57] going to invite
[1:02:58] a lot of the celebrity from around the
[1:03:00] city
[1:03:04] and he made the decision that he uh
[1:03:06] maybe he could have a little bit more
[1:03:08] fame if he invited jesus
[1:03:13] to to his feast and so he sent this
[1:03:17] messenger to go
[1:03:20] find jesus and as this messenger left
[1:03:25] the pharisees presence
[1:03:28] he went looking throughout the land to
[1:03:31] find jesus
[1:03:33] it is brother branham gave out the story
[1:03:37] let this messenger search for two or
[1:03:39] three days
[1:03:41] working for jesus
[1:03:56] as jesus was giving out the message
[1:04:00] and as soon as the message was over
[1:04:03] there was a time of healing and the
[1:04:05] power of god was present
[1:04:09] as all those that had a desire upon
[1:04:11] their heart
[1:04:12] that they would come forward and and not
[1:04:15] one thing would be with hell from
[1:04:16] anybody that come in faith
[1:04:20] and if anybody had a sickness and they
[1:04:22] would come in
[1:04:23] faith to jesus christ
[1:04:37] and he would discern the very problems
[1:04:39] of their hearts
[1:04:42] they had a need that he would just reach
[1:04:44] out his hand and touch them
[1:04:47] or whatever their problem was
[1:04:50] that they would be healed in the name of
[1:04:52] the lord jesus christ
[1:04:56] and this messenger saw this it's a
[1:04:58] message
[1:04:59] but for all that his heart was not even
[1:05:01] touched
[1:05:04] and he just sat there and waited for the
[1:05:06] meeting to be over is it
[1:05:08] he because he had this message that he
[1:05:10] had to get to jesus
[1:05:13] and as soon as the meeting was over
[1:05:15] jesus left the crowd
[1:05:20] a protective circle around him
[1:05:27] and as they would guard him and protect
[1:05:29] him
[1:05:31] to get him to a place where he could
[1:05:33] rest
[1:05:34] before
[1:05:48] is
[1:06:03] that nobody knew about where the crowds
[1:06:06] could not find him
[1:06:08] sit there and he just sit there and rest
[1:06:10] devastated this messenger followed at a
[1:06:12] distance
[1:06:14] as soon as jesus got to arrest him
[1:06:22] and as the messenger finally got to sit
[1:06:25] at jesus's
[1:06:26] feet at this point in his sermon
[1:06:43] i would not take that moment lightly
[1:06:47] if i would have had a chance i would
[1:06:49] have thrown myself
[1:06:50] down at the feet of jesus
[1:06:54] i don't care how many guards were around
[1:06:56] about it
[1:06:57] nobody could have held me
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:11] cleans me from all my habits
[1:07:26] and let me serve you for the rest of my
[1:07:28] days
[1:07:29] i give my life to you
[1:07:33] if i could just bend that messenger
[1:07:37] but this messenger did none of those
[1:07:39] things is
[1:07:54] coming
[1:08:07] and the messenger was satisfied
[1:08:22] if i could have been that messed up
[1:08:25] i would not have given up that moment
[1:08:27] for anything
[1:08:30] you didn't realize whose presence he was
[1:08:32] in the message
[1:08:33] he didn't realize who that man
[1:08:36] let jesus christ was the very throne of
[1:08:39] jehovah
[1:08:40] jesus remember jesus christ
[1:08:45] jehovah was back upon the earth again
[1:08:49] for some reason this messenger was blind
[1:08:52] to them
[1:08:56] and furthermore jesus knew all of the uh
[1:09:00] knew what was behind the request
[1:09:19] to be revealed hey man it's just for
[1:09:22] another
[1:09:22] religious task just for uh
[1:09:26] another uh a a a a feather in his hat
[1:09:32] just another little uh medal he could
[1:09:35] have that we had jesus at our meeting
[1:09:41] and that's just about as far as the mind
[1:09:44] of simon went
[1:09:47] that's just about as far as as much
[1:09:49] revelation as simon could get about the
[1:09:51] matter
[1:09:54] of the problem but when the day came
[1:09:57] for simon's feast on the scheduled day
[1:10:04] that jesus is very faithful to keep all
[1:10:07] of his appointments
[1:10:11] if jesus ever makes an appointment
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:28] all the pharisees were invited
[1:10:32] and jesus shows up
[1:10:36] when he comes to the door there is no
[1:10:39] one to welcome him
[1:10:42] and he he goes in there is no one to
[1:10:44] kiss him
[1:10:46] you know there was other men that were
[1:10:48] welcomed greater than he was
[1:10:50] jealous there are other men that were
[1:10:52] shown more favor at that feast
[1:10:56] and as many people as had received that
[1:10:58] invitation
[1:11:00] it just seemed like jesus christ was
[1:11:02] given the least amount of welcome of
[1:11:04] anybody
[1:11:08] it's always jesus christ sitting
[1:11:25] you know and and and as and she
[1:11:29] had this this reputation where she
[1:11:31] wasn't allowed to come to meetings like
[1:11:32] this
[1:11:37] and as she as she went by she saw that
[1:11:41] jesus was in attendance
[1:11:49] and you remember how the story goes that
[1:11:52] she
[1:11:52] went and sold all that she had and
[1:11:54] purchased this alabaster box
[1:11:56] full of ointments
[1:12:02] looked through the window and she saw
[1:12:03] his feet were awfully dusty
[1:12:20] all the traveling
[1:12:35] maybe he has not been welcomed i can
[1:12:37] welcome him
[1:12:40] where his feet have not been washed i
[1:12:43] can wash his feet
[1:12:47] where he has not been anointed maybe i
[1:12:49] can anoint his head
[1:12:54] where he has been unloved maybe i can
[1:12:56] love him
[1:13:00] where he has been unwelcomed maybe i can
[1:13:02] give him some welcome
[1:13:06] and so as she brought the alabaster box
[1:13:12] she stuck around and came into the
[1:13:13] service door
[1:13:21] and she found herself in the presence of
[1:13:24] the lord jesus christ
[1:13:28] and that's why we're going to entitle
[1:13:29] this message this morning
[1:13:58] i don't think there is anybody japan's
[1:14:00] pacquiao
[1:14:02] that has a right mind about him
[1:14:05] that could have the eyes of the lord
[1:14:07] jesus christ focused upon
[1:14:12] once
[1:14:23] it is she saw the eyes of jesus that
[1:14:26] were
[1:14:27] affixed upon her
[1:14:30] she began to see the love that was
[1:14:32] behind those eyes
[1:14:36] see the compassion that was behind his
[1:14:40] eyes
[1:14:53] she began to think about how unworthy
[1:14:55] she was
[1:14:57] we had to think about the greatness of
[1:14:59] her own sins
[1:15:01] yeah she began to think about all that
[1:15:03] she had done upon her life
[1:15:06] she wasn't even worthy to be there come
[1:15:09] on
[1:15:10] caused her to begin to cry she began to
[1:15:14] weep
[1:15:16] and she began to wash his feet and her
[1:15:18] tears began to drip upon his feet
[1:15:22] she took up her hair
[1:15:36] one of the greatest events in all human
[1:15:39] history
[1:15:42] what's happening right there in his
[1:15:44] presence in his house
[1:15:47] one of the greatest events in all the
[1:15:49] history of humanity was taking place in
[1:15:51] his
[1:15:52] house
[1:15:56] a sinner was repenting before christ
[1:16:04] i remember
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:09] and i went to church almost every sunday
[1:16:12] of my life
[1:16:14] as a teenager when i would read the book
[1:16:16] of revelations
[1:16:32] i would pray
[1:17:14] and i placed one of these sermons
[1:17:20] living in a little house in paris
[1:17:24] and i took and i typed into the search
[1:17:27] engine
[1:17:40] i heard a lot of bad things about
[1:17:42] brother
[1:18:01] and so i hit play on the computer
[1:18:05] and when that voice began to come out of
[1:18:07] the glitter
[1:18:09] the bafta
[1:18:23] for 10 years i've been praying
[1:18:27] i knew i was lukewarm i didn't know what
[1:18:30] to do about it
[1:18:32] for 10 years i've been crying out for
[1:18:34] the lord
[1:18:35] how can i be an on-fire christian in the
[1:18:38] united states
[1:18:51] the same yesterday today
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:15] but the lord i didn't need to be born in
[1:19:20] china
[1:19:32] jesus christ was the same yesterday
[1:19:34] today
[1:19:45] within 20 minutes i was laying face down
[1:19:47] on the floor
[1:19:48] don't
[1:20:00] i found that which i was looking for
[1:20:27] we get tired of sitting in his presence
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:58] is
[1:21:11] we get to that place where he realizes
[1:21:26] undone that's the only way we can ever
[1:21:30] find him
[1:21:32] amen amen and so jesus asked simon
[1:21:38] there's two men simon
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:07] and forgives them both
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:37] oh he had gone to church day in and day
[1:22:39] out
[1:22:41] he had been heard many fine sermons
[1:22:47] he had gone to church probably every
[1:22:49] sunday of his life
[1:23:02] and as he he is meeting in the presence
[1:23:05] of jehovah
[1:23:09] are the the very pinnacle
[1:23:12] the apex the the the peak the pyramid
[1:23:15] the capstone
[1:23:18] the the very capstone of his church
[1:23:24] the author and the founder of the
[1:23:25] foundation
[1:23:28] of his fate amen here is not only the
[1:23:32] foundation
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:24:00] amen because the reality of it was is
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:04] both the woman with the alabaster box
[1:24:09] they were both in the exact same
[1:24:10] condition
[1:24:13] it wasn't about the other learned
[1:24:22] one might be able to say simon might be
[1:24:24] able to say well i haven't sinned as
[1:24:26] much as she has
[1:24:42] amen and so the problem was it's not
[1:24:45] that it's not that he didn't realize
[1:24:50] it's not that he didn't have the
[1:24:52] presence of jesus
[1:24:54] in his house
[1:25:09] constantly god has not left himself
[1:25:11] without a witness
[1:25:14] from the very foundations of the earth
[1:25:18] when the spirit of god was brooding over
[1:25:20] the dark waters
[1:25:23] because life just sprang upon the
[1:25:39] one time moses he uh god called moses he
[1:25:42] says i want you to bring
[1:25:44] you up
[1:25:48] and the elders of the house of israel
[1:25:52] the
[1:26:06] as they sit there that they feasted at
[1:26:08] the base of the mountain
[1:26:12] and their eyes were open and it says
[1:26:15] they saw the god of heaven while they
[1:26:17] ate and they feasted
[1:26:20] on
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:17] up in the heavenly places
[1:27:20] of the presence of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:24] the great infinite god the grandeur
[1:27:27] infinity being housed in a finite house
[1:27:47] hey man and he saw this this uh holy
[1:27:50] place he called it
[1:27:54] a little tent he said
[1:27:57] with the ark of the covenant on the
[1:27:58] inside
[1:28:01] and badger skins died red on the outside
[1:28:07] and he began to see a courtyard
[1:28:12] and he began to see the the the all of
[1:28:15] israel
[1:28:16] guarding around the uh uh the courtyard
[1:28:22] all of them had their they had their
[1:28:24] banner the four banners on the four
[1:28:26] sides
[1:28:29] and he says i saw the banners that one
[1:28:31] had the likeness of a
[1:28:33] ox
[1:28:36] and one of the banners had the likeness
[1:28:38] of a of a man
[1:28:46] and one of the flags one of the banners
[1:28:48] had the likeness of a flying eagle
[1:28:53] he says what put these four banners
[1:28:56] around the holy place
[1:29:01] and the children of israel followed that
[1:29:03] pattern on down throughout their history
[1:29:07] wherever the presence of god was it was
[1:29:09] always protected
[1:29:14] throughout history ezekiel saw something
[1:29:17] similar
[1:29:20] let's start ezekiel chapter one

[1:32:55] inside of itself and folding and
[1:32:57] whirling in a whirlwind

[1:34:51] upon the earth of his natural religion
[1:34:57] far beyond the heavens
[1:35:01] for let me tell you if our eyes could
[1:35:03] just be opened

[1:35:41] the presence of the lord jesus christ
[1:35:44] that these things would not just to be
[1:35:45] trinkets laying in our church jesus the
[1:35:47] son
[1:35:49] or not just be uh little things that are
[1:35:51] good to have
[1:35:54] not just something that you put on the
[1:35:56] front of your pulpit
[1:35:58] or that you have on the wall hanging in
[1:36:01] your church
[1:36:04] lord and savior died for ourselves
[1:36:07] hey man by all of us

[1:36:52] simon and he had uh the revelation that
[1:36:55] simon had
[1:36:58] studied under again
[1:37:01] he was to know or so he thought
[1:37:05] he knew all there was to know about the
[1:37:07] religion of the jews
[1:37:11] but when he came upon this journey

[1:39:01] and i wouldn't preach a message until i
[1:39:04] had seven pages of notes written out
[1:39:08] but the longer i preached the more i
[1:39:10] realized
[1:39:25] speaking i don't have to get onto
[1:39:27] youtube and
[1:39:28] learn all the ways to uh the fine art of
[1:39:31] public speaking

[1:40:26] started out and simon have now become
[1:40:29] the woman with the alabaster box
[1:40:32] my sister forever before
[1:40:47] amen as the presence of the lord has
[1:40:50] been traveling through this earth
[1:40:54] he's always had a guard around about him
[1:41:01] those same four living creatures i don't
[1:41:03] see
[1:41:04] ezekiel saw them traveling
[1:41:07] we saw them flying in the heavens have

[1:43:33] been writing it down
[1:43:34] write down the message to the church
[1:43:36] messages to the angels of the church
[1:43:41] and all of a sudden in revelations

[1:43:47] after this i looked up
[1:43:50] and behold a
[1:44:18] in the heavens it was he even thrown on
[1:44:21] the scene there was one that was sitting

[1:44:58] the jews are in the natural or being
[1:45:00] persecuted
[1:45:05] and now he's in prison on isle of patmos
[1:45:07] for preaching the word of god
[1:45:16] he's gone through a lot of a lot of
[1:45:18] troubles
[1:45:19] he's gone through a lot of the same
[1:45:21] things ezekiel is gone
[1:45:23] but all of a sudden the door is open in
[1:45:25] the heavens
[1:45:27] and he sees the throne sitting up in the
[1:45:29] heavens
[1:45:32] and there's one sitting upon the throne
[1:45:34] and it begins to talk to him just like
[1:45:35] executive experience
[1:45:42] he saw the lightnings and the
[1:45:43] thunderings and the voices
[1:45:47] he saw seven lamps of fire burning
[1:45:50] before the thrones
[1:45:55] amen he saw the the various lights the
[1:45:58] amber light
[1:46:01] he saw all those things and then he saw
[1:46:03] the four living creatures there around
[1:46:05] about the throne
[1:46:08] and he saw that they were this just like
[1:46:10] the uh the flags that were surrounding
[1:46:13] the holy place
[1:46:18] creatures just like ezekiel
[1:46:23] he said and the fourth beast i saw was
[1:46:26] like a flying eagle
[1:46:31] and as these uh uh in revelations

[1:47:42] the building this morning
[1:47:44] amen he is here to unseal the book to
[1:47:48] you

[1:48:06] god was veiled behind a thick and heavy
[1:48:08] veil
[1:48:12] behind that veil he says that veil was
[1:48:16] ripped
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:50:02] i don't have to look at the whale's
[1:50:05] belly like jonah looked at it
[1:50:21] be looking beyond the natural atmosphere
[1:50:24] the door has been opened up into the
[1:50:26] heavens

[1:50:56] bride
[1:50:58] of my friends

[1:51:44] if you could just get yourself out of
[1:51:45] your seats
[1:52:15] all at this little church in hickman i
[1:52:17] don't know but we are standing in heaven
[1:52:19] when we sing those songs
[1:52:24] jesus christ jesus is my plea
[1:52:28] if you would look down and see you're
[1:52:30] not standing on this carpeted floor
[1:52:37] where you are standing we're not
[1:52:40] standing where we think we are
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:12] amen and let me tell you when you begin
[1:53:14] to worship him like that that's good
[1:53:17] beyond these naturals
[1:53:20] where you think you're standing in glory
[1:53:24] you've entered into
[1:53:33] it's like it's like if the the future
[1:53:36] home is like if it went down from
[1:53:38] florida
[1:53:51] placed yourself in the midst of the city
[1:53:54] all the way from hickman avenue all the
[1:53:56] way over to colorado
[1:53:58] all the way over to ohio all the way
[1:54:00] down
[1:54:02] why because it's a city send out from
[1:54:05] god out
[1:54:06] but
[1:54:20] tears
[1:54:35] brooded over the waters you don't know
[1:54:37] this day
[1:54:38] the plan of god remains unchanged
[1:54:42] how much our eyes are becoming open
[1:54:48] or in
[1:55:15] amen those four living creatures are
[1:55:18] still guarding the throne of god
[1:55:22] god is now inside your hearts
[1:55:26] waiting there to remodel
[1:55:29] to transform you into a temple of the
[1:55:32] most high
[1:55:33] transformation where although the world
[1:55:36] has been constructed of the lord jesus
[1:55:38] christ
[1:55:44] supernatural
[1:55:56] you don't have to wonder who you are
[1:56:00] amen but then you begin to realize that
[1:56:04] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:56:05] unto you
[1:56:11] heavenly father brother branham
[1:56:16] at the end of his ministry talked about
[1:56:19] a sermon that he wanted to preach
[1:56:22] called the trail of the serpent
[1:56:27] and i i and i can almost maybe see what
[1:56:30] that sermon would have had inside of it
[1:56:35] just as much as you could preach a
[1:56:37] sermon on that subject
[1:56:54] for you
[1:57:07] what spirit they will received
[1:57:10] whether it be the spirit or the attitude
[1:57:13] of simon the pharisee
[1:57:17] or the spirit and the attitude of the
[1:57:18] woman with the alabaster box
[1:57:22] as soon as she cracked open and unsealed
[1:57:25] that box
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:29] of that ointment began to catch the
[1:57:33] attention of the people in that room
[1:58:03] as we worship the lord jesus christ
[1:58:08] we break out where the albastar box is
[1:58:10] broken open
[1:58:13] for the lord jesus christ begins to fill
[1:58:16] the room
[1:58:18] the pillars of the church begin to move
[1:58:21] and flex at the presence of the lord
[1:58:26] on the outside of the worship service
[1:58:30] because they don't have a revelation of
[1:58:32] their sins
[1:58:44] amen will they sit on the judgment seat
[1:59:14] there is nothing good with him
[1:59:17] the only thing i have lord is this
[1:59:19] little tug upon my heart that you've
[1:59:21] given me
[1:59:23] this tug you've given me this knock on
[1:59:25] my heart's door is the
[1:59:26] only possession i have lord
[1:59:34] [Music]
[1:59:41] oh don't you realize saints
[1:59:54] has begun to fill the room
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:36] as jesus says who's gonna love me the
[2:00:38] most
[2:00:41] jesus says the one who i have forgiven
[2:00:44] the most
[2:00:47] part but let me tell you
[2:00:50] it's not that simon didn't have things
[2:01:07] box because it farmers she was in a
[2:01:10] powerful place
[2:01:12] because she had caught the revelation
[2:01:17] and she knew there was nothing she could
[2:01:19] do
[2:01:48] it's just they just haven't had a
[2:01:50] revelation
[2:01:53] amen they haven't caught the revelation
[2:01:54] of their weakness
[2:01:57] because of surely as soon as you catch
[2:01:59] the revelation of your sins
[2:02:02] judging
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:43] but we're sitting in the presence
