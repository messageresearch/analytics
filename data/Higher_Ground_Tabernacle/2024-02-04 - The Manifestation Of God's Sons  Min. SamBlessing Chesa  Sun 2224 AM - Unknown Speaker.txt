happy oh I've accepted the word of the Lord the revealed word that was [Music] spoken by the prophet oh can't you see why I'm so happy oh I've accepted the word of the Lord the revealed word that was SP by the prophet of [Music] Mal by the prophet of man the by the prophet of Mal amen hallelujah how many are grateful for that revealed word that came to open our eyes and show us who we really are Sons and Daughters of the almighty God hallelujah how many are glad this morning that you can stand call yourself a Son of God you can stand and call yourself a daughter of God and Satan can't tell you nothing amen how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen there's no better place you could be on a Sunday morning that in the house of the Lord others are out there watching games worshiping a ball but you in in God's house worshiping your creator listening him speak to you [Music] m amen what an honor and a privilege let us just bow hands before we open dear gracious Heavenly Father thank you Lord for this opportunity you have granted us to come into your house oh we look up unto you and to you alone David said I look up unto the hills from whence cometh my and my help come from the Lord and no one else this morning we look up unto you Lord from where our healing comes from we look up unto you Lord from where we get all our Providence from God you said men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded from your mouth this morning Lord we are in your house we asking you to speak to us because that word is what we live by so I pray that you speak your word oh God may it not be a man who is speaking but may it be father may you hide the preacher behind that secred desk oh God and may it be you alone speaking to your children because that word will bring life that word will bring change because that's what we know you to be oh God be Jehovah Rafa to someone oh God be Jehovah jar to someone be someone's peace oh God because that's all your name that's your characteristic and Lord we expecting you to reveal that to us because that's what you always do every time you show up you make your presence we have no doubt you are already here oh God we can feel your presence Lord may it not just end in US feeling your presence but may you come in our hearts and Quicken us oh father in Jesus Christ's mighty name the church shall say amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen whilst we studing let us open our Bibles to the Book of Jeremiah one verse 4 and five Jeremiah chapter one if you have gotten there say amen amen am if you still need uh some more time just say help me Lord I mean if you can put it on the projector Jeremiah 1 verse4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the wom I sanctify thee and I ordain thee a prophet unto the Nations we may take our seats amen hallelujah hallelujah in the verse that we read God is tell telling Jeremiah before you were even conceived in your mother's wom I knew Thee I already had a purpose for you before you were born before your flesh came into existence I already had a purpose for you so the limitations of your flesh cannot stop you from fulfilling God's purpose of your life amen amen because when God sends you to do a purpose he comes in to live within you and he carries out that purpose within you himself and in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse if you can put it on the screen says according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his amen amen God predestinated you and me to be his children predestination means determining beforehand before you were created God already predestinated you by full knowledge amen so before you were born God already said that's my son before you were conceived he heard you in his mind you say that's my daughter hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet tells us we already on the back part of God's mind so we are Eternal amen amen this body has a beginning and it has an end but the real you which is your soul does not have a beginning does not have an end so you are Eternal hallelujah hallelujah when Satan was created you were there when the Angels were created you were there when God said let there be you were there with him Hallelujah so I'm not going to let Satan or any demon have any say in my life they can never overcome me because when they were created I was already there you can tell Satan when you were created you can say I was there so you can tell him I am because you are a son of the I am hallelujah huj how many are grateful to God for predestination he called you his son he called you his daughter before you could breath before you could take your first breath he had already chosen you amen amen the birth that we came on on this Earth we were born in Amnesia when you were born you forgot where you came from amen amen our little mind that we have here cannot go back that long back at best it probably gives you fragments of me memories you have when but that's all about it how would we know where we came from if it wasn't for the word than God for the message of the hour that came to remind us amen that you did not become a son when you repented you did not become a son when you were filled with the Holy Ghost but it just came to remind you that you were a son before the hallelujah hallelujah so no matter what you do it cannot make you not to be a son no matter whatever sin you make it cannot take away your sunship it cannot take away away your position in Christ because whatever God says that is final amen am so we thank God for the message of the that came to open our eyes and tell us that When God says let there be light you were there with him so I'm glad to know that I don't come from Zimbabwe I was born in that country that's not where I come from hallelujah hallelujah you were born in America but you are not American you were born in Congo but you are not Cong you might have been born in Tanzania or Zia but that's not where you come from amen you come from Heaven you come from eternity and that's where you're going back that's why we can shake each each other's my brother my sister why because you are recognizing that we were together before the foundation of the world so if we were brothers back then we are still Brothers here and we are going to be brothers when we cross over amen amen so if you have an art against your brother you might as well fix you can't pass around without shaking hands cuz how do you expect to Not Shake Hands here but you expect to shake hands when you cross you might as well start right amen if I see I have to shake your hand Embrace and say God bless you my brother we got to come to a time the prophet of God says that the toxo has to embrace the Calo and say God bless you my brother because we are all one we come from the same place we have the same father hallelujah hallelujah amen amen we thank God for the message of the house your background has nothing to do with where you're going where you were born has nothing to do with your destination you can say I was born from a poor family God does not look at that he looks at where you are going where you are returning amen amen and what people say about you does not matter either what only matters is what God says about because he is the one who has the papers of my identity he is the one who has the blueprint of your purpose so whatever people say about you that does not matter even what you say about yourself if it does not align with God's word that does not matter amen am remember Mary Magdalene magd they were calling her a prostitute Pharisees gave her an identity and they said that's what you are you are a prostitute but when Jesus was looking at her he was not seeing a prostitute he was seeing his own daughter amen he was seeing as a candidate to receive the Holy Ghost when he was looking at her he was seeing his blood perched Hallelujah so when he saw he was seeing his own daughter so when she walked into Simon's house she was a prostitute but after she met the Savior came out of that place a daughter of God when you come in the presence of the almighty God you can never go back the same way you either you go back worse you go back better Hallelujah so whatever you came with today in God's house you can leave it right there amen amen you can leave leave this place I'm a Son of God a daughter of God it doesn't matter what I've done as soon as I get in his presence just contact with the maker things are not going to be the same again hallelujah hallelujah RAB they called their prostitute that's what she did as a profession but when God was looking at her he was seeing the grandmother of Jesus Hallelujah so why the people were seeing her as that did not matter Hallelujah whatever God saw her to be that's what she had to be amen amen he had to change around the movement of the children of Israel just to accommodate her in amen God will change things for you Hallelujah huj why because you are his son because you are his daughter the children of Israel were in the wilderness before crossing over for 40 years if they had gone the normal time for three days RAB I believe she was still a baby so she was not going to be able to feed in God's plan she was not going to Feit in the uh lineage of Jesus but in God's many reasons for their delay in God's reasons for the delay of the children of Israel the 40 years in the wilderness he had RAB on his mind to Hallelujah so he delayed them fit in so God can stop things amen don't let Satan make you think that you are worth nothing Propet God said your soul is worth 10 more than 10,000 so God can leave the 99 coming for you because you are worth it that's why Jesus shed his blood for you because you are I thank God for dying for me I thank God for that blood amen I even forgot to give my title my title is the manifestation of God's Sons amen amen we thank God for the message of the hour that came to tell us that we are bright opened our eyes gave us the revelation of who Jesus Christ and in giving us that revelation of Jesus Christ it shows your position in Christ that you are Mrs Jesus you are his bride amen am so he can transform you it doesn't matter however much dirt you have when you come he will change you he will clean you up amen amen and he will call you his son and he will call you his daughter Romans 8 verse 19 the Bible says for the earnest expectation just keep reading for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen the prophet of God uh he reads this scripture and he tells that all creation all nature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God manifestation means making known so all creation all nature is waiting for the making known Son of God it's waiting for the making known of the daughters of God Amen and if you are a son of God you have God's attributes within you because you are a part of him Hallelujah when you go and look in the mirror you can see some features on your face that look like your father why because you have some attributes some jeans of your father I remember back in the day when I used to drive and travel around with my dad my mom would my mom would call my dad and since he was driving I'll would pick up the phone and I just ask my dad what am I supposed to tell her and I answer and then I just tell her and hang up the phone she had no idea who it talked she had no idea who had talked to her on the phone she thought it was my dad who talked to her cuz my voice and his voice was so similar I sounded exactly just the same as him that was not a coincidence that was genes because I have attributes from my father amen so if I can get natural attributes from my father my spiritual father My real father you and me we have the attribute of God whatever God was is lying within you amen the prophet of God says everything that was in God was poured into Christ everything that was in Christ was poured into the church the church is not a building you and me we are the church so the attributes that were in God they are in you this morning Amen in the power of transformation the prophet of God say if you are a if you are a Christian now a genuine predestinated seed you was in God before there was you always was in God not at some point in time you became in God you always was in God the germ of your life which was an attribute of God so your life before it came down into your body God as an attribute which is an attribute of God which was his thought amen amen so when you came here on this Earth you were just being made manifest Son of God being made known Hallelujah huj so you had to stop whatever you were doing so you can be made known as God's son as God's daughter in it is I in paragraph 169 the prophet of God said Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me amen it says it's God in you all that was God all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church I'm going read that again it says all that God was not some but everything that God was he put it in Christ so when Christ was walking on this Earth he was the fullness of God walking bodily God did not want to end there when you took Christ away from the scene he wanted to be made one with you and hallelujah hallelujah so the spirit that was in God on the day of Pentecost he P it right back into the hallelujah hallelujah to make them one he says that day know I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you in me that's God in you Hallelujah huj so everything that was in the maker when the power he had when he said let there be is laying within you this morning because he poured all of it into why because he wants his sons he wants his sons to be made known on this earth when Jesus was walking on this Earth it was a oneman Ministry amen amen demons and Devils knew that we have trouble when we follow that one man so they were all focused on Jesus when he died on Calvary they thought that was the end of it but they did not know that was just the beginning of it after the day of Pentecost he split himself into 120 and he poured himself into those 120 people instead of him walking around Jerusalem by himself it was 120 that were walking around exact same things was doing that's why they called them Christians because they were acting like Christ they were being like Christ why because Christ was the one who was inside of them as the Holy Ghost now he began performing those Miracles healing the sick opening the eyes of the blind now demons had to worry about 120 people he had more success after he split himself into those amen am that was in the early church we know he's the alpha and he's the Omega he on the day of Pentecost to do the same thing with you and Hallelujah huj the devil should know that there is trouble when we all walk out of here going out different places know Jesus is walking around where is he at he is in you he is in me performing this exploits Hallelujah he said Greater Works than these shall you do it's not greater in quality it's greater in quantity because he's doing the same thing the same work more people that's why it's greater in qu in quantity hallelujah hallelujah so when God comes in within you that makes you an ambassador an ambassador means you are representing a whole country amen amen if you are an ambassador of the United States and you are walking in the Congo when you are walking you are representing United States the whole government of the United States is backing you up because you are an ambassador amen so if you commit a crime in the Congo and you are a United States Ambassador the Cong government is not allowed to arrest you they cannot touch you they have to call the United States say we are having issues with your man come and take him from here they are not allowed to touch him if they touch him it is the same as declaring war with the United States so when Christ comes in you and me he makes us ambassadors of heaven when you are walking on this Earth You are representing heaven the whole host of angels are backing you up as you are walk Satan is not allowed to touch you amen do you remember joban had to go ask for permission and he says can I go touch and God gave him rules you can do this and do that but don't touch him life and when Satan went to God he says how do you think he's unable to worship you when you have put a hedge around him notice it's not God who said I have put a hedge around Jo it's Satan who said you I got a question for you this how did Satan know that there was a because in Prior he tried to go and he couldn't get past so he had to go ask for permission say can I go amen so we have the host of angels that's surrounding us God has a hedge around you there is no sickness that can touch you no trial that can touch you unless God allows it and him allowing it it's because he already knows it's not going to affect you it's not going to overcome you amen the Bible says there is no temptation that's uncommon to men every trial God has an Open Door Amen in question and answers the prophet of God says and when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone it says and that church has power see why everything that heaven owns behind them they ambassadors of the throne hallelujah hallelujah you are an ambassador of the Heavenly Throne amen amen absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and everything that Christ has the Authority and everything that Christ owns belongs to that Ambassador and he said go ye into all the world you are my witness after that Holy Ghost is coming you what is a witness is an ambassador is to come and witness something the whole powers of Heaven is right in your hand why do we said and the church is Barren and we say dorant is because we don't recognize these things so the message has come to open our eyes to tell you and me that you are an ambassador and God has placed that Authority in your hands so you can walk around knowing that all Heaven is backing you hallelujah hallelujah so you walk around Satan cannot touch you if he tries to touch you or if he does he cannot overcome you because God will not allow that has a hedge around you the Bible said the Ang angs encp around those that fear the lord you have a hedge of angels you remember the prophet elishah with his servant gazi was getting nervous he didn't know what was going on he saw the enemy coming and he saw Elisha relaxed he is not scared he is not fearing nothing amen he was wondering why is the prophet so relax then the prophet say Lord Open the Eyes of these young men and God open his eyes he saw that there was more with them than those that were against him may God grant us the grace this morning to know that more is with us they that are against us more are those angels that are surrounding us than those enemies trying to come for your life trying to come to attack you amen because you are an ambassador and God has a hedge around you in in an Expos exposition of the seven Church ages the prophet of God say so when a spirit born spirit filled man and Faith takes the word into his [Music] heart so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes word the word into his heart and places it on his lips that is the same as D to speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man so when you take the word of God take it into your heart not into your mind cuz when you take it into your mind Satan will come and reason with you like he did but take it into your heart and you place it on your lips why that is the same as D speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man your same word has the same weight as though God has spoken it because you're taking that word from your heart to your when you speak it things have to happen your situation has to change you speak that word am Paul said in Philippians let that mind that was in Christ be in you amen amen so if you take the mind that was in Christ and put it within you which is in your heart and David and Psalms he says as a man think in his heart so is he so if you take that mind that was in Christ take it to be within you and as you think that's what you will be that's what the Bible says it says you are an amateur God because you have that man that was in Christ amen that word will come and give you Authority that word will come and it will work within you hallelujah hallelujah so we thank God for the word that came to show us who we are there was a man who was given a spoken word read that book and after he read it he Clos it and went back to his friend and say hey take your book your book called me a buzzer buzzer un yeah you said um your book called me a a bazard and the man took back his book he says oh that's surprising because the same book called me an eager amen amen so it depends how you are reading and it just shows you who you are the word of God does not change you does not make you from being not a son of God to being a Son of God if you are not a son of God it will just tell you you are not and if you are a son of God it will just tell you what you are amen am so when you look into the word of God because now we know the message of the hour has come to tell us who we are when you look into the word of God you don't see nothing else but a Son of God because it just reflects it's just a reflection just shows you what you already are you remember that story of the of the boy in the mirror this boy had grown up in the he had grown up in the [Music] woods and he had never seen a mirror before then he he went with his he went with his mother to visit their relatives and their relatives had a mirror and this boy had never ever seen a mirror in his life then he was walking around scouting the house then suddenly he stops he sees someone staring at him in the mirror he sees a boy staring at him he makes some movements the boy in the mirror copies him as well he waves at the boy the boy waves back at hand so he was wondering what's going on who is this boy then suddenly that Revelation struck him and he got off their running and he run off and he says Mama that is me in the mirror he had seen himself so when you are reading the Bible the Bible is not going to show you nothing else it will show you you got to start jumping and get excited and say that is nothing else that is me being shown in the word the prophet tells us the story of Auntie jamama this lady in tene she was reading the word of God and she saw herself in there she was reading the story of Elijah and she saw she saw the widow woman and she saw herself she says I'm the Widow that's me she saw the sick son and the son was there she saw that she was looking in the mirror but the picture was incomplete the picture was missing Elijah and so for the son to get healed the picture had to be complete the picture in the mirror had to be complete hallelujah hallelujah so every time you are reading the Bible you got to personalize it is not a history book amen amen it's a book that's showing you if you reading the Old Testament God is telling you that in as much as these things happened they can happen to you as well amen when you are reading the story of Abraham the Bible is not telling you to not have babies until you are 100 years old but it's telling you that God's promises they can come to you in a season where men think it's over when you read of the children of Israel at the Red Sea the Bible is not telling you and me to go for look for Lakes to open but God is trying to tell you something he's trying to tell you that God can make a way where there is no way Hallelujah so when you are stuck you can't see a way out you see the children of Israel you got to shout mama that's me and that picture is not complete until that red sea is open your picture is not complete until God opens the way and he delivers you amen Auntie jamama she was there she saw herself she saw her son but there was no elij and she went to pray and she said Lord I have seen myself I have seen my son where is elij and that prayer that she made they had to go look for Elijah hallelujah hallelujah Elijah was on the earth that time and it went around to look for Elijah Jefferson Elijah was not there in Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Elijah was not there it looked around Elijah could not be found but in the atmosphere Elijah was sitting in a plane on his way going somewhere else but because a woman had prayed because someone had seen themselves in the word amen amen that word when it was prayed it could not go back to that woman voice after it accomplished which it was sent for so word was not going to go back until Elijah was found and that word went up into the atmosphere and so Elijah seated in a but something had to happen Elijah had to come in the picture Hallelujah that prayer caused the airplane to have a fault and it had to land in as much as God used brother Bram he was not the one in control this time it was the lest prayer amen it had to bring Elijah down and the plane had a had a fault and they had to land and where they had to land that was in tenness hallelujah hallelujah what was happening God was bringing that picture into Perfection the woman was there the son was there but Elijah had to come in the because the woman prayed Elijah had to come so when you pray it does not matter who you are the Bible the prophet of God says when the weakest of Christians kneel down to pray hell starts shaking hallelujah hallelujah so you might say I'm weak but that does not matter get on your knees something has to shake something has to happen the picture has to be complete the airplane was landed and the prophet has no idea what's going he walks around he's in the airport he was a fisherman he was looking for some bait in the in the in the aane and something told him get out walk in that direction what was happening theide woman who had seen herself aama her prayer was at work and that prayer became a GPS started controlling the prophet go that way he no idea what he's doing but he just following the voice and he starts walking the voice tell him turn right he turns right he is just walking no idea what's going on but the woman because she had Faith she knew because I have seen myself the word never lies the mirror never lies she knew that Elijah is coming it do matter how long it's going to take he is coming right here so she went out to meet her answer Midway she didn't stay in the house waiting for Elijah to come at the door out of the house she went by the gate p and she was W she kept on waiting she knew no matter how long she was going to wait Elijah was coming Hallelujah you pray that prayer your answer is coming it doesn't matter how long it is I can guarantee you that answer is coming God is not a man that he should lie amen he keeps his word ask what you will in my name and he did not say I may do it I will do it after you make that prayer go meet your answer halfway your is already on it way she was waiting on that and the prayer is telling William Bram where to go the prayer is telling William Brown where to go turn right take a walk down the street turn left take a walk down this street and the woman is standing there I believe that street was a busy street she was seeing a lot of people but when she saw Elijah she knew who that was amen when God answers your prayer you will not be confused amen you will know that this is God and you will know that
