TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they needed amen but they wanted it in their own way they want it the way they they thought was bad but God knows how to send it in the way that he knows it's best because he's an infinite God and he knows just how to send it he knows your needs he knows how to bring it to you but the trouble of it is because it don't come the way you think it ought to come then you're all discouraged and you hand it back to him let's ask him and believe that he'll just the way he wants to S it and accept it upon the bis if you asked him don't make him a liar he can't lie he promised ask the father anything in my name I'll do it God can't lie ask him and it shall be done seek you shall find knock it'll be open we believe that certainly we do they got a major so what did they do as this little baby in a major is that the mighty king they refused him yes sir why he didn't come the way they expected him to come and friends you might think that was a horrible thing it was but you know we're guilty of the same thing we are guilty of the same thing we ask God for things and then we walk around and if he don't just pour something on us and give us something that uh we think we ought to have then we just hand it back don't do that ask them stay right with it hold on to it if you know it's real and what's more real than the word of God and the word of God is made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ

hallelujah [Music] hallelujah oh Lord [Music] Hallelujah the hallelujah hallelujah When the Saints Go Marching In amen amen hallelujah God is good to us amen we're just going to go right into the scripture thank God for the musicians we're not going to try to give you all at once tonight but we want to uh do this particular message in Parts I think it would be maybe three-part message and so anyway I trust the Lord will bless us when thinking about the message in which God has given me I was I've been thinking about the Passover uh when the death angel is was passing through the land everybody had to make make sure the blood had been applied and while the blood was being applied uh they were eating herbs and roasted lamb bitter herbs bitter herbs showing that the message bring bitterness as well even when God told John to eat the book said it would be sweet to your taste uh but bitter to your stomach so we know that the message or the word of God has a a sweetness to it but it also has a bitterness to it amen so as we stand let us turn to Ephesians 5 and when I read this I want you to know I'm not going to preach on marriage and divorce but I needed scripture to help me uh explain the order in which God has placed things in and and from this uh book of Ephesians we're going to ask that you also turn to Colossians the first chapter 15- 18 you have Ephesians 5 says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the [Music] body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wise be to their hus their own husbands in everything husband love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word am this is a part I like that he might present it unto himself a glorious Church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without [Music] blemish so all men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself Colossians 1:15 is it warm in here or is it just me feel like I'm steaming up here thank you Colossians 1:15 through 18 who is in the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature [Music] for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible invisible whether there be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for [Music] him for he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence uh let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you as humbly as we thank you as we know how we thank you Father God for your goodness we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy we thank you for being here we pray Lord God tonight that you will make yourself manifest through Thy Word in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated we want to welome welcome all visitors and we trust that you will make yourself home and uh just just uh uh if you keep in prayer I believe and trust that the Lord will bless you we we love the word here uh it is our headship and uh we we really appreciate your being here amen glad to see our brother Mike he always know when I'm going get I'm about to call him he shows up we are in the last days and we know that we have traveled uh from one Church age to another starting from Ephesus all the way up to the leoan church age we have seen changes that God has allowed throughout the church ages with with the uh True Vine and the false Vine and we have seen how Satan has cloaked his work with religion and he has made the true Christians this way he has made Christians forget the purpose uh for the uh for which they were saved amen that's true we have come in this day to excel the church age before us and we call this age the bride age because we believe it is in this age the Bride of Jesus Christ will take a translation she will be raptured and she will be not part of the word but she will be all of the word hallelujah she is a mature Christian Hallelujah and she is one who died in order to live see you have to die die before you could live if you understand me the Pharisees and the Sadducees they didn't get mad with Jesus until Lazarus was raised from the dead they may have questioned uh Jar's daughter they may have questioned the man who was raised from the dead of the boy but when Jesus raised Lazarus it made the crowd so angry literally wanted to kill Lazarus all over again it's always a true Resurrection those who have the resurrection are the people that make those who do not have the resurrection angry uh because we realize that the resurrection is not a show we understand the resurrection is a person Hallelujah the resurrection is Jesus Christ that right he said I am the resurrection I am the life hallelujah it's not church chanity it's not your denomination or organization it is a living word hallelujah it is truly the voice of God speaking to the elected of that of their day is that right now I wanted to bring all of this to say all of this because there is a time when everything was in order there was no correcting Adam and his wife lived harmoniously uh the only thing they had to be careful of is serpent because he was the most subtle beast in the field and remember when God uh created Adam he created Adam as a ruler [Music] and not as a ruler only but a protector he was to rule the Earth protect the Garden of Eden is that right everything was obedient to the voice of Adam because within Adam was the voice of God is that right because the Bible says that God himself self breath into the nostrils of of Adam and that was when Adam became a living Soul Adam amen was made and created Hallelujah with his theophany Hallelujah so he was a strong man he was a man that could not be deceived Hallelujah but because of Eve the feminine part of Adam she was the weaker part Hallelujah she was designed the way she was designed when God when she fell it wasn't like she willfully sinned the Bible say she was beguiled she was deceived Hallelujah but Adam did not he was not deceived Adam willfully sinned but he had to do it to save Eve at that time her name was not Eve according to Genesis 5 her name was Adam as well and the reason being the reason they had the same name because they had the same character Hallelujah they were both made in the image and likeness of God and according to Genesis 5 said God said he made them male and female Hallelujah and called their name Adam now you see the order God's order was always like that when he created the plants it was male and female when he created the trees it was male and female when he C created the animals it was male and female that was God's order now let me tell you like this when you break the order of God hallelujah it plunge you into what we call chaos I don't know what the world before this one was like but when God came to brew over it the Bible said the world was in chaos everything was out of order Hallelujah now some people say I won't say this a scriptural but I say some people say that when the Battle of Lucifer went on Hallelujah it was a reason why the world was in chaos I don't know how true that is but something caused the chaos you better hear what I'm saying because God is not not a god of confusion God doesn't bring chaos and the only being that we know that brings chaos is Lucifer himself because we realize that this battle that we're going through did not stop on earth started in heaven is that right where Lucifer told the lie hallelu and Angels believed him is that right and he and his angels was cast out of Heaven they were put into another dimension Hallelujah is that right in that same battle came to fight the image of God hallelujah and when he came he didn't go to Adam see the devil smart he went to the Miss Adam he went to the female Hallelujah because he knew she was the one that could bring the reproduction Hallelujah he brought his science Eve and Eve believed His science thought was good Hallelujah so the devil tried his science on Eve Hallelujah and then he brought the science brought it to Adam but you know what all Adam had to say was that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he could have resisted but he was ordained as a protector he was ordained as a provider he was ordained as a savior and so therefore he had to save eve even though it cost him his life is that right the Adam called Jesus Christ had to do the same thing he did no sin but the Bible said he became sin that we might become the righteousness of God it was because of the shedding of his blood Carrie was more than just saving people Calvary came to restore it came to restore everything man had lost in the fall it came to restore sunship it came to restore the authority is that right because remember the word of God says after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power that word power means Authority because that's what Adam lost he had no rulership over Satan anymore because he forfeited his kingdom to Satan is that the Bible it's absolutely the truth that's why Satan had how could had the ability to take Jesus upon on the mountain Satan had the ability to Temp Jesus in the wilderness yall hear what I'm saying because it was Satan's kingdom this is Satan's world this is what we call Satan's Eden he had a right and listen what he says if you bow down to me I will give you all of this he owned everything it used to belong to the first Adam now the second Adam Jesus Christ is come to redeem to take back what was taken from us hallelujah you see that's why I'm jumping a little bit I told you it's going to be in in different parts but you see that's why there will be no no babies in heaven everybody think you're going to see a baby it will not be a baby babies came by the way of the Fall Hallelujah I don't care who that baby is whether it be male or female if they are elected and chosen by God when they die by the time they get to heaven they're about an 18y old Hallelujah yes sir won't be no changing of diapers there Hallelujah won't be no bottle feeding you see let me let me I'm moving faster than what I should go but we were made in the image and likeness of God and and and even the scripture says did not I say ye are God now we are not the god there's only one God but we're part of the family of God we are the children of God y'all hear what I'm saying it was I was in a horse family I wouldn't be a pig I wouldn't be a donkey I wouldn't be a sheep if I was in the family of a horse I would be a Hallelujah and that is the way that works that's why the Bible calls us Sons and Daughters of God because if God would have a Offspring he could not produce anything other than himself the law that's the word the order in Genesis is shall bring forth of its kind hallel so God him himself humbled himself and became a seed he was able to lock all of his attributes in a seed yall hear me is that right cuz the Bible says that there was a good SE and he went to S seed he saw good seeds and those seeds were God there was another s he sld tears Hallelujah and he was of the wicked one here what I'm saying here so when Eve broke the order of God because men was supposed to be born and birth by the spoken word hallelujah did you not know that when the church first started on the day of Pentecost it was the preaching of the word they heard the word and they received the seed of the word hallelujah and it was there they were burn with the Holy Ghost and Fire y'all hear what I'm saying it was a spoken word y'all hear what I'm saying I'm say it again that order has not changed say I want the Holy Ghost it's supposed to be the preaching of the word that gives you the power of the Holy Ghost it's never changed amen hallelujah hallelujah see God has order the Sun by Day rules the the heavens the Moon by Night rules the heaven and the Stars y'all know how it works Hallelujah and ever since creation they have all remained in the same place people say I saw star no you didn't that might have been an asteroid or a piece of rock of some sort but the star they are stationed and the position in which God placed them in from the beginning they're still there Hallelujah is that right Orion is still there Orion is still there ples is still there Hallelujah Aquarius is still there all of those zodiac signs are still there not one star added and not one taken away yall better hear me so the stars are numbered hallelu this is why God said to Abraham look at of the sea I will multiply your children as such he didn't just leave us in the dust of the Earth but he says now look at into the heavens see those Stars they represent you Hallelujah can you count them hallelujah oh that devil thought by breaking the order of God here that he would cause chaos in the plan of God but he did not see he didn't understand that in the heart and mind of God saw himself as a savior Hallelujah I know y'all know these things but in order to be a savior there had to be someone that needed saving he saw himself as a Healer and in order to heal there had to be someone sick and the only perverted one that was there that could do that was Lucifer himself That Old Devil so in reality God used him to bring out of him his attributes hallelujah amen don't you realize that no matter what you do whatever happens to you God is in control Hallelujah he never fails yes sir glory to God they were so shocked and I'm going go on now go back to my notes they were so shocked when they were on the sea and the wind and the w caves began to toss the ship about Hallelujah is that right the sail broke and the ores broke and water start flooding the ship and here was Jesus in the bottom of the ship Hallelujah they didn't not see who he really was Hallelujah he was a man yet he was God y'all hear what I'm saying see the man part was asleep but the god part never sleep nor Slumber Hallelujah he didn't wake up in confusion but he woke up in control hear me he wasn't disturbed by the demons in the sea he wasn't disturbed by the demons Amen in the wind he wasn't disturbed by anything he literally had undisturbed Faith he stood on that boat like I said the other day please be still he didn't have the address to wind he didn't have the address to Sea he didn't have to address nothing but all all of those demons recognized who he was and had to Humble themselves and the storm had to cease y'all hear what I'm saying because I'm talking about Jesus but where is Jesus now time about coming to maturity coming to a place that we must allow God to place us back in in order because once the order is restored the image and the likeness is restored too y'all hear what I'm saying people don't understand how order is so important Hallelujah but order is uh is important because God is a god of order read the Bible every time Israel got out of order chaos Hallelujah all they had to do was follow the word and the word would keep was going to keep them in the proper order Hallelujah is that right the Bible said the first commandment he says love the Lord thy God with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul that was the first order Hallelujah and when you break that order expect chaos expect confusion if you don't love the Lord with all your heart your heart your life is going to be full of confusion and despair Hallelujah is that right that's why the Bible says trust the Lord and lean not to your own understanding but ackowledge him in all of your ways and he shall direct your path he's the leader the sheer the guide Hallelujah he is the only one that can lead and guide us into all truth hallelujah is that right all all the first Adam had to do would say uh I love you Adam Hallelujah but I can't do that cuz I must stay with the truth but had he done that uh the very plan of God would haveed Hallelujah because when God saw you and me he saw us as Sinners he knew we were Saints because we were with him before the foundation of the world but we have to travel to this Dimension we had to put on a robe of Flesh a Rob of sinful flesh Hallelujah because God wanted to prove to Lucifer you can take a man and bring him to the lowest State Hallelujah but as long as he got my seed in him he shall Prevail he's going to conquer every darkness that every stronghold everything you put on him I'm going to show you that the man that I create is your god yes sir amen amen y'all better hear what I'm saying Satan is not our God hallelujah amen right now the Bible said is all it all depends on who you you yield your members to obey Hallelujah if you're going to serve the Devil he's your God but if you going to serve the Lord Jesus Christ he's your God hallelujah like the B said choose you this day and who you're going to serve let's get back to the scripture here Genesis 1 26- 27 you love the Lord see we we must understand by the grace of God image likeness and Order Hallelujah they were all in the order of God everything was even the name of the of the animals was in the order of God and Adam was the head of the garden Hallelujah that God was the head of Adam because when Adam forfeited his right to the Garden the real owner came to claim and possess the land y'all hear what I'm saying is that right the Bible say when Adam and Eve fell God walked in the cool of the evening and he said Where Art Thou Adam showing that Adam was the man in authority where thou is that the truth he didn't say where are where where where are you where are you all where are you where yall he he didn't that's the way you say it right no but he identifyed you said well he could have been talking to both of them no because the male Adam answered first so he knew who God was talking to [Music] Hallelujah you understand me so he Adam was responsible for keeping eve even his wife that's right in order that's the Bible the Bible said if a man can't rule with his own house he's not even Rich to Ru the church y'all don't get quiet that's the order Hallelujah you love God okay Genesis where was that Genesis one I lost my place God is good to us anyhow oh yeah here it is and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now there's nothing uncovered God covered the sea he covered the land he covered the air All Creatures was under the Dominion of Adam everything so you must understand what a Christian is is a Christian is a woman or a man that God is building into the perfect stature of Christ so that this particular scripture Hallelujah will be manifested in the sons of God y'all believe that it's the truth now periodically God would do little things Hallelujah like Elijah he was able to call down fire from heaven Hallelujah like Enoch who was translated little little bits and pieces like Moses Hallelujah that spoke to the to the Red Sea and the Sea y'all hear what I'm saying it's like when when when he struck to walk spoke to the Rock and hey The Rock gave water y understand me that wasn't a man that was God in the man you see what I'm saying God was giving us a little piece at a time of what we were maturing into Hallelujah and think about it they were just the shadow of what we ought to be come on somebody and if the shadow had such an authority what about the we got to elevate our mind we got to let go let God take control that's why the Bible said let this mind be in you hallelujah what mind the Mind who that thought it not robber it to Beal with God but he made himself of no reputation see that's why when you see these people say I'm a prophet see that ain't God real prophets don't want to even be known a real true Christian when somebody heal is get heal you you don't want oh I'mma tell you how it happened I slap my hand on that forehead and they were healed oh they weren't healed because you slapped their forehead the only way a man or woman is healed fa in the word God hallelujah it ain't what you do it's what he does there's no such thing as a Divine healer the only one I know of is God himself Hallelujah yes Lord have mercy you know tell you one thing Adam knew who he was cuz when he messed up he tried to hide as great as he was in the garden he knew that the great one is now come which was God himself y'all hear what I'm saying oh Lord help us Jesus so let's move on so God created man in his IM own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them Hallelujah so we know we are in the image of God hands like a monkey feet like bear yall know y'all know the whole thing amen we were made after the creation of God or the animals that in which we would be ruling Hallelujah because God not only wanted to be in contact with man but he also wanted to be in contact with his that's the truth people well they dumb animals what dumb animals God they never created a dumb animal every animal is intelligent maybe they have a certain level of it the only thing that makes us different from the animal we have souls Hallelujah you love the Lord see God always hold man responsible and charge of his house can't get away from that when man fell like I said he asked Adam where thou Hallelujah and he went to Adam first asked him what have you done you know what I'm saying and Adam says blaming God the woman you gave me and then the woman said that old Serpent and there something about people when the truth is preached to them they do not want to all own up to [Music] it Hallelujah I I mean they sin had given them away when God left them or when God didn't they were first naked and didn't know it the glory of God was around them the light of God covered them like a blanket Hallelujah they didn't know what sex was they didn't know what sin was they were pure in heart but then when he questioned Adam Adam said I hear because I was naked and God did not say what made you naked he said who who had to be a person what could have been anything who told you you were naked Hallelujah that same old serpent that used to walk up on two feet that in tell ENT being Hallelujah that lied to e s don't that can't be true people say it was a snake that's that Theological Seminary lie he was a beast he's a beast in Genesis and in Revelation he's a beast and the Beast in Revelation is a man and the serpents in in in the Book of Matthew [Music] a that's right Hallelujah is that right right that's what John said John called him a generation of serpents a Generation of Vipers what do you mean in your poit devil orain to lead people to hell that's why the Bible says search the scriptures for them you find eternal life Hallelujah glory to God but one thing I want to say about this God knows them that are his In His Image Enlighten is created him and they broke the order let me tell you something what we see here this is not the kingdom of God we even come to church but the kingdom of God is within you it ain't in this chair or even in this building Hallelujah in persons Hallelujah is that right and we all come together to worship God as Savior and deliverer Hallelujah like I said what we see here is not the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within you it is joy peace and righteousness in the Holy Ghost and it is a spiritual Kingdom Hallelujah you can't see it but it can be manifested hallah you can't see the wind but the wind can be manifested when you see the trees leaves blowing and moving you don't see the wind but you see the effects of the Wind the Bible says the Holy Ghost is like a wind you don't know from when it came you don't know which it's going but in its travel there's a manifestation of that wind Hallelujah that's why people can't understand Christians a friend of mine was talking to me today and he said that you know he like to wear those Jesus shirts I wear them every now and again or have worn them every now and again with something on it with Jesus on it you know you got Christians that are frown at that Hallelujah ain't nothing wrong with it and if you want to you know you wear a baseball cap with everything else on it you got a team over here and a team over there and some of us wear these shoes with a Nike symbol on it so much stuff there's nothing wrong with it but I find that most Christians are ashamed to wear Church like that Hallelujah listen don't make that a Doctrine now I'm just saying that's your preference on what you want to do but the man was telling him that why you believe in that Jesus he he knows some scripture too he's a he's a he's a a devil that's what he is this man this man this man is a devil he goes to the scriptures and pervert it and he tells this man you a sinner read this look at your clothes you got this material you got that material and you going to go to hell and the man said he he's not a Believer I told my friend he's a liar for sure he is a Believer if he wasn't a Believer you wouldn't be making him angry amen why is he angry if he don't believe what what he sees here he don't want to see a real Christian and that's all the other Christians don't do this we're not other Christians we're real Christians Hallelujah we behave in a certain way we're not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it is a power of God unto salvation hallelujah we're OD balls that's the way it is then y'all go too far oh no I haven't gone far enough Hallelujah when I'm standing in heaven behind the Gates Hallelujah then tell me I've gone too far Hallelujah yes sir we have a king president our lives are ruled by the Holy Ghost the law of this kingdom is based on the Bible the law of the kingdom is love he leads us and guides us he is the one that we must submit to Hallelujah we are so Jour you understand me if there is true aliens you are ones because you came from a different place you came from God and you go back to God hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and so our nature is the nature of the city from which we came we are in the world not of the world you understand me we're not have the nature of this world we were born with this nature of the world this is why Jesus told Nicodemus all your religion your Pharisee you're on the top in the top class of the religion but that's not good enough accept your righteousness EX the righteousness of the Pharisees he said you will not enter in what does he mean by that the righteousness of the Pharisee was self-righteousness don't do this don't do that don't do this you can't do that but when you're born again you don't want to do this you don't want to do that your nature Chang Hallelujah that's how you uh you you you you approach God by Grace love and not law hallelujah our nature is from above is that right you said well I prove that the Bible said the New Jerusalem descended out of heaven with the glory of God hallelujah let me move on you love the Lord come from the message invisible Union Hallelujah paragraph 207 is this okay okay this is just a startup our natural life here we have is just a perversion you know there are people in there are people who think they're not perverted everything born of a woman is perverted you know oh you could oh he's a pervert you are to everything in this world is perverted you come out speaking Lies You Steal You Lie you cheat you ever seen you ever seen a child they take somebody some other kids toy and then say it's mine and the Mama comes oh no it ain't he said no it's my he figured that he going to throw a f his mom is going to able to no no no no it don't work that way so they lie and you don't have to teach them selfishness come with the package Hallelujah and that's not of God that is a perverted attribute God so love the world that he his only begotten son y'all hear what I'm saying so if you're selfish you need to be be delivered couldn't proba get that one out but I got it out Hallelujah see but it's perverted by the natural birth the first life of your first Union you will join in at a at Birth by Nature a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together associating together in a sexual Affair which which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death hallelujah how can you miss it seeing the serpent seed Hallelujah that which happened in the garden it's a reason why we're suffering now Hallelujah if we had only come through Adam the first Adam I don't know what it would have been like but one thing I'm going truly say we needed this Adam and Eve we don't know how long they were in the garden before the fall but no doubt Adam would look into that beautiful face and said oh I just love you Eve now her name weren't Eve it was Adam that must have sound funny but anyway and and he would she would turn around and said I love you too husband Adam but you know what you don't know what real love is until somebody cross your your beliefs let me put this way until somebody do something that's contrary to your Constitution when when Eve Sinn Adam felt how much he loved her and he was willing to die because he knew he could not live without her y hear what I'm saying so is it with the second Adam Jesus Christ he couldn't live without you is that the truth he said father in the 17th chapter of St John I would that they be with me I want them to be with me Hallelujah you love the Lord see we we we we must understand the order must be restored and I'm going to say it like this now everybody is not living in a a position or a way where they can restore order as the scripture says but those of us who both Partners in this message and love this word the order of the house must come into play yall hear what I'm saying before they could even make an exit D out of Egypt God told them get your house in order the order of the house is important because if the order of the house is right the order of the church will be right y'all hear what I'm saying now everybody can't do that but for those of us who can do that the order must be restored what are you saying the wife can't rule the [Music] husband God told Adam You Will Rule her now don't get me wrong we're not talking about making our wife some kind of door matad or something like that he must rule her by love is that the way God hallelujah he loves us and the Bible said when we recognize that love when we make mistakes it brings us to repentance the goodness of God is supposed to lead men to repentance hallelu yes sir it's not like I am the boss no and sisters if you're the boss you going you need to ask God to help you because you're out of order hello we talking about making a Rapture you got to submit yourself you say oh brother I ain't got to do that wait wait wait wait let me let me let me let me just go back to one scripture here Hebrews 13 I know what denominations used to do that they used to read the scripture and beat you over the head with a big big old piece of wood or something is this okay we going to preach it anyhow Hebrews 13 beginning at the 17th verse obey them that have rule over you and submit yourselves well I don't like when people tell me what to do don't let your boss at work hear you that say that for they watch for your souls as they must give an account we're talking about pastors now that they may do it with joy and not with grief but that is unprofitable for you why because don't you know your pastor will have to stand before God before you and he's going to have to give an account he's got to tell the truth about your behavior that's all I'm saying pray for us Paul says for We Trust we have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly that's that's it a true man of God want to have a good conscience and and he want to be honest Hallelujah and so if he's watching for your soul he's going to tell you the truth regardless to how it hurts and he's going to tell you the truth even when he knows you're not going to accept it that's good word hallelujah now let move on see it's just not it's just it works in the the regular house of a husband and wife and the authority also works in the church Hallelujah don't you even think that's how you'll know whether your nature is changed because when your nature is changed you're not ready to kill your brother amen is that right because when Cain and Abel when they were in you know at the altar and and God received Abel's sacrifice Cain got angry it shows the two Natures one nature was of Adam the other nature was of of the devil is that right Jude even said Jude I think that's Jude that even said that that that that that Cain was of that Wicked one Hallelujah So Adam wasn't the wicked one it was a serpent who was a wicked one and it was a serpent who was the father of Cain I know there's a lot to swall but it's true Hallelujah so what happened the fall brought us chaos instead of now having God ruling over everything Satan has repositioned himself and now he is the prince of the air he's the principalities he's the ruler of this world it's the devil the darkness that's why people now in this day is openly worshiping Satan because of the time we're living in now he feels like he's about ready ready to be en thron and he really will be enth y'all better hear what I'm saying but at the same time Satan is being enr the blood of Jesus Christ is to be enthroned Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying this is the battle started from the beginning but in order for this to work order must be restored oh just so much I can say in that but I can't Hallelujah let me read uh uh uh here in Isaiah 9 glory to God Isaiah 9 you love the Lord 9 and6 showing that Adam had to come me Jesus Christ had to come to restore is that right so what Isaiah 9 6-7 says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace now that is so powerful Hallelujah a born a child is born in the Book of Revelation it says Jesus Christ the the beginning of God's creation it was here in Mary's womb where God began to create a body for himself y'all hear what I'm saying it wasn't Jewish blood it wasn't Gentile blood it wasn't Joseph blood it wasn't Mary blood God created it was God's blood he created the the the the egg and he created the the ger life Hallelujah it wasn't a sexual Affair between God and and Mary it was a supernatural visitation Hallelujah he was born God amen amen he had a theophany Hallelujah and he had a name and he had a name Hallelujah he came in here as a ruler you said wait a minute brother books let me tell you something David was a king and he was a boy King and even when he was a boy he still was King yall understand me he still was a ruler was the king of Israel he was anointed king Hallelujah is that right because when Jesus was born that's what the angel song they sing songs about him being a king the three wise men King they we came to see the king he was baby but yet he was a king Hall you might be a baby in Christ you're still a king you're still a Hallelujah we only just begun I was thinking about that today I said oh my we can't imagine what eternity is going to be like Hallelujah no headaches no pain Hallelujah listen you say wait a minute wait a minute brother and then we would have never known that we come back to the Earth see because we got to come back because this Earth is ours Hallelujah and and that's why we'll be transplanted transplanted from that Dimension to this Dimension we won't come back as babies no more we'll come all the redeemed we come back riding on horses Hallelujah with Jesus in the front Hallelujah however he interprets that we come back to earth to possess the Earth and guess what to rule it we come to rule Earth thousand years and that's just the beginning Hallelujah after that eternity finally sets in God destroy Satan and all of his Devils hear what I'm saying all the germs everything that he got this well what we done away with Hallelujah no more cloudy skies I remember somebody saying I told her I was up in Canada I said won't be no snow the sister got upset I love snow I say snow is a perversion Hallelujah that came from the foul glory to God won't be nobody getting Frost bit up there freezing to death no won't be anything like that Hallelujah let me go on I'm almost there just part cuz I'm going have to cut it off you love the Lord the seven it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder that is the strength of a man his shoulder y understand me that's why the Levites had to carry the Ark of the Covenant upon their shoulders it's the strength of the man and the shoulder covers the heart Hallelujah of the Lord let's move on and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace see you crazy to the world y'all believe this to believe it's got to be certain you know this can't be it is this all the life is this is all this is this all to life you're born a baby they come in and they smack you to make you cry you come in with pain and all your life you experiencing pain and disappointment all of that hallu this it there's got to be a better world sir there's got to be something better Hallelujah I believe [Music] that like I said when Jesus showed he was the Resurrection The the devil was surely upset then what devil didn't understand that Jesus said I am the resurrection he just didn't get it he didn't get it because he raised Lazarus from the dead I think the devil thought when Jesus died on Calvary he was going to hold him down in there in hell but hold him down in hell but Jesus was on a mission Hallelujah is that right he was on a mission Hallelujah he went to hell for me Hallelujah y'all he the devil didn't even know it the devil didn't understand the scriptures is talks about he'll be bruised iniquities with the stripes we healed him and and the whole time those demons beating him they were beating him for me they were beating him for you Hallelujah when they pierc him in his hands they they did that from me because he was he was covering the whole body y'all hear me piercing both hands nailed in both feet Hallelujah said well I I don't have no feet trouble I don't have no leg trouble I don't have no hey but he didn't stop there they shove that sword in his side God didn't just take care of the outside he put the sword on the inside you got cancer of the LI cancer of the heart I don't care what kind of devil your body brother I got a tu in my head on his head heal you claim it he did it for you and he did it for me Hallelujah he covered the whole body even the heart those of you who have had broken hearts historian said he died from a broken heart now if he died from a broken heart that means your heart can be fixed Hallelujah yes sir listen let's move on of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end and upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to the order to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will this Hallelujah so you must understand God want the world to know he's alive and well hallelujah amen when he heals you he wants you to tell it when he delivers you he wants you to tell it come on if it's a real event you be able to keep your mouth shut anyhow is that right cuz he hear those people in the in the in the gospel say don't go tell nobody it was like telling them go tell it they went and they told it you love the Lord I'm almost done with this portion because of their transgression the order of procreation was broken and changed we were to be to be created by the spoken word you say that ain't true well where did those three three men where did they come from who went down to Abraham they all of a sudden appeared where did they come from God spoke it yall understand me and at his word everything must come to pass Hallelujah am you understand me so we look at these things and we we fail to see when God speaks a word little becomes much a few fish of loaves few fish and five loaves of bread fed 5,000 one time or 3,000 One Time come on a little boy's lunch when God speaks he's the Creator Hallelujah and then he gives that ability and a power to his own children is that right Elijah said it will not rain till I call for it God gave him that Authority and God giving his children he's restoring back Hallelujah that that man and that woman that we supposed to be God wants to restore that I don't care how messed up you are your mind you could have you you could have G you could have been on all kind of drugs you could have been on crack and whatever else they got out there but God restores y'all hear what I'm saying God is rest he's a god of restoration y'all hear what I'm saying oh I can't remember the way I used to be God can restore you you get the Holy Ghost and God will restore everything has taken from you Hallelujah most of all and I'm going to close right here most of all he changed your nature that's that's the greatest thing Hallelujah you know I I I've told you before when I was in the world I used to drink but I don't I don't have a desire to drink anymore and when I'm around alcohol I don't get n nervous I got to get away from here because I might just uhuh I don't have that because there is nothing in me see the demon that had me drinking when God saved me he took it he had to go the strong man came in somebody help me here and right now I can drink real communion wine and never have to say oh I got to get me some more understand me cuz there is no demon in me that thirst for that so what I'm trying to say is when God changes your nature there is no demons in you I'm talking about your soul now there is nothing in your soul is the ruler everything else in that spirit world must die but I I found out by listening to a message the other day the only way you can get the true Holy Spirit you got to earnestly judge [Music] yourself you got to judge yourself you got to come before God and tell God exactly the way it is and you got to let him know You' been a rank cner and you worthy of hell and then once you judge yourself and God sees that your your judgment is accurate he will then judge you and send the holy Ghost and Fire that's how the Holy Ghost comes after you have judged yourself no Hiding Place don't even don't even dare try to hide you got something in you that you don't want to tell God he'll leave you right there until you ready to give it up I mean give it up you can say Lord I don't know how to give it up but help me Lord he knows the earnest of your heart and he sees the earnest of your heart in that Holy Ghost in fire it sanctify you it'll take all desire from you Hallelujah yes it's the truth I used to be a dancer out there I mean a r i mean in my day now I me in my day I can't do what they doing now in my day I used to dance and I loved it I would dance by myself y'all see that's the way I used to I used to carry on and and and when I got saved they told me I got to give it up what what I can't say now you got to change the way you dance you got to dance for Jesus no I'm not I'm telling y'all the truth I had to I had to have God help y'all y'all y'all know I look at my grandkids I say uhuh no no no wrong wrong one wrong cuz it's the beat in me I I passed it on so I look at my children especially those that are not saving serving the lord I said Lord be merciful because you know what I see I see me it doesn't fall too far from the tree y'all think y'all don't y'all think see let me tell y'all something I'm almost done I'm just almost done so but you need to know this when you get married and you have children you better preach to them the Holy Ghost you better teach them that they need a change of nature CU when they get of age and that nature hasn't changed guess what they going to resurrect you and your wife and a few cousins in all that come through there I know what I'm talking about I see some of my daughters say that's my sister the things they do I see it but it's because they need to be born again that that that that first seed is corruptible we need an Incorruptible SE to take y'all hear what I'm saying oh my goodness it's it just it amazes me that's why we've got to teach these kids the order the order one thing I love about Israel teach their children they might know nothing but the law but those little kids know now it's they they ain't born again either and and when I went to Israel I thought I was going to see all them holy folks he he a rabbi coming down all in his Gars I was in shock cuz I thought when I went there I was I was going to see the Orthodox Jew Orthodox and here this guy was a Orthodox Jew an je Orthodox and he was drun they must be born again I don't care how much law you got that law is only there to break it you love the Lord let's stand let's stand this is just part one by the grace of God I've got a lot of things I'd like to say I didn't even get into but by God's grace I don't claim to be nobody deep I just want to feed the people of God make us aware that we are at a time the death Angels is in the land don't be foolish don't be foolish he said when I see the blood I pass over you that means the Life of Christ must be in you otherwise the death Angels going to get you and I'm not talking about natural death I'm talking about spiritual death which is worse than the natural like that young man basically blashe in the Holy Ghost I don't believe this and you shouldn't do that the the the one brother said well what am I supposed to do I said love him I said that's all you can do is love him show him Christ even if he don't want to see it prent God might open his eyes love him as much as you can love him yes sir you know God give us enemies sometime to perfect us Hallelujah and let me tell you something in closing if it wasn't for the battles and the scars that you you have obtained in the battles you would not be the Christian that you are today hello am you wouldn't you you you you've learned to trust God you've learned to depend on him you learned to lean on him Hallelujah through these battles and tests that you've gone through it's maturing you in ways that you can't even see but he that begun the good work in you he is faithful to
