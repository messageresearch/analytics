[16:08] do our last little episode preparing for
[16:13] a new world and by God's grace we'll
[16:16] move on by the leadership of the Holy
[16:19] Spirit I believe we're living in the
[16:23] last days and it's always important to
[16:25] keep in mind why we're here
[16:28] amen and what we're here for so I
[16:32] appreciate the Lord for being so good to
[16:34] us as we stand let us turn to Hebrews 11
[16:39] and 7 I appreciate all that is done here
[16:46] by God's grace by everybody and their
[16:48] participants anticipating and trying to
[16:51] make the service a successful one we
[16:53] thank God for you
[16:54] we appreciate the Living God I realize
[16:58] that we're living in the last days and
[17:03] we we know that the most important thing
[17:08] that we can do is keep eyes on Jesus
[17:11] Satan is uh is a cruel adversary and
[17:15] he's gonna do whatever he can do to
[17:17] throw us off paths but by God's grace
[17:21] you know if we just continue to love one
[17:24] another and continue to love God brother
[17:31] Brennan they were asked he was asked a
[17:32] question how how to to to make sure I
[17:35] make a rapture and he says read the
[17:37] Bible every day and pray that's as
[17:40] simple as it can get he didn't say you
[17:42] had to belong to this church of that
[17:43] church but if your true believer you
[17:47] read your Bible every day and pray do
[17:51] your best thing doing that anyway
[17:52] keeping God on your mind and in your
[17:56] hearts at all
[17:57] I want to make sure I think it's the
[18:01] January the 19th that weekend we'll be
[18:04] having our brother Andrew Glover come so
[18:07] those of you who know brother Andrew
[18:09] Glover we put it in in stone today if
[18:13] the Lord said Terry will have Andrew
[18:16] Glover here doing that weekend I'll give
[18:19] you further details what we're going to
[18:21] be doing as that day approached by God's
[18:24] grace as far as I know of we don't have
[18:30] any other guest speakers coming by God's
[18:34] grace and I'm gonna make this
[18:36] announcement even Sunday to make sure
[18:39] that people do not invite creatures to
[18:41] preach here if somebody want to come
[18:47] let them come by way of me they can come
[18:50] by way of the internet or whatever
[18:52] because I have all kinds of calls I've
[18:55] got a lot of people calling me people
[18:57] out don't even know you know not long
[19:00] ago we tried to discourage a brother for
[19:03] coming and he came anyway
[19:04] and but anyway some time that's
[19:08] misunderstood and so we're not trying to
[19:11] hurt anybody's feelings or anything like
[19:13] that but if somebody ever gets a notion
[19:16] I know there are those who are not
[19:18] internet who's listening to me so please
[19:22] don't invite anybody without talking to
[19:26] me first
[19:28] because even when it comes to businesses
[19:32] they like to have a background check so
[19:37] that you can understand all brethren are
[19:39] not brethren and we won't mean full of
[19:44] the Holy Ghost you know if you come and
[19:46] preach it come and he's full of the Holy
[19:50] Ghost he won't get an attitude about the
[19:54] way things he thought things may or
[19:57] should have gone so anyway we won't Holy
[20:00] Ghost feel preachers if they in the
[20:04] Lord's will you love the Lord Hebrews
[20:07] 11:7 we're not going to
[20:09] be long tonight it says in the in the
[20:13] King James Version I'm gonna read the
[20:15] amplifier a version - I don't normally
[20:18] read those but it's really nice I like
[20:22] it I like the way it brings things out
[20:24] it kind of helps me get started with the
[20:27] message tonight and it reads by faith
[20:30] being warned of God of things that not
[20:34] seen as yet move with fear prepared an
[20:38] ark to the saving of his house by the
[20:41] which he condemned the world and became
[20:45] heir of the righteousness which is by
[20:48] faith according to the amplified version
[20:54] it says prompted by faith nor being
[20:58] forewarned by God concerning events of
[21:02] which as yet there was no visible sign
[21:06] took heed and diligently and reverently
[21:09] constructed and prepared an ark for the
[21:12] deliverance of his own family by this
[21:15] his faith which relied on God he passed
[21:19] judgment and sentence on the world's
[21:22] unbelieving when he came an air and
[21:24] possessor of righteousness that relation
[21:27] of being right in to which God put the
[21:31] person who has faith let us pray Lord
[21:38] Jesus we thank you for your grace and
[21:39] your mercy we thank you for being so
[21:42] good to us father we pray that you would
[21:45] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[21:47] let your perfect will be done tonight as
[21:50] we submit ourselves to you Lord Jesus
[21:53] let your word be spoken give us God and
[21:58] give us grace to move completely out of
[21:59] your way that your perfect will will be
[22:02] done tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[22:04] pray amen
[22:06] you may be seated
[22:10] one thing I want to say by God's grace
[22:13] and I know that all of us are aware and
[22:15] we know that God is infinite he cannot
[22:22] lie God speaks anything contrary knows
[22:28] everything right in other words God
[22:30] cannot speak anything contrary and he
[22:34] knows everything just as perfect as the
[22:38] beginning as he is at the ending I'm
[22:41] just giving you a little thought on
[22:43] these things because I was thinking the
[22:47] other day how powerful this book is and
[22:52] you can burn it you can tear it up but
[22:57] it still exists this book is only
[23:01] written in this dimension but the Bible
[23:04] tells us that God's Word is written in
[23:07] heaven so before it came here so that we
[23:12] can see it and comprehend it now
[23:15] understand this this is just a small
[23:18] portion of God this is God redemption
[23:23] plan we don't know what entails us out
[23:28] the redemption is over because remember
[23:31] when Jesus was here the Bible said if
[23:34] they had put in all the miracles that
[23:37] Jesus had done while he was on earth if
[23:40] they had written it in scrolls there
[23:43] wouldn't have been no place to write at
[23:46] all
[23:46] so you got to understand that God didn't
[23:49] tell us everything here there are so
[23:52] many things that even in our lives that
[23:55] takes place miracles and things that
[23:57] nature
[23:58] that there is no book not here but we
[24:03] realized that everything is kept in
[24:05] record in heaven you understand me
[24:08] so what I'm trying to say is he's
[24:10] infinite and a lot of times people don't
[24:13] understand God because they said God
[24:15] created everything well God is perfect
[24:20] all right God is holy
[24:23] so what isn't that evil come by way of
[24:26] God no evil came by way of Lucifer and
[24:31] because God is everywhere understand
[24:35] everywhere by being omniscient that
[24:38] means because he knows everything he
[24:42] knows everything so that places him
[24:44] everywhere is that right I mean God
[24:49] knows everything now he did not create
[24:54] sin in the way we think he did but he
[24:58] allows sin to come by way of Lucifer now
[25:01] you said what do you mean did God know
[25:03] yes he knew but God gives us free moral
[25:07] agency right you can choose good and you
[25:11] can choose evil just as Lucifer did we
[25:15] call him the devil now he's Satan right
[25:17] but everything that was not created in
[25:21] God's perfect will and plan will be done
[25:24] away with all evil and all evil things
[25:28] and everything that comes by evil which
[25:30] is by the way a perversion comes from
[25:33] Satan it is a revelation God is not
[25:38] understood by science and God is not in
[25:41] understood by intellect God comes by
[25:44] revelation when God begins to reveal
[25:47] himself to you that's where God comes
[25:50] from that's how we understand God right
[25:53] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[25:56] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[25:58] against it that means by revelation as
[26:01] God reveals himself that's why he's real
[26:04] to some and not real to others because
[26:07] some cannot see him because they're
[26:10] trying to intellectually can't conceive
[26:12] him but God is not and he cannot be
[26:15] intellectually conceived he is given his
[26:20] revelation to his own is that right
[26:22] Eluga so you said what what do you mean
[26:25] brother brother brother Brooks I mean if
[26:27] you read this Bible in an intellectual
[26:29] way you'll find a lot of things that
[26:32] seem to be so contradictory like in
[26:35] Genesis when God made
[26:37] man right but they don't understand he
[26:40] didn't make man twice he made man once
[26:42] and he formed the second man out of the
[26:45] dust of the earth which became part of
[26:47] the first man so they went to me and
[26:51] they were one man one man a men stood
[26:53] there in at the often II which we call a
[26:55] word body and the other man was formed
[26:58] the dust was formed shaped around him so
[27:02] what do you mean brother Brooks I'm
[27:03] trying to tell you that God is a man
[27:08] when it comes to his form he is shaped
[27:11] like a man he is a man greater than a
[27:16] man is that right because even in his
[27:19] day I'm coming in just a minute they
[27:22] said to Jesus they accused him say you
[27:23] are a man trying to make yourself God
[27:26] but they had a reverse he was God who
[27:29] was making himself a man just like God
[27:32] is doing now God is making himself a man
[27:37] so let me move on by God's grace God is
[27:40] endless right for example a circle now
[27:46] this is in my notes I'm going somewhere
[27:48] with this uh you know there's no
[27:52] beginning and there's no ending or you
[27:55] can use this infinity sign there is no
[27:58] stopping place
[27:59] I like the infinity sign because right
[28:01] in the middle of the Infinity you see a
[28:03] cross which connects two circles the
[28:06] Alpha and the Omega so when we look and
[28:09] you say well brother what are you trying
[28:10] to say I'm trying to say that we are
[28:13] creatures not of this world right in a
[28:18] man comes from another world come from
[28:21] another dimension come from another
[28:23] place now this might sound quite strange
[28:26] because we know how Hollywood always tap
[28:29] into things and you know about another
[28:31] dimension in another world well that's
[28:35] how the devil is I mean you know he he
[28:37] he taps into things I mean that's what
[28:40] Einstein did remember I told you the
[28:42] last time I preached Einstein says
[28:44] according to relativity you know and the
[28:48] quantum theory that too
[28:51] can exist in the same different places
[28:54] at the same time in other words I can be
[28:57] here on earth and be in heaven too even
[28:59] Jesus said that he said how can a man
[29:02] stand how can the Son of Man be here on
[29:04] earth and be in heaven at the same time
[29:07] if you know you said what what do you
[29:10] mean if I astound understood there was a
[29:13] word body there's another part of you
[29:15] that lives somewhere else hallelujah and
[29:18] we call that the word body we call that
[29:21] that theophany you and I would have been
[29:24] birthed into that had not Adam and Eve
[29:27] sinned because Adam and Eve sinned we
[29:30] bypass out the apne and we began to live
[29:33] like animals we are not animals we were
[29:38] created animals we were created in the
[29:41] form and likeness only because God
[29:44] wanted Adam which was the spiritual man
[29:46] to be able to be in contact with the
[29:49] natural is that right I'm saying all of
[29:52] these things to understand understand
[29:55] that we are preparing to go back to the
[29:58] creature that God intended us to be
[30:02] that's why we do what we do well this is
[30:06] not our home that's why we have a deep
[30:09] call if there's something that tells us
[30:12] there's a better place there's a better
[30:14] home there's something out there I can't
[30:17] put my finger on it
[30:18] but it's I know that I'm not supposed to
[30:21] live this long every man has in him
[30:24] every true Son of God has in them that
[30:28] desire to be greater and if there is a
[30:31] desire for you to be greater or closer
[30:34] to God hallelujah that is what we call
[30:37] the law of God a deep call to the deep
[30:40] yeah man and there's a deed to respond
[30:43] that means there is coming a responding
[30:46] from God because God declared I've never
[30:51] lost one is that right knowing that God
[30:56] put a seed in us I'm coming this way
[30:59] because remember Noah to pay
[31:04] there was a message that came from God
[31:07] right and that message was is going to
[31:11] rain and Noor started preparing that Ark
[31:16] according to the blueprint in which God
[31:19] had given him the Titanic couldn't
[31:22] defeat it can't compare no ship or ocean
[31:28] liner can't compare to what Noah built
[31:31] Wow because Noah built an ark that was
[31:35] perfect right
[31:37] understand Noah's Ark had three levels
[31:40] just just like the three the levels that
[31:43] we must come through in order to be
[31:45] completely safe
[31:46] you must be justified you must be
[31:49] sanctified and you must have the Holy
[31:51] Ghost is that right and remember that
[31:54] Noah's Ark had only one door that means
[31:57] there was only one way to be saved
[31:59] hallelujah you couldn't come to a back
[32:02] door cuz the back door didn't exist
[32:04] hallelujah you had to come through the
[32:07] door which was a type of Christ Jesus
[32:09] said Christ says I am the door I am the
[32:13] way I am the truth I am the life is that
[32:17] right
[32:17] even Jesus said no man can come unto the
[32:20] Father except by me in other words
[32:22] you've got to come through Jesus Christ
[32:24] you love the Lord
[32:26] so you said what are you saying because
[32:29] God had of people that believed that
[32:33] supposing in we're gonna say this and
[32:35] we're going to move on that's supposing
[32:38] there was 8 or 8 so 8 million people in
[32:41] the world that means one out of a
[32:43] million people were saved now you got to
[32:48] understand because God understands
[32:50] everything God saw that only eight souls
[32:53] was gonna say be saved
[32:54] baby no ahead of megachurch he had to be
[32:58] had to been because remember now the
[33:01] earth that that day was not divided
[33:03] there was not an American America there
[33:07] was not a Europe all land was of one
[33:11] mass you find out that after the flood
[33:14] there came a Continental Divide that's
[33:18] when the continents began to drift
[33:20] that's how come you have different
[33:22] people on different parts right and
[33:25] understand this was done after the
[33:29] confusion god order only separated their
[33:32] language but he separated the continents
[33:36] hallelujah so therefore Amen if you if
[33:39] you they always say trace it all the way
[33:41] down I don't care what bloodline there
[33:43] is there's only one blood that came from
[33:47] Adam and Eve and every race on the face
[33:50] of the earth can be traced back to Adam
[33:52] and Eve y'all get me so what are you
[33:56] saying by the books I'm saying those who
[33:58] were truly the sealing sons of God
[34:01] because Adam never produced Amen sons of
[34:05] God after the fall Adam had sons of Adam
[34:09] right because the sons of God were
[34:11] supposed to be made in the image and
[34:13] likeness of God
[34:14] and I'm just recapping everything so
[34:18] that you can understand that's why when
[34:20] women have babies they the babies drop
[34:22] that way that's a sign of the fall right
[34:26] because men we're supposed to be upright
[34:28] Adam was created upright right and as I
[34:32] said by God's grace you got to realize
[34:34] also that in Adam was not created a baby
[34:38] babies only came by the fall so beyond
[34:42] the curtain of time you're not gonna
[34:44] find babies I don't care how many times
[34:47] people say in the news oh my god and
[34:50] they were children and they were babies
[34:51] over there they're lying
[34:53] there are no babies beyond the curtain
[34:55] of time because because behind the
[34:57] curtain of time you come back to the
[35:00] original state that you were supposed to
[35:02] be in before you came here and when you
[35:05] come here when the way we were supposed
[35:08] to come was supposed to be by spoken
[35:10] word and the world would be spoken like
[35:13] it was when God says let us make man
[35:15] right it was a spoken word that produced
[35:19] Adam and Eve and as you said as I said
[35:22] before amen you must understand this is
[35:25] why you have these ten toes it shows
[35:27] that we are trees right and these are
[35:30] the stubs are the roots
[35:32] right God uprooted us and we began to
[35:35] walk right right so you got to
[35:38] understand that over there you will not
[35:40] have any shoes because you won't need
[35:45] any shoes shoes were given to us to
[35:47] protect us from the thorns and the
[35:49] thistles won't be no thorns and thistles
[35:51] over there hallelujah so you say what do
[35:54] you mean brother Brooks you and I we
[35:57] won't have to worry about fashion shows
[35:59] or anything like that
[36:00] there'll be no competition a man
[36:03] everybody will be who they are and what
[36:06] they are you understand me
[36:08] but everybody won't be the same you
[36:10] don't know that there'll be levels
[36:14] levels of success crowns rewards right
[36:21] we won't all wear the same uniform some
[36:25] of us will have if I could say like this
[36:27] put in a natural way some will have more
[36:29] stripes on their uniform than others
[36:32] right showing what you did in this day
[36:36] right like that like the song say no
[36:39] cross no crown and you and I must
[36:41] understand won't be in a jealousy won't
[36:45] be in the competition you see because
[36:47] all of that came by way of Lucifer
[36:49] that's why in his kingdom to this day
[36:52] you have a lot of strife you have
[36:54] competition you have world at kingdoms
[36:56] fighting one another because that was
[36:59] the way it was after the beginning when
[37:02] Lucifer fell to the is that right that's
[37:06] the truth and even as that thought was
[37:08] brought to us which I loved that thought
[37:10] that when Lucifer the one thing that
[37:13] Lucifer I'm sorry
[37:14] the one thing that Adam needed to do
[37:16] Adam needed to conquer the devil right
[37:21] cuz Adam was just like God he was a
[37:24] little God right I'm Tamar we preparing
[37:27] now but this information is important
[37:30] because you got to understand when God
[37:32] open the seals according to the private
[37:35] of God we went back to the position in
[37:38] that day before Adam fail that means all
[37:42] the authority that God gave Adam in that
[37:45] David
[37:45] the fall has now been given to the
[37:48] believer now I say believer but you got
[37:51] to understand that full power and
[37:54] authority only comes to those sons and
[37:57] daughters who are adopted right it
[38:00] doesn't he God don't give that to
[38:02] anybody he give to that person who have
[38:04] come into a full maturity of Christ
[38:10] that's the way it goes
[38:12] so because God can't just give a child
[38:14] anything God looking for mature
[38:16] Christians so that when that time and
[38:19] comes to us Amen well where the word is
[38:22] needed to be spoken we will not speak it
[38:25] until we get a dust settle or we won't
[38:27] move until we get a dust at the Lord see
[38:30] it'll be a time when Lucifer will
[38:33] scratch his head the devil was scratched
[38:35] he's because he won't know what to do
[38:38] with you he won't be able to tempt you
[38:41] break you been you or shake you he will
[38:44] be so confused because you see he wasn't
[38:47] expecting God to reproduce oh he wasn't
[38:53] expected it but if he had always seen
[38:56] what God spoke to Adam he would have
[38:58] known right and God told Adam a mentor
[39:02] about to be fruitful and multiply and as
[39:06] I said before Adam really never did it
[39:08] because after the fall Adam never
[39:10] produced sons and daughters of God he
[39:12] produce hybrids because the sex act
[39:17] brings hybrids hallelujah that's why
[39:21] when we get over there there'll be no
[39:22] more sex hallelujah you have a male body
[39:25] and you have a female body but they're
[39:27] not be anymore reproducing all of God's
[39:31] children will be produced
[39:33] you said you mean killing already there
[39:35] you mean to tell me like the brother
[39:36] said you and I go all of us gonna be on
[39:39] earth that's not what God said see what
[39:41] we don't understand that when God this
[39:44] is just a beginning
[39:45] this was the seed chapter of God
[39:48] exploration if you want to say like that
[39:51] there's world on top of world moves on
[39:55] top of moons planet on top of planet
[39:57] universes own and God is not a
[39:59] for God hallelujah God told us he said
[40:04] listen if you are faithful into little
[40:06] in his world I will make you a ruler of
[40:09] 10 cities think if there was a million
[40:12] people they men who was faithful how
[40:14] many how can 10 cities hello and God
[40:17] don't make little cities hallelujah
[40:21] The Jerusalem is how big it is one city
[40:24] look how big that is that covers half of
[40:28] the United States one city
[40:30] coast-to-coast you know you think about
[40:33] it so I'm saying all of these things ten
[40:36] of those but remember in the world to
[40:39] come there now there won't be no ocean
[40:42] all the land that's going down will now
[40:46] come up right no water other than the
[40:52] life the stream of life the river life
[40:55] that's right the river life that flows
[40:57] beneath the City of God and the throne
[40:59] of God
[41:00] mmm normal ocean so they're going to be
[41:03] laying everywhere hallelujah now how
[41:06] long we gonna all stay here at one time
[41:09] only God knows it's his business
[41:12] but God's intention is not for all of us
[41:14] to stay here so what do you say brother
[41:17] but so you can understand the purpose
[41:18] for which we are here God doesn't give
[41:20] you the spoken word without giving you a
[41:23] work to do
[41:24] is that right he told Adam I'm giving
[41:28] you the word I want you to speak like I
[41:31] spoke I want you to do this and Adam had
[41:34] the ability to say tree B he pluck up
[41:37] move over here when stopped and the wind
[41:39] had to stop right you said what do you
[41:41] mean
[41:42] because Jesus Christ was the second Adam
[41:44] hallelujah was it not true that Jesus
[41:47] stopped the winds and the waves is it
[41:49] was is it not true that Jesus walked on
[41:51] the water is it not true that he turned
[41:54] water into wine
[41:55] hallelujah is it not true he fed 5,000
[41:59] with a few fish and loaves that's the
[42:02] kind of Adam we supposed to be because
[42:05] the Bible said that in him was the life
[42:08] of man or the light of men in other
[42:12] words in
[42:12] Jesus Christ we saw the revelation of
[42:15] what a real man is supposed to be like
[42:18] the first Adam we didn't see that but in
[42:21] the second Adam which was Jesus Christ
[42:23] himself he was a quickening spirit which
[42:26] was what Adam was before he was formed
[42:30] right and he was Jesus Christ in a body
[42:33] that was laid by God blood cell and
[42:36] everything was made by God none of that
[42:39] was Mary's gene and none of it was
[42:41] Joseph's gene Mary was the first
[42:43] incubator that ever hit the earth
[42:45] hallelujah she only carried Jesus and
[42:48] that's why he never called her mother
[42:50] he called her woman right if he had
[42:54] called her mother he would have been off
[42:56] the word a body thou have prepared for
[42:59] me right that was the Word of God
[43:02] so you said why are you saying that
[43:04] because we must understand that when
[43:06] Jesus Christ came he was the first of
[43:09] his creation he was God
[43:13] right he was the first of his kind
[43:16] according to revelation right he was the
[43:19] beginning of the creation of God
[43:22] somebody help me here so you got to
[43:25] understand now we're preparing to go to
[43:28] a place where only God's will live
[43:33] hallelujah and they will all bear the
[43:36] name of Jesus Christ now the Bible tells
[43:40] us he will receive a new name whenever
[43:43] that new name is we will be the same
[43:46] thing so you so what are you saying
[43:48] brother that is why let's say it like
[43:51] this the character of the thing is what
[43:54] makes the thing the character of a thing
[43:59] is what makes a thing right for example
[44:04] if you saw a cat and that cat had the
[44:08] nature of a dog that cat is no longer a
[44:13] cat it will no longer meow
[44:16] you know what it will do it will bark
[44:18] that cat will no longer be afraid of
[44:21] water
[44:22] that cat will run to the water because
[44:25] it has
[44:26] nature of a dog right so is it with the
[44:31] son and daughter of God though we be
[44:33] born in sin shapen in iniquity coming to
[44:37] this world speaking lies but once you
[44:39] are born of God the nature of God enters
[44:43] into you and you're no longer a sinner
[44:46] you become a son and daughter of God
[44:49] that's where the expression comes from
[44:52] son and daughter of God if I were a dog
[44:55] I produced dog if I'm a cat I produced
[44:57] cat if I'm a car produce car and if I'm
[45:00] on God I produce cars that's hard for
[45:03] people to understand but it is because
[45:05] we are of a fallen nature that's why
[45:08] this world is not ours
[45:11] there's two worlds that we working with
[45:13] and I spoke last week two worlds that we
[45:16] are working with that's the underworld
[45:19] and the upper world one is heaven the
[45:22] other one is Hell Judas came from where
[45:25] the underworld the Bible called him the
[45:28] son of perdition that means he came from
[45:30] hell and he went back to him if you come
[45:32] from God you go back to God that's why
[45:35] many people feel the influence of the
[45:37] upper world which is God they eventually
[45:40] get saved those who feel that pull down
[45:43] into hell that no matter what they see
[45:45] they didn't come from heaven so they
[45:47] can't go there
[45:48] you gotta come from heaven in order to
[45:50] go back to heaven so they pull they pull
[45:53] Amen that the pool is from hell you said
[45:57] what do you mean brother Bruce because
[45:58] see they were once one church all the
[46:03] angels worship God in the in the age of
[46:05] Lucifer he was called the Morningstar
[46:09] he was God's right-hand man but when he
[46:13] rebelled even before he rebelled God
[46:17] said I have discerned that in your heart
[46:20] you said you setting up to rebelled
[46:23] against me now that's what he said I've
[46:26] discerned in your heart that you have
[46:28] said I will exalt myself and that's that
[46:32] that's one of the identifications of a
[46:35] child of Lucifer or a man who's not been
[46:38] born again because
[46:40] they have a tendency to exalt themselves
[46:43] hallelujah and they exalt themselves
[46:46] above the Word of God there was no other
[46:49] reasoning there was no other thought in
[46:52] heaven besides God stars Lucifer was the
[46:55] first original perverted thought and
[46:59] from that dissing God never stopped him
[47:03] because God had something he wanted to
[47:07] allow Lucifer to do you cannot listen
[47:10] what makes a painting it's the
[47:14] background of the pages it's all right
[47:18] it's the truth the cameras that is on is
[47:20] what makes the picture right you can't
[47:24] just put a picture up there
[47:25] with no background right it's what you
[47:29] do for an example let me put it this way
[47:33] what makes the black letters stand out
[47:40] though contrasts of a white page gotcha
[47:43] now you understand so God had to use the
[47:46] contrast in order to make himself seen
[47:51] because no man have seen God at any time
[47:54] but how would we know God had he not
[47:58] brought in a contrast is that right he
[48:01] would have never known how much Adam
[48:03] loved her until she fell then she
[48:06] realized Adam sacrificed his life for
[48:09] her that's when even recognize what real
[48:12] love was all about you don't know how
[48:15] much a person love you until you go
[48:17] wrong with them or they go wrong with
[48:19] you that's how much you know when you're
[48:21] willing to forgive our even even like
[48:23] Adam did risk your life right so you see
[48:28] this is what God did that's why Jesus
[48:30] Christ came he was the fullness of God
[48:35] it's such a great love affair he
[48:38] shouldered and Shannon type in Adam and
[48:40] Eve but that was just a shadow in a type
[48:43] he wanted to show his creation how much
[48:46] he loved them that he would be willing
[48:50] to die himself
[48:54] himself he came to die himself so that
[48:58] his creation his wife who we are could
[49:02] see how much right and not only did he
[49:05] allow this thing that happened but God
[49:08] being a just God has now come to undo
[49:11] everything that Lucifer did y'all see
[49:15] what I'm saying that's why the blood of
[49:17] Jesus Christ is so important the blood
[49:20] of Jesus Christ comes and he justifies
[49:22] and undo everything so nobody came
[49:24] playing God even when they didn't have
[49:27] the blood of Jesus Christ they had the
[49:29] blood of bulls and goats and all those
[49:30] things those things covered you see all
[49:34] he needed to do all God wanted even in
[49:37] that day was his creation not only
[49:39] people to believe that he was the
[49:41] creator because that's where Lucifer
[49:43] deceived the people he made the people
[49:45] think that he was God is that right oh
[49:48] yes exactly what it was how would they
[49:51] have known they should have moved but
[49:53] Lucifer was the covering cherub you
[49:58] understand he was a covering cherub like
[50:00] the bush that covered the fire
[50:02] he was the covering cherub like that
[50:05] like this laughs that covers the real
[50:07] light he blocked everything he was a
[50:10] glorious beauty of so when people looked
[50:13] for God they saw Lucifer is that right
[50:17] jesus said when you see me you see the
[50:19] father see that glory was once with him
[50:23] but he didn't want just that he wanted
[50:26] the real he wanted everything but he
[50:29] failed to see he was just a part of
[50:31] creation he was not God hallelujah and
[50:35] so does you say ll L Li L owe him is
[50:39] that right that's what we are come on
[50:43] yes when he is named before he was
[50:46] Elohim which means self existent one he
[50:48] wanted children
[50:49] he had offspring and his offspring comes
[50:53] under the name L Li Elohim see God has
[50:57] children Oh somebody help me here so you
[51:01] got to understand if God has children
[51:04] he came God is holy that's
[51:06] my god came accepters like this there
[51:08] had to be a blood sacrifice since blood
[51:11] was the thing that caused the fall blood
[51:13] is to Rimini to the fall hallelujah
[51:17] so Christ comes he shares his pure blood
[51:21] right but our inheritance comes by God
[51:27] not just the man the god of the man Oh
[51:31] hallelujah and you got to understand
[51:35] that's why the whole family in heaven
[51:36] and earth is named after him listen with
[51:40] the book of Revelation since now we know
[51:42] what these things and huh I said I've
[51:44] done a lot more capping than I meant to
[51:45] do but my point is we understand that's
[51:49] why the Bible says according to st. John
[51:50] 14 1 through 14 he says let not your
[51:53] heart be troubled ye believe in God
[51:56] believe also in me in my father's house
[52:00] are many mansions if it were not so I
[52:03] would have told you I go to prepare a
[52:06] place for you and like I said many a
[52:10] times when I was in my mother's womb
[52:12] that was a world to me for nine months I
[52:15] had no need of feet I had no needs of a
[52:18] mouth I had no needs of eyes I had no
[52:21] needs of ears none of that in that room
[52:23] why because my mother was my ear my
[52:26] mother was my mouse my mother was my
[52:27] feet my mother was everything I needed
[52:29] and everything I needed she gave it to
[52:31] me right but I was being formed for the
[52:35] world to come after nine months now I'm
[52:39] birth into this world
[52:41] I don't need mama no more from that
[52:44] angle right I need now my eyes to see my
[52:48] gnosis ma'am I either hear I need to
[52:50] feel and see this world for myself I
[52:52] need to make myself around I need to
[52:55] define myself around in this world I
[52:56] learned how to walk I learn how to talk
[52:58] I learned how to run I learned how to
[53:00] jump I learned how to work I learned all
[53:02] those things because the character was
[53:05] in me everything that mama had she gave
[53:08] it and daddy gave it so I have a
[53:10] combination of both of them working in
[53:12] me right it was my inheritance Oh
[53:14] somebody help me here so if that wasn't
[53:17] a natural it is also in the spirit
[53:21] everything that's in God is in me I have
[53:24] the ability you have the ability to do
[53:26] everything Jesus did is that right
[53:29] that's what he said
[53:30] in my name they're cast out Devils you
[53:33] won't be casting out Devils in heaven
[53:35] casting out Devils only in this
[53:37] dimension that right there be no
[53:41] miracles in heaven that's why you've got
[53:44] to be born again now the Holy Ghost must
[53:46] form and shape you and mature you
[53:48] because we are now in the womb of the
[53:51] earth but one of these old days that
[53:53] this womb of the earth is don't give
[53:55] birth to two sons and daughters of God
[53:58] because the Bible said that the whole
[54:00] heaven and earth groaneth and waits for
[54:05] the manifestations of the sons of God
[54:07] it's not just the sons of God
[54:10] manifestation they must see the same God
[54:14] that was in Jesus in you and me that's
[54:17] what they're waiting for
[54:19] not just one or two now they're waiting
[54:21] for the manifestation those genes that
[54:25] generation of Jesus Christ that is now
[54:28] growing and maturing into him let not
[54:32] your heart be troubled in other words
[54:34] this thing is ordained to be so hmm
[54:41] what Jesus Christ predestinated
[54:44] absolutely the Bible according to st.
[54:47] John excuse me Genesis 3:16 3:17 noon
[54:50] that day and that said that the serpent
[54:52] shall bruise the head the heel and the
[54:55] seed of the woman shall bruise the head
[54:57] of the serpent that happened on Calvary
[54:59] is that right Mary said I think in
[55:03] Isaiah 96 that the sons of a son of God
[55:08] God is going to give way to a son of God
[55:10] is that right his name shall be called
[55:12] wonderful counselor the Almighty God the
[55:14] Prince of Peace
[55:14] a virgin shall conceive did a virgin
[55:18] conceived ooh what was her name Mary but
[55:21] Mary was always in the scriptures she
[55:23] just didn't have a name so it's a bride
[55:27] of Jesus Christ we have always been in
[55:29] the scripture but we didn't have a name
[55:31] until now
[55:33] the Bible said the whole heaven and
[55:34] earth is named after him him who Jesus
[55:38] Christ whoa predestinated we can't help
[55:43] be but the way we are is that right
[55:46] come on somebody the Bible said excuse
[55:50] me according to men 325 said five
[55:52] virgins will be wise and Phi will be
[55:54] foolish hmm that means amen whoever
[55:58] belong to the fire is predestinated to
[56:01] be foolish and whoever loan to the wise
[56:03] its predestinated to be foolish 10
[56:05] virgins you know it's more than 10 y'all
[56:11] know what I'm saying it's just it's just
[56:13] a figurative that they're going to be to
[56:16] two kinds of believers one will be
[56:18] filled with the Holy Ghost and the other
[56:20] one will not be right now look what the
[56:24] prophet of God says in he says listen if
[56:26] we are laden with sin with unbelief
[56:30] because you know sin is unbelief sin is
[56:32] not smoking drinking lion stealing
[56:34] that's attributes of sin he said if we
[56:37] are laden with sin with unbelief with
[56:39] slothfulness we shall not make that
[56:43] rapture we know it Lord so we pray that
[56:46] you burn into us the Holy Ghost down in
[56:51] our hearts oh god said our souls afar
[56:54] with your blessings help us to
[56:57] understand God doesn't call me into
[57:01] judgment without first warning him that
[57:02] was in 1963 so the Bible tells us the
[57:06] coordinates Isaiah 40 and to speak
[57:09] comfortably to Jerusalem and crying to
[57:13] her that her warfare is accomplished
[57:16] that her iniquity is pardoned so what
[57:19] I'm trying to tell you the greatest
[57:21] revelation of this message to me is
[57:23] election that I and you we have been
[57:28] elected and chosen by God before the
[57:31] foundation of the world to be in this
[57:34] day to be called bride right that means
[57:38] if we have been elected and tried we may
[57:41] try to run we may try to hide we may do
[57:44] a lot of things you know brother Brown
[57:45] said like this she said
[57:46] he said it said sometimes it takes a
[57:48] long time for a true son of God to come
[57:51] recognize that he is a true son of God
[57:54] and there are a lot of people that's why
[57:56] you can't condemn them that's why you
[57:58] can't judge them you don't know who's
[58:00] who sometimes they may come to be a son
[58:03] of God on their deathbed but if they're
[58:06] chosen and elected they won't miss it
[58:08] they cannot miss it because God has
[58:11] already determined their destiny right
[58:15] destiny look back to what for knowledge
[58:18] and for another look do an election by
[58:25] the foreknowledge of God because he
[58:26] knows everything he knew you and I would
[58:29] choose to do right over wrong so he
[58:33] calms down and he gives us the grace of
[58:35] God opens our understanding to the
[58:37] revelation of who he is so that we might
[58:40] be saying it ain't about your study in
[58:43] hearing about nothing but the religion
[58:45] of God the mercies in grace of God
[58:48] so I'm comforting you tonight so that
[58:51] you can understand it's not by power
[58:52] it's not by mind but it's by my spirit
[58:55] saith the law hallelujah is not him that
[58:59] will it know he that runneth but God who
[59:02] shows mercy hallelujah
[59:04] it is because God has chosen us because
[59:07] he knew in that battle when Lucifer was
[59:10] up there we chose them to fight with
[59:13] Christ did y'all know that all these
[59:18] demons that we called Mimas used to be
[59:20] in the same church they've fallen angels
[59:23] when God kicked them out that's what
[59:25] they became hello so what are you saying
[59:29] that was the thing that Adam had yet to
[59:33] do he never put the devil under his foot
[59:37] that's why the Bible says until the
[59:40] enemy comes his footstool Jesus Christ
[59:45] is the only one that he did what the
[59:47] first Adam didn't do he conquered death
[59:50] hell and the grave he put everything
[59:53] under him right he Alette
[59:56] captivity captive he gave gifts unto men
[1:00:00] hallelujah he did everything the first
[1:00:03] Adam could not do now it is up to you
[1:00:06] because this is Satan's Eden and is up
[1:00:11] to us by the power of the Holy Ghost to
[1:00:13] put Satan under our feet under our
[1:00:17] control
[1:00:18] y'all understand me we're not on the
[1:00:20] ears under our control that is the power
[1:00:23] of this message you said what do you
[1:00:26] mean oh you better understand what I'm
[1:00:28] saying
[1:00:28] becuase winded serpent came remember
[1:00:31] brother Brandon had that vision of the
[1:00:32] serpent and that serpent came out from
[1:00:34] among the people in the waters how did
[1:00:36] he find them he didn't grab him he
[1:00:38] didn't hit him with something he spoke
[1:00:40] it
[1:00:40] he bind the serpent by the spoken word
[1:00:43] somebody help me here why because he was
[1:00:47] a son that was adopted so therefore
[1:00:49] every adopted son will have the power to
[1:00:52] bind the serpent huh that's where we're
[1:00:57] going it has to be that even when Jesus
[1:01:02] returned the Bible said out of his mouth
[1:01:04] Camus a sword a flaming sword it was the
[1:01:08] Word of God that defeated Satan even in
[1:01:11] the last battle hallelujah and you and I
[1:01:15] must understand we have been prepared
[1:01:16] that's why we're going through all the
[1:01:18] trials that's why we're going through
[1:01:19] all the tests that's why we're going
[1:01:21] through hardships that's why we're going
[1:01:23] through heartaches and then because God
[1:01:25] is trying us he's shaking us he's moving
[1:01:28] us he thought he's won't he don't want
[1:01:30] nothing to rattle hallelujah he's
[1:01:33] packing us with his virtues victory
[1:01:36] after victory at the victory at the old
[1:01:37] brothers am I going to make it
[1:01:39] I've already made it you've already
[1:01:41] mated hallelujah that's what the prophet
[1:01:44] of God when he went behind the curtain
[1:01:45] of time he said I saw you there
[1:01:47] hallelujah and if you have a theophany
[1:01:50] you will hear this message if there is a
[1:01:54] word body for you you will hear this
[1:01:57] message because when you hear this
[1:01:59] message brother and said you have heard
[1:02:01] from your theophany that means you are
[1:02:03] etern somebody help me here that means
[1:02:09] you are eternal isaiah 55:11 says so
[1:02:14] shall my word be that goes forth out of
[1:02:16] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:02:19] void that's why Jesus in this dimension
[1:02:22] when he talked to his disciples he said
[1:02:24] if you say to this mountain if you say
[1:02:26] to this mountain be thou a moving cast
[1:02:29] out into the sea what was he what was he
[1:02:31] working with hallelujah
[1:02:33] he wasn't training them for this world
[1:02:35] he was training them from the world to
[1:02:37] come oh we have no I I don't want to
[1:02:42] inject my thoughts but I tell you what I
[1:02:44] got some wonderful thoughts concerning
[1:02:45] what is gonna be like on the other side
[1:02:48] of the curtain hallelujah Oh glory to
[1:02:54] God
[1:02:55] he's a accomplished that which I please
[1:02:58] is that right
[1:02:59] he said you whatsoever you ask in my
[1:03:01] name believing that you shall receive it
[1:03:03] as it is given right and if you can
[1:03:06] speak the word with confidence knowing
[1:03:09] that it's the will of God you don't have
[1:03:11] nothing to fear God will back his word
[1:03:14] every time almost done now it should
[1:03:17] complex that which I please hit and it
[1:03:19] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[1:03:22] sent it hallelujah
[1:03:24] and I'm gonna use that script and
[1:03:25] clothes on it if you are the word you
[1:03:33] cannot come back to God as a failure
[1:03:38] because the word cannot come back for
[1:03:42] you understand say whatever God has
[1:03:46] purpose you to do in this dimension you
[1:03:49] got to do it there's no way you can get
[1:03:52] out of it is that right oh you can run
[1:03:55] like Jonah but when you run from God
[1:03:58] you'll find out you right in the program
[1:04:00] where God wants you to be is that right
[1:04:03] Jonah thought I'm running I ain't gonna
[1:04:04] do it ain't preaching out on God says
[1:04:06] okay I got a will prepared for you by
[1:04:08] the time I'm done you'll be right and
[1:04:12] that's how it's been that way for all of
[1:04:15] us is that right did Jonah do what God
[1:04:17] said do absolutely and he did it and
[1:04:20] caused the revival is that right now
[1:04:28] listen the Bible said he had several
[1:04:30] stars in his hand and Luther was one of
[1:04:32] them
[1:04:33] Luther was a staunch Catholic priest and
[1:04:37] God started working on Lucifer
[1:04:40] I mean Luther excuse me he's down Luther
[1:04:45] could not help it he had to rebuild it
[1:04:49] was in him to do it
[1:04:51] and when God opened that word to him the
[1:04:54] just shall live by faith he became like
[1:04:57] a house on fire on a windy day nothing
[1:05:00] can put him out hallelujah it ain't our
[1:05:03] power is his power God will set you
[1:05:06] afire you don't set yourself a fire he
[1:05:08] will set you afire you love the Lord
[1:05:12] hallelujah like I said and I'm just
[1:05:18] closing on this God word will not come
[1:05:22] back void so every seed of God that was
[1:05:26] of the lineage of the real Adam was
[1:05:29] packed away in a place called Paradise
[1:05:33] right we didn't even know paradise
[1:05:36] existed until Jesus came who was the
[1:05:40] word we didn't know where they went
[1:05:42] right but we saw there in the scripture
[1:05:44] where Abraham was Bear was his and Sarah
[1:05:47] was bear within his people in his
[1:05:49] kindred and when I got always puzzled me
[1:05:51] why would they be buried there because
[1:05:52] they're not dead
[1:05:53] they're living when they were buried in
[1:05:57] the natural they went to their the place
[1:05:59] of their father you understand me
[1:06:02] so they were all the Bible said they
[1:06:04] were all gathered together you can't be
[1:06:06] gathered together if you did you
[1:06:08] gathered together because you're living
[1:06:10] that's why God says I am the God of
[1:06:12] Abraham Isaac and Jacob is that right
[1:06:16] but he got to be the God of Abraham
[1:06:17] Isaac and Jacob and you he must become a
[1:06:21] personal revelation to you right so you
[1:06:24] and I must understand we're gathering
[1:06:26] all this places so after the
[1:06:27] resurrection when Jesus died and
[1:06:29] resurrected the Bible said he went into
[1:06:31] the region of the laws he condemned
[1:06:33] those who did not believe in Noah
[1:06:35] because he said listen it wasn't Noah
[1:06:37] voice that you heard that was my voice
[1:06:39] through Noah right it ain't we
[1:06:42] and Brandon's voice you hear is God's
[1:06:43] voice through his right it wasn't Moses
[1:06:47] voice you heard it was God's voice
[1:06:48] through Moses right that's the way God
[1:06:51] works is that right even Jesus Christ
[1:06:54] says that he doesn't speak of himself
[1:06:57] hallelujah he speak of the one that sent
[1:06:59] him he said I can't even do nothing
[1:07:02] except the father showed me hallelujah
[1:07:06] you understand me so it was God in
[1:07:08] Christ that's the mystery God in Christ
[1:07:12] not two gods but one God in one body
[1:07:15] hallelujah but they it's difficult but
[1:07:18] all I could say like this so is it must
[1:07:20] be a game God in one body though the one
[1:07:25] body be millions they have the same Holy
[1:07:28] Spirit they have the mind of Christ
[1:07:31] they'll do the works of God
[1:07:33] see you don't do the works of God when
[1:07:36] you get to heaven you do the works of
[1:07:37] God here now you're going to do things
[1:07:39] up there too right but the thing is in
[1:07:43] order to go there you must be formed and
[1:07:45] shaped like a belly baby in his mother's
[1:07:46] womb formed and shake shaped into the
[1:07:50] image of God in this womb before you go
[1:07:52] to that world right if you came from
[1:07:56] there you'll go back today if you came
[1:08:00] from hell
[1:08:00] you'll go back to hell because no matter
[1:08:02] how religious Judas was he could not
[1:08:05] come to a place where he humbled himself
[1:08:07] to get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:08] right that's what it is so you and I
[1:08:11] must understand every man and woman who
[1:08:13] do not come in this day because one time
[1:08:16] God used to weaken English ignorance
[1:08:18] about said he no longer wink because the
[1:08:21] full truth of God's Word has come and
[1:08:23] there is a word that we're preparing for
[1:08:25] little by little step by step we'll make
[1:08:29] this journey
[1:08:30] hallelujah not by power not by might but
[1:08:34] by my spirit but if you could come to
[1:08:37] see who you are then you begin to push
[1:08:40] and press toward that mom like Paul says
[1:08:42] and you know I want to say it like this
[1:08:44] the press that we always think like this
[1:08:46] it's not that it's yielding your will to
[1:08:49] God lest an
[1:08:53] oh oh oh
[1:09:43] [Music]
