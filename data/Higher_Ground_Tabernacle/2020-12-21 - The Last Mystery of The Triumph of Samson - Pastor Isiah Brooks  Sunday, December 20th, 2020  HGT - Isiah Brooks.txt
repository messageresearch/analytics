he My [Music] Savior and all God's [Music] fullness well in [Music] Hallelujah as we stand we'll get right into the word of the lord we appreciate the musicians we always do sometimes I forget to sing and I thought I better start tuning up by God's grace that's one time there was one time that's all I did do practically but uh somehow I guess I've drifted away from that but I don't want to lose what God has given me ver anyway let's turn to judges the 16th chapter you know uh we're living in a time where correction is necessary and if we can't stand correction you know it lets us know that something is wrong with our spirit the Bible is here to correct us and to make us better Christians correction is not something that is joyous but is needful and after correction then you can have your joy but judges 16 the Bible is always correcting me God's word always correct me there's always something in my life that I need to get right and I appreciate the Lord Jesus for that appreciate him writing this Bible thinking of me you've got to take it personally this Bible was written for me and I love the word I love what God is doing for me and in me is there b are there battles yes there are battles they are intense at times but sometimes I realize that our battles are not even the devil sometime it's our own thoughts and ideas as brother vam said we are our worst enemy and you know with this flesh is never the flesh is evil when it ought to be generous it's not when it ought to be kind is not it's something that we must kill daily and keep it under in check Paul said uh sometime the good that I would I find myself not doing then I find myself doing the things that I don't want to do but I realize by God's grace that in this I have Victory because God has given us the victory judges 16 4-9 and it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of sarup whose name was elah and the lord of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lies and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him we will give thee every one of us 1100 pieces of gold now I don't know how many Philistines was there but 1100 pieces of gold will do me just right but the Bible tells us that according to the number of Philistines we just we must believe that when it was all over if she would have won if she would have deliver Samson like they wanted her to which she really did she ended up by God's grace a rich woman let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do for us forgive us of our sins cleanse us from all our unrighteousness father we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I didn't have a meal in between service so I was kind of snacking on some potato chips trying trying to give me a little energy and and of course uh brother Liz Paul walked in and caught me and I felt a little ashamed of myself just prior to preaching but I was caught with the goods amen so anyway by God's grace we want to entitle this message the last mystery of the Triumph of Samson and we talked about this uh last service and how Samson uh was a True Believer he represented uh the True Believer brother bam tells us that with every Revival you have twins and so somehow sometimes when I'm talking in my in my passage of scripture uh and I'm going back and forth I'm trying to hit both the the Jacob and the Esau I'm trying to hit the positive and the negative but at the end of the day we know that the positive always come out on top now we know what Delilah means and said that I think the last time Delilah means to entice and it's used as a a verb and not a noun so we understand that was the spirit it was an enticing spirit and remember brother brandham preached that to the church so that we can understand that in this age we're dealing with an enticing spirit it's the same kind of spirit amen that uh Adam and Eve had to deal with when it came to the serpent the serpent enticed amen uh Eve and the Bible his enticement was so good if I could say it like that so well won't use the word good but he enticed her till she didn't even know she was doing evil she was begal and The Same Spirit from the beginning or since the beginning has traveled throughout the days of and the decades and we find out that we type out uh Samson as being the true church and Delilah as being the false church we also showed you that the Philistines was a type of the Roman Empire she was the Roman Catholic church now to entice him was her duty this is was her job and we showed you even in the opening of the seals the first seal here was uh Ephesians or Ephesus Church amen aimed at and relaxed see you when you be began to get prideful or you began to get uh over uh confident in in what you can do it causes you to relax and that spirit amen in Samson caused him to relax cuz remember amen Samson fell asleep on Delilah's knees so he had he had forgotten that you know Not only was Delila Philistine but he forgotten amen that they were the enemy and just ass soon soon as we forget that Satan is our enemy we become his foe we become his prey and so we understand by God's grace that El Delilah amen came to entice as that spirit amen in the first seal came to entice and what did she do what did that Spirit do in the first seal amen moving into the second seal amen he call a deed to become a Doctrine because they wanted to know the strength they wanted to know the weakness and the weakness of every believer is when we failed to do the word anytime we fail to obey the word remember theila is there she's there to entice you amen and understand the Bible we know that when the Devil comes at us he doesn't come at us you know like Roar I'm the devil but he all always come in seet clothing he always come in a subtle way that you will miss him if you're not spiritual and this is what happened to Samson and as I said I'm not I'm going to go hopefully not be long but we understand to entice means to lead on by exciting hope or desires to Allure to Allure and and we find out that is the working of a serpent because snakes amen when they travel you know they don't make make a lot of noise sometime they Slither so quietly you don't even know they're there until they're standing in your face that's the kind of a thing and then that was happening with with Samson he was playing with a snake the snake was so cunning the ler was so cunning amen because here she was on a job it was intentional just like the the first church age when the White Horse came and and and Paul says now I want you to know the Antichrist spirit is already here right and this made Delilah an antichrist spirit because she was coming against the anointing of God and her her purpose was to stop the anointing of God remember what I'm saying now because you got to understand that this message we said well brother Brooks that was for denominationalism no no no no three months after the opening of the word opening of the seals Seven Seals brother Brandon preaches this message and he wasn't talking to denominations because amen they were already put out but what who he was he talking to he was talking to a group of people that had come out of the Pentecostal age of the Pentecostal church or you know Apostolic whatever you want to call it but they knew the movement of Samson you and I must understand that when Samson started out amen and I'm talking about the anointing because he he was a Nazarite and he had Seven Locks and he was born that Nazarite or Nazarene and he was not supposed to cut his hair because in that Seven Locks I don't know whether it was braided whether it grew that way however the point is he was not supposed to cut it this was in the Covenant right and remember amen the the the the the worm of of Joel it was the Palmer worm the co uh the canker worm the the Palmer worm the Locust and the caterpillar and all of these worms amen came to eat away the truth so understand that when we talk about spirits we're not just talking about any kind of spirit the spirit that we're working with amen has been working through people amen even Jude tells us that there have been men who have been ordained amen for Destruction they came like Delilah they came to destroy or tried to destroy the working of God so we understand by God's grace here was Delilah now it looked just like a simple story but it's not because you find out that Delilah comes to Samson three times really four but the third time she came amen she came Amen to pin his head down and we'll get to that in a moment first amen time she came amen it was to tie his hand with whis and that is vines that have not uh been dried yet and and and she and S said well if you just get seven of those in time my hand see Samson was dropping in a little bit of truth that he should not have been dropping in at all just seven why couldn't he say five or six but what happened is he was under the enticement giving her a little something at a time amen so that she could think that he was telling her the truth so we find out by God's grace amen she ties his hand listen I don't know what she was giving him but she had to be a powerful woman that he would be so drunk off of her that he had no ideas that the Philistines was in the same chamber ain't that something how that's how it is with the devil amen we could get so drunk off of him we don't know he's got a a big ENT of demons ready to bind us right because you got to understand these these Devils that we're talking about is that right the Bible said mystery Babylon the great she is what the cage of all unclean spirits see and we're talking about demonic forces that have inhabited people a meant to literally stop the move of God that's what happened to Delilah so we find out that this thing is in our day I'm going to give you a few quotes in a moment how brother brandom talks about this the stage what I'm what he was working with was the condition of the church at that moment and he dealt with the Pentecostal well you say we're not Pentecostals but understand before this thing was called the message it was Pentecostal message came afterwards okay so I want you to understand amen that here was these people these uh Spirits amen came to do what to destroy Samson so that Samson could give his secret away now giving his secret away amen literally takes away the anointing God allows s s uh Samson to flirt with theila he was doing wrong he had done wrong but he still had his power you understand what I'm saying the Lord allow us to do wrong sometimes but the Covenant still stands right as long as you don't cut your those Seven Locks off your head the power of God is still with you the Covenant is still with you that was Samson's Covenant that's the church covenant keep those virtues let God continue to bless you right so anyhow we know that Samson the naite amen he is secret he was anointed he was anointed right in such a way and that's the way the church started out the day of Pentecost the True Church the true church starts off with a powerful anointing 3,000 Souls were saved one day right I mean the power of God the lame man walking at the gate of beautiful the blind right they knew knew that this anointing was with those people and they knew that anointing was with God yall understand me Samson in the natural of the type amen was so powerful what did he do was it three thou 300 uh how many souls he killed how many uh uh uh with the Jawbone of ass Philistines right amen and this what he did he comes along and he takes the Gate of Gaza and he and he takes it and he he carries it away don't you understand what that means that means when you conquers a man gate you conquered everything within the gate Hallelujah that's how powerful the early church was even in a Time amen when the devil uh told a little bit of the secret cuz you remember they took just a deed and made it the word just a little deed it's the same thing that Delilah thought uh Samson was telling her amen just a little de just a little Tie My Hands amen right but you see what happened is every time she tied his hand he became stronger and that's the way it was throughout the church ages Hallelujah every time Roma that Spirit of Jezebel or Delilah tried to stop the church she was Stronger she died in death she didn't run from the Lion's Den she was a powerful church and the word continued to spread this church is powerful even at the name of Samson it made people tremble see what I'm saying because he had that anointing and the Philistines knew as long as Samson live there is no way we can defeat him Hallelujah so just so you know amen that this anointing that we working with what what what you saying brother Brooks you and I must understand we are the center of this thing brother Bram said in this message he said listen they had monkeys uh talented monkeys and doing monkey shows and acrobats and all kinds of things that they had he said but Samson was the main event Hallelujah don't you understand what he's saying amen he said out of all the church ages out of all that had they've gone through this is the main event this bride of Jesus Christ Christ she is the main event this Nazarite because we're the only church that have not joined ourselves to the eunic move remember even Judah who means Praise Jesus came from the tribe of Judah is that right amen Judah amen linked their C Amen to the Philistines to fight against Samson hell and what has happened these message people who call themselves message people have joined themselves to this eom unical move to fight against this bride called Samson and you and I must understand Hallelujah God defeated them then and God will defeat them again Hallelujah see the church the first church was blessed with the seven spirits of God and the Seven stars in the right in his right hand they were abundant in faith and in the Supernatural remember brother brandom said it he said that that early church had all of the the virtues of Christ you see well how could that be they had to have had it otherwise they would not have been the seed and the seed of Christ had to be planted in order for it to live again y'all hear what I'm saying and all only into this day that seed came up again Hallelujah throughout all the church ages they had life they were weak but they had life Hallelujah but this age is when the seed come back to seed Hallelujah the alpha become the Omega Hallelujah so those Stars represented the light and the anointing of those Messengers and the Seven golden counter sticks of course represent the power of the Holy Ghost so you understand when God came and he came by God's grace the first coming was mighty Hallelujah well what about the second coming the first coming of Christ amen he came as a babe the second coming Christ he comes as a glorified Jesus Christ amen who's greater which is greater in manifestation amen the second coming so anyway we realize amen they these people in the first coming were they were Witnesses of Christ and Witnesses of the power of the Holy Ghost is that right we look throughout all the church ages and throughout history and we see how these people fought amen that spirit and every time that Spirit thought he got the best of them amen they would come back with something else then what happens a Darkness came a blindness came right but the Bible said God has never left himself without a witness is that right that Roman church amen held him in captivity for a thousand years Hallelujah you understand me then here come Delilah and she's saying to Samson let me pin your head down right cuz Samson told him the only way you can stop me is to weave my hair together and pin me down right and don't you understand just that word well amen make you all to think amen because we got to dealing with when when your head is in attack it's dealing with your intellect is that right and that's what the devil did when he saw uh he tried to to to hold down Luther he tried to hold down Wesley he tried to hold down all those great leaders during that time why it was the intellectual age Hallelujah but God with that intellect defeated defeated every move that that that old Delilah made and she said well I thought you had done told me everything oh you ain't seen nothing yet amen at a time that death was supposed to completely set in because remember that fourth horse rider was death and and and we know by God's grace that Samson came to a place where he he understood he was spiritually dead he was so tired he was so weary amen he didn't know what to do and what like I was trying to tell the church this morning you know what they didn't want to re some it felt like some didn't want to receive it I said but we're just like Samson right now grinding at the wheel because listen compare us just to compare us to ISU Street compare us but compare us when brother B was here even then people did greater miracles signs and wonders amen he was the of our day and God delivered this great message to us showing us amen that God wants to see a mighty is that right brother say God wants us to be a Powerhouse huh but remember enticing Spirits enticing spirits will change just a little bit of the word and it when how you know it's changed because when it makes the word say something different than what it is right so what what what happens amen they come and you hear people say well the seventh seal is not open enticing Spirits because brother B said they're open y'all hear what I'm saying when We Gather men and make them our Gods right because remember that's what happens when when when when when men begin to take the place of God they get high they got lifted up is that right because remember what the Philistines were they were rich people now I'm talking of spiritual spiritually amen there was another church order they were but they worshiped Deon right and Deon is a fish half man half fish right and he was the god of fertility the Bible according to Isaiah says many are the are the bond many of the children are the bondswoman now words those real children of the free is small in number and realize this is the only day this day where the church is Rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing cuz I'm sure that's the way Delilah felt after she got that gold I don't have need of nothing you understand me so you say well what do you mean brother book where are you going with this so that you could understand understand amen that Delilah that Spirit of Delilah amen was a religious spirit it was a white horse rider impersonating Christianity trying to find the source of strength and by what means we may prevail against him see she mixed that that innocent that little white horse with political power then she changed her color from white to Red Hallelujah and the church state became equal right and and and find and see so that find a way so that we can have equal ground so that we can destroy him by numbers and that's exactly what happened you said well what do you mean 44 a million more in 44 what was it this church was growing even the Pentecostal church was growing growing growing brother said I forgot what year that was he said the pentacostal had more growth than even the Catholic church but what was it increasing in numbers to do what downplay this little group Hallelujah you're nothing hello you don't even have power anymore and I'm not going to be long cuz I want you to understand never in the history of this message have this message been so weak you understand me when I say that the message is not weak but the people around the message is weak what is it she's fooling around with the Lila enticing Spirits doing things that we ought not to do saying things we ought not to say y'all understand me flirting with this enticing woman and she's there to take your strength away and so what happens amen Samson had no idea that while he was flirting and listen whatever drugs she gave him had to be really nice and the reason why I say that because there is no way that a man can fall asleep and a woman listen because let me put this way she had this man come in to cut his hair how can someone and who was that the devil he comes in and he cuts Samson hair and he doesn't even know it he doesn't even know his Covenant is gone he doesn't even know his strength is gone Hallelujah until she cries out Samson the Philistines are upon you do y'all understand what that mean what she's saying Samson The Squeeze is now here cuz you just gave your powers away you just gave your Covenant away you just told her what keeps you safe Hallelujah and what did they do they made mockery of him they put out his eyes and that's what's wrong with people now they say I believe brother Brandon but they don't want to do what brother Bram said he's the prophet of the age he's the eye that God used that's like those demons in the rest of them I'm coming to Demons cuz the demons Amen in Paul's day rejected Paul he was blind you know where he's at he's in Hell how you know that cuz brother R said he wasn't in heaven so there's only one place else to go now you say what do you mean here was demon sh carries I'm showing you now this is where Delilah gets us when demon Saran amen when he pulled himself into that Catholic HH thing there that that EC communal move and and and talking about how the experience with with the Pope was such a great experience have been around brother brandham in all those meetings what he was a sign he was the true Pentecostal they used to call him Mr Pentecostal but he was a sign that the Pentecostal age was blind here they were with Malachi 4 Hallelujah standing right before him Christ revealing himself right to them and they were so blind they could not even see that was him he said I stand at the door and knock If any man would open up to me I would come in and suck with him and who was he talking to he was at the Pentecostal age that age that age of Leia I'm rich increas with good and guess what they had to have sold out because of money you said oh no yes sir even the gospel businessmen brother said that all all they could do is praise God for their Cadillacs and their big houses and all the money and stuff that they had now gained from the gospel what was that that was Delilah that was the spirit of enticement pulling them in to the World Council of churches you say oh but they're not dead yes they are I look on the YouTube and I get grieved these Pentecostal churches they singing powerful songs they're shouting they dancing they're speaking in tongues and doing all these things and yet they're dead God has rejected them you see where we at so now we're carrying the truth and God would not even I'm closing in just a bit because I don't I'm just done sumarized everything amen but God comes right around and all of a sudden he does something at a moment while they persecuting you say we're not being persecuted yes we are they're making fun of us on the internet people who once was with us amen scon us and would spit in our face if they could huh they're making fun where is this message what y'all y'all fight y'all do y'all you see they pulling out all of the stops and they spanking us and we can't say a thing what can we do even the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe what signs you understand me as a group amen there's nothing we're weak people are afraid of viruses and cancer listen it's just there's a Time cancer could not stand in the presence of God no disease you say oh he wasn't under that Spirit yes he was when he stepped to that pull pit and he said I'll take every Spirit under my sub he was like Samson he took the gates of the enemy packed it on his shoulder Hallelujah every demon in hell was afraid of that man not because of the man but because of the god in the man Hallelujah is't that funny because that's exactly what happened Amen to the the the when brother uh Jesus Christ crossed over the the sea and went to the gatarina and and what those demons said what have you come to torment me before our time huh and that's the kind of anointing Samson had and that's the kind of anointing Samson will have before Christ come again you say oh brother Brooks what are you saying because I'm going tell you here's the secret it was during the Great persecution Samson had done grind at the meal and nobody knows how long he had to grind but now this is time for this thing to not long no longer be a closed type of thing it was open where all the Philistines can see you understand what I'm saying this persecution will be done in a closet you will be brought out you will be the center of Attraction brother said we we are the main event and was like an arena and you know what you know amen this this generation loves sports just like in the Romans days just like in the Greek days amen they took us and they put us before the Lions and everything else and thought that was wonderful that was fun do you think we're going to escape I don't know how far it's going to go but it's going to get pretty dark Hallelujah now you young brothers and and all listen this is what encouraged me about you because your life keep telling me that you really believe there's a possibility that there is a possibility that we can bring God on the scene again and this is what I'm about I'm about that possibility is that right don't you understand that in itself is a vision in other words brother said that's a revelation cuz everybody in this message don't believe it could ever be that there are those waiting on William Brandon when we are waiting on the anointing you understand what I'm trying to say I'm not trying to cut people down I'm trying to say that's where enticing comes in you're looking for the wrong thing there was nobody else there to help Samson that young boy oh Samson was so tired and weary unto death he said amen he said just just let me lean upon these posts and no doubt while he was leaning he must have just did one of these things because even Samson during his persecution had no idea that his hair had grown back understand what I'm saying if that's the way it is you see because when brother Brandon when those seven Thunders uttered amen it was in the course of where the prophet of God had already right been adopted he was one of the first adopted Sons even Jesus God said to him you know can you imagine God comes down and says can I walk with you wo have mercy Jesus amen what was what was it he stood the task he had come to a place where God had recognized him as an adopted son and he was the first of our kind man born of Sinners yet was able to allow God to come in him and live that way that's the kind kind of life we supposed to have it doesn't make us a prophet but as collectively God has called us the son of man there is a quote so you and I must understand he becomes us and we becomes him and here was Samson and who put his hair in locks you know brother talks about he said there was a there was a even the scripture said there was also he was a thunder brother call it a blast and out of that blast came seven un consecutive Thunders right now watch this his hair has grown back not even Samson know how it happened he don't even know how how come it grew so fast we don't know but we do know it was during the time of persecution that Samson's eyes were open you understand me and I'm not talking about his natural eyes I'm talking about his spiritual eyes his spiritual eyes was open and he recognized and remember the Covenant see that part of the scripture that brother random said he could not understand is that same part of the scripture when when when um uh Samson couldn't understand how his hair grew back like it did right and how the Covenant was still intact now now you got to understand the Covenant was now gone for a moment but now because he had no strength he had no power but we know by God's grace that whatever happened in that time and space nobody recognized it the Philistines saw him nobody said oh my God we better be careful his hair is grown back no they were blinded you see not even Samson knew that the anointing had already returned he didn't know that his power and his strength amen had returned until that appointed time that God was going to use it and that's how it is right now Hallelujah while you're being persecuted while the message is being laughed at and sconed and ridiculed it is the time that God God is strengthening the faith of the Believers hallelujah it's it's what's happening it's nothing we can control but it's something that God has held remember now he couldn't give it to Samson because Samson doesn't fail him fail Twice first of all he told his first wife the secret then he comes along and telling Delilah the secret you see so he couldn't tell the secret and so brother said listen this will not be duplicated there it won't be no mimicking it's all in the hands of God himself and it's an individual thing that will occur you say oh brother Brooks what are you crazy yes maybe I am but all I know is that Samson began to repent brother B said it's going to take a heavy a real heavy conviction a real heavy a serious mind and I I I got it down here but he he says it's going to take somebody who's really really serious about it and and and go through the confession and and and and really cry out oh Lord once more Remember Me this is the message this is a bride remember me right do it one more time don't y'all want to see it done everybody everybody all the other ages even before we came here in this time they have it they seen it and there's something in us we want to see it we want to see the devil defeated Hallelujah not by our own human strength we want to see it done the reality of this message this is what we see and we're saying within our heart oh Lord once more do it one more time it'll be a short quick work then they'll come after us really with all they got they'll look for us and we'll be gone like I told them and I'm closing on this maybe if the Lord give me something else to say but I generalize it because it's an evening service but let me say it like this there's no time to quit there's no time of giving up I don't care what everybody else is doing this is not a collective this is not a group thing is individual please sir don't get so discouraged this is message is right it's 100% we may not fully understand but he didn't say we had to understand everything we just had to have faith in it right we've got to believe it trust it and and and surely God will bring you out he'll bring you to that place amen you you you you say well what is this that makes me feel the way I feel I call it election what makes me know it's right I call it election you know how can you give up what makes it so I know where you going to go where are you going to go if if one was to give up where would one go there's no other place there's nothing nobody can preach this right I mean my point is this in this identification of knowing that this is where you belong this is you everything about you and that your name has come to be as his name Miss Jesus Christ what can you do with that you got to wait they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength is that the Bible don't worry don't don't fret you understand what I'm saying it's in the book he said one day you're going to find out where is written now he didn't say one day you're going to find out and that Revelation is going to be unfolded to you he said you'll find out where it's written see the written word has a revelation to it right but once you find out where it's written he's there to unveil it so you look at this and you say well okay why judges because I always say judges in my closing was a time when every man was right in his own eyes and here we are today at a time when Satan is doing everything to entice us with iPhones iPads television whatever kind of vision everything understand science is here and that's exactly what Lucifer enticed Eve with science and so you and I must understand science will be against you it is not for you you understand me it is your enemy and everything that they doing noway in this world is science believe science believe science and I how many times we can go through science and see you were wrong here you were wrong there you were wrong here you were wrong there but you can search this Bible and you won't find one error God's word has never been wrong so by God's grace and like I said I I'm not through with judges I got a lot of little things I want to bring out but my point is this and I realized one thing that scriptures that says not by power it's not by might but by my Holy Spirit sayth the Lord understand that's what we trusted not in human flesh not in ideas not in our own strength brother R said God s Samson gave God his strength but God wanted his heart that's what he wants that he was what he wanted did that's what he wants now that is the only place God can OCC as his throne and that's your heart let's stand just keep on praying for the Lord is not just keep on praying he he your cry for the Lord has promised and his word is true just keep keep on praying he'll answer you say keep on praying for the Lord is not just keep on praying he your cry for the Lord has found and the word is true just keep

defend him where was all the other Jewish people soall they weren't there he was all alone but there was something in Samson he knew that the Covenant was his God made the Covenant and he knew by God's grace that uh there's a possibility that's what I like how many y'all done messed up I done messed up big time many times but I'll never give up on God CU God won't give up on me come on brother
