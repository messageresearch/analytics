the Lord this evening uh just before we get into the preaching of the word I just want to uh sing one song it's not that difficult so if you catch it you can just um come in along and join me amen [Music] it says when I remember what the Lord has done I will never go back anymore no matter what comes no matter what goes I will never go back amen oh when I remember what the Lord has done I will

the words I will never go back to the world yes I will never go back to the world and I will never go back to the world amen you can stand up as we get into the preaching of the word I just like the song the no matter what comes no matter what gods we will never go back amen let us open our Bibles uh to the book of Esther chapter 4 verse of verse 14. verse 13 and 14. the fourth chapter of the Book of Esther because then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape the King's house more than all the Jews is or for if thou all together hold this thy peace at this time then shall they shall they enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed Detroit and who knoweth where the Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this is let us open our books to the Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 7 verse 24. therefore whosoever Hearth these things of mine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which builted his house upon Iraq and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and the and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rocks and everyone that here at this sayings of mine and do what them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon descent practice and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and bit upon that house and it fell and grade was the fall of it is May the Lord add blessings to the reading of his words tonight I'll I don't want you to speak for too long I want to speak on a subject for such a time like this amen it behooves us for us to know where we are at is I think most of us or all of us we ought to take this quarantine as a time to consecrate ourselves and have some self-reflections because many times you know the devil get us so caught up in a lot of things and we don't realize what's happening is scheduled to just to go to work every time you wake up go to work you're back to sleep and time is just going you don't know what's going on school that's all your life that's what's going on but it is important that once in a while we sit down just have a quiet time with God reflect on your life and see where you are at this is [Music] because sometimes you know as you travel along this journey you might find Cocoa bars sticking to your sticking to you around you know and you don't know where you got them so it's good you know sometimes to sit down and remove all those exes things that are stuck onto you I've done it a few times I sit down then I I look I look at myself I'm like do I really know myself is this me during that whole time you'll be going under a lot of change you don't even see it amen I hope all of us we take this time just to consider it I always and give ourselves unto God check our relationship with God clear up all those clogged up channels so to make sure that we are in a connection amen because we are living in such in such a difficult time the prime ages of all the ages of all the generations still since Adam this is the best one one could leave the two places you see Satan knows that this is the only chance he has for him to do his work accumulation of all of all Temptations trials and everything of all variants we are leaving in that time right now but we're glad to know that the greater the struggle the sweeter the Victory and the greater the testimony too amen I can just imagine after the victory is won and we are done here on Earth I just get excited every time I just start to think about it you know all the saints of the all this and all the stages of old could do all the saints of old they wanted to even this age so when we are going to go over there they're gonna come and crowd around us tell us how did you make it come on we wanted to live in that very age but God said no this is not for you who are supposed to live in it amen and we have no reason to not overcome because in every section God has placed the witness in a workplace environment A salesperson in school wherever God has a witness of somebody who is going to make it and we are going to judge the world so we have no reason to not overcome because God has given us the word amen amen so we're just gonna be we have to make sure that our victories are worth telling alone amen because they're going to look at you and say wow that's really the reason why you went to laodisia amen and we thank God for the word he gave unto us because every time God brings the word because it has a dual effect mercy and judgment Mercy to those who accept it and judgment to those who refuse it and he is a just God he never destroys without sending a warning we have seen him done it before with um with in the days of Noah a lot in Sodom and Gomorrah foreign [Music] amen but God is going to judge people according to that that each and everyone has gotten a chance to receive the word amen every time he brings a message of Mercy is it was going to rain get in the ark noise and it came down to Moses he brought the message of the token if you accepted it your life was going to be saved rejecting the message of the token you were going to be doomeda and we can never overemphasize the importance of having the holy ghosts like you have the Holy Ghost because we know in the end time where there's uh there's a lot of plagues that are going to be cast on upon the Earth this Corona virus is just the beginning of all of them the prophet of God talks about uh diseases where people's flesh just starts falling whilst they're walking the prophetically we ain't seen that yet so whilst there is still time come on in and get the inoculation come and get the Holy Ghost amen I'll read um a message from the oncoming storm paragraph 107. the prophet God says I'm told in the Bible that there will be a Time come on for those who are not in this wonderful sunlight that the followers of the air will eat their flesh of them that disease is on its road that the doctors will never be able to stop it it's the plagues of God the Egyptians doctors that was Far smarter than ours today limited Egyptian it is of their impersonators the power of God to hold his people under the blood of the Lambs amen the holy spirit is that door today the sentence the holy spirit is that safety today the sentence amen so you need that Holy Ghost because without it the doctors are not gonna find the key [Music] they just have to get the temple and we know God never received the worship of the Jews and the Gentiles at the same time [Music] when the Holy Ghost is going to be taken out from the Gentiles and time shall be no more amen if you don't get it right now it will be gone Hallelujah so you have to get the door this is the only door yellow and we are privileged to live in such a time for the whole 6 000 years they've been looking to the promise of the Raptors and the revelation of the Rapture all of the saints were waiting for it but God allowed them to go through the way of death but it is now come unto you and me Hallelujah we are the generation who's going to see the change of our bodies amen it is because for such a time like this Hallelujah we look at Esther is there when she was born she was born in a Strange Land Los Angeles and God allowed her to become the queen and now when she was in the palace it don't mean nothing that you're in the palace it decree that Hammond is sending he's gonna extinguish all of us amen and she was in that spot she was the only one who could do it and she saw that she was predestinated to be in that spot at that time and here we saw Hammond telling her it made me for such a time like this were you born among you are the potatoes Hallelujah so she had to come and fast and pray like never before because he had come to a time where it was a do or die and it was not the responsibility had landed squarely upon her responsibility and they call them for a fast for everybody and they prayed because they knew that our God answers prayers he said I will hear and I will heal your land so not only does he hear about it [Music] so whatever it is just get up and go into the king I have a special they've never seen people trusting God like never before because we know without God people overcoming uh people overcoming Temptations like never before they also wanted to do that David wanted also to live in such an age where he would overcome last David Julius amen but God said no this is not your time especially somebody who's supposed to leadership you want to see people overcome fear if you leave one of his own veins despite whatever comes in there would steps [Music] there is no such a their way we seen many strange doctrines coming in our way even in our own ranks in the message doctrines but there is only a special kind of people yeah on purpose who can withstand that Hallelujah it is because for such a time like this where you and I born trust God like never before I do not want Daniel to say God look over there I told you you should have let me go I don't want to be responsible for that response I want him to say for sure he had to be there because we have been given overcoming Powers Hallelujah we live in a parallel universe whilst everyone is in the laodicean age whilst the whole world is in laodice Hallelujah the eagle Age We Live above all the reproaches of the world the devil he poured the whole hell on Earth but God did not just fold his hand and wait like that he said when the Devil comes in like a flood I'll raise the standard against it when the devil opened the lead of hell and he poured it onto the Earth so you and I despise what's going on we can walk in Heavenly places and have a full taste of what it will be in glory yeah foreign [Music] Hallelujah amen because we know as the bride under the messenger we are going to be the final voice in this final age how will we the final voice of the final age you and I we are the voice of God to the people right now amen so we have to live like it just like we are Elisha from the Elijah the Holy Ghost operating in you and me it must be Elisha Ministry Elijah had the revelation of who Elijah was Revelation he know that although Elijah was gone the God was what the eligible [Music] that's why when he was walking back after he was with Elijah and he was left with the largest quote to Delhi and we know we're also left with the largest course amen when he was walking back to the river he had the Revelation he did not say where is Elijah he said where is the god of your life because you know it was the man it was the god not the man Hallelujah so we have the word in our hands and we are bound to overcome [Music] we are bound to part all those rivers of things that try to come in our way [Music] we use that very same word which is the revealed word of God nothing can stand before and Elijah did the same Miracles that Elijah did Elizabeth because he was using the same words because we got to amen is already written that we are supposed to win before the before the war is over before the battle is over we already know we have already won I've won offender so Satan cannot do nothing he was able to deceive the first Eve he ain't gonna do that to the second year because we have already made it before the foundations no matter what mistake you make you already made because it was as though you never done it in the first place to God In Prayer you throw it in the sea of forgetfulness amen and he will say you never did it when the devil the accuser comes to say he did it and God will say [Music] that's why it is impossible for us to fail foreign more than no one knows the Theology of the word to say like personally yeah you can quote it back to back he already knows his future and Revelations I just don't know imagine if Christians if we would have so much resilience no matter what it is we keep on going because we know we're gonna make it the difference between the devil and us is that we already know we're gonna make it but he know he ain't gonna make it but he keeps on doing it oh my God I just wish God gives us the grace [Music] and the ability to keep on going is amen like early on we read in the scripture in Matthew I was talking about the wise the wise men and the foolish man who built their houses one on a rock and one on on Sunday and when the when the when the storm came the wise man's house stood because his house was his house was built on a rock is the foolish man's house was was blown away by the storm because he didn't have foundations and he was called foolish because he did a foolish dead you know when a storm is coming you get ready for it when you know that there's a tornado coming you you go and run in the basement you don't go walking on the street you know amen so this parallels the the parable of the the the the ten virgins to see if if we're wise and five four five and the foolish ones so they were all virgins all ten of them let's read what the prophet of God says in the in the message the uniting time and sign the message paragraph 134 it says that's right let us get ready for this Midnight Cry it's coming in an hour when you think not alone there will be a cry not amongst the unbelieving world it'll be a secret foreign so and we know that the signs of the end signified a Midnight Cry that's going to come to to you and me and we're going to be ready for it so now the story of the the parable of this uh ten virgins I'll read here is how many of you all perhaps have heard have read of the virgins somewhere wise and some were foolish certain it is Virgin means Purity they were all good people every one of them virgin Sanctified vessels of God these versions were not random people [Music] identified vessels of God but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others were left out they were all virgins everyone is the movie they everyone believed in the coming of the Lord they were ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out don't let that be okay the Holy Spirit never let it drain from you let's passion when you feel your love dying away charity to Christ and to the course quickly go to him who has the Fountain of oil don't buy for yourself when you see your stock going down don't wait for it to get finished you might come when you don't have it you see how close this is the foolish virgins they were actually waiting for the Midnight Cry and they were Sanctified the only difference with the wise ones is they didn't have the oil the difference which is the Holy Ghost so they were Believers in everything the difference was the Holy ghosts so it's actually closer than we think right in our own ranks because we are told is coming as a secret not to the unbelieving world but to the believing world the foolish virgin was also waiting for the coming of Christ the foolish virgin was also waiting for the Rapture but they made one mistake they did not keep checking their oil and you see they actually had it at some point in time that's scary they had the oil sometime before but it happened that when the bridegroom came they did not have it so do you see how important it is to have the Holy ghosts and the prophet God tells us we are supposed to have a refilling every day it don't matter how long you've been in the message or a believer you see one other thing I heard the prophet of God saying the prophet you can have the Holy Ghost and go to hell I was like whoa you can have the Holy Ghost and go to hell it's because you would have allowed it to anoint your body and your spirit you don't allow it to get to the soul yeah you see now the devil doesn't care about that you don't mind even if you get it on your body or your spirit that's not gonna change your life you come in church songs are being sung the spirit comes down you feel it feel it on your body and you think you got it but when you get out the license if you see that happening that's a very big red flag come back and say God I want you to come with within the inner Court this foolish virgins because they just did not have the Holy Ghost can understand that okay this is no longer comfortable we gotta we gotta know how to fly now get ready to put our houses in order to check your lamp trim your lamb examine if you don't have the Holy Ghost go look for it whilst it's still there come in time when you're gonna try and find it and you don't see it because she's gone to the juice this reefer the doors of the churches will be now closed foreign he doesn't really get worried for you coming to church you don't mind you dancing and shouting in the spirit so long there is nothing in the soul he knows he's got you he can he comes to you to church he comes with you to church waits for you at the door he knows by the time he comes we're together that's the only thing that can scare the devil away so in is very important that we get the holy ghosts amen see people receive the Holy Ghost differently some without Sensations the results are still the same that somebody has received the Holy ghosts amen when you no longer do what you used to be amen you get in trouble if you tell somebody they don't have the Holy ghosts they'll get mad at you they'll ask you well so I do you have the spirit measure you know how to measure the Holy Spirit how do you know that come on you situ amen amen they gonna get mad I mean if they don't have it amen we are not here to judge people some participation but we know the word is the one that judges us and the Bible says but they are fruits you shall know that people are deeply your life screams out louder than what you say or what you professor [Music] and it's your life that's required when you when you want to get into your Heaven it's your life that's required yeah you just gonna snap like that yeah amen I understand we all make mistakes we are striving to get to that Perfection and we all make mistakes because amen but the more you have if you have the Holy Ghost you're going to strive to look to look more like Christ because we know nothing short of perfect love is going to make it you cannot keep a graduate your brother and expect you to be in the same Heaven how does that work you already you're already practicing social distancing before they even say you do it it's a constitution to particular distances because you can't see eye to eye with your brothers you tell me which kind of Heaven is that that you are going to go to and can talk to each other amen because that's what the Holy Ghost Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples by if you have love for one another so in such a time like this we are born to have we are born to have Divine love for one another some nipples you can only come with the Holy Ghost when you get the Holy Ghost you're not afraid of uh covet 19. they give it a name a nice scientific name but we just know is the devil is notifications amen we have dominion over it because we are told he has made us Kings and Priests what he says is low when you command demons they go those because you're a king you have authorities and we are priests because he's the chief priest if he is the chief priest who are the priests amen we say we're going to Crown Him Kings of King of Kings but then all the kingdoms of Earth will be gone yeah so which kings are these it's you and me he is the king he he is the king of us Kings so when we are now living in Heavenly places we might as well start practicing and using our Authority when Corona virus comes your way you are a priest when when a fellow brother gets in a gets in a situation you intercede for them that's the job of priests amen the power that was given to Adam when he lost it in Genesis God says he gave adam dominion over all things Dungeness he lost it after the fall but God took it before after he has given it to you so it is to our disposal to use it amazing because we got to know we are Kings and Priests we do not want that power to lay dormant in US amen but we gotta use it so don't lose focus let's keep on looking to Christ continue yeah the devil is putting so many things around us so we get distracted but we gotta stay focused on Christ we should get those blinders and just look towards him um as we are getting closer distractions we have to come all the way we gotta reach our final destination [Music] [Music] amen the devil is thrown out in front of us nice houses nice cars and you lose your focus of God a young person you know you want to focus on your career and that's all you have in your side there's nothing wrong in all of that it's good we all want it yeah but don't forget the main thing is and focus towards Jesus Christ turn your eyes towards Jesus he is the only main thing amen such a time like this the only way we have victories if we look towards Jesus it's from him that our help comes from you remember when Peter was walking on the water when he started he was looking towards Christ but he started seeing distractions all around here and he started looking around when he started looking around don't look around no matter what's around you keep it realize keep walking Focus On Christ we need the blinders of the word to keep Christ in our sights amen depression is starting to amount around you don't look at that level thank you it's not too late just cry out to him and say Lord help me the Bible tells us when Peter cried Lord help me immediately we don't know how far Peter was but we know God's hand was wrong enough to get a hold of him If my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and prayers [Music] there is no situation that's too big foreign amen because for such a time like this was you and I born she had she had the whole nation of of Israel going around in circles for 40 years and we know God was weeding out all the memories that was that was his plan but there was also another plan Rahab was supposed to be there she had to be in the lineage of Christ the story of Christ wouldn't have been complete without rahaba complete song the children of Israel could have taken a three days journey to the promised land This is 40 years because amen so for that time that's what that's the reason why she was born the way God was waiting for her to come to maturity so she could come into the into the tribe of Israel maturity is but God could not do it because he was waiting for you for you today because he says the word says you are the final runner in this race you know you know you know how they do it in the relay race is the fastest person every time when when the when the race starts everyone is quiet but when the last Runner has the button stick man everyone gets up amen because if the whole team is depending on the last round [Music] lay aside all the weight and sin great cloud of witness that's surrounding us all the sages we are the fastest in this race we are the fastest in this race foreign for the Brooks [Music] foreign [Music] Victorious [Music] say that one more time [Music] baby Glory through the blood of Jesus Christ
