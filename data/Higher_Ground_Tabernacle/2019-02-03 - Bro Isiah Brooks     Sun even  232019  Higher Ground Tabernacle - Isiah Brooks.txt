TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hey I felt dad that was pretty good thank the Lord Jesus was great save me here when I see the blood I'll pass ooh that took me somewhere thank the Lord for His grace glad to have everybody here or you man in the house of the Lord Amen sister seer appreciate your being here by God's grace always good to see you as we stand we're going to just go and read a short script you're gonna try to finish I don't know if I will be able to or what we started this morning first John 2 & 8 you don't be blood means more to me now than ever the unveiling of God [Laughter] hallelujah it in the thirst for his righteousness Amen means more to me than ever just want to be like it first John 2 & 8 first John 2 & 8 it reads again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shining let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you are our all in all and we thank you for this morning service we pray father God that you bless the service in a special way we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we spoke this morning we dealt with one God and I tried to bring it from an angle where all of us can see that this God is not something placed in a bottle you can never put God just in a bottle sometimes we say a box but you got to understand that even when God was in Jesus and the fullness of himself God still was on the throne because God is omnipotent he's omnipresent God comes along and when he feels you and he feels me there's still more of him I like that because I want just as much as I can get of him and you must realize by God's grace that Jesus Christ wasn't faking it when he stood there and he spoke and said father at that the tomb of Lazarus his father I know you hear my prayer he wasn't an actor that was reality that was the man Christ Jesus standing there talking to L or him and you must realize that even though it looked like two is still one because God is one we look at the pillar of fire and we know that God was in Moses but God also when God stepped into Moses Moses still had to listen to God he still had to find a place to pray because God is a spirit God is existence without God there would be no existence because God is the one who created everything and the Bible says everything that was created and made was made by him we know by God's grace II we he began to unfold himself in dispensations he broke himself down so much so into a man you and I could understand him these little peanut brains amen we got parakeet brains you know what I'm saying when it comes to the intelligence of God the officers of God we could never understand him the Bible said that his ways of passed finding out and so God had to find a way so that you and I can understand him one of the great things that God loved is fellowship yeah uh you know I we we look and see what Adam did how Adam failed and failed but we we don't see the pain that it calls God even though God knew it was going to happen God has feelings and we know that we can grieve him but yet he still remains God our thought of him we we liken God we we sometime we we we we how can I say it limit God when God is unlimited we think sometimes our problems cannot be solved because they may be great too but even God in the book and the Old Testament says a nation is like a drop in the bucket and you and I when it comes to the vastness of God the power of God we have only scratched the surface do you realize that the Holy Ghost himself that little pinpoint in your heart where God seals you it's just a token it is just a small piece of your inheritance and realize that this thing that's in you it's transforming you into what he is in other words he planted a seed on the inside of you that would literally grow into himself God rebirthing or creating himself in you as we were saying this morning when the children of Israel when God came along and he he Christ raised from the dead he took those all godly Saints that died under be under the our sacrifice of bulls and goats and bull oxen you know turtledoves and those Amen who sacrificed and believed that when they died that God would remember them it's amazing because God knew exactly which grade to go to he never lost count of those who died in faith and when he rose from the dead those who rested in him rose with him and folks they didn't just go to paradise because paradise was done away with they went beyond paradise they went beyond the Angels quarters they were beyond the region of the Archangels man they went into a place a man that we we we we came comprehend with our minds and you and I must realize it meant that we did not come here to settle to be of some kind of a religious organization that organizations as a man let me say it like this when you and I have children there are our children are entities of us there they're part of us and we give them that liberty and that freedom amen to discover themselves and to know who they are and what they are and their potential we give them that and that's what God is giving us he's giving us that Liberty to understand who we are what we are where we came from and where we're going but if we allow if we set would take our children and set them up in a room and close them in that door and says listen you can't go out of this this room this is rude you Ruth I'm here to save you I'm here to keep you I'm here to protect you and so therefore I'm gonna lock you up in this room and you can't go beyond this room you know what that would do it protect it would particularly it would actually excuse me send your child insane a dog could do it a cat couldn't do it and here's a man an inquisitive man a man with intelligence a man who who can reason a man who knows that he has been made and created to be free remember I said this morning I said all of that to sell that's what denominations do that what organizations do they plant a wall around you and they hinder your growth you may be a son you may be a daughter or of God but you'll never grow to your full potential because you have these walls you have these systems that have now closed you in and you can only believe if you've never seen the sunshine you never was able to have windows that we can look out and see the Sun you'll never know the Sun exists see that's what walls do it Prison you you understand me this message has not come to imprison you it has come to set you free it has come to let you know that there are no limitations to who you are as there is no limitation to who God is when you get the Holy Ghost it is not the summit it is not at the end of your journey it is just only the beginning of your journey God has given you something now where you can experience and understand those things that you cannot see with your eyes smell with your with your nose here with your ear hallelujah is that right he's giving you something now that could come in tune you into a world that science is trying to tap into hello God amen was transporting people before science ever thought about it hallelujah God amen new time travel before science ever thought about it hallelujah God amen was trying to tell us that even as a son of God hallelujah you have power over the elements is that right when Jesus listen is that true the king says listen I have thrown or didn't I throw throw three men in this fiery furnace but now I'm looking in the sting and now there's four watch this now because the fourth one he says look like the Son of God hallelujah but what about the other three how come they will not consume because the fourth man in the fire y'all understand me these things that God allowed us to see amen on such a level with oh what a miracle it would have never been a miracle in heaven because that's the way it is in heaven everything is subject you everything is subject to God is that Alright all things are possible to them that believe is that okay so you and I must understand God's existence there's only one God at the end of all things there will only be one God everything that has called itself God everything that has pretended to be God will be done away with and the only thing that will be left is the holiness of God he is the Alpha he is the Omega and what we need to do that's why we come to church you know we come to church to get charged or recharged is that right oh absolutely that's what the Prophet God said he meant recharge your battery here in the world of God should recharge you so oh I don't need recharging well even Jesus Christ needed recharging and he was God himself manifested in the flesh he literally got away from his disciples so he could be recharged hallelujah you and I must understand that everything is one when you get to heaven you're not going to see three you're going to see one even when you get to heaven there will be a number no man can number and win it all adds up it will still be one bride hmm you and I must understand the darkness has passed the Bible says there shall be light in the evening time when we look at at what the as Davis says Davis says amen he's a light unto my path way he's a lamp unto my feet in other words when Christ comes in your heart and into your life you're no longer dwell in darkness you're dwelling in the light that's why the Bible said when Jesus come again he said listen you will not be overtaken like a thief because you're not like a thief in the night he says why because you're no longer children of the darkness but you are children of the light and when Christ is in you that light is in you he says now he says I am he said I am the light of the world he said when when Alan he says one day you we become the light of the world see since also so you and I must understand we have a mission and our mission is to be the light of the world we can't act like them we can't walk like him we can't talk like them we can't live like them we must be the standard for this day a light unto them how else will they see it must be a difference we cannot be the same we cannot look the same Amen light and darkness is two different things and I as I understand science describe darkness as the absence of light that's why God puts us us in various places so that we can know and see Amen that whether you be a janitor whether you be a teacher teacher whether you be a scientist whatever you are when God incarnates himself in you you become that light you become Jesus on the job hallelujah and if you have not become Jesus on the job you must allow God to make you Jesus on the job that's what he got you there for don't you realize if you're not Jesus on the job you're going to have to give an account for it if somebody says at that judgment I didn't know she was a Christian I didn't know he was a Christian the blood is on your hands because you've been set there is that right you say what do you say the Bible says that the family of heaven and earth is named after him so if you got the Holy Ghost on the inside you supposed to be the light of God to show those people there is a difference when everybody is hating and easy on each other and just had everybody strong you supposed to be the Lamb of God but they are so jealous of me they supposed to be you're supposed to be so salty wherever you are it ought to make them want to be like you and the truth of the matter is you supposed to tell them they can be like you how existence as I said we only exist because he exists if there was such thing if there was such a thing that God would die when he would die you would die because his life life is God God is life remember I said that this morning there is no other life o chão don't you live like that you missing out on life the light they're talking about is not life that's death you're not missing out on anything oh because you get drunk and throw up in the morning excuse me I'm missing out on that goody-goody y'all understand me oh because you can do the crack in the cocaine and get sick and dry up and die I missed out on that good oh because you can live just this kind of life where you can go from one person to another and contract all kinds of diseases oh you're missing jonad good I'm missing our own death good oh you ain't nothing but a square yes sir and that city is built for square hallelujah and unanimous understand by God's grace that God has a place for you and I mean and we must live it it doesn't mean you won't be human but God expects some soup out of you some super human times amen hallelujah jesus wept as a man he's not expecting you to get rid of your emotions jesus wept as a man but as a prophet of God said when he rolled back those shoulders and said aloud come forth that wasn't a man that was God Hey and you and I have the same ability but you and I must stay connected remember I said that it is the devil's business he's trying to block you from becoming what you supposed to be hallelujah have you ever seen people well I used to have a prison ministry and you go to the prison and you find these these intelligent men locked up in jail intelligent smart artists musicians whatever they may be they could have been such a blessing to the world but guess what the devil trapped them block them so therefore this this these gifts that they have can never be expressed to the world and then because they have been entrapped here I understand me the Hollywood Hollywood don't have the most beautiful women out there there are far more beautiful women than that in Hollywood I've seen him in charge hello you see these beautiful women with no makeup and you think to yourself what would they look like if they had the extra that the world has come on somebody you know I must realize Amen that the grade is the cream of the crop are those people that serving God they said Brotherhood you don't look like you 63 you know why I've been touched by God I don't run the streets hallelujah amen I live a clean life hallelujah glory to God I see some of my friends that graduate with me and they look 10 to 20 years older some of them dead why they living in a different world I'm living in a life a world of life you said what do you mean brother Brooks I am not supposed to be growing older I'm supposed to be growing younger and the more I grow younger guess what I don't know how it's going to be but I believe that someday these wrinkles are gonna disappear this gray hair is going to move something's going to feel back in my because God promised it he is a God of restoration you say it can't happen in this day it did for Abraham Abraham and Sarah was turned back to a young and man young man and young woman we're in their time and after Sarah died Abraham got married again and had more children it's okay it's still one if you and I can stay connected and see this is why we talking about moving up the ladder faith virtue knowledge temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness holy zone divine love because once you get behind the curtain and brother Aaron says you know what we need to do he didn't set the curtain shut it you know once you get in there stay there because that's where the eternal life starts you understand me it blossoms rather aaron's rod that was dead nobody knew what kind of stick that was they didn't know by God's grace I meant what kind of rod that was what kind of tree it came off of but once it got behind the veil the life of God feel that rod see you can't you can't be in the Holy of Holies and stay there hmm it's not an up-and-down experience once you get back there what you are now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you understand me he can only produce life there is no depth not death don't have power over Shekinah hey hallelujah don't care how long you've been there get back there and all of a sudden you start block blooming hallelujah all of a sudden Amen you began to bear fruit hallelujah did you know that you and I are fruits on the Tree of Life hello I didn't say the tree of knowledge of good and evil remember I told you Jesus said you either make the tree good or make it evil you cannot make heaven being the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he meant science and mind over matter and I'm gonna live right and I'm gonna do right and I'm not gonna do this and I'm not gonna do that that is up the tree of good and evil but when you're born again you're born of the tree of life and that tree can only bring fruits of life whoo is that right it ain't my word Jesus are you either make the truth good or you make it evil you make it up God or you make it up the devil you understand me see when Jesus raised from the dead and I said that this morning when he raised from the dead he showed he was he told he told Mary Martha I am the resurrection that was before he died and he proved he was a resurrection and not only did he was was he resurrected but he also brought all of those saints and patriarchs that had been laying in the grave for hundreds of years I love that I love that if God can take gust and Reese Ormand and reshape it into the very image it was headed perfect state before it died Abraham didn't raise an old man Sarah didn't raise a whole woman Joe wasn't an old man he raised from the dead in his youth he went into heaven in his youth and then we worry about cancer tubercle whatever disease we worry about that when you can all you got to do is connect with God and God and make it all right hallelujah Oh glory to God is that okay you and I must understand we're talking about God he's in all above all through all he's everywhere you can't get rid of him unless said you can't get rid of him you not living you breathing this air did you know God create an air for you you never heard about a breath until God created Adam out of the dust and Adam lived before he was in the dust but once God put him in the dust God gave him a breath when you and your fearfully you don't breathe there's no blood in heaven flesh and blood will not enter that's why when you hear that heavenly choir to go yeah I can't hold it now they can hold it for as long as they want to because they don't have to they don't eat they don't have to eat there's no blood that need oxygen there hallelujah but did you know what breath just signifies you living you're dying you're gonna end this into that but when you're in God don't get me wrong those those Saints over there that's in God they're waiting to come back down here now I don't know what the glorified body is gonna consist of how it's gonna be but I know one thing it'll be able to transfer Trent how could I say it it'll be able to walk through the walls when Jesus rose from the dead what did he do he walks through walls here to be able to disappear and appear and yet it still be able to eat go to God yeah I don't know I'm having a good time up here why because there is no ending to the believer just like there really was never a beginning you did not begin here you you existed before you came into your mother's womb you know where you are you were in Elohim that's why you love the gospel that's why you can't turn it loose let me put it this way that's why he can't turn you a loose you returned home and what we go through this is a short period of time think about it James says is a vapor then happening you've seen a vapor it just goes comes and goes who was what was that right that's our light here and I don't understand what people will it will exchange a vapor for eternal life it makes no sense to me but when you come to know that God is God he's the God of heaven he's the god of Earth he's a God of hell and the Bible said every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that is Lord to the glory of God hallelujah if we understood if we could understand when you're born into the family of God amen you know one thing about those Brooks's they all got to hear - like it can't help it they got their daddies here someone might look a little more like their mama but one thing about that head is something about their head they say they all look alike and it's true they can't help it that's how it is with somebody's born of God if you born of God you got to look like him you can't even help it it's in the genes Oh Lord listen what am i preaching for I'm trying to tell us you and I if we're not careful like that like that like that Lutheran settled and became their organization the Methodists settled became an organization the Pentecostals settled became an authorization the the message believers have settled right they may not organize on paper they may not go to the courts and do it spiritually they're doing things they shouldn't what are they doing suddenly this is not a time to settle like I said this is not the summit I got a good talk for you you and I must realize by the lens that God is trying to bring us into another realm we cannot stop here it's too much to be done too many things God wants to do through who you and I what good is the blood of Jesus Christ if it cannot show us victorious in our age Christ must be victorious in this age we cannot go out here as losers we can't go out here oh when you formalize or will you become starchy and you come to a place Amen that you all set oh praise God I'm in the message you just that one little notch from death hello you got to keep going like the like the Lutheran's became Methodists the Methodists became Pentecost Pentecost became the message and the message become who he himself you and I must become him manifested Christ in his people today Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever we are the fullness and the Bible said they cannot be complete without us we must but we must learn how to strip ourselves right you and I must alter we ought to be tired a man of trying to think in such a Pharisee way you're no better than the Baptist the method of the presbytery whatever they call themselves you know why we all say by grace I heard a brother say we're one family what happened to those disciples when they saw those people who were under John's ministry they went over them and says hey have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe oh they didn't say you weren't Christian oh you're not Christians no they didn't say that have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said we haven't heard whether there be a Holy Ghost then they say well what baptism you see what I'm saying bathing he Christianize him they took him where they were preached the word brought him up to today's date if they're real they come on if they're genuine they're come on if they're not neva perhaps that's what they were ordained for not on somebody see that's what keeps the house of God divided hello and Satan gonna do his job but Paul says you know you need to contend for the faith you fight you contend for the faith in the Corinthians say to the Ephesians you're not of the body and the Corinthians was a bad church they work on oh is that right Ephesians were like us you know we the message oh come on somebody but he fees you can say the term Corinthians you're not part of God or Christ because look how calling you is y'all going down on him y'all teaching the inclined why you didn't do your yes everybody wanna prophesy everybody want to preach y'all wanna ordain women preachers all that kind of stuff see but they were all part of Christ those who were baptized with the Holy Spirit who's somebody help me here I'm trying to trying to go fast but I want you to understand help help us Lord because before we came to this message where were we now did we become seen after we came to the message no we will recede before hallelujah hey man and because we will see God came to you that's the way it goes and how how God comes you know what God does when he comes to you you know what God when God came to Abraham guess what he did he jumped into a man walked in Abraham in a man that's how God comes in this day in a man chapel's when he was up here and you can even though a message church was here right God came to you in the man or was it the other way around hi everyone you had the books writer who had the books okay but the point is God use you both right though you willing the message already you didn't know so God knows what he's doing God uses us even when we don't even know God using us can I go on just give me a little bit more amen hallelujah now he said and we know that his testimony is to root without error without fault God's testimony it's true right and if God said he's gonna have a bride it is true there is a bride is that Alright amen you think about Amen when it comes to Amen to this church in itself and then here it was me and Keith connecting and his mother's hospital room hello a man all the way from Des Moines meeting the man from sorrow hi oh how did I get here it's just okay was it God it was all God hallelujah He is God he knew it before the foundation of the world he knew it was going to be even with his church was going to be packed with people they just don't come like they used to amen but still yet the gospel doesn't go out void hallelujah how are the world going to see Jesus if they don't see him in US my wife and I was just at our restaurant here and getting some food and and the lady made the wrong salad and and because my wife didn't want no blue cheese on her salad the lady lady come up who's making the salad just throwing things pop pop and I could see the devil he wanted us to respond to that reaction and my wife and I just stood still and we called each other thought I didn't say nothing she didn't either but we saw the devil and we didn't give him her flat he we didn't give the pleasure to the devil we kept quiet hmm and then the lady calm down you understand me we could have in the old day oh yeah but you see the Holy Spirit knows how to say shame the devil is this okay now when Jesus raised this is what I mean let me say like this as I said it this morning now god of the he's God of the universe I can't help but to think about how all of those stars out there operating staying in place nothing's fallen ain't no such thing as a falling star that's a media or something something I'm kind of wrong no star moves out of its place once that happens everything else moves it's like a magnet one pool the other hello oh you said brother coach I don't know that well let me ask you a question how come the moon has such a pool on your earth you don't even feel it I don't but the tidal wave those waves got water out there knows Amen when the moon is close and when it's far away hmm think about it and you look at your God as it is you know yes God is in the Sun but nobody ever asks the question what keeps the Sun burning at the same temperature it has always burned there's a power behind that and if you move that Sun that natural Sun out of this place guess what it's going to set all of us if it ever go black like the scientists say you and I will die and everything else that lives that's exactly what it is God if God was they ever go black dye you and I would die too he is the only existence you understand me and God cannot lie I'm so glad to be part of him don't you understand because of him I'm here because of him you were here don't you think you understand me he had moves he had stars he had all of these Archangels and angels and Seraphim and cherubim and then he thought about you not to be a self-image share them but he thought of you to be a son and daughter of God I want you with me not like I said the kingdom of God the kingdom of Helen amen is all the churches all the Christians all who claim to be Christian lodging in this big big tree called Christendom but the kingdom of God only Holy Ghost feel people entering there why because they're the only ones that goes into the city they're the only one that goes in the city they sit on his throne with him king and queen you mean to tell me when God was God all by himself I was somewhere in there you and I was in the existence wherever it came from however he came from you and I were there because one thing about eternal life is not created you know eyes can't even comprehend it how can we lose that's why Paul said all death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ oh that's why the devil don't want people to get the Holy Ghost he doesn't care about your religion he just don't want you to be really born again he doesn't want you to get the power from heaven because once God approves you all heaven and earth must obey you is that right your position in God is higher and greater than the Archangel whew one more thought is that all right as they're 45 5 through 7 says I am the Lord there is none else there is no God beside me i girded thee though thou has not known me that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the Lord and there is none else is that right hallelujah oh oh let me say it no matter what it is 1 1 you get to a man and a woman they married guess what happened they become one that's God's perfect plan right amen you know her son is the husband moon is the wife it's always been that way you understand me so therefore you Adam Adam there was only Eve that came out of Adam and that's the way he is ds2 or one that lets go beyond all of our faults all of our disappointments everything that we ever have done and God's grace and mercy stands with us hallelujah and in all of this God saves you why it wasn't your good deed it was what he thought of you from the beginning God didn't go shopping in a hobby to get you he with within himself you were in him you understand me I brother I wasn't you were in him you you weren't part of his leg you were there in the heart he went in the heart to get you you are god's heartbeat huh he could have gotten you up from up here but he didn't want you from up here cuz he was going to give you that anyway is that right the Bible said now we have the mind of Christ but the mind of Christ was never his head it was in his heart as the hard thinking she that's where the devil thought he was that's what a devil start was in his head hallelujah that's why he was able to get lifted up but in the heart is where the soul is that's the real you and when God marries you the wedding takes place in your heart not in your head you become one with God in your heart that's why that's why that's why I David I'm fitting clothes David said I'm not finished with this thought because this is so much more I wanted to say but David said as the heart panted for the water Brooke you know my soul thirsts for the Living God hallelujah and your soul is not in your head your soul occupies your heart hallelujah until a man thirst after God from the heart he won't get no way you're here to quit on you it will faint on you but when the heart thirst for something y'all know what I'm saying come on somebody you and I realize most of us know what it's like when we were sinners and we had evil things in our heart that we thirst for we would not stop - we would get it hello under what cost any calls y'all right like I don't know what I'm talking about but that kind of a thirst will blind you to reality all you can see is what you won't if we could just let God take that perverted way and change it around to everything that we want is God oh you'll be all right will help us Jesus help us Lord it is okay listen we have an assurance the Bible says are called the revelations 13 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world hmm so your name in my name was written in the book not just a book of life the Lamb's Book whoo the one that's covered by the blood huh the Lambs look like where God has given you his life and you have become a lamb man you know it's like this when you read about the Three Little Pigs you know you're gonna be reading about pigs a fox maybe in there every now and again but the main thought would be pigs and when it comes to the Lamb's Book of Life the main thought are Lambs ain't no goats in there he loved the Lord and we appreciate God I want you to under this these thoughts have cut me has a awaken me and kept me up for three nights three days in a row and I still can't get it like I saw it I can't seem to express it but I see God in a way that I've never seen him before you know I see God greater than the flesh of Jesus because Jesus the flesh had to rest y'all understand me so if you can see that then you can understand what God is trying to pour into you and I all that was in God he poured it into Christ all that was in Christ he's poured it into his church if we could see everything that means that I can't stay here there's a change going on in me I don't know what I'm changing into but I know at the end of the day I'll be just like him and I'm not gonna stop this change if I gotta be excommunicated eisah rejected you can look at me like I'm crazy losing my mind but I know what happen on the inside and this inside has a purpose God has a purpose for my life just like it has a purpose for yours don't stop it doesn't care doesn't matter if you're young or old God still using people he's still if he could just get one man or one woman in his hand guess what God can do exploits but most of the thing thing that I want more than anything it ain't all the signs and wonders let me be the one let me be the sign as they say let me be the billboard for Jesus Christ you love the Lord people I'm not crazy but I look all around and Christian oh I see every organization you know this and that I see the apostasy I've seen the way people have turned down Jesus and going everywhere every way but their own going in and in right in their own eyes but God said he never left himself without a witness hello he never left himself without a witness and I'm gonna tell you like this in closing before we go into communion it's a press this is not an easy way if you can imagine how difficult it must have been for your Lord and Savior to climb the hill of Gaga then you may have an ounce of understanding of what it is to press through this age understand this age has no light in it except for what the bride of Jesus Christ has have excuse me yeah see she's the only one and that life must shine it must reflect Christ hello remember the darkness is Egypt was so dark it could be felt and that's exactly where we are we're in an age where the darkness is so dark we could feel it less tan hallelujah lower that God I'll tell you what if I had up some musicians here I'll tell them to play me some dancing music I really can't help I tell you what where everybody else want to get to our formal coldly starchy I'm like I'm fired up Oh Lord I'm fired up amen yeah god is so good to us I don't deserve as goodness but I am surely grateful and thankful of it you love the Lord as we prepare when it comes sing with serving communion since for the toys here in spirit that raised Christ from the day [Music] let's go buddy [Music] and response prompted a that same spirit has raised funds from today we took we came in your mortal body dwells in you oh it will quicken your mortal body if that spirit it well genius Oh whoo you gotta let go and let God people you can't win the battle without prayer and prayer is not Lord give me that give me this prayer it's fellowship prayer is it's the greatest communion you can have with God we call this communion but this is just a minute type the real communion is when you get down on your knees and you talk to Jesus that's fellowship did you know that's why he died that's why this blood of Jesus Christ was shared for you and I for fellowship that's why the devil makes you tired makes you sick or causes something to distract you from prayer or fellowshipping think about it every time you think I'm gonna think about Jesus the phone rings something happens some child comes through the door something happens it's as if the devil no here your time when you're gonna do it sometime you like the prophet of God said when you're getting ready to pray don't say tell the kid I'm going to pray just go pray you get a jump on him as soon as you tell them what you're getting ready to do the devil sends his devils right the first things he come to your mind you know you are you joking but all that you've done today the way you've thought you know what I'm saying you you guilted this and you you think God gonna hear you hello yes not only that he's heard me before I asked him is that right the Bible said before you open your mouth to ask God has already heard he knows exactly what you're gonna pray and you know what sometimes when I get down and I don't I feel like no I don't even know what to pray for I say pray for me Lord is that Alright the Bible said when you don't know what to pray the Spirit of the Lord would then intercede for you I believe that I'll tell you what they say I like the about problems God said if I'm crazy just leave me like this I feel so much better this way my favorite place to go was to church it really is whether I'm preaching or whether I'm not it is the favorite my favorite place to be around the saints of God and to feel that presence you love the Lord 1st corinthians the 11th chapter would begin reading at the 23rd verse well I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and we and he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do and remembers of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as she drinking and remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the Lord wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come those of you are who are participating they come up let us pray father God as we come before you lord we break this bread in your honor we thank you for being so good to us Lord this bread is a representation of the body broken for our sins rules Lord for our iniquities and Lord this bought bread also is a portion of you Lord in symbol form to show us that we are all part of you as we partake of this bless all the participants Lord in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
