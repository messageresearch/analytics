[0:00] studying I thought okay we kind of went
[0:02] through the fifth and we'll be perhaps
[0:04] done in the sixth and um you know I'm
[0:08] thinking oh my uh but I got to study and
[0:12] I don't know how we're going to finish
[0:14] the fifth chapter but we'll try our best
[0:17] uh by the grace of God but um as we
[0:22] stand let us go uh to the fourth chapter
[0:27] of
[0:28] Ephesians the four chapter of
[0:31] Ephesians and we're going to read the
[0:34] 17th through the 24th
[0:38] verse this I say therefore and testify
[0:42] in the Lord that we henceforth walk not
[0:46] as other Gentiles walk in vanity of
[0:49] their mind having the understanding
[0:52] darkened being alienated from the life
[0:55] of God through the through the ignorance
[0:59] that is in them them because of
[1:01] blindness of their heart who being past
[1:04] feeling have have given themselves over
[1:08] to lasciviousness to work all
[1:11] uncleanness and with
[1:13] greediness but ye have not so learned
[1:17] Christ if so be that you have heard him
[1:21] and have been taught by him as the truth
[1:24] is in Jesus that you put off concerning
[1:28] the former conversation the old old man
[1:31] which is corrupt according to the
[1:33] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:37] spirit of your mind and that you put the
[1:40] new man which after God is created in
[1:44] righteousness and true Holiness that ye
[1:48] and that ye put on the new
[1:51] man which after God is created in
[1:54] righteousness and true Holiness one more
[1:57] scripture and I let you be seated first
[1:59] pet
[2:02] the fth
[2:07] chapter we'll read the 10th and the 11th
[2:12] verse of First
[2:17] Peter but the god of Grace who have
[2:20] called us into his eternal glory by
[2:24] Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered
[2:27] a while make you perfect establish
[2:31] strengthens settles you to him be glory
[2:34] and Dominion forever and ever amen let's
[2:38] pray father God we thank you for the
[2:40] reading of your word we thank you for
[2:42] the Bible study in which we're going to
[2:45] have Lord tonight in your honor I pray
[2:49] that you break the bread we have our
[2:51] notes Lord but we need your inspiration
[2:54] as well for certain to guide us in the
[2:58] correct revelation ation that you would
[3:00] have us to have and understand bless
[3:04] this group tonight bless those who are
[3:07] listening and we'll give you the glory
[3:09] honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name
[3:12] we pray amen you may be
[3:17] seated um my subject tonight even though
[3:20] we're going through Ephesians I'd like
[3:22] to just give you a thought the Overcomer
[3:26] must be
[3:27] focused the overcomer must be
[3:31] focused uh we know and I've said it many
[3:34] times since we started Ephesians brother
[3:36] vandom uh uh paralleled it to Joshua and
[3:42] Joshua was taking the children over uh
[3:46] from the
[3:47] Wilderness into the promised land to not
[3:52] only uh put them in a place of fighting
[3:56] because once you get into the Holy
[3:58] Spirit you you have to mature you're
[4:01] going to have to mature there's no way
[4:03] of getting around suffering and
[4:05] conflicts that's part of the journey uh
[4:09] but in so doing we know that the battle
[4:13] has been fought and the Victory have
[4:14] already been won you said well how do
[4:16] you say that brother
[4:18] because God told Joshua I have already
[4:22] given you the land so your Victory our
[4:25] victory tonight has already been given
[4:28] to us but but just like it was in the
[4:31] Book of Joshua you must stay under the
[4:35] leadership of Joshua in order to gain
[4:38] the Victory and you must stay under the
[4:40] leadership of the Holy Ghost in This Day
[4:44] to gain the victory is that right so
[4:47] understand that when you make a
[4:50] mistake uh God doesn't look at that in
[4:54] that sense but when you willfully do
[4:57] something there is a punishment
[5:00] there is a chastisement if you want to
[5:02] say it that way even as it was with
[5:05] Israel when they willfully disobeyed God
[5:08] God spanked them and as I said if it was
[5:12] just one person like aen how it caused
[5:16] many to die because of his erroring ways
[5:20] so staying focus is very important and
[5:23] the reason why I say this because
[5:25] Pentecostal Church as we know it today
[5:28] is not the Pentecost the church that
[5:31] started on theu Street those people were
[5:34] very sincere they were dedicated they
[5:36] saw the power of God move among them in
[5:38] such a way it was a ever everyday scene
[5:42] uh they they did all of the things that
[5:45] those who are pretending to be
[5:47] Pentecostals are doing but they had a
[5:50] life so much so uh their lives were a
[5:54] thunder to the devil and I believe with
[5:56] all of our heart today if we stand in
[6:00] sincerity and I was telling my family I
[6:02] think it was today or yesterday the only
[6:04] way you're going to remain sincere in
[6:06] God's way is to pray
[6:10] amen keeping in contact with God
[6:13] consecrating your life in God is the
[6:16] only way so let me move on as I said but
[6:21] but Pentecost what did they do they fail
[6:24] to remain
[6:25] focused and and whenever you allow Satan
[6:29] to misguide you in your
[6:31] mind then your heart is next if he can
[6:35] conquer you in your mind he has your
[6:37] heart as well and this is why the Bible
[6:40] said that we ought to put on the shield
[6:42] of Faith the helmet of salvation and I'm
[6:45] going to tell you what the helmet of
[6:47] salvation is knowing that you're saved
[6:49] by
[6:51] grace that is the buffler that is the
[6:53] thing that bounces the devil back back
[6:55] off of you no matter what you're going
[6:58] through
[6:59] Hallelujah so we realize amen that when
[7:02] we come through the
[7:04] scripture we realize amen through
[7:07] salvation we know that we're free and
[7:09] I've got a quote here but then we'll get
[7:11] right on into it by the grace of God
[7:13] coming from the message amen um that day
[7:17] of Calvary because what we forget we
[7:19] forget we're on a j Journey we're in a
[7:21] battle everybody want to shout everybody
[7:23] want to dance but nobody want to
[7:26] fight but you've got to fight and God
[7:29] don't want and can't use as the prophet
[7:31] said no coward
[7:33] soldiers that's right now starting at
[7:37] paragraph 80 he says now we say well I
[7:40] appreciate that that's very fine but
[7:43] we've got to accept it accept what he's
[7:46] talking about the grace of God and what
[7:47] Calvary did for you and to accept it is
[7:50] to accept his person Christ in our
[7:53] hearts now I'll say it like this they
[7:56] accepted the blood when they put it on
[7:58] the door Post in the little they had to
[8:00] continually accept that blood in order
[8:03] to cross over Jordan now they accepted
[8:06] it until they did what they became
[8:09] recircumcised and I believe with all of
[8:11] my heart this message is doing something
[8:14] even to me because I realize things now
[8:17] that I've not seen before in my life and
[8:20] that that's when it comes to the
[8:22] sincerity and becoming connected with
[8:25] God on a daily basis I mean really
[8:28] connected I don't mean you know just
[8:31] knocking on his door and somebody says
[8:34] who is it and you say oh it's me I'll
[8:37] see you tomorrow I just was checking in
[8:38] on you no there has to be
[8:42] Fellowship you you want to knock on his
[8:44] door or he knock let him knock on your
[8:46] door but you also want to let him come
[8:49] in right there is no private rooms in
[8:51] our house and so you want God to come in
[8:55] go from every room of your house to
[8:57] search it out to see what might be there
[9:00] that shouldn't be there um right so this
[9:04] is the thing is we are
[9:06] preparing uh and every battle becomes
[9:10] more difficult all right we started off
[9:13] with little battles but now we're having
[9:16] greater battles but the greater battles
[9:18] has been given to you because you become
[9:20] stronger you know you don't you don't
[9:23] fight battles that you used to fight
[9:25] when you was two years old you know what
[9:26] I'm saying you got to come up and fight
[9:29] the bigger battles because they you know
[9:31] you fight the Giants and all the other
[9:33] the other kind of things that are in the
[9:34] land he said then we are free from sin
[9:38] therefore there's no shackles hanging on
[9:41] us at all God just like we had never
[9:44] sinned the perfect sacrifice made us
[9:47] perfect for Jesus said be ye therefore
[9:50] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[9:52] perfect then there is no more to be done
[9:55] but we are made perfect in the presence
[9:57] of God and this is what must understand
[10:00] if we allow
[10:01] ourselves uh to be
[10:03] disconnected then that feeling of
[10:05] imperfection comes back to us when you
[10:08] look at yourself and you say Lord war is
[10:10] me look look at me you know what you see
[10:13] when you do that that shows that
[10:15] somewhere you've disconnected yourself
[10:17] with God because the Bible said in the
[10:20] presence of the Lord there's joy forever
[10:23] more and whenever we find ourselves
[10:25] disconnected then we see ourselves and
[10:28] not not the god that we're hiding behind
[10:31] amen
[10:32] right is that right being under the
[10:35] blood means that God is our shield and
[10:38] our buckler as the prophet of God said
[10:40] God don't even see us he hear our voice
[10:43] so we we but being disconnected make us
[10:48] see differently we begin to see
[10:51] ourselves in Earthly ways instead of in
[10:53] a Heavenly way all right this is why
[10:56] it's so important it's important because
[10:58] you would be depressed you wouldn't be
[11:01] you wouldn't feel alone now let me tell
[11:03] you this this is part of
[11:06] maturing right this is part of maturing
[11:08] you know it's like okay uh son I'm going
[11:11] to cut the light off but Mama I'm I'm
[11:14] afraid of the dark well you don't say
[11:16] that when you're 12 13 14 15 years old I
[11:19] mean you might say it when you're a
[11:20] little toddler because you don't
[11:22] understand you have the power of that
[11:24] darkness and you know where the light
[11:25] switch
[11:26] is right so when it comes to to our
[11:30] maturing we also become matured in the
[11:33] place where we're not afraid of the dark
[11:36] right what light is afraid of the
[11:39] dark right so we we're not afraid we
[11:42] know where we going if we should die now
[11:45] we know where we're going right God just
[11:48] like we had never sinned the perfect
[11:51] sacrifice was made us made us perfect
[11:54] and you've got to believe that I'm
[11:56] saying that on myself you've got to
[11:58] believe that the sacrifice that you have
[12:00] have has made you perfect now we're
[12:03] going through a
[12:05] journey right we're
[12:07] maturing and God knows exactly how how
[12:10] could I put it this way God knows
[12:12] exactly how old you're going to become
[12:14] before he takes you amen and he knows
[12:16] the time when he finish with you amen
[12:20] right but the Bible says also that we
[12:23] supposed to consider the end of our
[12:25] faith a lot of time we look in the
[12:27] middle of it and we think how can I make
[12:30] it when the Bible said you've already
[12:32] make it made it when you're now sitting
[12:35] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus these
[12:37] things are mature these are for uh the
[12:40] statements I'm making now are for mature
[12:44] Christians right then we're no more to
[12:46] be done see there's nothing else to be
[12:48] done but we are made perfect in the
[12:50] presence of God now there's where we
[12:53] lose our position if we don't watch we
[12:56] try to look back to what we was and as
[13:00] long as long as we look back to what we
[13:03] was the sacrifice means nothing to us
[13:06] see see the danger of looking back oh I
[13:09] used to be this I used to be that and oh
[13:12] and and the devil make you think you're
[13:13] the same person when God has changed you
[13:17] and then when you look back you just
[13:19] annulling your whole sacrifice as if
[13:22] Christ has done nothing for you you
[13:25] can't do that you can't allow Satan to
[13:28] make you believe you you the same person
[13:31] is telling God that he's not strong
[13:33] enough or his grace is not
[13:36] sufficient right so now there where we
[13:39] lose our positions we don't watch We're
[13:41] try to look back to where we was right I
[13:44] read that see the sacrifice mean nothing
[13:47] to us oh can't you see it church I would
[13:50] not try try the job I can't neither can
[13:54] you there's no need of trying you lost
[13:58] to begin with and as long as you look to
[14:00] what you've done but don't look to what
[14:02] you've
[14:05] done right as long as you look to what
[14:08] you've done but don't look to what
[14:11] you've
[14:12] done do y'all understand what he saying
[14:14] by your giving yourself to God you've
[14:17] done something you brought a change in
[14:19] your life don't mean I I thought to
[14:22] myself how many real Christians there
[14:25] are in this world small or lot we've got
[14:28] plenty of denominational we got plenty
[14:31] of so-call and confessed Christians but
[14:33] Christians are more than what we call
[14:35] church
[14:37] people right look what the day of
[14:39] Calvary did to you it paid your price it
[14:42] settles the question your sins be as
[14:45] Scarlet they're as white as snow red
[14:48] like Crimson white like wool whose
[14:50] mirror are you looking into right no
[14:54] matter what you've done or what you do
[14:56] you still sinless amen as long as you
[15:00] accept Jesus Christ as your savior your
[15:04] sins are forgiven Anything Is Forgiven
[15:08] is emitted and forgotten about we're the
[15:11] only ones that remember God don't
[15:14] remember and then we beat our
[15:17] heads in the wall Satan takes up stuff
[15:20] that you done confess for years ago and
[15:23] bring it back to you and you AC that
[15:26] nasty stuff amen and God is
[15:29] I would say God is scratching his head
[15:30] but he's not but you're actually uh
[15:33] telling God about something that he's
[15:35] actually forgotten
[15:37] amen that's you see now listen the 8
[15:43] 85th verse now the first thing I want to
[15:45] say and and I'm saying all of this
[15:48] because this ought to motivate us to
[15:52] want to die and rot to our own
[15:57] ourselves so that he would be reflected
[16:00] through US amen right because eternal
[16:03] life and I'm going to say this more than
[16:05] once tonight it's not living for you is
[16:08] living for
[16:10] others right you say you're a Christian
[16:13] but you got to realize if you are a
[16:15] Christian you must be like Christ and
[16:19] Christ came to live for who not himself
[16:22] for
[16:23] others he went hungry for others amen
[16:27] many times I'm sure he want wanted him
[16:29] his space but he couldn't have his space
[16:31] cuz his disciples was all around him he
[16:34] was tired he was
[16:37] weary right but you
[16:41] see by the grace of
[16:45] God I think that's all the water but by
[16:49] the grace of God he
[16:51] um he was able Amen to die to himself
[16:57] and there were times when God would give
[16:59] him the space to himself when it was
[17:02] needed but sometimes we do things with
[17:05] that when it's not needed amen I'm
[17:07] guilty I'm guilty now the first thing I
[17:10] want you to say is Jesus never lived for
[17:13] himself his life was spent for others
[17:17] that's PR perfectly eternal life when
[17:20] you say you go to church and you do good
[17:23] things thank you sir thank you and you
[17:27] do good things that's f
[17:30] but when you live for your your life to
[17:32] yourself you hav't eternal life eternal
[17:36] life is living for others it proves it
[17:39] when it comes to the Lamb of God he
[17:42] lived and had eternal life because he
[17:44] did not live for himself he lived for
[17:47] others and you you receive eternal life
[17:51] by receiving that day and you you don't
[17:54] live for yourself no more you live for
[17:57] others Jes some someone
[18:02] said how can you stand let everybody
[18:06] call you such bad names you don't live
[18:09] for yourself you live for others that
[18:13] you might redeem that man you become
[18:16] sons and the trouble of it is the church
[18:20] has forgotten they were Sons you're Sons
[18:24] you're taking Christ's place you're a
[18:27] son so don't live for yourself live for
[18:33] others that's the church and that that's
[18:36] you say oh I can do that you can let me
[18:40] tell you something it takes the Holy
[18:42] Ghost to do that Christ must be in you
[18:47] amen right it takes the selfishness away
[18:51] Ephesians please Ephesians
[18:54] 5 1 through 3
[19:01] I'm
[19:03] jumping see you must move you must move
[19:06] I must move we must move away from the
[19:09] works of the flesh Ephesians 5 1
[19:14] to3 be ye therefore followers of God as
[19:19] dear children and walk in love as Christ
[19:23] also have loved us and have given
[19:26] himself for us and an offering and a
[19:30] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[19:33] savior but fornication and all
[19:37] uncleanliness or
[19:38] covetousness let it be not once name
[19:42] upon you among you as becometh Saints so
[19:46] you got to see that when you when you
[19:48] accepted your sacrifice you don't just
[19:51] remain Justified there's something in
[19:53] you that wants to be Sanctified and
[19:56] remember I said in the last lesson true
[19:58] sanctification is when God has taken all
[20:01] the evil desire out of you to do
[20:06] evil I'm waiting on the
[20:11] amen so once that desire to do evil is
[20:16] taken away then God can fill you and
[20:21] seal you with these
[20:23] virtues the cup must be cleansed and
[20:27] understand that many of the times that
[20:29] these desires are taken away by the
[20:32] trials you go
[20:34] through okay Ephesians
[20:37] 51 through
[20:39] 12 and have no fellowship with the
[20:43] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[20:47] reprove them now what do you mean by
[20:48] that correct
[20:50] them reveal it revealed to the you know
[20:54] you find people in the church they hang
[20:56] with people that's doing bad and they
[20:59] well I'm not doing bad but you are
[21:02] because you hanging with the people that
[21:04] are and you won't expose them you won't
[21:06] correct them because you feel you're
[21:08] going to be
[21:10] rejected and you fail you fail to see
[21:12] that when you do that you going to be
[21:15] rejected but you're going to be rejected
[21:17] by the main one I'd rather be rejected
[21:20] by my
[21:21] friends than
[21:24] Goden yeah let them call me a holy rooll
[21:27] oh you think you great you think you and
[21:29] all you got to do is listen to them and
[21:31] they give you praise you think you
[21:34] better than
[21:35] us did I say or did you say that that's
[21:39] right right don't have fell you see the
[21:43] thing is it's not that you hating
[21:44] anybody you can't
[21:46] hate you got to love everybody but you
[21:50] got to hate their sin you got to hate
[21:52] their actions for it is a shame even to
[21:56] speak of those things which are done of
[21:58] them in
[22:00] secret God have mercy on
[22:03] us because of the world teaches us to
[22:06] talk about the things done in
[22:09] secret they love it gossip whatever you
[22:12] want to call it amen and and and and
[22:14] they train us to do it if we look at
[22:17] stuff that we shouldn't be looking at
[22:20] right so your mind must be kept pure and
[22:23] clean how you going to do that you must
[22:26] have a word here and a word word here to
[22:29] keep your mind clean Satan is going to
[22:32] going to battle your mind and the whole
[22:35] point about it is he's trying to stop
[22:38] your growth in
[22:41] Christ but he
[22:43] cannot amen the true seed of God will
[22:47] God will not allow to be deformed that's
[22:49] right we are here Amen to
[22:52] learn what we should be doing because I
[22:55] have been a Christian since
[22:59] high school
[23:01] days and I'm learning things that I'm
[23:04] not or I'm seeing things I've read the
[23:07] same scriptures but now I'm seeing
[23:09] things that oh my i' I've been negligent
[23:13] on this end and I've been negligent on
[23:14] that end and really you know what it's
[23:16] been all all about my
[23:19] pride not wanting to be rejected by
[23:27] others birds of a feather flock together
[23:31] and that's the
[23:32] truth for Years anyway we won't go there
[23:36] that would have been like a testimony
[23:37] but then I saw at the end of the day how
[23:40] these two people came together agreed
[23:42] and believed the same thing when I
[23:44] couldn't figure it out for years but at
[23:46] the end of the day these same two
[23:49] ministers walked away from the message
[23:51] then I understood birds of a feather
[23:55] flock
[23:56] together right so Ephesians 5:1
[24:01] 19-33 right speaking to yourselves in
[24:06] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[24:10] singing and making melody in your heart
[24:14] to the Lord giving thanks always for all
[24:19] things unto God and the father in the
[24:22] name of our Lord Jesus
[24:26] Christ and we must understand and this
[24:29] is how we keep ourselves amen all
[24:32] right when when Satan comes in like a
[24:36] flood the spirit of the Lord will lift
[24:38] up a standard you must have something as
[24:41] a wall of
[24:44] Defense excuse
[24:51] me and sometimes all you have is
[24:54] yourself and I don't know about you but
[24:57] there have been times I have been going
[24:59] through a storm or getting ready to
[25:01] embrace a storm or whatever the case may
[25:03] be and then all of a sudden a hym or
[25:05] something comes amen a song will come I
[25:08] could hear it amen and you know who's
[25:11] singing it where is it coming from
[25:14] surely the devil is not comforting me
[25:17] amen but you got to realize that your
[25:20] life is in God's hands it's a matter of
[25:22] life and death the thing that gets me is
[25:25] that who's ready and the Bible said the
[25:28] ride maketh herself ready that's right I
[25:31] don't care if I'm exposed by the word I
[25:34] just want the word to change me amen
[25:37] that's all I want I admit my aing WS I
[25:41] admit my faults and I know true that at
[25:45] all of my airing ways I have never been
[25:48] able to deliver myself amen it has
[25:52] always been the word but you see the
[25:55] truth of the matter is I've always been
[25:57] able to Humble by his grace I know where
[26:00] to go I look toward the heal for whence
[26:03] cometh my help and my Help Cometh From
[26:06] The Lord the Lord who is the maker of
[26:09] heaven and Earth so what is my problem
[26:13] the Bible said that the name of the Lord
[26:14] is a strong tower and the righteous run
[26:17] in and they are
[26:21] safe what if I appear righteous before
[26:24] you but then my heart is not
[26:28] then my life is in
[26:31] vain but I have to recognize that God
[26:34] did not call me on this Earth to be a
[26:37] message
[26:38] believer am cuz Satan is a message
[26:41] believer amen that's right I have come
[26:44] to live it amen and so have you and the
[26:48] only way you're going to be able is that
[26:50] the God who spoke that word lives in you
[26:54] amen
[26:55] right we've got all things to die out
[26:58] die out die out right staying in harmony
[27:02] with one another keeping the unity of
[27:06] the spirit in the bond of peace let me
[27:09] ask you a question when has the last you
[27:11] witnessed to someone right this is not
[27:14] this message wasn't given to us to keep
[27:17] to us amen go you out into all the world
[27:20] that commission has never changed amen
[27:25] and he didn't say tell the people who
[27:27] you feel like is going to receive
[27:28] receive you he says no to all the world
[27:31] you're going to be rejected you're going
[27:33] to be
[27:34] despised people going to hate you but he
[27:36] said don't be alarmed about that they
[27:38] did it in the green they'll do it in the
[27:40] dry amen but you know what the problem
[27:43] is when we come to a place where we're
[27:45] afraid to tell the Gospel of Jesus
[27:48] Christ we have moved from out of the
[27:51] presence of God because I'm going to
[27:54] tell you even in times of persecution
[27:57] when those disciples and people
[27:59] throughout the fox's book of mar were
[28:02] being and ready to be killed they still
[28:04] confessed Jesus and many of them in
[28:07] their deaths won people to the Lord amen
[28:11] by their confession
[28:13] amen you said well that was there well
[28:16] we supposed to be us amen we supposed to
[28:19] have that Zeal and that stamina too amen
[28:22] but all of that comes with what l o v
[28:27] loving
[28:29] God Ephesians 4
[28:32] 3-7 I know I'm kind of moving around but
[28:36] we we getting ready to I got to move
[28:38] Endeavor endeavoring to keep the unity
[28:42] beginning at the third
[28:44] verse endeavoring to keep the unity of
[28:47] the spirit in the bond of peace that
[28:49] mean you got to work at it amen it
[28:52] doesn't come easily and how many times
[28:55] things come through this little assimile
[28:57] trying to bust it up break it up and
[29:00] people get so mad they don't even
[29:02] they'll get over it no they won't get
[29:05] over it and the Bible said even if you
[29:07] think a man has an art against you you
[29:09] go to him well I don't want to hurt
[29:11] their feeling well who else's feelings
[29:12] you hurting God want to see obedience
[29:16] that's right and obedience is better
[29:17] than sacrifice amen that's the trth and
[29:20] we do it and the more we do it the
[29:23] more the you know how anyway that the
[29:26] fire the the the the the devil fan the
[29:29] fire and often times because of people
[29:32] not falling in position and doing what
[29:35] they supposed to do it leads to Pastor
[29:38] when by the time he catch wind of the
[29:40] fire the fire is so gross and so big
[29:42] it's a mess
[29:44] amen and they'll look at him and say you
[29:46] put it
[29:48] out no no no if you read the scripture
[29:52] David's Army the one whom they converted
[29:56] Saul's Army into David's Army that's in
[30:00] Chronicles they kept in Step nobody got
[30:04] out of order amen they were one body and
[30:08] let me tell you something that's that's
[30:10] even in the natural you see those
[30:12] Russian soldiers when they marching with
[30:14] those Goose goose steps men they look
[30:17] Fierce and and they they they
[30:19] intimidates you and that's how it is
[30:22] when the army of God gets together on
[30:24] one Accord all hell shakes
[30:29] amen and that's why he keeps us the way
[30:31] it is because he knows if no house A
[30:34] House Divided can't stand and that's
[30:36] what I'm trying to tell the people you
[30:38] people I say it like this those of you
[30:40] who come to Bible studies those who come
[30:42] to prayer those few that comes on you
[30:44] know Wednesday night or whatever the
[30:46] case may
[30:48] be pull together amen y'all understand
[30:52] what I'm saying if nobody else do do it
[30:55] you do
[30:56] it and God don't need a many he said two
[31:00] or three amen and if we could just we
[31:03] will be a army that Satan will not be
[31:06] able to
[31:08] stop but will'll be bond together by
[31:11] what
[31:13] love and when you bond together about
[31:15] love with love there's no space for
[31:17] jealousy in The
[31:20] Strife endeavoring to keep the unity of
[31:23] the spirit in the bond of Peace there is
[31:26] one body one spirit even as you are
[31:28] called into one hope of your calling one
[31:32] Lord One Faith one baptism one
[31:36] family one family amen right now Earthly
[31:42] families they don't all get along
[31:44] together but they stay
[31:47] together but you find out the spiritual
[31:50] families they have the least little
[31:52] thing and everybody want to spit up and
[31:53] go their ways amen can't be God that's
[31:57] right not doing that one Lord One Faith
[32:00] one baptism one God and the father of
[32:03] all who is above all and through all and
[32:07] in you all well I ain't got nothing in
[32:11] common yes you do you got the greatest
[32:14] thing in common if you got it and that
[32:16] is the Holy
[32:19] Ghost you find a person oh well I can't
[32:22] just talk with you because all you're
[32:23] going to talk about is scripture didn't
[32:25] tell him go talk to his daddy that's
[32:27] right
[32:31] well that's what Joseph said to Billy
[32:34] Paul D that's all you talk about the
[32:36] Bible all the time what else I'm going
[32:38] to talk about amen now that's the best
[32:41] thing to do cuz if you don't you're
[32:42] going to end up talking about something
[32:47] else but unto every one of us is given
[32:50] Grace according to the measure uh of the
[32:54] gift of Christ so therefore what some
[32:57] people gets more grace than other that's
[32:59] right should I be jealous no I'm glad
[33:02] you got
[33:04] it right and and we need to understand
[33:08] that when Jesus is the
[33:10] judge there is no accusers
[33:15] amen remember the
[33:18] woman and he said woman where are your
[33:20] accusers that's right you know why
[33:23] because he knew all of them were guilty
[33:26] of sin amen and now one church member in
[33:29] here has a right to point someone else
[33:33] out because we are all sinners saved by
[33:37] grace if we could see that we can have a
[33:41] fellowship with one another better than
[33:43] what we have now now I'm saying all
[33:46] these things because I'm working with
[33:47] maturity I'm working with people who are
[33:49] ready to mature and recognize that so
[33:52] many things we have handled in our lives
[33:55] like
[33:56] children and now it's time to grow up
[34:00] amen it's time to grow
[34:04] up right now the thing about it is most
[34:07] of us we don't want to
[34:09] be we don't want to be
[34:11] submissive you know everybody got to
[34:13] have their own
[34:16] little you know well people well I'm
[34:20] Alpha I'm an
[34:22] alpha I'm a leader but the leaders got
[34:25] to submit too amen Jared said to Jesus
[34:29] Lord I'm a
[34:31] ruler I know what it is to say to a man
[34:34] do this and do that but Lord amen that's
[34:38] true righten so you got to submit to
[34:41] somebody and the best place to submit is
[34:44] to God and when you submit to God you
[34:47] submit to God's people come on somebody
[34:50] it's the truth
[34:52] submission is the action of or fact of
[34:56] accepting or yielding to a superior
[34:59] force and to the will or authority of
[35:02] another person that's why Jesus said
[35:04] Lord not my will but thine be
[35:08] done right Christ the man Jesus Christ
[35:13] the man had an authority that was above
[35:16] his and that was a word and he submitted
[35:19] to the word and because of his
[35:22] submission we are
[35:25] enjoying life as it is now
[35:28] but most people don't understand
[35:29] submission and I'm coming to something
[35:31] in just a moment we think oh you can't
[35:34] tell me that and you know I look at
[35:36] people and I said you know one of the
[35:37] things that I find out you know when you
[35:40] call yourself brother Brooks so many
[35:42] people take advantage of you they don't
[35:45] know how to submit to brother but if I
[35:47] call myself Pastor oh Pastor you know
[35:51] what's the difference
[35:54] amen a name or the office that that
[35:57] people need to learn how to
[35:59] recognize you can't talk to a pastor or
[36:02] your the man that leads you any kind of
[36:04] way like he's just a t but we do
[36:08] it and when we disrespect the man of God
[36:12] you disrespecting
[36:15] God and we don't learn how to submit to
[36:17] the pastor you'll never learn how to
[36:19] submit to
[36:20] God people don't understand what
[36:22] submitting is because we we we don't we
[36:25] fail to see that these two are connected
[36:28] as we all are but we work together not
[36:33] separately you know
[36:38] um
[36:40] Jesus was such friends with his
[36:44] disciples to even Peter thought he could
[36:47] just voice his
[36:49] opinion and felt like it was
[36:52] okay right cuz when Jesus was telling
[36:55] him I'm got to die sometime that's right
[36:58] and Peter rebuked Jesus and says no that
[37:01] ain't going to happen and Jesus
[37:04] immediately saw it was the devil you
[37:08] understand me cuz really when the word
[37:10] is given you don't challenge it by your
[37:12] own thoughts and feelings you say Amen
[37:16] yes Lord right because when they did
[37:19] when he did that he said get thee behind
[37:21] me Satan now he wasn't calling Peter
[37:24] Satan but he looked beyond the man he
[37:26] didn't see he you know he saw the spirit
[37:29] because that Spirit was uh going against
[37:32] the word any spirit that goes against
[37:35] the word is the devil amen see see it is
[37:39] not now understanding submission it is
[37:43] not a sign of weakness because that's
[37:45] what people say he's just
[37:47] weak even if a pastor does it the way
[37:50] God wants him to do it oh he's just
[37:53] weak or a brother or a sister oh he or
[37:56] she is weak
[37:58] it is not a sign of weakness but a
[38:01] demonstration of trust and
[38:05] obedience in the Christian context
[38:08] submission primarily involves submitting
[38:11] to God's Will and Authority as well as
[38:16] humbly relating to others in various
[38:19] roles and
[38:21] relationships as we submit ourselves to
[38:24] God we submit
[38:26] ourselves to are Brothers and Sisters in
[38:29] Christ let me tell you something if the
[38:32] police stop you you better submit am and
[38:37] if you don't he'll make you
[38:40] submit but it's amazing the police don't
[38:43] have no no problem with most people they
[38:46] see that light coming they already
[38:48] praying and they already humbled
[38:51] amen because they know that if he's he's
[38:54] he's the authoritative figure he can
[38:57] bring
[38:58] judgment but if you give a soft answer
[39:01] in a spirit of
[39:03] Wrath it'll shut the devil down it
[39:07] confuses the devil when somebody screams
[39:10] and holler at you and you say now you
[39:12] know you shouldn't have said that in a
[39:15] sweet SP oh come on somebody but if you
[39:17] screaming holler you got it
[39:21] on that's right that's the way it works
[39:23] I've seen it work so many times in my
[39:25] life I'm working with with this now
[39:28] Romans 1210 to18 I know I'm moving fast
[39:32] I told you I ran into some things that
[39:34] really just enlighten me uh because I
[39:39] I'm changing amen and I'm happy to be
[39:42] that
[39:43] way um and I know the changes that are
[39:47] that's happening in me it it has a lot
[39:50] to do with the uh translation that we're
[39:53] getting ready to bark Embark upon you
[39:56] know it's amazing
[39:58] you see people and you know oh I'm
[40:01] trying to you know when a person say I'm
[40:02] trying to get closer to God all you got
[40:05] to do is watch
[40:07] them their actions will tell you what's
[40:09] really happening with
[40:12] them and to resist the word and do just
[40:17] what you want to do it shows you're not
[40:18] trying to get closer to God that's
[40:21] right even in a time of spanking you
[40:24] know what children do they grab and hug
[40:27] that their
[40:29] parents because they don't want that
[40:31] disconnection they know they've done
[40:32] something wrong but they want to be
[40:34] always feel connected that's how it is
[40:37] with those who are really born again and
[40:39] born of God even when God spanks us we
[40:43] want to be a closer walk with him Romans
[40:46] 12
[40:49] 10-18 haven't even got to my full
[40:52] scripture here be kindly affectionate
[40:55] one to another with Brotherly Love in
[40:58] honor preferring one woo preferring one
[41:03] another that's right woo preferring one
[41:07] another kindly
[41:10] affectionate God help us all we need a l
[41:13] lot more of
[41:20] that be
[41:22] kindly
[41:24] affectionate one toward another with
[41:26] brother kind of no man don't give me no
[41:34] h yeah y'all know how y'all do and the
[41:38] brother just being kindly
[41:40] affectionate and then y'all you don't
[41:43] want it but that's what the word say be
[41:46] kindly you how you going to be
[41:47] affectionate
[41:51] oh affection is feeling is touch amen
[41:56] right
[41:58] and it's so amazing what our touch will
[42:02] do be kindly affectionate one toward
[42:05] another with brotherly love and honor
[42:07] preferring one another so you got to
[42:10] understand that there's a lot of stuff
[42:12] that needs to die and Rod what do we
[42:17] fear and I think many times we afraid of
[42:21] affection because we fear something
[42:23] within us and if that be true that needs
[42:26] to go amen God can't work with you in
[42:35] fear I mean I there have been years ago
[42:38] I you know you try to pull a brother to
[42:40] hug him and you you almost in an arm
[42:45] wrestle have anybody know what I'm
[42:47] talking about yeah you like oh okay then
[42:53] now the next time you come you going to
[42:55] do the same thing see what the devil
[42:58] does he breaks the word that's right
[43:01] when somebody do that to you next time
[43:02] you say you need to R read Romans
[43:06] 1210 see that I'm in the word and you're
[43:10] not not slothful in business fervent in
[43:14] spirit serving the
[43:16] lord am
[43:19] amen
[43:20] right rejoicing in Hope patient in
[43:24] Tribulation continually instant in
[43:27] prayer amen I could remember the first
[43:30] time a brother kissed me
[43:33] woo on the cheek
[43:40] okay it shook
[43:42] me and you know what I did I looked
[43:45] around to see who
[43:48] saw I didn't know how to
[43:50] respond and you know but but when you
[43:53] know a brother is
[43:54] spiritual and for some reason and God
[43:57] made him do that you move on with it now
[44:00] you may never instigate
[44:03] that but you got to receive it amen
[44:07] because he just do you know how
[44:09] difficult for a man to do that or even a
[44:11] sister with a sister now yeah we don't
[44:15] mix it like that but but you know people
[44:18] I've seen people I've seen sisters kiss
[44:20] each other on the JW and I've seen the
[44:22] sister do this
[44:29] but you see that's wrong we need to
[44:33] mature I'm just moving on I ain't going
[44:35] to work with those things but those are
[44:36] little things but it's always the little
[44:39] things that spoil the line because you
[44:41] never know down the road Satan might do
[44:43] something with you and then you realize
[44:45] well that brother loved me
[44:48] amen not SLO in business fervent in
[44:51] spirit serving the lord rejoicing in
[44:54] hope hope for people patient and
[44:57] tribulation
[44:58] patience continuing instant in prayer oh

[45:13] the curtain and make sure that person is
[45:14] someone that you want at the
[45:18] house y'all say y'all don't do it what
[45:20] you do every time you screen your phone
[45:23] to see whether you want to talk with
[45:24] that person or not it's like opening the
[45:26] curtain Cur or looking out the curtain

[45:31] thing when you don't even know that that
[45:33] person might need your help or need your

[45:57] not
[45:58] God that must die that's M must rot and
[46:03] we have all had some kind of inspiration
[46:06] like that I have had it but I've always
[46:10] learned how to pray through
[46:12] it bless and curse not rejoice with them
[46:16] that do rejoice and weep with them that
[46:19] weep wait a minute now I'm talking about
[46:21] maturing we're talking about
[46:25] kids that that actually can go back
[46:29] years and say remember when you did that
[46:31] to
[46:32] me we got people who say they're in the
[46:35] message still holding
[46:37] grudges from people years ago and they
[46:41] think they're going to make a Rapture
[46:42] a't that something no you
[46:45] won't I'm here to tell
[46:48] you you won't because the word of God
[46:50] has come to you and when the word come
[46:53] to you light has been given to you if
[46:55] you were ignorant and didn't know but if
[46:57] you got the Holy Ghost there's no way
[46:59] you can't know cuz the Bible said that
[47:01] Holy Spirit will lead you and guide you
[47:03] into all truth always remember this if
[47:06] you can't remember on any other
[47:07] scripture only the pure in heart shall
[47:10] see God Amen keep your hearts pure bless
[47:14] them which persecute you bless and curse
[47:18] not you said well I don't curse them yes
[47:20] you do when you say oh you going to reap
[47:24] what you sold
[47:27] that's right you just cursed him you
[47:30] just cursed
[47:32] her right because if they just sold evil
[47:35] you just said you going to sow evil too
[47:37] that ain't our job to do that God will
[47:41] work with that
[47:42] accordingly right but it's our job to
[47:45] bless
[47:46] him you said well what do you mean
[47:48] Stephen what are you doing Lord hold not
[47:51] these things to their
[47:53] charge what did he do he blessed them
[47:58] because he understood it was the devil
[48:00] doing it if he had cursed that group of
[48:03] people do you know Paul would have been
[48:07] cursed you love the Lord let me move on
[48:10] I know I'm moving not as fast as I
[48:13] thought I would be you can you can give
[48:15] me 10 more minutes 20 minutes Rejoice
[48:18] with them that do Rejoice weep with them
[48:21] that we weep be of the same mind one
[48:24] toward another mind not hard things but
[48:27] condens in to them of lowest State be
[48:30] not wise in your own conceit and that's
[48:33] how it is some people even in this
[48:34] church won't even fellowship with
[48:36] somebody who's got less than they
[48:40] recompense to no man evil what for evil
[48:42] oh you did that you going nah that's
[48:46] immaturity provide things honest in the
[48:49] sight of all men if it be possible as
[48:52] much as lith in you live peaceably with
[48:56] all
[48:56] [Music]
[49:01] men you love the
[49:08] Lord let's move
[49:14] on let's move to the 21st chapter I mean
[49:19] 21st verse I think that's the fifth
[49:21] chapter I'm looking
[49:23] at we're talking about submitting yes
[49:26] 21st chapter the 5ifth verse so we'll
[49:29] get through that
[49:36] quickly are you being blessed any
[49:38] questions any questions remember the
[49:41] house of God is the place of judgment
[49:43] the word didn't come to make us feel
[49:45] good it came to cleanse us amen it
[49:47] didn't come to condemn you right because
[49:50] the Bible says there is no condemnation
[49:53] to those who are in Christ that's right
[49:55] but it did come to convict us to pull
[49:59] out those things in our lives that we
[50:01] that is wrong that we may
[50:04] repent and we may make right before God
[50:07] right because in the eyes of God you
[50:10] stand perfect amen that's right but in
[50:13] this life he wants you to prosper even
[50:17] as your soul Prosper so if we can see
[50:20] our soul prospering all of the other
[50:22] things will come with
[50:24] that submission
[50:27] and that's what I find out that that uh
[50:29] a lot of times as I said earlier people
[50:32] just don't know how to submit headstrong
[50:36] and stubborn and all of these things are
[50:39] not of God it they all must die you are
[50:43] a lamb not a
[50:46] goat but you got to be willing right
[50:49] it's all a will whosoever will let him
[50:52] come you got to be willing to die
[50:55] willing to rot
[50:57] willing and I know I know I know it
[51:00] hurts it hurts me sometimes when I see
[51:03] people despitefully using me
[51:05] disrespecting me all of the things that
[51:08] comes with the flesh amen and you know
[51:11] when I judge I said Lord God I'm I got
[51:16] too much life everything about this must
[51:20] die am because once you a dead man
[51:24] nothing anybody else do nothing anybody
[51:27] else would say or anything would move
[51:30] you cuz you're dead amen and that's the
[51:33] way I want to be dead to God to to the
[51:37] to the things my flesh myself that's
[51:40] right so dead that no matter what people
[51:42] do they said brother crazy let him do
[51:45] this he let him do that and the whole
[51:47] time I'm having joy in the
[51:51] Lord because I realized the man I used
[51:54] to be is no more thank God
[51:57] submit yourselves one to another in the
[52:00] what fear of God in that reverence wives
[52:05] submit yourselves unto your hus your own
[52:07] husbands as unto the
[52:10] Lord don't don't don't think I'm going
[52:13] to stop there on the
[52:14] wives but I do want you to know that is
[52:17] the will of God Amen as unto the Lord
[52:21] that means as long as he's telling you
[52:23] the things to do according to the Lord
[52:25] and the word
[52:27] you are to submit to it when he gets
[52:29] into his own little realm of thinking
[52:32] and telling you stuff that ain't
[52:33] supposed to no you don't have to do that
[52:36] everything according to the word amen
[52:39] yeah he can't stop you from going to
[52:41] church he can't stop you from praying he
[52:43] can't stop you from doing nothing cuz
[52:46] God always come first amen right so when
[52:50] he tried to make you serve him above God
[52:54] then he's foolish that's right that
[52:56] won't work you got to serve God then
[52:59] your husband right wives submit
[53:02] yourselves unto your own husband as unto
[53:05] the Lord for the husband is the head of
[53:07] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[53:09] the church and he is the savior of the
[53:11] body now remember these are talk he's
[53:14] talking to people who are married in the
[53:16] church you're not talking about a
[53:18] Believer and a non-believer that's two
[53:20] different cases here that's right
[53:23] right but remember the Bible says that
[53:25] you can save your unbelieving spouse by
[53:29] the life you live amen that will cause
[53:33] them to repent if there to be if they're
[53:35] savable now if they're savable you won't
[53:38] know that if you don't live it before
[53:42] him the husband is the head of the wife
[53:44] even as Christ is the head of the church
[53:46] and he is the savior of the body
[53:49] therefore as the church is subject unto
[53:52] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[53:55] husbands in
[54:02] everything y'all know how is
[54:05] sisters I ain't number two in here but
[54:11] still when we took that Veil
[54:15] off we were saying that the Man became
[54:17] our
[54:19] head woo right and people say well I'm
[54:24] the neck I can make the head turn
[54:30] see that ain't
[54:32] scriptural even though they
[54:35] do but my point is this you you've got
[54:39] to learn and and this is not easy
[54:42] because we're living in a Time the
[54:45] anointing is on the women to be the boss
[54:49] that's right to be the one that control
[54:51] you're living in latery this is a
[54:53] woman's age
[54:56] woman this woman that woman that and
[54:58] woman live what you've been liberated
[55:02] from is the word of God you don't want
[55:05] to be liberated from the word you want
[55:07] to be brought to the word stay under the
[55:10] headship of the word but all the
[55:13] Liberals now are free of the word so
[55:16] they can Bob their hair they can wear
[55:18] their paint they can do all these things
[55:20] and feel like they don't have to give an
[55:22] account to
[55:23] nobody and they fail to see
[55:27] one day they're going to give an account
[55:30] that's right and that's to
[55:33] God you understand me don't get quiet I
[55:37] I I I'm going hurry up I'm going hurry
[55:39] up therefore as the church is subject to
[55:41] Christ so let the wise be to their own
[55:43] husbands in everything their own
[55:45] husbands now no man can come in your
[55:47] house and boss your wife around
[55:50] now not even the
[55:53] pastor and I know some people they make
[55:56] their
[55:57] pastors have more Authority than their
[56:00] husbands that ain't what the scripture
[56:04] says their husband is their husband not
[56:07] the
[56:08] pastor well my pastor I'mma talk now you
[56:12] want to make me
[56:18] mad y'all understand what I'm saying
[56:21] it'll make any man mad or angry if his
[56:25] wife give more honor to the
[56:28] pastor than her own
[56:30] husband that's out of the institution of
[56:33] God her husband you said what he's the
[56:36] husband of the
[56:38] church yeah keep it
[56:42] spiritual yall understand what I'm
[56:44] saying therefore as the church is
[56:46] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[56:48] to their own husbands in everything and
[56:51] I'm saying that because I've seen
[56:53] pastors break up marriages
[56:57] I've seen them do
[56:59] it husbands loves your wives and oh I
[57:03] was a woman Pastor well yeah I think you
[57:05] need to do this I think you need your
[57:07] question should be why you thinking that
[57:09] why you want me to do
[57:11] that right cuz sometimes y'all know what
[57:15] it is husband loves your wives even as
[57:17] Christ loves the church and gave himself
[57:20] for it so we have to love that have that
[57:24] connection I I give honors to to my wife
[57:26] today during my time of Affliction she
[57:29] was right on it just there one thing I
[57:33] know about her she she all she knows how
[57:35] to make me feel like a baby you
[57:37] know she's a real mother and a real
[57:41] wife and I really appreciate you know
[57:44] her when she do stuff like that it just
[57:46] I think God allow those things to say
[57:49] okay your eyes is getting a little
[57:51] clothes here you need to reopen you know
[57:53] reopen and evaluate see what you have
[57:56] instead of accounting and looking at and
[57:58] taking things for granted husband loved
[58:00] your wife even as Christ also loved the
[58:02] church and gave himself for it that he
[58:05] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[58:06] washing of the Water by the word and I
[58:08] didn't know what I had but I didn't want
[58:10] her to catch it she says oh I'm all
[58:12] right it's somehow faith kicks in with a
[58:16] wife or woman when it comes to sickness
[58:18] in the house they become the Red Cross
[58:20] you know that's right nothing can touch
[58:24] him that he might present to himself a
[58:26] glorious church not having spot wrinkle
[58:29] or y'all know what a washing by the
[58:31] water of the word means the husband
[58:34] governs the wife by the
[58:37] word not because I'm the
[58:39] boss by the word he he he sees her he
[58:44] watches her he cleanses her by taking
[58:47] the word and said honey the Bible
[58:50] said not me but this is what the word
[58:53] says and this is how he washes her
[58:56] not by anything else other than the word
[59:00] so ought men to love their wives as
[59:02] their own bodies he that loveth his wife
[59:04] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[59:08] his own flesh but nourishes it and
[59:10] cherishes it even as the Lord the church
[59:13] y'all know and and I'm rushing but but
[59:16] I'm coming to an end for we are members
[59:18] of his body of his flesh and of his bone
[59:22] for this CA shall a man leave his father
[59:24] and his mother and shall be join unto
[59:27] his unto his wife and they too shall be
[59:30] one flesh hello so you know that in all
[59:35] of this I sound like sister Angela
[59:40] didn't but that's where I got it
[59:42] from I caught it as I said it but the
[59:46] point
[59:48] is when a husband and wife marry one
[59:51] this is the art of the
[59:53] church we don't marry the family
[59:58] and husbands need to know that when when
[1:00:02] you marry a wife mama ain't in the
[1:00:04] middle
[1:00:06] amen and and mothers wives you must know
[1:00:09] that when you marry a husband your daddy
[1:00:11] is not in the middle
[1:00:15] am this is not a marriage like they have
[1:00:18] overseas when you marry one you marry
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:22] family that's not scriptural
[1:00:27] it's
[1:00:28] not and you're not supposed to be
[1:00:30] telling all your business to your family
[1:00:33] the Bible said you leave that you start
[1:00:36] your own function amen and that's what
[1:00:40] people find
[1:00:41] hard when brother Brandon was getting
[1:00:43] married and marry that old that young
[1:00:45] couple that was so poor that was one of
[1:00:47] the questions he asked her now if your
[1:00:50] husband can't if your husband can't you
[1:00:53] know provide for you or something
[1:00:55] happened to his job will you run back to
[1:00:57] your mama she says no sir I'll stick
[1:01:01] right with him see that's a real
[1:01:03] marriage rich or
[1:01:06] poor better for Words hey when we when
[1:01:09] take those vows we don't know that
[1:01:10] better for words is
[1:01:13] coming we don't know that rich and poor
[1:01:16] can become that just that you know and
[1:01:20] but but we make those vows because we
[1:01:22] know circumstances do change all right
[1:01:26] can I have five more minutes amen okay
[1:01:29] I'm almost done this is a great mystery
[1:01:32] but I speak concerning the church
[1:01:35] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:01:37] particular so love his wife even as
[1:01:41] himself and the wife sees that she renc
[1:01:44] her
[1:01:46] husband right and what man is going to
[1:01:48] go out here and buy himself a suit and
[1:01:50] wouldn't want to want want to see his
[1:01:52] wife in something nice
[1:01:54] amen you know one thing about I'm not
[1:01:58] don't mean to but she's here cuz I talk
[1:02:00] about her when she's not here so I'm not
[1:02:02] talk about it while she's here my wife
[1:02:04] doesn't require
[1:02:05] much she's not a big jewelry
[1:02:09] person she's not a fancy she doesn't
[1:02:12] love all that fancy stuff I mean you
[1:02:15] know if somebody give her a nice dress
[1:02:17] so she she she'll wear it but she all
[1:02:20] she don't care for all that glitter and
[1:02:22] gold stuff you understand what I'm
[1:02:24] saying but I always I I love to see her
[1:02:28] get something new and many times and
[1:02:30] she'll tell you the truth I've given her
[1:02:31] money they do things with and she give
[1:02:33] it to the
[1:02:35] children our grandkids need this you
[1:02:37] know me that's what they
[1:02:41] do but that's good
[1:02:44] character right we have no excuse to
[1:02:47] hate each
[1:02:48] other when it comes to marriage there
[1:02:52] are those who hate each other now let me
[1:02:55] say it like like this you can't govern a
[1:02:57] person if they hate
[1:02:59] you but we have no right to hate them
[1:03:03] back and my point is if we have those
[1:03:07] things situated in us that's why the
[1:03:10] word comes to shine that light because
[1:03:13] you don't want listen I put it this way
[1:03:17] if I go to hell I want it to be my
[1:03:20] fault I want it to be nobody
[1:03:23] else's you understand me well you're
[1:03:26] going because you didn't forgive that
[1:03:28] person no no no no what Am I who am I
[1:03:33] right every time I hear this thing he
[1:03:36] that without sin Let Him cast the first
[1:03:37] stone I can't help but to than that in
[1:03:41] all my Christian walk since I was you
[1:03:43] know just graduating out of high school
[1:03:45] I became a Christian and I've made tons
[1:03:48] of mistakes and I've had many offenses
[1:03:51] and yet I could truly say that I have no
[1:03:53] bildings in my heart toward
[1:03:56] anyone I could not have done
[1:03:59] that no way God did it and the reason
[1:04:04] why I say I can stand and say that
[1:04:06] because when I know that there's
[1:04:07] bitterness in my heart I go on my knees
[1:04:10] and
[1:04:11] pray I pray and when I see the devil you
[1:04:14] know how the devil does when he want you
[1:04:16] to accept something he's always forceful
[1:04:20] and when he's forceful he's bringing
[1:04:21] that same thought where you know they
[1:04:23] meant to do it and they did it this way
[1:04:25] and they didn't care how they did it and
[1:04:27] and if you don't stop that force from
[1:04:30] penetrating your mind it's going to drop
[1:04:33] into your heart that's right and once it
[1:04:36] drop into your heart your feelings going
[1:04:38] to turn toward that person just the same
[1:04:40] as he's feeling toward you you going to
[1:04:42] feel toward that
[1:04:44] person right and when you do that now
[1:04:47] Satan got you in a a
[1:04:49] cage and you can't get out until you say
[1:04:52] Lord have mercy on me amen
[1:04:56] right live for the man who hates you
[1:04:58] brother random says live for the person
[1:05:02] who would kill you if they could
[1:05:06] ameno that's what they don't know they
[1:05:10] that's what they done to him they killed
[1:05:14] him right this is coming from the
[1:05:16] message that day of Calvary paragraph 88
[1:05:20] that's what they done to him they killed
[1:05:23] him he died that he might might save
[1:05:26] them that eternal life when you that is
[1:05:30] in your bosom you're facing heaven then
[1:05:34] but you your sacri you sacrifice your
[1:05:36] own things give them up like the sheep
[1:05:40] gives its wool you look on toward
[1:05:43] Calvary I hope this help you to get in a
[1:05:46] place that that's what the Tabernacle
[1:05:49] see that's what all people has to got to
[1:05:52] do is find out what you are
[1:05:56] and what the purpose Church it isn't
[1:05:59] going to church just to play music sing
[1:06:02] songs church is a place where correction
[1:06:06] judgment begins at the house of God we
[1:06:09] must reckon ourselves dead and alive to
[1:06:13] Christ then he made the way that we
[1:06:17] could sacrifice ourselves to his service
[1:06:21] to follow him if we follow him we lead
[1:06:25] the life that he lived and that's
[1:06:29] wonderful right take up your cross amen
[1:06:33] and follow me people are you just weak
[1:06:36] to be a Christian you can't be weak
[1:06:40] that's right if you're a real Christian
[1:06:41] you one of the strongest people in the
[1:06:45] world it's either to go do something
[1:06:47] wrong it's difficult to do
[1:06:50] right you understand me if until that
[1:06:54] nature is Chang
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:59] changed until that nature is
[1:07:02] changed you going to
[1:07:04] battle but he that knoweth to do good
[1:07:06] and doeth is not to him is sin and so
[1:07:10] you make fall but you get up don't ever
[1:07:14] be ashamed of to say I'm sorry because
[1:07:17] if you can't say I'm sorry and forgive
[1:07:20] me to your brother or your sister that's
[1:07:22] the way you are with God Amen
[1:07:27] that's the way you are with God and
[1:07:29] however you treat your brother and
[1:07:31] sister is how you treat God is that the
[1:07:34] truth that's the word the Bible
[1:07:37] say however you do it as such as youve
[1:07:40] done to the least of them you've done it
[1:07:43] unto me and remember at the Judgment
[1:07:46] brother Brandon brings it out in that
[1:07:47] message he
[1:07:50] says that's he says God will separate
[1:07:54] the sheep from the goat amen he put the
[1:07:56] goat on the left and the Sheep on the
[1:07:58] right and he said to the goat basically
[1:08:01] you depart for me you know you workers
[1:08:03] of iniquity you know you you're doomed
[1:08:06] and he basically
[1:08:07] says when I was hungry you didn't feed
[1:08:10] me when I was naked you didn't closee me
[1:08:13] am when I was sick you didn't visit me
[1:08:15] that's right see he's he going through
[1:08:17] all of these things that people know to
[1:08:21] do and they won't do amen and then he
[1:08:24] goes over to the sheep and he says when
[1:08:27] I was
[1:08:28] hungry you fed me when I was clothed
[1:08:32] need clothing you you when I was naked
[1:08:34] you clothed me see he went all of these
[1:08:36] things and then the Sheep says Lord when
[1:08:39] did we do all these things see brother
[1:08:41] brandom said you got to this got this
[1:08:43] kind this kind of stuff like okay I give
[1:08:45] him $50 because I know I'm going to reap
[1:08:47] a
[1:08:49] hundred no you do this thing so easily
[1:08:53] you don't even think about it you don't
[1:08:55] don't even look for returns but
[1:08:58] Christians want to be Church Christians
[1:09:00] they don't want to be real Christians
[1:09:02] and I hope tonight I said something to
[1:09:05] each and every one of you that would
[1:09:07] make you go out of here says Lord I want
[1:09:09] to be a real Christian I want to die to
[1:09:12] myself I want to ride to myself I want
[1:09:14] to be like Paul that said it's not I
[1:09:16] that live but Christ that lives in me
[1:09:19] that's what I want brother said he he
[1:09:22] wanted to be such a shell all I want to
[1:09:24] be is a shell
[1:09:26] that God can use you love the Lord and
[1:09:30] that's why God put a man and a woman
[1:09:33] together see before Adam and Eve they
[1:09:37] walked together in
[1:09:39] harmony but we have no idea what it was
[1:09:41] like after the
[1:09:43] fall but we do see what it is now and we
[1:09:47] see how Satan has basically destroyed
[1:09:50] mankind because the the house has fallen
[1:09:54] apart and it's so difficult now because
[1:09:58] everybody feel I got a right I got a
[1:10:00] right I got a right and you know when
[1:10:02] you come to Jesus you got to forfeit all
[1:10:04] your rights than you lord your rights
[1:10:07] become wrong in the eyes of Jesus so you
[1:10:10] you forfeit all of that let me tell you
[1:10:12] something God will never and I'm closing
[1:10:15] on the statement God will never cause
[1:10:18] you to give up something that he will
[1:10:20] not give you something
[1:10:22] greater and you know what God always
[1:10:24] give you
[1:10:27] interest
[1:10:29] always
[1:10:31] always let's stand have faith in
[1:10:35] God hold fast your
[1:10:39] confidence let's end with a word of
[1:10:41] prayer
[1:10:42] tonight dear heavenly father we come
[1:10:45] before
[1:10:47] you as humbly as we know how we took a
[1:10:51] lot more time tonight forgive us I
[1:10:54] wanted to get through this fifth chapter
[1:10:57] rush through it a little bit but I feel
[1:10:59] like things were said tonight that will
[1:11:02] make us see that if we're not careful
[1:11:05] we'll do the same as the Pentecostals of
[1:11:08] this age we
[1:11:10] forgot the true
[1:11:13] calling and the true calling of this
[1:11:15] message to is to let our light so shine
[1:11:19] amongst men and that light is you that
[1:11:22] light is the gospel we come to win souls
[1:11:25] and not to discourage them we come to
[1:11:28] suffer that we might reign with you help
[1:11:32] us now Jesus to take our eyes off of the
[1:11:35] all of the world and place our eyes on
[1:11:38] you and by doing so you said if we seek
[1:11:41] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:11:44] righteousness that all of these things
[1:11:46] will be added to us so may the Holy
[1:11:51] Spirit from this day forward keep us
[1:11:53] focused make
[1:11:56] us wise make it real to us that we know
[1:12:02] that there's no failure in God and
[1:12:05] there's no fooling you you see us Lord
[1:12:08] you know the very intent of our hearts
[1:12:12] uh before we say or do anything and so
[1:12:15] my God all I desire I believe this is
[1:12:18] what we desire tonight is to have that
[1:12:21] Ephesian experience where we can love
[1:12:24] our brothers and love our enemies do
[1:12:27] good to those that despitefully use us
[1:12:30] and hate us Lord this is Christ this is
[1:12:33] what a real Christian is and
[1:12:36] this real Christians no matter what we
[1:12:39] must go through to become that or to
[1:12:42] reflect that this is what we want we
[1:12:44] don't want to live to ourselves Lord we
[1:12:47] want to live our lives for others may we
[1:12:49] become Bolder with the gospel Bolder
[1:12:52] with our convictions Bolder with the
[1:12:54] word that we may shine among men
