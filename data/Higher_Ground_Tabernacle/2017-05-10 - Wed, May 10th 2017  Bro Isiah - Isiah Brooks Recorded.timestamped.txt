[0:00] all what would water come with and make
[0:02] this announcement on Friday as well Amen
[0:04] for those who might want to comment only
[0:06] out a way I'm going I mean even if my
[0:09] wife and I have this drive two cars to
[0:12] carry will be willing to do that just
[0:15] your company and your fellowship would
[0:18] be appreciated also I was thinking just
[0:24] one thing I need to do a cover to that
[0:27] service one thing I need to do is after
[0:32] this time we're going to basically cut
[0:35] back on our visiting preachers only
[0:37] because of financial issues because
[0:41] normally I have to pay the ticket and
[0:43] then we have offering all of that stuff
[0:47] that we have to do with looking back
[0:49] through the year years has been a lot of
[0:52] money so we're just gonna cut back and
[0:56] we may have our brother listening
[1:00] brother Troy and myself kind of working
[1:03] together to keep everything going by the
[1:04] grace of God this brother that's coming
[1:07] now we may take up an offering but it
[1:10] won't be anything that we I'll be doing
[1:15] to cause because I told him I didn't
[1:17] have the money to to give any offering
[1:20] the Sunday and of course he's a past and
[1:23] he's not interested in and offering
[1:28] sometimes we were saying in light of
[1:31] this mm anyway we do thank you for the
[1:36] prayers we talk with our brethren
[1:39] concerning your last service we have
[1:41] we've got everything on one Accord
[1:42] everybody's understanding everybody and
[1:45] I just think by God's grace I need to
[1:47] know them and they need to go meet man
[1:49] but one of the things they did say they
[1:51] really emphasized that they wanted me as
[1:53] a pastor didn't want nobody else not
[1:56] even another Congolese so whatever the
[2:00] will of the Lord is we want it to be
[2:03] done and we've got another group of
[2:05] people coming from Omaha now I don't
[2:08] know how many families but there are
[2:09] several families that will be coming
[2:13] and they're from Nepal a child remember
[2:17] where that was but anyway they live in
[2:20] Omaha been there for a while and have
[2:22] not been able to find a message Church
[2:24] and God showed them our church so I've
[2:27] got a brother coming this week to talk
[2:29] with me between Monday and Wednesday so
[2:31] pray that God's will be done there and
[2:34] be wonderful if the Lord is bringing
[2:37] them here I just see prophecy and name
[2:40] being fulfilled I don't know what God is
[2:42] doing but I don't want to be in his way
[2:44] man
[2:45] you know I want his will to be done and
[2:48] so y'all pray for me and pray for
[2:51] everybody here we just want God to to
[2:54] really intervene here also we have some
[2:59] situations that in my life that I need
[3:02] God to answer to remedy for me if you
[3:06] remember me in your prayers I really
[3:08] would appreciate my god it's great she
[3:11] loved the Lord
[3:12] I mean God is good to us name Amen
[3:16] there's no way that we can express our
[3:18] gratitude
[3:19] my wife just found out she might be
[3:21] travel-size see how she got herself she
[3:26] probably prayed for me Lord every saw
[3:28] his name but anyway hey he was floored
[3:32] they were to be by my I was I was
[3:36] bragging on her over there a shame it's
[3:38] not she's not here for me that to hear

[6:14] kindness towards me
[6:15] Isaiah 32 and - and it's test and a man
[6:23] shall be as a hiding place from the wind
[6:28] and uncovered from The Tempest as real
[6:33] as Oh
[6:33] water in a dry place at the shadow of a
[6:37] great rock in a weary land y'all can
[6:41] hear me even men Isaiah 63 3 & 4
[6:45] I am trodden the winepress alone and
[6:49] other people there was none with me I
[6:53] would track them down tread them in my
[6:56] anger and trample them in my fury and
[7:00] their blood shall be sprinkle upon my
[7:03] garments and I was saying all my raiment
[7:07] but the day of vengeance is in mine
[7:10] heart and the year of my redeemed is
[7:15] confident let us pray Heavenly Father we
[7:18] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[7:20] we just thank you for being so real to
[7:24] us oh god there is no way to express our
[7:29] appreciation and I love toward your Lord
[7:33] as you know our hearts you know our
[7:36] earnest desire is to serve you with all
[7:38] the heart mine and soul
[7:41] father I have no faith or even trust in
[7:44] myself and then but lord I do trust you
[7:47] Jesus and I know that you have promised
[7:50] that the work that you be guarding us
[7:52] you will favor literally Lord that's
[7:56] what I'm standing on and that's what I'm
[7:58] trusting the real forgive us for any
[8:01] actions or thoughts of undelete and then
[8:04] cleanse us from all unrighteousness law
[8:07] yes and bless us tonight in a special
[8:10] way and Jesus Christ's name we pray you
[8:15] may be see here I like to entitle this
[8:19] message crushed crushed I realized
[8:28] something
[8:29] this was inspired when buddy Lujan was
[8:32] here to start I thought about those
[8:36] seeds that had to be crushed wheat or
[8:39] barley whatever it may have been to
[8:43] produce a flower that would make gray
[8:47] you and I know that that's what happened
[8:49] to Jesus yes he was and here's the lily
[8:52] of the valley but in order to enjoy the
[8:57] life of that living it had to be crushed
[9:01] now we are experiencing the opium of the
[9:05] own experience and when we think about
[9:09] being crushed it means to press or
[9:13] squeeze with the force that destroys or
[9:18] deforms and you and I must realize it
[9:23] man that's what God is doing
[9:24] amen it also means to squeeze or pound
[9:29] into small fragments of particles or
[9:33] stone to force out by pressing a
[9:37] squeezing extract for example to crush
[9:43] cotton seed in order to produce oil and
[9:49] we realize by the grace of God you know
[9:51] the probably God described it like this
[9:53] he said you and I must die and rock man
[9:58] and I understand by God's grace that
[10:02] when we click or as a seed planted under
[10:05] the earth that our that world presses on
[10:10] that sea till it breaks it crushes the
[10:14] seed but when the questions are seated
[10:17] also rot but in the mists of that rowdy
[10:19] there is a lot that comes up to the
[10:24] serpent we we see Christ then I don't
[10:30] want to just die I want to be crushed I
[10:32] wanna I wanna I wanna rot yes everything
[10:37] amen so that Christ can be seen in me
[10:40] and I think about Paul when he said it's
[10:46] not I that live but Christ that lives in
[10:49] me and then we can follow Paul's life
[10:52] you know I realize that Paul had to go
[10:56] through some major crushing he had to go
[10:59] through a hardship
[11:01] and in his life wasn't easy in order to
[11:06] exemplify Christ that's all he was
[11:08] interested in that whatever he would go
[11:11] through he would be the reflection of
[11:14] Jesus Christ and coming to understand
[11:18] that we say to ourselves oh my god I got
[11:24] faith let me ever done that and then you
[11:28] find out there's a part of you that not
[11:31] really sure that you've really got to
[11:33] pay we call that the subconscious she
[11:39] not conscious this is what we're seeing
[11:40] right here right here right here and
[11:42] every one of us can testify in our
[11:45] consciousness I believe an amen
[11:48] but I like that scripture says I believe
[11:51] but I'll help my unbelief
[11:53] okay and I believe when that was shared
[11:56] was talking about the conscience of the
[11:58] subconscious because sometimes we can
[12:01] think in one way and will not understand
[12:04] you know that in our subconscious will
[12:07] whip thinking of something else
[12:09] just on this weekend I was speaking to a
[12:12] brother and they came up out of me that
[12:15] I didn't even know was there
[12:16] what was it it was my subconsciousness
[12:20] rehearsing hurts and disappointment that
[12:24] I should have been over with it should
[12:26] have been all the way you know what I'm
[12:28] trying to say man but you see that's
[12:31] what he hinders us amen because in our
[12:34] subconscious we have things that are
[12:37] hidden and sometimes situation bring
[12:41] those things back up to the conscious is
[12:43] that right oh come on somebody every one
[12:47] of us know how to add one plus one but
[12:49] we don't think about that and just
[12:51] situation comes up and they said five
[12:53] plus five oh you show that's kid which
[12:55] is that understanding of that was in
[12:58] your subconscious and when you needed it
[13:00] it came up that's just a way the devil
[13:03] does us especially when we say God I
[13:06] won't the Holy Ghost
[13:08] welcomed in your subconscious you feel
[13:11] like you're not worthy of it
[13:12] you
[13:15] because your shop consciousness and your
[13:17] consciousness must mess up amen
[13:21] hallelujah amen for an example when
[13:24] brother Branham was there
[13:26] Amen designing the people he was not
[13:29] working with their conscience he was
[13:32] able to go into the subconscious yes and
[13:35] find things that were hidden there sub
[13:38] consciousness that they themselves had
[13:41] forgotten but those things that they had
[13:44] forgotten was the very same things that
[13:46] were hitting them on the healing or
[13:48] their faith and once those things were
[13:52] cleared out then God was able to move to
[13:56] God cannot move unless your
[13:59] consciousness and your conscious of
[14:01] subconscious is on one Accord right I
[14:05] believe that's what James said God don't
[14:08] be double-minded P God came back for the
[14:11] double minded man in your consciousness
[14:13] you say I believe but your subconscious
[14:15] is named I'm not sure about that you
[14:20] understand she we can't just walk with a
[14:24] mental conception of this word
[14:27] hallelujah brother Brown said this is
[14:31] will overrule that that cause
[14:33] subconscious will move on you try to
[14:36] walk with the mental conception saying
[14:38] Laura God and I'm healed
[14:40] praise the Lord I'm healed and right
[14:42] down in there this is something saying
[14:44] finally just rules the right away and
[14:47] when your ship to the rise then you say
[14:50] well I just didn't get it t in your
[14:53] subconsciousness
[14:55] you gotta believe which is strike we
[14:57] hear y'all understand me it cannot be
[15:01] Amen where you warring against yourself
[15:04] it must be a solid faith man he said
[15:10] people come up to the platform lots of
[15:12] times law for the Menem I got all faiths
[15:15] but now they believe that in sincerity
[15:17] like on the vision and so forth but God
[15:20] gives it possible then to find where
[15:23] that floor is and Garvin
[15:27] at times how many times God has even
[15:30] warned you in a dream because sometimes
[15:33] when God can't get you in your
[15:36] consciousness he had come to you and
[15:38] your son commenced it right
[15:41] Oh think about Daniel in the king the
[15:44] King dream that dream in his
[15:46] subconscious because that's where you
[15:47] have your dream and it was Daniel Amen
[15:51] God used him to go into that could pop
[15:54] it into that subconscious test and see
[15:57] what the king was dreaming and what was
[16:01] it a warning from God
[16:03] see so God if you can't get you a new
[16:06] consciousness he'll get you in your
[16:08] subconscious now right right it's true
[16:11] right okay you've got three parts of you
[16:14] in that you got consciousness you
[16:17] got sub consciousness and then in your
[16:20] dream is unconsciousness but anyway God
[16:24] will use those things to get to you to
[16:28] show you even where you standing with
[16:31] him many times we we say we have a given
[16:35] an individual but in our sub
[16:38] consciousness we have and when you have
[16:41] it in your sub consciousness in weakens
[16:44] your save because you double-minded man
[16:47] and in your shock consciousness she the
[16:51] Holy Ghost can only go there and help
[16:53] you but many times we don't pray long
[16:56] enough for God to bring up what's
[16:58] getting your subconsciousness Cuba those
[17:01] of you who really really would pray God
[17:04] will show you all the things that you
[17:07] need to make right if you pray long
[17:12] enough man
[17:13] sometimes it may take all night pray but
[17:16] whatever it takes that's what you need
[17:18] to do ah because we won't everything see
[17:22] I'll say it like this and I heard a
[17:24] brother say this but it's true I heard
[17:26] brother Balaam say something similar and
[17:29] I may read it to you but the point is
[17:30] when we think about an iceberg and I
[17:33] think this is the guy who was working
[17:35] with the conscious and the subconscious
[17:36] Ness and I can't remember his name but
[17:38] the iceberg
[17:40] we still iceberg and we said wow that's
[17:42] a big iceberg but you understand that
[17:46] the biggest part of the iceberg
[17:47] is under the water cheap the part that
[17:51] you can see is your consciousness the
[17:53] part that you can't see is the
[17:56] unconsciousness right think about this
[17:59] when the time came and they had that
[18:05] great ship of the Jake Titanic it was
[18:08] almost exactly during that time of the
[18:11] pentecostal moon write shortly after
[18:14] that amen brother Randall was bowling
[18:16] but but but this was a great kind of
[18:18] coaster move it was chart rich increased
[18:21] with Goods right amen and but you see
[18:25] what the Pentecostal people did they
[18:28] would not deal with their subconscious
[18:30] next they dealt with the consciousness
[18:32] or we can speak in tongues and all he's
[18:35] got to think they saw the great wax but
[18:37] they would not they dare to get God in
[18:41] this shut consciousness I thought you
[18:44] had these people that were able to
[18:45] produce all kinds of gifts and signs and
[18:48] wonders but inside of them in the shock
[18:52] consciousness would not allow them to
[18:55] live a holy life and because of that the
[18:59] ship crashed yeah remember God always
[19:03] use shadows and darks God was typing out
[19:07] the Pentecostal truck I really believe
[19:09] that it meant to show that it was going
[19:11] to sink in this life because they
[19:15] increased with glue it and had neat
[19:18] enough head and they thought nobody
[19:20] could say Bishop G but yeah and still
[19:25] God suck the don't you know God
[19:29] still work the same way
[19:31] hey listen people you and I must
[19:35] understand we are composed of body soul
[19:38] and spirit man
[19:40] right and each Austria bill must agree
[19:43] hey you know coming you to get into the
[19:47] holy to home but you yo-yo spirit must
[19:51] be a
[19:51] control and control your body magic see
[19:56] that's the power of the Holy Ghost I'm
[19:57] not talking about human up come with the
[19:59] holy gold coming in and controlling here
[20:04] emotion is not so much as jumping up and
[20:06] down let me back up the Holy Spirit will
[20:10] make every movement like Christ
[20:12] it'll make you Christ life the fruit of
[20:15] the Spirit is love joy peace
[20:17] longsuffering God goodness meekness
[20:19] gentleness face to face those things are
[20:22] what the Holy Ghost controls how
[20:24] emotions our emotion is not so much as
[20:27] jumping up and down we can do that
[20:30] ascending with will bring that to you
[20:33] but the Holy Spirit you into operation
[20:36] or in control of God that you walk in
[20:40] peace and love and enjoy with
[20:42] long-suffering goodness meekness
[20:44] gentleness patience you see it gives us
[20:47] something that you do it's something the
[20:50] Holy Spirit does in you kid is no longer
[20:54] an intellectual part of your own it's a
[20:57] subconscious moving of the Holies oh he
[21:01] said I wish I could shout the praises of
[21:04] God around the world to that cheek
[21:07] that's what we understand a lot of time
[21:10] we psychologically think it our
[21:13] controlling you no no no it's God all
[21:16] that spirit in you and controlling your
[21:19] spirit and that's what we won't ride
[21:23] deep we must understand I said all of
[21:29] that because that in order in order for
[21:32] us to live we must allow the Holy Spirit
[21:36] not just to crush the surface but it
[21:39] must come and crush all of my name
[21:42] everything that's wrong in our spirit it
[21:45] in our flesh we must allow the Holy
[21:47] Spirit to crush it harder to get to the
[21:50] salt in God Christ again right we don't
[21:53] have to soldiers are in doing episode
[21:58] hallelujah we need inside healing before
[22:02] we can help outside healing matter is
[22:04] that right

[24:36] know what they did then he stained his
[24:39] own garments with his own blood but this
[24:42] time around a man is 50 amen
[24:45] he was saying his garment a guy but
[24:47] it'll be the blood of his enemy Marit
[24:50] hmm now many times I read this and I
[24:55] thought I understood it
[24:57] Philippians 2:5 says let this mind be in
[25:00] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[25:03] being in the form of God thought it not
[25:05] robbery to be equal with God
[25:07] let me change some God is not double
[25:08] mind
[25:10] God has one mine his mind is God's minds
[25:14] right right now how you don't get God's
[25:18] mind without dying you got to die
[25:23] have you got a rock you got to be
[25:25] willing to surrender everything to God
[25:27] you can't hold it back hallelujah oh
[25:30] come on somebody I believe with
[25:33] Christians but my point is where are we
[25:35] are we are in the outer court MA the Air
[25:39] Corps many of the holy the Holy See
[25:43] Christians but you got you gotta try me
[25:46] and each journey requires a greater
[25:49] commitment on your part teachers all
[25:54] right a professor on Jesus Christ from a
[25:56] lollipop you know in confessional about
[25:58] all that's good and it right then when
[26:01] you do that you'll hear your pass from
[26:02] death to life but you don't stop dead
[26:05] man named the Holy Ghost must must bring
[26:09] you to a seekers I hated to them a lot
[26:11] of time we don't know that we got the
[26:13] dirt in us into the Holy Ghost God's mad
[26:15] hallelujah sometimes you know I don't
[26:18] know what you're used to watch my mom
[26:19] and my chef you should wash clothes with
[26:21] our own handle that report sometimes it
[26:24] look like this thing would be easy to
[26:25] get up and oftentimes they thought you
[26:28] thought it would be easy United what so
[26:30] easy then you have to buy more detergent
[26:32] and more pressure but if you wasn't
[26:35] careful you rub a hole in your thumb
[26:37] I'll rub the color out of it
[26:40] so but God is not that way God will get
[26:44] all the stain out of the eye I don't
[26:48] know about you people but I need work on
[26:49] menace you know I'm not going to pretend
[26:53] that you know I'm exactly what God want
[26:55] me to be but I know one thing I'm gonna
[26:56] journey
[26:57] hey and I'm not going to stop in this
[26:59] journey until I'm just like you no
[27:03] matter what the cost
[27:04] no matter what your tip let it take out
[27:05] okay I use that term I don't care but I
[27:07] do care I want everybody to go if I
[27:10] gotta go by myself
[27:11] you understand me and people are like
[27:15] when you say that but the truth is you
[27:16] would always must have that attitude you
[27:19] gotta have that attitude I'm going in
[27:22] Ojai is that all right and now he trying
[27:25] to rock listen let this mind be in you
[27:27] being in the form of God thought it not
[27:29] proud to meet with God but made himself
[27:31] of no reputation and took upon him the
[27:34] form of a servant
[27:36] I was made when life is a minute a lot
[27:39] of time we don't see that we don't see
[27:41] this part made himself of no reputation
[27:45] because we find out that even in in its
[27:48] message seem like that's what their
[27:50] issues that's what their goals are to
[27:52] make a reputation well how can that be
[27:54] Christ it's not like I said you look at
[27:59] this detail in it later and it just says
[28:01] swept for the Church of them and
[28:02] everything and people are looking at it
[28:04] and still blind that this thing is a
[28:06] deed that has turned into a doctrine
[28:08] that is also turning to me and now we
[28:11] worship me hello we give more credit to
[28:16] the creature than we do the Creator is
[28:20] some of y'all don't know what I'm
[28:22] talking about but I'm working with
[28:23] experience I've seen it and there's only
[28:27] one kingdom and that's the kingdom of
[28:29] God and that's what he interest to hear
[28:32] I'm not interested in a great name or
[28:34] big something like that you know I'm
[28:36] repented from a lot of things that I've
[28:37] done in the past all amen in those
[28:40] things I see myself being
[28:42] manipulated and misled by people who I
[28:44] thought were great ministers of God I
[28:46] got my focus now there's only one person
[28:50] that needs to be exalted
[28:52] now that's Jesus amen right made himself
[28:56] of no reputation being found and
[28:59] fashioned as a man he humbled himself
[29:01] and came obedient unto death even the
[29:04] death of the cross now you saw what do
[29:07] you mean brother bridge was Peter dead
[29:09] to himself but Peter dad to himself
[29:12] Peter said when God said is your time to
[29:15] go back to be crucified he said okay
[29:17] I'll turn around but law I'm not am
[29:21] unworthy to be crucified like you turn
[29:25] me upside down I think he perhaps was
[29:29] the first in history to get turned
[29:30] upside down I don't know but I just know
[29:33] one thing he saw himself more that he he
[29:36] was so so so much the last thing cried
[29:39] he just didn't want anyone equal to it I
[29:43] cannot be crucified like my Lord was
[29:45] crucified y'all you're insane see my
[29:49] thing is you know I look at those
[29:50] disciples and their behavior to tests
[29:53] and trials and persecution and I look at
[29:57] our age uncle then how we we go with the
[30:00] test for trials and here we suppose have
[30:02] a double portion or not that means slow
[30:06] funky down out there
[30:09] they were even a traveling go wherever
[30:12] God say go they could care less about
[30:14] this world that's my dog holla people
[30:17] who is trained now how can that be the
[30:19] same as we are we don't behave this amen
[30:22] amen

[30:29] you see God is trying together oh he
[30:32] goes triplets folks amen
[30:34] all is calm for to God you better your
[30:36] God cause it's coming God's gonna take
[30:40] everything away from you and you would

[35:10] but whatever it takes I know at the end
[35:11] of this thing I'm gonna have a rainbow
[35:14] around hallelujah
[35:18] think about it look what Daniel saw then
[35:22] you saw the same thing she somehow you
[35:25] going to be crushed if you don't all of
[35:27] the rock the rock won't fall again that
[35:29] was it and the Bible said that the rock
[35:31] falls on you it would grind you to power
[35:33] man hammer
[35:34] yeah right you know something brother
[35:36] brother out Yvonne was preaching and and
[35:41] I went back and looked it up in here we
[35:43] were talking about that choreography
[35:44] you know when the great when the seed
[35:46] came down like man you know all all this
[35:49] time I thought it was just bread but you
[35:52] know they had to crush that see to make
[35:53] flour to make bread she that's what
[35:58] Jesus was to see but yet his filly said
[36:01] I am the brave because you knew that he
[36:04] would be crushed one day and break all a
[36:06] thing that would produced prayer living
[36:09] bread right and then you think about he
[36:13] said man you hold this over to the next
[36:15] day and we know what that here's
[36:17] denominational hell that read over and
[36:19] it rotted indistinct but he said listen
[36:22] he said on the sixth day he said imma
[36:25] give you double courses that's right I'm
[36:27] gonna give you enough for the six thing
[36:29] and we'll give you enough with the
[36:30] seventh day so you won't have to go out
[36:32] and run forward
[36:34] he heard of course it does not what the
[36:38] message did for us and we don't have to
[36:40] run for it it's already here
[36:43] we need to eat grubbing on enemy Oh
[36:46] slower the government is not hunting
[36:48] forth then you're in trouble because God
[36:50] wants you to rest on the seventh day
[36:52] Christ hallelujah and you hadn't gotten
[36:57] there yet until you can rest in your
[36:59] salvation
[37:01] amen amen
[37:03] you still know I don't know if I'm
[37:05] saying I don't know what I'm incorrect
[37:07] you ain't at rest
[37:08] no and then when you are at rest the
[37:11] devil assistance is scared of you
[37:14] because he knows no matter what he tries
[37:17] to do to make you doubt you won't but
[37:19] you've had an experience
[37:21] are you dead how could you talk if you'd
[37:24] a man Christ lives in your head
[37:29] nobody's gonna rock shrub the world was
[37:35] queued up without him and the whole
[37:36] image of the system would broke down and
[37:38] become like chaff of the summer
[37:40] threshing floor and the wind packed it
[37:43] away I thought about that and I look up
[37:44] that threshing floor some of y'all may
[37:46] know what it is but it was the way they
[37:47] did they even have machines now and what
[37:50] they wanted to get an instrument or
[37:52] something to show you but stretching
[37:55] floor instruments they had different
[37:56] instruments how that's called um or what
[38:00] you call it just a bit it it's called um
[38:06] flater f l8 I am frame trailer not Freya
[38:13] is FF l a I L clinically but anyway they
[38:20] had instrument and it would have a stick
[38:23] on it and you may have seen in the
[38:25] middle and live every day because some
[38:26] people use it as a as a fighting weapon
[38:28] and it would have this chain and it
[38:31] would have a ball on it and they will
[38:33] beat the weak like this so understand
[38:37] God had to beat you and harmony we are
[38:40] they will beat you Hank
[38:41] right to get to shuck away in all that I
[38:45] believe that is not right and so they
[38:49] were beated also the heck
[38:51] sar1 like a stick and that stick would
[38:54] just be
[38:55] I look at all of you too so if you want
[38:57] to go look at it later you beat that
[38:59] that that that we in the shop and the
[39:03] scene was separated and did they would
[39:05] never take that Sh um some of the
[39:07] farmers would take remains you all's
[39:10] chaff and all that I don't like but
[39:11] still you had a little bit of stuff left
[39:13] and then they would put you in a machine
[39:16] that would shift you and it will
[39:20] separate the rest of the chaff from you
[39:23] see that's what God does with the church
[39:26] here Peter John can get all that chat
[39:29] out of that I mean at the end of the day
[39:31] would it look like the devil and I could
[39:33] get the bitchin no he's not God is
[39:35] separating the rest of that stuff and it
[39:38] remained the sheen remains
[39:42] hallelujah and it's stealing over yet
[39:45] because to see you've got to be cross in
[39:49] order to bring horsepower but me or
[39:52] whatever for the making of the breath it
[39:54] has to be crossed that's what that's
[40:01] what that's what then is solved things
[40:04] they like the child or the summer fetch
[40:06] info and then when packing it away so
[40:08] that's why when you see people moving it
[40:10] and all of a sudden a moving in groves
[40:12] that's not we're just sweeping through
[40:15] moving all those all those make
[40:17] believers out the way all right
[40:21] hallelujah and the rock itself grew into
[40:24] a mouth listen and the wind pack it away
[40:26] and and the rock itself grew into a
[40:30] great mountain that covered the earth
[40:31] what watch the mountain now the mountain
[40:35] cover the earth also we find here in
[40:39] Revelation here he said the kings of the
[40:42] new earth will bring their honor and
[40:45] glory into it in the earth see the New
[40:47] Jerusalem is sitting on this earth it's
[40:50] just changed so you should what you mean
[40:53] he says see you're the same man it
[40:56] statue that you was when God called you
[40:59] same woman but you see what it did it
[41:03] was regenerated Nicodemus you must be
[41:07] born
[41:08] a tea the old life pass away the all
[41:12] desire has passed away and when you used
[41:16] to like to drink and cuss and fuss it's
[41:18] due and run around and amaura that that
[41:21] thing just died cheap and then you would
[41:23] say this disparate now you are a deep
[41:26] man right and that's what the world
[41:29] would be the same way redeemed a new
[41:32] heaven and a new earth come on now you
[41:34] understand what he's saying if God
[41:37] please your evening with no demon no
[41:40] devil no nothing would ever show up
[41:42] again what about us I believe that's
[41:45] right brother brother said the bride
[41:47] will become so much like him and they
[41:48] won't know what to do it hi

[41:54] a lie but you know what it comes by

[43:09] completely forms himself in you you're
[43:11] now standing as a perfect man in the
[43:13] statue of Christ and then exemplifying

[1:04:43] he was your over all completely he was
[1:04:46] your over and yet he was a man he all

[1:07:54] this thing so perfectly brother with
[1:07:56] sisters we we don't have no excuse ego
[1:07:58] to bring us through all I love the Lord
[1:08:00] Amen I'm so grateful because I trust you
[1:08:04] yes all I can say man you know I have no
[1:08:07] human f I have no effort I have no no no
[1:08:10] no where they skate out to faith and
[1:08:13] whatever it takes God to do to cleanse
[1:08:17] all that need to be cleaned out of me I
[1:08:20] want him to do a people matter you know
[1:08:22] I can see some of the beatings we all go
[1:08:25] through it or whatever it takes - if you
[1:08:28] gotta beat this mo betta Simone I wanted
[1:08:31] to crush my soul I am yes I can be seen
[1:08:33] it right I don't want to die with my
[1:08:35] life
[1:08:36] all the die with you is like a man right
[1:08:38] because of a down his life I won't pass
[1:08:40] any magazine for living like I was said
[1:08:43] it tells about I'm closing people say
[1:08:47] well they say God my brother balance it
[1:08:53] he ain't dead he's right but you know
[1:09:01] what
[1:09:02] Jesus told us how that works he said
[1:09:07] Lazarus is sleeping and the Bible said
[1:09:11] the people didn't understand what he was
[1:09:12] talking about him and then he brought it
[1:09:14] to their terms Lazarus is dead
[1:09:18] so it all depends on where you're
[1:09:20] looking
[1:09:22] Booya but there is a grave with a man's
[1:09:25] body down there like it was with Lazarus
[1:09:28] and there's a man up there like it was
[1:09:32] with Laughing Man y'all you I'm saying
[1:09:34] so it all depends on your terminology or
[1:09:37] what you think about but William Branham
[1:09:39] in this body part is dead measure in his
[1:09:43] spirit of soldiers alive hey I'm
[1:09:45] wonderful
[1:09:45] so with the reason why I said that the
[1:09:48] car a lot of people almost use him as a
[1:09:50] mediator they don't say it right but
[1:09:53] they do I'm so glad for Paul and I'm so
[1:09:59] glad for brother Brandon amen
[1:10:01] you know why because brother Brennan
[1:10:03] said I preached it just like Paul and
[1:10:06] Paul said I don't need to know nothing
[1:10:08] say Jesus Christ hey is that too tough
[1:10:15] no sir
[1:10:15] no I came how they spend it with people
[1:10:17] too when he go ride this trail again
[1:10:19] what you think he doing
[1:10:21] he who remember when they said Moses
[1:10:25] tell my Malta's he said 'keep moses he
[1:10:27] knowses
[1:10:28] right he explained any Moses doing it
[1:10:31] I'm doing it how would you help doing
[1:10:34] that well we know love Moses loop read
[1:10:37] the scripture Jesus caught that
[1:10:39] carnality and then he had to tell them
[1:10:41] no my father ain't mad because it's
[1:10:44] always been my father whenever Moses and
[1:10:47] my father using motive matter right
[1:10:51] that's just good to Moses I have come
[1:10:53] down to deliver my people people get all
[1:11:00] nervous but I'm a Jason I know it's a
[1:11:02] fine line and God knows I know what I'm
[1:11:03] saying amen that's right you know but
[1:11:07] you got to realize that people that con
[1:11:09] man because their carnality they take it
[1:11:11] to a common place and you can't do that
[1:11:13] and worship God that's what the prophets
[1:11:15] said I believe that brother Fredo when
[1:11:17] he said when John fell down to worship
[1:11:19] and he said no no I'm your servant of
[1:11:22] the prophets get up from there worship
[1:11:25] God hang on that's right I believe that
[1:11:27] was brother Brennan that's right because
[1:11:29] out of between Paul and brother brother
[1:11:32] had a script here call say you you you
[1:11:34] receive
[1:11:35] Jesus Christ himself man you would have
[1:11:37] plucked your eyes I've had me so Paul
[1:11:40] head and deal with the same kind of
[1:11:42] stuff that's great
[1:11:44] just like GTECH brother l had to deal
[1:11:46] with Oh me if we go please just message
[1:11:49] we must preach it away brother Brownback
[1:11:52] give it all forward to the Lord I don't
[1:11:57] know what you know you'll never say well
[1:11:58] you can't say brother brems lame in here
[1:12:00] you don't know if we say that but my
[1:12:03] point is and all that I say I realize
[1:12:06] what's coming from hey man that's what
[1:12:11] you need to know you love God and I am
[1:12:14] we're fortunate let's stand we're
[1:12:16] fortunate I don't know how else to say
[1:12:19] it I think about all of the people that
[1:12:22] I just seem to be you know getting
[1:12:25] confused and falling away I don't even
[1:12:29] understand how people leave this and go
[1:12:31] back to denominations Ixtapa I don't
[1:12:33] understand yours you know I'm not
[1:12:36] boasting like I'm something cuz I know
[1:12:38] it's just a grace of God but it's never
[1:12:40] been in me I tell you what folks if I
[1:12:43] had to leave this I go back into the
[1:12:44] world you will find me in no church
[1:12:47] because you know what I know I'm a I'm
[1:12:49] worshiping to them you know what I'm
[1:12:51] saying
[1:12:52] why go in another Church you know and
[1:12:54] remember say that's what they do it cuz
[1:12:56] see this is the hour you must worship
[1:12:58] God in spirit and in truth you go to the
[1:13:02] you know what wakes people out of an
[1:13:03] organizational ISM his election ma'am

[1:13:18] I might make this Agreement feel their
[1:13:21] brother Brendan said you can be hatched
[1:13:24] under a cheeky
[1:13:26] amen amen hungry get a ready I really do
[1:13:33] that means I could go in a denomination
[1:13:35] if they got the spirit hard enough God
