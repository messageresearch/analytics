chapter 23 verse verse 11 amen the Bible here says that and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear weakness also at Rome amen this was a promise that God told God give to Paul and Paul been Ser Paul has been serving God for years amen he knows exactly when God talks to him amen he knows exactly that When God Says something that thing has to happen amen so when Paul when when when the the angel of the Lord appeared to Paul and told him that he will have to be God's witness in Rome amen Paul knew that he will not die he will before he he will not die but but he will get to Rome amen Paul knew that what Whatever May Come amen he will not die because he had a promise amen that he will have to be God's weakness in Rome amen that's the same thing with David he had an anointing from from God Amen God anointed David to become a king so it didn't matter if David had to face the Li it didn't matter if David had to face the bear even even when Goliath came amen David did not back up David did not Shake amen because he knew that he had a promise that before he dies amen he will have to become a king first so Paul had this promise amen that before he dies amen he will have to go to Rome amen but notice one thing here amen God did not tell Paul what Paul had to go through amen Paul that God did not tell Paul what he will have to go through amen God told him that he will have to go to Rome to amen and Paul knew that he will have to go to Rome but Paul did not know how he will have to go to Rome amen so right after that Vision right after that visitation of you read the in the next verse you see that the Bible says that more than 40 people starting starting to fast fasting so that they can kill Paul amen here is Paul the verse before that amen God told him that you will have to go to Rome but right after that test become amen right after that visitation the devil now started to is trying to shake Paul amen first of all he had more than 40 people to fast amen they had the mind made their minds made up that Paul will have to die amen they decided to kill Paul amen and then somebody there was a sister that was among them was among them when they went to when they went to the king amen she heard it then she went to tell Paul amen Paul did not Shake amen Paul did not start to think but God you told me that I will go to but here are 40 people about to kill me Lord how am I going to go to Rome if people are against Paul did not ask those questions Paul did not doubt amen but he still believed God amen and then the following verses shows how Paul was brought to judgment amen and Paul then requested to be heard by Caesar amen now we jump to verse uh verse 20 uh 27 amen that's when Paul now the journey started amen the first thing that happened amen a strong wind started to blow amen a tempest started amen the Bible even named the name of that temp the Bible named it euron amen that was the that was the uh uh the wind of of I think West and and and and north or something like that am the devil now starting to Temp Paul the devil starting to attack so notice that when Paul was doing that Journey amen he was close to Winter amen first of all he was cold amen and this one was different than his others Journey other Journey because this one he wasn't going as a free man amen but he was going as a prisoner amen so you take all the Comforts away there W no Comfort at all amen he had his hand all tied up amen and he was cold and now the devil decided to kill him because he knew man because he knew that God had some God had a work to to do with amen he brought that with strong amen and that wind wreck the Sheep amen throughout that Journey amen Paul did not doubt God Amen the prophet says in in a message proving his words amen paragraph 25 it says that I want to speak just a few moments and that will be just a few moments because I want to get them people with the prayer cards up here and pray for them and omitting any other any other thing but just praying for the sick now listen the prophet says that but before we pray for the sick we've got to get the people in that itude amen he says that it's the attitude that always brings results it's the attitude that it's the attitude that you take towards God Amen that's the thing that brings results amen it's the good attitude always brings results amen that was the attitude of Paul amen if we reading uh uh acts chap 27 verse 20 acts 27 verse 20en the Bible here says and when neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us the Bible here says that Paul is testifying he said that all hope that we should be saved was then taken away amen they looked at the they looked at the The Tempest amen they looked at the situation amen they they saw how impossible it was to survive amen the Bible said that all hope that we should be saved was taken away amen so according to themselves there was they were going to die amen this was beyond the human effort amen this was beyond a human's ability amen death was coming death was knocking at the door people starting to be to be afraid amen some people started to cry amen some people started to think I should have stayed home some of them even say that I had a bad dream today I should have listened to myself and Paul noticed the atmosphere that was going on Paul noticed the doubts that was coming to people amen now in verse 21 of that same chap amen Paul says that Paul D but after long AB abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sir you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crit and to have gained this harm and loss now verse 22 it says that and now I exalt you to be of good cheer so how are there going to be of good cheer When Death was coming some of them might stop Paul say stop Paul stop a little bit amen we facing reality here amen we're not on land but we we we on the sea amen and and then there's a tempest coming Tempest so tell me how are we going to survive if we decide to swim amen those waves will kill us amen so tell me how are we going to survive amen Paul continue and say for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but for but of the sheep for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God has given thee all them that sa with thee amen wherefore s be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me amen I believe God Amen that's a song we sing I know who I am believe amen I know who I am believe amen we have to know who will believe we have to know that God who believe Amen to know that when times gets hard Amen to know that when all the odds are against us amen the angel of the Lord will always Camp around us amen when the doctor say that you can't get well amen when the doctor says that you can't walk when the doctor says that you can't talk amen always remember that the angel of the Lord is with you God has the last word amen when all hope was gone amen they were facing death amen Paul stood up it says that I know who I am beli amen I know who I have believed I know who give the promise and that God has never failed me amen and he won't start now he's never failed me before amen and he won't start now when people Stone me to death amen that God brought me up amen when I was in prison amen that God Set Me Free amen so I faced death before and here I am still breathing so this Same Old Devil that's coming he's not different from the one that came before amen because I was an overcomer there amen I will still be an overc amen this is the same devil amen just changing his mask but I still believe in that same God who from Genesis amen he started to be from Genesis amen he started to have victory over the devil amen now it's not a time that he will fail he won't fail now so no matter what your circumstances are am know that God won't fail now no matter what the situation is know that God will never fail you he gave you that promise that you will be with him by his side he gave you that promise that you will be with him in his throne so no matter what come what may come no that God gave the promise I know the Finish Line amen so no matter I can I I will go through amen that will not mean that will not mean anything amen because I know where I'm going amen I know where I'm going amen I know where I'm supposed to be amen because God gave me that promise amen Paul said be of good cheer amen no matter what's going to your in your life amen be of good cheer amen because the god whom I believe the God that I serve will not fail me amen when all hope was gone amen Paul could stay there and say do not fear amen because God spoke to him amen because he had Faith amen When Trials came Paul did not forget God Paul did not forget his

of the mar he set us free from the prison amen and that same God will stand by amen don't be like the disciples when the disciples were in the ship with Jesus remember they were coming from a Revival meeting amen they saw how Jesus healed the people they saw of all kinds of Miracles that Jesus they were all excited about it some of them even said that I will be a changed man Peter could say John

fighting against a defeated amen the devil was already deed defeated on the cross amen we have to walk into it like it's something that we have inherit walk as our inheritance go claim your victory in closing I'll read in the message Elijah and the meal offering paragraph 57 the prophet says oh there it was and and when they walked into the fire F under trial under a test they held true to the end but God was there just in a spare of a moment and he delivered them they know that they were prayed up there sins were confessed they know that they had met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent he's only silent to test you to see really what you are what's on the inside of you see if you really mean from your heart what saying yourp let that go deep we can say with our lips but is our heart saying it amen they weren't there prayed up they confessed all the amen they were like job amen confessing all their sin in other words it did not have any reproach amen you couldn't go back and point to something amen because when you confess your sins the balance is to zero amen there were there righteous amen people thought that there would be happy all there will be you know have an easy life but there the fire was before them God was silent amen he wasn't silent because he didn't careen God was not silent because he did not hear the prayer amen God was not silent because he because he was but because he couldn't hear amen but he was silent Amen to show the people amen what they believe Amen to show people amen that he has true he has his children on Earth amen he was silent Amen to prove to see if they really believed what they were saying with their amen it's easy to to say that we believe but when the when when the trial are you going to be Paul or are you going to be the children of Israel are you going to be Paul to stand there and remember what God told you or are you going to be the children of Israel to forget everything that happened am notice that the children of Israel amen they had more experiences than most of us here in this room amen they've seen God in all kinds of way amen but when the hunger came when they were hungry they forsook God when they were thirsty they fors God they say where brother Isaac those are only Small Things hunger how canot forsake God when amen you also do have your own trials what's your attitude what your attitude when you're facing your Tri what your attitude when you pray and it seems like you answer is not coming do you keep on believe do you still believe or do you still complain amen but we have to be like Paul amen When Death was coming death was knocking at the door he stood up and said be of good cheer because God gave me a promise that I will not die until I go preach so I believe that I will not die until I get to Rome God gave you a promise amen he gave you a promise of a city not built by man's hand he gave you a promise of the new jerus he gave you a promise of being with him in his throne amen know that God's promise is true amen and it will come to pass but what is our attitude amen if you don't have faith amen you still can pray and say Lord help down my amen be like Gideon amen he asked God Sons three times amen but still he was still afraid amen God God understood that Gideon was afraid amen he still helped him out amen because he was talking to him amen because he had a good relationship he remember the prophet says that they were all prayed up and they confessed all their SS and God was there to help them amen the song leader can come and we can stand amen and pray God Amen to increase our faith it's natural as human forget amen it's natural as human Amen to be afraid when hard times are coming it's natural as human when the doctor say that you can't survive Amen to start planning about your death and Stat that you will leave your your children it's as human like Paul said that you know but we Our Hope was gone no way we could have survived but always remember God gave you a promise that he will always be with you that his angels will always come so don't forget that promise amen always believe in God Amen God bless [Applause] you song Christ amen let's
