TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he set up you know I can't be late we don't want you to feel that way it's not our intent that is not not even God but we want to thank God for all of you we'd rather you be late coming in than not coming off so we want to make sure that you understand that you love the Lord we appreciate once again brother Frank will be doing song service or learning he used to do it over there in the kola' Congo and wherever he else he was but anyway I told him I warned him not only just the singling English songs but I want him to also do some French songs so everybody could be more involved amen y'all need to learn some English and we need to learn some French amen so we appreciate everything and and so he was happy and by God's grace we'll try them out this evening Lord's will I am I think brother for the Isaac ask for the rich and I sold brother had already talked with the brother as a brother ritual mine so I know him that much I know you feel like a burden off his back so amen we love the Lord amen when you see talent or gifts we need to use it amen and the brothers come in and humbly sit there and you know the only person I've never heard seeing his brother my sister are fuzzy I don't even know where she can sing or not we got to find that out she sits there quietly comes in like that no a member we love the Lord we love the people of God amen in moments like these when I brother said today about Cyrus he was a great man our anointed him make sure Israel went back home and just as God has anointed Cyrus it is true I don't believe God would allow Trump's face to be on a call if he wasn't being anointed by God to do what he's doing when it comes to Israel now we may not agree with everything that he's doing because I don't but at the same time God has him dead and we must respect and honor the office and I am truly excited about this time I'm almost like a mother about ready to give birth she's excited but she's afraid to you know there's something in her that makes her excited but she's a nervous too because she's never especially the first-time mothers you've not been there before and so I know everything is getting ready to really move in a fast way we see seven ballot and everybody else over there in Israel trying to stop this thing from happening but they can't stop it because this is the hand of God we see you know a lot of people don't may not even think about it but I want just to make put it in your mind that this volcano over there in Hawaii is not just trying to display so itself so you can see the wonderful works of nature but you must understand that they're undercurrents things that God is moving and pushing and setting in order because we know by God's grace the prophecy is that California will have this major earthquake and you got to understand the the default that's on Washington State over there they said it's just like the one that was brought that great tsunami to Japan so we know by God's grace is locked and ready and we just need our sense you know God he's waiting on us we said Oh Lord I'm waiting on you no no no no no God is waiting on us because the Bible said the bride made herself ready right so you and I must understand and and I'm not trying to put fear I'm trying to place excitement you know because God said you know in that day that you when you when you see that they approach and you need to come together the more I know that many people are cutting out the evening service on Sundays I can't do it and my thing is if it's only one or two people coming on evening we'll just have to come one or two you know because I believe that we ought to come together the more I don't know about you but I need more word I need more encouragement I need I need more that now than ever before and I don't want the enemy to get me in a place where I feel and you know how it is we all know that it is election but I don't ever want the devil to really doe that in my senses I'm elected I got it all made and I'm gonna make a rapture the Bible says you must be on fire and I believe that's the way we're going to be I appreciate the message absolute it was wonderful and our brother sent that to me it was really good to me I'm still listening to it because I believe that this message is our absolute and therefore we we we don't have to worry about anything because God has made himself known to us let's stand so I can get right into the Word of God last week we we started on the union with God and His creation started that on Wednesday we want to pick it up again today - this morning - to just really try to get to you the the the thought or the revelation or really what God is doing in our day in the midst of mystery of God revealed brother Branham tells us that that everything that he was preaching in that particular message is like it's like the capstone of it all the whole Bible this whole Bible declares Jesus Christ and he said that if you can read this Bible and not see Christ he said you got a you got to read it over again and so we we thank God for a messenger in this day we're not a worshipper of him we don't set his image before us we don't bow down to him because he did not reflect his image he reflected the image of Jesus Christ and that is the Lord God that we serve this morning and as Paul said I am the hallelujah oh I feel pretty good this morning I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I'm sorry that was another kind of eruption oh I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it is the power of God unto salvation let us turn to Deuteronomy 31 and 3 surely God is good to us in how can you stop praising God when he's been so good to you he's been better to us and we've been to ourselves Deuteronomy 31 and 6 be strong and of a good courage fear not not be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth do go with thee he will not fail thee well I love that nor forsake thee is that Alright st. John 14 17 through 21 17 through 21 even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him well he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you right let me go hit on down yet a little while the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in the father ye and me and I in you that is so powerful let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we pray this morning that you would have preeminence in the service Lord we want you to be everything to us we want you to be our judge we want you to be our friend correct us love us whatever we need Lord each and every one of us have different needs this morning whatever we need to take another step forward help us dear Jesus forgive us Lord of any and everything we've done wrong that your name may be glorified in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated he that he hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and this is where I met and will manifest myself to him and I believe by God's grace that we're living in the age and a day that it is God's timing to manifest himself to us we have seen a lot of things especially in this message we have seen all kinds of doctrines come and go we've seen me and rise and we've seen them fall but the thing that we need to see more than anything is Jesus himself not in another man or another woman but we need to see Jesus in us Lord I want to see Jesus in me you know because that is the witness that is your absolute many people read this Bible many people read the message books and yet they have never seen it in them they've seen him in the prophet they've seen him in other places amen but the important part today is to see him in you not in your head cause even the devil knows the message in his head but when Christ is in your heart he has to live is that right oh you and I must understand there's so many people and and as we were expressing on Wednesday how God is seen in everything the Bible said the earth declares his glory the heavens his handiwork hallelujah there is no way of getting away from him he is in you above you with you around you he's everywhere so that you can understand brother banner tells us that before God was God he was just God hello him lol I Elohim the very self existing one hallelujah don't you understand that before God before there was air God had to make the end hallelujah God don't have to live off and God is God he is the word and so before they were air before they were anything that could sustain life in his natural forces elements God created it all is that all right so you understand Amen that even as David said lord if I make my bed in hell die out there hallelujah if I fly to the almost party earth there's no escaping you Lord because thou are there hallelujah and then we find out through this message Amen that we understand that God is omniscient that means that he's everywhere hallelujah not by him by just being here and then here and there but we found out that we had a man of God that could tell us because God knows everything he's everywhere hallelujah I never understood it hey man how God could break himself up into pieces and still be God hallelujah Amen never losing one counts of his power or his authority hallelujah oh but I hear by God's grace that a brother came and he's preached on the seed and I thought about that seed I said can you imagine a country hallelujah Amen or mustard seed one of the smallest seeds never imagined that it could produce a tree as large as it grown hallelujah so in in that scenario I want you to see by God's grace you and I Paul said heís that without seen nor ear have heard hallelujah what God Hanson's or ended into the hearts of man what God has in store for us hallelujah all we talk about all when I get there I have a glorified body we don't even know what it is hallelujah we talked about all mind at the alphadon we don't know what it is hallelujah but all when it happens somebody help me here somebody help me you see because all those things that we can't see clearly will be made clear to us hallelujah there will be nothing that you won't know oh you tell me said Brotherhood's what are you saying because even jesus told his disciples you know all things is that okay I'm talking about blending and you know when Jesus stood there and Saint John 10 and 30 I love that scripture where he says I and my father are one hallelujah and did you not know that the persecution really didn't come until Jesus declared that he and his father was one the Bible said they wanted to stone him for it he said watch domine why you seek to stone me he said because you were being a man trying to make yourself God hallelujah but brother Brennan said what it was it wasn't that he was being a man trying to make it look God it was God making himself a man hallelujah and now we see in the series very same word God is doing a new creation so that's what we must understand we are a new creation as long as the delicate make you feel like you are parents job job best the way you're going to feel hallelujah but if you have met Jesus on the backside of the desert if you have met him in your private secret room whatever Amen you met him you met him hallelujah you have been changed somebody help me you have been changed from death unto life you're not a pastor job you are new creature is that right even closer it does not yet appear what we gonna be like but one thing for sure we'll be just like him I want you to think about that for a moment think about there for a moment just like God whew somebody helped me standing at the door and knock in 1957 he says when Christ was on earth in a physical corporal body as we stand today he walked in Galilee and different places there he claimed not to have power to heal the sick or to perform miracles he said I can do nothing in myself I do nothing till first the father showed me and what to do anyone knows the scripture st. John 5 knows that's the truth he did not perform any miracles until the father showed him he said verily verily I say unto you the son himself the tabernacle the God dwell in him his body the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise hallelujah even though we become in the image of lightening of God we still have a head hallelujah and that hand ship is Jesus Christ himself is that right a man you can't just say well I got it and I'm gonna just do what I want to do hallelujah that's not the way it worked hallelujah remember I preached about the will and I showed you Amen that was the very thing that Lucifer did when he adopted his own will that's when he pushed and moved himself out of the out of God's will because you cannot serve God by your will it's not him that will it no he that run it but it's God who shows mercy so you can't just will it accept God allow you to will it and gave you the wheel to will it hallelujah now some of y'all looking at me like y'all sick this morning I hope you're alright we'll be praying for you but you know we look at this thing and wish you all brother whoops are you in your right mind I hope I'm not I don't want to be in my right mind I want to be in his mind man what is it we're coming I don't you see in your right mind you can't in your right mind you can't imagine becoming God or even a part of God although the peace of God you can't even imagine it cuz you know every piece and every part of God is perfect how they knew yet there's no imperfection inning hallelujah so you and I can't even imagine what imperfection of perfection is because all our lives we've seen imperfection we don't even fully understand grace because grace is when you don't have to do nothing to get something and in this world in order to guess something you got to work you got to do something here to get something there hallelujah but not when it comes to God Holly Lou is that right that's what the Bible says the gift of God is given to men without repentance you don't even have to be saved they have a gift from God he gave that to you as a token of his love before you even got into this world y'all hear what I'm saying she weak but with us in order for us to give a gift somebody has to behave well that's the way we're taught you be good I'll be good to you come on somebody but the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us hallelujah that's why we love this amazing grace hallelujah ain't God good to us hallelujah listen it is the only ground we could have fellowship because remember when I loose affirm I you know I really don't like calling Lucifer that old devil when that old devil amen found his own will and you know this is the part I was talking to a brother about I said Jesus God saw the will of Lucifer and still allowed him to preach knowing he was going to preach his own doctrine hallelujah and God allowed him to preach his own doctrine we don't know how I'm alone but a third of how many more Amen was literally taken by Lucifer's doctrine dangers failed angels develop their own will and made that will against God's will like Lucifer and what the Lucifer promised them fame popularity hallelujah and that's exactly what the devil does he promise you something huh y'all don't believe it he told Eve you gonna be let you gonna be as God and is she not the woman is worship everywhere you go in the world she's worship like I said even when you're selling a bad a truck she's the one standing on the side of it hallelujah is that right you're never gonna see Amen a man named his truck after another man he's gonna name that truck Suzie a Bessie or something but he'll never name that truck dawn or Michael she's worship why because it's a male/female thing well somebody help me that's what it was in the beginning God had a feminine attribute in him hallelujah and he needed to express that ah my god think about it God even in his own mind thought we know one day I'm gonna have me a wedding somebody help me I'm gonna have me a wedding and I'm gonna have me a bride hallelujah and we're gonna be united as one this wedding that I have is going to be perfect everything I know she like will be there hallelujah every color every fragrant everyone everything hallelujah in other words I'm the one that's coordinating the whole thing yeah that one is important man when he was in Adam all she knew was Adam it was after God separate her that Satan was able to seduce her to think in her own mind as you heard me say there was a time where her mind was his mind was God's mind and her mind was Adams mind and they all thought the same thing that God's Word is God's Word and whatever God said we're going to do hallelujah and tada no slicker who all had already practice and heaven right he slid it all around there and then began to tell her you know what you can be an independent woman I'm sorry I don't want to be an independent woman uh-huh come on when it comes to God I want God to be my head Alleluia all right now and it is the only grounds of fellowship because you got to understand that's how it started in the beginning and that's the way it must end hallelujah now we look at this thing that says it's a new creature you are a new creature in Christ what we fail to see is that we look at this over old thing and you know we think well that's me this is not me this is dead it's been judged hallelujah it's gonna is going to dissolve it's gonna break down somebody help me but while this thing is breaking down I'm still living everybody in this in this place we know don't we know don't we know that no matter how old you get yo your inside is still young that's how I hurt my knee I forgot momentarily I'm not as young as I used to be right and you say what what brothers what are you trying to say because that part of you will never grow Oh hallelujah is that all right now we you and I must understand so I'm glad about it brother brother rich and brother you know brother Keith and and and and Mike and all of you I am so happy one of the things I'm happy about Amen because I'm looking at a Ararat a union that is now changing me not you may not see it like I may not see it happening in you but it's literally happening I'm literally turning Amen from Mortal to immortality is that right brother branham said that when when God gave that promised to Abraham and Sarah it was like a process it was a process happening so he allowed us to see that this eternal life is a process hallelujah the last thing to be changed in you is this but your character your life your strain hallelujah even if it's just changes law into law into Christ brother madam senator like this he said that cosmic life the eternal light replaces the cosmic light and all of us were born with cosmic light hallelujah but this eternal light is now pushing that cosmic light out of your body and as it pushes the cosmic light out guess what happens you start seeing a change oh brother you looking younger thank you how do you you amen it comes with the salvation oh come on I'm telling you something so you can realize that man you can rebuke start rebuking his old age spirit hallelujah amen God God know what I'm saying God know what I'm trying to tell you this Union this union is so powerful what I was thinking you know it is a oneness of himself in the people you see because it's not you it's not you that can do this it's God at some point this generation that we're now living in will change from old to young and it doesn't say Amen at what point in time a bruh and Sarah turned back to the young it doesn't say it gave him a promise but that portion of the scripture is silent but we do know one thing when she got down there to that King he had turned and so did she right so it wasn't their doing it was God's doing but one thing for certain it was recognizable Abraham could see that Sarah had changed hallelujah and Sarah could see that Abraham had changed oh don't get don't get be too concerned my thing is this brother Branham said it like this he said it might cause persecution to bring us to that place he said but in other words God's gonna allow it to happen y'all you understand me see this is what's happening now the real trial of this message is now sifting and sifting out and and literally it's separating everything that is not hallelujah y'all hear me that's what's happening so what I'm trying to tell you is that you gotta fight don't let the devil make you turn your back on this truth because that's his job the Deaf age is walking and he looking to see who got it who's dumb who don't who doesn't now you said what do you mean I mean that's a cold eye I have it somewhere where he's we working with a time and you know it's harder how many y'all can say it's difficult it is it's difficult to pray it's difficult to fast it's difficult to read your word hallelujah it is difficult to show brotherly kindness hello it's difficult you see that the devil just coming in and attacking in every way what is he doing he's he couldn't he can't dude except God gave him grace to do it I say grace permission to do it and his permission is chipping everything all amen so that when God make his move he's got the real thing you see what I'm saying and when he's done this by this bride still will need a revival Oh somebody help me why because you know I am faulty but I am elected to be bride hallelujah I'm not where I used to be and that way I want to be I'm not in where I ought to be hallelujah but like I said but I'm not where you used to be so I know I traveled I know there is a change and I know my destiny is perfection so you got to know that no matter what you go through you must know your destiny is perfection not by him that will it nor he that run it but God that shows mercy you know what I'm gonna tell you something that's one of the hardest thing for us to fully understand is that God loves you and spider sometimes we things and and we preach things that we know that you know already and you know it's not against people it's not against any individual it's basically saying hey we know who you are you know you need to know who you are and this is not the way you should look this is not the way you should do hallelujah see because it's never you know we say touch not taste my hand or not that's not even that's garlic that ain't what God looking at it wouldn't be grace yeah hello it wouldn't even be grace if it was long hallelujah you say well what do you mean brother Brooks remember the preacher that died our drunkard brother branham said he was saying hallelujah the Prophet God said you can be insane and have the Holy Ghost and don't y'all feel like that sometime it's the truth because this is where your mind battle you battling right here but your absolute is right here when this fails you got something says I never leave your nor will I forsake you be not afraid hallelujah see you know how many of us we want to be one with him sometimes we have bad thoughts and we like lord it's that from my head of my heart anybody know what I'm talking about because you want to know where is this star coming from is it from my head or my heart even in my head lord help me if it's in my heart Lord take it away you wouldn't even be a true child of God if you didn't want that devil out of your life and that's what makes you know that you're different Devas love to be Devils yeah I'm I'm not ready to do I'm feeling very good this morning why because I see what he's doing one of these old days it's gonna happen in the twinkling of an eye and I be able to walk through the wall I'll be able to go through the ceiling what is it because God is all and in all he's everywhere you see all of these things right here you don't see it it looks solid but all these things are just molecules every every one of these things that you call solid can be moved through and there's a force they say it's called a wave that's holding everything together even your own body darling area you say that ain't true that's why brother Brown say that Kingdom will slow down and we'll speed up somebody help me because we see by God's grace amen that we have been what resurrected huh brother brought you you've been resurrected I've been resurrected hallelujah you have been resurrected hallelujah to do what died no more you love the Lord he said the only way that you could have those grounds is by Union to be united with him just like when you United with your husband the woman to unite with her husband and there's a vow unto death then when you are united with God it's the same thing that the church United with Christ why because God is Christ and Christ is God hallelujah I didn't say Jesus I said Christ is God because Christ gives the Holy Ghost Christ is the anointed Jesus was the blood sacrifice and in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily but a new person it was one in other words there was a union you said when did the Union take place when John said he saw a dove come down and lit upon him at the river of Jordan and the father said this is my beloved son and who I'm well pleased to dwell in well he was the word Moses was the word but Moses didn't become empowered until he met the purifier Jesus was born the word he was able to turn water into wine hallelujah but then when he got in there and the Holy Ghost came and filled him oh I know y'all don't know what I'm talking about some of y'all a ok talking yeah you got to speak the way the scripture says it the holy king goes came down and filled him and his father said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in that's when man and God became one hallelujah then he goes into the into the UH into the wilderness and he suffers and he for forty days and after that his greatest challenge was Lucifer himself all right he comes along and he said I'd give you this if you turn this stone into bread oh my you don't think it was hungry he with the bottle said he was hungry was it God or the man that was hungry it was the man hallelujah but then he that same man said man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of mouth of God hallelujah what was he saying yes it might be my will to eat this bread but I'm not living by my will I'm by his will and I can't do nothing except I see the father do it brother bream said when he took him up to that pinnacle up there says I give you America I give you Germany I give you all the cities of the world hallelujah if you just bow down hallelujah you say bow down to you huh uh-uh tell them get behind me you should worship the Lord thy God right in other words I'm your God you need to bow to me Oh hallelujah the prodigal said he knew it all of this one day we'll be here come do you really think God won't New York as it is thank you brother no I wouldn't want it I don't want California as it is I don't want Texas I don't want the morning Eddie as it is I'm because it's full of troubles full of violence but one of these old days because of his blending because of his union come on you said well what do you mean brother Brooks in the book of Acts about said all power in heaven and earth was given to who Jesus who the eternal God the creator of all things hallelujah then jesus said this same power after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you I'm gonna give you the same power not a different power that's why the proud of God expresses we must have the same results right if we got the same spirit it must be the same result in everything all lord have mercy upon us you love the Lord yes he said don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a creative being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters not son some other spirit but the same spirit of the Living God because we become sons and daughters hallelujah now this part here is a byproduct but the Holy Ghost is the same spirit that's what he said that's the difference right we're just a byproduct here but the real thing that real thing only inside has United us with the eternal God proving that even when he was Ella him we were there even when he was Ella him we were there we were thoughts we were attributes hallelujah and we can eat that cannot change this is God's drama this is God's playing God created all things for his pleasure and his goodwill hallelujah it doesn't matter he could have made me a donkey and I still would have been satisfied he could have made me a frog like I said the other day frogs can't even sing the jingle stopped him from breathing their proper on they make all that noise cry because they're praising God for being a frog you listen to their toes Birds first always out there singing all the time amen it could have just stormed and everything is and the first thing you hear after storm is the sound of a bird I love that sound hallelujah the storm is passing no I could almost see him you know praising God because the storm is passed over hallelujah and they still surviving hallelujah cheak God put himself together yeah I mean he broke himself up and now he's bringing him back I love that I love that I love that amen because that's what he did he said brother what are you saying he took those 12 disciples broke that bread and then then when he broke that bread all up together he brought it all back in the upper room hallelujah what was it one loaf one bread one body hallelujah there are nothing struck them see that's why it's so important that we be unified and that's what sating is doing right now see you cannot be in you in God and yet be separate I'm from among each other you know God taught me something the last time we had a communion we had it in the morning will not do that ever again we're do it evening or night and my reason for doing that even though I may not see I said what is great your ceremony and that's what we don't all spoke to me doing this or loving her brother I'm not here to offend anyone Paul said if even eat meat with a fender brother he said I won't even eat no meat now for the older of us who love me you know that was a great sacrifice and I don't believe that Paul said that just to be religious he meant it and I saw to myself I said Lord my love was not and it's not and I was not at that time where it should have been hello the most important thing is communion is to bring us together not separate us is that right okay I had to confess that because he told me to there's not one person here I don't love and care about that's why sometimes I get on your nerves sometime I know what I'm striking something but one thing for certain you better know that everything I say is because I love and care for you I don't you know we don't have this big glorious church and that's fine because I read it this way you know if I in contact you know your spirit and work with you like that it's okay like Abraham if God has given me as a shepherd I don't believe in losing wine to the devil and understand that everything that I do is inspired because I love your soul I can see things you can't see but I'm and I'm not gonna let the devil just take you many times you don't see me but I'll be praying whenever God brings you to my heart I pray hallelujah all right I may not be one-to-one on you but I'm there praying for you and I hope by God's grace you're praying for me cuz I need your prayers I won't give up on no one you know and I look at this thing and I said I know many times people don't understand but I don't come to church to show off y'all understand me you may not believe this but by God's grace I really do believe if I wanted to be in the top ten I could be and I don't say that to brag but I don't try to show you how much knowledge I have that's not important the most important thing is to see that this church get the token and see it all on display that's it some of y'all I'm gonna tell you don't don't ever come in here but I know that and I know that and I know that see that's the devil talking to you because when you know that and know that and then that life is not being produced in what how much do you know my thing in my a man I'm off my scripture my thing in my aim is to bring us in such a union with God that we can feel it we can know it right you don't need y'all y'all how many husbands and wives you live so well together so you think alike sometimes you come up with the same words at the same time let's do this let's go there same thing why because you have so Leah 90 and i'ma tell you something I have not seen a marriage yet they have been so good so much together and then they start looking like each other it's the way it is anyway let's move on you love the Lord so I want you to understand my heart I want you to understand amen whatever message I bring it is for you and that's what you need to say Lord what what what is it in this message that I need to hear not with my head with my heart you know the Lord see Pentecost is not an organization Pentecostals and experience that anyone can have and I was thinking about the prophet of God when he didn't know God he said I didn't even know how to to say my ABC I didn't even know how to pray so I said ABC DL he talked about a story on that right he said and he said wouldn't when he wanted God he said he didn't even know how but he said God I know you hear me I know you hear me and I know he said if my if this this cross if this blood is for me the Lord you know reappear here because what happened we confess his sin and ask God to come into his heart amen a cross came down and he said to God if that be you do it again show me though because I don't know your language and you may know mine but I don't know your language show me in the message absolutely says it and and you say Oh after a while he said oh he said he said I waited to my mom my mom said Billy you just nervous he said I don't know what it is he said but all of a sudden he just got out there and ran down the track he said he started running wide open he said I didn't even know how to express my feelings amen he's at all but if I knew how to shout he said what I did I just did it my way see you gotta understand make this thing that happens once you realize it and I'm gonna tell you something you'll never get the Holy Ghost until you really see how wretched you are you don't see yourself Richard and the sinner that needs to be saved you'll never get it you got to see yourself worth less you got to see yourself like a worm a maggot one of the most disgusting little creatures ever but you got a yourself like that and really meaning is this God I need your help I need you not only do I need you but I want you I know this wicked knife this thing out here is not me it can't be me I don't enjoy I don't enjoy it it's not what I want I want you you may not feel lightning or thunder boat at the time but something got to happen because the Bible said if a man coming to me he come unto me I will and in no wise cast him out hallelujah even Christ in you is that Alright oh he said remember we are now as his bride preg mated with his spirit all my church bearing children see Prag nated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evidence with the preeminence 'as evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him y'all hear me it is not just carrying a buckle or bad you know saying I'm in the message it's a line and that only comes by a union and the world is supposed to see you said well what do you mean brother Brooks I guarantee you if there are stars out there at night and the clouds are not blocking them you're going to see those stars and so you understand in the darkness of the night each star stands alone huh Dan you see if nobody shows up to the prayer meeting I'll be there see then y'all don't mind do you ok I'm almost done I'm almost done because I see what time it is now I just assumed you come be here this evening brother ok I didn't know whether you scheduled I thought all night I'd already said he's gonna do song service and I don't even know where he's gonna be whether he's gonna be here or not now I just talked fast it y'all understood I get carried away sometime but you know we look at this thing he says listen you do know cuz you're a church member because Christ is living through you you know he says so pregnant it with the spirit that you you're a prisoner to anything else you can find oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you bring can bring forth is that cuz you are prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnant oh now he's not talking that to each other spiritually you can't commit adultery you already pregnant girl already he can't take hold see he can he can't take a hold some of the enemy the womb is of life it's close to anything else you're already here by predestination the seed has come to light no world can get in oh he says how we like to stay on this for about an hour I'm sure you understand see Christ and his alone already finished the sea was there that she was already and when what and when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life as soon as a life-giving flow that seed laying there other seeds that you just would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it what do you mean that's why you couldn't follow my other method is or you couldn't follow the Lutheran and you couldn't follow the cattle and you couldn't follow the Pittock also see it couldn't grab you it couldn't hold you but when this message caught you something exploded something happened on the inside because that was a seed that you were carrying if the seed of the lutheran was in you you would have carried a Lutheran C or Wesleyan seed but because the seed of God is in you you caught this message or this message caught in you hallelujah and you become a prisoner surrounded in Christ Christ in you his life bringing forth his evidence his science he's over my look bringing his signs of life as evidence of the resurrection proving to the world that listen I want to say something that's brother Mike it at a Main Street right the young man Mike they kind of we talked with he came over to my table the other day and started talking and walking in the hallelujah wanted to know the gospel huh hey man we we sit there preaching to him hallelujah and in the next table over there and then they were listening and when he had to go back out off his lunch break the lady looked at me like what was it Amen see people watch your life and I told my said you know I was just thinking about you I said Lord I said I've never invited that man to church yet and here the man comes and he invites himself he said I got a Bible in my glove compartment right now I've tried out this I've tried out that he said and I said no you looking for truth I said brother I can help hallelujah oh my you show all my lord what's what's happening she you know even even the one brother that I couldn't seem to get hold to y'all I want to say his name he might listen to this tape but anyhow amen I was able to give him a church age book he said I'm a reader I said brother you got to read I said if you read this book read it carefully with your Bible everything as I want you to read it I said and when you finish I said if there's nothing there I won't bother you again I might have to repeat but but my tip is to say I'm looking cuz I'm praying God why he read this book may the word god quicken I said brother it will change your life it'll change the way you look at things have you thoroughly read this book the way it is hello see you don't think people looking at started I say I said yeah brother brother rich goes to my church but the Keith goes there I said to almost everybody I come here and with to do lunch or whatever they go to the church he really got excited then so you said what brother was worth it because I said brother whenever I said and he said there I said listen man I said when I cuz he said it and I said come with me amen and you know we just started talking about the Lord I knew there was an attraction and I'm like Lord I need to talk to this man I've talked with the young lady you know we're not y'all y'all y'all I get excited so let me say this before I close because I'm closing I finished this either this evening of whenever but my point is this we getting ready to have this meeting down there in Iowa City I expect everybody to come at least one night you can't make them all that's fine but come when you can and this week we are hoping to get down there by Friday we're going to have some witnessing on the streets amen we're gonna form a choir for those who might want to come we let you know what that would we'll practice on Saturday I don't know exactly what time I'm expecting the musicians to get back with you on that but my point is we want to do whatever we can do they and once that done we'll bring it this way before the summer out I really want to have a meeting up here where we can get out here and witness and testify and sing and act like holy rollers y'all hear me young people I need you because when they see young people I used to be young one time believe it or not and they really you know I had an old lady said that's what gets me you young while you go up to that church so she opened the door for me she said I've never seen even though she wanted to stay about this she recognized something had ahold of me you see what I'm saying and my point is this you know we need to get out and we need to do something because what it will do it will fire you up again we've been sitting still too long hello and we need to do something don't be ashamed of what you got so for those who want to join me I don't mind I started out on the street with a tambourine and three or four singers they were all sisters and we would bring in Souls I baptized I don't know how many people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't even know where they are it's not my business right yeah Philip baptized the eunuch is that okay you got a side in his car cuz I need to keep up with you know it was all about God ain't God good to us amen so y'all keep that in mind pray about it amen because we need to let the world see God reflected in us all right reflected in us amen let's tan one more scripture as you stand 13:34 35 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you love one to another and so we understand that we being Babylon every end but one thing that God said we gotta love one another and if it's not there you need to ask God to give it it's there like I said the sugars at the bottom of the other of the jaw just stir that kool-aid up you love the Lord I love God I'm not saying I'm where you should be I mean I hear people say brother Brooks I've never seen a man like you and you know I know you love God and all that and those good things they sound so good but then I know what's on the inside I know the real me you know I'm constantly asking for God's grace and God's mercy and it's a daily thing that I pray before God and you know you see strongholds in your life that you want God to deliver you from because you want to be in that image you want to get to a place you don't see nothing of the world just God himself I'm not thirsting for power whether God used me to open the eyes of the blind or raise the dead or anything else like that that's not it that's not my goal my goal is to know that he is in me and I am in him not some of the time all the time I want my mind to be completely erased of my own ideas and our own thoughts I only want the mind of Christ I don't I don't know what that is but I want to know because the Bible said let this mind be in you I want that mind I want to be like Paul says I am a prisoner of Christ if I have my lose all friends and all family I still wanna have that place in Christ where I am a prisoner you know because once you get closer to God you will get you get on you get on Christian nerves that's all you talk about is Jesus you know I'm not interested in the football and the basketball and all that kind of stuff got out there and I ain't I don't know no Hollywood singers and swingers and all that I'm not interested in all of that that's out of here why would I be interested in things the newspapers from hell my goal is to know heavenly things that's all I want to know I want them to take full full control of this preacher I can't give a count for nobody else but this preacher I don't want to be like everybody else I'm not in it for the money I'm not in it for the women and I'm not in it for the popularity I'm in it for one thing this is my calling and I want to complete the goal that God sent here for you love the Lord I trust that's your desire God sent you for a purpose and you want to complete his purpose no matter what the cause I want that I want dad if God got a stripped me from every piece of clothing piece of money piece of house whatever yeah he hears me you hear me as my witness I'm not interested I got to die someday brother sister I'm not here just to you know form a fashion I could have had all of this and more and the opportunities that I have had in life I thought it is nothing cuz when I'm sad Jesus the only one makes me glad he's the only one that could sing me a song and pick me up out of that muck and mire he's the only one you y'all know what I'm saying he's my friend and I trust he's yours let's pray father we so thank you for your amazing grace Lord I don't mean to carry along but you know my heart you know my struggles every day my mental struggles and Lord how I'd love to I love Lord to see it all over well I'm standing in your presence perfectly whole you're looking at me and saying well done that's all I want to hear god I'm not so much interested in what all I'm gonna receive there but I just want to know that when I get there you'll be there I know father we so thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for your love divine forgive us Lord for being a little lengthy but I'm so stirred I'm so happy Lord because I realized Lord Jesus like the song say nothing between my soul and my Savior that's all I want right
