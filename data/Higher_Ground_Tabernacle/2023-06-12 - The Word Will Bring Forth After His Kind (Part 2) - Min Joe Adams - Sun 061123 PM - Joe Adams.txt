our way Lord [Music] amen amen if you have your Bibles we're going to look back we'll be available one verse 1. like to speak to you again on the word we bring forth after his Kind part two of us a little bit further this evening refined here as it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God in verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwell to mangas and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace God bless you you can have your seats as well we also look in Genesis we fight here in Genesis 1 26. don't Genesis and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and notice what he says let them have dominion dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air sure over the cattle and over to all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man to rule because Man was created in the image of God and we find in verse 27 God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so we look here and we find again God in the aspect of creation so this first man was a spirit man Allah we found in Genesis 2 and verse 7. and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the earth and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and now that Spirit Man became a living Soul now that Spirit man is now becoming a living Soul so God created all history and all the creatures were formed yet God saved the best for last see God had in the back part of his mind that he wanted something to resemble him he wanted somebody that would love him he wanted someone that will reciprocate his wife so God created man [Applause] in his own image so man you are the highest form of God so my family and I hello my family we just saw the beautiful mountains of Utah we've been through the beautiful Yellowstone Park music your eyes and your mind can't comprehend the beauty it was during the perfect we can't comprehend the creative power of God and when you look at it you're in just wondering and amazing go over without this I was introduced and yet that is not God's greatest creation but you are God's greatest man so we can look at the mountains we can look at the beaches [Applause] image you're in God's image did you hallelujah hallelujah when God finished creating the Bible tells us in verse 28. that God blessed them so this word blessed here means to adore video it means to praise you I do it so now he has just created all the the trees and the mountains and all the beauty that we know today [Applause] he's created all the animals that crap on the ground but when he finished creating man God step back now he's adored amen this is my greatness foreign get back in adored his Creations this is the height of my Creations [Music] hallelujah amen and notice not only I mean he adore his creation but he admonishes them he admonishes them to be fruitful dead and that word means to bring forth to bring forth to increase to bear fruit the The Poetry of the the food so God wants you to bring forth life I don't judiciency his life and he said to multiply the the the municiple that means to become numerous to make many living you'll know them to have many and to replenish the Earth and that means to complete it is in his thinking he had you there he was up on sin and once he created you he adores we adore him but they knew about how much he had [Applause] God had a desire and Lord you have any disease to have a family that growing family to express himself in his face and he created all botany life and it was good he created all the living creatures and it was good but it wasn't until he created man that he blessed him now he was no longer God now he was Papa God through the relationship has changed see the animals don't know him as Papa God the arms of the trees don't know it miss papa gone but we know him and when God looks at you he sees the way now he is God's desire to bring forth the family it's right now manifesting in your life is so manifested on who and you wonder and you're in amazement how am I here come on it's not by mistake you know it's not by accident not by accident it's by predestination because that seed was always there see the thought was always so when God thought about a lamb that would be slain before the founders you were in that thought God had a purpose for that language did you God came to redeem those thoughts that's why you can overcome today that's why he could rise up today when you feel like you don't have enough I know even [Music] you talking about eternal security for the police can't just rest tonight knowing who we are Suarez [Applause] and you know who's you're not before they came together she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost uh hello they notice who the child was off he was of the Holy Ghost said don't know if looking for Ninja sent this free so we're not preaching three different aspects about it twice I spent the Jew but there's one God with three different offices so God is the father of Jesus and then we find she's found a child of the Holy ghosts so the father and the Holy Ghost must be the same and all the Battle of sentence we do have it and we find that Joseph her husband being a just man I ain't doing normal juice and not willing to make a public example he was mindful to put her away but what he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him fear not to take under deep Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her ears of the Holy ghosts and she shall bring forth the son [Applause] and that shall call his name Jesus it's true for he shall save the people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled because I complete which was spoken the Lord by the prophet saying Beholder virgin shall be with child and you bring forth the son and on foreign the word of God I don't Jesus and brother bam says and he was bursted open that life the life on the inside of the Sea Island this life which is the spirit sets free water overflowing it the spirit over the seed of god let's please that's why we need the spirit in our Circle we don't just need good preachers amen glory you're doing good foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] over the next Hill don't don't push [Applause] give me a little bit of volume up here waiting on us and hallelujah hallelujah said he was deceived now brother Brown tells us that Jesus was deceived that Eve should have produced but see she didn't wait on you and when you don't wait and confidence you can't produce oh listen to the LIE of the enemy hello oh my soul's drilling me and she saw that how to bring forth life and that view come on that it was good and she shared it with her husband but that wasn't God's plan message but see that's why we find in Matthew with Mary Avec Mary think about how many years it took years had passed but God had already spoken a word in Genesis and that Steve is going to bruise the head of the circle that scene should have came forth in Genesis foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] great D cause all that was in that seat Christ God pours it into this season oh church that's why you have overcoming Powers so we understand that Adam and Eve fell in the beginning but the word had already been spoken [Music] I'm gonna bring forth Jose and that's what we're doing it's a certain songs on Thunder that we're bringing forward in your failures you're bringing forward going down for face in your discouragement should bring It Forward in your trials you're bringing forward don't vote don't vote to eat in your light Seasons you're bringing forward says in your loneliness you're bringing foreign ballet hallelujah hallelujah be it unto me Lord because I swear because I couldn't be Swansea according to that word [Music] let's look here in Colossians 1 and verse 12. Colossians 1 and verse 12.50 [Music] Colossians 1 and verse 12. don't leave giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us unto the kingdom of his dear son it was in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God [Music] the firstborn of every creature for by him where all things created come on that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones or dominions or principalities of power all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things invite him all things consistent foreign [Applause] Acts 26 and 23 don't I don't even have the active that Christ should suffer because and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and shall show light unto the people and to the Gentiles First Corinthians 15 and verse 20. but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits so he was the wave of friends [Music] for since my Man Came Death and Batman came also the resurrection of the Dead Resurrection let's go to Revelations 1 and verse 5. trying to build this for you so you can see as you said and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness the first begotten of the dance Revelations 1 and verse 18. Jesus speaking here and he says I am he that liveth and was dead and I Am Alive forevermore and I have the keys of death and Hell Revelations 3 and verse 14. this is pertaining and he says unto the angel of the Church of the laodice these things saith amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god notice who is speaking hello the beginning of a new creation no longer will it be a flesh Creations that he started a new creation what was it a creation of himself you're in case you're doing remember God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us 100 feet God was created in the human form Amen in Jesus Christ he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and he lived in that Tabernacle he left Victorious God Emmanuel Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house so that he can reflect his word to his subjects through that reflected so you didn't know what God was I love himself Hallelujah nation of that's like manifestation visible to do glory to God let's look at this here just for a minute because I don't know this is an electrician Church age doesn't miss actually at least how could God be created if he's a Spirit come on how could it be he's Eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was God at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifested manifest when God lived in him he is God's creation all the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound too significations just take it in the way that they sound has made some people just [Applause] significations get the idea that Jesus was the first creation the creation of God making him lower than the godhead [Music] created all the rest of the universe whatsoever it contains he said but that's not right he says you know that that Lana with the rest of the Bible all things were made by him or without him was not anything made that was made he is the one that we find in Genesis 1 1. in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth for in six days the Lord made the Heaven and the Earth surely we can see what those words mean now hello to have any other interpretation will mean that God created God foreign revealing who he is in this age don't sit down and he calls himself this is another creation he said this has to do with the church says this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church oh I love this next word I don't Jam says the Heavenly bridegroom Celeste created his own bride Ave [Music] foreign did you he said there's a spirit of God [Music] he came down and created in the Virgin yeah the cells from which his body was born so we finally Colossians 1 18. he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the Dead that in all things he might have the preeminence second Corinthians 5 and verse 17. therefore If any man is in Christ If any man is in Christ he is a new creation all things are passed away all those past habits all those past failures oh all the this discouragement all that is see your desires have been changed your Nature has been changed this new creation is not the old creation made up could not be called a new creation [Applause] but it's exactly what it is [Music] you're the god race now see it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing with the ways of the flesh see that's how he dealt with Israel and Abraham and issues to The Godly Isaac line [Music] um [Music] right here Abraham's issued through Isaac [Applause] he has purposed a new creation and he is the first of that creation Oh my he is God created in the form of man either I formed the norm and notice and now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator created himself remember a part of his creation he said this is a true Revelation this was his purpose this purpose took form through elections so boots I preform I bounce you see who you are oh my God his own decree he elected the members of this new creation and a predestinated them to the adoption of children in accordance oh he says hallelujah aren't you glad you belong to him so where does the word begin in the womb of your heart see God is not the program says now he says now he was the beginning of the creation of God because God is not a creation only in Christ is here so he created himself a body and he lived in that Bible basketball when I don't know [Music] through the prophets what was God from the fair God came to continue his creation yes [Music] has God ever Tabernacle his creations oh he spoke through them he left it barely I bet you do it but now he lives in them oh the beginning see all that God did in that body he's doing in this body that's why you can't failure cause it's not true it's not your human efforts it's not your human ability this is a god worked God's creation and that word is bringing forth once again Sons and Daughters of God peace notice what he says deity is not in heaven like like so we think oh deities up here hello but it took a prophet of God to come in this hour man on developments don't say Josh he says it's a perfect ID the deity is in you now the same created Power that spoke the world into existence is now living in you may not be on Booth some of you need to go crate some of you need to go and create create an atmosphere in your heart in your church oh you had that ability with this because you're that creation basketball hallelujah hallelujah notice it says you can't be seed and disagree with the words because the word is and if you are the words she says you'll be disagreeing with yourself you'll be defeating your own purpose we believe the words and because we believe the world then the attributes of the father begin to flow out in our lives since my daughter Rebecca here hello she doesn't look like me or something like that she's pretty and they've been and y'all say Amen it was that it's your amen yeah it's very beautiful blonde hair and blue eyes blonde but she acts a lot like her daddy she has some fire in her like her dad and uh the the food comes on pair so you look at her you may not know that she's my daughter but the attributes that are inside of me begin to flow out in her body begin to live out in her life and then you can tie us together and then you know that she's my dog oh what about the heaven oh you may not look like him now you know notice you can't make yourself different from what God intended you to me see I wouldn't mind problem being tall problem dark and handsome um hey boo but I'm short just be cool cute you just read uh yeah but I'm what God created how he created so you can't add anything to your stature Brother Rich God created you first Jews that create perfect the way that you are the Bible says you're fearfully and wonderfully made and many times we look in the mirror and we get mad at what we see it means this is the only way to change insurance so you can't make yourself something that you're not alone you can't make yourself prize you're not bride but you're choosing that's when that's right you're proud by his elections notice we find an Ephesians the Bible says you were chosen in God you were chosen in Christ and because you were chosen that's your predestination God can't separate you you're in the prepared say hallelujah notice God saw your shortcomings sure every conversation and he looked all over the world [Applause] to do God don't take a rose petalum says I choose them I choose them not I choose you not we used to do the perfect deal because it was right here she loves me she loves me not and ma'am get down to the last pedal news she loves me not uh no God loves you no Jerusalem and God chose you it dribbles it moves that's right oh and you're gonna display the very acts of God it was that immunity come on that's why you can overcome that's why you can be an overcomer cause you were predest the same way men choose their Brides today see the bride doesn't simply decide who she's gonna marry hello but no the groom decides John 15 and verse 16. you have not chosen me but I have chosen um see the chosen of the bride was purposed in himself [Music] and brother Brown tells us the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own Jews and that purpose was in himself it's reputation and being Eternal it was decree before the foundation of the world before there was ever a speck of star in us but for God was ever an object of adoration the bride was already in the Bible Church when you're having a bad day where you were at realize where you come from oh it'll make that day a lot better um the real you is eternal [Applause] that's why you're [Music] a Believer today [Applause] [Applause] a land he doesn't choose a a disfigured bride but she's perfect beautiful in all her ways oh my come on Brad look away from the mirror oh my God look at your Perfection this is the real you right here when you line up with this right now you're lining up with the Real views Oh Glory to God so we're predestinated unto a doctor hello and each and every one of us here tonight are on free moral ages so God do not twist anybody's arm to be here tonight [Music] this is not our Destiny church this life is not our destination we're only passing through oh but we're headed back to our destination because we were chosen because he had foreknowledge of it [Applause] to be conformed Into His Image it takes us right back to Genesis the spoken word is we are predestinated to be conformed I had to confirm it in His image oh praise God praise the Lord His Image you saw him so there's people today I don't believe in predestination it makes God seem unfair so that row right there is my family and when I leave tomorrow I'm taking my family with me so don't get mad because you're not invited to come hello come on you're not part of my family you're not even gonna think about it that I didn't invite you man and that's the same way we go because we're his family he's gonna invite us to come and it's not for everybody it's in the purple but all that the father has given [Music] that word knowledge that word to no means to have a relationships you had a relationship in the mind of God and it was before the foundation chosen in him and see God knows your heart and brother Brown would tell us that he had to sing Christ he had to send Christ he had to redeem those thoughts he had to send Christ to redeem those thoughts so that's why we're here because we've been redeemed because we were thoughts because we are the word that is coming foreign [Music] foreign to do stands in his election is but Jacob have Allah see God knew hello would desire the birthright um sorry to see in church age well the BAM says he said first of all we know most is surely that the purpose of God stands in elections and as we said earlier you are the heart purpose of God the Eternal purpose of God and that stands not in your election but it is purpose to bring forth the people foreign man oh I'm gonna say it again and connect with you come in the condemnation she can never be in judgment because oh sons of God Daughters of God therefore there now is no
