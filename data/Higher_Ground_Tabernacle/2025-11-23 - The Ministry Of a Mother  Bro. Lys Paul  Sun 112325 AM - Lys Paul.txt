[music] But for the [singing] cause of Christ, I have spent my days [singing] that what he'd have me is who [music] I am. And as I've come to see [singing] the weaker [music] side of me, I realized [singing] his grace is what I [music] need. [music] Justice [singing] for my soul. Mercy [music and singing] said no.

I lived in a world of sin and [music] shame that only cause me grief and pain. [singing] But I tried so hard to be free. I was searching for my true identity. I didn't [music] know what came from eternity [singing] until God came and [music] revealed it to me. On the [music] wings of a [singing] snow white dove, God sent [music] his pure sweet [singing] love. On the wings of a snow white dove to take his eagles home. On the wings of a snow white dove. Lord sent his pure [music and singing] sweet love. On the wings of a snow white dove to take his eos. [music] I knew somehow [singing] I was born [music] to fly way up in the sky.

[music] Go by and by when the morning comes, when all the saints of God have gathered home, [music] oh, we will tell the story of how we overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by. Amen. By and by, oh by and by, when the morning comes, when all the saints of God have gathered home, oh, we [music] will tell the story how we overcome. Oh, we'll [music] understand it better by and by. Oh, we are often tossed and driven on this restless sea of time. Somber skies and howling tempest hops exceed a bright sunshine. In that land of perfect days, when the mist has rolled away, we will understand it better. By and [singing] by, amen. Yes, Lord. Oh, by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God have gathered [music] home. Oh, we will tell the story how we overcome. Oh, we'll understand [music] it better by and by. Trials dark on every hand.

Oh, we'll understand [music] it better by and by. Temptations hidden [music and singing] snares often take us unaware. And our hearts are made to bleed. For many thoughtless word or deed, and we wonder [music] why the test is when we try to do our best, but we'll [music] understand it better by and by. Amen, Lord. Oh, by and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God have gathered, we will tell the story. How we [music] overcome, how we understand it better by and by. Go by and [singing] by and by.

God bless you. God bless y'all. &gt;&gt; Amen. By and by we'll tell the story how we overcome. You know, you got to have a story to tell. But your story is only that we overcame by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we come before you Lord this morning in the name of Jesus. Heavenly Father, Lord, it gives us such an such an assurance to know that when we come in the name of Jesus Christ that you will hear our prayers. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father Lord, there's not a name that excites you like the name of Jesus Christ. That's why heavenly father lord we love thy name. By thy name we have healing. By thy name we have salvation. By by the name we have everything that we need. Lord, heavenly father, Lord, your children coming came into your house this morning needs Lord Jesus. But father Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray heavenly father Lord that you provide to their needs Lord Jesus. I pray that you forgive our iniquities Lord Jes. And heavenly father Lord I thank you for being here among us this morning. I thank you for the song service. I thank you for the atmosphere that's been set, Lord Jesus. I thank you for all the special songs. And I pray, Father Lord, that Father Lord, you just now come and have your way among us, Lord. I pray, Father Lord, that you speak to your children. Father, as I surrender myself to you, Lord Jesus, I need you every time I preach, Lord. Father Lord, because I don't ever want to preach without you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure your children don't want to come hear me, Lord, but they want to hear you, Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, God, the we don't have any other ministry but to preach the message of the hour to the bride. &gt;&gt; Lord, anoint your word. I bind every spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ I pray. &gt;&gt; And we say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Proverb chapter 22. I did not write the verse. Verse 6. &gt;&gt; How many happy to be in the house of God? Amen. Proverb chapter 22:6 says, "Train up, &gt;&gt; train up a child, a child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he will not depart from it. Amen. Let's go to Proverb chapter 13 verse 24. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chastise just chastiseth him but be times. And the last scripture, let's turn to second Timothy chapter 1. The second Timoth Tim Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 says, "When I called to remembrance the unfeign unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Ununice, and I'm persuaded that in thee also." Amen. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 1:5 &gt;&gt; verse one. Amen. Let's bow our head real quick again. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you for the reading of your word. Lord Jesus, I pray that you renounce your word once more and bless the service in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. And it was good to see sister Stephie giving a special and I also love that song. &gt;&gt; You know where would we have been without the message of the hour. I &gt;&gt; I always tell the church always cherish this message. The true believers in the end time will only be found in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Peter also. And I think who was that? Crystal Crystal. &gt;&gt; Good. Good specials. I enjoyed all of the specials. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh my topic for this morning will be u I don't know if I'm qualified to preach about that but I'll just use &gt;&gt; I will use scriptures and the the prophets you know to let you know that it's not coming from me but it's coming from and it's on the ministry of a mother you know the ministry of a mother in a house &gt;&gt; or even in the church because the prophet says that you know we all have a responsibility we all have a parts to play in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; The prophet even said that the bride will have a ministry you know and the bride each and every one of you has a part to play in that ministry. Some it can be just to even be a minister some it can be to be a father to be a mother. But for today, we're going to uh focus on the mother part. And we pray that God gives you to preach about that. So the first scripture that we read is Proverb chapter 22. It says, "Train up a child in the way that he should go. And when he is old, he will not depart from it." You know the Bible tells us that every scripture has been given to us for educ edification. No there's not the the Bible says the word of God will never return void but it will accomplish the purpose for which he was sent. So if God allowed these scriptures to be here, it's for a purpose and the purpose is to tell to teach the parents that you need to train your child when they are growing. No. And when we go to second Timothy chapter 1 to5, no, I'll skip that one. I'll get to there later later. So, you know, the prophet talks about that God has certain laws that he abides with. &gt;&gt; You know, in nature, there are a lot of laws that, you know, it doesn't matter if you're a Christian, you're not a Christian. It's the law that God has established. And if you follow that law, it's going to produce the law. You know, in the message, the everpresent water from the rock, the prophet says in paragraph 145, &gt;&gt; he says, you see what does the tree, what intelligence runs that down? It's a law. It's a law that God had set in order. And that law is God's law that will take care of the subject. He says, you know, I don't care how much you cry out. &gt;&gt; And you say it ain't going to the sun ain't going to shine no more this summer. It will shine anyhow. How much you're going to say, I I'm not going I am going to let nighttime come. It will come anyhow because this thing that we live on called the world &gt;&gt; is controlled by a law of God. You know, so you cannot come and say I don't want the summer to shine in the summer anymore. The prophet says he's still going to shine because there is a law that God had set in order that in the summer the sun is going to shine. And then there are let's look at other other laws of God. There's a law that says you reap what you sow. &gt;&gt; You know it doesn't matter who you are. But whatever you do, you know that you there there are consequences for every action that you do. It didn't matter even that you are the prophet of the hour versus just a person sitting here this morning. Look at example of brother Brham. &gt;&gt; He obeyed to his mother-in-law instead of obeying God's leadership. And what happened to him? He had to reap for that. You know, he lost his his wife and his baby. And then there is there is another law also that says that if you pour water on a seed and you expose the seed to the sun, to expose it will have to grow. It doesn't matter if it's a bad seed or a good seed, it is still going to grow. There is another law again, the law, the law of paying your tithing. It doesn't matter if you are a Christian or not a Christian, but there's a certain law that if you just pay your tithing, God is going to bless you. You know, that's I believe that's Malachi chapter 3. that says try me, you know, and see if I'm not going to open all the banks, the the doors of heaven, the blessings. So, you see, I I I was uh reading this one man, his name is Denzel Washington. &gt;&gt; He's a millionaire. He's an actor. But he also advises people always pay your tithing. You know, that's something that those people out there, they have understood. That's why they do a lot of charity works as well is because they understand that there are certain laws that the more you give, God is going to bless you. So there are certain laws that God has placed and there is also another law that he has placed us in the family that the law is that children are to come through the mom. The law of God is that a family a family is composed of a father, mother and the children. It doesn't matter even in animals we see that they all the the dad, mom and the children. It's the law of God for the family. Everybody has to go through that law. But we see that the devil comes to pervert it. Now he's trying to tell you that let's because the prophet says that Satan cannot create but he only perverts what was good. &gt;&gt; So now Satan comes in the family he's like let me disrupt things. Then he introduces homosexuality &gt;&gt; and now he want to replace the role of a mother in the house. Now he's telling people you can't just have father father and adopt kids. But you cannot replace the what God has created. He's only trying to pervert it. &gt;&gt; So we'll focus on that aspect, you know, the life of a family in the church. the role of a mother. No, because we know the Paul tells us that mothers are not to preach to I mean women shouldn't get in the pulpit and preach. &gt;&gt; And many times we always barely even talk about women. And when we talk about women, we don't really say good things about them, you know, as if they're just this little thing that's just nothing. But you have a precious value in the sight of God. precious value to the points that even Jesus needed to have a mother. God could have just brought Jesus just to be born and not have a mother. But you remember the prophecies that God always abides by his law. So then Jesus needed to be brought under Mary and Joseph. And I even read a place in the Bible where the Bible says that Jesus was obedient to his parents. &gt;&gt; Imagine being God the Father, but he still has to be obedient to his earthly. Why? Because the prophet says that, you know, it's in the message leadership. The prophet says that there's always that one person that's going to lead you towards your first step in life. He said that when you are first born, it's the mother that shows you how to walk, &gt;&gt; you know, and then she passes you down to the teacher at school. So So you have a role to play. You are not just to just to bear children and and just please your husband or just to be beautiful in the church or in the community, but you are more than that. The prophet even says that mother's day shouldn't just be one day. It should be an everyday thing because the prophet says that a mother is the backbone of any nation. A mother is a if the mother is the backbone of a nation, then she's the m she's the backbone of a church. So if you want if a nation cannot be strong if they don't have strong mothers. That's what the backbone of a nation means. &gt;&gt; The prophet says the US fell because Satan came through the the wife, the mothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The uh so the prophet in the Bible says in Ephesians chapter 6 1-3 He says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right." That's another law again, you know, children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. You know, this is about mothers, but it's also about children and it's also about husband because it's about valuing your mothers. Value your wife not just as a wife, but as a mother. I don't qualify to talk about wives. At least, you know, we I've had I've had a mother. &gt;&gt; You have had a mother. There's not anybody here without any mothers. &gt;&gt; So, we need to to start learning to value our mothers. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, &gt;&gt; for this is right. Honor thy father and mother, &gt;&gt; which is the first commandment with promise, &gt;&gt; that he may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. So there's another law that if you want to live longer on this planet, it doesn't matter if you are a Christian or if not a Christian. &gt;&gt; There is a law that you just have to obey your parents. You know that's what the Old Testament says. But now Paul comes and and shrinks it to not just obey your parents but obey them in the Lord. So if your if your parents want to do make want to push you to do something that's against the word then you don't do that. As long as it's in the Lord, obey your parents, you will live longer. If you want to die soon, just be disobedient to your parents. You know, the prophet also talks about this law because God stays with his word. You know, look, let's look at some examples of mothers in the Bible who played some important roles. the mother of Moses. &gt;&gt; You know, the mother of Moses. &gt;&gt; Imagine such a great prophet like Moses. He still needed his mother. &gt;&gt; Imagine he he went to Egypt, &gt;&gt; but he still they still need he still needed his mother to be there to guide him. So God, in other words, God needed Moses' mother to to guide him in his early steps. The prophet says that was instructing Moses that you are different. Don't get don't get too comfortable in the house of Pharaoh. you know, you are to be a the liberator of the of the children of Israel. And those things stayed with Moses, &gt;&gt; you know, to the point that even when he grew up, he tried to take things into his own hand, you know, and he tried to kill, you know, the Egyptians because his mother told him he was to be the the liberator. That's why Solomon comes back in prophet and says parent train your child. You have a vision that you want your children to be. &gt;&gt; Every parent I believe you have an image. No, I would like my son to be this or my daughter to be this. That's a good thing, you know, because you need to have plans for your kids because because even God has a plan for his kids, you know, and when the prophet preached on marriage and divorce or when he preach on uh uh I can't think of the message, you know, the invisible uh what's the &gt;&gt; invisible union of the &gt;&gt; I feel like there's another message, but I can't think of the name. The prophet the prophet preached and said that even though I'm talking naturally it also applies spiritually. So we need to be like Christ which we means that we need to have the mindset of Christ as parents which is to have plans for your kids. You know, another another example was Timothy's mother. I'll stick on this on this one for for some for some time. &gt;&gt; So, if we go to the book of Timothy chapter 1 verse 5, second Timothy, we just read that earlier. Paul says that when I called to remembrance the unfinish faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother, Lo and thy mother unice and I'm persuaded that it's in thee also. &gt;&gt; So what is faith? Faith is a revelation. So in outward Paul is telling Timothy that whatever revelation your grandmother Lo is head of the word I've seen it getting passed down to she taught her daughter well unice. And now I see that Unice also taught you that same revelation. That's why it's important to teach your children the revelation of this message because you have to pass it down from generation to generation. You know, God even in Deuteronomy chapter 4, &gt;&gt; he told the children of Israel to teach their children and their grandchildren the works of the Lord passing down the knowledge of God from generation to generation. Imagine what a privilege in the Bible to have your grandmother being named in the Bible. So in other words, Paul what he's telling Timothy is like when I see you Timothy, I can't just see your mother. &gt;&gt; When I see you you Timothy, I see your grandmother. I see how they how they were instructed in the word. I see how they have faith in the word and now I see it in you. So that's something that was passed down. So don't neglect your position. You may have a Timothy grandson. You may have a Timothy grand grandson. Teach them the word of God. Teach them the message of the hour because there are too many distractions now in in our day. But it's your responsibility as the mother to instruct your child. Why? Because the Bible so that when he grows up, he will not depart from it. &gt;&gt; Things get passed down from generation to generation. &gt;&gt; The prophet even talks about that as well in the message, the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Paragraph 36. He says, &gt;&gt; "What makes these little girls act like that?" No, let's let me go. So, and people today the teenagers out in high school with beer parties and drinking &gt;&gt; and little girls living in adultery, little boys and things like that. What kind of a generation is coming up after this? So it is also questioning what kind of a generation are we going to have in the future? If our kids are acting like this, what are they going to pass down to future generations? What make the what makes these little girls act like that? He said their mommy was a flapper. Their grandmommy was a chorus girl. So we also see the prophet is using the same thing that we just read in Timothy. &gt;&gt; He's blaming it on the parents &gt;&gt; and not even just stopping it there but he's going to the grandmother. You know on the on one side we have Timothy grandmother who was firm in the faith &gt;&gt; and she passed it down to her mother to her daughter and then her daughter passed it down to Timothy. And now here brother Brandham when he's seeing all these girls act like that in high school he's not blaming the girls but he's like that got to be the mother that got to be the grandmother. That's why there's a saying that says uh such uh uh I don't know I'm translating that literally such such mother such daughter &gt;&gt; that's not in vain it's scriptural you know it's scriptural &gt;&gt; their mommy was a flapper &gt;&gt; you know I've I've usually even heard brothers or even uh even my other pastors giving me advices for instance Sometimes they say that if you want if when you're looking for a wife one of the one of the things to look at look at the mom look at how the mom behaves you know because somehow somewhere you will see that the daughter behaves exactly like her mom it's nature we say we saw that with Timothy it was passed down to him by his And the prophet used the same example to also talk about how Abraham paid his tithing. &gt;&gt; What was the scripture in Levi? &gt;&gt; In the loins of &gt;&gt; in the law in the law of Levi. &gt;&gt; So it's so that same attribute the same behavior of paying tithing when we just came down all the way to the generation of Abraham. And you know I'm not so sometime there are even curses [clears throat] bad habits the bad habits that you have as a parent now you start seeing that in your child you start seeing that in your children and that's why we need prayer. When you start seeing those bad habits then you need to be more on your knees because it's just your yourself you got passed down to your children. There's only one there's only one person that can break that away. There's only one person that can change the nature of a child. &gt;&gt; But you know the way he changes the nature of a child, he doesn't give you a new nature. He also sticks by his own laws. He takes the nature of God the father. He takes the nature of God the father. Brother tells us this. All that was in God. Imagine all that was in grandmother Lois, all that was in God pull down into Jesus Christ. Pull down into Mother Unice. And all that was in Jesus Christ, all that was in Mother Unice got pulled down into Timothy, pulled down into the bride. SO NOW WHEN GOD changes your nature, &gt;&gt; you he makes sure you you are born again. And now instead of bearing the nature of your father and mother, now you bear the nature of Jesus Christ. Amen. Lead your children to Christ. Lead your children to Christ. You know, because Christ is the only person that will change them. You know that image that you have that you want your children to be. There's only one person that can make that come to pass. It's Jesus. That's why you have to pray. You have to have a connection with with God &gt;&gt; because God knows them better than you do. God is their creator. So God knows your children better than you do. So then that's why you go back to God like Hannah. Hannah was praying for children. She was praying for children for a child. But when God gave her a child Samuel, she took Samuel and she brought him back to the Lord. That's what you need to do. Parents, you take your children. You are like, "Lord, I can only do as much as a mother. I can only do as much as a father. But Lord, I give you my children. Lord, I'm praying more day and night for my children because you know them weather better than I do. I promise you, you have you will have good children. Give them in the hand of the Lord. Pray for them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "What makes them what makes these little girls act like that? It's their mommy. Their mommy was a flapper." &gt;&gt; And I looked up the word the word flapper. &gt;&gt; You know, the the word flapper, it's it's a slang used in the 1920s. flapper. &gt;&gt; He refers to a young woman who was rebellious and unconventional, known for her short hair, short short hair, short skirts, and bold behavior like smoking and drinking in public. These women embraced a more liberal and modern lifestyle. which sucked which sucked the Victorian values of their parents. &gt;&gt; So it's those women they wanted to be they want we want to be the modern women and and if you continue reading it says that it was often associated with the rise of jazz music and the jazz age. Modern music, you know, modern music had an effect on the parents. &gt;&gt; Modern music had an effect on on on women. &gt;&gt; Just the same way that Hollywood now has an effect on even how people raise their kids. Sometimes you're not even aware of it. Sometimes you certain sometimes you just do certain things because that's the trend of the hour. But the Bible tells us to be different. We are not to be after Hollywood. We are not to be influenced by the uh what's the word? The popular music of the of the hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, you said Beyonce, she does this. Taylor Swift, she does this. And then that influences you. influence. No, we ought to be influenced by the word of God because the word of God tells us how to properly raise our children. THE WORD OF GOD EVEN TELLS US THAT SPARE the rod, you you spoil the child. But now in this modern age, if you if you if you you you chastise your your your son or daughter, you know, now you they're going to bring the police to your house. Why? Because that's the modern way of raising your children. And you wonder why there are so many delinquency in our day. Because we have forgotten the principles of the Bible. THE prophet said that the US the US has fallen because he has gotten away from the principles of the Bible. Let's get back TO BIBLE PRINCIPLES. GET BACK TO RAISING our children the way the Bible teaches us to raise children. And then you kids, when your parent disciplines you, you don't have to go to to to the police and and call the police. It doesn't mean that they don't LOVE YOU. THEY ARE JUST FOLLOWING the word. They are doing this with love. I'll give my own example. You know, growing up, &gt;&gt; sometime I used to fight with my older sister Ruth, &gt;&gt; I used to think every time I would fight my sister Ruth, &gt;&gt; I used to always get punished. &gt;&gt; No matter even if I was right or if I was wrong, I would always get punished. And at some points, I even started thinking that I was adopted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I started thinking that maybe I'm not truly my parents son like because there is no but I remember one time a mother had told me you should never put your hand on a woman no matter what that's why we are always punish you because we are training you so that when you grow up now you know that you should never put your hand on a woman get back to Bible principles get to train your child the way of the Bible. Children, your parents love you. I read one quote where the prophet SAYS THAT YOU JUST LOOKING, OH, they're just old. They don't know. The prophet says that when you grow up one day, you will understand. You will value why your parents were doing things like that. Obey your parents. And so that was the rebellious woman. And then they says their grandmommy was a chorus girl. &gt;&gt; You know, I used to think that chorus girl just means singing in a choir. So I looked up what does chorus girl meant in the time of the prophets. So it says because this message was preached in 1958. I looked up online. He says in the 1950s &gt;&gt; a chorus girl referred to a woman who performed as part of the chorus line in a in a theatrical productions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they give an example like Broadway musical, nightclubs or variety of &gt;&gt; he says 1950s chorus girl equals today's musical theater ensemble dancer and professional backup dancers. So in other words, in other words, those are like backup sing backup dancers and you know &gt;&gt; for those who have watched even like uh uh what you call it worldly music, you see how those musicians they sing with their their backup performer. So the prophet is that the reason why their daughters are living in adulterers and little boys like that is because their mothers were rebellious and then their grandmother was back. They were backup dancers enjoying the entertainment, the pleasure of the world. They send of value in the education of their children and now that is passed down from generation to generation generation. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to pass down bad habits from either generation. I want that when that when those things comes to my house that's the end of the curse that when it comes to my house I break that chain of of those generations. I don't care if my father my grandfather were alcoholic but in my house that is THE STOP OF IT. WHY? BECAUSE I'M applying the blood of Jesus Christ over my house. I apply the blood of Jesus Christ in your house. Apply the blood of Jesus Christ over YOUR CHILDREN. APPLY the blood of Jesus Christ over your wife. APPLY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST OVER YOUR HUSBAND. SO that all those those passed down curses those curses will be enoldled. You know some you some just those are it's it's hereditary. It's it's a family thing. Well, let it end in your with you. Let it stop with you. Do not pass it down to your children. But it comes with prayer. And then we we see in 2 Timothy chapter 3:15, and if I don't finish it, maybe next time. Second Timothy 3:15, the Bible says, "So Paul is talking to Timothy. And he says, "And that from a child thou thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." So from a childhood. So how did he know this from a childhood? We saw earlier it says because of your mother unions. And that led to to Timothy being saved to make thee wise unto salvation. You have wisdom to understand that I I I need to give my life to Christ. I NEED TO GET BAPTIZED. WHY? Because from a childhood I I knew the holy scriptures. So that's why parents, mothers, and I'll read you a quote. The prophet encourages you to read the scriptures to your children. Read Bible story to your children. It will have an impact and effect in their lives. You know the prophet says in a message calling Jesus on the scene paragraph 63 he says John might have John might have said something like he said you know when I was a little boy we lived down by Jericho. I remember my Jewish mother used to rock me to sleep in the afternoon. &gt;&gt; I used to look up in her eyes and she would tell me Bible stories and now and now the prophet says paragraph 64 the message calling Jesus on the scene 1964 paragraph 64 he says and you know that's a good thing for any mother to do to her child. bring her up a ch bring up a child in the way it should go. &gt;&gt; And he says it will be better than turning on the television and watch some of these some of these here things that goes on the television. You'll be better off if you read him a Bible story. Why the purpose? because it's impressing his little mind. So you understand &gt;&gt; exactly. So it's impressing the little mind instead of staying and watching a bunch of television shows giving our children and you know the children are always on YouTube 24/7 watching all sort of things 24/7. THE PROPHET Malachi 4 is teaching us how to raise our children. He's read them Bible stories. We see Timothy was brought up from a child. He knew the holy scriptures. Timothy, who wouldn't want to have another little Timothy? So God does not change. God if if this one person did a certain thing and brought up a certain result, if you also do it, it will bring the same result. So the prophet says it'll be better than turning on the television. Sometimes now we have parents and mother you see and your children you guys are just busy watching shows. I don't know if I don't know anybody that does it here, but I'm just talking, you know, watching shows hardly telling our children Bible stories. &gt;&gt; You know, the house of God is a house of correction. &gt;&gt; The word of God is helping you because this age is is the worst of all the ages. The prophet even says, I'll find a quote here, that our children have more temptations than even the parents had before. That's the age of Leodysia where evil is increased in the land. The prophet even says that the pizza the doors of hell have been opened and demons are out here in the streets. The prophet went to the mall Jesse Penny and he even saw the same influence of demons that he saw in hell. We see those influences in Hollywood movies. those influences in so what our kids sees on social media. But we need to make sure that in the house we are suppressing that influence that our child when they come home as as the prophet says the parents lay a good example for the kids tell them Bible stories. I'll read a quote on the prophet talks about him and his kids how he was telling them the message Elijah the prophet and I hope this is a blessing to you &gt;&gt; and every and that's the same thing this message is also to all the single women who are aspiring to be mothers &gt;&gt; because you have to understand you have a responsibility God has given you the prophet says it's a god-given nature in you to mother something And he says there are three things that God that that in in that honors God for a woman. I'll read the quotes also. I have it somewhere. He says it's first you it's first giving your life to Christ and then secondly it's being loyal to your husband. The third is to have a baby &gt;&gt; and to raise that baby. &gt;&gt; The Bible even talks about there's a scripture that says that you will be saved uh by through childbearing. If you continue in these things, you will be saved. And I and I find childbearing like u you know the prophet talks about that scripture. He says first you need to be saved and then if you continue on those things raising your kids there's a blessing that comes with it you will your husband will never take your position as your as a mother a father cannot sympathize for a for his daughter the same way that a mother will just love God has put more sympathy more affection in the in the mother than the father. We even see one time the prophet was there was a baby in the prayer line. &gt;&gt; You know the baby was sick and the Holy Ghost spoke to her mother to pray for the baby and then but she was like okay I mean who am I like the baby is going to be prayed by the prophet William Brown. But the Holy Ghost kept pressing it down on her that she asked to pray for the mother, for the kid, you know. And when the baby went to the prayer line, the the Holy Ghost says that your this baby is already healed because he was already prayed by a mother. And the prophet says that the the the way a mother would sympathize with that baby, I wouldn't sympathize the same way. So the prayer of a mother in other words it can't even be more effective than the prayer of a prophet for your baby. So the the prayer of that mother was more effective than the prayer would have been more effective than the prayer of brother. That's why even you can come here you bring your children to be pray for that's good we will pray for them but that prayer will never be the same with when the mother prays for her children. That's the message the prophet said that that's why you need to pray at home because you have a responsibility that you just have to know that I'm in a place where you know have you ever had a position where you know that if you are not there in that place everything is going to be like messed up chaos everywhere that's the same attitude you should have as a mother you should know that If I never pray for my children, no one else can take this position that I have, you know. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says in the message Elijah the prophet paragraph 27, I'll try to hurry up and every every evening when I'm home, everything is cleaned out. I take my little girls and give them a Bible study. Now I know this is directed to the mother but he's also the father. So fathers can also teach your children Bible studies you know but you understand and you'll see how the prophet took it very seriously. He says put them in the car so nobody would interrupt us. That's how important that meant to the prophet. We need to get away somewhere me and my little girl. me and my little kids. I'm going to teach them the Bible, wife and baby. And I give them questions like, "Who was Elijah? &gt;&gt; Where was he?" And right quick, them little old six-year-old and you see the age sixy old and 8y old girls, they say he was a tish bit right quick. So he will ask, "Hey, who was Elijah?" "Oh, daddy, he was the bite." &gt;&gt; We love the prophets, right? &gt;&gt; We love the prophet. Let's do as the prophet was doing. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not asking any children to raise their hand, but if you want to, you can. I wonder is there any any eight, nineyear-old that knows who Elijah is? &gt;&gt; Any kids kids? Do you guys know Elijah? You know Elijah, &gt;&gt; good job. Who was Elijah? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you and God bless your parents for teaching you that. Let's applause for that. That's how you raise your children. &gt;&gt; Any other that know Elijah because we are under the ministry of Elijah. And we need to start training our children from a young age who Elijah was. That's what the prophet was doing. &gt;&gt; So if you're not doing this, start doing that. God bless you, Bethl. Keep doing the keep doing what you're doing. &gt;&gt; What was he, you know, in the right and I said, how do you know? How could you tell if you would meet him today? What kind of a man was he? Oh, he was a hairy man and had leather around his loins. Little Rebecca or Sarah Sarah, one will will holler out. So, you see the kids were even excited about those kind of questions. They know. Oh, now it's a Bible study time with daddy. &gt;&gt; Who was Elijah? Daddy, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Who was he? He was a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's raising the children according to Malachi 4. And he says, uh, uh, paragraph 28, just keep, he says, just keep drilling that that into their mind. Keep teaching them who brother Brham was. drill that into their mind. You know, he didn't say just one time. Keep to drill is to take something and pierce and you keep drilling drilling. You guys will know who brother Brandham was. WHETHER YOU WANT IT or not, you will know today. Hey, do you know brother Brandham? Let me ask another question. Any kids, do you know who brother Brandham was? &gt;&gt; Seems like Bethl is the only person that knows everything. Who is brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you again. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep drilling that into your children. &gt;&gt; To be to be honest in this message of the hour, if your children don't even know who Brother Brandham is, we need to do better. We need to do better and teach them the prophet. prophet. &gt;&gt; He says constantly constant &gt;&gt; that's what you do to your children matter. You know, you might say, "Oh, Elise, why are you telling me that? Do you have no business telling me that?" Okay, now the prophet is telling you. &gt;&gt; That's what you do to your children, &gt;&gt; mother. Quit running around over the city and getting about giving about giving your children Bible lectures and things, &gt;&gt; you know. Let me skip a little bit. He says, "I believe you've heard my expression of women preachers, but let me tell you, every mother is a preacher." &gt;&gt; Sure. And God gives her a little congregation at home to preach to.re. &gt;&gt; So mothers, what is your responsibility? What is your ministry? You have a ministry. &gt;&gt; It's not behind these pulpit, &gt;&gt; but it's in the pulpit in your homes. &gt;&gt; You have a little congregation. &gt;&gt; You are to preach your children. &gt;&gt; That's good. You get it first. So then go right with your children. &gt;&gt; Let me try to skip. Uh yeah, let me read your story. So uh I I was reading an article where there was a home and five boys were were born in this home &gt;&gt; and as soon as the oldest one got old enough to go to the navy off to the navy he went and the second ONE SO LIKE ALL the five boys became navy soldiers don't then the mother and father couldn't understand just why these boys everyone wanted to go to the navy. And there was a real fine combin coming uh investigation made of this. And they come to find out that in the bedroom where these boys all was brought up. In this bedroom there was a beautiful big picture hanging there of a big ship sailing on a quiet calm sea. And he so impressed the boys as they went to bed at night. Looking at this picture, &gt;&gt; he was on their mind to sell that quiet and it impressed the boys so that each one be become a sailor. Paragraph 32. Now look what the prophet says. Now if a picture of a ship will impress boys to become navy men, sailors of the sea, what are the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ do? See, always have the right thing before your children. If the picture of the sailor would impress five consecutive boys to all become navy men, this when I read this I thought about you know I don't believe I don't believe in like it's not like I'm worshiping a picture but we just read the prophecies then what would A PICTURE DO SO pictures have effect ON PEOPLE THAT'S why have the picture of the pillar of fire in your house that's why we have pictures of Jesus Christ in your bedroom with your kids put the picture of Jesus Christ. It's going to impress the mind. That's what the prophet is saying. Always have the right thing before your children. Let's stick with that sentence. Always have the right thing before your children. So what does that mean? That means you need to know where what your children are watching. That means you need to know what is put in front of your children. Maybe the father might be busy at work but that's the responsibility of the mother. You know we sometime we give our kids tablets and iPads not nothing against that but you need to vet it. You need to go through it because there are all sort of things that they are watching and the prophet says it's going to impress their little mind. If you can project that picture that that I put there, you know, like so there was a there was a I think some of you might know this Coaron, &gt;&gt; you know. So in 2023 I have the Yeah. in 20 23. So there's an article that was published that says Netflix faces calls for boycott over Cocoon Lane cartoonetflix a character in the Netflix series. No, just go back to the picture. &gt;&gt; Niko, a character in the Netflix series. He's wearing a tyra or tutu like he's wearing a skirt as he tries on girls outfit in front of his two gay dads. &gt;&gt; Did you even know that was in one of the Coco melons? Why are they doing that? It's to impress their little mind. And and then um um the gay dads then start singing a song encouraging the toddler to decide how he wants to dress. And this is what the song says. If you're not sure what to choose, think about all the things you like to do. Just be you. The to the toddler then asks just be me as he considers a series of outfits like skirts or stuffon. &gt;&gt; We need to be careful. Satan is not sleeping. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says that he's roaring like a lion seeking whom he may devour. But the Bible also tells us to be not ignorant of his devices. He takes an advantage over you. And we see the prophet telling us always uh what did he say again? Like know what? Always have the right thing before your children. So is this the right thing? Is that what you want your child to do? You you you know some things like that you you may you may not notice it from a child a child childhood but what what are they doing they are training them so that when they grow up because those are spirits that are being projected and if you don't first of all you don't even pray oh my may God help us parents you see the importance of prayer because we are woman. I'm not asking you. You're not going to catch everything that's in there. But that's where prayer comes in place because what you don't see, God sees. That's when prayer comes in place. Mother, pray for your children. So God, your prayer may be the one that causes your child. Maybe he was scrolling and he sees the episode like, "Ah, no, I'm going to skip this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is just one some certain images. I didn't even I didn't want to put it because we have kids, you know, subliminal sexual images in cartoons. Kids cartoons. Why are they doing this? You know, the pro the prophet says that Satan always copies what God does. If the prophet is telling us to train our kids so that it impresses their mind, Satan also understanding is like let's go to the children so that it impresses their mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me skip. May God give me grace. The message expectation expectative This is no I'll skip this one. Um in paragraph yeah same same message paragraph 29 expectation. &gt;&gt; The first preacher that ever gets to a child is a mother. &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to it? That's a prophet. They can project it. Paragraph 29 expectation 55. The first preacher that ever gets to a child is a mother. Five gospels. &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Mother. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and mother. &gt;&gt; What is your ministry? You are a gospel to your children. So, you know, I thought about that sentence. I said, what does he mean? Then I'm like, what are those five gospel, those four gospels? They tell about the story of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know they tell about how Jesus died for our sins. &gt;&gt; But you understand that all those four gospels they one may have more stories than the other gospel. So Matthew may have another story than Mark adding more details. Luke and John. And now the prophet is like and now you have the mother's version of the Bible. We have the gospel according to to Matthew, the gospel according to Mark, the gospel according to Luke and John. And now the gospel according to Matthew because why? Because your kids are not going to understand all these hard words of the Bible sometime. Now you give them the gospel according to like in their in their language. How the prophet says by telling them stories a mother should be spiritfilled woman who can teach her children and teach them to pray and to know about God. Instead of that they give them to a babysitter and run all night long. the babysitter and then go to Sunday school on Sunday morning and call themselves Christian. You have a ministry that God gave you to raise that child to be the fifth gospel, the first preacher to that child. But now you're saying, "Nah, &gt;&gt; the bills are more important." Now &gt;&gt; babysitter become the fifth gospel to my child. Baby, &gt;&gt; you know if you don't have a choice by taking your kids to baby babysitters, that's okay. But when they come home, make sure you you know what they taught them in those baby babysitters. Don't don't just assume they're teaching them good things. You know, I have a friend. She got married and she used to work in a day in a baby a dayare. &gt;&gt; You know, she said she told me that she she's not going to take her child to daycare until her child is of an age where he can speak. Why? Because she want her child to know to be able to translate to tell what there is being taught there. She has experience. She has worked in a daycare. She knows how it is. &gt;&gt; You know, Satan has bad agendas, you know, &gt;&gt; you can't have a maybe, who knows? Maybe that day the the babysitter is a lesbian babysitter. And even though she cannot teach your child about, you know, the the homosexuality stuff, she just finds those cocoon stuff that talks about gay stuff and she put that in front of your child. And your child now, he grows up knowing it's okay for me to like a boy or to like a girl if I'm a girl. The prophet did not say the babysitter is the first gospel, the first preacher to your child. You the mother are the you are the first preacher in a message the presence of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm reading a lot to let you know that it's coming from the prophet and you can take notes and go check it yourselves at home. to see a big family anymore. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They already pay hundreds of dollars for a little snottynosed dog and pack it pack it around and give it the love of a mother and practice birth control than to have children. Think that was something old. hang around to the barrooms, drink and play cards, and run around all afternoon in your husband's car. You know, if if you're a stay home wife, your husband is there working and he have you he has you a car, that's not for you to start running around the city and leaving your car by them, leaving your kids by themselves. No. Uh where where was I? Uh in the afternoon in your husband's car. Why? It's a disgrace. Now look, the greatest honor a woman can do outside of coming to Christ and being loyal to her husband is have a baby. So there are so in in the in order the first horner is you have to come to Christ and then be loyal to your husband. Then you have a baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You might be nursing a little preacher. How do you know that? I know that's oldfashioned. It's oldfashioned to encourage mothers to have kids in And I and I feel like it's even more among the uh western world like in the US compared to like even Africa because I saw even like Elon Musk or like the the US government government encouraging Americans now to have more kids. Why? because they've noticed that this this western world has they don't value having babies anymore. Now they all want to be like Taylor Swift who's a mother of cats. You know, &gt;&gt; the prophet says she must she must she must mother something because it's a god-given nature to her. Let's keep I'll give another example. I'm I'm halfway through my notes, but I'll probably continue another day. &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley. &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley. &gt;&gt; You know, she was the mother of John Wesley and Charles Wesley. &gt;&gt; Charles Wesley. &gt;&gt; And John Wesley and Charles, they're the one that started the Methodist movement revival Wesley, &gt;&gt; the messenger of the age. and reading I read about her and it says early in her life she vowed that she would never spend more time in leisure entertainment than she did in prayer and Bible study. &gt;&gt; So she would say that her Bible study time and prayer needs to have more importance and time than entertainment. more important than going to parties. So in other words, in in this modern age, like bringing her children to Sunday school meant more to her than than work, than parties and everything else. We want modern Susan Wesley's &gt;&gt; mothers that also have the same mindset. &gt;&gt; You know, he says, &gt;&gt; even amid the the most complex and busy years of her life as a mother, she still scheduled two hours each day for fellowship with God and time in his word. Suzanne Wesley had 17 17 to 19 children. &gt;&gt; Suzanne Wesley &gt;&gt; but not all her you know she lost about nine of her children from young age cuz from what I read during that time it was common for children to have a lot of kids because kids were dying a lot because of the condition. So she lost about nine kids. So she she stay with 10 or nine kids. &gt;&gt; And if you also read she was her husband was not always around because her husband was a minister but he also got arrested a few times because he had an issue paying his debt. So they used to arrest him a lot. So now she was staying herself with all those nine kids. But she still scheduled two hours each day. &gt;&gt; And then she had she had here. How do you pronounce this? &gt;&gt; I dared. &gt;&gt; She adared to that schedule faithfully. &gt;&gt; The challenge was finding a place of privacy in a house filled to overflowing with children. Mother's Wesley, you know what she was doing? So, Mother's Wesley's solution to this &gt;&gt; because she couldn't find any privacy. I think she only had a one bedroom to solution to this was to bring her Bible to her favorite chair and throw her long apron over her head. forming a sort of tent. &gt;&gt; So she so she created her own room &gt;&gt; which was just putting a tent over her head. This became something uh akin to the tent of meeting. Uh let me see. And when Susanna was under the apron, she was with God and was not to be disturbed. I have to end because of time. &gt;&gt; Let me see where I can close. You know, and there are places where the prophet also talks about Suzanne Wesley. Suzanne Wesley. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll continue this next time. &gt;&gt; So, we need more mothers like Susan Wesley. Mothers that prioritize the the the the upbringing of your children. You know, end with this quote, hear his voice. The prophet says in paragraph 80, but listen to his still small small voice. Every one of you people who profess to be Christians, get yourself quiet before him. Don't let the washing hinder. Don't let the work hinder. Don't let nothing hinder. So, in other words, don't have excuses. Don't let nobody know what you're doing. Just go before him. Get up in the woods somewhere. Get out in the Get out on the side of the road. Go into the secret closet and close the door. When the kids get at school, they get down on your knees. You know, when the kids go at school, get down on your knees. You have heard all kinds of voices everywhere. But just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up. &gt;&gt; We live in an age where our children more prayer more than they need prayer more than ever. Mothers, I encourage you to pray for your children. Read them Bible stories. When they grow up, they will not depart from you. Be the shield. Be the protection for your children. The prayer of a mother can never be replaced. Children, do you love your parents? You also need to respect your mothers. You need to respect to respect them. They go through a lot to make sure that we are taken care of. I even read another place where the prophet says take care of your parents when you grow up. Because the prophet says because when you couldn't take care of yourself, they took care of you. Don't give them a hard time. Pray for your parents and mothers. Pray for your children. Husband, pray for your wife. Let's um let's pray. Um you know if you just want to lay your hands on your mothers or your wives or your parents children raise lay your hands on your mother and mother on your children. Let's just make a family prayer. And if you don't have prayer for them at home and anywhere no even for your wives because they're to be future mothers. And let's pray. Dear heavenly father Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord God for your word. We thank you heavenly father Lord that you have given us guidance by your prophet on how to raise our children. And we thank you father Lord that you have given us good mothers Lord Jesus and mothers who prioritize raising us Lord Jesus. And heavenly father Lord for giving us an understanding that they also have a ministry is to raise their children Lord. But you know there are a lot of trials. There are a lot of things they have to go through Lord and challenges and especially in this year in churches with the economy of the hour. Sometimes they have to go to work but Lord in their hearts they still have a desire to to to take care of the children. Lord I pray that you give them grace Lord. I pray that you give them wisdom Lord that heavenly father Lord and patience to raise the children in the way that the Lord intends. Lord I pray father Lord that you give them the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus so that the Holy Ghost through them may train their child Lord Jesus. I pray heavenly father Lord that you help our children to be obedient to the parents. Heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ the message tells us that Malachi's mission was to restore us back to the faith of our fathers. Lord we saw last time that we preached that restoration of the altar Lord restoring the altar in the homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may you restore the altar in each and every one of our house that now parents take take it very importantly, Lord Jesus, to sit down together their children around them and teach them Bible stories. Lord, protect those kids too, Lord, when they go to schools. Lord, parents, they can do as much as they can. But Lord, you are the greatest father, Lord Jesus, because you said that a mother can't even forget her own king, but you can never forget your children, Lord Jesus. Father Lord, I pray that you give your mercy and your grace to this church. That heavenly father Lord, I pray that the parents of this church be the best parents in the city of Deon. I pray that the parents in this church be the best parents in the state of Iowa, Lord Jesus. Why? Because we have received the light. We have received the message. And the Bible says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet. Guide us, Lord Jesus." Bless this church. Bless the pastor. Bless his family. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Brother, Amen.
