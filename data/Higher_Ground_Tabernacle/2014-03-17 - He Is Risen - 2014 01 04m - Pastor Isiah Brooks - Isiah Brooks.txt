TRANSCRIPT
========================================
St John 201 not going to the time we're just going to go right on might sound like a little Easter message this morning but I trust that you're blessed with it by the grace of God St John 20 and 11 but Mary stood without the supplier weeping as she wept she stood down and looked into the Sela and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had Lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou and she said unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom whom excuse me why weepest thou whom seekest thou and she supposing him to be the gardener said unto her him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away now listen she was so Disturbed she says I will take take him away one woman amen and Jesus said unto her Mary she turned herself and said unto him Ro ranai which is to say master Jesus said unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her we're going to jump down to the 28th verse of the same chapter and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God and Jesus said unto him Thomas because thou have seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed give me one more scripture St Luke 24 St Luke 24 and 5 how many y'all believe he's living amen it it should Beyond should be beyond that now it's your your sight should be Faith amen amen you your faith shall be sight excuse me amen Luke uh uh 24 and5 and it came to pass and they as they were much perplexed I'm sorry and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why SE ye the living among the dead let us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord truly you have been good to us and we thank you for being so real to us you've been better to us Lord than we have been to ourselves and we pray father that you bless the service in a special way Lord we ask these Saints in Jesus Christ's name give us Grace to move completely out of your way that you might speak to your people father cleanse us of all unrighteousness every thought action or deed that we may have done Lord I pray father that you take Lord the fire from the altar Lord and burn every demon away from us Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I just like to uh uh uh entitled the message he is risen now now I want to personalize it and you must do likewise he is risen in me now we come at a time that uh we're getting ready to see a translation I believe that with all of my heart it is not something that we could manufacture or produce ourselves but it is something that God has already determined in his mind in his forign knowledge and uh I am really excited about it now we we see by the grace of God in this uh particular uh setting where Jesus had been now crucified and he had been laying in the grave for three days and of course there had been talk going about that he wasn't going to get up and I'm sure he's like some of the others that have forerun him that claimed to have been the Messiah and uh we realize by the grace of God that even at this time it's it's a shame to say it but his own disciples amen uh were in doubt and didn't believe but there were those women amen who uh were still in love with him even though it seems like the uh the end of their Vision or the end of their dream had come amen they still was in love with with him and this is what I love about it because amen when you are are even when it doesn't seem like uh God is living in you or you you you know something has happened it's something about the True Body of Christ they they love the body of Christ and understand she was going to anoint the body of Christ amen even in her pain even in her sorrow amen she was on her way down to anoint the body of Christ you know that's a lesson we ought to know it ought to be something we should learn that our pain and our hurt and our sorrow should mean less to us amen when it comes Amen to anointing the body of Christ but we find out by the grace of God she has her uh coming down there's some historical some powerful things happening and I don't want to get ahead of myself cuz I'm excited but we find out amen that you know the prophet God and I'll read it in just a minute but he talks about how you know the the Roman soldiers you know the seal amen over this particular grave was a big Stone and it took about aund men to roll that stone in position now here this woman they must have been coming in faith because they themselves could not eroll that stone back but they wanted to anoint the body and they had faith that somehow God was going to take care of it I don't know how the stone is going to be rolled back but God will take care of it and I could see them amen as they walking down and you know they they see these things and you know we we realize by the grace of God that h a powerful thing was happening Heaven no doubt was looking at this thing and and and wondering amen what it was all about but we find out amen as they as they uh began to approach uh the the uh uh place where Jesus laid brother random describ it he said that morning star began to move out of his place Hallelujah out of all the years it's been hanging up there all of a sudden he began to move out of his place a little bit amen and the Bible said it's shut down I mean the prophet of God said it's shut down amen from heaven like a ball of fire and it stood there like Mighty Angels Hallelujah I love this and I'm going to read it to you in just a minute but then he goes on and and we find out by the grace of God that we we we we we know that the Romans would have loved for that stone to remain you see the world have always been trying to get rid of God they've always always tried to seal him in somewhere lock him down amen like they doing right now in our day and age they're trying to lock him down they're trying to keep him sealed in amen but I'm going explain to you in just a moment what it's all about so we realize by the grace of God this is a great earthquake and I love this cuz every time I think about the Great Earthquake I think about the great earthquake that we're looking forward to you say well I'm not looking forward to it but yes I am hallelujah amen because I realize at this great and this the way I believe it that at this great uh earthquake like it was in that day there's going to be a mighty Resurrection Hallelujah come on somebody amen with the dead in Christ your rise amen and those that are remain shall going to be quickened and changed in a moment's time I believe that amen so I look at this thing and I think how that the Romans still trying to you know and I was talking with brother Cam and somehow we were on the same line of thought when I was there in Ohio and you know he preached a message kind of with this party and and I did too and so he said man how can it was the same Spirit but let me put it this way amen that seal was broken now watch this because amen the Roman seal still exist but what is it is a spiritual seal it is a seal that seem to keep God in the Tomb remember the angel said why seek you living among the dead amen because let me say it like this amen the Roman seal today amen is just you know it's not so visible amen with the eye but it's such a spiritual uh H seal that has got the people of God in a state of comos a lack of alertness you know you conscious you can hear amen but you can't respond y'all know what I'm talking about just like now some of us amen you're hearing the word but you can't even say a amen right you're not alert to what's actually happening you can hear it amen but you can't even respond to it that's a state of Kos Hallelujah come on somebody oh that same Spirit of sealing you in sealing God you might have him in there but the Romans seal got traditions and and the way churches behave got got you sealed in or got him sealed in there so he can't even express himself think about it amen you think about a corpse it's cold it's stiff it's starchy come on somebody amen you can talk to it and it won't respond hallelujah amen but I'm hoping and trusting that you're not corpses this morning I'm hoping and trusting by the grace of God that maybe there's a seal of the Roman amen holding you back but I hope this morning you can break the seal let God respond out of your natural body Hallelujah glory to God when we realize amen what God God has done for us he's done a mighty thing the Bible says amen according to Romans 4:25 who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification that means amen by the grace of God Amen he went to hell for us amen when we should have gone to Hell Hallelujah he suffered the whippings he suffered the beatings amen from Jehovah God that we should have gotten Hallelujah the Bible said with his stripes we are healed not going to be healed we're already healed Hallelujah glory to God Amen you got to realize amen that not only did he go to hell for you but he went to heaven for you Hallelujah the Bible says amen thou has ascended on high and thou has led captivity captive thou have received gifts from men yes sir for the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them Hallelujah so what did God do amen he went heaven and he just didn't stay up there Hallelujah but the Bible said he descended that's what he told his disciples he said it's good that I go back to the father he said and when I go back there he's going to send a comforter Hallelujah and when that comforter come Hallelujah he will be God hallelujah it'll be the same God Amen that raised me up Hallelujah Romans amen Paul picked that thing up and said if the Same Spirit be in you that was also in Christ it as it quickened his body it'll also Quicken yours hallelujah amen that is the only Power that'll break the Roman Shield hallelujah oh you said the Roman Shield is religious amen it's religious amen it knows how to act in a Pious way Hallelujah but God ain't looking for that kind of an anointing God want a freedom in his people why because when Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and he whom the Son of God has set free is free indeed oh my oh my if we could understand what all God did for us at Calvary amen the Bible says amen by the grace of God he told Mary he said now y'all don't don't touch me now I haven't ascended yet Hallelujah I've got to do something else here I done fixed it on Earth but I got to I got to fix it in heaven as well and the Bible said he went up there and he sprinkled the blood hallelujah what was it amen because the veil had already been rent Hallelujah on the face of the earth is that right the Bible said when he died Hallelujah the veil of the temple ran in Dain from the top to the bottom do you realize what that mean that means amen that you can go into the holies of holies that means that veil was so R amen that whosoever will let him come Hallelujah understand at this one point that only the priesthood could go in there and that was the high priest could only go there once a year Hallelujah and you know what when he came out of there he was not sad there's no way you can go into the holies of holies and come out sad hallelujah amen because when he went into the holies of holies he come out shouting Hallelujah the bells were ringing hallelujah holy holy holy holy holy holy that's the kind of a light that comes out when you come from behind the [Music] veil come on somebody because in behind the veil is Heavenly places hone oh let me let me let me not jump here amen because you got to realize amen what God has done for you I think we forgotten you know brother brand said that's the the greatest greatest sermon you could ever preach is on Calvary Hallelujah I don't care all these other Mysteries they're great but when you can bring a soul to Calvary and show them what God has done for them and how free they are hallelujah oh my it really whoops the devil every time is that all right oh my that same Spirit quickens you see it's not alone it's not enough I'm not saying you're not the word but I really believe that a lot of us need some quickenings Hallelujah come on somebody Jesus was born the word but he had to be quickened hallelujah oh my and you got to be quickened by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah think about it how come the Devil Couldn't keep Jesus in Hell why because the word of God had already gone out according to Psalm 16:10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to seek corruption Hallelujah I don't care devil hell could not keep Hallelujah the body of Jesus that never could it e either could it suffer corruption Hallelujah why cuz the word have been spoken it wasn't a his own power but it was by the power that was invested in him that's why Jesus could say no man can take my life I lay it down and I pick it up what was it that was a God in that flesh speaking hallelujah oh my can't No Grave hold this body down Hallelujah why because I got the same anointing The Same Spirit the same Holy Ghost the same seal on the inside of my soul am oh my think about it he goes to hell that's right there ain't there ain't a real Christian true Christian where Satan could hold them by way of hell no sir no sir no sir amen because the Bible Why didn't it say I will not he said I will not see let his body his body his body seek corruption hallelujah hallelujah you this what brother Brooks I've been having a hard time but the blood Prevail Hallelujah God will never let his body see corruption and that means you and me Hallelujah never the word has already gone out Hallelujah think about it he is risen folks he is risen and he's living in us but the only way he got the the the stone must be rolled away Hallelujah that stone that that you allow Satan to place in front of the entrance amen remember there's only one way in and one way out Hallelujah so understand when the Holy Ghost seals you he seals you in and he seals the world out Hallelujah I'm here in Christ Jesus what do you say brother right now I'm sitting in Heavenly places Hallelujah not tomorrow right now I have been raptured right now I have been translated right now I'm sitting Before the Throne of God hallelujah so is every believer see with the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen the the bride is Victorious folks Hallelujah think about it she's Victorious and no one can stop her from being that no devil in hell why because the price has already been paid Hallelujah the price has already been paid you said what Brother Bruce look like I'm just you know you know one thing I'm going tell you something God know how to get a stirred up hallelujah how many times oh Lord I want to be on fire don't you worry if you bride of Jesus he going to get you on fire hall hallelujah that day coming and it's coming fast hallelujah amen and I'm going to tell you something by the grace of God I ain't worried about nothing Hallelujah I'm not even scared about anything h no matter what my lion I say to me I realize by the grace of God that God's word stands ass sure and it come back forward Hallelujah I'm not going to allow Satan to deceive me Hallelujah because if I would have looked at the corpse of Jesus I would have said there is no way there's no way he could live again look how beaten he up he doesn't even look like a man he's so he's so swollen and so beaten he he just looked like a piece of slab hallelujah hallelujah but what they didn't understand that the god that put in there was the same God that created him Hallelujah and that same God hallelujah will change these moral bodies into immortality amen it doesn't matter what he does to us on this end is what God has already determined oh Hallelujah to God thank you Jesus oh my oh my oh my oh don't you love the Lord let me just read a little bit here just slow it down a little bit amen you know you look at this thing and say well brother Brooks why are you so excited because I realize by the grace of God that Satan is moving in a fast pace and you know what I can't help it amen you're going to have Believers make Believers and non-believers I I I'm just so glad that he made me a Believer Hallelujah and that's what you got I don't know about nobody else I just know what he's made me Hallelujah and I'm so thankful for her because I realize my day is coming you know I don't think Jesus went to the Grave worrying about whether he was going to get up or not he already knew the time Hallelujah before 3 days up I'm out of this place and you got to realize by the grace of God what he did amen because you know what I don't know how he did it all in three days but he went down into Satan's territory the Bible say he went into the Lord's hell he went down there where the devil was himself amen and he went down there and that devil said oh yeah I got you boy amen you've been mine you know I don't know who you think you are but you mine now you don't come into my territory but you see he didn't realize what the blood was all about hallelujah hallelujah he may have looked at the BL blood of goats and Bulls and calves and all of that stuff amen but when it came to the blood of Jesus it wasn't the antitype it was a real thing hallelujah oh my it was a real thing amen and so what he goes down and Jesus you know I'm sure he wasn't looking frail anymore that was only his flesh that was beat up but as a as a as a God as God he walks down and and he looks at Satan brother said he illustrates it like this he knock knocked on the door so it must be a door to the hell amen H he knocks on the door and here Satan comes out oh he looks through the people I got you now amen he didn't know what Jesus was packing though he probably thought he was going to put him in Chains and pull him on in Hallelujah Jes Jesus amen knocked the door Satan opened the door amen had the keys on his side brother said he gave him one big little B kicked him back in his snatched the keys Hallelujah took away the keys of death Hell In The Grave hallelujah oh no doubt the the news went about you know what I mean Satan is defeated so all the Devils of Hell knew that if Satan Was Defeated they were too Hallelujah glory to God and you know what he didn't didn't stop there he didn't stop there he remembered all the Old Testament Saints those who died in faith he remembered amen the man on the cross he said this day you'll be with me in Paradise so you know he had a time span he had to hurry up and get through with it he goes up amen and you know they having Revival Amen in that region because that called Paradise because they done heard what happening amen hallelujah now realize Paradise you can see amen from Paradise into hell amen so they can see it w come on somebody they can see Jesus whipping the devil hallelujah oh my the next stop up hallelujah it's Paradise come on somebody amen he opened the doors amen is that right brother said they were having a testimony service Hallelujah Joel was saying oh my God he said listen he said I tell you what I I know about this man this man that that that I met on the ash Heep Hallelujah that's what he said Hallelujah he says listen he said all I know is that I saw him in the resurrection W Hallelujah I had boils all over me I had all kinds of Swords all over me but I said though the skin worms eat up this flesh in my flesh I see the Lord I can see him as he go through the door said look your voice the same man all he is standing at the door Hallelujah glory to God come on over here Abraham Abraham walks over say come on Sirah look at him this is the same man I saw walk in the cool of the evening Jesus opened the door went in and said come on boys we ain't got much time Hallelujah let's get up out of here oh come on somebody now think about it when they saw they were getting they being delivered to they were well he's here about time he get here no sir those people were really excited you know I'm not I'm not I hope yall all right with me not saying it exactly but the thought about what he's saying now here we look at this thing we find out about the grace of God Amen they they getting up and brother say Abraham and say said Lord is it all right if we stop by Earth can we just get a little time to walk around yes yes yes go ahead and walk around amen is that right the Bible said there were men in the city that saw them they appeared to many Hallelujah come on somebody and we're approaching that day hallelujah we're going to see a many people hallelujah that perhaps have gone onoo glory to God everybody won't be able to see him they going to think I'm PL crazy for real hallelujah oh my when my old Mama steps out Hallelujah to God let me tell you something now you talking about a man acting like a fool you going to see one oh my God now you say oh brother Brooks what how can it be all I know is that I believe it let me let me put it in prophet's word here so you know I'm still with the thought and the true Easter se he says stay there stay there for a while it's true he stayed there for those three days and nights but on that set on that set time I'm G say it again on that set time which the scripture says hallelujah on that time when he said destroy this body and on the third day I'll rise it up again is that right he said then there's nothing can stop the scripture Hallelujah there's nothing that can stop the scripture it's got to come to pass and that's that seal was broken and he rose up the same Jesus alive again forever more and some 1900 years or maybe I'll say rose up and the same Jesus alive again I'm sorry 1900 years or maybe I'll say 14 or 1500 years the churches have had him sealed away but he said it shall come to pass in the last days said the Lord there's nothing going to stop it there will be light in the evening time amen that work that I do shall you also it shall be light in the evening time I don't care how many seals you try to put over it God will break every seal he broke the Seal of the Tomb he broke the Seal of hell he broke the Seal of death he broke the Seal of the grave and arose forever more triumph over the grave death hell tombs and every man-made thing there was to show that he was God and cannot be sealed away from the people anymore I don't care who you think you are if God is in you the seal will be Broken Hallelujah why because we have come to declare that he's alive and that he's risen Hallelujah it just reminded me amen how throughout the church ages amen they had him locked up amen during those Dark Ages is that right he had been in the Tomb for a long time Hallelujah but something started happening hallelujah amen here come Luther Justified Halle preaching justification on the first day Hallelujah didn't get him up hallelujah oh but on the second day Hallelujah sanctification amen came Wesley Hallelujah didn't get him up Hallelujah but oh my on the third day Hallelujah was was the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it was like Lazarus being delivered on the fourth day Hallelujah glory to God when he stepped out of the Tomb amen the prophet of God said God called Lazar by name had not he called Lazarus the whole grave site would have got up Hallelujah come on somebody and when God raised Jesus from the daddy would call by name amen hallelujah amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen brought him back to life come on somebody he stood up there and here Jesus said to the woman take those grave clothes off of him loose the man and let him go Hallelujah so was it amen with Lazarus amen who's a type of the Bride laying in the grave for 4 days hallelujah amen he couldn't be loose to the message of the hour came Hallelujah the baptism of the Holy Ghost was good but we needed the voice we needed the shout we needed the trumpet by the grace of God and that voice shou and trumpet said loose a man and let him go you don't believe that amen where do you find Lazarus the next thing you find Lazarus he was sitting at the dining table Hallelujah feasting on the word of God hallelujah and they still wanted to kill him hallelujah amen they tried to keep this old this old this this body in the grave but you can't keep him Hallelujah you can't keep Jesus in the grave Hallelujah why because he's the god of the living and the dead hallelujah oh nothing could hold him he broke away every seal with the great Easter seal that he was sealed with and he said the same seal that I I wear you shall wear also and the seal that I wear it shall do the same thing when you seal oh my God I'm

a decision Rome is still in your life not all of you know but if if you're allowing Rome to make you make a decision cuz Rome will you may not see him now or her now but she's making decisions in your life she's she's she's now that same Roman Spirit think about it that the true Pentecostal church that started in Acts well is the Roman Church Rome that's where they started shouting running jumping living for God you know what no holy Pope and holy Bishop was no saint this and saint that it was all Jesus that they used to be that but look at the spirit that took them over and where they are now come on somebody look at the Pentecostal churches look at the message churches that same anointing amen is still living among the churches and if we're not careful amen we'll start idolizing individuals because they got something you ain't got Hallelujah but it's for everybody whosoever we I got a fire you ought to have a fire and not one of us are more holier than the other there's only one holy and that's Jesus himself but look at us oh that man of God that's sister of God or that no sir sir sir if she's a man of God if he's a man of God or a sister of God it's only because God is in God is in me too amen you might be a pitcher but I might be a cup Hallelujah come on somebody amen you might be a Pitch I might be a cup but you you the picture so you can pour something in me amen come on that's the way it is we work together here hallelujah we're still on the same table laid out in the same dining room come on somebody one might be a fog other one might be a spoon but we're there Hallelujah on the same table Hallelujah surely there are things the spoon can do that the fork can't design a spoon Hallelujah you don't get mad at the spoon and say oh spoon I can't hardly stand you because what you can do no no no the spoon look at you said but look at all the things you can do I can't do you could pick up a piece of meat I could only I'm good for soup but you you see what I'm saying the same same same family you got a fork spoon knife you know the whole thing and the all work together at the dinner table oh my am I making sense amen let's move on by the grace of God and I was fresh from Heaven amen look at this he said they could they could they could destroy the body but they could not never destroy the seal amen destroy the prophets they raised them up another they kept destroying but God give them something then that they could not destroy it's the supernatural spirit it's the Holy Ghost it's self it's infallible what the Holy Ghost is infallible Hallelujah and is imperishable W it cannot be destroyed that means the Holy Ghost cannot be destroyed infallible you mean the god that talks to me every day amen's infallible yes sir and guess what if I listen to him all the time I would become in oo why is that he is an infallible God in Me W come on somebody he's trying to get us to that place amen where there'll be no spot or blemish Hallelujah he's trying to get us to that place come on somebody where God fail he cannot fail Hallelujah he cannot fail Hallelujah is alive on on he lives on and on and on and because he live we live with him because we're sealed into the body of our Lord Jesus Christ no way no way to ever be destroyed cannot perish but has eternal life amen now you can say well that's the word that's the word of God I was teaching young people Amen in Sunday school the prophet is the mouthpiece of God God speaks through him is that right amen come on somebody y'all remember that amen coming from the same seal said God great Rippling of the seal he also broke another seal I Want to Break of here and I told you about that when man had sinned and separated himself from the presence of God and he came to worship god there was was a veil that hung between the holy and the holiest of holies amen and God what he did he just didn't rip the the break the broke the Roman seal but he broke the the seal in your life hello he broke my seal oh when he rent that Veil Amen on Calvary he was showing I'm going to rent every believer's Veil Hallelujah that I might come into them hallelujah amen remember about remember

will the Sinner and the ungodly appear that person that reject the way that person that knows better that person that's been revealed to him and he still refuses to walk in God's way what will happen to that person what is going to be oh yes he broke the seal and kept us kept us from the Shan of Glory because sin was finished now now the seal is a sign of a finished work and we know that a seal like you going to a seal of box CAU well they put all the work in it and stored everything up and then it sealed till its destination and any seal is a finished work heyen come on somebody it's a finished work and no devil can break it no devil can break it I don't care no devil can break it Hallelujah and that's where we all get all mixed up oh my God I just been so look at look at all the mistakes I've made Hallelujah you think God made a mistake when he chose you he saw your mistakes before he he chose you it never it never was because you were so good that's why he chose you come on somebody it never was and it never will be we faultless how we we're we're a faulty people amen from the beginning huh this old flesh ain't no good you know what tame a mu that's all your flesh is IM it'll never be tamed you just got to keep him harnessed keep him yolked up you got to try to control him like the prophet of God said as soon as he can give you a kick he'll give you a good one like that's a real mu your flesh ain't nothing but a mu baby yours ain't but I know what mine is uh my never sealed it it's is finished now the blood of ghosts and heers and so forth would not take away sin but when this was finished that Calvary took away sin now watch see what I'm trying to tell us we God can't help you if you don't have faith in it you got to believe what you're hearing well I ain't seen nothing yet don't worry about it have faith in God you believe God and it will work its way out of you you can't hurry God God does it his own time in his own way come on now you got to look at this that Lazarus in the grave four days brother B said if that woman would have came up there and said listen here Jesus we were faithful to you and you let my brother die he she he said if she would have come with that attitude she would have gotten anything but she said Lord we know that in the resurrection my brother going to live again she knew how to approach the word not with Attitude she knew how to approach the word and she said but Lord he said but didn't I say if you believe you shall see I am the resurrection oh you don't have to put me in the future I am I am the Savior I am the deliverer I am the resurrection I'm your healer I'm your friend I'm your Lord I'm your God I'm whatever you let me be that's who I am not tomorrow right now right now hallelujah amen we we cannot be defeated we were born omnipotent we were born Hallelujah when you born again you're born Flawless y'all hear what I'm saying you're born of his seed and his seed is Flawless amen faultless pure holy that's what God looks at he ain't looking at this old Caterpillar share you got come on somebody you love the Lord he's risen and it's up to us Amen to show what God is doing right now come on somebody we can't let the Roman seals seal us up you say well we the message we don't shout and dance no more you know too many movements too many move too much emotion too much this or that and the other and I said you know you you hear people talking like that they got a they got a spirit on and it ain't the Holy Ghost y'all hear what I'm saying I don't care where you are in what great church and who's I don't care if he rode with the prophet spoke with the prophet ate with the prophet drank with the prophet he's still my my Prophet I have one Prophet amen and let me tell you who that is it wasn't William Brandon it was a God in William Brandon Hallelujah come on somebody cuz that man would know nothing had not God spoken through him he was a vessel the true prophet of the age is the Holy Ghost he didn't know he didn't even know the seals he didn't even know the Thunders Hallelujah who gave it to him the same one that was able to open it Hallelujah the same God that opened the seals was the one that gave it to the prophet as a man he said I didn't know he said I was going to go back with the old school of thought that's right he said I thought the Antichrist that white horse rider he said I was I was taking because I don't read the other men's books I know they thought it was was the the the they thought it was the Holy Ghost that white horse R he said that's what I thought I was going to write that down till God told me no that's the Antichrist that's the one Paul said would come down like the angel of Light Hallelujah you got all these people amen I don't need a Dayan and a COR I want the one God saiding I don't need nothing Amen to be interpreted to me so I can be swallowed up I want to go to heaven yeah so let's move on graise God just give me a few more minutes but because we realize amen that he's living and we got our allow him to live We supposed to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth it listen if I told you and that's what's wrong don't you think you come here for a picnic now maybe I'm wrong but I've seen I've seen tons of movies and they fighting and they're in war and you talk about the guys that really got it and they know they got it or they they enjoy cutting them heads off I know that sound gruesome but they do they enjoy blowing them boom they enjoy whipping the devil and that's we supposed to enjoy it maybe I'm wrong but that's the way I look at it you know I know amen you know the word of God said don't Rejoice amen because of this you know you cast out these Devils but because your name is written in the book but he didn't say rejoice it wasn't right he said but the main thing is to Rejoice because your name is in the book y'all understand me see that was the rejoice it wasn't wrong it was wrong because of what they were rejoicing over you rejoice because your name is in the book Hallelujah but I don't believe when David slew Goliath amen David's head went down like oh my God I didn't really mean to kill you no sir he wanted to make sure he was eternally dead he didn't wait on the rock he finished it all he went down and he boom took the head off and he took the Bible said he grabbed this man's head and went around the towns like look at it look what my God has done that's shouting the victory Hallelujah that's a testimony and that's what God want us to do every time we whoop the devil we supposed to take it show his head around and said look what my God has done you don't feel sorry for him he ain't feeling sorry for you oh it's the truth you love the Lord amen let me give you one more scripture and I'm going to let you go and then we'll finish up this evening we got communion amen amen I don't know I want to go there let me just finish reading amen when you write a document then it's sealed at the end never sealed until it's finished now the blood of goats and heers and so forth would not take away sin but when this was finished at Calvary it took away sin now watch at the Garden of Eden to keep people from getting back to the tree god Set an anger there as a seal with a sword turning all the way to guard that tree and when he made his worship and he came down now remember who was at that tree who was that tree it was Jesus so he was there Jesus was there he was the tree that God was guarding that's why I said why can't people see the serpent seed because Jesus didn't ask uh Adam and Eve what told you he said who so the tree could talk and the only talking tree that was in there outside of Adam was the S so he was the tree of Good and Evil right Hallelujah come on somebody if he Jesus was the tree of of of life he was the tree of Good and Evil the tree of death was your mother and she brought you here in Natural Life Christ is the birth through spiritual life all that live by the woman die all that born of the man lives and all that comes by the woman is natural all come from the man is spiritual not the man here the man Christ Jesus see I'm so glad he said that cuz I almost can feel a man rolling his rolling his no it's Christ Jesus the man hallelujah amen and and watch the tree guarded it could not get back because there's no offering appr appropriated to take sin away so therefore when they come to worship the shikina glory was behind the veil sealed off from them it was sealed off from the Garden of Eden I can not get it through my head why anybody would not want to worship God in the Shina Globe stay there in the why would you want one out here in the outer Court the weather changes and you change right in the inner court amen the candles go out and you get dark and you can't even see where you're going but in the Shak of Glory it ain't by the son s o n un excuse me it's by the son s o n and that light is the same light that would light the city amen why wouldn't you want to live there it Blossom the Tree Blossom it bued brought forth almonds Hallelujah all it had to do was stay in that shikina you stay in the shikina you won't have to worry about the fruit of the spirit you won't have to worry about gifts you won't have to worry about nothing amen cuz God God will produce it through you just you being in his presence will make the change amen you don't change that tree that little limb that Rod just stood there didn't have nothing to do amen but stand there in the presence and God did the rest that's all we got to do and was the tree God it it could could not get back because there's no offering appropriated to take sin away so therefore when they come to worship the kind of Glory was behind the veil sealed off from them it was sealed off from them from The Garden of even but when the day of Pentecost came brother when Jesus died there at Calvary and finished the work he didn't seal men out he sealed man inside with himself wo and now we're sealed up and shut up in the presence of the of the shakina glory that's the only shut up I want to be shut up in the presence of God amen oh my not only we are sealed in but we're sealed in eternally amen oh I love that sealed inside now I going to stop there but I said to the people of God there even I said you know and I've said it here before you don't have the Holy Ghost you go adopt the baby say you need to go adopt B you know what he mean he said you take that you say you go in ad do one you said I got it you nurture it I got it that's right he said everyone that normally adopts a baby who cannot have a baby they soon get the baby so if you ain't got it you keep saying I got it you nurture it amen and you feel like jumping you jump you say amen amen amen don't let the devil condemn you that's your baby that's your baby you adopted I got it I got it and I'm going to nurture it amen to God give me my own [Music] Hallelujah glory to God is that true let's stand by the grace of God Jesus Jesus Jesus he's risen folks he's risen he's risen he's risen we cannot be ashamed of this gospel I I just I want to stand on a corner and just scream when I see what's happening Amen to p I don't care they might think I'm crazy don't worry about it it's coming cuz I feel the pool I feel the pool and let me tell you something you're going to either be proud of your past or ashamed of him because I'm I'm I'm I feel the poor soon as he give me the okay I'm out on the corner that's where I started that's where I end it'll either CA a Revival or it'll cause of persecution that's all I know that's all I know cuz I'm tired of the Devil Ride in this country AR riding in this city when the Bride of Jesus Christ is here you got to let Jesus we got to come up out of this tomb and let people know he's risen we got to come up out of this tomb we can't let the devil just get get get uh victory over our lives we've got to let God have free course in our lives and it doesn't matter what difference does it make if you live 10 or 20 more years and you still guard a your your supreme authority come on I'm going way you well brother what if you ain't got it well at least I want to let him know whose side I'm on that's right I'm going to let him know whose side I'm on I'm not on the devil's side amen come on I'm
