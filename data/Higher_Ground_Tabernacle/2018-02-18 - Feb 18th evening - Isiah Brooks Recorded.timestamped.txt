[0:31] now they allowed you entering into that
[0:35] that stage 13 years old
[0:38] Abraham following quickly behind him we
[0:42] think awful it's goodness a man
[0:44] bromas 1 through 2 I beseech you
[0:48] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[0:52] that you present your bodies a living
[0:54] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[0:58] is your reasonable service be not
[1:01] conformed to this world but be
[1:03] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:05] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:09] acceptable and perfect will of God one
[1:16] more scripture Hebrews 10:23 Hebrews
[1:27] 10:23

[1:42] faith without wavering for he is
[1:46] faithful that promised great is his
[1:54] faithfulness that is pray father God we
[1:57] thank you for your grace we thank you
[1:59] for your mercy we thank you for being so
[2:03] good to us we thank you for this little
[2:05] group Lord that faithful Corps that no
[2:08] matter what they're here Lord we we're
[2:11] with thankful Lord I know you're mindful
[2:13] because I am Lord and I pray father that
[2:17] you bless this group Lord with a special
[2:19] blessing Lord anoint them with a double
[2:22] portion of your Holy Spirit Lord bring
[2:25] us all into that perfect statue of
[2:27] Christ Lord God that's why we come
[2:30] because we hunger and thirst for your
[2:31] righteousness and you said if we hunger
[2:34] and thirst for your righteousness Lord
[2:36] we shall be filled
[2:38] thank you Jesus for the thirst
[2:40] hallelujah thank you for the hunger
[2:42] hallelujah Lord we give you glory we
[2:45] give you praise we give you honor in
[2:47] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[2:49] you may be seated I hope the speakers
[2:53] are not too loud for you my son was I'm
[2:56] okay as just I want to I was I started
[3:03] preaching on the streets without a
[3:06] microphone so when I have a microphone
[3:10] you know plus the street that loudness I
[3:13] know it kind of we don't want to pierce
[3:15] your ears of make them hurt but it's
[3:19] kind of funny I really appreciate who he
[3:23] was kind of joking a little bit but I
[3:24] took it you know as a word of wisdom we
[3:27] don't we want you to be comfortable we
[3:30] want you to we definitely want you to
[3:32] hear but we don't want you to hear so a
[3:35] man you got to get your ears checked
[3:36] later on so we thank God for His
[3:39] goodness we thank him for his grace amen
[3:42] by God's grace we don't we don't we
[3:44] don't we don't forget finally at some
[3:45] point time we get this sound system fix
[3:48] Amen so the volume and everything will
[3:50] be comfortable for everybody but
[3:52] little by little we thank God for His
[3:54] grace and His mercy I didn't mean it
[3:56] they can feel uncomfortable but I
[3:57] thought I was a blessing from him not to
[4:00] nothing other than that you know we look
[4:02] at ourselves and we understand by God's
[4:05] grace we cannot cleanse ourselves I just
[4:13] wish we could in some ways but I know
[4:16] because in other ways I know God cleanse
[4:19] you it's going to be thorough I might
[4:21] leave a spot I might leave an area that
[4:24] that is not you know I mean taken care
[4:27] of but God sees everything that needs to
[4:30] be done we realized they meant by the
[4:33] grace of God that the blood of Jesus
[4:35] Christ is the only thing that can
[4:37] cleanse us you've heard me say this
[4:40] before I can wash my face I can wash my
[4:43] feet I can wash most of my body even if
[4:47] I got me one of those tools I can even
[4:48] wash my back but only God can wash the
[4:51] heart it is in the place that God sought
[4:55] to place it see if God wanted us to wash
[4:58] out hard he could have taken that hot
[5:00] same heart and put it outside somewhere
[5:02] so it would be easy accessible but God
[5:05] put it in a place where we can't reach
[5:07] it and only the hands of God can go in
[5:10] there and reach that heart and cleanse
[5:11] it and I am so grateful to the Lord that
[5:14] he fixed it that way you know because I
[5:17] realized by the grace of God that we are
[5:20] under the mercies and grace of God I
[5:22] don't believe in you heard me say this
[5:24] many times before God did not call us
[5:29] with the calling to tease us in other
[5:32] words if God said he's gonna do
[5:34] something he's going to do it you know
[5:37] God don't say come to me and as soon as
[5:39] you try to come to him he folds his arms
[5:41] up and run from you know when he says
[5:44] come he means come and the Bible said if
[5:47] any man come unto me I will in no wise
[5:49] cast him out so we have an assurance
[5:52] that if we come to God God will never
[5:54] cast us out amen he will always take
[5:57] care of us he will always keep us it
[6:00] doesn't mean that will not suffer
[6:02] because the Bible said greatest
[6:04] affliction many other fliction of the
[6:05] righteous
[6:06] not the sinners but we know they're
[6:09] going to have affliction but the Bible
[6:11] said many are the afflictions of the
[6:13] righteous is that right many of the
[6:15] trials but God will deliver them from
[6:18] all of them not some but all and many
[6:22] times we fail to see that God's Word is
[6:24] true
[6:25] hallelujah when we see the Scriptures
[6:28] the Bible said in our patience possess
[6:30] our souls waiting on God and waiting for
[6:33] God is two way the Prophet taught us
[6:35] letting go and letting God is the way
[6:38] God prophet taught us and we realize
[6:41] here men that is not always hard easy to
[6:45] let things go
[6:45] it's like a baboon or not calling
[6:49] everybody a baboon or a monkey but one
[6:52] of those things about one of the
[6:54] characteristics of a monkey and of a
[6:55] boon when they see something glitter and
[6:57] shiny and go you know just it fascinates
[7:01] them and you know that's how he used to
[7:04] catch raccoons play something in a
[7:06] position where when the moonlight or the
[7:09] sunlight would hit it more like the moon
[7:11] but they would stick their hand in there
[7:13] and grab it but it would be too big for
[7:15] them to let go and you could walk right
[7:17] up on him and he wouldn't let the thing
[7:19] go because he values it more than his
[7:21] life you know and that's how sometimes
[7:23] we do I mean in the spiritual realm
[7:27] something that glitters something that
[7:29] glows you know it looks really beautiful
[7:31] it's difficult for us especially if our
[7:35] desire is given over to it it's
[7:37] difficult for us to let it go but it's
[7:40] not difficult for God God is the only
[7:44] one that can help us release all of the
[7:47] things that will endanger our souls and
[7:50] we ought to be grateful that God is
[7:53] faithful to that is that right oh it's
[7:57] nothing but the truth I mean you think
[7:59] at look at Samson who's a man of faith
[8:02] I love Samson amen Samson was a man a
[8:05] man whose weakness was women hello
[8:10] and the devil gonna give you whatever
[8:12] your Wheaton whatever he found that
[8:13] weakness is he will send them to you
[8:16] there it is right there you know and
[8:19] Samson was call
[8:20] to the ministry he was called to do a
[8:22] great work for God he whipped the
[8:25] Philistines a minute times but then here
[8:28] came the choice of his life the one
[8:31] woman that fascinated him the most and
[8:33] she was Delilah and the Lila's plan was
[8:37] to destroy Samson her desire was not
[8:41] true love her desire was deceit and in
[8:46] that deceiving him a man he fell in love
[8:48] with her truly fell in love with her and
[8:50] what happened she eventually cut his
[8:53] strength off when she cut his strength
[8:56] off she then then betrayed him by being
[9:00] an informer she him the Philistine
[9:02] soldiers Army soldiers amen
[9:05] where he was and what he was doing and
[9:08] she's also said now I have taken it
[9:11] straight when she took his strength he
[9:15] lost everything even his eyesight but
[9:19] God was faithful hallelujah we find that
[9:25] Samson finds himself in a place and he's
[9:28] crying out to God and says Oh Lord once
[9:31] more how many of you have found yourself
[9:33] in that place more than once more than
[9:41] once have I found myself in that place
[9:43] Oh Lord
[9:44] once more it is okay to be revealed it's
[9:50] okay I'm not back we ought to be
[9:51] refilled every day and you know we see
[9:55] all of these things and you saying well
[9:56] Brotherhood's what are you saying see
[9:58] there's only one man who was perfect and
[10:00] that one man was Jesus Christ himself
[10:03] none of us will ever measure up to that
[10:05] standard and the only way that we could
[10:08] ever come to that standard would be by
[10:11] him you see it was the life in Christ
[10:14] that was perfect that's what the
[10:18] prophets said and so therefore you and I
[10:20] must understand even up to the time of
[10:23] the rapture because of this you would be
[10:27] capable of faltering maga
[10:30] doesn't look at this because this is
[10:33] already judged this is already condemned
[10:37] this part of you will never go to heaven
[10:41] the way it is is that right
[10:43] Amen though this thing of you go down in
[10:46] the grave when it comes back up it will
[10:48] be transformed it will be changed into a
[10:52] glorified body y'all understand me
[10:55] because oftentimes people think that
[10:57] Christians are perfect and we are but
[11:00] our perfection is of Christ and not of
[11:03] ourselves Alleluia
[11:05] I am so grateful Amen that because of
[11:09] that I see how God and this is that this
[11:12] is the hidden mystery I love it you know
[11:14] how you can see the fall of woman's
[11:17] belly the Aerostars our flat and then it
[11:20] started protruding protruding but you
[11:22] never see the image the image is veiled
[11:27] for nine months now big they got
[11:30] machines now but before the machines you
[11:33] could never see what was in there you
[11:35] could never see it whether it was a boy
[11:36] you can see where there was a girl you
[11:38] can see whether the hair was big or
[11:40] small but it was a product that was
[11:44] being produced behind a veil of flesh
[11:49] and just like that lump can not
[11:53] determine you know or you can't
[11:55] determine what gender it is or what it
[11:57] looks like whether it's redhead or black
[11:59] hair and a blue-eyed or whatever the
[12:00] case may be all of that that genetics
[12:04] and everything that goes too long to
[12:07] make a baby is there moving and you know
[12:09] you know doing things that you can't see
[12:12] sometimes the mother may feel it kicking
[12:14] and that kicking is just to you know let
[12:16] you know the baby still alive right
[12:18] sometimes that's what the Holy goes
[12:20] through it it stands still for a while
[12:22] then it'll give you a couple of kicks
[12:23] every now and again just to let you know
[12:25] I'm still there and so you and I but the
[12:28] matter the thing about it is this when
[12:31] when that woman began to have that baby
[12:33] and and envied the process of the birth
[12:37] the water right did the blood right and
[12:40] then that baby comes through that
[12:42] channel and all of a sudden
[12:44] he takes that spirit now you see a
[12:47] glorious image hallelujah hello somebody
[12:52] that glorious image still has to be
[12:55] washed cleaned up prepared so that mom
[13:03] and daddy could hold it but the beauty
[13:08] of that birth is this when the neighbour
[13:12] cord is cut that child now is an
[13:18] individual before the navel cord is cut
[13:21] that child that mother is connected like
[13:23] a church and an individual in a church
[13:26] sometimes there's connection but that
[13:27] when once that birth comes right when
[13:29] you call the churches you justified you
[13:32] get baptized you can sink right but when
[13:34] that birth comes it cuts the cord now
[13:39] it's no load that child is an individual
[13:41] that child amen follow the leadership of
[13:43] the Holy Spirit all right and we look at
[13:46] this you see all brother books I'm gonna
[13:48] tell you we are in the womb of the earth
[13:50] right now we are now being veiled we
[13:54] can't see what that product that's being
[13:56] form them in us will be like we have no
[14:00] idea how it is but surely amen we can
[14:02] see by God's grace that the light that's
[14:05] being formed in us is a new life that's
[14:08] how you know you got the Holy Ghost when
[14:10] you see that a new life is coming the oh
[14:13] you are now is vanishing away right and
[14:17] what does the Holy Ghost come it is to
[14:20] finalize the product it is to burn all
[14:23] of the world out of you it is a burn
[14:26] every evil desire it is a burn is like
[14:28] to like like the earth when it begins
[14:30] when it yells into his new birth is that
[14:32] right future home the private God said
[14:35] the earth will have a fire baptism he
[14:39] said you think that when a true son and
[14:41] daughter of God make a lot a lot of
[14:43] noise when they get it he said you ought
[14:45] to hear the noise when the earth get
[14:47] here and we're looking by the grace of
[14:49] God amen for that birth we looking amen
[14:53] I can't imagine when the product is
[14:55] finished and the Holy Ghost comes and
[14:58] elevates us from this old natural flesh
[15:00] into a glorified body we have no idea
[15:04] what we're looking into a Mayan
[15:08] Hollywood can't even produce a movie
[15:11] that will be able to compare with the
[15:13] reality of these sons and daughters
[15:16] coming to his perfect state hallelujah
[15:20] we'll be able to walk through walls
[15:22] we'll be able to travel like a thought
[15:24] hallelujah you and I will be the very
[15:27] light of the earth hallelujah
[15:30] hey man we'll be more like Paul said
[15:34] more than conquerors we we we we can see
[15:39] the benefits of being new I'm so glad
[15:43] that God didn't decide to make me a dog
[15:45] or cat or cow I really appreciate being
[15:48] a man I love man things I like this
[15:52] position that I have but that wasn't the
[15:55] greatest position that God has given me
[15:57] he's now given you and I positions that
[16:00] are called sons and daughters of God we
[16:02] are kings we are priests hallelujah we
[16:06] are eternal
[16:07] that ought to make every man happy to
[16:11] know that you cannot die that when I
[16:13] close my eyes and my breath and then
[16:16] leaves me it just doesn't vanish into
[16:18] the air but there's a body wake know me
[16:21] just like there's a body weight a spirit
[16:23] waiting on my body there's a body
[16:25] waiting on my spirit oh go to God that
[16:30] ought to make every man excited to know
[16:33] Amen that even though the bomb will drop
[16:35] the Prophet God said before one bomb
[16:37] drop we are gone you don't want to be
[16:39] here when the bomb drop you don't want
[16:42] to get hit be here when the Russian get
[16:43] drunk enough to push the button

[16:48] everything that's on the stage we see
[16:50] the stage lead out amen Israel's in a
[16:53] homeland the flag is flying all of the
[16:56] nations hate Israel hey man we see Trump

[17:04] you like it or not
[17:05] Trump is sounding a trumpet his voice is
[17:08] causing Wars spiritual
[17:12] around war natural Rams war political
[17:17] RAM Wars and that's the truth I mean now
[17:21] we're living in a time a men that is
[17:23] talking about the nuclear armory that
[17:25] every country has and who's gonna blow
[17:27] each other up first you see men grow me
[17:31] trying to say who's got the biggest bomb
[17:35] like children but you must understand it
[17:39] is the anointing of the aged and as they
[17:42] feud and fuss Amen God has now put us in
[17:46] a place where he is elevating us amen to
[17:50] look and to act like sons and daughters
[17:53] of God we know that the world will not
[17:58] be destroyed by water anymore
[18:01] hallelujah it's going to get his baptism
[18:04] we know by God's grace God destroyed the
[18:07] water he baptized your earth with water
[18:09] in those day that's why I want people to
[18:12] know God don't sprinkle he submerged you
[18:15] hallelujah because God submerged the
[18:18] earth in water it died and it had a
[18:20] resurrection hallelujah
[18:23] is that the truth every living creature
[18:26] on earth died and then God resurrected
[18:31] it hallelujah the only thing that se was
[18:34] saying was those that were in the ark I
[18:37] love that it meant because one of these
[18:39] old days because we are in the Ark of
[18:41] God and then when the fires fall and
[18:43] burned the whole world up the Bible said
[18:45] we will return like Noah returned on his
[18:48] ark we're returning our hallelujah and
[18:51] the Bible said we'll walk on the ashes
[18:54] of wicked hallelujah I am so grateful
[18:59] that my God has given us a way that we
[19:02] can be changed transformed and
[19:04] translated you see I like the way that
[19:07] sound I'm gonna be honest with you I
[19:09] really like the way that sound because I
[19:11] see the process of God and three is a
[19:13] perfection amen oh my is that right
[19:18] their Bible tells us that don't worry
[19:20] there'll be those who go to sleep before
[19:22] we will air man but guess what they have
[19:24] the privilege of
[19:25] housing first hallelujah the dead in
[19:28] Christ shall rise first and those of us
[19:31] who remain will be quickened and changed
[19:34] and will be caught up to meet him it's a
[19:45] beautiful situation and if the people
[19:48] knew that's why Satan has blinded the
[19:50] mind
[19:51] this is Satan even how how many I
[19:53] believe that do you know Satan is the
[19:55] god of this world every politician is
[19:58] anointed by Satan that's why you can't
[20:03] have a good one
[20:04] everybody up there's from the bad boys
[20:11] it is you you know the day of a
[20:14] righteous man in in politician in the
[20:17] political realm is over never happen
[20:22] again
[20:22] they don't want that kind if they raise
[20:26] up Washington and Abraham Lincoln let
[20:29] the prophet of God and put them all over
[20:30] the world
[20:30] a man will never change the minds of the
[20:33] people by that day is over we are now
[20:37] living in a time where there is a
[20:40] multiplication of the Serpent's huh is
[20:46] that right
[20:47] what Adam was supposed to do he didn't
[20:50] do it
[20:51] but Satan multiply and he has filled his
[20:55] eden with his kind that's why we don't
[21:00] fit that's why we are different
[21:03] that's why amen that we are treated the
[21:06] way we treated because we are not
[21:09] ourselves either we are from another
[21:13] world
[21:14] hallelujah and you and I must understand
[21:18] Amen that we are sojourn as we are
[21:20] pilgrim we are strangers and we're
[21:23] traveling through this world hallelujah
[21:26] oh come on somebody if that you've heard
[21:29] me say if there be any aliens it is to
[21:32] Christians hallelujah because we came
[21:35] from a different dimension hallelujah
[21:38] and we go
[21:39] back to that dimension hallelujah that's
[21:44] why you know we we don't we don't worry
[21:47] you know we're we're not that kind that
[21:50] that's gonna just worry oh I don't have
[21:51] my masters and I don't have my uh a
[21:54] doctrine because let me tell you
[21:56] something once Paul met Jesus he's
[22:00] everything I have gained in this world
[22:02] I'm liking it underdog
[22:05] hallelujah he said I have one purpose
[22:08] now and that is to know Jesus Christ and
[22:11] him crucified hallelujah Paul realized
[22:14] he meant that all this world and
[22:16] everything that it's Oh devil as extreme
[22:20] as being glorious will fade away and the
[22:23] only thing that's gonna ever stand is
[22:25] the Word of God
[22:26] you see that's why God couldn't make us
[22:29] no other way God had to make us a part
[22:33] of him we had to come into this world as
[22:35] part of the word in other words you
[22:39] understand me you had to be born by the
[22:41] word because everything else is going to
[22:44] pass away but the word of the Lord shall
[22:47] stand there's a part of you that will
[22:50] never fade away you saw what do you mean
[22:53] brother Brooks because see you and I was
[22:55] eternal we didn't know it but every one
[22:59] of us somehow even as she was a child
[23:01] you since that that you was different
[23:04] somehow the devil made you know you was
[23:07] different and all that even though when
[23:11] you didn't know God you had a respect
[23:14] for him something like I was telling
[23:18] somebody the other day there was a lady
[23:19] in my neighborhood and evidently she had
[23:22] been a Christian I believe in law but
[23:24] ever times he getting wrong you hear
[23:28] that lady saying and sounded like she
[23:30] was on the heavens quiet and she was
[23:34] always worshiping the Lord even when she
[23:36] was drunk well you say well I lately
[23:40] probably lost I don't believe that
[23:41] because they said when you're drunk
[23:43] that's when you're real you show up see
[23:50] when I was in the world.we program where
[23:51] she drunk you know she lost no that's
[23:54] nonsense if that person have made a
[24:00] promise and they have United with Christ
[24:03] and they have confess along with their
[24:05] heart and their mouth she everybody do
[24:07] that ain't safe because everybody is not
[24:09] God's children but the Bible said I will
[24:13] never lose one hallelujah now we may
[24:19] lose some of the benefits of being a son
[24:23] or daughter but you can never lose your
[24:27] position as being a son and a daughter
[24:33] that's why the prophet of God said
[24:35] there'll be many of there that you
[24:37] thought wasn't gonna make it
[24:41] David said don't let me fall in the
[24:43] hands of man let me fall in the hands of
[24:46] God man don't know how to have mercy
[24:49] don't know how to have grace upon each
[24:51] other but God knows how to do it and to
[24:55] me is amazing grace it's still amazing
[24:58] so you look at these things aware this
[25:00] is what I love about the message it's it
[25:03] assures me folks it makes me know that I
[25:06] am worth something especially to God
[25:10] hallelujah
[25:11] so much so he say I'll never leave you
[25:13] nor will I forsake you
[25:15] right see we don't have to worry about
[25:17] all these things because we realized
[25:19] that Paul said it's nothing except no
[25:21] value it cannot buy me a ticket into
[25:24] heaven
[25:24] it came buy me a seat hallelujah and I'm
[25:29] not concerned about a seat or a chair
[25:31] because mine's already there
[25:34] hallelujah it's just there wait no me is
[25:37] that right that's what the property of
[25:39] God said basically brother man where's
[25:41] your hairs I'd never lose lost one of
[25:43] them are they but they right there where
[25:47] they was before I got him the mothership
[25:51] listen about said the works had been
[25:53] finished before the foundation of the
[25:57] world so what is he saying he is saying
[26:00] that it's already done but we must
[26:03] get out cuz we are in time but in the
[26:07] mind of God is finished you're standing
[26:10] perfect justified before him not
[26:13] tomorrow now and when he says that
[26:16] listen the sons of God how we behold the
[26:19] face of him that's our word body we're
[26:23] now standing in heavenly places
[26:25] beholding the face of God and yet is
[26:27] still we're not even there yet but it's
[26:32] these elements is this world that has
[26:33] veiled us that we can't see in that
[26:35] dimension but I believe before the flood
[26:39] before the fall Adam and Eve could
[26:41] actually see they could hear God and
[26:45] when the angel saying I believe it was a
[26:47] wake-up call hallelujah the angel
[26:50] started began to sing and they won't
[26:52] roll over like all in that heavenly
[26:55] hallelujah because at that time heaven
[26:58] and earth was going is that right
[27:03] hey the ground that I hadn't walk on was
[27:06] holy ground he said how can you say that
[27:09] because there was no sin that same tree
[27:13] of life walked in the cool of the day it
[27:18] was sin that broke brought the breach
[27:20] between heaven and earth but it was just
[27:27] in the same locale pretty much and you
[27:31] said well what do you mean brother
[27:32] bridge that's why people don't
[27:34] understand the probably God said there
[27:35] are dimensions he said television ways
[27:38] and everything right through this place
[27:40] amen and even scientists say they can
[27:43] now they have issuance where they can
[27:44] actually pick up the voice of Jesus so
[27:49] you know we are looking at a place where
[27:51] it never dies and the only thing that
[27:55] would stop the echo the only thing that
[27:57] was stopping is the blood of Jesus you
[27:59] understand me
[28:00] so will you say Lord I want to be
[28:03] translated the Bible said he not walk
[28:06] with God and he was found not hallelujah
[28:10] and we think Oh some astronaut came down
[28:14] and took him some alien from another
[28:15] planet I don't know
[28:17] people thinking about but because they
[28:19] can't figure out they've draw up these
[28:20] crazy things in their mind hallelujah
[28:24] but the world was created by God the
[28:27] dinosaurs were created by God however
[28:31] they look I don't care why do I have to
[28:35] care about what the dinosaurs look like
[28:41] like I said the other day wherever I was
[28:44] I was preaching not really article and
[28:46] was tough these people these black
[28:48] people and I forgot exactly where they
[28:50] were I think some from Australia
[28:52] Aborigines and summer for other places
[28:53] their dark black with kinky hair some
[28:57] with blue eyes some with green eyes and
[28:59] just this strange looking for beautiful
[29:01] people beautiful people and they said
[29:04] somewhere down the line because these
[29:06] people have a different bloodline I'm
[29:09] like what are you talking about you know
[29:12] what they said that somehow man came and
[29:16] greed with the Neanderthal God can make
[29:22] a flower any color he wants to I
[29:26] [Music]
[29:27] remember when I saw a black man black
[29:30] it's me darker than me far dark black
[29:33] like Indian he may have been with baby
[29:36] blue eyes I was a boy guess what I did I
[29:41] stared just like y'all would have cuz it
[29:47] was my first time ever seeing that
[29:49] before you know what I'm saying and you
[29:53] and I look at these things use and what
[29:54] brother why are you saying these things

[30:22] you but better
[30:24] somebody say can I look better but yes
[30:28] yes they're gonna be a better
[30:30] you think about a people God didn't
[30:35] purpose somebody in one to be bigger
[30:36] than the other Satan did that kind of
[30:39] stuff you know and you know God is going
[30:42] to fix it I've seen and if what I seen
[30:46] by way of dream is his reality there is
[30:52] no way to describe you because the faces
[30:56] that I've seen geometrically was perfect
[30:59] perfect and you know I look at these
[31:03] things I say wow you know but the
[31:06] beautiful thing about it is it really
[31:09] won't matter how you look because
[31:10] everybody gonna love you there anyhow
[31:14] ain't nobody gonna be looking in the
[31:16] mirror said oh brother rich I'm looking
[31:18] pretty good today it ain't gonna be that
[31:21] let me move on folks I'm getting it off
[31:24] a little bit
[31:25] listen the word translated means to
[31:27] change the form condition nature
[31:31] hallelujah and that's what God is doing
[31:34] now spirit translated means to change
[31:36] the form condition or nature and God is
[31:40] doing what changing our nature there's
[31:43] Adamic nature into the nature of God
[31:47] hallelujah
[31:48] hey little by little right it took nine
[31:52] monster to grow you in the womb there's
[31:56] a time amen when you first was conceived
[31:58] you like a little tadpole or some kind
[32:00] of little fishy thing then from there
[32:03] Amen if you look in that you know you
[32:05] see the stages are like a little dragon
[32:07] or something right I say fishy thing
[32:12] because really it looks like a serpent
[32:14] of course with a cobra head but by God's
[32:18] grace he changed us hallelujah and the
[32:22] devil gives us the Serpent's flesh
[32:24] y'all notice the Serpent's flesh huh
[32:29] because the sinful flesh that's why you
[32:32] have so much trouble with this flesh
[32:34] that's why this flesh cannot be tamed
[32:37] you must kill him Paul said I die daily
[32:43] so
[32:44] you and I must understand let me move on
[32:46] we want the change we want the
[32:48] transformation we want to be converted
[32:50] we really want all the deeds of the
[32:52] flesh to be dead and only the holy ghost
[32:56] can do it only the Holy Ghost I don't
[33:02] care amen i'ma tell you something
[33:05] the Bible says wherever there's law
[33:07] seeing about you see these people
[33:10] Amen over in these foreign countries
[33:12] with everything covered you know and I
[33:14] think to myself I said here I've seen
[33:16] women covered all up here and all except
[33:19] their eye oh my god this should cover
[33:23] the eyes is that right because there is
[33:27] the Gateway you can't lust after
[33:32] something you don't you don't see and to
[33:35] be honest with you all that clothes
[33:37] don't stop people from imaginations you
[33:42] understand me
[33:44] and one of my son says yeah you see him
[33:47] walking like that it says a spooky thing
[33:48] the one who's been out overseas he said
[33:50] but then when you go to their house they
[33:52] got all the Western clothes those one
[33:55] those same Muslim take off all that
[33:57] stuff put on their hind your shoes and
[33:59] they short dresses why because their
[34:02] husbands they call them Devils but they
[34:05] want to drive they want to make them
[34:07] dress like a devil in the house and look
[34:09] like a saint
[34:10] outside we must be sanctified you can't
[34:19] even get the Holy Ghost without it
[34:24] that's the stage that's how God takes it
[34:27] justification sanctification baptism of
[34:30] the Holy Ghost but your sanctification
[34:32] is not you it's not what you call
[34:36] sanctified hello
[34:39] you ever seen sanctified dirt
[34:46] hallelujah but you know what God said to
[34:48] Moses take off your shoes I love the
[34:51] head but the ground that you stand out
[34:53] is holy ground dirt that God made holy
[35:01] that's all I'm saying
[35:03] I'm dirt but God made this dirt holy
[35:07] wherever God is it becomes holy a holy
[35:10] Lord I wish you can see it the way I see
[35:13] he-hey
[35:14] but God is the one that sanctified it
[35:16] look what Jesus did his blood dropped on
[35:19] the earth and the earth became
[35:21] sanctified so you say well what do you
[35:23] mean brother ones because of the blood
[35:25] of Jesus my body that caves from the
[35:27] earth amen must claim in sanctification
[35:30] by and through the blood of Jesus that's
[35:34] how we get sanctified by faith I'm
[35:37] sanctified when I claim that faith and
[35:41] when I claim that sanctify
[35:42] sanctification Amen being God began to
[35:45] cleanse me make me sanctified because I
[35:48] confess sanctification somebody help me
[35:52] here you and I like I said what about
[35:55] h2o it cannot change h2o
[36:00] one part hard hydrogen to power oxygen
[36:04] guess what it equals
[36:06] whoa and let me tell you now if you use
[36:12] hu all every time put those two
[36:15] chemicals together it will never vary it
[36:17] will never change because that's the law
[36:20] of science it will always come up to be
[36:23] water that's how the world of God is you
[36:28] put faith and a mountain together every
[36:33] time faith is applied to the mountain
[36:35] the mountain must move that's an
[36:38] equation you say yes it is because Jesus
[36:42] said if you say to this mountain be thou
[36:44] moved the mountain must move it's an
[36:48] equation took by Pontius
[36:51] if faith will move a mountain and remove
[36:54] everything else
[36:56] put faith plus whatever it has to equal
[37:00] victory that's the equation it cannot
[37:05] change
[37:06] by faith Abraham moved look at the
[37:14] scripture accordingly Hebrews 11
[37:16] everything was done by faith because we
[37:19] who are believers we have a faith
[37:21] civilization we have a ram that we live
[37:25] and operate in that the world cannot see
[37:27] they laugh at us right Jesus said get
[37:32] out of the house the dog the dog the
[37:34] dancers sleep
[37:35] they laugh to the death well because in
[37:37] there Ram was dead in Jesus Ram
[37:41] she's asleep he said Tabitha come for
[37:48] guess what Kepler didn't have the faith
[37:50] to call her he had to faith but she died
[37:53] in faith so faith connect with faith and
[37:56] they got up you and I must understand
[38:02] Amen whenever God tells you to do
[38:03] something it's going to be done right
[38:06] brother man said when I saw those
[38:08] visions when God showed me something
[38:10] he said I'd never worried about it he
[38:13] said because everything he ever showed
[38:14] me came to pass hallelujah if God by
[38:18] inspiration tells you something I don't
[38:21] care if the whole world don't see it
[38:23] can't see it you need to have faith and
[38:25] said how do you know it's going to
[38:27] happen like Noah said God said stone
[38:32] hallelujah
[38:33] I look at all of my older and I always
[38:35] say y'all hear me say I say sometimes he
[38:38] look like sometimes they get him an
[38:39] impossible places the answer but I
[38:42] remember the day when I was on my knees
[38:43] in church I didn't ask God God came to
[38:46] me and he told me he was gonna save
[38:47] every one of my children hallelujah how
[38:50] can I doubt him as that song said when I
[38:54] know too much about it I don't care what
[38:57] it looks like I don't know how he's
[38:59] gonna do it but he told me so and I owe
[39:03] fast to him y'all hear me and I look at
[39:07] that thing and I said hey look at
[39:09] Oh joke knew his children without their
[39:11] partying can old amen job didn't worry
[39:14] he said I'm going to do what God told me
[39:16] to do i'ma lay that blood on the altar
[39:18] hallelujah I'm gonna pray for them
[39:21] because I know the prayer of a righteous
[39:23] man availeth much
[39:25] hallelujah whatever God's told me to do
[39:27] I'm gonna do it because the equation
[39:29] must come out the same hallelujah that's
[39:34] why the promise said if there be
[39:35] somebody with the same kind of condition
[39:37] meaning the same kind of faith God has
[39:40] to do the same thing always always
[39:44] hallelujah but without faith it's
[39:46] impossible to please him but he that
[39:48] cometh to God must believe that he is
[39:50] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[39:53] diligently kill you got to believe and
[39:56] you got to know that God is God
[39:59] hallelujah God is God he's not a second
[40:06] God he's not a third God He is God y'all
[40:12] know who God is God is the creator of
[40:15] all things he's omnipotent
[40:19] he's our mission PC / dyra he's your
[40:23] home Arafah hallelujah he's your holy SH
[40:27] alone he's all these things there is no
[40:30] other name given a minute among men
[40:32] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[40:35] Jesus and that's the name of Jesus
[40:37] Christ every knee shall bow
[40:38] he's the only potentate he's the only
[40:41] authority Satan has no authority Satan
[40:45] has no power what he did have was taken
[40:48] from him now the squatter has been
[40:50] exposed hallelujah if somebody is on
[40:56] your land he's a squatter right now you
[40:58] can kick him off your land because you
[41:01] realize Amen the title deed was in your
[41:03] name all along hallelujah Amen that's
[41:06] how God has given the times right but
[41:09] you've got to be changed you got to get
[41:10] to a place where your thoughts are
[41:12] spiritual like I was telling the people
[41:13] the other day you got to stop and I say
[41:15] that all the time even for me sometimes
[41:18] we think like men sometimes we think
[41:20] like children when we ought to be
[41:22] thinking like
[41:23] I let this mind be in you how do I think
[41:30] like God first of all you think like and
[41:32] when you acknowledge him when you
[41:37] acknowledge him then he'll tell you the
[41:39] direction to go in and when he tells you
[41:42] the direction to go in then you thinking
[41:43] like him don't you say Lord not my will
[41:46] but thine be done
[41:47] hallelujah listen what James said James
[41:55] says for as the body without the Spirit
[41:58] is dead so faith without works is dead
[42:01] also oh I got faith and there are no
[42:04] works there's no evidence that faith
[42:08] does that work he said don't be dead
[42:10] don't do that don't do that it's like a
[42:12] body without that's what I'm saying when
[42:14] I come up a hit and there is no spirit
[42:16] that if he's dead we need Holy Ghost in
[42:21] here we need God in here and then we
[42:23] need the spirit because without him here
[42:25] we're dead I don't care what you think
[42:28] we're there and you know when something
[42:33] is dead you can't get him to move the
[42:36] only thing a dead body can do is blow up
[42:38] at you oh my god but when the spirit of
[42:46] life is in there oh it moves it jabs he
[42:49] shouts hallelujah I looked at little
[42:53] story the Prophet God told and he's told
[42:55] tells that story about how that skinny
[42:58] calf and the fat calf a man was out
[43:00] there in the yard and in that little ah
[43:02] us giddy calf looked at the fat calf
[43:05] because he was bucking and kicking
[43:07] everything he did
[43:08] but natus ISM but let the people call
[43:12] you phonetic when you got the joy of the
[43:15] Lord in here I don't care this with one
[43:17] person jumping and shouting and praising
[43:20] I know that ain't all it but when you
[43:21] know that you've got the victory and we
[43:26] must know we have the victory
[43:28] oh we lose some battles people we fight
[43:30] and we fight and sometimes we fall but
[43:32] the justice that just to get up seven
[43:34] times in a day we go through those
[43:36] changes that
[43:37] time but I'm talking about the end of
[43:39] your faith you got the victory and
[43:41] that's what the Bible said we ought to
[43:43] receive the end of our faith forget
[43:47] about this in between is that the year
[43:51] that's why I said when God in this last
[43:54] day he didn't start from the beginning
[43:56] he started right at the end at the
[43:58] opening of the seals he started to tell
[43:59] us exactly what's going to happen what
[44:01] happened and he tells us all the
[44:03] victories throughout the church ages you
[44:05] know he tells us amen how they got the
[44:07] victory he tells us how he always stood
[44:10] in the midst of the golden calendar
[44:11] sticks
[44:12] and then brother Brandon said it wasn't
[44:13] a he was a she huh that means the bride
[44:20] got victory in every church age by what
[44:24] the power of her husband ha and the
[44:30] devil is upset he don't want us to come
[44:32] to maturity because once we come into a
[44:35] full maturity he knows his finish
[44:40] because the Bible said your next move is
[44:43] a thousand years of bondage and after
[44:46] that thousand years of bondage devil you
[44:49] thrown into the lake of fire to my boobs
[44:54] and while he's in his chains
[44:59] we're walking upon the earth and we're
[45:03] judging the nations and we're ruling
[45:06] with the rod of iron hallelujah
[45:08] not even a crack of sin would be able to
[45:11] escape us
[45:12] oh come on somebody ah ain't God good to
[45:16] us I'm trying to finish up like I said
[45:20] God bring his children to the impossible
[45:23] to face the impossible to change the
[45:26] impossible to the possible then then to
[45:31] them ought to all those things he make
[45:33] it happens we are the last days and we
[45:38] are come to a place where this is an
[45:40] impossible age it's impossible to live
[45:44] holy is impossible to live sanctified
[45:46] it's impossible to have a peace of mind
[45:49] every
[45:51] think it's impossible everything that
[45:52] God demands of us is impossible but God
[45:56] made provision for us to have the
[45:58] possible is that right
[46:00] and that's when Jesus said all things
[46:02] are possible
[46:04] turn them that believe hallelujah and we
[46:10] are those who believe we know by God's
[46:15] grace a man it shall always come to pass
[46:19] but as the new heavens and the new earth
[46:21] which I will make sure remain before me
[46:24] say at the Lord so shall your seed and
[46:26] your name remain
[46:29] let's say it again for as the new
[46:32] heavens and the new earth which I will
[46:35] make shall remain before me saith the
[46:38] Lord so shall your seed and your name
[46:41] remain your seed and your name remain it
[46:47] shall come to pass that from one new
[46:50] moon to another and from one Sabbath to
[46:53] another shall all flesh come to worship
[46:54] before me saith the Lord
[46:57] he ain't God good what do we now am our
[47:01] clothes in just a minute we are now
[47:02] coming we are now what did the seals do
[47:05] for you ooh
[47:06] first of all brother Adam said it was a
[47:08] sound of the Jubilee God said I don't
[47:12] care what slave market you've been in
[47:14] and what kind of change
[47:16] ohyeah your true sons and daughters of
[47:19] God you are free but in that freedom
[47:24] what the God say it's up to you
[47:26] I have blown the trumpet
[47:29] I have sounded it now you can go free
[47:34] and what did God do he left that freedom
[47:38] up to the slave right he can either go
[47:41] free or he can remain with this that is
[47:45] the slave master hallelujah but the
[47:49] Bible tells us that if he remained with
[47:51] the slave master then they would do what
[47:53] for his ear with an awl and that would
[47:57] be a sign that he could never go free
[47:59] again hmm
[48:01] that means that he'll never be able to
[48:03] hear the gospel
[48:04] again he can hear it but he wouldn't be
[48:07] able to receive and he won't be able to
[48:09] take it into his heart because once you
[48:11] refuse your freedom Satan has a right
[48:17] hello and I know some of y'all know your
[48:20] history even when slaves were free all
[48:23] slaves did not leave their masters why
[48:27] because some of the slaves if they had
[48:31] good masters their masters took care of
[48:34] them all of them were mean and vicious
[48:37] you understand me then there were those
[48:40] Amen who didn't see how they could make
[48:42] it because they couldn't read they
[48:44] couldn't write I'm gonna make it out
[48:45] there on my own at least at the Masters
[48:48] house I'm being fair you know they had
[48:51] these reasonings wouldn't get themself a
[48:54] chance
[48:56] they wouldn't venture out into the new
[48:59] world
[49:00] you understand me and this is not
[49:03] picking on anybody I'm just saying I'm
[49:05] working this thing only just to bring a
[49:07] spiritual application all of that was
[49:09] done so that we can see that you have a
[49:11] right to go free I don't care what your
[49:14] bondage is you can go free
[49:17] God is right there to make you free the
[49:21] Spirit of the Lord is freedom he whom
[49:23] the Sun sets free is free indeed so we
[49:27] must understand we come to claim my
[49:29] inheritance hallelujah
[49:32] I love it Jesus went into the field and
[49:34] they start eating corn and everything in
[49:36] somebody else's field hallelujah
[49:40] but Jesus leave that's mine you better
[49:47] believe it led by the spirit on that one
[49:48] now you know to say but my point is he
[49:52] was a lord of all things and he knew it
[49:54] was here and they had a law that you can
[49:58] go into that field and eat but just just
[50:01] just don't take a bag with you to carry
[50:03] nothing out
[50:05] so he was right in the heel of the Lord
[50:09] hey man you know that that used to be a
[50:12] law that if you was in the or you can
[50:15] eat it in there but if you take it out
[50:17] you caught stealing
[50:21] there been times I've seen a lot of
[50:23] empty wrappers in stores because there
[50:26] was a time if you Lowe's you there
[50:28] eating it they couldn't but once you
[50:30] took that bag out that's stealing I know
[50:34] it's not like that now
[50:35] it used to be like this in South
[50:38] Carolina if he was caught speeding on a
[50:40] Sunday and you was going to church they
[50:45] could not issue you a ticket
[50:48] that's how South Carolina used to honor
[50:52] the word don't try it now because almost
[50:56] all the blue laws are done away with
[50:59] right and y'all remember I noticed
[51:02] brother stamps I know y'all remember
[51:04] when when when stores would close early
[51:06] on Saturdays I remember down south I'm
[51:12] from the southern belle six o'clock on
[51:14] Saturday evenings all stores except the
[51:18] medication store like drugstores they
[51:20] stayed open there was no more selling
[51:24] booze or liquor after 6:00 everything
[51:28] that's the way this country used to fear
[51:30] God but they did away with the blue law
[51:33] you couldn't even have a club open on a
[51:35] Sunday but they are seven days a week
[51:39] see what I'm saying but they used to
[51:41] fear God but no longer let me move on we
[51:44] are come where we come to a time that
[51:48] you and I must understand that Abraham a
[51:51] lot we look at the situation I see our
[51:53] inheritance lot was Abraham's
[51:56] inheritance and though lot went wrong
[51:59] Abraham loved him and though lot went
[52:02] wrong
[52:03] Abraham fought for him right and you and
[52:07] I must understand we must fight but how
[52:11] do we fight you fight on your knees
[52:15] hallelujah I remember my old mama I
[52:17] remember my wife I can understand why
[52:20] she was on her knees she was crying out
[52:22] for me look where her prayers have
[52:26] brought me you may not see your prayers
[52:29] answered in death time
[52:31] but in the next to come it'll be your
[52:34] prayer that got your loved ones through
[52:37] when you think they're not paying you
[52:39] attention they know you're right but
[52:41] oftentimes they got demons binding them
[52:44] at the end of the day brother I don't
[52:46] say many of them are make it through
[52:48] because of your testimony oh fast your
[52:51] testimony keep praying foam doesn't
[52:54] matter how how they treat you you got to
[52:57] love your enemies anyway
[53:00] hallelujah the truth of the matter is
[53:02] whatever you do you give up on nobody
[53:04] you never give up because God don't give
[53:08] up on us
[53:11] do you labor yes you labor but
[53:14] understand we are to the faith
[53:17] civilization I keep saying it
[53:19] you are civilization of faith a man you
[53:23] are people who faith who operates by
[53:25] faith we call those things that
[53:27] gaybraham did though as though they as
[53:29] there they were even though they be not
[53:31] we look at the unseen it says I know my
[53:34] god is able hallelujah you understand me
[53:38] scientific civilization we we have he
[53:40] said exactly Satan's trap he said all
[53:43] the scientific stuff our traps developed
[53:48] by Satan to do what entrap you we spend
[53:53] more time on the only these computers
[53:56] and these little gadgets amen more time
[53:58] than with them that on our knees it's a
[54:00] trap it's a trap is something to
[54:05] distract you I'm not saying something
[54:07] wrong but you must understand every
[54:09] development in this world the scientific
[54:11] world is good and evil that was the tree
[54:15] they ate off that's the tree we in this
[54:19] world y'all won't you all right with
[54:22] that listen the coming judgement so we
[54:26] can understand this world this world is
[54:29] it will be judged and and you and I must
[54:32] it is judged we know that it's been
[54:34] found in the balance has been had been
[54:36] weighed in the balance found launched in
[54:38] 1960 v 56 50 70 men when America had an
[54:43] opportunity to repent they wouldn't
[54:45] and now by God's grace you see what has
[54:47] happened to America nobody would have if
[54:49] those people in that day would not have
[54:51] I have dreamed of what this day would
[54:54] look like and in that great day that
[55:01] we're living in a great civilization
[55:02] fixing to be blasted from the earth hmm
[55:06] you say well as it was in the days of
[55:09] Noah so will it be only this time
[55:12] instead of water it'll be fire the world
[55:14] will rock by atomic power you know what
[55:19] listen and what it is you see these
[55:21] countries now saying oh but we can shut
[55:23] down American greed you know what I
[55:26] believe that they've develop equipment
[55:30] right that they can shut it down and if
[55:33] they shut us down
[55:34] what is our defense because everything
[55:36] is electronic I don't care how many
[55:39] bombs you got if you don't have no power
[55:41] to send it off you're done and I look at
[55:45] things that said I don't know how it's
[55:47] going to turn I do know Russia will send
[55:49] a bomb here and to the Vatican I'm I
[55:52] thought about this I said you know these
[55:54] people up there or I'll bomb you and
[55:56] I'll bomb you and I'll bomb you and I
[55:57] think this is what I'm thinking somebody
[55:58] willing to bomb somebody and then rush
[56:00] you're gonna get upsetting on a bomber
[56:01] but I won't be here
[56:03] I just hope y'all in the heart all right
[56:06] because amen I'm planning to be
[56:09] translated right the BART the world will
[56:14] rock by atomic power all God made men
[56:18] and women everywhere realize the
[56:20] seriousness of this visitation of God
[56:23] that's what I'm saying and that's where
[56:25] I say it this morning if we could really
[56:28] realize the visitation of Malachi for
[56:30] revelation 10 7 if we could see the
[56:33] Prophet why God had to sin it because
[56:35] before every destruction God sins a
[56:39] problem and what's so wonderful about us
[56:42] here we are Gentiles and when the
[56:44] prophet of God came on the earth he was
[56:46] the first Gentile prophet that we knew
[56:48] of Balaam may have been one but my point
[56:53] is this he didn't come to in the world
[56:55] and the Bible said amen in Malachi 4
[56:59] amen three four now we realize him n
[57:02] that this this this prophet that God was
[57:04] the sin in this day was coming just
[57:06] before the fire hmm and he tells us at
[57:12] the time about his event there at
[57:14] Yellowstone and how that glacier came up
[57:17] and the fire went everywhere and he said
[57:19] oh let the fire fall and nobody catches
[57:24] me but a word of a prophet came out word
[57:28] of his out of his mouth let the fire
[57:30] fall do you think he was just saying it
[57:35] it's a parable the bride catches it the
[57:42] word of the Lord comes through the mouth
[57:43] of a prophet and it cannot come back boy
[57:47] he said California was going to say it's
[57:51] gonna say Mexico just look at the look
[57:55] at the earthquakes now they're closer
[57:56] now that California and they ever been I
[58:00] was listening to hit escape here that
[58:02] quickly come come up hither you know
[58:04] what he said he said even the scientists
[58:07] did not pick up the earthquake that was
[58:10] to hit India but the animal did could it
[58:14] be I'm not saying it is that this earth
[58:17] take quake that's going hit California
[58:18] because they got all of their machine
[58:21] will be one that they won't be able to
[58:23] pick up do you really think the
[58:28] newscasters in Noah's day picked up the
[58:30] storm that was three they had no idea
[58:36] everybody watching over this one this
[58:39] one and that little boy in that dream in
[58:41] 1933 I think it was say it started off
[58:44] so saw so like that people was making
[58:48] fun of that little shaking began to rock
[58:55] everything see what people don't
[58:58] understand once everything is set up and
[59:01] all of the big ones done came all the
[59:03] tickets just a little noise
[59:10] what do you think I'm closing
[59:20] every moment almost with you coming from
[59:24] Colossians first chapter but let me say
[59:27] this
[59:29] God has sent his angel of mercy is up to
[59:39] but this cause we also since the day we
[59:42] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[59:44] and to desire that he might be filled
[59:48] with the knowledge of his will in all
[59:51] wisdom and spiritual understanding that
[59:54] G might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[59:56] pleasing being fruitful in every good
[59:59] work increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:00:03] strengthened with all might according to
[1:00:06] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:00:09] long-suffering with joy Paul yeah y'all
[1:00:13] think God right in this world out here
[1:00:14] for us not to pay attention to it you
[1:00:18] see at some point we must begin to
[1:00:22] literally see what Satan is doing and
[1:00:25] enjoy I have a joy about it I wasn't
[1:00:32] there with Peter but I'm sure there was
[1:00:35] a certain amount of joy Peter had
[1:00:37] knowing this was just in that his work
[1:00:41] on earth is spinning oh you say Oh Paul
[1:00:45] Paul was go Lord no no no I really
[1:00:49] believe the joy Paul had a joy when he
[1:00:51] was going to Nero's choppers Bob but you
[1:00:54] know what Paul could have gotten out of
[1:00:56] it but Paul pushed the issue I want to
[1:01:01] see Caesar there was a certain amount of
[1:01:04] joy that he had Oh was he jumping out
[1:01:08] but I know there was a joy in his heart
[1:01:09] to know like bother Bosworth that's what
[1:01:14] I'm here for I worked all these years
[1:01:16] preaching this gospel and just in a
[1:01:18] moment's time I'm gonna see the one that
[1:01:21] I've been preaching about that's what
[1:01:23] all I'm saying
[1:01:29] straighten with all might according to
[1:01:32] his glorious power that's where our
[1:01:34] strength comes from is that word Jesus
[1:01:39] went to the cross and the bow said
[1:01:41] because of the joy that was set before
[1:01:43] him he might have whooped him but they
[1:01:50] couldn't take over his joy they might
[1:01:52] have beat him and he might have made him
[1:01:54] feel like nothing but inside or the
[1:01:57] inside you know all brother was you said
[1:02:00] but he was God don't say God pulled
[1:02:03] himself away from him he went the
[1:02:05] Calvary as a main he didn't go as a God
[1:02:09] he went as a man that's why he said on
[1:02:13] that cross father why hast thou forsaken
[1:02:19] can you imagine
[1:02:21] never being without the Holy Spirit
[1:02:23] anointing him in that certain way amen
[1:02:26] since the time he was filled at the
[1:02:29] baptism of John now this God who he
[1:02:34] heard and felt and everything else was
[1:02:36] now moved anybody ever felt that way oh
[1:02:39] yeah I've had the Holy Spirit pull away
[1:02:41] from me at times and that's not a good
[1:02:44] feeling God will do it like the prophet
[1:02:50] of God said when he said to the Lord
[1:02:51] Lord you owe me an explanation
[1:02:54] brother well said he kept quiet but what
[1:02:58] a month or so however long it was he
[1:03:00] said but when God saw that I was done
[1:03:03] with my pouting
[1:03:05] he came back and he told me why there's
[1:03:15] always good answers in this thing oh
[1:03:18] lord have mercy give thanks to the
[1:03:22] father which have made us meet to be
[1:03:24] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:03:26] Saints in light who have delivered us
[1:03:31] from the power of darkness and
[1:03:33] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:03:37] dear son delivered us from the power of
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:42] huh so that means I don't care how
[1:03:44] strong and how powerful this darkness

[1:03:55] deliverance in order to be delivered is
[1:04:00] that right
[1:04:01] you were saved for the violation of law
[1:04:03] but you had to accept your salvation
[1:04:08] hallelujah
[1:04:09] not the Holy Ghost you were sealed
[1:04:11] before the foundation and all but you
[1:04:13] got to accept your sealing by faith you
[1:04:18] have accept everything by faith in order
[1:04:22] to please God by faith Enoch was
[1:04:28] translated that he should not see death
[1:04:34] and was not found because God had
[1:04:37] translated him for before his
[1:04:39] translation he had this testimony that
[1:04:42] he pleased God that's how we when God
[1:04:45] translate us we would have a testimony
[1:04:48] that we pleased if Enoch had to have a
[1:04:52] testimony that he pleased God you must
[1:04:54] have a testimony because God is not
[1:04:56] going to give you a grade curve y'all
