one at you amen you love the Lord we appreciate God and all that he's doing and all that he has done we uh oh we just know that God is real and we realize by God's grace that uh just managing this morning was a uh something that was burding me a burden but but God's grace God saw us through and I know I can't explain it but I know that we're closer now to the coming of the Lord more now than ever My Heart Cries Out I'm not saying that I've achieved everything I desire to achieve in Christ but one thing I do know I'm not wrong I know if the birds can feel it and the animals can feel it the nature is declaring it I know it's real first Samuel please 17 29 I apologize Brothers I I really wanted to sing that song but I guess you got to do everything in faith and I was lacking faith amen it's not your fault my fault but uh first Samuel please good to see everybody here first Samuel 17 we're going to read the 29th verse everybody there and David said what have I now done is there not a Cause let's pray our gracious father we thank you for your grace and your mercy and I thank you for being so good to me good to us you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and we thank God for the great victories in our lives we realize oh God that without you we would be nothing as we sang this morning will be like a drifting Ship Without a sail I'm so thankful to be in this message and I'm so thankful that you have given me understanding Lord too see the day and hour that we're living in it Lord I Thank for electioning I thank your God for choosing us all to be a part of your bride truly We Are So Unworthy in our flesh in itself is So Unworthy for you to dwell in but we thank you o God for choosing us and choosing us as a Dwelling Place Lord we pray tonight that you would bless every soul in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'm not going to be long uh by the grace of God good to see sister Ruth I hadn't seen you since the victory good to see you God is so good to us and we thank God for his Amazing Grace some of the things that I have been thinking about for a few days maybe a week or so I'm not sure but I know for personally it spoke to me and I was studying something and I saw something there in the 17th chapter of Samuel that I had never seen before and it it expired it inspired me to to bring this little message like I said it won't be long but then I began to see a pattern in the scripture where True Believers don't run we don't run oftentimes we stand in the midst of the battle and we don't know how we're going to come out as a winner we can't foresee the next day or the next moment and sometimes it's a midnight for us but there's something on the inside of us that makes us trust God and you know when I think about David and and the preached dog or brother random preached on the message uh Faith by experience was a real blessing and I began to share it with some of you all but that was the message that stirred me up because really it was not Israel that picked the fight it was Goliath that picked the fight and Goliath was a great giant of course of USA we know that the one of the gath brothers you know and but but we find out that somehow this little fella by the name of David understood who he was and he understood it was his position to take to challenge the devil or Goliath because Goliath had all Israel scared and it reminds me of the message people are so afraid now they're they're afraid of everything and and when when the enemy comes in you know instead of running to God or really standing up for the word we have a tendency to run and hide just like Israel and we we wonder how how could it be Israel when God was so with them how can they huddle up like a bunch of chickens you know afraid of the Wolf but one thing for certain David had an experience more than once and you heard me say last week uh Wednesday I believe it was I said this has nothing to do with feelings when you know that you know that you know that you know that there was a miracle that took place in your life because it's unexplainable you know God did it wasn't because of your goodness what what because you thought you merited it but because he chose to do it God is Sovereign within his within himself and I think I started thinking about the many things in you've heard me testify but I've I've thought about the many things that God brought me through that I did not deserve yeah because I trusted him I never understood many times why I was in battle and why certain things had to happen to me but I could see and can see how God brought me out and so when I saw David the same words that Goliath spoke against David took those words because you know the nomination of churches do that right naming and claim it is what they call it speak it is what they say and and you know here it is in the message we almost afraid to speak it because we don't believe what we're speaking but these people they decree it because they believe it so much and they get results and here it is amen we who got the fullness of the word and Goliath and I'm gonna use Goliath tonight Science Biology psychology all of these things that are now bombarding our minds with all of these perverted thoughts and things and if you're not careful Goliath would take your head because that's what he said to David I'm going to take your head and you know your mind comes with your head so basically it was an attack on Israel but God put David why do you think brother Brown was screamed out I wish we had a lot of a lot a lot of little Davids look it up it's a quote where are all the little Davids We're In the Heat of the battle and the thing that I love about David he didn't run like his brothers but he took the battle to the enemy with one Revelation and this is where I call it my little one stone Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever he is a God that and whatever he Ave it Hallelujah you love the Lord see we can't I put it this way like the prophet said God can't use and don't want no coward soldiers Saul was a coward Soldier he was so cowardly he he allowed David to go fight for him a big man a strong man the Bible said he stood Head and Shoulder above all the people so where did that put David but nevertheless it's not your size it's not even your religion brother said it's not the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fight in the dog and I believe by God's grace even those of us who will we may not be many in number I didn't expect a whole lot of people to come this evening they never do and the reason being is because they don't have a revelation that when they miss communion they rejecting Christ literally rejected him you damn if you do and you're damn if you don't and they always use the excuse I'm not maybe I'm not ready I'm not I mean fix show me anybody that's ready who's worthy of communion nobody is truly worthy that's why the Bible gives that time for us to examine ourselves that we may confess our sins and make right before God but people don't understand to come to reject communion is to reject Calvary y'all understand that the death barrier and Resurrection is in communion and to reject that and say I can't be a part of that if you can't be a part of his death burial and Resurrection you can't be a part of him and there is no Resurrection for you because you have in your own way and actions declared that you're not part of that broken body but let's move on in the message Lord show us the father in it suffices us he said and I look again and happen to notice by the way I'm talking about how there was a storm and he had just gotten there uh in that he was in that storm and he found that an eagle had been brought down by the storm and you remember the little chipmunk or whatever that was that was making all the chatter chatter chatter but it is in himself when he saw that eagle he thought to himself you know I want you to know he's talking to him you know I could shoot you if I want to he said even then that he eager looked at him like you don't bother me and he said I happen to know that the ego had bravery it wasn't scared no matter what I'll do or what anything it was Brave and I thought that's it God you don't want cowards God wants men and women who's got a backbone instead of a wishbone When God says anything we believe in that's all that settles it God says so that makes it true is that right that makes it true that's what people understand this is God's word because it's God's word it makes this true it's true you can Bank on it think about it David was so powerful even as a Young Man he became uh can I say it I think a Saul's armor Bearer Saul's servant he's his musician and you know how Saul got Dave God got jealous of of David we look at the story and we read it as if it's nothing but in the eyes of Saul he wanted to kill David it got so bad he threw a javelin trying to feed him that would have been the day I quit but nevertheless amen David had a love for Saul even though and he understood Saul was not being himself Saul had an evil spirit on him because of what he had done and even when David could have killed Saul in the cave David would not kill them in fact he felt guilty and really bad for cutting His Garment but he wanted to show Saul if I wanted to kill you I could have done so right but still there was a conviction you touched the anointed of God and though he was Fallen he's still at that one point was the chosen of God is that right and even though we've been told Saul wasn't saved we realized Saul was saved but David even in Saul's Fallen position had respect for him now that's something to learn because we find out that people don't know how to find respect for each other when they fall or come short they can remember all they used to do this they used to do that listen people if God chose them to do that they they still chosen of God but we forget and we let the devil divide Us by forgetting think about it if we had the ability to really forgive and look into people's lives and hearts and become what they are then we'll understand why they did what they did and our compassion and our love for each other would keep us in that Unity oh it's true true even in this church it ain't about how many times you've Fallen what you did when you failed it's about getting up that's it that's it Christians do fall but they get up but we'll hold it like we're righteous we're more righteous and understand if you can't forgive your brother neither will God forgive you Matthew 6 12-15 says and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if we forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you let me tell you something I'd rather forgive a person for something he can't be forgiven of than to forgive him of for than to never forgive him if it means I've got to have more grace than God give me that I'd rather stand before God Amen with that then a harsh judgment are behind or toward a person but if we forgive not men that trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses think about it and that's in the scripture all that you have done as a Christian at the end of the road if there be somebody in your life in your heart that you have not forgiven God said he raises every good work you've ever done and place you back in prison as though you've never been forgiven in your entire life now that's a harsh penalty that's rough and I don't think any of us want to ever fall into that what it is is that we allow the enemy to put these strongholds in US and we fail to see that these strongholds are there to destroy you and to change you and to deform you amen into something that God did not intend for you to be how can you ever reach perfect love if there's bitterness in your heart toward anybody you can't do it Psalms 23 1-6 says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I love that that means everything I need everything I need he will supply and I quoted this today he making me lie down in cream pastures he leaded me beside the Steel Waters that's deep stuffs deep deep deep he restores my soul I need that he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for what his name say oh you don't Merit nothing there's no good thing about us he only does what he do he do for his name's sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil and I don't by the grace of God for thou art with me if I don't know nothing else I do know that that the Lord is with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me it is the word that comforts me listen let me tell you something it's good to have friends relatives and all that will give you confident kinds but somewhere they will come short not intentionally we just can't be there when you need us all the time but there is one thing that can be there at all times and that's the word and let me tell you something there are times you've got to just encourage yourself like David did himself he courage encouraged himself in the Lord hallelujah there here it is and like I said a lot of time we don't expect the table to be but the table thou prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies and you gotta eat whatever he prepared you gotta take it is that right he said well what do you mean the Lord prepared the table before Jesus he had to suffer he he had to take everything that was given to he had because it was prepared for him Calvary was prepared for one man and that was Jesus and he had to walk it all along there was no comforting friends everybody was screaming I Blasphemous stuff people hated him and yet he had to walk alone carrying that Cross by himself sometimes you got to walk that path huh sometimes you gotta do it that's been prepared Lord why me why not you stop praying if you want to be just like him stop up keep on praying but if you don't want to be like him stop praying because all God is doing is answering your prayer tough times are going to come straight and narrates away yeah yeah but one thing for certain in the midst of all of this surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I I like that word all that word all means nothing is left out all of my days and I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever you got to take listen one thing I learned when you take the battle to the devil you don't get in his face with your flesh this come by prayer this come by fasting and how she wanted the Holy Ghost so bad she fasted seven days and God gave her the Holy Ghost that I Marvel at that it was Billy Paul having been married before this is his second wife right and God still gave it the Holy Ghost see it throws it throws all these people ideas out of the way God God justify whom he will God have mercy on whom he will he give the Holy Ghost to whom he will and who's going to stop him God don't care about your theology God loves people that's what Calvary was all about do you think if I had had a choice to be born in another somebody else's family that I would not take it because of the times and it tends to have gone through y'all know what I'm saying everybody wish they would have been born somewhere else or something something else would have been different doesn't mean that you don't didn't love your parents but you wish the conditions would have been different right but you would have never become the person that you are now had it been different and that's why I thank God for everything that I've ever gone through in my life we've got to understand that this word is God you know I've said that so many times the word is God so if you can't believe the word you can't believe God it makes you an unbeliever the word is god let's say it again the word is God and when you believe the word that's believing God and God listen when Faith projects something has to change something has to happen hey God can't see you believing his word and say ah no that doesn't matter no no no those are the kinds of things that pleases God remember when Jesus saw faith that was off the chart he says no I have not seen such faith in all of Israel right it pleases God he compliments you when you can hold fast to those things that seems impossible listen in the message absolute president said and the God and the god that could deliver them he Hebrew children from the death sale of a fiery furnace how much more can he deliver this little Jewish boy out here you see a lot of people say I want to have faith and I believe it and at least a little wind come by you let go of the Rope you got faith faith will take you to your death I believe it till I die you should have said Faith don't quit it doesn't give up it's not Faith it's not based upon your five senses you'll see your smell your taste your re no no not even in your Consciousness faith faith call those things that be no not as though they were Faith don't care if there's a mountain in front of the object Faith believed that somehow that mountain is going to move or that object going to find a way through the mountain that's what faith is it's got it's got to be there's no way it's impossible for it not to happen I believe it I receive it I'll die with it it must happen it has to happen and one thing I'm gonna say say like this God don't oh nobody knows nothing and if he won't do it on this side he'll do it on the other but you're going to get what you prayed for foreign Hallelujah he delivered those little Jewish boys out here that's laying Yandy in a death sale how much more and if he's still the same Jehovah God that he always was we like Apostle Paul can realize that the saying God lives today yesterday today and forever I used to get jealous of the Old Testament things I know that sound crazy but I used to get jealous God performs you know for the Hebrew boys God performed for David God performed for Joshua and you know for whatever reason I I didn't think he would perform for us like that but he's the same when that revelation of Hebrews 13 8 comes to you it makes your God not small but great and there is nothing greater than he is you can't look at them like they special and they Jews and they had a special something no no no no your Covenant is greater than that because your Covenant is unconditional that means that it's y'all understand that God don't base you base uh your blessings on on your conditions you see what I'm saying it's what it is I mean you know you think about what Abraham did you know it's got to be unconditional sell out your wife come on yes ah right and today forever my nose is not running it just feel like it then Christians I anyway I'm inappropriate I'll tell you later Christians hope to God my wife says when you talk like that that means you're sleepy Christian can hold God's unchanging your hand I can almost hear a voice and change the whole situation Prayer Changes Things I believe that that's what we want to do how can we say about Joshua how is he going to cross the Jordan seem like God was a strange military man right in the month of April when the waters was up like that but he said to Joshua take the ark and go forward that's all he had to do and God moved back to Jordan and made dry grounds and they walked across and was delivered how was it no wonder Joshua said for me and my house will serve the Lord see because what it was the spies came back and said no you can't go there sorry you can't go there and uh I don't know what that was amen it ain't my phone you can't go there but the problem is Joshua took the battle to the enemy I never knew this thing could talk where is coming from but anyhow that means they're listening right it's what God wants us to do when the opposition comes don't run from it as if it's impossible no no no no no God put it there we forget oh the devil didn't know but God allowed the devil to do it that means you can conquer it you know it's the conquest is yours but it's not you fighting it's not a count of battle it's a knee battle it's when you begin to pray and believe God you trust God and you don't stop until you get a peace that's the problem we pray but we pray and we pray but we don't get the peace when the peace come that's the peace Giver he just told you you just won the battle yeah hear what I'm saying I'm gonna say that again because when the peace is given that's like the Holy Ghost you might not speak in tongues you and I might jump and Shout but when that peace comes that's God settling it for you now you can say I got it because I got the peace of God you might shouting days later but why all that you know what I'm trying to say I want people to understand that God will always vindicate your victory right he told Israel don't you worry I'm giving you peace right I'm gonna give you so much peace I want you to put the music before the for the Army I've given you the battle understand the battle is not yours it is the Lord but when God put you in the battle he expect you to come on the Forefront not run like Israel did I believe it Esther to the battle you know you know most people when it seems like you're outnumbered they really do get scared and they think to themselves how in the world I'm going to do this you know the problem is you you think yo how can I say it because your requests may be something that seems impossible to other people doesn't mean it's impossible for God I'm gonna say that again if God put a request or thirst in your heart for something if God now and and everything that you desire would be for the glory of God don't you ever think God cannot do it because if he put in in your heart that means he placed it there to fulfill it that's true you don't even have to be a Christian to have that kind of a faith most people when it comes to business they set a goal they believe it's going to happen and they go for it it doesn't mean they don't have disappointments this apartment is going to come but they realize it's just a trial it's just a test and I know what I want I'm not quitting I'm going forward and they normally get it they get it that's the difference between those stars out there in Hollywood they wouldn't give up and they would do whatever it costs or take to get the a position that they wanted to right to get it's just the way it works you don't sit on the couch and say I'm going to be president in 10 years no you get out there and you do some work Faith brings an action it's an active word you gotta show that you really believe that you're capable of doing it and most of all they're capable it that God is capable of giving it in every trial every test I'm not long I'm not long every trial and test is there to bring us an experience to you that will glorify God you know what and that's I think we failed to see that because we don't testify like we should and the more you testify the more God will use you Lord I want to be used by God well I just did this for you and you didn't even think or you didn't even tell nobody I did why people are so ashamed of testimony they don't know they don't testify no more but people in my day when I was coming up no matter what if it was you know I didn't have money to pay my light bill and God blessed me with the money to pay my light bill praise the Lord and then you hear the music we would dance we would Shout over over testimony such as that it didn't have to be like I won the lottery it was something small but now we don't see the testimonies no more we need to thank God for all things Psalm 27 1-5 I'm telling you if you praise him the way he should be praised there would not be anything you asked God for and he won't give it to you I know what I'm talking about and don't be ashamed Praise Him in the front of enemies and everything you know even on the job tell them what God has done for you they're going to look at you like you're crazy but yeah God did it how they gonna know God is real if you don't testify to it I tell you what really struck me the other day is when I was sent that that uh little uh testimony where the lady was raised from the dead and and I know a lot of people don't believe in and the lady on the testimony said the doctor didn't believe she said but I didn't care what he believed here she is calling the people a Holy Roller and she's acting like one and you know I know it's true because that's being the Rod's sister uh benaraz wife cousin or niece but they're related to Tabitha who's been the Rod's wife and so Joseph Hammond had already heard of the testimony but you know it gave me a joy to know that something's moving and let me tell you something God will testify he said listen if you don't praise me I'll cause the rocks to cry out he deserved to praise you know I'll tell you what our atmosphere is supposed to be energized we're not a denomination we're not in an organization we're in the word and rejoicing of the word we're you know we're at a place where we we should almost take the roof off this building really it's true if you realize what you possess and I'm gonna say it again the word is God amen and then for God to send a messenger with a message to keep us from being lost to keep us from making uh making them the same mistake they're doing and taking the mark of the beast if you take the mark of these knowing this message you willfully did it but nobody here knowing the word how can you take the mark you can't you can't you've been instructed you know what it is where it came from how it started you know from Jesus to revelation now he's molding us and making us and we say oh praise God you know you got to understand let me say it like this you don't have much time so you better redeem the time and worship God and praise him like you ought to and I'll tell you one thing if you do that you could answer at your your will and he'll give it to you let me say it like this that woman who was in Simon house could have got anything she wanted just by worshiping she didn't even open her mouth just by worshiping she could have got anything she wanted right when Esther came into into the that's why I like that Esther took it to the King right Esther took it to Mordecai right Mordecai came to Esther and and and said think not with thyself that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews don't you think the wrath of God you're gonna it's gonna miss you because the point is of who you are where you're located understand judgment is going to hit this this whole earth everywhere there's no hiding place and the only place that is a hiding is in Christ Jesus right and Esther she said wait a minute something struck her amen and she got Anointed with the with the spirit of that moment and nobody you can't do that on your own God has to do it for you right she got anointed and I love it because she fasted for three days and and now she says don't drink no water or eat no bread right you know what that was that was her death burial and resurrection and she rose up the next day to go to see the okay right and you and I must understand because she said one thing if I perish let me perish in other words I'm saying the same thing if if I perish trying to be perfected by the Holy Spirit if whatever he has in store for me so let it be I've got to see him face to face I'm not preaching something to you that's not happening in me no it's happening in me changes are being made in me but it left with just that you know Esther didn't have nothing written on paper like we do she didn't say well we you know is is in the Scrolls no she was she was the inspiration of this message to strike us testimony of experience there because we're going to have a long praise and worship service with all of the testimonies that's going to go up before God I tell you this and I don't I don't normally say things like this but when I think I've said it here before I'm not a smart fellow I don't you know I've had um you know a couple of Strokes in my life and I feel like it affected me but nevertheless they affected me but nevertheless you know when I graduated from high school I graduated with the highest honor and and you know far scholarships and um what got me there excuse me what got me there wasn't that I was more brilliant than the others but I knew I had a had had a mama that taught me how to pray and I saw Faith but I didn't even understand it because when my mom said Junior don't worry about it this is what's going to happen it happened and there were times because my daddy left us at When We Were Young and my mother had to struggle with all those children by herself so there was times there were food a lot a lack of food in the house and mama said Junior don't worry because you know I used I used to love to eat and that's the way it is when you ain't got nothing huh where it is but nevertheless you would say we say bring some food today now she had just told me that and I'm going outside through the back door to go play and I'll open that door and there's about three to four sacks of food and to this day we don't know where that food came from but we know God brought it you understand me so she taught me Faith speak it and believe it and it happened a woman that didn't even have an education knew God in a way that would always move him when the wicked listen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid you know when you wait on God that means it doesn't come when you think it ought to or when you want it to it comes when God ordained it to when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell and though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the wall should rise against me in this will I be confident I wasn't even a Christian and I had a gang of girls surround me want to fight I didn't fear because I didn't even know they wanted to fight they wanted to beat me but I I said the right things and didn't do nothing well I didn't know until finally later on to it down the road I'm like what what thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after y'all might I'm telling you I was in I was in Brazil and a brother was taking advantage of me and he was literally belittling me in front of the Brazilians and the Guyanese and they got so angry at the at this brother they wanted to fight him well I was in oblivious I was I didn't even know it they thought it was all his character I just ignored him ah and they remind me today to this day they admire me for handling it the way I did but God blinded me y'all understand me he Blinded Me one thing I desire to the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell let me tell you something is that right this is the rapture scripture he said one thing out of all that's been said one thing I desire that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquiring his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall what hide me in his provision in the secret of the Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock a revelation see every Victory brings testimonies of the Lord's doing right now I've been here long enough so I'm just going to read these and then we'll go into the communion I wait patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry see let me say it like this if the enemy is coming and you are suffering and you're going through things you're talking to somebody else and trying to reason with somebody else it's not the solution to your problem the solution to your problem is prayer When you pray ER changes things change the conditions of everything around you listen if you got an enemy on the job pray ER my sons they always call me this is what's happening not always but they call me and and and usually they'll get a promotion or the brother the person get moved out of the way or get fired or something I mean it happens all the time you don't have to scream at somebody on the job because they scream at you you pray Lord this is my enemy that's what David did avenge me oh God you can't fight but he can he's your Shepherd he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the Maori claim and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings hmm you know that listen people this might sound crazy but way before I was just a young people across the church and uh uh Christian and I had this manager she wanted she had me in her mind come on the job one night all drunk and stuff and looking at them that ain't happening you know what God did he moved that woman oh yeah and I wasn't tempted no no no no no I was not tempted but he moved her she got in my way I tell you that she was my boss so she could have fired me but nevertheless the next day when she came back to work she was so a shame of her what she tried to do y'all hear what I'm saying any other she wasn't ugly you understand me if I was looking for something she would have been pleasing to my eyes but I was not y'all understand me he have put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust the Lord so I said all that to say that's what I'm trying to tell you let me let me hurry up through this brother Adam calls her spiritual astronauts he said a spiritual astronaut is controlled by unit also a unit of Prayer that controls the spiritual astronaut keeps him lying up uh-huh is prayer oh it's good I tell you God had a little unit setting on Earth one time when his first astronaut was here and you know one little touch of Faith stopped him and that has that answered him back Prayer Changes Things it changes positions by prayer that can control see we see what can what can be done in the natural and it's a type of the spiritual the spiritual happenings it can be controlled that way y'all hear what I'm saying with attitudes and everything else goes wrong on the job and and and and and the enemy tell listen you heard me say that time amen when the man said well I don't have a job for you well I didn't go home and you know crying and worried because I know God what God told me by the time I got home that manager had called back told my wife to come back tell me to come back and I got the job was one of the best jobs I ever had he made a position for me do y'all understand what I'm saying he made a position for and and I don't want you to ever think that's impossible because God said in his word if you whatsoever you desire he'll give it to you if you abide in my word and my my word abide in you living as close to God as you possibly can God said it he'll give it to you he'll do just what you ask him to do because he know whatever He blesses with you blesses you with you will glorify him we love the Lord I I you know I I'm saying this from now on don't run from the battles what I've been doing is just setting myself aside praying fasting and I'm praying and fasting not just for myself but others and having victory in this church and that's who I'm praying for I'm praying for the people here and I believe I believe God is has answers to my prayer I'm just waiting for the manifestation yeah yeah yeah that's that's it that's it I can't do it but I do know the greater Shepherd who knows the enemy of far all you love the Lord it's about time for us to prepare for our communion
