[Music] [Music] amen amen so glad that everybody was able to find seats God is so good to us not prolonging the time we're just gonna get right on into the Word of God oh I'm so glad to be a Christian money can't buy Oh and that song it's amazing when you're little I remember as a child that was one of my favorite songs in the Baptist Church and I don't know whether it was cause they March the other way but I love that song so much that even as a child I was seeing that song so every time I hear it it just brings fond memories and I can see those old Baptist sisters as they walked and they twist with those big old hats yes one Lito days we will be marching right on in there we're gonna we gonna start the service again with the same Scripture ibaka - I love this word it's amazing you know how in case you see how Noah must have felt having a mega church and it drops down to eight Amen even the even animals knew better they did least came to church they did go to church but you know human beings it's amazing how they just don't get it it's got to be Grace and we appreciate the Lord a backhoe - two through four and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it was surely calm it will not tarry behold this soul which has lifted up its not upright in him but the judge shall live by his faith I love that because I don't know how to live by my own I really mean here father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us and we have been to ourselves and we pray father God that your perfect will be done here this evening we thank you for those souls that did come out this evening to hear your word bless them in a special way father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated sometimes I'm thinking I'm I told my wife I said I trust and hope that's really getting over I believe the word and I think about when God told Noah then a flood was coming no I had no book to read there was no seminary or any place that Noah could go to get this information so where did Noah get this information we find out that God by way of thought drops into your heart revelation and when that revelation strike you've got to move the thing about revelation is that everybody doesn't receive it at the same time and sometimes you may be the only individual that catches this revelation but when that revelation strikes you is not dead is active the reason why it is God in the form of Revelation see we think revelation is just something for some thought but in reality it is the mind of God dropping into your soul causing you to act as he would act revelation like the prophet of God said when we get over there we're going to see how valuable revelation was because revelation is God that's the only way that Abel would have understood God he had perhaps Adam and Eve as parents who could have told him about what took place but deserts a make you a believer when you hear the word that is not what it's when God quickens that when that revelation becomes real to you when it opens up a window of eternity and then you'll be able to see what he's talking about it's more than just a letter it becomes life and we we're talking about a city of perfection you and I can't make that city as we are we all come short of the glory of God and even when the lamb opened the book remember there was only one who was worthy to open the book John wasn't worried that Jeremiah wasn't worthy none of the prophets of old were worthy the 24 elders amen saw the lamb and they threw their crowns off they fell on their faces because they realized they were not worried that John wept because he understood that he wasn't worthy and there was only one word and that was a Lamb of God so we understand by the grace of God this message that we have amen is not based upon worthiness it's based upon His grace is that right because we see in a Cariah that the whole Kent headstone comes down crying grace grace we understand grace and understand grace is a revelation hallelujah Oh glory to God as we said this morning we are here to express something you know if Noah had gotten a real revelation from God and set down on it we would have never had anybody to be saved because the flood would have consumed everything in everyone but once the revelation struck him he couldn't explain to anybody he had never seen rain himself but he knew it was going to happen and by revelation no doubt God showed him but how can you explain something supernatural to a man that's natural and he moved with the fear of God because amen he became the expression of God's thoughts you understand me he literally became the expression God's Word for his day and that's where I'm trying to get the people to see that God did not call us to be religious he did not call us to become a church God called us to be the expression of the word for our day if we come short of that it shows that we are not the word right because the word is active it is alive it moves it lives it literally is the thought of God behind veils whoa expressing itself genuine Christian faith moves with reverence and fear they cannot even explain it but it's like something that jumps in them and operates itself through them what would make a young girl by the name of Mary say to to the angel be it unto me according to thy word understanding that because she allows this to happen persecution is on the way see there's no way that you oh Lord I choose to walk with you but understand when you have made that choice to walk with God Amen you have made that choice to suffer with God because he said if you suffer with me your reign with me and I believe with all of my heart every one of us has to make that choice in this day look at us amen we're not a make a Church we're not even what you would call a regular Church but neither was Noah and we we understand by God's grace that Noah was the own wasn't the only one building building ships there were other ships that were built you said well how could that because remember when the original come forth there's always a copycat there's always somebody saying well you know I can do that or I can do a better job or if it does happen want to be prepared understand by God's grace science is trying to outrun the judgment of God they're literally trying to find other worlds and other places to build other kingdoms but they failed to see the Bible said the heavens and the earth will pass away there's no safe place on earth to escape the wrath of God but there is a place hallelujah but the place in which we're speaking of is in a duct another dimension hallelujah but is real is that right will we talk about God allowing genuine faith to strike a person it anchors within that person's heart so much so that if it's real if it when it's real it doesn't matter if a person is in a wheelchair they're getting up y'all hear me what about a person who's never seen never had eyesight but when the revelation strikes them all of a sudden their eyes come open we can't explain it because it's supernatural but his faith is something that's given to that individual hallelujah is that right as I was talking to her brother the other day what's called what what what faith did that did Lazard have when he was dead there was nothing that Lazarus could do he was there wherever he was he we don't know but never didn't have ears to hear in the natural he didn't have eyes to see in the natural but when Jesus said Lazarus come forth you see something about faith you must understand that faith is not a thing faith is God it is a person it is God acting on his behalf when God said do something he doesn't leave it up to you to do it God does it himself God rewards us for allowing him to use our bodies woo somebody help me here yeah you saw what do you mean brother a genuine faith as I said Amen and I'm talking about what's happening today because we've got so many people in the message and they're failing to have this genuine faith to press on and to move toward perfection this is our move this is our grace that God has given us time and there's a lot of us time to come into a perfect statue of Christ is that right yeah man and you must understand that except the Lord builds the house the laborers lavery in main.c is God building you not you building you is that right in the message statue of a perfect man brother man said you don't add to it it has to you and God knows the path is that right if the vow said he's our Shepherd and the Shepherd knows the path in which he leads you everybody's path is different but there's only one door one entrance into that place where we are going amen Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to eternal life and only a few be that find it this is why I'm screaming you know because I see things I feel things I can't even explain things that are going and it I can imagine I'm nobody I'm no great one but one thing I do know and I believe from the depths of my heart is that we're not far from a translation I believe that with all my heart and I think people are looking in the wrong place for the wrong symptoms you know what what we should be like brother man said he talked about he said if you want to know where the time where time is he said watch Israel hallelujah and I'm gonna say when you know if you can if God said watch Israel what about the bride you understand me amen he gave us a preview of the rapture he gave us a preview of all of the women a brides that were going to march before that that counsel that that's that that judgment seat right he sold us amen all of those women marching amen and how one became worse than the other he said Miss America was the worst of all hallelujah and he threw up his hand he was grieved by what he saw it is always this Oh my mind my message my preaching has produced then all of a sudden he heard a little tune onward Christian soldier marching has the one wall he saw that little bride Amen stepping to the tune of the word hallelujah Col de gallo hear what I'm saying and she would dress right hallelujah he said and just before they all went up he said there was a few of them looking around and all you got to do is look around there's a mini that is looking around and he scream get in line and that's where I met trying to scream in echo let us get back in line hallelujah let us get back in line or would Christian soldier marching as to war that tune that soul was predestinated so that we can remember we are at war hallelujah we're fighting hallelujah for every Christian right every Christian principle hallelujah glory to God you gotta press this thing it doesn't come easy I don't want it to be easy so that when I get on the other side like I said the other day I can show my scars hallelujah I can show that I've been in a battle hallelujah oh my you know that's where God is gonna really reward us when you see that no matter what you went through you kept pressing the battle hallelujah like that like that that brother said if Satan take everything I got even my teeth out gum him to death hallelujah he gonna know he been in a fight hallelujah and you know I must realize by God's grace it is oppressing you you know it's like any birth hallelujah that baby has the birth press is that right while the mother's womb is contracting and let me say it like this this world is getting too small for me I got to get up out of here you understand me and you and I y'all is closing in and this is the thing I love about it that when a baby is born breech something's wrong when a child of God is born breech it something's wrong in order for that child to make it out right he's got to turn around this is what I love about it every baby born comes with his face down every now and again they come up but the point is they're in the prayer position you can't make it out here with our prayer hallelujah love the Lord the thing that I love about her back he said when the vision has been made playing it's got to become clear what your vision is it ain't it ain't it ain't to be you know a millionaire or any kind of other heir you know what your vision supposed to be your vision is to be just like Jesus whoo somebody help me in pulse it I'm fighting everyday I'm designed everyday I'm pressing toward the mark my mark is to be in the very Express image of Jesus Christ is that right father I wouldn't they be one even as we are one Lord I am in you you are in me and I into him hallelujah the whole Godhead in the body of Jesus Christ God coming down like I said last night it's not like he's throwing something up something outside of himself no sir God comes along and he puts himself into you hello somebody you understand me and therefore when God is in you God does the same thing he did yesterday and he will do forevermore is that right see the word for your age must be expressed that's what made brother Branham who he was everybody claimed to have been Elijah but everybody couldn't produce the life of Elijah there was only one hallelujah and he says listen he said if you don't believe me for what I profess to be what about the works hallelujah and you can see that even as Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God he was God in manifested in the flesh he was the fullness of Godhead Pilate he was the only one that didn't have a measure of faith hallelujah but every man has had a measure of faith right and so you got to understand by God's grace if God puts a teaspoon of himself and you you just as a potent as the ocean every ingredients in that teaspoon is in you that's in the ocean hallelujah that's why he said these signs shall follow them that believe how could you be the bride and you have no signs following how can you be the bride and you declare there's no space and room for gifts of God when Rebecca got to Isaac she had all the gifts hallelujah she may not have been using them but at the same time she was able to display what she had you understand me you and I must understand by God's grace amen when we talk about perfection we're talking about totally yielding and dying that is the law of this dimension you cannot live unless you die I heard the prophet of God say something today that I'd never heard before he said you know what even the clouds must die I said what yes the clouds even die and they cry about it hallelujah we call it rain but in order for that those those clouds must die it must be changing to rain then when rain comes down amen it resurrects again and start all over the process yeah everything must die in order to live got a plate we must die right in here the Holy Spirit is identifying within us every little thing that we ought we ought to get rid of and you and I must continue to pray and ask for his mercy His grace hallelujah is given to us is how us is part of our inheritance but if you don't use it that's like a pardon a pardon is not a pardon accepted being received as a pardon if you don't use it you don't have it God has given us mercy and grace for us to use it hallelujah glory to God it's not just sitting up on the Shelf to sit with that's mercy and that's grace no it's given to us God knows this this this evil age he knows what it's gonna take to overcome it blessing it's a man that overcometh hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and you and I cannot overcome it without the mercy and grace of God hallelujah you saw what do you mean brother let me say like this because we all we up with people somehow we we like to get into this ritualistic type of worship yeah that's the kind that God hates what if I came to you and and every time I talk to you I'm telling you the same stuff you would say what you know you would get a little irritated right because all you're gonna that's all you can talk about we're not there's tons of things that you can be we could be talking about all you're doing is talking about the same stop over and over again and guess what all those things were already taking care of a long time ago and while you keep bringing it up yeah I understand what I'm saying and you know God don't like that repetition type of stuff he don't mind he wants you to pray everyday he wants you to fast whenever you can he wants you to be consecrated but God wants you to talk to him give us this day our daily bread Lord God wants you to really be able to talk to him you know what I'm saying how many times you go to God in prayer and all you do is go to praise Him what we always asking for stuff he knows what you need sometimes we need to just go in says lord I just thank you you're so good I'm telling you I've been there you tell him I getting up off the float drunk you get up drunk cuz he give you a lot of wine when you start doing that you please God amen when you just go to God in prayer just to thank him it's the truth Jesus Christ was not just a mere man he was God expression he was not only man but he was God and that was expressed through this veil we called Jesus and you got you and I must understand amen it was the reflection of the word for that day a virgin shall conceive right we saw him in a manger we understand those things but as he began to grow and mature we seen more God hallelujah it was fantastic when he turned the water into wine it was amazing when he walked on on the Sun on the Sea of Galilee hallelujah but the most amazing thing that Jesus ever did in his day in time was that he died and he rose again hallelujah and when he rose again he preached they'll say didn't yes he did he preached and he told them hey men on the road to Emmaus I'm the man he went through jettisoned him brought him all the way up throughout the province and he preached he preached the same Jesus but he come back with a greater message the Lamb that was dead is now alive hallelujah don't you worry little flock it is a father's pleasure and good will to give you the kingdom see that's what we fail to see it ain't your will is his will to give it to you that's why you have a will to do it god for that eh to what make the age see God's promises for that age you understand me what good is you know I always tell people I said them if this is where God want us to be in this little place that's ok but I'd rather have something where I could where it can be seen because the Bible says you know your city that sits over here they cannot be here but back in here we see look like we hide from something and every almost every message I've ever ever met the church I've ever gone through they be somewhere that you came fighting them hallelujah it's important that we understand that in age it is that's true too but God amen love to have a place where people can see it it's on both sides folks it's natural and spiritual hallelujah so you must understand by God's grace amen when God is doing something we must understand amen it is a written word right you said what what do you mean brother when even when Jesus Christ was born he born he was born at a busy time that he actually attracted people hello there was a light it attracted to people Amen that was in the city even though there were many that didn't see it but those that elected they saw here's a child angels even said Amen this child is born in Bethlehem ain't preaching on freedom Christian but my point is is that when God shines a light he wants it to be seen hallelujah a spirit of God and when I when I come to this place I want you to understand the Spirit of God when is it written like brother I'm said he said it's the Spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this a to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah somebody is he's looking he's looking he's looking he's looking and limitary something it will not be that many people in this age that's why it just makes me nervous when everybody and I don't like this collective thing I don't like the collectiveness about what we call the message hallelujah because when we call it the message what are you saying because we have 1/2 hours our song service is it because Amen we we quote the Prophet well what makes it a message church what makes it as a message church is when the message is in the church when God is in the individuals that's what makes it hallelujah you see what I'm saying it is the same thing you sure well what makes McDonald McDonald the golden arches hallelujah there's some symbol up there saying this is McDonald if that's the way the church has become we must have certain pictures up and everything else to symbolize we are the message that is not the reflection in with God is looking for he's looking for a life that reflects him is wrong with those things but what good is to have all those things if there's no life there that's all I'm saying I get in trouble for saying stuff like that cuz people misunderstand me but I really don't care I know who I am when you come to know who you are you don't care you understand me Amen you become that very mouthpiece of God you become the very very very expression of God and then regardless of what people say what people think you know what God wants to be done with the word hallelujah God wants that word to be lived not just preach way that you can preach this to live it that is the message that God wants hallelujah come on somebody it's true they could even tell who Jesus was until Judas kissed him hallelujah so you got to understand it goes beyond there are people who are blind and I'll never see but there are those that we must live this life for so that they can see hallelujah listen the prophet of God goes and say the real born-again people of this age that filled with the Holy Ghost is the tide post of the scripture that got to be fulfilled in these last days is the typos hallelujah we are the manifestation but that which had been preached by Malachi for in Revelation 10 7 how can you prophesy again except that life of prophecy is in you and understand the prophet of God tells us they meant the real Son of Man is to Holy Spirit himself he is the true prophet he is the true messenger and how can you run and tell that if the messenger is not in you I'm gonna talk about a man I'm talking about the Holy Spirit I got quotes for those things but my point is how come we beat you know everybody and it just scares me because I know what I'm looking at I know what I'm pressing into I know what I'm fighting for every day and I think to myself you know what's wrong with the people why would you accept religion right now when you know the coming of the Lord is at hand you know he said yes you be hot or cold come show me with a hot show me where the fire is show me where the man of the woman is on fire for that show me look at this place they just hears everywhere people don't want to come to church you know why because they've been distracted the fire is going down some of them are cold some don't have the love of God anymore because the Bible said in that last day that love of many shall wax cold it's true what about you don't let the devil put your fire out put another log or something on and keep the fire burning let them call you phonetic whatever they want to call you but don't let the fire go out that's right we must fulfill this we are the top posts is that right we are the ultimen it's God's ultimate is that right yonder tell me there's nothing that comes higher than this group you understand me this message is the ultimate Christian I don't know how it is the ultimate is God's masterpiece that's why Amen he's chipping away in our lives he's trying to get rid of everything that's not like you like him he's got to do it that way though it may be painful its needful everybody want to smooth sailing ah but you chose the heart away and just like Peter say Lord where else can we go where is this message is there anything greater where else can we go so you got to understand this is what we're winning with a dilemma you got to make a choice you going to either go forward or you're gonna stand still and stand stealing beans instead standing still means to backslide a lot of times people think standing still needs to back up know when the car backs not he folds buckles his knees and he won't go nowhere that's where backsliding is when you won't you refuse to progress you've refused to go Father you understand me oh listen the prophet of God which is so true he said this real genuine Holy Ghost it'll make you do things that the ordinary man wouldn't do it's a truth it'll make you do things that the ordinary man wouldn't do hallelujah it'll make you a man go places that right it'll make every man and woman do things that they wouldn't ordinarily do hallelujah why because you got the Holy Ghost in you to be your stabilizer Oh Lord it's your ink of your soul it is the thing that keeps you moving when nobody else will go on you got to go home y'all understand me hallelujah hallelujah Oh as I said the born-again Christian is tied to Christ and the Bible and this is what I don't understand how people just say I'm a Christian and will read their Bibles hallelujah I thank God for the anointing but I thank God for the word that I could read hallelujah is in this book I find faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying it's what I feed on it's what makes me who I am oh my as I said what is a revelation but the thought of God dropped into your heart I don't know what it means to be born from birth but that man who was born from birth somehow amen faith dropped in his heart I you think he could have mustered it up there was no schooling that he could have gone to mama couldn't explain it to him he didn't even know what sight was he never had eyesight before her but whatever it is I want it Lord and you says his mind is mine that's what I'm saying I don't know what perfection is I don't know what it's gonna be like that over there but I believe it and it's mine and the faith that God has dropped in my heart is taking me there taking you there a place we've never been before hallelujah but I know it's real it's more real to me than this book I'm hoping in my head hallelujah I don't know how to explain but that's like like like our brother said there's something that keeps holding me something keeps pulling me hallelujah something and I can't explain it but I do know it's God hallelujah see because God when he produces that word by thought in you you sometimes say where did that thought come from you ever seen yourself reading the word and then all of a sudden a thought hits you and it just doesn't stay in one place it kind of spreads out you began to see a whole picture of things by one thought that's God hallelujah yes and you don't even know think about the woman with the issue of blood how does she get to you see God by his own infinite wisdom and knowledge he knew that lady before she became what she was yes Wow he produced the scene y'all know what I'm saying he allowed sickness to strike her he prepared the grounds he knew that one day Jesus was going to come by that same place he saw that woman even when she crawled him you understand me she was weak and she touched the hem of His garment you can't touch the hem of God's garment like this you got a humble yourself hallelujah and she touched the hem of His garment in there and something inspired her to do it there was nothing in the law there was no word nobody told her that no neighbor first time ever happening but the revelation struck her if I could just but touch the hem of His garment I would be made whole is that right the problem God said even Jesus didn't know what he said who touched me because she would be on him and touched God somebody help me here see that's why I say times God dropped things in your mind you don't process it you don't say well that doesn't sound reasonable more than likely that it's not reasonable is God hallelujah God doesn't make sense to the natural man how can a boat made out of shittim would go forward scuse me how can he be float on the earth float in a time of trouble like that to the scientific mind it makes no sense how can you and I one day will walk through the wall it is what it is I'm looking forward to the day hallelujah you don't have to worry about air pollution over there cuz no automobiles will be there we're travel like a thought I believe that hallelujah right God need a dedicated channel y'all know what a dedicated channel is is that person that's gonna keep the channel open that channel is only for God hmm amen you see that's what brother and he described the prophets he said they were dedicated channels and I thought to myself but I can be a dedicated channel you can be a dedicated channel amen hallelujah but what about those saints that knew that Jesus was coming they were dedicated channels they waited there amen in that temple day and night looking for Jesus how did they know he was there somebody had been talking to God and God had given them some secrets that nobody else knew oh oh praise God and when that child came through that man who couldn't see with the natural I saw him approaching maybe it was just his cry I've heard that cry before whatever it was he walked over to marry him again the prophesy you understand me what was it dedicated then afterwards you know like I forgot who who who gave that testimony said you know that that brother Simeon testified all the time the Lord then showed me he's coming to the temple and I'll be there and no doubt they had done heard that testimony time and time again but one day the testimony became real the reality of his vision or dream became real you understand me so that's what I'm saying as long as you testify of who you are I am bride you understand me I don't have to figure it out he told me I am he gave me that revelation oh you said what Brotherhood if you've got the revelation why aren't you where you should be who's to say I'm not I'm called to be bride he didn't call me to be a prophet you see what I'm saying because everybody feel like when you bride you supposedly raised in the day know is in the body but it's only elected those who have been chosen to pray for those to raise the dead everybody wasn't called to be healers and deliveries but you find your place in Christ and you maintain your position and God will make it happen he'll make things happen supernatural follows every believer one way or another hallelujah Minister true everybody people think well we'll have the spoken word yes we've got it but everybody won't be able to speak not ain't gonna use everybody even if it's a hundred people God ain't not going to give everybody that ability or that people it may have them happy they may have it but God will not call for everybody to be speaking it's given to those who he had ordained to do it come on somebody it is the truth all those disciples every one of them 12 of them and every one of them had different gifts and different abilities it was only a few you constantly heard of some of them moved into the crowd and you never heard about him ever again but I guarantee on the other side you hear the stories of victory I don't care if nobody ever see what's going on in my life as long as he does you understand me to see me get victory amen what's the man called die aqua fees that's whatever you never heard much of him he only spoke God spoke of him one time and how that he had the faith of God a man when his name wasn't written nowhere else I think in the church age book is brought out God knows your name hallelujah and he knows the faith in which you hold praise the name of the Lord he needs a dedicated channel he needs somebody to say oh god this body of mine is yours my eyes are yours my tongue is yours my mind is yours everything about me is your god dedicate this temple hallelujah to your glory that's what he wants dedicate this temple it's amazing when you can come to a place where you're so caught up in God you just speak what he wants you to speak and you say what do you want you to say regardless to the opposition that it may cause or the stir or whether people I was at that funeral I said if you want to shoot me that's okay I'm not skirt and that's the truth cuz I don't love life like that you understand me and no doubt some of them people probably wanted to stone me but the law hold nobody wants to go to jail it was okay because you know what I was working with the song you know what I told them I said won't you I want y'all to understand I love all of you and the Lord flooded the place if hallelujah Wow because everybody wants to know if you listen a child don't even mind being rebuked when they know you love their you know and I came to those people in a spirit of love I said I'm telling you something that your preachers ain't gonna tell you but you only get one chance at this right all those preachers were man it meets somebody yelled something at me after the funeral I'm walking down now and somebody killed so I wouldn't even look all that says Lord forgive them yeah because it ain't me it wasn't me you know they were mad at the word that was preached that wasn't me that was God you know I want one thing for certain I try and I ask God to help me because I'm gonna tell you something in my earlier Christian walk I didn't witness to people like I should have some of those people died without knowing the truth that's something really bad to hold in your conscience and knowing that you you tried to tell them what you feared if you told them everything they wouldn't like your reject you whatever the circumstances were but when they die you realize it was worth it you should have said what you needed to say you understand me maybe some of y'all having witnessed that but I have and that's a horrible feeling when somebody died on you and you fail to tell them the truth I even tell my children I said even if you're not gonna live it you ought to tell them the truth tell them where they can be saved you understand me let's go on see God has a man stationed in the tabernacle I like the Hat you know when in the message Amen toddler seat suddenly the secret catching away you know the prophet of God talked about the girl Amen who who who was chosen by the ranch's son but what the girl wasn't aware of is that God has stationed a man in that place to watch her that's what people don't understand you have angels watching you there's someone station to watch every move you make and they are reporting back to God what you're doing whether you're becoming more like him or less like him he's getting the reports you understand me amen and guess what when God had a uh uh and I like this for this that this thing he said now you you've been a slave a long time and sometimes it makes us feel like that right but you were those true genuine believers we do we become slaves for Jesus Christ hmm Paul described he says I am a prisoner that means I have no rights I can't do what I want to do I can't go where I want to go I can't say what I want to say I'm a prisoner I'm a slave a love slave to Jesus he said you've been a slave a long time and I've watched you I've had the man standing there to see what kind of a girl you was going to turn out to be but I see that you kept yourself he said at the spare the moment see that's how the rapture come when a time you least expect it at the spur of the moment he shows up that's how he is at the spare the moment God shows up hallelujah how many y'all have ever had God throw a roadblock in your way in your mind you allow Satan to put evil in your mind and you have every intention to do it and God throw a roadblock in your way and you walk away and you say thank you Jesus hallelujah if you never been there before ah hallelujah and when I see God do it just make you wanna cry cause you didn't have the power to protect yourself but he protected you oh jesus help me Lord think about it that pillar fires in you this is what God will see that pillar of fire you know there is no way that you like I said become a stay on Christian with the Holy Ghost on the inside how can that be that's the same Shekinah glory that kept amen all those all that those years after I just for a long time how did that bread last forever like that hundreds of years Israel work with that bread that Brent was always French Bob because it was a certain kind of glory that kept it fresh it was God kept it fresh and as long as you stay in the presence of God you'll remain a fresh Christian not some stale and molded bread hallelujah huh you always have life to give hallelujah Tama the image of the invisible God that's where God wants us God wants us to be the his housing he wants us to be the image the image of his himself you can't see him but then Jesus said you know to Philip how can you say when you when you show us the father said when you see me you see the father that's the kind of Union God wants is that right that's the kind Keyes's pray father I want that kind of Union that you had with me to be in them that one day they'll be able to see when you say when you see me you see Jesus they have died and rotted so much to themself all they got left is Jesus that sounds hard it sounds like it difficult but there is there anything too hard for God you don't know how to surrender ask God teach me how to surrender Lord give me grace like I said this morning every sin that we do is based upon selfishness I'm not talking about the kind that comes suddenly and it's called you to do something but most of it most of the things we do is already thought about we call that iniquity and he died even for that Christ in you the hope of glory is that right we must and I'm closing we must allow God to rent every veil tear every veil of the flesh veil lust veil every veil that seemed to hold us in prison we must rip it apart that Christ may be seen to us Lord read every their rent you see what I'm saying great mysteries are great and I'm not against that but what good Paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not charity it profits you nothing until we come to a place where we can love our brothers and sisters that we love ourselves and not only that love the angle Doce men who you you know you find difficult to love you've got to love him that's why God put them into your life it's your test not theirs we must love people that don't mix us make us compromise us when we never had God has never asked us to love the sin that they do but we must love them you love the Lord I'm almost done I'm kind of rushing but let me hurry by God's grace listen he died to reveal himself to us and we must die to reveal him to others you understand me we wanted to be where people said well I know that brother's a Christian I know that sister is a Christian I've seen their lives I know I know I've seen him tired I know I seen them tested y'all understand me it's like that woman whose husband was a drunk of the sheath he invited all his friends over says I know we're real Christian here let me go fix me something to eat she goes and they fix him something to eat then when she gets it on the turkey I don't want none of this mess she's definitely wedding an American woman she was an American woman hallelujah I was somewhere and it's true I don't know the whole lyrics of this thing with it was a rock and roll thing on the on the station and in that saga says don't what don't you marry on American walk I said even the world no not America oh I don't know what the whole theory says are you serious but anyhow by God's grace we've realized by now if she'd been born in America and she's a Christian she's no longer American woman you understand me and I'm telling American woman one that not been born again you understand me so anyway we must live we must die to reveal him to others is that right brother and say let us die to the traditions and thing to reveal him to others she is more than just your words everybody could carry this Bible I know some of the most meet some some mean folks if they still live in Apostolic people maybe I shouldn't I said the name but it's true you don't know what you dealing with until you cross the line with them as long as you say Amen yes that's true hallelujah but it's like rubbing a kitten on backwards you want to see the lion come out of it you want to see yes you don't agree with their level ma you don't believe in the next 238 you going to hell and what Scripture what word ever told you that we are born into his body by one spirit and brother Branham says every one of us are cuckoo yeah he said if God gave those Trinitarians the Holy Ghost and gave you one that's the Holy Ghost how can you not fellowship with one another when God has chosen to fellowship with you that's almost a quote verbatim but you know what the thing is we figured that the only way you can get it is this way would then wind it brother branham get his Holy Ghost and what church he belong to he said I didn't join up with none of hallelujah he said I was in the Baptist Church right Missionary Baptist and when they went when when they do our day in women preachers I got up out of there right and he said it's amazing I said I stood in the midst of all of them trying to pull them all together that's what divine love will do you're different but because you're different that don't mean you have a right not to love that which one that one that is different from you hello be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of what your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God and I believe if a man or woman got the true Holy Ghost he will lead them and guide them into truth in this day is what God requires the men this hour is the message of the age and God will lead them to this age by someone something vision whatever but they will come to this if God has ordained them to make a rapture you love the Lord let's just stop here just trying to get us to see that let me say it like this and this is what I meant to say and all that I've said the word must become a voice that walks in the cool of the evening the voice of God walks the voice of God must return to the tabernacle in which it was designed to dwell in and when that voice of God that life that's off of the tapes that Holy Ghost that pillar of fire that Elohim however you want to call him whatever you want to call him the self existing what when he comes he comes into the holy place within your heart and that voice began to walk and go places and you say what are you talk about how did you know I was a parson she said I saw you coming but weren't you supposed to have a briefcase with you say yeah station brother branham uh have you ever heard of William Branham no I haven't but she prayed Lord I'm like that Shunammite woman where's that Elisha a deep call rung the Bell in heaven heaven rung the Bell on earth and began to walk hallelujah he understood me that woman's prayer held a plane up now I know that's true cuz there been times the plane should have been gone and I've even had them say where we've been waiting on you I'm running through the terminal Lord hold a plane over the plane how many times do they hold planes but that day they held it for me huh because that was the will of the Lord to show me that you're able to hold the plane up that same God and still here but until you realize the power and authority that's in you that's why brother ever said like this he said that word after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power he's that that word is a thority authority ain't no good for you if you don't use it but we're so timid with the sword we so timid with the word but when you realize who you are you know you're the boss of the world you're the boss the god and you is the boss you must work it as you the boss you understand me you don't handle things timidly you can say please if you want to you know can you move that chair for me please but you don't have to say please that's your choosing of doing that if John is working for you you say John give me that chair please or John bring me that player chair you don't have to say please you understand me you are the authority of John and John is going to do what you say do it he's gonna get fired so we God is placed in a position right let me ask you a question at what point in time Jesus prayed Lord should I curse this tree at what point in time did Elijah huh it was an inspiration now that did come to him because it when Elijah called for fire from heaven that was an inspiration and you and I must be so tuned and channeled into God so when God want to use us even in the least of things we ought to be available for him let's stand I'm trying to get us to a place where we understand that we're not where we should be and the time is late yeah and as long as we watch everybody else we'll get nowhere that's one thing about a runner he looking at what's happening on either side of him he's looking at the gold and he's moving they tell you whatever you do don't look behind you now there's nothing wrong with listening sometimes you can hear the opponent if you've got good ears that he's coming up on you that means pick up the space pick up the pace but the moment you do this you just thrown you where you've thrown your rhythm off and your timing and just in that little bit of time that God is right behind you can jump in front of you don't look to the left or the right keep your eyes on Jesus keep running Saints when the vision that made clear to you let him that read it run not walk run because understand this vision is going to only last for the appointed time that means it's coming to an end and you and I must understand we must be caught up into the vision in order for the vision to be caught up in us yummy the vision must be caught up in us in order for us to be caught up into the vision that's what I meant so that you can understand by God's grace it's nothing but a few of us everywhere around the world it's just a few but look you're still standing you're still standing and in spite of all that you may feel about yourself the image that we're trying to be formed into are going to be forming - is not the image of isaiah brooks it's the image of jesus christ you love the Lord God is so good to us have decide to follow cheese I have decided to follow Jesus I have decide to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back you have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus up to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back the cross before me the cause people the world [Music] the cause before yes sir the worldly high the cause people the world behind me no turning back no turning back I have decided I head yes apology yes sir to follow Jesus I have decide to follow Jesus no turning back [Music] if none go with me still I will follow with me still I will follow no turning back you can take is over forgive me Jesus oh my you're turning bad let's sing that one again you can take this over you can take this over but give me Jesus Oh forgive me Jesus you can take this forgive me Jesus no turning back no turning back I am I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided hallelujah no turning back no turning this evening that if we set our minds and hearts totally totally on the Lord it's a battle folks our greatest enemy is ourselves you know we can blame it on the devil but it's our own ways we have to fight our own desires that's what makes it so difficult because it's our own desires we have to fight against but God has already given us all we need see that seed in you once it's quickened it will produce Christ in you we just got to keep it fed we got to keep it under the other the inspiration in that Shekinah stay in that prayer life and you know pray for me I need to pray more hello I feel like we can pray and pray and pray and pray and we still need to pray more because the Bible said pray without ceasing but I trust the Lord show them how you've been blessed i I just tried to say it the way he wants me to say it but I tell you what I'm looking at something and I can't explain what I'm looking at but all I can do say it's just I know it's heaven I know the coming of the Lord is not far and I know by God's grace that I'll be a witness to the translation I believe that with all my heart I believe it's just that close and the world is getting ready to crack wide open things are getting ready to fly loose like you've never seen it before and without Jesus there's no way that you you'll be able to make it so I thank God for it's amazing grace for me [Music] I made it oh I once was lost but now I'm found I made it yessuh Hoover Peter [Music] Amazing Grace Amazing Grace how sweet the sound I made it yes ha whoo-hoo I once was lost but now I'm oh I made it ha hey you know I once was lost I once was lost but now about I made it yes uh what was that I was was fine but now I see oh I made it yes a fool singing oh oh yes over and over [Music] oh I
