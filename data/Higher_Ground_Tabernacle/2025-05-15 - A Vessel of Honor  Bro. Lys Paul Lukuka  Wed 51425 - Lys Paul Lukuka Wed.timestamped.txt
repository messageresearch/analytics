[46:27] Amen. The spirit will make us do. Amen.
[46:31] Wonderful things. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:33] We ask, brother.
[46:37] Amen. Sorry about
[46:39] [Music]
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] this. Amen. God bless y'all. Let's just
[46:53] go straight to the word.
[46:55] Thank
[47:00] you. Let's turn to
[47:05] uh second Timothy 2 verse 20- 22.
[47:26] Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 20-
[47:34] 22. And I'll start.
[47:39] But in a great house there are not only
[47:41] vessels of gold and of silver, but also
[47:45] of wood and of earth, and some to honor
[47:49] and some to dishonor.
[48:03] If a man therefore If a man therefore
[48:06] purge himself from these, he shall be a
[48:09] vessel unto honor, sanctified and meat
[48:12] for the master's use, and prepared unto
[48:15] every good work.
[48:27] Let's go to Psalm chapter 19 verse 9 to
[48:31] 11.
[48:45] The Bible reads, "Wherewith all shall a
[48:48] young man cleanse his way by taking heed
[48:51] there to according to thy word.
[48:55] [Music]
[49:00] With my my whole heart have I sought
[49:02] thee. Oh, let me not wander from thy
[49:05] commandment.
[49:09] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[49:12] might not sin against thee.
[49:17] May the Lord add a blessing to the
[49:19] reading of his word. We may we may bow
[49:20] our head
[49:23] and if you have a need, if you want God
[49:24] to speak to you, just raise your hand.
[49:28] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we humbly
[49:30] come before
[49:33] you in the wonderful name of our Lord
[49:35] Jesus Christ.
[49:38] Heavenly Father, Lord, the Bible says
[49:39] that God is a spirit and they they that
[49:42] worship him must worship him
[49:46] [Music]
[49:49] in Jesus. In order for us to please you,
[49:52] we have to get in the spirit.
[49:56] Lord, I pray that you help each and
[49:57] every one of us to get away from this
[49:59] world and all the wor the worries of
[50:01] this world and get into the spirit of
[50:03] Christ.
[50:05] [Music]
[50:08] so that Father Lord we may receive your
[50:11] word. Jesus, I pray that you forgive us
[50:13] of our shortcomings.
[50:16] [Music]
[50:17] And I pray that you bless each person
[50:19] that came to to your house tonight, Lord
[50:24] Jesus, and that you give them a double
[50:26] portion, Lord God, of whatever they
[50:28] need, Lord Jesus.
[50:32] Lord, I I surrender myself to you, Lord
[50:35] Jesus. Recognizing that it's not me, the
[50:37] preacher, but it's you.
[50:40] Lord, I myself cannot do anything, Lord
[50:42] Jesus. I fully depend on you,
[50:46] Lord. Will you come and help me, Lord
[50:50] Jesus? Give me
[50:52] strength. And I pray that you're here
[50:54] through the
[50:56] congregation and that you bless the word
[50:58] that we just read.
[51:01] In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. I
[51:04] pray, Father Lord, that I rebuke every
[51:06] spirit of unbelief out of this
[51:09] place. And I pray that faith may arise
[51:11] in this
[51:13] room. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[51:17] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have
[51:20] your seats.
[51:23] I don't know how I'm going to preach
[51:24] this.
[51:26] I am I'm very tired tonight
[51:31] but I pray I trust that God is going to
[51:33] give me strength
[51:37] and I appreciate each I appreciate each
[51:38] and every one of you coming on a
[51:40] Wednesday night. I'm sure some of you
[51:41] are tired of coming from
[51:45] home. God doesn't have any depth of
[51:48] anybody. He will give you a double
[51:51] portion for
[51:56] blood. So let's get straight to the
[51:58] word. I'm I'm going to give a short ex
[52:01] exhortation
[52:04] tonight. Um title a vessel of honor.
[52:10] And if you can please turn my mic up a
[52:12] little bit. I cannot really.
[52:14] [Music]
[52:16] So a vessel of honor.
[52:19] So as we if we go back to second Timothy
[52:22] chapter 2 verse
[52:34] 20-22 So we see that Paul is giving an
[52:37] advice to Timothy who is a young man
[52:44] telling him that in a great house that
[52:46] there are not only vessels of go of
[52:48] honor but also vessels of of
[52:53] dishonor. So in other word he's telling
[52:56] us that God has vessels of honor and
[52:59] vessel of
[53:04] dishonor because we understand that even
[53:06] the devil works for
[53:08] God because the devil was created for
[53:11] God for a purpose.
[53:16] The prophet said that God allowed sin to
[53:18] get in the camp so that we will he he
[53:20] would manifest all his attributes.
[53:26] We see that even in the story story of
[53:28] Job. The devil cannot even touch you
[53:31] without getting permission from
[53:36] God. That's why the Bible says that all
[53:38] things works for good to them that love
[53:41] God. Because even when you think things
[53:44] are going wrong, he's still working
[53:45] towards the good the good for them that
[53:47] love
[53:49] God. You know, I was just reading in the
[53:51] room the story of Jonah.
[53:55] And I just noticed for the first time
[53:57] that in the story of Jonah, you see that
[53:58] when he was in the
[54:02] boat, the Bible says that all when the
[54:05] temp the uh the tempest came, everybody
[54:08] started praying their own god.
[54:13] So we had people there that were hidden.
[54:15] They were
[54:18] pagans. And you might think that Jonah
[54:20] was out of the will of God, but God had
[54:22] a purpose for Jonah to do
[54:26] that. Because I saw that in that verse
[54:29] it says that that when when they find
[54:31] out that Jonah was uh the reason why the
[54:34] tempest came,
[54:38] the Bible says that a great fear of God
[54:40] came upon
[54:43] them. They say that they exceeding
[54:46] exceedingly became fearful of
[54:51] God and the Bible says that they made a
[54:54] vow unto the God of Jonah.
[54:58] So while Jonah thought he was out of the
[55:00] will of God, God knew that Jonah had to
[55:02] go against what God told him to go so
[55:05] that those people will be
[55:15] saved. What I want you to say is that a
[55:17] Christian I cannot really say it like
[55:19] that. I don't mean to say that you're
[55:21] never out of the will of God. But I'll
[55:22] say that even when you think you're out
[55:24] of the will of
[55:26] God, there is still a purpose that God
[55:29] is doing in your
[55:31] life. Because the prophet tells us that
[55:33] the Bible these are the shadows and
[55:37] types and if God can do it for them, he
[55:40] can do it for you
[55:41] too. Because if Jonah had just went
[55:44] straight to to
[55:47] Nineveh, those people would have never
[55:48] known about the God of
[55:51] Israel. You know, when the when trouble
[55:53] came in, they asked Jonah. They're like,
[55:55] "Tell us who are you? Where did you come
[55:57] from? Who do
[56:02] you There's there there are many people
[56:05] when trouble comes in your life, that's
[56:06] an opportunity to witness to someone
[56:08] even at the hospital.
[56:16] So that's just a thought for the site. I
[56:18] haven't I haven't started. I just
[56:20] thought I'll share it.
[56:22] So talking about a vessel of honor and
[56:27] dishonor. So I looked at the definition
[56:29] of honor. It means something of higher
[56:32] respect or great esteem.
[56:38] And some of the synonym for the word
[56:40] honor is glory.
[56:43] [Music]
[56:44] You know, so in other word, God is
[56:46] looking for a vessel or an instrument or
[56:48] a person that brings great respect to
[56:51] his
[56:59] name. Someone that everywhere where you
[57:01] go to, everything you do brings respect
[57:03] to the name of God.
[57:09] at work where wherever you work,
[57:10] wherever in in the in the supermarket,
[57:12] yo, even your presence brings respect to
[57:15] the to the name of
[57:19] God. Someone that people can be doing
[57:22] sin, but the moment they see you, they
[57:23] stop because they have the respect for
[57:25] the presence of God in their life.
[57:33] But they'll never do it if God is not
[57:35] using that
[57:36] vessel. Remember, you're not doing it.
[57:39] It's God that has to use the
[57:41] vessel. The problem is we try to do it
[57:47] ourselves. And you'll always end up
[57:49] failing.
[57:51] end up trying to be a better Christian,
[57:53] but you end up always end up
[57:56] failing. You have to do it
[57:59] yourself. So my my topic for tonight is
[58:02] a vessel of honor because I believe God
[58:04] is looking for vessels of
[58:08] honor. When we read this, I don't
[58:10] believe that you are choosing to be a
[58:12] vessel of
[58:15] dishonor vessel of dishonor is anything
[58:18] that brings reproach to the name of God.
[58:26] The prophet preach the message is your
[58:28] is your life worthy of the gospel.
[58:33] When your life is not worthy of the
[58:34] gospel, it's being a a vessel of this
[58:39] horn. So you need to examine yourself
[58:43] tonight whether you find yourself being
[58:45] a vessel of honor or dishonor.
[58:51] So why does God need vessels?
[58:55] He can he God can just do he could do
[58:57] everything himself.
[58:59] So why does he need
[59:02] vessels things he can do anything he
[59:05] wants but the Bible tells us that God is
[59:08] a
[59:10] spirit tells us that spirits don't have
[59:14] hands. Spirits don't have
[59:16] eyes. You know they God sees through
[59:19] your
[59:21] eyes where the prophet says God sees
[59:23] visions through your
[59:26] eyes through your hands.
[59:30] In the message we would see
[59:34] Jesus the prophet says he doesn't have
[59:37] any hands but
[59:42] ours. He doesn't have any voice on earth
[59:44] but ours.
[59:47] The world want to hear the voice of of
[59:50] God. The Bible is telling us the world
[59:52] will only hear the voice of God
[59:56] through. They're not going to hear the
[59:58] the voice of God through to through
[1:00:00] people in the
[1:00:02] denomination. Because we see in
[1:00:04] revelation that they have put Jesus out
[1:00:06] of the out of the
[1:00:10] door, but they are not worshiping God.
[1:00:17] You know, but how the prophet says he
[1:00:20] doesn't have any voice on earth but
[1:00:23] us.ph knows
[1:00:27] that this
[1:00:29] question knew before coming to church
[1:00:31] that God doesn't have any other
[1:00:36] voice powerful
[1:00:39] statement that in order for God to
[1:00:41] speak, he has to speak through us.
[1:00:46] You have a part to
[1:00:49] play. You know, God is a spirit.
[1:00:53] The prophet says, "You mean some of you
[1:00:55] don't know
[1:00:59] that?" If you could project that, that
[1:01:01] would be
[1:01:02] nice. The prophet says, "I am the vine.
[1:01:04] You are the
[1:01:07] branches." The vine doesn't bear fruit.
[1:01:11] He energizes the branches.
[1:01:14] The branches bears fruit.
[1:01:18] You know the prophet says he we lay we
[1:01:21] lay our hands on the
[1:01:24] sick. He uses our eyes to see
[1:01:29] visions. He uses our lips to
[1:01:33] speak. He uses us to pack the gospel.
[1:01:40] See, it's given unto his church
[1:01:44] and he is in his church manifesting
[1:01:48] himself and the people can see him as he
[1:01:52] works in his
[1:01:54] church. The prophet is saying the people
[1:01:57] can see him but how do they see him
[1:02:02] is so the question is why does God need
[1:02:06] vessels?
[1:02:10] A vessel is something that you can
[1:02:12] use for something to be of honor. It has
[1:02:15] to be of good
[1:02:19] use vessels to pack the gospel.
[1:02:28] We are God is God wants to use each and
[1:02:31] every one of you tonight to pack the
[1:02:32] gospel
[1:02:36] of what is the
[1:02:38] gospel. You know in Mark 16:14 to
[1:02:43] 18
[1:02:44] says the Bible says later later he
[1:02:48] appeared to the 11 as they sat at the
[1:02:50] table.
[1:02:55] You have their unbelief and hardness of
[1:03:01] heart because they did not believe those
[1:03:04] who had seen him after he had
[1:03:11] risen the fact that they did not believe
[1:03:13] the witnesses of the
[1:03:18] resurrection. He said to them, "Go into
[1:03:21] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:03:23] every
[1:03:27] creature. He who believes and is
[1:03:30] baptized will be
[1:03:34] saved. But he who does not believe will
[1:03:37] be
[1:03:39] condemned. These signs will follow those
[1:03:42] who
[1:03:45] believe in my name. They will cast out
[1:03:48] demons.
[1:03:50] They will speak with new tongues.
[1:03:52] They will take up
[1:03:54] serpents. And if they drink anything
[1:03:56] deadly, it will it will by no means hurt
[1:04:04] them. They will lay hands on the sick
[1:04:06] and they will
[1:04:10] recover. That's what the gospel is is
[1:04:12] manifesting the power of the risen God.
[1:04:17] But there are signs that that got to
[1:04:19] follow the the
[1:04:22] gospel. You cannot just say you are a
[1:04:24] believer and the signs aren't following
[1:04:27] you. Remember the Bible didn't say that
[1:04:30] the believer follows the
[1:04:36] sign. But there's only one thing that
[1:04:38] you got to do is just you got to
[1:04:41] believe because with faith with faith
[1:04:43] God has to come on the scene.
[1:04:48] Brother Brandham says that all the
[1:04:49] mighty works that he did, it was never
[1:04:51] him. It was God who did that.
[1:04:58] And that scripture applies to you too.
[1:04:59] If you believe the signs will follow
[1:05:03] you,
[1:05:06] whe you don't just need a minister to
[1:05:08] lay hands on you.
[1:05:13] If you are a vessel of honor, God can
[1:05:15] use your
[1:05:19] hand. When you go to work, someone falls
[1:05:22] fall has a heart
[1:05:25] attack. You don't need to wait till 911
[1:05:28] gets
[1:05:30] there. You may be the only light that's
[1:05:33] in that
[1:05:34] workplace. And that may be the reason
[1:05:36] why God put you there. So you can let
[1:05:38] them know that Jesus rose from the dead.
[1:05:45] That's the purpose of the
[1:05:47] gospel. The gospel has to be alive. He
[1:05:50] has to be
[1:05:51] manifested. The Bible says the word
[1:05:58] healeth. I'll read a quote from the
[1:06:01] prophet message earnestly contending for
[1:06:03] the faith.
[1:06:09] He said, "We've had plenty of passing of
[1:06:14] tracks." Um, passing of tracks like
[1:06:21] this. We've had plenty of passing out
[1:06:24] tracks and theology around the
[1:06:28] world. We've had plenty of people
[1:06:30] passing out Bibles, message books around
[1:06:32] the world.
[1:06:37] But the the prophet says but the gospel
[1:06:39] is not the Bible
[1:06:45] altogether. Paul said the gospel came to
[1:06:48] us not in word
[1:06:53] only. But through demonstrations of the
[1:06:56] Holy
[1:06:59] Ghost Jesus says go into all the world
[1:07:02] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:07:08] explanation from the prophet who he is
[1:07:10] straight from
[1:07:12] God. He's explaining giving us an
[1:07:15] interpretation of that
[1:07:17] scripture. He meant go into all the
[1:07:20] world and demonstrates the power of
[1:07:26] God. Oh, that scripture was never meant
[1:07:28] to say go into all the world pass
[1:07:33] message. Even though that is
[1:07:36] good, Satan does not really care about
[1:07:39] that. But there's only one thing that
[1:07:44] he can take this book and make it
[1:07:48] leave. That's what the gospel is.
[1:07:52] The gospel is proving that Jesus rose
[1:07:54] from the dead.
[1:07:58] But you cannot just even even in sales
[1:08:01] for instance,
[1:08:03] you cannot just go try to to uh convince
[1:08:06] a customer to buy your
[1:08:08] product without showing him what that
[1:08:11] product
[1:08:13] does, demonstrating to him what that
[1:08:16] product
[1:08:18] does. We used to be a salesman going
[1:08:20] from house to
[1:08:23] house demo of the
[1:08:27] product and we are also salesmen of the
[1:08:30] gospel.
[1:08:33] We but this is a sales that we give for
[1:08:36] free.
[1:08:39] No free given to everybody that will be
[1:08:44] but it has to be
[1:08:47] demonstrated. There will come a time in
[1:08:49] your life Satan will try
[1:08:53] you. You know it's one thing to say I
[1:08:55] believe the message but Satan will try
[1:08:57] that
[1:09:00] faith. You know the prophet says that
[1:09:02] before God gives you the Holy Ghost, he
[1:09:04] compares that to that that wagon.
[1:09:10] That thing that thing has it has to be
[1:09:12] tested.
[1:09:15] God will have to test you
[1:09:17] first to see if you truly
[1:09:21] believe. That's what the gospel
[1:09:24] meant. And keep reading the same quote
[1:09:26] he
[1:09:27] says. And in order to preach the gospel,
[1:09:31] Before you can make it a gospel preach,
[1:09:37] you've got to have the power and
[1:09:39] demonstration of the Holy Spirit to
[1:09:41] prove the
[1:09:44] gospel. So according to prophet, you
[1:09:46] cannot say that Jesus
[1:09:51] heals that. But when sickness comes
[1:09:55] before you, you are defeated.
[1:10:02] You've got to experience that yourself
[1:10:04] first before you tell that to the
[1:10:11] people because people out there in the
[1:10:14] world they don't really care to I I even
[1:10:16] read a quote today where the prophet
[1:10:17] says Satan can preach
[1:10:22] you. So the secret is never in the
[1:10:26] preaching because the prophet says Satan
[1:10:28] can you can never outreach
[1:10:32] Satan but the secret is in the spirit
[1:10:35] the life that's in the word of God
[1:10:38] because Satan will only quote the
[1:10:43] theories. Satan knows all the quotes of
[1:10:46] this
[1:10:48] message. You know the quotes of the
[1:10:50] message won't do nothing if you don't
[1:10:51] apply that in your life.
[1:10:56] And you applying the message is what the
[1:10:58] gospel came
[1:11:03] for. You know the the message came to
[1:11:06] you know uh to give life. You know
[1:11:10] because if you notice throughout the
[1:11:11] ages Satan tried to kill that
[1:11:15] seed. Even in the church age book you
[1:11:17] can see that the light is going dimmer.
[1:11:24] But the message came to speak your dry
[1:11:26] bones into
[1:11:32] existence. But God sent some someone who
[1:11:35] was yielded as a vessel of
[1:11:40] honor. The prophet says the letter
[1:11:42] kaleth the spirit maketh alive.
[1:11:47] So it's not just a
[1:11:49] realist ritualistic affair
[1:11:54] and I want to highlight on that word but
[1:11:56] it's absolutely a
[1:12:02] reality living realy reality of the
[1:12:06] resurrection of Jesus Christ living
[1:12:08] among
[1:12:14] men and that's It's the faith that I'm
[1:12:16] trying my best to contend for
[1:12:20] today that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:23] yesterday, today, and
[1:12:29] forever. Not just in
[1:12:31] words,
[1:12:33] demonstration. I want to see that if
[1:12:35] Jesus Christ healed someone back in the
[1:12:38] Bible, I want to know that when I get
[1:12:40] him, he can heal me.
[1:12:44] Jesus delivered the maniac in the
[1:12:47] Bible. I want to know that when I get
[1:12:50] blood, Jesus can still
[1:12:53] deliver. Why? Because he has not
[1:12:56] changed. And we need to be able to
[1:12:58] demonstrate
[1:13:00] that. And God wants to do it, but he's
[1:13:04] looking for
[1:13:05] vessels. He's looking for people that'll
[1:13:07] be saying, "Lord, use me.
[1:13:11] God want to show in this city of De
[1:13:13] Moine that he's still the
[1:13:15] same. A lot of people preach a
[1:13:18] dead people preach theories. They preach
[1:13:23] history. The the true seed of God is
[1:13:25] looking for a God that will be
[1:13:28] preaching history.
[1:13:36] I like that word reality.
[1:13:38] This is not something that we're
[1:13:41] imagining. It's something that's real
[1:13:43] that you've
[1:13:46] experienced. Amen. Uh I trust that each
[1:13:50] person
[1:13:52] tonight has a real experience with God
[1:13:57] where it's no longer the God of brother
[1:14:01] Brandham where it's no longer the God of
[1:14:03] of of Lee
[1:14:05] Paul but it becomes your own
[1:14:08] God. You know where you you get to a
[1:14:11] place like like Ruth and
[1:14:13] Naomi where the God of Naomi becomes the
[1:14:16] God of Ruth.
[1:14:19] You know the the the we we getting very
[1:14:22] close to the end. All the prophecies are
[1:14:25] getting
[1:14:27] fulfilled. Examine your lives. Have you
[1:14:29] met the God of this
[1:14:35] message? The prophet says that's what
[1:14:38] the gospel is.
[1:14:42] His power is unlimited.
[1:14:47] How many believe that
[1:14:50] his power is unbelie unlimited?
[1:14:54] There's nothing my God cannot do.
[1:14:58] But you need to we need to see that.
[1:15:01] Many people say God there's a song that
[1:15:04] says uh he's a way
[1:15:08] maker. Many people sing that song. They
[1:15:10] even get in the
[1:15:12] spirit. But when trouble comes in their
[1:15:15] way,
[1:15:16] It truly proves that it was just in the
[1:15:18] head.
[1:15:20] It truly proves that it was never an
[1:15:22] experience to
[1:15:24] them. But you are the children of the
[1:15:27] light. The light is the word
[1:15:33] manifested. What does manifest mean?
[1:15:35] That means it's been made real.
[1:15:42] God is more real than than you can see
[1:15:44] right now.
[1:15:50] You know again my t my topic is ve a
[1:15:53] vessel of honey.
[1:15:56] God is looking for people that he can
[1:15:58] manifest his word
[1:16:03] through. The Bible says verily verily I
[1:16:05] say unto
[1:16:07] you he that
[1:16:10] believeth the works that I do shall he
[1:16:13] do also.
[1:16:15] and greater works than these shall he
[1:16:17] do.
[1:16:20] Because I go unto my father. So we
[1:16:23] understand that the
[1:16:24] believer, the person that we just read
[1:16:26] in Matthew 16, the believer who believes
[1:16:29] the gospel has a job to
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] do. It's a work for each and every one
[1:16:35] of us.
[1:16:37] This work never works.
[1:16:43] I I was reading that that the that the
[1:16:45] that scripture. I have it somewhere
[1:16:46] here. I was reading that
[1:16:48] scripture where Jesus uh said that pray
[1:16:51] that the pray to the Lord of the harvest
[1:16:53] to send more workers.
[1:17:00] You know why Jesus said, you know, if
[1:17:02] you read a few verses before that,
[1:17:03] you'll see that he the Bible says that
[1:17:05] he felt compassion that there were too
[1:17:07] many people without
[1:17:09] shepherd
[1:17:13] scattered. And it was only one
[1:17:17] Jesus. But that's why he said pray that
[1:17:20] I will send my spirit.
[1:17:24] You notice the true workers will have
[1:17:26] the spirit of God on
[1:17:29] them. There are many people come and
[1:17:31] claim themselves to be Christ.
[1:17:35] They claim to cling to to be Jesus. They
[1:17:38] claim to be
[1:17:39] Messiah. But the Bible says by their
[1:17:41] fruit you shall
[1:17:44] know. Our prophet told us to stay with
[1:17:46] the word.
[1:17:50] So Jesus now is looking for workers.
[1:17:53] people that that we and notice my my
[1:17:57] emphasis is Jesus is looking for workers
[1:17:59] that can show that God is alive.
[1:18:05] People that have an experience with
[1:18:08] God if you don't if you've never had a
[1:18:11] single experience with God that God is
[1:18:13] not going to use
[1:18:17] that. That will not convince anybody out
[1:18:19] there.
[1:18:22] to someone about a living God when you
[1:18:23] don't even know if God
[1:18:26] is then you
[1:18:29] just then you are the prophet says you
[1:18:31] are an
[1:18:33] actor the prophet says many people come
[1:18:35] to church and they believe that Jesus is
[1:18:37] God just because the minister
[1:18:43] preach the prophet says even many people
[1:18:45] believe that just because they read it
[1:18:47] in the
[1:18:49] Bible many People believe that Jesus is
[1:18:52] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[1:18:54] just because brother Bham said
[1:18:59] that you know, but but if you've never
[1:19:02] experienced that he is the same
[1:19:04] yesterday, then you are just an
[1:19:08] actor that means you haven't received
[1:19:10] the
[1:19:13] gospel. You receive that Jesus passed
[1:19:16] away.
[1:19:18] How do you know that you you will
[1:19:21] continue to do the same work that
[1:19:24] I will
[1:19:30] do. Amen. Amen. So, let me skip. I'm
[1:19:33] going a little bit too slow.
[1:19:38] I think I just read this one already.
[1:19:40] Um, so yeah, uh, the Jesus talked about
[1:19:42] that there are only few laborers.
[1:19:49] And and then the prophet tells us that a
[1:19:51] scripture can have compound
[1:19:55] meaning this could be
[1:19:57] ministers but he
[1:20:01] doesn't every one of of you
[1:20:04] this because Mark 16 wasn't just sent to
[1:20:07] ministers.
[1:20:09] 16 was sent to every
[1:20:11] believer because the Bible says the sign
[1:20:14] shall follow the
[1:20:17] ministers. The Bible says his signs
[1:20:20] shall follow the believer.
[1:20:24] So God is looking for people that he can
[1:20:27] show that the message is right.
[1:20:34] I'll read this quote in the message the
[1:20:35] healing of Gyrus.
[1:20:40] paragraph says, he says, um, uh, in
[1:20:44] other words, pray to me that I will send
[1:20:46] laborers into my
[1:20:50] harvest, which I'm just telling you is
[1:20:53] such a needy
[1:20:58] thing, but part of it lays in the human
[1:21:02] beings. Do you believe that? He says the
[1:21:06] kingdom of God lays within the human
[1:21:10] being. He says God cannot bear fruit of
[1:21:17] himself. He's got to take the
[1:21:20] church. Is that right? He's got to take
[1:21:24] you branches to bear fruit.
[1:21:28] And when your branches are yielded to
[1:21:31] the vine,
[1:21:35] You notice only there's a condition when
[1:21:37] the branch is yielded to the
[1:21:43] vine fruit comes
[1:21:46] forth of fruit of the fruit of the
[1:21:48] spirit coming forth around your
[1:21:51] life. If it's not, check the root.
[1:21:56] Are
[1:21:57] you Are you sure? Are you coming from
[1:22:00] the the the main vine or you coming
[1:22:02] from?
[1:22:07] Who are you yielding yourself to?
[1:22:10] Because if you yield yourself to the
[1:22:12] van, you you can't have,
[1:22:21] you know, he says, "And when you br
[1:22:23] says, you see what I mean? God wants
[1:22:26] your
[1:22:27] hands. He wants your eyes.
[1:22:31] He wants your
[1:22:32] tongue. He wants your
[1:22:35] lips. He wants your ears.
[1:22:39] He wants your hands
[1:22:41] and he wants your feet so he can bring
[1:22:43] forth fruit through you.
[1:22:47] So the prophet is telling us that that
[1:22:49] God's desire is to use
[1:22:58] you. one of
[1:23:00] us. We just read the har the the the
[1:23:04] harvest is plenty.
[1:23:09] The prophet says that as long as God is
[1:23:11] not done with you accomplishing the
[1:23:13] purpose for which you came in this
[1:23:15] earth, Satan cannot take
[1:23:19] you for each and every one of you this
[1:23:21] morning,
[1:23:27] tonight that work is it for the kingdom
[1:23:29] of God for the kingdom
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:37] So how can we become vessel of honors?
[1:23:42] How can we be yielded to God so that he
[1:23:45] can bear fruit to
[1:23:50] us? The answer is in the word because
[1:23:53] the prophet said that every question
[1:23:56] there is there's always an answer in the
[1:23:58] word.
[1:24:01] Let's look at some examples in the
[1:24:04] Bible. There was a prophecy that a
[1:24:06] virgin shall conceive,
[1:24:10] you know, and she shall she she was
[1:24:12] supposed to bear a
[1:24:14] son. There was a prophecy that a virgin
[1:24:17] shall
[1:24:19] conceive. And for so many years, God was
[1:24:23] looking for a vessel that could bring
[1:24:24] that prophecy to pass.
[1:24:29] God was looking for someone that will
[1:24:30] make that prophecy be
[1:24:35] real. And when the angel appeared unto
[1:24:37] unto
[1:24:39] Mary, you know, and the answer she said,
[1:24:42] she said, "Let it be done unto me
[1:24:44] according to
[1:24:46] God." So she did not disbelieve the word
[1:24:49] of
[1:24:52] God. She believed every word.
[1:24:57] She believed pretty much the impossible
[1:25:01] because the prophet says that at least
[1:25:03] you know what was asked of Mary was
[1:25:05] something that was never ever done
[1:25:10] before. We have things that we can't go
[1:25:13] up on. Oh, if God did this for this
[1:25:14] person, he can't do it for me. God had
[1:25:16] nobody to go
[1:25:22] from. But she simply believed the word.
[1:25:27] When you believe the word, that means
[1:25:28] you allow the word to have his work in
[1:25:32] you. When Mary believed the word, the
[1:25:36] word conceived in her, God conceived in
[1:25:41] her. And it applies to you
[1:25:43] too. If you believe the word, you become
[1:25:46] the word.
[1:25:48] When you believe the word, the word gets
[1:25:50] born in
[1:25:53] you and they accomplish the purpose for
[1:25:56] which he was
[1:25:58] sent. Mary had a prophecy. There was a
[1:26:00] prophecy that that had to come to
[1:26:03] passph. But God was looking for a vessel
[1:26:06] of
[1:26:06] heart and he found
[1:26:09] Mary. There's also a prophecy in our in
[1:26:11] our age.
[1:26:16] The prophet says in the message super
[1:26:18] sign
[1:26:23] he says and there will be a bride just
[1:26:25] as certain as I'm standing in this
[1:26:32] pulpit. There will be a bride that is
[1:26:35] washed in the blood of the
[1:26:41] lamb and the lamb will be living among
[1:26:44] them showing super signs of his
[1:26:47] resurrection.
[1:26:55] the lamb will be living among them
[1:26:57] showing that he's still
[1:27:00] alive. You know, he ties back to the he
[1:27:05] showing super signs of what his
[1:27:10] resurrection that's. That's what the res
[1:27:12] the gospel is
[1:27:17] about after
[1:27:19] 2,000 years the same thing he did when
[1:27:21] he was here on earth.
[1:27:27] So there is a prophecy that there will
[1:27:29] be a
[1:27:32] bride will be living among the
[1:27:39] brideph. But there got to be vessels to
[1:27:41] fulfill
[1:27:43] that. There was a prophecy for Mary and
[1:27:46] she said let it be done unto me
[1:27:48] according
[1:27:51] to. So when I see this prophecy, I also
[1:27:54] want to say, Lord, let it be unto you.
[1:27:59] I want to be that
[1:28:03] bride. There was another uh u another
[1:28:07] person that was Isaiah.
[1:28:11] Let's go to Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5.
[1:28:20] The Bible says, "Then said I, woe is me,
[1:28:23] for I am undone,
[1:28:27] because I am a man of unclean lips,
[1:28:31] and I dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:28:33] unclean
[1:28:36] lips. For mine eyes have seen the king,
[1:28:39] the Lord of
[1:28:41] hosts. Then flew one of the saraphins
[1:28:44] unto me, having a live coal in his
[1:28:49] hand, which he had taken with the
[1:28:52] tongues from the
[1:28:55] altar. and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:28:58] said, "Lo, this has touched thy
[1:29:04] lips, and thy iniquity is taken away,
[1:29:08] and that sin is
[1:29:12] purged. And also I heard the voice of
[1:29:14] the Lord saying, Whom shall I send and
[1:29:17] whom will go for for us?
[1:29:23] Then said I here I
[1:29:26] am and he said
[1:29:30] go. So God was looking for a vessel. God
[1:29:34] had a work to do in that
[1:29:36] age. He's saying who shall I
[1:29:39] send. Tonight God is asking who shall I
[1:29:43] send? Yeah. I have a work for each. I
[1:29:45] have plenty of works that needs to be
[1:29:48] done. There is no coincidence with God.
[1:29:52] coincidence that you found yourself in
[1:29:53] the church
[1:29:56] tonight that he wants he has a work that
[1:29:59] you need to do.
[1:30:01] That's not a
[1:30:03] coincidence. That's not a coincidence
[1:30:05] that you are in
[1:30:06] Iowa. It's not a
[1:30:10] coincidence. He's saying whom shall I
[1:30:12] send?
[1:30:14] But you notice that before God could
[1:30:16] send Isaiah, he had to purge him.
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:23] He had to clean his ini to take his
[1:30:25] iniquities away.
[1:30:29] That's the same thing that if we go back
[1:30:31] to Timothy, let's read that
[1:30:35] Timothy chapter 2 verse 21.
[1:30:41] Paul says, "And if a man therefore purge
[1:30:44] himself from
[1:30:47] these, then he shall be a vessel unto
[1:30:50] honor."
[1:30:53] Sanctified.
[1:30:54] Sanctified. So in order to be a vessel
[1:30:57] horner, you got to be
[1:31:00] cleansed, you have to be
[1:31:03] sanctified and made for the master's
[1:31:09] use. So God doesn't just use
[1:31:12] anything. God likes things to be
[1:31:15] clean. The prophet tells us God is a God
[1:31:18] of order.
[1:31:21] He's not going to take a dirty bottle
[1:31:22] and just use it the same way.
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:31] sanctify and then you meet for the
[1:31:33] master's use.
[1:31:36] And once you are made for the master's
[1:31:38] use, then you are prepared unto every
[1:31:41] good
[1:31:44] work. Anytime God calls, I'm
[1:31:49] ready. And now it's when God is looking
[1:31:52] for a vessel, Lord, I'm ready.
[1:31:56] God wants to wake you up at 3:00 a.m. to
[1:31:58] pray, "Lord, I'm ready."
[1:32:02] God want you to drive eight hours to
[1:32:04] just go bless someone. Lord, I'm
[1:32:09] ready. There's a preparation that got to
[1:32:11] be
[1:32:12] made so that when God God likes to find
[1:32:16] people ready,
[1:32:19] you know, Jesus, that's why the Bible
[1:32:20] says the bride made herself ready.
[1:32:27] When God comes, if if he finds you
[1:32:28] ready, not ready, he leaves you
[1:32:33] behind. So when God wants to do
[1:32:35] something for you with you
[1:32:38] and he comes to you and he finds that
[1:32:40] you're not
[1:32:43] prepared. So it is important to be
[1:32:47] ready. You know, I think there's a
[1:32:49] scripture that says that Paul talks to
[1:32:51] Timothy to be ready in season and out of
[1:32:53] season.
[1:33:02] You know, that scripture does not just
[1:33:03] apply to
[1:33:04] Timothy, every one of us that that needs
[1:33:07] to be used as a vessel.
[1:33:13] And then verse 22,
[1:33:16] flee also youthful lust.
[1:33:20] That's how you, you know, we read Psalm
[1:33:22] 119. How does a young man cleanse his
[1:33:25] way?
[1:33:27] The question is, how do I become a
[1:33:29] vessel of honor?
[1:33:33] Lord, you want me to be a vessel of
[1:33:34] honor, but I see your word for me. I
[1:33:36] need to be clean.
[1:33:41] I want to make my ways clean, Lord.
[1:33:43] How you notice that the Bible says that
[1:33:47] I think it's Let's go to Psalm
[1:33:49] 119. And we'll come back to Timothy.
[1:33:52] Psalm 119:9 to 11.
[1:33:58] You know where shall a young man cleans
[1:34:01] his way?
[1:34:05] By taking heed there to according to thy
[1:34:08] word.
[1:34:10] That's how you make yourself. Why?
[1:34:12] Because it's the word that cleans you.
[1:34:16] You know, uh we are washed by the water
[1:34:19] of the word.
[1:34:23] And if you go to the next, the uh uh
[1:34:25] with my whole heart have I saw thee.
[1:34:29] Go to the next verse, please. Thy word
[1:34:31] have I hid in my
[1:34:33] heart that I might not sin against thee.
[1:34:39] Lord, I want to stay clean.
[1:34:42] The key is hide the word of God in your
[1:34:45] heart.
[1:34:47] Because why? When you hide the word of
[1:34:49] God in your heart, no longer fighting
[1:34:51] the
[1:34:52] battle. But it's the word of God in you
[1:34:54] that fights the
[1:34:56] battles. When you hide the word of God
[1:34:59] in your heart, then the scripture that
[1:35:01] says that he that is in you is greater
[1:35:03] than he that's in the
[1:35:05] world. Manifest.
[1:35:07] But if you don't have him inside of
[1:35:11] you, that's why you cannot keep your way
[1:35:14] clean.
[1:35:17] Let's go back to that Timothy verse. So
[1:35:19] 2 Timothy 2:22, flee also youthful
[1:35:24] lust. NIV version I think says to flee
[1:35:27] from youthful desires.
[1:35:34] As young people, we have so many
[1:35:35] desires.
[1:35:38] But the Bible is telling us it's not
[1:35:39] just of out of God to come and help us,
[1:35:41] but we also have to flee from
[1:35:47] it. When temptation of lust come, what
[1:35:50] do you do about
[1:35:55] it? But you notice, you don't just flee.
[1:35:57] Cuz if you flee, it's going to keep
[1:36:01] coming. It doesn't just give up in one
[1:36:03] day.
[1:36:05] You see the story of Delilah and
[1:36:08] Samson. Now if you read that
[1:36:10] story went the first time.
[1:36:20] But if Samson had only
[1:36:24] fled and then the key is but full of
[1:36:29] righteousness, you know. So because
[1:36:31] there's a scripture that also says uh uh
[1:36:34] to overcome evil with
[1:36:39] good. So when the enemy comes, you have
[1:36:42] to do the opposite of what he's telling
[1:36:44] you to do. That's how you
[1:36:47] overcome full of
[1:36:50] righteousness of
[1:36:54] faith with them that call on the Lord
[1:36:57] out of a pure heart.
[1:37:00] So the people you hang around
[1:37:06] matters. When you find yourself battling
[1:37:08] the spirit of worldly music, who do you
[1:37:10] hang out
[1:37:17] around? You notice that Eve had listened
[1:37:21] to everything by one word she left out.
[1:37:29] So you have fled the youthful
[1:37:32] lust. You have
[1:37:33] followed the
[1:37:36] peace
[1:37:38] around. Satan will try all the avenues
[1:37:41] he can to get
[1:37:46] you. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:50] Let's
[1:37:52] see. I'm going I'm not going in order
[1:37:54] with my notes.
[1:38:00] Okay,
[1:38:03] let's So God had given us gifts and
[1:38:08] talent to serve him with.
[1:38:16] God has given us gift and talent.
[1:38:20] But what have you done with them?
[1:38:24] But you notice, let's read the prophet
[1:38:27] says in the message when their eyes were
[1:38:29] open,
[1:38:33] he says gift is not something like you
[1:38:35] take a knife and chop
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:42] something. That isn't a
[1:38:44] gift. The prophet says a gift is to get
[1:38:47] yourself out of the way so that the Holy
[1:38:50] Spirit can use you.
[1:39:00] And that's the only thing I have to do
[1:39:04] is get William Brandham from the
[1:39:08] scene so God can come
[1:39:11] on. That was his gift. But you also have
[1:39:14] a gift. Some of us are piano
[1:39:18] players players leaders.
[1:39:22] mothers, all those gifts that God has
[1:39:25] given us,
[1:39:27] you need to examine that when you do
[1:39:29] that. You notice that a vessel of honor
[1:39:31] is something that gives glory
[1:39:36] to. When you play the
[1:39:39] piano, who are you trying to get the
[1:39:41] glory to?
[1:39:46] Are you trying to give the glory to God
[1:39:48] or you trying to get your own glory?
[1:39:53] And to be honest, if you're truly trying
[1:39:55] to give God the glory, then you need to
[1:39:56] come
[1:40:01] consecrated. In order to be a vessel of
[1:40:03] honor, you need to be
[1:40:06] prepared. You don't just come to church
[1:40:08] just with no
[1:40:11] preparations. The Bible says that the
[1:40:14] best way to come to church is like you
[1:40:16] you start the church from your house.
[1:40:22] And you bring that same atmosphere
[1:40:24] here at
[1:40:29] like song leaders,
[1:40:31] drummers, didn't getting the glory out
[1:40:34] of what we do.
[1:40:37] Means if when I
[1:40:40] preach God doesn't get all the
[1:40:45] glory of
[1:40:47] glory what I'm doing a
[1:40:51] failure because my word can never do
[1:40:54] anything to
[1:40:56] you his word gives
[1:41:01] life the problem is we don't get
[1:41:04] ourselves elves out
[1:41:10] of you know we want we want to get he
[1:41:13] said the problem we want I want to get
[1:41:15] le Paul in the
[1:41:21] way but the when you do it God cannot
[1:41:23] use
[1:41:28] you to be a vessel of honor it has to be
[1:41:30] God operating the gift
[1:41:39] And you notice that there's also a
[1:41:41] vessel of dishonor
[1:41:44] because the prophet says there are two
[1:41:45] spirits that govern. The spirit of God
[1:41:46] and the spirit
[1:41:51] of you see that the prophet is saying
[1:41:53] that we have to be yielded and get
[1:41:55] ourselves out of the way so that God can
[1:42:04] Each and everyone the gift that you have
[1:42:06] Satan is going to go after it.
[1:42:12] If you don't use it for the glory of
[1:42:13] God, Satan will take it for his
[1:42:21] glory. I'll show you a quick video.
[1:42:24] Joshu, brother Josh, can you project
[1:42:26] that?
[1:42:31] This woman was born in a in a in the
[1:42:33] church. I mean, she was raised in the
[1:42:35] church.
[1:42:38] Super talented, very
[1:42:40] talented. Satan didn't give her that
[1:42:44] gift. He gave her that gift.
[1:42:48] The prophet says that Satan just takes
[1:42:50] what God gave you
[1:42:55] and if you you read her story you will
[1:42:57] see that she even said she was born she
[1:43:00] she first song that she ever sang a solo
[1:43:02] was in a
[1:43:06] church but Satan noticed that you know
[1:43:09] Satan even
[1:43:11] come so even when you sing a church he's
[1:43:14] going to hear your talent
[1:43:18] If you're not careful, he's going to try
[1:43:19] to entice you to give it to him.
[1:43:26] And I saw that she was in a class in a
[1:43:30] in a gymnastic class, dancing
[1:43:33] class. And then her teacher noticed her
[1:43:36] singing high pitch for the first
[1:43:40] time. She realized that she had talent.
[1:43:46] And now what did they what would they
[1:43:48] try to do? They'll try to use it for the
[1:43:52] world. She started in the
[1:43:55] church, you know. But she also get into
[1:43:58] a place where now instead of yielding
[1:44:00] her body to God, now she yields her body
[1:44:02] to another
[1:44:09] spirit. Her personality, she's very shy.
[1:44:14] But you know the devil did not pay
[1:44:16] attention about that being shy. He just
[1:44:17] looked, okay, I can use
[1:44:21] that millions of people to hell with
[1:44:24] that. Don't worry about being I will
[1:44:27] help you
[1:44:32] myself. Listen to what she's just a
[1:44:34] quick
[1:44:40] listen if you can unmute the sound.
[1:44:48] Usually when I hear the crowds, when I
[1:44:49] put on my stilettos, um when like the
[1:44:52] the moment right before when you're
[1:44:54] nervous and that other thing kind of
[1:44:56] takes over for you, then Sasha Pierce
[1:44:58] appears in my posture and the way I
[1:45:00] speak. So if you pause, so you notice
[1:45:02] she's saying that you when she gets
[1:45:07] nervous, you know, there's another thing
[1:45:09] that takes over for her.
[1:45:14] She yields to something that she thinks
[1:45:16] that she created that personality
[1:45:18] herself.
[1:45:22] Keep playing.
[1:45:25] Is it like a process that happens too?
[1:45:27] Like you were talking about the high
[1:45:28] heels like once the lashes go on and the
[1:45:30] makeup and all that stuff. It's kind of
[1:45:32] like when I do a movie becoming the
[1:45:34] character once you put on the wig and
[1:45:35] once you put on the clothes you walk
[1:45:37] different. It's kind of this character
[1:45:38] that I've I've created over the years.
[1:45:40] Uh-huh. And how is Sasha Fierce
[1:45:43] different than I am? Well, I know you
[1:45:46] know definitely wearing that bodysuit. I
[1:45:48] can never walk out here and do that.
[1:45:50] Does Sasha ever go home? So, she even is
[1:45:53] telling us that she knows her
[1:45:54] personality and she can never wear those
[1:45:57] body come out in the public like
[1:46:01] that. She's telling us
[1:46:04] that. No, it's a man for the prophet
[1:46:07] says that when you get your body out
[1:46:09] naked there, it's a spirit that over
[1:46:10] you.
[1:46:14] But she's out there telling us that
[1:46:16] that's that she could never do it on her
[1:46:21] own. Um, sometimes,
[1:46:23] [Laughter]
[1:46:27] but not often. Only only on special
[1:46:32] occas Yeah. She shows up sometimes at
[1:46:35] the house. Yes. Yeah. But definitely
[1:46:38] when I'm nervous or or um whenever I
[1:46:41] have to perform, whenever I have to do
[1:46:43] choreography or something that's
[1:46:45] difficult and I it's no different from
[1:46:47] anyone else. I feel like we all kind of
[1:46:48] have that that thing that takes over.
[1:46:50] You can pause there. You can remove the
[1:46:52] video. You see? So you're saying that we
[1:46:54] all have that one that takes over.
[1:47:02] I mean she is
[1:47:04] right but it's it's either the spirit of
[1:47:06] God or it's the spirit of
[1:47:10] sin. I'll give my own
[1:47:13] example before I start preaching. I am
[1:47:16] very very
[1:47:18] nervous. You know you don't know the
[1:47:21] thoughts that be going through my mind.
[1:47:25] Sometimes in the pulpit sometime I'm
[1:47:27] like why did I accept to do this
[1:47:31] thing? I have people that that are
[1:47:34] depending to hear on what I will
[1:47:37] say. I get very nervous before
[1:47:41] preaching because I yielded my body to
[1:47:46] God takes
[1:47:48] over moves that nervously.
[1:47:52] Beyonce who was raised in the
[1:47:55] churchy he yields her body to a spirit
[1:47:58] that she named Sasha
[1:48:02] Fierce and she says that it's that
[1:48:04] spirit that does all the work for
[1:48:08] her talented young girl.
[1:48:12] She has a very beautiful
[1:48:14] voice. That thing that God has given
[1:48:16] you, if you don't protect it, Satan will
[1:48:18] come after that.
[1:48:26] So another example is John
[1:48:30] Legend Legend. Some may know him, some
[1:48:33] some may
[1:48:34] not a singer as
[1:48:37] well. No. So singers, you need to be
[1:48:39] very careful
[1:48:43] with and he said, I'm just going to read
[1:48:46] his quotes where he said, he says, I
[1:48:47] grew up in a pentecostal church in
[1:48:49] Springfield, Ohio.
[1:48:56] And he said, and that was my first
[1:48:58] extensive exposure to music of any sort
[1:49:00] during that time. And it was what
[1:49:02] inspired me to want to sing.
[1:49:09] sit in line with you that God gives you.
[1:49:11] What inspired you? The first place to
[1:49:13] start singing was
[1:49:18] church, you know, and he says, "My
[1:49:21] grandfather was our
[1:49:23] pastor. My grandmother was our church
[1:49:26] organist.
[1:49:28] My mother was the choir director.
[1:49:33] I just grew up around a family full of
[1:49:36] folks who love to sing and love to sing
[1:49:38] about Jesus.
[1:49:43] And in that same place, there's a place
[1:49:46] he says that even one time he even spoke
[1:49:48] in tongues. He spirit.
[1:49:53] So this man grew up in in a good house.
[1:50:00] You know, but there's a place where he
[1:50:03] said it says later in the series, John
[1:50:06] added that despite his reverence for the
[1:50:08] church and it its tradition, he was no
[1:50:11] longer religiously
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:20] active. What happened to him? You know,
[1:50:24] he gave his gift to Satan.
[1:50:27] a God-given
[1:50:30] gift. He yielded his vessel to become a
[1:50:33] vessel of this
[1:50:38] heart. And another popular star, Whitney
[1:50:44] Houston. She is a very she was a very
[1:50:47] talented woman.
[1:50:51] Grew up in the church. I even saw that
[1:50:53] they uh I read about her. I saw that
[1:50:55] every concert that she was doing, she
[1:50:57] always had one gospel song that she was
[1:50:59] doing.
[1:51:05] But she went secular.
[1:51:08] Satan went after that
[1:51:09] gift and then instead of and then the
[1:51:12] kind of death she died, she died because
[1:51:14] of a cocaine addiction.
[1:51:20] That's what Satan will do to you when
[1:51:22] you yield your vessel to him.
[1:51:28] You want to yield your vessels
[1:51:32] to I'll read one more quote and I'll
[1:51:35] probably end there.
[1:51:39] The prophet talks about this woman that
[1:51:41] was called Clara
[1:51:47] Bohem 223.
[1:51:51] He said, "What do you think of Clara?"
[1:51:56] Who come out of the first and said the
[1:51:58] dangerous
[1:52:02] curves that sends thousands of soul to
[1:52:05] hell.
[1:52:10] Where do you think she's she's tonight?
[1:52:13] She's been dead for a long time. Where
[1:52:15] is
[1:52:16] she? That body of hers
[1:52:20] laying yonder, cankered in
[1:52:24] dust. Her soul lays yonder be before a
[1:52:28] just God.
[1:52:33] Where is the man that took that woman
[1:52:35] and made them all dirty looking clothes
[1:52:37] that they put
[1:52:43] on? Why do you wear those kind of things
[1:52:46] for
[1:52:48] because you want men to look at
[1:52:51] you? No other way to prove
[1:52:54] it. And do you know that when you do
[1:52:57] that and some old sinner looks at you,
[1:52:59] you know what happened?
[1:53:03] And I'll skip the pro says you don't do
[1:53:04] that for no good
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:09] purpose. He said you might be innocent
[1:53:11] of the
[1:53:14] fact but the devil is using you for a
[1:53:17] tool just like he did
[1:53:21] Eve. The way you dress at
[1:53:25] church, the way you dress at
[1:53:29] work without you don't even mean it, but
[1:53:31] you are being a tool of
[1:53:37] Satan. You are you are becoming the the
[1:53:41] vessel of
[1:53:44] dishonor because now you are bringing a
[1:53:46] reproach to the cause of Christ.
[1:53:53] God is looking for a vessel to some for
[1:53:56] vessels of honors.
[1:53:59] We have student here from Iowa
[1:54:02] states looking for vessels of
[1:54:05] horns. Iowa states need to hear of the
[1:54:08] message of the hour.
[1:54:11] Iowa God even sent you out
[1:54:17] there. We see that God
[1:54:20] doesn't have hands. He
[1:54:24] has his eyes are your
[1:54:26] eyes. The way you carry yourself in
[1:54:30] college, the way you carry yourself when
[1:54:32] you think there's no one looking at
[1:54:36] you. You may
[1:54:40] stand. Whatever you give to God, that's
[1:54:43] what he will use.
[1:54:48] The prophet says that Samson gave his
[1:54:50] gift of strength to God and he used
[1:54:59] it. But he gave his heart to
[1:55:06] Delilah. There are some of us
[1:55:09] tonight. Yes, God is using you,
[1:55:13] but there's more that he wants to do.
[1:55:18] Lord, I don't want you to just use me as
[1:55:20] a minister.
[1:55:24] Lord, I don't want you to just use me as
[1:55:26] a piano
[1:55:29] player. I don't just want to give this
[1:55:31] gift to God, but my heart I'm giving it
[1:55:33] to the
[1:55:35] world. I want you to take full
[1:55:38] possession of myself.
[1:55:41] Lord, I'm giving myself away to
[1:55:44] you. Full
[1:55:47] control. There's more work that he wants
[1:55:49] to do with you.
[1:55:52] Yes, he will use the little that you
[1:55:53] give
[1:55:55] him. There is more that he wants to do
[1:55:57] with
[1:56:00] you. Paul told us that the choice is
[1:56:04] ours because he says, "If a man
[1:56:06] therefore purge himself
[1:56:12] One more quote. It's not a quote. It's a
[1:56:14] scripture. You can still remain the same
[1:56:17] scripture verse 16. The verse he says,
[1:56:21] "What things is he saying to son from?"
[1:56:23] It says, "But
[1:56:25] profane and vain babblings."
[1:56:31] So the pro in the NIV version says,
[1:56:34] "Godless chatter.
[1:56:39] for they will increase unto more
[1:56:43] ungodliness. Why did I read this is
[1:56:46] because sin comes in in innocent
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:52] form. No, he's talking about just vain
[1:56:55] bablings. But it's in other words, it's
[1:56:56] just a nature of sin. If you don't shun
[1:56:59] from it, it's going to
[1:57:03] keep your ungodliness.
[1:57:09] He started by taking just one sip of
[1:57:12] alcohol
[1:57:17] and now you find yourself in a bar and
[1:57:20] you find yourself you can't go a week
[1:57:22] without
[1:57:24] drinking and now you can't even go a day
[1:57:26] without drinking anymore.
[1:57:30] What? It's sin.
[1:57:32] But when you let God cleanse you,
[1:57:35] He has a word for you like whom I send.
[1:57:42] Lord, here I am. Send me.
[1:57:46] If you can sing a
[1:57:50] song, I give myself
[1:57:57] away. I give myself
[1:58:01] away so
[1:58:03] you can use me. I give myself
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:12] away, oh
[1:58:15] Lord, I give myself
[1:58:19] away so
[1:58:21] you can use me. Sing it with me. I give
[1:58:25] myself
[1:58:28] away. Only sing that if you really mean
[1:58:31] that to God. If you don't mean that,
[1:58:32] don't sing. I give myself
[1:58:36] away so
[1:58:38] you can use
[1:58:42] me. Here I
[1:58:45] am. Here I stand.
[1:58:51] Lord, my
[1:58:53] life is in your
[1:58:58] hands. Lord, I'm
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:03] longing to
[1:59:06] see your
[1:59:10] desires
[1:59:12] revealed in me.
[1:59:15] Oh, I give myself
[1:59:20] away. Oh
[1:59:23] Jesus, I give myself
[1:59:27] away. So
[1:59:29] use and use
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:33] me. My life is not my
[1:59:37] own. To you I
[1:59:42] belong. I give myself I give myself to
[1:59:49] you. Oh my life is not my
[1:59:54] own. To you I
[1:59:58] belong. I give myself I give myself
[2:00:04] away. I'll read this quote before we
[2:00:06] pray.
[2:00:08] The prophet says in the message
[2:00:09] dedication
[2:00:12] He says, "And if we'll come back to the
[2:00:15] original
[2:00:18] dedication and we'll open our
[2:00:21] hearts and empty
[2:00:26] ourselves, God in dedication as we give
[2:00:29] it to
[2:00:32] him will fill our temple with his
[2:00:35] shakina
[2:00:38] glory. If you give your heart to him,
[2:00:42] If you empty yourselves,
[2:00:45] Lord, I want to empty myself tonight.
[2:00:49] Then the living God will be moving in in
[2:00:52] living
[2:00:56] church. He won't be living in a dead
[2:00:58] church anymore. He will be moving in a
[2:01:00] living
[2:01:04] church, a living
[2:01:07] people and will spread forth his glory.
[2:01:13] Then his purpose will be fulfilled of
[2:01:15] you becoming a vessel of
[2:01:18] honor. We
[2:01:21] vess to to bring glory to
[2:01:25] him. Then together someday, one being
[2:01:28] this way and one this way and one part
[2:01:31] of the country, she'll come together to
[2:01:33] make the
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:40] bride and will be caught up to meet
[2:01:44] him. So that's a
[2:01:47] prophet, but God is looking for people
[2:01:49] that will make this come to
[2:01:53] passph. You know the prophet says that
[2:01:55] there are many doors of the heart
[2:01:59] and many of us has let him be our
[2:02:06] savior but we don't want to open another
[2:02:09] room our secret room. We don't want to
[2:02:13] become our lord. Don't tell me
[2:02:18] what some of us still have. We won't let
[2:02:21] him come in the door of pride.
[2:02:31] Some of us is the the door of
[2:02:33] depression.
[2:02:35] Some of us can't. It's you you find it
[2:02:37] so hard to trust
[2:02:39] God. You want to try but you keep
[2:02:42] finding it so difficult to trust
[2:02:46] God. Keep knocking at the door. He wants
[2:02:49] to come in there. He wants to come
[2:02:51] there. It makes everything
[2:02:54] easy that does the work
[2:02:57] in while everyone bowed their
[2:02:59] head. That's your decision. You know,
[2:03:02] you want God to use you more.
[2:03:05] Can you just raise your hand?
[2:03:11] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:03:14] you so much for such a message. Lord,
[2:03:17] telling us Lord that in a house there
[2:03:19] are vessels of honor and dishonor.
[2:03:23] But Lord, I don't believe that any of us
[2:03:25] wants to be a vessel of these
[2:03:29] harmonies. But Lord, the Bible tells us
[2:03:31] that we have to be sanctified and put
[2:03:34] aside for
[2:03:37] service. And the prophet says that
[2:03:39] sanctification only sets you aside but
[2:03:42] doesn't put you in service.
[2:03:47] Lord, the prophet says that the Holy
[2:03:49] Ghost when it comes then he puts you in
[2:03:51] service.
[2:03:54] Lord, we need your Holy
[2:03:56] Ghost. Lord, those of us that have it,
[2:03:58] give them more,
[2:04:00] Lord. And those who don't have it, Lord,
[2:04:03] I pray that you give them an outpouring
[2:04:04] of the Holy Ghost,
[2:04:06] Lord. Heavenly Father, we want to
[2:04:08] continue the works. We want to do the
[2:04:11] greater works, Lord.
[2:04:13] We want to be a vessel of honor.
[2:04:16] I pray that you search our lives,
[2:04:19] Lord. Anything that been there that's
[2:04:21] not pleasing to you,
[2:04:23] I pray that you remove it, Lord Jesus. I
[2:04:26] pray that you cleanse us, Lord God. And
[2:04:28] Father Lord, that you use us more and
[2:04:30] more, Lord Jesus. I pray that you bless
[2:04:33] this
[2:04:34] church. I pray that you reward their
[2:04:37] sacrifice. I pray that father Lord God
[2:04:39] that you shine your life your light in
[2:04:41] their lives like never
[2:04:45] before and let them be witnesses Lord of
[2:04:48] your
[2:04:50] resurrection in the wonderful name of
[2:04:52] Jesus Christ. If there be anybody that
[2:04:54] came in sick, I pray that you give
[2:04:56] them in the name of Jesus Christ. If
[2:05:00] there's anybody that came lacking, I
[2:05:01] pray that you give him more than what he
[2:05:05] needs. In the name of Jesus
[2:05:09] Christ we pray. Amen. God bless
[2:05:27] you. Take
[2:05:30] me to the
[2:05:33] holy of holy
[2:05:38] Take me in by the
[2:05:42] blood of the
[2:05:47] lamb. Take me in to the
[2:05:52] holy of
[2:05:56] holies. Take the cold. Touch my lips.
[2:06:02] Here I am.
[2:06:06] Oh, take me in to the
[2:06:11] holy of
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:15] holies. Take me in by the blood of the
[2:06:22] lamb.
[2:06:24] [Music]
[2:06:25] Oh, take me in to the holy of
[2:06:33] holy. Take the cold. Touch my lips. Here
[2:06:39] I am. One more time.
[2:06:42] Amen. Oh, take me in to the
[2:06:47] holy of holies.
[2:06:53] Take me in by the blood of the
[2:07:01] lamb. Take me in to the holy of
[2:07:10] holies. Take the cold. Touch my lips.
[2:07:15] Here I
[2:07:18] am. Oh, take the cold.
[2:07:22] Touch my lips. Here I
[2:07:29] am.
[2:07:30] Hallelujah. Amen. I trust you were
[2:07:33] blessed. Amen. I was blessed.
[2:07:35] Hallelujah.
[2:07:36] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing. Amen.
[2:07:40] Redeemed.
[2:07:42] Hallelujah. Amen. As we're dismissed.
[2:07:45] Amen. With this song.
[2:07:47] Amen. Redeemed. How I love to
[2:07:52] proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of
[2:07:57] the
[2:07:59] lamb. Redeemed through his infinite
[2:08:04] mercy. His child and forever I
[2:08:10] am
[2:08:13] redeemed. Redeemed.
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:17] Redeemed by the blood of the
[2:08:21] lamb.
[2:08:24] Redeemed,
[2:08:27] redeemed, his child and forever I
[2:08:32] am. I think of my blessed
[2:08:38] redeemer. I think of him all day long.
[2:08:44] I sing for I cannot be
[2:08:49] silent. His love is the theme of my
[2:08:54] song.
[2:08:57] Redeem,
[2:09:00] redeem, redeemed by the blood of the
[2:09:04] lamb.
[2:09:08] Redee,
[2:09:11] redeemed his child and forever I
[2:09:16] am. I know I shall see in his beauty.
[2:09:23] The King in whose law I
[2:09:27] delight, who lovingly guardeth my
[2:09:33] footsteps, and giveth me songs in the
[2:09:38] night.
[2:09:41] Redee,
[2:09:44] redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the
[2:09:48] lamb.
[2:09:52] Redeemed,
[2:09:55] redeemed. His child and forever I
[2:10:00] am. Redeemed and so happy in
[2:10:06] Jesus. No language my rapture can
[2:10:11] tell. I know that the light of his
[2:10:16] presence with me shall continually
[2:10:22] dwell.
[2:10:25] Redee,
[2:10:27] redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the
[2:10:31] lamb.
[2:10:33] [Music]
[2:10:36] Redee,
[2:10:38] redeemed his child and forever I
[2:10:44] am
[2:10:46] redeemed.
[2:10:49] Redeemed, redeemed by the blood of the
[2:10:53] lamb.
[2:10:57] redeemed.
[2:11:00] Redeemed his child and forever I am. God
[2:11:05] bless you.
