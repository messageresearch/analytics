Matthew 13 and we'll also come from Psalms 1 Matthew 13 chapter and we'll read the 23rd verse glad to be in the house of the Lord by God's grace Matt through 13 23 but he that receiveth she's me but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also hid beareth fruit and bringeth forth psalm a hundred fold some sixty some thirty psalms one regaining it the first verse blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and his law doth he meditate both day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper let us pray father we come before you Lord we thank you for the grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father God that you will bless this service strengthen us right now Lord give us grace and mercy father we thank you for everything we pray that you have preeminence here tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seen it I told my grandchildren before coming that if they disrupt the service I'm gonna stop preaching and I'm gonna come and I'm going to discipline you do all you understand that's what I mean so we thank God for His grace we think God for His mercy I just want to give a thought tonight because it was such a blessing to me in the course of my listening to the restoration of the bride tree it was a lot so many things in that message that really it inspired me and encouraged me and and I just kind of God gave me a thought planted in him when we talk about something being planted we normally think about a flowerpot or whatever it may be but but soil ground you plant it in the ground you know especially when you you're planting something to grow that's the definition it means to put or set in the ground for growth as seeds or young trees and and when we plant it something in the ground we expect it to grow we look forward to grow we may even add some fertilizer and whatever it takes for that plant to grow we are expecting whatever by way of seed or by way of a little tree I forgot what they call them like a furling or something that's a little animal or thing but whatever whatever it is that's what we know we try to we do that but when I was thinking about god I just something opened up and and I just I could say like this I can't really grasp it it's just when I saw the vastness of God it was so great that my mind couldn't couldn't couldn't contain you know the thought because God is a spirit and oftentimes God he helps us out by saying you know planted in Christ but if you understand Christ you understand that this is God and you know we realized by God's grace the Bible tells us that there are those who are planted in good ground and the Bible said that they will bring forth a hundredfold 60 and 30 now you got to understand these people who bring forth 30 didn't decide they were going to bring 30 and the people who bring forth 60 did not decide with themselves that they were going to bring 60 and the ones who bring forth a hundredfold didn't decide within themselves that they were going to bring forth a hundredfold you and I must understand that these numbers were determined by God and each and every one of us have a different faith we have the faith of God but our faith is measured and God was the one who measured that faith to you before the foundation of the world I might be able to do something you can't do and you may be able to do something that I can't do for an example we look at brother Branham I would say he brought forth a hundredfold now I don't know what my foe will be compared to what he did throughout his ministry but but but you had to understand he was ordained every seed you know you find out that you know some people when they get married they they they plant seeds and some may bring forth two children and maybe that's all they can bring forth some may bring forth one then you got those who can bring forth ten and on up well those people did not determine that it was God who determined how many children they were going to have now I know we're dealing with modern things now but I'm saying you know back in the olden days when they were really feared God in a way in man perhaps may not have understood a lot of things the way we do now they were one through Warner children and couldn't produce children right but but I say all of that is to say that when we talk about being planted in God how can you not bring forth good fruit how can you not bring forth God how can you not bring forth what you need to bring forth right and you know we look at these things and we must understand by God's grace that we are planted in him and I want you to just meditate just think about that just for a moment we are planted in him all right Psalms one one two three says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful for his but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and I want to say this to you you cannot do that unless it's in you to do it and when it's in you to do it it is not by your own ability right it's by God's ability you and I must understand that God is not let's put it this way properly brother Branham said that he is a gentleman God will give you something but he will never make you do it there must become there must first be a willing mind right and when there's a willing mind and God would bring it to a place where whatever you will to do for him in and his glory he will make that thing happen right now you take for an example it takes faith everybody wasn't a Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin didn't ask for his scientific abilities it was a gift given from God and you know even though his gift was given from God at the time when he first began to do what God wanted him to do he looked totally insane right I think about the men who who literally built the automobile oh my if they could see what things have become now they would really get excited well think about the being who's that thought oh one day we will fly where the gift was in them but it wasn't given to everybody it was given to a certain group of men who caught the vision and they ran with it and guess what God anointed them you see God works with science it is is Satan's perversion but without science how could I sit this way God prophesied and certain things had to become what they are because the word said it would be you understand me God allows Satan amen or however you want to put it God allowed science to - to kind of like parallel itself with the word well the venom talked about the automobile and at the time where I think it was Wesley and all of the ones and in the airplane the Pentecostals and things like that and the horse and a buggy justification you know he goes on and he tells all these inventions ran neck to neck with what God was doing with his church and remember Joel said I shall restore saith the Lord we look at all of these scientific experience things that are happening now and and and and some of us came in grass a lot I used my phone is iPad I have no idea how it works if you try to explain it to me I still would know how it works because there is a supernatural element behind these things that most people don't see they see science but they don't see the supernatural part about it that that man can make an instrument that can literally transfer our data from this end of the world to that end in the world in a matter of seconds it just shows that the rapture is real if data can travel like that we can't do right because that data is just words scientific things that that that men have have allowed to form and shape into what we can a language we can understand and you know it travels and so you and I must understand that when God has planted us I love this I can't explain it I'm seeing something I've never seen before I can't even explain it but I see myself in this gray eat and vast is everything his love his pieces Joyce it's all of that I can't even explain it but I do know one thing in there if a man ever gets in there if he's ever planted in there you'll never die because remember just like water is the source of life for a natural tree God is the source of life or spiritual one and we have been we have been made in the natural image and in the scripture according to Corinthians 15:1 15 tells us that one day we're going to bear the same image but a spiritual image oh my and so we must understand that it is is important to be planted not sprinkled you understand me because prickling may not give you the necessary water you need to grow by but when you are planted that means you are berry you are covered and all of the nutrients of that work that's in that water finds its way into the seed or the life of the seed and it helps that see grow into a mature church a mature tree excuse me is that okay Joshua 24:13 you have to turn he says and I have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which you built not and he dwell in them of the vineyards and olive yards which he planted not do he eat and when I read the spirit judge all of a sudden I be I just got my mind just started thinking about God and all of the many blessings that God he is he you know I saw oh you know you want a house God has one you need a car God has one oh come on somebody everything you need is in God because a car could not be a car if it wasn't for God a house that we know of cannot be a house if it wasn't for God because God is the very creator of all things and if you channel yourself into God that is that how could I say it you draw whatever you need from God into yourself it's amazing what God has already done it's just so amazing that these things are laying right in front of our eyes it's like this dimension that I'm ready to travel through it's right here and I'm seeing that God is right here hallelujah somebody say man God is here first of all he said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the mist and God said I will never leave you nor forsake you he's here and we realized because of the message that probably God said God sees us just like radio waves travel through God is in this place but we forget but you know what all you got to do is keep connected right see electrical wires and outlets and all that you have to be careful how you handle that those things why because you can easily get a shock that could take you out here if you mess around with those wires in the wrong way in other words there's a-there principles there's the laws that goes with electricity and electricity is something that even science to this day cannot explain then I'll have a real definition front for it because they don't know what it is it's alive it's like fire they really don't understand fire fire is alive it's true get so happy when when win-win-win-win-win they they fire walks hmm we may not understand the language but fire talks yeah saw fire leaks it purifies it cleans oh come on because it is it's an element that we can see that we can relate or tie God into God is fire and the Bible said he's a consuming fire right so when we look at these things you and I must understand Amen that God has something that we must understand if we stay planted Romans six one through six says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no II not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death oh we are buried with him by baptism into death let me say that again therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life how can you be planted spiritually in God and not have a new life because the life and death cannot abide at the same time that was the whole thing about Calvary they took life and they tied him up nailed him to a cross him and that cross represented death life and death face to face but they could never abide in the same place he had to come off the cross because he was alive right and they took a Roman tree and tied the word to it you understand me and that's exactly what they've done today they've taken the word in a Roman tree denominations increase hallelujah and they want to pin Jesus down on the cross but I'm here today or tonight to say he's risen and he's alive and well hallelujah Jesus ain't on the cross no more hallelujah that was a cursed thing hallelujah and he was a curse for us you understand me he took our death that we could live now that he's arise he's arisen a menu and I can be planted in him I love this I love this because I see God in a way that I came him explain him I see God amen as everything nothing outside of him he just God and even though God in his own thoughts made what we see this is like a drop in the bucket if we can see how great he is we'd never feel how let me ask you a question if you had cancer and and he was an ocean ocean how can I say Lord our ocean of life and you could just plant your hands into that ocean and you connected and you know life always conquers death how can the cancer ever remain if you are plugged into life hello but my thing is this in your if the roots of your tree it's planted in this water tell me and all of the nutrients of that holy ghost water is not flowing through your roots the roots of your tree how can this tree not live hey because if God could take a dead rod and connect it with the fountain of life beyond behind the cow this should cut in there with the Shekinah glory is and how could that tree ever not bear or bird right it had to there wasn't a choice you see because you said what do you mean let me say it like this Jesus never went to a funeral he never preached a funeral everyone he met the man going down the street the one the girl - haven't all of them when like came hallelujah death had to flee just making that connection with him amen it just it's amazing I believe that if this thing keep growing on what I'm seeing I'm gonna be translated in a little while because there's no way that I could be seeing I can't give me what I'm seeing even now I cannot give this to me I didn't ask this I just asked God to bless the service but I believe with all my heart I mean that's what Jesus could never let's put it this way brother Branham said like that he lied John women to be a servant said Lord it is more than than than us you know and we're surrounded and then Elijah said don't feel because it's more them than you know y'all know what I'm saying and you know but brother then said he said it by faith he didn't see all those chariots but but by faith he did and if that Bible said that the angel the Lord is encamped about us we by faith believe that as though we can touch it because they are they really are here but you know what we let our natural senses dictate to us and your natural sense is not even you this whole body that ain't you if it was you God would take it to heaven hallelujah but nothing nothing this so corrupt be hybrid Amen I don't know what it's all mixed with but I know one thing it ain't nothing but a body of sin is that the Bible pulse at all who's gonna deliver me from this body of sin and death y'all want to call it something else that's what it is and you cannot expect sin and death to offer you holiness it ain't happening right but the real use on the inside of this thing I don't know how God is doing but I know one thing for certain that God intended for us to understand that we are planted in him and when you O Lord let me get that scripture we sometimes fail to see and I'm jumping a little bit but we fail to see there's a time for everything and I love this because you and I when we can see ourselves as being trees then we can understand you're gonna have four seasons in your life you're gonna have a spring you'll have a summer I went to in the fall and all of us know what fall is right that's why the boughs ADA just made fall several taps in a date and he gets up sometime I think I go over a little seven over seven you know what I'm a man this is flash the real me is inside is the only thing and I'm trying by God's grace to kill him every day he is my worst enemy he lies to me and all that you know you know you know he's one of those buddies you wish you could get rid of oh god help us Psalms 92 and 12 I'm coming in that scripture in just a moment I just want to take my time I get excited the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God and when I thought about that as a hallelujah cuz I saw I saw this thing I said now God asked David what house are you gonna build me in other words can I be contained I feel all in all what house will be big enough for me but the Bible says those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the course of our God planted and where is a couple somebody it's God and me guarding yoona and we are in God this God is so powerful brother it meant that he could not only just give me the Holy Ghost but he clothed me I don't understand that that there is a rogue that I'm wearing right now you can't see it but the devil can it's real why do it why is it like that because I am planted probably God talks about the pommel worm the cankerworm the locusts and the caterpillars and you and I we fail to see we're dealing with a four-stage animal devil how do you want to call it worm right and the first thing that thing do is come and he eat your love away he now comes at each oak each Oh praise away eat off your tree and bring you down to a stump y'all understand me and the only pesticide that can get rid of and mr. word it is a word that fortifies us it is a word that keeps us it is the word that makes every devil afraid to come in knock on your door don't you understand worms some of them can sense when sprayed has been sprayed pesticide that's why you get your collard greens and how beautiful and green nothing has chewed on them or anything somehow those bugs know that those greens have been fortified with something that will possibly will not possibly kill this the devil no definitely no joke you know and the devil understands who you are even though you may not know it and people will I don't know why I'm going through this trouble in this net oh my god you better be glad you being tested well if you're not gonna if you're not being tested water lucky you not even a son or daughter god you come to be tried and tested and what we don't understand is overcoming means exactly what it says overcoming that means before you overcome you are under come I understand me oh you gonna be a failure into God in his season you can't overcome in your own season no more than a baby tree can bring forth fruit even though all the life is in that tree to bring food feet forward it cannot to the season is right hello you understand me it's like all the children do I can't wait to get 18 right it's in them if they live continue to live they go get 18 and 50 mall net and as long as God give them grace ago you don't say but is a desire it is something in those children that wants to be an adult so is it with us those of us who are children of God there's something on the inside of us makes us say oh I came how to wait to God bring me to perfection but God planted the tree I've seen apple trees and some apple trees they've got so many fruit on it's the same seed now until they all hung down then you got this apple tree just barely got anything on it what is it and you fail to say well I want to do more for God God say okay you've got these things that need to be proved oh boy we don't like when God takes the sword and cut them things off and you forget it was your prayer cause you said Lord I want to be more like you oh Jesus Lord and he knows he knows God knows the exact moment that you go get up one day talk totally victorious if he knows how many time a bet or fly or flee bets his I don't you know he knows all about you you he planted you you didn't plant to himself Oh Lord I decided to get baptized only because the grace of God told you to all of that is God you can't save yourself God saves you he's the keeper of the soul that's why we're not supposed to easily judge other people because we don't know what God is working out no you don't know you know like probably God said he said when it came to Jacob and Esau he said it was Jacob Jacob excuse me he said he saw was the one that looked good he was he was daddy's servant did everything cook him some good grubs and all that and he said Jacob was always a side shyster ooh but it's the inside that God is looking at the seed that he planted in you before the foundation of the world why am I saying this because when the Bible town says blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope is in the Lord it in me it ain't in the preacher it ain't in the bishop nobody is in God for he shall be like a tree planted by the waters and that spreaded out her roots by the river and shall not see when that coming but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the years of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit in other words those who are anchored in Christ those who are planted in him do not experience and not afraid if the preacher don't preach what they need why are they already nourished they don't worry about it man be the Villar how could I say it a drought hallelujah a real believer fees themselves he didn't preach what I need and I want to tell people some God he didn't preach what you need didn't tell me something wind it allows you read you read ha young history when you say that when you know people felt fair to see that when they say well the preacher you put it on the preacher it shows you still a baby you still won't survive in the spoon feed you but you supposed to come come to church with a hey man Lord I don't already taste some of that already ah amen I don't read I study you got me and our we're on the same a car is this okay we're planted that means I want to be buried so nobody can see me and that life of God comes right up my roots because if we allow God to saturate us like that water would a tree in us and it's a root you don't have to worry about it because there is a law is that right there is a law and the law is this God is going to pull it up he's going to take that water in the roots and pull it up that tree I was gonna I was going to entitle this the Sun the resurrection of the Sun because that Sun has a law behind it that no matter where the seas are it duty is to pour that life up because the Sun itself is the resurrection in this natural without that there is no resurrection in the natural young you understand what I'm saying so that law that God that's why she says I am the resurrection if you're the body go to get up if anybody's going to mature I'm the Sun I'm the one that will bring you to maturity till you can't bring yourself to maturity it's God that brings you to maturity that's why the Bible said is not him that weird no he that rugged but God that showed mercy and I thank God for a prophet of God in the message that we have to know that I am I'm not gonna struggle Amen well Lord am I going to make it no I've already made it Wow because I'm planted in him you understand me and just like he could not die I can't die because the same source that kept him is the same source that keeps us wool hallelujah stir truth is the truth is the truth and when you planting in Christ amen for many of you have been baptized into Christ have put on on no y'all know what put him on like taking this off and put that means you wearing him hallelujah I was up there that day at the hobby the other day and and they had this guy you know he was dressed like Batman he was a proud young man and you know I thought he might be one of them friends of Mines associates that hadn't seen a long time so I had to make myself I had to go up there to look in his face cuz I was ready for a good laugh if it had been a friend of mine I would have left but you know it wasn't him but my point is some reason the guy looked like he was overtaken by that conscious thought costume he was overtaken and I thought you're not really thinking you Batman are you but you know it's in the same sense that that man could get out and probably dressed in that what about us there is no costume that we can put on like to express Jesus but we got the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit is supposed to reflect Christ so much to people can see us like I saw that man right cuz one day he even had a Batmobile out there but it's just something I don't know what he's he's working on his own or what but the point is he's overtaken if we love Jesus like that can you imagine the kind of results we would get but that's what I planted being planted being planted and understand this when you planted in Christ there's seasons that's going to come and make you flourish you into doing it is him he's gonna make you flourish is that right come on I know some of y'all have seen trees that looks so dead so you thought no this thing must be dead at the root and then here comes spring that thing is living again but it is it never died it kept its strength in the roots see what I'm saying what I'm saying is the seasons will come well you can't praise God like you won't him won't - you may not scream you mean that shout and all you can look like as a dare treat but there's something on the inside of you that will always keep you alive no matter how bad the weather gets that life is in the root and in his all season his season not yours his season he'll make that life come back up it has to that's the law that's a law of nature that's the law of God first John is what I love he said first John three eight through ten says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now understand sin is unbelief sinneth is to continue to UM in disbelief you're not that you overcome us that means I have fallen maybe because of a little doubt but I'm going to overcome this doubt I'm going to overcome this fear because we are overcomers we're not sinners and and we do not commit sin that's the Bible and whatsoever one of God does not commit sin why cuz he's great oh the Bible says for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God she is the seed that God looks at and I'm trying to hurry but it look like I can't move fast enough is to see that that that that that that God looks at when he you and God become Union that right you heard me say this before you a tree cannot produce tree without one being male and the other one female uh y'all got to know that and then they do this pollination thing and then the seeds come and they may you know so you saying brothers what are you saying it would not have but good if Jesus had come and had not a female part he would not have been able to produce his children Adam had to have Eve you know female part to produce we got Christ Himself Jesus himself and what is that bit that he didn't even get married because it wasn't the natural part that God was looking at he was coming with spiritual yes what on the day of Pentecost the female part was in place hallelujah all of a sudden people get excited about twins and triplets and he had a hundred and twenty one shot one time right oh he goes on to say you and I must understand this this whole ocean of God if I can say like Lord for the time said just like getting a little teaspoon out of the ocean so I'm using that word ocean just trying to describe because ocean if you're standing on the land there's no end to it you can't see the end or the opposite the other side of the it's ocean and that's how God is you can't there is no end to him and and yet you know the Bible tells us that yet in all of that there are those who did not come from God right and you saw what do you mean brother books and this is not to scare anybody because you must you should be confident now to know that you are a son or daughter of God by now hallelujah because that's what that's what make grace so amazing that all of the bad stuff you do you have done God still loves you hallelujah now the button that the probably God said now don't think you're gonna sin and get away guarding go cover it up you reap what you sow but it won't stop God from saving you hmm and then late to brush your teeth you get a cavity and guess what it's gonna paint the teeth was perfect in itself but it was your deflection that brought in the damage and that's what how it is what else you push you neglect to read your word you need like to pray you didn't like to keep in in connection with God you're going to pay for it and you know we call God that never know the devil is there only because you didn't fortify yourself that's the truth he's only there you know the devil is this right brother who said it the devil can't come in to you and me we had to go out he can't come where I am I'm under the blood and in order for the reader get to a place that I'm sinning into it I have to walk out to him well he he hypnotize me I don't know he's a serpent he don't look the serpent in the high he'd been on his journey into a trance you know you gotta watch that fella he's spy hey God to us but I love this way says if you ball of God you cannot say why because God is not looking at your own damn it nature this nature this this little bark of the tree if this thing is already doomed its dying every day right come on but on the inside of you understand you soil your dirt your dirt but on the inside of you it's been another tree planting hallelujah and it is called what we called the bride tree so a brother brother brigs am I gonna ever huh woo I love this people said but brother books you off the scripture no because the Bible said that jesus said himself I am the vine and you are the branches in order for you to continue you must abide in me that means you got to stay there that's why I love about trees I think about trees and I think man everybody time I when they go through think about a tree no matter what weather change that tree got to stay there it can't move it can't run it has to stay where it's planted and wherever it's been printed it will blue because the weather is gonna make sure it happened mmm God is so good to us jesus said only those who are from above will understand me right he told Oh decide those pharisees and sadducees say you can't understand me because you're not from where I am where I came from where did you come from I came out of that ocean you know that's what that's what they saying you know in evolution everything came out of but I came from out of the ocean the ocean of God I love the parable the parable said about the fishing and some will yield and some were snakes and all of that and it's amazing the fisherman caught him but he couldn't change them because they were who they they are who they were you know me you came in the met that so what are you gonna say who are you you first can I help your net you fish caught in the gospel net and guess what some of us all of us I don't know one fish that doesn't have to be clean before using it right it's the truth I don't I if somebody caught some fish and they cooked it with the guts and all in it excuse me you know you know you don't take the scales off of them oh I just cooked me some fish and you still got the scales for some reason that fish is no longer appealing but God knows how to get it all together I got a few more minutes is this okay he told him he said you you you you're gonna die your sins because there's nothing in you they gonna believe me cuz he came did that and before Cain amen his daddy did it all those years or whatever you call it with God and Lucifer still disbelieve faith is a gift you know faith is not some oh I got faith cuz I read it every on all of the Bible that don't give you faith faith is a gift from God we didn't know that we thought I had to come up with it now it's a gift and sometimes when God gives you the faith some people won't receive it it ain't faith to you if you won't receive it remember remember the one lady could have lived and brother Balaam said if you don't catch it you're gonna die basically what happened she didn't get it and she died it wasn't that God didn't give her the faith but she just didn't have it she couldn't get it why because most of us think it's so big oh I the more I see God and I at je trouve the more simple he becomes it's when we we we look like he's this this great giant you know what I'm saying and he comes in and here he comes in the form of a man and brother man don't say that Jesus is about his size his height short hmm and we look at this thing we think within ourselves that God has to have muscles God don't need no muscle it's his word and we must understand him in that when you plant it this is what I love about honey whatever territory or whatever territory the flowers that those that's in that particular territory is it's gonna tell what kind of the characteristics of that honey now honey's gonna be sweet but not all honey is sweet because the flowers are not all sweet good tasting honey you know I mean that's what I mean and my point is you know you go over to clover a covert a overhead and near Vancouver where the honey it's just white and look like smooth sometimes white some time is like creamy color it looks like almost like lard but good I even put it on my chicken so I want you to understand by God's grace it's just they're good you know you look at these things and you said what brother was what he said then if you go over to to uh I used to have all kinds of balls of honey your Trinidad and all and that the honey is different the texture is different you know what I'm saying and we must understand that even though we are eating honey is where you raised and what portion of the ocean you've been planted eating from the same table when you say what brothers explain it to me because understand water one water rivers of water right and bill don't talk about the nine gifts nine fruits of the spirit all of that but one water and God is expecting us to show that prove that that the word proving it that you have been with God before the foundation of the world this is your hour and your time to prove that you were with him and how do you believe how do you prove that you were with him by believing every word and acting upon it almost done brother where God is speaking of his fruit tree that he had planted God planted a fruit tree he planted it on the day of Pentecost and he brought that tree there for purpose he wanted it to bear his fruit see according to Psalm says his fruit in his season right it showed that God was going to not a prophet that was going to sow the seeds and in that season that God has prophesied would come to pass that seed would manifest itself read it it's to his brother Adam brings it out one is what he is is God and the other one is the Prophet because the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and that word that prophet is the one who sews the seeds right whether Luther Wesleyan you know these men God ordained or so to see but there you know it's like this you know when you plant a seed you expect for it you wanted to come up in a day no sir it will not come up in the day it has a season he planted it on the day of Pentecost that's what policy some plant some water and God gives the increase right he planted on the day of Pentecost and he brought that tree there for purpose he wanted to bear the bear his fruit word God word he wanted a church that will keep his word all down through the ages he had failed to keep it the Jews did fail to keep it the law had failed yeah all had failed so God planted him a tree that's right a tree now remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden now know that you called them whatever you want to I have my idea but not but anyhow one of them was defiled tree it got defiled and the other one wasn't defiled that tree of life come from God out of heaven he said your father eat manna and our dead but this tree you eat and you live forever and angel God at that tree of life from the Garden of Eden kept it in Eden that tree of life is in Eden now spiritually speaking now so where is the Tree of Life and who is Eden okay right you're the tree mmm-hmm now let's stop oh oh business begin now when these trees that got planted it was to bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kind which means nine spiritual gifts and nine of the spirit nine of the Spirit now skew the nine fruits of the spirit to go with one with the nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it on in earth on the day of Pentecost see now let's stop always so limited with time I'm going to skip all right so you know what the whole point is you know we must understand he said he shall be like a tree God's tree planted where by the river rivers plural rivers of water singular so you know just one water one God bringing forth all of these things I'm I'm gonna stop in just a minute give me grace Elmer's here you must understand that this tree in itself will bring forth you how can I say it I love God I just love the way he explained things he said seed see one thing about the seed you can't you can't disguise what it is time will make manifest what it is whether it be an apple tree or orange tree whatever that seed can't change itself it is what it is gives you a preference what about remember because Bob said he'd never lose one not one he knows exactly all of his God in his God do not go through the process of a elimination in our own physical body we go through a process of elimination those who were not elected yet they come from out of our body they die but none of God sees never die everyone God put out there will grow will be born he can't he can't see because all of that is God you take one piece of that away it unless is God because all of that scar you understand me it's like a piece of puzzle a puzzle you can't take one part out of it and expect that puzzle not to be affected affected by you understand me it takes all of us to make him not one part of God amen has been taken and done away with everything that you see that is destroyed and God put away was not God's in the beginning you say well what about this God knows day they were not sons of God though they were called sons of God because they we are born in the image and likeness of God whether them said all man is in the image of sons of God but his was in you make sure your son huh children of the promise are sons and daughters of God that's why people get mixed up the sons of God saw the daughters of men want to marry no money and whether the men come from it took us a prophet to tell us that that that came married his own sister who was even going to marry that's your message and they produce Giants there wasn't no angels from heaven coming now because they don't have sexual things going on up there if that was the case Lucifer would not have needed the serpent he needed the serpent to bring that kind of hybrid ational you know the Lord my last quote I know we got some late Springs late seasons of Easter monk coming the Lord is tearing his coming they say and every time everything like that and the cold winds killed a lot of them denominational 's with the same branches but it can't kill the life that's predestinated heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall not all that he foreknew he called those he called he has justified those who he had justified he has already glorified hallelujah it's written in the book the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot die all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop her no communism no Catholicism no nothing else would stop it I will restore said the Lord all the man-made Roman trees will never hang it there all the graves will never keep it there all the big denominational stones laying all at the door will never keep it in there I will restore said the Lord there will be an Easter it'll bring forth the same church in this same power here to bring a bride out just like she was back there with the same signs the same fruits the same thing that they did it'll bring I'll bring her back again I will restore said the Lord what restore all that the denomination's eat all restore all the organization's eat off I will restore said the Lord all of it he's our Lord when his time and in his season God knows exactly what he's doing you know and and we've got to trust him we can stand we must trust him God has never planted a bad seed whoa no it's true the parable of the seed there was a good man who sowed good seed and a bad man there so bad seed God never mixed the seeds we are so blessed in this last day and I don't even know how to describe it I don't but one thing I can truly say is that I I'm really seeing things that I don't even maybe don't even know what I'm seeing here but I do see things and I realized one thing I my perfectionism in him if I didn't have his life in me I would be just like anyone else wretched miserable blind naked you know there's nothing god then choose me because of the way I look or whatever family I came out of no the choice that God made was before the foundation of the world you all of us you know I look at us and cold outside on the wind and Wednesday night and y'all still come out you don't you think God sees that you may think you know I didn't do anything but you did you came and and God will honor that because he knows all the obstacles of the battles that you had before you did come but you pressed your way out to come see brother Brooks know you came to hear the word the attraction is the word not some preacher not know musically the attraction is the word that's what's pulling you and if that is pulling you guess what it's doing something it's transforming you you can't see it but that life is moving on up it is it's transforming you but you don't heard me say this so many times you know I asked somebody what do you see on this piece of paper yeah nobody's gonna say oh I see all that whatever color that is whatever it is you wanted to say I see this is the table desktop but what about all this what about all is and that's what the devil shows you he shows you your mistake and you forget about all the blessings that God has given you all of the sins that he's forgiven you of and there's not one piece of anything here that's showing that you've ever seen before now you look at this and you say well I got one thing that bothers me all the time what you're blessed he just got one thing you are blessed as many of the afflictions of the righteous but God delivered them all from them all right oh you got many but don't think he meant that that God is did you know just punishing you think about all this and I think about it as a whole bad you know I don't know how much more suffering and trials and things I've got to go through but oh my when I get to heaven it's gonna be worth it all like I said that like that song said when we look back these old trials will seem small God can do anything but fail [Music] I'm so glad to see my brother John a man we've been talking about it ever since I you know just it shows you none of us knows the mind of God but I know for certain every night in the end God would have me praying for the brother my love for Josh is unconditional for this brother as well I mean for the Marsha and all of them I don't how can I judge anybody Jesus even said I didn't come to judge did you know that he said but if I would judge my judgment would be true we'll leave that up to God to do all that he needs to do but I said like this I don't know what tomorrow holds for you today I stand he understand what I'm saying only God orders the foot prints of the son are sons of God but I are saying like this in closing I love every choice that God has made for me [Music] because I realized that I would not have the love of God in my heart don't get me wrong folks I stand up here and I'm they sound like whoo but the books perfect don't you ever believe that I'm not perfect in myself I'm only perfect in him failures come my way every day mmm but I thank God for His amazing grace in the blood of
