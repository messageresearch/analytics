[1:17:07] our weaknesses
[1:17:08] amen i don't get no hurry today
[1:17:11] let's just
[1:17:12] absolutely settle into the word of god
[1:17:16] amen you got your spot there all right
[1:17:19] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:17:22] i live
[1:17:23] yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:17:27] the life which i now live in the flesh
[1:17:31] i live by how many tapes i can listen to
[1:17:35] no i live by how righteous i can be
[1:17:38] no i live because i follow a prophet
[1:17:42] well why do people believe that
[1:17:45] why do people believe that's the reason
[1:17:47] that they exist
[1:17:49] let me tell you something right now you
[1:17:51] every one of you everyone all your
[1:17:53] little ears you perk them up and listen
[1:17:55] right here brother ben
[1:17:57] if you live at all it's because of the
[1:17:58] faith of the synagogue
[1:18:01] and not because of you
[1:18:04] not because of me
[1:18:06] amen and then reading galatians 2 and
[1:18:09] 20. now let's look at verse 21.
[1:18:13] all right these two verses galatians 2
[1:18:17] 20 and 21.
[1:18:19] paul now says
[1:18:21] i do not frustrate the grace of god
[1:18:39] you got a word for that in french
[1:18:41] here here's the here's the definition of
[1:18:43] it clemency
[1:18:46] i suppose the fact or quality
[1:18:50] of being more merciful
[1:18:53] or tolerant
[1:18:56] than expected
[1:19:00] our expectation is for god not to be
[1:19:02] merciful to us
[1:19:06] for god not to want to put up with us
[1:19:10] ah the words amen in case you forgot it
[1:19:15] right notice
[1:19:17] i do not frustrate the grace of god
[1:19:33] i want you to think about that just a
[1:19:34] minute
[1:19:36] if christ
[1:19:38] needed you or me
[1:19:40] then there was no reason for the cross
[1:19:41] of calvary
[1:19:46] i didn't need him
[1:20:01] that i can't live this by myself
[1:20:14] amen let's pray together
[1:20:16] what your head's about this morning
[1:20:20] if you'd like to be remembered in prayer
[1:20:21] some special need would you raise your
[1:20:23] hand to the lord this morning
[1:20:26] amen god bless you my hands up too
[1:20:30] father thank you for your mercy lord
[1:20:33] thank you for being tolerant
[1:20:36] for being patient
[1:20:38] for giving us grace to grow
[1:20:40] and acknowledge to know how to grow
[1:20:44] lord we commit the service now
[1:20:47] to thy capable hands
[1:20:50] may your holy spirit i pray
[1:20:53] not only speak to us through thy word
[1:20:57] lord i pray you'll grant to everyone
[1:21:12] i commit
[1:21:25] we commit this to your hands
[1:21:29] and for every uplift
[1:21:31] we commit these needs to you
[1:21:34] in the name of jesus christ
[1:21:37] and the church said amen
[1:21:39] god bless you may be seated may the lord
[1:21:41] bless you really good
[1:21:43] amen
[1:21:47] it's about all i know in french but i
[1:21:49] like to say it
[1:21:51] amen and
[1:21:52] looking now just to hold your bible
[1:21:54] there in galatians for a moment
[1:21:57] i want to call your attention to a
[1:21:59] couple things
[1:22:01] the first thing i want to point out
[1:22:05] the apostle paul
[1:22:07] is identifying himself
[1:22:10] has been crucified with christ
[1:22:14] one of the first things you've got to
[1:22:16] understand
[1:22:18] is that in order to be a true child of
[1:22:21] god
[1:22:36] we must die
[1:22:38] to ourselves
[1:22:40] our ideas
[1:22:42] our thoughts
[1:22:44] jesus crucified
[1:22:47] golgotha
[1:22:49] being interpreted the
[1:23:01] and that's where you and i must be
[1:23:02] crucified
[1:23:17] all of that must die
[1:23:22] in order to produce eternal life
[1:23:25] and without that death
[1:23:28] there can be no resurrection
[1:23:31] if i am going to live in jesus christ
[1:23:35] i must be crucified with him
[1:23:39] remember he was a subject
[1:23:43] to death
[1:23:44] he made himself subjects
[1:24:00] he
[1:24:05] come on somebody give me a little
[1:24:07] amen or something
[1:24:09] praise the lord now listen to me
[1:24:12] the holy ghost
[1:24:14] is wanting us to do the same exact thing
[1:24:20] god doesn't want to overtake us
[1:24:24] jesus doesn't want to force us
[1:24:28] he doesn't want to make us do anything
[1:24:32] but he wants us to surrender ourselves
[1:24:37] to the death of the cross
[1:24:40] remember that he said nevertheless
[1:24:44] even though i live in this flesh
[1:24:47] it is not me that liveth anymore
[1:24:51] but christ who lives inside of me
[1:24:54] you see we ain't happy enough about that
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:22] everything was made
[1:25:38] amen and praise the lord
[1:25:40] his whole mission
[1:25:43] was to come together
[1:25:46] that christ could be born in you
[1:25:49] which is the hope of glory
[1:25:52] let me tell you something right now my
[1:25:53] only hope in this life
[1:25:57] my only hope in this life
[1:26:00] is is that reality
[1:26:04] without that in my heart
[1:26:06] i'm
[1:26:20] live in a fine house
[1:26:22] but brother when russia hits that button
[1:26:24] over there
[1:26:26] and this nation is laying an atomic
[1:26:29] fodder
[1:26:30] amen it won't matter one thing
[1:26:49] you
[1:26:51] come on somebody preach to me now
[1:26:53] amen it is something that wants you to
[1:26:55] leave this life
[1:26:58] everything you've ever accomplished is
[1:27:00] null and voice
[1:27:16] you might be a very good looking person
[1:27:20] i've always been jealous of that
[1:27:23] i've never felt like i was ever really a
[1:27:25] good looking person
[1:27:28] some people might have great strength in
[1:27:30] their muscles
[1:27:33] they take great confidence
[1:27:36] and how much they can bench press
[1:27:41] but let cancer strike that body one time
[1:27:58] there is
[1:28:11] and the skin worms are destroying
[1:28:23] lays upon that new birth experience
[1:28:29] amen
[1:28:30] hallelujah
[1:28:32] as i said we're not happy enough about
[1:28:33] it
[1:28:35] we come to church and hear this
[1:28:38] and we sit down and say well it's not
[1:28:40] wonderful
[1:28:54] well you know i'm a curious sort of
[1:28:56] person
[1:28:58] i'm always asking questions
[1:29:02] yes to answer your question i do get in
[1:29:04] trouble a lot
[1:29:07] but i wonder to myself sometimes
[1:29:11] before why is it even the christian
[1:29:13] church
[1:29:16] seems to have lost their joy
[1:29:20] about what god has done within
[1:29:34] why the church is not more
[1:29:49] surely that would bring you to the house
[1:29:51] of the lord
[1:29:54] shouting and rejoicing
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:57] thanks be to god forevermore
[1:30:02] i was a sinner now i am a saint of god
[1:30:07] that should make you worship a little
[1:30:09] bit
[1:30:11] but i'm going to tell you why it doesn't
[1:30:15] and here is the reason i'm preaching my
[1:30:17] text this morning
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:45] you can at least blink your eyes at me
[1:30:47] every now and then that won't hurt my
[1:30:48] feelings
[1:30:50] right you know yourself
[1:30:53] you know how lazy you can be
[1:30:57] you know how aggravating you can be
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:13] you know in this day and age people love
[1:31:15] to visit landmarks
[1:31:19] i remember the civil war
[1:31:21] i remember when the the when congo used
[1:31:24] to be or such and such
[1:31:27] i remember when africa used to be this
[1:31:31] i remember when europe used to look like
[1:31:33] that
[1:31:34] christians have done the same thing
[1:31:38] i remember when we used to have joy
[1:31:41] i remember when we used
[1:31:56] we enjoy
[1:32:10] i remember the day when the lord saved
[1:32:13] me
[1:32:15] but we have long forgotten
[1:32:19] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:32:24] today come on now preach to me and
[1:32:27] forever
[1:32:30] if you ever had choice
[1:32:33] you can have it right now
[1:32:36] if you ever had a shot
[1:32:51] it don't have to be a thing of history
[1:32:55] you can lift him out of history
[1:32:58] but i'm going to tell you what hinders
[1:32:59] us
[1:33:01] our weaknesses
[1:33:03] it's not those things that god delivered
[1:33:06] us up when we got
[1:33:18] you see when a man used to smoke
[1:33:19] cigarettes or drink
[1:33:47] and watch where it lands for later on
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] you take a man that was a drunkard
[1:33:55] or a woman for that matter
[1:33:58] when god forgives him
[1:34:00] gives him the holy ghost
[1:34:16] what
[1:34:30] he can't take that impatience from you
[1:34:35] because that was born in your flesh
[1:34:38] oh i see you're looking at me now
[1:34:41] all right now listen close
[1:34:44] when you got the holy ghost how many got
[1:34:45] the holy ghost put your hand up
[1:34:47] come on don't be ashamed if you're born
[1:34:49] again tell it
[1:34:50] let the redeemed of the lord say so
[1:34:54] now when you got to holy ghost and he
[1:34:56] changed your nose
[1:34:58] did he
[1:35:05] you are the same person today as when
[1:35:08] you got received the holy ghost when you
[1:35:10] got saved
[1:35:26] if god
[1:35:38] because he knew you could not overcome
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:53] you would overcome
[1:36:06] because he knows you can whip it
[1:36:10] [Applause]
[1:36:43] jesus i said i got a message for you
[1:36:46] today
[1:36:48] jesus understands
[1:37:04] i want to tell you something quickly
[1:37:07] quickly quickly quickly i want to tell
[1:37:08] you this
[1:37:10] you thinking yourself
[1:37:13] that god is frustrated with you
[1:37:18] god
[1:37:28] were you a human when you got saved
[1:37:45] evidently it didn't bother him
[1:37:49] he gave you the holy ghost in spite of
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:54] y'all like what i'm saying
[1:37:57] he wasn't looking at that part anyways
[1:38:13] he wasn't looking at how
[1:38:17] [Applause]
[1:38:40] it ain't no good
[1:38:42] but
[1:38:55] that i don't have enough faith for me
[1:39:02] well that got some interesting looks on
[1:39:05] some interesting faces
[1:39:07] because you see
[1:39:10] we have a tendency to believe
[1:39:14] it's my faith that keeps me see my
[1:39:16] god
[1:39:18] as long as i believe i'm a son of god
[1:39:22] as long as i believe i'm a daughter
[1:39:35] because you see human faith has an
[1:39:37] expiration date
[1:39:50] people running around my choice my
[1:39:52] choice i chose i chose
[1:39:55] what did you choose
[1:39:57] when it comes time to eat after church
[1:40:02] let's go eat mexican i don't know i
[1:40:04] don't want to go eat mexican i'm tired
[1:40:06] of mexican i want chinese
[1:40:09] i don't want chinese
[1:40:11] i want to eat italians
[1:40:13] and on the way to the italian restaurant
[1:40:16] you've done decided you want mexican
[1:40:18] instead
[1:40:40] this is why brother bradham said you're
[1:40:42] only saved as long as you believe you
[1:40:44] are well
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:41:02] even
[1:41:14] he always believes
[1:41:28] and god believed his own words
[1:41:43] oh come on somebody preach to me wow
[1:41:46] i don't live by my face
[1:41:49] i live by his face
[1:41:52] as i know how we are
[1:41:54] oh i don't care what the color your skin
[1:41:56] is
[1:41:57] you're a human being like everybody else
[1:42:00] you got pride
[1:42:02] no girl you got arrogance
[1:42:05] you think you're something
[1:42:08] and those that don't think there's
[1:42:09] something
[1:42:11] they take joy in being nothing
[1:42:26] there's no
[1:42:37] all it takes is just a just a little
[1:42:52] thank god i don't live by my face
[1:42:56] amen
[1:42:58] thank god
[1:43:00] right
[1:43:03] but now paul is saying
[1:43:06] i don't frustrate his grace
[1:43:21] because of your feasts and celebrations
[1:43:23] and traditions
[1:43:26] you have frustrated god
[1:43:28] and frustrated his grace
[1:43:31] well he said so
[1:43:32] that's all become a stink in my nostrils
[1:43:36] is that played the part of a
[1:43:38] laying under every green tree
[1:43:40] remember that when he talked about going
[1:43:42] to idols
[1:43:44] she's laid under every green tree
[1:43:49] committing adultery with everything
[1:43:50] around her
[1:44:03] now we look at god
[1:44:17] if i am a born-again child of god
[1:44:24] it is impossible
[1:44:27] it is impossible
[1:44:31] for me to ever go to
[1:44:35] hell
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:42] well that didn't get the ring i was
[1:44:44] looking for
[1:44:45] let me say it one more time make sure
[1:44:48] you take your time on this now
[1:44:50] it is impossible
[1:44:53] for me to go to hell
[1:44:56] if i'm a born again child of god
[1:45:00] god cannot
[1:45:40] don't lie in church tell the truth in
[1:45:42] church now
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:10] to
[1:46:15] [Applause]
[1:46:23] the second thing i want to share with
[1:46:25] you
[1:46:26] is that often
[1:46:28] we get this in our mind
[1:46:31] that because god is just
[1:46:35] that he is going to beat us with us
[1:46:38] correct
[1:46:49] repenting all the time of little tiny
[1:47:19] that there is no mercy for the bride
[1:47:24] you are the bride of jesus christ
[1:47:27] so if you lose your temper
[1:47:30] you better look out daddy's gonna get
[1:47:32] your
[1:47:36] well i don't even have to know your
[1:47:38] language to know that i'm real close to
[1:47:40] home with you
[1:47:44] right
[1:47:46] now as human beings
[1:48:02] of what kind of father he truly is
[1:48:06] now turn me to second peter chapter 3
[1:48:11] this is where my word comes in leniency
[1:48:15] clemency
[1:48:30] there would not be a moment of our life
[1:48:34] that we wouldn't have a spanking coming
[1:48:40] but now watch us in second peter chapter
[1:48:43] 3 verse 8.
[1:49:10] that a god that comes to the end of a
[1:49:13] thousand-year reign
[1:49:17] looks down and says
[1:49:19] oh what a day that was
[1:49:23] you realize when the church ages and all
[1:49:25] of this is over with
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:47] [Laughter]
[1:49:55] well i want to ask you something then
[1:49:58] what is your 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 year
[1:50:02] lifetime mean then
[1:50:05] to a god that a thousand years is like
[1:50:08] one day
[1:50:12] what is that little tiny five-minute
[1:50:15] mistake that you made
[1:50:17] what's it say
[1:50:19] to a god
[1:50:20] andrew that a thousand years is like one
[1:50:23] full day
[1:50:25] i'm here to tell you it means nothing to
[1:50:27] him
[1:50:29] oh it means something to us
[1:50:32] we'll carry on and we'll barely ache and
[1:50:35] groan and grumble
[1:50:50] devil pressing right now satan you
[1:50:52] better get ready i'm coming anyhow
[1:50:56] you watch and see how that we act when
[1:50:58] it comes that way
[1:51:01] we will spend more time
[1:51:04] being
[1:51:18] that is not the
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:32] for seven years let's say
[1:51:34] what is that to a god
[1:51:38] that's got a thousand years feeling as a
[1:51:40] day yeah
[1:51:43] glory to god
[1:51:46] well church i'm to preach with you or
[1:51:48] without you but i'm preaching anyhow
[1:51:52] so good time to get your mouth open and
[1:51:55] say amen
[1:51:57] right
[1:51:58] but you see what we do as human beings
[1:52:02] already little turtles you have
[1:52:04] retreated into your shell
[1:52:09] and this is why your shout has become
[1:52:12] historically
[1:52:24] remember that he does not deal with us
[1:52:42] you take this little child in this
[1:52:43] mother's arms right here
[1:52:47] which one of you fathers would want to
[1:52:48] grab it by its neck
[1:52:53] and take a stick and beat it
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:52] there is a
[1:54:03] before he allows you to misbehave
[1:54:10] oh but see that was easy to say amen too
[1:54:15] because we look at him as he's a judge
[1:54:18] he is a just god
[1:54:22] but do you ever stop to think how
[1:54:24] merciful he really is
[1:54:29] you see folks the hardest person to
[1:54:31] forgive is your own self
[1:54:33] the person
[1:54:34] you
[1:54:48] now listen again james chapter 5 verse 7
[1:54:54] well hallelujah
[1:54:57] y'all didn't make an amen tape that we
[1:54:59] can
[1:55:00] fill in the gaps with you all have amen
[1:55:02] services
[1:55:04] well if you've got it cue it up i may
[1:55:06] need to borrow your electronic amends
[1:55:08] every now and then

[1:55:11] now james 5 verse 7
[1:55:14] i've been at this 31 years i ain't
[1:55:16] killed nobody yet
[1:55:20] now watch be patient therefore brethren
[1:55:25] unto the coming of the lord jesus
[1:55:28] behold the husbandman
[1:55:44] stomps
[1:55:56] he waiteth for the precious fruit of the
[1:55:59] earth
[1:56:02] you see this is his attitude
[1:56:06] you
[1:56:07] are
[1:56:07] precious
[1:56:11] come on somebody help me this morning
[1:56:14] he doesn't look at you as a bother
[1:56:21] you are not an aggravation to jesus
[1:56:26] he is not one of these fathers that get
[1:56:28] irritated at their children when they
[1:56:30] come around
[1:56:34] he can't wait to be in your presence
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:40] the same that you feel about him
[1:56:48] that he feels about you
[1:56:51] he can't wait
[1:56:54] to get in your
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:07] for as long as it takes
[1:57:10] i might as well say it i can feel your
[1:57:12] thinking
[1:57:14] i can feel you and i can hear some of
[1:57:16] you thinking
[1:57:19] well brother ben you're trying to give
[1:57:21] us a license to live any way we want to
[1:57:24] say
[1:57:27] well when you get bored again then
[1:57:29] you'll get that devil out of your mind
[1:57:31] and then we can go on
[1:57:34] christians don't have that attitude and
[1:57:36] if you've got that attitude you're not a
[1:57:38] christian
[1:57:40] amen and amen praise the lord roger i
[1:57:43] don't care what you say amen or not
[1:57:44] that's the truth
[1:57:46] christians aren't looking for loopholes
[1:57:49] they're not looking for little side
[1:57:51] roads to take you know they got the pop
[1:57:54] no if you got that in your mind you
[1:57:55] don't even know what i'm talking about
[1:57:58] this is only for those that are trying
[1:58:00] to walk
[1:58:03] notice you are precious fruit to him
[1:58:08] now what farmer do you know okay
[1:58:12] we'll go down through a great big apple
[1:58:14] orchard
[1:58:18] and see some of those red and delicious
[1:58:19] and honeysuckle and
[1:58:23] some of those honey crisp apples
[1:58:27] some of them granny smith apples
[1:58:30] go down through there and see a bug on
[1:58:32] that tree
[1:58:36] or see weeds at the bottom of that tree
[1:58:42] and then run over and get a big ax
[1:58:46] and start chopping that tree down
[1:58:49] you are the stupidest tree i've ever
[1:58:51] seen in my life
[1:58:54] why can't you get them bugs off
[1:58:59] if you were any kind of a tree at all
[1:59:01] you wouldn't grow them weeds
[1:59:06] do you know what that farmer does
[1:59:09] he picks that bug and goes bloop
[1:59:12] he gets down and pulls him weeds up
[1:59:14] around that tree
[1:59:18] he gets one of them red and delicious
[1:59:20] next to his face
[1:59:23] and if he's a real farmer he starts
[1:59:25] talking to it
[1:59:28] you gotta talk to nature to get what you
[1:59:29] want out of it
[1:59:32] you are a beautiful red and delicious
[1:59:37] you ain't there yet but i know what
[1:59:39] you're gonna taste like one day
[1:59:42] my wife has got an apple pie with your
[1:59:45] name on it
[1:59:50] grow
[1:59:51] little apple grow
[1:59:55] right
[2:00:11] i know it's hard it's hard to translate
[2:00:12] hillbilly but you're getting there
[2:00:15] how absolutely out of your mind are you
[2:00:18] coming
[2:00:20] what's the matter are you crazy
[2:00:24] oh he don't look at the tree like that
[2:00:28] but he considers it precious
[2:00:32] the bug
[2:00:34] doesn't mean anything to him
[2:00:37] he doesn't get upset at the bug
[2:00:40] he deals with a bug
[2:00:43] but not quickly
[2:00:46] because you realize sometimes
[2:00:48] you gotta learn how to treat that plant
[2:01:03] and give you some time to figure it out
[2:01:08] i figured that's about the way this
[2:01:10] would go but you're going to be better
[2:01:11] when you walk out of here i promise
[2:01:15] right
[2:01:16] because remember
[2:01:19] he is waiting
[2:01:32] but you see we don't deal with our
[2:01:33] families that way
[2:01:36] we don't deal with our our friends that
[2:01:38] way
[2:01:40] we have no patience for anybody
[2:01:44] we just do we just get mad at the drop
[2:01:46] of a hat also
[2:01:48] a bit more
[2:02:06] the prophet said the prophet said the
[2:02:07] prophet said the prophet said the
[2:02:08] prophet said the prophet
[2:02:13] but the bible said the bible says
[2:02:28] and you're trying to make it walk when
[2:02:30] it's not able to yet
[2:02:36] you gotta have leniency
[2:02:39] you gotta have tolerance
[2:02:42] until it gets strength and it's little
[2:02:43] legs
[2:02:59] me you see because we are revelating
[2:03:01] people
[2:03:04] we know everything
[2:03:06] you don't think so just ask us we know
[2:03:08] everything
[2:03:11] we've got the opening of the word
[2:03:22] you can explain to somebody every plague
[2:03:25] and vile in the book of revelation
[2:03:39] to figure out why you get lazy and don't
[2:03:41] want to pray
[2:03:45] you were mute
[2:03:47] not a scripture
[2:03:49] not a quote
[2:03:50] not an explanation
[2:03:52] not a clue
[2:03:55] oh i know look at the angels in this
[2:03:57] church right now
[2:03:59] your halos are blinding me
[2:04:05] come on you all do the same thing that i
[2:04:07] do
[2:04:21] amen
[2:04:23] what do you do about those times
[2:04:27] what's god supposed to do grab his belt
[2:04:33] he knows you're still trying to walk
[2:04:49] because you forgot to read your bible
[2:04:54] we are better catholics than the
[2:04:56] catholics are catholics
[2:05:00] because we practice
[2:05:04] all of the same catechism
[2:05:08] see when a catholic does wrong
[2:05:11] they have to pay penance
[2:05:15] so they'll punish themselves
[2:05:17] in some
[2:05:19] to have peace with god
[2:05:22] thank god for a little fella by the name
[2:05:24] of martin luther
[2:05:27] because he found out what trash that was
[2:05:29] in the 16th century
[2:05:45] this is why paul said
[2:05:48] i am crucified with christ
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:05:53] i don't have to punish myself
[2:05:56] i've already taken the punishment
[2:06:01] amen
[2:06:03] and yet at the same time
[2:06:06] he has long
[2:06:07] patience
[2:06:10] until he receives the early and the
[2:06:12] latter reign
[2:06:40] if you're brave enough to admit that
[2:06:42] that's the truth then there ought to be
[2:06:44] some deliverances in this church this
[2:06:46] morning right now
[2:06:49] because your weaknesses
[2:06:51] were designed by god
[2:06:54] oh
[2:06:55] they were placed there by god
[2:06:59] so that he can reflect his strength
[2:07:01] through you
[2:07:05] my god why can't we get that into our
[2:07:07] hearts
[2:07:09] why do we take cats of nine tails and
[2:07:12] beat ourselves
[2:07:17] when the very weakness that you're
[2:07:19] ashamed of
[2:07:22] is the thing god placed in you that shot
[2:07:29] amen amen and amen and amen and amen and
[2:07:32] amen amen
[2:07:34] amen praise the lord praise the lord
[2:07:37] most gladly he says i will glory
[2:07:43] in my infirmities
[2:07:48] the next time you get discouraged
[2:07:52] about yourself
[2:08:05] to not be able to do it
[2:08:17] can you take over
[2:08:35] i don't know
[2:08:36] that's what paul said
[2:08:38] if i can be righteous
[2:08:41] then christ died in vain i don't do it
[2:08:43] but because i can't do it of course
[2:08:46] pastor should have properly i don't have
[2:08:48] the
[2:09:01] that i'm helpless
[2:09:04] and i need his strength
[2:09:07] amen
[2:09:12] thank you lord jesus thank god
[2:09:15] he says i'll take pleasure
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:28] and distress for christ's sake
[2:09:43] that is
[2:09:57] is when we know
[2:10:04] [Music]
[2:10:40] adoption
[2:10:42] brother says how can you preach the
[2:10:45] predestination of god

[2:11:16] good stock gold star after church
[2:11:22] we've got this attitude
[2:11:24] that somehow we're the elite
[2:11:29] i believe the message because i am a
[2:11:31] prophetic class
[2:11:35] all right amen and praise the lord
[2:11:38] but
[2:11:41] you cannot hold that belief without
[2:11:48] knowing there was a lamb slain before

[2:15:24] things wrong
[2:15:26] right talk about the church
[2:15:28] i'm talking about the baptist now
[2:15:30] i'm talking about you

[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:46] i never smoke cigarettes
[2:16:00] got mad got discouraged
[2:16:13] this happens to me all the time
[2:16:15] you see people look at me well
[2:16:26] i've actually been accused of being
[2:16:28] hooked on dope
[2:16:45] my answer to that was you get the same
[2:16:47] holy ghost i got it i'll do the same
[2:16:49] thing for you
[2:16:53] right 64.
[2:16:55] you get the wrong impression sometimes
[2:17:05] and you'll get the thought that
[2:17:07] something that brother or sister's got
[2:17:08] something against you
[2:17:12] that's just the strength of our
[2:17:13] imagination
[2:17:17] he said make scooples
[2:17:21] or wobbles like a little child
[2:17:26] that's trying
[2:17:38] he's just trying to learn how to walk
[2:17:54] but there are constant areas of our life
[2:17:59] this pastor
[2:18:01] that we are still trying to walk in
[2:18:06] the machine you might master one thing
[2:18:43] all right listen close are you listening
[2:18:45] if you're listening say amen
[2:18:47] amen he doesn't whip us
[2:19:03] oh my god
[2:19:05] dear brother brad i'm going to say that
[2:19:07] well then why do we have it preached the
[2:19:09] other way
[2:19:12] listen to me
[2:19:14] i
[2:19:15] don't have to have an altar call every
[2:19:18] time
[2:19:46] i need
[2:19:58] i don't mean here from the local church
[2:19:59] but i mean listen around
[2:20:28] look at how you sisters have been
[2:20:29] preached on your entire life
[2:20:33] every time you come to church
[2:20:35] some preachers stand up talk about women
[2:20:39] listen brother i understand we've got to
[2:20:42] hold a standard
[2:20:56] in the tabernacle
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:09] well just go check me out if you doubt
[2:21:12] me
[2:21:16] they asked the prophet of god
[2:21:19] what about that woman brother branham
[2:21:23] you know what he said
[2:21:34] but you see when it comes to our
[2:21:36] churches
[2:21:39] if a woman walked in here poorly dressed
[2:21:44] and i wouldn't i wouldn't be a good
[2:21:46] candidate today because i walked out of
[2:21:48] left tennessee and forgot my coat
[2:21:52] but
[2:22:19] and this was my title the woman of the
[2:22:23] wells first day in church
[2:22:32] could you imagine
[2:22:34] what them
[2:22:49] oh we don't like her kind around here
[2:22:53] but evidently jesus didn't share that
[2:22:55] opinion
[2:22:58] because he jeopardized his own
[2:23:00] reputation
[2:23:14] he will come to your
[2:23:27] he knew that her life was a mess
[2:23:58] those married people like that marriage
[2:24:00] and divorce
[2:24:02] i ain't dealing with them people in
[2:24:04] marriage conditions
[2:24:07] god thank god thank god
[2:24:10] that the lord still had that opinion in
[2:24:13] the 20th century
[2:24:17] because he took brother branham
[2:24:19] rock in arizona
[2:24:22] to show his attitude toward little women
[2:24:24] at the well
[2:24:38] because we're trying to walk
[2:24:53] and memorizing every word
[2:25:06] a real daddy would not whip his child
[2:25:08] when he's trying to walk
[2:25:13] if he falls on the floor
[2:25:16] he reaches down with a strong hand
[2:25:21] gets a hold of him say this is the way
[2:25:23] you do it son
[2:25:26] but you see a lot of preachers are the
[2:25:27] other way
[2:25:30] they like to get the baby by both hands
[2:25:33] and make its legs walk forward
[2:25:38] why no christian preacher
[2:25:42] needs to preach the gospel
[2:25:46] and then try to make you live it
[2:25:49] it is none of my business what you do
[2:25:52] with what i preach
[2:25:56] that's between you and god
[2:25:59] but you know what you see
[2:26:02] you see preachers that will preach it
[2:26:04] why they would get
[2:26:15] but i don't have facebook so i can spy
[2:26:17] on the people i preach to you about
[2:26:18] facebook
[2:26:47] not when he does something wrong
[2:26:50] but when it's gonna overtake him
[2:26:53] then if you are spiritual you go to that
[2:26:56] man
[2:26:58] otherwise sweep your own steps mind your
[2:27:00] own
[2:27:11] listen you got your hands full with your
[2:27:13] own mess pay attention to that moment
[2:27:19] [Applause]
[2:27:22] some of y'all are probably sitting there
[2:27:23] wishing i was still sick and on the way
[2:27:24] out the door don't you well i wish this
[2:27:26] guy would just get out of here
[2:27:28] amen but i'm well now so here comes the
[2:27:31] preacher
[2:27:33] right amen watch us in questions and
[2:27:36] answers
[2:27:38] brother batman was dealing with the
[2:27:39] tabernacle about the gifts of the spirit
[2:27:57] but now here he is in 1961
[2:28:00] and the gifts are beginning to come back
[2:28:02] into the church
[2:28:05] now when the lord would fall on somebody
[2:28:09] and they would fall on them and they'd
[2:28:10] speak in tongues
[2:28:14] or prophesy
[2:28:15] sometimes they get it wrong
[2:28:19] so people were very nervous
[2:28:22] about how do you handle such things as
[2:28:24] that
[2:28:51] since i've been here in this church
[2:28:54] and and well i'll i'll just leave it
[2:28:58] like that
[2:29:01] all the things that prophet could have
[2:29:02] probably told us about his own people
[2:29:04] [Laughter]
[2:29:07] he said but you see
[2:29:09] you say now brother branham why didn't
[2:29:11] you correct this
[2:29:14] he says no no no
[2:29:17] when billy paul started walking back
[2:29:19] there
[2:29:32] but i believe he had a gift
[2:29:38] [Laughter]
[2:29:44] and then when he got to stumbling his
[2:29:47] big feet
[2:30:15] so brother bradham is saying
[2:30:18] you don't always jump in and correct
[2:30:21] everything you see when you think it's
[2:30:23] wrong
[2:30:26] i say this with great respects
[2:30:30] and great great honor to you as a mother
[2:30:33] and father
[2:30:36] i'm a daddy too there's mama sitting
[2:30:38] there
[2:30:40] but that's one reason some of our
[2:30:42] children not all of them now but some of
[2:30:44] them
[2:30:57] um
[2:31:09] and i know because i come up with his
[2:31:11] own children
[2:31:27] to him the knowledge of jesus christ
[2:31:31] we place our token over them
[2:31:35] and i can only hope and pray
[2:31:38] but eventually they'll make the right
[2:31:39] decisions
[2:31:47] [Applause]
[2:31:52] that's not the time to throw them in
[2:32:01] [Applause]
[2:32:20] all of our girls almost look like cookie
[2:32:22] cutters in the message
[2:32:26] all of them with a flat shoe
[2:32:30] an address from 1940
[2:32:35] come on
[2:32:51] jezebel you good for nothing jezebel
[2:32:54] well i got news for you women want to be
[2:32:56] pretty and they're built to be pretty
[2:32:58] developers
[2:33:00] and god made him to be pretty
[2:33:04] now if any of you brothers get that on
[2:33:06] you
[2:33:08] i'm holding a prayer service after this
[2:33:10] meeting very quickly
[2:33:14] right but if they do anything curl their
[2:33:16] hair
[2:33:31] i said you go back and tell her
[2:33:44] but we're not here to please everybody
[2:34:01] do you understand that you could not
[2:34:03] live good enough
[2:34:06] to ever please the lord
[2:34:10] you could not live clean enough
[2:34:14] to ever please the lord
[2:34:17] because it is not your righteousness
[2:34:19] that pleases him
[2:34:22] it is his righteousness
[2:34:25] that makes me pleasing to the lord
[2:34:52] [Applause]
[2:34:54] and more
[2:34:57] because susceptible one thing about it
[2:34:59] if a man is going to do a woman's going
[2:35:01] to do something wrong
[2:35:04] they don't carry a 72 inch into their
[2:35:06] bedroom or bathroom
[2:35:08] in television
[2:35:11] but this little baby right here is
[2:35:12] portable
[2:35:15] and you can set it to men's room of
[2:35:17] mcdonald's and go to the belly of hell
[2:35:22] did you get it
[2:35:24] you can go right into a restaurant
[2:35:27] mcdonald's you can say mcdonald's and
[2:35:29] friends right yeah go to the bathroom at
[2:35:31] mcdonald's
[2:35:33] take your phone in there
[2:35:35] and go right to the depths of hell
[2:35:38] nobody
[2:36:00] does that mean you should take a piece
[2:36:02] of glass or tin and scar your face up to
[2:36:04] keep some man from looking at you
[2:36:18] i had a friend of mine some years ago
[2:36:21] him and his wife are having all kinds of
[2:36:22] marital troubles
[2:36:25] this guy
[2:36:26] wore shoes that were absolutely
[2:36:30] horrible
[2:36:34] holes in them
[2:36:38] his pants were filthy all the time
[2:36:42] holes all in his shirt
[2:36:45] he would not take care of his teeth
[2:36:56] [Music]
[2:37:02] and then he tried to tell me
[2:37:06] i just want my wife to be
[2:37:08] intimate with me and tell me she loves
[2:37:10] me and kissed me on the mouth and i went
[2:37:13] oh my god
[2:37:18] if i told him if i was her i wouldn't
[2:37:21] want to kiss you neither
[2:37:25] how could anybody
[2:37:27] ever be attracted to a cesspool
[2:37:36] it's all the same thing cesspool trash
[2:37:38] jump
[2:37:41] sewage
[2:37:42] just pick your metaphor
[2:37:46] they they get most of it anyways i think
[2:37:50] brothers if you if you're looking for a
[2:37:52] wife
[2:37:54] there's this little invention called
[2:37:55] soap
[2:37:58] and it is just as spiritual as your
[2:38:00] prophet's message
[2:38:04] come on now
[2:38:06] there is a way
[2:38:08] that you can show yourself to be
[2:38:10] attractive
[2:38:14] [Applause]
[2:38:21] [Music]
[2:38:25] a boy is not even allowed to see a girl
[2:38:27] as beautiful
[2:38:30] how in the name of god are you supposed
[2:38:31] to get married
[2:38:33] oh well she's a good cook that's good
[2:38:35] enough for me you better know more than
[2:38:36] that
[2:38:39] come on now
[2:38:41] and brother she can be as pretty as she
[2:38:42] can be and have a rotten attitude

[2:38:52] about that car

[2:39:00] battery's badge you might ought to think
[2:39:02] about what your future looks like
[2:39:07] come on now
[2:39:08] but because we find ourselves to be
[2:39:11] spiritual people
[2:39:14] we think nothing in the natural even
[2:39:16] matters
[2:39:19] i'm gonna quote you a scripture right
[2:39:21] now

[2:41:49] floor and play barbie dolls

[2:41:55] place
[2:41:58] and don't have him just to throw on her
[2:41:59] lap and say she's the baby maker she'll

[2:43:28] and about 20 of it was doctrine
[2:43:33] even ephesians chapter one
[2:43:47] a little later
[2:43:56] you see that's what being spiritual
[2:43:58] looks like
[2:44:00] if you've got one god
[2:44:12] i mean if god's revealed to you the
[2:44:14] right baptism
[2:44:16] and you are baptized correctly
[2:44:19] you're not going to spend the next six
[2:44:21] months trying to figure that part out

[2:44:54] church
[2:44:56] the majority of you even some of you
[2:44:58] without the holy ghost
[2:45:01] you've got the right doctrine
[2:45:04] but you don't have the right spirit
[2:45:06] because you think god is your judge
[2:45:10] instead of being your father
[2:45:26] the
[2:45:42] and my father shows grace
[2:45:46] while i'm trying to walk
[2:45:49] he shows leniency
[2:45:56] it's just like education
[2:45:59] we tell people in this message education
[2:46:01] is of the devil
[2:46:05] and that is why people in our churches
[2:46:50] because we falsely accused brother
[2:46:52] branham of preaching that and he didn't
[2:46:54] know he's like
[2:46:56] what brother branham was against
[2:46:58] was people using education to explain
[2:47:02] god
[2:47:06] there are people sitting in this church
[2:47:07] right now that are probably absolutely
[2:47:09] completely intelligent
[2:47:13] but you have no ambition about yourself
[2:47:17] you think to be pleasing to the lord now
[2:47:19] sure as god made green apples i'm
[2:47:21] meddling
[2:47:23] but you have no ambition about yourself
[2:47:27] because you think it doesn't matter
[2:47:31] but jesus cares about such things as
[2:47:33] that
[2:47:36] listen to this
[2:47:37] in luke chapter 7 verse 19.
[2:47:41] can i go on a little bit
[2:47:43] i was going to anyways but i thought i'd
[2:47:45] be nice and ask first
[2:47:48] thank you for the mercy amen
[2:47:50] luke 7 verse 19.
[2:47:53] now this is john the baptist
[2:47:55] john calling unto him two of his
[2:47:57] disciples sent them to jesus
[2:48:42] ha there's things that happen
[2:48:46] disappointment he says
[2:48:49] that's what happens to all of us
[2:48:53] in your healing and things
[2:48:56] you'll find something didn't work right
[2:49:00] he's never experienced that
[2:49:01] things just didn't work right
[2:49:04] remember that's the enemy
[2:49:07] and god is permitting it to give you a
[2:49:09] trial
[2:49:24] and
[2:49:39] he sent two of his disciples and said go
[2:49:42] ask him
[2:49:44] now that was the poorest compliment he
[2:49:47] could have ever paid to jesus
[2:50:16] [Applause]
[2:50:33] jesus did not put him in hell
[2:50:38] he turned around and paid him the
[2:50:39] greatest compliment that could have ever
[2:50:41] been paid
[2:50:44] never was there a man born greater of a
[2:50:47] woman than john the baptist
[2:51:01] he understood where he was coming from
[2:51:05] oh now many of you are saying amen amen
[2:51:08] but what about you
[2:51:11] you think god don't understand where
[2:51:12] you're coming from as well
[2:51:15] now you got to give yourself the same
[2:51:17] grace if you're going to give it to john
[2:51:20] you got to give it to yourself
[2:51:23] the prophet tells us this
[2:51:25] he said isn't it wonderful he loves you
[2:51:29] before there was a world
[2:51:40] i got the log cut just a little bit more
[2:51:42] cutting to go we gonna go home but
[2:51:44] you just stay right in there with me
[2:51:46] just another minute or two
[2:51:47] listen i got a longer way to go than you
[2:51:49] all do so just bear with me
[2:51:51] he knows your nature
[2:51:54] he knows your weaknesses
[2:51:57] he knows your habits
[2:52:10] amen
[2:52:12] did you notice
[2:52:14] he never made an excuse
[2:52:18] well i can't use him
[2:52:20] he's got a bad temper
[2:52:23] moses had a temper
[2:52:26] david was an adulterer
[2:52:28] on and on and on
[2:52:32] right
[2:52:33] notice a perfect strike by the man says
[2:52:35] now we try
[2:52:37] we try to make our weaknesses an excuse
[2:52:53] i have no ability
[2:52:56] i am unable to do this
[2:52:59] now you know what's interesting
[2:53:01] everything brother branham is saying as
[2:53:03] though he's saying it about somebody
[2:53:05] else
[2:53:08] is all the things he said about himself
[2:53:12] i have no education
[2:53:14] no ability
[2:53:15] i can't do this
[2:53:18] brother said as long as you make those
[2:53:21] excuses
[2:53:29] so there's the other side of the fence
[2:53:32] yes well i'm no good
[2:53:35] i'm i'm i'm just a bad person
[2:53:39] well don't be so happy about it
[2:53:43] huh
[2:53:44] don't be so happy about it
[2:53:47] some people love to be miserable
[2:53:51] because for some demented reason they
[2:53:53] think that's being spiritual
[2:53:57] you can hear them when they pray
[2:53:59] oh lord i'm a miserable wretch
[2:54:02] i'm a sinner
[2:54:04] i'm low
[2:54:08] i've never seen people happier than when
[2:54:10] they are miserable
[2:54:13] they love putting themselves down
[2:54:16] well if we believe what this prophet
[2:54:17] says
[2:54:28] so why are you trying to remind him of
[2:54:29] the stuff he didn't care about in the
[2:54:31] first place
[2:54:45] it didn't stop him and he didn't care
[2:54:51] brother says like this we make excuses
[2:54:54] for our weaknesses
[2:54:57] and then god uses that very thing
[2:55:12] [Laughter]
[2:55:14] but we'll
[2:55:25] you're trying to say you can't
[2:55:27] accomplish nothing
[2:55:42] and learn to take a little risk in your
[2:55:44] life
[2:55:46] this is why some of you in this church
[2:55:48] have probably never spoke in tongues
[2:55:52] this is probably one reason many of you
[2:55:54] will never prophesy
[2:55:57] because you're not willing to get out of
[2:55:58] your own self long enough to let god use
[2:56:00] you to do something supernatural
[2:56:04] now i'm not saying you have to
[2:56:07] but some of you probably won't
[2:56:10] because you're
[2:56:25] to his full potential
[2:56:29] so let's quit making excuses then
[2:56:33] i can't do it
[2:56:35] well tell me something i don't know
[2:56:38] i'm insufficient
[2:56:52] preach to me a little bit i came to the
[2:56:55] world
[2:56:56] failing
[2:56:57] everything i put my hand to
[2:56:59] you
[2:57:00] that's not how i win
[2:57:03] i don't win by focusing on things that
[2:57:06] don't
[2:57:16] paul said brethren i count myself not i
[2:57:19] can't not myself to have apprehended
[2:57:25] but there's one thing i do
[2:57:28] for getting those things behind the only
[2:57:30] issues
[2:57:32] now i know
[2:57:34] let's say somebody has been molested
[2:57:38] or raped or some other kind of thing
[2:57:45] let's say somebody had
[2:57:47] great trauma in their life
[2:58:01] that as a christian
[2:58:15] amen do you ever notice how the devil
[2:58:20] did your past
[2:58:22] as a measuring stick for what you're
[2:58:24] going to be tomorrow
[2:58:28] listen to me carefully
[2:58:30] my
[2:58:52] [Applause]
[2:58:57] you may never forget that race
[2:59:01] if you are ever molested you may never
[2:59:04] forget that molestation
[2:59:06] but you in the name of the lord
[2:59:09] you can live with such powers
[2:59:12] [Music]
[2:59:26] look at verse 15. as many as be perfect
[2:59:31] [Music]
[2:59:32] now bible perfection
[2:59:35] does it mean sinless perfection
[2:59:38] it means maturity
[2:59:40] he who is going to be mature
[2:59:44] she that is mature
[2:59:47] let her be thus minded
[2:59:50] now i never heard brother baby say this
[2:59:52] till the other day
[2:59:54] in blasphemous
[3:00:00] we're done after this i promise
[3:00:01] preachers are liars i tell you i closed
[3:00:03] 40 times i'm lying through my teeth i'm
[3:00:04] going to close when the holy ghost is
[3:00:06] done
[3:00:07] but this is my last quote i promise he
[3:00:10] said we believe everything the bible
[3:00:12] says do no
[3:00:15] we are forgetting our weaknesses behind
[3:00:20] and pressing toward the mark of the high
[3:00:22] calling in christ
[3:00:27] you see the scripture says his mercy is
[3:00:29] new every morning
[3:00:34] so when my little bitty eyes go
[3:00:42] [Music]
[3:00:48] i just take them past weaknesses and say
[3:00:50] that was
[3:01:04] don't you understand you don't have to
[3:01:06] live under the weight of the past
[3:01:12] what are these little children
[3:01:14] instead of just walking on and going
[3:01:16] about their business
[3:01:32] well that might have been true but
[3:01:33] what's that got to do with now
[3:01:36] now that baby is walking
[3:01:39] that's what it focuses on
[3:01:42] it doesn't focus on the falls
[3:01:46] when you get your family albums out
[3:01:49] do you take pictures of when that baby
[3:01:51] was falling all over the place
[3:01:55] do you get your videos out
[3:01:57] and get a video of it
[3:02:01] and then show everybody look how stupid
[3:02:03] my child is
[3:02:05] look how ignorant this baby is this is
[3:02:06] the dumbest baby i've ever seen in my
[3:02:08] life
[3:02:10] you know what you say to it
[3:02:13] just a little while she's learning to
[3:02:14] walk
[3:02:17] just give her some time she's figuring
[3:02:19] it out
[3:02:20] maybe somebody might speak up and say oh
[3:02:22] yeah i remember when isaiah was walking
[3:02:25] that way
[3:02:27] i remember when old ben was stumbling
[3:02:30] along like that
[3:02:34] you know what they got the same daddy
[3:02:37] the one learned to walk and the other
[3:02:38] one will do the same
[3:02:42] that's the way it is with jesus folks
[3:02:45] he looks at your weaknesses
[3:02:48] and he lets you stumble along
[3:02:51] until you can figure it out
[3:02:54] and then when you figured it out
[3:03:09] not until you grow not until you get
[3:03:13] your big feet up underneath you where
[3:03:14] they belong
[3:03:18] and then you might hear a sermon
[3:03:21] that might remind you
[3:03:26] better get this thing fixed or i'm about
[3:03:29] to get in trouble
[3:03:33] anybody ever know when daddy was about
[3:03:34] to get him
[3:03:37] i could feel it before he walked in the
[3:03:39] dome
[3:03:42] i can feel the heat coming off his face
[3:03:47] he might have been a cool 98.6 but i
[3:03:50] could feel the fire
[3:03:54] and all of a sudden i'd hear that sound
[3:03:56] in the other room
[3:03:59] and i knew
[3:04:01] oh
[3:04:02] that leather is coming to me
[3:04:06] that's the way it is with jesus you know
[3:04:09] when you've overstepped your burdens
[3:04:13] when you have frustrated him
[3:04:16] to where he must deal with you
[3:04:20] but until then he does not whip you
[3:04:23] while you're trying to walk
[3:04:25] now if you want to walk out of here and
[3:04:27] accuse yourself of being no good and
[3:04:29] sorry in a rascally
[3:04:33] that's up to you
[3:04:35] but i have given to you the tools
[3:04:38] i've given to you the word and the
[3:04:40] ability
[3:04:42] to be able to walk out of here and be a
[3:04:44] brand new person
[3:04:46] if you want to be
[3:05:02] don't you blame the church
[3:05:05] because it's whether or not you want to
[3:05:06] walk whether you're going to do it or
[3:05:07] not
[3:05:10] you ever notice how with little kids
[3:05:12] those aren't
[3:05:13] so far they go through a stage we call
[3:05:15] cruising if it is
[3:05:20] [Music]
[3:05:24] these little idioms and things are hard
[3:05:25] to translate i know but he pulls himself
[3:05:28] up on the on the furniture you know
[3:05:38] and so mama she'll take all of her
[3:05:39] little pretties and she'll pull them
[3:05:40] back off the table
[3:05:44] she'll keep them just out of reach for
[3:05:46] that child
[3:05:47] so don't pull it in the floor
[3:05:50] that's why some things in the word are
[3:05:53] still out of your reach
[3:05:56] because if you don't learn to walk in
[3:05:58] this area
[3:06:00] then how can you know how to handle the
[3:06:02] pretties on the table
[3:06:06] so he'll sometimes keep things out of
[3:06:08] your reach
[3:06:11] until you get strong
[3:06:12] enough to know how to handle all of it
[3:06:16] i'm gonna tell you something friends
[3:06:18] i'm glad i serve this kind of daddy
[3:06:22] i said i'm glad i serve this kind of
[3:06:24] father
[3:06:27] and he is my champion of love
[3:06:30] amen and amen
[3:06:32] let's bow our heads together
[3:06:35] father we are so
[3:06:37] so grateful
[3:06:39] for how you speak to us by your words
[3:06:43] i've held the people a long time
[3:06:46] i pray that you'll reward them eternally
[3:06:48] for their patience today
[3:06:52] a lot has been packed into this service
[3:06:56] here we are 20 to 1 we start at 9 30
[3:06:59] there's been a long time here
[3:07:03] [Music]
[3:07:04] i pray you wouldn't allow this time to
[3:07:06] fall to the ground
[3:07:21] [Music]
[3:07:22] tire the sleepy the hour going around
[3:07:25] all of it was worth it
[3:07:27] if you can bring change in the lives of
[3:07:29] your people
[3:07:32] lord how we love you
[3:07:33] how we thank you
[3:07:35] and we pray you'll bless your children
[3:07:38] in jesus name
[3:07:40] amen
[3:07:41] amen amen and the church said amen
[3:07:45] stand to your feet with me will you
[3:07:47] brother brooks please forgive me for
[3:07:48] being so long-winded this morning
[3:07:54] [Music]

[3:08:07] 45 minutes to an hour brother ben 45
[3:08:09] minutes to an hour
[3:08:11] well did you ever hear this quote
[3:08:13] brother said sometimes you need a
[3:08:15] four-hour sermon to fatten you up
[3:08:22] you know what jesus brought us to the
[3:08:24] table today
[3:08:26] and we've been eating until i feel fat
[3:08:31] and i thank him for it
[3:08:33] god bless you so much
[3:08:35] it was not our desire
[3:08:38] to sound harsh
[3:08:44] [Music]
[3:08:45] mean
[3:08:46] spirited
[3:08:48] but listen to me children of god
[3:08:51] sometimes that's how the word comes
[3:08:54] up
[3:08:58] and makes a challenge to you
[3:09:01] to get you out of that complacency
[3:09:06] thank god he cares enough about me
[3:09:11] to shake me to my core if he needs to
[3:09:15] so you take what's been said now
[3:09:18] you apply it to your life
[3:09:20] and let this word change you from here
[3:09:22] on out
[3:09:24] let it change you let it bring a change
[3:09:27] amen will you do it put your hand up to
[3:09:29] the lord jesus

[3:12:58] thinking but you had to stay in the
[3:13:01] spirit to understand what he was trying
