TRANSCRIPT
========================================
except you put the blood on the doorposts in a little you should surely die you can say oh well I've been born uh uh Israelite I'm a Jew I'm from the stock of so-and-so God didn't care about that the voice said put the blood on the doorpost and the little whether you Jew or Egyptian if the blood is not found on the doorpost in a little the death dangers gonna get you hallelujah what would the voice what was the voice of Mercy the voice of Mercy was Jesus when he came to this day they had the Sadducees the Pharisees and Herodians they had all religious people and there were people who in appearance could outshine the believer hallelujah but jesus said except believe that I am he you shall likewise die in your sin it wasn't about your religion it wasn't whether you grandpa your grandmama or whatever was a leave iron of the Levitical priesthood of the family of Aaron it was you had to believe that Jesus was that angel of mercy is that right come on Simon honey you and I must understand when when it comes to mercy God has one door he always had one door right on the ark there was one door is that right in Egypt there was one door and Moses was that door hallelujah amen so you and I must realize there's only one goal in our day except you eat the book hallelujah except this mess has become your life there is no mercy now for those who plan to make a rapture you understand me we are living in such a time we ought to be expecting Jesus Christ at any time is what brother books I don't understand remember God said mercy to the churches seven churches and and later see it was the only one that had him Jesus cry only outside of his own church knocking trying to get in ah because it was a age where the woman ruled she ruled the world she ruled everything and now they're doing the same thing she rules the churches and where is Jesus on the outside trying to get in but realizing men what they did not understand is that Jesus did not come and then with nail pierced ears and you know bruises on his head or nail scar feet he came in a little Kentucky Oh y'all getting nervous when I say that I'm not saying that brother Brandon was God but he was a vessel that God used like he used Moses like he used Noah hallelujah he was hidden behind that veil he was that mercy that angel mercy hallelujah it's the truth who was the age of mercy to nineveh jonah jonah was not an ordinary man but he was a prophet God said them to Nineveh and Nineveh did what they did ever do they said God did it God placed him in a belly of a whale because he no knew that Nineveh worship the fish God see God will go all out of his way for you there'll be nobody at that day of judgment that will have an excuse when God says why not there will be no one who could say God you didn't do this and you didn't do that because God goes out of his way to get the people's a teacher hallelujah even before Scylla dies God reveals himself some way or another to inform him then they let them know that their days are limited but you know what they do they just push over it like it's nothing y'all hear me we ought to be in expectation remember Amen we are the bride who live you know we're not expected to be this are flamboyant our church this this church that that as they say looks fabulous no we're humble people we come amen from let's separate this way a race of shepherds meek and lowly and humble hallelujah but we're not those event that got a got a look or act in such a way that we draw attention to ourselves my fact most of the people that really will make a rapture won't have heart and nothing cuz they don't have nothing to lose now I'm gonna tell you like this God can make you a billionaire and he would do it if he knew you would him first God don't mind you making money God don't mind you even can be as rich as you want to be it's wrong you put Jesus first that's all God asked you don't worship the manner the Mammon but worship the God who gave gives it to you see I don't want anybody to think that I'm promoting uh or not ignorance or or anything like that or not having nice stages alright to have nice things don't let those nice things become your hindrance you say oh they won't be yeah they can be that guess why because that's what happened to Lot's wife she loved those worldly things more than she loved God we ought to be an expectation like that song I'm packing up the gate get ready to go the Prophet I said I'm not packing up I'm unpacking I'm not packing listen anybody knows of anyone who took a Cadillac with them when they die I don't care if they would bear it in it it didn't go with their hallelujah and you know I must realize this night or this morning a member it the most important thing that you need to have is your character one thing about the bride you don't have to make her worship you don't have to pump her up you don't have to beg her to give praise somebody give a praise no you don't have the bigger she's always ready she's always she's not just got a little bit of oil but she got all in the next royal hallelujah she's always there think about it that little girl who the rancher son I'm coming just a minute that little wretch of certain ranches a son went looking for a wife and and you know he y'all we all know the story found this little girl and what she was in the backyard she was a cousin to those who were the real fancy ones in our life and and she wasn't doing nothing but doing the dishes and things like that but it wasn't her outward appearance that caught his attention hallelujah you know that was one of the things I even went as a boy I thought because we had this Catholic Church around and you see those nuns they always looked so holy not anymore you know they don't hike their dresses up to somebody should have said Amen on and I did not even know that what they do they wear that veil but underneath the veil that got short hair where they cut it I was so shocked because what's the user having a rag over your hair and you cut me cut you hair you spill ball to god oh lord help me somebody what is it we don't love him like we used to that's the whole problem he he loves us he'll never stop loving us but we don't love him not the way we used to hmm when we love God God was the sin of attraction nothing could distract us we were God all the time we were so God minded that even our our family would call us fanatics when the last you've been called a fanatic and you and I must realize by God's grace that this is trimming time but trim off all of the world all the things that's not belong to God supposed to be trimmed off oh my it's the truth the like listen how many you can say well I'm shining the light Hill closing shining the light hears no character builds a time II meant that the saints of God was so holy their faces were illuminated would lie where is it like now y'all hear me what about that church the Bible says the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it we are that church but because we're not built upon stones and bricks we're not built upon some modern things like that but I revelation is to built upon who Jesus Christ is hello now I don't want you some of y'all looking at so tired y'all came how to make it but y'all get out there and you're talking yack yack yeah I could be refreshed once you get outside shame on you give God your energy here if you want to get sleepy get sleepy out the church give God your energy we look at these things and we said all brother Brooks and gates of Hell sitting over there mom because we are those Amen who are filled with the Holy Ghost will not have fallen will not have empty will feel those of us who are filled think about how those men when they were fighting how many mouths they thought they meant through those Philistines to give to just to give a drink of water to today they thought for miles hallelujah they brought back the water to David david says I'm so unworthy I can't drink this water and he poured it out on the ground giving God a drink offering well what was your attitude of been what would you add you mean to tell me I risked my life to give you some water and you pulled it out but David realized that God protect the dose with me that water did not cut they came by the hands of the men but God that water what's happening people I want you to look around at yourself now my point is some of us we can't make it to church but on Sundays but then when we come to church on Sundays what do we do do we really appreciate God because your action will show you know are you really thirsty are you really hungry do you really want God's anointing you can't get God anointed without pulling you can put a fish on the hook line amen and if you don't pull that fish in it's not coming even the woman at the well knew she had to do something and get that water from the bottom to the top and here God says I give you a well of water springing up out of eternal life Halle knew that means you don't have to work for this go come on up where is that well where is that water in us where is it the gates of Hell cannot prevail little bit rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it time you may come and go things may change but the gospel of Jesus Christ remains the same through all ceaseless ages upon this rock I'll build my church what was the church what was the rock what is your revelation of that what is our revelation of that all on Christ I saw that's what it is Christ is who Jesus is rock I stand all of the ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking saying yes I'm trying to get you to think because God said we'll be on fire where is the fire where is the fire where is your fire everybody where is your fire my point is Amen we need more than this well I'm predestinated understand if your predestinated something supposed to be going on in your life God is moving and he's building character God is pushing in and leading us amen to into the statue of a perfect man hallelujah is that right weren't you supposed to be there that's power that's praying knowledge low suffering all these things supposed to be radiant in us hey come on somebody when this light is turned off it don't be a light it will never express itself until the powers turned on and that's what God is expecting for us I'm not saying you're not a light but where is that light that illumination that can make me see that there is God in you let the truth Bob said they called them Christians at Antioch Wow they walked like Christ they talk like Christ they look like Christ healings was like Christ everything was like Christ so they didn't have to call themselves Christians somebody else did is that right coming to church don't make you a Christian though right you and I must understand there must be an intimate relationship between you and God now it sounds like I'm fussing I'm not I'm trying to encourage you my voice may sound like I'm screaming I am I'm a eagle my point is but I'm trying to say it's urgent it's urgent don't get slack now you're too close to the finishing line right hallelujah you can't get slack now your goal is in reach yes you're tired but you take that runner you take that runner he's been running a long time and now he's he's almost and you got that crowd says come on you can make it you can make it give it give it all you got I love hearing that give it all you got somehow that helps you cause down somewhere there there's some reserves you think you can't move it you think you can't run any faster but there's some reserves that your mind goes down and get and all of a sudden you picking up those steps and you find yourself breaking the line that's where we are we're so close bombs find everywhere all nations it is almost every little small nation now can can can can shooter armed atomic bomb at us it ain't just America anymore you say hello what are you saying remember brother branham said whatever we sold we're going to reap it and what did what did America so the atomic bomb hallelujah what do we do not long ago in Afghanistan we dropped all kinds of bombs and wiped out people that's why you don't hear much about them anymore our country is no longer speaking like a lamb she's a dragon and if she's turned her change her nature into that how far are we from seeing the Pope raise up how far we a men from seeing a man these organizational churches stop us from preaching it's coming people brother Branham said I can hear the combine what is a combine is that machinery that gather in the wheat and throughout the shock you and I must realize hey man there's a pressure coming and if you don't take inventory right now just like those foolish virgins you're gonna find out you don't have enough oil and that oil Amen is the thing that keeps your lighter burning who is this okay oh my when God said jesus said unto Simon bar Jonah blessed are you simon barjona because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you we must not understand the greatest revelation that we have received in this day is the revelation of who Jesus is [Music] why because when you get that revelation down in your soul you realize Amen that you are not part of a denomination you're not part of an organization I'm not a part of a what you call a message called I'm not part of any of that my body belongs to God I don't care about what other message churches do I am no gain to make sure this one see Jesus I'm not an organization they can do what they want to do where y'all servicing like this ain't got to be that way did y'all understand that as they ain't got to be that way and that's just what I meant you and I must understand Amen by the grace of God that the Holy Spirit is supposed to be moving this church huh the Holy Ghost supposed to be moving this church Oh sisters let me tell you something even in a New Testament church they had prophetess huh they had spiritual women they weren't all about always about the kitchen they had spiritual women that love God so don't feel like oh I'm out of it no you're not what if God wants to use you well they don't do it like that over there the other other church I don't care about that we are interested in seeing the body of God move I'm not calling you a preacher I'm saying there are gifts that need to be displayed but until we get spiritual garden gonna use it male or female you understand me this must be a spiritual church a Holy Ghost Church if it's not the Holy Ghost Church is not a church at all that's why I preach about it a lot because I know that if we saw into the form of a religion we're dead but as long as we can get the water of God flowing through us as long as the Holy Ghost is still moving hallelujah it doesn't mean we got a shower run up and down the aisle but my point is there should be enough Holy Ghost in this place that I could feel it from here today I come to be different I am different you ought to see yourself different that's why I don't like all that Facebook and face chat and face all that tweet and Twitter listen cuz you get all the garbage of the message you get all the junk and that stuff get in you and you can't even get out you come to church and you wonder why can't I praise God now I didn't say that he said it cuz I don't even have that in my note and it wasn't even in my mind these things are distracting you and you don't even know it listen what the proper God says oh praise be to God I like his spirit God yes it's appropriate for a minister to worship God from the pulpit with Thanksgiving and praise and on and light oh how real how it just thrills my soul that I feel like I could could scream and run and jump as high as I could jump because there is something within me that changed me from what I was I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but I know I've been changed from what I used to be see something has happened something taken place you and I must understand Amen that Enoch walked with God he's your brother Brooks how can I walk with God let's put it this way when Adam and Eve sinned the Bible said the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening Adam we're out now that voice of God as we know was Jesus Christ himself it was God there's only one voice seven-fourths 2007 church ages but there was one blast seven voices but it was only one voice and you know I realized by God's grace that when God talks to us I hope he does all of us is that small still voice and when that voice talks to us you and I we supposed to be able to know that that's his voice not say oh is that you Lord no you supposed to know when God talks to you you heard him and you're supposed to be obedient to it that's how you with God hallelujah you show up presents Adam here advice let me taste them you won't even know his voice until you know the things he would say when the prophet of God came he came not with his own voice he came with God's voice when I hear brother branham it's not that I'm listening to the tones and everything of his voice that's God a voice in a voice you understand me it's like prophecy it's like any preacher it's not my voice you listening to its divorce in the voice that's right sister and you now ought to be able to hear it you don't hear it you don't hear God you got to be able to hear God well I don't believe that your attitude is reflected in heaven I don't have to judge that but my point is when you come to this church and you don't hear what God is saying why do you come you come to hear me I'm flesh and blood I make mistakes all the time the whole point behind me getting me hot in this sacred nest is that the Holy Ghost would come down and come through this like brother Keisei jaws of play that you might hear his voice my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow right here he says Amen in the message of power transformation he said whatever you do don't let the devil spray you spray you with education and poison and stuff like that you don't have to be modern you don't have to be this you don't have to be nothing but sons and daughters of God and if you're born of the word you do right see what we don't we fail to see Amen that this is a great time everybody has money everybody can do this and everybody can do that and money flows it from everywhere big cars and everything there won't be one of them in that city there won't want me not one car not not one airplane right no it'd all be together a different civilization See Mom because we're living on sides and we don't understand we don't worry be careful science will become our God well you know the doctor said I got this and that the other you believe that oh if I don't do this don't you know medication is flu so much I don't understand I was I got to slow down just like they heard the day I'm like here it is when they give you a commercial or something that you looking at this as well this medicine so and so and so it calls its - it calls its fainting it calls it also it calls us this it causes that it calls its this it causes that he just grabbed by the time the list is like that and then at the end of it what you want to take it is good for you yeah that's the truth they tell you about all of these side effects the medication because it may cause II they put it in me like you know but it ain't gonna be me it's really not gonna be me it might cause this with somebody else but you see what I'm saying it's so easy when God said have faith in God we are of a faith civilization how civilized nation is faith like Abraham we call those things that be not as though they were why am I gonna to put something in me in my system that's gonna destroy me at the end of the day ain't happening not going to happen you crazy bro maybe I am but before I let them put radiation in me when I know radiation is cancer itself I rather die believing in Jesus y'all hear me Oh a brother Bruce it's gonna be painful when did you find death not being painful they call it the pains of death and you know I must understand we cannot die we're living in an age where we call the spoken word age and I'm looking at where is it you and I have the ability to speak it we have the authority now you don't believe it ain't happening to you brother madam said the King's sword takes faith it takes a strong hand of faith to make it work and because you lacking some substance or lacking something that you ask God for don't blame God faith will produce it but when we don't have patience to wait and when we don't have have it understand that everything is in God's own timing God don't move by you you move by God escape he said who and he was holding up the rapture who was holding up the rapture somebody's holding you rapture oh I can't hardly wait to the rod to come well you don't wanted to come in you're not living right you're not thinking about you're not walking like you've no wanted to come then the rapture is coming for a holy people of people who are excited about his coming remember that little girl she was already in the door this is about the right season and he's coming she's got her garment all and she's waiting everybody laughed you too religious you got this met the other she didn't care all she could say he promised and look how low the prophet of God is going to glory how long has been do you think we've gotten long time it was late in the evening then things have gotten much worse than that now that then how much more evil can this world take and this evil if you're not faithful in God is going to slow walk you y'all know what I mean by that it will snow walk you little by little you got to realize that Satan is a serpent and serpents slither they move so soft and so slow you don't even hear them coming the next thing you know they up on you're ready to bite that's how sin does seeing the devil don't say hey I'm the devil dude don't you want to party with me nah he doesn't work that way it's just a little at a time it's the truth a little at a time you'll find yourself moving to that music of the world patting your feet a little bit the next thing you know you move it a little bit whoo then ain't nobody around you go go at it that's how it starts little at a time a little video here little something there God the devil don't don't don't expose himself until he's in you or when he done caused you to fall and he's cause you stupid you know better than that why did you do that he's your first accuser and he's the one that made you do it I know you feel bad yeah I feel bad cuz I'll let you make me do this y'all understand what I'm saying but you have to go out to the devil he can't come in if you in this sense Oh Lord the probably God said here God is waiting on us excape I'm gonna get out of this situation because I'm gonna tell you something when satan ties you he doesn't tell you it does simple knot where you could just unloose it easily he's got a professional knot and you don't you don't easily get out of that night you don't get out of that hole unless God comes oh yeah is that the right the Bible said it's the Holy Spirit God who's able to break the tempters snare hallelujah he's the only one Amen that can break the chains that Satan wraps insane he's the only one and I'm gonna tell you something don't be like the Titanic you think that this whole ship can't can't be sunk there's a lot of people wishing like a brother told me not long no I was so shocked to him but basically he was trying to tell me Amen that hell is your imagination is just something you imagine and I said to myself I didn't said to him but I thought to myself I wish I know those people in here wish it was imagination wish that they could come out of it and that's the saddest thing because there's a lot of people who thought they would never go there and they're there just by one thing wearing high-heeled shoes when you all not do y'all love it see you can't go to heaven I'm almost done I'm not gonna keep you long you can't go to heaven back culture no culture it's not gonna I don't care if your culture is the highest level of morality it ain't getting you you could have bigges of dollars that you came by not one seat up there the only way that a man a woman can get to heaven you've got to be born again you say this message is so simple I want it to be simple because that's how Jesus message is worth it was so simple they couldn't even believe that he was God can you imagine sitting up in church and he'll preacher preaching on seeds and everything you know CDs calling your preacher the devil and then he's telling you all has a win gold and as it comes you would never if you warner dave is him as Jesus Christ she would have never seen it you're talking to him and he said well if you're gonna you gonna follow me I don't I don't have no big Church thing where I can put you up in there I'm kind of nice in or something he said I ain't got nothing he said foxes have holes and birds have nests but the Son of Man II he ain't got nobody nowhere to lay his head I don't even have a house you gonna follow me how many of us would have followed him you understand me because now we see the people follow those ones with the big bling blings and big ol chains and all that that rich and driving in the Cadillac and got they women you know like they're you know street prostitutes following them and all that rule Oh Reverend but what about that man who's clean what about that man who's simple who don't have much you know that's why brother branham kept it simple he could he had millions thrown at his feet but he kept his lifestyle simple huh that's why God didn't come down here looking like a Elvis Presley the Bible said there was nothing beautiful for him to look at Jesus he went pretty he wasn't a pretty boy about according to the Bible there was nothing that was gonna attract you to him other than the world that's why God a man he said give me unleavened bread because they not gonna track you to the little bit or a take cinnamon bread and ain't all sweet it ain't all that kind of stuff puffed up is simple on leaven read the Word of God is so simple a day you know meaning a it ain't got all this extra stuff but what's gonna make you love it what's gonna make you eat it which Satan in this data have trance he changed everything anyway we're being changed we're being transformed to do what translate he translated and here here in our walk with God and you sure what brother books hop how did he hear the voice of God God gave involved he didn't have this but then God in our day comes and give us a voice give us something to listen to now I don't know whether you've ever had the experience but I have I've had the experience of listening to a tape going through something didn't even know what I need it was on the tape and it's like the voice speaks directly to me there was a time amen I was running I fell and I hurt my neck so much amen to the doctors wanted to do an operation on my neck and I said God ain't nobody gonna operate on my neck that certain things it won't do ain't gonna do they're not gonna operate on my knee and they're not gonna operate on my neck no and you said what do you mean I go to God before I go to them I was down at Tim Cruz church down there in Louisiana and the Holy Spirit so thick you could cut it with a knife and I'm back in the back with all the old people and the Holy Spirit I heard it boys something say jump I say jump jump jump I jumped a few times and that pain left me it's never been back since you tell me God is not real the preacher didn't tell me the job but that voice did mmm like I was telling one time before Amen way back when I needed a job and everything else and I went to this hotel because the law said you you choose who you want to work that's what people don't understand you can choose where you want to learn I chose to work at this certain place I walked in there fill out my application and I tell you I had on our jacket that was pretty out there but God told me to wear it he said wear this this this and this you know why because God knew what the manager likes when it comes to appearance and I put on that certain outfit and I walked in there fill out the application amen and at the end of the day the man said more I'm so sorry I you know we would love to hire you we went over your application we would love to hire he said but but we have no opening I went oh no I didn't I knew God sent me there I didn't know how it was gonna work out I didn't know how I was gonna open the door he did by the time I got home he had already called my wife and told her to come back to tell him to come back we we got a job offer one that was one of the best jobs I ever had in my life when I got back there he said I'm gonna tell you what made me hire you he said because you came in and here confident he said the clothes you wear this jacket this IDI just tell me everything God told me where the buried the best job I ever had was at that particular place now understand me see when God talks to you it's not yy-you say what brothers what do you say that's what what's happening now those who are I God's been talking to you but you've been not listening you're not been listening you got to hear him you gotta obey Him you gotta walk if you want success in your life do what he said to do it ain't got nothing to do with logic or reasoning he told brother branham he said pick up a rock thrown up in the air all of a sudden the whirlwind comes that's not logical why would I throw a rock up in there because God says huh he told that he told Elijah throw the throw wrong piece of wood in the in the river through a piece of wood in the river and the axe head comes up that's not logical that's faith and that's the kind of civilization we live in we live in a in a faith civilization not science one plus one is two that's man's math God turns it the way he wants to it could mean to the man but it could mean one to God a husband and a wife one plus one equals one see God knows what he's doing and we try to figure him out my point is in closing we've come to be changed if you're not gonna let God change you you don't expect the rapture he comes to change you he will transform you he would translate you now we sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and when you're setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know what you're doing you looking down at the devil not up at him because he's made you fall you're looking down at the devil yeah there were other things I needed to say but I'm gonna hold off until this evening let me say it like this people there is not a preacher I don't know I don't know a preacher maybe somebody but nobody's gonna love you like I do as a pastor I'm not arrogant I'm not proud the humility that I have is not some cloak I put on but I care for every soul in here my desire to see everybody make heaven I may not be perfect in the way that you want me to be perfect but I could truly tell you that the love of God in my heart is if I do something I'll say something in this church is because I love you and I mean it and God has told me to say it and I'll be honest with you you know what I was telling somebody the other day I said you know what I was one of the most famous and most popular preachers in this message at one time but in that I saw that was a click there's a circle and y'all may not see it but that's what it really is and if you get in there you can hardly ever get out but in there you can't always do the will of God because this brother don't tell us it with that brother well you can't be a part of that that means I had to either stay a part of that become rich and famous like a lot of the ones have done or just be who I am sitting up in this little place here called higher ground am i ashamed of this little place absolutely not am i ashamed of you absolutely not I always brag on this little church wherever I go you know what I tell them God has given me quality Christians because that's what I believe I'm not looking at your failures I'm looking at your hearts it's what comes from your heart I asked God I said Lord if I'm gonna be a pastor I want to see the people hard I want to see what's in their heart because we're not all all i know is that in your heart you tried to make heaven like i make heaven trying to make Evon that's all I need to know look around you where are the troublemakers God has gotten rid of all the troublemakers I don't I'm not I'm not I don't wanna see no troublemaker go to hell if they repent and come back they're more than welcome but you don't know how blessed you are we're blessed oh we don't have this and we don't have that well maybe God don't want to have this and that but I do want one thing out of us I want us to be family and I want us to love one another I I can't demand respect from then none of you sometimes y'all you don't even know what I'll be hearing from this pulpit but I pray that someday somewhere before God comes God will be revealed to you that I am really your pastor because that's what some of us need to know you sure what brother Brooks you're not here all the time but you know what when I leave here if I'm not here at this church I'll be at somebody else's church oh I meant some post of duty that God got me I'm not out here you know going to Carowinds and you know see the points no I'm on the battlefield for the Lord most of the time when I go places there are no there is no time to rest it's a constant I have people all over the world calling me for counseling I don't shut them down because I passed a higher ground no a brother or sister they need help I'd give them help I'm not gonna even even got everybody that really knows me if I got money to give or give you I'll give it if I don't have it I don't have anybody know me they know that so don't let the devil make you think that something's I'm partial or anything like that that that is the devil you
