[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] every day [Music] [Music] man take up your cross and follow Jesus amen as we stand we think I'll for His grace and His mercy appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he has done and is doing for us I very seldom divorce but I brought back some some scar I guess if you want to say it like that amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus for it's Grayson and I can show you by God's grace on how if you want to listen to those messages that were spoken during that time I give you the aptitude for the shelley's Church after after service God is good to us I know my brother Keith is travelling either that or he's just at home resting I know we've been traveling in today's weather has not been the best weather to travel probably from not his angle but if you would turn with us to acts the first chapter we'll go there then we'll go to Matthew 26 and then to Ezekiel 18 acts 1 and 8 I am truly a believer and I do believe with all my heart that we're living in the last days I do believe that God's it's God is trying to move us along if I could say it that way the battles are what they are I don't think it's going to get any easier but I know that each and every one of us are perhaps battling in our own special way everything is pattern and cut for your for you personally everybody have different trials and tests but let us read acts 1 and 8 it says but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Matthew 26 and 41 it tells us to watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak ezekiel 18:20 then we'll let you be seated by God's grace ezekiel 18:20 it says the soul that sinneth it shall surely die we're just gonna take that portion of the scripture and let us pray it shall die dear Jesus we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we appreciate everything you do for us Lord we pray tonight that you would have recourse give us Grace and strength as we journey Lord in this way bless each and every soul here tonight we pray father God that your perfect will be done in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we like to entitle the message tonight strength of the soul and we know by God's grace that the man man in itself is composed of three components which is the Trinity which brings us to a perfect man because if you only had a body then then you would be dead and if you had no spirit you would be comatose in the soul is just there nowhere no way to express itself without a spirit or body but the Bible tells us that the soul that sinneth it shall die and we know by God's grace that the sin in itself is not drinking smoking lying thieving sin in itself is unbelief those things in which I named are the attributes of sin you still you lie you cheat because you don't believe now we realized the Bible tells us that we were born in sin that means we were conceived in unbelief Eve disbelieved God's Word and by so doing she brought forth what we see now we are a product of unbelief that's why when we see children you don't have to teach them to lie you don't teach them to steal you don't teach them to be jealous because of the sin nature that's within them the soul in itself may have an attribute of God in it but until that soul is converted that individual will bear the image of the children of Wrath we will always appear to be sinners until we are born again you and I must understand there's a man by the name of Nicodemus who was a Pharisee the Bible said he came to Jesus by night and he asked a question how can I inherit the kingdom of God and then Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again and he began to break it down remember now this is a new doctrine Nicodemus being of the top schools like Harvard and Yale of his day had never heard this term born again and here was Jesus who didn't have an education telling this man you a thing or two that he didn't know uh because Nicodemus says well let me ask you a question how must I be born again must I enter my mother's womb again be born now that might sound like a silly question but I believe that all of us would have asked a question like that or something similar because we don't know no other way of coming into this world or being born we came from my mother and so Jesus said no Nicodemus that which is Flash's flesh and that which is Spirit is spirit we're talking about two levels of things we talked about two worlds or things we're talking about something that that that only the Spirit can reveal unto you but I say to you Marvel not you must be born again so we realize by God's grace amen that the soul in itself we we know that it came into this place amen our with an attribute of God in other words the Holy Spirit is the thing that either quickly quickens what's in your soul because if God is in your soul it were quick in God and if the devil is in your soul which is a serpent it will quicken the devil you say well what do you mean so that you understand the Bible said that that rain falls on the just and the unjust right the same rain waters corn and wheat is the same rating that waters the weeds and the tares and all have been created by God all right but it's what's in the soul the thing that's in the soul is the thing that determines what you'll be in the end is that right because a corn can't change itself from being a corn whatever seed is in it it is what it is or watermelon or whatever the seed is it is what it is so you and I must understand Amen this thing have been pre-planned however we want to say it but God knows that no matter how bad you looked or how bad you were before you was a Christian the Lord knew and knows them that is in other words he sowed the seed he was the planter he sowed the good seed and Satan sowed the bad seed and so people want to blame God but I'm gonna tell you God did not sow the bad seed even though he knew the outcome hallelujah is that Alright oh it's the truth now you and I must understand that the soul is that part of you that either has faith or doubt and of course brother Branham used it sometime interchangeably especially before after before 63 he worked with the spirit of it after 63 he worked with the soul and he showed us that the soul is the only thing that has one element in it is either faith or doubts right but the Spirit has five outlets and so does the flesh have out five outlets right there was a time a man said that he couldn't believe anything he couldn't feel smell taste see and hear right he can't believe it you know and he said don't it's tough to the properties that don't tell me nothing about faith because I don't want to hear about faith because if you can taste it I need to know how to taste it if you can if you know if I can see if you can see it then I need to let me see it but if God is real you say you've seen it you said you real let me see him as real as you are he said otherwise I don't believe it in other words if my five senses doesn't declare god to me I'm not gonna believe it right and the prophet of God says let me ask you something can you feel your mind he says no can you see your mind no can you taste your mind no he said well according you you don't have no mind right if I came feeling at the mind if I can't see how do you know it's real oh I know it's real see so therefore I know God is real right and he took a pin and he stuck to me with the P and they said ah he said the men wanted to fight him at that time he said he said I didn't feel that he said you didn't you not the one that got stuck he said that's the point you can't declare something that's not real unless you experience it whether you you see it the way I see it but you got to experience what I experienced and then you'll see that God is real right understand that the gates of the soul is the eyes are the eyes you and I must understand the Bible tells us that Eve she saw that the fruit was good and pleasant to the eyes right that's why the Bible tells us to watch and pray hallelujah because it is by the eyes you either receive into your soul what you're looking at right or you reject it right and the Bible tells us according to the Word of God says that we ought to pull down bring everything down put it under our feet whatever the strongholds put it on the Oh feet right any and everything that exalts itself above the Word of God is that Alright and let me go on to say so that you understand that reasoning is the enemy of the word hello it can't be right because that's what he did she reasoned the word what do you mean she processed it God never told you to do that God said have faith have faith in God have faith is all of our faith faith doesn't reason faith accepts it right hey faith is not you don't have to see it right because faith cause those things that be not as though they were it's whatever the Bible says it is that's exactly what it is right now you got to understand if you and I we the weak we if we fail if we shut down reasoning when it comes to the Word of God we would basically be perfect it is our reasoning our processing trying to process God and His Word that gets us in trouble hey that's the truth the devil said amen to Eve surely you will not die at that moment when she accept that surely you will not die she accepted the Serpent's reasoning oh yeah and some people say if it's not logical I can't believe it well you'll never believe it right because really what's logical about anything in this world so people try to reason God's Word and try to formulate some imagination that they they just dreamed of in other words they evolution they'd rather dream up some some lie then they believe that God said Let there be it's just the reasoning and they can never come up with the end or a conclusive of fact of when it comes to evolution because they think that we evolved then if we evolved then when when we stopped evolving because it got to be more to a man than what he is now and for the last six thousand years he seemed to be the same he looked the same walked the same smell the same he's the same right I mean he sure Oh what about our intelligence hello we're dumb compared to the ones in the days of the ant alluvion flood hallelujah they built pyramids they actually built the Sphinx and all of these things that they survived the flood what can man make that can actually survive such a flood we cannot even survive the kind of love brought on our level of disaster or less the whole world Alleluia so you understand reasoning is the thing that Satan's made you on right oh oh listen Mary and Martha did the same thing they said when Jesus said come if you want to see something I'm going to show you I'm the resurrection and the life and Mary Martha just for a moment times as Lord but he's been dead for days what that has to do with God when God says something that's exactly what he means hallelujah what a Peter with a reason long if that be you bid me come hallelujah but Peter did not huh it was only after he started walking he began to look around and reasoning struck him this is not possible it should not be and the moment he thought those things at the time he began to sink but he still had a vision of the word he cried as his lord save me see when it comes to the two saving you I don't reasoning only the Lord Jesus Christ and his word can save you and pull you up out of reasoning right so it's the truth think about Israel if Israel had only obeyed God's Word the Bible tells us Amen endure on Deuteronomy 10 12 through 17 and now Israel what does the Lord thy God require of thee but to do what but to fear the Lord thy God to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul Oh Oh y'all know what all mean it means all when you give all that means there's no room for nothing else right oh my to keep the commandments of the Lord in the statute which I can and this day for thy good behold the heaven and the heavens of heaven is the lords that God their earth also with all that they're in yes now what if what if Joshua would have tried to reason his position when he was in battle now I know I need some more sunlight and ain't no way this you know he didn't think about it he stood then says son stand still hallelujah how many times you've been almost in a wreck and and you don't even have the time to say Lord stop the car you just said Jesus right you don't even reason that you know God or the name of Jesus is powerful and it can stop the car God already knows the heart before you speak it hallelujah when you call on him on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's always there to rescue you has nothing to do with the reasoning think about it I'm talking about Hebrew boys what was it they were so sold out to the Lord and it didn't reason they just know one thing I'm not going to bow to the image why because the Lord said know the LORD thy God is one they knew that Israel knew that worship the Lord thy God and him only they knew that and they didn't reason it listen it doesn't matter about the multitude if you understand history you find out the multitude was always wrong righteous people the right people always come in small numbers hallelujah it ain't a big thing it's a small thing is that right think about it right listen he says only the Lord had a delight excuse me he says behold the heavens in the heavens of heavens is the Lord thy God and earth also with all that therein is only the Lord had a delight in their fathers to love them and he closed chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day he said sure sighs therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffening what are you saying people on the game that's exactly what he's saying circumcise the foreskin of your heart because remember the four skins of the male that was circumcised was God in symbolic of God circumcised in your heart right in other words God was cutting off the Serpent's part come on somebody and so if you can see that you understand by God's grace that God is calling for a total surrender from all of us for the lords of God is God of gods and Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a terrible with regarded not person nor take certain ones you can't breathe you can't you can't bribe God hallelujah he can't be here God if you just do this I'll do that you should never make such a promise why because we are failures to begin with we make fake we make mistakes every day thank God for the blood of Jesus right like I said it is the blood of Jesus Christ that pulls us out of our reasoning that gets us out of the trouble our reasoning has gotten us into it's nothing but the truth for the Lord your God is God of gods now casting down like second Corinthians 10:5 I'm not going to be long tonight casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing it into the captivity of every thought to what the obedience of Christ there you go see without the Holy Ghost you can't do this only Christ can pull every imagination every thought everything that exalts itself against the word you said or what do you mean when you have given your heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ and the devil say you nothing hypocrite then it's your duty to remind the devil pull that thought back put it under your foot and says no sir I've been saved not only saying now but I was saved then right and the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me from all unrighteousness you've got to preach back to the devil because the devil brings reasoning and sometimes he builds a good case against you and the Bible has already said we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God our righteousness is out of ourselves hallelujah whoa somebody help me here our righteousness is of God he became our said and I've had plenty of it that we might become the righteousness of God he gave it to me I'm going to wear it reasoning like I said is the act or process of a person you know mean you you trying to figure it out there's a process for me in your mind like a mathematical equation right and then you come out two plus two is four right but what about God's Way God multiplies hallelujah he said well how does God multiply God multiply in such a way to every number he multiplied comes out to be one is that right the Bible says there was a number that no man could number that was in the bride and it was one bride so God's mathematic does not equals man's mathematics man's mathematic kids only get him somewhere maybe in this dimension maybe the fourth dimension right we know that demon power travels through fourth dimension so now they can actually do things in the fourth dimension and bring it into this dimension by technology right seeing things and seeing angles that you and I can't see but the computer is programmed way that it can take those things that you put out there and bring him into existence I think Troy just built up what was it that you built at your house huh a printer right but that printer had to be able to see something that we couldn't see with our natural eye another part of that drawing or whatever the case may be we can see it 3-dimensional but it had to go into another dimension to bring it here so that we can feel it and see it and you know what I'm saying so you and I understand by God's grace and then this word that we have is the only word how can I say it it translates your soul right so because once you are once you and I'm coming to something here once you have been baptized with the Holy Ghost sealed however you want to put it it literally translates your soul into another dimension and what God is trying to get us to do is work the works that he would work from that dimension you understand me in that dimension amen that's what Abraham did he was able to call those things that be not as though they were is that right remember when Abraham was up there to offer Isaac Isaac was the Lamb of God in this dimension but in the other dimension the Lord said I have prepared myself I love that in other words God Himself came as a sacrifice hallelujah and he took a ram from somewhere and brought it in visual and in this third dimension it was so real which it was real Abraham was able to sacrifice that ram unto the Lord will somebody help me you said what are you talking about Jesus though he was in this dimension hallelujah he knew that all power in heaven and earth was given unto him way before he was crucified hallelujah why because he was the Lord of glory oh my caboose about it he could reach into that other dimension because his faith and his soul says yes hallelujah when your faith in your soul says yes all things are possible is that right you say Oh Lord I believed I'm healed well if you believe you heal you I heal wait for the manifestation of it hallelujah look look Jesus went into that dimension I don't know how he did but I could hardly wait to see what that bread tastes like hallelujah but you know it had to be good the bread and fish had to be good he didn't he didn't come it didn't come up like dough it came up as hot bread and fish come on say the multitude Wow because he stopped understand it is our duty to stop thinking like men and start thinking like gods we are not regard but we are portion of him we are the offspring according to acts right we are the offsprings of God is there anything too hard for God hallelujah that's why he taught his Saints he taught his disciples whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it it will be given unto you but the Bible tells us that in our patience possess ye are so right because faith and patience got to work if you ask for something you gotta wait only we don't know how long it took for this world to come into existence but it came and it had to come cuz God spoke it hallelujah so is it with the believer hallelujah is that right think about it Elisha under that anointing said it will not rain a drop of rain until I call for it what is it he recognized who he was and that's the thing that the bride of Jesus Christ need to come into recognizing who she really is is not my power is not by might but it's by my spirit saith the Lord you understand me you've got nothing to do with it it's the only thing you need to do is let your soul love the Lord with all your heart come on love it with all your heart with all your mind with all your strength hallelujah and your never doubting hmm is that right so you got to understand well brother saw in someone like I was saying this the other day sometimes we all gifted we all got different gifts some got more than the other and there's no reason why we should compare ourselves one with another that's foolishness right because you didn't give yourself that gift every good and perfect gift come from God right and understand when you're born again when you really see God everything leaves you accept the gifts in which God gave you that remains but all of your old self has to die in a rot right I'm coming to something here second Corinthians 10:12 says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise it is not the will of God hallelujah i'ma show you that's why even the prophet of God said he didn't want to have nothing to do with that kind of a thing I got a quote for you coming Amen from the Palmer where I'm a locust in caterpillar he said I have nothing against the voice of healing but the trouble with the voice of healing here's what I got away from it here's what I got away from it he's saying this is why I got away from me it glorifies the man instead of Christ hmm Christ is what we want to get glory in other words we're not anything without it he's gotta be the all in all they need a prophet day and a king Dana priest hello the Bible tells us when the lamb took the book according the Book of Revelation right the fifth chapter I believe it is the Bible said are the 12 24 elders took the crown and they threw them down why because they realize everything that he they had accomplished was not by human effort but everything they accomplished is because of the grace of God and you got to understand if you get to heaven it ain't because you work so righteously it ain't because you thought he was just holy holy no shot it was because of the grace of God and the election of God is what takes us there hallelujah and if that be the case we are all in the same pot like they say part can't call kettle black right that's it we all in the same pot and if we're gone is that right the Bible said all sin I'll have seen is that right Revelation says there was no man upon the earth that was worthy worthy to loose the seal or to look down upon nobody was worthy there's only one where are they and that's Jesus Christ our Lord and the Bible said we are accepted in the beloved not by your watch not by your deeds even though we do ours we do Hardys is only because we want to show God our gratitude we're grateful that God has had mercy upon us hallelujah is that Alright so you understand he said they said he said in Christ is what we want to get glory this man got a tent and out this seat this one out see you know how people who I got so many over here and I got so many I got a bigger Church than you I got a greater following nonsense it makes us nothing right we're nothing but six foot of dust by the mercy of God he said if we got what we deserve we'll be we would be in hell every one of us trumpets in all hello amazing grace that's all his amazing grace you know I think God for every victory I have had in my life because I realized he gave me the victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it ain't you wouldn't mean it's God in us Paul said is not either do the work right jesus said that is not I that do the work even Jesus who was the son of God where God was in the fullness of in his body he said is not me it ain't the flash man that's doing this work your flesh can't do nothing but fail you you know what you came to being on finish when you need flesh to run it a feint on you you see people get so scared they just drop I said that's how it is with a lion he ain't got to do nothing most of us will see your lion come with faint yeah oh stand still like in shock right he won't have to worry about his free meal it's just there don't even have to work for it at least the dumb animals got enough sense to run but we your flesh will fail you every time that right you're getting a you get enough food or good things you're getting this good thing of praying all of a sudden if you're not careful to check your flesh it's going to slow you down and eventually it's going to stop you that's just the way the flesh work right so your flesh will fail you that's why Jesus Jesus told Peter them when they went they come on come on over here now he no heat they had faith but they weren't perfect in their walk yet but he said come on follow me I need you three Peter James and John to pray for me pray with me took him to the Mount of Olives and they thought it was a sleep over something they fell asleep in a time of prayer when God needed him the most come on somebody faith hope and charity he took all three of him these deer fell asleep he said what are you telling me you can't even pray with me one hour but he understood Jesus understood and he says I know the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak thank God for the amazing grace of God see reasoning you got a cast down reasoning cast down God don't want you two to have reasoning why because reasoning always tries to find a way out faith don't reason yo Joe say don't you slay me I'm going to trust you right he never faith this night reasoning ain't gonna gonna fake you know it's gonna mess you up if God said do it a certain way you must do it that way if God said don't do it don't do it cuz that's how so many souls lose the influence by reasoning you know what I mean lose the influence of the Holy Spirit and it's possible not that the Holy Spirit is gone but lose the influence because we reason God want to dance or you want to dance or shout or say Amen and and and the devil will have you by reasoning looking around to see who else is doing it right and when you do that all of a sudden God moves back a little bit every time you reason God away he fake reason without faith it's impossible to please God see the soul the soul is gonna either thirst for that which is good or that which is bad it craves it has to be fed and if it's not converted its gonna crave evil things if it's converted is gonna go crave heavenly things that's just it right you love the Lord he said if they arise according to the ruling Deuteronomy 13 one through five if they arise among you a prophet or dreamer or dreams and give it the assign or wonder and the sign or the one that come to pass where he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which has not which thou has not known and let us serve them that is he said if this prophet got a good girl right because remember Balaam was a real prophet but Balaam which was what directing them in the wrong way alright let's go over there the Moab let's join up with them amen let's have a big old banquet in the party right God says when they do that I don't care how weird a gift is you know the word worship the Lord thy God and him only hallelujah that's the thing you and I must be careful and we must understand I don't care how supernatural it appears to be if it doesn't match up with the word leave it alone stay with the word reasoning is what takes you away from God faith if you have faith in the world it'll take you to your destiny don't follow that thou should not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dream dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God proven you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul in other words God puts you in that position is that right oh come on somebody we're never kanessa built that image under Daniel Daniel had faith in God and Dan you knew the Word of God but look at all of the other Jews that were in Babylon right and then you knew that that man admired his person so much that he built that image unto unto heaven thinking he was building an image you know for like say doing God a service without his will right amen but Daniel held fast right and he was thrown into the Lions Den but what about all the other Jews you see it's just like religion well will bow down to it like the mark of the beast we're gonna we gonna submit ourselves and but we know in our hearts that we truly believe in one God God puts us to the test right now that we say what do you mean that's why the image that's why we look and we see the image of the prophet and so many people they go the wrong way with it there's only one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that's who we brought you thank God for everything God has done in our hour hello but we only give homage to the one who saves us oh come on somebody it's true anyhow see you must understand like I said your soul is gonna either crave good or evil but at the same time you must understand at one point in time your soul is gonna be extracted you going to die if the Lord tarry now some of us might take a rapture here but only normal you're gonna die aren't y'all happy when you say Paul says hey I desire to go when you really really save you get so tired of this world you don't know what I mean come on pop thought it was rough in his day hey if you can see what's happening now I don't know whether you live in it so you and I must understand Amen that yeah one of these days your soul is gonna be extracted and there is nothing to stand on your behalf other than your soul whatever there is what would be presented if your soul has been been born again and you got Christ in there then you're going upward if you know snakes like holes so therefore if you don't be born again that serpent is there you go down into that big hole alright we call it hell so my my point is is to know that you and I must understand that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God hallelujah I'm almost done so you and I must know one thing that we must allow our souls to be wrapped up and tied up and tangled up into the love of God right and his love the pub said passes all understanding when you love God with all your that's the first commandment love the Lord thy God with all of your heart with all of your mind with all of your soul with all your strength right because let me tell you something a born-again soul has the strength of God and that's what we fail to see the the born-again soul has the strength of God he said according to axises after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power and that word translated from the Greek until until the English is Authority you shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you have the authority what authority the authority that God gives you at the time you become a son and daughter of God you can move mountains huh Jay atmospheres change situations hallelujah by being a son and oh but it must come by faith your strength lies in your faith in the word if the Bible says we can do all things through Christ that's exactly what it means we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us there Stan yeah it's like when David met Abigail and she says David you a man whose love is wrapped up in God called David had done so much made mistakes but nobody had a doubt on whether David loved God or not and even when God told David David because what you've done I'm gonna spank you I'm gonna make all your children turn against you you know what David said I rather fall into the hands of God in the hands of man why cuz we can be so merciful less we can be treacherous it's the truth you know for some reason when it comes to each other we forget that it's grace we get all righteous and holy and we think that we can stand there and judge someone else and none of us are worthy of judging the only judge is the word no man is the word we're all we at the end of the day we're gonna judge judge the world yeah it'll be by the word cuz Jesus Christ is the judge the Bible will judge you no man you love the Lord I love you and I live Bible you wish yes sir [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] see how sweet [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] spray [Music] [Music] Hey [Music] it [Music] is a [Music] [Music] [Music] so many other places we could have gone [Music] thank you Father for the word that was preached [Music] thank you oh it stay on the right path [Music] strengthen courage [Music] you [Music]
