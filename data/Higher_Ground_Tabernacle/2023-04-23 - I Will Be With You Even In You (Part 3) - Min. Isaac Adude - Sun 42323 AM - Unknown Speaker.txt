verse 18 to verse 20. Jean and the Bible says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more by ye see me because I leave and you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and in me and I in you let's go back to John chapter 1. we read the verse 1 and we jump to the verse 14. John 1 verse 1 and verse 14. and when the Bible says that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 the Bible says that and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen let's go to uh first Timothy that's the last um foreign the Bible says that and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifesting the flesh justify in the spirit sin of angels preach unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up in glory beauty is foreign again John Chapter 14 verse 18 to 20. John 14 18-20 jeans and when here the Bible says that I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you he had a little while the world seeth me no more by ye see me because I live and you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you amen that's a that's a great problem that's a great promise that God gave us effect that because I leave you shall live also because and we'll try to remind you again with what we've said the last time and just to get everybody up to date and and continue from there amen we know that as we read it in John chapter 1 that in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the Word was God so we preached it that before the beginning before the creation amen because there in John chapter one John was talking about the beginning John was talking about when when God started to create jean-pally and the time when time began that's what he said in the beginning with the grace of God Amen we received the prophet man who was able to bring us before the beginning he met before the time began before the before the creation amen the prophecies that before that God was the spirit amen his Spirit was covering the entire Earth yeah and then he was covering the entire Earth so since he was covering the entire Earth there were no place for for creation because he was only him and he was only him covering that entire surface [Music] amen and then he decided to make to become a son amen the Bible says that the prophet says that he condensed himself to that form that we call the logos amen the logos also means the anointing the logos which is the Son of God which is also the Son of God so he became that son amen so that he can start now to to create amen and when he started to create that's when John started to write in the beginning was the word amen because that spirit that thoughts himself into into one form [Music] Amen in order for you to see it you had to have the spiritual eyes you could only see him by Revelation what do you mean amen he said that that son is the logos to love us which is the pillar of fire they might notice that when the children of Israel was crossing the the Red Sea markets and the Bible said that Pharaoh was in their back coming for I mean to kill them that Revelation was given to him amen by far referral wasn't able to see that pill of fire that's why it was continued that's why it was keep on it was uh pursuing them and so they have to know to see him you had to be had to be revealed to you amen you had to be you have to you had to have uh you had you had to have a revelation amen and only and back then only prophets that was able to most of the temples on the prophets that was able to see him foreign women he had in him a plane and when he had him a desire having only on this year amen he had in him the plane of redemption and then that point of redemption he had to reveal it to someone so that's why the prophet said that when he started to create amen he created the sun and the Stars amen he started to write his Bible his first Bible he started to write the his plane of redemption he started to ride his plane while he was thinking amen everything that was in his heart amen it's what we call the Zodiac that was God's first Bible amen it's all stars and and constellations and things amen that was the Bible what that job was using that was the Bible that job was reading amen that log was started to write amen he started with the first sign yes amen which is Virgo the Virgin amen showing the first coming of Jesus Christ amen who will be born by a virgin amen the prophet said that he went through the cancer the middle of the age amen and then ended up with the last one wishes amen he will come as the lion of the tribe of Judah amen he started to write down his friend of redemption when he was the appeal of fire amen who started to create everything Amen in him oh [Music] he says that and that same power it is that same Christ sumam Christ let the fundamental let the fundamentals uh let them people who denied the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghosts amen that same power that that spoke the word into resist into existence he says that that's right men and women it's time that we found out who we are who you are amen the Devil he's trying to hide you back the life of God is in the human being and brother sister that deity is in you a little while and the world seeth me no more don't put it yet you shall see me for I will be with you foreign all the fullness of Godly of The Godly badly but the godhead bottling amen all the power that God had in the beginning amen the power that says the power that said that let there be flux and man and and and fishing animals amen the power that said that let us make men into our image and our likeness amen and it happened amen their power amen the Bible says that he pouring into Jesus Christ amen and everything that is amen so therefore you have that same power amen you have the same power to stop to stop uh uh to stop the the the Tempest amen you have the power to multiply bread women you have the power to create money and the fish of in the belly of a fish amen you have the power to speak and that thing will happen foreign because we are the body of Christ amen we form that body amen because I leave you shall live also amen there is no power that can stop you amen because if you do if you dwell in Christ so Christ dwells in you amen you have all the powers amen you have though you are powerful amen look at David amen back then amen God was with them amen but he was able to to overcome all of these all these enemies amen he was able to uh to to overcome against Goliath is it amen amen amen the same power is with us amen because God is dwelling in US amen he says that I will be with you amen even in you amen amen like we said the other day amen God is emerging himself into a human being transferring his power to you amen so now you are God walking I mean obviously amen you are a God Amen you are a god-touching blessings amen so that's why everything that you say will come to pass that's what we have to be careful with what we say amen that's why we have to be careful we walk with what we wish for what happened amen because God will do it amen God will do it because he gave us that power to speak the words that same power that he gave to uh Adams Amen to speak the word they meant to form the Earth and to place it and for me that they're really amen amen to name animals anymore Amen to put everything in order amen that same Powers the power that we have said the power to to to to cast out demons to tell to the tree to be a Wither then the nature will obey the person tell a mountain to be lifted up and it will obey if God is in you it's salmon amen if God is in you amen that same power that was in Christ amen that same power is in here amen so he knew you have the fullness of God Amen in you you have the fullness of the godhead do you like like divinity because everything that was in Christ into the church so now this logos amen he began to think about what with what things will be how things will be also lonely it is you've been going through this problem and then who called you to even say that brother I was thinking about you that's the purpose that's the devil amen he was trying to make you feel like that you by yourself you will try to make you feel like you're not nobody cares about you amen he'll make you feel like amen amen that you've been rejected amen look at that's what he made Elijah feel like she's amen when you don't feel like money doesn't seem like people don't care about you amen there is somewhere somebody's praying for you amen and if you need an Evidence if you need a proof amen you just pick up your phone amen and ask for a prayer request amen proved the devil wrong amen prayer request you have been sick for a whole month children have been sick foreign amen one language or in so long one thought amen God himself said that nothing will stand against them what about if we have good thoughts amen we have the thought of healing foreign [Music] knew that Jesus was coming before even Jesus showed up he could have stopped up there and he will still be the father amen but in him he had more attributes that he wanted to put in action we had the attributes of being a Healer yeah in him he had the attributes of being a savior had the attributes amen of being the father is in him he had the attribute of being the the Kinsmen Redeemer eleven so he wanted to extract to reveal himself to a human be to to the human to the human race in order for him to do that amen he couldn't do that as being the spirit amen he couldn't do that as being God the spirit the Lord amen so that God that love God the word that created everything Amen in his plan amen he had the attrib he had the the the the the the he wanted to reveal himself amen so that's why he made himself he created the flesh he became flesh that's what in John chapter 1 verse 14 it says that that word became flesh amen when Adam sinned amen the human race lost their relationship with God the human race lost that communion with God they couldn't see God anymore amen God couldn't talk to them anymore of the day talking to them anymore amen you couldn't understand God's voice anymore amen they couldn't hear from God anymore amen that's why when the children of Israel foreign he wanted to have the preeminist in his body of Believers amen he wanted to have the first place in the bride foreign Amen to tell us what to do Amen to tell us what to say to tell us where to go Amen in fact the Bible says that those seven women will come to we will come to one man and say that we just want to have your name amen is that people say that God I just want you to be my savior Lord I just want you to deliver me from this spirit amen but they don't want God to be their Lord amen they don't want God to be the oversight of their life they don't want God to be to have the leadership of their life they don't want to become the prisoners of God of Christ amen by God's purpose was to have that preeminence amen God's purpose was to have the Centric of our lives so the foreign to its right for position as a position amen you wanted to restore it back in the day like he was in Eden amen you wanted to restore that order of the history to restore the kingdom in its rightful positions and he puts his Immortal Life in its motor spirit in the man amen Adam couldn't face death amen as long as he was respecting the word of God Amen Adam was an eternal being amen he was Immortal not Eternal but Immortal Immortal amen Adam was Immortal I don't I don't think amen he couldn't he couldn't uh he couldn't uh die amen he couldn't be sick his Birthright to the devil amen he decided he wanted to save his wife so he decided to sing along yeah so he lost that position amen and all the Earth and everything started to fall sickness amen people starting to age amen because of sin amen now the prophet says now Luke I want you to know this something and when this the only way it's in uh the deity of Christ he says that now look I want you to know this this is the only way that God himself could ever redeem this man um and he wants to calm down and take his place and that was a law that was given by Moses the law of redemption he says that he had to be through a kinsman redeemer a man first who was worthy a man who was worth the price a man then who would make his public testimony and redeem the last the the Lost estate of somebody was drawn out of Emmanuel's veins and today he has the same saving redeeming and holy power that he did in that day is now that's right we are Redeemed by the blood of God the Bible says that we are bro we are bought bought by the blood now and Redeemed by Blood God's own blood amen so how was he God's blood amen if God was spirit is free amen where was that blood come was it gonna come do Vanessa amen he being a spirit he couldn't have a blood Louis is amen he didn't have any sales amen he didn't have one shape amen he didn't have one foreign Testament he was taking multiple forms different forms like when you talk to Abraham when he was the pill of fire when he when he protected the children of Israel amen he was the angel of the Lord when he ate with with Abraham amen amen amen he was seen in different forms and in different shapes amen he was that sweet voice that was talking it is going to come from amen he had to make himself a flesh amen the prophet says that it was God's creative blood amen God had to create a body amen God had to create cells a long time ago that he was made lower than Angels Amen in order to save you and me in order to die on Calvary amen that's what Easter is the is the best uh uh Easter is the best week of of of of of the entire year that's why Easter is the best event of the entire of the whole world amen amen that's when your Redemption was given amen that's when you were set free amen that's when your sickness was here resolution just won the chain of your life started when he was at that time at the lowest point of his life when he was crying father why have Thou forsaken me amen when he died as a human being he died as a man amen he died to take your place because the Bible says in I think Ezekiel chapter 28. amen the Bible says that the the soul that sinneth is that so shall die he says the son shall not bear the iniquity of this father of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the weakness of and and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him justification [Music] when they were saying that you've been Justified amen let's say that somebody took something that didn't belong to them and he had to be punished for the sin that he has done they might understand that for your punishment you need you have to die for your punishment Amen to be justified amen that person will be killed is it personally amen and when they kill him for what he has done is when they say that he's been Justified amen because no because because that sin will never be it will never be on him amen the cross the sin that you've been bearing amen God took it upon him and he gave his only begotten son amen the only begotten son Amen to die for you and me in the Bible said that he will believe in him let's read it I think in John chapter 16 verse uh uh I think it's John think it's in John 16 I believe it right uh John 3 16 I believe she says foreign 16 the Bible said that for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Sonique they are alsoever believeth in him he shall not perish respond but I have everlasting life amen he said that so God so loved the world Amen so what is that world Amen I've seen people using this verse and saying that well the Bible said that God loved the world you know God will you know whatever I do even God will forgive me because he loved the world the prophet says that this world that that is used in the scripture amen he doesn't mean Cosmos it's not the entire world Amen God so loved the world it means that God loved the predestinator Amen to die for them amen to take their sins Amen to forgive their sins whoever Believers should not perish but I have everlasting life amen in order for this scripture to come to be fulfilled in you um amen you have to believe amen you have to believe in him Amen in order for you not to be not to perish amen you have to believe in him then you will have eternal life his son into the world Amen to die foreign him and he had to become a son in order for in order for him to save you amen the prophet says that Jesus comes three times the first time he comes to redeem this church that was that was the first coming Amen to redeem this church the second time he comes he met his to receive his church and the third time is to be with his church amen he came to redeem his church amen now is coming to receive this church amen but the church has to meet a certain requirements the church has to be in a certain position amen he will not just come and then receive his church when the church will come shall he find Faith foreign let me read it here uh I didn't point to talk about this so I didn't have all those scriptures in mind amen Romans chapter 1 verse 18. when he said that for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness of men who hold the truth in on righteousness verse 19 because thou which may be known of God is Manifest in manifesting them for God has showed it unto them manifest for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse Perfections because that when they knew God they glorify him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened in the Lions professing themselves to be wise they became foolsage and change the glory of the of the uncorrectable god into an image made like the corruptable man is and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things through the lust of their own hearts and and to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who he's blessed forever amen amen amen uh uh let's jump here uh uh verse 28. he says that and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to report uh Repro reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient communities [Music] being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetness malicious full of Envy murder debate deceit my dignity and Whispers despiteful proud boasters uh inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection incapable and merciful intelligence who knowing the Judgment of God that the witch that their which commit such things are worthy of death not only to the same but have pleasure in them that do themselves 21 it says that because that when they knew God reverse events that glorified him not as God then in their imaginations imagination and their foolish heart was dark person amen I will go and I will have you know multiple wives and I will go sleep with women and things like that because I know that God you know I have the grace of God and God will forgive me please that they knew God foreign amen but God gave them the spirit according amen because Grace is not something that we can play with amen God is merciful amen by his Mercy also can turn to judgment amen he gives you mercy God Amen by giving you the word every day amen he gives you Mercy amen but there is a time where that cup will overflow amen there is a time where that Mercy will change into judgments you have to pay for everything last Wednesday that every action there is a reaction to a reactions so whatever you do today and you say where people don't see me I'm by myself and using my phone and um you have to know that there is always in God the eye of God that's watching amen the guy is watching Drew himself and he knows everything amen the prophet here it continues and we want to close the prophet here continues and says that about God but that is the god the Creator living in you and giving you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had if we don't put on position so is it so is it in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from Temptation oh malice hatred strife and so forth turn away from it take him from your heart they will take God from your heart if you will receive him Embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him I can't tell you the church together in that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah and the death here the death here it is the creepers walk this is the blind sea is why it's recognizing the power of almighty God into your heart there is the deity Amen in order for it to have in order for you to have that powerful the foreign started by saying that turn your heart from Evil abstain yourself from Evil um amen watch your life um he may control what you're hearing the controllers control what you're saying what you're watching amen turn to righteousness then that power of God will reflect in you may that power of God will reflect in it amen because there is always a disadvantage when you do something wrong yeah so let me give you an example you're doing something wrong you know I won't be able to name everything by you name it you know yourself what you do in Secrets amen and you doing it and then you receive a phone call of a brother asking for prayer if we um you know but when we receive things like that we have to be able to to pray and and then to you know to pray for the brother or sister that's calling amen because changing an atmosphere it's something that is very hard amen it's something that is very hard to do amen it takes consecration it takes time he takes into Consecration and prayer and worship in order for you to change that atmosphere but we have the bible say that we have to be ready in every time amen off season and in season we have to be ready to serve God Amen because we never know when God will need us we never know when God will require us to pray for somebody or to speak the word for somebody um that's why we always have to do good foreign [Music] all the time what makes people shout and crying amen it's the holy spirit amen when you have it even your life will be changed when you have it amen your work will change that you will have to force yourself to do good amen that you along with you only do good when you are among Brothers then you become a Christian then you listen to Christians remember when you find the body you find among yourselves you know when you're comfortable with your friends and those visits that's when your playlist changes amen you see a brother or sister started listening to Michael Jackson Michael Jackson even the brother sister started listening to those sick music amen by the question the Christian doesn't have a Time amen you have to be a Christian every time amen because when your friends are are weak amen you have to be the one to strengthen them amen you have to be the one to show them the way amen how are you gonna tell your children not to do it when yourself you do it hey man how are you gonna tell your children to go to church early one yourself you don't come to church early um how are you gonna tell your children that this type of music is wrong when yourself you do listen to that type of music that parents do have on their children they might not realize it but the children always look up to their parents you regardless amen it doesn't matter how how young they are they always look up to them foreign matter if Jesus is in US amen we have to live like Jesus we have to talk like Jesus amen we have to walk like Jesus amen we have to stop being hypocrite amen we have to be we have to become Christian all the time and every everywhere am I doing what the Bible asks us to do amen being in the father's business God will give it to us amen because the prophet says that in order for the third put to come in actions amen you have to have a good relationship with the maker [Music] amen that's when you'll be able to speak the words amen that's when any time you can speak the word because you have a good you've been a good relationship with me [Music] you know to continue about my subject I will be with you even in you but um amen but we just think that we just thank him for you know for his presence and his grace remember every time I preach I always say the Lord I want to be so sensitive to the holy spirit because that's what I want to do how many hours are put in for a sermon I know it's not a hard thing to do when you change your when it changes your sermon at the last minute amen but that's what I want him to do Amen to answer to speak to the need of the church because the Holy Spirit was wrong and what's right and when he speaks that means that there is something that we need to fix it it meant that there is something that we need to fix our lives in our homes what are we letting in it what are we doing amen what type of songs are listening we drink kitchen it doesn't matter how you justify it is that when you have questions on something don't do it because it might be that one thing that can keep you from the kingdom of God so when you question something is this good or
