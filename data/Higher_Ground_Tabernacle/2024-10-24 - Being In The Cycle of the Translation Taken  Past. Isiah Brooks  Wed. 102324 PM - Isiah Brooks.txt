TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] resp let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us Lord we pray tonight that the word of God will find an anchor in our Souls Lord that it would continue to create in us the very virtue and divine nature of Christ Lord we here oh God in the Judgment house in the house where judgment began and father we want you tonight to look in the depths of our soul there be anything within us that is not right or proper any Speck of Darkness we pray tonight Hallelujah Lord that you forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness and to you be all the glory in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen uh you may be seated I I just want to um draw a subject tonight being we we spoke on the Rapture I think the last when we dealt with Jude and and tonight we want to just kind of move in another segment not in just the book of Jude but I believe that this is the hour that we are to be translated uh we're we're not in the seven Church ages in that in that sense brother Bram said every Church age overlapped one another but we know by the grace of God that in the church ages starting from Ephesus there was always something uh the spirit of the Lord had against them and then and then when it came to Le out OFA she was in the worst shape of them all in Leia we heard a voice that told us that we were living in Satan's Eden and but in the same token took the the the the the darkest age to produce the brightest [Music] light and you and I must understand amen that our in the bride age there is nothing said against you is that right so I want you to understand this is the grace of God no man has been able to accomplish the Holiness of God even when the laws were given none can keep the law so brother Bram said God had to find a way or produce a way in order for us to be saved so in this age we call the bride Age The Covenant which God has given unto us is unconditional amen it's not what you can do for him it's what God has already done for you hallelujah hallelujah he was so certain of those of us who would make it through this age that he put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah huj I'm so glad tonight be in that number Hallelujah many people are saying when the Rapture takes place I want to be in it but I want you to understand the Rapture is already in progress Hallelujah huj and I'm so glad to be a part of this Rapture understand me when I falter when I come short I I know God is already made a way for me to escape I understand this that I can never be accepted on my own merits but I am accepted you are accepted in the Beloved now this ought to fir people up we should never be lukewarm with a message like this hallelujah hallelujah thank God for his Amazing Grace this AG this age is the age of insanity but it's also a age for the same for the same there are only a few of us and the prophet of God said the bride will be the only one in this age that has her right mind Hallelujah and the only why reason we have our our right mind is because the mind of Christ has been given to us is that right see the bride is only sane people in the world I did not say those that follow this message all are all in their right mind many are not as it always have been throughout the age of time Hallelujah there are those who has the ear to hear and there are those who cannot hear hallelujah hallelujah so you understand it is the serpent they cannot hear Hallelujah he has no ears per se he only knows his surroundings by vibrations Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ she hears the word she hears the voice of God so much so Jesus said my sheep my voice and a stranger they will not follow this is also the age of the great falling of every system whether it be political social or whether it is religious Everything Must Fall is that right the only uh how can I said the only house or the only Kingdom that cannot fall it's the kingdom that is founded upon the rock hallelujah is that right I'm coming to something in just a moment this is the age of the manifestation of the wheat and tear I was thinking about this on yesterday I said you and and I know we got two pools you got a pool for heaven and there's a pool for hell is that right and it all depends on which pull you yield yourself to Hallelujah is that right many of us don't want to believe that we have periods where we worship Satan when you step out side of the word you begin to yield your members to Hallelujah Satan when you in the word when you under the word you yeld to the Holy Spirit and that is God hallelujah hallelujah this is the age the manifestation of the wheat and tear as I said this is the age of the serpent seed as well as the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah now I want you to understand that the grace of God is always with his seed understand I want to I want to really push this uh so you can understand none of us are worthy to stand is that right I'm I'm recalled of how Isaiah in the year that King oziah died I saw the Lord he was high and lifted up and in that Vision Isaiah saw not only himself but the condition of the people Hallelujah he said oh woe is me I am a man of unclean lips and I DW among the people hallelujah of unclean lips in other words in order to go up you must first come down Hallelujah huj I don't care who you think you are every seed of God must humble themselves in order to go up hallelujah hallelujah this is also the age of the ending of the Gentile age when the door is shut to this age of the seven y'all hear what I'm saying this is the age of the closing is that right I'm going say that again you are now living in the time when the Gentile age is closing Hallelujah and if that be the case which side of the door are you on hallelujah hallelujah you are the inside or you on the outside hallelujah hallelujah but think about it God said he never lost one hallelujah amen and we understand that the opening of The Seven seal is the mystery of the coming of the Lord hallelujah is that right brother brandham says it's Christ so you and I must understand Hallelujah that God is among us even to this day a lot of times people think that God is with them only when they come to church but I want you to understand God is always always with you you may not recognize it but he's always there Hallelujah is that right now listen when Adam and Eve sin it may appear that God wasn't there but God was always there he didn't say uhoh what has happened to my son he knew the plan from the beginning to the end Hallelujah this is the part that I like so when he confronted Adam and Eve he basically said who told you you was naked he didn't say what did you read a book Hallelujah but who showing that it was a person that showed them that they were naked see that goes with the serpent seed a creature that look so much like a man he was able to talk like a man he was able to mix the seed of a [Music] man he was the one that Satan used to take the clothes off of Adam and Eve hallelujah hallelujah now Adam stayed with her because he loved her is that right coming from the message I'll read that again God is so good to us hallelujah listen let's just read it again coming from the exposition now I know in answering one question I'm coming to something one is apt to come up and people ask me if Eve fell that way what did Adam do now you know brother bam said Adam was a type of Christ he knew she was wrong and he knew the consequences you know that he would plunge mankind into sin he knew that that that this was not the perfect will of God but he loved her so [Music] much I love this because Adam loved I love to say like this Adam broke the word that means Adam loved Eve more than he loved God think about it that's what it was but he was in the plan of [Music] God and he was the only one that God could show us how much he loved us amen hallelujah hallel you think about it a god of Holiness never un never experiencing pain but he fashioned himself like a man hear what I'm saying he wanted to feel what it felt like to have a headache wanted to feel but it felt to be sick understand me this is why Hebrew says that we have one a comforter hallelujah amen that could feel our infirmities he knows all about it Hallelujah the Bible said he became sin that we might become the righteousness of God you understand what I'm saying how on Earth are you going to make a Rapture hallelujah it's not by power it's not by mind but it's by the spirit of God hallelujah hallelujah you must have this mindset because in your natural mind this is impossible hallelujah hallelujah in your natural mind how many of you can say I live holy all day hallelujah oh come on somebody but with his stripes we were healed hallelujah hallelujah I must put it all back on God way you going to make a Rapture take message your mind with the message away the fears wash away the concerns Hallelujah you must wash your mind such a way that you a to stand before God lord it's all because of your mercy and Grace hallelujah hallelujah you know I'm glad that God says he loves the backslider because we all backslide every day somebody help me here God loves us even though he knows every failure you going to make say like this you can have children and they can make all kind of mistakes nothing can cancel out their relationship with you a son is a son and a daughter is a daughter hallelujah hallelujah no matter how bad it gets God said I'll never leave you no will I forsake you hallelujah hallelujah now the Lord has always called for toal separation from all unbelief Hallelujah is that right you see even from the beginning when Adam and Eve fell God separated the two not Adam and Eve but he separated the two seeds Hallelujah y'all remember Cain killed Abel Hallelujah and in the process of all of that God God separated Cain from the righteous seed is that right so you say what do you mean God has always found his seed no matter where they were right you said well what do you mean brother Brooks just for an example here was a Ethiopian unic who did not know nothing about Christ and him being crucified somebody help me here but he was the seed of God he was on a mission he was a servant Hallelujah hallelu but there he was he had a pool of God and God met him y'all hear what I'm saying there was a woman Hallelujah in Jericho hallelujah hallelujah she was a seed of God and though she was in a place that was ungodly and though she was affected by the influence of that City God knew that inside there's a seed germ hallelu and God went down there in Jero destroyed the whole city just to get her what are you talking about brother God will tear up everything justify y'all hear what I'm saying it's nothing but the truth God don't care what system you might be in y y'all hear what I'm saying God don't care if the church done through you out God don't care if you look like you're unsavable somebody help me here as I said to myself and I've said to you many of times God will take the devil and the devil will bring you to Jesus is that right when woman was C in adultery somebody help me here it was those Pharisees and saddu brought to Jesus it he shook their system their system up they tried to bring the word tried bring the system to the word that the word is God hallelujah they brought her to the Judgment seat somebody help me here but they fail the SE in that seed in that woman rather she look like a eame woman wastified is that right because he asked that without sin let him cast the first stone and everybody who shall lay in charge to God's electus amen and what happened there Hallelujah Jesus said woman where are your accusers Hallelujah is that right where are your accusers amen amen she said I have none Isaiah 54 said what oh my God God is so good to us you and I must understand that God knows how to deliver the righteous Hallelujah he knows how to deliver his seed even after the flood there was a man that was called nimr and Nimrod was a spirit he was anointed uh by Lucifer himself and that Spirit still lives that's right he was a man of war he believed in conquering people and bringing into a Unity Hallelujah H come on somebody the Bible tells us that this man was achieving everything he sought out to achieve and I'm going to tell you something God would the devil would achieve with you everything that he sought out to achieve if God didn't intervene come on somebody and he was building a kingdom it was a big a great Kingdom and and and listen God said let me go down because if I'm not if I let them continue and this is what I love about this if the devil can unite and get the attention of God what about the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah if if the devil can unite against God what about the bride and stand against the devil hallelujah hallelujah it was a time that man wanted Glory sound familiar Hallelujah this is also a time that science and inventions were so high Hallelujah nrod took himself to be a god y'all better hear what I'm saying you wait wait a minute brother I kind of heard this before but you better listen to me now because the spirit of nimrod is still working today hallah he's controlling the People by force say oh brother what are you talking about he's got a new tactic but he he controls your mind in a time that the of God says that the greatest battle ever fought in your mind Hallelujah so the devil he literally controls your mind he gets your mind and he's molding it and making it I'm talking about those who listen to all of the media follow all of the stories you do all of that kind of thing fail to see that's the spirit of nimrod because everything out there is glorifying the devil Hallelujah everything out there is glorifying the devil Hallelujah and when you enact allow yourself to be a part of it you fail to see even the prophet of God says one day you receive rece a blast oh you say what do I mean what do you mean brother even your video games is a very dangerous thing you are opening your mind up to The Fifth Dimension where demons travel hallelujah hallelujah you fail to see the influence of the enemy like I said two influences one is to take you up and the other one is to take you down Hallelujah but I want you to understand that the system of nimrod Hallelujah was destroyed God came down hallelujah hallelujah and divided the people hallelujah is that right but there's another system there was a man by the name of uh of Abraham but let me let me read a little bit of little bit of history on this Nimrod it says during the time of nimrod Babylonian King the following events are said to have occurred I want you to take this in mind I'm not sure where they got all of their information from but we do know that he was a warrior he was a great hunter because during that time men began to eat meat before the FL they didn't eat meat but after the flood they were allowed to eat meat so he was a great Hunter and I want you to understand now the spirit of nimrod is still a great hunter but he's hunting Souls Hallelujah that he may destroy that he may conquer that he may control Rod is considered to have led the construction of the tow of Babel in the land of Shah the Bible does not explicitly say this Hallelujah is that right Nimrod established the first Kingdom the of Babel and akad in the land of sha he also built cities inria including Neva K reob and re hallelujah hallelujah is Right Nimrod conquered and subjugated the people other land forming an Empire and whether you realize it or not the spirit of nimrod is doing the same thing Hallelujah call it the United Nations calling you to the World Council of churches these these people are 19 against God y'all better hear what I'm saying because with the system comes persecution comes War and the and and and the the the the the um the drive of this system is to conquer everyone believes in God hallelujah Nimrod incited people to attribute their prosperity to their own Veil rather than to God is that right you see the churches under that inspiration robing the people Tak Advantage oh come on somebody it ain't just the Catholic church it's all of them Hallelujah and what the people are not seeing is that the system that they're under is not God let me say like this the prophet of God through his ministry brought us the proper way to worship God and if you don't worship God under that expression hallelu you're not worshiping God because in order to worship God you must worship Him in spirit in truth hallelujah a lot of people might be afraid to say that I'm Not Afraid say it because I realize what I'm working against or working with Hallelujah you say oh no brother Brook oh you haven't seen nothing yet I trust by the grace of God that each and every one of us make a Rapture I pray that we're in that cycle of translation because I want you to understand you just can't live any kind of way and say I'm in the Rapture Hallelujah when God gets your attention you like Isaiah Hallelujah you will confess your sins you hum yourself Hallelujah and then the fire come everybody want the Holy Ghost without repentance everybody want the Holy Ghost without sanctification but the fire can't come down until you humble yourself Hallelujah is that right oh man because of the fall of mankind Satan took his inheritance for his own so much so we've come in a time that's called Satan's Eden he is now God of the Earth the spirit of nimrod Works through a system that will glorify him amen amen it even has a name it's called mystery The Babylon great mystery Babylon the great Hallelujah how many of us oh we this is old news Well I'm going tell you something for right now never have we seen the world in the condition it is in now I want you to understand that this war as prophet of God said did not start here on Earth it start in heaven hallelujah hallelujah and one of the promises that we have have in this word if we we stood with him then hallelujah glory to God second Timothy 2:9 you and I must understand all of these trials and tests that we got coming at us for our own good you're going to either say thank you Jesus or help me Lord yes sir second Timothy 2 we know who the foundation is we know the foundation right the foundation is Jesus Christ word never nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity he didn't say depart from sin he depart from iniquity and iniquity is when you know to do good and doth it not hallelujah hallelujah is that right the Lord is a deliverer of his people let's go to Genesis 12 please 23 love the Lord until you become nothing God can't make you anything you know we we we we have this thing where even preachers think they're something the preacher ought to be the most humble you know he's a servant you know find out that in most churches he's the one that's being worshiped oh that's not mest is he's even in the message people are take what preachers say over what brother brandham say and when you do that you're breaking the word you have now become a system of your own and they wonder where is the power of the Holy Ghost don't add nor take away everything by revelation hallelujah hallelujah and as the prophet of God said it must be you must be able to prove your truth or your Revelation Genesis to Revelation because he's the Alpha and the Omega hallelujah hallelujah yes Lord Genesis 12 1 23 I hope you're being blessed tonight now the Lord has said unto Abram go bow thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation listen how God says I'mma take you from this place but I'm take you to another place where you going to be great blessed uh great greatly blessed you see God you God don't ask you just to sacrifice he always have in his mind a greater reward for you you know if if the Rich Young Ruler would have known that God was calling him to bless him and not to curse him y hear what I'm saying cuz a lot of time people think Christianity is a curse my God the only way is a to you is when you not obeying what the word says hallelujah but when when you obey the word it's blessings every day the psalmist says according to according to Psalms 103 bless the Lord my soul and all that within me let us not forget his benefits Hallelujah his benefit fit in being a Christian the doctor don't heal you God heals you the doctor can't deliver you God delivers you somebody help me here he's a mind regulator he's AER hallelujah how many times when you needed some comfort there was no to be found God came on the seene Hallelujah that's the God I serve that's the god you serve Hallelujah he said unto Abraham I will make of thee a great nation and I bless thee and make thy name great thou shall be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curses thee and in these shall all families of the earth be blessed I don't know why why we always look over to Israel like this scripture only applies to them but this scriptures apply to you too if a man curse you he shall be cursed if a man bless you he shall be blessed that is the truth if a man gives you a drink of water in the name of the Lord Jesus receive eternal life for everlasting life you are God called you out of Babylon just like he did Abraham Hebrews 11 8-1 now we calling out he's calling us out calling out ain't good enough go and so many people think they got the Holy Ghost I'm not saying you ain't got a measure of it we need enough Holy Ghost to bring God in a place in our life where he have total preeminence Hallelujah that's what the message came for so that God could have total preeminence what God told Abraham go sacrifice ISAC right that was his final test he had failed along the line you know go and he go west God go west he go east y understand me always getting in trouble but God took that Treasure of his heart give it to me see that's what you don't understand God will take your most valuable treasure and say give it to me and once you give it to him he's right there to bless you he said to Abraham now I know that you love me that's all I want I just want him to know that I love him Hallelujah you love the Lord Hebrews 11 8 through1 Hallelujah I'll try to finish this up on Sunday [Music] this is just the beginning by faith eth verse by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should afterward receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went does that sound for me the scripture says you have not traveled this way before Hallelujah but you got to keep going Hallelujah Hallelujah by faith he saw Jour in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with ISAC and Jacob the airs with him of the same promise I love that but he looked for a Hallelujah he look for a city which have Foundation whose Builder and maker is of God you understand me though Faith also through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive [Music] seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age Hallelujah why because she judged him faithful who had promised Hallelujah I don't know about you I judge him faithful hallelu he made the promise and he that begun that good promise in you Hallelujah you say oh brother let me tell you something we are so blessed Abraham had no Scrolls to look at there was no book and he here he was in a place of idolatry y'all hear what I'm saying he was in Babylon Hallelujah and God calls him out and he was able to hear the voice of God and because of that he was led by The Voice soundar Hallelujah God in his in time has given us his Voice Hallelujah and those who can hear the voice Follow The Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God the seed is not air with the Shu 6 028 paragraph 53 you love the Lord here the seed one one seed Not seeds but one seed these others were not Seed of Abraham because Abraham seed was his faith seed that God was speaking of not his natural seed because after Sarah died Abraham married another woman and had seven sons besides daughters so it wouldn't be Abraham's seeds it was Abraham's seed and that was Abraham's Faith seed you understand what he's saying Faith seed a revelation of who you are hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody help me here listen Faith seed pointing to the Royal seed that that was to come through Abraham's faith not Abraham's natural life but Abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to God's word and call it as though it was not believed God against hope believed in hope that the real seed that's the real seed we're speaking of how you going to make a Rapture without faith and that faith is a revelation and that Revelation is that God chose you before the foundation of the world not by power not by might but by my spirit that SC that scripture because I realize I didn't make me make you God Made You hallelujah hallelujah do you think God made a mistake by putting Rahab and Jero listen if the children of Israel had traveled from Egypt to the promised land in those seven days of H she may have never been born but God had to wait so he caused him to wander in the wilderness let me tell yall let me say y this Rapture this Rapture this this translation could have happened a long time ago God purposed to let this message of these people for me for you many of those old Warriors are dead and gone Hallelujah but God knew there was a generation coming there was a RAB you say I'm not in a Rahab yes you are the Bible call this an adulterous generation and God knew what he was doing had he not placed the seed in you the Bible said we would have all become like Sodom and gomorra I hate it when people like they all righteous and everything that's not the word is perverted you were born perverted whether you like it or not you know wearing glasses is perverted but I thank God I thank God for science but there's a time we would never have wear this you know I was thinking about that the other day and I brother you don't have to take your glasses off you know my thing is this I was thinking I said what will our eyesight be like where the whole world will be able to see him I don't even know the distance because his throne is way up there but everybody in the city and everybody in the world will be able to see him that's better than any Eagle I know you love the Lord give me a little uh we normally give me a few more minutes Exodus 2 2 and 10 we appreciate God are you in that cycle you know the Bible says the joy of the Lord is your strength and sometimes we act like a Baptist Church brother brother Josh y'all don't know what he been through you don't know where he's come from that's why you see all that Joy back there and when he say Amen y look around craning your neck like what is that Joy that's what y'all used to have come on somebody he ain't out of order somebody else isus yes sir and the child grew the 10th verse and the child grew and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name Moses and she said because I drew him out of the waters something God always drawing us out of the waters you know Waters represent people you know he always draws us out we we may be in a system like Egypt but God even in that system God know who you are he know who you are he know where you are and there is a time God will call you out Hallelujah is that all right Hebrews 11 I love the story of Moses oh yes I do I love the fact Hallelujah that God even had his enemy feed him Hallelujah Hebrews 11 2326 y'all never heard that little story the lady used to praise the Lord all the time about God and she she was hungry and a man was passing by and heard her testifying thank you God lord I need need I know you're going to bring it and you're going to it's going to come well he heard her prayer and went and bought food and knocked on the door and and and and when she saw that he had food she said praise the Lord God didn't answer my prayer and he has brought me food Hallelujah and the man say God didn't bring it I did she said Thank You Jesus Hallelujah for bringing me food say you brought it the devil brought it you gave it but the devil brought it I may have messed that one up but the point is the devil might bring it but God hallelujah huj oh yes by faith 23 verse by faith Moses when he was born was here three months of his because they saw he was a Propet CH proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter hallelujah hallelujah choosing rather to suffer afflictions with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for season Hallelujah you say well that's Moses that's the seed of God we don't want to be children of the world we don't want to be called you know in this age to be as they are we are different we must know that we can't do the things Egypt does come on somebody no no no no no no once the revelation of who you are has been revealed to you that you are the bride of Christ your every move every day is to do the will of God esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt and how many when the last you've been persecuted for being a Christian standing on the word of for the hour Hallelujah calling you a cult and all that kind of crazy well if Jesus and his 12 disciples was a cult cuz that's what they say that's the definition of one Hallelujah but the greatest cult ever is the Roman Catholic Church W you better not say that too loud but they follow a man they don't even follow the word no more and that's how oh come on somebody esteeming the reproach of Greater Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto recompense of the reward you love the Lord I'm going say this again the spirit to conquer and to unify against God is still that Spirit of Babylon to teach false doctrines and lies to manipulate the people it's the spirit of Babylon one world order uniting of churches as the bride of Christ is the spirit of Babylon the entire Babylonian system system of the mother and the child the god the Trinity of Father Son and Holy Ghost and and what we don't we treat it as if it's nothing in one of these old days coming soon you're going to see that thing is a liive and well and God describ it as a woman riding a beast and the Bible said all of the blood of the martyrs what martys those who were Christians all of the blood is in her Revelation 17 1-8 like I said I'm just starting out I'll move forward and Sunday by God's gra Revelation 1718 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had seven vials and talk with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon my many Waters [Music] y'all remember when y'all first came to the message the scriptures were powerful we knew at at at any time this church was going to raise up and come after us and it's been a long time coming but it's here I I know some things that I can't say right now but it's here and whether you see it or not this Spirit infiltrates every church that is a system that has no Holy Ghost you understand me but a church with the Holy Ghost be a we you be you're able to see the enemy a far off hallelujah hallelujah with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication how can I say it if you can't see that the world is drunk out of their mind these people are fighting God hallelujah hallelujah and the war has not escalated yet you let me say it like this talk about Ukraine what's the spirit behind that it's Nimrod it's Babylon she's moving all of the chest pieces because she thinks she going to chatmate God but I want you to but I want you to understand God destroyed the first one God destroyed the second and God will destroy the third she'll never be able to accomplish oh come on somebody Satan is not our God no no no no no no no no so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness third verse and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was array in purple scarl color and Deck with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abomination and fil of her fornication Hallelujah you love the Lord now we as pastors we stand as um in a place where where where God has made us a voice no she Ang a physical Angel but our instructions come from the almighty God hallelujah hallelujah now I want you to understand you may think that this is going to be a pushover thing you're going to be tried you will be tried you will be tested is that right I mean even in Daniel Daniel say he would wear the Saints out and many of us are feeling wo [Music] out be ful Hallelujah but I don't know about you I'm still expecting another rain another anointing that will bring us into that final stage that final transition y understand what I'm saying that final transition where these old bodies take off mortality and put on immortality that's where we head it I got to hurry up I'm I'm I'm I'm losing time I'm losing time Hallelujah and upon uh let me read jump to the fifth verse and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the abomination of the Earth who was in Babylon all of us were all of us were hallelujah hallelujah Revelation 18 2-4 I don't care what religion you were in Baptist method presbyter Catholic message I don't care people say oh no brother Brooks you better study your word everybody that followed Moses didn't go over and everybody that followed Joshua didn't go over didn't accomplish nothing is that right a was found in the midst of it so let me say it like this GLE up The Lawns of your mind and be sober this is your hour this is your day and you don't a second chance somebody said well if I'm predestinated I'm going to be there anyway but there is an anointing that comes upon the predestinated is that right the prophet of God said God works on both ends he's not going to pull you through a hole Hallelujah every victory of his divine nature every accomplishment is a victory in its divine nature Hallelujah Revelation 18 2-4 I'm almost done and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest fall and is fallen and become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul spirit and a cage they can't even get out a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for All Nation have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and The Merchant of the Earth are come on y'all know what I'm

come on somebody he said brother Brooks you trading yeah I am I know I am come out of her and I heard another voice from Heaven say heaven say come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sin amen and that you receive not her plagues you say I'm not with the script everybody that didn't hear Moses was drowned in the flood is that right and everybody that didn't listen to to Mo I mean excuse Noah was drowning the flood and everybody that didn't listen to No Moses and applied that blood on the door Post in the L everybody that murmured against the message of Moses di in the wilderness I'm getting a little confused but you know they died that's the point many of them died in Egypt and many of them died in the wilderness and and some even died in the promised land oh I got the holy ghost that that's just the beginning brother said you just started the journey now you're in a Warfare and you got to fight for your territory Hallelujah I'm going skip a little bit of this okay coming from the message influence par 721 I think it's 7:21 7 72 72 sorry I wonder my brother I wonder my sister if we're looking at that when the Holy Angels has to cover their face to stand in the presence of God in reverence and in respect but today we find people who call themselves Christians even has no respect at all for God or his word or his people or his ministry or nothing where are they going to come up at in the resurrection but the Bible said if the righteous scarcely be saved where were the Sinner and the ungodly appear look through history everybody that disrespected Noah were down everybody that dis respected Moses is that right died and Jesus even said to the Pharisees I don't care how religious you are except you believe that I am he he should likewise die in your sins and we've come to the very same day where the son of man has revealed himself through a son of man is that right and he B except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin that is nothing but the TR God can't change we must have a conscience of his presence paragraph 78 coming from the influence you love the Lord but that listen he talks about the little woman who had enough Faith That Could Touch His Garment she got her desires we've got to be we've got to be conscience of God's presence this little five senses that we live in that's that's just a little world of our own that but but God that's we was only given these so we could contact our Earthly home but there is senses beyond that another Dimensions amen and God is always present y'all better hear hear this if we could only remember that the angel the Lord are encamped about those who fear Him in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is host of angels thousands of them gathered around he said you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they are here if that isn't so then the scripture isn't so scripture isn't right God isn't right the Bible said that the angel of God are camped they don't leave they stay near those that fear Him Hallelujah is that right Jesus said whereever two or three are gathered in my name be in their midst that makes him in a a world that we cannot see that our five senses doesn't contact but Jesus Christ is here present if we could be conscience of that that's the problem we lose consciousness of him and when we lose consciousness of him we lose respect for him Hallelujah glory to God psalm 16 Hallelujah just a little bit more I have beginning at the eth verse I've set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand amen I shall not be moved amen therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices re rejoices my My Flesh shall Rest In Hope amen couple more quotes and then I'll let you go same message 134 influence well when the angel met Mary that morning on the road to the well and told her she was going to have a baby knowing no man it put her into action she went quickly telling everybody that she was going to have a baby no man she didn't care what it meant to to what the people said she had actually met an angel of God and put her into action she was conscious am that the Holy Ghost was upon hering in her a life I just get excited oh oh if we could only realize that that the Holy Ghost is upon us creating in us a faith trying to present himself in so many different ways to create a faith for a rapturing church it should put us into action I wonder if we're just doing it the way we want to it to be with reverence and humility the pill of fire in the last day to put the whole church into action being indicated is coming at hand Hallelujah same message paragraph 162 I'm winding it up right now Hallelujah I hope somehow it's blessed you tonight until the people get ready to confess there is no need of having these healing services if you would confess your [Music] sins your unbelief confess the things that you are doing wrong then God can do something but until there is a confession there can be no cleansing Hallelujah as soon as Isa said always me I'm a man of unclean lips with the people of unclean lips come the confession then come the cherubim with the fire did you notice God never used a CER Seminary to cleanse him with he never used a book of law he cleansed him by fire hallelujah hallelujah God always cleans his servants when he is ready to put them in Duty by the Holy Ghost and Fire God cleans by fire by books not by education not by intelligence conception not by denomination by the fire of the Holy Ghost God cleanses his servants me say this we have gotten away from the Holy Ghost and Fire in this message everybody's trying to see you can be deeper than one or the other preachers have made people sick like Moses did he gave them meat out seon that's why brother bham made sure that when he gave us meat it was me a new season and that's what has happened we taken revelation we ran with it Hallelujah out of season now is the season but most people are so sick they don't even know how to eat anymore they can quote brother brandom but never received it here because it was so deep they threw it back up then notice right then after the confession after the cleansing then come the commission then what was commission after confessed and cleansed it was been that the king Isaiah answered God I send me after he was cleansed confessed cleansed by the fire then that CLE then that clean Isaiah was ready for work he was ready to be an example he was ready to have put his life out that others could be influenced by him this process of the Rapture you got to be cleansed you got to confess and then the fire y'all hear what I'm saying and this fire that falls from God must come in you in such a way that he has preeminence
