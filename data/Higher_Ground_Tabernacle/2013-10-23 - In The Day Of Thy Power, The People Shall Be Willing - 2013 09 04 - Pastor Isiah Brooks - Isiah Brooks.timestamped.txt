[2:55] seated amen uh uh we we just look
[2:59] learned a day or two ago uh Young
[3:02] Brother not young he was actually older
[3:04] than me but uh died uh um I don't know
[3:08] whether you know Brad burges uh from
[3:11] down there in Louisville um but anyway
[3:15] he uh his brother Keith died the other
[3:18] day um I believe he's already buried by
[3:22] the grace of God he's been suffering
[3:25] really sick for a while now but um God
[3:29] uh
[3:30] God's grace and and and mercy um be upon
[3:34] you amen
[3:37] uh we like to we uh speak on
[3:41] tonight just a little thought we're just
[3:43] going to take our time uh and and
[3:46] preserve some of our
[3:48] energy but uh we're like in the day of
[3:52] thy power this is what we're going to
[3:54] speak on and if we had a theme it would
[3:58] be they shall be
[4:01] willing willing am and uh you know
[4:05] that's one thing about God that word
[4:08] when it was spoken amen uh God was
[4:11] speaking about
[4:15] me and you must take it personally as
[4:19] well thy people shall be
[4:22] willing in the day of thy power and
[4:26] that's the day that we're living in we
[4:29] are now coming to a culmination of a lot
[4:32] of things or all the things rather if
[4:34] you want to put it that way every tree
[4:36] is bring forth uh is bringing forth its
[4:39] fruit every nation is being seen uh what
[4:43] we see now is uh coming together uh of
[4:47] the Bride uh there's been a great
[4:49] falling away but that's prophecy too the
[4:53] Bible said except they come a great
[4:55] falling away see God can't come until
[4:58] all of the par parites are are are
[5:01] shaken off because remember brother Bram
[5:04] talks about how that when uh he got with
[5:08] his disciples and and and said uh except
[5:11] a man eat my flesh and drink my blood he
[5:15] he was literally getting rid of the
[5:17] parasites he was getting rid of those
[5:19] people amen that were basically
[5:22] pretending that they understood him and
[5:26] knew who he was uh I was so blessed
[5:30] uh basically in my studying because I
[5:32] realize that we're living in the day
[5:35] that you got to know that you know that
[5:36] you know that you know amen because the
[5:39] storms are coming and uh when I saw uh
[5:44] the scripture I really got excited
[5:46] because it was in our day that this same
[5:49] MDC that spoke amen and visited uh
[5:54] Abraham in his day amen came and visited
[5:58] Us in spirit form and uh made himself
[6:02] made it clear Amen to the audience that
[6:05] we were living in a day uh lik un to
[6:09] Abraham and Sarah just before the
[6:12] burning of Sodom now we want you to
[6:16] understand that I don't know exactly
[6:18] whether Putin will be the one that will
[6:21] push the button but uh we realize by way
[6:24] of Prophecy uh the prophet threw it out
[6:28] there he said uh perhaps one day he'll
[6:31] have too many
[6:32] vods and he'll push the button well we
[6:36] know the fire is coming right whenever a
[6:40] world or a city gets so bad like our
[6:44] United States or our world has become uh
[6:48] the only way that God knows how to clean
[6:50] it off real good is by fire amen so we
[6:54] realize that it is coming now in the day
[6:56] of his power we want you to understand
[6:59] and the Bible said that his people not
[7:02] only will they have power but they will
[7:07] know in other words it won't be a time
[7:10] of guesswork but it will be a time where
[7:13] people will know and you say no what his
[7:17] voice that has been the argument of our
[7:20] age is he Malachi for is he not come on
[7:25] somebody I mean is he the voice of God
[7:28] or is he not uh is he a false prophet or
[7:31] is he a true one but remember the Bible
[7:34] said my sheep will hear my voice and a
[7:37] stranger they will not follow so for
[7:40] those voices that are literally taking
[7:43] people away amen from the message or
[7:46] from the word of the hour you must
[7:48] recognize they weren't his sheep in the
[7:51] beginning because it is declared that
[7:54] his sheep will not follow the voice of a
[7:58] stranger oh it ought to make somebody
[8:00] shout in here now we look at this thing
[8:04] and you could see say what brother
[8:06] Brooks uh uh you know God what would he
[8:11] do remember Jesus Christ the same
[8:13] yesterday today and forever he cannot
[8:16] change so however he handled the people
[8:20] in his
[8:23] day will be the same way he handled in
[8:27] our day he never never made it so clear
[8:31] for those who tried to or would try to
[8:35] figure it out he was looking for those
[8:38] who would have
[8:40] faith right because it is faith that
[8:43] pleases God not you're trying to figure
[8:46] it out it is faith that please God and
[8:50] once you have faith to please God God
[8:52] will then give you understanding coming
[8:55] from the message Hebrew he said listen
[8:58] he said our father eat Mana in the
[9:00] wilderness for 40 years he said I am the
[9:03] bread of the life that come from God out
[9:04] of Heaven I am the bread of life Moses
[9:07] didn't give you the bre that bread my
[9:10] father give you the bread and I am that
[9:14] I am the bread that come from God out of
[9:17] Heaven if a man eats this eats this will
[9:22] never die now I want you to put yourself
[9:25] in the
[9:26] audience of Jesus Christ
[9:30] and this thing has happened hundreds of
[9:32] years way before he come on the scene
[9:36] he's talking about the bread of life and
[9:39] he's telling you that's the bread that
[9:42] they ate I'm it amen now come on how are
[9:47] you going to figure that one out you
[9:50] can't the only way that you could
[9:52] understand that is that God would give
[9:54] you the grace to spiritually
[9:56] discern what he was talking about and
[9:59] remember even his disciples didn't
[10:02] understand
[10:05] him he said and goes on and he talks
[10:07] about it let me read on he says why he
[10:11] said you mean to tell he said Moses the
[10:13] one that told you that he longed to see
[10:16] my day and he saw it in a portion what
[10:19] was Jesus doing
[10:22] purposely confusing
[10:26] them purposely
[10:29] confusing them because they thought they
[10:32] had it all lined out
[10:35] correctly and here was Jesus basically
[10:38] telling this thing that you saw that
[10:41] Moses did amen was just a shout of a
[10:44] type it was just a a a a forerunner of
[10:47] the real thing but here's the real thing
[10:50] I am the bread of
[10:52] life and you got to eat of me
[10:59] oh Lord all right he said I am that rock
[11:04] Blessed Be His holy name I am that rock
[11:07] how could he be that Rock that Rock was
[11:10] a spiritual rock it followed the
[11:12] children of Israel and Moses had to had
[11:14] a stick in his hand which was a judgment
[11:16] Rod of God God told him to Smite The
[11:19] Rock he smoked the Rock and when he did
[11:21] water came from the Rock and Christ was
[11:24] that rock and the Judgment of God
[11:26] penalty of sin was struck upon him God
[11:30] calls to lay on him the iniquity of us
[11:32] all and the iniquity bursted forth his
[11:36] heart and from his heart poured the Holy
[11:39] Spirit like rivers of water to a
[11:41] perishing dying people I am the rock
[11:44] that was in the
[11:46] wilderness now this is what really
[11:48] struck me a lot of time you think you
[11:50] understand stuff amen but you know you
[11:52] always look at the side the water and
[11:54] the blood came from the side but you got
[11:57] to realize before it could come through
[11:58] the side it had to come from the
[12:01] heart come oh my so the Bride of Jesus
[12:05] Christ not just came through the side
[12:07] but she came from the heart of
[12:11] God that was her think about it think
[12:14] about it amen so the he We Came From The
[12:18] Heart Of God that was powerful to me and
[12:22] Moses had been dead 800 years now we
[12:25] know that you got a devil in other words
[12:28] you crazy man that's basically what they
[12:31] said to Jesus you're crazy you're not
[12:35] even 800 years ago and you telling me
[12:37] you was there see had they only known if
[12:41] they knew who he was now think about
[12:45] this these deci these Pharisees and
[12:48] Sadducees didn't know but here come
[12:50] Nicodemus and said
[12:52] Rabbi we know that thou be a teacher
[12:55] come from
[12:56] God right now
[12:59] they one group called him crazy
[13:02] Nicodemus says but there are some of us
[13:05] who know you came from God what was it
[13:08] Nicodemus was searching something on the
[13:11] inside of him was really moving him to
[13:14] know who this man
[13:16] was you think Jesus would have told him
[13:19] plainly but Jesus said unto him Marvel
[13:22] not
[13:24] Nicodemus you must be born again what
[13:26] was he doing humbling Nicodemus because
[13:29] you understand he was a a great scholar
[13:31] perhaps un studying under G and all of
[13:34] these things and he he was a a great
[13:36] scholar and then God drops in a
[13:39] doctrinal issue that he has never heard
[13:40] of before you must be born again now
[13:44] Nicodemus had never heard that before
[13:46] never seen it before never heard a
[13:48] report of it before but here God drops
[13:51] that into him right and this is not a
[13:54] dumb question it sounds like it because
[13:56] listen we only know one way of birth and
[13:59] that's through a woman and Nicodemus
[14:01] really asked the question in in a
[14:03] powerful way he says well tell me how
[14:06] can I be born again must I into my
[14:08] mother's womb a second time now I don't
[14:11] know what he was thinking about on that
[14:12] end but he said he asked the question to
[14:15] be born oh but he says mother not
[14:18] Nicodemus I'll tell you that which is
[14:20] born of flesh is flesh and that which is
[14:23] of spirit in spirit you must be born
[14:25] again in other words there's a world
[14:28] here that you was born in it was natural
[14:31] but there's another world the only way
[14:34] that you can be born it must be
[14:36] spiritually amen so he was taking a
[14:39] natural world and a spiritual world and
[14:40] then bringing it together said both of
[14:42] them need a birth in order for you to
[14:45] enter into it w come on Jesus I love the
[14:50] Lord listen they thought he was crazy
[14:54] and he said before Abraham was I am I
[14:57] was that great I am that was in in the
[14:59] burning bush I'm that fire that was in
[15:01] the burning bush I'm that angel that
[15:04] went before him now you
[15:08] know that he was bogling their minds now
[15:12] I want you to understand by the grace of
[15:15] God he wasn't just like he wasn't such a
[15:17] man this man spoke with
[15:20] authority I mean he it was his words his
[15:23] very life it was it was there's no way
[15:26] that a natural man could ever hear him
[15:29] and ever be the same regardless of what
[15:32] they thought about him that voice
[15:35] penetrated because it was the sword of
[15:37] the
[15:40] word he that I come from God and I go
[15:43] back to God he came from God and made
[15:46] flesh and dwelt Among Us went back to
[15:48] the same pill of fire and he is tonight
[15:51] after 2,000 years the same yesterday
[15:54] today and forever doing the same
[16:00] things leading his blessed children and
[16:04] many are coming in because of unbelief
[16:07] amen really we look at this he says then
[16:10] he limited the other day he talks about
[16:12] arrest he said if Joshua had given them
[16:14] that rest we wouldn't need for for
[16:17] another time or another day for this
[16:20] rest but this rest amen is given by the
[16:23] Holy
[16:24] Ghost is that all right now one of the
[16:27] things that we look at Jesus Christ and
[16:29] I'm going to tell you something he never
[16:31] left out of here without finishing his
[16:36] work he finished his work every
[16:40] individual that was thought of by God
[16:44] predestinated to come down to do a work
[16:47] never left without the work being
[16:50] done it was finished now you what Moses
[16:54] but Moses still got a chance to
[16:57] look at the promised land is that right
[17:01] in other words he was able to view the
[17:02] new vehicle but he wasn't able to drive
[17:04] it and that's the way it was God gave
[17:07] him sight and gave him understanding of
[17:10] what it was like but he had to do it
[17:13] that way it was not a mistake though
[17:17] Moses did what he did God still worked
[17:20] it toward his good in other words the
[17:23] Redemption plan was still in process now
[17:26] you say what brothers what are you
[17:27] saying
[17:29] uh we are living in a day where people
[17:32] uh uh uh how can I say it they don't
[17:35] even know the power of the name of
[17:40] Jesus I mean they don't know the name or
[17:42] the power now but in Revelations 2113
[17:45] let's turn there quickly there's power
[17:48] in the name of Jesus it didn't
[17:52] stop with the prophet it stop it didn't
[17:54] stop that name was powerful before will
[17:57] and Brandon ever step a foot on the air
[18:00] it'll always be
[18:02] powerful but we find out that there's so
[18:04] many people that don't want to give
[18:06] honor to the name that is why we don't
[18:10] see what we ought to be
[18:15] seen and the Bible said if your
[18:18] conscience don't condemn you he said you
[18:20] know that's the problem is we we we we
[18:23] don't have enough confidence in doing
[18:26] anything because often times with got
[18:29] things in our conscience that won't
[18:31] allow us
[18:32] to right the Bible said if your
[18:34] conscience don't condemn you neither
[18:36] will I so why aren't we doing things
[18:39] because there's something in our
[18:41] conscience that makes us feel unworthy
[18:44] oh come on somebody and the Bible says
[18:46] amen that when the Holy Ghost come he
[18:49] comes to liberate your conscience in
[18:51] other words he come to give you a good
[18:53] conscience a clean conscience to who
[18:55] toward God
[18:59] Revelation
[19:03] 213 it says I know th
[19:06] works and where thou dwelleth even where
[19:09] Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my
[19:12] name and H has not denied my faith even
[19:16] in those days wherein anpus was the
[19:19] faithful model now we know what this
[19:20] scripture is all about we know there
[19:22] amen by the grace of God Amen during the
[19:25] pergamus Age the uh protestantism and
[19:27] Catholicism married each other is that
[19:29] right amen and we realize by the grace
[19:32] of God that's when the trinitarian
[19:33] doctrine came in Focus around that time
[19:36] the father son and Hol yes just like
[19:39] it's difficult for you right now to
[19:41] witness the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:43] Christ it was more difficult for
[19:47] them because they knew that if they
[19:50] witnessed that name it called it was it
[19:53] was a issue for
[19:55] death come on somebody amen and it's
[19:59] that's how it is now amen but the Bible
[20:02] said they held to that name you got to
[20:05] realize it was powerful that they held
[20:07] to that name because amen remember Paul
[20:10] say some say y'all see for some of this
[20:12] and some of that and some so that Spirit
[20:13] of division and exalted man was already
[20:17] in
[20:18] process hello already in process but
[20:22] Paul said I didn't die for you I I none
[20:25] of y'all I didn't and so therefore you
[20:27] don't get baptized in my name you don't
[20:29] you don't do those things amen that's
[20:31] you denying the true Gospel of Jesus
[20:37] Christ so by the time 370 ad came amen
[20:42] they had the World Council of churches
[20:45] they gathered together the real
[20:47] Christian had no business being
[20:50] there that's like if the pope call a
[20:53] counsel amen of all the churches you
[20:55] think you're going to need you don't go
[20:58] you don't belong to
[21:01] that and those real Christians had no
[21:03] business going there and they suffer
[21:06] consequences for
[21:08] going cuz I want you to understand
[21:11] you're not dealing with Doctrine only
[21:13] you're dealing with
[21:17] Spirits he said you hold fast you kept
[21:20] my name and that means you you you you
[21:23] you kept it carefully and Faithfully in
[21:27] other words no other name is exalted
[21:29] above this name Jesus Christ no other
[21:34] and if you find yourself doing that
[21:36] you're
[21:39] wrong we got to finish the work and the
[21:43] only way the work will be finished is in
[21:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[21:47] the only way the work will be
[21:51] finished you be persecuted by for
[21:53] because of it that that's all right amen
[21:57] the Bible the Bible according to Hebrews
[21:58] 12: 2 says amen that Jesus Christ is the
[22:02] author and finisher of our faith now I'm
[22:05] preaching Jesus a little bit tonight
[22:07] because I want you to realize by the
[22:09] grace of God even in the Philadelphian
[22:11] age the Bible said you've held on to my
[22:13] name even though you've got a little
[22:15] strength left you've held on to it what
[22:18] about
[22:20] now come on somebody oh I wonder who
[22:23] would help me lift the name amen because
[22:25] that's the name there is no other name
[22:31] second Timothy 2:19 it says nevertheless
[22:34] the foundation of God stand at the sure
[22:36] having this seal the Lord knoweth them
[22:39] that are his listen you can't just claim
[22:42] the name of Jesus and live any kind of
[22:45] way and everyone that nameth the name of
[22:49] Christ depart from
[22:54] iniquity second Timothy 2:19 is that all
[22:57] right amen those who use his name must
[23:01] depart from
[23:05] Evil oh the Bible says that Hebrews 12:2
[23:08] I'm going to read it all the way he says
[23:10] looking unto Jesus the author and finish
[23:11] of our faith who for the joy that was
[23:15] set before him endured the cross the joy
[23:19] that was set before him endured the
[23:21] cross despising the shame and sat down
[23:23] at the right hand of of the Throne of
[23:26] God so what are you saying brother
[23:29] amen we've got a work to do and that's
[23:31] where I've come amen by the grace of God
[23:34] I said the power of God is already been
[23:37] released you know we we're looking for
[23:39] something and it's already here hey is
[23:42] that right Prophet God said we always
[23:44] look in the back we always looking in
[23:46] front but we're failing to see what God
[23:49] is doing now let me tell you something
[23:52] if you living a holy life in this age
[23:55] that ain't nothing but the power of God
[24:00] there ain't no way your human being your
[24:02] human part of you can live a holy life
[24:04] in this age right now no way
[24:08] impossible it takes the Holy Ghost and
[24:11] if you're living holy you walking
[24:14] talking
[24:15] Miracle yes you
[24:17] are but we've come Amen to declare the
[24:21] works of the Lord we've come to finish
[24:24] his work that's what a bride is all
[24:26] about we've come to finish his work now
[24:29] listen what he said he gave us a promise
[24:32] amen see because you and I must
[24:34] understand death can't harm
[24:39] us death going to have to release us
[24:41] said
[24:42] W is that right you said well Brothers
[24:45] what are you saying remember before
[24:47] Abraham and Sarah died God had already
[24:50] changed them back
[24:52] young in this
[24:55] life y'all looking at me amen everybody
[24:58] looking at the Rapture in so many ways
[24:59] and so am I I tell you the truth but I
[25:01] tell you what I'm expecting to get
[25:05] better I'm expecting to get better is
[25:09] that right something's got to keep
[25:10] happening in order for me to produce
[25:13] Christ yes sir Jesus said John 11:25 he
[25:18] said yes Jesus said unto her I am the
[25:20] resurrection and the life he that
[25:22] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[25:23] shall he lives is that right talking to
[25:26] that woman at the W oh come on somebody
[25:28] he said though he said he said I am the
[25:32] resurrection and the life you know what
[25:35] that mean that means I don't care how
[25:37] dead you were before God Found You When
[25:40] God comes into you you must come to
[25:43] life that's what the sh glory is all
[25:46] about this message didn't come to bring
[25:48] us Amen to the outer Court of the Holy
[25:50] place this message is about the shakina
[25:53] glory this message is to prove that God
[25:56] took a a rod
[25:58] and that Rod represented
[26:01] you okay you said that Rod represented
[26:03] the word who are you then you are the
[26:06] word that Rod represented you a dead
[26:10] stick a dead people a dead tree that God
[26:14] brought to life he didn't just bring it
[26:16] to life but he burn it it brought forth
[26:19] fruit so when you come into the kind of
[26:21] Glory all you got to do is stay in
[26:24] there and you stay in there and God will
[26:28] will do the
[26:29] rest is that the word nothing but the
[26:33] word Jesus Christ being I'm I'm I'm
[26:36] working with Jesus for a while because I
[26:38] need you to see this amen because a lot
[26:41] of people think let me tell y'all
[26:43] something there's so many uh uh uh uh uh
[26:47] counterfeits and so many things Satan
[26:50] can uh put on us or make us see now let
[26:54] me tell you something if your experience
[26:57] doesn't match up with the word get rid
[26:59] of your
[27:00] experience the word
[27:03] first right cuz Pentecostals and all of
[27:05] them you know they look at oh God did
[27:08] this I saw a thunderbolt and all the
[27:10] Lord spoke I I mean here it
[27:13] is you know women preachers they said
[27:15] well you know God spoke to me and he
[27:17] told me to do this and I'm like yes he
[27:20] did more than likely he did just like he
[27:22] told Bill go ahead on I told you no in
[27:26] the first place and you want to go ahead
[27:27] on don't you see that
[27:32] angel let me say it naturally so we
[27:35] adults we can understand this a woman
[27:38] don't have
[27:41] seed so how a woman being a pastor can
[27:45] produce
[27:47] seed wrong vessel do you know what
[27:49] you're doing with
[27:52] God male and female the church is the
[27:56] female the preach is the male
[28:00] you break that order you got something
[28:06] wicked God once W winked at that
[28:08] ignorance he don't now because the word
[28:11] the true word has come oh your sons and
[28:14] your daughters read act read it you see
[28:16] God separates two people two seeds my
[28:20] sons and my daughters your sons and your
[28:22] daughters two different kinds of people
[28:25] the anointed will fall on the wheat and
[28:27] the tail
[28:31] y'all getting quiet but it's the truth
[28:35] yes they're going to do it the same
[28:37] anointing that falls on the wheat falls
[28:39] on the tear they have signs they have
[28:40] wonders they cry for rain they cry for
[28:43] Revival but they are who they are and
[28:46] listen it was only in our day that we
[28:48] had an angel from God who was a servant
[28:51] of the Lord called brother Brandon comes
[28:53] along and he binds the
[28:56] tears didn't he say God said there come
[28:59] angels and they will bind the Tails well
[29:01] how did they bind them they put the
[29:02] Pentecostal the apostolic the the
[29:04] Presbyterian the Baptist the Catholic
[29:07] and the prophet of God said they're all
[29:08] in the same pot when he did that he
[29:10] binded
[29:15] them he bind them no other preacher do
[29:18] did that they weren't ordained to do it
[29:22] but now we in this last day it was so
[29:25] simple nobody could catch it it's only
[29:28] now that we see why they are doing what
[29:30] they do come on somebody it's the
[29:34] trou in the same
[29:39] part he was so totally yielded to God
[29:43] Amen as a man I'm trying to hurry he
[29:44] said John 5:30 I can of my own self do
[29:48] nothing as I hear I judge my judgment is
[29:51] just because I seek what not my own will
[29:58] but the will of the
[29:59] Father which have sent me in other words
[30:03] I didn't come to produce nothing I don't
[30:06] need a slant to the message I don't need
[30:08] a new logo on it I don't need nothing
[30:11] it's Jesus Christ the pure word of
[30:14] God y'all hear what I'm saying I ain't
[30:17] up here for a big name matter of fact I
[30:19] ran from all that stuff the whole point
[30:22] is I didn't come here to do my will I
[30:24] came to do his and every True Believer
[30:28] comes to do the will of
[30:31] God even as Jesus said lo I come in the
[30:34] volume of the book to do thy will oh God
[30:37] it is written of me and I can Tru to say
[30:40] the same thing so can you because you
[30:43] got to find yourself in the
[30:46] book like I said the other day amen you
[30:50] came to Ruth Naomi all of those amen you
[30:52] come to you know what what if if that's
[30:55] why God couldn't just leave Mary as the
[30:57] only Tye
[30:59] cuz there was some of us like Tamar
[31:01] there was some of us huh come on
[31:03] somebody there were some of us like Rah
[31:06] come on there were we these examples
[31:09] that were in the genealogy of Jesus
[31:11] Jesus Christ was that set there for you
[31:13] and me so when we saw that we could see
[31:16] that regardless how Wicked we were we
[31:19] were still in him one generation
[31:31] I'm so glad y'all full of life tonight
[31:36] am worship about the knock come on y'all
[31:39] know what I'm saying amen listen he's
[31:42] totally yielded to God is that right
[31:45] listen even according to Isaiah 28:16
[31:48] Jesus Christ is a sure Foundation if the
[31:51] foundation is no good the house can't
[31:55] stand so what the foundation had to come
[31:58] he had to be laid and the house was
[32:00] built upon him right oh come on somebody
[32:03] what was the foundation other than Jesus
[32:05] Christ himself he was not only the
[32:07] foundation but he was also the
[32:09] Cornerstone he oh he laid his life down
[32:13] Hallelujah and because he laid his life
[32:15] down the Bible said he was exalted above
[32:18] all he's still exalted W come on
[32:23] somebody amen
[32:26] amen oh ain't God good to
[32:29] us now Matthew 17:5 I'm I'm reading a
[32:32] lot of scripture while he yet spake
[32:34] Behold a bright Cloud over outed them
[32:36] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[32:38] which said this is my beloved Son in
[32:40] whom I am well pleased hear ye him now
[32:43] isin't that funny God speaks out of the
[32:47] cloud and said this is my beloved Son
[32:49] not Moses and Elijah they were they were
[32:52] already gone he said this is my beloved
[32:54] Son Jesus Christ hear ye him right now
[33:01] St John but see there are those who
[33:03] can't
[33:05] hear right there are so those who can't
[33:07] hear when the Glorious Cloud came and
[33:10] the power of God came in our day there's
[33:12] still people who can't hear there were
[33:15] those of us who can hear it those of us
[33:17] who can see it at the appearing he said
[33:20] shall they have faith amen when the son
[33:22] of man when he be revealed will they
[33:24] have faith not a faith the faith without
[33:27] that Faith still carry on faith in who
[33:31] Jesus Christ himself listen St John 10:
[33:34] 20 says many of them said he ha a devil
[33:38] and is mad why hear ye
[33:41] him right when God say hear him the
[33:45] devil is asking the question the
[33:46] theologians of that day it says why are
[33:49] you hearing him this man got a
[33:52] devil didn't not they do it to our
[33:54] prophet in our day come on somebody
[33:57] you know why uh a lot of time people say
[34:00] well y'all exalted him understand the
[34:01] prophet in his message is
[34:03] insane cuz he doesn't have a seed he is
[34:06] what you call a spiritual unic God has
[34:09] so designed him that he won't add or
[34:12] take
[34:14] away see he can only produce what God
[34:17] speaks through him that's why many times
[34:20] the prophet God stood on that P says I'm
[34:22] waiting on him or he's here y'all hear
[34:26] what I'm saying amen and you ought to be
[34:28] you you and I ought to be spiritual
[34:30] enough to know when God is speaking like
[34:33] I said when I listen to those tapes and
[34:34] I'm weeping it's not the voice of a man
[34:37] is the voice of a Voice come on somebody
[34:40] a voice in a
[34:43] voice oh my God John 10:20 many of them
[34:47] said he hath a devil is mad why hear ye
[34:49] him others said these are not the words
[34:51] of him that hath a devil can the devil
[34:53] Open the Eyes of the Blind and it was at
[34:56] Jerusalem the feast of the dedication
[34:58] and it was Winter Jesus walked in the
[35:00] temple in Solomon's porch then came the
[35:03] Jews round about him and said un him how
[35:04] long does thou make us to doubt if thou
[35:07] be the Christ tell us
[35:10] plainly Jesus answered them I told you
[35:14] believe not the works that I do in my
[35:17] father's name they bear witness of me
[35:19] but ye believe me not because ye are not
[35:21] of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep
[35:25] hear my voice and I know them and they
[35:27] follow me y'all hear what I'm saying and
[35:30] I give unto them eternal life and they
[35:32] shall never perish neither shall any man
[35:34] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[35:36] which gave them me is greater than all
[35:38] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[35:41] my father's hand I am my fathers are one
[35:45] why is he using that term no man no man
[35:49] no
[35:50] man is able to pluck them
[35:53] out he's talking about the
[35:55] preachers no preacher
[35:58] is able to pluck them out of my hand
[36:01] bring your word who at work
[36:03] can I talked to a coach friend of mine
[36:06] and I'm not going to call no names but
[36:08] he was telling me the same brother that
[36:10] tried to get me to turn from this
[36:11] message called him the other day of
[36:13] whenever it was and trying to tell him
[36:15] stuff I said brother he said pray for
[36:17] him I said I don't I said because them
[36:20] people done pray they done Blas the Holy
[36:22] Ghost I said why should I pray for that
[36:25] right I said brother understand my
[36:27] people hear my voice a simple simple
[36:30] verse but it stands true for the day you
[36:34] following all of these other voices but
[36:36] the true sheep of God knows amen when
[36:39] the voice of God is being
[36:42] spoken is that right they tell me amen
[36:46] whether it be cows sheep or whatever if
[36:48] they little little little kitties or
[36:50] whatever get to screaming in holler that
[36:52] cow don't run from little uh um from
[36:55] Little calf to calf that cow runs
[36:57] straight to the cow to the to the little
[36:59] one is that right amen if if animals
[37:02] know the voice of their parents how can
[37:04] you and I say we're spiritual and we
[37:06] can't know the voice of
[37:08] God it's a straight and narrow way
[37:11] that's just it I was we was getting this
[37:13] talking and stuff I said you don't have
[37:15] to a man or woman don't have to have the
[37:17] Holy Ghost to dress
[37:19] holy no you don't you don't have to have
[37:23] the Holy Ghost to dress holy there's a
[37:24] lot of people out there dressing more
[37:26] holy than what we call Holy don't have
[37:29] an ounce of Holiness Holy Ghost but they
[37:32] know it's
[37:36] right come on somebody the Revelation
[37:39] people need to know is what Holiness
[37:42] is once you know what that is you fall
[37:45] in
[37:48] line Ain no ain't no many skirts getting
[37:51] up in there I don't mean know how it
[37:53] ain't happening people and you and I you
[37:56] say oh brother you're being too hard how
[37:59] can I be too the word give me a sword
[38:02] somebody let me touch you with a sword
[38:05] just a little bit right that sword going
[38:08] to hurt there ain't no soft
[38:12] sword God didn't give us nothing but a
[38:14] sword how can I be too hard other than
[38:18] trying to kill it and I'm not trying to
[38:20] kill your flesh I'm trying to call the
[38:22] kill a demon that got your flesh living
[38:28] huh that's what it's all about come on
[38:31] somebody I was telling somebody I said
[38:33] understand the preacher he's slinging
[38:34] The Sword and I'mma tell you you ever
[38:36] whip somebody with the kid and you you
[38:38] you hitting them and then all of a
[38:39] sudden it hit you too oh my God you get
[38:42] more you should not supposed to get more
[38:45] angry but angry but it
[38:47] hurts then you get frustrated with them
[38:50] for moving out of the
[38:52] way but my point is a sword the
[38:55] preachers being cut just like this CH
[38:57] children of God you think it's you just
[39:00] only one that's being wh but I'm
[39:01] preaching under inspiration so you got
[39:03] to understand what's good for the goose
[39:04] is good for the
[39:09] gander it is but you know what people
[39:11] don't want truth because they don't want
[39:13] to live it that's it you can't make them
[39:17] and that's everywhere not just in this
[39:19] assembly everywhere you go is the same
[39:22] thing
[39:29] Isaiah
[39:32] 43:7 it's
[39:36] true a brother was talking and he was
[39:38] saying brother I preached the other day
[39:39] he said man I felt so bad I felt like I
[39:42] preached too hard I said let me tell you
[39:44] something brother it's not a time to
[39:46] play with people's Soul it's not why
[39:49] should I just play with your soul and
[39:50] Hell Is Right There beneath
[39:54] us a lot of people don't think they
[39:56] going there because they figure you know
[39:57] I don't know what they think I'm just
[39:59] saying toight whether you or me I got to
[40:03] give an account for this and I'd rather
[40:05] you be upset and mad at me than
[40:08] God Isaiah 43 and7 it's true I say that
[40:12] to my own family they don't listen to me
[40:16] you they
[40:17] don't but it don't it's not that I don't
[40:19] preach it to them hello y'all getting
[40:22] quiet but it's true I preach the same
[40:26] thing to my family my children children
[40:27] I don't care if they are married I still
[40:29] tell them the
[40:33] truth I can't make them just like God
[40:35] ain't going to make us do it but the
[40:38] Bible said what I read that scripture
[40:40] they be willing the real people of God
[40:43] are willing you ain't got to beat them
[40:45] all over the head the real true Sons and
[40:47] Daughters of God are willing to submit
[40:50] to
[40:52] God Isaiah
[40:55] 43:7 even everyone that is called by my
[40:58] name for I have created him for my glory
[41:02] I have formed him yay I have made him
[41:08] now I want you to understand where I'm
[41:10] going with this because I said week or
[41:13] two ago how do you know Satan and the
[41:16] way he is is because of the way his
[41:19] children
[41:21] behave because Jesus said you are of
[41:24] your father the devil you do the very
[41:26] Works he do
[41:28] right so watch the children's the
[41:30] devil's children and you know how
[41:32] Lucifer is Watch God's children and
[41:35] you'll know how God
[41:38] is come on somebody getting quiet I
[41:42] don't have my watch on
[41:43] so I meant to I anyway so we must be
[41:47] even as our father is that right the
[41:50] Bible says according to Colossians 3:13
[41:52] forbearing one another forgiving one
[41:54] another If any man have a quarrel
[41:56] against any even as Christ forgave you
[41:59] so also do ye so I I went down even at
[42:04] Craigs church I preached on communion
[42:06] I'mma tell y'all something I preached on
[42:08] that communion that that Sunday morning
[42:10] and uh um y'all know it was tough on
[42:14] some but let me put it this way I had
[42:16] never seen so many return
[42:19] am it was almost 90% of the people that
[42:22] was there that morning came for
[42:24] communion young and old and I told him
[42:26] I've never seen this before never in the
[42:29] course of the 14 years I preached and
[42:31] pastored in L I had never in my entire
[42:34] life seen that many people come back for
[42:36] communion usually people run from
[42:39] it but I told them this I said listen
[42:42] and this is why God got me preaching I'm
[42:44] G tell y'all something this is the love
[42:46] age excuse me the love age Divine love
[42:49] so what's contrary to Divine love hatred
[42:52] why how come hatred comes offenses how
[42:55] come hat builds up because people don't
[43:00] want to forgive not they don't have the
[43:01] ability because we got power right now
[43:04] and I'm telling you right now I have to
[43:06] fight all the time every day almost
[43:10] cleaning myself of things that people
[43:13] may say a do to me to keep me from
[43:15] hatred hatred hello somebody you can't
[43:19] let somebody hurt your feelings or just
[43:21] say something to you and you don't make
[43:22] it right you are allowing Satan to build
[43:25] a fortress in your heart and in your
[43:27] spirit I don't want to hurt their
[43:29] feeling they don't hurt
[43:31] yours you just do it in
[43:34] love and y'all know what I'm saying oh
[43:38] my and at the end of the road you still
[43:40] got to forgive there's a lot of people
[43:42] in Hell who won't forgive who didn't
[43:44] forgive who would love to come back they
[43:46] did everything right but they just
[43:48] couldn't forgive and that's a law of God
[43:50] Jesus said if you don't forgive your
[43:52] brother neither will I forgive you he is
[43:54] so strict on that he said even if you're
[43:56] praying and you remember you got a
[43:58] problem you get up from your knees make
[44:00] it right then come back that's the word
[44:04] and that's all of
[44:06] us and for those of you who work I can't
[44:09] imagine what you go
[44:12] through I just know some of the stories
[44:15] my family tell different one tells me I
[44:17] can't imagine it and you got to keep
[44:20] that sweet loving
[44:22] Spirit hello somebody and the only way
[44:26] you can do that is
[44:28] prayer cuz the devil going to purposely
[44:31] come get on your
[44:32] nerve right you're supposed to be dead
[44:35] so he wouldn't
[44:38] mat but that's when you realize you
[44:40] ain't As Dead As you think you are as
[44:41] when it gets on your nerve right amen
[44:43] but that's all right God gives us
[44:46] Grace is this okay amen listen forgiving
[44:51] one another Christ forgave you so also
[44:53] do ye Ephesians 1:19 and what is the
[44:57] exceeding greatness of his power toward
[44:58] us who believe according to the work of
[45:01] his power is that right which he wrought
[45:04] in Christ when he raised from the dead
[45:06] and set him at the right hand on the
[45:07] right hand in the Heavenly places now I
[45:10] I'm saying all of this to say this there
[45:13] is no
[45:16] excuse not for me not for
[45:19] you if we don't make it is because of
[45:23] our
[45:25] slackness hey is is the truth cuz God
[45:28] has not only given us the word for it
[45:30] but he's also given us the
[45:32] authority he's given us power
[45:36] people right he's given us power and
[45:39] lesson listen it's just like one of my
[45:41] grandbabies would do you say so and so
[45:44] you let's say uh you she picking up the
[45:47] paper and you say don't pick up the
[45:51] paper you said well didn't I tell you
[45:53] not to pick up the paper you know she
[45:55] might be doing all of this to let you
[45:57] know I picked it up and then what you
[45:58] going to do about
[46:04] it I'm just using that as an example but
[46:07] she knows that's your voice or he knows
[46:10] that's your voice but they have not
[46:13] learn to respect it because the
[46:15] authority hasn't been proven to
[46:18] them you must prove to them I'm the Voss
[46:22] I'm the one this voice when it speaks to
[46:25] you you must obey or you will face
[46:28] consequences and when you slack in that
[46:31] area there what is a
[46:34] voice it's just like any other voice if
[46:37] there's no
[46:38] Authority penalty behind it power of
[46:41] forc y'all hear what I'm saying that's
[46:44] what that's what what makes God God his
[46:47] voice and the penalty and Authority that
[46:50] comes with it you don't obey you die
[46:59] it's true it's true it's true well I
[47:01] don't want to spank
[47:03] them I I you breaking the word
[47:07] consequences come with
[47:08] it right spoil don't spank it you going
[47:11] spoil it you're ruining the child might
[47:13] not even see it until they become an
[47:15] adult but it's going to happen Ephesians
[47:17] 15 I had one of my children say Daddy I
[47:20] wish you to spank me more the first
[47:22] thing came to my mind is we need to
[47:24] redeem the time
[47:28] y'all believe the
[47:30] word come on y'all you don't have to say
[47:32] Amen see one word not believing it sends
[47:34] you to
[47:36] Hell one word broken one word not
[47:38] believing it will send you straight to
[47:41] Hell God knows what he says and he knows
[47:44] what he's doing he said you you know
[47:47] when when I don't know let's put it I
[47:49] wish we had a lot more parents in here
[47:52] because when you don't spank them like
[47:53] oh you ain't going to kill them like I
[47:55] heard somebody say that's what that fat
[47:57] part is about back that
[47:59] far God put some extra fat back
[48:05] there y'all looking at me like I'm crazy
[48:07] but it's
[48:09] true you can tell the people that the
[48:11] children are not being disciplined when
[48:13] they run in and out of like
[48:16] that well the law says who cares God's
[48:21] word come first oh I'm scared to be put
[48:24] in jail maybe that's what God wants you
[48:26] to do to be a
[48:29] testimony come on somebody we going to
[48:32] either stand for God or or cow down to
[48:34] the devil that's just all to it as long
[48:36] as you don't whip your children in anger
[48:38] and frustration you're all right cuz I
[48:40] tell you what even if the Lord don't get
[48:42] you the the angel of the Lord
[48:45] will right let's go on listen he goes on
[48:48] and says far above all principalities
[48:50] and Powers might Dominion in every name
[48:51] that is named not only in this world but
[48:54] also in that which is to come
[48:58] hello amen he's above all things he's a
[49:01] great I am Hallelujah we sing that song
[49:04] but understand this the name the Lord
[49:07] Jesus Christ is not just words or sounds
[49:10] there's Authority there's character
[49:12] there's power and it the demons can see
[49:15] it there's fire behind the
[49:18] name the demon sees
[49:21] it but we think it's just an ordinary
[49:24] name it's not an ordinary name the angel
[49:27] gave that name to him Hallelujah god
[49:31] named his own son and named him after
[49:33] him is that right there is no other name
[49:36] there's no greater name but what it is
[49:39] we don't use it like we ought
[49:44] to oh I'm going to say something here
[49:46] just a moment just hold on because I'm I
[49:48] don't want to keep it too long I don't
[49:49] know what time it is but he says in
[49:51] Ephesians 3:15 of whom the whole family
[49:55] in heaven and earth Earth is
[50:00] named like I was telling them in
[50:03] communion now there I said the problem
[50:04] is you and I don't recognize each other
[50:08] as being the body of
[50:09] Christ we treat each other like
[50:11] foreigners and strangers and I'm Jesus
[50:14] and so you are Jesus and everybody else
[50:16] in here amen that name of the name of
[50:18] the Lord has been entered uh you in his
[50:20] family and when we mistreat each other
[50:22] we're mistreating the Lord and that's
[50:25] why so many people are SI and Afflicted
[50:27] and the word of God said amen even
[50:30] dead now I'm going tell y'all something
[50:32] that that man that died he that man
[50:35] fussed and screamed at me on the
[50:38] phone screamed and holled at my wife
[50:41] hung up on her I called him he he did
[50:45] everything but profaned
[50:47] me and shortly after that that man got
[50:53] sick so much so I told his brother his
[50:56] his brother told him you better go
[50:59] confess and make it right with brother
[51:01] Brooks he did
[51:03] it but God still took it I prayed for
[51:07] him that ain't the first
[51:10] time I don't claim to be somebody but
[51:12] I'm going tell y'all something you got
[51:14] to be careful not just with me but with
[51:16] each
[51:17] other you can't just handle each other
[51:20] any kind of way and expect God not to
[51:23] judge you it's going to happen say the
[51:27] wrong things hurt somebody's feeling and
[51:29] you don't care about it and God said
[51:30] it's better to take a millstone tide
[51:32] about your neck and that's how much
[51:34] danger you are in with
[51:37] God I remember working at a rem end that
[51:39] man cursed me out that night amen and
[51:41] swore and and everything else and he was
[51:44] a friend he was a buddy he gave me a
[51:45] good job I loved working there but
[51:47] because of a bad report that man came
[51:49] and charged me amen like he did I mean
[51:51] literally had me crying two months amen
[51:54] from that point amen that man fell off a
[51:57] tractor amen with the stroke he lost his
[51:59] hotel he lost his business he lost
[52:01] everything to this day I don't know
[52:03] whether he Even's living
[52:04] now you can't do God's people that
[52:09] way it's
[52:12] wrong I didn't have enough of sense to
[52:14] to pray for him I loved him if I had if
[52:18] I had understood what God was going to
[52:19] do for him do with them I would have
[52:21] prayed I really would have
[52:24] prayed I'm telling you it it happens
[52:28] it's more it's been more it's been it's
[52:30] been a lot of I've seen a lot of
[52:33] things oh let's move on people of God
[52:37] and people will be sick and caring don't
[52:38] even know what's going on because you
[52:40] done open your mouth too many
[52:43] times y'all can't treat each other any
[52:46] kind of way and expect God to heal you
[52:48] or deliver you or to make it feel I
[52:50] don't care if his husband and wife you
[52:51] can't do it
[52:57] there's a power in the name of Jesus
[52:59] Christ and his name still lives because
[53:02] he still
[53:05] lives let me say that again I like the
[53:07] way that
[53:08] sound his name still lives because he
[53:11] still
[53:15] lives right it is the way it is God is
[53:19] so good to us amen so you look at this
[53:22] thing and the Bible says to have a good
[53:24] name is better is is is rather to be
[53:27] chosen uh than great riches now there
[53:31] ain't number one good
[53:34] name and that's the Lord Jesus right
[53:37] there's only one good name and he says
[53:38] to have that name amen is greater than
[53:41] having
[53:43] riches and loving uh favor rather than
[53:46] silver and gold so what is more
[53:50] important listen I'm trying to say
[53:51] something I haven't gotten there yet
[53:53] amen but I'm talking about living the
[53:55] name
[53:57] not just speaking it living it living it
[54:01] how did it's like a dog is a dog why
[54:04] because the dog lives the name a cat is
[54:07] a cat because the cat lives the name
[54:09] amen Jesus Christ is who he is he's God
[54:12] and you and I must live the name they
[54:15] call them Christian AR first because
[54:18] they lived the
[54:22] name oh I love this amen the Gentile
[54:25] Church would be called by a new name
[54:28] right Isaiah 62 And1 for Zion's sake
[54:30] will I not hold my peace and for
[54:32] Jerusalem's sake I will not rest into
[54:34] the righteousness thereof go forth as a
[54:37] brightness and the Salvation thereof as
[54:39] a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles
[54:42] shall see thy righteousness and all the
[54:44] kings thy Glory thou shal be called by a
[54:47] new name which the mouth of the Lord
[54:49] shall name is that
[54:52] right am I insane I really believe these
[54:56] scriptures
[54:59] I really believe this
[55:01] scripture and the Gentiles shall see thy
[55:04] righteousness and all Kings of thy glory
[55:07] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[55:09] which the mouth of the Lord shall name
[55:11] thou shal also be a Crown of Glory in
[55:14] the hand of the Lord and a royal diem in
[55:17] the hand of God right thou shall no more
[55:21] be termed forsaken neither shall thy
[55:24] land anymore be termed desolate now let
[55:26] me tell you something if I'm preaching
[55:28] on something that's catching your
[55:29] attention understand that's God and not
[55:31] me I don't know nobody else's business
[55:34] in
[55:35] here right so don't ever think it's me
[55:39] take it as being God and you'll prosper
[55:41] from it because I don't call nobody on
[55:43] the phone asking about y'all folks and
[55:45] what's going on in y'all lives I don't
[55:46] know
[55:47] nothing right so listen now and I'm not
[55:51] the one amen I'm not the kind of person
[55:53] that's gonna preach off on you off the
[55:55] pull pin anyway
[55:57] Thou shalt also be crowned of Glory in
[56:00] the hand of the Lord and the RO die in
[56:01] him in the land hand of God thou shallal
[56:04] no more be ter forsaken neither shall
[56:06] thy hand land anymore be termed desolate
[56:09] but Thou shalt be called hepah and thy
[56:11] land bua for the Lord delighted in thee
[56:14] and thy land shall be
[56:16] married now I don't you can read that
[56:19] all the way through because I got to
[56:20] keep moving all the way down to the
[56:21] seventh verse but I want you to
[56:23] understand God Delights in me he
[56:25] Delights in you
[56:28] right we've got a work to finish I
[56:30] haven't even got where I want to go but
[56:31] my whole point is is that the same power
[56:34] that Jesus got we have if you don't have
[56:37] it you need to get
[56:39] it this is not a time you know I put it
[56:42] this way God the day of Education or
[56:45] being educated into God is
[56:48] over you got to be born again Luther
[56:51] might have got away with it Wesley might
[56:52] have got away with it but not in this
[56:54] day you got to be born again
[56:58] D God finds changing the name is
[57:00] necessary is that right is God changes
[57:03] call us to do something new or better
[57:05] yet different he attached a new name to
[57:08] it this is what he has done throughout
[57:10] time is that right when Abraham was 90
[57:13] years old and nine the Lord appeared to
[57:15] Abraham and said I am the almighty God
[57:18] walk before me and be thy perfect how
[57:21] was he going to be perfect amen when he
[57:23] was a man born of a woman born in sin sh
[57:26] in iniquity God had to provide a way for
[57:29] him to walk perfectly before him and
[57:31] what was that way he gave Abraham an
[57:33] unconditional Covenant Hallelujah that's
[57:36] what he did for the children of God in
[57:38] our day if God gave us the same Covenant
[57:42] is because it's unconditionally that's
[57:44] why you're
[57:48] perfect God then attached his name to
[57:51] Abram and called him Abraham ham means
[57:55] god and I will make my Covenant between
[57:58] me and thee and will multiply thy seed
[58:01] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[58:03] and God talk with him saying as for me
[58:06] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[58:08] shalt be a father of many nations
[58:10] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[58:12] Abram but thy name Shall be Called
[58:14] Abraham for a father of many nations
[58:16] have I made thee and I will make thee
[58:18] exceedingly faithful and I will make
[58:20] nation of thee and Kings shall come out
[58:22] of thee and I will establish my Covenant
[58:24] between me and thee and thy Pro seed
[58:26] after thee in the their generation for
[58:28] Everlasting Covenant be called God
[58:30] excuse me to be a god unto thee and thy
[58:32] seed let me say something remember
[58:34] brother BR tells that story about that
[58:37] woman whose son was in the Army I think
[58:39] it was overseas in
[58:42] England and she was at home in America
[58:45] starving to
[58:48] death welfare and all
[58:51] that and uh somehow I think it was a
[58:55] social service member who who it was
[58:56] came to visit them and and visit her and
[59:00] and she was telling about her son and
[59:02] she says all I God he just he writes me
[59:05] but all I got is these little pretty
[59:07] pictures he sends
[59:08] me y'all remember the story pretty
[59:12] pictures and you know what they were
[59:14] Bank drafts here this word woman was
[59:16] starving to death sitting on a lot of
[59:20] money and didn't know what to do with it
[59:23] oh I thought ain't that the way the
[59:25] bride is is that way a lot of Christian
[59:27] let put that way we're setting on all of
[59:29] this power all of this Authority all of
[59:31] this that we got and we don't even know
[59:33] what to do with it cast the thing
[59:38] in yeah you cast it in you take it
[59:42] before God and say here it is this is
[59:44] what you said you said if I believe
[59:45] it'll happen boom there it is you cash
[59:48] it in and don't you know when you go up

[1:04:22] God was changing something she couldn't
[1:04:24] be just the old church he couldn't be
[1:04:26] the old church God had to attach his
[1:04:28] name to
[1:04:29] it that's what God did in our day oh
[1:04:32] come on
[1:04:35] somebody we had to have a man by the
[1:04:38] last name of
[1:04:40] Branham ham hm like

[1:04:51] connected those angels amen the Bible we
[1:04:54] don't know what happened to them but
[1:04:55] they were true Servants of the
[1:04:57] Lord am I making sense even Saul
[1:05:01] couldn't keep his name you can't that's
[1:05:03] why somebody I got a a young man coming
[1:05:05] to church Sunday Lord's willing he and
[1:05:07] his wife uh H H I was I was at the phone
[1:05:10] place and uh doing some business there

[1:05:14] where the place was he said oh I'll be
[1:05:16] there he said if nothing should happen
[1:05:18] he said matter of fact I'm off on Sunday
[1:05:19] a young man 23 years old he said well me
[1:05:22] and my wife we hadn't been to church in
[1:05:23] a while it's time for us to come cuz he
[1:05:25] asked me as the question what what did I
[1:05:27] said none I said I don't even like to be
[1:05:29] called that I said we right with the
[1:05:30] word I said we don't put a period behind
[1:05:33] us we put a Karma I said because if as
[1:05:36] long as it's a Karma I said you know if
[1:05:38] it's a perod nothing can't leave and
[1:05:40] nothing can't come but when it's a Karma
[1:05:41] you can constantly
[1:05:43] receed he said oh oh I like that I like
[1:05:47] that answer you know so anyway this man
[1:05:51] put my number in his
[1:05:54] phone to make sure sure he doesn't he
[1:05:56] won't won't get lost on
[1:05:59] Sunday now I didn't do that God did
[1:06:04] it amen ain't God good to us now Paul
[1:06:08] said Not only did God listen God could
[1:06:10] have called Paul's name Paul at the time
[1:06:12] of birth but God was changing something
[1:06:14] his name was Saul God was Paul amen and
[1:06:17] then he says what in Galatians he said
[1:06:19] but when it please God who separated me
[1:06:20] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:06:23] his grace to reveal his son where in me
[1:06:27] not at church not on the corner
[1:06:29] somewhere to reveal his son in me that's
[1:06:32] where God wants to reveal his son in you
[1:06:36] as
[1:06:38] individuals that I might preach among
[1:06:40] the heathens immediately I conferred not
[1:06:43] with flesh and blood is that all right
[1:06:45] could y'all give me a few more
[1:06:47] minutes I just want to close out on
[1:06:49] these quotes if that's all right we we
[1:06:52] look at this in
[1:06:54] uh I
[1:06:58] you know in in in the first year brother
[1:07:00] Bon basically went on to saying I'm I'm
[1:07:01] going just paraphrase this he says
[1:07:03] basically he said I I don't I'm not
[1:07:05] going to call you uh uh uh church
[1:07:07] anymore but I'm going to call you bride
[1:07:10] you know and and y'all if you think that
[1:07:12] was a man saying that then you missed
[1:07:13] the whole thing but understand by the
[1:07:16] grace of God it's God Amen who's coming
[1:07:19] and showing us that there was a bride he
[1:07:22] couldn't have changed her
[1:07:23] name right if she wasn't there right
[1:07:28] like God came to Abraham and says you no
[1:07:30] no longer Abram
[1:07:32] but Abraham and understand the promises
[1:07:35] that Abraham received amen was given to
[1:07:38] him but you got to understand before his
[1:07:41] name was changed you got to understand
[1:07:43] too by the grace of God that before God
[1:07:45] could give these great Promises to the
[1:07:48] Bride of Jesus Christ I put it away his
[1:07:50] disciples he had to make sure Judas
[1:07:52] wasn't there
[1:07:55] father I would that they be one even as
[1:07:57] I W Judas wasn't there to hear that
[1:08:00] father you have known me before the
[1:08:01] foundation of the world all these things
[1:08:03] that he said in the 17th chapter Judah
[1:08:05] was already
[1:08:06] gone he didn't know that he didn't hear
[1:08:09] that because it wasn't for him now let
[1:08:13] me ask you let me say it this if you was
[1:08:15] Judas do you think you could hear what
[1:08:16] you're
[1:08:17] hearing if you were to betray the Gospel
[1:08:20] of Jesus Christ in this day do you think
[1:08:22] and I'm going tell you something you can
[1:08:24] sit here just like everybody else and
[1:08:27] not hear a thing look at all these
[1:08:30] people that left the Lord amen and and
[1:08:33] and claiming it's wrong now sat right
[1:08:35] under that heard the message heard the
[1:08:37] tapes read the books amen not only that
[1:08:40] but built churches over seas I witness
[1:08:43] and then turn their back on it why cuz
[1:08:45] they never heard
[1:08:47] it it was like a goat always ready
[1:08:51] waiting for the last
[1:08:53] kick see that's that's right that's what
[1:08:56] it is and and you know here you are amen
[1:08:59] as humble as you are let me say it like
[1:09:01] this people amen the Bride of Jesus
[1:09:03] Christ amen she cannot be
[1:09:06] moved she's omnipotent she can't be
[1:09:09] moved nothing can move her she'd rather
[1:09:11] die I was telling my children that the
[1:09:12] other day I lay my life on the line for
[1:09:18] this let me say it like this don't let
[1:09:21] ever the devil make you think he got
[1:09:23] something good for you if you believe
[1:09:25] the word the Bible say he comes to steal
[1:09:27] kill and destroy I don't care he might
[1:09:30] bait you with a million dollars but at
[1:09:32] the end of the road he's come to kill
[1:09:34] steal and destroy hello somebody you'll
[1:09:37] never have to worry about Lucifer if you
[1:09:40] don't seek your own
[1:09:43] will let me say that again put it this
[1:09:46] way you'll never have to worry about the
[1:09:48] devil he'll never have effect on you the
[1:09:52] only way he affects you is when he con
[1:09:54] can conin you to do your
[1:10:01] will right if you don't give him your
[1:10:04] will he's
[1:10:10] ineffective and if you don't give God
[1:10:12] your will he's in effect CU God ain't
[1:10:15] going to make you do
[1:10:18] nothing
[1:10:19] right listen let's move on by the grace
[1:10:22] of God he goes on and says when one
[1:10:24] omnipotent he's talking about the woman
[1:10:26] at the well when she had perfect
[1:10:28] omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ
[1:10:30] was omnipotent see had
[1:10:32] perfect infinite faith in Christ that he
[1:10:36] was the Lord and know whatever he asked
[1:10:39] God God would give it to him now let me
[1:10:42] say it like this isn't that true when
[1:10:44] you really have confidence in the word
[1:10:47] you can ask God and you really believe
[1:10:50] you're gonna get
[1:10:51] it nothing will D make you doubt nothing
[1:10:54] we how we going to finish a work if we
[1:10:56] don't have faith in the word it can't be
[1:11:00] finished without faith in the word and
[1:11:04] that word is God that's what I was
[1:11:06] trying to tell them the other day I said
[1:11:08] let me tell you something word of God

[1:11:34] right see but we got we got the word of
[1:11:37] God down here nah the word of God the
[1:11:39] Bible said Jesus Christ who is the head

[1:11:46] head not if you the bride you got it

[1:14:26] is that only God knows my heart for the
[1:14:28] people of
[1:14:30] God there's not an individual that I
[1:14:32] know that I don't love and care
[1:14:36] for sometimes
[1:14:39] I get into prayer and just heart
[1:14:44] hurts because I know people are not
[1:14:46] seeing the time we're living
[1:14:49] in I fight every day I don't know about
[1:14:51] nobody else but I fight every day
[1:14:56] after win some lose some and I'm going
[1:14:59] tell you something I don't forget to
[1:15:01] clean cleanse myself I make it
[1:15:05] right and you know I just want to say by
[1:15:08] the grace of
[1:15:09] God uh a lot of time people have no
[1:15:14] idea The Strain it puts on a
[1:15:21] man you
[1:15:23] know because he's got to be led by God
[1:15:26] he can't be led by
[1:15:28] men that he has to be led by God and
[1:15:30] sometime that cause a real
[1:15:34] conflict
[1:15:37] because because it does it always
[1:15:40] have brother said a true preacher can't
[1:15:43] be a a a real servant of the Lord if he
[1:15:48] a servant of the
[1:15:50] people he's got to be one or the
[1:15:53] other and often
[1:15:55] time that's
[1:16:01] difficult I'm only saying those things
[1:16:04] just to make you
[1:16:05] aware that even a man of God has
[1:16:08] feelings
