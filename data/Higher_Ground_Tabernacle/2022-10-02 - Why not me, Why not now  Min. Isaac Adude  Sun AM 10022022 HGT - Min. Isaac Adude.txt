to be here this morning amen we thank the Lord for his grace and his Mercy Lord amen because waking up every morning it's not just a habit amen by disgrace as the Bible says that his Mercy renews every morning amen he gives us his grace every morning [Music] so we don't have to take it for granted amen uh let's turn to uh II Peter chapter three we read the verse 9. foreign the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count I'm sorry the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men counting his uh the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but he is long-suffering to us uh to us word not willing that any should perish but also come to repentance amen I'll read it again the Lord is concerning this promise as some men count slackness but he's long-suffering to us word not willing that any Shall Perish but all shall come to repentance Louisiana Mercy Lord thank you Father God for everything that you have done for us Lord thank you for all the Miracles of Father God you did in our lives Lord thank you for your grace and your mercy in their renewed father God every morning Lord thank you for everything Lord Jesus Lord yeah we come here father God in your house Lord to serve you father put yourself Lord to praise you Lord Jesus Lord to have a fellowship with you with you lord lord to talk to you father Godly so that you can talk back to US national policy Lord to learn father God more about you foreign Lord we thank you Father for everything so we pray father God that your spirit leads everything father this morning we pray father God that you forgive all our sins Lord you forgive all our iniquities Lord make us wine wider than snow fatherless to be a whole in your Praises but we pray that you bless every heart so father God hearing this is the way father God we pray that you bless him Lord Lord let everything be done in your name in Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated with as well amen this morning I have a God's grace we have a little subject that wanted to share with you but I guess is why not me and why not now this is why not me why not now amen because what we read in the Bible will see that the Bible says that the Lord is not slacks amen concerning his promises because we know that life is nothing but a totality of conscious choices [Music] that would continuously make life is nothing but a choice what is it what do you mean by that the difference what you do everything but what you do every day is a choice amen you decide to wake up to stand out of me to wake up on your bed it's a choice I mean if you decide to say if you decide to stay sleeping all day still a choice when you eat it's a juice that you make you want to eat you want to stay hungry it's still a choice well even when you don't feel like choosing and you stay on neutral it's still a choice so everything that we do every day in our lives is a choice and so the choices that we make will determine where we'll spend our eternity and the choices that we make amen we're having will have an impact now before in our neighbor's lives so that's what we have to carefully choose what we do foreign carefully choose the choice that we make you see the Young Rich ruler amen he had a choice to make and then he had to either follow Jesus or his riches and he made his choice that was the wrong one amen here the prophet says your Eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you spend your eternity before this service Ends Tonight this morning there will be there'll be one time if you turn God down on many times there will be one time you're turning down you turn him down the last time see foreign about where you want to spend your eternity amen it's not a gift that is freely given to you but you have to choose amen you have to decide we sing that I have decided to follow Jesus amen I give my life to Christ and I have decided to follow Jesus Christ amen it's a decision that you make and that decision will determine where you'll spend your eternity wisely the prophet is not to postpone it for a long time because there is a line between judgment and mercy [Music] there is a line that is between judgment and mercy amen and and then if you step if you step across that line there is no turning back civil foreign Peter said the Lord no we gave everything away to follow you no we made our choice to follow him but now where we will go if we if it's not to you I mean no we give up everything what are we having back in return he says I will give you a hundred foot of everything that you have lost but on top of that you also have tribulations they had to make their choices they had to decide whether to follow the the rest who left Jesus or to stay with him amen they decided to stay with him and you see that Jacob also had to make a choice when he heard that his brother was coming back was coming to him with 400 men to kill him you had to make a wise choice amen but he went to the Lord amen he went to the Lord and prayed amen that was his wife's choice that he made to decide because right there and right then his life was changed and his family was safe so the prophet said that there may be men and women sitting here tonight that death lays right before you he Dona more and the only way that you'll be you'll ever be able to achieve that thing today uh the thing that you wanting is to desperately come is to desperate to desperately come he said that I might I must have it I get it now I'm oh I'm finished tomorrow is too late I must have it now when you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit the token senior don't say well now I'll go up and try it Lord I'm a little tired oh mercy oh misery stay in your seat don't even make an attempt if you come and say well I'll pass I'll pass through the prayer line put the oil in my head and I'll see if that does me any good message you might as well said where you where you at until you get to that place until the whole church gets to that place to a place that it's between death and life you've got to heaven now perish amen that God will move on the scene amen because it takes desperation to bring God on the scene if foreign amen you have to be like Esther the vet come is there amen if I perish let me perish amen because I'm going to see the king amen if I perish let me perish amen because I have made my decision amen My Mind Is Made Up more money amen I have to get I have to see the king amen I'm going to see the king amen because I have to save my people amen so it's about life and death so when you come to that position when you come to that desperate time but that's when God comes to the scene amen that's when God acts amen that's when God did comes down she also wanted to do this amen when you're desperate amen when you don't have any other options amen when you totally depend on God Amen that's when he comes down to help you see like this song foreign so now we have decided to follow him and then and you see that he was rewarded afterwards because there is a reward after a decision there is a reward after every decision that we make decision amen but it's not always a good reward if you choose not to serve God Amen your reward is to go to hell remember if you choose to serve him amen your reward is to spend the eternity with him that New Jerusalem himself that's only if you decide to choose him she said he said rest Ruth because the men will have no rest you know foreign [Music] [Music] foreign home because if you don't amen that same Grace will become the judgments amen when first when God came it was first coming those could Drew if it was a Grace for the people who received him but to those who rejected him amen that same Grace became the Judgment for them don't let it be the case for you this morning even you have to make your decisions why not me why not now amen today is my day today is my time amen today is the day that I decide to shoot to follow Christ amen today is the day that I need a change Lord I need a change your people will be my people your God will be my God tired of say of of of of of of worshiping Idols I'm tired of worshiping false gods now I have made my decisions I've seen how God what God did in your life even though you lost your entire family amen by you still praising God Amen you still praising God Amen you still singing for him amen you still love him so I wanna say I want to serve that same God I want to have that same experience so wherever you go that's where I go wherever you stay that's where I'll stay your people will be my people don't purp it's not an easy decision it's not an easy decision that you're making decision amen you will have trouble different before you open some of you peoples I have professed to be Christians how do you treat him amen at work you tell everybody that you are Christian but how do you treat him even in school you tell everybody that you're a Christian but how do you treat him man how do you treat him oh my oh once in a while you permit certain programs to come along a little dried up evangelist of some sort and you put on your most Charming dress and you're beautiful and you go down to the church we still watch dirty things that we're not supposed to watch [Music] the Bible talks about those women who came to one man and said that we just want to have your name is amen you don't care about our personal life amen we just have one I have that name amen we just want to be called Christians amen we just want to be represented as Christians but we have to make a decision amen we have to take it as our Lord and our savior amen he wants to be your lord Amen to give him your entire life how do we treat him how do we treat God Amen we come to we come lay in a service amen we come later church and now it's becoming a habit always showing up late to church if the president called the conference none of us will be late we'll make sure to get to that conference 30 minutes early we'll make sure to get the best seed in the room look at the president amen but but we're making that happen by coming to church now late is becoming a habits and we keep in giving excuses the holy spirit will never let you have the habit of coming late to church bother you about it is let you have the habit of coming late to church and not bother you about it amen if you're fine with it it's time for you to start questioning your Holy Spirit if there is nothing that condemns you to come late to church even we decide when to come to church and why not to show up to church this is not confident like this is well today is my favorite preacher is preaching today that's when I will show up okay well these are the men is preaching so I'm not coming well it's the same holy spirit that is leading the church amen God will always have something yeah you think you expect him to receive Millions so why can't you do the same thing for God why can't you do the same thing for the Lord okay he gives you mercies every day he gives you a job and he's blessing but what are we doing in return am I taking those same blessings amen and stay at home amen we say oh brother Isaac at work that's why that's why it's hard for me to come early in the book to come to come on time to be on time for church well like I said God will never bless you to be against his word amen you either have to ask God to find a way out to make you come early to church or to quit that job I don't want to come I don't want to come early because I'll be the first one at the church because I'll be the first one and the only one at the church everybody everybody comes late so why do I need to come early well one thing for sure you'll never be the first one amen because Jesus is always the first person so if you want to come you say well I'll be the second one because I have my my time with Jesus the prophet says that a Christian filled with the holy spirit amen not wait until the doors of the Churchill are open but he will have them it will have that urgency Amen to go talk to God to go meet to meet God to go have that that fellowship with him amen I'd rather spend my eternity in the house of the Lord I'd rather spend one day in the house of the Lord Ten Thousand Years outside of his house or outside of his will amen but we're making it a habits Amen to come late to church amen the church is supposed to start at 9 30. don't show up there until 10. amen we don't show up now until the song service has already started sometimes we show up when this when the preacher is always preached he's already preaching and we wonder why we don't have the blessings and we wonder why our prayers are not heard and we wonder why things are not going as they were supposed to in positions amen we disturb the holy spirit amen we disturb God Amen you disturb your neighbor who was focused on what he was hearing amen God was probably talking to your neighbor when you come late you're disturbing him and it's not a good thing to disturb the holy spirit amen it's not a good thing to disturbate amen God Is Watching You Jules Observer God is listening to you amen I'll read the prophet the message in his presence is paragraph foreign shall Rest In Hope security before you promised it yes sir he knew that he will raise up because God had promised him amen put the lord always before your face and always know that God is watching you is because the Bible says that everything that you every every this you make decision amen every action that you take amen you have to do it always the name of the Lord Jesus if the thing that you're doing can be done in the name of the Lord Jesus that means that you can't do it man that means it's a time to stop it's that decision you can't take in the name of the Lord Jesus that means that God will not be pleased with it if the thing that you want to say you can't say in the name of the Lord Jesus all the things that you want to watch you can't watch in the name of the Lord Jesus amen because if you can't do in the name of the Lord Jesus how you crowd him out come on uh parties your little pity parties and all your little things your little entertainment why you Pharisees that will do Jesus my Lord that way when it comes to town you speak evil of him you would turn him down now open your eyes he comes to visit you you've called for him in your prayer meeting but when he comes then you don't want to give you you don't want to give him any room how blind people can be amen you pray amen you call him say Lord come and be with us Lord come and be among us amen God hears our prayers and God answers to our prayers amen God will show up amen but before he acts amen he will see how you treat him and Simon invited God to his house amen Simon invited Jesus to his house amen Jesus showed up amen he even knew he knew how he was going to be treated amen now enough to for him to act amen he was depending on how he was treated amen because God will always show up amen he gave his promise call on me and I will be there [Music] [Music] to know the opportunity of standing in the presence of Jesus foreign foreign well I can't wait to be to go home well the preacher is taking too long well well brother Isaac today you were on time and you preached for two hours well the song service lasted for an hour 30 minutes but why amen people today amen the rather do other things but to serve God Amen the rather listen to anything but God's words they talk about anything else by the word of God Amen all of that shows that we are at the end of time because that's what the Bible says amen that people will go listen to what they feel they what they think what what pleases their their ears getting myself away from the truth amen it's a time of decision we have to make a decision amen we have to decide who do we want to serve do we want to serve Jesus or do we want to serve someone else amen you can't have two monsters at the same time you can't have two masters at the same time you have to decide who do you want to serve Jesus or A man or someone else amen because we know that nowadays we know people are worship where I mean worship brother Brian amen people worshiping Brothers amen people making uh uh uh uh uh make making things and and and saying things that that discredit uh Jesus Christ amen they come to a point where they have to choose where the brother Brandon what Jesus Christ that's a shame on them amen that is really a shame amen you see people on Facebook and on social media decision Jesus alone or brother bran I'm alone amen why do we have to say those things why do we have why is it why do we have to do those things Amen brother Branham didn't die for you Amen brother Abraham didn't shed his blood foreign God gave him the word amen the prophet said that you just see if he's still the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity amen now he was talking to someone he said that I never seen you in my life you're a stranger to me I know nothing about you God does God does know you and if we can reveal to me but his holy spirit the resurrected Christ who come here and give me a temporarily Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away now and his Spirit comes in Pokemon is then to let you know that he is alive or not now I don't know that is me and me and my spirit more we don't know you but he knows you and he wants to borrow my body it is [Music] the resurrected Christ I'm so happy to loan it to him give it to him anything he can get out of it and he wanted to borrow his body Amen to prove that he's the resurrected Christ am I the same way God borrows your body Amen to prove that he's the same God they meant to prove that he's the same resurrected Christ amen but you're not going to ask me to worship you're not gonna ask me to praise you amen I've heard someone says I don't want to throw shade or anything amen I heard someone say that your preacher say why are we making these debates on things that doesn't matter things that doesn't save us when you see people spending their times and and decide debating who's right and who's wrong Amen on things that doesn't save you man it's just a waste of time it's just a waste of time amen God gives us the time amen and we wanna you will have to use a careful not to go into vain debates that doesn't help us spell it on the debate amen after proving that this one is right and this one is wrong so what do you gain amen I don't know why I got into this one I mean amen I'll read the prophet and we'll probably close after this one he said that if God was so merciful to forgive a man of his sins the situation is and to give him eternal life he ought to be so reverent before God all the days of his life that he will never turn his feet from God's testimonies you should always walk upright before God but it's just that way they do it that way if the phone comes to land it behooves us all new he behooves us all while we're not in trouble you know in the morning I'm pretty sure you know demand I don't know in the montus while we're not in trouble it isn't good to wait till until we get in trouble and then see God it's best to find him now for it is written that he is a very present help in time of trouble don't wait until things don't go well then you have to make a decision but it is best to serve him now remain in his best to look for him now he may look for him when he can still be found because there is a time for everything there's a time for grace and there is a time for judgment amen and you have to decide amen it's not because your brother or your neighbor has mercy God gave him a mercy uh merciful to him today that God will be merciful to you also today every one of us have our own timeline with God Amen we all don't cross that line at the same time even some of us have already crossed it may some of us are still at the borderline amen and some of us are still way away from me we're too far from it yeah remember you have to make your decision right now amen is you don't if you don't have to look at your your right and left and see but that people are watching me so I'm ashamed to make my decision or to make my stand um it's a decision between you and your savior same decision amen you have to decide and say Lord I want you to be my savior and my lord lord I want you to take us My Savior and my Lord [Music] amen I want you to take control of my entire life don't only be my savior but I also want you to be my Lord amen amen amen in closing out with this this quote and then I'll finish afterwards say that do not try to be popular with the world and right with God on Monday America because you can't be you must be right with God and then you're not popular with the world in this day we have in this day that we're living seek God with all your heart okay call upon and call upon him while he's still while it's time to call while you have a chance and what the mercy of God is reached down to you for the hour is coming when it'll do no good to call where it'll be too late if you have lived in the Days Gone By by in the days in the days gone by when the cruise when they crucified Jesus you'd say well I would have stood for him I'd have give my life for him and when you have more of an opportunity to do that now then you would have in them days the opposition is greater today than it was then the position stand now foreign [Music] with him if you want to go to the military amen if you want to be in that New Jerusalem to choose amen the things that we do and that we think is pleasing right now [Music] amen there will be a day that will regreture of not choosing God there will be a day that will regret of postponing that choice amen of not making that decision amen of being a so-called Christian amen that today but when I'm with the wrong crowd that become like them oh hello I'd rather use 10 take a stand they have no time until they cry until Christ comes back until the groom comes back that night it meant the night that they forget to check their lamps and when you have to check your life every day I mean it has to be a everyday thing it meant a little checkup with [Music] are you still excited about it it's the Holy Spirit and foreign amen I can teach you about all those great Mysteries I mean it's good to have the knowledge but you will know that when Paul was talking to the churches he didn't tell them only to have the knowledge but he told them to pray for the wisdom and and the revelation of the knowledge of the of the world Amen to pray for the wisdom and the revelation of that knowledge [Music] amen but it was a revolution knowledge received by the Revelation when you say well Brothers they come good now God is blessing me well praise the Lord Roger what about your spiritual life amen how much how much time do you spend amen when was the last time that you spent an hour praying contests amen when was the last time that you spent an hour reading your Bible contest when was your last Bible study amen when was the last time that you listened to the entire tape with without any interruptions contests when was the last time that you felt that God the presence of God near me when was the last time that God directly gave you a message amen when was the last them that you had an experience with God contest groups these are questions that we have to ask ourselves daily amen and if it's been a long time since you've experienced all these things that means that it's time to get you on your knees and start praying that means that it's a time to open your Bible and start reading that means it's a time to put a tape and start listening to it doesn't fix the moment don't do amen you start and let God do the rest amen when was the last time how long has it been since you pray to the Lord how long has it been since you nailed on your knees and pray to the Lord amen don't just wait until you're in trouble and then that's when they will find you coming to church rich and crying at the altar not only person amen there is always tears of joy that you can still cry amen when things are going well you can still cry because there are tears of joy when was the last time amen if you
