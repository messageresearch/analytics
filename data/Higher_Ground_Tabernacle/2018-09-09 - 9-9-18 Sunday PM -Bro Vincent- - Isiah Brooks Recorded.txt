TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ting Matthew 16:13 just want to conclude the message I started in the morning I read a we're all allowed when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets and Simon Peter answered I think I jump he said unto them verse 15 by whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said they are the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed about Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say on so on to thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it hallelujah let's read on a big the last verse 19 and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word may you bless it for us this evening in Jesus name II may God bless you all let's be seated so in the morning we are talking about birth paintings and I just want to say that us with us we said in the morning that it requires some traveling even our ability to come to church requires some traveling I mean I just preach I just talk about traveling in the morning and everybody goes back home and they are not here and I bet you some genuinely probably have to go to work in an afternoon but there are many who are just at home they are doing nothing they probably play with technology that's all they are doing at this hour that aware of God is be shaped if you could trace back and see some time do it do it is that back home there it is that maybe you have to go for a programmer in yonggu and by the time especially when I was in school when I was doing my BS on when days I have examined their exchange I know Melissa I'm crest so let me stay and study but I look at my watch and I look at what I'm able to read or sometimes the people who go to church go and come back and I'm living that's my books at all I've already anything so sometimes worshiping God is like that and that's why I was talking about the best thing that we are talking about the traveling that we are talking about it's includes everything how are you able to distance yourself from this world are you able to completely separate yourself all your focus it's about God and go alone go into him I'm not saying she becomes a fanatic who were had in my country there was a group that believed this messaging was a time they said that the world was so corrupt that didn't want to bring over your world anymore and he went and they were living in the bush and it brought such a bad reputation upon people who knew some of us to be believers and follow us on this message and when I stayed in a bush so the journalist went there to interview them how are you living how can you separate yourself run over hahaha you live it and they said well they grow mushrooms so when you grow mushrooms or do we say we sell it sell it to the world the very people I are right now we from I mean that's not a kind of thing that we preach you hear that is fanaticism and people who don't apply common sense we are talking about hallelujah because people said I have written to you in an epistle not to keep company with fornicators but not all to get out of fornicators of this world for then must ye go out of the world those that you have in this world and a fornicator and lies and sinners so if you say that you are not going to have anything to do those people in this world the end you must go out of the world but Paul said he is talking about those who call themselves brothers those who call themselves sisters and just leave that kind of life that the worldly people are living if you find them out chandi a company that's what Paul is talking about is alright so the people of this world we have to live with them so there's an attitude that's all we are talking about amen we are talking about your ability to separate yourself from worldly things and concentrate as much as it depends on you all that you need to do is concentrate on this way that is the kind of Christians that Jesus wants to produce because I was telling you in the morning that common salvation is completely different from the endtime Redemption because in this endtime Redemption we know that what Adam lost hallelujah from the beginning what he lost that book that the title deed or broblem called abstract that he lost from the beginning hallelujah the original owner who is God now has it hallelujah he now has it and he's intention okay let me just read at you so that I don't want to keep you long this afternoon if I want to preach will be so long but I just want to say like a few things there we go so in a message I think the the breach this our Abraham put it I'm grease is not yielding anything okay let me just let me be preaching on us as we look for it and I not see the mistake I was doing okay right I think paragraph two for three [Music] from two Volvos so now he has the title deed to redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done now it has it in his hand remember it's being in the hand of God all the time but now it is in the hand of the lamp now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's come to claim it back now this is what I want you to watch to for the human right not to claim it back to angels by claiming back to the human which it was giving for to make sons and daughters of God again bring them back to Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation that trees the animal life everything else oh my there's no time for me to expand on this but I want you to remember that what God is doing in this end time is to bring we that lost our estate we done lost our status what God created us for going he created us in the beginning he said we should have dominion over this earth and we should serve do it but this F is now on truly human beings do we have the video I mean people people are living according to this I mean the standards of this world but when we were created originally we were supposed to have dominion over this world amen this world is not supposed to have dominion over us who were supposed to have dominion over this world in the program is telling us that God wants to send us back to that original state again he said bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation that tree stand in my life everything else oh my god amen so that is what I was trying to tell you that just ordinary believe in Jesus Christ confessing it with your mouth as it is in Romans 10 in Romans 10 he says he says that if you believe in your heart in the Lord Jesus Christ and confess him with your mouth you are saved and that is true cuz that's what you need to be saved but for you to be part of the rapture it's not the same thing for you to be part of the Millenium it's not the same thing do you get it so you could be saved but not be in the rapture you could be saved and how you have to go to tribulation hallelujah and you know this best pain that we are talking about if you're a child of God you can't skip it you know why can I skip it even no matter how you play the fool if I can use that language no matter how you just ignore what you are supposed to do as a believer you know there's a prophecy that there is going to be a squeeze in this end time for the bride the bride is going to be squeezed out all the churches are coming together in an economic miracle move amen and when they come together if you are not part of them you can't preach become well so we cannot meet here anymore and if you leave you don't belong to the organization you come by ourselves there will be such a press and that must happen and problem said in the message desperation he said it's unfortunate that it has to take that because we know the truth why must we wait till we have squeezed before even our whole life we know the truth that we must pray we must call on God we must live for God now we don't do it I want trouble strikes yeah we remember we have to fast that we remember we have to wake up early in the morning to pray then we remember we have to pray before we go to bed Prairie demos lazy person amana's if trouble should strike now if you had a problem with the federal authorities and you were facing some court proceedings and you are likely to go to jail I'm sure you stay awake every night to pray that's a fact so why do we wait - we are pressed before we remember God when we can remember God you see in ecclesiastics the Bible say in Ecclesiastes let's really Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1 Old Testament Ecclesiastes after us I think for songs between Proverbs and songs of Solomon chapter 12 verse 1 I read a word I said remember now this Old Testament it's a remember now that creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not know the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them while the Sun or the light of the moon or the Stars be not Daqing not that Klaus retained after the rain oh I like that he said you see so when you are when you think life is good for you when you think you are having fun what do you think everything is going on well you are financially sound where your marriage is working well it says that is the time that is what remember your God so remember your God in the days of your youth when you are young and vibrant that's why you should remember your God hallelujah otherwise it says that they said time tell me where the Sun or the light or the moon or the Stars will become dark that means it's a time of what trouble it's a time of trial so every human being one in one way or the other was one way or the other you go through some kind of trap don't wait to that Ray account before you start calling on the Lord it could be sickness we are financial crisis it could be some terrible divorce it could be something so you shouldn't wait so the right time necklace justice is saying that when things are good remember your God don't wait till the evil days come I like the way push and like the last cent they said know that clouds return after the rain I like that you see you we here we are used to you are used to winter winter stones you are you used to bass know whether you know it's not a good thing when it snows heavily and everybody is expecting the weather to clear and all you hear the weatherman say is that most noise on the way even here in storms is like that isn't it that it has really heavily look at the flag that we had recently can you imagine if the following deal they Teddy the fog did the weatherman had who Lazar Maureen was coming this place was going to be flooded them or in life is like that there are times that one problem you think that you are getting out of one problem before you realize more problems and they come in changed as we say the problems when you are coming the coming change so that's how life can be so it is when life seems to be good that's what you have to remember your Creator and when the evil discount you stand for you I get what I'm saying all right so brethren I started by talking about this travailing pains amen now let me go to my revelation so that they what I want to bring out of this message so let's go back and read birth pains the 14 before they're 40 Ted ves again I read it partially in the morning less no no birth pain this descriptions fulfill let's read our as we read in the morning forty-three right oh my reading a wrong one yeah I think I think I'm reading a wrong one yes I want you have it I want to read a one from Arizona in Phoenix yes I couldn't my iPad is not allowing me to piss my stuff into words so it's made me not to be able to arrange money okay so that they shot the shot evasion bra bra was in paragraph 43 you have that one okay yeah that's the one I'm looking for yes correct he said I think of today and notice that that was the priest gave the word over the Catholic priest as we said anyone gave him the word and the last petition on my text this is what I want to bring out he said the last petition of off out of my text that I had and my Scriptures rule down was st. Luke 1780 where Jesus referring back to this day that we are living in rich loggia age and yet rotten in politics church polity is national politics that has rotting and then he said as it was in the days of law so shall it be in the coming in a in the coming end time notice what he said there in the day that the Son of Man will be revealed see in there in the days that the Son of Man will be revealed I want to draw your attention he put out in the a hangi day now what I want to say is that if parabrahma is preaching about death he read John 16 21 and 22 and in John 16 21 and 22 is talking about child death amen but we know that we are not talking about literature-based amana's we are talking about a new birth what we call in Christianity the born-again experience hallelujah so bra bra was trying to let the people know that the scripture that Jesus Christ read and that time you know I was talking about the manifesto of Jesus Christ or the manifesto of Malachi 4 5 and 6 so the scripture that Jesus Christ read at that time was the public Proclamation about his mission when he first came hallelujah and broblem is saying that I have told you already that the public proclamation of word rubra ham was here for also happen on that day when the priests handed him over the weight when he was talking about this hallelujah so Luke 17 is talking about the revelation of the Son of Man so what I'm trying to let you catch is that for you to have that death that Bev starts by your personal revelation of the Son of man in this endtime not a historical Jesus Christ are you are you are you following what I said your personal revelation so the son of man ministry that Christ's ministry is repeated again in this end time that was what is that is what is contained in looks at meeting dating so your personal revelation of the son of my ministry that is contained in this endtime it Han gives you that noobest I don't know I I don't know how to put it but as I said there are things that I want to say but maybe one day I'll say when I go back together and I come here come and see them not now but I hope you are following now let me prove what I'm trying to say in first John let's have faith John 5 verse 1 that the Epistle of John not a gospel first John yes first John chapter 5 verse 1 as I say I don't appreciate the gave I appreciate moon alleviate so let me just read and point out a key the key things that I want you to see now listen to this in the first coming how did the people expect you to be born of God howdy John how did the disciples how to be the understanding of the bed he said whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God it makes so Beth comment by what believing who is the Christ I know I know I know it's confusing me but God proved over it and you understand what I'm saying that whosoever ability says Christ he says is that Christ he's born of God and every one that loveth him that we got it that God loved him also that is begotten of him hallelujah so this was the principle of the Beth back game where you have to believe that Jesus is the Christ and Barbra is talking about Beth and he's telling you that the last Christian he wanted to read you go and study that message again you get what I'm trying to tell you the last which I wanted to read that day before the thing was about the revelation of the son of man that is why I went back for this evenin message we went back and read about Peter in Matthew 16:13 when Jesus Christ was asking the disciples who do men say that I I am I the son of man oh yeah I the son of my who do men say I am then they mention some see you guys desire something you add your mass something really a something you a dish you are one of the prophets but then he asks a question see who do ye so rather your personal revelation is important you see when you have that personal revelation there is nothing under the Sun that can take you back that's what I was saying this morning about a seed that has rotten and grow for life he doesn't go back to becoming rotten seed again he just grows and grows and grows daily best fruits so that the beginning is that revelation of the Son of Man is that revelation of Christ and growing in your hearts so that there is nothing 9 everybody can come and tell you convince you about that can't shift you away from the message is someone is somebody who has revelation in your heart you think that that person can be tossed about by every wind of doctrine in this message all around the world people are tossed about by every wind of doctrine because the revelation they have is no uncon anything but when your revelation is anchored look the disciples understand many things because the whole egos are know yet calm but when everybody dizzy a Jesus Christ Jesus came to them and say we also go they say where can we go you have the words of life and that is the state we must get to before Pentecost where we tell laugh right because you can't know this truth and still going to be Romanian denomination now if people who say they they were once in this message they they really have any revelation to begin with because if you are truly real if you truly have revelation in your heart there is no way you can go and be I mean doing the kind of things that worldly people are doing that's what I'm trying to say it meant the last time I was Christian I was talking to you about Jesus Christ that there was no way Jesus Christ could have committed sin the reason is that he didn't skip his toe funny you remember I was telling you that I was telling you that we skip out you funny to come here to be tempted so we don't recall we don't remember even though we were part of God from the beginning we were part of God from the beginning but we can't recollect it we've lost that memory and it happened so that we could be tempted but Jesus Christ never lost that memory so that is why he prays and said father been glorified me the glory that I had with you from the beginning that's that I mean if we go to John in many of the prayers he prayed in John 17 you can you can read it it meant the reason why he was doing that because he knows his glory he knows that these worldly things it's like I mean you a human being you go to join some animal kingdom some way you live among some animals Brabham that's why broblem always gave this example of an eagle being hatched in a hen coop you know it's true out in a messages because he knew all along that he was an eagle he watched the chicken eating the dirt and grooms and he knows that that is not supposed to be his food I don't know your personal experience but me growing up there were things that I saw that I knew that I couldn't be part of that I remember the first time I went to a school and I saw that the whole school was invaded by prostitutes and when I saw it and some of my mates I was so I nearly formative it looks so nasty to me I couldn't be part of it is it because even though I was not believing this message that time I still something in me told me that I'm not supposed to be part of that one of my best friends in life he has died unfortunately away I did everything for him for him to me change his ways but he never listened I remember when we were just in seventh grade he and a rough friend of mine who is now a neurosurgeon who went to move an orchard then when we went to the author at the time I didn't know that they were smoking so one of the friends the one who is a neurosurgeon he brought out a stick of cigarette give it to my other friend who has died and gave me one and I rejected it I think I know I don't smoke I don't believe in that so they smoked and we left why is it that it was not so easy for me to just join that trend of I mean what I call bad boys in are you following what I'm saying yeah so if you are a child of God amen and you hear this shoot something inside you will be calling out to hear more of it but if it is not that way and there's something wrong you need that's when you need to wane cry to God I loved something wrong why is that when I hear these things it doesn't make me happy I remember when I first attested in this message and I to the church again always really somehow catch a revelation and I was scream from my bed as if I was getting mad I'm talking to you about my personal experience the way it happened to me the first day my friend who he lives in Calgary Canada now he came to me I was living in a northern part of Ghana he came to me with this message and was telling me that baptism has been the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said what had been baptized in the titles of father son holy goose and I was wondering so yet but he said your father is the name of the Father Jesus Christ anymore the son is Jesus Christ and so when he says go and do it in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost it means do it in the name of Jesus Christ Godfather is a title but Jesus is the name he was explaining this I remember that night I didn't sleep I took the Bible I said I said she'd I tried to ask you questions then the following day because I was so happy about what I had I took him to my friends that who were also Christians with me web practical stacked Christians by their I took him to my friends all my friends told me now oh this guy who listen to you confuse you but he didn't confuse me for me he was sounding very well but today I mean he was confusing them we see the difference it has a so you can be a child of God and you are living a wrong life it doesn't matter how I'm not saying that if you're a child of God you cannot fall and live you can only work and live a long life you can do prostitutes you can do anything like ours I mean I don't say that if you run away from me like I did you could have done like rabboni to alcoholism you can go into drugs anything it doesn't matter but the truth about it is that when you first start hearing about a true true Word of God something you tell you let you know that that is the truth so when this front of my family took him to his church in Kumasi and I had a pastor preach it was a hard message I told him that wrath upon this message is hard but I think another I think this message is hard but I would believe it this is the truth I've been looking for because any time I went to this Pentecostal churches there was so much emphasis on money and I took something me told me that Gold cannot be begging the people for money this week I mean you can't go to church and all that they talk about is money money money and I always ask myself how could God be begging the people for money come and give this a month for special blessing so I never liked the changes I thought Amy but I didn't know anything about this message at the time something probably in me knew that if there was counterfeit currency there has to be genuine dollar some way and one day I come across a genuine lobule and I came across a hundred dollar bill and I packed my pockets with it Oh hallelujah so let's go back to what we read in a Matthew 16 so in Matthew system when people give the answer that you are the Christ so who do men say that I am a pataga dance I said you are the Christ Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you damn it I was born do you see why I think I preach a message here some time ago I remember when I was here Gannon why Peter do you see why Peter was given the keys to the kingdom because he was born there so even though he later on would deny Jesus Christ instantly he repented when the crowed for attack the third time Jesus look at him started he went sour to weep and cry he knew he had done wrong that is why when Jesus was well said Peter three times epitaph feed my sheep you remember that that is why it was Peter I had the keys of the kingdom he opened the kingdom to Jews to Gentiles in remember in Cornelius house we read that some time ago here and later two Samaritans when Philip had gone with a revival and the people believed Philip baptized them but they were not yet they had not yet received the Holy Ghost so Jonah Peter and John had to go there pray for them lay their hands on them and then they received the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost so Peter because he was the first to be born among them Peter's revelation even though Peter called the revelation that did not deliver Judas he was dead that day when Peter said if they were all there Judas was there when Peter said you are the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you by my father who is in heaven is it in on this revelation of who the Son of God is I'll do my church if you like I said I said on this revelation or who the son of God is I'll do my church so that's why once I first John 5 verse 1 see is that if you believe that Jesus is the Christ you are born of God so it's a revelation based on a revelation that the preacher puts into you so I'm saying that when barabra ham came in a beginning in this end time he came in three ministries where he died that ministry remember that ministry of elijah and that ministry of moses ended with him by remember that there are three things that i in the rapture the shout the voice and the trumpet and they said the lord himself was going to do it but the ministry of christ continued because in when the mighty angel came down in 1963 and a mighty angel is still on earth he hasn't gone hallelujah that's all I can say for now hallelujah so I are you getting what I'm saying that the minister of Christ will Abra ham is continuing and it is that ministry is going to culminate in the rapture it's going to combinate in the trumpet before rapture that is a bright ministry now of Christ and it's going to be more powerful than the bright ministry in the apostle's Rob Ron said what you have seen in me is am I know it's a hot we saw in that post those it's a minor compared to all to be done in the bride in this end time and he himself said about his own ministry said what you have seen temporarily in me will be made manifest in the fullness of power in the bride look our way to Jesus is there is written in it he said those five straight things that you saw in me so when the squeeze comes down say if they are laying dormant till the squeeze comes down the bride is going to manifest that are you are you catching it hallelujah so brethren and oh uh view of the Anubis amen is fast revelation if you don't have that revelation about what God has done in this end time amen you can't catch it and that's why one of the most stable group of people in Christianity is intimacy believe it's here we are thus a small change and we don't have so many in time checks but if you go to the big cities like my wife's place in Toronto they have so many churches around and the same group of believers keep moving among the churches today they are not happy with this pasta they move to another place tomorrow they are not happy here we move to another place they keep roaming and Rumi then it's like music access to some of them fallout roomy roomy fallout room I mean you all know what happened in club Adele some of you know what happening club are there some years ago and club Adele's like one of the pillars of this message and I mean that the broadband is only there I think so I mean he's on YouTube probably agree hey let a lot of people are we and some of they have completely left a message now so that asked then you asked a question what revelation did they have to begin with they didn't you know just following because somebody told them come and they started using their gifts in a church but if you are like that you can't I mean the little wing because everything in this end time God is about to shake everything and look I'm telling you the churches that I preached in Ghana I'm always I'm on there too I mean he knows I'm on the phone always with the ministers and some of the brothers there's a great shaking we know they said great shaking going on and everything will be shaking if we hear where you are here one day to be shaky I remember I read a message one time Robert I'm going to preach somewhere he said it was a home ministry like a church in the house and when he preached somewhere in Arizona when he finished when he finished picture he said he has never been to a place that is so welcoming so good an environment to preaching like here then he said my brethren don't think the devil is going to allow you to continue on that way forever you should know that he will fly in one of these days very swiftly and when he flies him and you see brothers trying to I mean create confusion you should notice the devil it's not a brother should know how to go about it so everything God is good a lively thing to be shaking the reason is that they see when Israel came out of Egypt when people who believe this message came out of denomination it was a mixed multitude the Bible says the Bible says in in Joshua that a mixed multitude came out of Egypt but before they could cross Jordan to the it will in time to the promised land amen the God had to allow them to wander about in a wilderness for long for all the Egyptians that came out of them and for all the unbelievers among them to be trim off the same thing happened in this message a mixed multitude came out because you see what happened in bronze see was that he used God used the healing I mean the healing virtue that he gave him as a beach so the healing virtue baited a lot of people to come but as soon as I started dishing out the word as soon as I started dissing out the real manna for this end time just like they did to Jesus Christ they say this man now see when when he is praying for the sick God is using him as he's not born a teacher he wants to in time their ministry way how can God give you a prophet who is not a teacher when the Word of God comes to a prophet the Word of God doesn't become to a teacher on evangelise or and I lose any of those people what of God actually comes to a prophet is true a prophet and a teacher I thought but because they didn't have revelation they told that this was just one of us that God was using just like this oh Jesus Christ oh come oh ha can you see that he's the son of God she says by your very scripture says that you are ghost those are the Word of God came to do a ghost so why are you saying that I'm guilty of calling myself a son of God but the Korean ascends yourself son he was born we also his childhood he was helping his father his father's car Petrie job then suddenly he's saying that before Abraham was I am so that is why bribe ramp them finally had to preach indictment so I indicted generation today they crucify him who their messages powerful the religious leaders crucified him very shameful day so you have to preach that strong message because the people they have seen the move of go for the ID but they applying it to each brother that is a danger seeing the move of God for your D and being blinded to eat nothing is as terrible as that and I'm saying that God's move is still own it is up to you to pray to open your eyes to see God to open your eyes to see what he's doing amen so a personal revelation of the Son of Man I'm just trying to our wind up very soon so a personal revelation of the Son of Man is necessary for that birth to take place and I said that Beth is a painful process I have to bear a pain of separation you know when a child is being borne by the mother it's a separation time that child in a woman the mother doesn't want to come up because comfortable day for him and he's being told he has to come out to a world where people are driving cars but she has me warned that if you come out to a world where people are driving cars you have to be careful I've been knocked down by one other class and you'd I said then why do I have to go there let me rather remain in a woman of my mom yeah he's heard that there are trees here there are best flying there's an aeroplane but he has also heard that they're opening some tank crashes and everybody dies he said no that place is scary here I'm safe nothing I'm happy here my food is guaranteed everything is guaranteed I'm alone here no competition that's how I was to that maybe when you grow up you have to apply for a job and many people who come and compete with you I mean you have to go to an interview may not be picked for that job you can be jobless for some time and when you are jobless you have to go to a government Food Bank that's not a good place to be a child is scared but a time comes when a mother has to separate it I don't know when I watch any of this wall animals been weaned before it was a painful process the day that the Warhawk you know was a lot of a bush peak I don't know what eyes he has some something on the new streets like yeah a wild boar okay yeah those the the bush piece they did that they think that the young ones are old enough so they have to go friend for themselves I've watched an incident like that before it's so pathetic so the young ones go out fede fede Dame and ninety we tend to the mother's name I don't know how to call it a hole where the man appearance if and they are no welcome no matter does we treat us are treating us up you see the young ones do not have to go into the wild and fend for themself and there are all manner there hyenas lions leopard things that eat them up any other experience it meant so it's a painful process of separation even when animals are separating from the appearance is painful let alone human beings painful that's why PETA asked we have separated ourselves from mother our mothers we have separated us from our fathers from our brothers if you from our wives just to follow you home how are we going to get you remember last creature in Martin's away Matthew Matthew 19:27 also she says said whoever has left father mother brother sister to follow me in this world you are going to get all those things that you are separated from so that's why this becomes our family that's why there has to be the strong bond among us unfortunately we are also married to technology and to ourselves that our bond doesn't exist I don't think I know any of your homes as believers that's what we are supposed to be we know each other's homes visit each other love each other's time stand there for each other so Abraham used to all those people he said away his good friend he they go on hunting trips together they do so many things together but today's you come to church immediately before even apostasy amen you are walking out you're on your way and sometimes a lot of it is pretense we create an impression that we are the most busy people and we have to run out from work but if I should follow you to your home we are only running to win just lie on your bed there's nothing for a lot of people that is what happens now we are supposed to be so close so Peter has a question what are we going to get so you get all these things a hundredfold in this life and the world to come you are going to get eternal life Reverend so it's not like God wants you to abandon your way of life just for nothing after you have abandoned your way of life your rotting corrupted way of life and you come into Christ it's going to give you what you think you a finding pleasure is going to give you better things you'll find pleasure in Christ there in the world to come you give you ten alive amen it's difficult separating yourself from cigarettes so addictive separating yourself from drugs you know there's a drag appearing in this country I see so many people that are hook on to drugs and it's so pathetic separating yourself from these things email is painful but that is the pin you must bear if you want to be alive in Christ for some people is not any better but they're just part of societies and organizations that have done have just come to them and they have to separate yourself from these organizations if they want to be free in Christ and if that one is a painful process maybe you are you're a chairman of that society I mean that religious group that you are you are in a lodge or something nothing likes ya behind my you know this people they just meet and drink and smoke and do so many nasty thing exchange of wives and all these nasty things some of these some of these companionships that's what they do even in by Brahms day it was there in the messages was there where people go to this drunken parties and Trudy I kiss into a hat and every man goes every woman goes to pick a key when you pick a key that's a man arguing with and these are married women so you belong to things like that you have to separate yourself and it's a painful process painful process ready to conclude you remember the story of the rich man that came to Jesus and said good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life jesus answered and said oh you have heard about what is written in the law do these do deaths thou shalt not steal thou shalt not I mean that's know having your now go beside the Lord your God he said all those things I've done from my youth so then he expected Jesus to tell him that oh then you are you have inherited eternal life when we remember Jesus was now coming to start a new Testament a new covenant so he cannot be under the same ol Convenant Amen maybe and Lattimore talk about a covenant of grace which is linked to this message so we can understand why brother Brahim came you know the church brahms go said the church in Brahms and a church at the Nicaea council chose law for Greece but that grace commoner has to be restored to the church again because we can only make it by Greece we can never make it follow any law because none can follow the law none can follow any law rule I would have all been guilty of punishment and rejection ejection by now hallelu yeah but Greece Greece is the only thing that can help us make it so this young rich man taught that Jesus was going to tell him that guy dude you have no problem say we'll say all that that thou hast and come following me in other way Jesus ate said go and separate yourself from your power of riches but he says need also an appropriate problem was say go and separate us separation is a pain but the Bible says his mood changed it became very sad he just went I was sad he couldn't do what Jesus asked him to do and yet he thought that finding salvation oh I mean fine eternal life was something that he thought that he has lived correctly so he was expecting Jesus Christ who okay when Jesus really okay he means Jesus really suggested that he went separate himself from that last thing that was holding him said no rather heart is the last thing that is holding you and I wish everyone was here to listen to this so what start is that maybe somehow watching from home so let me say that way and sister off is the last let me look into the camera since the heart is the last thing that is holding you right what is it are you like that rich young fellow that went to Jesus and said good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and when she says tool here about the need for him to separate himself from money he goes sad and didn't even come back to Jesus walk with him beloved unless we to tout the Word of God calls for what to toss a pretty vibrant preach as someone about total separation on to be separate ourselves from these things we can't receive the part is among the hula goose the disciples that maybe two Pentacles as I said in the morning that church of Pentacles was Bev true pain persecution they all started when Jesus Christ was arrested the Oz cut it did he know how to do until he was erected then there was hope there was hope even then they were still afraid you were abducted in the upper room probably secretly until the tenth day after the Ascension of Jesus Christ then Holy Ghost now came and give them power then they went out now not afraid anymore of their priests and of the Sanhedrin beloved is to toss a preaching for us for some of us it's about women we can't separate you are married by still have some man something somewhere you can separate yourself young brother young sister maybe you are going to be married but you are doing what you know in Christ you are not supposed to do separate yourself Redwing separate yourself Abraham said that's oppression can come only in travail perfect reveal in prayer after Granville to separate yourself god bless you so be on our feet [Applause] this is a song that we sang the last time I think oh no that's what I want a
