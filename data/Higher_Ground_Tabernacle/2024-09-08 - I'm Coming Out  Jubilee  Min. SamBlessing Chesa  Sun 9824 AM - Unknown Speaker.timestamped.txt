[57:10] space of the seven sabbaths of years

[58:16] possession and ye shall return every man
[58:19] unto his
[58:21] family in the year of this
[58:24] Jubilee you shall return turn every man
[58:27] unto his

[58:36] 13 let us bow our
[58:39] heads Heavenly
[58:41] Father we come before your throne of
[58:43] grace and
[58:45] mercy thanking you and appreciating you
[58:47] for the opportunity you've given
[58:51] us to come into your
[58:54] house father we know that any educated
[58:56] men can read from the
[59:00] Bible but it only takes you
[59:03] father to Quicken those words from the
[59:06] pages of the
[59:09] Bible to make them living realities in
[59:11] our
[59:15] lives this is our prayer and heart
[59:17] desire
[59:19] father this morning may you speak
[59:21] through the
[59:24] speaker and may you hear through the
[59:26] hearer oh
[59:29] god father there is someone who has a
[59:33] need there's someone who has an unspoken
[59:38] request but father you can see that
[59:42] all and your word says you supply all
[59:44] our
[59:46] [Music]
[59:47] needs according to your reaches and
[59:51] Glory father we ask you to come and have
[59:53] full preeminence
[59:57] we yield
[59:58] ourselves and say may you the great
[1:00:04] speaker minister to us this
[1:00:08] morning in your son Jesus Christ might
[1:00:11] name we pray
[1:00:13] believe and the church shall
[1:00:16] say amen amen we can all take our
[1:00:22] seats
[1:00:24] amen so the scriptures that we
[1:00:28] read the
[1:00:30] Bible is talking about the law that God
[1:00:33] gave to the children of
[1:00:36] Israel amen amen it says after every
[1:00:40] seven
[1:00:43] years after every seven
[1:00:47] sabbaths they shall be a special
[1:00:52] year so that will be after 49 years
[1:00:58] so every seventh year was a was a
[1:01:00] Sabbath
[1:01:04] year and after seven of those seven
[1:01:08] years in the 49th
[1:01:12] year which is getting into the
[1:01:17] 50th God says it shall be a Year of
[1:01:22] Jubilee amen amen and it says
[1:01:26] and then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of
[1:01:28] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[1:01:31] seventh
[1:01:37] month and the day of
[1:01:41] atonement shall you make this trumpet to
[1:01:44] sound throughout all the
[1:01:47] land so the day of
[1:01:49] atonement was a day that was set
[1:01:53] aside and the high priest
[1:01:58] would get into the holy of
[1:02:01] holies and sprinkle
[1:02:04] Blood on the gold instruments in the
[1:02:07] inner
[1:02:09] Hol and that was an atonement for the
[1:02:12] whole children of
[1:02:16] Israel whatever sins they had
[1:02:20] committed the high priest was atoning
[1:02:22] for them
[1:02:28] whatever wrong they would have
[1:02:31] done the high priest was atoning for
[1:02:36] them and we know this was a
[1:02:39] type of Christ Our
[1:02:43] Savior who was the high
[1:02:46] priest who came at the end of it
[1:02:49] all to tie up each and everything that
[1:02:51] had happened in the in the Old Testament
[1:02:57] to be the final high
[1:03:00] priest amen amen so we see here that the
[1:03:04] Year of
[1:03:05] Jubilee or the trumpet of
[1:03:08] Jubilee was sounded on the day of
[1:03:14] atonement and at that's when everything
[1:03:17] was
[1:03:21] forgiven so the trumpet of Jubilee was
[1:03:23] sounded on the day of forgiv
[1:03:30] and in verse 13 we
[1:03:32] saw the Bible says in the Year of
[1:03:36] Jubilee you shall return every
[1:03:41] man his
[1:03:43] possession so we realized when the
[1:03:45] children of Israel left
[1:03:48] Egypt and they crossed off into their
[1:03:50] Promised
[1:03:52] Land Joshua portioned each and every one
[1:03:55] of them their
[1:04:00] possession their god-given
[1:04:04] rights this is your
[1:04:06] land this is your
[1:04:09] possession but during the course of the
[1:04:13] years over the course of
[1:04:16] time people got into
[1:04:19] Debs and they got themselves into
[1:04:24] trouble and they lost their
[1:04:27] land they lost their god-given
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:32] possessions amen but God Made A Way Back
[1:04:37] am and some of those people because of
[1:04:39] the crimes they would have
[1:04:42] committed they would be made
[1:04:46] slaves them and their
[1:04:49] family to go and work to repay their
[1:04:54] debts but although they were under
[1:04:58] law God gave them
[1:05:01] Grace he said despite you losing your
[1:05:06] possession you going to work as a
[1:05:10] slave every Year of
[1:05:13] Jubilee when that trumpet
[1:05:15] sounds that trumpet means you can go
[1:05:20] free amen amen it doesn't matter how
[1:05:23] many years you've been toiling as a
[1:05:24] slave
[1:05:27] as soon as you hear that sound of
[1:05:31] Jubilee you can leave whatever you were
[1:05:35] doing and you can go
[1:05:38] free and whoever had your
[1:05:41] possession you can walk back onto your
[1:05:46] land and kick them off and says this is
[1:05:50] my god-given
[1:05:53] possession I don't care what happened
[1:05:55] for for me to
[1:05:57] lose but the title did say it's
[1:06:02] mine I'm taking it
[1:06:05] back hallelujah amen during the course
[1:06:07] of your Christian
[1:06:10] Life you might have lost your
[1:06:13] joy you might have lost your
[1:06:17] peace but I'm telling you this
[1:06:19] morning Christ the high
[1:06:22] priest sounded the trumpet of Jubilee
[1:06:27] it does not matter the devil had stolen
[1:06:29] your
[1:06:31] joy go back to the
[1:06:35] devil say give me back my
[1:06:38] joy give me back my
[1:06:41] peace give me back my
[1:06:43] inheritance because this is my god-given
[1:06:50] blessing
[1:06:54] inheritance amen amen it doesn't matter
[1:06:56] what you have
[1:06:58] lost simply because it's
[1:07:01] yours you have each and every God given
[1:07:05] right to go claim
[1:07:07] it and what gives you the
[1:07:11] right if you are a son of
[1:07:15] Abraham remember we Are Spiritual
[1:07:19] Israel so long you are
[1:07:22] saved you are a son of Abraham
[1:07:26] and each and every
[1:07:28] promise that God gave to Our Father
[1:07:32] Abraham applies to you and
[1:07:34] me amen amen so you have each and every
[1:07:38] right to go possess the gates of the
[1:07:41] enemy God gave Abraham a
[1:07:45] promise thy seed shall possess the gates
[1:07:49] of the
[1:07:51] enemy so I'm telling you this morning
[1:07:55] you are Abraham
[1:07:57] seed so you can go and
[1:07:59] walk and possess the gates of the
[1:08:03] enemy that inheritance is
[1:08:06] yours we were born with
[1:08:09] amnesia when we came on this Earth You
[1:08:12] didn't know who you
[1:08:15] were we just thought you were born here
[1:08:18] to leave grow up and
[1:08:23] die we thank God for the
[1:08:28] that came to open our
[1:08:30] eyes and tell us where we came
[1:08:33] from that before the foundation of the
[1:08:36] world you were on the back part of God's
[1:08:40] mind you were in
[1:08:43] eternity so it does not matter what you
[1:08:45] go
[1:08:47] through you are a son of God you are a
[1:08:50] daughter of God you can say I know where
[1:08:53] I came from
[1:08:55] and I know where I'm going back
[1:08:57] to don't let Satan lie to
[1:09:00] you Satan had a
[1:09:03] beginning and he's going to have an
[1:09:06] end Satan was
[1:09:09] created but when he was
[1:09:11] created you were already
[1:09:14] there you can tell him when you were
[1:09:17] created I was already there so I'm
[1:09:20] senior than you are
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:26] you cannot tell me
[1:09:28] nothing amen amen and we were born with
[1:09:32] a
[1:09:33] purpose remember in
[1:09:36] Jeremiah God told
[1:09:38] Jeremiah before you were formed in your
[1:09:41] mother's
[1:09:45] wom I knew thee so before he was
[1:09:50] conceived God already knew him where was
[1:09:54] he was on the back part of God's
[1:09:57] mind he was just waiting for that
[1:10:01] manifestation so because God already
[1:10:03] knew
[1:10:05] you he had a purpose for you when you
[1:10:08] are born you go back to God and say Lord
[1:10:13] what's my
[1:10:15] purpose because he's the one who knows
[1:10:18] it your purpose is to be a Son of
[1:10:22] God to be a daughter of God to reflect
[1:10:26] what your
[1:10:28] father is because remember we are
[1:10:31] attributes of
[1:10:34] God amen amen we thank God for the
[1:10:37] message
[1:10:39] of if it was not for Mali
[1:10:42] 4 we wouldn't have
[1:10:45] known that Christ came to set us
[1:10:48] free that we cannot be held back by our
[1:10:51] habits no
[1:10:53] more amen
[1:10:55] Amen in
[1:11:01] Jubilee I forgot to give my
[1:11:04] title my title is I'm coming
[1:11:07] out if I'm to give a subtitle to it is
[1:11:12] Jubilee just turn around to your
[1:11:14] neighbor and say I'm coming
[1:11:18] out now turn to your other neighbor and
[1:11:20] tell them I'm coming
[1:11:23] out amen amen
[1:11:25] the prophet of God
[1:11:27] says now
[1:11:29] today many hundred years have
[1:11:33] passed but the same God that sent the
[1:11:36] jubilees in them
[1:11:39] days the same God who sends Jubilee
[1:11:44] today all the people that had been
[1:11:49] captured and was in
[1:11:52] captivity they come an acceptable year
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:11:57] and when the trumpet
[1:11:59] sounded then all the ones that were in
[1:12:03] captivity didn't have to pay the
[1:12:06] price they could absolutely Go
[1:12:11] free they could drop their ho if they
[1:12:14] were
[1:12:16] hoing or whatever instrument they were
[1:12:19] working
[1:12:22] with set free and go
[1:12:26] whilst they were in the fields
[1:12:28] working as soon as they hear that
[1:12:32] trumpet throw it
[1:12:34] away I've heard my
[1:12:37] freedom I don't have to pay the
[1:12:40] price because Christ paid the ultimate
[1:12:44] price on that day of
[1:12:46] Calvary so whatever debt you
[1:12:49] owed whatever sin debt you
[1:12:53] ow he paid for it all
[1:12:56] you don't have to suffer no more you
[1:12:59] don't have to live under your privileges
[1:13:02] anymore because he came to set you
[1:13:05] free hallelujah hallelujah I believe
[1:13:08] those children of
[1:13:10] Israel they were waiting for that
[1:13:12] day night before the Year of
[1:13:16] Jubilee night before the day of
[1:13:20] atonement they wouldn't go to sleep
[1:13:25] on their mind they had the possession
[1:13:28] that their fathers had left
[1:13:31] them say it's been a long while since
[1:13:33] I've been to my
[1:13:36] land it's been a while since I've seen
[1:13:39] my
[1:13:41] property and I believe they wouldn't
[1:13:43] fall
[1:13:45] asleep and they would wait out for the
[1:13:48] Sun for the sun to rise up the
[1:13:52] Horizon as soon as the sun rose
[1:13:57] up this was
[1:13:59] it I'm no longer
[1:14:02] bound amen amen we go to the next slide
[1:14:07] please it says now if
[1:14:11] somehow or or if the individual lost
[1:14:14] their inheritance that was given to them
[1:14:17] by God
[1:14:25] there come a year called The Jubilee
[1:14:30] Year and that was uh every seven years
[1:14:33] they had a
[1:14:36] rest or a Sabbath and in this
[1:14:40] Jubilee every man that had lost his
[1:14:43] inheritance by some means if he was a
[1:14:46] Freeborn and a true blooded Israelite
[1:14:56] no matter who held the
[1:15:00] possession it had to go back to him free
[1:15:02] of
[1:15:04] char if he was a freeorn true blooded
[1:15:10] Israelites only if you are predestinated
[1:15:12] Son of
[1:15:14] God can you walk up and claim back
[1:15:19] everything he didn't have to pay a
[1:15:21] thing he didn't have to do a thing but
[1:15:25] just stop what he was
[1:15:28] doing and go back to his
[1:15:31] inheritance hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:34] brother sister it does not matter who's
[1:15:36] holding your
[1:15:38] possession you say Satan you are holding
[1:15:41] my
[1:15:42] joy you are holding my
[1:15:44] peace but it's time for you to come back
[1:15:47] to me
[1:15:48] free I don't have to work for
[1:15:50] it you can say fear you have to go away
[1:15:55] I don't have to work for
[1:15:57] it anxiety you can go
[1:16:01] away you got to go you can say sin you
[1:16:05] have to
[1:16:06] go I don't got to pay for it because
[1:16:10] Jesus Christ already pay for
[1:16:12] it he paid the ultimate
[1:16:16] sacrifice amen amen every year once a
[1:16:21] year the high priest would go in
[1:16:25] the day of
[1:16:28] atonement atoning for the sins of the
[1:16:30] children of
[1:16:35] Israel so every sins you had committed
[1:16:37] from the beginning of the
[1:16:40] year until that time they were all wiped
[1:16:46] away actually in the Old
[1:16:48] Testament your sins were not wiped
[1:16:52] away they were just covered up by the
[1:16:54] blood of Bo
[1:16:57] and it was just for them to feel like
[1:17:00] they had been
[1:17:03] forgiven but they were actually not
[1:17:07] forgiven those sins were still
[1:17:09] there because the life of an
[1:17:13] animal is lower than the life of a
[1:17:18] man a man cannot the life of an animal
[1:17:22] cannot save a man
[1:17:25] so it was just to appease their
[1:17:28] conscience each and every year but this
[1:17:32] was a type of
[1:17:34] Christ amen amen God says time is come
[1:17:38] to an
[1:17:39] end for this
[1:17:41] Shadow and the reality had to come
[1:17:46] into huj God poured himself into the
[1:17:50] body of Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ it had to to take someone higher
[1:17:56] than
[1:17:58] men to save you and
[1:18:01] me only the life of a per of only a
[1:18:05] higher
[1:18:07] life can atone for your
[1:18:12] sins that's why Jesus when he
[1:18:15] came he died and he gave up his
[1:18:19] life and when he shed that
[1:18:22] blood he was the ultimate SA
[1:18:27] he was a spotless sinless Lamb of
[1:18:32] God that came to wipe away all of your
[1:18:36] sins this time around he was just not
[1:18:39] covering them
[1:18:41] up he was wiping them
[1:18:44] clean he says you are
[1:18:47] Justified as if you have not done
[1:18:50] it there is no
[1:18:53] evidence or I I heard someone
[1:18:56] say Jesus is the most corrupt
[1:19:02] lawyer
[1:19:06] lawyer they say because he gets rid of
[1:19:08] all the
[1:19:13] evidence when Satan comes to say he did
[1:19:17] that there is no evidence because you've
[1:19:20] never ever done it in the first
[1:19:22] place amen that's what he done for us so
[1:19:27] he was the high
[1:19:29] priest that was touched by the failing
[1:19:31] of our
[1:19:35] infirmity whatever you are going
[1:19:38] through he says I
[1:19:40] know there is nothing that he doesn't
[1:19:43] know so when you kneel down and go to
[1:19:46] God In
[1:19:47] Prayer know exactly what you were
[1:19:50] going he knows exactly what you were
[1:19:53] feeling
[1:19:55] it wouldn't be fair for
[1:19:58] him to be God him above
[1:20:02] us and not know what you were going
[1:20:05] through he cannot be touched by your
[1:20:09] feelings because he has no idea how it
[1:20:12] is to
[1:20:14] suffer then he decided to come down to
[1:20:16] become a
[1:20:19] man so he could feel each and
[1:20:23] everything that human can ever
[1:20:26] feel he he got
[1:20:29] sick he got
[1:20:31] hungry amen amen he felt
[1:20:36] rejected all the feelings you can ever
[1:20:39] go
[1:20:40] through he went through each and all of
[1:20:44] them Hallelujah huj but he overcame
[1:20:47] them amen amen Jesus was a 100%
[1:20:52] man and a 100% God
[1:20:56] he was not
[1:20:58] 5050 so he was me enough to go through
[1:21:00] all that you he went
[1:21:05] through God enough to overcome each and
[1:21:07] every one of
[1:21:09] us hallelujah so when you kneel down to
[1:21:13] pray you say Lord I know you know how it
[1:21:19] feels be where I'm at right
[1:21:22] now if it where
[1:21:25] you how would you
[1:21:27] feel sick please deliver
[1:21:32] me he knows what you are going
[1:21:34] through so he will come
[1:21:37] down because he said If my
[1:21:40] people who are called by my
[1:21:44] name if they humble themselves and
[1:21:47] pray he said I will hear from
[1:21:50] Heaven hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad
[1:21:53] I don't serve it dumb and deaf
[1:21:57] God the Bible says all other
[1:22:00] gods The Works of
[1:22:03] men Wen God does not speak back to
[1:22:08] you so glad our Mighty Savior Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ when we
[1:22:15] pray before I kneel down to
[1:22:18] pray he has already
[1:22:20] answered before I get up from
[1:22:23] there I know he is my God and he hears
[1:22:28] me and when he hears he acts on
[1:22:34] it many
[1:22:36] times we think that a no is not an
[1:22:41] answer we're only waiting for a
[1:22:44] yes but no is an answer
[1:22:47] too and he knows what's best for
[1:22:50] you you say Lord I want this
[1:22:55] but he's like nah if I give him or her
[1:22:58] that
[1:23:00] thing he's going to stop serving
[1:23:03] me it's only years
[1:23:06] later when you turn
[1:23:08] around you going to look and say oh I
[1:23:12] thank God he didn't give me
[1:23:14] that because if he gave me that I
[1:23:18] probably wouldn't be
[1:23:19] here so you got to thank God for the
[1:23:21] doors he opened
[1:23:24] thank God for the doors he has
[1:23:27] opened thank him for the doors he's
[1:23:29] closed
[1:23:31] too amen amen you can look back and
[1:23:34] say if I had married that other
[1:23:38] person I would be having Joy right
[1:23:42] now say thank you
[1:23:44] Lord because you know what's best for
[1:23:47] me amen amen go to Luke chapter 4 verse
[1:23:52] 17
[1:23:56] Luke you can follow along it says and
[1:23:59] there was delivered unto him the book of
[1:24:01] the prophet
[1:24:04] isah and when he had opened the
[1:24:07] book he found the place where it was
[1:24:11] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:24:16] me because he had anointed me to preach
[1:24:19] the gospel to the poor
[1:24:24] he had sent me to heal the
[1:24:28] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:24:31] the
[1:24:33] captives and recovering of sight to the
[1:24:38] blind to set at
[1:24:40] Liberty them that are
[1:24:43] bruised Hallelujah they say he walked up
[1:24:46] into the
[1:24:48] synagogue and the priest handed him the
[1:24:53] scroll he skipped all the other
[1:24:56] scriptures and he went to the one that
[1:24:59] was talking about
[1:25:01] him amen am when he started reading
[1:25:05] this he was reading his
[1:25:08] mission he was giving his mission
[1:25:13] statement many companies they have what
[1:25:15] they call a mission
[1:25:18] statement uh
[1:25:20] uh statement which is a summary DEC
[1:25:25] which is a summary of all that they
[1:25:29] do and they put it in one line as a
[1:25:32] mission
[1:25:35] statement and when you read that you
[1:25:37] know what the company is there for what
[1:25:39] they
[1:25:42] do when Jesus Christ was given the
[1:25:46] scripture he was letting them
[1:25:49] know what his mission
[1:25:53] was onto the Earth
[1:25:56] for to heal the
[1:26:01] brokenhearted Deliverance to the
[1:26:05] captives and recovering of sight to the
[1:26:09] blind to set at Liberty them that are
[1:26:12] bruised but uh ver
[1:26:16] 19 vers 18 to set at Liberty to them

[1:26:23] um uh
[1:26:27] thank you verse
[1:26:30] 19 to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:26:35] Lord and he closed the
[1:26:38] book and he gave it to the
[1:26:42] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[1:26:46] all them that were in the synagogue were
[1:26:47] fasten on him
[1:26:54] and he began to say unto
[1:26:56] them this
[1:26:58] day is this scripture
[1:27:01] fulfilled in your
[1:27:03] ears Hallelujah he says everything that
[1:27:06] I was
[1:27:08] reading it is about to
[1:27:11] happen this day this scripture is
[1:27:15] fulfilled and we' seen the previous one
[1:27:17] he says his mission was to preach the
[1:27:20] acceptable year of the Lord
[1:27:26] and we see what the prophet of God says
[1:27:28] here it says now Jesus was prophesied by
[1:27:33] Isaiah to preach the acceptable
[1:27:36] year and says that's what we want to
[1:27:38] deal on
[1:27:40] tonight now the acceptable year was
[1:27:45] this that during in the time between so
[1:27:48] many
[1:27:50] years the acceptable year
[1:27:54] is the year called in the old writings
[1:27:57] the Year of
[1:28:00] Jubilee so when Christ here in verse 19
[1:28:03] he was
[1:28:05] preaching says I have been
[1:28:08] sent to preach to
[1:28:11] you the Year of
[1:28:14] Jubilee hallelujah hallelujah all the
[1:28:17] jubilees that they had had in the
[1:28:20] past he says I'm coming to preach the
[1:28:24] final
[1:28:28] one and once he preaches the final
[1:28:31] Jubilee everything is done
[1:28:34] with amen amen so when he was on that
[1:28:39] cross and he was saying it is
[1:28:42] finished he was sounding the Jubilee for
[1:28:45] you and
[1:28:47] me before he went he was in the garden
[1:28:49] of
[1:28:52] gsan and he was thinking about the cross
[1:28:54] he was about to
[1:28:57] bear and he said
[1:28:59] Lord if it was my will I would
[1:29:04] not but
[1:29:06] nevertheless let your will be
[1:29:09] done he accepted that burden of the
[1:29:13] Cross do you know why he accepted
[1:29:15] it because he saw
[1:29:18] you he saw me he saw that you needed
[1:29:22] salvation
[1:29:24] he show that you needed
[1:29:26] healing and he says if I don't go what's
[1:29:30] going to happen to
[1:29:32] you if I don't go what's going to happen
[1:29:35] to your
[1:29:37] sins I don't go what's going to happen
[1:29:40] to the chains that are binding you and
[1:29:43] he says the father
[1:29:45] nevertheless let your will be
[1:29:48] done and he bore that cross for
[1:29:52] you he was stripped for your
[1:29:57] healing he had that
[1:29:59] chastisement for you he died for your
[1:30:03] sins and your
[1:30:06] iniquities he became your
[1:30:09] sin so you can become his
[1:30:12] righteousness hallelujah amen for the
[1:30:15] first
[1:30:16] time God left
[1:30:19] him that's why I said
[1:30:22] father why thou forsaken
[1:30:25] me because God Is So
[1:30:29] holy and so
[1:30:31] righteous he cannot carry
[1:30:35] sin so for Jesus to carry your
[1:30:39] sin God had to leave him it says father
[1:30:43] why has Thou forsaken
[1:30:45] me so Jesus knows how it feels to be
[1:30:50] rejected you are feeling rejected
[1:30:54] said Lord you know how it
[1:30:56] feels please come to my
[1:30:59] rescue and he went to that
[1:31:01] cross as a man not as God he carried
[1:31:06] your sin as a
[1:31:08] man and he carried for each and every
[1:31:11] one of
[1:31:12] us so you don't have to bear that cross
[1:31:15] no
[1:31:16] more because he carried it for
[1:31:19] you you don't have to be sick no
[1:31:22] more because he was sick for
[1:31:25] you you don't have to die no
[1:31:28] more cuz he died for
[1:31:30] you amen amen and when he was on that
[1:31:34] cross Heaven rejected
[1:31:37] him God left him and the Earth that he
[1:31:41] had come to die
[1:31:43] for the Earth rejected
[1:31:45] him so Heaven rejected him and Earth
[1:31:50] rejected him and he was hanging Between
[1:31:53] Heaven and Earth
[1:31:56] amen amen and while he was on that cross
[1:31:59] Brother s he had you on his

[1:32:14] condemnation that can take you
[1:32:17] down

[1:33:34] priest sounded that trumpet
[1:33:37] of Hallelujah Hallelujah and when Christ
[1:33:41] speaks everything has to
[1:33:44] happen he says all power in
[1:33:48] Earth all power that is in heaven was

[1:33:59] as a high
[1:34:00] priest sound the trumpet of
[1:34:03] Jubilee when he was walking on the

[1:34:07] Galilee demons were
[1:34:10] trembling saying what kind of a man is
[1:34:14] this those seven demons that were in

[1:34:43] demons and those demons as soon as they
[1:34:45] saw
[1:34:47] him it says why have you come to torment
[1:34:51] us recognized

[1:38:03] hallelujah after they took him off the
[1:38:07] cross they took him to the
[1:38:09] tomb it was a borrowed
[1:38:13] tomb they didn't know what was going
[1:38:17] on asked myself why would they borrow a
[1:38:21] tomb
[1:38:25] because it was someone else's
[1:38:28] tomb the person who owned it they were
[1:38:32] planning that when they
[1:38:34] die they would go in
[1:38:37] there but not KN what they were
[1:38:41] doing bored a tomb for
[1:38:45] Jesus borrowing means you are taking so
[1:38:47] you take it
[1:38:51] back when you bury someone in the
[1:38:55] tomb you seal it
[1:38:57] up we know Graves and tombs only work
[1:39:05] once once it's sealed you don't even go
[1:39:07] back
[1:39:08] there but these people not knowing what
[1:39:11] they were
[1:39:12] doing they were not even believing
[1:39:16] it they went to Joseph of
[1:39:19] AR and they borrowed the to
[1:39:23] saying we are putting Jesus in
[1:39:25] there they didn't know that that was a
[1:39:27] prophecy in
[1:39:30] itself a
[1:39:32] tomb for a man because he was not going
[1:39:34] to stay in
[1:39:37] there tomb was going to go back to his
[1:39:43] original they put him in that tomb they
[1:39:46] sealed it up I don't care how much seal
[1:39:49] they put in
[1:39:50] there because it was a prophecy
[1:39:54] he had to come out all the Old
[1:39:57] Testament was talking about the
[1:39:59] resurrection of chist it says I will not
[1:40:02] suffer my Holy
[1:40:04] One to see
[1:40:07] corruption that word had enough
[1:40:11] power open that
[1:40:13] tomb and resurrect Christ out of
[1:40:16] it hallelujah hallelujah so the word of
[1:40:19] God has enough power take whatever
[1:40:23] situation you are
[1:40:26] in the word of God is a word of
[1:40:29] Prophecy prophecy never
[1:40:32] fails propy never
[1:40:34] lies when they put him in that borrow
[1:40:38] Tom he knew he was coming
[1:40:41] out said you are going to destroy this
[1:40:45] Temple rebuild it in three
[1:40:47] days hallelujah they put him in a borrow
[1:40:51] tomb they sealed
[1:40:54] up and they put a soldier to guard
[1:40:58] it they say yeah this man's been talking
[1:41:00] about resurrecting so many
[1:41:03] times so we know his disciples are going
[1:41:06] to come and and seal it and steal his
[1:41:10] body and claim that he
[1:41:14] resurrected and they put a soldier
[1:41:17] there brother sister there is no soldier
[1:41:20] that can stop the Prophecies of God
[1:41:24] Hallelujah no man that can stop the
[1:41:26] Prophecies of
[1:41:28] God once it is speak
[1:41:31] spoken it has to
[1:41:33] happen Isaiah said when the prophecy
[1:41:36] when the word of God Is
[1:41:39] Spoken it does not go back to him
[1:41:42] void but it only goes back to him after
[1:41:46] he has
[1:41:48] accomplished spoken it
[1:41:50] for so the prophecy said
[1:41:54] Jesus Christ had to
[1:41:56] resurrect and they put him in that
[1:41:58] tomb but whilst his body laid there to
[1:42:03] rest he had a mission to
[1:42:06] accomplish hallelujah hallelujah that
[1:42:09] mission was for you and
[1:42:11] me when he said it is

[2:18:33] is my
[2:18:34] son Hallelujah so I don't care what
[2:18:37] people may call
[2:18:38] you I'm only
[2:18:41] calling myself what God says about
[2:18:45] me people might call you what they what
[2:18:48] you did to them
[2:18:51] remember when
[2:18:53] um Benjamin was
[2:18:55] born his mother called him
[2:19:00] benon Ben means son of
[2:19:05] pain the mother said you caused me a lot
[2:19:08] of
[2:19:10] pain I'm calling you

[2:19:16] came Jacob came and he says no he is not
[2:19:20] a son of pain his name is not
[2:19:24] benoni his name is Benjamin so he
[2:19:27] changed his name from son of pain to the
[2:19:31] son of my right
[2:19:32] hand right hand means son of
[2:19:37] authority so people might call you what
[2:19:39] you have made them go
[2:19:42] through but that doesn't matter I don't
[2:19:45] care what you I don't care what you call
[2:19:48] me what you say about me what matters is
[2:19:51] what God says about me Hallelujah Mary

[2:20:06] trumpet
[2:20:07] sound and she said I'm not a
[2:20:10] prostitute I'm a daughter of

[2:20:16] realization and she stepped
[2:20:18] out when God does that for
[2:20:21] you you got to step out of
[2:20:24] it amen amen and the Bible says if the
[2:20:29] son has made you

[2:20:34] partially
[2:20:36] free but fully
[2:20:39] free amen hallelujah hallelujah Christ
[2:20:42] came to set the captiv
[2:20:45] free you don't have to be bound by
[2:20:48] habits not a Halfway Christian Life

[2:20:57] free God anointed Christ to preach
[2:21:01] Freedom open the prison
[2:21:04] do amen so when God sets you
[2:21:08] free here Paul

[2:21:15] Liberty where with Christ has made us
[2:21:19] free and not entangled
[2:21:24] again with the Yoke of
[2:21:29] bondage don't be entangled with the Yoke
[2:21:32] of
[2:21:36] bondage don't be bound back again when

[2:21:41] free he that the son has set
[2:21:44] free is free
[2:21:47] indeed amen amen how many are thankful
[2:21:50] this morning
[2:21:52] for that trumpet of
[2:21:54] Jubilee to show you that you are not
[2:21:56] bound that the POS that you lost you can
[2:22:00] walk back to where the chain that used
[2:22:03] to bind you are not binding you no
[2:22:07] more I thank God for the message of the
[2:22:10] hour that came to blow that Jubilee in
[2:22:13] this last
[2:22:14] day to set us free from denominational
[2:22:18] spirit and he put us to be called the
[2:22:21] bride of
[2:22:24] Christ amen here the prophet says he
[2:22:27] says now I'm just your
[2:22:29] brother by grace of
[2:22:32] God when the angel of the Lord moves
[2:22:35] down it becomes a voice of God to
[2:22:40] you he says maybe I offended you by
[2:22:43] saying
[2:22:47] that forgive
[2:22:49] me but felt that might have been
[2:22:51] resented a little
[2:22:53] bit he says
[2:22:56] but I am God's voice to
[2:23:00] you see I say that again that time was
[2:23:05] under
[2:23:08] inspiration I felt bad about it the
[2:23:11] first
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:13] time repeated
[2:23:16] it says now I can say nothing in myself
[2:23:22] you show me I
[2:23:24] say you believe
[2:23:27] it and Watch What
[2:23:30] Happens hallelujah hallelujah he says I
[2:23:32] am God's voice to
[2:23:35] you the prophet wasn't giving us his own
[2:23:39] thoughts but he was giving us what God
[2:23:42] gave
[2:23:43] him he was just a
[2:23:46] mouthpiece say I am God's voice to you
[2:23:51] if I take this mic away from Brother
[2:23:56] Isaac you can't hear
[2:24:00] him but you were hearing the microphone
[2:24:02] right but the microphone wasn't
[2:24:07] speaking the microphone we can turn it
[2:24:09] on and leave it here for for two
[2:24:14] years put it here and turn up all the
[2:24:17] volumes
[2:24:21] you will hear nothing from this
[2:24:23] microphone the microphone doesn't have a
[2:24:25] voice of its
[2:24:26] own it only says what the person has
[2:24:29] spoken into
[2:24:31] it it's just a
[2:24:34] mouthpiece when the prophet God says I'm
[2:24:37] just a
[2:24:39] mouthpiece he doesn't speak his own
[2:24:43] thoughts speaking what God
[2:24:46] says that's why he says I'm God's voice
[2:24:52] you see the quote we read he tried to to
[2:24:53] not say
[2:24:55] it but just the inspiration just came
[2:24:58] back
[2:25:00] stronger amen amen so we know the
[2:25:03] message of the
[2:25:04] hour that we
[2:25:07] believe did not come by a
[2:25:10] man it came from
[2:25:13] Heaven this message that we
[2:25:16] believe did not come from
[2:25:19] Jeffersonville Jefferson it came from
[2:25:21] the Throne of almighty
[2:25:23] God hallelujah hallelujah that's why
[2:25:26] this message it has enough
[2:25:30] power to transform
[2:25:33] you look at
[2:25:35] yourself where would you be without this
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:40] message you wouldn't be
[2:25:42] here you have no idea where you would
[2:25:46] be thank God for the message of the hour
[2:25:50] that came to blow the Jubilee
[2:25:53] trumpet amen amen it is not the message
[2:25:56] of William
[2:25:58] BR it's the message of Jesus
[2:26:01] Christ that has come to show you that
[2:26:05] you are a son of God to show you that
[2:26:08] you have been set free you don't have to
[2:26:11] be held back by the denominational
[2:26:16] dogas he who the son has set free
[2:26:21] he is free
[2:26:23] indeed there's this one sister who came
[2:26:26] to brother
[2:26:27] Bram and she had a
[2:26:29] dream and the dream goes like this and
[2:26:33] she said brother
[2:26:34] Bram there's
[2:26:36] um they were in a
[2:26:40] cage and a couple of
[2:26:44] Believers and they were trying to come
[2:26:46] out of this cage but they could not
[2:26:51] and brother Bram came on the
[2:26:54] scene and she said brother
[2:26:56] Bram Deliver Us from this he said this
[2:27:00] is a house of
[2:27:02] hell and say you've been
[2:27:06] misunderstood and you misunderstood
[2:27:08] these
[2:27:10] people said these are fine people and I
[2:27:12] looked over
[2:27:14] there and like a great big seller
[2:27:20] or big walls down beneath a great big
[2:27:25] cave and great iron
[2:27:28] bars eight or 10 in
[2:27:32] thick and people out of their
[2:27:37] mind Twisted arms and
[2:27:41] legs beating their head like
[2:27:44] that and she was crying
[2:27:47] saying deliver the people brother Bram
[2:27:52] help us we are in
[2:27:54] trouble so the sister was in a
[2:27:57] dream this particular
[2:28:01] setting there were people that had um
[2:28:03] Twisted arms and
[2:28:07] legs and everyone was in
[2:28:10] prison they couldn't go
[2:28:12] free and this sister saw brother Bram
[2:28:14] and say
[2:28:16] brother deliver these
[2:28:18] people help us
[2:28:21] we are in
[2:28:22] trouble amen amen and I looked
[2:28:26] around and I said I wish I
[2:28:31] could and go
[2:28:34] on looking
[2:28:36] around and uh my little bitty body and
[2:28:39] them great big iron
[2:28:43] bars and those poor people in
[2:28:46] there and you couldn't get to them
[2:28:50] them iron bars were sitting so close
[2:28:54] together and I looked they were beating
[2:28:56] their head like they were out of their
[2:28:59] mind the prophet himself he looked at
[2:29:02] himself he said in my own
[2:29:05] capacity I cannot free these people and
[2:29:09] these people were in prison they wanted
[2:29:10] to be
[2:29:11] saved they wanted to be
[2:29:14] delivered and he says I seen some lights
[2:29:16] flickering around in there
[2:29:20] and I looked up and there stood the Lord
[2:29:24] Jesus with a light of rainbow around
[2:29:28] him and he was looking right straight to
[2:29:31] me and said deliver those people and he
[2:29:35] went away the man himself he could not
[2:29:39] deliver the people but then because he
[2:29:42] was a mouthpiece of
[2:29:45] God God gave him a
[2:29:47] message he gave him an assignment
[2:29:51] go deliver these
[2:29:53] people and I
[2:29:54] thought how could I deliver
[2:29:57] them I Haven got strength enough in my
[2:30:00] arms to break those
[2:30:02] bars he didn't have strength in his body
[2:30:05] to do
[2:30:06] it amen so I said House of Hell give way
[2:30:13] to the name of Jesus
[2:30:15] Christ and all the creaking and popping
[2:30:20] rolling and bar started falling
[2:30:24] down and people started running and
[2:30:27] screaming
[2:30:29] delivered and screaming at the top of
[2:30:31] their
[2:30:33] voices and were all
[2:30:35] delivered why because the man came with
[2:30:37] a message from
[2:30:39] God house of Hell give way to the name
[2:30:43] of Jesus
[2:30:44] Christ hallelujah amen so brother sister
