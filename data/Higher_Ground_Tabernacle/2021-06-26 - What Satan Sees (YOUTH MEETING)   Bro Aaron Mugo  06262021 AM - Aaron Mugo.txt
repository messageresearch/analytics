[Music] himself and my first time meeting him but the brothers have referred him and i i trust their word we're just believing that our brother's going to bless us you know i got a witness from the lord too so it's not just the brothers i just know that uh god the young people you people who are still young now when you get my age you can just have faith that you still are but by god's grace you got you got a treasure if you're going to serve god the best time to do it is now because you got the strength you got the mind you got the energy and uh believe it or not when you you you when people see you stirred up about god especially elderly people they know that something's real because we're living in such a wicked age and so when you see people young people especially talking about jesus it gets everybody's attention and i'm not going to preach because i'm not the preacher but we want our brother to come and uh take his liberty by god's grace yes brother and uh let go and let god amen amen all right is this on oh nice i like i've never used one of these before um let's uh just start with the word of prayer thank you for your work heavenly father thank you for bringing us here together safely lord we realize that we can putting put any effort forward that we'd like to try to gather together lord we we spend the money and we do our best to travel we travel safely if we can lord we can study in our notes lord we can try to be in a prayerful atmosphere to invite your presence lord but none of that is none of that is worth it if you don't show up lord jesus we just we invite you to be here and among us lord we recognize where two or three are gathered that you'll always honor your promise to be among us and that means you're here lord jesus we just ask that you move freely in our hearts and help us to surrender to your will lord jesus we just want to hear what you have for us not that not that i'm special or anything or any of these congregation members are special to be here nobody on the stream we're not special lord we we just want to be here with the one who is special we want him to move in our lives we ask you and we invite you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen all right if you open your bibles let's go to isaiah while i'm talking here isaiah chapter 14 and then we'll go to verse 12. and while you're turning to that uh i just want to say i thank you the church for inviting me here i recognize the spirit on brother isaiah is a wonderful one to invite a young minister who's not been tried probably as effectively as the older generation but um still has a burning heart who wants to surrender to the lord i'm very well i feel very welcome here like everything from going to the office coming over here hearing the music and the singing i appreciate it brother caleb i i appreciate these brothers here who travel with me it's a about a nine hour drive coming from kentucky and if you don't know me i'm brother aaron my last name is mugo and uh i live in kentucky but i go to church in indiana just across the river and um yeah i love the lord and that's the important thing amen and i recognize that if you would if you're a young person and you come out here on a saturday and take time off to come over here you must love the lord too and i feel very honored to be um counted worthy to speak to you guys i i realized that you're god's children and i could say something that will be wrong i pray that that just gets thrown in the trash and you just take even if it's just a little bit that's right out of this service just take it out um i just want to follow the will of the lord here you know um okay so here in isaiah chapter 14 let's go to 12. this is actually talking about lucifer and there's two chapters specifically in the bible that referred to him directly as if it's talking to him and one of them is in ezekiel chapter 28 the other one is in isaiah here in 14. so he says how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did speak in the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high that's up to 14 so you may be seated that's the main text i wanted to read today just to start with and i wanted to talk on the topic um what god sees i mean sorry what satan sees um because you got to realize that brother branham tells us that we're in the greatest battle ever fought and for there to be a battle there is an adversary and then there is our side which you want to be on god's side so there's god's side then there's satan's side and satan's side is always expressed by doubt in what god has what god says so god's word although it created the world and although we we live in it and we study it and everything like we focus on it as christians although that is presented to us if you do anything outside of it or if you doubt it or if you don't take it as it is the way god wants it to be then um then you're on satan's side and you're doubting that's doubt so uh if you does anybody have a schofield bible anybody reading one of those you got one uh okay well i guess i'm in the minority so if you go to your scofield bible actually and read the same exact scripture in isaiah 14. uh let me just turn to it real quick we have this should be on page 726 because i remember it now brother branham used a scofield bible and i bought one from the voice of god in order to you know just be like the prophet you know i don't really know what i was thinking whenever i did that i just did it but then when i i mean i know he doesn't agree with everything that schofield says but he says a profound statement at the bottom of the page in reference to this chapter talking to satan which we just read we didn't read the whole chapter just those few verses right there but he has a statement down there and it says when lucifer said i will sin began he said when lucifer said i will sin began and you can tie it right back to the message because brother branham says that we are a triune being just like god and we're in three parts it's our body soul and spirit so you have your physical senses you know see taste your smell uh feel and then you have the spiritual senses you have memory reasoning all those ones over there i don't remember all of them right now but you have all of these senses but then whenever you get down to your soul what happens your soul is whatever accepts the word or denies the word so uh in reference to that you have either faith or doubt and that's down in your soul it's not five senses it's just either faith or doubt so whenever the word is presented to you you either take god's instructions or you take god's way and that's god's will and if you're outside of that that automatically makes you in satan's will amen all right and nobody wants to be in there right i mean raise your hands if you want to be in things well right no okay no no hands that's what i thought nobody wants that um so whenever he said now the reason that schofield says way back in heaven sin began keep in mind this is before the fall of satan this is before he led all those angels out there to go against in in a fight against michael and all that history before the world actually begins before he falls down to earth so way back then satan was already sinning in his heart he was already sinning right there because he said i will it's like my will so you gotta you gotta think of it this way an angelic being is actually they're different from us because they are godly they were godly from the day they were conceived right they are trying to achieve that perfect word perfect will of god they aren't doing that because we are we had to because we fell and god created us to be like this this was his will um not his perfect will but his permissible this is exactly how he planned for things to go so back whenever angels were all angels and they were all in the will of god they were all living the will of god keep in mind lucifer was sinning in his heart and it started in his heart he hadn't actually manifested those sins in the outside by actually acting on them he hadn't started a rebellion he hadn't done any of that stuff but he was already sinning way down in his heart way down in his soul and i just wanted to show you that we often do the same thing ourselves if you think about it now you can actually i'm trying to keep in mind the title is what satan sees so you're trying to look at this from satan's perspective and you don't want to like keep a godly perspective on things this is just the way he's thinking so you can actually see it if you go to matthew chapter four um let's see chapter 4 verse 1 through 11 you actually don't actually have to turn to that but i had that written down this is right after jesus is baptized by john the baptist he goes out into the wilderness and then he fast for 40 days so after 40 days everybody knows he was he was tempted three times so if you if you want to get an idea of what satan's thinking and what he views the world as you can actually look at it at his interactions with god throughout the bible you can see it so when he's talking face to face with jesus the first thing he says is why don't you turn this stone into bread right that was the very first temptation now if you look at that that's just the way he's thinking so the way he's thinking is i i i want something and i'm going to use god's word to get it that's not the way you should be thinking because that's the devil's way of thought now he's like i have this power god promised it in the word i if i have faith then i can apply it to the stone and it's going to become bread so he's just offering to jesus what he thinks is the ultimate offering like what he thinks like there is nothing wrong with it because he has the word to back it up and he's presenting it to him so from the devil's point of view that's the correct application of the word to serve yourself and you can see that a lot in the world in the christian world nowadays some people go out there and they might be ministers they might be something else but they'll use the word to fight their battles and start arguing back and forth with each other and they're like hey this book says this this quote says this i'm gonna throw it in your face and all that stuff that's not what you want to use it for you want the word to use you you want god to use you you want him to work through you and handle his word correctly that's why jesus had his responses were always it is also written it is also written when you look through all of these temptations that's super important that you take the entire word you don't just take that little portion that serves your own interests very important all right so to jesus that would be self-serving if he actually listened to what the devil said it would be okay i'm trying to help my body in my flesh my physical body i'm just gonna turn this into bread then i'm gonna eat so it helps me but you gotta gotta remember that that wouldn't be in god's will see god's will had him out there fasting so he would be breaking his fast of his own accord if you think about it and read on through the chapter you realize that the angels come down and minister to him after he fasts because god's will was hey i'm going to make sure to minister him to him at the appropriate time when he needs the strength to go on with his ministry but if he broke it off early there that would be his own will and that wouldn't be god's will okay so the second the second temptation let's look at that one too um he takes them up to a high place i always imagined him on top of a skyscraper even though i don't really know what where he was he was just on top of a really tall building or high up place might have been a mountain i don't really know but satan tells him hey if you if you step off of here and you follow the way down god's gonna make sure you're not gonna dash one foot against the ground and he had the scripture to prove it he referred to the old testament he's like hey this that's what it says and then jesus responds with thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god so how would that be self-serving in jesus's case because i've often been in situations like you know you're probably in a dangerous situation and you're like god's gonna help me you know you just walk on but that doesn't mean that you can just walk down any street during any time of day and expect to be safe because you're technically tempting him if you know better and you're putting yourself in that situation that's tempting god in a way you know and that would be self-serving because you're just like throwing everything caution to the wind so that's that's the phrase you throw caution to the winds and you just walk where you shouldn't go or you do something you shouldn't do because you know god's gonna take care of it he might not take care of it in order to teach you something you don't know the mind of god no one can know the mind of god it's written in the scripture who can know the mind of god so if jesus had actually taken him up on that he would just be satisfying his own curiosity and that is pointless it's not going to help anybody but jesus and it's just probably going to prove to the people around him that god is with me ooh look at me you know but that wasn't god's will that he steps off of the high place and falls down that wasn't his will in the first place third temptation same exact thing same exact train of thought see you got to think of it from the devil's perspective there is no way out of the tests that he's giving jesus to his perspective because he thinks that's the correct application of the word he actually truly would apply it that way because in his heart he said i will and that's the mind of satan that's the way he thinks he doesn't want he doesn't want to follow god's will he just wants to use god's power for himself so that's the that's exactly the way satan is thinking so the third temptation he says all you have to do is bow down to me and i'll give you everything uh i'll give you the kingdoms of this world he shows them everything and i don't i don't know i always pictured him showing all the kingdoms of the world past present and future like all at the same time and saying this is mine can you imagine if i just gave it to you all you have to do is bend the knee for like two seconds and give me some worship that's all you have to do now from jesus's perspective you know that sounds like the easy way out because he wouldn't have to go through the suffering of the cross to die for our sins and then have a whole generations after generations of people deny his name and actually spurn the blood and the blood sacrifice that he's given us he would just get it immediately right there just by bowing down for a little bit but that wasn't god's will god's will was that he'd go through gethsemane he'd get he'd get uh he'd get he'd grow in character and that he would be the perfect sacrifice by the time that the sacrifice occurred he wasn't at that point yet he hadn't died out in gethsemane so um so back here it was very necessary that uh wait i lost my train of thought yeah it was very necessary that jesus go through all of these things and the devil just wants him to think of himself just for a little bit just for that one instant and the devil wants you to think the exact same thing now it's very applicable to the way you live your lives and what you go go throughout i mean the decisions you make throughout the day you might not be thinking much of those decisions but they might be tiny and the devil just wants you to compromise a little bit at a time just a little bit just a tiny bit in an inch at a time you give him an inch he's just gonna make it a little farther and a little farther all right so you just need to watch for that okay uh now i wanted to show you guys that this lane of this line of thinking is a very modern way of thinking have you guys how many people here in school i mean we're young people right who's doing school everybody most people okay how many people have been to school before right no you never went to kindergarten no okay well all right okay whatever um but if you go to school then they're going to probably show you something like the theory of evolution right and this drives me up the wall i cannot stand the theory of evolution because i i don't understand why you take the bible out of school and say that it's just a theory and that it's just religion and it's something that shouldn't be taught in school because there's no fact behind it and then replace it with the theory of evolution do you realize how ridiculous that sounds it's the theory so it's a theory why are we teaching it in school as if it's fact it's a theory in a theory for a theory to be to not become a theory and become fact science will tell you that it needs to be verifiable and repeatable that means you need to be able to take it through the scientific process and test it and then prove it and do it again and again and it comes up with the same results so that's the reason the theory of evolution is stuck where it is because you can't test it if you can't test it then it's still a theory but i know something right here that's been tested over and over again and it's not a theory anymore right it's not a theory to me you can see over and over again throughout people's lives there's recorded instances over and over again of the word being proved on the basis of itself god can square it swear by no higher than himself and that's the word right here he just proves it right here over and over again it's not a theory to me yet they'll rip it out of school and then they'll put the theory of evolution in there why i say it drives me crazy is because um not only does it stay cuz there's somewhere to put this not only does it stay as a thank you brother not only does it stay in school i'm just gonna get a little comfortable here i don't like sleeves um not only does it stay in the school but they try to put a political spin on things and everybody knows how politics goes 2020 it's 2021 actually 2020 was a bad year for politics he saw black lives matter and all that stuff popping up and everybody just wants to prove that the way you're born is the way you're supposed to be and everybody should accept you for who you are and that's like the part that's that's where you find a lot of social justice warriors we were talking about hey this man is born and he has a spirit on him of hey liking other men or this woman likes other women that's just social justice because they say it's okay the way god made you is the way you're going to be and that's the way you should stay that's what that's what the politics of the day will tell you it'll keep pushing the stuff at you and it'll keep they'll keep doing it especially when i got to college that's whenever i start to realize that when i was 19 i first got here i came here for school i was out of the country before that and i came here and i was like man let's see what i can learn you know and uh i didn't think that i would be hit with so much stuff like this it's like there were there was black power movement there's a white power movement there are nazis there are people who are pushing their own agendas there are feminists there are transgenders there's lgbtq plus and all that stuff so many letters and it's just getting longer and longer and it's like do i need to really know and focus on all of these things it's like because there are so many different ways that people are born you got to recognize that the devil the gates of hell are opened at the moment and the devil is going to work his way through people and put different spirits on people such a different wide variety of people that are born and they just have different spirits that are born on them but the problem with the world's idea of democracy is the fact that they believe the way you're born is the way you're supposed to stay and god made you special wait no not god because they don't believe in god right they just believe that you were born special and everybody has a vote in everybody that's their idea of democracy you can't tell someone that they're more intelligent than somebody else because that's that's demeaning to them you can't speak the truth and say that something is right and something is wrong because that's demeaning to those people because everybody should be treated equally that's whenever you read the message you see brother branham say that that is the spirit of communism and i believe that because it's just wrong like to their minds they're just thinking that everyone can be the same and everyone needs to be treated perfectly well for all those wrong things that they're doing in the bedroom all the bad things that they support and all those spirits that they allow to come on them now if you know if you really know the word then you realize that we're not in a democracy we're in a monarchy god is king and we're in a democracy under that because god treats all of us equally he loves us all equally that's the true democracy that i believe in you know but their democracy if you want to there's actually a word for it i was listening to some sermons here and there and there was a man who defined it and he talked about it it's this word it's called humanism now humanism there's a few definitions i have for them and the first one is it's is a belief humanism oops humanism is a belief in the value freedom and independence of human beings that's what it says uh there's another one that says humanism and this is from the american humanist association you know an authority on humanism it says humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that without theism or other supernatural beliefs affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good so i know that's a lot of words but i'm going to read a couple more definitions just hang on with me okay i know it's a lot of big words but whatever humanism is a rational philosophy informed by science inspired by art and motivated by compassion affirming the dignity of each human being that's that democracy they're talking about affirming the dignity of each human being it supports the maximization of individual liberty and opportunity consonant with social and planetary responsibility maximization of individual liberty now that's saying that however you are you should be loved by everybody and accepted by everybody and there's nothing wrong with you now i think that religion and christianity i think that that is one of the only places you can go to that allows you to accept yourself for what you really are tells you body soul and spirit what you are and provides a path for self-improvement now the way they're talking right here is the way you are is perfect and you're okay and we accept you just like that but we accept that we understand that we've fallen short of the mark of god amen we recognize that we needed a savior we needed salvation we needed all of these things and it's out of our control to get there we need god to show us we needed god to show us the way we needed him to come down and die on the cross and shed his blood and to do everything because we are weak we are weak as human beings we realize this flesh is just temporary and we're going to die we don't have the strength to do anything beyond this um beyond our flesh we couldn't help our own spirits we couldn't we couldn't help our souls we couldn't provide any sort of payment to pay for that we couldn't do any of that we needed god and okay there's another one here it says humanists believe that human experience and rational thinking provide the only source of knowledge and a moral code to live by that's one of my favorite ones because it says that there's a moral code and if you go to if you go to school in uh probably college university whatever and you go to an ethics class ethics is talking about morality and what's good and what's wrong what's good what's bad what you should do and what you shouldn't do but if you go to the ethics class they're going to tell you that what's considered ethical is relative to the person opinion that means what elijah right there thinks is ethical i'm not going to think is ethical but that's his version of what's ethical and my version is different and it depends on each person what is right and what is wrong they'll tell you that everything is right and everything is wrong depending on the person it depends on who has the opinion in the first place i know that's kind of confusing but hang on with me but i think that's ridiculous because if you go to that class and a professor tries to teach you that whatever you decide to do is right or wrong it's okay there's no such thing as a scientific origin of ethics then you go to that class i dare you to cheat in that class and cheat on the final exam what's the teacher going to do he's going to fail you even though it's right in your mind right let's say cheating was right right just tell them hey cheating was right because i thought it was right to them they say it was wrong therefore you're going to fail the class so it automatically doesn't even make sense i don't know that seems really confusing i can see the blank looks on your faces right now okay so to them let me try to break it down again um let's say i think stealing is right and there's nothing in science that can tell me that stealing is wrong that means i should be allowed to steal as much as i want from wherever i want and according to science there's nothing wrong with that that means i should be allowed to hit somebody and walk away with no recrimination violence uh murder anything that i decide to do should be right according to me so according to science since they can't prove that it's wrong and according to modern political thinking since they can't prove that it's wrong therefore it must be right to you and therefore it's okay but if that were true why do we have prisons why is there a law what is that based on where did that come from that's the question if you ask them where society's laws came from and where the bill of rights and the declaration of independence came from guess what they're going to tell you here they came from the bible that's where all those rules came from in the first place it came from spiritual minded men who were trying to do the best for their country and setting everything in order but they used a book as a basis for that and since they threw that out the window they have to come up with a whole bunch of justifications for how something is right in everybody's heart even though it goes against the word of god they have to say hey look we have a bill of rights but that's not important because you know science says that there is no law there's no basis for our law there's nothing repeatable there's nothing to show you in the word i mean there's nothing to show you in science that can prove that that law is correct there's nothing in science that can tell me that i shouldn't murder somebody and i just think that's just a backwards way of thinking now keep in mind that whole spirit comes from the devil in the first place this is the this is the devil's way of thinking and you're probably going to hear this if god's such a good god why did he let those people die anybody ever heard that before i've heard that lots of times right why did he let those people in the in the bible die why did he let this happen why did he let that happen so to them um wait actually there's this lady uh i've never told you guys this story before but there's this lady who i work with and she was talking to me and she has a she has a perverse spirit on her she's a lesbian and she said she read the whole bible one time but she was a health care worker so she had seen healing happen and she couldn't deny that there was a god but she didn't didn't accept what the bible said so she didn't like religion but she couldn't deny that there was a god so we've had a lot of arguments let's just say that um but one of them she uh she was talking to me and we were talking on the subject of what's in the bible and she told me that she doesn't believe that god told people with she told me that she doesn't believe that anybody that god would tell anybody to kill somebody else that he would never tell you to kill somebody else well i told her when i opened the bible and i'll go to the old testament it shows a lot of instances it told joshua to kill a lot of people he got armies together and killed whole cities so i said my bible says that god would show some people to do that and she didn't take that very well so she said that wasn't god she said whoever was in the bible telling them to do that they must have had dreams and they must have come up with it on their own because god would never tell them to do that and i told her well we had a very we had a pretty strong argument after that each side was trying to present their side then like we stopped the conversation we walked away and after a while i was thinking about it and i was just like in her mind i realized that there was no way our our discussion would come to a a good conclusion like there was no way we would see eye to eye because in her mind she had an absolute that she made up in her head to me i had an absolute that i could see in the word so all of my arguments were based on this but she didn't even have this so to her she said i have an idea of what god is in my mind and i'm going to hold on to that and i'm going to live my testimony based on that idea in my mind and it was wrong but she was still going to go on with it and she was still going to push forward with it what happens whenever you come up with your own idea of what god is that becomes an idol and that's exactly what they had in the old testament they had their own ideas of what god does and what he's supposed to do and how he's supposed to move and they packed them into these little wooden statues and stone statues and ceramic statues whatever you see they made them their selves and then they said hey this is god right here and this is what he's able to do and most of those gods didn't even create the universe they were just gods of little pieces like this is the god of the trees or this is the god of lightning that's the god of water you know they had different gods but that's not what god is god is god of everything he's god of me and you he's god body soul and spirit everything you can see and that you can't see the intangible in the in the tangible all of it together god's still god just like brother caleb was saying god is god you can do any of those things and more that we don't even understand he's beyond our comprehension amen okay so this is the arg let's see this is the thought that goes through most people's head god they're told that god is a good god first right so they say if god is a good god he loves me that's true god loves us right but then they get derailed off of that because they're like therefore if god loves me he wants me to have everything i want that's where it goes south it's not the right thing anymore granted god wants you to have all good things all good blessings but he is the one who knows whether it's good for you or not he knows the appropriate time for you to have it yes so so they say that uh oh wait i got i got lost somewhere okay yeah so that's the line of thinking therefore if god wants me to have everything that i want i can take everything i want that that's what that means that means i can do what i want and i can still be justified by god those people who who accept salvation for their souls but only do it halfway and don't go all the way to get the holy ghost and seek god's leading that's where they end up stuck because they're just thinking hey now that i've been saved and since i've been predestinated and everything that means i can do everything that i want to do and god's not going to do anything i'm still going to make it to heaven and that's not right that's not that's not what god wants you to stop at he wants you to seek his mind he wants you to seek after his will and to grow in the in the body and spirit everywhere he wants you to grow in him to be more like him he wants to give you better character but if you keep putting up blocks like that saying that i want this and i want that and i'm going to insert this that's exactly what the devil does in his own thinking that's where that's what got satan where he is right now so uh i actually want to look at a few uh examples of uh of what the devil was doing and what the what his agents were thinking so let's go to numbers chapter 13. uh let's see yeah numbers 13 verse 26 so this is after uh moses sends out the 12 spies to go spy out canaan and uh they hadn't moses hadn't died yet so they weren't going to enter into the promised land yet because of this moment of failure it's that kadish barnia and they had a moment of decision to make where they either choose to go god's way and to take him at his word or to fall back and not go all the way through so verse 26 it says and they went and came these are the spies coming back to moses with their report it says and they went and came to moses into aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness apparent to kadish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land so they couldn't deny that there were fruits and what god had promised would be there was already there they couldn't deny that because they could see it there they actually brought back the fruits and said hey this is what god promised us and here it is in our hands they couldn't deny that so verse 27 it says and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sent us dust and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it so they're still showing them the fruits nevertheless the people keep in mind they talked about a bushel of grapes that was so big that it took two men to carry it right it was like gigantic so they like held it between them on their backs just like that that's how big the bushel of graves was so 12 men went in 12 minutes came out says nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there verse 29 and just just watch this verse closely it says the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the and the can and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan so you got to think these men went over there and saw you can equate these to demons in anything you'd like to because that's how that's what israel does it types the church of nowadays so they went over there and they saw all the opposition of the devil came back and they just started testifying on behalf of the devil saying look there are fruits yes so i admit that what god said is true in his word but there's so much to to fight against me that i'm not gonna take it because they said look there's all these jebusites there's all these ice there's amorites there's canaanites there's just so many of them the anakin all of them and then they start talking about how it would be so hard to follow the will of the lord even though the fruits were there so they took the devil's testimony and put it up here and denied the lords they had his down here so they took the devil's opinion it was just ever so slightly high like they just took that and they just could not unsee it that's what the devil wants you to do so verse 30 it says and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we see they took the devil's word for it and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the giants the son of the sons of anak which come of the giants here's the important part and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight you understand at that point since they since they took the devil's testimony at the beginning they had a low opinion of themselves it says and so we were in their sight because i have a low opinion of myself then the devil has a better opinion of himself and makes me look weak that's exactly how it the devil will use that over and over again to discourage you and make you doubt god's word and whenever he brings you down makes you so discouraged that you don't want to take a step forward that's whenever he looks down he's like i got him i got her that child of god i i just i don't even have to work anymore because they're just stuck down there and they don't think any better of themselves that's where that's what the devil wants you and that's his perspective also but there are there's a couple of cases in the bible where the children of israel and other people don't let the devil get them down and actually rise up to the occasion where they where god wants them to be and have a better opinion of themselves often enough it takes god's intervention personally for them to realize where their place was and then to rise to the occasion so one of them is in joshua let's go to chapter two joshua two verse one so this is after they wandered in the wilderness because they failed at canada's parnia still the children of israel and uh it comes back moses dies aaron dies i think miriam dies after that and joshua is the one leading the children of israel now and he's pointing them at the word of moses and bringing that to the forefront and it says in joshua chapter 2 it says and joshua the son of nun sent out of sh to ten two men who to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named rahab and lodged there and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in in hither tonight of the children of israel to search out the city so first of all let me point this out these are just two men and they're the worst spies i've ever heard of like the absolute worst if you think about it moses day he sent 12 men into this land and they wandered back and forth through multiple cities nobody caught them they went all throughout that place they even managed to steal a bushel of grapes came back out and the canaanites never knew that they were there but these two men they're just really terrible because they walk in and they go straight into the first city i think it's probably the first day they walk in there and not only do they get found out they end up in the red light district district near rahab's house because she was a harlot right so she was the wrong side of town they end up there and not only that but they end up stuck on her house on her rooftop and their lives are at the mercy of just a regular old harlot in the middle of a city so at that point i don't know if i were you but i'd be seriously discouraged i'd be really discouraged because i'd be like well we can't do anything right now if you go down to verse 8 it says and before they were laid down because they were going to stay the night before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof so you're going to see the story change because even though they were in a bad place of discouragement even though they were the children of god they've been caught and found out by the enemy and they were stuck on a rooftop and just hiding in a house and all that stuff even though all of that is going down and their spirits are at their lowest god comes down and uses them lips of rahab a harlot to encourage them and to lift up their spirits just look at what she says verse 9 and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you now if i was standing there and someone told me that in that condition i'd be like are you sure you have the right guy i mean look at me i'm just stuck in the red light district like in in two seconds if you say the wrong word guards are going to kick down your door and come up and kill us that's like the worst thing that could happen to me right now and you're telling me that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of us if you actually look at their their king their not their kingdom but their nation where they were they they were about to cross the i'm pretty sure they were about to cross the river jordan they hadn't crossed it yet so there was no way to cross the river jordan at that moment and all of them have been wandering the wilderness like all the old generation had died so all of these people were adults that only knew about wandering the wilderness they didn't know about living in cities they were just men women and children just regular folk who didn't know how to fight they didn't have any weapons of war they didn't even have real weapons for real like they probably killed the king of hog by that time so they had a few weapons but they weren't like an actual invincible army and you look at the walls of jericho brother branham said that they could run two chariots on top side by side that's how big they were that's how thick they were and that's just how huge they were and they had weapons of war the city was basically impregnable you could not get inside there and she said all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you these people in their their clothes that were hand-me-downs from years before like 40 years old clothes that's how old they were from their parents and they don't even know how to look for food or anything like that because they're used to food falling out of the sky they don't even know how to i mean how to pluck fruits out of the trees or anything like that they don't know how to harvest they don't know how to plant they don't know anything and they're scared of the of the children of israel they're just scared of them all the people of jericho and it goes on in verse 10 she continues to testify basically on god's behalf he's using her it says for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when he came out when he came out of egypt and what he did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihan and og whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath and she was testifying to god their god not the god of the the canaanites not whoever those gods were because there had to be plenty of gods by them with all those kingdoms not those gods but she testified that their god was true god that he had the strength she just heard some stories that were told of people who travel traveled over the river jordan at that point so all she had were stories to go off of and she had a great testimony and then at the end of it if you go down to verse 23 it says so the two men returned keep in mind they've been encouraged by what the what the harlot said it says so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all these things that befell them and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us so the testimony of their enemy changed their own testimony changed their own lives and if you remember after that the the kingdom of jericho just fell they just took the will of the lord they took that testimony and they rolled with it just because they could see what was in the mind of satan they could see that all of satan's agents were scared of them that's all it took just seeing what the devil thinks of you and i'm just telling you this for your own self you realize the devil is actually really scared of us right now coming in the church right now and singing like caleb saying like brother isaiah is saying coming over here sacrificing our time and welcoming the presence of the lord he's scared of something like this happening because he knows a change can happen in each and one each and every one of your lives he's scared right now and i'm just trying to show you that because that's just the way he thinks first of all he thinks that his will is the best will he wants your will to be like his will which is basically not god's will and then second sorry third he wants he wants you to be to think little of yourself he wants you down here he wants you way down here because if he can if he can get you to think that way that's the way you're gonna be and that's all it takes okay let's look at another situation because it happens throughout the bible let's go to judges chapter seven um verse nine and uh yeah so this is this is the story of gideon in the book of judges and gideon he started his army wait he didn't even start his army he's like many christians today it takes a lot of proof especially in this day and age you know in a scientific age a way we think is just like hey we need to see proof of this stuff happening for us to believe it so gideon is exactly the same way he's minded the same way we are so uh he has a visitation from the lord and let me just speed through his story so he tests the visitation of the lord in order to make sure that he was really called and then when the lord told him hey go down tear down that idol in the middle of the city he runs out and he waits till it's the cover of night now let's say if we had a visitation of the lord like god came down in a dream or an angel came and spoke to you or something super spiritual happened to you would you try testing him like i i would test it by the word yes and make sure it's an actual experience but i wouldn't say hey i wouldn't i don't think i would do what gideon said like but we don't know what we'll do until we're in that situation most of us think that way like hey what gideon did was he had this fleece on the ground he had god like make it wet around the fleece but leave the fleas dry then he switched it around and had it done backwards so we tested him like two or three times before he actually accepted his calling then when god told gideon hey go tear down that idol he waits till it's night time and he sneaks over there because he's scared of people coming and giving him some retribution they were just he was just scared that they would come and kill him for tearing down the idol so he sneaks over there does the work and all that stuff but uh eventually he gets where god wants him to be he has the army 32 000 god breaks it down to about 300 men and when he has the 300 men he's still thinking after all of those things that he's seen god bring him through all of those steps that god took him through and proved things over and over again and had so much patience with gideon after all of those things he must have still had some doubt in his heart because god does this so he goes let's pull up judges chapter seven um in verse nine it says and it came to pass the same night keep in mind he only has 300 men and it's like they they have so many enemies they can't even come so i have no no idea how many hundreds of thousands or millions there were it said and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him speaking to gideon arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand but if thou fear to go down go thou with pura thy servant down to the host and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then when he down with fury his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host and the medianites and the malachites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley these are all their enemies like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number their camels were without number not even soldiers or horses or any other thing they were without number as the sand by the sea for multitude and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said and this is keep in mind this is god just showing gideon what his enemies think about him it's going to change the entire situation told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel and into his hand have god delivered midian and all the hosts so he also has this enemy come and testify on gideon's behalf so if you realize that your enemy thinks so highly of you that he's running scared it could change your whole life situation just accept the word the way god wanted you to accept the word and every step that you take in life it's super important to consult it if you can honestly not everything like hey do i go to burger king or taco bell after this now don't have to test it there you don't have to search the word for that but if there's a spiritual question there's a spiritual answer there's a spiritual path that god has for you in your life make sure to test it i don't really know how long i've been speaking but i'm almost done so let me just keep going i just want to ask you do you whenever you're whenever you doubt yourself do you automatically think the devil's lying to you because i want to ask you who's lying to who are you just lying to yourself it could be you just testifying on behalf of the devil and that would bring you down a peg the devil sometimes just sits back and sees what you're going to think and it's often the wrong thing if you let him if you let him lower your opinion of yourself and don't realize that you're a chosen child of god and that you're an elected seed if you let him if you let him have you forget that then it's going to go badly for you if god wants you up here just look at the look at the back of the book and realize that god has such a high opinion of you that he will not let you fail ultimately he he he wants the best for you to seek his will he knows how to get you there and as young people there's so many decisions we have to make and it's just it can be hard and honestly a lot of the decisions we make are sometimes harder than previous generations because the world gets harder and harder to live in and so many choices we have to make choices that we've never they never had to deal with and it's just going to get worse from here we need to be stronger as a generation because our kids need to be strengthened too they need to be strengthened in the word they need to live off of our testimony and understand that god has a place for us to reach to and i believe in that i believe in his word i believe what it tells me about me it says you're the sinless spotless bride of jesus christ i believe all of this let me read some brother branham quotes because i don't want people to get nervous i only read from the bible this whole time uh let's see what here is now elijah 1959 wait uh yeah let's read that one he says i went oh dear it says he says i want to tell you what happened in closing i've never said what happened he's testifying and he's going to tell you why he's testifying like this he says i don't want to say it i won't say it because satan can't get it as long as it's in my heart god lives there but if i speak it he will hear it and he will block every road got to realize satan's not all that powerful this quote tells me look satan can't read your mind he doesn't know what your next steps going to be he's going to notice that you came here and you heard the word but he doesn't know what you're going to do with it so he's going to throw everything he has at you because you don't know doesn't know if you're going to accept it or deny it he's going to try to block it from getting into your heart he's going to block you from receiving it just open your heart to what god has not because i'm talking i'm not saying listen to me i'm saying listen to what god is saying maybe it's not your favorite way to hear it in a sermon or anything like that but just try to try to receive it just open your heart whatever god's leading you to do just do it take his take his will i'll finish it off with the church age book revelation section it says it exposes satan he's talking about his word says it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army he knows what you're going to be if you accept god's word musicians can come back i thank you for listening to me today i thank god for putting this on my heart i mean i couldn't have come up with this myself i was just my mind was blown just looking at what god what god can show you if you open your mind to it your heart to it to receive just seeing that the devil he he's just got a bag of tricks and he's not that he's not powerful at all all he can do is lie to you that's his only power it's just lying and you can accept it every night let's pray heavenly father i thank you for helping me today to speak to these your children lord jesus i uh i may have botched up the work lord but you know you know how it needs to get across to their hearts lord you know what they'll take out of it even if it's just a little bit lord we trust that you had something for them today lord jesus if it's a lot praise your name lord if it's a little we're also grateful for that also for the rest of the weekend lord we we're humbly asking that you please show us more of you lord to change us for the better we don't want to be we don't want to leave here more hypocritical than when we came in worse people we we come here to to be bettered by you lord to be encouraged by you to to seek your will and your wisdom lord jesus if you if you speak through the minister the song leader even the person introducing or doing a prayer requests or anything like that if you want to speak through any of them we invite you lord we we trust your decision lord just help us to receive make us willing servants to be used and to to to pull on the gifts that are around us lord jesus we ask that you take us through the rest of the day and keep us safe as we go home or to any further activities lord just take care of us and walk us through we want to walk in your perfect lord we don't want to let the devil get us derailed and take us off to the wrong direction lord we want to we want what you want lord jesus please take care of us guide our every step lord please help those who are returning home keep them safe on the road and make them ready to receive the word tomorrow however you would have to give it to us we ask you in jesus name [Music] that amen [Music] jesus lord jesus [Music] lord jesus keep me true lord jesus keep me true [Music] big trees [Music] amen we truly thank god for the grace of god we appreciate our brother aaron amen and uh brother caleb i didn't call your name because when i got up here i'd forgotten it but i truly enjoyed both of those songs in which you sang uh we appreciate everything that god has done today and i trust that the young people got the understanding of what was being said um and and so bringing out the way satan's uh where in satan's way of thinking i believe god was just basically trying to point out to you that you should be careful on how you're thinking because we want the mind of christ in us and we want to think in the way that god wants us to think satan in the way he thinks always benefits him he sees something out of it that he can get if he could if if his way of of thinking is correct we we know that satan don't all don't always tell lies sometimes he tells the truth but in telling that truth he has something to benefit from it and one thing for certain when we um we are servants of the lord brother branham talks about this and tell us about the message and calls us a special class of people and as our brother aaron ended the message today he basically tried to tell you that you are everything god says that you are you should never be little yourself you should never think that you're less some of the things that we have to suffer and go through in this life has been ordained by god but understand you that those people those things that we go through makes us special in the eyes of god and so i want to say by god's grace that i truly enjoyed the word but i want to always encourage this young brother i don't know how old you are but i want to encourage you that whenever you go to preach wherever you go to preach just be mindful that you don't have to care about what the people think [Music] keep your eyes on jesus and if you know god has given you a message you just give it the way he gives it you don't have you know what i'm saying i'm just encouraging you because i've been there sometimes you want to preach and you also want to want the people to accept it but some messages are not going to be accepted but as long as you know god gave it to you you only have the one one thing that you need to do is to preach it the way he wants you to preach it let it fall well it falls you know as long as you please the one in the balcony that's fine the way i like so i enjoyed it praise the lord i was listening intensely you know because i our brother was really uh trying to show you how god is really trying to deal with us and as young people you gotta have the holy ghost there's no way that you can have the mind of god satan will do you every time with his logic and his reasoning if you don't know the will of god and that was the reason why uh and i'm not preaching i'm just saying it's just just uh when um when when jesus knowing the will of god knew that satan's interpretation of the word was not correct and that's the only way that you're going to know the will of god when satan's satan will bring the word to you sometimes but you got to know the day you got to know the placing of the word you got to know the hour that you're living in you got to know what god is doing for you in that day so i trusted you was blessed today i was blessed because it just added another dimension to in the way i think or the way i see satan moving i mean so we trust that the lord blessed each and every one of you um i trust i won't be here sunday morning brother but there'll be a lot more people here than than they are today and uh just let go and let god because i tell you what i people don't understand how difficult it is to be a preacher sometimes i'm churning so bad on the inside i don't even know how i live or stand because my nerves are so wrecked and this is all the time it never stops some days it's worse than others but uh i do understand i do understand like i said you know you're coming to a new place you know but that was good don't get me wrong i'm not saying it wasn't i'm saying i enjoy what god had to say but i want you to be encouraging and i want you to know that you're looking at the man in the balcony that's all that matters you're looking at him to see whether he nods or not and as long as he knows yes it's okay you're fine because sometimes i go to come to preach sometime and you don't get no no no emotions you know people look at you and they stare and they don't they you know they they don't even holly nod you know it's okay because the word is the sword the word penetrates even in times we don't think it's getting beyond it is so we enjoyed you brother we thank god for all that god has done and we're asking our brother so i won't talk too much i'm a preacher and i'm trying i'm not trying to take away i'm trying to add to if that you understand what i'm saying appreciate what god gave you today because this was ordained for you and i trust that you heard what he said today you know if not get the tape and go back over it amen that was surely a blessing how many were blessed this morning i really liked the way he was bringing out things and saw scriptures from another point of view i'd never seen before no i was i was just thinking the whole course of the world was changed because eve decided to say the word according to satan's point of view and everything got transformed [Music] and this was the devil quoting the word to eve you know satan is not your friend no matter how good looking you know how sugarcoated it is it's rotten in the middle so when satan tries to come to you to point you to the word no there's nothing good coming out of it it's just a is temptation distraction to you so if the whole course of the world could change by one person looking at the word at satan's point of view what more power and what more can you and me do when we look at the word just like the pastor said with the mind of christ instead of looking at it but satan's point of view we look at it at god's point of view it says let the mind that was in christ be in you and then psalm says as a man think it in his heart so is he so if you start thinking like christ and seeing things like christ you'll be able to do what he did you'll be able to overcome overcome satan's way of view just like jesus did overcome satan's temptation the way he tempted jesus to try to turn stones into bread he overcame that because he kept what god was telling him he kept looking at the word the way god had amen that was just so good i i enjoyed it i mean god bless you brother aaron thank you so much driving all the way nine hours here that was a blessing looking forward to tomorrow man let's just sing this one one more time keep me true
