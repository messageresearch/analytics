[56:39] [Music]
[56:41] you have your Bibles we're going to look
[56:43] here in the Book of John
[56:47] first chapter first verse
[56:52] and I want to speak to you
[56:55] by the way
[56:57] on the word will bring forth
[57:03] so notice the word will bring forth
[57:06] after his cast
[57:11] in space
[57:13] John 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[57:16] and the Word was with God and the Word
[57:18] was God
[57:22] the same was in the beginning with God
[57:26] verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and
[57:30] drought among us
[57:33] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[57:36] only begotten of the father full of
[57:37] grace and truth
[57:44] let's pray father
[57:46] we come before your throne of mercy and
[57:49] Grace this morning Lord
[57:51] thank you for the opportunity you've
[57:54] given us father
[57:56] to come in your presence
[57:58] and we pray that you will speak to his
[58:01] father this morning
[58:07] not our ears that we may hear this
[58:10] morning he could pass
[58:13] what the spirit will have to be said
[58:27] you can have your seats this morning
[58:33] so we find in John 1 and verse 1.
[58:36] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[58:39] word
[58:41] and the Word was with God
[58:44] and the Word was gone
[58:47] so let's go back to the beginning
[58:49] and find out about this so we go to
[58:53] Genesis 1 and verse 11.
[58:57] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[59:00] grass and Herb building seed
[59:08] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[59:11] his kind whose seed is in itself upon
[59:14] the Earth and it was so
[59:16] much
[59:21] and the Earth brought forth grass and
[59:23] Herb yielding seed after his kind and
[59:26] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[59:28] in itself after his kind and God saw
[59:31] that it was good
[59:36] it is
[59:41] verse 20 you will see and God said let
[59:45] the waters bring forth abundantly the
[59:47] moving creature that has lies the foul
[59:50] that may fly above the Earth in upon the
[59:52] firming of the heaven and God created
[59:54] the wells and every living creature that
[59:56] moveth which the waters brought forth
[59:58] abundantly after their kind and every
[1:00:01] winged foul after his kind and and God
[1:00:04] saw that it was good
[1:00:08] results
[1:00:24] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:00:27] the living creature after his kind
[1:00:29] cattle and creeping thing and beast of
[1:00:31] the earth after his kind and it was so
[1:00:34] this is
[1:00:42] and God made the Beast of the earth
[1:00:44] after his kind and the cattle after
[1:00:46] their kind and everything they creepeth
[1:00:48] upon the Earth after his kind and God
[1:00:51] saw that it was good Jews
[1:00:59] so we find God here creating
[1:01:03] and everything came forth after their
[1:01:05] kind
[1:01:07] but God has yet to create the most
[1:01:10] important aspect of his creation
[1:01:16] verse 26. we got seven seas God said let
[1:01:19] us make man in our image
[1:01:22] after our likeness
[1:01:25] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:01:27] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:01:29] and over the cattle and over the Earth
[1:01:31] and over every creeping thing that
[1:01:32] creepeth upon the Earth
[1:01:39] so God created man in his own image in
[1:01:42] the image of God God created he him male
[1:01:44] and female created heed them
[1:01:53] so we go back to the the exposition of
[1:01:55] the church ages brother Branham tells us
[1:01:59] in the beginning was the word
[1:02:02] and that word there translates to a a to
[1:02:07] the word logos
[1:02:11] it means a thought or a Concepts
[1:02:15] it also means a thought or a speech
[1:02:20] so an adult that's expressed is a word
[1:02:23] correct
[1:02:25] and brother Ram says now John says that
[1:02:28] the concept of God was expressed in
[1:02:30] Jesus
[1:02:35] so in the beginning
[1:02:37] was the concept of God
[1:02:40] in the beginning
[1:02:42] what's the thoughts of God
[1:02:45] in the beginning
[1:02:47] God was in the form of creation or the
[1:02:50] Act of Creation look like
[1:02:53] so in the beginning
[1:02:55] you were there you were there
[1:03:01] in the beginning before your trial
[1:03:05] before the sickness before the hurts
[1:03:09] before the disappointment you were there
[1:03:13] you were in the beginning
[1:03:18] God is gonna bring forth
[1:03:21] what is God bringing foreign
[1:03:44] hey man so we find here
[1:03:48] we come to Jesus to logos
[1:03:53] he was the perfect and complete thought
[1:03:56] Express and he became known as the word
[1:04:03] that's what he is
[1:04:06] and forever will be
[1:04:08] so God said
[1:04:11] let us
[1:04:13] lesser make man
[1:04:16] in our image
[1:04:18] oh God dwelt Alone in the eternities
[1:04:29] you were in his mind
[1:04:31] you become a word spoken in this hour
[1:04:36] said let us create
[1:04:39] man in our image
[1:04:42] let me tell you this morning Brothers
[1:04:45] this is
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:32] this morning
[1:05:39] let's go to Ephesians in chapter one and
[1:05:42] verse three
[1:05:45] says blessed be the God and father of
[1:05:48] our Lord Jesus Christ notice who hath
[1:05:50] blessed us with
[1:05:53] Allah
[1:05:58] not a portion
[1:06:01] not a peace
[1:06:03] some people they got a portion of it oh
[1:06:05] yeah
[1:06:09] just a small piece but we hear and Paul
[1:06:13] is telling us
[1:06:14] that he has blessed us
[1:06:17] with all spiritual blessings
[1:06:20] so can we look at this just for a minute
[1:06:23] he says now we are in Christ we have
[1:06:26] spiritual blessings
[1:06:28] foreign Spirit trailer outside of Christ
[1:06:31] we have Sensations
[1:06:34] in Christ we have positive blessings not
[1:06:37] make believe the the Christians
[1:06:40] not Shams and put ons
[1:06:44] he says but as long as you're trying to
[1:06:47] say that you're in the promised land
[1:06:50] and you're not your sins will find you
[1:06:53] out
[1:06:55] the first thing you know you'll find out
[1:06:57] yourself a phony
[1:07:02] you'll find out that you're not what
[1:07:04] you're talking about
[1:07:07] but when you're in Christ
[1:07:11] he's promised you Heavenly places
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:27] you're in the promised land and in full
[1:07:30] possession of everything
[1:07:34] so he's blessed us with all spiritual
[1:07:37] blessings
[1:07:40] so the same Holy Ghost a fell on the day
[1:07:43] of Pentecost
[1:07:45] it's here this morning
[1:07:48] you can't separate it
[1:07:51] the same response on Pentacles
[1:07:56] the same emotions that came at Pentecost
[1:08:19] because he was determined I'm gonna
[1:08:22] bring forth
[1:08:26] are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:08:30] and though I went through seven Church
[1:08:32] ages

[1:08:40] said we are here
[1:08:44] that bride is here we're not manifesting
[1:08:47] our own ideas

[1:08:59] Mary shout and speak in tongues
[1:09:02] and have a wonderful time
[1:09:07] it's the same Holy Ghost here this
[1:09:10] morning
[1:09:11] so if it can make Mary shout I don't see

[1:14:24] but one day
[1:14:29] brother's coming up
[1:14:34] Eternal thoughts of God
[1:14:38] see his word can no more die than he can
[1:14:41] die
[1:14:44] that's why in the beginning
[1:14:46] John said what's the word
[1:14:50] put yourself back there in the beginning
[1:14:56] shake off what happened to you last week
[1:15:03] oh don't worry about tomorrow
[1:15:20] and I'm looking at the family again
[1:15:25] every seed had to bring forth of its
[1:15:28] cars
[1:15:30] and God has brought forth and God is
[1:15:33] bringing foreign
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:50] the only one
[1:15:54] yeah
[1:15:57] experience
[1:16:11] where are you with the truth come on Joe
[1:16:15] where are you we're the sons of God
[1:16:18] hallelujah
[1:16:51] so that you can bring foreign
[1:17:00] all right
[1:17:05] glory to God
[1:17:07] it's all right this morning
[1:17:11] oh praise the Lord Roger
[1:17:14] C program says
[1:17:16] Amanda is born of the spirit of God
[1:17:20] and then he becomes in the image of god
[1:17:25] notice where it takes place
[1:17:32] down into the heart into the soul and
[1:17:35] then from there
[1:17:37] your life begins to materialize this
[1:17:41] word
[1:17:42] that's why you can't smoke another
[1:17:43] cigarette
[1:17:49] men dress like women women dresses
[1:17:58] and the word can only produce
[1:18:05] summer oh
[1:18:19] let me foreign
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:19:27] foreign
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:20:04] means that light will produce light
[1:20:09] so species are fixed
[1:20:14] you can't breathe a banana with a human
[1:20:20] let me say it like this
[1:20:22] you can't breed denominational believer
[1:20:25] with The Real Son of God
[1:20:29] because the word can only bring forth of
[1:20:33] the words
[1:20:36] see God created every species distinct
[1:20:39] from one another
[1:20:43] one so the the theory of evolution
[1:20:48] it's the nod right there see we're all
[1:20:51] different
[1:20:53] our species are different
[1:20:55] and God said it 10 times in Genesis 1.
[1:21:00] everything produces
[1:21:03] are increases
[1:21:12] so if you plant corn
[1:21:15] you don't expect to get bananas dude
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:22] I said what do you get
[1:21:24] all right so if you plant mangoes
[1:21:28] you get what
[1:21:30] a dog will produce what
[1:21:35] God producer
[1:21:38] if it has to stay there and the human
[1:21:40] can produce a human yeah
[1:21:59] see God can't change
[1:22:04] times may change
[1:22:07] society may change
[1:22:09] but this word
[1:22:12] I said this word
[1:22:14] Remains the Same
[1:22:19] so life comes from the seeds
[1:22:24] let's just look at this for a few
[1:22:26] minutes this morning
[1:22:29] every seeds carries within it
[1:22:34] all the potentials and the promise of
[1:22:37] what it can become
[1:22:42] see it carries the Prototype
[1:22:45] of what it will be so you can take a
[1:22:49] young man
[1:22:50] and you can look at his father yo we got
[1:22:52] this one and you can say well that is
[1:22:54] gonna become that
[1:22:57] because that seed of the father
[1:23:02] and so the attributes in the sun
[1:23:06] attributes of the father
[1:23:10] prepare
[1:23:12] carries within it
[1:23:15] all the information
[1:23:17] that it needs to grow
[1:23:21] complete healthy human it was
[1:23:25] something a healthy plant
[1:23:29] or a healthy animals
[1:23:32] so take an apple seed
[1:23:36] you planted in the ground
[1:23:38] and what happens
[1:23:40] an apple tree grows but that's not the
[1:23:44] end of the Apple Store
[1:23:45] no you keep watering it foreign
[1:24:24] uh
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:14] keep applying the words
[1:25:16] you keep pouring on the spirit don't you
[1:25:18] know obviously do this please I say one
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:22] in the right atmosphere
[1:25:30] looks like it was dead if Memphis
[1:25:40] ah the spirit of God
[1:25:48] so if you plant an apple seed
[1:25:52] and it produces apples
[1:25:56] let's think about a human for a minute
[1:25:59] the Bible says that you are created in
[1:26:03] the image of God because
[1:26:07] now look at your neighbor
[1:26:09] that's God
[1:26:12] some of you went
[1:26:16] but that's gone Missy Drew you were
[1:26:19] created in His image
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:31] this morning
[1:26:34] but you are in the image of God
[1:26:38] his likeness
[1:26:42] it's off to see that God is inside of
[1:26:45] you I don't see that
[1:26:47] everything that God is
[1:26:53] every attribute that's in the mind of
[1:26:56] God
[1:27:01] oh think about this for a minute
[1:27:05] you are created
[1:27:08] in the image of God
[1:27:10] you are the highest form of God's
[1:27:14] creation
[1:27:17] some of you think you're just a mass of
[1:27:19] Flesh
[1:27:21] you're just occupying a seat
[1:27:26] but you're not here by accident
[1:27:29] you're not here by mistake
[1:27:32] you're here because the word has called
[1:27:34] you to be this is
[1:27:40] to be right here in Iowa this morning
[1:28:01] let your word be formed in me
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:11] Hallelujah
[1:28:13] every trait
[1:28:15] secretary
[1:28:17] that was in the father
[1:28:19] I'm a father
[1:28:21] that's my son stand up son left while
[1:28:25] peace handsome young man
[1:28:29] so all that is in me
[1:28:32] is in him
[1:28:35] then we don't look alike
[1:28:38] we don't look alike
[1:28:40] but we had the same mannerisms
[1:28:47] so every trait
[1:28:50] that's in the father
[1:28:59] the color of your eyes
[1:29:02] the complexion of your skin
[1:29:05] how tall you are
[1:29:08] tired how short you are
[1:29:14] how much hair you have
[1:29:17] um
[1:29:22] your makeup uh
[1:29:31] okay
[1:29:32] we're moving out
[1:29:34] your personality
[1:29:37] personality whether you're mean
[1:29:40] whether you're sweet
[1:29:43] whether you're loving because
[1:29:48] whether you're a driven
[1:29:50] Persona
[1:29:52] or whether you're a lazy person
[1:29:55] is all in the seed
[1:30:00] seeing if that's in the natural
[1:30:04] what about the spirit
[1:30:07] if that's in the natural
[1:30:09] and your Offspring
[1:30:13] can't produce you
[1:30:16] can produce your same makeup
[1:30:20] can produce your same mannerisms
[1:30:23] can produce your same traits
[1:30:27] then what about when the mind of God
[1:30:29] comes down
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:41] in the father
[1:30:43] healing was in the father
[1:30:47] oh long suffering
[1:31:00] amen so we find
[1:31:04] that the seed has life
[1:31:08] but in this hour
[1:31:10] the seed's been hybrid
[1:31:13] and we find that Eve
[1:31:17] she had the original word
[1:31:20] but she took a lot of the enemy
[1:31:24] and when she did she hybrid the seeds
[1:31:33] the word hybrid here
[1:31:36] it means an offspring of two animals or
[1:31:39] plants
[1:31:43] a different subspecies
[1:31:48] so you got a donkey
[1:31:52] and you got a horse
[1:31:56] so you have a donkey
[1:31:59] and you have a horse
[1:32:03] and it produces a mule
[1:32:07] um
[1:32:27] and so what I'm telling you this morning
[1:32:30] the denominational seed is
[1:32:40] it can breed itself back to the original
[1:32:43] word
[1:32:45] but because you come from the original
[1:32:47] word
[1:32:49] because you are that original word
[1:32:53] you're gonna bring forth original words
[1:32:57] your life is going to produce the words
[1:33:01] that's why you can say Amen this morning
[1:33:04] that's why you can jump this morning
[1:33:07] that's why you can shout this morning
[1:33:19] and it's coming forth
[1:33:22] now brother Brown tells us
[1:33:24] that the first heartbreaking took place
[1:33:27] in Genesis 3.
[1:33:31] when he believed the LIE of the
[1:33:33] serpenter foreign
[1:33:43] but he didn't have a place for a soul
[1:33:47] even though he was a distinct different
[1:33:49] species he was still a man
[1:33:55] and brother bam tells us
[1:33:58] that Satan mixed his he came down into
[1:34:01] the serpenter
[1:34:03] and he mixed his seed with the human
[1:34:06] race
[1:34:10] the Bible tells us that he was the most
[1:34:14] subtle Rose
[1:34:20] um
[1:34:21] cunning
[1:34:26] wisdom
[1:34:31] he was right next to man
[1:34:35] the most subtle of all the beasts of the
[1:34:38] fields
[1:34:41] tells us he goes I went and I got the
[1:34:45] dictionaries
[1:34:46] and I wanted to see what the word subtle
[1:34:49] meant
[1:34:51] it means to be smart
[1:34:54] it means to be crafty
[1:34:58] um
[1:35:00] but the best interpretation is
[1:35:03] the Hebrew word m-a-h-a-h-
[1:35:14] and it means having a true knowledge of
[1:35:18] the principles of life
[1:35:23] so Satan had the true knowledge
[1:35:27] but the principles of life
[1:35:30] he knew how those others brought forth
[1:35:34] life
[1:35:36] and so he introduced this
[1:35:40] Concepts however
[1:35:43] but he was supposed to
[1:35:46] bring forth
[1:35:48] of the spoken word
[1:35:52] but she listened to the lie
[1:35:55] and anytime you listen to the lies
[1:35:58] it brings death
[1:36:01] so we find the serpent was so close to
[1:36:04] man
[1:36:06] that Satan interjected
[1:36:10] with one purpose
[1:36:13] cut the sea line off
[1:36:17] cut that sea lion off
[1:36:20] see Satan was there
[1:36:22] when God said let us make man in our
[1:36:26] image
[1:36:27] Satan was there and he knew that God had
[1:36:31] desires to have a family
[1:36:34] so in order he knew he could not create
[1:36:38] but he had the possession to pervert he
[1:36:42] is doing
[1:37:03] man wants to be a woman
[1:37:07] want to be men
[1:37:10] children want to be cats the
[1:37:17] and the sad part brother
[1:37:20] if there's been laws that are passed
[1:37:25] that protect these desires
[1:37:29] you can't tell that child
[1:37:32] that he's not a dog
[1:37:37] that he's not a dog
[1:37:40] even though he looks like a man
[1:37:43] looks like a boy
[1:37:45] talks like a boy walks like a boy but
[1:37:50] he's identified himself
[1:37:54] and that their laws being passed for
[1:37:57] that is
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:35] the word has called you in this house
[1:38:39] you're only coming to manifest
[1:38:43] foreign
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:39:08] yeah
[1:39:09] this is on the cup okay and 31 states
[1:39:12] have passed laws
[1:39:16] to allow Force sterilizations
[1:39:20] notice what Satan is also done
[1:39:23] he's propagated the transgender movement
[1:39:27] so it's one thing for the homosexual
[1:39:30] movement
[1:39:33] but the homosexual can repent
[1:39:36] and he can straighten his life for her
[1:39:39] life up
[1:39:41] and they can live with the opposite
[1:39:44] sexual position but the transgender
[1:39:47] they undergo they undergo surgeries and
[1:39:51] hormone therapies to change their gender
[1:39:54] all together
[1:39:59] this causes
[1:40:01] realization
[1:40:02] sterilization there's no way to bring
[1:40:05] forth the seed at that point
[1:40:08] is
[1:40:15] even young children
[1:40:18] can decide what gender they want to be
[1:40:23] um
[1:40:26] so ignoring the natural parts of their
[1:40:28] body
[1:40:30] they can choose what they want to be
[1:40:34] it's in an effort it's only four
[1:40:38] to destroy the sea lion
[1:40:41] see Satan has established also the use
[1:40:44] of pronouns
[1:40:47] where we would say him and her
[1:40:51] now instead them and theirs is
[1:40:57] this is the hour in which we're living
[1:41:01] see that seed can't bring forth
[1:41:05] constantly die
[1:41:08] but the word
[1:41:10] I said but the word
[1:41:13] that's why you're here you're not
[1:41:16] bringing forth
[1:41:19] but you are bringing forth him and she
[1:41:23] Louis
[1:41:25] because when God created man
[1:41:29] he created them
[1:41:32] male and female
[1:41:35] God calls a distinction
[1:41:39] and that word is still in effect today
[1:41:44] right
[1:41:47] that's right
[1:41:50] well the BAM says in the spoken words
[1:41:52] the original scene
[1:41:55] what was he
[1:41:58] talking about God found on the jury he
[1:42:01] made himself a man
[1:42:04] God was made flesh
[1:42:08] and throughout the Mungus
[1:42:11] the word was made flesh
[1:42:16] God's spoken word through a virgin
[1:42:21] brought forth a body is
[1:42:26] and that body come it's according the
[1:42:30] water the spirit is
[1:42:33] Washed by the Water of the word
[1:42:37] and then went into him
[1:42:40] dwelt in him
[1:42:42] and there come the life of God
[1:42:44] manifesting himself through Christ
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:49] see God was in Christ
[1:42:55] means the anointed one a man that was
[1:42:59] anointed and God was dwelling in him
[1:43:03] he said what was it the germ with the
[1:43:07] flesh
[1:43:08] dollar share the anointed one Lua the
[1:43:12] flesh being Anointed with the spirit of
[1:43:14] God
[1:43:17] um
[1:43:19] produced the word that God May manifest
[1:43:24] and we beheld him
[1:43:27] they only begotten of the father full of
[1:43:30] grace and truth
[1:43:33] so the word is a seed
[1:43:35] but as long as it lays here
[1:43:41] see but when it comes down into here
[1:43:45] then it begins to manifest
[1:43:47] by the Holy Spirit by The Works of God
[1:43:51] and when he comes in here then Visions
[1:43:55] come then power comes
[1:44:00] can you get past all your no- at all
[1:44:04] you become nothing
[1:44:06] and Christ becomes alive in you
[1:44:10] you died he lives
[1:44:14] I said you die and he lives
[1:44:18] see he died that I may live
[1:44:21] and he lives again brother sister
[1:44:24] he's living right here in Des Moines
[1:44:27] Iowa he's living right here in your lane
[1:44:30] your flesh
[1:44:31] he's living in your life
[1:44:34] in your home in your school on your job
[1:44:39] because he is manifesting himself
[1:44:42] through you
[1:44:44] and notice what the word says Romans 8
[1:44:48] 11.
[1:44:50] but that the spirit of him that raised
[1:44:53] up Jesus
[1:45:01] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:45:03] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:45:08] by the spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:45:12] see God made his first bride ground
[1:45:17] this is in the message the rising of the
[1:45:19] signs
[1:45:20] he was both man and woman
[1:45:25] in spirit he formed him in the dust of
[1:45:29] the earth
[1:45:31] to make him material
[1:45:35] notice
[1:45:37] he took not another piece of clay
[1:45:44] but he took the same piece of clay the
[1:45:47] mems of the darzilla and what he done in
[1:45:50] the beginning
[1:45:51] he does it again in the end
[1:45:55] he doesn't take another piece or another
[1:45:58] human
[1:46:00] he takes us the same aspect
[1:46:04] he be in the bridegroom
[1:46:06] you be in the bride
[1:46:09] you come from God and if you come from
[1:46:13] God we're going back to God so it
[1:46:17] doesn't matter what we go through down
[1:46:19] here
[1:46:21] we know where we're going Hallelujah
[1:46:26] he says so the bride must also be flesh
[1:46:30] of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:38] then how is this mortal flesh going to
[1:46:41] become his flesh
[1:46:44] because the same spirit that was in him
[1:46:48] quickens us
[1:46:50] quickens the seed on the inside
[1:46:54] it produces him
[1:46:57] the Bible says in John 1 and verse 12.
[1:47:02] but as many as received him
[1:47:05] to them gave he the power to become sons
[1:47:08] of God
[1:47:11] even to them that believed on his name
[1:47:16] notice verse 13.
[1:47:19] which were born
[1:47:22] which were born was it me not a blood no
[1:47:26] do song nor the will of Flesh
[1:47:28] nor the will of man
[1:47:31] but of God
[1:47:33] oh Church the scripture is playing
[1:47:38] but the spirit doesn't Quicken every
[1:47:41] seeds
[1:47:44] it only quickens that predestinated sins
[1:47:50] it only quickens those
[1:47:54] that were in the thoughts of God
[1:47:57] see the spirit was sent to Quicken those
[1:48:01] seeds hey
[1:48:14] like to see laid upon the Earth
[1:48:19] the one that had life in them
[1:48:23] he said many of them were dead
[1:48:28] Waters and things burnt them out
[1:48:32] he said but you know there was a sea
[1:48:35] laying there ready for life
[1:48:39] and God knows that it was there
[1:48:43] but the predestinated ones
[1:48:46] are the ones to be quick
[1:48:50] see the sun
[1:48:53] went across the Earth
[1:48:57] not to bring rocks
[1:49:00] not to bring the dirt
[1:49:04] but to bring that part of the dirt which
[1:49:07] was enclosed around that life
[1:49:12] says not all men will receive Christ
[1:49:17] but those that were which were which
[1:49:20] were God foreign
[1:49:25] he quickens them
[1:49:28] now the dirt will lay there
[1:49:32] and it will say
[1:49:34] the sun is too hot
[1:49:38] The Rock will lay there
[1:49:44] oh the sun is too hot
[1:49:48] but right next
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:22] she said that's exactly what I need
[1:50:26] that's exactly what I want
[1:50:32] Church foreign
[1:51:32] thank you
[1:51:35] Sister Crystal think about it
[1:51:37] look back over your life
[1:51:40] he had every reason to quit
[1:51:42] every reason to throw your hands up
[1:51:46] oh but there was a seed that was
[1:51:48] deposited on the inside
[1:51:50] temperature you don't have enough Diablo
[1:52:02] you're getting the atmosphere right
[1:52:06] now you're here today
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:16] yeah
[1:52:17] amen God sent us a message
[1:52:20] and this message is Christopher
[1:52:24] and what is it doing it's quick and easy
[1:52:29] it's quickening predestinated
[1:52:38] mother says why won't all people receive
[1:52:41] it
[1:52:43] because I wasn't sent to them
[1:52:48] some of y'all need to just pick your
[1:52:51] back up
[1:52:53] and realize who you are
[1:52:56] you ate the trotting down
[1:52:59] absolutely
[1:53:00] see you're not to defeated
[1:53:03] no but you are the predestinated sons
[1:53:07] and daughters of God
[1:53:19] oh he's the king of a tribe
[1:53:31] [Applause]
[1:53:44] [Applause]
[1:53:49] but it's for you
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:08] on the
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:13] way see it's not meant for everybody
[1:54:17] says the guy told me
[1:54:21] he says I don't believe I don't care
[1:54:23] what you said
[1:54:26] he said you could raise up the dead or
[1:54:29] anything
[1:54:31] heal the sick and prove it anyway
[1:54:35] because I still don't believe it is
[1:54:40] certainly not something you're a
[1:54:43] non-believer It Don't Mean a Thing to
[1:54:46] you
[1:54:47] it wasn't said to you
[1:54:50] isn't to who will believe
[1:54:54] that's why you're here
[1:54:59] that's why you're here
[1:55:03] with so many quit believing and they
[1:55:05] walked away
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:15] here's the word
[1:55:22] it's like an eagle in a chicken yard
[1:55:25] you couldn't eat that mess
[1:55:29] you weren't happy in the Baptist Church
[1:55:38] I said one day
[1:55:41] you heard that eagle screens
[1:55:49] she recognizes
[1:56:22] foreign
[1:56:43] how beautiful
[1:56:45] how beautiful is this message that we
[1:56:48] have coming out Mount View
[1:56:49] he hit it he hit it from the wise
[1:56:55] and he's revealed to babes
[1:56:59] Amen to those that would receive
[1:57:02] to those that had that predestinated
[1:57:07] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:57:12] says predestinated
[1:57:15] there's the mystery
[1:57:17] he before Christ or anything else was on
[1:57:20] the earth
[1:57:24] before he blew the solar systems off his
[1:57:27] hands
[1:57:29] um
[1:57:30] he said you see his great mystery do you
[1:57:33] voice to call me still that he chose the
[1:57:37] bride
[1:57:40] knowing that Eve would fall from
[1:57:42] disbelieving the words
[1:57:49] knowing that she would fall
[1:57:51] but he would choose a bride
[1:57:55] that would not fall
[1:57:58] that would hold you that word
[1:58:02] regardless of what the rest of the world
[1:58:04] had to say about it
[1:58:06] they hold to the word
[1:58:09] they are predestinated to stand there
[1:58:13] to the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:58:16] Christ
[1:58:18] predestinated the church to that great
[1:58:21] glorious stance
[1:58:25] don't you see today Church
[1:58:47] and that's the mystery
[1:58:50] you're the mystery that is now being
[1:58:52] unfolded
[1:58:55] um
[1:58:56] Christ is the word and taking the word
[1:59:01] and making up his church see
[1:59:04] you bring himself again
[1:59:10] Redeemed by the blood that was come from
[1:59:12] his body notice
[1:59:15] bringing forth a prize
[1:59:20] that came from his own body
[1:59:25] so what happened in the pre-figure now
[1:59:28] he says
[1:59:30] he opened up Adam's side
[1:59:33] and he took part of his flesh yes
[1:59:40] he says now the bride has to be the
[1:59:43] words
[1:59:44] because he is
[1:59:47] she cannot stand on Creeds
[1:59:52] she cannot stand on the nomination
[1:59:56] she cannot stand on good behavior
[2:00:01] she has to stand alone on the word
[2:00:04] because she is part of it
[2:00:08] she was taken from Christ
[2:00:13] now we find in Matthew 24 and verse 24.
[2:00:16] Maybe
[2:00:20] much longer
[2:00:24] Matthew 24 and verse 24.
[2:00:27] for there shall arise false Christ
[2:00:32] and false prophets and they should show
[2:00:35] great signs and wonders
[2:00:38] and so much that
[2:00:40] if it were possible
[2:00:43] they shall deceive the very elected
[2:00:47] now brother Brown says in the church age
[2:00:50] he said that the true church
[2:00:54] would always try to be like it was in
[2:00:56] the book of Acts
[2:01:03] that's why we dance
[2:01:07] because we're just we're just emulating
[2:01:10] what the first church did this wouldn't
[2:01:14] be something we staggered out of High
[2:01:16] Ground Tabernacle this morning
[2:01:19] why
[2:01:44] he said we have discovered that the word
[2:01:46] also teaches
[2:01:49] an invasion of error until there is a
[2:01:52] complete blackout of Truth in the last
[2:01:54] day uh
[2:02:16] oh no account no for the scripture says
[2:02:20] very clearly in Matthew 24
[2:02:24] 24.7
[2:02:27] cannot be deceived
[2:02:32] see notice now the Antichrist
[2:02:36] shall be so close to deceive the very
[2:02:39] elects
[2:02:43] says what is the elected
[2:02:46] he says when that light shines the s-o-n
[2:02:50] or The Sun
[2:02:55] Shines on the seat that's governed by
[2:02:57] botany life
[2:03:03] and when the Son of God Shines
[2:03:08] on that predestinated scene
[2:03:12] it will come to life that quick
[2:03:15] he goes I don't care what state of life
[2:03:17] it's in it is
[2:03:20] might be a prostitute
[2:03:23] might be a drunkard or a gambler
[2:03:27] but it will shine at that minute as soon
[2:03:30] as it strikes him
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:46] foreign
[2:04:48] amen cannot be deceived
[2:04:52] see the real genuine predestinated seed
[2:04:55] will catch the word
[2:05:02] so whenever the light strikes that
[2:05:05] predestined predestinated scene
[2:05:09] um
[2:05:13] oh that's wonderful
[2:05:15] he says you you can't keep it he says
[2:05:24] when that seed is laying there and the
[2:05:26] sun strikes it it went uh
[2:05:30] it will come to life
[2:05:33] and the Son of God is
[2:05:36] the controller of eternal life it is and
[2:05:40] if you got seed of life in you this is
[2:05:44] when the son strikes there and shows you
[2:05:47] that that he is
[2:05:53] there's no way listen there's no way
[2:06:00] come on there's no way to keep that life
[2:06:03] from coming
[2:06:04] as long as you hear the message
[2:06:13] foreign
[2:06:51] odyssip they're all there because they
[2:06:53] had a word
[2:06:56] go wait
[2:06:57] until you've been dude
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:03] so you were doing a gotta work a physio
[2:07:06] card I drew but just imagine the work
[2:07:09] was the seed is quickened
[2:07:12] no more fear of the Romans
[2:07:16] no more fear of the Pharisees and
[2:07:18] Sadducees and religious leaders
[2:07:22] concerned about what they got to give up
[2:07:24] what they gotta lose
[2:07:30] they come stumbling
[2:07:34] they come like a bunch of drunk man
[2:07:38] oh well you know you're drunk oh was it
[2:07:42] evil oh but Peter stood up
[2:07:44] thank God there was a Peter in the Mist
[2:07:48] he didn't look at what was going on yeah
[2:08:03] predestinated
[2:08:20] so no matter where you're planted I pray
[2:08:23] in Baltimore School think about a c just
[2:08:24] for a minute
[2:08:26] where do you see the most grass what's
