[42:12] Gideon brother retief
[42:15] really
[42:17] Gideon um I'm just getting mixed up with
[42:19] this name right now
[42:21] then
[42:24] on Saturday a close friend and
[42:28] precious sister from
[42:31] Guyana died
[42:33] Gideon was on his way to communion and
[42:36] had a massive heart attack
[42:38] my sister and Guyana had a heart attack
[42:42] then on the other day my brother had a
[42:44] heart attack and he's in intensive care
[42:47] and then my cousin died this morning
[42:51] so
[42:54] when you death is all around
[42:59] I have such an assurance
[43:03] I rest in him
[43:06] He's My All In All and
[43:09] there are many people who aren't
[43:11] who are grieving right now
[43:15] who have no hope
[43:17] for those of loved ones that I spoke of
[43:20] they have a hope
[43:22] they truly truly are Christians and
[43:25] I'm sure they're enjoying Jesus right
[43:27] now
[43:29] you love God
[43:32] we thank God for those of you who've
[43:34] been praying for my family we
[43:38] definitely need
[43:40] and I know that my God will
[43:43] do what's necessary
[43:46] even with my brother he
[43:50] 74 years old I believe the Elder
[43:53] all of us and
[43:55] and I have another brother who's
[43:59] close to 70 he's two years older than I
[44:02] am he lives in
[44:05] Columbia South Carolina he's done a
[44:09] these two are the last of the 16 my mom
[44:12] had
[44:13] so
[44:16] by grace
[44:20] let us stand and as we stand now
[44:23] we're going to ask that you turn with
[44:24] two passages of scripture
[44:27] Hebrews 13 and 8.
[44:31] this scripture has become one of my
[44:34] favorite
[44:39] it literally keeps me focused
[44:42] knowing that I serve a God that cannot
[44:44] change
[44:47] and the more I read of him the more I
[44:49] come to love him
[44:52] the more I come to understand him
[44:56] I was talking to my wife even coming to
[44:59] church and I became a Christian you know
[45:02] I didn't know
[45:03] we had to do all of these changings all
[45:07] of these changes would be made
[45:09] you know you baptized in the name of the
[45:11] Lord Jesus Christ
[45:13] nobody had to beat me over the back to
[45:16] speak in tongues I was speaking in
[45:17] tongues by the inspiration of the Holy
[45:19] Spirit and
[45:20] I began to dance and all that it was
[45:23] glorious and I thought well praise God I
[45:25] made it
[45:28] down the road I found out if there's
[45:30] more to it than that
[45:32] they didn't tell us and they didn't
[45:34] teach us that we had to grow into
[45:36] Perfection they didn't tell us that we
[45:38] had to mature they didn't give us
[45:40] promises that was in the word that what
[45:43] God promised for us this last day they
[45:45] didn't give us a vision we stopped
[45:49] right there
[45:51] and whenever you stop you die
[45:55] God is a progressive God he moves
[45:58] forward
[45:59] he's always moving
[46:02] and uh
[46:04] we know by God's grace that as long as
[46:08] we keep moving forward in him
[46:10] uh we'll be okay
[46:12] all right Hebrews 13 and 8 says Jesus
[46:15] Christ the same yesterday and today
[46:20] and forever
[46:22] Saint John 4
[46:25] 23 through 26.
[46:29] we've been working on this
[46:32] these thoughts trying to collect them
[46:35] all together that we may have a vision
[46:37] or see the true image of the Lord Jesus
[46:40] Christ
[46:42] that's so important
[46:44] that while I'm preaching you see Jesus
[46:48] I'm not here to show
[46:50] who I am
[46:52] or
[46:54] how great I am of course you all know
[46:56] better than that but uh
[46:58] we're here to
[46:59] declare Jesus Christ
[47:02] who is the only true and living God
[47:06] Saint John 4 23-26
[47:10] we know the story
[47:12] of the woman at the well
[47:14] and here Jesus is talking to her
[47:18] and we know all the questions and how he
[47:20] discerned her and how he said you know
[47:22] you have five husbands and the one that
[47:25] your six husbands and the one that you
[47:26] have it's not your own
[47:29] um
[47:29] but by the grace of God
[47:33] basically he said you have five and the
[47:36] one that you're living with six is not
[47:37] your own so anyway you know how the
[47:39] scripture goes
[47:42] but he comes to this truth
[47:44] because in that data Samaritans worship
[47:47] God in the mountains and the Jews
[47:49] worship God in Jerusalem
[47:53] but then Jesus comes and he said but the
[47:55] hour cometh and now is when the true
[47:58] worshipers
[48:00] shall worship the father in spirit and
[48:03] in truth I have to keep saying that
[48:05] because basically that's what brother
[48:07] Branham was trying to get us to see
[48:10] we must always remain in the spirit and
[48:13] we must always remain in the truth
[48:15] for the father seeketh such to worship
[48:18] Him
[48:19] God is a spirit
[48:21] and they that worship Him must worship
[48:23] Him in spirit and Truth
[48:26] there is a time when Luther came forth
[48:30] he was Truth for his day
[48:32] but God moved on
[48:35] into the Wesleyan age and they were
[48:37] truth
[48:38] and they left the Lutheran behind so now
[48:41] the Lutheran
[48:43] are now left in darkness because they
[48:46] fail to go forward
[48:49] the wesleyans failed to go on to
[48:51] Pentecost
[48:53] and the Pentecostals failed to come on
[48:55] Into The Headstone or the message of the
[48:57] hour
[48:58] and it works that way even in nature
[49:01] it grows up as a seed come through the
[49:04] the the leaves the chaff you know how it
[49:06] works and then it comes back to the
[49:08] original seed
[49:09] and everything in that whole growth
[49:11] period dies except the seed
[49:15] and so we realize that we're in what we
[49:17] call the seed age
[49:19] the age where God comes into full
[49:21] manifestation in his bride again
[49:25] excuse me the 25th verse excuse me
[49:28] the woman said unto her I know that
[49:31] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[49:34] when he has come he will tell us all
[49:37] things
[49:38] Jesus said unto her I that speak unto
[49:42] thee am he
[49:44] now she said we know when the Messiah
[49:47] cometh which is called Christ
[49:51] the anointed one we know when he comes
[49:55] he's going to tell us all these things
[49:57] and now she's not just working with her
[49:59] his discernment but he's telling her
[50:02] there's a difference there's a change in
[50:04] worship
[50:05] this worship that you once did in the
[50:07] mountains or the worship that the Jews
[50:10] did in Jerusalem will no longer will be
[50:13] accepted
[50:14] if there's a place that God has already
[50:17] designated for worship and the only way
[50:20] that you will be accepted is to worship
[50:22] Him in spirit and in truth
[50:25] you love the Lord
[50:27] let's pray
[50:28] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[50:31] grace
[50:32] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[50:34] for your love divine and we pray father
[50:37] God that you will just let your perfect
[50:39] and divine will be done in our lives
[50:42] without you Jesus we are nothing
[50:45] and Heavenly Father we pray Lord God
[50:48] that you have thine own way
[50:50] we love you Lord we thank you Jesus for
[50:54] all that you do to us and how we praise
[50:57] you for your leadership in your name
[50:59] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[51:02] you may be seated
[51:04] I understand when you come to church you
[51:07] must come to worship
[51:09] it can't be a style if you if you're
[51:11] into a religious way of worshiping
[51:14] you've got to ask God to deliver you or
[51:16] show you uh the right from the wrong
[51:20] we fail to see that when we come into
[51:22] the house of the Lord the house of the
[51:24] Lord is a judgment seat
[51:26] and God will through the spirit the holy
[51:29] spirit will pick up on you
[51:30] and God through the Holy Spirit Will
[51:32] begin to correct you and so we must
[51:36] understand we come for correction
[51:38] but when we enter into this place we're
[51:40] supposed to leave everything behind
[51:43] no matter what you've gone through today
[51:45] let's leave that behind and seek the
[51:49] face of the Lord
[51:51] now my subject tonight will be the power
[51:54] or yeah of Revelation the power of true
[51:59] revelation
[52:00] because remember I said many times when
[52:04] it comes to Christians and we all have
[52:06] at some point in time been LED astray or
[52:09] we've been deceived uh to think that we
[52:12] are in a place that will not uh the
[52:16] greatest thing that could have happened
[52:17] to us is that the word of God came to us
[52:20] in this day uh and by God's grace
[52:23] revealed himself to us
[52:25] outside of that we would be where
[52:27] everybody else is uh basically believing
[52:30] a lie and trusting in a lie and and
[52:33] believing that they're saved when they
[52:35] are not uh we we must understand that
[52:38] this message that we're serving and I
[52:41] can't do it alone I heard brother
[52:43] Branham talk about in on the message uh
[52:46] influence he said no matter he said if
[52:49] Jesus Christ was standing right here
[52:52] amen and wanted to pray and would pray
[52:54] for you he said he could not heal you if
[52:58] you don't believe
[52:59] so if if the Lord himself could stand
[53:02] right here and preach to you it it will
[53:06] be of no avail it would be of no use to
[53:09] you if you don't believe the word that
[53:12] which is being preached the Bible tells
[53:15] us that Jesus is the word in the
[53:17] beginning was the word the word was with
[53:19] God and the Word was God when Jesus died
[53:23] he didn't stay dead you understand me
[53:26] when Jesus died God did not you
[53:29] understand me God can never die he is
[53:32] eternal uh it was the body Jesus that
[53:35] died but that same body had a promise
[53:39] I will not leave your soul in Hell
[53:41] neither will I allow flesh to see
[53:44] corruption and with that promise Jesus
[53:47] rose again upon the third day it wasn't
[53:50] about Jesus let me put it this way it
[53:52] was because the Holy Spirit the father
[53:55] of Jesus the creator of Jesus promised
[53:59] him that he would rise and he wrote he
[54:01] went down into the grave if you want to
[54:04] say it the Bible said he he descended
[54:06] amen into that region of the lost and
[54:09] began to preach to those souls in prison
[54:11] and when he's on his way of Resurrection
[54:14] on his way up he stopped by Paradise
[54:17] amen and the Bible said he he loosed
[54:21] their shackles he led captivity captive
[54:23] and gave gifts to men and we are a
[54:27] product of the resurrection of Jesus
[54:29] Christ see the revelation of this whole
[54:32] message is to realize that Jesus Christ
[54:35] is alive and well he's the same
[54:38] yesterday today and forever amen when
[54:42] you see that Jesus Christ is risen and
[54:45] that he is alive and that he's here now
[54:48] that is the greatest revelation of one
[54:51] of the greatest Revelations you can
[54:53] receive but the greatest of Revelations
[54:56] is that when you can see that Jesus is
[54:59] not a million miles away but that same
[55:02] Jesus is inside of you
[55:06] Hallelujah and we must understand
[55:10] that the word of God has called this
[55:13] bride to be the amen
[55:16] Soviet
[55:17] the amen
[55:19] amen just reading from the expedition of
[55:21] the of the seventh sea uh seven sea uh
[55:24] Church ages here he said these things
[55:26] says the amen
[55:28] I like that it means that whatever he
[55:32] says is final
[55:34] it means that whatever he said to the
[55:37] first age and to the second and to all
[55:40] ages about his his own true church about
[55:43] the false Vine is exactly right and it
[55:47] won't change
[55:50] amen right and we must recognize that
[55:54] even in this True Vine everything that's
[55:57] grafted in this is not brown bride
[56:02] you've got lemons you've got oranges
[56:04] you've got all kinds of citrus fruit
[56:07] that is being grafted into this message
[56:11] but because you're grafted in
[56:14] doesn't mean it's going to change your
[56:16] nature
[56:18] only
[56:20] only
[56:22] when the True Vine bring forth a branch
[56:26] it will produce the original Fruit
[56:29] amen hallelujah and Jesus said I am the
[56:33] vine and you are the branches Hallelujah
[56:36] you can't do nothing
[56:40] without me
[56:41] you understand me so even in this
[56:44] message there are no great ones there's
[56:48] no great eyes big eyes and little use
[56:50] we're all depending on the vine amen and
[56:55] none of us can do anything without Jesus
[56:59] that's right that's right is that right
[57:00] amen the problem that God said in this
[57:02] last day that the bride will know what
[57:05] to do with the word she's the only one
[57:09] everybody else would get a scrupled up
[57:11] but the bride will know what to do with
[57:15] the word amen Hallelujah and he also
[57:18] says she will not move until she get a
[57:22] dust say at the Lord amen hallelujah God
[57:25] because she is totally dependent upon
[57:28] the vine totally opinion about upon him
[57:32] that is a true revelation
[57:35] you know tonight I said to the Lord God
[57:38] you know
[57:39] I rest
[57:41] in you
[57:45] it comes a time you struggle
[57:48] struggle you struggle and what you're
[57:51] struggling with is unbelief
[57:53] because you don't live as righteously as
[57:56] you think you should
[57:58] because you want to do this and do that
[58:00] you fail to see God is in control
[58:03] and once God is quickened life into you
[58:06] he that begun the good work in you is
[58:10] faithful to complete it you cannot
[58:12] complete it amen he completes it
[58:17] Hallelujah
[58:19] amen right it means that what he start
[58:21] out with in Genesis he will finish in
[58:25] Revelation
[58:26] he has to he has to for he is the amen
[58:31] so let it be now we can see it again why
[58:35] the devil hates the Book of Genesis and
[58:38] Revelation he hates the truth
[58:42] and and what is he saying here that God
[58:45] has started something and he's going to
[58:47] finish it
[58:48] amen hallelujah there's nothing he can
[58:51] do to stop the program of God that's
[58:54] right and as long as you know that you
[58:57] know that you know you're part of that
[58:59] program you need to rest in God Amen and
[59:03] all of us have not been called to be
[59:05] preachers or singers or whatever it may
[59:08] be but whatever God has called you to be
[59:11] you be the best you can be
[59:13] amen that's right when the resurrection
[59:16] you must understand listen and we've
[59:18] been taught we thought that all of us
[59:20] are supposed to be doing all kinds of
[59:21] great exploits everybody's not no you
[59:25] got one quarterback yep amen right and
[59:29] everybody else have different positions
[59:30] that's right and their whole that whole
[59:33] uh a lineup is to protect the
[59:36] quarterback so he can place the ball
[59:38] where it needs to go
[59:40] in order for a win yeah
[59:42] see that's how it is that's how the
[59:44] church must understand everybody can't
[59:47] be the pastor amen amen but everybody
[59:49] can take that position in their place
[59:52] they can block that Pastor to make sure
[59:54] he's taking the word and placing it
[59:57] where it should be so that we can have a
[59:59] win
[1:00:00] amen listen no matter how much I preach
[1:00:03] how hard I preach it doesn't matter how
[1:00:06] much I scream it will do us no good if
[1:00:09] the people don't seek the power of the
[1:00:13] Holy Ghost
[1:00:14] in their lives amen
[1:00:16] amen this message has come to influence
[1:00:19] us
[1:00:19] not to make us just sit and not do
[1:00:22] anything you know be the message of what
[1:00:26] is the message see that's the problem
[1:00:28] what is it
[1:00:32] Hallelujah come on now what is it or who
[1:00:36] is it it's Jesus Christ it's the word of
[1:00:39] God manifested for our day amen
[1:00:42] hallelujah if that if Jesus Christ the
[1:00:46] word can't influence you you're dead
[1:00:49] amen it's supposed to bring a change
[1:00:53] Hallelujah take the woman at the well
[1:00:57] she didn't know who Jesus was at the
[1:00:59] beginning
[1:01:00] but as long when he when he began to
[1:01:02] talk to her and began to discern
[1:01:04] her thoughts and begin to tell her
[1:01:07] things about herself can you imagine how
[1:01:10] that was she had never seen that happen
[1:01:13] before
[1:01:14] Hallelujah but he was a stranger telling
[1:01:18] her about her life and then something
[1:01:20] quick quickens something influences her
[1:01:23] something makes her think oh we know
[1:01:26] when the Messiah comes
[1:01:29] see if you say the right things God will
[1:01:32] respond in the right way and she said we
[1:01:34] know when the Messiah should come he's
[1:01:37] going to tell us all of all of these
[1:01:39] things and he says listen they say Jesus
[1:01:41] never said he was a messiah he did right
[1:01:43] there
[1:01:44] Hallelujah he said
[1:01:46] I'm he yeah
[1:01:48] and she immediately didn't say well let
[1:01:52] me see now no he had already Vindicated
[1:01:55] to her and in her spirit in her soul the
[1:01:58] words he spoke so influenced her she ran
[1:02:01] to the city said come and see this man
[1:02:04] that have told me all about myself amen
[1:02:07] hello amen amen is no wonder many people
[1:02:11] thought brother Brandon was God
[1:02:14] because God was in him
[1:02:16] the same Jesus says do that the well
[1:02:19] and talk to that woman was the same
[1:02:21] Jesus and William Branham that's right
[1:02:23] that talked to Millions Amen in his day
[1:02:25] that's right Hallelujah the same God
[1:02:28] Amen but listen what we're doing wrong
[1:02:31] is that we know we're not we don't have
[1:02:33] that position there was one Prophet for
[1:02:36] this age amen none of us would be there
[1:02:38] but the Perfection that God is trying to
[1:02:41] get in US is a mandate yes it's
[1:02:45] mandatory amen
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:49] amen it must be
[1:02:52] and the truth of the matter is how are
[1:02:54] we going to get there
[1:02:56] brother said read your Bible every day
[1:02:59] and pray he said also lay in the
[1:03:02] presence of the son what son the message
[1:03:05] the word hallelujah I can't tell you how
[1:03:09] many times I've listened to take and
[1:03:11] will change doing that
[1:03:13] amen oh y'all don't have to say it's
[1:03:16] true
[1:03:17] why because the voice on the tapes don't
[1:03:19] die it's not the voice of a man if
[1:03:22] you're spiritual you'll catch God
[1:03:25] man
[1:03:28] right
[1:03:30] bringing that influence you know I I
[1:03:33] can't I'm I'm excited and I'll be honest
[1:03:36] with you God's changing me I can see it
[1:03:38] not only see it I can feel it
[1:03:41] yes sir and you know what I measure
[1:03:43] myself every day every day when I pray I
[1:03:47] think about all the wrong I did the day
[1:03:49] before
[1:03:50] right or the night before however but
[1:03:53] those things the Holy Ghost brings to my
[1:03:56] mind I ask God to cleanse me from them
[1:03:59] take them away because I can't do it
[1:04:03] Hallelujah I'm not gonna put my hand to
[1:04:06] something that God's hands is supposed
[1:04:09] to do yeah
[1:04:11] get out of his way amen amen
[1:04:15] Glory that's the truth you know it's
[1:04:17] like trying to put on a coat on a child
[1:04:20] um and they trying to help you out no
[1:04:22] stand still and let me put the coat on
[1:04:25] you
[1:04:26] see that's all God is trying to say but
[1:04:29] you know what con what consumes us is
[1:04:31] our unbelief
[1:04:33] because we don't grow fast enough or
[1:04:35] fast as we think we should
[1:04:38] Hallelujah
[1:04:40] but I don't know whether you ever seen
[1:04:41] artwork before
[1:04:43] but you where this modern day now they
[1:04:45] just splash paint on the wall
[1:04:48] but in reality a true artist takes his
[1:04:51] time
[1:04:53] if it's a paint job he he makes sure he
[1:04:55] place that brush just right and you know
[1:04:58] or if it's a sculpture you know he just
[1:05:02] don't bang on the thing anywhere he any
[1:05:04] place he's got a vision in his mind and
[1:05:07] he takes his time to chip away the
[1:05:09] excess
[1:05:11] if that don't help you nothing will God
[1:05:14] takes his time to take of the excess in
[1:05:18] your life the part of you that he he
[1:05:21] doesn't need and doesn't want he takes
[1:05:24] his time to chip it away
[1:05:26] but you better know he's still chipping
[1:05:30] Hallelujah
[1:05:32] listen the only place and this is what I
[1:05:34] try to get people to see because there
[1:05:36] are so many of us who don't have the
[1:05:37] Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] now when I came in here I felt the Holy
[1:05:42] Spirit and I don't know what has
[1:05:44] happened something is changing the
[1:05:45] atmosphere so I'm trying to tell you
[1:05:48] whatever that is you make sure you get
[1:05:49] it right with God because you're
[1:05:51] grieving him
[1:05:53] Jesus
[1:05:55] when you're going to worship God you
[1:05:57] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:05:59] the only place of worship is the prophet
[1:06:02] of God said is under the shed blood of
[1:06:05] the Lamb do we understand that we don't
[1:06:07] have the literal blood but the blood of
[1:06:10] the Lamb is the Holy Spirit
[1:06:12] right it's the only place today and
[1:06:15] that's in Christ
[1:06:16] only way you do it is come into him
[1:06:20] that's the only place to worship amen it
[1:06:24] always was that way and the only place
[1:06:26] to worship is under the shed blood
[1:06:29] that's right that's right without the
[1:06:31] Holy Spirit you just potentially
[1:06:33] worshiping amen and your worship is in
[1:06:36] vain because you've got to Worship in
[1:06:38] the Holy Ghost I don't care what you
[1:06:41] claim yourself to be amen you've got to
[1:06:44] have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:46] amen how you get it you just gotta get
[1:06:49] it
[1:06:50] Hallelujah and the Bible said if a man
[1:06:53] hunger and thirst after righteousness he
[1:06:56] shall be filled
[1:06:58] seek ye first the kingdom of God that's
[1:07:01] the problem we have a system where
[1:07:04] everybody oh I've been born this you
[1:07:06] I've been born in America born in the
[1:07:09] message mean you got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] huh
[1:07:13] right if your mom and daddy been born in
[1:07:17] the message you got to be born in the
[1:07:19] message that's right and that does not
[1:07:21] come by a natural birth it comes by a
[1:07:24] spiritual birth
[1:07:25] amen that's the problem so many people
[1:07:28] have walked with this message learn all
[1:07:30] of the do's and the don'ts but that does
[1:07:33] not declare or bring to you the Holy
[1:07:35] Ghost the Rich Young Ruler outdo you
[1:07:40] he did everything right and didn't have
[1:07:43] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:45] Hallelujah matter of fact he walked away
[1:07:47] from him
[1:07:48] the very Christ stood with him stood
[1:07:51] right there said come follow me sell all
[1:07:55] that you have and come follow me it was
[1:07:58] too Grievous because though he did
[1:08:01] everything right he had a love for the
[1:08:03] world that he could not break
[1:08:08] huh
[1:08:10] look what the prophet said it should be
[1:08:12] every worshiper
[1:08:14] every true worship that they long to get
[1:08:17] together there's something about
[1:08:19] Fellowship that Divine Fellowship right
[1:08:22] it's it it's order of God it's ordered
[1:08:26] of God and it's holy and sacred and the
[1:08:30] righteous are trust thirsting for it
[1:08:32] right and there's nothing more more
[1:08:35] satisfying to get with a brother or
[1:08:38] sister and they're asking you questions
[1:08:40] about the word and you're talking about
[1:08:42] Jesus and and you're you're seeing
[1:08:44] things you you've never seen before but
[1:08:46] listen even Among Us it's scarce
[1:08:50] everybody want to talk about everything
[1:08:52] else but when you really talk about the
[1:08:54] word right
[1:08:55] you talk about Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] Hallelujah
[1:09:01] now people get excited
[1:09:04] I had a brother say the other day and I
[1:09:06] hope
[1:09:07] if you hear this he doesn't get offended
[1:09:09] by it
[1:09:10] but he was telling and he was saying all
[1:09:13] you know in the Congo everybody
[1:09:16] knows this message
[1:09:19] everybody have heard of brother Branham
[1:09:21] and when he said that I said to myself
[1:09:25] but what about Jesus Christ
[1:09:29] when did the message become brother
[1:09:31] Branham
[1:09:34] see I get in trouble for that but that's
[1:09:36] okay I'm going to preach what he's
[1:09:38] telling me to preach
[1:09:39] see that's the problem there's a lot of
[1:09:41] people who know Moses but not they don't
[1:09:43] know the god of Moses only Joshua and
[1:09:46] Caleb understood the god of Moses he
[1:09:50] asked Moses was a great prophet it's
[1:09:52] true William brought him the same you
[1:09:55] know I respect it oh my God I don't want
[1:09:57] to say the wrong thing because there's
[1:09:59] nothing in me that's against my prophet
[1:10:02] if he wasn't if he didn't had not come I
[1:10:05] would not have I wouldn't be here
[1:10:08] thank God for him
[1:10:10] I can't hardly wait to see him
[1:10:12] y'all understand me
[1:10:14] I can't hardly wait to see him but I
[1:10:16] understand what he was doing I
[1:10:19] understand the message now I understand
[1:10:21] let me say it like this I understand the
[1:10:24] message now
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:28] yes I was caught up into a system like
[1:10:31] everybody else but let me tell you what
[1:10:34] you get tired of going around the same
[1:10:35] circles
[1:10:37] no changes in your life
[1:10:41] the word is right but if it's misapplied
[1:10:46] if you don't see the vision the prophet
[1:10:49] left us
[1:10:50] amen he gave us a vision
[1:10:52] let me say it like this when the bride
[1:10:55] was marching to Onward Christian Soldier
[1:10:57] or marching to the word where was
[1:10:59] William Branham he was standing on the
[1:11:01] sideline watching her yeah
[1:11:04] do you get it
[1:11:07] he said in there was a voice he said I
[1:11:09] didn't see him but he was talking to me
[1:11:14] amen and as they March forward
[1:11:18] they sang the song on with Christian
[1:11:20] Soldier marching as to war with the
[1:11:24] cross of Jesus
[1:11:26] Jesus
[1:11:30] amen it has to be him
[1:11:32] he's the one that's living in me amen
[1:11:35] amen it has to be him
[1:11:38] I wouldn't even know who Jesus Christ
[1:11:40] was if it wasn't for Malachi 4. amen
[1:11:44] Hallelujah but he brought to us the
[1:11:46] original understanding of who God is
[1:11:50] Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah
[1:11:54] Hallelujah y'all understand me the god
[1:11:58] of alpha is the same God Omega
[1:12:04] Hallelujah
[1:12:06] and let me tell you what the system did
[1:12:08] to us
[1:12:09] it made us think we were the only ones
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:16] well among our fractions
[1:12:19] which one of the fractions is right
[1:12:24] it's the word that's right
[1:12:29] listen what the prophet said but it
[1:12:31] still remains God only meets the true
[1:12:34] worshiper under the blood
[1:12:36] he never changes it now here's the
[1:12:39] Stinger we can't all be methodists we
[1:12:44] can't all be Pentecostals we can't be
[1:12:46] all this that or the other we'll
[1:12:49] disagree but when I come to a man let
[1:12:53] him be a Catholic priest or whatever he
[1:12:55] is when he is under the blood we are
[1:12:59] brothers
[1:13:01] care where he's at
[1:13:03] as long as he's under that blood

[1:16:50] there
[1:16:51] oh yes sir we find that to be true
[1:16:55] now let me say it like this because
[1:16:57] people said well you know we're in it
[1:17:00] well the Pharisees said they did that
[1:17:01] the same thing they were it
[1:17:04] and then Jesus said accept your
[1:17:06] righteousness exceed feed the Pharisees
[1:17:09] you ain't gonna go nowhere
[1:17:11] that was man-made system made Jesus was
[1:17:14] saying I'm looking for some
[1:17:15] righteousness that I can give
[1:17:18] Hallelujah now that's why we all we do
[1:17:22] in in in word or indeed we do it in the

[1:17:43] so if that name don't excite you or make
[1:17:46] you feel good
[1:17:48] you might need to get on your knees
[1:17:50] again and just start saying Jesus Jesus

[1:20:27] trusting their names or their titles or
[1:20:30] their Creed you are lost because you
[1:20:33] can't even worship until you first you
[1:20:35] you come into the place of worship amen
[1:20:38] amen and that only place God meets the
[1:20:40] worshiper is the place he chose to put
[1:20:43] his name all others you trust in them
[1:20:46] you'll die also another shout of Jesus
[1:20:50] here I've got marked down see he's
[1:20:52] scripture he says foreshadow he must be
[1:20:55] without blemish
[1:20:57] the place he put his name his name must
[1:21:00] be without blemish that's the only name
[1:21:02] I know
[1:21:04] Harry said I can't find no fault there
[1:21:07] was no blemish not in him did not in him
[1:21:10] now hey whatever Christians do does not
[1:21:14] reflect him because he's the only one
[1:21:17] amen amen he was the perfect lamb
[1:21:19] without fought wrinkle or blemish he was
[1:21:22] the only one worthy to open the book in
[1:21:25] the loosen he Christ Alone was the only
[1:21:29] one hallelujah
[1:21:31] oh my now what denominational system can
[1:21:34] you you pin this to what Church Catholic
[1:21:38] President uh Jewish whatever like I said
[1:21:41] the other night I think I preached this
[1:21:42] uh something there in Iowa City let me
[1:21:45] tell you something that Ephesus Church
[1:21:47] we can't even compare
[1:21:49] now and we supposed to be the alpha man
[1:21:52] we've got to measure up
[1:21:54] we've got to stop this foolishness our
[1:21:57] minds have been cluttered with worldly
[1:21:59] things
[1:22:00] worldly desires when we're going to
[1:22:03] focus
[1:22:05] and if now now when when the time is
[1:22:09] running out on us look at the politics
[1:22:12] look at Society look how crazy things
[1:22:16] are
[1:22:16] look what happened there in Syria turkey
[1:22:20] the last I had I saw a county was over
[1:22:22] 11 000 people dead
[1:22:25] one one baby they pulled out where a
[1:22:28] mother just had her baby God the mother
[1:22:31] died just brand new baby
[1:22:35] what's gonna happen to that baby y'all
[1:22:37] understand me
[1:22:39] but you think God reigned on them
[1:22:41] because they're the most wicked no sir
[1:22:45] God is righteous in his judgment amen
[1:22:48] for what I heard now I don't know this
[1:22:50] is true a brother told me that he got a
[1:22:53] uh well breaking news that they were
[1:22:55] getting ready to persecute some
[1:22:56] Christians over there and then the
[1:22:58] earthquake came
[1:23:01] sound a little biblical to me
[1:23:06] whether that be true or not I told him I
[1:23:08] said brother I'd like to see that he
[1:23:09] said breaking news and whenever that
[1:23:10] comes he said it just shows up on my
[1:23:12] screen and then it goes but whether it
[1:23:15] be true or not
[1:23:16] God has Us in his hands
[1:23:21] would that be the first time God shook
[1:23:22] it up
[1:23:23] Paul and Silas was in the prison jail
[1:23:25] they began to worship God they had a
[1:23:29] death sentence they began to pray
[1:23:31] and God shook the foundation
[1:23:35] Hallelujah I got oh
[1:23:38] I saw something the prophet of God said
[1:23:40] the other day I'm like oh my God I knew
[1:23:43] it was in here but I had never seen it
[1:23:44] before the way he said it and he
[1:23:47] basically said when that squeeze come on
[1:23:48] the bride won't have nothing to worry
[1:23:50] about because God will take care of her
[1:23:52] but he talks about her eating and all
[1:23:54] that stuff shelter because he's dealing
[1:23:56] with the third pool he said she won't
[1:23:58] have to worry about nothing I got to
[1:24:00] find that thing I was looking for it
[1:24:01] today and it didn't come up but uh it
[1:24:04] was one one of those messages I heard
[1:24:05] and a boy that I was I was like shouting
[1:24:08] John
[1:24:09] I know it's true
[1:24:14] man now let me ask you this if he can do
[1:24:17] that Under The Squeeze why can't he do
[1:24:19] it now
[1:24:21] see because what happens we waiting for
[1:24:24] everything has its place
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] like I was saying let me tell y'all it's
[1:24:30] just brother Brandon this is what I'm
[1:24:32] seeing it's what I'm seeing I'm seeing
[1:24:34] the god of brother Branham and then it
[1:24:36] says Lord
[1:24:37] where's that scripture God said Elisha
[1:24:41] yep when he was getting ready to cross
[1:24:43] the Jordan he said where is the god of
[1:24:47] Elijah
[1:24:50] there it was
[1:24:53] we're not seeking Elijah because see
[1:24:55] there's a many people in the church
[1:24:57] that's what they're seeking for Elijah
[1:25:00] you know those false prophets they knew
[1:25:02] he had gone up but they still looked for
[1:25:04] him that's right right but here Elijah
[1:25:08] will Elijah went on about his business
[1:25:10] doing the work of the Lord why because
[1:25:13] he called out where is the god of Elijah
[1:25:17] that's what I'm crying out where is the
[1:25:20] god of Elijah amen let me tell you where
[1:25:23] he's at he's here
[1:25:25] man amen but until you recognize him he
[1:25:28] can't
[1:25:28] do nothing with you
[1:25:31] it's like him coming down to Simon's
[1:25:34] house and you know sitting there in the
[1:25:36] corner you not even washing his feet or
[1:25:38] welcoming here in the church and you're
[1:25:40] doing all of these things and and here
[1:25:42] come a prostitute comes in there that's
[1:25:44] why I tell people I said hey there's
[1:25:46] going to be a lot of prostitutes in
[1:25:47] heaven
[1:25:50] because one thing they know is that they
[1:25:52] need to be saved
[1:25:54] these religious people they don't know
[1:25:56] that
[1:25:57] they just thank God looking for the
[1:25:59] righteous God looking for the
[1:26:00] unrighteous he looking for the sinners
[1:26:06] Hallelujah is that all right just a
[1:26:08] little story about a man named John
[1:26:11] hmm
[1:26:14] this little man brother Ben talks about
[1:26:16] the story he says he had been out
[1:26:18] you've heard it before around Christmas
[1:26:20] and visiting his colleagues
[1:26:23] and they all said to him John have a
[1:26:25] little just a little drink and from
[1:26:27] house to house he got too much and he
[1:26:30] had to go back home and cross in the
[1:26:32] park his little boy was with him
[1:26:36] and he missed the little boy and turned
[1:26:38] around and looked and the little boy was
[1:26:41] just going from one side to another
[1:26:44] and the dad waited till the little boy
[1:26:46] got to him he said why are you going all
[1:26:50] over the park son what makes you walk
[1:26:53] like that he said daddy I'm trying to
[1:26:56] walk in your footsteps
[1:26:59] and that's right see that that little
[1:27:01] boy was trying to walk listen when
[1:27:04] people see Christians and they know you
[1:27:07] and if they see you moving in every kind
[1:27:10] of way then that's what exactly they
[1:27:12] figure a Christian can do but we're not
[1:27:14] to walk like that our lives are supposed
[1:27:17] to be circumspect it's you know a
[1:27:20] circumcised to the place amen that we
[1:27:22] are we are like him we walk like him we
[1:27:26] talk like him we live like him most of
[1:27:28] all we love because this is our age this
[1:27:31] is the age of love divine love
[1:27:35] Hallelujah he said is that right the man
[1:27:38] picked up the little boy and sit there
[1:27:39] and sit down and took the little fella
[1:27:41] in his arms and he said God you forgive
[1:27:44] me I want to walk straight so my son
[1:27:47] behind me will walk straight
[1:27:51] and that's what we want to do as
[1:27:52] Christians we want to walk like
[1:27:54] Christians live like Christians talk
[1:27:58] like Christians
[1:28:01] huh that's God that's the God we serve
[1:28:12] we need a power of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:15] to come and strike us again how many of
[1:28:18] y'all would love that
[1:28:20] oh my my my
[1:28:23] oh oh sometimes the Holy Spirit hits me
[1:28:26] in this pulpit and I know y'all don't
[1:28:28] even know what's happening
[1:28:31] but sometimes I feel like I can run
[1:28:33] through a wall
[1:28:34] but you know it's it's not it's got to
[1:28:37] be everybody got to have a call in their
[1:28:40] lives for Jesus
[1:28:42] right
[1:28:43] because what did Brother Branham do what
[1:28:46] was his ministry
[1:28:47] he showed us that it was Jesus Christ
[1:28:50] was in the image of a Methodist it was
[1:28:52] wasn't the image of a Baptist it wasn't
[1:28:54] in the image of Pentecost it wasn't any
[1:28:56] anybody image it was only in the image
[1:28:58] of the word which was God himself
[1:29:00] and that is the image that we're
[1:29:02] supposed to be formed and shaped into
[1:29:04] the very word of God we are the amen to
[1:29:07] every word right amen he said behold I
[1:29:11] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:29:13] but tarry you that don't means pray it
[1:29:16] means wait
[1:29:18] now how many times we've been taught
[1:29:20] I've been taught that tarrying means
[1:29:22] pray
[1:29:23] no Terry means wait
[1:29:27] wait on him
[1:29:29] it just mean wait Terry means wait wait
[1:29:33] up there at the city of Jerusalem until
[1:29:36] you endure with power from on high
[1:29:38] doesn't mean you can't pray but you're
[1:29:40] praying and waiting right that's the
[1:29:44] problem a lot of times we pray but we
[1:29:45] can't wait
[1:29:47] but it's waiting and when this influence
[1:29:51] of the Holy Ghost struck them it filled
[1:29:54] them they seen the word that Jesus
[1:29:56] Promised fulfill y'all hear what I'm
[1:29:58] saying this is what we must see
[1:30:01] we must see it I can't let me say it I
[1:30:05] can't get it like like I wanna but let
[1:30:07] me say it like this it's more to the
[1:30:09] message than quoting
[1:30:14] it's more to the Bible than quoting it
[1:30:17] there's so many people that can out
[1:30:19] quote me in this word
[1:30:22] amen hallelujah but Paul said I didn't
[1:30:24] come to you with Excellence of speech I
[1:30:27] came with demonstration and power amen
[1:30:29] power what the Holy Ghost and Paul
[1:30:32] wasn't ashamed to say it he said I don't
[1:30:34] just want to know Jesus and the power of
[1:30:37] his resurrection but I also want to know
[1:30:38] him in his suffering Hallelujah and to
[1:30:41] treat Christians today don't want to
[1:30:43] know him in his suffering as soon as
[1:30:45] somebody call you a name a brand Amite
[1:30:48] or some strange name holy roll or
[1:30:50] something you might get offended while
[1:30:52] you're wearing that dress look like that
[1:30:54] and why you don't wear makeup and
[1:30:55] brothers while you cut your hand why you
[1:30:57] don't have tattoos yep
[1:31:00] no I said that because somebody might
[1:31:03] I'm not against your tattoo I'm just
[1:31:05] saying Christians most Christians
[1:31:07] sometimes people have a monarchy and one
[1:31:10] thing about them once you get them on
[1:31:11] there you can't get them off that I know
[1:31:13] of anyway but anyway that doesn't
[1:31:15] describe Define a man anyway
[1:31:18] it's the heart
[1:31:20] see the voice of warning listen and this
[1:31:24] is what people this is what I'm saying
[1:31:25] I've I've seen it happen
[1:31:27] we was in an Apostolic Church a
[1:31:29] Pentecostal church I don't know if my
[1:31:31] wife was there or not
[1:31:32] um I'm trying to think well I can't
[1:31:34] remember the place we were and this
[1:31:37] young this brother preaching preaching
[1:31:38] he come all out of the pulpit he walks
[1:31:40] down the aisle and he's standing right
[1:31:42] there Amen in front of a system it
[1:31:45] almost a sister it almost looked rude
[1:31:47] but that was God talking to her
[1:31:50] and try to persuade her to be saved
[1:31:53] and she said after the service she said
[1:31:55] I'll come back tomorrow night that was
[1:31:56] for Thursday night we have preaching she
[1:31:59] said I'll come back tomorrow night and
[1:32:01] I'll be saved on her way to the club
[1:32:04] Friday
[1:32:06] she get in an accident
[1:32:08] and she's calling out the preacher's
[1:32:10] name
[1:32:12] get get Pastor Johnson get Pastor
[1:32:15] Johnson
[1:32:17] she wanted to repent
[1:32:19] but she died
[1:32:21] you see you never know when that last
[1:32:23] call is being made
[1:32:26] people and you know what she's haunted
[1:32:29] right now
[1:32:30] if God didn't have mercy I don't know
[1:32:32] whether he did or not but if God did not
[1:32:34] have mercy on her remember the sister
[1:32:37] brother Bradham said that they were the
[1:32:39] car wreck
[1:32:40] and she told her she looked over to her
[1:32:41] daughter and she says he was talking to
[1:32:43] me
[1:32:44] I was supposed to answer to that that
[1:32:46] that that call and I did not she said I
[1:32:49] knew I was wrong and she died
[1:32:53] see it's just you never know and I'm
[1:32:56] talking now to Believers I'm talking to
[1:32:58] all of us
[1:33:00] when God is saying straighten up get rid
[1:33:02] of it stop it that's exactly what he
[1:33:05] means amen but there come a time when
[1:33:07] God's going to stop talking to you like
[1:33:09] that
[1:33:11] man remember the voice will haunt not
[1:33:14] only you here the tape goes all over the
[1:33:18] world and I'm not exactly speaking to
[1:33:20] all all here but if there is somebody
[1:33:22] here needs it well that is for you then
[1:33:26] but remember that that voice will hurt
[1:33:29] you as long as you live in the day of
[1:33:32] your dying it'll haunt you obey it
[1:33:36] come back
[1:33:38] our tradition has took the word of God
[1:33:40] and made it of no effect
[1:33:44] the word of God being made manifest and
[1:33:46] the people stands around and say well I
[1:33:49] guess that's pretty good see my oh it
[1:33:53] ought to set your soul on fire
[1:33:55] it ought to do something I can remember
[1:33:58] when we first had the message or when it
[1:34:00] first came everybody was on fire
[1:34:02] everybody
[1:34:04] wherever you went you heard the voice
[1:34:07] foreign
[1:34:09] now you don't hear nothing
[1:34:13] most of the time
[1:34:15] not even in cars
[1:34:17] most of the time
[1:34:19] a call to worship
[1:34:21] people I don't know
[1:34:23] where we stand with God
[1:34:26] but at some point in time we'll either
[1:34:28] get serious
[1:34:32] or not
[1:34:34] it all depends on what you want to
[1:34:36] become
[1:34:38] right or what you becoming I don't know
[1:34:42] that only you know that
[1:34:44] Hallelujah
[1:34:45] I'm gonna go in just a minute give me a
[1:34:48] few more minutes
[1:34:49] and this is coming out on Luke 7 30 36
[1:34:53] to 50.
[1:34:55] and one of the Pharisees desired him
[1:34:57] that he would eat with him
[1:35:00] and went into the Pharisees house and
[1:35:02] sat down to meet
[1:35:03] and behold a woman in the city which was
[1:35:07] a sinner when she knew that Jesus said
[1:35:10] at me at the Pharisees house brought an
[1:35:13] alabaster box of ointment
[1:35:16] and stood At His Feet behind him weeping
[1:35:20] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:35:23] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:35:26] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:35:29] them with the anointment ointment right
[1:35:33] now I like to see some of these women do
[1:35:35] that now
[1:35:37] they'd have to stand up on their head
[1:35:39] to do that wash his feet with their hair
[1:35:43] it shows that long hair was respected
[1:35:46] it is what God required
[1:35:49] but now people want to just cut it all
[1:35:51] off
[1:35:52] now when the Pharisees which have been
[1:35:55] him saw it he spake within himself
[1:35:58] saying this man if he were a prophet
[1:36:01] would have known who and what man of
[1:36:04] woman this is that touched him for she
[1:36:07] is a sinner
[1:36:09] and Jesus answered said unto him Simon I
[1:36:13] have somewhat to say unto thee and he
[1:36:15] said Master say on
[1:36:18] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:36:21] two debtors
[1:36:22] the 10500 Pence
[1:36:25] and the other one 50.
[1:36:27] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:36:30] frankly forgave them both tell me
[1:36:33] therefore which of them will love him
[1:36:36] most
[1:36:38] right Simon answered and said I suppose
[1:36:40] that he to whom he forgave most and he
[1:36:44] said unto him thou has rightly judged
[1:36:47] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:36:50] Simon see it thou this woman
[1:36:53] I entered into thine house thou gaveth
[1:36:56] me no water for my feet see and you know
[1:36:59] what we put that in history
[1:37:02] and we fail to see we're acting the same
[1:37:04] way
[1:37:05] we come into the house we don't do
[1:37:07] nothing we fail to see he's here to be
[1:37:10] entertained we don't hardly say Amen we
[1:37:13] don't say glory to God we do nothing
[1:37:15] it's just a Simon he's there to observe
[1:37:19] you know what I mean and here was this
[1:37:21] woman she see that's what I'm saying
[1:37:23] when you know you've been forgiven much
[1:37:25] I have been forgiven much and I don't
[1:37:29] care people to tell you wherever I go
[1:37:32] you know brother Brooks is in the house
[1:37:34] because if you're going to worship God
[1:37:36] I'm Gonna Worship Him if you don't
[1:37:39] worship him I'm going to worship Him
[1:37:42] a compliment with nobody else is
[1:37:44] worshiping I worship
[1:37:46] amen why because I know I have a
[1:37:49] revelation
[1:37:51] of who I'm coming to see
[1:37:53] amen I know he's in me but I know when
[1:37:56] we come together we come together and he
[1:37:59] said well two or three are gathered in
[1:38:00] my name there I'm in the midst amen I
[1:38:03] don't have to see it I know he's there
[1:38:05] that's right I'm not here to show off
[1:38:07] but I'm here to worship God and I know
[1:38:09] how the devil say oh you don't have to
[1:38:11] do it no I don't have to excuse me
[1:38:17] he's not making me do anything but
[1:38:20] there's something on the inside it's
[1:38:22] like a well of water something on the
[1:38:25] inside I cannot sit still amen something
[1:38:29] makes me worship amen if when I say make
[1:38:32] me it's a willful worship but it's just
[1:38:34] a gushing it's something that comes out
[1:38:36] and oh my there's not been a church time
[1:38:40] I come to church and I left left here
[1:38:42] feeling worse I always feel better after
[1:38:45] I leave here
[1:38:47] I don't care who's preaching yeah I
[1:38:49] don't care who's singing I I leave out
[1:38:52] here feeling better that's why I come
[1:38:55] Hallelujah and he turned to the woman
[1:38:57] said to Simon see it thou this woman I
[1:39:00] entered into the dying house and thou
[1:39:02] gaveth me no water for my feet but she
[1:39:05] hath washed my feet with tears and wiped
[1:39:08] them with the hairs of her head and I
[1:39:10] thought maybe one day I thought you know
[1:39:12] we need to just get together and play
[1:39:14] some music and cast these Devils off
[1:39:16] these people
[1:39:17] maybe we'll get some worship some
[1:39:18] shouting stuff going on in here
[1:39:21] because music does it
[1:39:23] yeah we need to do some music we need to
[1:39:26] get some music up in here
[1:39:28] I'm serious I'm laughing but I'm really
[1:39:31] serious
[1:39:35] we gonna do that one day
[1:39:38] after the after the service we're gonna
[1:39:40] have a what another service
[1:39:44] and we ain't gonna quit till the Holy
[1:39:46] Ghost come down
[1:39:49] mm-hmm
[1:39:50] yeah
[1:39:53] he gaveth me no kiss he thou gave me no
[1:39:56] kiss I'm almost done but this woman
[1:39:58] since that time I came in have not
[1:40:01] ceased to kiss my feet my head with art
[1:40:04] and uh my head with all thou did not
[1:40:06] anoint but this woman have anointed my
[1:40:10] feet and my with her ointment right
[1:40:13] what is the art man
[1:40:15] it's the Holy Spirit
[1:40:21] when you think the Holy Ghost was given
[1:40:23] to you to sit down
[1:40:25] y'all understand I know we're tired I
[1:40:27] come in here tired too amen but I I put
[1:40:30] that aside
[1:40:31] I've come in here many times sick but I
[1:40:34] put that aside
[1:40:36] man and many times because of my
[1:40:38] sacrifice I leave out of this Pulpit
[1:40:40] healed
[1:40:43] amen I believe that I believe that if
[1:40:45] you come in here sick and you put
[1:40:47] yourself in the service you'll leave out
[1:40:49] here well amen
[1:40:51] I believe that I've seen it happen me to
[1:40:53] me period right wherefore I say unto
[1:40:56] thee her sins which are many are
[1:40:59] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[1:41:02] little Is Forgiven
[1:41:04] the same loveth little
[1:41:07] and he said to her thy sins are forgiven
[1:41:10] I had a brother who's now the pastor
[1:41:12] there in South Africa he said he lived
[1:41:15] so right before God and before his
[1:41:16] parents he didn't know how to repent
[1:41:18] because he didn't see where he had
[1:41:19] anything to repent from
[1:41:22] never disobeyed his parents to once he
[1:41:25] came to understand that did everything
[1:41:26] they say do he was a virgin when he got
[1:41:29] married
[1:41:31] you know he just did everything right he
[1:41:33] was like a rich young ruler and he said
[1:41:35] when the preacher stopped preaching
[1:41:37] about Sin and all of the things that the
[1:41:38] world of people did he said there was
[1:41:40] nothing he could relate to
[1:41:43] but God showed him one day how wretched
[1:41:45] he really was
[1:41:46] and right now that man is a powerful
[1:41:49] preacher filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:51] you love the Lord
[1:41:54] I'm gonna I'm gonna stop here I don't
[1:41:56] want to keep you all night but I'm gonna
[1:41:59] tell you something
[1:42:00] if people fail to recognize
[1:42:03] this word is alive
[1:42:06] and the prophet of God said when a
[1:42:08] messenger or Prophet comes or age change
[1:42:11] he said it must be a new word
[1:42:14] it must be another message is the way he
[1:42:17] said it he said it cannot be the same
[1:42:19] message a messenger cannot preach the
[1:42:23] same message that the messenger before
[1:42:26] him preached
[1:42:28] amen so what are you saying I'm saying
[1:42:31] in this message we have two messages or
[1:42:34] two in one if you want to say it like
[1:42:36] this I said like this the message that
[1:42:38] brother Brandon preached to the
[1:42:39] Pentecostal is still here
[1:42:42] but there's a message in the message
[1:42:44] that he preaches to the bride and he
[1:42:47] teaches us Amen to what read between the
[1:42:51] lines
[1:42:53] it's there
[1:42:55] and that Revelation yes and that
[1:42:57] Revelation that God gives us it changes
[1:43:00] us
[1:43:02] it changes us it takes us from thinking
[1:43:06] like Sinners to Saints it literally
[1:43:09] began to listen that I couldn't even you
[1:43:11] know I'm I'm getting I'm cozy but my
[1:43:14] thought was this how can it be me
[1:43:18] who am I Lord
[1:43:20] how can I be bride that that was my
[1:43:24] question
[1:43:25] for a long time how I mean I believed it
[1:43:28] but I'm thinking how
[1:43:30] and you know and you got to accept his
[1:43:32] choosing man he chose me
[1:43:35] he gave me Revelation listen there's
[1:43:38] nobody could if I could say it like this
[1:43:41] when I was in the Apostolic Church asked
[1:43:42] my wife there wasn't too many service I
[1:43:44] wasn't dancing and praising God and
[1:43:46] speaking in tongue and twisting and
[1:43:47] turning and I just realized huh running
[1:43:51] up and down the aisles what I had me a
[1:43:53] dance
[1:43:55] but at the end of the day
[1:43:58] you find out that your life hasn't
[1:44:00] changed so much
[1:44:03] that's what caught my attention
[1:44:06] that I was be I was able to do all of
[1:44:10] that
[1:44:11] and yet and still there were things in
[1:44:13] my life I could not conquer
[1:44:15] that ain't it
[1:44:17] I'm standing with the two Holy Ghost but
[1:44:20] I needed to move forward
[1:44:22] I needed more and now I mean in this
[1:44:26] message and I never understood why God
[1:44:28] brought me up here
[1:44:30] I do now
[1:44:33] because I have been
[1:44:37] taught a lot
[1:44:40] I have gone through a lot
[1:44:43] and and all of I've gone through I've
[1:44:47] come to see Jesus
[1:44:49] everything that I've come through
[1:44:51] brought me to Jesus
[1:44:55] brought me to the Christ that I needed
[1:44:57] to see
[1:44:59] and I'm thankful
[1:45:01] at this point in time I'm so thankful
[1:45:04] because let me say it like brother
[1:45:06] Brandon said it in the message influence
[1:45:09] he says like uziah trying to usurp the

[1:46:15] I've been ordained to do what I'm
[1:46:16] supposed to do
[1:46:20] man uh um let me read this last quote
[1:46:22] and then I'll let you go is that okay
[1:46:26] coming from the message in Florence
[1:46:30] now way down
[1:46:32] the church has constantly come to a
[1:46:34] minority
[1:46:36] has come up now till all the church ages
[1:46:39] has run out
[1:46:41] it's got to be honed
[1:46:43] that stone
[1:46:45] has to fit straight amen
[1:46:49] in
[1:46:51] amen the ministry and I want you to hear
[1:46:53] this
[1:46:54] the ministry that Jesus that was in
[1:46:58] Jesus Christ
[1:46:59] has to be in his church to make Christ
[1:47:04] come for his church
[1:47:06] you understand me he cannot come back
[1:47:10] until he see his ministry
[1:47:12] in his church to raise up every age to
[1:47:17] bring him to bring him out
[1:47:20] just like the wheat the wheat has to
[1:47:23] come plumbed back as it started maturing
[1:47:28] from the grain where it rotted died and
[1:47:31] come forth and kept coming up from grass
[1:47:33] into something else you can't go back to
[1:47:37] grass
[1:47:38] don't point back to Grass don't point
[1:47:41] back to this huh did you hear me don't
[1:47:45] point back to this don't point back to
[1:47:48] the sheath come on until you get into
[1:47:51] the wheat
[1:47:52] and the weed has to be the same kind of
[1:47:55] wheat
[1:47:56] that went into the ground when it's a
[1:48:00] mustard when excuse me when it's matured
[1:48:03] Jesus is raised from the dead he is
[1:48:06] matured now and he has matured in his
[1:48:10] church through justification
[1:48:12] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:14] through these reformers in the early age
[1:48:17] now here he is on Earth today in his
[1:48:22] people amen believe him he is here amen
[1:48:27] Hallelujah maturity all right amen
[1:48:31] maturity of Jesus Christ in US
[1:48:35] today amen he's risen
[1:48:38] that's true Revelation when you can see
[1:48:42] that Jesus Christ's desire is to mature
[1:48:45] grow up into you manifest His Image in
[1:48:49] you amen you
[1:48:51] yes Lord
[1:48:53] amen and you can't stop it gets
[1:48:57] worrisome sometimes because it's so easy
[1:48:59] to slip in things in your mind and your
[1:49:01] thoughts in your actions but we have not
[1:49:05] a high priest that cannot be touched by
[1:49:07] the feelings of our infirmities God
[1:49:10] always hears amen the believer
[1:49:13] the Lord stand up and we'll pray
[1:49:18] so many things
[1:49:20] I did leave out
[1:49:22] but you know what I can't
[1:49:25] I can't preach to everybody like you
[1:49:28] everybody is good oh we don't have
[1:49:31] enough of that
[1:49:34] nobody wants to hear how wrong they are
[1:49:37] and most people I'm sorry that
[1:49:40] he says look I won't call what it is but
[1:49:42] I don't have a flu or cold so don't get
[1:49:44] nervous but my my thing is is that we're
[1:49:47] at a place
[1:49:49] uh
[1:49:52] something's got to be done
[1:49:54] and my thing is nobody can do it but you
[1:49:59] the Bible says search the scriptures
[1:50:02] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:50:04] life
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:06] and I'll be honest with you I didn't
[1:50:07] come this far to lose out
[1:50:10] right I did not
[1:50:13] um
[1:50:15] and I've said to God I says Lord if
[1:50:16] they're being things in my life you're
[1:50:18] the only one that can fix it
[1:50:20] foreign
[1:50:24] I'm not sad so many things going on in
[1:50:27] my life but I have such a peace
[1:50:29] it passes my understanding
[1:50:32] I do
[1:50:34] because I know that God is with me
[1:50:37] he always been with me even when I
[1:50:40] didn't even know him he was with me I
[1:50:42] can look back and I can see him in my
[1:50:45] life when I was never when I wasn't
[1:50:46] giving him honor wasn't giving him
[1:50:48] praise but he was there
[1:50:51] with every seed true seed of God you can
[1:50:54] see I can remember time when I should be
[1:50:57] dead people should let me bullets I
[1:51:00] remember one time when I was a boy I
[1:51:02] dropped something and it was a good
[1:51:03] thing I dropped the note because when I
[1:51:05] got to the highway that drunken man
[1:51:07] passed me by and I saw nurses hit by
[1:51:11] that man if I had just another minute or
[1:51:14] so that truck would have hit me because
[1:51:15] he was riding the sidewalk
[1:51:17] and he killed those nurses three of them
[1:51:19] and I saw their bodies just come down
[1:51:21] and their body parts flying everywhere
[1:51:24] I was a boy there's so many things I
[1:51:27] could tell you uh that that happened in
[1:51:30] my life but God protected me every and
[1:51:32] each and every time yes
[1:51:38] and now why not not why now
[1:51:42] don't think
[1:51:43] he brought me thus far to lead me you
[1:51:46] think he's brought you thus far to leave
[1:51:48] you no I don't fully understand
[1:51:50] everything but one thing I do know my
[1:51:53] Lord and Savior is Jesus Christ I do
[1:51:57] know one thing that I'm a part of this
[1:51:59] program of that that God has set in and
[1:52:02] I know that God had to send Malachi for
[1:52:05] because he had not sent a prophet I
[1:52:07] would be right out there with everybody
[1:52:09] else and I didn't look for this message
[1:52:11] this message came to me
[1:52:16] it came to me
[1:52:18] and that's what I love about it it's the
[1:52:21] way God presented this thing and came to
[1:52:23] me and even when I didn't understand
[1:52:25] things that were going wrong I I saw
[1:52:27] personalities here and personalities
[1:52:29] there I preached on that you know how
[1:52:31] people take the uh the the the original
[1:52:34] pair of jeans and then they stick their
[1:52:35] logos on it
[1:52:38] you've seen people put on their cars
[1:52:43] sign on it
[1:52:45] you know people do that that's what they
[1:52:48] did to this message
[1:52:49] all over I perhaps I did the same thing
[1:52:52] but I did it ignorantly
[1:52:54] but now that my eyes are opened there's
[1:52:57] only one to be glorified and that's
[1:52:58] Jesus Christ himself and I'm not taking
[1:53:01] from listen I can't even preach a
[1:53:03] message without the message
[1:53:04] I can't preach what I'm preaching when
[1:53:06] if I didn't have quotes or something to
[1:53:08] read or
[1:53:09] these are not my thoughts
[1:53:11] these thoughts came from Malachi 4 and
[1:53:13] Malachi 4 thoughts came from God
[1:53:17] y'all understand me it's all it all
[1:53:19] works together I'm not working against
[1:53:22] anything or anybody I'm just saying I
[1:53:25] know what this church needs and this
[1:53:28] church needs the Holy Ghost this church
[1:53:30] needs a refilling of God this church
[1:53:33] need a repentance this church need to
[1:53:35] move out of their carnality
[1:53:38] and come into the Christ I don't know I
[1:53:41] can't put you there but as long as I
[1:53:43] preach the word maybe somehow somebody
[1:53:45] in here getting salty and desire
[1:53:48] to do the right thing before the Lord
[1:53:51] on this coming Sunday before I forget
[1:53:55] I'll be going down to Iowa City again
[1:53:57] and
[1:53:58] by God's grace
[1:54:01] brother Lee Brother Ailey and sister Zoe
[1:54:05] will be engaged and so
[1:54:08] will be presenting them before the
[1:54:11] church
[1:54:12] my daughter Crystal will be re-baptized
[1:54:15] she's
[1:54:17] want to be baptized on Sunday so we'll
[1:54:20] come back from Iowa City to baptize her
[1:54:23] so if you know anybody that wants to be
[1:54:25] baptized we'll do it Sunday evening
[1:54:28] around 3 30 4 o'clock
[1:54:31] amen and so I'm thinking that we'll do
[1:54:33] it at the we haven't made reservation
[1:54:35] but we'll let everybody know where that
[1:54:37] will be done I didn't know what the
[1:54:39] place we were we can't have too many
[1:54:41] people so but we'll let you know on
[1:54:45] what they've done that's my daughter
[1:54:47] doing that
[1:54:48] I'm happy for
[1:54:51] because you know people think you
[1:54:54] shouldn't get re-baptized but sometimes
[1:54:57] it just helps you feel better because
[1:54:59] you feel like you're more serious than
[1:55:01] you were
[1:55:02] when you when you first got baptized and
[1:55:06] as long as repentance is there
[1:55:08] it's it's it's it won't do you no harm
[1:55:11] God knows your heart
[1:55:14] and I don't hinder people from doing
[1:55:16] that now if you want to get baptized
[1:55:18] every year that's out
[1:55:20] we don't do stuff like that
[1:55:22] right so but but my daughter has gone
[1:55:25] through a lot of things in her life and
[1:55:27] she's really serious about what she's
[1:55:28] doing and she's doing her best I mean
[1:55:31] she's really moving forward and so she
[1:55:34] felt led to do that and I said okay
[1:55:36] we'll do that
[1:55:37] amen so he loved the Lord
[1:55:40] amen we asked the song lead to come and
[1:55:43] lead us in a word of
[1:55:46] song or two
