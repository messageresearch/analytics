[36:06] amen we thank god for his grace and his

[36:10] appreciate the lord jesus christ
[36:13] we're just going to get right into the
[36:14] word of god
[36:22] as we stand we're going to ask that you
[36:24] turn with us to
[36:26] matthew 24.
[36:31] and then we're going to ask that you
[36:33] turn on so
[36:34] the song of solomon the second
[36:38] chapter there matthew 24.
[36:51] we began to read at the 36th verse
[36:55] we read down to the 39th
[37:13] but of that day and hour knoweth no man
[37:18] no not the angels of heaven
[37:21] but my father only
[37:23] but as the days of noah were
[37:27] so shall also the coming of the son of
[37:30] man be
[37:32] for as in the days that were before the
[37:34] flood they were eating
[37:36] and drinking
[37:37] and marrying and giving in marriage
[37:41] until the day that noah entered into the
[37:43] ark
[37:47] and knew not
[37:49] until the flood came
[37:51] and took them all away so shall also the
[37:54] coming
[37:55] of the son of man be
[37:58] one more scripture reading
[38:00] from the songs of solomon
[38:12] beginning at the 14th first
[38:22] oh my dove
[38:24] that art in the clefs of the rock
[38:28] in the secret places
[38:30] of the stairs
[38:32] let me see that countenance
[38:35] let me hear thy voice
[38:38] for sweet is thy voice
[38:41] and the continent is calmly
[38:44] take up the foxes
[38:46] the little foxes that spoil the vines
[38:49] for our vines have tender grapes
[38:53] my beloved is mine
[38:56] and i am his
[38:58] he feedeth among the lilies
[39:01] until the day break
[39:02] and the shadows flee away
[39:05] turn my beloved
[39:08] and be like thou like a row
[39:11] or a young heart
[39:13] upon the mountains of ether
[39:16] let us pray
[39:18] dear heavenly father god we come before
[39:20] you lord
[39:23] as humbly as we know how
[39:26] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[39:28] you for your grace
[39:31] we thank you for being so good to us
[39:34] and we pray that you would have
[39:37] preeminence this morning
[39:40] lord we pray that you would
[39:42] break every yoke of the enemy
[39:46] lord we pray that your holy spirit will
[39:49] get glory here this morning
[39:51] and we'll be careful to give you the
[39:53] praise glory and honor
[39:55] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[39:58] you may be seated
[40:01] i don't know it's a little chilly in
[40:03] here for me
[40:06] and i'd like some water please
[40:14] we're living
[40:15] in the last moments
[40:17] i'm sorry yes there's some thank you
[40:20] we're living in the last moments
[40:23] of history
[40:28] many of us have been
[40:31] selected
[40:38] by god
[40:39] yes amen
[40:45] we thank god for
[40:47] his amazing grace
[40:53] even though we have been
[40:55] selected
[40:57] the bible tells us that many a call
[41:00] and few
[41:01] have been chosen
[41:07] what can we do
[41:10] what can we say
[41:14] only god give ears to hear
[41:18] and eyes to see
[41:22] we can be in a position where we
[41:26] are looking at something straight face
[41:30] and yet be blind to it
[41:35] how many times we've searched for things
[41:38] in our lives
[41:40] maybe uh car keys
[41:45] or wallet or whatever and then we find
[41:47] that the very thing that we're searching
[41:49] for is
[41:50] right in your hand
[41:55] and i trust this morning that the
[41:57] message that we bring
[42:01] will do something in the hearts of all
[42:03] of us
[42:06] i would title this message
[42:08] the whole world lies
[42:11] in wickedness
[42:16] but god has called us to be
[42:18] a witness
[42:21] of light and truth
[42:26] and the only way that we can be a
[42:28] witness we must be separate
[42:30] we must be different
[42:33] we must be
[42:34] living living epistles
[42:37] written and read of all men
[42:43] the bible tells us that we would be
[42:46] when the when when he when he should
[42:48] come again excuse me
[42:50] it would be in a time like
[42:53] it was in the days of noah
[42:58] where they were eating and drinking and
[43:00] marrying and giving him marriage
[43:04] brother branham talked about that given
[43:06] in marriage he says
[43:07] marrying over and over again
[43:12] and it was such a time where the bible
[43:14] said that they could not recognize what
[43:16] hour they were living in
[43:18] mind you
[43:20] it was not a time when
[43:23] noah wasn't preaching
[43:26] noah preached 120 years and he was able
[43:29] to tell them that
[43:31] god's judgment was at hand
[43:33] amen
[43:34] but in that day even though they heard
[43:36] the word of a prophet they could not
[43:38] comprehend it
[43:41] they could not see it
[43:44] they could not hear it
[43:46] and the bible tells us
[43:49] it was going to be that kind of a day
[43:53] many times we
[43:55] think that being a church member
[43:58] qualifies us for the escape
[44:03] but the only way that we can escape
[44:06] in this day
[44:09] is that we must hear the voice of god
[44:14] not only just we we must hear it
[44:17] but we also must be obedient
[44:22] for the bible tells us that no unclean
[44:25] thing will enter into that city
[44:32] missed your voice
[44:36] we appreciate you
[44:38] glad to see you sister
[44:41] we um
[44:44] know that in the last days
[44:50] it's going to be a few
[44:56] and for some reason i think that among
[44:58] this message we think because
[45:03] we can quote william branham
[45:06] we know we're the thing to quotes
[45:13] we've come out of organizations and
[45:15] denominations
[45:19] but we have also been warned that it is
[45:21] not just a coming out
[45:24] it's a going in
[45:28] songs of solomon talks about the little
[45:30] foxes that spoil the vine
[45:32] and it means exactly what it says
[45:35] those little things that you think
[45:37] doesn't matter with god matters
[45:43] we're at a time amen that we need to
[45:45] understand that
[45:48] the number gets fewer
[45:51] and fewer
[45:53] as the time
[45:55] goes on smaller and smaller
[46:01] we're at a time when
[46:03] the message have changed
[46:07] from a place of brotherly kindness
[46:12] to divine love
[46:16] you see the seven church age
[46:19] was the
[46:20] the the example
[46:24] of brotherly kindness
[46:27] but we find that even in that age
[46:31] the love of many wacks cold
[46:36] you might as well sit back and relax
[46:38] because i'm going to take my time this
[46:40] morning
[46:45] we're at a time
[46:48] when
[46:49] we we see
[46:51] many falling away
[46:55] oh they come to church
[46:58] but the love of god is gone
[47:01] and the love for god is gone
[47:05] and they sit there
[47:07] as empty shells
[47:10] pretending to be alive
[47:13] when spiritually they're dead
[47:16] even the scripture says you got to be
[47:18] careful
[47:20] that you bear not a name that you live
[47:22] but yet you are dead
[47:28] we are the time where the seals have
[47:29] been opened
[47:32] and god has made a turn
[47:36] the whole creation as the bible says
[47:39] waits for the manifestation
[47:43] of the sons of god
[47:46] not one word of god shall fail
[47:51] not one word of god shall fail
[47:56] everything that have been spoken
[47:58] will
[47:59] come to pass
[48:03] we have been told by the scripture
[48:07] that the day that we're living in
[48:10] was to repeat itself
[48:14] we also talked was told that god would
[48:17] send another prophet
[48:21] a prophet somewhat like noah
[48:25] who would prepare a way of escape
[48:30] we've been told that god would send us
[48:33] malachi 4.
[48:36] and malachi 4
[48:38] uh mission was to turn the hearts of the
[48:41] children back to the fathers
[48:43] in the heart of the fathers back to the
[48:45] children
[48:49] and that turning was to bring us back to
[48:52] the true revelation of the word of god
[48:57] in the church ages we learn
[49:01] that men
[49:03] probed
[49:05] at what was truth
[49:09] and in so doing they left a lot of loose
[49:12] ends
[49:14] but in the ministry of
[49:16] malachi 4 he was going to tie up all the
[49:19] loose ends
[49:22] and that god out of a church
[49:25] would
[49:26] bring out
[49:28] his bride
[49:33] if we look at matthew 24 24 we find out
[49:37] that even in this last day there will be
[49:40] impersonators
[49:42] those who would be anointed
[49:45] but of the wrong seed
[49:49] because of their wrong message
[49:54] brother branham said that one of the
[49:56] ways of describing or or characterizing
[50:00] a true messenger
[50:03] is that when he comes
[50:06] he would bring a new message
[50:10] he would bring something different from
[50:12] the old school
[50:15] and he said if that person would bring
[50:18] claim to be something and bring the same
[50:21] kind of a message
[50:24] he said don't believe them
[50:28] you and i must understand that this is a
[50:30] serious time
[50:34] something the lord spoke to my heart
[50:35] yesterday
[50:39] he told me how many people are still
[50:41] watching the television
[50:46] and he said the television is a portal
[50:48] to hell
[50:52] you don't have to believe it that's why
[50:53] brother branham said he wouldn't have
[50:55] one in his house
[50:58] yet many of us have these things and we
[51:00] expect to make a rapture
[51:05] may god have mercy
[51:07] coming from the message and i'm going to
[51:10] take my time
[51:11] the anointed one at the end time
[51:16] the prophet god says notice the very day
[51:19] when this messenger
[51:21] not when he starts on
[51:23] but when he begins to declare his
[51:25] message see
[51:28] the first pull is healing
[51:30] the second pull is prophecy
[51:32] the
[51:33] the third pull the opening of the word
[51:37] the mysteries revealed
[51:40] no more there is no more higher order to
[51:44] reveal the word
[51:46] than prophets
[51:48] so what are you saying brother i'm
[51:50] saying we have come to the the height
[51:54] of all of the church ages
[51:56] so much so amen the word of god said
[51:59] they cannot be completed without us
[52:03] there's a special work that the bride
[52:05] must do
[52:08] you and i must understand that god did
[52:10] not call us into religion
[52:13] he called us into life
[52:19] hallelujah
[52:20] no more
[52:21] there is no more higher order to reveal
[52:24] the word than prophets
[52:27] but the only way the prophet can be
[52:30] vindicated is by the word
[52:33] and remember the third pull
[52:36] was the opening of them seven seals
[52:39] to reveal the hidden truths
[52:43] that have been sealed in the word
[52:47] i often wonder
[52:49] when brother branham saw the preview of
[52:52] the church
[52:54] where that actually fell
[52:56] and what place did that fall into
[53:01] somehow it it looked like it was at a
[53:04] time when the rapture was about to take
[53:06] place
[53:09] because he saw each age
[53:12] marching twisting whatever they were
[53:16] doing
[53:18] but every one of those churches
[53:22] proclaimed to be the bride
[53:26] i can remember amen at the end of it he
[53:28] said here was miss america
[53:33] twisting and turning
[53:35] uh to the rock and roll
[53:37] miss america now
[53:40] he didn't call a bride he said miss
[53:42] america
[53:44] and as she went on
[53:48] we are told that by way of his vision
[53:51] she dropped off
[53:53] she didn't go up
[53:54] she went down
[53:58] she was so naked
[54:01] in the eyes of god
[54:03] all she had was a a piece of gray paper
[54:06] in the front of her
[54:08] i know this violin is vulgar but it must
[54:11] be sad
[54:14] because we know who strips the woman
[54:19] is always the preacher
[54:24] the preacher that's not called by god
[54:28] the preacher that adds or take away from
[54:30] the word
[54:32] the preacher who is anointed by lucifer
[54:37] hello somebody
[54:39] and you and i must realize by god's
[54:41] grace
[54:43] we're living as the prophet god said in
[54:45] the most deceptive age
[54:48] ever lived
[54:50] that's why god tells us to watch and
[54:53] pray
[54:54] amen
[54:57] when it when it looks like all hope was
[55:00] gone
[55:03] then here comes a little bride
[55:06] marching to the word
[55:09] amen then there were places that he he
[55:12] said she marched to the tune of onward
[55:15] christian soldier
[55:18] he said she was beautifully dressed
[55:22] she had on sleeves
[55:26] her dress wasn't tight it was loose
[55:28] fitting
[55:30] the dress went down to the ankle
[55:34] now you say well brother that doesn't
[55:35] make any difference on how i dress it
[55:38] does
[55:39] the bride of jesus christ will dress
[55:42] like the bride of jesus christ
[55:45] she will not dress like a street woman
[55:48] she will not be influenced by this lay
[55:51] of the sea and spirit
[55:54] she will always be faithful and true to
[55:57] her husband
[55:59] because when you get married marriage is
[56:01] a bond
[56:03] it is sacred
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] and the man amen he and he he vows to
[56:09] keep his body clean
[56:12] and pure
[56:14] and the woman likewise
[56:17] you say what brother does that mean
[56:19] anything it does
[56:21] because if we under the third pool and
[56:24] the word of god has been restored
[56:27] you and i must realize amen
[56:30] god
[56:31] is not accepting
[56:33] anything less
[56:35] than perfection
[56:38] somebody help me here this morning
[56:41] he is only accepting perfection
[56:46] and that perfection amen doesn't mean
[56:49] that i can spurn grace
[56:55] the grace of god has been given to us
[56:57] that we
[57:00] would learn how to live holy and
[57:02] righteous before god
[57:06] let me continue on with the quote
[57:09] it is then he says
[57:13] he said the third pool excuse me was the
[57:16] opening of the seven seals
[57:18] to reveal the hidden truths
[57:21] that been sealed in the word
[57:25] it is then in that day when these this
[57:28] thing is to take place
[57:31] one thing
[57:32] that janice and jambridge the
[57:35] impersonators will appear again
[57:39] just like they did when moses appeared
[57:42] with the original word
[57:44] to say it
[57:45] they appeared to impersonate it
[57:49] just exactly right
[57:51] now you see matthew 24 24 see anointed
[57:54] ones
[57:56] now there's three things we're going to
[57:58] say before we close
[58:00] this is it
[58:01] i want you to listen real close now as
[58:03] we close
[58:05] three
[58:06] things remember three things have been
[58:09] fulfilled
[58:10] three things lay before you right now
[58:13] first
[58:14] the world is in a sodom condition
[58:17] jesus said it would happen
[58:20] look at the perversion our women trying
[58:22] to act like men are men trying to act
[58:25] like women sissified rotten filthy low
[58:29] down devil possessed and don't know it
[58:33] the bible says that
[58:35] would happen
[58:36] and that's where it's at
[58:38] hallelujah
[58:40] secondly it's the hour according to the
[58:44] scripture here that janice and jamborees
[58:46] appear secondly
[58:49] thirdly it's the same hour that the son
[58:52] of man is to be revealed
[58:54] amen hallelujah now you and i must
[58:57] understand when we talk about the son of
[58:59] man we're not stopping at the william
[59:02] branham but is higher than he
[59:05] don't get me wrong
[59:07] he was a son of man
[59:09] revealing the son of man and we're
[59:12] coming to that
[59:13] because i think that we fail to see that
[59:16] when god opened up the seals
[59:19] there was a mysterious thing that took
[59:21] place
[59:22] a great thing
[59:25] and many of us are missing it
[59:27] hallelujah
[59:29] there is your believer
[59:31] your make-believer
[59:33] your unbeliever
[59:35] there's a genuide word standing
[59:39] out
[59:40] indicated
[59:42] there is the make-believer impersonating
[59:44] it and there is the unbeliever rejecting
[59:48] the whole thing it is a mating
[59:51] you can preach and preach and preach and
[59:53] preach and people are still come back
[59:56] looking the same way acting the same way
[59:59] doing the same way and don't even
[1:00:01] realize that there are literally
[1:00:03] uh displaying
[1:00:06] not the unbeliever
[1:00:08] not the uh make-believer but the
[1:00:10] unbeliever
[1:00:12] god also tells us that in that day there
[1:00:15] come a son of man y'all know that
[1:00:18] and that son of man will be god himself
[1:00:22] impersonated in a man
[1:00:25] amen hallelujah
[1:00:27] we have experience you say but the world
[1:00:30] doesn't know this is not for the world
[1:00:33] this is for the bride of jesus christ
[1:00:35] those who have been selected by god
[1:00:38] those who have been
[1:00:39] uh how can i say it
[1:00:41] predestinated by god
[1:00:44] everybody don't get it
[1:00:46] they can't
[1:00:48] they can't
[1:00:50] remember in jesus day
[1:00:53] a woman at the well who was a prostitute
[1:00:57] knew that he was the messiah
[1:01:00] and those who were
[1:01:02] under the the great uh illusion a
[1:01:05] delusion of the devil
[1:01:08] the great preachers of that day
[1:01:11] they called jesus
[1:01:12] beelzebub
[1:01:15] hallelujah what we need to do
[1:01:18] we need to ask god to teach us how to
[1:01:20] believe and to receive
[1:01:24] hallelujah see we know that there's only
[1:01:26] one who never needed teaching and that
[1:01:28] was jesus christ himself
[1:01:31] in spiritual food in due season brother
[1:01:33] branham amen says you don't need our
[1:01:35] teachings
[1:01:37] but we need yours lord
[1:01:39] so we pray that you'll teach us how to
[1:01:42] pray how to live and how to believe
[1:01:46] hallelujah that's what we need folks
[1:01:50] you and i must have rapturing faith
[1:01:53] and what we're working with right now
[1:01:55] amen can't even heal a toothache
[1:02:00] we're at a time amen that you and i must
[1:02:02] understand it's going to take more than
[1:02:04] church service
[1:02:07] religious acts
[1:02:09] hallelujah it's going to take a person
[1:02:12] whose faith is built
[1:02:15] day by day
[1:02:17] by way of prayer
[1:02:19] by way of reading
[1:02:21] by way of studying
[1:02:23] one of the worst things that we could
[1:02:25] all experience
[1:02:26] is that to be left behind
[1:02:29] having this revelation of the word
[1:02:32] understanding amen supposedly the
[1:02:34] revelation and then mr ship
[1:02:38] mr boat
[1:02:41] the bible tells us bill we ought to
[1:02:43] build up our whole holy faith
[1:02:46] look at what brother says amen in
[1:02:48] spiritual uh uh uh in due season
[1:02:52] food and due season
[1:02:53] he said i want you to get built up now
[1:02:57] this holy oracles of god
[1:02:59] in the faith
[1:03:01] the faith of this hour
[1:03:04] not yesterday's faith
[1:03:06] this faith
[1:03:08] the faith that's going to bring you into
[1:03:10] a divine love
[1:03:12] oh brotherly kindness we know how to be
[1:03:15] kind to each other
[1:03:16] but it doesn't stop there
[1:03:19] what worked for laodicea will not work
[1:03:21] for you
[1:03:22] because you and i are not in laodicea at
[1:03:24] least we're not supposed to be
[1:03:29] and i want you to get built up in this
[1:03:31] holy oracles of god in the faith
[1:03:35] the faith of this hour the faith
[1:03:38] is going to take more faith than ever
[1:03:40] was in any age did y'all hear him amen
[1:03:45] but this has to be rapturing faith
[1:03:49] to be taken up
[1:03:51] and so we want you to believe tonight in
[1:03:54] all that you have seen
[1:03:56] heard the word
[1:03:58] that you have heard preached
[1:04:00] the signs and the wonders that you have
[1:04:03] seen done
[1:04:04] we want you to accumulate
[1:04:07] all that together in your heart
[1:04:10] and consider it
[1:04:12] whether if god be
[1:04:14] whether if that be god or not
[1:04:18] you got to see it it's not just you know
[1:04:20] looking at the prophet god says well god
[1:04:22] was in him but god did not stop there
[1:04:26] he does not stop there
[1:04:28] hallelujah
[1:04:30] god looking for witnesses
[1:04:33] those who could be
[1:04:34] a witnessers those who could be a
[1:04:36] witness for him
[1:04:39] remember elijah amen was a man the bible
[1:04:42] said he was a man of like passion
[1:04:45] that means he had problems in his flesh
[1:04:47] too
[1:04:48] but at the time he was on earth this
[1:04:50] elijah
[1:04:52] walked so well with god hallelujah he
[1:04:55] spoke like god
[1:04:57] hallelujah is that right he said
[1:04:59] there'll be no do no rain until i called
[1:05:03] for it
[1:05:04] and it happened just like that
[1:05:07] hallelujah is that all right
[1:05:09] joshua was called by god is that right
[1:05:13] and he spoke like god
[1:05:15] one day when the enemy was getting the
[1:05:17] best of israel
[1:05:19] he said son stand still
[1:05:22] what was it he had a relationship with
[1:05:25] god so much amen he just got behind
[1:05:28] himself and the word of god spoke
[1:05:31] through him
[1:05:32] this is the kind of reflection god wants
[1:05:35] to see in us
[1:05:37] these men were just part of the book
[1:05:41] god didn't tell us to eat part of the
[1:05:43] book
[1:05:44] he told us to eat the whole book
[1:05:46] that means the power of the whole book
[1:05:49] supposed to be in us
[1:05:51] hallelujah yep sir that's the truth
[1:05:54] glory to god you and i are supposed to
[1:05:56] reflect christ the same yesterday today
[1:06:01] and forever
[1:06:02] hallelujah we can't say it's just for
[1:06:04] this day we must reflect jesus christ
[1:06:08] the same yesterday today
[1:06:11] today
[1:06:13] today and forever
[1:06:15] hallelujah is that right this is what
[1:06:18] this message come to do
[1:06:20] it come to produce sons and daughters of
[1:06:23] god
[1:06:24] hallelujah and we're supposed to be
[1:06:26] reflection of our age which is an
[1:06:29] invisible age which is an age that only
[1:06:33] you and i can see
[1:06:35] somebody help me here you and i can only
[1:06:38] we're the ones who see this age we're
[1:06:40] the one that's in this age and therefore
[1:06:42] we're supposed to reflect this age
[1:06:47] like i said
[1:06:49] when jesus was on the scene
[1:06:52] they didn't care about
[1:06:55] in other words the first pool
[1:06:58] and the second pool of his ministry
[1:06:59] didn't mean much
[1:07:02] oh oh they like all the good things
[1:07:04] they didn't mind him feeding poor
[1:07:07] they didn't mind him turning water into
[1:07:09] wine and doing all the miracles
[1:07:12] but when he began to reflect the god
[1:07:15] that sent him
[1:07:16] when he began to reflect the god that
[1:07:18] was in him that's when they had trouble
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:23] saint john 10 30 when jesus said i and
[1:07:26] the father are one
[1:07:28] hallelujah that was the thing amen the
[1:07:32] world could not see they couldn't
[1:07:34] understand it
[1:07:36] and you and i
[1:07:37] must come to a place
[1:07:39] where we say i and jesus christ is one
[1:07:43] that's my husband
[1:07:45] that's my savior that's my redeemer my
[1:07:49] point is amen don't die the way you are
[1:07:54] the most frightening thing amen is for a
[1:07:58] lot of people to
[1:08:00] to how can i say most people won't grasp
[1:08:02] it they can't comprehend it because they
[1:08:05] say because i call on jesus i'm saved
[1:08:09] oh what a deception
[1:08:11] oh because i belong to the message
[1:08:13] brother madam said listen that's not the
[1:08:15] way you say it
[1:08:19] no it's not like i'm in the message
[1:08:22] it means no the message is in me
[1:08:25] i am the message
[1:08:28] and that's what you and i must come we
[1:08:30] must come to a place where we can truly
[1:08:32] say i am the message
[1:08:36] is that right
[1:08:37] it proves that you have eaten the book
[1:08:40] think about the number of christians so
[1:08:43] called that is now in hell
[1:08:46] hello oh you don't preach hell in the
[1:08:48] message you know because everybody think
[1:08:50] they're going to heaven
[1:08:51] what a deception
[1:08:53] what a deception
[1:08:55] think about it people paul said i have
[1:08:57] to be careful
[1:08:59] lest i myself become a castaway an angel
[1:09:03] of god
[1:09:04] the first church angel messenger said i
[1:09:07] must be careful
[1:09:08] lest i become a castaway
[1:09:13] hallelujah
[1:09:14] come on somebody what is the that's
[1:09:16] that's that to me
[1:09:20] oh that's uh
[1:09:22] hell in itself
[1:09:25] think about it
[1:09:27] the number of christians
[1:09:29] who are in hell
[1:09:32] because they didn't want to go all the
[1:09:34] way with the word
[1:09:40] okay
[1:09:42] we're living in an evil day
[1:09:44] when the whole world is wicked
[1:09:51] people think wickedness means just going
[1:09:53] out and doing a lot of wicked things
[1:09:56] but being wicked in the eyes of god
[1:09:59] is not using the talents that in which
[1:10:01] he has given you
[1:10:05] hello
[1:10:06] being wicked in the eyes of god
[1:10:09] that if he gave you one talent you
[1:10:11] figure you're going to bury it
[1:10:15] being wicked in the eyes of god
[1:10:18] is when you cannot forgive
[1:10:22] somebody help me here it's the truth
[1:10:26] remember the man amen who god had
[1:10:28] already been forgiven he was a christian
[1:10:30] but he came to a place he could not
[1:10:32] forgive his enemy
[1:10:34] and when he could not forgive his enemy
[1:10:36] amen he taught
[1:10:38] him he made his enemy feel bad
[1:10:42] he treated him wrongfully
[1:10:44] and the word got back to god
[1:10:47] hallelujah you know what god did
[1:10:50] everything that he had forgave and given
[1:10:52] that man fought he put it back on his
[1:10:55] debt

[1:11:38] in the way that it's moving it's going

[1:11:44] pressure you all think you're in the
[1:11:45] pressure now but this is nothing

[1:12:07] understand the word of god said god has
[1:12:09] never left himself without a witness
[1:12:13] hallelujah
[1:12:15] a witness is somebody who's been there
[1:12:18] a witness is somebody who has had the
[1:12:20] experience
[1:12:22] of being there
[1:12:23] a witness is not going it's not to go
[1:12:26] off of what someone else has said
[1:12:29] but you have had the experience yourself
[1:12:34] and understand what god is doing we are
[1:12:36] living in what we call
[1:12:39] the era of the feast of the tabernacles
[1:12:42] where god will come down
[1:12:45] and embody
[1:12:46] himself in you
[1:12:48] in the spiritual food in due season
[1:12:50] we're living under a message where god
[1:12:53] is saying i want to occupy your body
[1:12:57] hallelujah that's where we are i want to
[1:13:00] be one with you
[1:13:01] hallelujah not some church system
[1:13:04] i called you out of the church system so
[1:13:07] that i could have fellowship and an
[1:13:09] intimate relationship with you
[1:13:12] god did not call us here amen to waste
[1:13:15] our time
[1:13:16] that's what we call lukewarmness
[1:13:20] when you don't take the hour serious
[1:13:23] enough
[1:13:25] coming from the spiritual food in due
[1:13:27] season he said but he embodied talking
[1:13:29] about god himself take in your body
[1:13:33] and my body
[1:13:34] and gives you gifts
[1:13:36] give me gifts
[1:13:38] and through these gifts he makes himself
[1:13:41] known
[1:13:43] he said that's
[1:13:44] the secret food remember brother adam
[1:13:47] was told to store up the food
[1:13:50] and by storing up the food while the
[1:13:53] whole world is famished
[1:13:56] they're in a famine
[1:13:58] you go you go hear a preacher amen on tv
[1:14:02] or whatever the case may be he's still
[1:14:04] preaching the same thing he's been
[1:14:05] preaching for 30 years
[1:14:08] the organization i came out of that's
[1:14:11] all he knows acts 2
[1:14:12] 38. they don't know nothing else
[1:14:17] are we to be that way
[1:14:20] with every change
[1:14:23] with every age there's always a
[1:14:25] different message
[1:14:27] not taken away from that which has
[1:14:29] already come but adding to it
[1:14:33] hallelujah
[1:14:34] god didn't take away from laodicea he
[1:14:37] added to it
[1:14:40] and i'm gonna get to that in just a
[1:14:41] minute because i plan not to be too much
[1:14:44] longer
[1:14:45] but because i i want us to understand
[1:14:48] that something took place in our day and
[1:14:50] and if we don't follow jesus
[1:14:53] we're gonna miss it
[1:14:56] hallelujah let me get back to the quote
[1:14:59] that's the secret foods
[1:15:01] no matter how much he would make himself
[1:15:03] known by me
[1:15:05] you've got to believe it
[1:15:07] and you've got to have a gift of faith
[1:15:10] to to believe it
[1:15:13] you believe that
[1:15:14] and now he said he will manifest himself
[1:15:18] in that manner
[1:15:20] will you believe
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:23] well all with all your heart you believe
[1:15:26] him
[1:15:27] oh how wonderful and just waiting on him
[1:15:30] just waiting to see what he says
[1:15:34] is that right you say well what do you
[1:15:35] mean if this is another message when i
[1:15:37] say another message a plus to it i add
[1:15:40] to it to bring it into a whole
[1:15:44] because jesus christ is the fullness of
[1:15:46] the world
[1:15:47] hallelujah we thought amen that
[1:15:50] that that what we receive and
[1:15:52] let me say it like this do you realize
[1:15:54] when brother branham was here
[1:15:56] and the seals were open
[1:15:59] hardly anyone understood what he was
[1:16:01] saying
[1:16:03] you know what he said
[1:16:05] you're not getting it
[1:16:06] know why
[1:16:08] it wasn't given for you to get it
[1:16:11] it was for the people to come
[1:16:15] hallelujah
[1:16:16] the people that was with moses
[1:16:19] they didn't get it
[1:16:22] hallelujah it was for those who was to
[1:16:25] come
[1:16:27] and the people that crossed over the
[1:16:29] jordan
[1:16:31] never knew moses
[1:16:36] it was a new generation
[1:16:38] it was a new people
[1:16:40] hallelujah come on somebody
[1:16:43] you and i must realize by the grace of
[1:16:45] god oh my god
[1:16:54] how can i say it
[1:16:59] peter didn't know john the baptist
[1:17:03] but it was peter who got the revelation
[1:17:05] of jesus christ
[1:17:10] y'all better understand what i'm saying
[1:17:13] listen let's go on man so you can
[1:17:15] understand this message is to identify
[1:17:17] who
[1:17:18] jesus christ
[1:17:20] john said
[1:17:21] is that right john said i must decrease
[1:17:24] he must increase
[1:17:26] now i'm going to say a lot of things i
[1:17:27] got quotes for him but i'm going to say
[1:17:29] a lot of things so you can fully
[1:17:30] understand what i'm saying
[1:17:34] in 1933
[1:17:36] brother branham was baptizing
[1:17:38] on the river
[1:17:41] ohio river
[1:17:43] remember the number 33
[1:17:45] because during that time amen here comes
[1:17:47] a light
[1:17:49] and this light comes down and
[1:17:52] says as john the baptist forerunned the
[1:17:54] first coming of christ
[1:17:57] so will your message
[1:18:00] right thousands of people heard it the
[1:18:02] newspaper took a clipping
[1:18:07] is that right
[1:18:09] with all of that happening
[1:18:11] only a few people really saw and
[1:18:13] understood what was happening
[1:18:15] now mind you not even brother branham
[1:18:17] knew where he was headed
[1:18:19] so many things he did not know and
[1:18:21] understand even as a boy
[1:18:23] but god moved within him and began to
[1:18:26] lead him and began to prime him
[1:18:29] if i could say
[1:18:31] before the seven seals were open
[1:18:34] is that right and then brother madam
[1:18:36] goes on and says 33 years later
[1:18:41] he shows up again
[1:18:44] because remember amen brother oh let me
[1:18:46] read this because i'm jumping
[1:18:48] if we
[1:18:51] oh help me lord
[1:18:52] if you go in you don't have to turn
[1:18:56] but you'll find out that god did
[1:18:57] something
[1:18:59] and here is john let me let me let me go
[1:19:01] to the scripture here quickly john 1
[1:19:04] beginning at the 29th first he said the
[1:19:06] next day john see jesus
[1:19:08] coming unto him and said behold the lamb
[1:19:10] of god would taketh away the sins of the
[1:19:13] world
[1:19:14] this is he whom i said after me cometh a
[1:19:17] man which is preferred before me
[1:19:20] for he was what before me
[1:19:23] i and i and i knew him not
[1:19:27] but that he should be made manifesting
[1:19:29] israel therefore am i come baptizing
[1:19:32] with water
[1:19:34] now it's amazing that john and jesus
[1:19:37] were relatives
[1:19:39] elizabeth and mary knew each other and
[1:19:42] somehow john never knew him
[1:19:46] you see what it is no doubt they you
[1:19:48] know the scripture doesn't say this but
[1:19:49] somehow relations could have been
[1:19:52] but john never seen him as the messiah
[1:19:56] because you got to realize amen that
[1:19:58] john says listen the only time i
[1:20:00] recognized him is when the pillar fire
[1:20:03] appeared above his head because that was
[1:20:06] the instructions from god
[1:20:08] the one that you see the pillar fire
[1:20:10] come above his head that is the one that
[1:20:12] is the messiah
[1:20:15] and john said i knew him not
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] now watch this 1933 the pillow fire does
[1:20:23] what
[1:20:24] comes above the prophet
[1:20:27] people see it
[1:20:28] they heard a voice
[1:20:32] and they could not recognize and did not
[1:20:34] see that all of that was scriptural
[1:20:38] what was it god veiled behind human
[1:20:41] flesh
[1:20:43] john built records saying i saw the
[1:20:46] spirit listen let me go back to the 31st
[1:20:48] verse and i knew him not
[1:20:50] but
[1:20:51] excuse me but he should be made manifest
[1:20:54] to israel therefore i am come baptizing
[1:20:57] with water
[1:20:58] and john that record
[1:21:01] saying i saw the spirit descending from
[1:21:04] heaven like a dove and it evolved upon
[1:21:07] him
[1:21:08] in other words that pill of fire was his
[1:21:10] identification amen it identified now i
[1:21:15] know who the messiah is
[1:21:17] but remember john even got a little
[1:21:19] scare uh uh
[1:21:21] a little dim in his eyesight
[1:21:23] because pressure made him do that
[1:21:26] here he was getting ready to die
[1:21:28] harold was going to take his head off
[1:21:30] and he sends a message
[1:21:32] to jesus are you the one
[1:21:36] it's kind of sound familiar kind of the
[1:21:38] same thing mary did you know
[1:21:40] she denounced her her visitation from
[1:21:43] god and here john now is denouncing his
[1:21:45] visitation from god are you the one
[1:21:48] or should i look for another
[1:21:50] and jesus could have easily said i am he
[1:21:53] but he said go tell john
[1:21:56] you go tell john amen i've cast out
[1:21:58] devils the lame is walking the blind the
[1:22:02] blind is seeing the dumb is talking in
[1:22:04] other words i'm going to give you a
[1:22:06] messiah sign i'm going to give you
[1:22:08] something that john can say it's in
[1:22:11] action
[1:22:12] hallelujah that's why i don't understand
[1:22:15] why people can say william branham is
[1:22:16] not the messenger of this day
[1:22:18] i can't understand it amen why amen that
[1:22:21] they they say he's not the seventh angel
[1:22:23] messenger i don't understand it amen
[1:22:26] because all of the signs all of the
[1:22:28] wonders all of the things that god said
[1:22:31] he would do he did it
[1:22:34] hallelujah there has never been another
[1:22:36] one and there'll never be another one
[1:22:40] hallelujah but god is raising upper
[1:22:42] people
[1:22:45] amen
[1:22:46] that will cap off the ministry
[1:22:51] of william branham
[1:22:54] one thing i know about jesus christ he's
[1:22:56] not boring
[1:22:59] if you can be bored in church you need
[1:23:01] an experience
[1:23:06] that's right
[1:23:08] even brother branham gives a uh uh uh uh
[1:23:11] uh uh
[1:23:13] uh
[1:23:15] a little thought on on this he says for
[1:23:17] the first time he says for the first
[1:23:19] time i've ever seen him and i want you
[1:23:21] to understand this
[1:23:22] that brother adam has seen a image of
[1:23:24] jesus christ before
[1:23:27] but the one he saw in the cloud there
[1:23:30] was something happening that was
[1:23:31] different from the way he'd seen him
[1:23:33] before
[1:23:35] he said he looked like the head of
[1:23:36] hoffman
[1:23:39] i had never seen that before
[1:23:42] in billy sunday's tabernacle years later
[1:23:45] i saw it
[1:23:47] my house have never been without one of
[1:23:50] those pictures since
[1:23:52] then here in the skies watch where he's
[1:23:55] directing
[1:23:56] saying
[1:23:57] that the very god that i saw up in the v
[1:24:00] this vision out here
[1:24:02] just a little boy how many of y'all
[1:24:03] remember that time he saw jesus christ
[1:24:06] in the field
[1:24:08] and he said he was he was uh you know in
[1:24:10] midair
[1:24:12] and and and when brother turned around
[1:24:14] and he said jesus
[1:24:16] he said the next thing i know i was just
[1:24:18] weeping and crying he just lost time
[1:24:22] but let me go on
[1:24:23] he said there in the sky saying that the
[1:24:26] very god that i saw in this vision out
[1:24:28] here just a little boy out here by where
[1:24:32] by where the this school house stands he
[1:24:35] looked like that
[1:24:37] and here in the heavens 33 years later
[1:24:40] declared it
[1:24:42] that's
[1:24:43] that's it's the truth
[1:24:45] that the way he looks
[1:24:47] not some mystic something of somebody
[1:24:50] idea
[1:24:51] no he said now i saw him
[1:24:55] and that was the way he looked
[1:24:59] not some mystic idea he said i saw him
[1:25:04] not only did i see him in the field but
[1:25:05] i saw him that image amen in in in
[1:25:10] in the brother's house
[1:25:13] billy sundays
[1:25:15] so what are you saying the word comes to
[1:25:17] the prophet
[1:25:19] jesus was among all the pharisees
[1:25:21] sadducees he was among them he taught in
[1:25:23] that synagogue
[1:25:25] but it was john because he was a prophet
[1:25:27] who was able to identify that jesus
[1:25:31] was the messiah
[1:25:32] hallelujah y'all understand what i'm
[1:25:33] trying to say it took a prophet in this
[1:25:36] day
[1:25:37] to identify jesus christ
[1:25:40] and to identify what his coming amen
[1:25:46] oh god help us
[1:25:49] brother braham said i was baptizing them
[1:25:51] at the end of spring street
[1:25:53] in jeffersonville indiana in the ohio
[1:25:55] river
[1:25:56] when nearly seven or eight thousand
[1:25:58] people standing on the bank they bear
[1:26:01] witness that two o'clock at two o'clock
[1:26:04] in the evening june 1933 how that a
[1:26:07] pillar of fire come down out of heaven
[1:26:11] and hung over where i was standing
[1:26:14] the courier journey and the time news no
[1:26:17] it was it was he said oh i get the name
[1:26:19] of those papers just a minute if i could
[1:26:22] just think of it the louisville paper
[1:26:25] get a great article mystic light appears
[1:26:28] over local baptist
[1:26:30] evangelists while baptizing at the river
[1:26:32] very mystic thing people couldn't not
[1:26:35] understand it
[1:26:36] many fainted at the presence of it the
[1:26:38] angel of the lord come down right down
[1:26:41] and hung over where i was
[1:26:43] the louisville herald it is what it was
[1:26:46] louisville harold herald post of of of
[1:26:49] louisville he said that was the paper
[1:26:51] that caught the scene of it
[1:26:53] you know it it just seemed like he and
[1:26:56] john the baptist was was moving in the
[1:26:58] same direction
[1:27:00] what god did in john the baptist's life
[1:27:02] god also did in his life
[1:27:06] and you must understand that this thing
[1:27:08] didn't happen in a corner
[1:27:10] it was open show
[1:27:12] and most of the people missed it
[1:27:15] but this is the thing i'm coming to in
[1:27:16] just a moment and i'm closing
[1:27:19] see it's hidden
[1:27:21] and we'll look at this thing and we say
[1:27:22] oh brother oh i'm so glad i'm in the
[1:27:24] message and we just get an intellectual
[1:27:26] thing this thing make you need more than
[1:27:28] that
[1:27:30] this message must drop from the head to
[1:27:32] your heart from the from the this to
[1:27:33] your to your heart
[1:27:35] it must produce life
[1:27:38] and if it's not produced in life you
[1:27:40] need to pray before god until it does
[1:27:43] hallelujah
[1:27:45] you say
[1:27:46] why is that the message don't go out
[1:27:49] in these great big places
[1:27:51] these big
[1:27:52] crusades like amongst the denomination
[1:27:55] and let me tell you something every last
[1:27:57] one of us will have to give an account
[1:27:59] because of our attitude toward this
[1:28:01] message
[1:28:02] every one of us don't think you're going
[1:28:04] to get away with it
[1:28:05] god is looking at you right now he
[1:28:08] understands your very thought
[1:28:10] about what's being preached
[1:28:13] and one thing i'm going to tell you
[1:28:14] about one thing about god he could care
[1:28:16] less about what you think
[1:28:21] it's not their food
[1:28:23] it's not the church
[1:28:25] so calls food
[1:28:26] it's the bride food
[1:28:29] it's spiritual food in season so what
[1:28:32] are you saying why was it in
[1:28:35] when brother bannon was alive why did
[1:28:37] not they get what he was saying
[1:28:39] because it wasn't their season
[1:28:43] it wasn't their time
[1:28:45] god needed a new one a new generation a
[1:28:49] new group of people to cross over
[1:28:52] hallelujah like it was in the days of
[1:28:54] joshua is that right
[1:28:56] hallelujah
[1:28:57] it's not their food
[1:28:59] it's not the church so called food
[1:29:02] it's the bride food it's spiritual food
[1:29:05] and season
[1:29:06] it would make them sick at their stomach
[1:29:09] it's too rich for them
[1:29:11] you can't do it
[1:29:13] but for the children it's bread
[1:29:16] it's life
[1:29:18] it's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:29:20] today and forever
[1:29:22] he's going to get listen we're going to
[1:29:25] get too late
[1:29:27] if we don't start the prayer line now
[1:29:29] okay so let us bow our heads in just for
[1:29:32] a moment but let's let's move on dear
[1:29:34] god
[1:29:36] food and due season spiritual food
[1:29:39] something that the world knows nothing
[1:29:41] of
[1:29:43] we will hear our lord say that night or
[1:29:46] that day down there at the samaria
[1:29:48] the same place that elijah walked up and
[1:29:51] said why
[1:29:52] the dew will not fall till i call for it
[1:29:55] here stood jesus
[1:29:57] there
[1:29:58] telling the disciples
[1:30:00] says master
[1:30:02] why don't you eat
[1:30:04] he said i have food
[1:30:06] that you know not of
[1:30:08] truly lord his food was
[1:30:11] to do the will of god
[1:30:14] to see the works of god made manifest in
[1:30:17] his hour
[1:30:18] you know what food is it's a sustaining
[1:30:20] force
[1:30:21] it's a power that god has allowed to to
[1:30:24] give us strength to move on
[1:30:26] and what jesus said i've got to do god's
[1:30:28] will
[1:30:29] that's my that's my strength that's my
[1:30:32] power that's what makes me run that's
[1:30:34] what makes me operating
[1:30:36] y'all understand that's what makes me
[1:30:39] operate
[1:30:41] the message should make you operate
[1:30:43] it should be the thing that you yearn
[1:30:45] you eat you you you you hung the thor
[1:30:48] you thirst for it
[1:30:49] now i'm gonna tell you when i get
[1:30:51] irritated it's that's one place i get
[1:30:53] irritated in when i can't study like i
[1:30:55] want to
[1:30:57] when things get in my way that makes me
[1:30:59] irritable
[1:31:03] i love my private time with god
[1:31:06] i enjoy my private time
[1:31:10] somebody ought to say amen
[1:31:12] somebody ought to have some private time
[1:31:13] in here
[1:31:14] somebody should be able to witness back
[1:31:29] truly lord his food was to do his the
[1:31:32] will of god
[1:31:33] to see the work of god made manifest in
[1:31:35] his hour
[1:31:36] he was there to see that it was done
[1:31:40] i do nothing except my father show me
[1:31:43] what father showed me that i'll do in
[1:31:46] other words he was depending upon his
[1:31:48] whole thing was to do the father's will
[1:31:53] and we come to this message and the
[1:31:54] father's wheel is a million miles
[1:31:57] away from us
[1:31:58] and all we can think about is what i
[1:32:01] want to do
[1:32:02] it's not what you want to do
[1:32:04] you've been bought with a price and
[1:32:06] you're not your own
[1:32:08] you're supposed to sell your soul
[1:32:11] to this message
[1:32:12] because this message is jesus christ
[1:32:16] i don't care about what other people say
[1:32:18] it doesn't matter what you think
[1:32:21] the truth of the matter is you know i
[1:32:22] tried to tell people this i said see you
[1:32:25] guys are in a good place and position
[1:32:26] i'm in i'm in a pastoral position that
[1:32:29] means god is going to get me
[1:32:31] if i don't preach you truth
[1:32:33] god is going to get me
[1:32:35] so i don't care about how your facial
[1:32:37] expressions are that's what god told
[1:32:39] ezekiel don't be afraid of their faces
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:44] don't be afraid it doesn't matter
[1:32:46] whether you like me you can roll your
[1:32:47] eyes you can pout your mouth it doesn't
[1:32:49] matter i'm gonna preach what he wants me
[1:32:51] to preach
[1:32:53] you can take it or leave it
[1:32:55] i feel god not nobody in here
[1:33:02] no no no no um
[1:33:10] and father so is it today
[1:33:13] the church
[1:33:14] the true believer
[1:33:16] the body of believers has access to food
[1:33:20] spiritual food
[1:33:21] that no no uh nominals knows nothing
[1:33:25] about let me ask you a question how
[1:33:27] often do you listen to a tape or read a
[1:33:29] book
[1:33:31] what is your thing with this food
[1:33:35] you understand me
[1:33:36] are you really into the message or the
[1:33:39] message into you
[1:33:41] many times i'm preaching and sometimes
[1:33:43] you know
[1:33:44] i can't get a smile but no joy
[1:33:48] and most of the time people don't have
[1:33:50] joy because you don't have a revelation
[1:33:52] of grace
[1:33:54] gracious keeps a smile on your face
[1:33:57] grace keeps you with joy
[1:33:59] hallelujah because you realize the power
[1:34:02] of the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:05] hallelujah but when you are under law
[1:34:08] and you just think i can't do this i
[1:34:10] can't do that yes i preach things that
[1:34:13] you should not do but it shouldn't be
[1:34:15] because of the law it should be the if
[1:34:18] it is a law it must be the law of love
[1:34:23] i love him so i won't do it
[1:34:28] and father so is it today the church the
[1:34:31] true believer the body of believers has

[1:35:38] because i want you to understand that
[1:35:39] when god came down in 1963
[1:35:42] that was the beginning of the rapture
[1:35:46] hello
[1:35:47] and only my sheep
[1:35:50] heareth my voice
[1:35:52] this is what we call the mighty angel
[1:35:54] coming down he never went back he's here
[1:35:59] i'm not dismissing the the the coming of
[1:36:01] the corporate body that's not i'm not
[1:36:03] dismissing but what i'm trying to tell
[1:36:05] you is that when that mighty angel came
[1:36:07] down and listen brother balaam called he
[1:36:09] didn't know it himself did he did he
[1:36:11] know what was happening then not exactly
[1:36:14] oh you better not say that yeah
[1:36:17] the prophet god first said those angels
[1:36:20] those seven angels he kept pointing out
[1:36:22] the one with the swept back wings
[1:36:25] is that right he called him the angels
[1:36:27] of the lord
[1:36:29] right he saw the vision he saw the
[1:36:32] pyramid but he wasn't looking at it
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:35] two years later
[1:36:37] god comes to him and says turn it right
[1:36:42] and he turned the picture right he said
[1:36:43] oh
[1:36:45] there he is
[1:36:46] and you'll find out amen that he says
[1:36:49] that's my lord like john the baptist
[1:36:52] that's my lord
[1:36:54] john said behold the lamb of god that
[1:36:56] take away the sins of the world
[1:36:59] and saint john under the same anointing
[1:37:02] of elijah comes and he points it to the
[1:37:04] cloud oh god
[1:37:06] hallelujah he wasn't a lamb anymore he
[1:37:10] was a lion
[1:37:11] hallelujah
[1:37:13] he was supreme deity hallelujah
[1:37:18] that's my lord
[1:37:21] what was it
[1:37:24] he come for who
[1:37:25] rebecca
[1:37:27] he comes from rebecca
[1:37:30] he comes for you
[1:37:32] now how are you going brother brown said
[1:37:34] the camel in which rebecca road was the
[1:37:38] type of the holy ghost
[1:37:40] you can't meet elijah you can't meet god
[1:37:42] excuse me without the holy ghost
[1:37:45] you need something to ride on
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:49] amen and you know with the holy ghost
[1:37:52] it's an up and down ride
[1:37:54] you're out of camel amen it all depends
[1:37:56] on how many humps he's got and which one
[1:37:58] you're riding on hallelujah
[1:38:01] but the truth of the matter is it'll
[1:38:03] take you where you need to go
[1:38:06] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:38:10] hallelujah
[1:38:11] amen amen
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:15] we understand by god's grace
[1:38:18] he says now see
[1:38:20] you don't you don't know it
[1:38:22] jesus said the blind pharisee says
[1:38:25] if if the blind leaves the blind
[1:38:27] don't they both fall in the ditch
[1:38:30] see that's the reason those people don't
[1:38:32] see that see
[1:38:33] the mystery of it is
[1:38:35] those seals each one of those churches
[1:38:38] made an organization and got into it
[1:38:42] and that one that's one of the secret
[1:38:45] things that's been wrong before god see
[1:38:48] you see it dr lee see look it is that
[1:38:54] the thing
[1:38:55] right here there
[1:38:56] that one of the secrets
[1:38:58] they organized see
[1:39:01] and was completely out of the will of
[1:39:03] god
[1:39:05] hallelujah now i'm gonna bring it down
[1:39:06] to us because if we're just following a
[1:39:09] system
[1:39:12] a system is another way of organizing
[1:39:15] you got to have it like this you got to
[1:39:17] have it like that no sir where the
[1:39:19] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[1:39:24] it's not something that's going to pin
[1:39:26] you down when it comes to worship
[1:39:29] every man every woman every boy and girl
[1:39:32] is free to worship
[1:39:34] you're free to live like god wants you
[1:39:37] to live
[1:39:39] hallelujah
[1:39:40] but we've got so systematic
[1:39:43] and that system will bring you to a slow
[1:39:45] death
[1:39:47] holly is that right
[1:39:49] we're moving we're supposed to be listen
[1:39:51] people say we are no longer a
[1:39:52] pentecostal but god never took away the
[1:39:55] experience
[1:39:57] he never took away the joy of pentecost
[1:40:00] hallelujah every age is supposed to be a
[1:40:03] fold of us
[1:40:05] we're the completion of it you mean to
[1:40:08] tell me the greatest word ever hit the
[1:40:11] earth and we're not supposed to have joy
[1:40:14] something's wrong
[1:40:16] something's really wrong
[1:40:20] you mean to tell me you're going to let
[1:40:22] satan be greater than god
[1:40:26] that's what you're doing
[1:40:28] every time you allow satan to to hold
[1:40:32] you hold real listen to the words to
[1:40:34] hold you in a state of depression you
[1:40:37] are a witness to satan
[1:40:40] amen
[1:40:41] you're a witness to him
[1:40:44] and the bible's as great as he that's in
[1:40:46] us
[1:40:47] that he that is in the world honey is
[1:40:50] that okay
[1:40:51] listen to oh i ain't nobody come by my
[1:40:53] house nobody don't call me so what
[1:41:00] what that got to do with you
[1:41:04] is that right
[1:41:07] you need to learn how to encourage
[1:41:09] yourself in the lord
[1:41:13] hallelujah yes sir
[1:41:18] amen you stay in the word
[1:41:21] listen you can't find a friend i've got
[1:41:24] one that i'm going to suggest to you
[1:41:26] jesus christ
[1:41:27] he will stick closer to you than a
[1:41:29] brother
[1:41:32] i hear people like that all the time oh
[1:41:34] nobody don't hardly call me nobody don't
[1:41:36] come by and
[1:41:38] and i you know they don't love me and
[1:41:39] i'm like do you love them
[1:41:43] it works both ways
[1:41:45] you know you can get fellowship by
[1:41:47] leaving where you are and go find some
[1:41:49] right
[1:41:52] yeah
[1:41:52] you gonna stay in the house ain't nobody
[1:41:54] coming by do you go anywhere
[1:41:58] that's the truth
[1:42:00] if you need a friend call him up
[1:42:05] show up
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:09] none of us should be lonely or lonesome
[1:42:12] listen to not fellowship is a sin
[1:42:18] brother brandon what is fellowship two
[1:42:20] fellows in a ship
[1:42:23] not one two
[1:42:25] at least get you one other
[1:42:28] right
[1:42:30] and the truth of the matter is when you
[1:42:32] when the devil isolate you then you look
[1:42:34] at everybody else like the evil
[1:42:40] yeah yeah that's what the devil says
[1:42:42] there ain't no say they ain't right
[1:42:44] and you forget you ain't either
[1:42:49] you know it's the truth you know i'm
[1:42:51] going down here but that's the truth
[1:42:55] the bible says even like this when you
[1:42:58] see that day approaching come together
[1:43:00] the more that's when i know that people
[1:43:02] don't have a full revelation because
[1:43:04] you'll be sitting home on your couch
[1:43:06] eating a burger
[1:43:08] or something and church is going on
[1:43:13] but you got enough strength
[1:43:15] to go get you some chicken
[1:43:20] oh yeah yeah yeah yeah see i got all
[1:43:22] y'all now
[1:43:24] you don't got quiet business the truth
[1:43:26] is which which food is more important
[1:43:29] you're going to need this
[1:43:32] let me ask you a question what if the
[1:43:34] day you miss church because of
[1:43:35] slaughterness then god revealed
[1:43:38] something
[1:43:39] and you missed it
[1:43:42] at the day that you thought don't you
[1:43:44] ever think satan is stupid when satan
[1:43:47] dismisses you or causes you to miss
[1:43:49] church he's actually causing you to miss
[1:43:52] something that god has planned and
[1:43:54] prepared for you amen
[1:43:57] now that ain't not but the truth
[1:43:59] i've seen you know uh
[1:44:01] in my ministry i've seen people that god
[1:44:03] in other words god brings a message and
[1:44:05] the people are not there the main one
[1:44:07] that you don't need it
[1:44:09] they're not there
[1:44:12] something god the devil has done i'm
[1:44:13] almost done with this portion
[1:44:15] but god needs a witness
[1:44:18] and whenever it comes to be a witness
[1:44:20] i'm closing
[1:44:22] you're going to be in trouble
[1:44:25] god never causes you to be a witness
[1:44:28] without bringing opposition
[1:44:33] hallelujah
[1:44:36] is that right always and the bible said
[1:44:39] god has never left himself without a
[1:44:41] witness how many other are witnesses for
[1:44:43] a message for the message amen when me
[1:44:46] and those brothers went out to our
[1:44:47] graves lake and we sang and and praised
[1:44:50] the lord and and witnessed we had people
[1:44:51] come up we had people filming us we had
[1:44:53] people parked in their cars because they
[1:44:55] were too shame to get out
[1:44:58] hallelujah
[1:44:59] but one of the one of the people says
[1:45:01] listen
[1:45:02] we came and they they joined us they
[1:45:04] actually started singing with us and
[1:45:06] everything else they said we we we so
[1:45:08] appreciate your boldness
[1:45:12] how many christians got enough boldness
[1:45:14] now amen to stand on the corner to
[1:45:16] witness somebody about what you truly
[1:45:18] believe in
[1:45:20] you know what it is most of the time of
[1:45:22] us we want witness because we know that
[1:45:24] if we do witness maybe somebody out
[1:45:26] there has witnessed
[1:45:28] us
[1:45:30] they don't see you somewhere
[1:45:32] and they don't understand how can you be
[1:45:34] preaching about jesus and living another
[1:45:37] life
[1:45:39] help me jesus but when you know
[1:45:44] amen that your life is clear and your
[1:45:45] life is clean
[1:45:47] you don't have to worry about nobody
[1:45:48] stumbling across you
[1:45:51] hallelujah let me move on then these
[1:45:53] children talk about shadrach meshach and
[1:45:55] abednego god witnesses god has never
[1:45:59] been without a witness he has always now
[1:46:02] hear what i want to get this real close
[1:46:04] god has never at any time been without a
[1:46:07] witness on the earth he has always had a
[1:46:11] at least one man he could put his hand
[1:46:14] on
[1:46:15] that's what i'm saying if nobody else
[1:46:17] has got is a witness that's what i want
[1:46:19] to be
[1:46:20] e i don't go about i don't go off what
[1:46:23] everybody else is doing i just got to be
[1:46:25] that one
[1:46:27] hallelujah he has always had at least
[1:46:30] one man he could put his hands on say
[1:46:32] that's my witness
[1:46:34] it comes down to one man one time and
[1:46:37] job was his only witness and abraham in
[1:46:40] the land but god had a witness somebody
[1:46:43] is going to witness for god somewhere
[1:46:47] and sisters whenever you witness for god
[1:46:50] people even in this message going to
[1:46:52] thank you too you your old fogey
[1:46:56] girl i wouldn't listen to my husband
[1:46:59] like that
[1:47:01] y'all watch the company you keep
[1:47:04] anybody that's gonna influence you
[1:47:06] against your husband ain't right
[1:47:12] my
[1:47:15] you want god to love you unconditionally
[1:47:18] you need to learn how to love your
[1:47:19] husband unconditionally
[1:47:21] and he need to learn how to love you
[1:47:22] unconditionally
[1:47:24] hallelujah
[1:47:25] let me go let me hit this now because it
[1:47:27] came to my mind and every woman
[1:47:30] who's the boss of the house
[1:47:32] you are out of order
[1:47:40] a lot of people said
[1:47:41] that's why i tell you what that's why
[1:47:43] it's difficult to marry a woman that's
[1:47:45] making more money
[1:47:50] huh she's making more money you got
[1:47:52] something on your hand
[1:47:54] it's something when she ain't making
[1:47:55] that money that's our money
[1:47:58] that's our money
[1:48:00] but as soon as you get a little nice
[1:48:02] little job making a little bit more than
[1:48:03] you that's my money
[1:48:07] you know it ain't always it's not always
[1:48:10] like that but i've seen it
[1:48:12] i've seen it happen
[1:48:19] so that you'll know by god's grace when
[1:48:22] you allow things like that you got to
[1:48:24] stay with the word sisters
[1:48:26] you know what i'm saying if he ain't
[1:48:27] doing right you got to do like one of
[1:48:29] those old sayings like sarah did god
[1:48:33] handle him please
[1:48:35] put god on him
[1:48:37] god will make him right god will
[1:48:39] straighten him out
[1:48:41] but you know you just don't grab him in
[1:48:43] the collar when he comes through the
[1:48:44] door
[1:48:46] and yeah people do that too i ain't just
[1:48:48] preaching they grab them
[1:48:51] snatch them in while they're coming in
[1:48:55] i'm closing i'm closing i've seen it
[1:48:57] happen i'm telling you i've seen it
[1:48:58] happen even in the pentecostal church
[1:49:01] amen the
[1:49:02] i'm talking about a brother bigger than
[1:49:03] me and his wife like this
[1:49:05] right
[1:49:06] but every time he would come to church
[1:49:09] he knew he had to go home to a beating
[1:49:16] he had enough guard in him he wouldn't
[1:49:17] hit her back right and she took that as
[1:49:20] a witness a weakness
[1:49:22] and when he come home oh my he got it
[1:49:29] yeah
[1:49:32] we don't have nothing like that here
[1:49:33] though i'm sure
[1:49:36] you love the lord
[1:49:38] my point is it is hard to sometimes stay
[1:49:40] in position but you must stay in
[1:49:42] position in order to make a rapture
[1:49:46] you understand me sisters i know it's
[1:49:47] difficult you listen you know it doesn't
[1:49:50] mean because you the the the uh
[1:49:53] weaker vessel and you know what it
[1:49:54] doesn't mean that you're not smarter
[1:49:56] than your husband
[1:49:58] some sisters are smarter than their
[1:50:00] husbands
[1:50:02] even if the husband don't want to
[1:50:03] recognize it
[1:50:07] it's true
[1:50:08] they get intimidated because the sister
[1:50:10] no more
[1:50:11] hallelujah that's a gift brother if you
[1:50:14] use it in the right way you'll move
[1:50:17] forward
[1:50:19] you don't look at all your woman you
[1:50:20] can't tell me nothing you said you see
[1:50:22] you can't tell me that because i used to
[1:50:24] be that way
[1:50:26] i'm the head of the house you better
[1:50:27] know it
[1:50:30] right
[1:50:31] but then i learned things through my
[1:50:32] wife
[1:50:34] i understood things through my wife my
[1:50:36] wife had insight about people i didn't
[1:50:38] have
[1:50:39] said brother brooks that ain't your
[1:50:41] friend they using you and sure enough
[1:50:43] it'll come out just that way
[1:50:45] so i had to learn how to listen to her
[1:50:50] y'all you these brothers they smiling
[1:50:52] now so someone some won't even say amen
[1:50:54] but it doesn't matter
[1:51:00] god gave you the gift and you don't use
[1:51:01] it that's your fault that's your fault
[1:51:04] that's your fault
[1:51:05] you're losing out that's right brother
[1:51:06] you know what i'm talking about
[1:51:08] but the truth of the matter is we must
[1:51:10] understand we work together
[1:51:13] is that right some things jesus christ
[1:51:16] did not do because he left them here for
[1:51:18] us to do and we represent the woman
[1:51:24] you understand me
[1:51:26] so
[1:51:27] another little thing in closing
[1:51:29] i'm shutting this off
[1:51:32] understand if you miss the order of the
[1:51:34] word if you don't keep the order of the
[1:51:36] word you are allowing a perverted spirit
[1:51:40] to enter into your families
[1:51:44] is that right laodicea
[1:51:47] jezebel whoever you want to call her she
[1:51:50] she she removed her headship
[1:51:53] and look what her children look like
[1:51:56] look at all the perversion in her in her
[1:51:58] children because she rejected her
[1:52:01] headship
[1:52:04] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:52:06] what i'm trying to say is like we who
[1:52:08] are in the word we who are the message
[1:52:10] now some of us we can't help it we can't
[1:52:11] help
[1:52:12] certain things it's you know we got
[1:52:14] people here amen who who husband or
[1:52:16] spouses are not
[1:52:18] believers i'm not talking about that
[1:52:19] kind of situation i'm talking about
[1:52:21] believers
[1:52:23] those of us who profess to be believers
[1:52:27] y'all gonna go home and say don't y'all
[1:52:29] listen what brother brother say you'll
[1:52:30] get over there and you carry on like
[1:52:32] that and
[1:52:35] what i say go oh was in my house
[1:52:38] i don't care what the preacher said
[1:52:45] revelation who's preaching then
[1:52:48] whenever you get adopt that kind of
[1:52:49] attitude you don't have a revelation
[1:52:51] who's preaching
[1:52:52] i know who's saying these things
[1:52:55] and my point is this i have to give an
[1:52:57] account for everything i just said this
[1:52:58] morning
[1:53:00] and you and i must understand we're
[1:53:02] living in the last days
[1:53:04] and i want to be you know what made
[1:53:06] sarah the mother of of us is because she
[1:53:10] knew obedience she knew how to submit to
[1:53:11] herself until we understand the natural
[1:53:14] aspects of these things we ourselves
[1:53:16] will not understand the spiritual
[1:53:17] aspects
[1:53:18] we must submit to our headship which is
[1:53:21] the word amen and if we don't submit to
[1:53:23] the word we're not going to submit to
[1:53:25] one another that's just the way it is
[1:53:28] let's stand
[1:53:43] i don't take sides
[1:53:45] that's one thing about me i don't take
[1:53:46] sides
[1:53:49] so all all i want everybody to know
[1:53:51] because you might not like a brother not
[1:53:52] might like not like a sister don't mean
[1:53:55] i don't like them
[1:53:59] because i might be your friend you might
[1:54:01] feel like i shouldn't be with that
[1:54:02] person that's nonsense that's so
[1:54:04] childish very very very very childish
[1:54:08] we are body of christ
[1:54:10] and if there's anything hindering you
[1:54:14] from fellowshipping with anyone in this
[1:54:16] place
[1:54:17] there is
[1:54:19] a word we call
[1:54:22] repentance
[1:54:26] because you can't love god and hate your
[1:54:28] brother
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:31] won't work
[1:54:34] god puts certain obstacles in your way
[1:54:36] because he wants you to overcome them
[1:54:39] that's your test
[1:54:43] we're talking about the capstone
[1:54:44] ministry which is divine love
[1:54:48] what do you think satan going to do he's
[1:54:50] going to throw everything in your way to
[1:54:51] keep you from divine love
[1:54:54] and what keeps us from divine love
[1:54:57] is the demonic power of pride
[1:55:01] pride is one of the wickedest things
[1:55:05] anyone and everyone could have
[1:55:07] it doesn't matter who you are small
[1:55:09] great rich or poor if pride is in your
[1:55:12] life
[1:55:13] it will destroy you
[1:55:16] it'll keep you from having great
[1:55:18] relationships
[1:55:21] but i trust somehow something was said
[1:55:23] today because this is a wicked world
[1:55:26] everything is evil the way i thought i
[1:55:28] was going to go this morning god
[1:55:29] redirected me
[1:55:31] but the point is i wanted to say we're
[1:55:34] living in a world that's full of
[1:55:36] wickedness you don't have to go shopping
[1:55:38] for it it's out there
[1:55:42] the worst age ever
[1:55:45] i often think to myself if william
[1:55:47] branham was living here living now
[1:55:50] how would he behave
[1:55:51] i don't think he could
[1:55:54] if he almost fainted when he saw the
[1:55:56] church of america
[1:55:58] walking what would he
[1:56:01] see now and what do we see now i mean
[1:56:03] it's so amazing that people who are
[1:56:06] wearing their underwear undergarments
[1:56:08] out for
[1:56:09] outerwear
[1:56:11] and nobody thinks about it they don't
[1:56:13] even know they're naked
[1:56:15] i don't know how come it is but the only
[1:56:18] thing i could say is when they when they
[1:56:19] removed the word of god they removed the
[1:56:21] standard
[1:56:23] they removed that place that that kept
[1:56:25] people in check and when you leave that
[1:56:27] out out of your house
[1:56:29] uh
[1:56:30] expect satan to come
[1:56:34] last bout of word of prayer
[1:56:37] father god i i come before you lord as
[1:56:39] humble as i know how
[1:56:42] we're at a time that
[1:56:45] i i see you
[1:56:47] lord
[1:56:48] working in a way
[1:56:51] to to get the people to repent
[1:56:56] i can't make no one repent i personally
[1:56:59] ha
[1:57:01] i repent every day lord from something
[1:57:06] lord i pray
[1:57:08] that you help us

[1:57:15] let them see that the enemy is not
[1:57:18] one or the other or each other
[1:57:21] but our enemy is satan himself
[1:57:25] we don't want to be classified as being
[1:57:27] wicked in your eyes
[1:57:29] we don't want to have the knowledge to
[1:57:32] do good and don't do
[1:57:35] lord be merciful to us
[1:57:38] give us what we stand in need of to make
[1:57:40] a rapture lord
