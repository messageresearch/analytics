TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] trust the lord it's been good to everybody in my absence amen amen the more that i surrender the lighter my lord the more [Music] the more that i will humble myself the more you lift me up and every day i live lord i love you [Music] the more that i could humble myself [Music] the more [Music] once again once again the more that i can [Music] no [Music] hallelujah amen yes it gets easier as we surrender to god as we stand right into the word of god we know we're living in the last days and i'm gonna keep saying those kind of things to always remind us not just you but me too of the hour that we're living in uh everybody claims to see it but there are so many who think they see they forget that we're in an hour that the lord said that you have eyes to see and can't see and you'll have ears to hear and you won't be able to hear and in all of that it is the lord's doing it's not my doing and no one else is doing how god can speak to some and then hide himself in the same sentence or statement but i'm so glad to be here tonight to see and understand the moving of god to know the hour that we're living in in the old house and see how serious excuse me it is only god can help us in this day we have a great adversary and we must not all we must never take him for granted we must always understand it was god who made him so even in his evil he's perfect evil don't underestimate your enemy and the only one who can defeat him is the perfect god so um with all that being said i i thank god for the opening of the word and all that god is doing and has done for us we had a wonderful time there in guyana the lord richly richly blessed words cannot express or explain we did have one soul who gave his heart to the lord as i preached he said the fire of god just came all over him from his head to the bottom of his feet i didn't have to beg he came willingly and was just seeing the urgency of the time and he wanted to be immediately baptized and we accompanied the brother to baptize him i thought it was only appropriate to let the pastor baptize him even though my desire was to baptize him but uh either way he's out of a sin he was born in and the young man is really fired up so pray for him he also won a witness to the place he when she came from which is a pentecostal church so pray god give him an open door give him strength by god's grace amen as we turn to genesis 5 22 and i want to say that trip was worth it if it's just one soul but we ministered at a church there uh in guyana um and over 5 000 something people listened in uh people from canada people from uh trinidad and other places were all tuned in i have that recording i sent it to a few people if you want to listen or see what god was doing there you i could always send it to you genesis 5 22 it was something that i was not expecting i didn't know they had a means of doing that so that was one of those sporadical things that happened and so by god's grace we're we're happy to know thing my son said to me he says daddy those people really love you over there so don't be worried about home just enjoy yourself so i i was surprised he said that but he did it was a word of encouragement and that that was god speaking to him because i was couldn't get my mind off of here genesis 5 25 what did i say genesis 5 24 excuse me and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him one more scripture second corinthians 12 and three for those of you who may see the condition of my eye i did not get punched in it or anything uh we had a doctor's appointment i just got an injection and i thought it was quite rough today my eye says he was rough but i thank god for the victory amen we we're fine and it's one of those things that i have to deal with until jesus completely heals me or give me the grace to receive that healing i believe that i'm not giving up on it and i believe god has heard my prayer yes second corinthians 12 and 3 let's start at the second verse i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into a paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for men to to utter amen and i was such one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your grace we thank you for being so good to us we pray that you will give us grace tonight oh god open up your word that we may hear and understand and lord will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen we you may be seated we entitled this message uh uh dimensional strength but i would like to flip it around and just kind of call it ascension uh the last time i was here we talked about ascension that is to move up higher into a position into a place that god has established us we know by god's grace um as we are we're not the beings that god intention intended for us to be uh because of the fall and the things that uh uh transpired in the garden of eden will now uh bearing the uh the the sins of our fathers uh but by god's grace god is more than just he's more than fair and he's most of all merciful um you know god gave me a song today i wasn't in a place to write it down and so it left me but the thing that was so beautiful too in that song it was more less on a hymn style but it uh talked about how beautiful god is and how wonderful he is if the lord give gives me that song again i will write it down but nevertheless i i was thinking about that all day on how beautiful god is um i i can't imagine what he looks like in his natural body but uh in his spirit um you hear that you've heard that song his beauty is beyond description and the more i fall in love with him uh the more i see him for who he really is and the more i desire to be like him you know we look at this thing and we uh think about how and i mentioned this the last time how great the fall was and how um tremendous it was and we never think about it but it was it really was we we think about it was like it happened and god moved on but you've got to realize how painful this was god has feelings and even though he knew what was going to take place he could feel you know the the pain of disappointment and failure um we must understand by god's grace that god knows we're going to fail in our in ourselves but we know it affects him uh and and we know that through our sin you know he feels every blow um that we we give him daily we let's not forget amen that jesus christ amen is the one who's who who was crucified for us and our sins are was placed upon him and so therefore until it's all finished he is uh standing in the gap he's our perpetuation he's our mercy seat he is our he's our bloody lamb he's you know he's the god who can feel and be touched by our infirmities the thing that gets me is that we've spoken on this uh before but somewhat in a different way we've said how enoch walked with god and i love that because that's all god says and we would have never known that enoch built the pyramid had it not been for brother brandon and that comes by faith now we don't know how it all happened and how god did it but we know that enoch was responsible for the great pyramid it doesn't matter who the archaeologists give credit to we know the truth now the thing that gets me is because enoch typed the bride and that's all god said he never told us the story of enoch before he walked with god all we know is that there was a point in time enoch and god connected and that's all that's recorded enoch was a man like you and i none of his failures was ever recorded and the bible says it all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so we understand that even enoch and his own walking with god had failures just like us because by god's grace he is a type of us and we know by god's grace that noah is not because noah had to work for his salvation he had to build he had to help he had to go in there and build a knock for 120 years but enoch all he did was walk all he did was commune with god all he did was connect with god and the bible said because he did that he was found not he was just he ascended he was translated amen and was found not now even in the in this great message of grace we must understand by god's grace that god always tests and tries us why because we're sons and daughters of god we must understand the test and the trials are going to come the bible said if god doesn't try you if he doesn't test you if i could say it like that then you're none of his he spanks those he's chasing those whom he loves and so we must understand that every day is not some shiny day in some rainbow of colors we have some rough times hallelujah amen but paul says you know he gives us a view of something and before the message came in this hour we didn't understand what paul was talking about you know i can remember even in the denominations how we uh tried to ration our lives and try to uh understand you know what paul was talking about caught up into the third heaven we didn't even know there were three i didn't even know there was a third heaven and we we tried to place where that would be amen and you know when you think about it you you i can remember i could see the faces right now some of the ministers that we we talked about or listened to as they conversed and talked about how you know uh this thing was was with paul and they thought it was so great but now if you tell them the story of william branham they don't want to hear it but you see if there's an alpha there must be an omega and and all paul was doing to his day and age was telling them his experience and in his experience he could not say i saw you over there and if he did it's not written but when it came to william branham in his because he was the omega the things in which paul could not utter the prophet of god did because uh paul was the first angel to the church and william branham was the seventh angel to the church and we know at the voice of the seven angels the mysteries of god should be completed and so we understand by god's grace that the mystery of god is so beautiful that's all i was thinking about so beautiful words cannot express how beautiful it is and and all the time we think that we're messing up we have no idea we're right in the the the step of the word because you don't you're not the one who orders your steps he orders your stamps and so paul was saying listen i can't tell you about my experience other than what i what it is and paul was almost like bashful if i could say it like this he was reserved because he said i knew a man using i think the third person or the second person he he used as if there was someone else outside of himself that told him a testimony but the testimony was all about him brother bradham said i was caught up he said i laid up on my bed and i'm saying these things because i want you to understand he said i laid there and all of a sudden i was right above just by the ceiling or somewhere up in there and i was in another dimension now i'm saying that for purpose because we we in our minds we've always thought heavens were a million miles away and all of a sudden the rapture is going to take us and we're going to go at the sound or the speed of the light to get there in the moment of a twinkling of an eye when in reality it's just a dimensional way we don't know how far away that this dimension was in the time of of paul because i want you to understand that they were dimensions even in the creation of god seven i believe it was and these dimensions were out of order that's why the bible said that the earth was void and then god spoke by his word and placed everything in order understand because of the fall it distorted the dimensions again that's why god said amen that hell was not made or created for the sons of god but because of these things amen because of the the fall of man everything has been out of order and remember brother brethren said that even hell and earth is blending into each other now i want to tell you this and maybe you're not aware but there is another blending but it's heaven and earth amen and that's what god was showing by way of paul and by way of william branham that something is moving and it's moving into a way a place that one day it's just going to take another step we sing it my theophany is always calling me yeah because one of these old days we'll take another step now understand i'm going scripture because enoch walked with god step by step by step by step and that step took him to a place that he was found not he didn't go by chariot he didn't go by whirlwind he went by a step so you and i must understand how important it is for us to walk with god says of god i'm trying to tell you whatever it is that's blocking your walk with god you've got to get rid of it this is a dimensional thing this is a thing that that god will allow us to happen to happen you don't believe it is so because remember amen this thing after let's just jump a little bit because when jesus was raised from the dead first of all marry them saul wanted to touch him he couldn't he says i must have sinned to my father right he went there he placed the blood on the on on the mercy seat he came back down mary and all of them touched him in that glorified body jesus walked through the door he didn't jump through he didn't propel himself through he walked through it was something about that dimensional thing that had taken place with him that made him such a supernatural man but at the same time he was so supernatural but yet he still was a man he could eat bring me some fish right he was able to eat he was able to drink but he was just a god man he was the first of his kind hallelujah he said that's why the bible said i call you now brethren we're the brothers so if we're born of god and we're born in the same like manner then the potential of what jesus was and is is within us all right now let me move on everything that is real is made of these dimensions and what dimensions you're speaking of uh i'm dealing with water light in time and each cannot do without the other interdependence what is light without matter to shine through you know god said let there be light but if there was nothing there what would you see if there was something to see but because of matter we can see purple chairs gold legs yellow walls and all of these things are reflections of light their composition make them reflect different colors and god is the one who composed it you understand me so matter needs light and light needs matter now we understand time and time is the only thing that really gets on our nerve annoys us because we hate being late you know what i mean time is is such an essence in this particular generation because everything is moving so fast but can you imagine what it's going to be like without time nobody will be rushing there won't be any watches and no matter where you go or whatever you think you'll be on time it's just so beautiful because you got to understand this when these things were interrupted it was everything moved out of its position and only thing that could bring it back into play was jesus christ himself because he conquered depth hell and the grave and what else did he do he moved paradise into his proper dimension and that dimension was the sixth dimension which was under the altar and so you and i must understand that when we're born of god we we are translated into the real dimension that we're supposed to live in you say well why would you say that because brother branham gave a specific word he says i saw you there you were there in that dimension before you came here hallelujah do you understand i don't have to i believe it and so you guys say well what about times even so you got to realize that something took place when jesus conquered death hell in the grave a mighty thing took place i'm jumping but i need to something took place that we did not understand and i'ma tell you something i read the scriptures so many times psalm 24 7-10 it says lift up your hands o ye gates and be ye lift up the everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o you gates even lift them up to your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in and the thinking says who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory and after that it says salah that means to meditate on it what was it we didn't understand that scripture i didn't i thought it was a beautiful part of of of the psalms you know what nice poetry you know what i'm saying it it it didn't have a i didn't have a revelation of it but it's in the message we understood that this scripture was referring to the resurrection of the old testament saints and we did not even know before this message that there had been a resurrection we didn't we did not know when when we read the scriptures and they said the graves were open and the saints walked around in the city and we didn't know we couldn't tie it together hallelujah but god took a prophet and let us see it meant that there was a resurrection and these people right now hallelujah is in their celestial bodies is that right paul explained it to me in the fifth chapter 15th chapter corinthians he said there's celestial bodies in their terrestrial bodies there's corruptible bodies and they're incorruptible bodies but these incorruptible bodies shall put on uh these corruptible bodies should put on incorruptible bodies hallelujah and he called them celestial hallelujah that means there's a heavenly body for me it's the same thing god told abraham abraham look at the sands of the sea one of these old days that they won't be just stand on the sea but there'll be stars in heaven you see what we're living in right now is the most important time you if you're going to be a christian you got to walk by yourself you can't allow other christians to influence you in the wrong way jesus christ himself must be your only lover y'all understand me you can love your friends but when it comes to the word right because one thing we must understand sometimes you can fellowship too much it's the truth you say it's that's not yes because there are times i'm talking personally there are times god would be calling me to pray or to read or to study and somebody ring up on the phone you want to do something y'all you know it's right god just tried you and you just failed we do it but when god moves on your heart and then to read to study to pray you must say no to whoever it is calling and it's okay to tell them i've got an appointment with jesus because god is moving on you he's trying to get your attention so that you can understand his love toward you am i making sense we're talking about connection and you and i must understand that in this day and time you must have connection that's why so many people come to church that's why so many people are not here they're not connected some people may be working that's okay i'm not working with those but i'm talking about those who had rather stay home and listen to this message on the youtube or whatever when they could have been in the presence hallelujah youtube is okay but it's nothing like being in the presence hallelujah and that's what people do right they come along and say i love the lord you can't love god if you don't know him and how can you say you know him when the bible says forsake not the gathering of yourselves in the day when you see the day approaching come together the more and that's what gets me when i see the empty chairs i know these people are not seeing the time we're living in god is moving people and he's changing character he's changing character this is not a time of being famous well known and all that that's nonsense the only person you want to be well known to is christ himself connected you you know we've we've i've preached a message like that one time before and we work with connection being connected you know can you hear me now you know nothing like when your phone go bad right you can't holly and i i said to the lord the other day i said if we could love you like the people of their phones and connected with you like we connected with our phones we won't have no problem with the devil hallelujah you don't think god wants you god warns you peter you got to walk circumspectly you got to be careful because satan desire you to sift you as wheat what was that that was a warning from god and the holy spirit when you're connected he will warn you hallelujah heaven is not one million mile you like miles away you know the probably god told us that i got a quote on it but i'm not it's not necessary see now you you got to understand amen that a lot of times people think that god that heaven is so far away and i ask you if it is where is the kingdom of god the bible says the kingdom of god is within you you can't get no closer than that but look what deuteronomy 30 and 14 says but the word is very nighty in thy mouth and in thine heart that thou mayeth do it so god didn't write it on tables of stone up in the heavens anywhere or you know we didn't have to go to egypt to read the pyramid and we don't have to be astrologists or understand the bible by the stars god put the bible in you this is why he says eat the book eat the book this is why he told israel eat the lamb because the lamb was the type of the book don't leave nothing eat the bitter and the sweet hallelujah and right now they they we must eat in haste because we've wasted a lot of time right israel had to eat in haste because that was the moment of the exodus and if you can't see that we're living right in the moment of this exodus something's wrong with your eyes i know the devil he's tricking us he's trying to do everything he can to keep us uh not focused but don't worry he can never win and you could never lose hallelujah he can never win i say it again and you can never lose because you got to understand who's orchestrating this this drama the scene has already been set everything is in order the the maestro amen is front of everything and he's the one who changes the music hallelujah but understand it's already written it's already on the sheets and there's no one in this orchestra that's going to change the sheets because god has already selected those who he wanted in the orchestra and you and i must understand that every minister amen that is of god ordained of god is now trying to get the people back to god because we've allowed liam to see it to influence us in such a mighty way now understand i thought i didn't understand this for a long time i i thought i understood it let's put it this way the bible says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away and i didn't get it every time i saw that i would see this but it's not this it's him god can never pass away he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god everything that that that that everything changes but god you understand me although eden was like heaven to eat adam and eve it changed if everything's going to change every day changes hallelujah but the word which is god himself can never change every time i think about it it does something to me because it takes it higher than just a written word hallelujah it's god can never change he never fails he never changes talking about moving higher this is why i said my mind our minds must be elevated now let me tell you one thing i love about this great grace of god is that you can't change yourself but god has every change that needs to be made written for you that's powerful folks y'all i feel like shouting up here because i realize that who orders the steps of the righteous god orders the steps of the righteous hallelujah that means you don't even have nothing to do with it hallelujah you understand me you know let's go to jonah if jonah had anything to do with it he would have never ran but god knew jonah was going to run to nineveh god was steps ahead of him you understand me god made the boat waited for jonah he couldn't just get on any boat he had to get on that boat hallelujah had already prepared uh uh the the fish for him and already prepared nineveh when jonah when the well spit jonah up hallelujah you know those people you know they repented and it just amazes me just a few days ago this man was swallowed by a whale and was spit back up you know people take those things for granted but what if god was actually typing something nothing happens by coincidence what if god was using that little scenario to basically tell us that that's time to preach to nineveh because there's got to be somebody and none of it was a wicked place nineveh amen was full of pro just like los angeles and everything else full of drugs and everything else is worshiping and everything oh it's the truth i tell you what folks when i went down to north carolina there at the airport i could not believe the way those people were dressed honestly i i i was raised in south i know what north carolina used to look like but i tell you what if god ain't right he is right always right we're living in a generation of adulterers i need it would have been against the law in my day to walk around with those things on i couldn't believe it i had no choice but i thought to myself lord have mercy that's why i was praying lord have mercy young girls lord have mercy everything is just revealing it was terrible it was terrible i'm like wash me lord cleanse me you know because we're looking at the time and you say now wonderful excuse me we must understand that god is doing some great things hallelujah and as i said you know when god began to pray sometimes we when we begin to pray we think sometimes god doesn't hear our prayer but i'm gonna tell you something let me ask you there is nothing that can hinder your prayer he said well how can that be because god if god said you are justified as though you've never seen it in the first place and if you already accept it in the beloved the blood holds stands for you don't get me wrong because you got to understand the true believer when they make wrong they make it right immediately when when you know sometimes you know we get a little stubborn but god keep working on us until we get it but the truth of the matter he knows you're going to confess it he knows you're going to make it right this is why he gives you the holy ghost it's not you accepting god it's god accepting you amen daniel prayed did he not and we understand by god's grace when daniel prayed amen god heard him the first day and sometimes we carry on you know what we really don't trust him like we say we do because honestly if he doesn't answer expediently we feel and you we let the devil torment us with it god didn't hear you or you sinner you ain't right he brings all of those things to your mind and you know what we i'm not when i say we i'm not here talking about everybody but we have a tendency of believing the devil's lies over god's truths may god have mercy on us and he still have the patience to wait till we wake up right oh yes you say well brother looks what i'm saying let me tell you something god wants us to be so in contact with him that even if our best friend say something wrong we can correct him you think peter wouldn't come close to god and peter thought he was doing it right right oh lord you're not going to die but it's already written he was and then god jesus turned right to peter says satan now what did was jesus looking at he was in another dimension he could see what was influencing peter he wasn't calling peter satan you think he was going to make peter and peter be satan you think he was going to make him the the the chief preacher on pentecost no he saw the anointing that was working with him now every anointing is dealt with differently is that right oh it's the truth we think oh it's a devil it might well be a devil anything that is the lies of a devil right and remember the young man the man who says you know you know he he he he tried to exercise his wife and said come out of her satan and it almost calls for for divorce ah yes it was satan it was the devil anointing her but that was not god's way of casting him out see that's the thing we feel like words can just do it but god you don't always do it that way sometimes just to touch sometimes a laying of hands right sometimes words sometimes action and what the prophet told him to do go buy her some flowers right bring some love in this picture and it changed things see so what i'm trying to say is in order to be elevated in order to continue on we must be connected with god in such a way that we can understand what god wants us to do in certain situations that will give him glory because all of this is about giving glory to god your life you have none forget it get over it your life now is given to christ at least that's the way it should be he'll never take second place he'll never take third place he only will take first place and you and i must understand he must come first he's going to keep driving you he's going to keep putting you on your knees he's going to keep doing what's necessary for you your eyes to open to see that he must be first and when you realize he's first then you'll understand why what it was all about his love towards you this is a beautiful situation amen and so we understand that this is what what could only restore see the purpose of this message and the open book is to return a man is to bring heaven and earth back into a perfect union and we saw it we didn't understand it when jesus was there to be baptized by john and and and the voice of heaven the dove descended and the voice of heaven said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in we didn't understand heaven and earth was kissing that was a kiss that was a union he was the first man amen that literally brought earth and heaven together and now this is why the holy ghost comes the holy ghost come to bring heaven and earth together back to that place before the fall hallelujah that's why the prophet god kept telling us it's not just jumping it's not just shouting it's life and once we are surrendered the more that i surrender the light of the lord the more i surrender i find out that this is what he's been wanting me to do all along surrender my will to his and once we get to that complete surrender you become invincible omnipotent you and god becomes what and at that time he could use you just the way he used adam before he fell hallelujah but the only way the only way to bring this back to a unity we needed an alter unadulterated word person that's how you phrase it unadulterated word person we needed that that's where jesus comes in he's the only thing the only one that could restore back to god what the first adam fell to you heard me say that last week or the last time i was here that's why he says father not my will but thine be done that means jesus could have he could have said lord i don't want to do it but he failed to do it he looked at us and he saw the cause and the bible said he set his face like a flint in other words he wasn't going to take nothing the devil was saying i was telling this the other day i said you know what many times you don't know what you can take and what you can bear but i found out the devil is a liar he called those things that are strong weak because they looked at jesus he was weak they looked at him and they saw him he wouldn't open his mouth when they spat on him they he they slapped him they they they did it they blasphemed him and he wouldn't open it but in the eyes of the public that was weakness can you imagine what rome this is your king what is that huh but you don't understand when you are sold out to god when god is the center and the strength of your life you become a real lamb when they mock you when they curse you when they say things to you that that's not not appropriate you can still keep your mouth shut you say i can't do it yes you can if you were in him you did it then and can do it now oh i gotta say no you don't as long as you gotta say it god gonna keep bringing it to the place you could get to a place where you said i don't have to say it and i won't say it they call that weakness they call love weakness compassion weakness i'm talking about message people people who ought to know better but we our mouths places us in bondage because we don't know how to keep them shut we don't know how to stop talking when god says don't talk a wise man knows not know how not to talk james said if you can't even brighten your tongue your religion is in vain you have no covering you feel like you got to say what's on your mind that's the problem say what's on jesus mind and you'll be okay but when you're saying what's on your mind that is the devil influencing you keeping you from your perfection you've got to suffer people and god is not going to bring forth goats out of this all lambs the lamb book of life not goats sheep and goats are separated at the at the second uh the last generation uh resurrection am i making sense revelations 21 3 says and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and and god himself shall be with them and be their god now when is that going to take place not when you get over yonder over there not over there here it must begin here you are the tabernacle of god you and i are the people that god has purchased his blood purchased you uh with his blood you're the ones who god is now infusing himself into glory to god what are you saying whether you see it or not i'm moving up higher i'm not the same man i used to be and one of these old days this old model will put on immortality hallelujah oh we'll be changing the moment of between the night why because the inner man is moving up higher this whole flesh amen will will be changed hallelujah because of the inner man hallelujah right now the inner man in this flesh are not compatible and so therefore you got to kill him you got to shut him up you got to put him down amen so that the inner man can grow and that's what paul said we must grow up into him our goal is to be just like jesus more than just a song oh i want to be like him no sir you've got to know and know that you want to be like him from your heart and not from your head hallelujah if you want to be like him you would be just like him like i said you're the purpose god has put you that has the purpose the whole thing like i said everything that's moving for the bride is moving for you you know and you know you know i've seen myself in esther and i've seen myself in gideon and how gideon says lord i don't heard of many things told i've seen what brother branham did in his age and everything else we know those things are true but if god be with us we'll be the miracles and i understand one thing the upper hand that we got because we understand it ain't just the anointing brother brandon says it's the right anointing anointed one is the end time he says it's the right anointing but the difference that makes the difference between you and us them and us is the word you understand that's being anointed hallelujah janice and james was anointed they did just as much as moses did hallelujah but it was a moses anointing that ate and swallowed up theirs so you got to understand you and i must understand at the end of the day it doesn't matter how anointed men are and it's just the truth even in our ranks we see the deed of the nicolaitans men anointed men controlling god's bride where that's wrong we're not here to control you we're here to lead you god is the controller and when you get men who usurp their authority to control you by their own power it's what the ephesus age hated the deed of the nicole agent became a doctrine and then you had bishops and kings and all that stuff don't you see that same spirit is anointing the people around the message there are no great men among us no great preachers brother i'm saying it does not matter how much word you understand how great your revelation he said that's not it it's your character it's your character and when you see people i don't care if they got thousands of followers listen that's nothing lucifer had more than that and i'm going to tell you something there's not a preacher like lucifer nobody can preach like him they understand me when it comes to the anointing and the dynamics and the theatrics and the drama he can do it watch the preachers out there in the world intellectuals influenced by their words and how they articulate what does that have to do with god he's simple but powerful everything he preached is simple but truth but they don't want the simplicity you start preaching on people's lives they don't want it that's when you know they don't know god because true believers they don't care how you slice it and dice it they say amen we're going to go up higher we've got to stop looking at all of this stuff and thinking that because people got mega churches and big churches they god with them what y'all talking about there was a great preacher that i know of at the end of the day didn't have number 12 disciples and one of them was the devil and there was no greater preacher than jesus hallelujah his his ministry was far above the pharisees and the sadducees but they had the greater churches and god called them devils too look what happens when people lift folks up oh he had to peel a fire when he the angel in this picture he had an angel with him so what when the supernatural of things deter the bride the bride is not built upon signs she's built upon word that's what's going wrong with people oh where he walked with brother brown what's that got to do with it millions walk with moses and i we don't know how many mark with jesus but it means nothing you say well what do you mean you should oh well they can go all up let me tell you something the bible said to loser for why are you walking up here what you doing now he went on earth he was in a dimension where jesus could see him huh oh i'm walking about what seeking who i can devour and god says have you considered my servant job and the devil says yeah i have and every time i try to test him and try him nothing can get through because you got a wall around him hallelujah that's the way i like it when god the devil can testify that god has a wall the devil said yeah he's your pet you've got to walk around let me tell you something you better understand that god got a wall around you the devil would have ate you alive long time ago had not god been with you people is real this thing is real you know what i'm gonna tell you something i see who i am more now than i ever have and you know what uh it had to take god to show it to me but i'm gonna tell you something the things that i worried about before i left here is not what i worry about now i don't even care what the devil is going to do and he's doing because i one i know one thing for certain there are two influences one is of god and one is of the devil and when you know who you are who are you brother brooks the grass withers and the flowers fade away but the word of the lord shall stand he ain't talking about this only he's talking about you nothing can defeat the word not in this day miss adam the first one she failed she failed but brother i'm saying this bride is ordained to stand hallelujah she cannot fall and no matter what the devil tries to do he cannot she's ordained to trample upon him just a mighty just a quote listen a lot of people don't like this one but i'm going to bring it to you the mighty conqueror 1957. brother brown said a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real to true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he got temper it'll show itself if he's meek and gentle it shows itself put him under pressure once and god puts all of his children on the test to see whether there are any flaws in them and as long as we have these flaws you're going to be tried and tested until you overcome hallelujah you understand that so we understand by god's grace amen gideon didn't understand he was the very purpose of god i'm almost done you're the purpose we're here now to defeat all the enemies of the devil however they come you understand the battles gideon was in a uh uh i don't know what you want to say back since citizen state but he didn't even realize and recognize who he was but god calls him mighty man available who is that but the bride of jesus christ she becomes him that's the only reason why you become a mighty man of healer that's the only reason why he is the mighty conqueror paul said but we're more than a conqueror hallelujah hey y'all don't heard the story the man goes out and he works all day he brings forth the check and he gives the check to his wife who's the conqueror he's the conqueror but she got the check she's more than a conqueror that's how it is with us christ paid the price jesus christ paid all the price for us folks it's just because of the lack of faith in the lack of believing the word of god it's the truth he healeth all your diseases he forgives you of all your iniquities and the bible and the devil makes you say we got you know oh i'm sick that means i got this happen that no no all my disease has been healed is healed all of my sicknesses all my sins have been forgiven not some all so if they're all done if it's all done satan has no right to hold me in prison and the only reason why he holds you is because you're weak in your faith oh ye of little faith he said where did you doubt that's god putting you to the test every time you come to a test every day you come to a test and god is expecting you to win hallelujah there you are you've got to recognize your part in the pride that's the thing a lot of people are not recognizing where we are we're a translation we're at a place of translation now that means we've got to walk with god not company with friends nothing wrong with that if everybody's walking with god y'all understand me hallelujah i know what it's like even when i was in the pentecostal church sometime when it was time to go to church you know what our friend says oh let's go to someone's own let's go eat let's go do this no y'all go ahead i'm going to church but friends do that they miss church because somebody is inspired by the devil and they don't even know it how can you say to go eat or to go fellowship when the word of god is being preached that's the devil you say it is yes it's the devil when the gods worship come together the more not fellowship around the table that's not it it's important to hear the word for your day to understand what god is doing moving this is why god anoints preachers so you can see what his next move is but what if you're not at church you don't get it you see the people come to church even on sunday they still coming half hour late you know if i moved it up to 10 o'clock you know what time they get here 10 30. you can move it all you want to it's the devil's it's devils whether they believe it or not i don't care traditions but it's devils those devils are causing people to be late and i disrespectful and then when when they come in they expect a preacher to preach how can he preach when you you you greed the holy ghost don't tell me if walking in church late doesn't agree now there are times you can't help but to be late things happen but when people are coming in the same schedule i hope some i'm listening to me tonight because you know the truth of the matter is it's evil and god is not happy he's not they're wondering why things happen in deaths and all kinds of stuff happening in people's lives and you know they don't understand they're the corporate evil shall not come now your dwelling place that's the bible everlasting life and how i'm gonna read this quote number stop but when you stay in the kingdom stay in the gospel stay right one of these days god will call you out and set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the nation with it see what i mean it's the adoption into the family and my prom my thing is how many you know is trying to move in that direction we've got too many things we've got too many things that's blocking us lay aside every weight and the sin that does not easily besets you sometimes you gotta walk alone but i'm gonna tell you tonight people of god even to those who are listening you better put god first if you don't know how to ask him how to ask god for his grace and his mercy repent before him because you know we've been guilty of not putting him first he's got to come first people he can't come second or third he ain't going to work with you like that you've got to give him all your body mind soul your spirit you know i said love the lord with all your heart and mind that still stands and by god's grace if you want to see yourself elevated you want to see things change and happening on the inside of you you put god first and when you when you put him second ask for his forgiveness he says lord give me grace you know what i mean you gotta put him first he's the king of kings and the lords of lords and i say this again this is why i'm gonna tell you people this is what i see and if i'm wrong lord forgive me but i see so many people who claim to have the holy ghost and when you got the holy ghost that doesn't mean you don't make mistakes but one thing i know about the leading of the holy ghost the holy ghost will lead you to church is that right and brother branham said it he said even if you don't have a church to go to they believe what you believe go get a slice and some of us are staying home ain't no message church around here that ain't what the prophet struck instructed us to do and we so righteous and so self-righteous but i'm gonna tell you something sometimes that simple gospel that some of these people preach will help you yeah people think it's the depth of the word let me tell you something who can preach as deep as jesus huh and he wasn't a screamer and a holler like like i am he talked with such a low voice but when he when he spoke never a man spake like this man before see it's the anointing that flows with the word that makes the difference and it doesn't make any difference you know i look a thing and i said oh even among the message we want to entertain us we want all of that look how many years we've been entertained and what good has it has it done still fussing and fighting preachers and everything else oh brother books don't say that well it's happening everywhere everywhere but not among the bride bride don't fight bride i don't care i don't care what they claim to be bride do not fight bride and i'm gonna tell you something bride do not try to get preeminence read your scripture there's a brother in the new testament that love preeminence i can't pronounce his name that's not bride bride walks together like sheep walk together we we watch each other we help each other you know i i was thinking about the early church and i'm almost done with this until we get to a place where we love each other don't even say you love god that's the bible oh i love the lord and you can't stand sister so-and-so and you can't speak to sister so and so because you think you're more righteous than sister so and so a brother so and so that's nonsense you're the one that's in bondage and you're deceived you're deceived jesus could have fellowship with prostitutes and everything else and then we're too righteous because we feel like we're going to be defiled oh my god help us jesus no this church this church this des moines church we need help we need help in this little assembly i see so many different cliques and they get out there and they preaching another message all over again gossiping and all that kind of stuff they do just come out of church and you don't think the spirit of god is grieved by that stuff and you don't think he tells me things i'm no great one but i know one thing i know when i see unity i know what it looks like may god help us young brothers those of you who are here may god bless you may god all of us who here today may god bless you and i know those who wanted to come i may god bless you keep on the firing line that's right uh this is a pressing time you don't think it's easy god doesn't shook us up with this corona and we need to understand that's the lord's doing the devil might have sent it but god had a purpose behind it and you think this is the worst that is to come no what is he doing he's trying to prepare us to connect connect the whole time the plagues were falling on egypt god had a connection there in goshen connection trying to get us to see this is your last time you're not going to repeat this and once you die however you die brother adam said that's how you however you go down is how you go up and the character of christ must be in you press toward it forget about you forget about yourself let god let go and let god it's not worth holding on to anything people not this day and time not this hour let's walk with god amen i really enjoyed that song brother isaac yeah yeah i saw i heard it back there and i actually thought it was uh at least paul singing it i thought well he sounded a little different but i i didn't know you was here so i thought it was so it was a real blessing to me honestly brothers you have no idea how much i really love you guys you know i really appreciate your sacrifice and and i know it's more than that i know you love the lord the best you know how but i'm gonna tell you something it's later than what we think and don't let nobody kill what you got fight for the fire that you got going in you matter of fact i want you to want to encourage you to put more logs on on the fire let them call you crazy you know i'm gonna tell you something and and i don't care if they hear me you know i was talking about the young people and there were some people who weren't even impressed about you all being on fire and trying to serve the lord it's like a joke you know they you know there ain't nobody working with you and for you that's gonna tell you that you better press on you understand me press on no matter what everybody else is doing it doesn't matter it's you and god you don't need their approval you understand me they're not the kind of elders that you you need approvals from you don't need their approval god call you to preach preach god call you to sing sing god call you to play music do it and give god your best you don't need their approval nobody can tell you how to worship god that's nicolettes and stuff that's trying to tell you how well i don't think you know what i'm saying well if you have been in the spirit is that right brother man say get in the spirit do you think this is rapture time and we're sitting back like this oh hallelujah no no with the anointing of god we only we're supposed to be like popcorn around here can't even keep seated because we're excited about god and they want us to just follow some kind of systematic worship and all that kind of stuff no get freer than you are now as long as the holy ghost is anointing you and you you know that you're in the word with what you're doing you don't need no nobody's approval not even mine y'all understand me yeah they want you to be dead like they are yeah they do don't don't fall into the systematic thing folks don't do it i'm telling you god got you here for a purpose my heart cries because i wish i had help in the sense of the young people down there in the other church i reached out for help i didn't get any and it hurts because i don't want them to misunderstand me that i don't care like i don't care and i do but i can't be in two places at one time you love the lord i didn't mean to pour my heart out but i did and i wish everybody down in iowa city heard what i said i love god i love god's people and by god's grace we're going to make it together i don't know what he all has in store but i'm gonna do my best to stay connected and to hear what he's got to say that's all i can do in these last days i realize i'm different from everybody else and i didn't understand how different i was until i went over to guyana and i went to guyana and i found out i was different there too but it's not a bad difference it's a good difference i realize god got me here god has me in this place and i ain't no nobody gonna uh take me out there ain't no birth gonna sing in my place as long as i'm alive
