[37:25] amen
[37:27] [Music]
[37:29] amen would go right on into the
[37:32] scriptures thank God for the song
[37:34] service
[37:35] we are appreciate
[37:38] the word of God and all that God is
[37:41] doing
[37:44] we understand by God's grace that
[37:47] we're nothing within ourselves
[37:50] but it's the grace of God that makes us
[37:52] what we are and Who We Are
[37:56] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[37:58] to Psalms
[38:00] the ninth chapter
[38:02] and we'll begin to read the
[38:05] 9th and 10th verse
[38:08] that ninth chapter
[38:10] the ninth division of Psalms
[38:13] and then from there
[38:15] we like to go to Isaiah 40
[38:18] 29 and 31.
[38:22] Psalms 9
[38:28] 9 through 10.
[38:31] the Lord also will be a refuge for the
[38:35] oppressed
[38:36] a refuge in times of trouble
[38:41] and they that Know Thy Name will put
[38:44] their trust in thee
[38:46] for thou thou Lord has not forsaken them
[38:51] that seek thee
[38:54] Isaiah 40 29 31.
[39:01] he giveth power to the faint
[39:05] and to them that have no might
[39:09] he increases strength
[39:13] everybody there yet
[39:15] my apology
[39:17] Isaiah 40 29 31.
[39:21] I just read it again
[39:24] he giveth power to the faint
[39:27] and to them that have no might
[39:30] he increased his strength
[39:33] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[39:37] and the young men shall utterly fall
[39:42] but they that wait upon the Lord
[39:46] shall renew their strength
[39:49] they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles
[39:53] they shall run and not be weary
[39:57] and they shall walk
[39:59] and not faint
[40:02] let's pray
[40:04] our gracious father
[40:08] we thank you for your grace and your
[40:11] mercy
[40:12] we thank you for being so good to us
[40:17] words cannot express our gratitude
[40:21] for Lord we know
[40:24] our daily walk
[40:27] and we also know that it was it without
[40:29] your grace
[40:35] we're nothing
[40:37] and we would all perish
[40:40] your Holiness beyond anything that we
[40:43] can comprehend
[40:45] and therefore Lord this is why we cry
[40:48] God give us more of yourself
[40:51] because the only way that we could ever
[40:53] be holy is that the holy God is living
[40:55] in US
[40:57] it's not by power not by might but by
[41:00] your holy spirit says the Lord
[41:03] bless this service Lord as we cry for
[41:06] you as we yearn within our hearts to
[41:09] have more of you to come to that
[41:10] completion in this last hour
[41:13] we ask oh God that you look beyond our
[41:16] faults and see our needs
[41:18] granted Lord in your lovely name Jesus
[41:21] Christ we pray amen
[41:24] you may be seated
[41:30] one thing I I'd say about the Bible
[41:37] since the fall I believe every
[41:39] generation has had trouble
[41:44] before the fall everything was
[41:49] beautiful perfect
[41:51] Sublime
[41:54] beyond that
[41:57] but since the fall of Man has been Wars
[42:00] and wars and rumors of wars
[42:04] I thought about the time that we're
[42:06] living in now
[42:08] many people are saying you know uh
[42:15] we almost ready to have world war three
[42:19] but I want to Enlighten you tonight we
[42:22] are already engaged
[42:25] I know many of you don't look at the
[42:27] news and that's perhaps good
[42:30] because your hiding place is not in a
[42:32] building or a shelter
[42:34] you're hiding places in Christ
[42:39] and we know that the whole world is
[42:41] turned upside down
[42:43] politically economically
[42:46] show sociably
[42:48] everything is out of whack
[42:52] and it's all the result because the
[42:54] world
[42:55] refused and turned down Jesus Christ
[42:59] who was the only answer
[43:01] to all of their problems
[43:05] we know that in the last days
[43:08] many people even today don't believe
[43:10] that the the this is the last days these
[43:13] are the last days
[43:14] they can't comprehend it because they
[43:17] don't want to believe the Bible and
[43:19] they've taken God out of school and God
[43:21] out of churches and God out of
[43:22] everything everything has become a
[43:24] social
[43:25] some kind of social political
[43:29] lodging
[43:31] but God didn't come to give us that he
[43:33] came to give us life
[43:36] and I don't know about you I
[43:40] think about death and life every day
[43:46] I'm aware that my God sees everything
[43:49] he knows everything about me and
[43:52] and so therefore I don't try to lie to
[43:54] him or myself
[43:56] I am what I am
[44:00] but I realized by God's grace that out
[44:02] of all the people in the world billions
[44:05] trillions I don't really know how many
[44:07] people there are but I do know one thing
[44:10] God
[44:11] has had favor on us
[44:15] when God show you himself
[44:19] and reveals himself to you you
[44:22] are above the richest man in the world
[44:28] because everything
[44:30] is going to perish
[44:32] everything that you
[44:33] lose now that may seem to be beautiful
[44:35] it may seem you know to be something
[44:38] that will endure well history has proven
[44:41] to us
[44:42] nothing endures
[44:44] but the word of God
[44:46] we had a great Egypt we had a great
[44:49] Babylon we had a great role we had a
[44:53] great Greece
[44:55] my question
[44:55] [Music]
[44:57] is tonight where are they now
[45:01] but out of all the kingdoms that Satan
[45:03] has tried to destroy
[45:06] this Kingdom
[45:09] that God has established
[45:11] cannot be destroyed
[45:16] he has tried to separate us divide us
[45:19] and Conquer us
[45:23] and by God's grace we realize that his
[45:25] work is in vain
[45:29] because no matter what trick he tries
[45:34] God is still in control
[45:37] and God Is predestinated Us and elected
[45:40] us and chosen us to be victorious
[45:46] but dealing with all day
[45:49] many people don't realize the time that
[45:52] we're living in is trouble sometime and
[45:54] I don't know I guess people think it's
[45:56] going to get better
[45:58] that's not what the word of God says
[46:01] I'm not to hear to preach to you doom
[46:03] and gloom I'm coming to encourage you
[46:06] because what we're getting ready to face
[46:10] we cannot face these things alone
[46:14] you need God
[46:20] we've told we've been told and we
[46:22] understand the parable of Matthew 25
[46:24] about the five wise and the five foolish
[46:30] and one of the things that these
[46:33] virgins had to do was trim their lamps
[46:38] that means to take away everything that
[46:40] will hinder the light of God from being
[46:44] seen
[46:47] we know the story fire was wise and fire
[46:50] was foolish
[46:54] five of them represent church people
[46:59] who allowed the cares of this world to
[47:02] choke the life of God out of them
[47:06] and at a time when they should have been
[47:08] shining or the lamps should have been
[47:10] burning we found out that they it went
[47:13] out understand what that means
[47:16] when your lamp goes out that means you
[47:19] are in darkness
[47:22] like Peter said amen if these virtues
[47:25] one of them if they don't abound in you
[47:28] if they don't live in you
[47:31] 'll continually forget
[47:34] that you've actually been saved
[47:38] but we find out by God's grace
[47:42] Jesus was going to come in a way that
[47:45] they
[47:46] themselves wouldn't be able to see
[47:50] theologians doctors of divinity and all
[47:53] of the church World everybody's saying
[47:56] that God is coming Jesus is coming
[48:00] but if you watch Matthew 25 you'll find
[48:03] out how he was going to come
[48:07] and the Bible said that he would come as
[48:11] the son of man
[48:14] son of man means Prophets
[48:17] and when the prophet came they failed to
[48:20] see that it wasn't a man but was God
[48:22] fulfilling his word god interprets his
[48:26] own word
[48:29] and when the son of man would come it
[48:32] would be a time of lap trimming
[48:36] not a time of Revival
[48:38] but a lot a time of mourning
[48:41] a time of prayer
[48:44] a time of getting rid of all of the junk
[48:47] out of your life
[48:48] a time of sanctification a time of
[48:52] feeling yourself with the Holy Ghost
[48:56] so much so that when it's all said and
[48:59] done
[49:00] the Bible said the wise virgins had all
[49:04] an extra oil where did they get
[49:07] the extra off from
[49:10] the Bible also tell us that at midnight
[49:13] there will come a shout
[49:16] and we know that the shout is the
[49:18] message
[49:19] that's the extra oil
[49:22] see they had the Holy Spirit but they
[49:25] needed more of him
[49:27] because this was the time of perfection
[49:31] this is the time that God will incarnate
[49:34] himself in people
[49:37] called them bride called them the word
[49:39] amen he would take his nature and put
[49:43] his in these people
[49:45] that is the extra oil
[49:49] let us know let us not be deceived
[49:53] brother William said he has already come
[49:57] and they did to to him what was listed
[50:00] talking about Jesus but understand he's
[50:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:06] see but they think there's a Revival
[50:09] it is happening no it's done and dead is
[50:14] over uh-huh notice this is left trimming
[50:18] time
[50:19] coming out and going in going in where
[50:24] into that holies of holies
[50:27] going into the Shekinah Glory
[50:30] Hallelujah but you got to trim your
[50:34] lamps right because remember in the Holy
[50:38] place
[50:39] the labs could be smogged up
[50:42] they could get dirty with all of the you
[50:44] know all of the smoke and soot and
[50:46] everything else and if those priests
[50:48] weren't careful those lamps could go out
[50:51] but they had to periodically trim those
[50:54] lamps so the fire would burn
[50:57] Hallelujah understand that Ministry was
[51:01] the ministry of men
[51:04] but in the whole years of holies it's
[51:07] the ministry of God
[51:11] and you and I must understand by the
[51:13] grace of God
[51:15] that troubles and times are here and
[51:18] it's going to get worse
[51:19] people say oh I can't The Squeeze when
[51:22] the squeeze folks we're in the squeeze
[51:25] the only part we haven't seen yet is the
[51:28] political squeeze
[51:31] but everything else social uh squeeze uh
[51:35] look at the finances look at everything
[51:37] that's happening around you
[51:39] it's literally
[51:41] pressuring you to a place you're gonna
[51:44] either
[51:46] accept What God Says or deny him
[51:50] but when the political squeeze come
[51:53] that is when you're going to see
[51:56] the bride blew me in her fullest of
[52:00] Blues
[52:01] but right now amen she's now taking the
[52:04] time and the opportunity that she has
[52:07] right now to make sure everything's
[52:10] right everything is in order everything
[52:12] is going the way it's supposed to be and
[52:14] we would not have known what order would
[52:17] we that we had need to follow had not
[52:20] God sent us a messenger
[52:22] with a message
[52:25] right
[52:26] and the Bible tells us that in the time
[52:29] of trouble he said listen midi is going
[52:31] to faint to all the young Hallelujah but
[52:34] they and he says also fall
[52:38] and the young men shall utterly fall
[52:42] but
[52:44] there's still another group
[52:46] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[52:50] their strength
[52:51] and they shall Mount up amen with wings
[52:54] as eagles they shall run and not be
[52:57] weary and they shall walk and not faint
[53:03] see it doesn't matter
[53:05] how much Satan puts on us God is already
[53:10] ordained us to be victorious
[53:14] why because we're not relying Upon Our
[53:17] Own Strength like the Bible says not by
[53:20] power not by might but by my spirit
[53:23] saith the Lord this is the Holy Ghost
[53:26] this is why the bride says Lord give me
[53:28] more of you
[53:30] not this just to shout not just a dance
[53:33] not just speaking in tongues God I
[53:35] needed you
[53:37] your person your character your strength
[53:40] listen most of all your faith
[53:43] and that's what the Bible says the just
[53:45] shall live by his faith not your own
[53:50] Hallelujah
[53:54] there's a condition
[53:57] and this is the stairs of the enemy
[53:59] because the Bible said that
[54:00] in the last days amen that many uh will
[54:05] be choked and the life will be squeezed
[54:07] out because the cares of the world and
[54:11] you know we can see it
[54:13] among believers
[54:16] everybody want to work and become this
[54:18] and become that
[54:20] but what good would it do you
[54:22] like I was preaching the other day what
[54:25] good if you was on the Titanic and a
[54:27] real estate man was on that boat
[54:29] says I can sell you an island and I can
[54:32] give you a cheap prize and it's
[54:34] beautiful all kinds of birds and trees
[54:37] and everything
[54:39] what good would it do you
[54:42] and you could see that the ship is going
[54:45] down
[54:46] y'all understand me and if you can't see
[54:49] that the world is falling apart
[54:51] something is wrong with your sight
[54:54] God need to open your eyes
[54:57] this is not just a situation with
[55:00] America this is all over the world
[55:05] oh my we've already engaged ourselves
[55:10] and brother Benham didn't tell us but
[55:13] one thing
[55:14] he didn't tell us how much we were going
[55:16] to suffer
[55:19] he said you'll suffer but you overcome
[55:22] he didn't go into detail about a lot of
[55:25] things
[55:26] but he did say
[55:28] before the final when that before the
[55:31] bomb dropped
[55:33] that's it
[55:35] but you see the bomb dropping is the end
[55:38] what about that from the beginning up to
[55:41] that point
[55:42] this is where we are people we're headed
[55:46] toward the bomb drop
[55:49] and this is why God is saying make
[55:52] yourself ready it's coming
[55:58] Hallelujah and we know who's going to
[56:02] drop the bomb
[56:05] right
[56:07] and everybody say oh Putin's crazy let
[56:10] me say it like this he's ordained
[56:14] hey just like Nebuchadnezzar was
[56:17] ordained Amen to conquer Israel because
[56:20] of her backslidden condition
[56:22] God has set a man
[56:25] that has been ordained to bring judgment
[56:28] on the world
[56:30] because of their vaccine condition
[56:33] we're talking about the church
[56:37] Luke 12 29-34 says and seek not ye
[56:42] what ye eat
[56:44] or what you should drink
[56:46] neither be doubtful mind
[56:49] for all these things do the nations of
[56:52] the world seek after
[56:53] and your father knoweth that ye have
[56:56] need of these things huh
[57:00] but that's what we're doing got to get a
[57:03] better house got to get a better car got
[57:04] to get a better job got to get a better
[57:05] food got to get a better what are you
[57:07] doing
[57:08] you you all focused
[57:11] because now this is the time to focus
[57:15] on heaven
[57:17] the future of translation
[57:21] of his coming
[57:23] Hallelujah and not be caught with your
[57:26] work undone we know the parable
[57:29] the lady lost a jewel out of her out of
[57:32] her band
[57:34] and in the tradition of the Jews to to
[57:37] misplace a coin
[57:39] because that's what happens when a woman
[57:42] amen when she's married she has a
[57:44] certain band a certain corn band and to
[57:47] and every time she commits adultery the
[57:50] priest takes one of those coins away
[57:52] to show her husband when he returns your
[57:55] wife has been unfaithful
[57:58] and so she knew it was about time for
[58:01] her husband to come back amen and she
[58:04] saw where she had one coin missing
[58:07] so she gathered all of her sisters and
[58:10] all of her friends they helped me find
[58:12] this coin
[58:13] you see what I'm saying we've got some
[58:16] coins that's missing
[58:18] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[58:20] Temperance right patience goodness
[58:23] godness brother kindness you know the
[58:26] whole thing
[58:27] we can't allow any of those coins to be
[58:31] missing
[58:32] or we will be accounted as a adulteress
[58:40] how can you help me find you get on your
[58:43] knees and pray
[58:45] that God will establish you as a perfect
[58:48] man
[58:49] before Christ comes
[58:51] you understand me
[58:53] all these things the word Nations seek
[58:55] after for the father knoweth that you
[58:57] have need of these things but rather
[59:00] seek ye the kingdom of God
[59:03] and all these things shall be added
[59:06] get the Holy Ghost let God seal you
[59:10] first and everything else is coming and
[59:14] if God should take anything away from
[59:16] you you it wouldn't matter to you
[59:18] because you know you sealed with the
[59:20] Holy Ghost and you got a better Kingdom
[59:22] coming
[59:23] he said fear not and y'all know it's the
[59:26] truth I have to be careful
[59:29] because I I can get into a
[59:32] a nervous condition because I see God
[59:35] coming I see his moving I see
[59:37] politically I see everything moving and
[59:39] I keep searching myself every day Lord
[59:41] do I have it
[59:42] do I have it like the Bible says see why
[59:46] you say that because in this day this is
[59:49] the most deceptive age ever
[59:52] millions of people thinking that God the
[59:55] Holy Ghost and living any kind of life
[59:57] but yet they got the Holy Ghost because
[59:59] they spoke in tongues no sir
[1:00:02] speaking in tongues is okay
[1:00:04] God speaks in tongues but what God is
[1:00:08] looking for is the Life of Christ in you
[1:00:12] that's what we need more than anything
[1:00:16] but rather seek ye the kingdom of God
[1:00:18] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:00:21] you fear not
[1:00:23] Little Flock Don't Be Afraid trust God
[1:00:28] if God said he's going to give it to you
[1:00:29] he'll give it to you
[1:00:31] I try to tell people the Bible says
[1:00:33] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:00:38] and God shall give you the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] that's a that's a direct quote
[1:00:45] and a direct promise
[1:00:47] and you need to pull it up on God
[1:00:49] sometime if you feel like you don't have
[1:00:51] it you ought to say Lord I have obeyed I
[1:00:55] have repented I've been baptized in your
[1:00:58] name and Lord you promised me the Holy
[1:01:02] Ghost I want it
[1:01:04] God can't break his word
[1:01:11] for it is your father's good pleasure
[1:01:14] to give you the kingdom
[1:01:18] huh sale that you have give arms provide
[1:01:22] yourself bags which wax not all a
[1:01:25] treasure in the heavens that fail is not
[1:01:27] where do thieves approaches neither does
[1:01:30] moth corrupt
[1:01:32] you know there was a lot of people
[1:01:34] that's how they died and saw them
[1:01:37] you know when they went preaching they
[1:01:39] had just got a new house
[1:01:40] a new vote read the scripture that they
[1:01:43] had summer houses and winterhouses and
[1:01:45] they were rich
[1:01:47] and you telling me that Judgment of God
[1:01:50] is going to fall down yeah
[1:01:54] they were so into their possessions till
[1:01:57] they couldn't believe the gospel and
[1:01:59] they got caught
[1:02:01] you understand me this is not a time to
[1:02:05] store up things on the earth it's good
[1:02:07] to have what you can have but make sure
[1:02:09] you got God first
[1:02:13] you could be a millionaire God don't
[1:02:15] care about that
[1:02:16] because the least person in heaven got
[1:02:19] more than that
[1:02:21] God don't care about these frivolous
[1:02:23] things God cares about one thing
[1:02:26] and that's whether you're giving him
[1:02:28] your all
[1:02:33] he won't take second place with no man
[1:02:35] nobody
[1:02:36] sell that you have give our arms provide
[1:02:38] yourself bags which wax not all a
[1:02:41] treasure in Heavens in the heavens that
[1:02:44] fail us not where no Thief approaches
[1:02:46] neither both moth corrupts for where
[1:02:49] your treasure is there will your heart
[1:02:52] be also
[1:02:55] so you see these people
[1:03:00] brother Isaac even as they claim to love
[1:03:04] God
[1:03:06] wherever their treasure is
[1:03:08] wherever the heart is
[1:03:10] that's their treasure
[1:03:12] because when God is your treasure you're
[1:03:15] here
[1:03:18] you love the word you love to hear the
[1:03:20] word we're not talking about flesh
[1:03:22] sometimes we flip the flesh fight you
[1:03:24] he's supposed to he's it's inventory
[1:03:26] enmity between God and this flesh he's a
[1:03:30] mule he's a hybrid
[1:03:32] he doesn't like to come to church nor
[1:03:34] does he want to worship God but the
[1:03:37] inner man must learn how to bind this
[1:03:40] thing
[1:03:42] the inner man is supposed to be the
[1:03:44] strong man bind him
[1:03:47] and let go and let God have his way
[1:03:51] psalms 27 1-14 we all know this
[1:03:56] scriptures but this is beautiful the
[1:03:59] Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:04:03] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:04:06] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:04:09] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:04:13] and my foes Came Upon me to eat of My
[1:04:17] Flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:04:20] now we're looking at the scripture and
[1:04:23] no doubt it means to partake or to kill
[1:04:26] or to however devour you amen
[1:04:29] I don't know but one thing for certain
[1:04:32] to eat up your flesh it needs to devour
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:37] to consume you to what destroy you
[1:04:41] but the Bible said they stumbled and
[1:04:44] fell
[1:04:45] now that sounds familiar because when
[1:04:48] they went to take Jesus and he says I am
[1:04:51] he they came close to him and what
[1:04:53] happened they fell backwards
[1:04:56] so he's proven to us
[1:04:58] that the anointing of God
[1:05:02] will do just that y'all remember that
[1:05:05] it's in the scripture
[1:05:07] the gospel
[1:05:11] there was a time they went to capture
[1:05:13] him and the Bible said he walked
[1:05:15] straight through the crowd
[1:05:19] say it like this when the pressure and
[1:05:21] the squeeze come we don't have to fear
[1:05:24] they could look right at us and not see
[1:05:26] us
[1:05:27] it all depends on what God determines
[1:05:31] come on somebody
[1:05:35] I remember the time sister Karen talked
[1:05:38] about and y'all don't some of y'all
[1:05:39] don't know her but she was in the world
[1:05:41] and and she was not a good girl
[1:05:44] and she had to run for her life and this
[1:05:46] man said I'm gonna kill you and when I
[1:05:48] catch you I'm gonna cut you up in pieces
[1:05:51] she ran and then she ran into the
[1:05:53] backyard of this house where a light was
[1:05:56] and then she thought oh my God there's
[1:05:58] no way out she was fenced in
[1:06:00] and the Lord said stand in the light
[1:06:05] she stood right
[1:06:09] there the man's
[1:06:12] man never did see her
[1:06:16] what if she had of disobeyed him Lord I
[1:06:19] can't stand right here over here there's
[1:06:22] a shadow she would have been caught
[1:06:25] but God says stand in the light
[1:06:27] she stood right there in the light she
[1:06:30] said that fella came so close to her and
[1:06:32] never could see her
[1:06:34] that's the kind of thing that made her a
[1:06:37] Christian
[1:06:38] she saw God in in his glorious ways
[1:06:42] leaving her and guiding her and that's
[1:06:45] something you can't take from her

[1:07:04] war shall arise against me in this will

[1:07:18] many of y'all know that
[1:07:19] we're becoming enemy
[1:07:25] it's rising up and you know what that is
[1:07:28] the Bible
[1:07:30] and all of these people are going to
[1:07:32] unite against the Lord and his Christ
[1:07:35] just like they did Jesus
[1:07:40] hello
[1:07:41] and guess what
[1:07:43] even the religious people
[1:07:46] will persecute the true bride
[1:07:49] try to anyway
[1:07:52] though a hosting Camp against me who
[1:07:54] persecuted Jesus the Pharisees in the
[1:07:57] sadduce
[1:07:58] you see under the head shall be wrong
[1:08:01] that right
[1:08:05] one thing I desired of the Lord one
[1:08:08] thing
[1:08:10] I don't care about Golden Slippers
[1:08:13] and all these things people
[1:08:16] sing about I have one desired of the
[1:08:19] Lord that will I what seek after that I
[1:08:22] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:08:26] the days of my life I behold the beauty
[1:08:30] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[1:08:35] think about it
[1:08:36] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:08:41] me y'all better go home and memorize
[1:08:44] this screen
[1:08:46] but in a time of trouble he shall hide
[1:08:49] me where in his Pavilion that's the
[1:08:52] rapture
[1:08:53] in the secret of this Tabernacle shall
[1:08:56] he hide me he shall set me what upon a
[1:08:59] rock let me tell you something the name
[1:09:02] of the Lord is the name it's the it's
[1:09:04] the character of the Lord
[1:09:06] Hallelujah
[1:09:08] is that right let me say it again the
[1:09:11] name of the Lord is the character of the
[1:09:13] name Lord his name used to be Jehovah
[1:09:16] Jireh
[1:09:18] the Jehovah shalom
[1:09:20] why did his name change because he was
[1:09:22] then what uh a reflecting another part
[1:09:25] of his character
[1:09:27] now in this day he's reflecting more of
[1:09:31] his character and it's being reflected
[1:09:33] through the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:09:35] what are you saying he's showing us a
[1:09:37] Grace like he's never shown any grace
[1:09:39] before
[1:09:42] we're living in the most wickedest age
[1:09:44] ever
[1:09:46] but we've got more grace
[1:09:48] and the Bible says his grace will abound
[1:09:52] Hallelujah
[1:09:54] set me upon a rock what rock the
[1:09:56] Revelation Upon This Rock I build my
[1:09:59] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:10:01] Prevail against what rock that Jesus is
[1:10:04] God Jesus of the New Testament is
[1:10:07] Jehovah of the old
[1:10:09] figure it out
[1:10:11] but the Bible said in him dwelt the
[1:10:13] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:10:16] Hallelujah so much soul is Saint John 10
[1:10:20] 30. Jesus said I and the father are one
[1:10:25] hello somebody
[1:10:29] now should my head be lifted up lift up
[1:10:32] your heads all your Gates
[1:10:34] and be lifted up Hallelujah above my
[1:10:38] enemies round about me that's right
[1:10:41] why should I let my enemies have my head
[1:10:44] hung down I know who I am
[1:10:48] you got to know who you are you're not
[1:10:50] just anybody or any person God has
[1:10:53] chosen you and elected you to be bride
[1:10:55] you're the Queen of Heaven the real
[1:10:57] queen
[1:11:01] therefore without offering his
[1:11:03] Tabernacle what sacrifices of joy y'all
[1:11:06] know what that means I don't feel like
[1:11:08] it but I'm gonna shout anyhow I don't
[1:11:10] feel like it but I'm gonna praise Him
[1:11:12] anyhow I don't feel like him but I'm
[1:11:14] gonna glorify his name in the Ohio it's
[1:11:17] a sacrifice
[1:11:19] he plays it that way because Lord lost
[1:11:22] sacrifices
[1:11:24] Hallelujah is when you lay down your
[1:11:26] feelings
[1:11:27] and you give him praise Glory and Honor
[1:11:30] I will sing yeah I will sing praises
[1:11:32] unto the Lord
[1:11:34] people don't want to hear but I'm going
[1:11:35] to tell you something people of God
[1:11:37] if people somebody gonna make this
[1:11:40] Rapture they must have the revelation of
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ of this day
[1:11:45] I'm not saying they're not saved but to
[1:11:48] make a rapture you got to know who Jesus
[1:11:51] is
[1:11:52] he can't be some denominational Jesus
[1:11:57] everybody says he's a word
[1:11:59] but let me tell you this what is the
[1:12:02] word
[1:12:04] the word is God
[1:12:06] but God manifests himself in so many
[1:12:09] ways
[1:12:12] one age knew him as justification
[1:12:14] another age knew him has sanctification
[1:12:16] another age renewing him as at the
[1:12:19] restoration of the gifts so what is he
[1:12:22] is today he's the fullness of the word
[1:12:24] god comes down to fill the Bride of
[1:12:28] Jesus Christ with his character
[1:12:31] Hallelujah all that was in God he poured
[1:12:33] it into Christ and all that was in
[1:12:35] Christ he poured into his church that's
[1:12:38] it
[1:12:40] it ain't how well you sing and all how
[1:12:43] good you preach a lot of preachers will
[1:12:45] end up in hell
[1:12:48] singers too
[1:12:50] musicians name it
[1:12:54] you got to know Jesus and he's got to
[1:12:56] know you right the most important part
[1:12:59] is that he he he you know him he know
[1:13:03] him knowing you how you say it
[1:13:05] it's knowing you right he's got to know
[1:13:08] you because remember when they said Lord
[1:13:11] we cast out devils in your name we did
[1:13:13] wonderful Miracles we did all of this he
[1:13:15] said depart from me you workers of
[1:13:16] iniquity that means you need to do good
[1:13:19] right many people know amen that the
[1:13:22] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:23] Christ is right but because of their
[1:13:25] organizations and their Charters and all
[1:13:28] of these things they won't don't want to
[1:13:29] be put out
[1:13:30] I don't care the Bible is right and I
[1:13:35] don't care how many miracles and how
[1:13:36] many signs and how many wonders they do
[1:13:39] when they fail to do the word knowing
[1:13:42] what it says
[1:13:44] God Cuts them off
[1:13:48] that's what happened the only way you
[1:13:50] can know God in this hour you got to go
[1:13:52] all the way you know how that song well
[1:13:54] I'm going all the way just to see him
[1:13:58] the one who suffered and died for me
[1:14:03] maybe we're saying that
[1:14:06] when thou seek
[1:14:13] you understand me when he came in this
[1:14:16] day what did he do
[1:14:18] he Vindicated himself by showing his
[1:14:20] face
[1:14:22] in the clouds
[1:14:24] and those who seek his face the
[1:14:27] revelation of what that was all about
[1:14:30] my heart said unto them thee thy face
[1:14:33] Lord will I see see this word is
[1:14:35] prophecy you got to understand David
[1:14:37] perhaps didn't even know what he was all
[1:14:39] writing but he was writing under the
[1:14:41] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and this
[1:14:42] word is for you it's for me hard not thy
[1:14:46] face far from me put not thy servant
[1:14:50] away in Anger thou has been my help lead
[1:14:53] me not
[1:14:54] neither forsake me o God of my salvation
[1:14:57] when my this is part of life when my
[1:15:00] father and my mother forsake me then the
[1:15:04] Lord will take me up y'all hear that
[1:15:07] family against families that the Bible
[1:15:11] he said your greatest enemies of your
[1:15:13] own household
[1:15:15] they will turn against you he said but
[1:15:17] even in that time God Will Take Me Up
[1:15:22] teach me that way O Lord and leave me in
[1:15:25] a plain path because my enemies deliver
[1:15:28] me not over to the unto the will of mine
[1:15:31] enemies for false Witnesses are risen up
[1:15:34] against me and such as breathe out
[1:15:36] cruelty and that's what's happening even
[1:15:38] now
[1:15:40] people hate Christians
[1:15:42] and they will make up lies
[1:15:45] they did it on Jesus
[1:15:48] he said listen you gotta this is a
[1:15:50] serious thing I know I'm preaching but
[1:15:52] I'm gonna tell you something what I'm
[1:15:53] talking about is more serious than
[1:15:55] anything that I personally have
[1:15:57] encountered as of yet in my Christian
[1:16:00] walk
[1:16:01] because here the word of God David said
[1:16:03] I had fainted
[1:16:05] in other words I would have faith I
[1:16:07] would have given up unless I had
[1:16:10] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[1:16:12] in the land of the living wait on the
[1:16:16] Lord be of good courage and he shall
[1:16:18] strengthen thy heart wait I say on the
[1:16:23] Lord you can't change yourself but we
[1:16:26] know the man who can
[1:16:28] Hallelujah you love the Lord we're
[1:16:31] living in a time and I'm gonna hurry up
[1:16:33] we're living in a time where the church
[1:16:35] age is blind and I hate to use this word
[1:16:40] insane
[1:16:42] all of that and more
[1:16:45] the whole world
[1:16:48] Hallelujah and to be means to a
[1:16:52] less Advanced and mental physical or
[1:16:55] Social Development then is usually for
[1:16:58] one age
[1:16:59] one's age now you know people are not
[1:17:01] thinking good anymore it just seems like
[1:17:03] and I don't know it seemed like the
[1:17:05] people that I know that smoke dope
[1:17:09] whatever you call it Reef or whatever
[1:17:10] and they continue seeing like they lose
[1:17:12] something they remain like children
[1:17:16] they don't know how to handle
[1:17:20] um
[1:17:21] mature things
[1:17:23] they always like children
[1:17:26] and you expect them looking at their age
[1:17:28] and looking at what they should be but
[1:17:30] you know they might be 40 50 years old
[1:17:32] acting like 20 year old
[1:17:34] something happens there don't tell you
[1:17:37] that that thing mentally walks your way
[1:17:39] of thinking it slows down your maturity
[1:17:41] or maturing
[1:17:44] something happens to them because
[1:17:45] everybody I know like that is like that
[1:17:52] I told you listen what he says I told
[1:17:54] you the other day they were taking an
[1:17:57] analysis
[1:17:58] Because by the way I'm speaking they
[1:18:00] have the schools in Arizona where I live
[1:18:02] and 80 percent of the children in school
[1:18:05] is mentally
[1:18:08] what will their children be we can't
[1:18:12] have another generation we're at the end
[1:18:15] Jesus said these things would come look
[1:18:18] at all the televisions and things
[1:18:20] getting these uh fictitious things in
[1:18:23] order
[1:18:24] it'll come a time I predict
[1:18:27] he didn't say thus the Lord he said I
[1:18:29] predict that people will be completely
[1:18:31] totally insane the world will be
[1:18:36] the Bible speak of such hideous sights
[1:18:38] as they show in movies today of some
[1:18:41] prehistoric creatures eggs that lived in
[1:18:44] the Earth for so many thousands and
[1:18:46] millions of years hats and come forth to
[1:18:49] some that's just a minor thing to what's
[1:18:53] going to happen when hell is open and
[1:18:56] the Devil comes out with all of his
[1:18:58] mysterious things of women of locusts
[1:19:01] with hair like women and teeth like
[1:19:03] lions why the world would be completely
[1:19:06] totally insane it's not just but but I
[1:19:10] just about one he says listen it's not
[1:19:13] just but just about one degree from it
[1:19:16] now he said but oh listen he said but
[1:19:19] all is for the glory of God oh for the
[1:19:23] coming of Lord Jesus Oh for the for the
[1:19:26] Holy Ghost see for the no soul for the
[1:19:30] living presence of the Living God all of
[1:19:32] these things that happening now is
[1:19:35] because God told all them Saul they
[1:19:37] disobeyed God and this is what is
[1:19:40] happening
[1:19:41] why do this generation think that they
[1:19:44] can escape destruction
[1:19:46] when in the days of Noah they did not
[1:19:49] search your history Every Nation every
[1:19:52] group of people that ever refused God
[1:19:56] they end up somewhere in the fire or the
[1:19:58] flood
[1:20:01] y'all understand that he says certainly
[1:20:03] we are certainly living in the last days
[1:20:07] they are breeding different things
[1:20:10] together Crossing up and it makes a
[1:20:13] product that's no good
[1:20:14] is that all day
[1:20:17] I mean you can go get cotton candy
[1:20:18] grapes
[1:20:23] cotton candied grapes grapes that taste
[1:20:26] like cotton candy I've tried them
[1:20:29] but you know they're not doing any good
[1:20:31] for you
[1:20:32] on that sweet hybrid corn that tastes so
[1:20:36] delicious It ain't giving you nothing
[1:20:39] almost everything you buy out of the
[1:20:41] regular stores is hybrid and that's why
[1:20:43] people are catching cancer and
[1:20:45] everything else
[1:20:47] your body don't even know how to digest
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:52] that's why God said pray over your food
[1:20:56] don't take the hybrid
[1:21:00] protect me from this poison
[1:21:05] right somebody brought it to my mind the
[1:21:07] other day said you know what people we
[1:21:10] hardly ever had diabetes one day one
[1:21:12] years ago some countries never get it
[1:21:14] because they eat the right stuff
[1:21:17] but what has happened to us you know why
[1:21:19] we get sick because we don't do nothing
[1:21:22] anymore
[1:21:23] we used to eat we don't even we even our
[1:21:25] risk is is weak you know we used to turn
[1:21:28] the faucet on and turn it off
[1:21:30] now we yeah
[1:21:34] almost get an attitude when it don't
[1:21:36] come on when you want it
[1:21:39] what's wrong with the soap machine
[1:21:43] you see what I'm saying
[1:21:45] we used to walk everywhere
[1:21:48] we don't walk
[1:21:50] and no matter how many gems you get
[1:21:53] we still repeating the same thing over
[1:21:57] y'all understand what I'm saying it's
[1:21:59] science
[1:22:00] it's science
[1:22:02] and they've been mad because we got more
[1:22:05] people living but they're the reason
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:12] so let's kill them all folks let's kill
[1:22:14] them off we got too many people living
[1:22:15] and I'm telling you something y'all
[1:22:17] better y'all better understand the
[1:22:19] people in in the early church age like
[1:22:22] you know Herod and and and and all of
[1:22:26] those rulers of Rome they were insane go
[1:22:29] go read go read stuff the stuff they did
[1:22:32] to Christians
[1:22:34] and for some reason we don't forgot
[1:22:36] yeah we've forgotten and we know history
[1:22:40] repeats itself
[1:22:45] this time Jesus said it won't be water
[1:22:47] it'll be fine
[1:22:50] through doing this this is causing up
[1:22:53] everything I'm almost done through doing
[1:22:54] this I was reading in a medical journal
[1:22:57] I believe it was and then in the
[1:23:00] Reader's Digest of how that has changed
[1:23:03] the course of life for people it's even
[1:23:06] perverting men and women that men are
[1:23:08] becoming more like women and women like
[1:23:11] man men are becoming sissies and women
[1:23:14] are becoming masculine it's hybrid stuff
[1:23:17] you see that cell that we eat from these
[1:23:20] animals that's hybrid is actually not
[1:23:23] not right sells for us therefore in
[1:23:27] doing that uh see that cell from the
[1:23:30] animal or self from the wheat or sell
[1:23:33] from the corn is not right sell in order
[1:23:36] to let this grow like a like like look
[1:23:40] like a bigger it has to be sprayed with
[1:23:43] all all the time now a genuine plan a
[1:23:47] good healthy plan does not have to be
[1:23:50] spread hate it all no bugs would bother
[1:23:52] it because it has a repellent itself
[1:23:56] that it puts out that keeps all the bugs
[1:23:59] off of it now that's God's way what
[1:24:02] brought sickness into the world was sin
[1:24:05] and when man dropped away from God's
[1:24:08] provided way he opened himself up to
[1:24:11] every devil there was to sickness and so
[1:24:14] forth because he has to keep medicine
[1:24:18] and sprayed and it's just each
[1:24:20] generation in breathing into another now
[1:24:24] inbreeding into another now you might be
[1:24:27] a Christian and your wife might be a
[1:24:29] Christian but the genes of your body is
[1:24:32] still the inheritance from your father
[1:24:35] and your grandfather and on down see and
[1:24:38] Daniel said each generation would get
[1:24:41] weaker and wiser
[1:24:43] and it's got the whole race a whole
[1:24:47] human race dying
[1:24:50] hmm
[1:24:53] I know time wise we can't finish
[1:24:55] but I'm gonna read this one scripture
[1:24:57] that I'm going to preach it but I want
[1:24:58] to read this because
[1:24:59] Psalms 91 1-8
[1:25:03] he that dwell in the secret place of the
[1:25:06] most high shall abide
[1:25:08] under the shadows of the Almighty
[1:25:11] I will save the Lord he is my refuge and
[1:25:15] my Fortress my God and him will I trust
[1:25:20] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:25:23] snares of the Fowler and from the north
[1:25:26] North some pestilence
[1:25:29] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:25:32] and under his wing shall thou trust his
[1:25:35] truth his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:25:38] Buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the
[1:25:42] terror by night nor for The Hour That
[1:25:45] flyeth by day nor for the pestilence
[1:25:48] that walketh in darkness nor for the
[1:25:51] destruction that wasted at some Noonday

[1:26:49] deliver him and honor him
[1:26:52] with a long life will I satisfy him and
[1:26:55] show him my salvation

[1:27:02] what God has done in this day
[1:27:05] and when God sent us the eagle
[1:27:08] and with us amen taking this message and
[1:27:11] reading and studying it and loving and
[1:27:13] falling in love with this we hide
[1:27:15] ourselves under those eagles wings

[1:27:42] he was born a man but in the in that man
[1:27:45] it was God
[1:27:47] he said brother but I said I have always
[1:27:49] preached that he was deity not just a
[1:27:52] man he was God manifested In the Flesh
[1:27:55] God the attribute of god of love the
[1:28:00] great attribute that comes down in this
[1:28:01] play here on Earth of God Jesus was
[1:28:04] God's love which built a body that
[1:28:07] Jehovah himself lived in he was a
[1:28:10] fullness of the godhead bodily what God
[1:28:12] was he manifested through that body that
[1:28:16] body had to die so he could wash the
[1:28:19] bride with his blood
[1:28:22] and notice not only is The Blood Washed
[1:28:25] forgiven but she is Justified see did
[1:28:29] you ever try the word justify to see
[1:28:33] what it means see that's the thing

[1:28:38] to make it no get the Holy Ghost you
[1:28:40] made it
[1:28:42] ceiling of the Holy Ghost now for
[1:28:44] instance if brother green heard that I
[1:28:47] have been drinking and I have been doing
[1:28:49] bad things then he found out that I

[1:29:35] until it puts the book of God
[1:29:38] it puts in the book of God's
[1:29:40] forgetfulness see he's the only one can
[1:29:43] do it we can't we can forgive but not
[1:29:47] forget
[1:29:48] I could forgive you but I always
[1:29:50] remember you've done these evil things
[1:29:53] then you're not just you're forgiven but

[1:30:02] first place amen standing there married

[1:30:58] and because Peter
[1:31:00] wasn't didn't have the Holy Ghost he
[1:31:02] fought
[1:31:04] flesh with flesh
[1:31:06] Jesus said put the sword up
[1:31:08] if you fight with the swords you'll die
[1:31:10] by the sword
[1:31:16] but after Peter was converted
[1:31:19] the Bible said Peter after you are
[1:31:21] converted strength in your brother
[1:31:23] and when they came God revealed to Peter
[1:31:26] this is your day to die
[1:31:28] and when they came to get Peter he
[1:31:31] didn't fast he didn't fight
[1:31:34] and when they took him and they were
[1:31:35] going to crucify him they were going to
[1:31:37] crucify this is this is under Josephus
[1:31:39] this is history
[1:31:41] Peter says no no no no no no I'm not
[1:31:44] worthy to be crucified like my Lord
[1:31:47] turn me upside down
[1:31:50] so he was crucified upside down
[1:31:54] y'all understand me he didn't fight
