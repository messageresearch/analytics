his Mercy as we stand we have you turn with us 1 Chronicles glad to be in the house of the Lord we missed you guys but my wife and I had a great time thank you for your prayers and then we believe that it was your prayers that made the meeting that made the meeting so successful 1 Chronicles the 16th chapter we're just going to read the 344th verse there verse 34 he says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever Genesis 22 we read the 17th and 18th verse there 17 that that in blessings I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy SE shall possess the Gate of his enemy 18th verse and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice let us pray father God we come before you we thank you Lord for being so good to us we thank you father for waking us up this morning closing in our right mind we thank you for the time and opportunity that we have here Lord God to hear from you to feel your presence and to know that you're here Lord not just only because your word says where two or three are gathered in my name there you are in the midst but also because you said you'll never leave us nor forsake us for this reason we know that we're never alone father we thank you God for being so good to us for granting us Mercy because we all need your mercy we all need your grace father we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated uh in in this day we realize that often time we forget uh just how blessed we are we forget the work that God has already done and the Bible even tells us that the work was finished before the foundation of the world this is a a a testing ground this is what we are now going through to not only express our love to the Lord by being obedient to his word but we're here to manifest In the Flesh what it means to have mercy what it means to have Grace what it means to have love and all of these things that we uh do have are not things that you can touch or feel but the greatest of all blessings are the spiritual blessings there are certain types of blessings you have the spiritual blessings the material and financial blessings the undeserved blessings and the unsolicited blessings either way you look at it they are all blessings but personally if I had a choice between the four I would choose God's spiritual blessing because to me the spiritual blessing supersedes the natural the Bible said you can gain the whole world and lose your soul but when your soul has been quickened it really doesn't matter whether you gain the world or not because the blessings of your soul they are Eternal no wonder the uh scripture says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his Mercy endures forever David picks it up and said his Mercy endure to all generations and I'm glad tonight to know that his Mercy didn't run out with me But realize tonight there's a reason why his Mercy finds you there's a reason why his grace finds you the Bible said he died for the whole world but even as the prophet of God saids God knew that the whole world wouldn't receive him but there is a seed that God ordained before the foundation of the world that will receive him with joy is that right it's not a seed that you can be educated into or promoted by a man but it's something that God gave us before we even knew him is that all right when God chose Abraham we all know that the story about that Abraham was from the land of the Chalan he was he was he was Babylonian a country that was full of idols and and full of sin God didn't call Abraham because he was right righteous but God called Abraham to show Abraham his mercy and his grace Abraham didn't even know God but in Abraham's Journey he came to trust and believe in God think about this now Abraham for years followed God and all he had was his voice he had never seen him but he knew that the voice he heard was God so is it with Abraham SE we know that the voice that we hear is from God hallelujah we have heard many voices uh but when God called us even though we had not yet seen him we know the voice of God the Bible says that my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger there will not follow but when God blessed Abraham he blessed Moses he blessed David he blessed every seed that was in Abraham y understand me this is why God calls him the father of many nations Hallelujah and the Abraham seed is a seed of blessing not a seed of cursing a seed of blessing Hallelujah and if God has blessed you no man can curse you hallelujah hallelujah Deuteronomy 33 and 1 we find out that Moses blessed the children of Israel before his death now I'm not going to go through all of the blessings but I want you to read that on your own to see how God blessed the children of Israel through Moses Hallelujah you see Moses couldn't help but to give out blessings to his children because he himself was a blessing and tonight you're blessing I'm not talking about your flesh I'm talking about in your soul you are a blessing never forget that because Satan will make you feel like you cursed and nothing can curse you we can go back we can go all the way to the end where Jesus said blessed is the man who readed the book and blessed is the man who hears the sayings of this book you're blessed in the alpha and you're blessed in the Omega Hallelujah hallelu and realize no weapon as we often say formed against you shall prosper but you you got to believe who you are you got to understand who you are and even even your identity must be a revelation hallelujah hallelujah it's not because you're born in a preachers family or some saint that that that that's been in church for years you're blessed because you can hear the voice of God is that right see if you're not a god you may hear sounds but you'll never hear his voice because Jesus says my sheep heareth my voice that's one of the blessings of the seed Hallelujah that God implanted in you is that right before the foundation of the world brother brandham said it like this he said even when you was a sinner you knew you were different Hallelujah he said something pulled on you even then when your friends could do evil things God wouldn't let you go but so far you you felt that there were you were different and and because of this feeling you became the black sheep of the family that's the truth and then the world didn't want you Hallelujah you just didn't know where you fit as brother Adam said it like this you was a chicken in an eagle you know you was an eagle in a chicken yard Hallelujah the the the the way the things were there the way things were there is what made you thirst for something else Hallelujah you were a misfit an eyeball but God had his hand on you all alone Hallelujah I'm going say it like this and I love this scripture now I'm falling in love with it the table is prepared before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointed my head with oil when I when I see that when I see that my whole life has been prepared from from the time of my birth until the time that I either die or or Rapture God has already laid it out let me show you this none of you knew that one day you was going to be in Iowa Hallelujah not even me I I was born in South Carolina God took me from South Carolina to Ohio he had to climatize me and he moved me from Ohio to Iowa this is no coincidence Hallelujah everything is moving by the power of God hallelujah God could have brought some of you and taken you anywhere but he brought you here and if he brought you here there is truly a Divine Purpose for it Hallelujah you don't fight the hand of God you move with God and you said nevertheless Lord not my will but thine be done hallelujah hallelujah this is revelation and you and I must understand in order for us to move forward we must we must know who we are and what God has called us to do Hallelujah God didn't call us to be church members God called us to be his body that's the difference now God didn't called you to be a message believer but he called you to be a message receiver Hallelujah huj because even the devil believes the message but he can't receive the message and you know what the message really is in in in a [Music] nutshell Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah that is the message in a nutshell Hallelujah is that all right God come to restore us will he do it he's already done it but we're just in the process is that right you say well wait a minute now God called Abraham a father of Nations when he didn't even have a son hallelujah hallelujah but he had to go go through the process time was on his side y'all hear me time was on his side he he wasn't in a hurry Hallelujah you can't get in a hurry you got to move by God's timing Hallelujah but know for certain you are blessed God blessed you and when God blesses you no man can curse you Hallelujah but we need to learn how to take on the trials that God places on us with Thanksgiving Hallelujah I'll say that again we must learn how to take on the trials and tests that God gives us with Thanksgiving is that the word the Bible said in all things give so you you you can't exclude some you got to take it all is that the truth when we took on this message the scroll was bitter and it was sweet when you take on this message you're going to experience the good times you're going to experience the bad times Hallelujah but in all these things we must give thanks Hallelujah St John 17 9-2 blessings blessings the blessings that you now have upon you didn't even start when you was a Christian it started before you was a Christian is that right and God protected you all of these years Moses didn't even know who he was he didn't even know he was a proper child when he was born Hallelujah but God had Angels protecting Moses because that seed was blessed and that seed had a purpose Hallelujah so is with you you can't even die until God has finished his purpose with you hallelujah hallelujah you are an invincible Army I'm telling you but you got to believe what you are when when you wait when you when you walk in faith you walk with with with Assurance not unbelief you walk in assurance show show me one light that is afraid of the darkness you'll never find one light that is afraid of the darkness when that light is cut on the darkness must back up Hallelujah and no matter how condensed the darkness is you still be able to see that light Hallelujah from a distance hallelujah hallelujah St John 17 ain't that amazing Jesus said he was the light of the world and then he said we are the lights of the world a city that cannot be here see two true Christianity can't be here when it's real you can't help but to say hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah you don't even know you're a Christian until you're tested it's your behavior that declares who and what you are oh you say oh my brother book say brother book what are you talking about when they Peter James and John in jail facing death they began to praise God y'all hear me that's where we falter we let the devil take our joy when in reality if we look at what God is doing we need to praise him you understand me something need to click God is in control whatever I'm going through this test is for me hallelujah hallelujah and I'm going to praise him I'm going to worship him I'm going to let the devil know that all is well hallu Hallelujah Hallelujah listen Jesus is praying he said I pray for them I pray not for the word but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine thine are mine and I am glorified in them y understand me he said father you gave them to me I gave them back to you those that are yours they are mine and they are glorified you you can't glorify God singing the blues Hallelujah you got to let this little light shine you know you got to let it shine you got to you got to let it let God glow through you Hallelujah and and don't get me wrong this come by yielding to the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost this is this is something we learned to do Hallelujah you understand me I'm sure Peter James and John had a moment to think you know devil is saying you're going to be wiped out you're going to die they going to kill you and no doubt they says so what so what whatever comes I'm going to praise him I'm telling you when you learn how to praise God under all circumstances Hallelujah that's is where your reward comes in Hallelujah that's when it says trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path hallelujah hallelujah right all of mine are thine thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one can I say this and I have been guilty but you've never seen Jesus in a sad continent I don't think he was smiling when he was going to Calvary but he had a seriousness on his face he had a Purp purp and his whole mind and thought was to fulfill that purpose did he have a sad moment in the garden he did but there was nobody there to witness it because everybody that would have seen him in that condition fell asleep Hallelujah even as a man he had to suffer and I want you to hear what I'm saying but he wasn't a seed he was dced and if dced went through those trials Hallelujah the Bible said he set his face like a flint like a flint down and he and he and he and he and he and he went to Calvary with a joy to know that he was getting ready to defeat the Devil and all that Satan had and all that Satan had won he was going to gain back he come to restore and he took his life to restore so let me stop right here if God is restoring and he is then what is he restoring in you Hallelujah we are supposed to be the expression of the restoration of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah we are to be the the the the restoration the manifestation of the restoration Hallelujah that he promised that he would do and if he's doing it see what it is we we don't see the great signs and wonders like we should and like we would if we had the character you understand me because how does he say it uh without character if you if you're going to do all the Supernatural and stuff without character he said that's satanic and we don't need that if anything be done let it be Jesus Christ doing it through us hallelujah is that all right but we're bless seed I want you to understand that Hallelujah glory to God I would they be one that that's powerful to me that is powerful to me because Jesus said that in in John 10:30 that he and the father was one I and the father are one and God's whole purpose in our day is to take a bride and make her one now what we need to understand we already won by the seed and brother B said everything that's in we've got what it takes to make a Rapture already in the sea but we but we must learn how to yield to our conditions not to fight the conditions but yield to them yield to the pressure because the pressure brings out the quality of of what's in you Hallelujah you don't become a loser Hallelujah when you're under pressure but know that that pressure is placed there to bring the virtues out right if they L had to be squeezed to bring out the O uh opium what about us he said while I was with them in the world I kept them in their name those that thou gave me I have kept wait a minute then was he just talking about the disciples but those that you have given me I have kept that means he kept me he kept you we we didn't keep ourselves he kept us and none of them is what lost but the son of predition that the scriptures might be filled fulfilled excuse me is that right so Moses blesses his people and every Prophet usually blesses or curses Jeremiah had a special calling and so did Malachi for cuz Malachi 4 comes with blessings and curses Hallelujah but in when it when when it comes to the seed of God Moses blessed the Seed of Abraham and the prophet of God showed us that the Seed of Abraham in this day are those who are filled with the Holy Ghost and receive the message for their day Hallelujah is that right the lord gave brother brandham the king's sword Hallelujah nowhere else in the scripture has we seen the king Soul Hallelujah huj I just know that when Joshua met the angel he had a sword that's the only one I know of but I know that this William brandom whatever happened to that sword ended up in the hands of brother Bram come on somebody you think Joshua just had his own sword hallelujah or the angel that went that Joshua saw had his own sword but Joshua knew his calling come on somebody now if you had seen an angel more than likely you faint but Joshua knew his commission he was a warrior and he said who side are you on he is talking to an angel who side are you on as though he was going to take on the challenge come on somebody see when you realize who you are and you know the commission that you are that you have then you know that no weapon I go back to you Hallelujah No Angel no principality nothing as as as as as Paul says can separate us from the love of God and we must understand that if we're in the Capstone if we're in The Headstone we are in the love of God and nothing can stop that protection you are protected by the love of God hallelujah hallelujah that's your blessing hallelujah hallelujah is that right when Abraham went down to Egypt and that that King wanted Sarah and Abraham lied about it Hallelujah but now God had protect Abraham he had to protect Sarah Hallelujah because Abraham got himself in a mess he didn't know how to get out of it God had to intervene Hallelujah and when you find yourself in a mess you don't know how to get out of it God will intervene because you are blessed you are blessed you are the bless Seed of Abraham let's put it like this you are the Blessed seed of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he didn't have children in the natural Hallelujah but he produced children in the spirit glory to God hallelujah glory to God and you are protected because you are his inheritance the word had been given to the bride this word has been given to the bride the king sword the word right the revelation of the word yeah what would brother brandham do with a sword if he couldn't use it but but he had to pass it on it's the revelation of this message it is the sword that destroys the work of the devil hallelujah amen this is the word of Revelation is that right because this sword was the same uh how can I say it when it came to the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders this was the king sword this is the word from the King Hallelujah and it was given to him in the form a book Hallelujah is that right the Bible is a sword it is God is that right that's the word of God it's sharper than the two-edged sword Hallelujah only one sword only one sword which is the king sword that can divide the soul and the spirit Hallelujah so it is the word of God which is the king sword that's not now in your mouth that's now in your heart but you must learn how to yield to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah because the king sword is only used by the king but through you is that right that same King sword you understand what I'm saying it's not only just to destroy or kill it gives life the word of L God gives life how can I say it do you think God just just made brother bandam just an example that we can just look at Hallelujah no no no no no no even when it comes to animals when they when they're training they're young they put them in positions and basically show them how they would behave in that position huah and that's what brother B was doing God was using him to show us the things that denominations don't know they can do Hallelujah we know that we have the ability to create not of not of our own accord but we know if God say say it we must say it Hallelujah the inspiration of this message Hallelujah as I said it places us back in Genesis 126 126 Hallelujah huj have dominion over the cattle Over the Sea over all the creeping things is that right brother spoke to the bull Hallelujah the bull had to obey he spoke to the bees the bees had to obey yall understand me he was a true Son of God that had come to a maturity Hallelujah waved over the people so that you and I must know this is where God wants us to be Hallelujah but just as God said to uh brother Brandon you got to you've got to be more mature you got to be more consecrated you can't play with the and expect God to use you Hallelujah and the even in the message the prophet tells us that we must have a total separation from all unbelief Hallelujah it is De God will use us in a great magnitude but it will never be an open show this is the word of Revelation that would give us the give the bride the victory in the love divine what are you talking about it was love that conquered the bull it was love that conquered the bees Hallelujah yall understand me that love must conquer everything for you Hallelujah this is the this is the headship this is the head stone Revelation that Love Will Conquer All Hallelujah right so just like I said even in the message Shalom paragraph 105 and brother said and we see in the midst of all of that the Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ promised for this day manifested itself and what he's saying is that God has manifested himself through all the ages but now through his ministry we can see that God has manifested manifesting himself through a son of man which which he promised would come before the coming of the Lord hallelujah he said now we're Witnesses of that Abraham's seed will always be able to hear the voice whatever Voice Hallelujah yeah I was thinking the other day just just Reminiscing on the Rapture and how brother brandham said this is so powerful to me I don't know that he said each angel will come up with his people hallelujah and I was just thinking the other day and I said you know it's so amazing that even though the graves were open they couldn't move move until Jesus moved those that were in the grave couldn't get up until Jesus got up y'all hear me and just like brother bam asked the angel will Paul have to answer for his and he and he said yes he said because I preached exactly what Paul preached you understand me so the Resurrection will be a resurrection of order hallelujah hallelujah and every [Music] Angel the very voice that call oh my God I'm just feeling real good right now but my point is there's coming a resurrection and we'll understand why this voice was so important to us hallelujah let me move on we're living in a wonderful time I didn't even tell you half of what I was thinking but shalom shalom to you who have word word down in your heart chose before the foundation of the world to hear the word for this day I'm just feeling good see what it's in your heart you were chosen to hear the word for this day you you've heard what I said before Billy couldn't satisfy you or robers couldn't satisfy you none of the preachers of this day I mean you play a tape and none of them can compare it does something on the inside of the inside and it's uncontrollable how many times you listened to a tape and a revelation strike you and now now now you're weeping for the before the Lord there's such a joy and it's just you and God yeah oh I can't explain it but my point is you could have never made yourself hear this and when people don't like his voice it's not the sound of it it's the spirit behind it is what aggravates them and they don't understand God placed it that that his voice behind brother Brandon's voice because he knew that only the Sheep would be able to listen listen to that voice right think about it a preacher with no style you know he ain't jumping and shouting and carrying on he's preaching a message and only the Sheep of God will be able to hear his voice Hallelujah that seed of blessing people say y'all crazy cult y'all y'all don't know what y'all talking about I had somebody say everything you believe is wrong and I'm saying to myself okay then what what is right then tell me what's right I'm saying that to myself now but you know people don't understand you can't help yourself I love that see cuz nothing can burn it out you they can cut your head off and you still have it they can boil you in oil and you can't you can't boil it out it's so connected because you and I have become one with it you understand what I'm saying and and and don't get me wrong I think a a Holiness man should live holy but God got you covered even if you make mistakes God got you covered because you're the seed hallelujah hallelujah is that right and Abraham was counted righteous because he believed God hallelujah is that right I heard something powerful maybe I should have known this all along brother B was talking about how Moses Beed the children up on of Israel up on E Eagle's Wings Hallelujah and thought about it and he said Moses was that eagle that bore the children on his wings y'all understand what I'm saying about that I'm saying if you just hold keep holding on to the feathers of the eagle y understand me he's the one that takes us in I'm just saying I'm just saying when I heard dead I'm like and was not brother bam an eagle that's all I'm saying we hold fast hold fast hold fast we it's just a little while longer Hallelujah is that all right you said well wait a minute brother but it was Mo it was God in Moses was Moses was a man Moses made mistakes he got mad he got angry Hallelujah is that right Elijah got mad he got angry and brother bam said when he called those Bears to eat those kids he said that was not the Lord hallelujah what about when he said Let the Fire Fall he said that wasn't the Lord but because he was a prophet God had to honor him Hallelujah hallelujah it's a bad year for you ahead let me let me back it up Shalom to you who have have word down in your heart chose before the foundation of the world to hear the word of this day if you don't it's a bad year for you ahead if you are is a great world for you ahead or a great day a great year coming now he goes on to say New Years Hallelujah now I'm going come down to a personal thing and I think what we need to do as individuals because we we get we get thrown off by church people everybody that comes here is not you know I mean and I I believe I would love to think that all of us are bride so we have three kinds of Believers right I believe that I don't have to believe it I see it with my own eyes brother B says now listen now closely listen still coming from the message Lord one paragra 110 do as David did put your future in his hands he says how what am I to know what to do brother Bram put your future in his hand no matter what comes or goes there you go trust him he is the word now know David said he his time is in my hand trust in him all the time always trust in him he knew who hell he knew who who held the future David did that's the reason he could say this there is only one holds there is only one holds the future and that's God he holds the future let him hold you all right is that all right amen amen let's go to uh Psalms 22 1-8 Psalm 62 1-8 God is good to us I might be getting off the rock a little bit but that was show of good I remember a dream I had when I was just a young fellow and in this dream I saw the Lord Jesus and the Rapture had taken place or or say it was in progress and I was standing inside the gate and Jesus was ahead of me and all these people came after me I can't even remember uh I just say it like this the people was over every nation seemly different nationalities I do know that and here I was as a boy I was playing this tamarine with seven tassels and these tassels were of Many Colors and as I was playing the tambourine that's why I play a tamarine now I didn't even know what a tamarine was and I played that tamarine because a vision or a dream it was a dream I had and as they came in I saw the gate closed and I was terrified because I didn't know the word but I stood there and I said oh I was thinking to myself he's not going to let me through or by him or in I forgot how it was but the moment I said that Jesus something snatched me and the next thing I know quickened me I was in front of Jesus Christ and he lifted me up in the air and he kissed me on my lips like a man with a woman and I woke up screaming and holling now I I had never experienced the Holy Spirit like that and at that point in time I didn't even know I was a Christian but I I I ran into my mother's room and I was screaming and holling telling her I saw Jesus and and and I'm going tell you that that he looked more like this that's why I knew that what all the other things I was seeing was not him my my mother got up after she settled down uh she said praise the Lord the Lord has called my son to preach that was the worst thing she could have ever said to me I never wanted to be a preacher and I walked out of my mother's room thinking I'll never go back to church because I do not want to be nobody's preacher well as you can see how well that works but I ran from God from that moment on I ran from God I didn't want to go to church uh anything like that and boy did I get a spanking by the time I by the time God finished with me I said Lord wherever you want me to go whatever you want me to do I'll do it I'm just saying these things I'm not I'm not trying to promote anything other than I know what brother Bram said about every leader has to give an account for the people for his people I didn't know that then but I know it now and I I I I tried to say something but he wouldn't let me say what I was what I'm looking at but I I'll tell you this it's closer than what we think and if you don't understand Grace you you you you might might miss it CU Satan is going to have you looking at your works and I'll tell you if that's what you're doing you need to go listen to the seven seal message again and listen to it closely as it goes back back to the end this flesh will never change until he Chang it it's going to be as wicked as has always been until Jesus Chang it but the en man is where the seed is that's where you are behind this sinful flesh all right I'm almost done I'm almost done you love the Lord uh Psalm 62 1-8 truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock in my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved are y'all understanding when someone else is your defense you don't have to be afraid or you you don't have to be scared he is your defense how long will you imagine Mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bow Boeing wall shall ye be and as a to tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in Li they bless with their mouth but they they curse inwards my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he says it again he is my defense I shall not be moved oh God God is my salvation in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all [Music] times ye people pour out your heart before him God is your Refuge God is a refuge for us right coming from the message Shalom 219 brother said how will people know Jesus Christ when they he sees him in you when they see Jesus in you for he says the works that I do shall you do also greater than this shall you do because I go to my father is that right that's how the world will know Hallelujah I'm going to shorten it I'm sorry you know I heard him say this today because i' I've myself have said this when God said Greater Works you shall do I said more but I was corrected on a message today when brother Bram said the Greater Works was more in the sense he created squirrels Hallelujah hallu Jesus was able to turn water into wine but he had something work with he multiplied the bread but he had substance to work with but in his this day he did something greater he created squirrels when there weren't no squirrels Hallelujah you see it was the same Jesus but the works became greater because the creation ability came back to the sun of is that right so understand he was able uh to do things that Jesus specifically did in this day and put it on record we're not saying he did do it but he promised that the works will be greater Hallelujah so that that really open my heart my mind in a way that I had never seen before CU often time we think that we need something a substance or we needed a commandment from God you can't do that on your own but when God speaks it he's saying you can do something greater you love the Lord amen he says now we see his word Vindicated we believe so if he Vindicated the word of today what is it what do I care about what the year brings what do I what do I care about the next year what do I care whether I live today or die today every word that he promised will be Vindicated everyone if he abide if if he is able to do it today after promising it 2,000 years ago if he's a th 100,000 years today Jesus will return to the Earth in a in a visible body for the church a redeemed the bride and take her out of here regardless of what comes goes Fashions say go on and people can wait on in total darkness and believe anything they want to believe but Jesus Christ will return again and I'm closing with that I had other but I'm going to close there but but let me say this to you by the grace of God when it comes down to the end of the road you're going to have to trust him with this last scripture Jude 22- 25 he said keep yourself in the love of God looking for the mercies of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and some have compassion making a difference and others say with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh 23d verse now I'm going to read this last this verse 24 and I I trust that you believe this now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen Hallelujah first of all he's able to keep you fall from falling and he's able to present you faultless and that's the only way that you can be presented so I just want to encourage you tonight because I know that everybody's going through a lot of stuff but don't forget who you are in the midst of all these trials remember you are the seed of God let stand and everything he promised he will do let's pray our gracious father God we come before you as hum as we know how Lord within ourselves we speak words that seems like an Impossible
