[50:43] morning
[50:44] breaking the straw every yoke of the
[50:47] enemy deliver your people from all of
[50:50] the leaf we ask these things and your
[50:54] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[50:57] you may be seated
[51:04] we were out to lunch with a brother and
[51:06] we were just talking by God's grace just
[51:12] how we are now facing Satan in a way
[51:17] that we've never had - it's tough but
[51:23] don't forget that your greatest enemy is
[51:25] not Satan as you our desires versus
[51:31] cause desires our will versus God's will
[51:35] when I believe that this is why Jesus
[51:38] Christ had to pray so vehemently there
[51:40] in the Garden of Eden because he himself
[51:43] had to die to his own will father would
[51:48] that this cup pass for me but not my
[51:49] will but thine be done so I drew up a
[51:53] topic the life of a warrior because I
[52:01] think oftentimes we as Christians forget
[52:03] that we are in a battle this battle is
[52:08] not easy
[52:10] anybody know how difficult it is to
[52:13] carry across but not only did Jesus
[52:17] carry a cross but he said those who
[52:20] follow me must carry on a cross is a
[52:24] symbol of shame it is a symbol of
[52:29] judgment it is a symbol that you are
[52:33] rejected the Bible said cursed is a man
[52:37] that hang at the pond the tree and we
[52:41] know that our Lord became a curse that
[52:42] we may become blessed but we are
[52:46] warriors this battle that we are now
[52:49] fighting is not something that just
[52:50] started before the foundation of the
[52:54] world we know that this battle was in
[52:56] array the Word of God said that Lucifer
[53:00] raised up he said with in his heart I
[53:04] will ascend above God I will ascend
[53:09] above the throne of God and I will cause
[53:11] the stars of God to worship me and of
[53:15] course when Lucifer made
[53:17] statement he had us in mind but thank
[53:21] God for Calvary the devil may say to you
[53:26] that you are of no value but you mean
[53:30] everything to God because Adam
[53:34] exemplified that as I said Wednesday
[53:38] Adam said and he had the whole world in
[53:40] his hands all that he had amen was
[53:43] beautiful he had a wife and she fell and
[53:46] Adam lost and gave up everything for his
[53:51] wife basically in himself he was saying
[53:55] paradise won't be the same without you
[53:59] who I love that I love that I love that
[54:03] it thrills me to know that God didn't
[54:07] want to live without me and you we
[54:13] realized they'd been when we talk about
[54:15] fighting we stood in that day you said
[54:19] brother Brooks I don't remember neither
[54:21] do i but we understand that the Word of
[54:24] God for our day tells us that we were in
[54:26] the mind of God
[54:27] and during that battle we stood with
[54:30] Christ there was a third or so that
[54:34] actually failed believe Satan's lie and
[54:39] we now call them demons but those demons
[54:43] one time were in a church service so was
[54:46] Lucifer they all worship God in the
[54:49] beginning but Lucifer started the
[54:52] rebellion y'all hear me now and in this
[54:56] rebellion God allowed him to do it he
[54:59] said well what do you mean because God
[55:01] allowed demons all those angels God knew
[55:05] would fall after Lucifer's preaching and
[55:09] now we see it happening all over again
[55:11] because Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega
[55:14] what happened in the beginning we are
[55:16] now seeing in the ending and we see by
[55:21] God's grace that those who stood with
[55:24] God or Christ in that day he's now
[55:27] standing with us
[55:30] cuz really no man can conquer Lucifer
[55:34] except Jesus himself because he was the
[55:37] greatest of all the Angels you know
[55:40] Beauty thought he was could see who the
[55:45] man could sing but in all of that he got
[55:50] lifted and right then the battle started
[55:55] Lucifer caused the first church split
[55:59] because of his own will now we talk
[56:03] about now now are we now so you
[56:07] understand by God's grace in our natural
[56:09] self there's no way we can conquer Satan
[56:14] believe you me he is the god of this age
[56:20] everything is now about the devil right
[56:22] all of the demons out of hell all the
[56:26] Hollywood stars and all of them that
[56:29] they are producing where do you think
[56:30] the inspiration comes from it doesn't
[56:34] come from heaven there's no violence in
[56:37] heaven there's only peace and joy and
[56:40] happiness holiness y'all you know what
[56:44] I'm saying here
[56:45] now you say what brother what are you
[56:47] saying I'm trying to get us to a place
[56:49] and I need to hurry up with this God is
[56:52] looking for warriors warriors are people
[56:57] who are trained most warriors are born
[57:03] warriors a warrior is a person who is
[57:09] engaged or experienced in warfare it's
[57:13] like when you get ready to have an
[57:14] operation
[57:15] you're not gonna happen some God that
[57:17] just graduated yesterday operate on you
[57:20] you want somebody that's in season
[57:22] somebody who's gone through the test of
[57:24] trials of failure but yet they knew how
[57:27] to spring back is that okay
[57:31] a warrior though he is faced with fear
[57:39] his courage
[57:42] the fear that's why the Bible tells us
[57:46] that love conquers fear cashes out
[57:50] hallelujah
[57:51] is that Alright God want this bride to
[57:56] be valiant want us to be bold and
[58:00] courageous and brave hallelujah we ought
[58:05] not to be afraid of the devil because
[58:08] the devil can't do me no harm
[58:13] hallelujah think about it if Satan in
[58:17] history y'all know about Napoleon some
[58:20] of us have read of him he died at the
[58:22] age of 33 amen and the message great in
[58:27] our mighty Conqueror
[58:28] we know that Napoleon amen
[58:32] conquered everything and you know he was
[58:38] one that Keller was like an astrologer
[58:40] he watched the moon he watched the stars
[58:42] he watched all those things to see win
[58:44] and the season was right to conquer his
[58:46] enemy and he came over into France and
[58:51] he become a great warrior he put me me
[58:56] to death because that they wouldn't
[58:58] agree with him and he cleaned his entire
[59:02] country of anything that was against him
[59:06] I like that because that is the marking
[59:12] of a real warrior he doesn't want
[59:18] anything to remain in his kingdom that
[59:22] will later on become a threat remember
[59:27] the time Amen God told us all kill
[59:32] everything and Saul was a warrior for
[59:36] his day he did great things but he made
[59:41] a mistake
[59:43] because he meant the word of the Lord
[59:46] told Saul to kill everything and saw
[59:48] thought within himself his own reasoning
[59:52] see a warrior a good warrior amen
[59:56] shows how to follow instructions without
[1:00:00] deviating hallelujah why because he
[1:00:05] realized the authority above him is more
[1:00:08] powerful more knowledgeable and more
[1:00:11] experienced than he himself so he knows
[1:00:17] the teacher knows what he's teaching and
[1:00:21] him saw had only understood that God
[1:00:24] spoke to him God knows what he's doing
[1:00:27] God doesn't need you to add or take away
[1:00:30] he said kill everything and because of
[1:00:33] the people so I thought that he has
[1:00:36] saved the best of the sheep and the oxen
[1:00:38] and all of these good things and oh you
[1:00:41] know I'm going to save the King to
[1:00:43] anybody knows a king is born a king and
[1:00:49] if it's a boring King he has to have
[1:00:52] followers and that's why all nations
[1:00:56] make sure they kill the king right
[1:01:00] because they know if they kill the king
[1:01:03] they've stocked out the kingdom but Saul
[1:01:08] thought ha I saved this King samuel came
[1:01:12] and said saw what have you done
[1:01:16] it's okay now I'm talking about warriors
[1:01:19] because you got to understand a warrior
[1:01:21] knows how to follow instructions and so
[1:01:29] a man said but I've done everything God
[1:01:31] told me to do Sam you're being a
[1:01:35] prophecy but what do I hear in the
[1:01:37] background I hear some sheeps I hear
[1:01:40] goats I hear all these animals in the
[1:01:42] background but you see okay so I Samuel
[1:01:44] what I did I thought I do God a service
[1:01:49] without it being his will God don't need
[1:01:54] your service he needs your beedi ins and
[1:01:57] as long as obedience is within his
[1:02:00] service you are accepting so Saul comes
[1:02:05] along and and Samuel says no no no no no
[1:02:08] no no you have not done
[1:02:10] what goddess is say so don't you
[1:02:13] understand that snow stubbornness is
[1:02:15] like witchcraft obedience is better than
[1:02:20] sacrifice bring me that King hallelujah
[1:02:25] and what did Sam you do he cut that king
[1:02:29] up he killed him because he was Elias
[1:02:33] about doing the will of God
[1:02:35] yeah I understand me it seems like them
[1:02:37] the word is brutal but you got to
[1:02:39] understand that was a shadow and the
[1:02:42] type of what's happening man if you
[1:02:45] don't kill the demons in you that demons
[1:02:47] will kill you the whole purpose about
[1:02:50] demons is to send your soul in my soul
[1:02:53] to hell how can we escape it by being
[1:02:58] obedient when it came to Napoleon I like
[1:03:04] it because even though Napoleon was the
[1:03:07] negative part of what God is doing see
[1:03:11] Christ was the same way he was a
[1:03:12] conqueror who conquered at the age of 33
[1:03:16] hallelujah and just like Napoleon will
[1:03:19] not allow anything in his kingdom that
[1:03:22] will work against him so is Jesus Christ
[1:03:25] Jesus Christ will not allow Saint to
[1:03:28] know anything about Satan to enter into
[1:03:31] his kingdom you talk about a warrior
[1:03:34] he's the greatest of all warriors who is
[1:03:39] this ok Psalm 16:11 through 12 says give
[1:03:44] us help from trouble for vain is the
[1:03:48] help of man through God we shall do
[1:03:51] valent Lee for he it is that shall tread
[1:03:55] down our enemies see the powers not
[1:03:59] within us it's not us that that
[1:04:01] literally defeats the devil is Christ in
[1:04:04] us is that right how many y'all have
[1:04:08] heard of Shamgar one time one name one
[1:04:12] place Amen he's named hallelujah the
[1:04:14] Bible none of us knew about sham God
[1:04:17] like I preached last week sham God Amen
[1:04:20] was just almost of nobody that God made
[1:04:22] somebody
[1:04:24] Shamgar was tired he was tired just like
[1:04:27] gideon he was tired of these these
[1:04:29] people coming in and treating and
[1:04:31] invading his family what were they doing
[1:04:34] taking the substance from his family
[1:04:36] hallelujah you ought to get tired of
[1:04:38] devil coming in into your house
[1:04:42] afflicting your children hallelujah
[1:04:45] making them do things that ought not to
[1:04:47] do you ought to get tired you ought to
[1:04:49] say if God be with us where we all the
[1:04:51] miracles sham God got so mad that day he
[1:04:57] he saw them it the enemy come and he got
[1:04:59] him a oxy goat and those of us who don't
[1:05:03] know what the Ox goat is is it's a long
[1:05:05] stick a man with the end point on it to
[1:05:08] when that ox don't want to move a man
[1:05:10] the man that's riding the thing stick
[1:05:12] him giddyup
[1:05:14] and that's what that's what that's what
[1:05:17] sham God did he took that stick and he
[1:05:21] with the beating now I'm going to show
[1:05:23] you something many of us in our own
[1:05:27] power to have trouble whipping one man
[1:05:30] but under the anointing of the Holy
[1:05:33] Spirit sham God defeated 600 oh somebody
[1:05:39] help me that's the kind of God I want to
[1:05:42] serve hallelujah that can give me
[1:05:45] strength when I am weak that's the rate
[1:05:48] that's the way it goes hallelujah
[1:05:50] now we realized by God's grace said
[1:05:52] warriors now I want you to understand
[1:05:54] that there's no way I can complete this
[1:05:56] message this morning but a warrior
[1:05:59] starts off as a soldier he's recruited
[1:06:04] in such a way a man that when he's
[1:06:07] recruited him and the person or persons
[1:06:09] that's training this warrior this man to
[1:06:13] be a warrior takes him away from his
[1:06:15] family he takes him from mother father
[1:06:22] sister brother if he's got children he
[1:06:24] takes him away why because the man who's
[1:06:27] training this man wants to train him
[1:06:30] properly
[1:06:31] y'all know Heidi as though the clothes
[1:06:33] of us who've been in the military when
[1:06:35] you get in the military the man says
[1:06:36] well
[1:06:37] I'm your mama I'm your daddy I'm your
[1:06:40] brother I'm your sister
[1:06:42] I'm your all and all right now you're
[1:06:44] gonna listen to what I say I remember
[1:06:47] the time when I was at getting into the
[1:06:51] Air Force there and you know how they
[1:06:53] say well you know how do you want your
[1:06:54] hair cut we had these guys who had all
[1:06:58] day long hair and everything and I
[1:07:00] remember one guy said you know I want it
[1:07:01] like this net day and that man said come
[1:07:03] on get in my chair he got the man in the
[1:07:08] chair and he said he cut it ball he said
[1:07:13] how do you like that right why because
[1:07:16] you're no longer yours once you sign up
[1:07:18] for Uncle Sam
[1:07:20] you become Uncle Sam's property
[1:07:24] hallelujah now listen the Bible said
[1:07:26] you're not your own you're bought with a
[1:07:29] price so when you come to God you're no
[1:07:32] longer yours yourself you are the
[1:07:35] property of the Lord Jesus Christ settle
[1:07:39] the question within you you must come to
[1:07:42] know who you are first and what you are
[1:07:46] here for that's the gospel the gospel is
[1:07:50] ever is able to tell you who you are
[1:07:54] where you come from hallelujah who your
[1:07:59] mom and daddy is people say with oh my
[1:08:05] God if if I had been there if I was Eve
[1:08:08] I wouldn't have done it yes you would if
[1:08:13] I was Adam I wouldn't have done it yes
[1:08:14] you would have
[1:08:16] those people were perfect but God had a
[1:08:21] plan he knew how to place the weak one
[1:08:24] there and he knew how to do what he was
[1:08:26] doing hallelujah God didn't cause him to
[1:08:29] do it but God knew that they would you
[1:08:32] see had not Adam can you imagine this
[1:08:34] and I don't know why I'm going this way
[1:08:36] but i'ma go this way
[1:08:37] can you imagine Adam and Eve they meant
[1:08:39] there in the garden Amen at all Adam
[1:08:41] saying oh I just love you sweetie I'm
[1:08:43] just loving you and you know that's all
[1:08:44] they know is love they've never seen a
[1:08:47] rainy day they've never seen a
[1:08:49] thundercloud
[1:08:51] they've never seen snow or anything new
[1:08:53] earth in itself was perfect why because
[1:08:55] it stood straight
[1:08:56] it was the flood that rocked us this
[1:08:59] this world off its axle that's why we
[1:09:01] experiencing the Four Seasons the way we
[1:09:03] are but before then it was all paradise
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:08] is that all right and can you imagine he
[1:09:11] said oh I love you sweetie you my all
[1:09:13] and all and all in all a mine but it was
[1:09:16] when she fell it's when Eve sin is when
[1:09:20] Adams love was placed in display in such
[1:09:24] a way that even recognize what he meant
[1:09:28] by I love you you don't know whether you
[1:09:32] love somebody until they go wrong until
[1:09:35] they make a mistake that's when you know
[1:09:37] how much you love that person but as
[1:09:40] long as they doing what you want they've
[1:09:42] doing what you want them to do oh you're
[1:09:46] so sweet but when it goes bitter do you
[1:09:53] love them still
[1:09:54] oh come on somebody see that's the real
[1:09:57] deal hey that's the real deal
[1:10:00] am I qualified to say that I'm going on
[1:10:03] 41 years of marriage hallelujah
[1:10:05] it's been sweet it's been better amen
[1:10:08] but it's God's love that has kept us
[1:10:10] together
[1:10:13] Alleluia she training to become what
[1:10:17] what are you training what what this
[1:10:19] whole thing is about and and we talked
[1:10:21] about the statue of a perfect man but
[1:10:23] don't you know that's your whole armor
[1:10:26] that is only way that you're gonna will
[1:10:28] stand the devil and that is a building
[1:10:34] factor hallelujah you should all brother
[1:10:39] Brooks let me say it like this just like
[1:10:41] the property God said listen God ain't
[1:10:43] gonna just pour something in you he
[1:10:46] ain't gonna push you through the hole
[1:10:47] and push you through it come oh I want
[1:10:49] you to be saving I'm just gonna pull you
[1:10:51] this way no sir you got to do something
[1:10:57] every action even science pick that up
[1:10:59] for every action there's an opposite but
[1:11:02] equal that's Newton's law
[1:11:05] opposite for the equal reaction that's
[1:11:07] probably the only thing I remember but
[1:11:09] in all of that it is true and you know
[1:11:14] this is what I'm saying if you take one
[1:11:16] step that gotta take a - it's a training
[1:11:21] to become who you are and what you are
[1:11:23] listen we were not it was not God's
[1:11:26] perfect will for us to remain sinners
[1:11:30] God wanted to show himself Rahila he
[1:11:33] wanted to show himself our Savior he
[1:11:35] wanted to show himself a comforter and
[1:11:37] the only way he could do that just like
[1:11:39] Adam allowed Eve to sin so that sin
[1:11:42] could come in so he could show how much
[1:11:44] he really loved her and that's what God
[1:11:47] has done he is a deliverer he is a
[1:11:50] healer
[1:11:50] he's a comforter he's everything you
[1:11:53] need he wants to be that right the life
[1:12:01] of a warrior is hard hallelujah
[1:12:05] my sons were there in Iraq Co waitin and
[1:12:08] and what's the other Iraq Kuwait and
[1:12:12] there's a storm and they had the dodge
[1:12:18] bullets
[1:12:19] it was rough on them hallelujah and
[1:12:23] guess what proud kept them he said what
[1:12:27] do you mean brother there was a sister
[1:12:28] named Angela senior and y'all know her
[1:12:30] she lives all the way in Virginia and
[1:12:32] while my son was going through something
[1:12:34] God placed my son on her heart on her
[1:12:37] heart and at the same time she was
[1:12:39] praying he almost got blown up that's
[1:12:43] what he told us because we told her told
[1:12:45] him the time she called and the time
[1:12:46] this thing was happening his sergeant
[1:12:49] got hit by the bomb or whatever it was
[1:12:51] blew his brains out and my son had to go
[1:12:53] pick it up y'all hear me it was hard as
[1:13:01] real hard because now he suffer with
[1:13:03] that post-war thing but God is in
[1:13:06] control my son while he was over there
[1:13:10] Amen he got struck with some kind of
[1:13:13] disease that was literally taking his
[1:13:15] sight they sent him a man from that
[1:13:18] Kuwait and back home later into
[1:13:20] Washington DC my wife and I was running
[1:13:22] back and forth amen we got a doctor we
[1:13:25] went to prayer for him and guess what
[1:13:26] his sight is better than mine
[1:13:29] we saw the x-rays of his eyes
[1:13:33] deteriorating and we had a friend doctor
[1:13:35] who said he had never seen such a
[1:13:37] condition like that in his life but when
[1:13:40] God finished whew see God is an unseen
[1:13:43] warrior he is the greatest of all
[1:13:46] warriors the Bible call him the captain
[1:13:49] of the Lord's host and what are we being
[1:13:53] trained to do trust God with all of our
[1:13:57] hearts and lean not to our own
[1:14:00] understanding you see what I'm saying
[1:14:02] that's the first as it the first thing
[1:14:04] God wants you to do is trust him when
[1:14:08] all of the doctors that everything says
[1:14:09] there's no hope it can't be done God
[1:14:11] says all things are possible to them
[1:14:14] that believe amen
[1:14:16] see the lack of faith you can't you
[1:14:19] can't like faith one of the things they
[1:14:21] men when you being trained you're being
[1:14:24] trained that you are invisible
[1:14:25] invincible right that nothing can harm
[1:14:28] you mentally or physically and for every
[1:14:32] one of them that that that that don't
[1:14:35] come to that level of being fearless
[1:14:37] they become a threat to the whole group
[1:14:41] hmm it may because they can't afford to
[1:14:45] have somebody who's gonna fade on them
[1:14:47] in a time when they need it the most
[1:14:49] hallelujah and that's how God is God
[1:14:53] won't strong warrior God won't strong
[1:14:55] Christians God won't people who know who
[1:14:57] is not going to faint when something
[1:14:59] goes wrong to know that God is working
[1:15:02] everything you understand me the Bible
[1:15:05] even tells us without faith it's
[1:15:07] impossible to please God you've got to
[1:15:10] have it and faith is not something it's
[1:15:13] not like this book
[1:15:14] oh I'm gonna wanna wave my faith
[1:15:17] this ain't no faith this is a book faith
[1:15:21] is not a thing faith is a person huh oh
[1:15:25] yeah by faith God created the heavens in
[1:15:28] the earth is that right and the Bible
[1:15:30] tells that that Jesus Christ created
[1:15:32] everything so Jesus Christ must be say
[1:15:35] and the Bible said the just shall live
[1:15:37] by what his faith that's when you get
[1:15:41] the Holy Ghost you don't have your faith
[1:15:42] in it's his faith we make our down we
[1:15:45] might get weak but when you got God in
[1:15:47] you he's the standard hallelujah whoo is
[1:15:52] that right so while you in bootcamp

[1:16:09] in trouble it's somebody else go bad you
[1:16:12] go bad - they learned that all the group
[1:16:15] must suffer together right so and you
[1:16:18] look at the stingy's who are all brother
[1:16:20] Brooks is that not like God the Bible
[1:16:23] tells us when one of us hurt all should
[1:16:25] hurt when all of us having meat all
[1:16:28] should have a need hallelujah
[1:16:31] the New Testament church from Peter name
[1:16:33] was thrown in jail what happened they
[1:16:34] were warriors hallelujah
[1:16:36] they didn't fight with the natural sword
[1:16:38] but they had a spiritual sword which was
[1:16:40] a Word of God and they all went into
[1:16:43] prayer guess what happened God shook the
[1:16:48] door hallelujah he set the captive free
[1:16:53] yeah he's the same yesterday today and
[1:16:56] forever see so we look at this thing in
[1:16:59] Luke says 14 25 to 33 y'all don't mind
[1:17:01] me reading I'm hurry up though and there
[1:17:04] went great multitudes with him and he
[1:17:05] turned and said unto them if a man come
[1:17:08] to me and hate not his father and mother
[1:17:11] and wife and children and brethren and
[1:17:15] sisters yay and his own life also he
[1:17:19] cannot be my disciples you know that
[1:17:22] word hate him like what is he saying
[1:17:23] Lord I don't understand that I could
[1:17:25] never hate my loved ones but what is he
[1:17:27] saying is that
[1:17:28] you are going to say nothing will
[1:17:30] separate me from your love if my family
[1:17:35] want to persecute me let them persecute
[1:17:37] me hallelujah but I am going to love God
[1:17:41] see when you follow Jesus you have
[1:17:44] tunnel vision a real warrior has tunnel
[1:17:48] vision hmm you say all Brotherhood's I
[1:17:51] don't know about that
[1:17:52] what about David soldiers David said I
[1:17:54] thirst I want some water

[1:17:58] miles of Philistines just to get him a
[1:18:01] drink of water those are not just
[1:18:03] stories these things like its historical
[1:18:06] facts somebody said well I don't believe
[1:18:11] it
[1:18:12] well you know this was the thing I it's
[1:18:19] a little sweet thing Kyle gave me some I
[1:18:21] said well I don't believe there's a god
[1:18:23] and that's and then I said well I don't
[1:18:24] believe you exist but brother I can't
[1:18:29] feel me touch no if God don't exist you
[1:18:32] don't either
[1:18:36] hmm help us Jesus right let me go home
[1:18:42] with the scriptures here and whosoever
[1:18:43] they're not bears cross and come after
[1:18:45] me cannot be my disciples for which of
[1:18:47] you intend to build a tower see when you
[1:18:50] become a Christian you're supposed to
[1:18:51] think about what you're doing it's not
[1:18:53] something that you just join right it's
[1:18:56] giving your life to christ to say Lord
[1:18:58] you do with my life as you choose this
[1:19:04] but if you know him just like I know a
[1:19:07] new you you you find out you're making
[1:19:10] the right choice for which of you were
[1:19:14] intended to build a tower sit it not
[1:19:17] down first and count the cost whether he
[1:19:20] has sufficient to finish it now my
[1:19:24] brother Jarrett knows all about that
[1:19:26] because he had to build little things
[1:19:28] and construct things and stuff and you
[1:19:31] know you came promised a man I'm gonna
[1:19:32] do this and you ain't got enough fund to
[1:19:33] make it you have the funds you have to
[1:19:36] have the funds and you have the supplies
[1:19:38] to finish it right and this is what God
[1:19:41] says
[1:19:42] if you go to be a Christian finish it
[1:19:44] don't start out and quit finish it don't
[1:19:49] be discouraged and quit finish it be a
[1:19:52] good warrior fight like a good soldier
[1:19:57] hallelujah Oh before I allow my God to
[1:20:02] be ashamed I'd rather go to the chopping
[1:20:04] block for the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:07] hallelujah is that right
[1:20:11] some of y'all read the foxes Book of
[1:20:12] Martyrs amen when they were killing
[1:20:14] people and everything else a man in this
[1:20:17] one man he they were going to chop his
[1:20:19] head off or something like that I can't
[1:20:20] remember exactly and all of a sudden he
[1:20:22] got afraid and he recanted and there was
[1:20:26] a young girl in the in the in the in the
[1:20:29] in the audience and she stepped forward
[1:20:31] and she said you fool that you would
[1:20:34] give your life for a few moments of
[1:20:37] pleasure you would give eternal life up
[1:20:40] for a few moments of pleasure think
[1:20:44] about it this is just a few movements
[1:20:47] we're talking about eternal life
[1:20:49] something that we can't even grasp with
[1:20:51] our minds an eternal life where you'd
[1:20:54] never grow old you see young people here
[1:21:06] they they they young Nate they almost
[1:21:08] make perfect you know look but I don't
[1:21:12] pass that day so heaven is going to be a
[1:21:16] great thing for me without looking see
[1:21:18] myself back to a young man hallelujah
[1:21:22] the more the older you get the more
[1:21:24] glorious it becomes but nevertheless
[1:21:28] amen and that's the truth how many times
[1:21:31] and then people a man recanted and I'm
[1:21:33] gonna tell you something during that Ox
[1:21:35] age during that time Amen where those
[1:21:37] people had to suffer they suffer not
[1:21:40] Elyria you know according to those
[1:21:42] medieval medieval things that they used
[1:21:45] to do they used to put people in
[1:21:47] rotisserie I mean metal things and and
[1:21:50] cook them slowly trying to get them to
[1:21:52] say I denounced Jesus Christ you think
[1:21:56] all of that was in vain because of that
[1:21:58] we're here today and we know it's a
[1:22:03] shame because we call ourselves the same
[1:22:05] church and we can team Holly take a
[1:22:08] little teasing from the devil may God
[1:22:11] help us will help me Jesus it's just
[1:22:15] okay
[1:22:16] amen for which of you intending to build
[1:22:18] a tower said not first and counted the
[1:22:21] cost whether whether he has sufficient
[1:22:23] to finish it let's happily happy he had
[1:22:26] laid the foundation and is not able to
[1:22:29] finish it and all that behold it began
[1:22:32] to mock him how many times you going
[1:22:34] across the street or down the road you
[1:22:36] see a house that once looked like it was
[1:22:38] going to be a beautiful situation amen
[1:22:40] and then now you see grass all grown up
[1:22:43] it ain't it hadn't even been finished
[1:22:44] and you said what happened but the
[1:22:46] person went bankrupt right you don't
[1:22:49] want to go bankrupt you got to keep
[1:22:51] enough God in you to make the journey
[1:22:54] hallelujah
[1:22:55] you got to be filled to make the journey
[1:22:57] you can't come to God with a half cup
[1:22:59] this journey calls for a full tank not a
[1:23:02] half a tank
[1:23:04] hallelujah huh oh my give me like David
[1:23:08] said oh I owe you not only left my cup
[1:23:11] run or whether lost my salsa - is this
[1:23:15] okay I'm trying to get through what King
[1:23:18] going to make war against another king

[1:23:23] whether he he is able with ten thousand
[1:23:27] to meet him that cometh against him with
[1:23:29] twenty thousand or else while the other
[1:23:32] is yet a great off he said that them am
[1:23:35] best ambassador and desired conditions
[1:23:38] of peace so likewise whosoever he be of
[1:23:42] you that forsaken not all that he had he
[1:23:46] cannot be my disciple see this is you
[1:23:49] know God I'm willing to give up ninety
[1:23:51] nine percent no no no no you gotta give
[1:23:53] a hundred hallelujah he told that rich

[1:23:58] ruler he said I say to you he said
[1:24:00] listen sell all that you have incoming
[1:24:02] and come follow me huh if that ruler
[1:24:06] would have known that that was the king
[1:24:09] of gold
[1:24:09] that was the owner of heaven and earth
[1:24:12] he dropped his bags hallelujah let me
[1:24:16] tell you something God will never take
[1:24:18] something from you and not give you more
[1:24:21] hallelujah God is a man that if you put
[1:24:24] ten dollars in the bank he'll give you
[1:24:26] 20 back he gives you high interests not

[1:25:59] plan applicable to you it meant when the
[1:26:01] Holy Ghost comes up to the Holy Ghost
[1:26:04] time you just a potential Christian but
[1:26:07] when God comes down and he feels you

[1:34:32] statement for every battle of the
[1:34:34] warrior is with confused noise and
[1:34:37] garments rolled in blood but this small
[1:34:41] this shalt be with burning and fuel of
[1:34:44] fire mmm in other words this word that
[1:34:48] I'm talking about it's gonna come with
[1:34:50] burning and fuel a fire but look up what
[1:34:53] Allah says for unto us a child is born

[1:35:05] called wonderful counselor
[1:35:07] the mighty God the everlasting father
[1:35:08] the Prince of Peace that's what the
[1:35:10] Bible says and then we didn't understand
[1:35:13] what it was but God is conquering
[1:35:15] Satan's Kingdom by the fuel of fire but
[1:35:18] fire fire of the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:35:21] John said concept I am not worthy to

[1:35:27] that comes after me he shall baptize you
[1:35:30] with the Holy Ghost and we were fire

[1:36:16] the end of the day you see peace when
[1:36:19] Satan is cast into the lake of fire huh
[1:36:23] when all of his Devils are is actually
[1:36:26] burned why because God don't have any
[1:36:29] formal anymore hallelujah if that ain't
[1:36:32] that what you do it trash hallelujah and
[1:36:37] just think about it man God is bringing

[1:38:09] think see you don't know what a preacher
[1:38:10] is until you a preacher you know the
[1:38:12] probably God said every prophet lose by
[1:38:15] inspiration and I am a prophet manya
[1:38:18] minor a preacher is a minor prophet and
[1:38:22] I moved by inspiration when you know God
[1:38:26] you know God and so you said well
[1:38:33] brothers what do you say see y'all
[1:38:34] understand when I'm up here as I asked
[1:38:36] the Lord I said lord help me cuz their
[1:38:38] thoughts I hear you and I know exactly
[1:38:41] where they come from and you know so I
[1:38:45] have to be careful that I don't get in
[1:38:48] flesh because I know it's a spirit
[1:38:53] that's trying to counteract what God is
[1:38:55] trying to do and say you love the Lord
[1:39:07] I'm just
[1:39:08] stop there but I will say you know God
[1:39:13] tries the heart it doesn't matter what
[1:39:18] you say up here is what's going on in
[1:39:19] your inside what's on the inside if
[1:39:22] darkness is there you need to be
[1:39:24] delivered I've been preaching this
[1:39:29] message ever since I was 1986 1986 I've
[1:39:35] been saved every since I was 20 years
[1:39:39] old I got married I think around 21
[1:39:47] raised I don't know how many children
[1:39:49] trying to raise them in the right way
[1:39:51] I've seen two people did raised from the
[1:39:54] dead where people say it don't happen
[1:39:56] anymore I'm a witness Jesus Christ is to
[1:40:00] say I've seen cancer delivered almost
[1:40:04] everybody in this in this church has a
[1:40:06] testimony of some kind of cancer or some
[1:40:09] amount of diabetes or some kind of
[1:40:10] something going on who did that one
[1:40:16] brother Brooks see brother Branham said
[1:40:18] if you'd preach it
[1:40:19] God will vindicate if it's the true Word
[1:40:24] of God God will vindicate I've seen God
[1:40:29] then decayed the Word of God in this
[1:40:33] place and he's not through yet
[1:40:36] the devil is mad cuz we getting ready to
[1:40:39] have a revival in this place you said
[1:40:42] what do you mean brothers you see in
[1:40:44] God's own timing but I see it coming I
[1:40:47] see what God is doing I see just a
[1:40:49] little glimpse of light coming through
[1:40:52] I'm not telling my so some major thing
[1:40:54] that's gonna sweep the world that's over
[1:40:57] but God promised that any man woman who
[1:41:00] wants revival can have and as David and
[1:41:07] that's Napoleon y'all know me I try to
[1:41:10] cut every devil out of this place every
[1:41:13] spirit y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:41:14] every spirit not people I'm my flesh I
[1:41:16] don't fight flesh and blood it's
[1:41:18] spiritual things but our whole point is
[1:41:21] its Napoleon says if
[1:41:22] you're not with me you've got to go
[1:41:25] that's the Holy Spirit he's not me I'm
[1:41:29] not talking about if you ain't with me
[1:41:30] I'm nobody but I'm trying to tell the
[1:41:33] people of God you can't give up on your
[1:41:35] day you can't look back and see what God
[1:41:38] did yesterday and you need him today you
[1:41:41] need God today I need God today and he's
[1:41:45] the god of yesterday today and forever
[1:41:49] this ain't no one-man show it ain't all

[1:42:03] spirits you understand me and so we are
[1:42:09] the place at a read to you already I'd
[1:42:14] rather have Jesus you can't produce each
[1:42:23] Eagles in a dead atmosphere you can no

[1:42:42] you can't allow starchiness and religion
[1:42:45] to hold you in your seat that's of the
[1:42:48] devil that's not of God and you and I
[1:42:53] must understand as it is in heaven so
[1:42:56] shall it be earth whatever they doing up
[1:42:58] dead that's just what I want to do if
[1:43:00] they dance and if they're shouting that
[1:43:02] praising God I want to do the same thing
[1:43:04] here because I'm there and so are you is
[1:43:09] that right don't get scared

[1:43:33] y'all making too much noise I wish I had
[1:43:36] that complaint hallelujah like I said I
[1:43:43] used to be part of the Catholic Church
[1:43:45] I've never didn't join it but I go to

[1:44:31] to something I'm like you don't
[1:44:33] understand

[1:44:39] one way down I got no power
[1:44:42] y'all know Peter and James and all him
[1:44:45] did y'all hear what happened to me on

[1:44:54] alive T y'all got to read some history
[1:44:59] some some some good background on what
[1:45:01] happened in the beginning those people
[1:45:03] don't staunch Jews all of a sudden got
[1:45:05] quickened by the Holy Ghost and they ran
[1:45:07] down the street screaming he's alive how
[1:45:10] do you think three thousand came
[1:45:12] together and they didn't have one of
[1:45:18] these microphones y'all better move why
[1:45:26] you know after a while you get like me
[1:45:29] you gotta move carefully you love the
[1:45:35] Lord I love the people of God there's
[1:45:40] not a soul I hate or dislike because my
[1:45:46] enemy is not people it's spirits and you
[1:45:51] know we've got spirits even around this
[1:45:53] message that I have to fight against
[1:45:56] hello and because it's around this
[1:46:00] message don't mean it's right
[1:46:03] we worship one Lord one Savior and
[1:46:07] that's Jesus Christ himself no other God
[1:46:13] before me not me not my wife not my
[1:46:18] children ain't nobody comes before the
[1:46:20] Lord Jesus Christ and if you can't see
[1:46:23] that you are possessed and need
[1:46:26] deliverance am I right or wrong the
[1:46:37] Bible said that there was one that stood
[1:46:39] on the right hand of God I'm happy in
[1:46:45] Jesus see when you get the real Holy
[1:46:48] Ghost it would testify who as we said
[1:46:54] the confident the father was sent in my
[1:46:57] name and he would testify who me he said
[1:47:01] not me Jesus crying I don't know what TD
[1:47:06] jakes and all the rest on saying there's
[1:47:08] only one one way to get to heaven
[1:47:11] there was only one door to get in no
[1:47:13] Assad hallelujah and Jesus was that door
[1:47:17] and he told the Pharisees of this day he
[1:47:19] said except a man believe that I am he I
[1:47:21] don't care how many degrees he's got
[1:47:23] he's lost
[1:47:24] that's your Bible and Jesus Christ is
[1:47:27] not long no oh come on something I got a
[1:47:29] quote where he's the Prophet God said
[1:47:31] Amen the prophets they move by
[1:47:33] inspiration not not intellectual
[1:47:37] knowledge knowledge is not what moves
[1:47:39] people
[1:47:40] it ain't your knowledge the devil know
[1:47:42] more about it than you right but when
[1:47:45] you are inspired yo your movement I'm
[1:47:49] almost done your movement may look
[1:47:51] contrary to everybody else but you right
[1:47:56] right oh yeah you don't you said all
[1:47:59] Brotherhood's what he said look at Noah
[1:48:00] he didn't make sense but he was right
[1:48:03] look at Moses they say wait a minute
[1:48:06] we've got our organization our
[1:48:07] denomination I want you understand we
[1:48:09] had we had Abraham as I father and no
[1:48:14] Moses wouldn't say yeah that's true but
[1:48:16] I heard from God he told me if you don't
[1:48:19] put the blood on the doorpost in the
[1:48:22] little your firstborn going down I don't
[1:48:25] care oh but wait a minute Moses
[1:48:27] we're circumcised we've been circumcised
[1:48:29] on the eighth day we're Jews mostly I
[1:48:33] don't care if you argues you could have
[1:48:36] been thoroughbred all the way through
[1:48:38] but I heard from God and the death
[1:48:41] angels coming and if you don't put blood
[1:48:43] on the doorpost and a little you gonna
[1:48:45] die everybody that did not obey Moses
[1:48:50] from the Egyptians to the Israelites
[1:48:53] they died if they were any Israelites I
[1:48:56] believe they heard Moses but the point
[1:48:59] is I'm saying that's what inspiration
[1:49:01] will bring things that seem so contrary
[1:49:07] you know God I know I took a lot of your
[1:49:11] time left and we just got one service
[1:49:14] today all right
[1:49:16] so I took my liberty this is just the
[1:49:22] beginning of what I'm trying to teach by
[1:49:25] God's grace I'll try to slow down and
[1:49:27] give more more scriptures and things I
[1:49:30] want you to understand by God's grace
[1:49:34] I've been kissed by God he said Wow
[1:49:38] before I knew him and the Lord brought
[1:49:41] that revelation now I don't you don't
[1:49:43] have to believe me go all out mystery
[1:49:45] say you know that preaching crazy but I
[1:49:49] was in junior high school and I'm gonna
[1:49:50] tell you how it happened I don't throw
[1:49:52] this thing and I'm letting you go
[1:49:56] first time I ever had a dream about
[1:49:58] Jesus Christ and I want you to know
[1:50:01] before there was times in my life I
[1:50:03] never thought about God of Jesus at all
[1:50:06] but I had a dream and in this dream I
[1:50:10] wasn't even a preacher I wasn't even a
[1:50:12] Christian as far as I was kind of nicer
[1:50:13] now when I was in the Baptist Church I
[1:50:15] gave my heart to the Lord at 12 years
[1:50:16] old and I knew something change but I
[1:50:18] didn't have a word to keep me but when I
[1:50:22] was in the in the sixth grade seventh
[1:50:23] seventh grade it was I had a dream and
[1:50:27] in this dream
[1:50:29] Jesus stood there and I was the gates
[1:50:31] were open and I'm telling you it's the
[1:50:33] most prettiest that's all the gold and
[1:50:36] the blues and what we call colors this
[1:50:38] is faded and it you'd be surprised
[1:50:41] you're gonna be surprised if this dream
[1:50:44] be true you will be surprised on what
[1:50:46] real colors look like this is like the
[1:50:48] faded part of all things it was so
[1:50:51] beautiful and everybody was showering
[1:50:54] and jumping in praising God I had no
[1:50:56] idea I was going to do the traveling I
[1:50:58] traveled all over the world and I'm
[1:51:00] telling you in this group of people was
[1:51:02] almost every nationality coming through
[1:51:04] that gate and I stood there and Jesus
[1:51:07] stood there and the whole time he'd
[1:51:09] never watched those people he watched me
[1:51:12] and as he watched me I was afraid
[1:51:16] terrified but I was already in the gate
[1:51:18] because once I got in something pulled
[1:51:20] me to the side and I stood there I'm not
[1:51:25] trying to be nothing people I'm just
[1:51:26] saying
[1:51:27] personally I I am and I'm not trying to
[1:51:30] be some great leaders those days are
[1:51:32] over
[1:51:32] this is a mini moment body of Christ
[1:51:35] there are no great ones among us I'm
[1:51:39] your pastor only by position I'm just
[1:51:41] your brother in Christ and as I walked
[1:51:47] as I stood there they listened I didn't
[1:51:49] know what a mean long that's why I play
[1:51:52] this because there's a I was playing the
[1:51:56] tambourine coming in the gate the only
[1:52:00] difference is I had tassels had
[1:52:02] different colored tassels on it and that
[1:52:04] those tassels hung like that and I was
[1:52:06] playing it I remem
[1:52:08] that and I didn't know I was at the
[1:52:10] Harmon it doesn't they said when I
[1:52:11] played this light striking and gives a
[1:52:13] rainbow color don't know but the whole
[1:52:16] point is that's why I play this I've had
[1:52:19] men all over the message trying to take
[1:52:21] me my tambourine God gave me this and if
[1:52:26] it was with me in heaven it's gonna be
[1:52:28] there with me in heaven that's all I can
[1:52:30] tell you you might not like the way I
[1:52:32] play it but he does and and and I was
[1:52:36] terrified then all of a sudden I saw the
[1:52:39] gate closed that's why I know I'm one of
[1:52:42] them
[1:52:43] I saw the gate closed I saw when the
[1:52:48] last came in I saw that and I was
[1:52:52] terrified this is a dream people but I
[1:52:54] believe the dream I'm telling you as a
[1:52:55] dream I'm not saying this is the stay at
[1:52:57] the Lord I'm just telling you what I
[1:52:59] believe
[1:52:59] okay so as I stood there I was really
[1:53:02] scared and not realizing because I
[1:53:04] didn't know nothing about holiness or
[1:53:06] anything about this nothing like what
[1:53:10] we're doing but anyway the next thing I
[1:53:13] know after everybody had passed I went
[1:53:16] to do this because I was terrified on my
[1:53:18] left foot to this day I know what that
[1:53:20] means yeah something I don't know but
[1:53:22] anyway the next thing I know I was right
[1:53:25] in front of him
[1:53:27] that's how I know the Hoffman here was
[1:53:29] the closest thing to him his looks and
[1:53:33] he lifted me like this
[1:53:36] and he kissed me on my lips and I woke
[1:53:39] up screaming and Holle
[1:53:41] with that anointing y'all know what I'm
[1:53:43] saying with that anointing all over me I
[1:53:45] jumped out of my bed I ran into my
[1:53:48] mother's room bust in there scared half
[1:53:50] to death almost screaming in Harlan and
[1:53:54] I said mama I just had a dream about
[1:53:57] Jesus and I began to tell her and she
[1:54:00] said praise the Lord God don't call my
[1:54:04] son to preach that was the worst thing
[1:54:08] she could have said to me I walked out
[1:54:11] our room and I said I ain't going back
[1:54:12] to church ever again cuz I ain't gonna
[1:54:15] be nobody's preacher
[1:54:20] well my mama died and that was to think
[1:54:22] that was the first time I went back to
[1:54:24] church
[1:54:25] well something no I gotta correct that
[1:54:28] it wasn't but it was the first time I
[1:54:31] went back to church which when it meant
[1:54:33] something got quickened something to me
[1:54:36] there it was only until I came to where
[1:54:42] I am because I got tired of all of the
[1:54:45] denominations and organizations now I
[1:54:48] can remember crying out to the Lord
[1:54:49] where are you because after a while you
[1:54:53] learn everything they learn and then you
[1:54:54] start drying up say where are you and he
[1:54:58] says I'm in my by my mama I'm here I
[1:55:01] didn't know nothing about the message at
[1:55:03] that time but when I I was in my mind
[1:55:06] was settled to leave out from where I
[1:55:08] work that's when it came to me and I say
[1:55:12] this people of God by God's grace I know
[1:55:16] that what I it's truth and I say that
[1:55:19] not in Pride but I say that because I'm
[1:55:22] resounding that which has already been
[1:55:24] sounded when God gave us Malachi 4
[1:55:27] that's all I have
[1:55:29] he left a word I revelation not by
[1:55:33] letter because I'm not a parakeet and I
[1:55:36] think a lot of times people want me to
[1:55:37] be parakeet but I'm not going to be that
[1:55:39] I'm not quoting anything that I don't
[1:55:42] have a revelation of it keeps me safe
[1:55:47] you love the Lord so man does not live
[1:55:52] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:55:56] proceeds out of the mouth of God man
[1:56:00] does not live by your tradition
[1:56:03] yo isms and your schisms man lives by
[1:56:07] every word that proceedeth amount of God
[1:56:09] and I'm gonna tell you something once

[1:56:13] seal you nothing can stop you from
[1:56:16] making heaven well I want to make
