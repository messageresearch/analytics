TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if he was passing this way would you reach out and tou you if he was passing this way would you grab the Hem of His Garment if he was passing by your way you remember see everybody didn't know who he was when he came into the city but it was only the the Bible says the crowd was moved but only a few group could say hosan hosan and there was still some there watching and they were just as they said in the Old Testament looking to God to gaze but there was some people that knew that when Jesus passes by your way that if you the individual just Reach Out And Touch him then what he said every promise in the book is yours this morning now remember you see a promise means nothing until you know that it's yours when something is yours it means symbolize it it means you associated with it it means that you're identified with it so this morning be identified with the promise this morning the promise of everything that God said you see we come to church we must know that it's a supernatural thing just to get out of your bed it's a supernatural thing when you get out of your bed to then just be able to go and take a shower it's a supernatural thing to then go and just grab your toothbrush and a supernatural thing after you brush your teeth to go and have clothes to put on your back you say now as you get dressed now it's supernatural that God even put gas in the car and let it crank for you to get here this morning because I want you to see this this morning there are some that wish brother Brooks they're in the hospital that have no arms and can't clap they have no arms and can't clap there are some even soldiers that gave their life for this country that now even the the wife is coming home with maybe one leg and she can't jump out of the bed and maybe go fix the kids breakfast but she may not now have a revelation this morning that if Jesus passed by her way if Jesus passed by away then something would move a person Beyond excuses Beyond the rain it said beyond the heartache Beyond Monday morning but something would reach and grab that mother and say I must go to the house of God you see going to the house of God is a revelation my brother and you have to know that you're blessed cuz blessed is he that see that reth and keepeth the saying that in his book because God has dropped down and quickened something in your heart that when you come to the house of God that even if I was just a doorkeeper I'm blessed just to come and you see we are blessed people this morning there is no big eyes and little you it's only one in Jesus Christ it's Jesus is passing this way he's passing this way he says right now oh you see it's you see you see remember I didn't promise but and I could say anything and break my promise any preacher any man any boy or girl but Jesus can never break his word and if you're believing now in him this morning he said well two or more come gathered together in his name he said that there he be in the midst but brother Randy you didn't see him come through the wall this morning he could have maybe passed right by you and he could just look to see what brother Randy's doing on the keyboard and he said maybe just that empty seat sitting next to you just that empty seat sitting next to you that God said I you know what I need maybe a little bit more room this morning Hallelujah so you see you just give him a little room why don't you let him talk to you this morning oh lord lord I I I don't know exactly where to get started but I can tell you I said that it's something to see people just come and you see there's many other beautiful churches there's many other big buildings there's many other pools maybe family maybe cousin or boss or coworker but why would God lead you here this morning why would because you see to lead means you also must follow and to follow means you must respond so it's a pull not just you but it's something pulling you and that's you see that's what I hope we see this morning it's something that's pulling us here that's keeping us day after day brick after brick is him that is now keeping us not us keeping him is oh Lord not to keep you standing this morning and getting to the word as some sometime you know you have so much to read but uh let me just read a couple of scriptures I was trying to read a a lot to you this morning but just turn with me to um This Job 31 I'm going try to just read a couple scriptures and let you have your seat amen and thank you for standing amen you know it's something that you know before I kick off at a ball game everybody stands out and I said wow why is that because the pig skin going but brother Joe Here we are now House of God this morning that's a that's that's an honor to his word Job 31 I got verse 9 it says if my heart have been deceived by a woman or if I have laid weight at my neighbor's door then let my wife grind into another and let others bow down upon her for this is a heinous crime yay it is Iniquity to be punished by the judges let's look at this other scripture here let's look at uh uh let's look at um Deuteronomy 11:16 just to make it sure here 11:16 then it be Hebrews 2 that's look at this uh it says here take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain that the land yield not her fruit lest ye shall perish L you perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you in Hebrews 2:1 amen it says uh therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by Angels were steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed To Us by them that heard him amen let us pray oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just come before your throne this morning and we know Lord God that anyone could turn the pages of of this book lord God but heavenly father one thing we know Lord God that it takes you to drop down and reveal it to our hearts Lord and Heavenly Father we ask you Lord this portion of service if you'll come Lord May any Lord demonic Spirit try to come against the mind and heart of your people Lord God and we place on our feet Lord that your holy spirit will have free reign this morning and that Lord you would come Lord and shower your blessings of your word to our heart Lord God and Father Lord may you speak heavenly father to your people may you move me out the way Lord God For Your Glory we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we just say amen amen you just have your seats amen thought I had amen one water take a sip I don't know what I with see oh thank you um hey man I want to just read something to you really quickly but I tell you that felt good uh me read something to you now but now cancer in the body or cancer in the soul now listen to this it says cancer in the body of the soul the demon can come in either place when a person now is attacked by cancer or is said a person is attacked by any Spirit contrary to God it can attack your body and it can attack your soul and it says that now there's many times many people with good thoughts and good people who try many times to rest upon some little theology they have or something they have been taught since they were a child and still find that down in their being down in their soul they still have something that's not right and many are here this morning no doubt wherever you find Christians gathered together you find people who have those Spirits in them and it's undesirable they don't want them and they say if you've ever heard this before Oh if I could only quit lying if I could only quit lusting if I could only quit this or that now that is devils and now they come in the form of religion many times now I want you to see this with me just turn with me to Matthew 24 it says see in the day and hour that we're in brothers and sisters it's like there's many spirits on the land and there's many different voices in the land and you see when you listen to the wrong voice it'll pull you down the wrong track it'll take you to the wrong place it'll have you with the wrong people it'll have you doing things that you don't want to do saying things you don't want to say it says be because now let's not be ignorant here of Satan's devices we're not Waring against flesh and blood but we're Waring against Spirits so now Spirits is something that you may not see with your natural eye a spirit is something that now it says that there are spirits in the room today and it says in every service we have three kind of Believers a Believer unbeliever and a make believer at every service so that means that some really want to hear the word of God an unbeliever might get up halfway through and say I don't care what Brother Kyle say I'm still going to heaven or I don't care because I want to go to hell it just walk out but then that make believer was sit there just long enough and just kind of watch and see what's going on and and maybe wait to hear just the wrong thing or the or think they think is wrong or think they know that is wrong or want it to be wrong and then now they start to Feast on that thing instead of the unadulterated word of God so there's no way that you can understand the mind of God without what his holy spirit so you see he tells us in the last day even in John he says but Beloved the children of God he said trust not every Spirit but he says try the spirit he said whether it be what of God or not so if God gives us the ability to try spirit that means that now we must have something in us to be be able to discern now we say why is this important because many of us know that there's still lying going on in our home many of us know that now there still when we go to our jobs there's still now Strife on our jobs with those that one wants to get ahead of another and they'll lie they'll s they'll they'll cheat they'll steal and do anything to try to get ahead amen so you see here you're faced with it every day whether you're a Believer or not you're dealing with now contrary Spirits so he says this now that demon when it comes is coming to either now affect also your body your mind but it really wants to torment your soul am and it wants to now pull you so far away from God that then now you start to have mind bounds you could come to church and you wonder am I really hearing the truth is this what God wants me to do is this what is this God speaking to me justes God if this is God then Lord then just show me your will but if it's not Lord I don't want nothing of it so it has to be something to get you off the cliff and then they say into the game you have to at some point make a decision and you have to say Lord please lead me and guide me and until you do that then now you're just roping do yes sir so you look at this when Jesus now when he saw Simon he knew Peter Peter walked on water he was there with him from the beginning he called him when he was a fisherman he said I make you fishal men he saw the healing of jarry's daughter he saw all the Miracles the signs the wers he saw everything but yet until he received the Holy Spirit he told him one day it was at Luke 23 he said now after they' been talking and talking he said Simon Simon he gave him a warning he said the Satan wants to sift you like we am and I want you to see here he says now he goes about as a roaring lion seeking to steal kill and destroy and he warned him and he told him he said it's only until you get converted that then at that point that you can go and strengthen your brother so you can't just go out of here with no strength with no virtue with no Holy Spirit and go strengthen anybody else it says you might find yourself now confused you might find yourself bewildered you might find yourself now wondering well who is God there's many people that go to school and they leave Seminary school as atheist because now you see they were saying that there was a study I was seeing recently they said people between the 18 ages between 18 and 29 it says that they're now they don't have faith that all the word of God is true anymore and you ask how many of the younger generation they really now they even hear their parents talking about the Lord many come from different broken homes they come from different situations they're hearing things on television they're listening to all these different voices and they don't know that now Satan is going about to to kill their sto to now just choke the very life out of them so what does he say here he tells it when he says he goes about the steal kill and destroy he's trying to tell them what he's saying be careful it says don't be cheated and that's what we just want to talk about this morning don't be cheated amen you see to be cheated you see another word for cheated means deceived but if you You' ever been cheated before maybe playing Monopoly anybody play Monopoly here and playing Monopoly you know how it is maybe you get up and you go to the bathroom and you got all the houses you got Parkplace and boy while you come back and then your brother he got hotels now we ain't roll no dice you know nobody went around jail collected $200 but now you see that there's been a displacement of what he had so when you left and you came back from the bathroom now it seemed like your brother's wealthy now yeah and you wonder what happened but what really happened is somebody cheated you and you see it doesn't feel good to be cheated when you cheated you've been slighted you've been begal you've been somebody has now found an angle on you and they're trying to pull something over your eyes so he tells him he says now in the last day be careful because it's not just that he's going to deceive you but he's also going to cheat you and I want you to see here now that is what you see in the last day that now as Satan is rising up he's trying to now steal everything that the people had when they beli the word of God they trusted in God all the promises that they believed in now he's trying to take their faith and believe that maybe Jesus ain't coming back maybe that you know he's having a good time somewhere or maybe that Jesus he just he has something else maybe we didn't read the scripture right and now should you should just believe in what the church say now you should just take what the church say and I want you oh Lord look at this in Matthew 24 just want to read a couple scriptures to you first look at this please with me in Matthew uh let's look at um well I'll just go ahead and read Matthew 24 and verse let's just drop down make it short uh and 22 now this is Jesus speaking and he tells us now he says except those days be short now he's talking about the end time and he says unless the end days be shortened it's like a guy you go to prison the guys everybody in prison wants a short bid because when you've done wrong then now nobody wants to sit there for 30 20 30 20 30 years but they want the sers to be shortened now Jesus comes and he tells us he says I'm going to shorten the time in the end time and listen what he says because if he didn't shorten the time he said that not one of us would make it and this is what he said as much as you love God this morning and your neighbor says they love the Lord I want you to see he said unless he shorten the time that none of us would make it so that means that now it's going to be some very very trying times that would come and they would try people that have confessed with their mouth and said they believe in their heart that they love the Lord but now God is going to bring pressure and he said it's got to be so just so he can bring forth Jews just so he can bring forth Jews so what we're speaking of now today is in this Christian Journey there has to be pressure yes and don't let anybody think and tell you that you're just going to catw walk out of here that's not where we're at this morning you see the pressure comes that now it will be close enough for each and every one of us that we could see that we can only make it out of here by the grace of God Amen not only by his grace so here he comes and he says but for the elect sake though those days shall be short so you see those that may not know that they're elect if you don't know that you elect then now you might doubt along this journey let me say it very plainly along this journey you may say well I'm going to this is a tight week this is a off week let me go ahead and hold on to that $100 tith cuz you know I need gasma and how I'm going to get to church if I don't hold on to this $100 now you go e Burger King you go to McDonald's he said you go out to eat all week at work lunch every day never take a sandwich but that $100 oh Lord that $100 now it creates pressure in the home yeah and so now you see here what does it mean do you really have faith to believe that God promised yeah that he's shortening the time for your sake or do you want that cheeseburger with bacon you see I want think about that this morning because you see now these are the pressures and you see it's the first thing when you receive the wrong thought it'll turn into a lie that you'll believe and when you believe that lie long enough then now it becomes who you are you speak that lie you talk about that lie and you identified as a liar and you don't even know it you say I'm the most truthful man on the Earth but before God he said you're a thief and a robber so you see here these are the very think he trying to it's just very simple but he's telling us now let's be careful because deception is that simple deception is that you see it's only a little Le that 11 the L only a little so he says and if there be if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not why because he said there'll be many false Christ arise and false prophets and show great signs and wonders in so much now look what he says if it were possible they would deceive the very elect so it says now it would be that close is the rubby that he said it would deceive those because he says they at some point they start listen to another voice well you know I was watching TBN the other day Joyce Meers said something that moved me okay Joy's M and you say you know God can use anybody God can use a donkey you know I don't know what brother Brooks talking about this woman preaching stuff I need to go check him on you know one of the we had one of these Minister come through talking about women can't preach now where did he get that from God say he pour out his Spirit on All Flesh so you see now here comes a thought because you listen to Joy's M and then now right after that you was going to the bathroom you were wondering about that thing and then Paula White came on Paula White say yeah let me tell you how God used me other day so you see now here comes a thought in your mind that you start reasoning and if you reason long enough you'll go all the way back to eat and this woman who had a husband the woman who had resources she had help she had a I believe Adam was a nicel looking man yeah big man but on top of that he was a godfear man and being a godfear man that when the serpent went and spoke to her all she had to do for that every moment and stop and say one second let me go get my husband but she wouldn't stop for a second because she said I got this and you see and when you got this he said be careful take heed let you fall so you see none of us ain't got nothing but God got us I hope you see it because you see if we were there we would have done the same thing as her you see so now you see Adam couldn't fall he was Son of God we know but we looking at we see that the very thing that was close to him that he loved and she said she loved him when the came down to receiving not the written word but when it came down to receiving a spoken word that God spoke not a man I hope you see this she had the same she had the same audience with God as Adam it wasn't until after the fall he said then you'll serve your husband but there at that time they could have had all the fellowship they wanted but she doubted the word and when Satan walks into your mind you ad doubt the word and he uses the same trick that he's used all throughout the Bible lust of the eye lust of the Flesh and the pride life he comes and he says to her he says are you sure that God is going to kill you if you do wrong are you are you positive and he says well maybe not but God is nice I've never seen anybody do I've never seen a but I've never seen seen a bird follow the sky I've never seen a lion chase a lamb I my husband he's always been sweet to never spoke a harsh word everything is so sweet I don't even got to wear clothes the temperature so nice and he says to her he said are you sure that God is going to kill you if you do this one little thing and you see how is that not more so than what job said he said that that woman and he says if that woman come and she deceive you could be manad if they come and try to deceive you they're coming to a place that now they're trying to take your mind off the word of God and I want you to see now the Bible say we don't WR against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness principalities he said rules of this world and he says it's in high places high places now before I just get ahead of myself I want to just share something with you share something with you if I can get it up real quick just want to lay a background here look at this look at this uh listen to this if if you if you haven't heard it you might have I'm not sure but it was just something that caught my my attention because you know that it was a in Parade Magazine that the pope recently on Easter he had three different attitudes he wanted to share with the people and remember now your attitude toward the word he said that means everything amen Remember When Jesus came it says it was one woman that touched the H of his gar and her attitude when she touched it before she touched she knew that she'd be hungry amen and after all the people touching Jesus Jesus knew that virtue had went out of his body amen because and he asked who touched a woman and then here over here there was a man that R back and he spit in his face and he slapped him as hard as he could and when he slapped him he said you ain't you ain't no son of God look at you hit him his heart prophesy tell us which one is so you see it your attitude toward the word that determines everything amen and you see that's and I hope you see the pope now took uh uh some time and he took the moment to discuss three different attitudes that he felt that the whole world needed to he and I want you to hear this he says now look what he says he says here it was three things hopefulness openness and living in Joy now remember he said you we we have to live in joy and he says a Christian should always now live in joy and I just want to take that one not to go through all of it for time sake he says dear friends if we walk in Hope allowing ourselves to be surprised by the new wine that Jesus offers us we have joy in our hearts and we cannot fail to be Witnesses of This Joy Christians are are joyful they are never gloomy God is at our side and we have a mother who always intercedes for the life of her children for us as Queen Essa did in this reading now I want you to see it for a second now that they gave him I think last year year before the Jews gave him a a symbol of Dove they say he's the man of peace and he comes and he says he says that we're all Christians we all love the Lord but if you could just see if you want joy we all have a mother we all have a mother and you know her name she she has the immaculate son the one that's been created and I and I ask you this is he really trying to unite people to Jesus is his hard really to bring people closer to him or now does it sound so good that he still ready to cheat you he's ready to deceive you for now ready to say if you come and join together there'll be some underlying thing that you'll recognize and one day your money will be worth nothing that's what he said so now there's a message now to the people it says you better get ready and don't stop and stop playing around it says and better see what God is doing am so you see when Deception comes in when there's slothfulness when he says when you see yourself you see because the spirit of God leaving the Earth it's harder to pray brother Isa it's harder now to read your Bible you ever read you ever been sitting there at night reading your Bible you sitting there and next you know you wake up and you like praise the Lord you ever sat there for an hour looked at your Bible it looked at you and you wonder what in the world I just read you see now you see there's a pull you see it's not until you get in the spirit brother brother and then now it means something to you but you can open up the book you can come to church and you can say they come from the East and West they come from the lands of far praise the Lord and then if it doesn't mean anything to you you don't really know who they is brother tro you don't so you really don't know that it's talking about you you reading and now it's a promise in that book directly for you but because you don't see that God said he already provide and you have fell asleep you go in there you get mad and wife why you buy them grits why you always buying grits if you keep buying them grits we ain't G to have no money so you see now but you just read in the book that my father only count a thousand years but you better stop buying them grits so you see here now because you didn't catch the revelation of what God was trying to tell you he was saying that yeah she bought the Grits but that's going to be all right you see so then you could go in and maybe say something to whisper in the ear how you should oh this is how you handle you see remember if God now gave us as Kings and Priests over this Earth The Authority remember all from Genesis to rule over everything then in your own dominion in your own home God wants to now give you rues so he wants everything to be made perfect amen but it comes down to our hearts is that are we letting Satan cheat US of everything God has for us because you see if he deceives you then what'll happen is you'll see that in your time in your money it's not really set on the things that God has for you and you look a little closer and you say well Lord why am I struggling so much and it shows that it must be something kindled down in your heart for the word now to anoint that for it to come back to life and it means something in your life that now you know what even when I'm here in this place God is using me to help strengthen somebody else think about it every time you see every time you get closer to God it becomes harder and harder because God is pulling you he's pulling you but the trials that it says don't let these trials that that that seem to come to you be like uh strange to you don't think that they're uh you know just they come out of anywhere it's God allows those trials so that then now he knows that it'll push you closer to God well now you pray a little bit more you'll think about him a little bit more but if you let the devil come and deceive you then he comes now and he's taking the very sand from under your feet and we don't even know so Jesus said remember if he didn't short this time that none of us this morning would make it now think about this now so God has to come and do something that we can't do see he knows how to make provision brother he can now take time and make it shorter just to make sure you make it but because see I want you to catch this this morning what did he do but because before you ever came to this earth God put something in you called a seed and you see that seed it you cannot change what the seed the DNA of the seed the SE that sold the seed was the son of God he sold it into this Earth he created a vessel of clay he breathed into it the breath of life and now he said these two people that's going to come together when they come through sex they're going to have you sitting here this morning so here we are this morning all now creatures of God and God doesn't want any of us to be lost but now he's trying to do something on our have but now we have a responsibility too see God will do his part but will we do ours let me let me read something to you just turn with me to uh um uh Lord let's just go to 2 Thessalonians 2 want to read these scriptures to you just get them out the way look at these um 2 Thessalonians 2 it says verse three now look what it says here I just start verse two that ye be not soon shaken in your mind you don't want the devil to come into your mind and shake your whole family to shake your whole world by troubling your mind he said or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as the day of Christ is at hand so he's coming to encourage you amen and he says now look at this but let no man deceive you by any means don't let any person teach you of what God has promised for you brother King he says why for the day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that the man of sin be revealed the son of predition so he tells us that now like Matthew 24 there will have to be a manifestation of the son of man the son of pedition and also the son of man man in the sent of predition now he's going to reject everything that's about God in this hour so he says plainly don't let him deceive you he says why cuz now there's going to be a falling away in the church there's going to be a falling away in people that say they love the Lord there's going to be people that now start off with you and he'll say well you run well he say so who hindered you and he said that the promises there before you who is hindering you this morning from going all the way with the Lord so he says don't be deceived if you don't catch Jesus Christ for yourself then now you might be lost this morning you this morning the individual you have to know yourself that you beyond the shadow of a doubt that God has spoken to your heart and that you've been filled with his holy spirit because when he feels you then he said he's going to bring you because now the voice that you're hearing is not your own it's not the person this person this woman or this radio show but you're now hearing the voice of God speaking to you oh I hope you see this my brother but he says but don't be deceived so you see deception he keeps warning us over and over let me let me just let's keep reading another scripture Galatians just want to drop some before you to get the point across go look at Galatians 6 if you don't get there before I do I'll just read it to you so he says in Galatians 6 he says what be not not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man sth that he shall reap so he says again don't you think that God is not going to complete every word that he promised everything he says so good or bad is got to come back to you the individual but don't be deceived so he's warning us over and over don't let the devil cheat you now let's look at this my brother sister this another scripture real quick uh let turn over to what I have First Corinthians I just want to read this really quickly now look at this you know it was what's the guy uh he said he's happy happy happy what's the guy name um Duck Dynasty and Paul Roberson remember it was a while back that he got in trouble so to speak uh because he quoted this Bible verse and when he quoted this Bible verse he said that now they were asking about homos uality and he was saying that you know what do you think about homosexuality now he quoted this scripture and you see it got everybody in the Uproar and he did something that uh brother Brook Joe Olin may not do yeah he just he said his belief yeah and he stood on him to say if the word of God says it that's what he said so you see he didn't back up at all but he stayed right with what he said the scripture said now let's make the point what he said he dropped down here and this is what he said I'll just make to make it sure um uh Lord let's see let me just I'll make it verse n know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God so let's make this very clear if we're living in sin we're not going to heaven don't fool yourself if you're living in sin you're not going to heaven if you were to die today are you sure you're going to heaven because you see if I wasn't ready to meet God today then it would mean something for me to come to church and say Lord today might be the last day but you see if sin still rest on their heart that you'd rather live in sin then now guess what you're rejecting God one more time and guess who was coming Satan is coming to deceive you again and you see look he said know ye not so let's not make no mistake about it he says be not deceived and it says here plainly that neither fornicators now fornicators you ain't married you haven't s come on now Lord look he said fornication the Bible tells that God killed 23,000 in one day yeah because he hated this act now look if God ha foration he also hate adultery so he says very plainly Paul is saying so to the Corinthian Church he says first he says let's just get this straight you're not going to make it if you fornicate so he had to now he had to make it straight so that people would know so you see if I have my brother say well you know better you can't fornicate you see that if you have a daughter if you have a sister you have a son a wife or Uncle whoever is that when you step outside the word of God do you're not seeing that a sexual lust demon is enticing you to now come and what be part remember Samson was a man of God and as a man of God Samson now when the Philistines came to him they said go to they said theila go to him he's got a Nazarite vow we see the power of God all over so we can't do nothing with him but they sent a woman his way and the woman they sent his way Lord yeah the woman they s his way she said I want you to do this one thing they said go and entice him so you see the enticement now you see brother the B come he said they would never take all the clothes off but they take off just most so you would still have curiosity yeah and you see sin is enticing and you see it wants you to take the next step what is it now today they call it bet but it's still pornography they call it p m MTV but it's still pornography you see it's when you look at these things these award shows they're now lustfully if you look very closely look at now that woman on the billboard that has that she's selling paper napkins and if you look at them eyes she like it's the same look it don't matter if it's a s can yeah yeah and you see what is it it's trying to tell you that if you get the soda you get hurt if you get the rim you get hurt if you get the ties you get hurt but you see it's not true because the Bible says the ways of her path is straight to hell so you see here now Paul making it very clear don't step outside these boundaries be ye not deceived I hope you see this don't be cheated Oh Glory to God you see the devil's always trying to forun God and he's trying to cheat the people of God out the Blessed most holiest thing that God wants to do for him the best thing God could give you outside salvation is a god Fe wife and you see God will give you even something better than that he'll give you the Holy Ghost to make it work glory to God because you're saved see it don't matter see what if why my wife could wake up one day today and say I don't care nothing about my husband what am I going to do what's keeping her I can't control that but now if she says that something has got to keep me come on now I'm talking about that's something this morning keeping you that's something now it's so many script I said Lord but I hope you see this so he says these very simple things they come and they destroy your church not the Corinthian Church but your body your temple he says your mind your spirit it'll give you heartache amen there's many scars along the way when we reject the word of God and the scar is something that it may heal up but it's still there amen and every time you see it you say my you remember yeah and God wants to put you in remembrance of something look at Lord look at this he says here neither adulterers you can't love hunting more than you love God you can't love now basketball more than you love God you can't love our Stak hurricane tornado more than you love God you can't yell the basketball game more than you in church come on now oh Kentucky on woo woo get the church praise the Lord God now that's really not you yeah it was a guy young man I asked him I matter fact I was in the prison I said any of y'all ever played football and the guy said I play football I asked him I said when you got in the end zone what did you do he said man I did the Funky Chicken and he said man I was you ain't had to tell me nothing so you tell me when you got in the endzone you rejoice yeah now I sit now we come this class and some of y'all sit there just as hard as you want to be and I said I asked you the question he says but when you was in the end zone you was cutting a rug yeah you was thanking God you was even praise the Lord but now you're a Christian you can hardly say Amen now I said hold on that ain't being a real person to me you kind of being fake to me you you trying to hide something from Brother Kyo you trying to show me because when you mad in that kitchen you can everybody neighborhood can hear you but then you come in church praise the Lord Praise You can't be louder when you mad than when you're happy come on come on now come on now he say we can't we can't be that so you know it be you know I hey look I'll tell him why one time I said now sweee I said now it's many times she tell what you here I said I like if I did treat you wrong I said Lord if I like let's say I um I didn't put the clothes up I left my coat out my jacket I say oh Lord forgive me oh well if you forgive you put you put that jacket up next time I say well yeah you're right sweetie that's right that's right but then now let me let let me see her lay something out who now the devil say go ahead and let her have it go ahead and let her have it you know cuz she knew you was tired when she told you last go ahead and let her have it you say oh it's really uh I see you got something out there El what you trying to say well you know might we might want to get that up you know uh praise the Lord but you see if God don't give you Grace and you're like oh I tell you what we going to get the devil out out of here you see so it take God now to come and do something for you because he's trying to say the two shall become one flesh but you have to be real before God and each other you see he said because you I hope you see God made all of us he said all nothing something that doesn't have emotion is what is dead and God made all of us what he said what that we might Rejoice some May Cry some may weep some may shout some may run but you will do something you'll do something cuz it's God you're a human being amen yeah I think I want you to see now say think for a second uh brother bradam as well as you we all came here one way think about it now I don't think well you know praise the Lord speaking what's going on you know how how we going to have these kids you know now it was a little bit more in it than that cuz you see here now you see it has to be an attraction has to be some fire Paul said can a man take fire into his bosom he didn't say smoke he he said fire brother ke so fire is something burning and if God is shut up in your bones he say it's like fire he say like fire shut up in your bone he said oh son of man can these bones live so he says when these bones when that dead man hit the quickening pads in the bone even he still jumped out the grave because it's still life in them bones in your bones this morning oh Lord not adultery oh see we can't go through all these Lord help us he said no adulterers he said no effeminate so this is what God in trouble he said homosexuality he said now look at this he tried to tell us very clearly he said now this is a manto man woman and a woman right and he says no abusers of them with Mankind and then he says nor thieves or Covetous or drunkers or revivers or extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God so it's very clear that it's not just homosexual but they took a spin on it but now how can a man go a guy he's on ESPN CN in he's a news anchor he says well I'm a Christian and I'm gay and you say well how can that be if you say you're Christian is right there in the Bible how what are you reading though because he's identified himself as a class of person he hasn't identified it as Sin he identified as the science dictated to me that I'm just a certain kind of person I'm like a white man or black man or Chinese it's just this is how God made it but the Bible says that when God made Adam he took out the real and every feminine part he took it out and he put it in what another vessel so it came be brother Keith not with God separate but now you see it's very plain and all we're asking here is why won't we just let God be God and say what he said well this man didn't have much to I guess lose as they would say he said you guys came to the woods to find me so he stayed on what he said and he says in verse 11 it says and I want you to see what Paul said and such were some of you so hold on now glory to God so why don't they keep reading brother bro why they stop right there it says and such were some of you so in God's house he said there were people people that were homosexual there were people that now live with fornicators there were people that was adulterers they in the house of God now there's something in here oh I hope you see this there's some in here and if you in here now he says now but those that are in there he said such were so there's no way you can come to Christ and stay that way my brother there's no way he said now you believe the word of God he said you were that way and he says and now he says but ye are what wased when he wased you so he had to now me he had to come and get that off you and get that off you and get that off you and you see you see you was to be wise you got to stand still to be wise you got to stand still for a minute how is God going to move if you don't stand still for a minute if you want God to do something in your life stand still for a minute and let God do something he said when you don't know exactly what to do don't do nothing just wait on God because when youve done all to stand he says stand therefore he said what your La is guarded he said what because God is the one that is keeping you and you are not even standing it's by the spirit of God that he picked you up and he saids you're standing on dry ground Solid Ground when they went through that Red Sea it wasn't muddy sir millions and millions of gallons of water when they went through my brother it was dry but you know what if you're not in it may not mean nothing to you because you don't want to be washed you ever seen a little boy baby and they say I used to be one go out there and play in the mud I didn't want to take no B move all over I don't want to go to church I want to make my money I don't want to pay my ti he said you know I want God to do something I don't even want to pray as a baby that don't want to be wiseed but if you could sit there why don't you want to let God get that funkiness off you see when you in sin you stink you think he don't even know it you know remember when I first start wearing deod my dad he come he say boy you're smelling yourself ain't you and you about 12 years old you had to go get something and I didn't know what he meant but then after a while I knew what he meant and now it comes you oh I need to do something so now I need to get something that would hold back what the press the pr the perspiring of my body so I need an anti- pressant this morning God is trying to give us the same see it's a promise that if you put it on and you get washed that you won't stink no more he said when you put it on he said there'll be a sweet odor that comes come out of your por it's something when hard times come something says pray yeah but you just blow up like a bull frog rib it I tell you what I tell you what but now but now it's something that comes out and the lamb Nation says but it's going to be all right you see brother Brooks knows I was at the airport and that lady didn't find my bag boy I said oh something deep down said rib it wonder wonder to rib it and I'm sitting there saying what this lady doing what are we doing here God said just laugh I said Lord you said in all things Rejoice so all I can do is laugh I said well Lord you can find a b cuz she really don't even know where it is she didn't pack it but I'm looking at her like what you got my bag if you don't give me my bag it's going to be problems you see now this is what com in your heart but now God he said oh look forgive don't a worry about it so then books he said you said but he answers prayer he answers prayer God said I give you I'll give you some deodorant little tooth brother said well praise the Lord and I ask you this morning if we're going to be if we've been watched if we've now been to the place that he said we were deceived but now God has done something the for does it not mean something to you to go share with somebody else am you see there's people that are still deceived and I want you to think you remember like just think for a second uh Jose Jehoshaphat remember when Jehoshaphat was down there with uh Ahab and he said they were going to go to war and it says that when in making a decision he said let's be one people let's we we can all be one Army we share the same Army same resources everything right but it was something in Ahab that now it says he said there's one man that I believe that hates me and after he heard that lying Spirit remember it was a deceiving spirit that was sent that went was before God's Throne that left the Throne of God and he went down and said you'll be a lying spirit in the midst of four in the mouth of 400 other preachers they were on Earth at that time so if God allowed it then he can allow it now amen 400 and there's only one man Hallelujah only one man that can tell the truth and the king of Israel that's on the throne he turned around and said I just I I know he one more man and he said but I don't want to hear what he got to say because he I he hates me and everything he says is just evil concerning me but you ever ask why won't he repent and you see when you come and you come to the Lord the Lord does with you does something in your life and changes your life then people around you they start to get jealous because now what they're saying really is is you think that you're somebody now and all you want to do is share the same Grace with them that God gave you that's all you want to do and you see but it was something I hope you catch in this story there was something about it that was in the heart of Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat told Ahab he said oh let the king not say so go ahead and let the man come and when he came he says oh what you want he said well I'm hearing what the other preacher saying they said go take the land go out be blessed right God is going to do something for you I'm reaching to the TV right now just sending a million dollars right now and God going to do something for you I'm telling you the blessings on the way oh how what what what's the interpretation send more money look at it now I'm telling you that's what they do it said Li spirit I saw this thing God they had this church they were singing this song I command my hands to praise the Lord yall ever heard that song then they said I command my pockets to praise the Lord and they had the men go out and get the get the plates and he said okay they came up and people started giving money in the plates and then they kept playing mus he said now he says the guy looked at he said we need to command more Pockets play one more time I command my pocket I'm telling you so now you see that how the devil does he said it's a pool now and it's a lying spirit that goes now into the mouth and he's trying to get something but he's not getting the people to Christ well you see Jehoshaphat it was something deep down Randy that now touched him and what touched him was he said oh well you know what he said let that King say so it got to be somebody else now I ask you what came into his heart what was there that now was in Jehoshaphat that made him just cry out and say there's got to be one more amen now look it was something that you can't explain it's something that he couldn't explain because oh Lord I got you see he was in Covenant with you already but now he comes and he says he he prophesies and he says oh you know go and go do what everybody else says he said no now Ahab stops and says tell the truth see even he knew that now it wasn't right but you see he still needed jehoshaphat's help and you see he was laying there because he wanted to deceive Jehoshaphat and you know the story as they go to war it says they go forth to war and now guess what as they're out there Jehoshaphat who was tricked he had on ahab's garments he's going there and he cries out and what do you hear oh Lord help me and now the very same Prophecy of the arrow that went forth that kills him the prophecy comes true and now here comes a seed of God who couldn't be deceived because God now came in and he had mercy it was a man that feared god with his heart it was a man that walked before him and his ways was perfect it was a man that told the people we could just humble our said under the mighty hand of God in turn of my Wicked way that God would come and he said what he would hear our prayer he wasn't deceived and I want you to see here today God doesn't want us to be deceived if we take the promise turn I I want to just I want to just read something to you really quick uh oh Lord let me just read something let me read something to you Lord help me I got to pull it up I got I I almost think I might might need to print this thing out it's uh now look at uh let me see here must read two things in here just two things now I want you to see here something at the end time in the end time God's message to the people at the end time has always been one of delivered now I want you to think about that for a second hallah in Noah's day Hallelujah Before the Flood came God spoke to Noah and he built the ark and what he did when he built this Ark he said we know there was one way in one way out and he gave the word to one man had him preach a preacher righteous for 120 years and now it was only something in now who his family and in animals to get into Christ so God now put something in mankind if he can put in an animal then God could put something in you so that you would know when the end time comes that now you better get ready so God has put a seed there I hope you see and it's always been that before it comes down remember Jo remember Jericho when them walls came down how were they going to get those walls to come down if they were running chariot races around these walls how could it get them fall down well you know what God said somebody grow and start praising me amen after seven days of going around the seventh day go around seven times and he said go get a trumpet and all you got to do is start praising God and he said all them thick walls of Life of issue they come down because at the appointed time you start praising God you see that was God doing something for his people so you see here what is God telling us he said now there's bombs with Russ B Russia has bombs with our names on and before any bomb would ever hit the United States now I want you to see this 58 to God but now this 2014 and now he said Russia has bombs with our names on and they can hit the button at any time and now there's issues in Ukraine and criteria and now we're seeing here that now what is God doing he's holding back the angel of the Lord is holding it back only to get somebody else in he's holding it back it's a message of Deliverance you see why he said don't be deceived for God is Not mocked God don't give a word and then he can't feel it so you see we got to look at the times we've had like just four blood moons remember they said I was looking at it you said n 1492 from Christopher Columbus then you look at 59 to 1967 is become a nation it's now 2014 and God now he said there the son will turn to Darkness he said the moon shall turn to blood and now what do we see there's signs in the heaven that God is moving again every time you see it oh I hope you see it every time it was God doing something for his people the Jews cuz he said I would never forget Israel so he said but all he says Israel is not Israel but there in in Christ no Jew nor Greek Bond nor free male nor female for All In Christ are one so the seed been planted and the seed now he say it's moving by the power of God it's something quicker than the seed say wake up and see be ye not deceived don't be cheated you say you see the thing that God has prepared us it hasn't even entered to your mind the thing that God has before you it hasn't even entered into your spirit your heart your soul it's not even entered in so right now it's about can the son of man come and find Faith amen can he find Faith right now in this place is enough Faith to know that you say to my neighbor Jesus Christ is here in this church if you could just come with any element God can heal you all you got to do is have faith how do you know because Jesus Christ promised and then what else do you need yeah you ain't deep it ain't got to be deep because he promised and you see the Promise it brings forth It's greater than the problem if you look at the promise is always bigger than the problem but we focus on the problem so much that we miss what the promise is saying amen look oh look let me I guess gota read I gotta read something to you oh Lord uh Lord let me let me put like this listen let me read this to you if his children us today the children of God and we will only take his word so he can prove it by you if we would only take his word he would prove it by us this morning amen so he's not looking for someone else but God wants to prove his word by someone in this building today so proving it he says that's the only way he can prove his word if you see if you get sick how can God prove he's a Healer unless somebody gets sick and now he they have enough Faith to believe that Jesus Christ heals how else can he prove that he's a Healer today but you see if that person don't have faith and we don't have sometime even faith for them then how can God show he's a Healer he already he said it's finished so look but he said he doesn't prove it to unbelief now see that's kind of heavy to see that God wants to prove himself but God ain't no clown and he holds it back he says they can't be proved they are unbelievers but it's not to unbelievers it's for it's not for unbelievers it's to him that believe amen and if he can find somebody who will believe his word he will prove his word by you oh glory to God and sometimes sickness and things things happens to us that way that God can prove himself God wants to prove himself and I just ask you today will we let him prove himself amen if we know that he said we can't even be lost he says if we are his elect seed that now here he comes how do we know because when the Holy Spirit drops down on the sea you'll recognize the word for your day amen let's make it very plain remember he said here in John 8 when Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees they were claiming that they were the seeds of Abraham when you talk to most people that say they're Christian they all say that they believe God they say they love Jesus and they say that they think they're going to heaven all all is well right but now when Jesus spoke to them he looked that beyond what they were saying he looked in their heart when he look at their heart he saw that they were rejecting him and when by them rejecting him they were not just rejecting Jesus they were rejecting God Amen because it was God in him the fullness of God in him so in him dwell the fullness of God had B so here he is and now he's standing there and I ask you if they rejected Jesus who else was going to come and preach to them and they believe the signs and wonders he did walked on water raised the dead he said which one of you can what say that I'm unbelief can say that there unbelief in me what sin do you see in me you can't condemn me of sin so he says this and he looks beyond them and he says you are of your father the devil now that's some heavy words sir for God now you see for God to look and say you are of your father the devil then who's their father you see you see this is very plain this is God speaking to you and he's saying that you I ain't he said you're not my child come on because he said the seed would always do what he said if you was Abraham's seed you would Rejoice to see my day so then you say where's the rejoicing where's the rejoicing of what God has done he said but the reason you can't understand is because what he said because my word has no place in you now come on now he says so if the word of God doesn't have place in somebody there's no magnet there's no attraction if you put a magnet to aluminum there's no pull but you put that on a good heavy maybe piece of Steel before you get by it comes right to because there an attraction Jesus said the words I speak he said the flesh profited nothing but the words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the word of God he's moving see God's Moving Like a Man and he's moving now he's looking for the seed and remember it won't be much time so when it starts moving over it says what it starts picking up one here picking up one there picking up one there he says why because there's an attraction there he is the mountain and I want you to see this won't be much longer I want you to look at this with me just really quick you asked the question let's look at uh First Kings you ask the question you say when you look in the Bible you say so Brother Kyle how is it that that woman I mean that Jehoshaphat how did she how did he know pause how did he know how did he know because it was something laying beneath he said that's skin and I just want you to see this with me just for a second just a look at this remember there's a story in the Bible First Kings 17 that there was a drought and God had a man of God in the scene called Elijah the Tish and remember before when the drought came the drought came because it was spoken by his word and he said that there'll be neither due nor rain he says and he said until I call for it and it was three and a half years he said that everything stopped and everything stopped why because the son of man on Earth called for this prophet of God I don't if you see this so when he called for he said it has to stop so he was now the Bible says that he went when he called for the famine that then he went and he went by the Brook of chair and by the Brook of cheriff he said he was there and he said I'm God spoke to him and said I'm going to feed you and he said I'm going to send an Unfaithful bird a bird that don't even take care of his young I'm going to give an unbeliever on your job and he said somebody don't care nothing about you hate your guts and he said I'm going to use him to help bless you and he says he says I'm going what I'm going to do is he said I'm going to have this bird feed you every day so there was a famine but now he was by Brook and he's by Brook and he's still drinking brother and now he's eating brother Keith and he's having a good time but there's a famine in the land amen now in this famine the Bible says that he was eating good maybe getting with the Lord having prayer time the Lord that God was still blessing his son of man but now something comes up the Bible said that the brook dried up yeah now when the Brooks of Life dry up remember he where would he go and just go get something to eat and drink where could he go it was no place else to go but when it dried up Ruby it was like now he's sitting there and now he had to wait to hear from God Amen see God told him to go there and before he could leave God had to tell him to leave I hope you see this so you see that's why we as see Servants of God we want to be led by his Spirit now remember he said those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you see so now when the brook drives up I want you I'm just trying to save a little time look where he goes he goes from charith and now the Bible say he said arise and get thee to zerath which belongeth to zidon so now he goes to the place where uh um Jezebel is from yeah he must to go all the way where Jezebel is and now remember it says historically is about maybe 75 miles from charedi to zerath and zerath it means now you see zerath was a place it was very Wicked remember Jezebel this where this is her Homeland and this prophet of God after drinking and eating all he had left he had to now go 75 miles to zarapa 75 miles remember it wasn't no Lexus it was no airplane was no helicopters you know it was get on the donkey or get on the get on your to get on Pat and turn Pat every Pat your feet turn the corner amen he had to get going amen so 75 miles ain't no quick journey and you better know that you remember it's a family in land and you better know wherever you go that God is going to keep you so you see even though he saw everything dried up it was something in him that said you know what since God told me to go I got to go here so as he started W as he started going he gets down to this place and you see he's only listening to the spoken word of God and he has to trust that voice just like we got to trust that Voice Hallelujah we have to trust the same what the voice of the word for your day that it'll bring you to the right place now everything in the land is starting to dry up you say currency is worth nothing you see come on now look at all look at the debt they showing kickers and all you see that going up right so when who's going to bring it down come on now billionaires can't get us out this the interest the interest so you see when you're in a a big hole it takes somebody with a big shovel to get you out am and you see see money it ain't vaporized it went somewhere but the person who's holding it it's going to cost you something oh I can help you out you know I can I I got you but Adam I can take care of you but it's going to CAU you amen you see nothing he say no such thing as a free lunch so you see here here we are it says he's going to this place and he knows that it's sin in this place he knows it's wickedness in this place but God is leading him amen when he gets down to this place this place of zerath is a place now of smelting that means it's a place now where God has to apply pressure yes sir a place where God has to apply heat and he has to send his Prophet there yeah and remember see when he goes down there the Bible says that now there was a woman down there and I want you to see this woman down here it says she she was a widow woman and all she had was a little son her husband had passed and she was Raising this child by herself and in raising this child y'all it's like she was experiencing the same now things that everybody else was seeing it was hard to get those kids get them up and get them go to school in the morning it was hard to now sit there and pray with him at night because he had hunger p yeah it was hard because you see as the famine came on it said that as she was eating he was eating too but she had to eat less just to make sure he'd be okay and she had to now maybe take on a lot less just so she could provide for her son and she only had one so you see it was God putting two people in a pressure point he putting two people now in the crock pot and now as they're on two different extremes God is now bringing them to the same two omnipotence he has to make them meat because it's a famine now I want you to think about something now during the famine even though things got tight he was eating and she was eating I hope you see this now they were both eating so you may not be eating a lot this morning but you'll be eating but you you got to because he said there's always light in Ghost and God came and he said I had to provide because my seed is down there it's a Jesus said there were many widows in the land but God only sent Elijah to this one woman so it must be something special about her it must be something that maybe that she can grab a hold of that everybody can't grab a hold of it must be something that'll quick in her heart that maybe it doesn't Quicken everybody's heart it must be something about the word of God that she believed in that she Feast on that was different than what the whole nominal world was saying because it provided for her when everybody else started even eating their own babies when everybody else was going into adultery and fornication and this it says be not deceived she held on to the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the god of Isaac she knew that that's my God too and you see something in her heart she started crying out and God said you know what I got to now go and send my Prophet to this woman because and he tells he tells him he said go to zath for there's a a widow woman there that's going to sustain me so it's a woman that set her life aside because even though her husband was gone she decided to now stay true because now all she had was her son and she said this is enough God can provide for me oh I hope you see this so as she's standing there as she's up there maybe one day and it was maybe getting down to as the Bible tell us the last little bit of everything and if you've ever been down to your last little bit it ain't a fun thing it's very nerve wck because you see if you start a job and then you get the new job it takes three weeks but the rent is due at the end of the week for you one week in the whole and what are you going to do for the other two weeks but then now guess what it's the beginning of month so the cell phone do and guess what the light be so which one you going to pay well if they turn my lights boy I don't know what I'm gonna do but I tell I need my cell phone because I like the text message come on hey come on see there's some taxes in here TX but you can turn my lights off oh yeah man I had a guy one time invite him in church he was saying that man you know K he said I think he gonna turn my lights off the day I said why don't you come to church then well I think I just sit home in the dark I said well my brother we got lights in the church you know what I'm saying why you just going to sit in the D you see it don't make no sense but then you ask people have so many excuses when it comes to re receiving now the word you say why when the pope was speaking that message to the world he said his message was called let us be light and he said he asked he this is what he said to the entire world and he's speaking down to the individuals saying to the individuals we have to be something yeah and now I I hope you would see that in Goan oh Lord this come this is where this woman was away from everybody but yet she's still sitting here now and God is shining on her because he's providing for her look what happened her faith had to be something to attract this prophet and when he comes to her just think maybe she's going out there by the gate that morning and she sees a man she looks out say this man all scruffy kind of beard maybe hair all matted up he got a little stick like this and think Lo maybe a little honey on them maybe a little fish and he's sitting there see the woman woman don't know her he don't they don't know each other woman he says go ahead and fetch me hold on now sister some of y'all say fetch fetch you know who I am fetch do you know come on now let me some of y'all mean hold hold on let me read it he says woman fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel and he said that I may drink so now it was go get me something to drink hold on I don't even know you you asking me it's a famine where I'm going to get you something to drink for so if all this stays in her mind and it enters into her heart then she doesn't really know that she could be entertaining an Angel UNA the way but you see deep down in there something had to stop and say there something about that voice I can't explain it but it's something about the voice fetch me a little water now she maybe she said well I can get them a little water there a little water over there and I think by the you know by the stove I can get him some water so she turns May goes to get him some water but going to give him some water he speaks again and you see sometimes as we walk in this Christian Journey God will tell you something he may say he brother he say come to this place out or if he tell you go to hour he when you get there I also need you to do something else Lord I'm I'm just trying to get the hour come on now you know I Lord I need a job okay let get job okay when you get the job now I need to go tell this person that you know they need to get stop living in sin well Lord hold on Lord I need a job hold on God now you see he does these kind of things and after he told her to get the water then he said hold on the Bible said as she was going to fetch it so she took the word and she acted on it and in doing it he called to her bring me I pray thee he says a morcel of bread in thy hand hold on hold on he didn't say meal he didn't say oil he didn't say the ingredients he said bring me some bread so what he really asked for is I want you to go in your house I want you to do something for him and she says to her I just got to read it to you it says and she said as the Lord thy God liveth now she begins now to talk back before the water I can do but now let me tell you my situation man of God he says I have not a cake and but a handful of meal and a bear and a little oil and a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die so he told ISAC the situation and the situation was I can get you some water but in my cupboard all I have is a little bit of meal and oil now we know the meal was Christ the oil was the Holy Spirit but we see here that she looked at her natural substance and as she looked at she said now this is all I got and I'm going to feed my little son now the situation was if her son didn't eat this last meal then it would be she'd be finished anyway cuz it was nowhere to turn but she looked and she said man of God I got something said she had to tell her situation now the Bible said if you ask you shall receive seek and ye shall find then he said knock and it shall be open unto you now she didn't know who she was talking to but she said I got to tell you my situation now after she tells the man of God her situation glory to God she says and Elijah said unto her fear not so first let's get all the unbelief out the way this morning all the unbelief has to get out of your heart before you can see God that means that it can't be nothing between your mind your heart your soul and your savior amen it's just you in Christ and he says fear not the man of God says go and do as thou has said but make me there a cake a little cake first and bring it unto me and make it for thee and for thy son hold on now she said but it's only enough for one biscuit now I want you to see she been sharing everything but at this point now I want you to see that it has to be something special about this woman there were many other people that cuz look at this the Bible tells in the end day there'll be many false Christ to arve and the false Christ arise how did this woman not know this was a a a a false prophet how did did she not know that he was coming to eat her bread and eat her son's bread and then go to the next neighbor's house how did she know that and then now as she started getting watered she told the situation now this man is telling her go ahead and get me something first so what he really asked her he said believe that I'm a man of God and after you first believe that I'm a man of God he said don't have fear cuz I didn't come here to hurt but he says as I came here I want you to serve me first remember he didn't say nothing about the Lord yet oh he said I want you to go in your house and give me something first yeah remember he said remember when it's like in uh Second Chronicles 24 remember when uh who who was that um down there when they had Jo joash remember joash when he when he got to become the king that they put a chest outside the gate and everybody they kept coming to the city they would keep pouring into what the chest yes and he was now the young king he reigned when he was 7 years old remember and 7 years old he reigned for like 40 years and he came down to joash when it came all the way down to it that when he became king that jeod was the one that built him up he was the one that now he was the priest that strengthened himself and put him on the throne but then the Bible says that after jeod died that when he died then the princes of Judah came unto him and they got joash to what turn his heart away from the Lord and the very same thing that he went to build that he labored for that he put into the chest that he brought a cups and ornaments for the house of God and to rebuild the Temple of God it became nothing because what did he do he went back and then now he made Idols to him he became an idul and now the Bible says that when the son of jeho di the one that man that had been so good to him lived 130 years when that man he came his son came up he said the spirit of God moved on Zachariah yeah and when the spirit of God moved he told him he said he said look he said look why are y'all doing what y'all doing he said why don't you turn back to the Lord and the Bible said they sent Prophet at the prophets and the Bible said they would not hear them cuz they were caught up in they have been deceived and then being deceived now what they do the Bible said that the people rose up and they could they they conjur them on themselves they took stones and they killed them and Jesus comes later and he says he said that the blood he said of righteous Abel and the blood of Zachariah he said that very blood is going to now be on your heads because he said now you're the one that what you made the you you took the tombs and you made them beautiful and you garnished the seacus and he says but you never ever believe my word so he was identifying that spirit all the way then to now and you see this woman has to look past all the falseness all the things that are not like God and something has to drop down and know that that's a man of God now I want you to see this now so here she standing and as she's standing here in this place it saids that when she looks at him and she goes to get the cake she something now has to move in her to look past her situation and she had to look past her starving son amen now once you see this this ain't this ain't no light thing if you got a child and they're starving now to the bones cuz you see at that point when starvation said s ribs start showing you know bone all this the diaphragm everything everything starts showing your rib cage so you see she was seeing her son in this condition she saw many flies around his head she saw maybe him getting up moaning about stomach cramps moaning about Lord what is you going to do for us she heard her mom praying but she didn't he never saw anything happen and I want you to see it had to be something in this woman to look P her son amen and say that this man of God yeah I need to now go take the meal I have take the oil I have and I need to now go get some two sticks some fire and I need to go make a cake for this man something dropped down and it was in the seed that was there now when the whole when the word of God came now he sits there and as the woman goes to make the meal the of God looks at this woman and he says he says woman let me tell you something he says thus saith the Lord amen now remember the Bible says see he said the Greeks to after wisdom the Jews to after time but you see we're in the day that you see we really need thus sayith the Lord amen because thus say the Lord comes directly from the Throne of God and when it come to the throne of God it can't fail because it's God now dropping down and he's speaking to the Sea the same voice that talked to Jehoshaphat the same voice that now was speaking to this woman is now moving and is moving through this man of God and it's Quicken that seed saying God has a promise for you you can't be deceived so when she stops she looks at her son son everything GNA be okay and she goes now and she says don't worry the devil ain't going to cheat you this time it's been a long time we've been starving it's been rough but she says you always treat God's servant right and she goes she says let me show you how you make a fire he says take two sticks just put them there once you lay them on top of each other he says now let me show you about this meal do you know that the god of Abraham the god of Isaac that he said that we had to wave the sheath offering he said we had to wave that wave sheep offering before the people every day the first day after the Passover we had to come and wave that before and you know the reason that we grind this Mill up so good is because it's Jesus Christ oh oh who is that Mom well I I never even heard I don't even know where that came from just just something came out Lord God oh Lord and she just keep let me show you how you grind and he said he took the meal she said but you know if you're going to make a cake when you if you say you really love God the word is not just enough you need God to come and anoint that word because when God anoints that word see son this is why we use the O Mommy that's the last of it don't worry about the Lord will provide amen is that what Abraham said yeah that's just yeah that's just like Abraham and she says let me show you how you make this biscuit now look at here now when she's showing him she's showing him that now this is his last meal this is everything that is not for him it's not for him she's showing him how to give oh Lord GL to God she's showing him how to give and now she says now in order for you to have bread you got to have heat he said the heat he said yes let me show you these two sticks I got one day God's going to give us a sa Hallelujah and he's going to go through so much for us he's going to be put through the T he's going to go every fiery D of the Devil he's going to go through it and guess what he said I got to he has to be put to so the Trials come and that brings a little heat and that being heat when we put this together it's going to be a nice big brown buttery biscuit what we going to do with it Mom I'mma show you so she goes and she takes that biscuit and imagine when she turns to take that biscuit she goes to this man of God and when she's going to the man of God she knows that that's her last minut and I ask you what is moving her to go give this away remember it was nothing else to eat it was her very last her son couldn't even follow because he was too weak he was still laying on the bed and she goes to bring this biscuit now to this man of God and I want you to see because she was a seed of God when God now took that time of the famine he made it just long enough so that his Prophet could go speak to this woman this widow woman and he spoke to this one specific woman because he knew that she would hold on to the word of God and now holding on to the word of God she could never forget what God had done for her amen and she comes and as she sees turning I want you to hear exactly what the pro the prophet of God told her he said look for thus sayth the Lord God of Israel the bell of meal shall not waste neither shall the Cru of oil fail so now he's saying what is it is that even though you've emptied out everything and you put it all in a Biscuit for me the very bucket that you made the meal out of when you go back and look it's going to be more meal in the bucket Oh Glory to God this bucket that you have it'll never one dry that's why the woman at the well when she saw what Jesus Christ was she dropped her water pot and the Bible say she kicked it why because now she have finally met her real husband she finally met the man who made the well the man who made the water the one who had the living water and now when you finally see that your meal will never run dry when you obey every word that God said amen it'll mean everything to you the bucket can't run dry and he said not only will the word of God not run dry but the anointing for you to understand the word it will never run dry you see God you got to have both the mechanics and the Dynamics now it's now for God to now if we could just move ourselves out the way and we would just move ourselves out the way and say Lord I have need of thee and this woman received a promise and the promise she received it says until the day the Lord sth rain upon the Earth don't worry about anything f Jesus said when they was in the temple that when he looked around he said he asked the disciples who gave the most and what did he do he looked over and he said this widow woman he said she gave the most and they said she only gave two might but what she gave she gave all she had he said the others gave out of their abundance and you wonder today with this woman came she had to give God everything to receive the promise so what about us amen remember it was Elijah that came spoke and Elijah now he had given everything and he he had done everything the Lord told him but what about us if we were to receive that same word will we not have to give everything to really receive from the Lord see it's hard to give up everything because it's hard to I I heard a guy one time he was at church he said but K said how do I know that I'm not being deceived he said how I said because God said you being his there's no way you can be deceived it's not a man it's not a man that can take you out of Christ it ain't a woman that can take you out of Christ but you have to now enter into enter into look at this as she wented according to the word of the Lord the Bible says she and he in her house they didn't eat any in closing I just want to read something to you turn this turn with if you you don't have to turn I'm just going to read it to you Hebrews 10 it's Hebrews 10 and 22 it says I just read 21 we have a high priest over the house of God and he said let us draw near with a True Heart of full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies wise with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and unto good works as we stand he says as we let us stand he says not forsaking the Assembly of ourselves together as the man of su but exalting one another so much that we're more that we what as we see the day approaching my brothers sisters this morning if God has done all this for us let us be not deceived don't be cheated of everything that God wants to do for you you see the last scripture he said here he says not forsaking and assembling ourselves you see if God is Redeeming the time we say that we must redeem the time for all that God has done we we really must redeem the time then that means that we must truly press toward the mark and I want you to see if we're not forsaking ourselves that means we're coming together with the same heart with the same mind knowing that some may have kid problem some may have family problem husband wife boy girl job if we have these thing brother then should we not come together more should we not press together more because remember all of us some are stronger than others and so when you're not eating the same way you don't have the same strength as someone else then God has to use somebody to help pull you through I say this in closing it says this woman she wasn't deceived because she was a seed of God and you can't be deceived being a seed of God but there's a responsibility to say are you sure you're not being deceived when you see yourself slau when you see yourself maybe not giving God everything cuz you see if you're not the same way you were when you met Christ something is lacking something missing because if you're in a relationship you want that relationship to be just as good is when you first and you wanted to be that and more right so that mean it takes God to keep and strengthen you but also those that have not come to the faith that's what as we as we just in closing I ask you this morning if you've been cheap if you know maybe before the Lord that in your heart in your soul in your life that you're truly truly it says you're not really where you say where you need to be I had a man in a prison always say oh I love the Lord Brother K and this it would touch me you know this is one brother he would always even ask for tapes and he actually order books and things voice of God and all this kind of stuff but the guy end up getting a cell phone in prison that's what happen and you know the cell phone and she can see that it was a Temptation so he starts calling calling making calls then he gets called and the thing that touched me is I said well how many times and maybe preaching to e you say you ask everybody have the Holy Ghost have you given your life to the Lord everybody save sanctify and Fe but then when things come up it shows where we're really at it shows where we're really at because in your heart God knows who's King in your home it says husband love your wives and it says why you know submit to your husband all things so it has to be now two loving each other but it's still a hierarch God the man and a woman that's just the way God made it I didn't choose to be a man didn't choose to be black didn't choose to be K but that's what I am so that's that's where we at so now I have to abide by that so God made me a certain way why for his glory amen so you this morning I'm asking you truly as we just search our hearts and our soul before the Lord you says are you do you think if de pression came down you really be like this woman in the Bible you think that's really where you're at this morning that nothing could shake that God that you see here sitting on the throne of your heart you give everything you give your last to your brother you give your last to the pastor may you give your last to beac preacher whoever your wife your da your son your daughter what you give your last for someone else other than you knowing that God will provide and and that's what you see we can come to church and have church but it's different when you see when God comes and he really wants to tell you says in this hour many people are being deceived and they're going to church every day they even pay they even pay that time they even go to the prayer me but they're being deceived why because you see it has to be true fellowship with the word God has to anointed and I just ask you this as we as we just just sing this little hymn before we pray if you have any need before God Search Your Heart search your home search your phone search your Cloud search your bookcase search a radio station in your car search everything are you truly before God is he all is your heart that's all you want is Christ is there anything you if you put your kids before God they're not this is about you and God as we just pray
